betwene my Lord Chauncelor
and iudge Hales, being among
other iudges to take his oth
in VVestminster hall.
Anno. M.D.Liii.
Vi. of October.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            Chauncelor Hales.
            MAster Hales, ye shall vnderstand
that like as the
quenes highnes hath hertofore
receiuid good opinion
of you, especiallie, for that
ye stoode both faithfullie and laufulli
in hir cause of iust succession,
refusing to set your hande to the
booke amonge others that were against
hir grace in that behalfe: so
nowe through your owne late desertes:
against certain hir highnes
dooinges: ye stande not well in hir
graces fauour. And therfor, before
ye take anie othe, it shal be necessarie
for you to make your purgation,
            
               Hales.
               I praie you my Lorde, what is
the cause?
            
            
               Chauncelor,
               Informatiō is geuen▪ that ye haue
indicted certain pristes in Kent,
for saiing of Masse.
            
            
               Hales.
               Mi Lorde it is not so, I indicted
none, but in dede certaine indictamentes
of like matter wer brought
before me at the laste assises there

holdē, and I gaue order therein as
the lawe required. For I haue professed
the law, agaist which, in cases
of iustice wil I neuer (god willinge)
procede, nor in ani wise dissemble,
but with the same shewe
forth mi conscience, and if it were
to do againe, I wolde doe no lesse
then I did.
            
            
               Chauncelor.
               Yea master Hales, your cōsience
is knowne wel inough. I know ye
lacke no conscience.
            
            
               Hales.
               Mi Lord, ye mai do wel to serch
your owne conscience, for mine is
better knowne to mie selfe then to
you, and to be plaine, I did aswell
vse iustice in your saide Masse case
bi mi cōscience as bi the law, wherin
I am fulli bent to stand in trial to
the vttermost that can be obiected
And if I haue therin done ani iniuri
or wrōg: let me be iudged bi the
lawe, for I will seeke no better defence,
considering chiefli that it is
mi profession.
            
            
               Chauncelor.
               
                  
whi master Hales, althoughe ye
had the rigour of the law on your
side, yet ye might haue hadde regard
to the quenes highnes presēt
doinges in that case. And further
although ye seme to be more then
precise in the lawe: yet I thinke ye
wolde be veri loth to yelde to the
extremitie of suche aduantage as
mighte be gathered againste your
procedinges in the lawe, as ye haue
some time taken vppon you in
place of iustice. And if it were well
tried, I beleue ye shuld not be wel
able to stand honestli therto.
            
            
               Hales.
               Mi Lord i am not so perfect but
i mai erre for lacke of knowledge.
But both inconsience & such knoledge
of the law as god hath geuē
me, i wil do nothing but i wil maintain
and abide in it. And if mi goodes
and all that I haue be not able
to counterpaise the case: mi bodie
shal be redi to serue the turne, for
thei be all at the quenes highnesse
pleasure.
            
            
               Chauncelor.
               
                  
Ah sir, ye be veri quicke & stoute
in your answers. But as it shoulde
seme, that which ye did was more
of a will, fauouring the opinion of
your Religion against the Seruice
nowe vsed, then for ani occasiō or
zeale of iustice, seinge the quenes
highnes dooth set it furthe, as yet
wishinge all hir faithful subiectes
to imbrace it accordingli: & where
ye offer both bodie and goodes in
your triall, there is no such matter
required at youre handes, and yet
ye shall not haue your owne will
neither.
            
            
               Hales.
               My Lord, I seke not wilful will,
but to shew my self as i am bound
in loue to God, and obedience to
the quenes maiestie, in whose cause
willīgly for iustice sake (al other
respectes set apart (i did of late (as
your Lordship knoeth) aduenture
as much as i had. And as for my religion,
i trust it to be suche as pleaseth
God, wherin i am redy to aduenture
aswell my life as my substaūce,
if i be called therunto. And

so in lacke of mine owne power ād
wil, the Lordes wil be fulfilled.
            
            
               Chauncelor.
               Seing ye be at this point Master
Hales, i wil presently make an end
with you. The quenes highnes shalbe
enfoutmed of youre opinion,
and declaration. And as hir grace
shal therupon determine, ye shall
haue knoledge, vntil whiche tyme
ye may depart, as ye came without
your oth, for as it appeareth, ye ar
scarse worthi the place appointed
            
            
               Hales.
               I thancke your Lordship, and as
for my vocation, being both a burthen
and a charge, more then euer
i desired to take vpon me, whensoeuer
it shal please the quenes highnes
to ease me therof: i shall moost
humbli with due contentation
obei the same.
            
            And so departed from
the barre.
