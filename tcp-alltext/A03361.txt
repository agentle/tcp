            The Preface to the Reader.

And yet I must confesse that some of them bee necessarie for sund

Whiche (gentle Reader) takyng in good part, and construyng my meanyng vnto the beste, then promise to further you shortly with my treatise of Problemes, and then naturall answeres annexed, and that aptly answered.
            And a brief Herball verie rare, for the meruailous matters, & that naturall, taught in the same. And a treatise of the rare and straunge wonders seen in the aire, for these many yeres paste in sundrie Realmes and Countries right pleasaunt to reade. All whi

            Naturall and Artificiall Conclusions.
         
            The propertie of the Adamant Stone.
            
               FIrst, if any holde the Adamant Stone in his hande, vnder a goblet or siluer bole, or vnder a table, and that the same bee moued to and fro in the hand, then in the like maner will the Iron or Needle styng in the goblet, or on the table, moue to and fro, and round about. Also the Adamant sometimes with the one corner, will drawe Iron vnto it, and with the other corner put the Iron from it. Also if any annointeth this Stone with Garlicke, it doeth then hinder the Stone from drawyng any Iron or Needle vnto it, although the Needle should bee laied on the Stone. And some write that this Stone will drawe Glasse vnto it, in like maner as it doeth the Iron.
         
         
            
            The secret properties of the Egge.
            
               ANd first the round Egge set vnder the Henne bringeth foorthe a Hen chicken, and the long Egge set vnder the Hen, bringeth forth a Cocke chickē. Also the Egge with the shell laied to steepe in Vineger for three daies space, doeth after so softē it, that any maie worke the same at length like vnto Waxe. And the same Egge afterward laied in water, doeth come againe vnto the former state. Also if an Egge bee painted with sundrie colours, and the same set vnder a Henne to bryng forthe, she shall hatche a chicken hauyng the like feathers, vnto the coulours painted on the Egge. Also the Egge laied for three daies to steepe in strōg Vineger, and after for one whole Monethe laied to drie againe in the Sunne, will after come vnto the hardnesse of a stone.
         
         
            ¶ A proper conclusion of an Hasellsticke.
            FIrst take an Haselsticke of a yarde long, beyng newe cut of, and thesame cleaue iuste in the middle, giuyng the one ende so cleaued vnto thy companion to hold in bothe his handes, and th'other ende

holde your self in bothe your handes after suche sorte, that bothe the inner partes of the sticke maie looke one right against the other, in the laiyng doune on the grounde, and must also bee laied a sunder vnto the breadth of twoo fingers, in suche sorte that thei maie touch together, by an ouerthwart maner at some one place, & within a while after, you shall see them drawe and ioyne together againe of them selues. And this vnderstande, that the sticke must bee newe cleaued, soone after the cuttyng vp of it, for otherwise this sticke woorketh not the proper effect.
         
         
            ¶ A proper practise to make a Capon to bryng vp yong Chickens.
            
               FIrst to doe this, take a Capō and pull the beallie bare of feathers, and after rubbe the naked place with Nettles, settyng yong Chickens vnder hym, and he will then meruailouslie cherishe them, and bryng them kindely vp. And the rather if you so accustome to vse the Capon the like for a tyme: For by that meanes he is moued the willynger to cherishe, bryng vp and feede, yea and to loue

them so well as the Hen naturally would doe. And the reason of this is, in that thorowe the prickyng of the Nettles, he is thereby the rather desirous to touche the soft doune, and feathers of the yong Chickens sittyng vnder hym.
         
         
            ¶ To make any foule of what condition the same bee, to haue feathers all white.
            
               TO doe this, take the Egges and roll them in the iuice of the herbe called Mouseare, or in the herbe called Houselike, or otherwise in oile (after the minde of Cardanus) and after put the Egges againe in the Neast, for after the hatchyng, their feathers shall grow white.
         
         
            ¶ To make a Candle burne in the water.
            
               AND to doe this, take Waxe, Brimstone, and Vineger, of eche a like, boile these altogether ouer the Fire, vntil the vineger appeare all consumed, and then after of that Waxe remainyng, make a Candle and you shall see the proper effecte, as aboue is written.
         
         
            
            ¶ To make a woman that she shall not eate of the meates set vpon the Table.
            TO doe this, take a little of the grene Basill, and when one bringeth any dishes of meate vnto the table, then put the same hearbe secretly vnder one of the platters or dishes, that she espie it not, and as long as the hearbe so lieth on the table, the woman shall eate nothyng of that meate in the platter or dishe, whiche couereth the hearbe.
         
         
            ¶ A proper secret of the Philosophers, to make a Stone to burne without fire.
            AND to doe this, take Calamite, Brimstone, vnflecked lime, pitche, Ceruse, of eche of these three drā
               mes, of Camphora one dram, Asphaltum three drammes, all these make in pouder, and put the same into a strong potte well stopped, and after make a fire vnder the potte, encreasyng the same by little and little vntill the pouder in the potte become so hard as a stone, and when you will haue it

Also he writeth, that if a man eateth in the Euenyng before his goyng to bedde, of the hearbe named Nightshade, or Mandrake, or Henbane, shall after see in his sleepe pleasant sightes.

               TO make quarters hold, and hang together thus without tiyng, must bee doen on this wise: First, laie one of the quarters doune, as these it. letters A. and B. do instruct, on the whiche

laie the other quarter, euen as these twoo letters C. and D. doe heere represent, and on that C. and D. laie the third quarter, as the letters E. and F. doe heere expresse, and in suche sorte that E. and F. must lye vnder A.B. And beyng then thrust hard together thei cannot after fall awaie without breakyng, in that A. and B. is staied and helde of E. and F. and E. and F. of C. and D. and C. and D. holden of A. and B. so that none of them can fall a sunder the one from the other. Also that place where B.D.E. is holden or staied together, and doeth the like hold together, as by a triall of the same shal more manifestly appeare. Also the more and harder thei be thrust together, the longer thei so cōtinue hangyng together. And some suppose that a like triall vnto this, maie bee assaied and proued, either with three stickes made flatte for the nonce, or with three kniues beeyng a like, if thei bee orderly vsed.
