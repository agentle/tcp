 no mā will set a worke, though they neuer so willingly offer them selfes therto. For one shepherde or heard man is ynough to eate vp that grounde with cattel, to the occupying wherof about husbandrye many handes were requysyte. And this is also the cause that victualles be nowe in many places dearer. Yea besydes this y• pryce of wolle is so rysen that poore folkes, whiche were wont to worke it and make cloth of it, be nowe able to bye none at all. And by thys meanes verye manye be fayne to forsake worke, & to gyue them selfes to ydelnes. For after that so muche grounde was inclosed for pasture, an infinite multitude of shepe died of the rotte, suche vengeaunce God toke of their inordinate and vnsaciable couetousnes, sendyng amonge the shepe that pestiferous morreyn, which much more iustely should ha

 riche mens handes, whome no neade driueth to sell before they lust, and they luste not before they may sell as deare as they lust. Now the same cause bryngeth in licke dearth of the other kindes of cattell, yea and that so much the more, bycause that after farmes pluckyd downe, and husbandry decayed, ther is no man that passyth for the breadyng of yonge stoore. For thees ryche men bry

               es. But first they bye them abrode very chepe, and afterward when they be fattede in their pastures they sell them agayne excedyng deare. And therfor (as I suppose) the hole incommoditie herof is not yet felte. For yet they make dearth only in those places where they sell. But when they shall fetche them awaye from thens wheare they be bredde faster then they can be brought vp: then shall there also be felte great dearth when stoore begynnyth to fayle their, whear the ware ys bought. Thus the vnreasonable couetousnes of a fewe hath turned y• thyng to the vtter vndoyng of your Ilande in
 the whiche thyng the chiefe felicitie of your realme dyd cōsist. For this great dearth of victualles causeth euery mā to kepe as lytle houses and as small hospitalitie as he possible maye.

               d one that myght rather here somme thynge of thyes matters, then haue
 anye exacte or perfecte knowledge of thesame, as I will incontinent by open proffe make manifest and playn. For firste I wyll reherse in ordre all that you haue sayde: then I wyll declare in what thynge yowe be deceaued, through lacke of knowledge, in all our fassions, maners and customes: and laste of all I wyll aunswere to your argumentes, and confute them euery one. Fyrste therfore I wyll begynne where I promysed. Foure thynges yowe semed to me: hold your peace (quod the Cardynall) for by lyke yowe wyll make no shorte aunswere, whiche make such a begynning, wherfore at thys tyme yowe shall not take the paynes to make youre aunswere, but kepe it to youre nexte meatynge, whiche I would be ryght gladde that it myght be euen to morrowe nexte (onles other yowe or mayster Raphaell haue any earnest lette). But now maister Raphaell, I woulde very gladly heare of yow, whie yow thynke thefte not worthy to be punished with death: or what other punyshment you can deuyse
 more expedient to the weale publique. For I am sewer yowe are not of that mynde, that yowe woulde haue thefte escape vnpunyshed. For if now the extreme punishment of death cannot cause them to leaue stealynge, then if ruffians & rubbers shoulde be sewer of their lyues, what violence, what feare were able to holde their handes frō robbynge, whiche would take the mitigacion of the punishment, as a verye peruocation to the mischiefe? Suerly my lorde (quod I) I thynke it no right nor iustice that y• losse of money should cause the losse of mans lyfe. For myne opinion is that all the goodes in the worlde are not able to counteruayle mans lyfe. But if they wold thus say: that the breaking of iustice, & the transgression of the lawes is recompensed with this punishmēt, and not the losse of the money, then why maye not thys extreame iustice wel be called extreme iniurie? For neither

For where as by the permission of GOD no man hathe power to kyll nother hym selfe, nor yet annye other man: then yf a lawe made by the consente of

And so shall it come to passe, that in lyke manner mans constitucions in al thynges shal determyne howe farre the obseruation of all Goddes commaundementes shall extende. To be shorte Moyses lawe, thoughe it were vngentle and sharpe, as a lawe that was gyuen to bondmen, yea and them verye obstinate, stubborne, and styf necked: yet it punnyshed thefte b

 newe lawe of clemencie and mercie, vnder the whiche he ruleth vs with fatherlie gentlenesse, as his dere chyldrē hath geuen vs greater scoupe & license to execute crueltie, one vpon an other. Now ye haue hard the reasons whereby, I am perswaded that this punishmēt is vnlawful. Furthermore I thinke there is no body that knoweth not, how vnresonable, yea how pernitious a thynge it is to y• weale publique, that a thefe & a homicide or morderer, shuld suffer equall and lyke punyshmēt. For the thefe seing that man, that is condempned for thefte in no lesse ieoperdie, nor iudged to no lesse punishment, then hym that is conuict of māslaughter: through thys cogitacion onlye he is stronglye and forcybly prouoked, and in a maner cōstreyned to kyl him, whom els he would haue but robbed. For the murder ones done he is in lesse care, and in more hope that the dede shall not be bewrayed or knowen, seynge the partye is nowe deade and rydde out of the waye, whyche onely myght haue vttered & disclosed it.

               ye. Therfore whyles we goo about wyth suche crueltye to make theues aferd, we prouoke thē to kyll good men. Now as touchyng this question, what punysshemente were more commodyous and better: that trulye in my iudgement is easyer to be founde, then what punysshement were wurse. For whie should we dowt that to be a good and a profytable waye for the punysshemente of offendours, whyche we knowe dydde in tymes paste so longe please the Romaynes, men in thadmynystratyon of a weale publyque moste experte polytyque and cunnyng?

No it is not to be thought that they wold make their owne countrey men and companyons of their cownsell in such a matter, whych they knowe well shoulde be ieopardye to the concelour therof, and greate commodytye and goodnes to the openner of the same: where as on the other parte, ther is none of them al hoopeles or in dyspayre to recouer agayne hys freedome, by humble obedience, by pacyent suffrynge, and by geauyng good tokens and lyklyhode of hymself, that he wyll euer after that, liue lyke a trewe and an honeste man.

Whā I had thus spoken, saynge moreouer that I coulde see no cause whie this ordre might not be had in England with much more proffyte, then the Iustyce which y• lawier so highly praised: Naye (quod the lawier) this could neuer be so stablished in England, but that it must neades bringe the weale publique into great ieopardie and hasarde.

Yea & me thinketh that thies vagaboūdes may very well be ordered after the same fassion, against whome we haue hitherto made so many lawes, & so litle preuailed.

 great solempnitie and holye ceremonies to blynde the eyes of the poore communaltie, as taking pitie and compassion God wote vpon mans bloude lyke a louing and a mercifull prince. An other putteth the kyng in remembraunce of certeyn olde and moughteeaten lawes, that of long tyme haue not bene put in execution, whiche because no man can remembre that they were made, euerie man hath transgressed. The fynes of thies lawes he coū
               selleth the kynge to require: for there is no waye so proffytable, nor more honorable, as the whiche hath a shewe and coloure of iustice. An other aduyseth hym to forbidde manye thynges vnder great penalties and fines, specially suche thynges as is for the peoples profit not be vsed, and afterward to dispence for money with thē, which by this prohibicion susteyne losse and dammage. For by this meanes the fauour of the people is wonne, and proffite riseth two wayes. First by takyng forfaytes of them whom couetousnes of gaynes hath brought in daunger of
 thys statute, and also by sellynge preuyleges and licences, whiche the better that the prynce is forsothe, the deerer he selleth them: as one that is lothe to graunte to any pryuate persone any thyng that is agaynste the proffyt of hys people. And therfore maye sell none but at an exceding dere pryce. An other giueth the kynge counsell to endaunger vnto hys grace the iudges of the Reyalme, that he maye haue them euer on hys syde, whyche muste in euerye matter despute and reason for the kynges rygth. And they muste be called into the kynges palace, & be desired to argue & discusse his matters in his owne presence. So there shalbe no matter of his so openlye wronge and vniuste, wherin one or other of them, other because he wy

 reasoning & arguing of y• which is playne enough, & bringing the manifest trewthe in dowte: in the meane season y• kyng may take a fyt occasion to vnderstād the lawe as shal most make for his aduaūtage, wher vnto al other for shame or for feare wil agree. Then the Iudges maye be bolde to pronoūce of the kynges side. For he that geueth sentēce for the kyng cānot be without a good excuse. For it shalbe sufficient for hym to haue equitie of his part, or the bar

To conclude, al the counsellours agre and consent together with the riche Crassus, that no abundāce of gold can be sufficiēt for a prince, which muste kepe and maynteyne an armie: furthermore that a kynge, thoughe he would, can do nothynge vniustly. For all that all men haue, yea also the men thē selfes be all his. And that euery mā hath somuch of his owne as y• kynges

            And that it shalbe moste for y• kynges aduauntage that his subiectes haue very lytle or nothing in their possession, as whose sauegarde dothe herein consiste, that his people do not waxe wanton and wealthie through riches and libertie, because where thies thinges be, there me

For as towchynge this, that they thinke the defence and mayntenaunce of peace to consiste in the pouertie of the people, the thyng it self sheweth that they be farre owt of the way. For where shall a mā finde more wrāgling quarelling brawling and chiding, then amōg beggers? Who be more disierous of newe mutations and alterations, then they that be not content with the present state of their lyfe? Or finally who be bolder stomaked to brynge all in hurlie burlie (therby trustyng to get sum wyndfall) then they that haue nowe nothing to leese? And if so be that there were any kyng, that were so smallye regarded, or so behated of his subiectes, that other wayes he coulde not kepe thē in awe, but onlie by opē wronges, by pollinge and shauinge, and by brynging

Of thys mynde was the hardie & couragius Fabrice, when he sayde that he had rather be a ruler of ryche men then be ryche hymselfe. And verelye one man to lyue in pleasure and wealth, whyles all other wepe and smarte for it, that is the parte not of a kynge but of a iayler. To be shorte as he is a folyshe phisition that cannot cure his patientes disease onles he caste hym in an other syckenes, so he that cannot amēd the liues of his subiectes, but be taking from them the wealth and cōmoditie of lyfe, he must nedes graunte that he knoweth not the feate how to gouerne f

 or hatered of his people. Let him lyue of hys owne, hurtinge no man. Let him do coste not aboue his power. Let hym restreyne wyckednes. Let hym preuente vices, and take a waye the occasions of offences be well orderyng hys subiectes, and not by sufferyng wickednes to increase afterward to be punyshed. Let hym not be to hastie in callynge agayne lawes, whiche a custome hathe abrogated: speciallye suche as haue bene long forgotten and neuer lacked nor neaded. And let hym neuer vnder the cloke and pretence of transgression take suche fynes and forfaytes, as no Iudge wyll suffre a priuate persone to take, as vniuste & ful of gile. Here if I should brynge furth before them the lawe of the Macariens, whiche be not farre distaūt from Vtopia: whose kynge the daye of hys coronacion is bounde by a solempne Othe, that he shall neuer at anye tyme haue in hys treasure aboue a thousande pounde of golde or syluer. They saye a verye good kynge, whiche toke more care for the wealthe & cōmoditie
 of hys countrey, then for thenrychinge of himself, made this lawe to be a stop and a barre to kynges for heaping and hording vp so muche money as might impoueryshe their people. For he forsawe that this som of treasure woulde suffice to supporte the kynge in battail against his owne people, if they shuld chaunce to rebell: and also to maintein his warres against the inuasions of hys forreyn enemies. Againe he perceiued thesame stocke of money to be to litle and vnsufficient to encourage and able hym wrong fullye to take a waye other mens goodes, whyche was the chiefe cause whie the lawe was made. An other cause was this. He thought that by thys prouisiō his people shuld not lacke money, wherewith to maynteyne their dayly occupieng and chaffayre. And seynge the kynge coulde not chewse but laye owt & bestowe all that came in aboue the prescript some of his stocke, he thought he woulde seke no occasions to doo hys subiectes iniurie. Suche a kynge shalbe feared of euell men, and loued of good men.

                  der with your selfes how great a parte of the people in other contreis lyueth ydle. First almoost all women, which be the halfe of the hole numbre: or els if the women be annye where occupied, their most comonlye in their steade the men be ydle. Besydes thys how great, and howe ydle a companye ys theyr of prystes, and relygyous men, as they call them? put there to all ryche men, speciallye all landed men, whyche comonly
 be called gentylmen, and noble men. Take into this numbre also their seruauntes. I meane all that flocke of stout bragging russhe bucklers. Ioyne to them also sturdy and valiaunt beggers, clokinge their idle leffe vnder the colour of some disease or sickenes. And truely you shall find them much fewer then you thought, by whose labour all these thynges be gotten, that men vse & lyue bye. Nowe consyder wyth youre selfe, of thies fewe that do woorke, how few be occupied in neeessary woorkes. For where money beareth all y• swing, ther many vayne and superfluous occupations must nedys be vsed, to serue only for ryotous superfluyte, and vnhonest pleasure. For the same multytude that now is occupied in woorke, if they were deuided into so few occupations, as the necessary vse of nature requyreth: in so greate plentye of thinges as then of necessity wolde ensue, doubtles the prices wolde be to lytle for the artifycers to maynteyne theyre lyuynges. But yf all thyes, that be nowe bisiede about vnprofitable occupations, with
 all the hole flocke of them that lyueydellye and slouthfullye, whyche consume and waste euerye one of them more of thies thynges that come by other mens laboure, then .ij. of the work men themselfes doo: yf all thyes (I saye) were sette to profytable occupatyons, yowe easelye perceaue howe lytle tyme wolde be enoughe, yea and to muche to stoore vs wyth all thynges that maye be requysyte other fo

                   necessytye, or for commodytye, yea or for pleasure, so that thesame pleasure be trewe and naturall. And thys in Vtopia the thynge yt selfe maketh manifeste and playne. For there in all the citye, wyth the hole contreye, or shyere adioynynge to yt, 
                     •
                  caselye .500. persons of all the hole numbre of men and women, that be nother to olde, nor to weale to woorke, be licensed from labour. Amonge them be the Siphograū
                  tes (which though they be by the lawes exemple and pryuyleged from labour) yet they exemp
                     •
                  e not themselfes: to the intent they maye the rather by their example prouoke other to woorke. The
 same vacation from labour do they also enioye, to whome the people persuaded by the commendation of the priestes and secrete election of the Siphograntes haue geuen a perpetual licence from labour to learnyng. But if anny one of them proue nott accordinge to the expectation and hoope of him conceaued, he is furth with plucked backe to the company of artificers. And contrarye wise, often yt chaunceth that a handicraftes man doth so earnestly bestowe hys vacaunte and spare houres in learninge, and through dilygence so profytte therin, that he is taken frome hys handy occupation, and promoted to the company of the learned. Owt of this ordre of the learned be chosen ambassadours, priestes, Tranibores, and finallye the prince him selfe. Whome they in their olde tonge call Barzanes, and by a newer name, Adanus. The residewe of the people being nother ydle, nother occupied about vnprofitable exercises, it may be easely iudged in how fewe howres how much good woorke by them maye be doone, towardes
 those thinges that I haue spoken of. This commodity they haue also abo
                     •
                  e other, that in the most part of necessary occupations they neade nott so muche worke, as other nations doo. For firste of all the buildinge or repayring of houses asketh euery where so manye mens continuall labour, bicause that the vnthyfty heyre suffreth the howses that hys father buylded in contynewa
                     •
                  nce of tyme to fall in decay. So that which he myghte haue vpholden wyth lytle coste, hys successoure is constreynede to buylde yt agayne a newe, to hys greate chardge. Yea manye tymes also the howse that stoode one man in muche moneye, anothere ys of so nyce and soo delycate a mynde that he settethe nothynge by yt. And yt beynge neglected, and therefore shortelye fallynge into ruyne, he buyldethe vppe anothere in an othere place wyth no lesse coste and chardge. But emonge the Vtopyans where all thynges be sett in a good ordre, and the common wealthe in a good staye, yt very seldome chaunceth, that they chuse a
 new plotte to buylde an house vpon. And they doo not only finde spedy and quicke remedies for present fautes: but also preuente them that be like to fall. And by this meanes their houses continewe and laste very longe with litle labour and small reparaciōs in so much that y• kind of woorkemen sumtimes haue almost nothinge to doo. But that they be commaunded to hewe timbre at home, and to square and trime vp stones, to the intente that if annye woorke chaūce, it may the spedelier rise. Now Syre in theire apparell marke I praye you howe few woorkemen they neade. fyrste of all whyles they be at woorke they be couered homely with leather or skinnes that will last .vij. yeares. Whē they go furthe a brode they caste vpon them a cloke, whyche hydeth the other homelye apparell. Thyes clookes thoroughe owte the hole Ilande be all of one coloure, and that is the naturall colour of y• wul. They therfor do not only spende muche lesse wullen clothe then is spente in othere contreys, but also the same standeth them in muche
 lesse coste. But lynen clothe ys made wyth lesse laboure, aud ys therefore hadde more in vse. But in lynen clothe onlye whytenese, in wullen oulye clenlynes ys regardede. As for the smalnese or fynesse of the threde, that ys no thynge passed for. And thys ys the cause wherfore in other places .iiij. or .v clothe gownes of dyuers colours, and as manye sylke cootes be not enoughe for one man. Yea and yf he be of the delycate and nyse sorte .x. be to fewe: where as there one garmente wyll serue a man mooste commenlye .ij. yeares. For whie shoulde he desyre moo? seing if he had them, he should not be the better hapt or couered frō colde, nother in his apparell any whyt the cumlyer. Wherefore, seynge they be all exercysed in profytable occupatyons, and that fewe artyfycers in thesame craftes be suffycyente, thys ys the cause that plentye of all thynges beynge emonge them, they doo sumtymes bring furthe an innumerable companye of people to amende the hyghe wayes yf annye be broken. Manye times also
 when they haue no such woorke to be occupied obout, an open proclamation is made that they shall bestowe fewer houres in woorke. For the magistrates do not exercise their citizens againste theire willes in vnneadfull laboures. For whie in the institution of that weale publique this ende is onlye and chiefely pretended and mynded, that what time maye possibly be spared frō the necessary occupations and affayres of the commen wealthe, all that the cytizeins sholde withdrawe from the bodely seruice to y• free liberty of ye mind & garnisshing of ye same. Forherin they suppose the felicity of this liffe to cōsist
            
            
               Of their lyuing and mutuall conuersatiō together
               
                  BVt now will I declare how the citizens vse thē
                  selfes one towardes another: what familiar occupieng & enterteynement there is emong ye people, and what fasion they vse in distributinge euery thynge.
 First ye city cōsisteth of families, ye families most cōmonlie be made of kinredes. For the women when they be maryed at a laufull age, they goo into their husbandes houses. But the male chyldrē, with al the hole male of spring continewe still in their owne familie, & be gouerned of the eldest and auncientest father, onles he dote for age: for then the next to hym in age, is put in his rowme. But to thi
                     •
                  tēt the prescript numbre of the citezens shoulde nether decrease, nor aboue measure increase, it is ordeined that no famylie whiche in euerye citie be .vi. thousand in the hole, besydes them of the contrey, shall at ones haue fewer chyldren of the age of .xiiij. yeares or there aboute then .x. or mo then .xvi. for of chyldren vnder thys age no numbre can be appointed. This measure or numbre is easely obserued & kept, by puttinge them that in fuller families be aboue the numbre into families of smaller increase. But if chaunce be that in the hole citie the stoore encrease aboue the iust numbre, therewith they fyll vp the lacke of
 other cityes. But if so be that the multitude throughout the hole Ilande passe and excede the dew numbre, then they chewse out of euery citie certeyn cytezens, & buylde vp a towne vnder their owne lawes in the nexte lande where the inhabitauntes haue muche waste & vnoccupied grounde, receauinge also of the inhabitaūtes to them if they wil ioyne a

                  g together, do easelye agre in one fassion of liuing, and that to the great wealth of both the peoples. For they so brynge the matter about by their lawes, that the grounde which before was nether good 
                     •
                  or profitable for the one nor for the other is nowe sufficiente and frutefull enough for them both. But if the inhabitauntes of that lande wyll not dwell with them to be ordered by their lawes, then they dryue them out of those houndes which they haue limited and apointed out for themselues. And if they resiste and rebell, then they make warre agaynst them. For they counte this the moste iust cause of warre, when any
 people holdeth a piece of grounde voyde and vacaunt to no good nor profitable vse, kepyng other from the vse and possession of it, whiche notwithstandyng by the lawe of nature ought thereof to be nowryshed & relieued. If any chaunce do so muche dimynishe the numbre of anye of their cyties that it cannot be fylled vp agayne wythout the diminishynge of the iust numbre of the other cyties (whiche they say chaunced but twyse syns the begynnynge of the lande through a greate pestilente plage) then they make vp the numbre with cytezens fetched out of their owne forreyne townes, for they hadde rather suffer theyr forreyn townes to decaye and peryshe, then annye cytie of their owne Ilande to be dimynyshed. But nowe agayne to the conuersation of the cytezens amonge themselfes. The eldeste (as I sayde) rueleth the familie. The wy

                  es bee ministers to theyr husbandes, the chyldren to theyr parentes, and to bee shorte the yonger to theyr elders. Euerye Cytie is diuided into
 foure equall partes. In the myddes of euery quarter there is a market place of all maner of thynges. Thether the workes of euery familie be brought in to certeyne houses. And euery kynde of thynge is layde vp seuerall in barnes or store houses. From hēce the father of euery famelie or euery housholder fetcheth whatsoeuer he and hys haue neade of, & carieth it awaye with hym without money, without exchaū
                  ge, without annye gage or pledge. For whye should anye thynge be denyed vnto hym: seyng there is abundaunce of all thynges, and th
                     ••
                   it is not to be feared lest anye man wyll aske more then he neadeth? For whie should it be thoughte yt that man would aske more then enough, whiche is sewer neuer to lacke? Certeynly in all kyndes of ly

 can haue no place. Next to the market places that I spake of, stonde meate markettes: whether be brought not onlye all sortes of herbes, and the fruites of trees with breade, but also fishe, and all maner of .iiij. footed beastes, and wilde foule that be mans meate. But first the fylthynes and ordure therof i

From thence the beastes brought in kylled, and cleane wasshed by the handes of their bondemen. For they permyite not their frie citezens to accustome there selfes to the killing of beastes through the vse whereof they thinke that clemencie the genteleste affection of our nature doth by litle and litle decaye and peryshe. Nother they suffer anye thynge that is fylthye lothesome or vnclenlye, to be brought into the cytie, least the ayre by the stenche therof infected and corrupte, shoulde cause pestilente diseases. Moreouer euerye strete hath certeyne great large halles sett in equal distaunce one from
 an other, euerye one knowne by a sentrall name. In thies halles dwell the Syphograuntes. And to euery one of the same halles be apoynted .xxx. families, of ether side .xv. The stewardes of euery halle at a certayn houre come in to the meate markettes, where they receyue meate accordinge to the numbre of their halles. But first and chieflie of all respect is had to the sycke, that be cured in the hospitalles. For in the circuite of the citie a litle without the walles they haue .iiij. hospitalles, so bygge so wyde so ample & so lardge that they may seme .iiij. litle townes which were deuised of y• bygnes partely to thintēt the sycke, be they neuer so many in nū

Thies holpitalles be so well apointed, & with al thynges necessary to health so furnished, & more ouer so

But they also when they be there, haue certeyne houses apointed and prepared for thē.

They syt at .iij. tables or moo, accordyng to the numbre of their company. The men syt vpon the benche next the wall, and the women agaynst them on the other syde of the table, that if anye sodeyne euell should chaunce to them, as many tymes happeneth to women with chylde, they maye ryse wythout trouble or disturbaunce of anye body, and go thence into the nurcerie: The

On both sydes of them sytte yonge men, and nexte vnto them agayne olde men. And thus throughe out all the house equall of age be sette together and yet be myxte with vnequall ages. Thys they saye was ordeyned to the intent that the sage grauitie and reuerēce of the elders should kepe the yongers from wanton licence of wordes and behauiour.

                  ger, because that after dynner followeth laboure, after supper sleape and naturall reste, whiche they thynke to be of no more strengthe and efficacy to holsome and healthfull digestion. No supper is passed without musicke. Nor their bankettes lacke no conceytes nor iouckettes. They burne swete gūmes and speces for perfumes and pleasaūt sinelles, and sprincle about swete oyntmentes and waters, yea they leaue nothyng vndone that maketh for the cheryng of the company. For they be muche enclyued to this opinion: to thinke no kynde of pleasure forbidden, wherof cummeth no harme. Thus therfore and after this sorte they lyue togethers in the citie, but in the contrey they that dwell alone farre from anye neyghbours, do dyne and suppe at home in their own houses.

As towchynge leages, which in other places betwene countrey and countrey be so ofte concluded, broken, and made agayne, they neuer make none with anye nacion.

Whyche lyke as they make no promysse themselfes but they doo verye religiouslye perfourme thesame so they exhorte all prynces in any wyse to abyde by theyre promisses, and them that refuse or denye so to do, by theire pontificall powre and aucthorytie they compell therto.

Nother they gyue deuine honours to any other then to him. Yea all the other also, though they be in diuers opinions, yet in this pointe they agree all togethers with the wisest sort in beleuynge that there is one chiefe and pryncipall God the maker and ruler of the hole worlde: whome they all commonly in theire countrey language call Mythra. But in this they disagre that amonge some he is counted one, and amonge some an other. For
 euery one of them, whatsoeuer that is whiche he taketh for the chiefe God, thynketh it to be the very same nature, to whose onlye deuyne myght and maiestie the som and soueraintie of al thinges by the consent of all people is attributed and geuen. Howe be it they al begynne by litle and litle to forsake & fall from thys varietie of superstitiōs, and to agree togethers in that religion whiche semethe by reason to passe and excell the resydewe. And it is not to be dowted but all the other would longe agoo haue bene abolyshed, but that whatsoeuer vnprosperous thynge happened to any of them as he was mynded to chaunge his religion, the fearefulnes of people dyd take it not as a thynge cummynge by chaunce, but as sente frome God owt of heauen. As thoughe the God whose honoure he was forsakynge, woulde reuenge that wicked purpose against him. But after they harde vs speake of the name of Christe, of his doctryne, lawes, myracles, and of the no lesse wonderful constancie of so manye martyrs, whose

Howe be it I thynke this was no smal healpe and furtheraunce in the matter that they harde vs saye that Christ instytuted amonge hys all thynges commen: and that thesame communitie dothe yet remayne amongest the rightest Christian companies.

But at my departure from them they hadde chosen none. They also whiche do not agree to Christes religion feare no man frome it, nor speake agaynste anye man that hath receyued it. Sauing that one of oure companye in my presence was sharpely punyshed. He as sone as he was baptised began against our willes with more earnest affection then wisdome to reason of Christes religiō
                  ▪ and began to waxe so hotte in his matter that he dyd not only preferre oure relygion before all other, but also dyd vtterlye despise an cōdempne al other, callynge them prophane, and the followers of them wicked and deuelishe, and the chyldren of euerlasting dampnation.

                  mondissention whyles euerye seuerall secte tooke seuerall parties in fyghting for theire countrey, was the only occasion of hys conquest ouer them all, assoue as he had gottē the victory: First of all he made a decrie, that it shoulde be lawfull for euery man to fauoure and followe what religion he would, and that he myght do the beste he cold to bryng other to his opinion, so that he dyd it peaceably, gentelye, quyetly,
 and soberlye, without hastye and contentious rebuking & inuehyng against other. If he coulde not by fayre & gentle speche i

                  duce them vnto his opiniō, yet he should vse no kinde of violence, and refrayne from displeasaunt & seditious woordes. To him that would vehemently and feruentlye in this cause striue & contende was decreid bannish mēt or bondage. This lawe did kynge Vtopus make not only for the maintenaūce of peace which he sawe through continuall contention & mortal hatred vtterly extinguished: but also because he thought this decrye shuld make for the furtheraunce of religion. Wherof he durst define and determine nothing vnaduisedly, as dowting whether god des

                  eryng manifolde and diuers sortes of honoure, would inspire sondrie men with sondrie kyndes of religion. And this suerly he thought a very vnmete and folishe thing, and a pointe of arrogant presumption to compell all other by violence and threatenynges to agre to thesame that thou beleuest to bee

                  urthermore though there be

At the laste the people and the priest together rehearse solempne prayers in woordes, expreslye pronounced, so made that euerye man may priuatelye applye to hymselfe that which is commonlye spoken of all. In thies prayers euerye man recogniseth and knowledgeth God to be hys maker, hys gouernoure, and the principal can se of all other goodnes, thankyng him for so many benfites receaued at hys hande. But namelye that through the fauoure of God he hath chaunced into that publyque weale, whiche is moste happye and welt bye, and hath chosen that religion whyche he hopeth to be moste true. In the whyche thynge yf he doo annye thynge erre, or yf there bee annye other better then eyther of them is, beynge moore acceptable to GOD, he desiereth hym that he wyll of hys goodnes let hym haue knowledge thereof, as one that is readye too followe what waye soeuer he wyll leade hym. But yf thys forme and fassion of a commen
 wealthe be beste, and his owne religiō moste true and perfecte, then he desyreth God to gyue hym a constaunte stedfastnes in the same, and to brynge all other people to the same ordre of lyuyng, and to the same opinion of God: onles there be any thynge that in this dyuersitie of religions doth delyte his vnsercheable pleasure. To be shorte he prayeth hym that after his deathe he may come to hym. But how soone or late that he dare not assygne or determine. Howebeit, if it myght stande with his maiesties pleasure, he would be muche gladder to dye a paynfull dethe and so to go to God, thē by long lyuing in worldlye prosperytie to bee awaye from hym. Whan this prayer is sayde they fall downe to the ground agayne, and a lytle after they ryse vp and go to dynner. And the resydewe of the daye they passe ouer in playes, and exercise of cheualrye. Nowe I haue declared and descrybyd vnto yowe, as truely as I coulde the fourme and ordre of that commen wealth, which verely in my iudgement is not onlye the

For they be not put to so contynuall laboure, nor theire lyuynge is not muche worse, yea to them much pleasaunter, takynge no thowghte in the meane season for the tyme to come. But thies seilie poore wretches be presently tormented with barreyne & vnfrutefull labour. And the remēbraunce
 of theire poore indigent and begerlye olde age kylleth them vp. For theire dayly wages is so lytle that it will not suffice for the same daye, muche lesse it yeldeth any ouerplus, that may dayly be layde vp for the relyefe of olde age. Is not thys an vniust and an vnkynd publyque weale, whyche gyueth great fees and rewardes to gentelmen as they call them, and to goldsmythes, & to suche other, whiche be other ydell persones or els onlye flatterers, and deuysers of vayne pleasures? And of the contrary parte maketh no gentle prouision for poore plowmen, coliars, laborers, carters, yronsmythes, and carpenters: without whome no commen wealth can cōtinewe? But whē it hath abused the laboures of theire lusty and flowringe age at the laste when they be oppressed with olde age and syckenes: being nedye poore and indigent of all thynges, then forgettynge theire so many paynfull watchynges, not remembrynge theire so many and so great benefytes, recompenseth and acquyteth them moste vnkyndly with myserable
 And yet besides this the riche men not only by priuate fraud, but also by commen lawes do euery day plucke & snatche away from the poore some parte of their daily liuing. So where as it semed before vniuste to recompense with vnkindnes their paynes that haue bene beneficiall to the publique weale, nowe they haue to this their wrong & vniuste dealinge (whiche is yet a muche worse pointe) geuen the name of iustice, yea & that by force of a law. Therfore whē I consider and way in my mind all thies commen wealthes which now a dayes any where do florish, so god helpeme, I can perceaue nothing but a certein conspiracy of riche men procuringe theire owne cōmodities vnder the name and title of the cōmen wealth. They inuent and deuise all meanes and craftes first how to kipe safely without feare of lesing that they haue vniustly gathered together, and next how to hire and abuse the woorke and labour of the poore for as litle money as may be. Thies deuyses when the riche men haue decreed to be kept & obserued for the cōmen wealthes
 sake, that is to saye for the wealth also of ye poore people then they be made lawes. But thies most wicked & vicious men, when they haue by their vnsatiable couetousnes deuided emōg thē selfes all those thinges which wold haue suffised all men, yet howe farre be they from the wealth and felicity of the vtopian commen wealth? Owt of the which in that all the desire of moneye with the vse therof is vtterly secluded & bannisshed, howe great a heape of cares is cut away?

                  epeth in to mens hartes: and plucketh thē backe from entering the right pathe of liffe, & is so depely roted in mens brestes that she can not be plucked out. This forme and fassion of a weale publique, which I wold gladly wisshe vnto all natiōs: I am glad yet that it hath chaūced to y• Vtopians, which haue followed those
 institutions of liffe, wherby they haue laid such fondations of their common wealth, as shall cōtinew & last not only wealthely, but also as farre as mās wit maye iudge and cōiecture shall endure for euer. For seinge the chiefe causes of ambition & sedition with other vices be plucked vp by the rootes and abandoned at home there can be no ieopardye of domesticall dissention, which alone hathe caste vnder fote and broughte to noughte the well fortefied and strongly defenced wealth and riches of many cities.

Thus whē Raphaell hadde made an ende of his tale, thoughe manye thinges came to my mind which in the manners and lawes of that people semed to be instituted & foūded of no good reasō, not only in ye fassiō of their cheualry & in their sacrifices and religions, and in other of their
 lawes, but also, yea & chieffely in that which is the pri

                  les they could find some fault in other mens inuentions: therfore I praising both their institutions and his communication, toke him by the hand and led him into supper: saying that we wold chuse an other time to way and examine the same matters, and to talke with him more at lardge therin. Whiche wold to God it might ones come to passe. In the mean
 time as I can not agree and consent to all thinges that he said, being els without dowte a man singulerly well learned, and also in all wordely matters exactely and profoundely experienced, so must I nedes confesse and graunt that many thinges be in the vtopian weal publique, which in our cities I may rather wisshe for then hoope after.
               Thus endeth the afternones talke of Raphaell Hythlodaye concerning the lawes and institutions of the Iland of Vtopia.
