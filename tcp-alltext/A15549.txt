                  A Heauy purſe makes a light heart: O the conſideration of this pouch, this pouch!
               Why hee that has money, has hearts eaſe and the world in a ſtring.
               O this red chink, and ſiluer coine, it is the conſolation of the World.
               I can ſit at home quietly in my chayre, and ſend out my angels by ſea, and by land, and bid fly villanes & fetch in ten in the hundred, I and a better penny too. Let me ſee, I haue but two children in al the world to beſtow my goods vpon, Fortunatus my ſon & Lelia my daughter. For my ſon, he followes the wars, and that which he gets with ſwaggering, he ſpendes in ſwaggering: but Ile curbe him, his allowance whileſt liue ſhall bee ſmall, and ſo hee ſhall bee ſure not to ſpend much: And if I die I will leaue him a portion, that (if he will be a good husband and follow his fathers ſteps) ſhall maintaine him like a gentleman: and if he will not, let 
                     〈…〉
                   follow his owne humor til he be weary of it, and ſo let him go: now for my daughter ſhe is my only ioy, & the ſtaff of my age, and I haue beſtowed good bringing vp vpon hir (barlady): why ſhe is een modeſty it ſelf, it does me good to look on hir. Now if I can harken out ſome wealthy mariage for hir, I haue my only deſire.
               Mas, and well remembred, heer's my neighbour Ploddall hard by, has but one only ſonne, and (let me ſee) I take it, his Lands are better than fiue thouſand pounds; now if I can make a match betweene his ſonne and my daughter, and ſo

ioine his Land and my mony together, O twil be a bleſſed vnion. Well Ile in, and get a Scriuener, Ile write, to him about it preſently: But ſtay heere come M. Churmes the Lawer, Ile deſire him to do ſo much.
            
            Enter Churms.

               O good morrow M. Churms.
               
               What ſayes my two debters, that I lent 200. pound to? wil they not pay vſe and charges of ſuit?
            
            
               Churms.
               Faith Sir I doubt they are bankrouts: I would you had your principall.
            
            
               Gripe.
               Nay Ile haue all, or Ile impriſon their bodies: But M. Churms ther is a matter I would faine haue you do, but you muſt be very ſecret.
            
            
               Churms.
               O ſir feare not that Ile warrant you.
            
            
               Gripe.
               Why then this it is: my neighbour Ploddall hereby, you know is a man of very faire Land, and hee has but one ſon, vpon whom he means to beſtow all that hee has: Now I would make a match betweene my daughter Lelia and him; what thinke you of it.
            
            
               Churms.
               Marrie I thinke twould be a good match, but the young man has had very ſimple bringing vp.
            
            
               Gripe.
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                   what care I for that? ſo he haue lands and liuing inough, my daughter has bringing vp will ſerue them both. Now I would haue you to write me a Letter to goodman Ploddall concerning this matter, and Ile pleaſe you for your paines.
            
            
               Churms.
               Ile warrant you ſir, Ile doe it artificially.
            
            
               Gripe.
               Doe, good M. Churms, but be very ſecret, I haue ſome buſineſſe this morning, and therefore Ile leaue you a while, and if you will come to dinner to mee anone, you ſhall be very heartily welcome.
            
            Exit Gripe.
            
            
               Churms.
               Thankes good ſir Ile trouble you.
               Now twere a good ieſt if I could coſen the olde Churle of his daughter, and get the wench for my ſelfe.
               Sounds I am as proper a man, as Peter Ploddall: and though his father bee as good a man as mine, yet farre fetcht and

deare bought is good for Ladies, and I am ſure I haue been as farre as Cales to fetch that I haue.
               I haue beene at Cambridge a Scholler, at Cales a Souldier, and now in the Country a Lawyer, and the next degree ſhal be a Connicatcher:
               For Ile goe neere to coſen olde father ſhare-penny of his daughter▪ Ile caſt about Ile warrant him;
               Ile go dine with him, and write him his Letter,
               And then Ile go ſeek out my kind companion Robin Goodfellow, and betwixt vs weele make hir yeeld to any thing.
               Weele ha the common law oth to hand, and the ciuilllawe oth tother:
               Weele toſſe Lelia like a tennis ball.
            
            Exit.
            Enter olde Ploddall, and his ſon Peter, an olde man Ploddals Tenant, and Wil Cricket his ſonne.
            
               Ploddall.
               Ah Tenant, an ill husband (barlady): thriſe at thy houſe and neuer at home?
               You know my minde, will you giue tenne ſhillings more rent?
               I muſt diſcharge you elſe.

               Very poore? yare a very Aſſe. Lord how my ſtomach wambles at that ſame word (very poore)! Father, if you loue your ſonne William, neuer name that ſame word very poore:
               For Ile ſtand to it, that its pettilaſſeny to name very poore to a man thats oth top of his marriage.
            
            
               Oldman.
               Why ſon, art oth top of thy marriage, to whom I prithee?
            
            
               Will.

               O tis the dapreſt wench that euer danc't after a Taberand pipe.
               For ſhee will ſo heele it, and toe it, and trip it,
               O hir buttockes will quake like a cuſtard.

               Why William, when were you with hir?
            
            
               Wil.
               O Peter does your mouth water at that?
               Truly I was neuer with hir, but I know I ſhall ſpeed.
               For tother day ſhe lookt on me and laught, and thats a good ſigne (ye know): and therefore old ſiluer top, neuer talke of charging or diſcharging.
               For I tell you I am my fathers heire: and if you diſcharge me, Ile diſcharge my peſtilence at you. For to let my houſe before my leaſe be out, is cut-throatery: and to ſcrape for more rent is polepennery.
               And ſo fare you well good Grandſire Vſury: come father lets be gone.
            
            Exeunt Wil. and his Father.

               Sophos.
               Tis then to ſhew her mutabilitie:
               But ſince amidſt ten thouſand frowning threats
               Of fickle fortunes thrice vnconſtant wheele,

               Lets do our beſt falſe Fortune to beguile,
               And take aduantage of her euer changing moodes.
               See, ſee, how Tellus ſpangled mantle ſmiles,
               And birds do chant their rurall ſugred notes
               As rauiſht with our meetings ſweet delights.
               Since then ther fits for loue both time and place:
               Let loue and liking hand in hand embrace.
            
            
               Nurſe.
               Sir the next way to win her loue, is to linger her leyſure.
               I meaſure my miſtreſſe by my louely ſelfe, make a promiſe to a man, and keep it, I haue but one fault, I neere made promiſe in my life, but I ſticke to it tooth and naile: Ile pay it home yfaith.
               If I promiſe my loue a kiſſe, Ile giue him two: marrie at firſt I will make nice, and crie fie, fie, and that will make him come againe and againe,
               Ile make him breake his winde with come againes.

               Lelia.
               Ah Sophos, that fond blind boy,
               That wrings theſe paſſions from my Sophos hart,
               Hath likewiſe wounded Lelia with his dart,
               And force perforce I yeeld the fortreſſe vp:
               Here Sophos take thy Lelias hand,
               And with this hand receiue a loyall hart.
               
                  High Ioue that ruleth heauens bright Canopie,
               Grant to our loue, a wiſht felicitie.

               My father recks not vertue,
               But vowes to wed me to a man of wealth,
               And ſweares, his gold ſhall counterpoyſe his worth;
               But Lelia ſcorn's proud Mammon's golden mines,
               And better likes of learnings ſacred lore,
               Then of fond Fortunes gliſtering mockeries:
               But Sophos trie thy wits, and vſe thy vtmoſt skill
               To pleaſe my father, and compaſſe his good will.

               To what faire Lelia wills, doth Sophos yeeld content,
               Yet thats the troublous gulfe my ſilly ſhip muſt paſſe:
               But were that venture harder to atchieue
               Then that of Iaſon for the golden fleece,
               I would effect it for ſweet Lelias ſake,
               Or leaue my ſelfe as witneſſe of my thoughts.

               Churms.
               Faith little newes: but yet I am glad I haue met with you.
               I haue a matter to impart to you, wherein you may ſtand me in ſome ſtead, and make a good benefit to yourſelfe: if we can deale cunningly, twill be worth a double fee to you, (by the Lord.)
            
            
               Robin.
               A double fee? ſpeakeman, what iſt?
               If it be to betray mine owne father, Ile doot for halfe a fee:
               And for cunning let me alone.
            
            
               Churms.
               Why, then this it is.
               Here is Maſter Gripe hard by, a Clyent of mine, a man of mightie wealth, who has but one daughter, her Dowrie is her waight in gold.
               Now Sir, this old penny father would marry her, to one Peter Ploddall, rich Ploddalls ſonne and heire.
               Whom though his father meanes to leaue verie rich,
               Yet hees a verie Idiot and Browne bread Clowne:
               
                  And one I know the wench does deadly hate,
               And though their friends haue giuen their full conſent,
               And both agreed on this vnequall match.
               Yet I know that Lelia wil neuer marrie him:
               But theres another riuall, in hir loue, one Sophos,
               
               And hees a Scholler,
               One whom I thinke faire Lelia dearely loues,
               But hir Father hates him as he hates a toad,
               For hees in want, and Gripe gapes after golde,
               And ſtill relies vpon the olde ſayd Saw;
               
                  Si nihil attuleris &c.
               
            
            
               Robin.
               And wherein can I doe you good in this?
            
            
               Churms.
               Marrie thus Sir:
               
                  I am of late growne paſſing familiar with M. Gripe,
               
               And for Ploddall he takes me for his ſecond ſelfe;
               Now Sir, Ile fit my ſelfe to the olde crummy Churls humors, and make them belieue Ile perſwade Lelia to marry Peter Ploddall, and ſo get free acceſſe to the wench at my pleaſure:
               Now oth other ſide Ile fall in with the Scholler, and him Ile handle cunningly too;
               Ile tell him that Lelia has acquainted me with hir loue to him:
               And for becauſe hir Father much ſuſpects the ſame,
               He mewes hir vp as men do mew their hawkes,
               And ſo reſtraines hir from hir Sophos ſight.
               Ile ſay, becauſe ſhe doth repoſe more truſt,
               Of ſecrecie in me, then in another man,
               In courteſie ſhe hath requeſted me,
               To do hir kindeſt greetings to hir Loue,
            
            
               Robin.
               An excellent deuiſe, yfaith.
            
            
               Churms.
               I Sir, and by this meanes, Ile make a very gull of my fine Diogenes.
               
               I ſhall knowe his ſecrets euen from the very bottome of his heart:
               Nay more Sir, you ſhall ſee me deale ſo cunningly, that he ſhall make me an inſtrument to compaſſe his deſire;
               
                  When God knowes I meane nothing leſſe.

               Make him belieue youle worke miracles,
               And that you haue a powder will make Lelia loue him.
               Nay what wil he not belieue, and take all that comes (you know my mind)
               And ſo weele make a gull of the one, and a gooſe of the other.
               And if wee can inuent any deuiſe, to bring the ſcholler in diſgrace with hir: I doe not doubt but with your helpe to creep between the bark and the tree, and get Lelia my ſelfe.
            
            
               Robin.
               Tuſh man, I haue a deuiſe in my head already to doe that:
               But they ſay hir brother Fortunatus loues him dearely.
            
            
               Churms.
               Tuthees out of the Countrey,
               He followes the drumme and the flagge.
               He may chance to be kild with a double Canon before hee come home againe:
               But whats your deuiſe?
            
            
               Robin.
               Marrie Ile do this;
               Ile frame an Inditement againſt Sophos, in manner and forme of a Rape, and the next Law day you ſhall preferre it; that ſo Lelia may loath him,
               Hir Father ſtill deadly hate him,
               And the young Gallant hir brother vtterly forſake him.
            
            
               Churms.
               But how ſhall we prooue it?
            
            
               Robin.
               Sounds weele hire ſome Strumpet or other to be ſworne againſt him.
            
            
               Churms.
               Now (by the ſubſtance of my ſoule) tis an excellent deuiſe.
               Well, lets in, Ile firſt try my cunning otherwiſe, and if all faile, weele trie this concluſion.

               Marrie Sir I heare yare a very cunning man Sir;
               And ſirreuerence of your worſhip Sir, Iam going a woeing to one M. Lelia a Gentlewoman here hard by,
               Pray ye Sir tel me how I ſhould be haue my ſelfe, to get hir to my wife.
               For Sir there is a Scholler about hir:
               Now if you can tell mee, how I ſhould wipe his noſe of hir,
               I would beſtow a fee of you.

He giues him money.
               
               Well, follow my counſaile and Ile warrant thee,
               Ile giue thee a loue powder for thy wench,
               And a kinde of Nux vomica in a potion, ſhall make hir come off yfaith.
            
            
               Peter.
               Shall I trouble you ſo farre to take ſome paines with me?
               
                  I am loth to haue the dodge▪
               
            
            
               Robin.
               Tuſh feare not the dodge;
               Ile rather put on my flaſhing red noſe, and my flaming face, and come wrapt in a Calue skin and crie bo ho:
               Ile fray the Scholler I warrant thee.
               But firſt go to hir, try what thou canſt doe,
               Perhaps ſheele loue thee without any further a doe,
               But thou muſt tell hir, thou haſt a good ſtocke, ſome 100. or 200. a yeare, & that will ſet hir hard I warrant thee.
               
                  For bith Mas, I was once in good comfort to haue coſend a Wench:
               And wots thou what I tolde hir?
               
                  I tolde hir I had a hundred pound land a yeare, in a place where I haue not the breadth of my little finger.
               
                  I promiſed hir to infeoffe hir in 40. pounds a yeare of it: & I think of my conſcience, if I had had but as good a face as thine,
               I ſhould haue made hir haue curſt the time that euer ſhe ſee mee.
               And thus muſt thou doe, cracke, and lye, and face,
               And thou ſhalt triumph mightily.
            
            
               Peter.
               I need not do ſo, for I may ſay and ſay true,
               I haue lands and liuing inough for a countrey fellow.

               Barlady ſo had not I, I was faine to ouerreach as many times I doe.
               But now experience has taught me ſo much craft, that I excell in cunning.

               Well Sir, then Ile be bold to truſt your cunning,
               And ſo Ile bid you farewell and goe forward,
               Ile too hir, thats flat.

               Gripe.
               O Mr. Sophos: I haue longd to ſpeake with you a great while,
               
                  I heare, you ſeeke my daughter Lelias loue,
               
                  I hope you will not ſeeke to dishoneſt me, nor diſgrace my daughter.
            
            
               Sophos.
               No Sir: a man may aske a yea,
               A Woman may ſay nay,
               Shee is in choice to take hir choice:
               Yet I muſt confeſſe I loue Lelia.
               
            
            
               Gripe.
               Sir I muſt be plaine with you: I like not of your loue,
               
                  Lelias mine, Ile chooſe for Lelia,
               
               And therefore I would wiſh you not to frequent my houſe any more,
               Its better for you to ply your booke, and ſeeke for ſome preferment that way, than to ſeeke for a wife before you know how to maintaine hir.
            
            
               Sophos.
               
                  I am not rich, I am not very poore,
               
                  I neither want nor euer ſhall exceede,
               The meane is my content, I liue twixt two extreames.
            
            
               Gripe.
               Well, well, I tell yee, I like not ye ſhould come to my houſe, and preſume ſo proudly to match your poore pedigree with my daughter Lelia, and therefore I charge

you to get you off of my ground: and come no more at my houſe:
               I like not this learning without liuing, I.
            
            
               Sophos.
               He needs muſt goe that the diuell driues.
               
                  Sic virtus ſine Cenſu languet.

               O Ma. Churms, cry you mercy Sir, I ſaw not you:
               
                  I think I haue ſent the ſcholler away with a flea in his eare.
               
                  I trow heele come no more at my houſe.
            
            
               Churms.
               No, for if he doe you may indite him for comming of your ground.
            
            
               Gripe.
               Wel, now Ile home, and keepe in my daughter,

               And ſo giue better fortunes to my loue.

               Faith, I haue no Mannors, but a prittie homeſtall, and we haue great ſtore of Oxen, and Horſes, and Carts, and Plowes, and houſhold ſtuffe bomination:

               I cannot liue content in diſcontent.
               For as no muſicke can delight the eares,
               Where all the parts of Diſcords are compoſed:

               That cannot bee: mine owne is neerer then my ſelfe.

               My heart would wiſh no higher to aſpire,
               Then to be grac't with Lelias loue.
               By Ieſus, I cannot play the diſſembler,
               And wooe my loue with courting ambages,
               Like one whoſe loue hangs on his ſmooth tongues ende,
               But in a word, I tell the ſumme of my deſires,
               
                  I loue faire Lelia.
               
               By her my paſſions daily are increaſ'd,
               And I muſt die, vnleſſe by Lelias loue they be releaſ'd.

               Why Maſter Churms, I had thought you had been my fathers great Counſellor in all theſe actions.

               Nay, Damne me if I be:

               Maſter Churms, you are one can doe much with her father: and if you loue her as you ſay, perſwade him to vſe her more kindly, and giue her libertie to take her choiſe, for theſe made mariages prooue not well.

               Now her friend: the next degree is Lelias loue.
               Well, Ile perſwade her father to let her haue a little more libertie.
               But ſoft: Ile none of that neither,
               So the Scholler may chance coſen me.
               Perſwade him to keepe her in ſtill:
               And before ſheele haue Peter Ploddall, ſheele haue any bodie,

and ſo I ſhal be ſure that Sophos ſhal neuer come at her.
               Why Ile warrant ye, ſheele be glad to run away with me at length.
               Hang him, that has no ſhifts.
               I promiſ'd Sophos, to further him in his ſuite:
               But if I do, Ile be peckt to death with hens.
               I ſwore to Gripe, I would perſwade Lelia, to loue Peter Ploddall.
               
               But God forgiue me, twas the furtheſt ende of my thought.
               Tut, whats an othe? euerie man for himſelfe.
               Ile ſhift for one, I warrant ye.

               Thus haue I paſt the beating billows of the ſea,
               By Ithacs rocks, and watry Neptunes bounds,
               And wafted ſafe, from Mars his bloudie fields
               Where trumpets ſound Tantara to the fight,
               And here arriu'd for to repoſe my ſelfe,
               Vpon the borders of my natiue ſoyle.
               Now Fortunatus bend thy happie courſe,
               Vnto thy fathers houſe, to greet thy deareſt friends.
               And if that ſtill thy aged ſire ſuruiue
               Thy preſence wil reuiue his drouping ſprites,
               And cauſe his withered cheekes bee ſprent with youthfull bloud,
               Where death of late was portraid to the quicke.
               But ſoft, who comes here?

            Enter Robin Goodfellow.
            
            
               Robin.
               I wonder I heare not of Maſter Churms,
               
               I would faine know how he ſpeedes,
               And what ſucceſſe he has in Lelias loue:
               Well, if he couſen the Scholler of her,
               Twould make my worſhip laugh:
               And if he haue her, hee may ſay god a mercy Robin Goodfellow.
               
               O ware a good head as long as you liue.
               Why, Maſter Gripe he caſts beyond the moone,
               
                  And Churms is the only man, he puts in truſt with his daughter, and (Ile warrant) the old Churle would take it vpon his ſaluation, that he wil perſwade her to marry Peter Ploddall:
               
               But Ile make a foole of Peter Ploddall,
               
               Ile looke him ith face and picke his purſe,
               Whil'ſt Churms coſen him of his wench,
               And my old gandſir Holdfaſt of his daughter.
               And if he can do ſo:
               Ile teach him a tricke to coſen him of his gold too.
               Now for Sophos, let him weare the willow garland,
               And play the melancholie Malecontent
               And plucke his hat downe in his ſullen eyes,
               And thinke on Lelia, in theſe deſert groues:
               Tis ynough for him to haue her, in his thoughts;
               Although he nere imbrace her in his armes.
               But now, theres a fine deuiſe comes in my head,
               To ſcarre the Scholler:
               You ſhall ſee, Ile make fine ſport with him.
               They ſay, that euery day he keepes his walke
               Amongſt theſe woods and melancholy ſhades,
               And on the barke of euerie ſenſeleſſe tree
               In graues the tenour of his haples hope.
               Now when hees at Venus altar at his Oriſons;
               Ile put me on my great carnation noſe
               And wrap me in a rowſing Calueskin ſuite,
               And come like ſome Hob goblin or ſome diuell,
               Aſcended from the griefly pit of hell:
               And like a Scarbabe make him take his legges:
               Ile play the diuel, I warrant ye.

               Well: I ſee that Churmes muſt be the man muſt carrie Lelia when alls done.

               Churms.
               What fellow Robin, how goes the ſquares with you?
               Yare waxen very proude alate, you will not know your olde friends.
            
            
               Robin.
               Faith I eene came to ſeeke you, to beſtow a quart of wine of you.
            
            
               Churms.
               Thats ſtrange: you were nere wont to be ſo liberall.
            
            
               Robin.
               Tuſh man, one good turne askes another: cleare gaines man, cleare gaines:
               
                  Peter Ploddall ſhall pay for all: I haue guld him once,
               And Ile come ouer him againe and againe, I warrant ye.

               Robin.
               O all the better: then I ſhall bee ſure of more of his cuſtome.
               But what ſucceſſe haue you in your ſuit with hir?

               Faith all hitherto goes well,
               
                  I haue made the motion to hir,
               But as yet we are growne to no concluſion:
               But I am in very good hope.
            
            
               Robin.
               But doe you thinke you ſhall get hir fathers good will?
            
            
               Churmes.
               Tut, if I get the wench I care not for that:
               
                  That will come afterward:
               And Ile be ſure of ſomething in the meane time.
               For I haue outlaw'd a great number of his debtors,
               And Ile gather vp what money I can amongſt them,
               And Gripe ſhall nere know of it neither.
            
            
               Robin.

               Take the one halfe and forgiue them the other, rather then ſit out at all.

               Tuſh let me alone for that:
               But ſirra I haue brought the Scholler into a fooles Paradiſe:
               Why he has made me his ſpokeſman to M. Lelia,

               Robin.
               O bith Mas well remembred,

               Churms.
               I would thou couldſt ſcarre him out of his wits:

               I doubt no body but him.

               Well, lets go drinke together;

               But ſtay: here comes Lelias Nurſe.
            
            Enter Nurſe.
            
               Sophos.
               
                  Nurſe, what newes?
               How fares my loue?
            
            
               Nurſe.
               How fares ſhee quotha? Marrie ſhee may fare how ſhe will for you: Neither come to her, nor ſend to her of a whole fortnight?
               Now I ſweare by my maydenhead, if my husband ſhould haue ſeru'd me ſo, when hee came a wooing to me: I would neuer haue lookt on him with a good face as long as I had liued.
               But he was as kind a wretch, as euer laid lips of a woman: He would ha come through windowes or doores, or wals, or any thing, but he would haue come to me.
               Marrie, after we had beene maried a while, his kindneſſe began to ſlake, for Ile tell you what hee did:
               He made me beleeue, he would go to greene gooſe faire, and Ile

               And her father oth tother ſide, he yoles at her, and ioles at her: and ſhee leades ſuch a life for you it paſſes, and yoole neither come to her, nor ſend to her:
               Why, ſhee thinkes you haue forgotten her.
            
            
               Sophos.
               Nay, then let heauens in ſorrow end my dayes
               And fatall Fortune neuer ceaſe to frowne,
               And heauen and earth, and all conſpire to pull me downe,
               If blacke obliuion ſeiſe vpon my heart
               Once to eſtrange my thoughts from Lelias loue.
            
            Sophos,
            
               Fortunatus.
               Why Nurſe, I am ſure that Lelia heares from
               Once a day at leaſt by Churms the Lawyer,
               Who is his onely friend.
            
            
               Nurſe.
               What, yong Maſter? God bleſſe mine eye ſight:
               
                  Now by my maydenhead yare welcome home,
               I am ſure my Miſtreſſe will be glad to ſee you.
               But what ſaid you of Maſter Churms?

               Marrie, I ſay hees a well willer to my ſiſter Lelia,

               Nurſe.
               Marrie the Diuel he is: truſt him and hang him. Why, hee cannot ſpeake a good worde on him to my olde Maſter, and he does ſo ruffle before my Miſtreſſe with his barbarian eloquence, and ſtrut before her in a paire of Polonian legges, as if hee were gentleman Vſher to the great Turke, or the Diuell of Dowgate:
               
               And if my Miſtreſſe would be rul'd by him, Sophos might go ſnick vp: But he has ſuch a buttermilke face, that ſhoole neuer haue him.

               Faith not well.
            
            
               Nurſe.
               Why Sir, hee lookes like a red herring at a Noble mans table on Eaſter day, and he ſpeakes nothing but Almond butter and ſuger Candie.

               Wherein a man, as in a Map man ſee

               No Ile not ſtay, Ile goe call the clearke,
               Ile be cried out vpon ith Church preſently,
               What ho? What Clearke I ſay? where are you?
            
            Enter Cleark.
            
            
               
               Clearke.
               Who cals me? what would you with me?
               Marrie Sir, I would haue you to make proclamation, that if any manner of man, oth Towne, or oth Country, can lay any claime to Pegge Pudding, let him bring worde to the Crier, or elſe William Cricket will wipe his noſe of her.
            
            
               Clearke.
               You meane you would be askt ith Church?
            
            
               Will.
               I thats it: a bots ont, I cannot hit of theſe marrying tearmes yet.
               And Ile deſire my Landlord here and his ſonne, to be at the Celebrauation of my marriage too:
               Yfaith Peter, you ſhal cramme your guts ful of Cheeſecakes and Cuſtards there.
               And ſirra Clearke, if thou wilt ſay Amen ſtoutly:
               Yfaith my powder beefe ſlaue,
               Ile haue a rumpe of beefe for thee, ſhal make thy mouth 
                     〈…〉
                   
                  
                     ••
                  de.
            
            
               Clearke.
               When would you haue it done?
            
            
               Will.
               Marrie eene as ſoone as may be: let me ſee:
               I wil be askt ith Church of Sunday at morning prayer, and againe at Euening prayer: & the next holiday that comes I will be askt ith forenoone, and married ith afternoone: For (do you marke) I am none of theſe ſneaking fellowes that wil ſtand thrumming of Caps, and ſtudying vppon a matter, as long as Hunkes with the great head has beene about to ſhow his little wit in the ſecond part of his paultrie poetrie: but if I begin with wooing, Ile ende with wedding.
               And therefore good Clearke, let me haue it done with all ſpeede: for I promiſe you, I am verie ſharpe ſet.
            
            
               Cleark.
               Faith you may be askt ith Church on Sunday at morning prayer, but Sir Iohn cannot tend to do it at Euening prayer: For there comes a Company of Players tuth Towne, on Sunday ith after noone; and Sir Iohn is ſo good a fellow, that I know heele ſcarce leaue their companie, to ſay Euening prayer.
               For (though I ſay it) hees a verie paineful man, and takes ſo great delight in that facultie, that heele take as great paine about

building of a Stage or ſo, as the baſeſtfellow among them.
            
            
               Will.
               Nay, if he haue ſo lawfull an excuſe, I am content to deferre it one day the longer:
               And Landlord, I hope, you and your ſonne Peter wil make bold with vs, and trouble vs.
            
            
               Ploddall.
               Nay William, we would be loath to trouble you: but you ſhal haue our companie there.
            
            
               Will.
               Faith you ſhal be very heartily welcome, and wee wil haue good merry rogues there that wil make you laugh till you burſt.
            
            
               Peter.
               Why William, what company doe you meane to haue?
            
            
               Will.
               Marrie, firſt and for moſt, there wil bee an honeſt Dutch Cobbler, that wil ſing (I wil noe meare to Burgaine goe) the beſt that euer you heard.
            
            
               Ploddall.
               What, muſt a Cobbler be your chiefe gueſt? Why hees a baſefellow.
            
            
               Will.
               A baſefellow? you may be aſham'd to ſay ſo,
               For hees an honeſtfellow, and a goodfellow:
               And he begins to carrie the verie badge of good fellowſhip vpon his noſe; that I do not doubt, but in time he wil prooue as good a Copper companion as Robin Goodfellowe himſelfe.
               I and hees a tallfellow, and a man of his hands too,
               For Ile tel you what: tie him tuth Bull-Ring, and for a bagpudding, a Cuſtard, a Cheeſcake, a hogges cheeke, or a Calues head, turne any man ith towne to him; and if he do not prooue himſelfe as tall a man as he, let blind Hugh bewitch him, and tourne his bodie, into a barrel of ſtrong Ale, and let his noſe be the Spigat, his mouth the Foſſet, and his tongue a Plugge for the bunge hole.
               And then there wil be Robin Goodfellow, as good a drunken rogue as liues: and Tom Shoomaker; and I hope you wil not deny that hees an honeſt man, for hee was Conſtable oth Towne.
               And a number of other honeſt raſcals, which though they

are growne bankroutes and liue by the reuerſion of other mens tables:
               Yet (thankes bee to God) they haue a penny amongſt, at all times at their neede.
            
            
               Ploddall.
               Nay, if Robin Goodfellow be there, you ſhall be ſure to haue our company.
               For hees one that we heare very well of;
               And my ſonne here has ſome occaſion to vſe him:
               And therefore if we may know when tis, weele make bolde to trouble you.
            
            
               Will.
               Yes Ile ſend you word.
            
            
               Ploddall.
               Why then farewell, till wee heare from you.
            
            Exeunt Ploddall and his ſonne.
            
               Wil.
               Wel Cleark, youle ſee this matter brauely performed: let it be done as it ſhould be.
            
            
               Clearke.
               Ile warrant ye, feare it not.
            
            
               Will.
               Why then go you to Sir Ihon, and Ile to my wench, and bid hir giue hir Maidenhead warning to prepare itſelf▪ for the deſtruction of it is at hand.
            
            Exeunt.
            Enter Lelia, Sola.
            
            
               Lelia.
               How loue and fortune both with eger moode,
               Like greedy hounds do hunt my tired hart,
               Rows'd forth the thickets of my wonted ioyes!
               And Cupid windes his ſhrill note bugle horne,
               For ioy my ſilly hart ſo neere is ſpent.
               Deſire that eager Curre purſues the chace,
               And Fortune rides amaine vnto the fall:
               Now ſorrow ſings, and mourning beares a part,
               Playing harſh deſcant on my yeelding heart.
               Enter Nurſe.
               
               Nurſe, what newes?
            
            
               Nurſe.
               Faith a whole ſackefull of newes:
               You loue Sophos and Sophos loues you;
               And Peter Ploddall loues you, and you loue not him,
               And you loue not Maſter Churmes, and he loues you,
               
                  And ſo heers loue and no loue,
               And I loue and I loue not,
               And I cannot tell what:
               But of all, and of all, Maſter Churmes muſt bee the man you muſt loue.
            
            
               Lelia.
               Nay, firſt Ile mount me on the winged wind,
               And fly for ſuccour to the fartheſt Inde.
               
               Muſt I loue Maſter Churmes?
               
            
            
               Nurſe,
               Faith you muſt and you muſt not.
            
            
               Lelia.
               As how I pray thee?
            
            
               Nurſe.
               Marry I haue commendations to you.
            
            
               Lelia.
               From whom?
            
            
               Nurſe.
               From your brother Fortunatus.
               
            
            
               Lelia.
               My brother Fortunatus?
               
            
            
               Nurſe.
               No: from Sophos.
               
            
            
               Lelia.
               From my Loue?
            
            
               Nurſe.
               No from neither.
            
            
               Lelia.
               From neither?
            
            
               Nurſe.
               Yes from both.
            
            
               Lelia.
               Prithee leaue thy foolery, and let me knowe thy newes.
            
            
               Nurſe.
               Your brother Fortunatus, and your loue, to morrow night will meet you by the forreſt ſide,
               There to conferre about I knowe not what:
               But tis like, that Sophos will make you of his priuy councell, before you come againe.
            
            
               Lelia.
               Is Fortunatus then retourned from the warres?
            
            
               Nurſe.
               He is with Sophos euery day,
               But in any caſe you muſt not let your Father know,
               For he hath ſworne he will not be diſcried,
               Vntill he haue effected your deſires:
               For he ſwaggers and ſweares out of all crie,
               That he will venture all,
               Both fame and bloud, and limme and life,
               But Lelia ſhall be Sophos wedded wife.
            
            
               Lelia
               Alas Nurſe, my fathers iealous braine
               Doth ſcarce allow me once a month to goe,
               
                  Beyond the compaſſe of his watchfull eyes,
               Nor once affords me any conference,
               With any man except with Mr. Churms,
               
               Whoſe craftie braine beguiles my father ſo,
               That he repoſeth truſt in none but him:
               And though he ſeekes for fauour at my hands,
               He takes his marke amiſſe and ſhootes awrie.
               For I had rather ſee the diuel himſelfe,
               Then Churms the Lawyer:
               Therefore how I ſhould meete them by the forreſt ſide,
               I cannot poſſibly deuiſe.
            
            
               Nurſe.
               And Maſter Churms muſt be the man muſt work the meanes,
               You muſt this night ſend for him:
               Make him beleeue you loue him mightily,
               Tell him you haue a ſecret friend dwels farre away beyond the Forreſt.
               To whom if he can ſecretly conuay you from your father,
               Tel him you wil loue him, better then euer God loued him.
               And when you come to the place appointed,
               Let them alone to diſcharge the knaue of clubs.
               And that you muſt not faile,
               Here receiue this ring, which Fortunatus ſent you for 
                     •
                   
                  
                     •
                  oken,
               That this is the plot that you muſt proſecute,
               And this from Sophos as his true loues pledge.
            
            
               Lelia.
               This ring my brother ſent I know right well,
               But this my true loue pledge I more eſteeme
               Then all the golden mines the ſolide earth containes:
               And ſee, in happy time here comes M. Churms:
                  Enter Chur.
                  
               
               Now loue and fortune both conſpire,
               And ſort their driftes to compaſſe my deſire.
               M. Churms yare well met, I am glad to ſee you.
            
            
               Churms.
               And I as glad to ſee faire Lelia,
               
               As euer Paris was to ſee his deare,
               For whom ſo many Troianes bloud was ſpilt;
               Nor thinke, I would do leſſe then ſpend my deareſt bloud,
               
                  To gaine faire Lelias loue, although by loſſe of life.
            
            
               Nurſe.
               Faith miſtreſſe, he ſpeakes like a gentleman:
               Let me perſwade you,
               Be not hard hearted:
               
                  Sophos? why whats hee?
               If hee had lou'd you but halfe ſo well, he would ha come through ſtone walles, but he would haue come to you ere this.
            
            
               Lelia.
               I muſt confeſſe, I once lou'd Sophos well,
               But now I cannot loue him, whom all the world knowes to be a diſſembler.
            
            
               Churmes.
               Ere I would wrong my loue with one dayes abſence;
               I would paſſe the boyling Helleſpont,
               
               As once Leander did for Heroes loue,
               Or vndertake a greater taske then that,
               Ere I would be diſloyall to my Loue.
               And if that Lelia giue hir free conſent
               That both our loues may ſympathize in one,
               My hand, my heart, my loue, my life and all,
               Shall euer tend on Lelias faire command.
            
            
               Lelia.
               Mr. Churms, mee thinkes tis ſtrange, you ſhould make ſuch a motion:
               Say I ſhould yeeld, and grant you loue;
               When moſt you did expect a ſunneſhine day,
               My fathers will would mar your hop't for hay,
               And when you thought to reap the fruits of loue,
               His hard conſtraint would blaſt it in the bloom.
               For he ſo do
                     •
                  es on Peter Ploddals pelfe,
               That none but he forſooth muſt be the man,
               And I will rather match my ſelfe,
               Vnto a groome of Plutoes grieſly denne,
               Then vnto ſuch a ſilly golden aſſe.
            
            
               Churms.
               Brauely reſolued yfaith.
            
            
               Lelia.
               But to be ſhort:
               I haue a ſecret friend that dwels from hence,
               Some two dayes iourney, thats the moſt,
               
                  And if you can, as (wel I know) you may, conuay me thither ſecretly:
               For company I deſire no other then your owne,
               Here take my hand:
               That once perform'd my heart is next.
            
            
               Churmes.
               If on th'aduenture all the dangers lay,
               That Europe or the weſterne world affords,
               Were it to combate Cerberus himſelfe,
               Or ſcale the braſen walles of Plutoes court;
               When as there is ſo faire a prize propos'd,
               If I ſhrinke backe or leaue it vnperform'd,
               Let the World canonize me for a Coward:
               Appoint the time and leaue the reſt to me.

               When nights blacke mantle ouerſpreads the sky,
               And dayes bright lampe is drenched in the weſt,
               To morrow night I thinke the fitteſt time,
               That ſilent ſhade may giue our ſafe conuoy,
               Vnto our wiſhed hopes vnſeene of liuing eye.

               And at that time I will not faile,

               But what if Sophos ſhould meet you by the forreſt fide:
               And in counter you with his ſingle rapier?
            
            
               Churms.
               
                  Sophos? a hop of my thumbe, a wretch, a wretch.
               Shoulde Sophos meete vs there accompanied with ſome Champion,
               With whome twere any credit to encounter,
               Were he as ſtout as Hercules himſelfe,
               Then would I buckle with them hand to hand:
               And bandy blowes as thicke as haileſtones fall,
               And carrie Lelia away in ſpite of all their force.
               What? loue will make Cowards fight:
               Much more a man of my reſolution.
            
            
               Lelia.
               And on your reſolution Ile depend,
               Vntill to morrow at th'appointed time, when I looke for you:
               till when Ile leaue you, and go make preparation for our

iourney.

               Farewell faire loue, vntill we meet againe.
               Why ſo: did I not tel you ſhe would be glad to run away with mee at length?
               Why this falles out, een as a man would ſay, Thus I would haue it.
               But now I muſt go caſt about for ſome money too,
               Let mee ſee: I haue outlaw'd three or foure of Gripes debters.
               And I haue the bonds in mine owne hands:
               The ſumme that is due to him, is ſome two or three hundred pounds:
               Well, Ile to them: if I can get but one halfe,
               Ile deliuer them their bonds, and leaue the other halfe to their owne conſciences; and ſo I ſhall be ſure to get mony to beare charges:
               When all failes wel fare a good wit.
               But ſoft, no more of that:
               Here comes Mr. Gripe,
               
            
            Enter Gripe.

               Churms.
               Faith Sir, reaſonable well: I am eene walking here to take the freſh ayre.
            
            
               Gripe.
               Tis very holeſome this faire weather,
               But M. Churms: how like you my daughter?
               Can you doe any good on hir? wil ſhe be rul'd yet?
               How ſtands ſhe affected to P. Ploddall?
               
            
            
               Churms.
               O very well Sir: I have made hir very conformable.

               Gripe.
               Maſter Churmes. I am ſo exceedingly beholding to you,
               I cannot tell how I ſhall requite your kindneſſe,

               This newes has eene lightned my heart,

               Granam, giue me but two crownes of red golde,
               And Ile giue you two pence of white ſiluer,
               If Robin the diuel be not a water witch.

               Vpon the morrow after the bleſſed newe yeare,
               I came trip, trip, trip, ouer the Market hil,
               Holding vp my petticote to the calues of my legs,
               To ſhow my fine coloured ſtockins,
               And how finely I coulde foote it in a paire of newe corkt ſhooes, I had bought:
               And there I ſpyed this Mounſier Muffe, lie gaping vp into the skies,
               To know how many Maides would be with childe in the towne all the yeare after:
               O tis a baſe vexation ſlaue,
               How the country talkes of the large ribd varlet!
            
            
               Mother M.
               Marry out vpon him: what a Friday fac't ſlaue it is!
               I thinke in my conſcience, his face neuer keepes Holiday▪
               
            
            
               Pegge.
               Why his face can neuer be at quiet,
               He has ſuch a cholerick noſe,
               I durſt haſworne by my maiden-head,
               (God forgiue me that I ſhould take ſuch an oath▪

            Enter Will. Cricket.

               Why William, we are talking of Rob Goodfellow:

               Will.
               Marrie I ſay he lookes like a tankerd bearer,
               That dwels in Petticoate lane, at the ſigne of the Mearemaide;
               And I ſweare by the bloud of my codpiece,
               An I were a woman I would lug off his laue eares,
               Or run him to death with a ſpit: and for his face,
               I thinke tis pittie there is not a lawe made,
               That it ſhould be fellonie to name it in any other places,
               then in baudie houſes:

               Marrie I wil giue Pegge a pot and a pan,

               I trow ſheele prooue a good huswife,
               And loue hir husband well too.

               If ſhe loue me Ile loue hir, yfaith my ſweet honny combe, Ile loue thee,

               Come Pegge lets hie vs home, weele make a bag-pudding to ſupper▪
               
               And William ſhall go and ſup with vs.
            
            
               Will.
               Come on yfaith.
            
            Exeunt.
            Enter Fortunatus and Sophos.
            
            
               Fort.
               Why how now Sophos, al a mort? ſtil languiſhing in loue?
               Wil not the preſense of thy friend preuaile?
               Nor hope expell theſe ſullen fits?
               Cannot mirth wring, if but a forged ſmile,
               From thoſe ſad drouping lookes of thine?
               
                  Relye on hope, whoſe hap wil lead thee right,
               To her, whom thou doſt call thy hearts delight;
               Looke cheerely man: the time is neere at hand,
               That Hymen mounted on a ſnow white coach,
               Shal tend on Sophos and his louely bride.
            
            
               Sophos.
               Tis impoſſible: her Father, man, her father,
               Hees al for Peter Ploddall.
               
            
            
               Fortunatus.
               Should I but ſee that Ploddall offer loue,
               This ſword ſhould pearce the peſants breaſt,
               And chaſe his ſoule from his accurſed corps
               By an vnwonted way vnto the grieſly lake.
               But now the appointed time is neere,
               That Churms ſhould come with his ſuppoſed loue:
               Then ſit we down vnder theſe leauie ſhades
They ſit down.
               
               And waight the time of Lelias wiſht approach.
            
            
               Sophos.
               I: here Ile waight for Lelias wiſht approach,
               More wiſht to me, then is a calme at ſeas,
               To ſhipwrackt ſoules, when great God Neptune frownes.
               Though ſad deſpaire hath almoſt drown'd my hopes;
               Yet would I paſſe the burning vaults of Orke,
               
               As erſt did Hercules to fetch his loue,
               If I might meete my loue vpon the ſtrond
Enter Robin Goodfellow.
                  
               
               And but enioy her loue one minute of an hour.
               But ſtay: what man, or diuell, or helliſh fiendcomes here,
               Tranſformed in this ougly vncouth ſhape?

               O, peace a while: you ſhal ſee good ſport anone.
            
            
               Robin.
               Now I am cloathed in this helliſh ſhape,
               If I could meete with Sophos in theſe woods,
               O, he would take me for the Diuell himſelfe,
               I ſhould ha good laughing, beſide the fortie ſhillings

                  Ploddall has giuen mee: and if I get noe more I am ſure of that.
               But ſoft: now I muſt trie my cunning, for here he ſits.

               O I wil Sit:
               Although in ſome places, I beare the title of a ſcuruy gentleman:
               By birth I am a boate writes ſon of Hull,
               
               My father got me of a refuſ'd hagge,
               Vnder the olde ruines of Boobies barne,
               Who as ſhe liu'd, at length ſhe likewiſe died,
               And for her good deedes went vnto the Diuell.
               But, Hell not wont to harbour ſuch a gueſt,
               Her fellow fiends do daiely make complaint
               
                  Vnto grim Pluto, and his louely Queene,
               Of her vnruly miſſebehauiour:
               Intreating that a paſport might be drawne
               For her to wander till the day of doome,
               On earth againe to vex the mindes of men,
               And ſwore ſhe was the fitteſt fiend in Hell
               To driue men to deſperation.
               To this intent her paſport ſtraight was drawne,
               And in a whirle wind forth of Hell ſhe came;
               Ore hills ſhe hurles, and ſcowres along the plaines:
               The trees flew vp bith rootes, the earth did quake for feare,
               The houſes tumble downe, ſhe playes the Diuell and all:
               At length not finding any one ſo fit
               To effect her diueliſh damned charge as I:
               She comes to me, as to her onely childe,
               And me her inſtrument on earth ſhe made,
               And by that meanes I learnd this diuelliſh trade.

               Faith Sir, I am in a manner a promoter,
               Or more fitly term'd a promoting knaue:
               I creepe into the preſence of great men,
               And vnder colour of their friendſhips,
               Effect ſuch wonders in the world
               That babes wil curſe me, that are yet vnborne.
               Of the beſt men, I raiſe a common fame,
               And honeſt women rob of their good name:
               Thus dayly tumbling-in comes all my thrift.
               That I get beſt is got but by a ſhift:
               But the chiefe courſe of all my life,
               Is to ſet diſcord betwixt man and wife.

               Tis not poſſible: nere tell me. I dare truſt Maſter Churms with a greater matter then that.

               Faith you muſt truſt him whether you will or no, for hees gone.

               M. Gripe, I was comming to deſire that I might haue your abſence at my wedding: for I heare ſay you are very liberall growen alate.
               For I ſpake with three or foure of your debters this morning▪
               
               that ought you hundred pounds a piece:
               And they tolde me, that you ſent M. Churmes to them and tooke of ſome ten pounds,
               And of ſome twentie, and deliuered them their bondes,
               And bad them pay the reſt when they were able.
            
            
               Gripe.
               I am vndon: I am robd: my daughter▪ my mony!
               Which way are they gone?

               Faith Sir, its all to nothing but your daughter and
               M. Churms are gone both one way:
               Marrie your mony flies ſome one waies and ſome another:
               And therefore tis but a folly to make hue and crie after it.
            
            
               Gripe.
               Follow them: make hue and cry after them.
               My daughter, my mony, alls gone, what ſhall I doe?

                  (Marke what I ſay) for Ile teach you the way to come to heauen, if you ſtumble not:
               Giue all you haue to the poore,
               But one ſingle penny, and with that penny buy you a good ſtrong halter,
               And when you ha done ſo: come to mee and Ile tell you what you ſhall do with it.
            
            
               Gripe.
               Bring me my daughter: that Churms, that villane,
               Ile teare him with my teeth.
            
            
               Nurſe.
               Maſter, nay pray you do not run mad:
               Ile tell you good newes:
               My young Maſter Fortunatus is come home: and ſee where he comes.
            
            Enter Fortunatus.
            
            
               Gripe.
               If thou hadſt ſayd Lelia, it had beene ſomething.
            
            
               Fort.
               Thus Fortunatus greetes his Father,
               And craues his bleſſing on his bended knee.
            
            
               Gripe.
               I, heers my ſonne: but Lelia ſheele not come.
               Good Fortunatus riſe: wilt thou ſhed teares,
               And help thy father mone?
               If ſo, ſay I: if not good ſonne be gone.

               Faith Sir, hees almoſt mad: I thinke he cannot tell you:
               And therefore I preſuming Sir, that my wit is ſomething better than his, at this time (do you marke Sir?)
               Out of the profound circumambulation of my ſupernaturall wit Sir (do you vnderſtand?)
               Will tel you the whole ſuperfluity of the matter Sir:
               Your ſiſter Leli

               Fort.
               Well, and what of that?
            
            
               Will.
               Nay nothing Sir, but ſhee fell in loue with one Sophos a very proper wiſe young man Sir:
               Now Sir, your Father would not let hir haue him, Sir:
               But would haue married hir to one Sir,
               That would haue fed hir with nothing but barly bag puddings and fat bacon:
               
                  Now Sir to tell you the truth,
               The foole ye know has fortune to land:
               But M. Lelias mouth doth not hang for that kind of dyet.
            
            
               Fort.
               And how then?
            
            
               VVill.
               Marrie then there was a certaine craking, cogging, pettifogging, buttermilke ſlaue Sir, one Churms Sir, that is the very quinteſſence of all the knaues in the bunch; And if the beſt man of all his kin had been but ſo good as a yeoman mans ſonne:
               He ſhould haue been a markt knaue by letters patents,
               And hee Sir comes me ſneaking, and coſens them both of their wench, and is run away with hir:
               And Sir belike hee has coſend your father heere of a great deale of his mony too.
            
            
               Nurſe.
               Sir your father did truſt him but too much;
               But I alwaies thought he would prooue a crafty knaue.
            
            
               Gripe.
               My truſts betrai'd, my ioyes exil'd:
               Griefe kils his heart, my hopes beguil'd,
            
            
               Fort.
               Whtere golden gaine doth bleare a fathers eyes,
               That pretious pearle fetcht from Pernaſſus mount,
               Is counted refuſe, worſe then Bullen braſſe;
               Both ioyes and hope hang of a ſilly twine,
               That ſtill is ſubiect vnto flitting time:
               That tournes ioy into griefe, and hope to ſad deſpaire,
               And ends his dayes in wretched worldly care.
               Were I the richeſt Monarch vnder heauen,
               And had one daughter thrice as faire,
               As was the Grecian Menelaus wife,
               Ere I would match hir to an vntaught ſwaine,
               Though one whoſe wealth exceeded Croeſus ſtore,
               Hir ſelfe ſhould chooſe, and I applaud hir choiſe,
               Of one more poore then euer Sophos was,
               Were his deſerts but equall vnto his.
               If I might ſpeake without offence;
               You were to blame to hinder Lelias choice.
               As ſhe in Natures graces doth excell:
               So doth Minerua grace him full as well.
            
            
               
               Nurſe.
               Now, by cocke and pie, you neuer ſpoke a truer word in your life, hees a very kind gentleman:
               For laſt time he was at our houſe he gaue me three pence.
            
            
               Will.
               O nobly ſpoken: God ſend Pegge to prooue as wiſe a woman as hir Mother, and then we ſhall be ſure to haue wiſe children.
               Nay if he be ſo liberall: olde Granſire you ſhall giue him the good-will of your daughter.
            
            
               Gripe.
               She is not mine: I haue no daughter now.
               That I ſhould ſay I had, thence comes my griefe:
               My care of Lelia, paſt a fathers loue,
               My loue of Lelia makes my loſſe the more.
               My loſſe of Lelia drowns my heart in woe:
               My hearts woe makes this life a liuing death:
               Care, Loue, Loſſe, Hearts-woe, liuing death,
               Ioyne all in one, to ſtop this vitall breath.
               Curſt be the time I gap't for golden gaine,
               I curſe the time, I croſt hir in hir choice.
               Hir choyce was virtuous, but my wil was baſe,
               I ſought to grace hir from the Indian Mines,
               But ſhe ſought honour from the ſtarrie Mount:
               What franticke fit poſſeſt my fooliſh braine?
               What furious fancie fired ſo my heart,
               To hate faire Virtue and to ſcorne deſert?
            
            
               Fortunatus.
               Then father giue deſert his due,
               Let Natures graces and faire virtues giftes,
               One ſympathie and happy conſort make,
               Twixt Sophos and my ſiſter Lelias loue:
               Conioyne their hands, whoſe hearts haue long beene one,
               And ſo conclude a happy vnion.
            
            
               Gripe.
               Now tis too late:
               What Fates decree, can neuer be recall'd:
               Hir luckleſſe loue is fall'n to Churms his lot,
               And he vſurps faire Lelias nuptiall bed.
            
            
               Fortunatus.
               That cannot be: feare of purſuit muſt needes▪ prolong his nuptiall rights.
               But if you giue your full conſent,
               
                  That Sophos may enioy his long wiſht loue,
               And haue faire Lelia to his louely bride,
               Ile follow Churmes what ere betide.
               Ile be as ſwifte as is the light foote Roe,
               And ouertake him ere his iournies end:
               And bring faire Lelia backe vnto my friend.
            
            
               Gripe.
               I, heers my hand▪ I do conſent,
               And thinke hir happie in hir happie choice,
               Yet halfe foreiudge my hopes will be deceiu'd.
               But Fortunatus: I muſt needes commend,
               Thy conſtant mind thou bear'ſt vnto thy friend.
               The after ages wondring at the ſame:
               Shall ſait's a deede deſeruing laſting fame.
            
            
               Fort.
               Then reſt you here til I returne againe,
               Ile go to Sophos ere I goe along:
               And bring him here to keepe you company.
               Perhaps he hath ſome skill in hidden arts,
               Of Planets courſe, or ſecret magicke ſpells,
               To know where Lelia and that Foxe lies hid,
               Whoſe craft ſo cunningly conuaid hir hence.
            
            Exit Fortu.

               Faith Sir, this ſame Churms is a very ſcuruy Lawer:
               For once I put a caſe to him: and me thought his law was not worth a pudding.

               Why what was your caſe?
            
            
               Will.
               Marry Sir, my caſe was a gooſes caſe:
               For my dog wirried my neighbours ſow, and the ſow died▪

               VVil.
               No: but he went to law with me, and would make me either pay for his ſow, or hang my dogge:
               Now Sir to this ſame Retourner I went.

               Maſter, here comes your ſonne againe▪

               Here Sophos is, as much ore-worne with loue,
               As you with griefe for loſſe of Lelia.
               
            
            
               Sophos.
               And ten times more if it be poſſible.
               The loue of Lelia is to me more deare,
               Then is a kingdome or the richeſt crowne
               That ere adornd the temples of a king.

               Then welcome Sophos: thrice more welcome now
               Then any man on earth to me or mine.
               It is not now with me as late it was;
               I lowrd at learning, and at vertue ſpurnd:

               Here Sophos, take thy Lelias hand:
               Great God of heauen your hearts combine
               In virtues lore to raiſe a happie line.

               Now Phaeton hath checkt his fierie ſteeds,

            But if there be, (as tis no doubt there is)
            In all this round ſome Cinique cenſurers,
            Whoſe onely ſkill conſiſts in finding faults,
            That haue like Midas mightie Aſſes eares,
            Quicke iudgements that will ſtrike at euerie ſtale,
            And perhaps ſuch as can make a large diſcourſe
            Out of Scoggins ieſts, or the hundred merrie tales:
            Marrie if you go any further, tis beyond their reading;
            To theſe I ſay, I ſcorne to lend a looke,
            And bid them vaniſh vapours, and ſo let them paſſe.
