               READER I knowe not what you are, and therefore I cannot well tell What to saye to you: onelye this at aduenture, if you bee wise, you will not play the fool in scoffing at that, which perhappes may deserue a better countenaunce: if you bee not wise, I can but praye for your better vnderstanding: howsouer you bee, I will hope the beste of you, that you will think of my work as it deserues, which is as much as I desire▪ if you get any good by it, thank me for it: if hurt, thanke your selfe, for youre abuse of that mighte serue you better:

this is all I can, and will at this time saye vnto you: my intente was to pleasure manie, and you maie be one of them: and to hurt none at all, and therefore not you. So leauing my booke to your liking, as it falleth out, I rest as I haue reason;
            
               Your friend, Nich. Breton.

                  SWeet should be that spirit, which through the instinct of loue vnderstādeth the silence of truth whose tonge is the hearte, whose words are sighs, in which are hidden the secret fruites of those trees, that onely grow in the paradise of reason; vouchsafe then faire eie, more brighte then the sunny beames, with one faire glaunce, of

               WIsedome mighte well appeare in that hearte, which could pearce into the conceipte of that spirit, that with the figures of loue, deceiues the sence of Simplicitie: which not suspecting euill, findes seldome other substance: O poore truthe how is thy Title made a shadow of deceipt, while in seeking of paradise, folly falls into hell: yet, not to wrong any Creature, happy maie that liue, that makes faith his felicitye, and pardoned be that paper, that doth but his masters message: let then sighs be buried in the depth of forgetfullnes, while silence vnderstandeth that vertue speaketh: and in the fier of that flame, whose heat is more felt then seen, be that letter burned that offendes me with pleasure: so assuring my selfe, that if from the nest of the Phaenix you passe without a fether, either the figure will be a Cipher, or the fancie affection: so leauing your beste thought to a blessed Issue, I rest Affectionately▪

               VNworthy should that heart bee of the least of loues happines, that can haue power to giue place, to the poyson of deceeite: and more then miserable were the life, that to hel makes sutch a passage: Oh blessed creature, do not thinke the world to be the Caue of the accursed, nor doe a wrong to loue, in the suspition of truth; Simple faith hath no feare, and true loue cannot faine; but, if Silence be the onely Aunswere of the expectation o

               VNgratious is that spirite, that thorough suspition of deceipte, doth Iniury to loue: and blessed is that fancie, that liues onelie by faithe: sweet is the warre, where kindnes endes the quarrell, and little the hurt, where hope is a moste present and readie helpe: in briefe, they are blinde trauailers that in seeking to finde heauen, goe to hell, and if loue bee himselfe, he hath life in Assurance: let it then suffice you, to finde the due of desart, where desire exceedes not the limits of Reason: so, in the nature of that honour, that giues vertue her best Grace, commending the comfort of your care to the condition of your conceipte, I reste: as I haue occasion to equall honoure in true affection.

               WIddow, if you wold not be sowre, I would cal you sweet: for though you know I loue you, yet you wil say I flatter you: but yet bee it how it will, this is truth, beleeue it as you wil: your eies haue caught my hearte, who hath sworne me a seruant to your wil▪ I cannot with eloquence court you▪ but I can truelie loue you, and think my selfe blessed, if I might enioie you: for as your presence may please the wisest, so your wisedome may commaund the honest: for your wealth, be it more or lesse then is reported, your selfe being of more worth then you can haue, I wish your selfe rather then what is yours you fear perhaps youths inconstancy, it is triall that proueth truth: and for my loue, it shall end with my life: but what are wordes vnbeleeued? or hopes not firmly grounded? like the vision of a dream, which awake proues nothing: yet good widow, if you be kinde pitty mee: and if pitiful, fauour me: and if gratious, loue mee: God will reward you, loue will be true to you, and I wil dye ere I wil deceiue you: you may encrease your coyne, and decrease youre comfort: when a coughing sung at midnighte, maie make you weepe before day: but venture a little and haue much: what I am, or haue, you shall haue all my loue, my seruice, my life, & what can you haue more? a little more drinke to make the cup run ouer: and perhaps marre the drink that was good before:

A little more coyne to fil the tother bagge, and perhaps fal out to prooue a peece of false monie: when cōmended by a Coistrel, that will serue for nothing but a C

                  e. Logick is but for the Uniuersitie: for musick, it brings more crotchets then crowns: for Astronomy, it goes too high aboue the cloudes, to doe any good on the earth: Cosmography is good for a trauailer, and Astrology for a Sea-man: but for

him that meanes to gather wealth, and grow rich, let him bee perfect in Arithmetick, to be sure of his numbers: it will be a meane to gather wealth many waies, for if you keepe a merchants booke, you shall learne his accounts, the prices of his wares, and the gaines of them, as well by greate as by retaile: as wel outward, as homeward: & this is a sure waie to wealth: againe, if thou be aduanced to place of office, to keepe account of the number of the people, the duties, tributes, and what paiments so euer to be made by them, for Subsidies, Fifteens, customes, and what els soeuer. Arithmetick is most necessary for thy speedy dispatch of all those businesses: for howsoeuer honour may be sought or bought by them that haue enough, seeke thou wealth, and that will bring thee what the world can giue thee: for if thou fall into want, and impairing or spending thy stocke, bee forced to take some meane course for thy maintenāce, I wil tel thee what thou shalt find true: the honest wil only pitty thee, and say thou maist keepe a schoole, tis an honest trade, whē a churl wil grudg at his groat, for a shillings worth of labour, in beating quick sence into a dull wit: who, if hee bee not capable of a good vnderstanding▪ yet shall the fault of his imperfection be imputed to thy negligence, and thou vndeserued, receiue either a frowne or a foule worde for thy laboure: nowe the proud Peacock that hath a little more mony thē wit, wil perhaps entertain thee to a blew coate, and forty shillings which, how gratious it will be to a good spirit, thou shalt find, and I shal be sory to hear: Beleeue me, if thou haue al the sciences, be furnished with manie languages, and art acquainted with honourable courses, and hast a heart as honest as can liue; yet if thou lack wealth to grace al the rest, thou shalt haue a foole come ouer thee, and a knaue abuse thee. & he whose wit goes no further then his trade, so play vpon thy misery, with scāning thy cours of life, that thou wilt wish rather neuer to be borne, then to be borne downe with vnhappines: yea for necessities sake thou shalt be enforced to bestowe thy studie in fictions and follies, and to spend thy spirit in vain, yea I may saie, vile inuentions, to commend an vnworthy person, to the

wound of thine owne conscience, who though he loue to heare himselfe flattered, yet perhaps when he hath very miserablie rewarded thee▪ yet will he lye of his bounty, which is little better then beggery: Oh what a plague is it to a noble spirit, through meer want, to present an Asse, with a burthen of wit, or a base spirit with a tract of honour? Oh deare VVill, the wealthy that haue but a little wit, wil grow rich with making a benefit of thy labours: while thou not waying thy lacke of iudgement, in the first directing of thy course, wilt pine away with sorrow to thinke of thy mistaken fortune: in briefe therfore follow my counsell, studie all the Artes superficially, but chiefely Arithmetique, for it is the assured way to wealth: bee not ignorant in Diuinity, for it is the soules comfort: and take heede of Poetry, leaste it runne away with thy wit: for it hath commonly one of these three properties, belibelling the wicked, abusing the honest, or pleasing the foolish: and therfore though some excellent man may haue an excellent humour, doe thou rather reade in an euening, then make thy daies worke in the studie of idlenesse: giue them praise that deserue it, but doe not thou bend thy delight towards it: for in a word, it is more full of pleasure then profit. Thus haue I writ thee a tedious letter, hoping that if thou wilt followe my aduise, it will doe thee no harme: and if so much good as I desire, I shall be glad to see it: in the meane time, leauing thy courses with thy selfe, to the guiding and tuition of the almightie, I rest:

among whome, my selfe more desirous then able to deserue the least of your good countenance, am yet presumptuous to trouble you with an humble sute. I haue a sister of yeares sufficient, to vnderstand betwixt good and euill: and of disposition, I thanke God, not a misse: her bringing vpp hath beene chiefely at her booke and needle, but yet is shee not vnfurnished of other parts fit for a seruant of her place: which if it mighte so stand with your good pleasure, shoulde bee to attende your honour in your chamber: her trueth I will vndertake, for her diligence I will not doubte of; her kinde nature I can speake of, and her affection vnto your Ladishippe, I knowe is not a little: if therefore in all these, shee may bee pleasing to your entertainemente, I shall bee bound to your good fauoure in the honour of her preferment; which beeing the highest aduancement, that her duty can deserue, I leaue her seruice with mine owne, to your honourable emploiment. So crauing pardon to my boldnesse, with fauor to my sute, I humblie take my leaue.

I know not the cause, but what euer it be misconceiued in vnkindnes, let me intreat you, to beleeue my loue, and I desire no more; for when you are wearie of the flatterie of

those that feede vppon you, among the greate showers of your kindnesse, that you dailie raine downe vppon their fieldes, you will I hope bestowe one droppe of grace vppon my grounde: I will

               To my dearest beloued friend on earth, H. W.
               HOnest Harry, out of the troubled spirit of a tormēted heart I write to thee, and therefore beare with my skill if it be not in the pleasing nature of so good an humor as I could wish, and thou art worthie of: but as I know thee able to iudge of colours, better then the blind eies of beetel heads, and of that true kindnesse, that can and dooth rather comfort the afflicted, then encrease the sorrowes of the distressed: let mee imparte to thee some part of my passion, that patience in thy pitie, may the better plaie her part in my spirit: what shall I saie? I liue as without life, pleasuring in nothing, crossed in all hopes, put in manie feares, languishing in manie sorrowes, & troubled with the grief of a wounded conscience: not with the horror of murther, the feare of treason, nor delight of sinne: but with the crueltie of fortune, the vnkindnesse of friends, and the breach of my credit: and most of all, with them whom I most loue. Oh God, my heart aketh, and blame it not: and my spirit mourneth, and

reprooue it not: for though patience bee a vertue that maketh men diuine, yet there is but one Christ, & men are no Angels: and let me tell thee true, the miserie of my life is intolerable in the sense of nature: for compare the afflictions of the most patient, with the causes of my passions, and prouide a world of pittie, to behold the mappe of my miseries: hath one man beene wealthie, & becom poore? so am I: hath another suffered wrong? so doe I another buried his parents, children, & deare friendes? so haue I: another trauailed farre in hope of gaine, and return with losse? so haue I: another been wounded in the wars, fared hard, laine in a cold bed, manie a bitter storme, and been at manie a hard banquet? all these haue I: another imprisoned, so haue I: another long beene sicke? so haue I: another plagued with an vnquiet wife? so am I: another indebted to his hearts griefe, and faine would paie and cannot? so am I: another in loue? so am I; another out of loue with himselfe? so am I; in summe, when anie of these crosses, are able to kill the heart of a kind spirit, and all these lie at once so heauie vpon mine hart, as nothing but the hand of God can remoue, besides my continual toile, for the reward of vnquietnesse; while that which should be my comfort, is my corrosiue, imagine how, with all this, I can liue; and think what a death it is thus to liue. Oh the scorn of the proud, the abuse of the vngratious, the scoff of the foolish, and the scanning of the vnkind: the companie of the discontentiue, and the want of the most affected; the disgrace of learning, the losse of time, and the miserie of want. If there be a Hell on the earth, it cannot be farre from this caue of my discomforte; where I am sure, the diuel seeing my desire to serue God, laieth all the barres he can in the waie of my best comfort: but I de

for the hastening whereof, in my deliuerance from my torments, and comforts in his mercies, I will frame my dailie prayers, and bee assured of thy Amen: but I feare I am too tedious, and therefore wil thus end: God continue my patience, but not my sorrowes, giue me deliuerance from my miseries, and make me thankful for his blessings: & blesse thee with as much happines, as thou knowst I want; so leauing my hopes to his mercies, and vs both to his tuition: I rest; with as little rest, as I think any man can rest,

trees are so wasted, that thee is scarce a piece of timber worth the felling: your Moor is shrewdly spoyled for lack of draining and your pastures are so ouergrowne with bushes, that it wil aske greate cost in stubbing, before it be brought to any good passe: yet not withstanding, for that we haue been vpon speech for it, and that you seeme willing to deale with me, if you wil pitch a reasonable price, your mony shall not bee long deferred: I pray you therefore,

as to moue your displeasure, let the fire bee the reward of his presumption: but if through the fauor of the faults or the vertue of your gratious pittie it hath beene worthy the reading, let mee be metamorphosed to worse then nothing, if I desire to be any other thing then that may pleese you in all ceremonies and circumstances, or in affection: and therefore, leauing, my seruice to your commaund, and my loue to the life of your fauour, wishing to die like the Phenix, to receiue in the beames of your beautie, I rest full of vnrest, til I may fullie rest,
               
                  Yours as you may of you will; R. E.
               
            
            
               The Ladies answere.
               WIse were that hearte which could pierce into the conceit of that spirite, which with the art of loue, seeketh to inchaunt the trust of simplicity: which, for not suspecting of euill-falls vpon the point of much miserie: Oh poor truth, how art thou made a vaile or couer for decet? when vnder the shadow of paradise, is sought the waie to hell. Oh cursed trees that carry such fruite: but not to wrong any creature: Happy may that hearte liue, which in faith onely seekes his felicitie: and pardoned be that paper that doth but his dutye. Let then all sighs be drowned in the deepth of obliuion, while Silence vnderstandeth that Vertue speaketh. Nowe for the nest of the Phenix, if you can clime so high & carrie awaie neuer a feather with you, then it is but a fiction, or vertue vnhappie, but to waite the issue of honors hope, to the blisse of vertues fauour, I rest, when I further vnderstand you, as I thinke good to answere you: and till then, and alwaies rest,
               
                  Yours as falls, as I well may; A.B.
               
            
            
               
               A replie to the aunswere.
               VNworthie were that minde of the thought of loue, which could giue place to the treason of betraying of trust: and more then miserable were that life, that towards hell could make such a passage. Oh Angel-like creature, thinke not the world the habitation onely of the accursed: nor do wrong to loue, in suspition of truth: You saie, happie be that life that seeks happinesse in faithfulnesse: but what doe you say to loue? A simple conceit cannot descend into suspition, and the thought of deceite is hatefull to loue: Bee not then incredulous where loue is vertuous, and for the fiction of the Phenix, make the substance true in your selfe, whose least thougte of fauour, shall be worth all the feathers of the fairest bird that flieth. So reposing hopes comfort on the honoure of your kindnes, bese

               VNhappie be that soule, which in suspicion of truth, should wrong the vertue of loue; and blessed bee that heart, which in hate of treason, makes faith his felicitie. Silence is a language that conceit is onely acquainted with, and gentle is that warre, which giues no deadly wound: feare not then the paine that a breath will blow awaie, when the hope of comfort wil cure the disease: but what need more figures? flie the waie to hell, and finde the way to heauen, Let thy heart goe with thy tong and the Eccho wil giue a happy sound. Till when, not doubting the diuine nature of loue to be free from the diuelish poison of deceit: I rest as I find reason.

               IF I should commend you aboue the Moone, and compare you with the Sunne, you would put me in the cloudes for a flatterer: but knowing your owne worth, and finding the substance of my truth, you cannot blame, in admiration, to speake truth of your perfection, which of what power it is in drawing the seruice of reason, if you would beleeue, loue would quicklie tell you: but the course of inconstancie in the vnwise: breedeth distrust of truth in the most faithfull: but all birds are not of one feather, nor all men of one mind. In briefe not to make a long haruest of a little torne, which being ripe, woulde be gathered in good time: let truth be my spokes-man, and beleefe my comfort: the hope whereof, as my onely worldes happines, referring onely to the care of your kindnes, in the faith of true affection, I rest.
               
                  Yours auowed and assured. R. N.

and therefore entreat you, notwithstanding my allowance of your iudgement touching the heauenly prouidence, and power in the motion of al good actions: yet so to allow of my opinion, touching consideration, that it is a great, and one of the greatest causes of the confusion of reason, by the corruption of nature: and knowing that the care of your consideration is such as doth and may wel giue example to the most expert, to follow the rules of your directions in the whole course of your life, wishing my selfe so happie, as to enioy the company of so good a friend, till I see you and euer: I rest in fast setled affection.

               To my sweet loue mistris E. P.
               SWeet Loue, if absence could breed forgetfulnesse, then fortune should doe much harme to affection: but when the eye of the mind looketh into the ioye of the hearte, the sentence may well be spoken. As in silence you may heare me, so in absence you may see me: for loue is not an hours humour, nor a shadowe of light, but it is a light of the spirit, and a continuing passion: thinke not therfore, I do or can forget thee, or loue my sefe, but for thee: shortly I hope to see thee, and in the meane time, though not with thee, yet not from thee, nor well at rest with my selfe, til I may reste only with thee, I rest alwaies to rest.
               
                  
                     Thine onely and all.

               MY deare, if delayes were not a death to loue, excuse were currant in the construction of kingdomes: but sentences are better spoken then vnderstood, and a pleasing presence, is better then an excused absence: remembrance is good,

but possession better, and loue holdeth memorie, but a kind of melancholie. Let your selfe therefore be your messenger rather of your loue, then your letters, least fortune in a mad fit be a crosse to your best comforte, not in respect of my constancy, but my parents vnkindnesse, This is all I will write at this time, but wishing a happie time, to the beginning of a neuer ending, I rest til that time, and at all times on the same:

I know you haue manie suters of worth: but none that I thinke worthy: for none can loue you so much, nor esteeme you so well: for I haue knowne the world, and care not for it, nor for any thing but you. If therefore all I haue may please you, and my selfe, to loue and honour you, make my comfort your contentment, and I will seeke no other paradise in this world. Thus hoping that reason in your fauour, wil effect the hope of my affection, leauing to your selfe, to be youre selfe: I rest,

Triall cannot let you doubte my loue: and loue will bee sworn for the securitie of my truth: both which thus far plead for me in your fauour: giue truth the reward of triall, and loue the regard of truth, and desire not the sentence of iustice to let me liue or die in your iudgemente: for imprisoned I am in youre beauty, bound in

If sicknes makē thee feel the hand of God, shall not patience make thee trie his mercy? and health make thee know his loue? if losses make thee poore, wert thou not beteer with patience be Gods begger, then in pride the worlds king? grieue not then at thy fortune, but liue by thy faith:

you troath, I think you are best in your quoiting coat: for your tricking and your tyring takes awaie all your proportion: so that the Painter and the Tasler, haue put nature out of countenance: but since it is the fashion, for fools to weare a cockes-combe, let them weare feathers that list, I will not blow them awaie: but as a good friend let mee tell you, that tel you but for your good, be honest and be hangd'e, and let knauery goe to the diuel: stand unt leering in your door, nor deuise lies to make fooles, nor vse tricks to pick pockets, for in the end all will bee naught: for the poxe, or the gallowes, or the diuel, will be the reward of plaine leacherie, if in the waie you scape beggery: and therefore follow my counsaile, giue ouer betimes, before it giue ouer you: and since I haue turned my coate, turn your olde gowne, and we will ioie together, to goe both in a liuery: for say the word, and I am for thee: and so til I hear from thee, I commend me to thee.

Why? let me tell thee what it is: simplie, I cannot tell thee: but what are the qualities of it, as I haue heard and read of it, I wil deliuer thee: It will Cuckold age, and befoole youth: betray beautie, and wast wealth: dishonor vertue, and worke villanie: this kind of loue I meane, that makes thee dance trenchmore without a pipe: it will not let one sleepe, nor eat, nor drink, nor stād, nor sit in quiet: it will teach a foole to flatter, a knaue to lye, a wench to dance, and a scholler to be a Poet, before he can hitte the right way of a kind verse, it will make a Souldiour lazie, a Courtier wanton, a Lawyeridle, a Merchant poore, and a poore man a begger: it will make a wise man a fool, and a fool quite out of his wits: it will make a man womanish, and a woman, Apish: To be short, there is so much ill to be said of it, that he is happy who hath not to doe with it.

Thou hast heard, thou knowest not what, and talkest thou knowest not howe: take a woodcocke in a spring, and touch not me with these termes: now for thy mourning, let it be for the losse of thy wit, for I haue no feare of had I wist: Loue (quoth he) yes, neuer knew what it is, and yet speake so much of it: either you wrong it or your selfe, that you no better vnderstand it: for let me tell you, you are mistaken in it: it is the light of beautie, the blis of nature, the honour of reason, and the ioie of time: the cōfort of age, and the life of youth: it is the tongue of truth, the staye of wit, and the rule of vnderstanding: it is the bridle of wil, & the grace of sence: it makes a man kinde, and a woman constant: and while fools and Apes, play bo-peep for a pudding, Louers haue a life, that they would not leaue for a mountaine. Now for Mars and Venus, they are studies for schole boyes, and hee that feareth Vulcan, let him be whipt for Cupid. To bee shorte, thou art strangelie out of tune, to write me such a peece of musique: for were I but in the waie, shal I turne back to thy whistle? no, thou knowest not what it is, and therefore talk no more of it: for hadst thou but once kindly had a tast of it, thou wouldst die ere thou wouldst leaue it: beleeue it, I know it, and therfore

for thy derision of my mistrisse, I wil take it as a dream, and be sorry, that awake thou hadst no more witte then to write it: but let all vnkindnesse passe, it may bee I wil shortly see thee: and then make thee glad to yeeld to me, that thou art in a foule error to wish me leaue my loue, to liue with thee; but since I know thy kindnes, I will beare with thy weaknesse, and in the faith of an old friend, hearken to thee in an other matter: & so wishing thee no more to enuy so much against a matter of so excellent vertue, I will leaue thee for this time, and rest alwaies,

               An angry letter, by a young Louer in the Countrie, to his Loue. M.N,
               
                  MArgerie, the truth is, you doe not vse me well: what doe I get by you to loose my daies worke, and sit on a stile blowing my fingers in the colde, in hope to meete you a milking, and you send an other in your roome, and goe to market an other waie: well, if I bee not your sweete hearte, much good doe you with your choice: I hope my fathers sonne is worthie of your mothers daughter; Your Pricking in a cloute is not so good as a plough: and for your portion, I can haue your betters: but tis no matter, hee is curste in his Cradle, that trustes anie of your wordes, and therefore since tis as tis, let it be as twil: I will not put at my hearte, that you hang at your heeles. Well to be short, take it for a wa

me so no more, that is once: and therefore either bee, as you shoulde bee, or bée as you list, for I will not disgeste more then I can, that is the truth: other folke see it as well as I, what a foole you make of mee, but tis no matter, I maye liue to be meete with you: but yet, if you will giue ouer your gadding, and bee rulde by your friendes counsaile, I can bee contente to forget al that is past, and to be as good friends as ere we were. And so hoping to heare better of you, then some folkes thinke of you, meaning to bee at your towne, the next market daye, if you will meet me at the Rose, we will haue a Cake, and a cup of Ale, and maye happe bee merrie ere wee parte: and so farewell.

Whats heere to doe with my Fathers horse and youre mothers mare? Why, I wonder what you ayle, is the Moone in the Eclipse, that you are so out of Temper?

In conclusion, come not to mee till I sende for you, nor look after mee, till I bidde you, I will drinke no Bottle ale

with such a bottle nose, nor desire to come to market to meete such a companion: and so glad to haue this occasion to try your patience, the foreman of fooles be your woodcocke father, and teach you better howe to vse your witte if you haue any: And so in as little loue as I can, sauing my charitie: In hartie good will, I leaue you as I found you: and so rest,

                  A Bitter sweete is like a Phisicall potion, if I be so to your thoughts, I hope I shall purge your head of ill humours: and then faming fancie, that would deceiue plaine simplicitie, will abuse neither of vs: and if your flatterie were not grosse in my complexion, I should haue no suspect of your condition: with how farre it is from your protested truth, I leaue to the secret confession of your little affection: wordes followe thoughts at the heeles, and thoughts keepe the head▪ not the heart: where the brains a little troubled, it puts the wit much out of temper: and therefore wishing you to leaue honoure to the noble, and seruice to the wealthy, giue me leaue to like of equality, and to settle my affection in discretion: which hating to disgrace the wel deseruing, cannot but dayly fauour y• faithful: distrust is a kind of iealousie: which if I could loue, I should perhaps be acquainted with: but solitarinesse b
