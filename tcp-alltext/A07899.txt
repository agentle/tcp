            To the right Honourable
Sir Thomas
Bromeley Knight, Lord Chanceller
of England: William, Lord
Burleigh, and Lorde Treasorer:
Robert, Earle of Leicester, Thomas,
Lorde Chamberlaine, and
Fraunces, Earle of Bedforde, with

Honourable Councell: continuaunce

all heauenlie wisedome.
            
               
                  IT hath beene alwayes
seen (right
Honorable) that
the Peaceableste
Prince hath had
the priuiest enimies, the moste
ciuill gouernment, some vnciuill
aduersaries: whose tedious
natures, could not liue within
the compasse of vert
                  •
               e and modestie,
and therefore they were

at continuall warre with them,
who established and maintayned
a thing of such excellencie
within their Dominiōs. I need
not trauaile for circūstances, to
approoue what I haue said: for
that it hath beene manifested
heere in our Realme of England.
Her Maiestie, vnder
whom we haue been so godlie,
gratiouslie & famouslie gouerned,
her selfe beeing a spectacle
to the whole world, for vertue
and modesty of life: how greatlie
she is defamed, contemned,
and despised therefore, of those
whom iniquitie and error hath
peruerslie blinded, I leaue to
your Honorable iudgements,
my humilitie & vnfained loyaltie
remembred. But fearing
to intangle my self in any such
matters, as may either seeme

tedious to your Honours, or
troublesome to any modest
minde: I betake my selfe to
such a simple course of breuitie,
as may discouer my true intent,
and the duetiful reuerence
I owe to so Honourable personages.
            It is not vnknowen to your
Honours, how not long since I
witnessed my faithfull seruice
to her Maiestie, to the disproouing
of such, as were bothe her
professed and sworne aduersaries:
at which tyme, how notablie
they were approoued guiltie
of euerie obiection, bothe
by their owne writinges, sufficiēt euidence, & vnreprooueable
witnesses: it were needlesse
heere to rehearse, for that the
matter is yet apparant.
            Since that time (right Honourable)

there hath beene cast
abroade, by the secrete fauourers
and 
                  •
               reends, of these so sufficiently
cōuicted: such reports,
Lybels, & trayterous speeches
in the behalfe of the aforenamed,

and vniust manner.
            Wherefore, at the earnest
intreatie of diuers, godlie and
well disposed men, as also to
discharge my selfe of the manifest
vnt

               tcherous
practises, that it maye be seene

and knowen, howe falselie and
vntruelie they haue accused
me, and that they maye well
vnderstand, howe I haue beene
in those places, where I ha

            My request is therefore to
your Honours, vnder whose

safelie and sufficientlie defended:
that this my good intent

Thus remaining the most affectionate
in duetiful seruice to
her Maiestie, and an humble

Honours: I cease at this time,
beseeching God long to preserue
her Maiestie, and
your Honours in continuall

that in Bithinia
there is a Riuer called Aleos,
and of some Olochas:
of which if any one taste,
that hath broken his faithe
to his Prince and Coūtrey:
his entrayles are presently
set on fyre within him, and
so he endeth his life meruelous
miserably.
            I would such a Riuer
were in all Citties in the
world: for then lesse Treason
and impietie would be
practised among men, against
their Prince and
naturall Countrey.
            You see of late how it
hath happened by our owne
Countreymen, borne and
bred heere among vs, how

they neither regarding their
duetie to God, or faithfull
looue they ought to beare
theyr Princesse and Countrey:
wilfully yeelded themselues
to the enemy of the
whole world, with him to
practise the destruction of
their lawfull Soueraigne
and her dominion: which
beeing manifestly prooued
to theyr faces, is neuerthelesse
misreported by some of
their secret fauourers.
            Wherefore, that thou
maist beware, how thou
giuest credit to any of them
all, whose wicked mindes
kick and spurne against the
trueth: read this Discourse,
and thou shalt euidently see
into the depthe of their secret

and trayterous dealings.
            And if thou finde in some
places, such wordes as modestie
can hardly suffer: bestowe
such reuerence in the
reading, as thou maiste
be warned by them,
to remaine euer a
loyall and faithfull
subiect.

            A Discouerie of
Edmund Campion, and
his Complices, their most traiterous
practises, against her
Maiestie, and the
Realme.
            Edmund Campion, Raphe Sherwin,
Lucas Kerbie, Edwarde
Rishton, Thomas Coteham,
Henrie Orton, and Robert
Iohnson, all these aforenamed
persons, were brought on Monday,
the 20. of Nouember to the
high Barre at VVestminster:
where they were seuerallie, and
all together, endited vpon high
Treason, the sum whereof, followeth
in breefe as thus.
            THAT these persons, contrarie
bothe to looue and
dutie, forsooke their natiue
Countrie, to liue beyond the

Seas, vnder the Popes obedience,
as at Roome, Rheimes, and
diuers other places: where, (the
Pope hauing with other Princes
practised, the death and depriuation
of our moste gratious
Princesse, and vtter subuertion
of her seat and kingdom,
to his deuillish and abhominable
Religion) these men, hauing
vowed their alleageaunce
to the Pope, to obey him in all
causes whatsoeuer, being there,
gaue their consent, yea vttermost
furtherance they might,
to ayde him in this moste traiterous
determination.
            And for this intent and purpose,
they were sent ouer, to seduce
the hearts of her Maiesties
loouing Subiects, and to conspire
and practise her Graces

death, as much as in them lay,
against a great day, set and appointed,
when the generall hauock
should be made, those only
reserued that ioyned with
them. This layde to their
charge, they boldely and impudently
denyed: wherevpon
a lewrie was impaneled, their
owne confessions, their owne
writings, and credible witnesses,
Viua voce, produced to their
faces, approouing them guiltie
of the former allegations, as
heereafter followeth.
            
               
               After the Endightment
was read vnto
them, and theyr
aunswere, that it
was beyond theyr
power to prooue them faultie in
any such matters, so stiflie they
stoode in their apparant impudencie:
first was mooued to them,
sundrie Treasons past, attempted
against her Maiestie, by those
of theyr sect and disposition, yet
notwithstanding the vttermost of
theyr mallice and crueltie: howe
mightilie God had defended his
chosen Elizabeth, returning their
dealinges to theyr owne destruction.
            Among sundrie these Treasonable
practises,The rebellion in the North, onely through the Popes meanes. which the Pope,
the aunciēt aduersarie to her Maiestie:
hath at diuers tymes set a
broche, the rebellion in the North
may remaine as a witnesse, of his
exceeding mallice & spight against

her Grace and gouernement.
            Whereto let vs ad, the Bull sent
ouer by Iohn Felton,
               The s
                     •
                  m of the Popes Bul, which our Englishe men beyonde the Seas, holde as their authoritie, to rebell against her Maiestie. which Traiterouslie
he placed on the Bishop
of Londons gate: in which Bull,
the Pope vtterlie excommunicated
her Maiestie, shée was an Heretique,
he had dispossest her of her
Crowne and Dominion, shée
was not the lawfull Quéene of
this Realme, and her Subiectes
were not bounde to obeye any of
her Lawes or Decrées: but they
were all frée, and perfectlie discharged
of theyr allegeaunce to
her, so that they might lawfullie,
when tyme serued so conuenient
for them, bothe styrre rebellion
against her, and also enter into
Armes against her Maiestie.
            The Popes wyll in this, hath
béen put in execution, as through
the yll demeanour of diuers persons
to him affected, it was mooued
in the North: where, maintaining
themselues on the aucthoritie

of the Pope, and his traiterous
Bull, secretly dispersed abroad,
they entred into a plaine
and manifest rebellion.Doctor Saunders his rebellion in Ireland, through whom the people were seduced to fight against theyr lawfull Princesse. The like
was put in practise in Ireland,
through Doctor Saunders, and other
Traitours, who there ioyned
themselues together, vnder the
Popes standard, to bring to pass
                  •
               
their secret appointment in this
Realme. Through their perswasions
and dealings, the people
were mooued in the Popes name,
to fight against their lawfull
Princesse vnder his Banner: and
to rebell against her, so notoriously
as they might. The encouragement
to this great disobedyence,
they receyued through
Doctor Saunders, a Fugitiue and
ranck Traitour to his Prince
and Co
                  •
               ntrey: as also through
diuers Iesuits, bothe English and
Irish, whose hippocriticall shewe
of holines, & deuillish perswasions
on the behalse of the Pope, theyr

Maister and head: entised a multitude
of the people there, to
chaunge their profession in Religion,
and to yeeld them selues to
the Popes authoritie, whereby
they should renounce the moste
certaine and iust title of her Maiestie,
and when forraine forces
should be assembled there, they to
ioyne with them in their intent,
and so traiterously rebell against
their lawfull Soueraigne. All
these practises tooke their origynall
from the Pope, as well by
sending his secret Messengers, as
also by his trayterous Bull:This Bull remayneth in his former force, by this Pope, onely a tolleration for the s
                     •
                  raitnes to the Subiecte therein amended.
which béeing sent by Pius Quintus,
is neuer thelesse confirmed (in
the former authoritie) by this
Pope Gregorie, xiij. and remayneth
in hope to take effect at some
time or other, for which he dooth
watche opportunitie as conueniently
as he may.
            But God, the iust auenger of
all causes, as he hath hitherto

preserued her Maiestie, and this
lyttle Iland, from all theyr malicious
attempts and practises, and
hath deseruedlie thrown the yoke
of theyr shame, on theyr owne
neckes: so wyll he, no doubt, continew
his fatherlie care, that his
Chyldren shall be preserued, and
theyr aduersaries confounded.
            But sayeth Maister Campion:
               Maister Cāpion destreth not to heare, howe their Treasons tooke their originall, & howe from tyme to time they haue beene enterprised and confoū
                  ded: wherefore to blind the peoples 
                     •
                  yes, he maketh this counterfeyt aunswere.
what is this to vs héere present?
what appertaineth this to our endytement?
we are héere bothe seuerallie
and altogeather endyted
on high Treasō, and for that that
is obiected against vs, we must
aunswere. Let not other mennes
offences be layde to our charge,
that we should aunswer for other
mennes faultes committed long
since: some of vs were then but
Nouises héere in y• Uniuersities,
and were altogether ignoraunt
of these matters. What haue we
to doo with any thing that they
dyd? they that were offendours,

let them aunswere to what you
can lay against them.
            For vs that be héere at this instant,
you must eyther saye: thou
Campion dyddest this thing, or
thou (naming some of the other)
committedst this offence, and
therevpon bring your proofes and
witnesses, otherwise you shal neuer
be able to touch vs. As for
these assertions, for the strength
they haue against vs, I wyll not
estéeme it woorth a peny woorth of
Pippins: and therfore to your endytement.
            This aunswer, so smoothly deliuered,
and with such coy lookes,
and protestation of action iested:
to all the standers by gaue perfect
notice of the man, bothe of his nature
and disposition, as also of his
prompte and ingenious capacity,
to shaddowe an absolute trueth,
with a showe of great wisedome
and learning. For this he knew
                  •
               
right well, that before he came to

that place, he had w
                  •
               n a meruaylous
goodly reporte, to be such a
man,In the Libell against mee, was made this report of Campion, to be a man of so rare learning & excellēcy. &c. as his lyke was not to be
found, eyther for lyfe, learning, or
any qualitie that might beautifie
a man, so that by his fauourers &
fréendes it was blowen abroade:
that we had neither Doctors nor
other, that were woorthy to enter
disputation with him, he was so
farre aboue them all, that they
might not deale with him.
            Nowe béeing brought vnto a
publique triall, it stoode him vpon
to argue somewhat of the prayse
that had béene giuen him: wherefore,
in verie quaint and familiar
eloquent gloses, he stoode vppon
quirkes and fine deuise of spéeche,
thinking, as he had deluded many
before, so at that present, he might
blinde the eyes of Iustice, and
acquite him selfe of his horrible
treasons. But as trueth sheweth
most braue, when shée goeth naked
and bare, and deceyt finest,

when he is cunninglie florished:
euen so, the poore habit of the one,
discouered the prowde heart of
the other, and confounded his
boldnesse with her sacred bryghtnesse:
giuing all men to vnderstand,
that Veritas vincit omnia.
            
            And because Maister Campion
would haue made such a cunning
conueyaunce of the matter, as
though it neither might or coulde
attaint him or any of them: it
was giuen him to vnderstande,
that they would not alone touche
him in the sequell of the former
causes, but them all, and he that
supposed him selfe the cléerest.
            Wherevpon, Doctor Saunders,
and Doctor Bristowe,
               Doctour Saunders and Doctor Bristowes bookes, were there read vnto them, wherein, most trayterouslie they defended the rebellion against her Maiestie. theyr trayterous
writings in defence of the
Popes Bull exhibited against her
Maiestie, was read vnto them,
howe they bothe allowed it, and
also the Rebellion in the North.
Afterwarde, it was manifestlie
prooued to their faces, that Bristowes
               
booke in allowaunce therof,
named his Motiues, was especiallie
commaunded to be vsed amongst
them both at Roome, and
at Rheimes, euerie one béeing expreslie
charged not to be without
one of these Bookes.
            This with open mouthes, they
altogether denyed, some that they
had neuer seene it, and some that
they neuer heard of any such commaundement:They denyed what one of theyr owne fellowes had confessed▪ and subscribed to, and what euery one of the witnesses knew to be moste certaine.
when as Iohn
Hart, one of their owne fellowes,
had auouched it, and thereunto
subscribed.
            Besides, my selfe when I came
to Rheimes, sawe them as common
amongst them, as the little
Catechisme héere amonge Children,
the inequalitie of the number
considered.
            Againe, at Roome they were
as common likewise, in the Seminarie,
and among the Englishmen
in the Citty, for my selfe had
it, and one of Doctor Allens Catechismies

deliuered me, with great
charge to imbrace it as my chéefe
instruction. My Companion that
went with me, he had one likewise:
the rest of the witnesses,
they had séene how common they
were, and in what reuerence and
authority they estéemed them: yet
these men would with shamelesse
faces deny it, yea, and if they
might haue béene so credited,
would haue sworne against it.
            This manifest reproofe, they
would not graunt vnto: but Maister
Campion taketh vpon him
to wrest it according to his humor,
by answering that the booke
was not so ill as they tooke it for,
nor deserued any such iudgement
of preiudice.
            Now he thought he could not
be taken tardie, but supposed his
argument to passe vnreprooueable.
            For that in the new imprinting
of this Booke, such matters as did

most sharply touch them,Maister Campion aunswered this poynt subtilly: because in the last edition of the booke, the cheefe matters against them selues were abridged. were abridged,
thinking none of the former
bookes should come to lyght:
but héerin Maister Campiō
                ouershot
himself, for so slie an aunswer
could not couer so foule a blemish.
When they had notably conuicted
them of these matters, which with
obstinacie they styll denied: they
came to the intent of their secrete
comming ouer into this Realme,
which was for y• death of her Maiesty,
and ouerthrow of the whole
Realm, which should be by domesticall
rebellion, & forraine hostility,
y• sum wherof, in bréefe is thus.
This little Iland, God hauing so
boūtifullie bestowed his blessings
vpon it, that except it prooue false
within it selfe, no treason whatsoeuer,
can preuaile against it, & the
Pope béeing héerof very well persuaded,
by reason y• all his attēpts
haue prooued of no effect: he hath
foūd out a meane, wherby he assureth
himself to spéede of his desire.

Secrete rebellion must be styrred
héere at home among our selues,The generall determination, howe to bring to passe theyrecret intent in this Realme. y•
harts of the people must be obdurated
against God & their Prince:
so y• when a foraine power shall
on a suddaine inuade this Realm,
the Subiectes thus seduced, must
ioyne with these in Armes, and so
shall the Pope attaine the sum of
his wish. But now let vs examin
eche matter with our selues, & sée
into the bowels of this traiterous
action: yea, let vs before we passe
any farder, resolue our selues how
this secrete Sedition shoulde be
brought to passe. The people must
be first recōciled from their religion,
to imbrace the lawes & decrees
of y• Pope, then, they must be perswaded
to forsake their duety and
allegeance to her Maiesty, because
she is excommunicated out of the
Popes Church, and he hath fréede
them of any obedience they should
vse to her: so that they may lawfully
resist against her, and take
weapōs of defence in this behalfe.
            
               
But now, what are they that
must take vpon them, to win the
hearts of the people in this sorte?
they are no straungers, for if the
Pope should sende them on this
businesse, he might hap to faile, as
he hath doone before: for, the simple
and vnlearned, ignorant in
their language, doubtfull of their
intent, and beside hard to be wun
by those they know not, would
rather appeach them openly, then
agrée with them in this priuilie.
And if so be they might light vpō
some, easie to be intreated, because
their Faithe is not stayed:
they might chaunce vpon some againe,
whose faithfull hearts to
their Soueraigne, would embolden
them rather to die vpon such
a Traitour, then once they would
heare a motion, to offer them disobedience.
            No, no, the Pope was well assured,
that these affayres would
not be so slightly dispatched, and

therfore such a doubtfull matter,
required farre more dilligent
Messengers.The onely cause why the Pope hath kept his two Seminaries at Roome and at Rheimes so long: for that none might better mooue secret r
                     •
                  bellion in England, then they. He hath not kept
his two Seminaries, the one at
Rheimes in Fraunce, the other at
Roome, al this while for nothing,
he hath not looued them, cherished
them, and so fatherlye prouided
for them, but that he had some
farther intent in his dealings:
these are they must doo the déede,
this is the ready stringe to his
bowe, and through them he hopeth
to spéede surely.
            These béeing our owne Countreymen,
sworne to him in all
causes whatsoeuer, well schooled
and instructed in these affaires:
they can with more dexteritie order
these matters, because they
knowe their Hoste before they
come ouer, they can disguise them
selues for béeing knowne, & to be
bréefe, are more priuie to our nature
then any straunger can be,
therefore this is the onely meane.
            
               
To this ende and purpose are
our Englishe men there mayntayned,A sure way, to make all Englishmē they can get out of England, to ioy
                     •
                  e with them in this traiterou

                   intent. For none but such as will be Preests, must staye there.
there receyue they theyr
Préesthoode, and then they are apt
to serue the turne. As for such as
shall come thether, not minding
to be Préestes: there is no place
for them, there are excuses sufficient,
so that he must be a Préest,
or else depart thence.
            And good reason haue they for
this, for when they enter into
Préesthood, they are sworne duetifull
and faithfull to the Pope, to
obey him in all causes what soeuer,
and to doo what soeuer theyr
Superiours shall cōmaund them:
nowe if any one should remayne
among them, not entring into
this oath, their secrete practises
might be discouered, and beside,
that man vnsworne, to be sent about
these matters, might chuse
whether hee woulde fulfill his
charge or no.
            
               
As for those that be Préestes,
and are sworne to this obedience:
they must, what euer
happen to them, doo theyr vttermoste,
or else they fall into
the Popes cursse, and are excommunicated,
besyde, theyr
sinnes (breaking theyr promise
with him,Their perswasion on the Popes behalfe, to vrge our Englishmē to fulfill the Popes minde, what euer comes of them. who is Christes
Uicare on earth) shall neuer be
forgiuen them (say they) neither
in this worlde, nor in the worlde
to come. With such threatnings,
lyes of myracles of theyr Church,
and styncking Reliques they
shewe: they make our Englishe
men bewitched vnto them, so
that they stande in as much aw
                  •

verilie thinke that they redéeme
so many soules out of Purgatory,

as the Pope dooth set vpon them
at his blessing them, euen as verily
doo they credit it, as we hope
to goe to heauen.
            And for this intent,A thing to be looked vnto, for thorow their secret freends, they haue heere, a number are brought to ioyn
                     •
                   in this action. they haue
their perswaders héere, who, if
they know any young Gentleman
or other, that is willing to
trauaile: they will bothe proffer
him such sufficiencie of money, as
shall bring him to their Seminarie
at Rheimes, beside Letters for
his entertainement there, shall be
giuen him, that when he commeth
thither, he shall not onely
be welcommed gratefully, but also
estéemed equall with any of the
other.
            Then when they haue studyed
there a while, that they are
brought within the compasse of
their determination: they shall be
sent to Roome, to receiue their
Préesthood, if so be their mindes
serue them to trauayle so farre,
otherwise they receiue it at

               Rheimes, and this is the continuall
dealings betwéene the two
Seminaries, to be sure of store
for maintenance of their matter.
            These men thus made Préests,Preestes yeer
                     •
                  ly appointed, and sent for England.
are appointed yearely by their
Superiours, so many of them as
shall be thought conuenient, to be
sent into England, to make preparation
for the Popes former
intent. They haue their charge
deliuered them, how warie and
circumspect, how faithfull and dilligent
they must be, in execution
of so great a cause: they are pardoned
for so many dayes as they
cannot say Masse, by reason of the
daunger héere in England, and
therefore they may let theyr
Crownes alone vnshauen, where
if they stayed there, they must be
shauen duely euery wéeke. But,
if when they are héere, in such a
mans house where they may say
Masse: they doo not dayly doo it,
then they sinne mortally, and for

want of some other Préest to absolue
him, he writes downe all
such sinnes as he dayly committeth,
till he may attaine vnto confession.
But neuerthelesse, himselfe
hath authoritie to reconcile,
confesse and absolue, so many of
her Maiesties Subiects as he can
win from their obedience.
            Then with them they bring
Agnus Deis,
               The Popes Merchandise, that his Commissioners bring with them into England. hallowed Grana, and
Beades, sanctified Images, holy
Gyrdles come from S. Peeters
Chayre, Crosses and Medalles,
and a number of such paltryes.
            The Agnus Dei, is included
within a case made fit for the purpose,
and the vertue of it is, that
the Deuill dare not come néere
him, so long as he hath it about
him, nor any sprights, or euill
motions may attempt to fraye
him: for that say they (most trayterously
and blasphemously) he
hath the very Lambe of God about
him, which is the stincking

               Agnus Dei, made of War, chrisma,
spittle, salte, Oyle, and such
trumperies, whereof I haue séene
aboundance made in the Popes
Pallace, and they be nothing
worthe, till he haue sayd a fewe
Enchaunting woords ouer them,
where they stād great Chests ful,
Sackes and Baskets. Yet they
allow no holynesse to the Chest,
Basket or Sack, which receiueth
as much blessing as they.
            It were too tedious to discourse
héere, the manner and order of all
these 
                  •
               ables: wherefore I referre
you to a booke, which by the grace
of God shall come foorth shortly,
intituled, The English Romaine
life.
            
            Wherein, our Englishmen,
and theyr order of life, shall be
truely and not malliciously reported:
with so many of theyr
Popish knaueries discouered, as
I know will mooue some bothe to
laugh and lament.
            
               
To laugh, in that their dealinges
are so ridiculous and foolishe: and
to lament, in that they wyll be
gouerned by so vaine imaginations.
            When they are thus arriued in
Englande,Their own confession, howe they behaue them selues, when they come into England. they dispearce them
selues into such places, where
they thinke them selues to be surest:
some in one place, some in an
other.
            And disguising them selues
lyke Gentlemen, Seruingmen,
or what Apparell they maye
fynde méetest for them: they
haue accesse to many and sundrie
places, where hauing reconciled
some, theyr fréendes must
lykewise be of the same stampe,
and so, what from Father to
Sonne, Husband and Wife, Kinsmen
and acquaintance, a number
are seduced & brought into theyr
detestable dealinges.
            For, after they haue gotten any
lyttle grounde within them to

builde vppon, then doo they laye
vnto them, what a generall blooddy
daye is toward England, that
the Pope & other forraine Princes
haue fullye determined to ouer
runne the Realme: then better
it wer

                for you (say they) to
yéelde your selues willingly, then
to sée so horrible a slaughter, bothe
of your Princesse, and all that
dare presume to take her parte.
            Your selues, yea, and your freends
shall abyde the same harde iudgement,
except you ioyne with vs
in this action. Thus through terrifying,
and a thousande Traiterous
fetches they haue: one fréend
bringeth an other, and one Kinsman
an other: so that, as they
them selues wyll make theyr
boast, in shorte tyme they doubte
not to haue the moste parte of all
Englād, yea, and farder they presume,
that her Maiestie thinking
her selfe in most safetie, shall then
be soonest of all deceyued.

Antecedent, nowe let vs haue the
Ergo.
            
            With this continuall course of
holdnesse and impudencie, Maister
Campion and his fellowes
would graunt nothing, but stiflie
denied euerie cause: and Maister
Campion, he tooke it for a custom,
to wrest euerie thing as pleased

him, saying: That y• Iewrie were
not men learned,When he had no other shift, he fell into these woords. & therefore causes
of conscience ought to be committed
to them, neither was that
barre appointed to define on causes
of conscience: wherefore, all
that you doo (sayeth he) is but to

After this order he deluded y•
people, appealing styll on the deuoutnesse
of his cōscience: because
he sawe the matter brought to the
verie pushe, that would generallie
conuicte them all, for the witnesses

should haue this man of Honours

there wanted nothing but
the comming ouer, of such Préests
and other, as were long looked
for.
            Upon this report, this aforenaned
George Elliot, tooke occasion
to question with this Payne, how
they could finde in their hearts to
attempt an act of so great and horrible
crueltie, considering howe
highe an offence it shoulde be to

made aunswere, that the kylling
her Maiestie was no offence to
God, nor the vttermost crueltie
they coulde vse to her, or any that
tooke her parte: but that they
might as lawfully doo it, as to a
brute Beast, and him selfe would
be one of the formost in the executing
this vilainous and most traiterous
action.
            
               
By this you may perceiue,
that the death of her Maiestie,No

and ouerthrowe of this Realme,
was thorowlye agréede vpon,
and fully determined: there
wanted nothing but opportunity,
for Préestes bothe then
and since, came ouer continually,
to farther it, so much as in
them laye.
            Now that you may be perfectly
resolued, that this was a generall
determination of our Englishmen,
dispersed beyond the
Seas, that this bloody slaughter
and great day, as they called it
themselues, was especially prouided
for, and that bothe Campion,
and the rest of his Complices▪
came all onely ouer for this intent:
marke this which I shall
now deliuer vnto you, wherein
you shall perceiue the full issue
of the matter.
            At what time, I my selfe
went ouer, accompanyed with

one Thomas Nowell, whom I
left at Roome, vowed to be a
Préeste, and to remayne there
among them: when we came
to Amiens in Fraunce, wee

                  •
               ounde an olde English Préest,
lying there, named Maister
Woodwarde, of whom I could
reporte, more then I will doo
at this present, because I will
declare things more at large in
my other Booke.
            This Préest,This Preest was the first, that euer I heard to name the treason. hauing my fellowe
and me alone in his Chamber,
began to open to vs the
imminent daunger towardes
our Countrey of England: which
he feared would bee vtterlye
wasted and spoyled ere long,
yea, her Maiestie, and all that
durst take vpon them to defend
her.
            For (quoth he) the Popes
holynesse oweth them a payment,
which ere long they shall
féele, and that surelie.
            
               
And trust me (quoth he) this is
the happiest déede that euer you
did in all your life, to come from
thence, leauing them to the terrible
iudgement which is towards
them, and I would your parents
and fréends were héere with you,
not to endure that gréeuous extremitie.
As for your twaine, the
best counsell that I can giue you,
is to enter into Préesthood, and so
you may be able to benefit your
Countrey an other day: because
it is to be doubted, that there will
be great want of men of the
Church there.
            If you can conforme your selues
to enter into this holy and blessed
kinde of life: I will direct you not
farre hence, to a place called
Rheimes,
               In my other Booke, you shall vnderstand more. where you shall be entertained,
among a goodly number
of our owne Countreymen,
who liue there onely for this purpose.
            We made promise to doo as he

had willed vs, but we deceiued
his expectation: as because the
matter is not incident to this
place, I leaue to be discouered in
my other Booke.
            At Paris we heard the verye
same matter of daunger to be toward
England and her Maiestie:
the Englishmen there,The Englishmen at Paris, rehearsed the same matter that the Preest had doone. discoursed
it, euen as we had heard by the
Préest at Amiens.
            
            At Lions, we vnderstood héerof
againe, reported by one of
them now condemned, named
Henrie Orton,
               
                  Henrie Orton, lying in the house of one Maister Deacon, ga
                     •
                  e foorth notice of the former matter. Gent. he sayd that
her Maiestie was no lawfull
Quéene, but an vsurper, and that
as Iezabell was serued: euen so
should she ere long be vsed, when
the chéefe matter went forwarde
in England. And to his companion
he sayde, that he vnderstood
there were Préests appointed for
England, and because he sawe
that I gaue out some crosse
woords, of misliking that he had

sayd: he set his Boye to picke
quarrels with me, to the end, that
if I would haue quarrelled againe,
he might haue doone me
some mischéefe by the way, for he
liked euery bodyes company better
thine mine.
            Yet when I iustified this to
his face at the Barre: he would
not know me, but desired my
Lorde to examine me where I
knewe him. Then vpon my opening
of time, place, and other tokens,
he began to deny all, that it
was in no point true which I
had sayd.

allowed the Popes Scholler, and

as at euery remembraunce,
my heart dooth bléede to thinke
vpon them.
            Quoth one of them▪ there is
a Rod in prouiding, that shall
rouse that presumptuous Iezabell
               
(meaning our moste Gratious
Princesse) out of her vsurped authoritie,Their only delight to 
                     〈◊〉

                     •
                  ayle against her Maiestie, and her honorable Counsell, to whom they giue such names, as modestie will not suffer me to reporte.
which she hath so long
time held, to our no little gréefe,
and then looke how Iezabell was
serued: euen so shall she be, yea,
wurse if wurse may be: oh moste
traiterous woords, yet there passing
euery mans mouthe with
great laughter and ioy.
            Quoth an other to me, you
may be happy, if God take you
out of this world héere: then shall
you neuer sée the bloody ruine of
your owne Countrye, which
will be shortlye, and sooner then
some of them lookes for: wherefore,
if you haue any fréendes in
England, which you doubt to be
fallen from the faithe, and take
parte in that abhominable Religion:
send to them so soone as you
can, that they may goe to some of
our Préests, there labouring about
the chéefe cause, to be reconciled
by them, and so to conforme

their liues a new.
            And then they will deliuer
them certayne Grana Benedicta,
               Tokens appointed to passe among them, when this great day shall come, which they hope for.
that is appointed by the Popes
holinesse for them, or els the
watch word Iesus Maria: for béeing
founde without these two,
they will be destroyed, as all the
rest shall be, that are not so prouided.
Now they meane to deale
surelie, because they haue sundry
wayes attempted, yet still haue
béene deceiued, and therefore they
haue appoynted a great daye,
when as the generall hauocke
shall be made thorowe all England.

trayterous spéeches vsed
among the Schollers themselues,
whereto they are imboldened
by these and such lyke perswaders,
whereof the Pope hath
good store.

dare take vppon them, to fulfyll
themselues by their owne hands,
vpon her Maiesties moste royall

they shall not report, that in
concealing theyr spéeches (which
for the odious and abhominable
tearmes I ought to doo) I am
not therefore able to charge them
with any: I wyll (my humilitie
and duety to her Maiestie, and the
honorable Personages cōsidered)
reueale ye woords of one or two of
them, which although it be most
horrible and trayterous, yet is it
the simplest that I heard vsed among
them.
            It chaunced,By this, which is the simplest of all theyr trayterous intentes: iudge howe horrible the other be. that one daye I
walked with two or thrée of the
Schollers, to a place without
Roome, called Petro Montorium,
where (as they say) Saint Peeter
was martyred: and by the way as
we went, we fell in our accustomed
talke, about the procéeding of
matters in Englande. Among
which talke, they entred into appointment
& determination with
them selues, if all other thinges
fayled, as they had good hope they

woulde not: what eche of them
woulde doo, to accomplishe the
Popes long desire.
            Quoth one of them, whyle two
or thrée persons be a liue, we may
stande in doubte of our matter in
England.
            Who be they (quoth I) héere I

            Oh (quoth he) had I the hearts
of these in my Purse, and theyr
headdes in the Popes holynesse

ere long, wée should all merilie

infourmed, that shée shall

            Then woulde I fayne to giue

would, in the remembraunce of
me, both giue foorth Indulgences,
and a notable benediction: which
should be called after my name, as
the benediction for the Quéene of
Scottes is, and those that were giuen
for Stukely, the Bishoppe of
Corke, Doctour Allen, and diuers
other. Then when any shall haue
of my Grana, Crosses, Medalles,
and Beades, they wyll say: these
were blessed for such a one, that

dyd bring to passe in Englande,
what coulde not be done in many
yéeres before, & then my Beades
shall be prayed vpon more then
any other.
            Beside, my Indulgences should
be Plenaria for euer, I shoulde
haue remission of all my sinnes,
Masses continually sayd for me, &
all my Coūtrey and fréends haue

            I perceyue (quoth he to mee)
you haue but a slender staye of
your Faith, that would feare to
doo such a good déede for your Coū
               trey:
where through, your
same would be registred for euer▪
bothe in our Martirilogium,
               It is not possible for vs to imagine so yll, as they doo daily report. as
diuers of our Countrey are, and
also through the whole world.
            A great deale more talke they
had, so trayterous and horrible:

that no godlie and vertuous minded,
can suffer to heare it.
            So when wée came to the Seminarie
againe, because I had
béene there but a whyle, the same
partie brought me theyr Martirilogium:
wherein hee read to
me the execution of the two Nortons,
the death of Doctour Storie,
and the Martyrdome of Iohn
Felton, and other, altogeather
Imprinted in a great Booke
of theyr Sayntes and Martyrs.
            The least report of these traytours,
which they had there Canonized
for Martyres of theyr
Churche, contayned 
                  〈◊〉
                or
eyght shéetes in Folio, 
                  〈◊〉
               
of a verie small Letter: but
in no poynt true, because I
knewe my selfe the contrarie,
for that before I went ouer,
I sawe the execution of them
all.
            
               
There were diuers other of
their Martirs, the discourses of
their liues and deathes reserued
there to be imprinted in the same
Booke: as of Barlowe, Madder,
Wilkinson, the Iaylor of Yorke,
Sherwood and Nelson, sometime
Sexton of the English Church in
Roome, all these executed at Tiborne
for high Treason, and there
estéemed for their Martires.
            
               William Filbie, at the Barre
would chalēge me, that there was
no such Booke there: when I am
sure, not one of the other will attempt
to deny it, if they should,
they be héere in the Cittie that
are able to disprooue them.
            A number of such like trayterous
spéeches and practises, which
on my owne knowledge I am
able to report, but to auoyde tediousnes,
as also not to offend any
chaste and discréete minde, I let
them passe in silence, desiring pardon
for that which I haue alreadie

set downe. And now you may
perceyue, what affection these
fellowes, afforde theyr lawfull
Quéene and Countrey: well is he
that can imagine most against her
Maiestie, and highlie is he estéemed
that beareth the most trayterous
hart to her.

rest of his fellowes, they pleade
ignorance in all these causes, they
bolster vp one another with large
protestations, rayling woordes,
and subtyll surmises: affyrming
that they were not sent hyther for
any such intent, which is as vntrue,
as we knowe it for trueth,
that the Lord God lyueth in Heauen.
            For this I am able to saye my
selfe▪ that both then and at diuers
other tymes, it was whispered
among them in the Seminarie:
that shortlie there shoulde bée
Préestes appointed for England,
to winne the people against the

appoynted tyme, when as a great
Armie shoulde be ready to ioyne
with them: and Maister Campion,
who was then at Praga
in Bohemia, hee was spoken off
amongst them all, to be a rare
and singuler fellowe, and therefore
generallie was taken for a
méete man, to bée sent about
such a Message, so that they
iudged that he should be sent for,
to be a cheefe man in this matter.

I finde not to be deserued, and
it maye be that I was appointed
to be sent into Englande, according
as those other Préestes
were, for the sauing of Soules,
and benefite of my Countreye:
must it followe then, that wée
are sent to practise the death of
the Quéene, and to séeke the ruine

of our Countrey?
            Alas, this is a harde case, and
I desyre you of the Iewrie, to
marke it, for these are but shadowes
without any substaunce.
            This you are to note, that we
which enter into that blessed societie
of the Iesuites:
               A holy kinde of life▪ were it not for the B. we doo, as
it were, forsake the worlde, vowing
our selues to chastitie, and
sinceritie of conscience, to obeye
our Superiours, and to be ready
to goe whether they shall appoint
vs.
            If they send vs to the Indiaes,
or to any such places, where
the people haue not the true Catholique
Faith: we are bound
by duetie in Conscience, to goe
whether they appoint vs.
            And shall it then be sayde, that
wée come for the destruction
of the Prince and Countreye,
where wee settle our selues?
Alas, that were a harde case,

for Christian charitie wylleth vs
to comfort one an other,Note heere the perfect Image of hypocrisie. and if
we can, to gette the Shéepe into
the Folde, which hath long runne
a straye. And when we heare confession,
we doo not perswade them
to any disobedience, for that is against
the nature of Confession:
God forbyd that wée should once
thinke any such thing.
            Beholde the subtyll shifts, that
he found out still to flie vnto, yea,
though the manifest disproofe laye
before them, yet would he finde
some cauill or other: for not onely
the euidence of their generall determination
beyonde the Seas,
was showen them, but also the
trayterous Articles were there
read vnto them,

had coppyed out for Doctour Allen
(concerning the procéeding of
these trayterous causes, and for
which hee went purposelie to
Roome to confer with the Pope
about) and subscribed vnto, that

they were certayne and true: as
also theyr owne confessions and
writings were layde open before
them, approouing them notablie

One Maister Cradocke a Merchaunt,

            And farder,A Booke which they vse as theyr instruction howe to aunswere to euerie question Sophistically. there was a lyttle
Booke in Latine, which they
them selues brought ouer with
them, it was there openly read
vnto them: wherein was certayne
rules and orders prescribed,
howe they should behaue
them selues héere in Englande,
and howe if they were demaunded
of any thing, they shoulde
make aunswere indyrectlie: or
to take the woorde it selfe, according
as it is mentioned in
the Booke, they must aunswere
Sophisticae, whereby is
meant as thus.
            If they be examined, as concerning
theyr allegeaunce to her

Maiestie: they wyll make theyr
aunswere after this manner.
Shée is our lawfull Soueraigne
Lady and Quéene, and we doo obey
her.
            But then obiect vnto them: wil
you obeye her, notwithstanding

any thing that he commaundeth

they might mooue our Maiestrates
to haue a good oppinion of thē,
and not to deale so strictly, as
lawe and their deseruing dooth
worthily merit: then they might
with lesse suspect goe about their
holy Fathers busines, in that
their Sophisticall aunswers, couered
so foule an abuse.
            And then so many as comes after
them, purposely sent about the
same affaires, séeing their passage
made before them, and béeing
Schooled after the same manner:
they might withdrawe the harts
of a number her Maiesties Subiectes,
by such meanes as is before
largely expressed, so that destruction
should come vpon vs, before
we had discouered their treatcherous
dealings.
            But God be thanked, as all
their deuises haue had their deserued
successe, this Sophisticall
order hath sped a like with them
for company: and this let them

fully assure themselues, that what
meanes soeuer they seeke against
their Princesse and Countrey,
God will rewarde them after
their owne dealings.
            To Campion himselfe,
                  Campion his owne answer, as concerning his allegeaunce to her Maiestie. the former
questions were put foorth at
the Barre: and this aunswer he
made vnto them.
            She is my lawfull Soueraigne
Lady and Quéene, and I doo obey
her.
            But when he was demaunded,
although the Pope did expreslye
commaund him the contrary: if
he would neuerthelesse faithfully
obey her.
            Oh then they must not so déeply
enter into his conscience, that
Barre was not a Barre to define
on causes of conscience: that
question touched his conscience,
wherefore he flatly sayd he might
not aunswer it. No, no, he knew
full well, that the trayterous affayres
he came about, would not

allowe him such a direct aunswer
as they looked for, & gladly would
haue had, that of a Saule, they
might haue made him a Paule.
Wherfore his secret and guileful
behauiour, made perfect apparaunce
of his wicked intent:
which hee shaddowed vnder the
counterfeit cloke of sauing soules,
and reconciling his Countreymē
to the Catholique faith.
            Héer it cannot be greatly amisse
to rehearse vnto you the cause,The cause why this Pope hath tollerated the former Bull of Pius Quintus
               
why this Pope hath tollerated
the former Bull, séeing this Sophisticall
kinde of aunswering
grew chéefely therby. Whē any of
these secret messengers, should be
sēt about their holy fathers determination,
héere in England, to recōcile,
shriue & win her Maiesties
Subiects to their deuillish intent:
if such misaduenture should happen
to thē, ye their secret dealings
came to the eares of Iustice, then
they fel into the daunger of lawe,

wherefore, to shaddow their subtiltie,
and to prosecute the effect of
their message, the Pope thought
good to harten them by this Sophisticall
addition.
            For well we know, and themselues
likewise are not ignorant
thereof, that béeing examined, if
they should denye the Quéenes
Maiestie, to be their Supreme
Princesse and Gouernesse, in all
causes: then they fell into condemnation
by her lawes.
            Againe, if they denyed the authoritie
of the Pope, as of force
they must needes doo, if they will
estéeme themselues good subiects,
and manifest a duetifull and obedient
hart to her Maiestie: then
they breake their vowe made to
the Pope, and so fall into his
cursse and condemnation likewise,
so that this is certainely appointed
them, to cleaue faithfully
to the one, and vtterly to forsake
the other.
            
               
Yet that they might haue as
much fauoure and fréendship, as
the furtheraunce of such a cause
required: this hard clause (béeing
well scanned of diuers our English
Doctors and other,Our English Doctors conferring with the Cardinalles found out the meane for this tolleration. bothe at
Roome and at Rheimes, was
through earnest sute, deliuered
to diuers of the Cardinalles, who
laying theyr heads together, and
thorowly searching the bottome
of euery doubt: a tolleration for
that strict point was found out,
which was ordayned as you haue
hearde before.
            Then in all the haste the Pope
was giuen to vnderstande thereof,
who respecting what might
be for his benefit, and what
might turne to his discommoditie:
authorised them this former
tolleration, which God be
thanked, carryed as slender
strength as the rest of his practises
hath doone.
            Yet all this béeing knowne

to vs, Maister Campion and his
fellowes will graunt no knowledge:
but pleadeth still theyr deuoute
consciences.
            An other of their owne Bookes
was there read vnto them,Another Booke how to handle all manner of persons to win them to their intent. wherin
was other orders prescribed
them, how they should handle a
Noble man, how a Gentleman,
and how a poore man: which béeing
openly read before them,
gaue all there present to vnderstande,
howe assuredly they
had appointed the course for their
Treason.
            A number of inuincible proofes
passing against them, they came
at laste to the point of their comming
ouer: how suddainely, how
hastily, and all through a generall
appoyntement.
            Maister Campion,
               Maister Campion sent for frō 
                  Praga to goe with other Preestes appointed for England. hee had
stayed a longe time at Praga in
Bohemia, and on a sudden he
was hastily sent for to Roome:
               
by his owne confession hee
knewe not wherefore, but the
message was in suche haste,
that he must come thether with
all spéede.
            When he came to Roome, he
stayed there but fiue dayes: in
which time, receyuing the
summe of their charge, from
the Pope, as is their vsuall
wunte, and their Father
Generall deliuering them what
hee hath in office: hee was
dispatched from thence with
other Préestes, who had their
Viaticum from the Popes
Treasurie, and were all especyally
appoynted for England.
            These Préestes were sent
(as all other are) about the
chéefe cause,The Preestes are there only maintained for this purpose, and none come from thence, but about this cau
                     •
                  e, which prooueth them all together guiltie. for that none
come from thence but onely for
that purpose: the estate of
the cause before expressed,

it is too mani
                  •
               est, that Campion
and his fellowes are guiltie of
the matters obiected againste
them.
            For this you are to remember,
that none must staye there
without they will be Préestes,
when they receiue their Préestehood,
they enter into theyr oath,
which oath contayneth the sum
of the Treason: so that all which
come from thence (hauing taken
that oath) come about the
execution of the Treason, in
that▪ none but they that are especially
sent, can haue theyr
Viaticum of the Pope, and then
he sending them, the case is too
euident.
            Let not a light iudgement passe
ouer a matter of so great respect,
let the Popes intent of kéeping
them there be considered, the
great mallice and spight that he
beareth her Maiestie and the
Realme, and then theyr oath to

execute his commaundementes,
all these layde together, discouereth
the depthe of theyr tretcherie.
            But what aunswereth Maister
Campion to this?Maister Campion graunteth, he came as the other Preests did to reconcyle and shriue: but he wyll not allowe that he came for any treason. he confesseth
that he was quietlie setled at Praga,
and lyttle expected any such
hastie sending for, besyde, that
hée went to Roome, with great
spéede, tarrying there no longer
then fiue dayes, as is before expressed,
and that hée receyued his
Viaticum of the Pope, when as
hée was dispatched thence with
other Préestes, purposelie appointed
for England, and that hée
came no otherwise then they dyd,
nor for any other intent, then
for the benefite of Soules, as he
styll termed it: but he would not
graunt that he came for any treason.
            So that to seduce her Maiesties
Subiectes, to perswade them
from theyr duetie and obedience,

and to ioy
                  •
               e them selues in such
sorte, as theyr Princesse and
Countreye muste be destroyed
thereby: this is no Treason
in his oppinion, Maister Campion
and his fellowes pleaded ignoraunce
styll, they sawe and
would not sée, they were so craftilie
schooled.
            
               Iames Bosgraue,
               
                  Iames Bosgraue, his hastie comming from Vilna, when he heard that Preestes were appointed for England. he was at Vilna
in Polonia, and as he confessed
him selfe, he vnderstoode
that there was Préestes appointed
for Englande: vpon which
report he came away from thence
in verie great haste.
            And in his passage, he mentioned
to one in the Shippe, who
was sworne, and confessed the
same before certayne Iustices,
that there was such matters toward
in Englande, as hath béene
before expressed: and therevpon
he sought to haue wunne him, if
his purpose could haue taken effect.
            
               
Maister Campion séeing this
begunne somewhat to touche the
quicke, and that in trueth it
discouered the dealinges of them
all: he taketh vppon him to aunswere
on his behalfe, for that
they all reposed them selues on
him.
            He sayth,Maister Campion frequenteth his accustomed order of subtyll answering. that if Bosgraue did
heare such newes, that there
were Préests appointed for Englande:
why shoulde they take
holde on so small a cause? Flying
reportes are not to bée credited,
for albeit he heard such
newes, howe knewe he, if they
were certain
                  •
                or no?
            Againe (quoth hée) the
man hath béene longe out of
Englande, and hee dooth not
speake the Englishe perfectlie:
it maye bee then, that some
woorde maye escape him vnawares,
whiche you are not
to buylde vppon, consydering

the defecte of the man, for
he maye peraduenture speake he
knoweth not what.
            And where you say, that such a
one hath auouched before certaine
Iustices, that he vsed such and
such woordes to him: where is
the man, we are not to credite a
written Paper, what knowe
we if it be true or no? let vs heare
him selfe say so, and then we wyll
beléeue it.
            S
                  •
               e what a number of shyftes
he had continuallie,Traytours wyll neuer beleeue any trueth, especiallie, if it touch them selues. to waste the
the tyme, and all to no purpose:
the mans owne confession was
there, whereto him selfe had
subscribed, and fowre or fiue Iustices
sette theyr handes to it, for
the certayntie thereof, yet this
was not sufficient to aunswere
them.
            
               Robert Iohnson, he was lykewise
at Auinion in Fraunce,
               
                  Robert Iohnson, his comming from from
whence hee came also in verie
great haste, vppon the report he

had heard,Auinion in Fraunce. of Préestes that were
appointed for England.
            Nowe there is an other thing
to be considered, that these men,
setled where they were, by theyr
owne confession they muste not
departe from thence, without
they be appointed by theyr Superiours:
then it is easie to
be aunswered, that they came
by theyr Superiours appoyntment
at this present, and as
the generall determination was,
so they came all, for one cause and
intent.
            
               Edwarde Bishton, hée béeing
héere in Englande,
                  Edwarde Bishtons Letter, to Richardson one of the condemned. wrote a Letter
to Richardson a Préest, and
who is lykewise condempned amongste
them: which Letter
was there openlye read to his
face.
            How there were foure Goldsmithes
of his occupation latelie
come ouer, who in déede were

Préestes, and howe all thinges
went successiuelie foreward.
            And Maister Campion, béeing
in the Tower,Maister Campions Letter to Master Pownde in the Tower. wrote a Letter
to Maister Pownde there lykewise,
wherein he gaue him to
vnderstande, that he was verie
sorie, that through his frayltie
he had bewrayed those, at whose
houses he had béene so, fréendlie
entertayned: wherefore he asked
God hartilie forgiuenesse, and
them all whome he had so highlie
offended.
            But (sayeth he) as for the
chéefe matter,Maister Campion was resolut
                     •
                   in the cheefe matter. that is as yet vnreuealed:
and come Racke, come
Rope, neuer shall that be discouered.
            A number of matters more
were brought against them,
which to rehearse, woulde require
a farre more large discourse:
but to be breese, in
the ende this was the full and

certayne issue.
            That these men, when they
were beyonde the Seas, the generall
agréement and determinatiō
amongst them: was to worke
the death of our moste gratious
Princesse, to destroye her Dominion,
and to erecte suche
as pleased them, when this aforesayde
great daye should take
effect.
            And that theyr comming ouer,
was to seduce her loouing Subiectes,
to winne their obedient
heartes from her: so that they
should be in a readinesse to ioyne
with a forraine power, and so
they shoulde lykewise be destroyers
of theyr Princesse and Countrey.
And that in the meane
whyle, they them selues sought
to accomplishe her Maiesties
death, so muche as in them
laye.
            This was manifestly prooued,
by verie large and ample euidence,

credible witnesses, and
their owne confessions and writinges:
whereon the Iewrie hauing
wisely and discréetlie pondered,
and searched and séen into the
depth of euerie cause, woorthilie
and deseruedlie gaue them vp all
guiltie, of the Treasons whereof
they were endighted and arraigned.
            Which béeing done, after a godlie
and comfortable exhortation,
perswading them patientlie to
suffer, & abide the death for them
appointed, and to be hartilie sorie
for their gréeuous and hainous offences:
the sentence of death was
pronounced on them.
            That they should depart to the
places from whence they came,
and from thence to be drawne on
Hurdles to the place of execution,
where they should be hanged tyll
they were halfe dead, then to be
cutte downe, their priuie members
to be cutte off, and theyr

entrayles taken foorth, and to be
burned in the fire before their
eyes: then theyr heads to be cut
off, their bodies parted into foure
quarters, to be disposed at her
Maiesties pleasure, and the Lord
God to receiue theyr soules to his
mercie.
            Afterwarde they were conuayed
from thence with Boates, to a
place of landing for them appointed,
from whence they were conducted
to the Tower of London,
diuers of them giuing foorth sundry
wicked and dishonest spéeches:
as Thomas Cotehan, séeing
so many people to beholde them,
desired that fyre and Brimstone
might fall from Heauen, to destroy
bothe the Citty, and all that
were in it: with diuers other wicked
woords, which for modesties
sake I omit héere to rehearse, desiring
God in mercy to remember
them all, and to forgiue their
soules, their bodyes misdéedes.
            
               
ON the next day, béeing Tuesday,
and the xxi. of Nouember,
there was brought to the sayde
high Barre these persons following.
Iohn Hart, Thomas Foord,
William Filbie, Lawrance Richardson,
Iohn Shert, Alexander
Brian, and Iohn Collington.
            
            
               Alexander Brian,
               A very holy thing, but very meete for his de
                  
                     ••
                  tien, he had shauen
his Crowne himselfe, and made
him a Crosse of a péece of a trentcher,
which he held in his hand
openly and prayed to: which whē
he was rebuked for, he boldly and
stoutely made aunswer. That
his Crowne was of his owne
shauing, and he had good hope to
doo it againe.
            In bréefe, they were all endited
on the selfe same treasons as the
other were the day before, and
Iohn Hart, his trayterous Sermon
which he made at Rheimes
against her Maiestie auouched to
his face: their owne writings and
confessions, with 
                  〈◊〉
                witnesse

produced against them: so
that they were founde guiltie of
the treasons, as the other were
before them, except Iohn Collington,
he was quit of the former
high Treason by the Iewrie.
            Thus in breefe I haue certified
you, of the Treasons which
Campion and his confederates,
conspired and practised against
her Maiestie and the Realme,
howe they were manifestly conuicted
of euery cause, and notably
approoued guiltie, notwithstanding
all theyr cullored surmises.
I beséech God long to preserue
her Maiestie and this Realme,
and all that beare like false harts
as these did, that he will either
turne their harts, or cut off
their trayterous and
deuillish deuises.
            FINIS.
         
         
            
            
            A breefe Discourse,
concerning the deathes
of Edmund Campion, Iesuit,
Raphe Sherwin, and Alexander
Brian, Seminarie Preestes:
A raigned and condemned for
high Treason, and executed
for the same, at Tiborne,
on Friday, beeing the
1. of December.
1581.
            
               
                  ON Friday, beeing
the 1. of December,
Edmund Campion
Iesuit, and
Raphe Sherwin,
and Alexander Brian, Seminarie
Préestes, béeing condemned for
high Treason, against her Maiesties
moste royall person, as also
for Trayterous practises, touching
the subuersion of the true

and vndoubted Religion héere
maintained, with the vtter ruine
and ouerthrowe of this Realme
of England: were drawne from
the Towre of London on Hurdles,
to the place of execution appointed,
béeing garded with such
a sufficient company, as might expresse
the honour of Iustice the
larger in that behalfe.
            Béeing come to the place of execution,
where diuers of her Maiesties
Honorable Counsell, with
many honourable Personages,
and Gentlemen of worship and
good account, beside a multitude
of people, not héer to be numbred,
attended their cōming: Edmund
Campion was firste brought vp
into the Cart, where, after the
great rumor of so many people
somewhat appeased, he began to
proceede in his confession.
            Firste he began with a phrase
or two in Lattin, when seene
after hee sell into Englishe as

thus.
            I am héere brought as a Spectacle,
before the face of God, of
Angelles and of men, satisfying
my selfe to dye, as becommeth a
true Christian and Catholique
man.
            As for the Treasons which
haue beene layde to my charge,
and I am come héere to suffer
for: I desire you all to beare
witnesse with me, that thereof I
am altogether innocent.
            Wherevpon, aunswer was
made to him by one of the Coun
               
                  •
               ell,
that he might not séeme to
deny the obiections agaynst him,
hauing béene prooued so manifestly
to his face, bothe by
sufficient witnesse and euidence.
            Well my Lorde (quothe
he) I am a Catholique man
and a Préeste, in that faithe
haue I liued hytherto, and in
that faithe I doo intend so dye,

and if you estéeme my religion
Treason, then of force I must
graunt vnto you as for any other
Treason, I will not consent vnto.
            Then was hee mooued as concerning
his Trayterous and haynous
offence to the Quéenes
moste excellent Maiestie: whereto
he aunswered: Shée is my lawfull
Princesse and Quéene, there
somewhat he drew in his woords
to himselfe, whereby was gathered,
that somewhat hee would
haue gladly spoken, but the great
timeritie and vnstable oppinion
of his conscience, wherein he was
all the time, euen to the death,
would not suffer him to vtter it.
            Héere is with iudgement, a
déepe point and high matter to be
cōsidered, that this man, alwayes
directing the course of his life to
a vaine glorious imagination,
and alwayes couetous to make
himselfe famous: at this instant

made a perfect discouerie of himselfe.
            For béeing somewhat learned,
all matters whatsoeuer, as you
haue heard before, he bare away
with a magesticall countenaunce,
the visor of vanitie, aptly fitting
the face of onely hipocrisie: what
was sounde he would make Sophisticall,
what was the infallible
trueth of it selfe, he would
carry in his own conceit, and delude
the people with a pleasant
quirk, or some such stuffe, onely
to purchase him credit and affection.
            And he was not to learne, to
set a couragious countenaunce on
euery such slight reason: whereby
he peruerted many, deceyued
more, and was thought suche a
Champion, as the Pope neuer
had the like.
            But nowe beholde the man,
whom neyther Racke nor Rope
should alter, whose faithe was

such as he boasted inuincible: feare
had caught holde on this braue
boaster, and terrour entred his
thoughtes, whereby was discouered
his impudent dissimulations.
            Nowe let it with patience bée
mooued a lyttle, that the outward
protestations of this man, vrged
some there present to teares, not
entring into conceyte of his inward
hipocrisie: to make a plausible
definition of this perillous
deceiuer, not by coniecture, but
by proofe it shall be thus aunswered.
            
               Edmund Campion, as it is by
men of sufficient credit reported,
at what tyme he spent his studie
héere in Englande, bothe in the
Hospital, and also at the vniuersitie
of Oxenford: was alwaies addicted
to a meruailous suppose in
himselfe, of ripe iudgement, prōpt
audacitie, & cunning conueyaunce
in his Schoole pointes, wherethrough,

he fell into a prowde and
vaineglorious iudgement, practising
to be eloquent in phrase, and
so fine in his quirkes and fantasticall
coniectures: that the ignorant
he wun by his smoothe deuises,
some other affecting his pleasaunt
imaginations, he charmed
with subtilitie, and choaked with
Sophistrie.
            The learned, who behelde his
practises and peremptory order of
lyfe, pittying his follie, & wishing
him a more stayed determination:
loathed his manners, yet
looued the man, because Christian
Charitie wylled them so to
doo.
            Nowe this glorious Thraso, hauing
by his Lybeiles made him
selfe famous, and vnder shewe
and suppose of great learning,
(though in deede béeing approoued,
found verie simple, to the spéeches
giuen of him) subdued many
to affecte him verie much:

when he was taken, he knew it
stoode him vpon, not to loose the
credit opēly he had wun secretly,
wherefore in his former ridiculous
manner, bothe in Prison, at
his Araignement, yea, and at his
death, he continued the same in
all points, which the foulnes of
his Treasons blemished euery
way.
            Now indéede, as our English
nation is bothe loouing and pittifull:
so, many séeing the giftes of
God, so well bestowed on the
man, and by him applyed to so
great abuse, through naturall
kindnesse bemoned his case, wishing
be had not fallen in so traiterous
a cause.
            This poynt, least some should
haue vsed to a wurse coniecture,
I thought good in bréefe somewhat
to manifest.
            Then was mooued to him againe
his Treasons and haynous
offences against the Quéenes

Maiestie, which impudentlie he
styll denied, séeming to vtter
woordes on the behalfe of one Richardson,
one likewise of the condempned
Traitours, taking vppon
his conscience that it was not
he: which hath béene prooued to
the cōtrarie, for that it is known,
howe this Richardson is he, who
distributed Campions Libels and
Bookes abroade, & when he was
put to his oath, whether it was he
or no, he refused to sweare on his
behalfe.
            Pray with them in Englishe,
as he was desired, he would not,
but sayde his Pater noster in Latin,
& desired all those of the householde
of Faith, to saye one Credo
for him.
            Many indirect aunsweres he
made, as when he was mooued to
aske the Quéene forgiuenesse, and
when the Preacher requested him
to shewe some signe of a penitent
sinner, when shortlie he replyed:

You and I, we are not of one Religion.
After a fewe silent prayers
to him selfe, the Carte was
drawen away, and he committed
to the mercie of God. There he
hanged tyll he was dead, when
béeing cut downe, he was bowelled
and quartered, according as it
was appointed by Iustice.
            
               Raphe Sherwin seemed a man of
better iudgement, more learned,
and more obedient, he sayde the
Lordes Prayer in English, beléeuing
in God that made him, in
Christe his sonne that saued him,
and in the holie Ghost that sanctified
him: and according to the saying
of S. Augustin, desired Iesus,
that he would be to him Iesus, as
much to say, as his Sauiour and
Redéemer. He lykewise confessed
him self a Catholique man, & a
Préest, intending to die in that
faith. But when the Treasons
were mooued to him, he lykewise
séemed to make deniall thereof.
            
               
He asked the Quéenes Maiestie
forgiuenesse, and desired that shée
might long liue and raigne ouer
vs. Then was read to him the
Booke of the aduertisemēt, which
before had béen read to Campion,
and after a fewe prayers he lykewise
ended his lyfe.
            
               Alexander Brian séemed more
obstinate and impious, vsing very
little signe of repentaunce, and
hartie humilitie: he vsed many
prayers to him selfe, and spake
very little woorthy the rehearsall.
Iustice béeing executed on him, he
and Sherwin were quartered,
according as Campion had
béene before them. God
graunt that the offences
of these, may be a warning
to all other.
            God saue our Queene Elizabeth.

God either turne theyr
