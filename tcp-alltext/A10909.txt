            Cum Priuilegio Regiae Maiestatis.
         
         
            
            
            To the right honourable, Syr Frauncis VValsingham, chiefe Secretary vnto the Queenes most excellent Maies
                  •
               y, and of her honorable Councell: Grace and Peace, in Christ our Lord.
            
               
                  HAuing before this, set forth a small tretise, displaing a sort of men, in this our countrey of England, imbracing an Author vnder two letters, H, and N. about sixe monethes agoe: I haue receaued since, from the same persons, sundry letters contayning matter against the doctrine publickly taught in the church of England: and answering certain matters contayned in the sayd booke, called The displaying of the Family of Loue, which answeres, some I haue put in print, the rest remayn: wherof this Libel is one of the chiefest, and as the same doth witnesse, is made and compiled by one of the chiefe of that sect, and the only man which was the occasion that any of HN his doctrine became conuersant with our natiue Countrey people, (a thing greatly to be lamented.)
            
               The name of the party is Christofer Vitel, sometime a Ioyner of London, and infected with that infamous doctrine of Airius, 
               
                  •
               0. yeares agoe▪ whose cred
                  ••
               e among the pretended Family of Loue is very great, and therefore I haue vsed more diligence in answering the same. Being (Right honorable) unboldened to present the same vnto your honor, vpō vew and tast of your good inclination toward
                  •
               s the true Church of Christ and the purging out of the same, all disorders and discords that therin groweth, or which blemisheth that beloued bride, as much as in your honor lyeth.
            And if herein I shall seeme ouer bold, or presumptuous, considering my rude and vnlearned capacity, I haue many examples, which may serue for my excuse. For, where should men (publishing error) seeke defence, but vnder the name and protection of such, as (through the Lords dispensatiō, and gift of singular wit) doe vnderstand falshood at the first sight, and haue authoritie to correct the same: and hate error and corruption, of a zeale to the glory of god, and a care of true Religion: and by rate goodnes of nature, doe loue the truth, and also sufficiently adorned with corage to defend the same.
            Accept therefore (most honorable) these my rude labors, in 
                  ••
               norable part, and geue iudgement where trueth lyeth. Accept my ser
                  •
               iceable hart, to further the glory of christ

his church, and not the simple vtterance and smal skil, with les learning, as by the handling appeareth. Also consider the prouidēce of our God, which ruleth his childrē by his beck, and hath appointed your honor as a speciall Patrone in his Church, to heare the griefe and gronings thereof, and to vnderstand and see that truth be not defaced, troden downe, or spurned at by heretickes, or wicked Atheistes, which the mixed Church is too too full of.
            And as the Lord hath made your honor to feele the sweetnes of his sonne our Sauiour: So I am perswaded that you bende your singular care, and deep consideration, that this our countrey of England, might be free from hereticks & deprauers of Christ his glory. And if it might please your honor to consider the root and ground frō whence this strange doctrin grew, the practises and meanes by which it is maintained and supported: And by this litle sayd by me, consider with all, what might be sayd against this doctrine of H N. by men of knowledge and skill. And finding the roote nothing els but singularitie, ambition, pride, and carnall liberty. The shore and pillers that vphold it, wrong application of the holy Scriptures, counterfaite shewes of piety &c. your honor shall perceiue (I dout not) how litle true reason these men haue, or sound argument to proue the particulars of their doctrine:

the body and substance being found in deede but a lumpe of olde worne heresies, newly hatcht by H N. Fidelitas, and 
                  
                     •
                  lidad, men come out of the cloudes, as they would haue the world beleeue.
            And as this doctrine hath increased and spred it selfe in many shires of this Realme. So if I should declare what euent doth follow in many places, it were scarce credible. The fountaine or foundation thereof, is the opinion that these men haue, that they keepe the law of God in euery point, as he requyreth. 
                  •
               er of commeth their doctrine of perfection, attayned vnto in this life, and as they tearme it, the beginning of immortality: then being made perfecte, they imagine themselues to be Godded with God, or incorporate to God, I will vse their own tearmes: with whom God in one being of his spirit, is hommisied, or become man.
            Now hauing once planted this doctrine, what Sathan can worke with this perswasion, is easily perceiued For when this doctrine is once beleeued, that their Elders cā
               not sinne, and whatsoeuer they commit, it cannot be sinne, because they are guyded by the spirite. And when all feare to offend, or conscience of sinne is excluded: to all boldnes and liberty to liue after our liking, a very window is opened.
            As there is no reason to maintayn this, nor truth to vphold this: So it is very necessary

that the simple people should be warned to beware of this so suttle a doctrine: which they like very well of, because their teachers and Elders, vnder pretēce of plausible precepts, delyuered to the simple at the first taste, of a godly life, which asore any thing they must imbrace: with many shewes of mortificatiō. Thē must they grow to the manly oldnes in the loue, which is that perfection which they dreame of. But the secret part of their doctrine is hid from the most parte: And all their bookes are not made cōmon to all, as containing to strong meate for weake stomaches: therfore their glas of righteousnes few must looke into, least their whole vanity, and corruption should be espyed. That booke therefore is a rare birde among this Family. And this suttlety doth Sathan worke to deceaue the simple, to keep certaine secret misteries, and doctrine, to worke admiration in the hartes of deceaued people.
            Right honorable, I haue set downe this part of their doctrine, as a tast: what other matters they maintayne, by perusing this small treat
                  •
               se, shall easely be espied: how their chiefe Elder HN. is exalted, and called a Prophet: and that his prophesies shalbe proued true: and also they account of HN. in office to be a priest, and say that through his priestes office, God will receaue all men to mercy: so that our only Lord & Sauiour, is

smally accounted of: his offices are bestowed vpon HN. These thinges, are too too absurd, Right honorable, and worthy to be buryed in silence: had not Sathā raysed vp his impes to trouble his Church with these blasphemies: agaynst which, I haue bent that poore skill, and force I haue, to displey these men, with their doctrine. There are many, Right honorable: that could better, & more learnedly haue confuted their doctrine: but it is so vayne, and childish, that simple soules, and meanely exersized in holy scripture, are sufficiently instructed by the Lord, to manifest all their abhommations.
            The simplier sort of these men, I take to be such as haue a desire to serue the Lord: and yet is their simplicitye caryed away by the Elder sort, or stronger men: conference in my opinion, is the best way to helpe the simple: which the Elder sort can no
                  •
                away withall: least their trecheryes should be espied. 
                  
                     •
                  dad, one of their writers, geueth thē such a precept in his booke, intituled a fruitfull exhortation to the Family of Loue: in 
                  •
                sextion.
            But ye shall not contend, or dispute with the blasphemers, and the tanglers about the scripture: nor with the apostates, or decliners from vs, and our good doctrine: or with the selfe conceited wife: nor yet with any of all those, that bring in variaunce, and make breach, besides our good doctrine of the seruice of Loue.
            
               It appeareth Right honorable, by this prohibition of this Elder: that conference, and disputation is forbidden them: especially the Elder sort: but the no
                  •
               ces, which are not enterid into the secret partes of their doctrine: but are caryed away with a shew of pietye, and good lyfe, which at the beginning is opened vnto thē: with fly, and suttle perswasions: that nothing els is sought at their handes, but how the man might be made persite in Christ Iesu: but after once a step be made towardes them, or a tast of this doctrin: then bookes are bestowed vpon them, which they must reade: of HN. as his exhortation, his dialog, his 
                     •
                  pistles, the exposition of the Lordes prayer, with the Articles. &c. & as they profite in these, bookes harder to digest: as the Prophesie of the spirite of Loue, a declaration of the Masse: the holy Lambe: the Gospel, or 
                     •
                  uang
                     •
                  ly of HN. &c. & last of all, the glasse of righteousnes, which few of this company haue: the other bokes more riser printed as is supposed, in Flas
                  •
               
               ders, and translated by this Libeller, into English: as he himselfe confesseth.
            And here I craue pardon, in that I haue bin ouerlong: to trouble your honor with these repeticiōs: and I would to God, that I had no occasion ministred, once to name these persons, nor this error: then should Christ his Church, nor no member in the same, haue needed to bend their study, to

publish, or manifest the same. The Lord of mercy, geue your honor all increase of fayth with the trueth of true pietye: and continue in you a zeale of Christ his Church, with a care, y• nothing but trueth be taught therein: and that the contemners thereof, may be put to silence: so as our God may be glorified: his people edified: error, and heresies subuerted, & trueth aduanced: which the Lord God graunt, for his sonne, our Sauiour Christ his sake: to whom be honor▪ and prayse, now and euer.

Looke vpon thy wonted mercies of old, although the cry of our sinnes be great before thee, yet the righteousnes of our Lord and Sauyour Christ Iesus, is greater: whom we interpose and put betweene thy iustice, and our deserts. Yea, by him we appeare with boldnes before thee this day as childrē, not as strangers, saying: O Our Father, sanctified be thy holy name. Let thy kingdome be inlarged in vs thy children.

               TO what purpose these places of holy scripture are collected, I am ignoraunt of, because they want dew explication: we know that from Sion came the law of God, and righteousnes, and truth from Ierusalem. But it doth not follow that we knew not these testimonies but by HN. his ministerye: before his new doctrine was broched, the Church of Christ was not ignoraunt of that corner stone Christ Iesus, of his holy priesthod, & of his holy sacrifice: these thinges were truly understood and knowē, although HN. had neuer written.
               Touching Christ his comming as a theefe, we know it is ment of his second comming, although you would gladly haue it to be the comming of HN. with his new blasphemyes.

                  ositenaunce to your doctrine: but if wee should examine the same by the word of the Lord, then your Loue is but pretenced. For your Loue should be knowen by louing the Lord Iesus, who loued vs first. But the loue of HN. hath besotted your hartes, who by his doctrine is enemy vnto our Lord Iesus: who onely is to be beloued.
               And for truth, you onely vse the word barely without substaūce: what trewth you vse in this your libell will appeare by reading, to euery indifferent minde: if your Loue and trueth, be no better then is here expressed, then I may well affirme that little Loue, and small truth is to be found in this your libell.

the cause that moued you, first to embrace that wicked sect of Arrius, and many yeares became a leader of many pore soules into that gulfe of mischiefe, and then to shew some reason that moued you to forsake that opinion, and imbrace this absurde impietye of HN. which so gréedely you haue chosen to satisfie your hunger, and you call it life and saluation.

Many Diuines haue studiously sought what the sin of blasphemy is, but you haue with greate ease found out the same to be who so speaketh or wryteth againste HN. or his famely: must he needes be a blasphemer? Temper your humors with more modesty for shame, els men wil thinke that your HN. hath published that of you, which cannot be found in you, which is, that when you are reuiled, taunted, or bitterly vsed, you as lambes in patience bear the same, you do euil verefie your authors words.

               IN asmuch as it hath pleased the Lord of his gratious goodnes, to make manifest vnto me (as most vnworthy) through his most holy seruice of loue, in misunderstanding ignorance & error, so haue I humbled my selfe before the Lord and his Minister HN. as the greatest sinner among sinners, desiring the Lord that he of his goodnes woulde extend his mercy ouer me, and forgeue me al my

offences, wherein I had liued contrary to his commaundementes, lawes, and ordinaunces, so that the Lord at his time when he sawe it good, through his grace released me out of my calamitye, and also made manifest vnto me, through his most holy seruice of Loue, and his elected minister HN. his promises which he made with Abraham, where through he will blesse all the generatiōs of the earth, and also how, when, and wherein they are fulfilled, &c.

how, when, and where, they are fulfilled, and made manyfest vnto you.

                  f you had ben a true Christian, you needed not HN. to manifest these thinges, they are sufficiently opened to vs in the holy historye, & by his beloued Apostle Paule: yf you had stayed your selfe with their manifestatiō, you should not haue looked for your HN. to make knowen the same: but it is to be doubted by your speach, that you meane some other comming of

Christ in this lyfe, and not when he shall come, at the general day of Christ his second comming, when he shall come with glory, maiesty, and powre to iudge the world with righteousnes. You affirme that then he shall accomplish whatsoeuer he spake by the Prophets from the beginning. The Prophets spake as they were commaunded, to kingdomes, and Cityes, certefying of the destruction determined, and the captiuities whereunto the people should be ledde: many of their Prophesyes confirmed the comming of Christ &c. which are alredy come to passe.

make the rebelliō, and are cause of the dissention and disobedience to spiritual and temporall gouernors. And further you saw no peace should be on earth, or continue without the seruice of loue. The doutfull significatiō of this word Loue is often confounded amōg your Familie, sometime you woulde haue it taken for God, sometime for Christ, and sometime for your wholl doctrine and profession, and sometime for a property or vertue proceeding frō God: but to take it simply as I thinke you mean it for the order and manner of your doctrine and seruice of God: Then we aunswere, that Christ his peace we haue inioyed in his church, and it hath contynued with his church since his assention, and yet I confesse that such was his pleasure, to afflicte his church, to suffer wicked persons to persecute the same, yet his peace the church neuer wanted. Therfore your sight was very dimme, when you saw such things.
               Moreouer you saw that no kingdome

should prosper which is agaynst the loue: Kingdoms and nations haue prospered, and do prosper by the protection of the almighty, with his blessing, and yet are against your Familie of loue. Therfore cleare your spectacles, and looke better vpon the matter, for surely I thinke you were in some dreame whē you writ this. And wher as you would haue vs beleeue y• kingdome and seruice of the loue, is y• kingdome of God the father, the sonne and the holy Ghost, this you haue brought in to make the world beleeue that your Familie of loue is nothing els but the true doctrine sent from God, but you herein deceue your selues and others, for the doctrine taught among you, is strange, and no where to be found in the word of the Lord: and your Author HN. geueth testimonye on
                     •
                  ly of himself, without warrant from God, or his word, therfore your doctrine in the Familie of loue is not from God the Father, &c.
               If you say that others also geue testimony

of HN. his doctrine, & name vnto vs it is your Fidelitas, who in deede in his booke chapter 2. sex. 8. sayeth as followeth.
               
                  You shal furthermore vnderstād▪ that the iudgement which the God of heauen hath declared through HN. vpō earth, & set forth through the same his minister, is very true, & that also the same iudgement, pronounceth and declareth the right forme and state of all what is in heauen and vpon earth, of all what is Gods and mans, spirituall and heauenly, and of all what is naturall, right, and reasonable: And that no such wonderfull workes coulde be wrought nor brought forth by any man, vnles God were with him, &c.
               
               In deed this fellow Elder Fidelitas, testyfieth much of your HN. But whether his testimony be true, let vs examine it a litle. If the iudgemēt which God hath declared through HN. be very true, thē was there no truth before. For, HN. teacheth such a doctrine as

               And whereas your Fidelitas, sayth that no such works could be wrought by anye, vnlesse the Lord were with him, this is as strongly affirmed as the other part is monstrous and vngodly. For I praye you examine what are the works that HN. hath so notably brought forth, which doth manifest y• God is with him. His bookes peraduenture you mean

A simple wit hauing such a guide, could deuise agaynst Christ his doctrine as fine riddles as HN. hath published: & should carry a more shew of truth then his bookes do. For schollers and children are able to confute his follies sufficiently: they cary such absurdities with them, both against the Scriptures of God, and against all common reason, and nature.

And some of those bookes haue come into my hands, whom you tearme enuious and diuelled with the diuell. Strange Doctrine must néedes haue strange tearmes. Your iudgement of me and master Batman we wil only answere with this saying. The Lord geue you a better minde, and a more modest spirite. I would you were as free from heresies and false doctrine, as we are from a diuilish mind.

               THat his daughter Mary was  maryed to a yonker you affirme: Therefore not all are lyes, which are by his neighbors reported of him, as you sayd before: & why may not all the rest be true, onely (you) speaking contrary? some of these persons were at the mariages, which haue testified their knowledge. I thinke at that tyme, you were not acquainted with HN. nor his doctrine: and therefore, your bare denyall is onely heresay: but these are no great matters to stand vpon: you confesse that he could not be found, being sought for, then was he fled, before his accusation was for strange doctrine, and not for a woman, as you auouch: But certeynly, If the

Magistrates should cary away his goodes▪ for an accusation of strange doctrine, then were they not indifferent, neither can I be brought to credit your speach, nor thinke so vnreuerently of any Magistrates: but why sied he, if he were not guilty of any crime?

great absurdityes, both in trueth, and reason: Whether doe you lift vp your Aucthor, by such vntrue speaches? it doth appeare very lamentable, to all God his children: this is proude bosting, and exaltation, such as S. Paule did warne the Church, to take heede of such.
               I doe much maruell that Christian men, with any face can write thus presumpteouslye of mortall man, although you would qualisye your saying, that this is brought to passe, by the spirite of Christ in him: but this helpeth not, neither doth it stand with the will of God reueled: that any mortall creature should be so exalted.
               For if we should demaund of you, how we shall know this to be true: then you aunswere, by his workes, which I thinke you meane his bookes: Yf otherwise you meane, some miraculous dealing which you are priuy of and not knowen: it were necessary for his credit, and your honesty not to hide it any longer: but simply to manifest the same.

as presumpteously to chalenge a title, and dignity, farre aboue our capacitye and not agreing with our frayle condition, and nature. But such is our vanitye not guided by the spirite of God to aduaunce our state, and calling aboue our degree, and condition, by the setting on of our enemy Sathan.

note well what you say: for neuer any since the Apostles tunes had so impudent a face, as openly to publish such a detestable lye: if this come not from the spirite of pride, I know no proud bosting spirites: all the Fathers in the primitiue Church, euer reuerenced the holy scripture, and submitted all their bookes thereunto.
               Austen desired not to be credited, or beleued, but as his workes might agree with the holy scriptures: all men in generall haue euer acknowledged themselues in their writinges: to be subiect to error, onely the scripture, to be without blemish: but this man will haue HN. and his bookes of equall aucthoritye with the scriptures, & written with the same spirite: thus doe you runne, from one impietye to an other, and in the highest degree of blasphemye. But I pray you looke vpon the matter better: before you say he is a prophet, now his bookes are of equal aucthoritye with the scripture: whether will you lift vp your HN. aboue

all condition of fraile man: the higher he is exalted, the more greuous will be his fall, without repentaunce: it is Luciferian pride, thus to attribute vnto mortall man: but you make HN, to be a name of office, and not of a creature: such misteryes requireth falced: where trueth, and simplicitye imbraceth playne dealing.
               Now you say, that HN. doth auouch all to be false, whatsoeuer is taught by any other: therefore heare his owne wordes, and then discerne, and sée: God his trueth, and his godly and heauenly workes,

You say it will be found true what he writeth: If none but the comminaltye, or Familye of Loue doe vnderstād the scripture: then it was not rightly vnderstode, before there was any mention of your Familye.

                   TOuching two mē examyned before a worshipfull Iustice, I haue collected that they were of the Family of loue: you answere, the doctrine of HN. at that time they knew not, but this is certain, one of them is liuing, & knoweth you but to well, and is a welwiller to your Family, and scoller of Allin, but what they were, you aunswere that is that. Such suttle aunsweres are fittest for men of your profession, you know what they were it seemeth, and in deed they were of your hatching, although for further increase

of knowledge▪ Allin their neare neighbor did more instructe them, and lead them forward into your error. Plain dealing would haue put men out of doute, seeing you know what they were. But since they haue bewrayed your doings▪ in secret you regard them not. For some of your Familye haue aunswered, that by compulcion, and threates, they made their confession, others say playne, they were not of our Family: you are ashamed of them now that they haue disclosed your secret conference.
               You say I affirme, I know what: I thinke you meane touching your owne person, wherein I haue vttered you to be y• onely man, y• hath brought this wicked doctrine of HN. which lay hidden in the Dutch tongue, among our simple English people, to their euerlasting destruction, except the Lord in mercy open their eyes, that they may see into the wicked, & monstrous drift of your Author HN. and repent thē, and so turn vnto the Lord Iesus

from whome they haue departed: following a stranger, an enemy to Christ and his gospell, set vp by Sathan, who enuieth the prosperitye thereof. The Lord geue you hartes to vnderstand, and also geue euery one of you a better minde.

                        •
                     lus, (or Vitulus:) I haue sayd he is a ioyner by occupation, a wauering minde, and vnconstāt, delighting in singularitys, & alwayes held hereticall opinions: almost this 36. yeares: wise men haue noted 3. euills, being once rooted in man, are seldome or neuer voyd of some spice of y• same disease: that is Lunasy, Ieolously, and heresye: and it so falleth out by this mans example: who in king Henryes raigne, was vnconstant, in king Cowardes raigne, a dissembler, and in Queenes Maryes raigne a playne Arryan, and now in this our Princes raigne, a chiefe teacher of the Familye of Loue: now he hosteth of nothing: surely there is no cause, but rather to sorrow, that many poore people, by you are deceiued, and abused:

and their simplicitye caryed away, by your suttle speaches.
               You say, what so is godly, or manly, that is from aboue: the phrase is somewhat difficult, I think you mean spirituall, and earthly.
               But where you adde, what is neither godly, nor manly, y• cōmeth of the flesh of sinne &c. Here is a distinction more scholasticall, then meane wittes can attaine to: if by godly, and manly, you place manly, as contrary to godly, then is manly taken in the euill part, and so not from aboue, excepte you will haue euell thinges from aboue, which cannot be. The thirde distinction is ambiguous: for of our corrupt nature wee bring forth fleshly wisdome, imaginations, &c. And herevnto, are we by nature subiect: if the Lord by his grace, doe not guide vs, and lead vs, and deliuer vs, (yea and so deliuered, if he still doe not protect and gouerne vs, we shall be ready to fall agayne, and agayne: therefore we dayly craue at his handes, saying: deliuer

vs Lord, from such euels, as by our owne corrupt nature, we are subiect vnto.
               Here are also 2. phrases I thought not good to let pas vntouched, the one the mans good thinking, and this is taken in the Family in the euill parte. If his thought be good, it is from aboue why despise ye it? The other is, chosen God seruices. If it be a seruice of God, then you doe not well to place this phrase with sects and errors. But these men haue a delite to publishe strange Religion, and to set it forth with strange phrases also. For so they may speake like their Author, they care not how vnlike the holy scripture they write.

                  nsay, being a thing secret and vnknowen to the world. For our secret conflictes are troublesome I graunt, when our conscience shall pres vs with the greatenes of our sinnes, but whether it were so or no who can controll him? or els who will beleeue his own wordes, speaking so many things contrary to truth already? But I must certifie that this is a speciall point of practise in the Family, that when any in conference doe require how they could so easily leaue the certainty of doctrine which once they earnestly imbraced, then shall you heare them tell you of marueilous conflicts, much trouble and veration of minde, and could neuer attaine to any quietnes,

vntill by the doctrine of

               But may not this be an illusion of Sathan as otherwise, being rightly examined? for Sathan is so suttle, that if he may get possession of any setled mindes, who instructed in godlynes by the scriptures, resist his perswasions, and so cōmeth to conslict of minde in such troubles▪ where Sathan▪ by the Lord his permission, preuayleth: then worketh he in his a certayne security or peace, and then they thinke all is well, when ind

               Now this man, when he hath set abroad some of his troubles, you shall see how he was deliuered: by which we may gather what marke he shootes at: namely in all troubles, and agonyes of minde, all must resort to the seruice of Loue, set forth by his elected Minister HN. For this man, if he had not taken that course, he had remained without hope of lyfe: certaynly

great is the honor, wherewith they aduaunce this their priest and prophet, aboue all that is called God: but my hope is, that with the blast of the Lord his mouth, which he hath published in the scriptures: he shall be confounded and ouerthrowne so low, that the fall of him, which so exalted himselfe, shall be to the comfort of all the Lord his children: for whose

               And where as you so confidētly affirme, that you were in no error, whē you were at the Crosse: the contrarye whereof is manifest. I will put you in minde of the disputations, and conferēce, that diuers mē had with you in Queene Maryes dayes: M. Ro. Crowley a reuerent and godly preacher yet liuing who affirmeth, yt seueral, times he disputed with you, concerning the blasphemy of Arryus, and you cōtinually denyed Christ Iesus to be God, equall with his Father: and immoueably you remained all her raigne of that minde: and this M. Crowley, is redy to auouch agaynst you, whensoeuer you, or any for you: will require to be certafied: Also one Ione Agar, an olde mayde, which wayted on those in

office for the Cittye, as Mayors, and shrieffes, did declare to M. Fulkes the Elder, and others, that you Christopher Vitell, whome she named to be hyr cosin, had taught her playnely, that Christ was not God: but onely a good man, and a Prophet: and that there were men that shee did know liuing, that were as good, and as holy men, as he was: and further, that Maister Latimer, Maister Ridley, and others (which gaue their lyf
                     •
                   for Christes cause,) were starke fooles, and did not well in suffering death: such wickednes haue you bin the Aucthor of: & yet now to hould your credit with your Familye: you would haue the world beleue, that you were in no error: but you are worthy the reward of a lyer: which is, that when he speaketh trueth he is not beleued.
               This man is chosen, and found to be the aptest person, to be an illuminat Elder in HN. his Family, & of greatest credit, among those deceiued soules: a fitter instrument to beare record of

                  HN. and his doctrine: then to declare the ioyfull message of Christ our redeemer, whome he hath blasphemed, denying his diuinitye: worthely are they deluded, that follow such a deceiuer.
               That man, that once hath made shipwrack of fayth & good conscience, and is possessed with error, it is hard to reclayme him: but that some spice of that maladye will lurke in him, or a worse: as is proued true by you: you confessed then, you were deceaued by certayne straungers: and haue you not as great cause to suspect your selfe deceaued now, by HN. a straunger in nation, and estraunged from God, and Christ, in his doctrine published: contrary to his will reuealed in the holy scriptures? if you would consider with indifferency, you were neuer so notably deceiued then, as you are now: for looke into all the workes of HN. what doe they tend to? but that he is a prophet raysed vp by God, and an elected minister, a priest in office, by

whome God wil receiue all men in mercy. With such lyke testimonyes, doth he vtter of himselfe, and his Familye, doe beleue the same. I would his credit were not so great with you but that you could cōpare his sa
