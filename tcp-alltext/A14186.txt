                  in funder parted be.

                  An other perſon proper of
                  the holy Ghoſt alone.
                  Of Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt,
                  but one the Godhead is:
                  Lyke glory, coeternall eke
                  the maieſtie lykewiſe.

                  the Sonne in ech degree:
                  And ſuch alſo we do beleue,
                  the holy Ghoſt to be.
                  Vncreate is the Father, and

                  Incomprehenſible Father is,
                  incomprehenſible Sonne:
                  And comprehenſible alſo is,
                  the holy Ghoſt of none.
                  The Father is eternall, and

                  the Sonne almighty ſo:

                  Yet are there not three Gods in all,
                  but one God and no moe.
                  So lykewiſe Lord the Father is,
                  and Lord alſo the Sonne:
                  And Lord the holy Ghoſt, yet are,
                  there not three Lordes, but one.
               
               
                  For as we are compeld to graunt,
                  by Chriſtian veritie:
                  Ech of the perſons by himſelfe,
                  both God, and Lord to be:
                  So Catholicke Religion,
                  forbiddeth vs alway:
                  That either Gods be three, or that
                  there Lordes be three to ſay.
               
               
                  Of none the Father is ne made,
                  ne create, nor begot:
                  The Sonne is of the Father, not
                  create, n
                        •
                      made, but got.
                  The holy Ghoſt is of them both,
                  the Father and the Sonne,
                  Ne made, ne create, nor begot,
                  but doth proceede alone.
               
               
                  So we one Father hold, not thre
                        •
                     ,
                  one Sonne alſo, not three:
                  One holy Ghoſt alone, and not
                  three holy Ghoſtes to be.

                      in this Trinitie before,

                  Ne greater any then the reſt,
                  ne leſſer be lykewiſe.
               
               
                  But euery one among themſelues,
                  of all the perſons three:
                  Together coeternall all,
                  and all coequall be.
                  So Vnitie, in Trinitie,
                  as ſayd it is before:
                  And Trinitie, in Vnitie,
                  in all thinges we adore.
               
               
                  Therefore what man ſo euer that
                  ſaluation will attaine:

                  Thou knoweſt (O Lord) before I aſke,

                     did they their Lord prouoke?
                     How did they moue and ſtirre the Lord,

                  Was crucified on the croſſe,
