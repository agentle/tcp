               THE PREFACE CONTAINING THE CAVSES AND REASONS OF this nevv edition, as also a detection of the foule and false dealing of M. Edm. Buny Minister, in his late edition of the former booke.
            With certaine instructions very profitable to the reader.
            WHEN of late I had taken in hand to finish and send vnto thee (deare Christian reader) th' other two The reason of printing againe this first booke of Resolution. bookes, that were promised of this worke, I meane thos two which should treate of the right entrance and faithful perseuerance in the seruice of almightie God: I was moued by diuers frendes, first of al to put againe in print (in some better order then before) the first booke appetteining to resolution. Wherunto I was the more easie to be induced, for that I perceaued many monethes before, that al the first copies of the said former booke, (though not so wel

done as iustely I might haue wished) were vvholy dispersed and none remaining to be had.
            Secondly, it being now purposed that thes second and third bookes should passe forth in better print, paper, and character, then the former did, (wherin by some errour, as also by difficultie of the time, greate defect was found:) it seemed meere and requisice, that this first booke (of which th' other two doe depēd) should be made correlpondent vnto them in thes respectes also, and for that consideration to be reprinted.
            Wherunto when I had yelded; I resolued in like manner, to take the same first booke into my handes againe, & to bestow a short renew vpon that which alredy was done, as wel to polish and fil vp some thinges, whetin before for want of leasure and time, I could not geue to my self any reasonable conteatation, as also to a dioine certaine new chapters, which partly in mine owne concept, and partly also vpon Nevv additions. information of others, I thought not vnmeet for the furnishing of this first argument and subiect of Resolution. And standing determined vpon this, as also comprehending in mind and cogitation, the whole general corps of that which was to ensue in th' other two bookes: The vvhole vvorke deuided into tvvo volumes. I wel saw that I should not be able (according to my first designement) to compact the whole, in one reasonable volume; and therfore I resolued to deuide the same into two. Waerof the first should conteine matter of 1. Speculatiue. discourse, know edge, speculation, and confideration, to moue vs to resolue; the second should handle things appetteining to exercise, 2. Practive. vse, and practise, for putting in execution our

good desires after resolution.
            This being my cogitation, and the matter now wel forward for the print; I was enformed of two other editions come forth of my Tvvo editions of the booke of Resolution vvithout the authors knowledge. forsaid booke without my knowiedge, the one by a Catholique (as it seemeth) who perceuing ai copies of the former print to be spēt; for satisfying of them that desired the booke, procured the same to be set forth againe, albeit somewhat incorrected, and very disordrely, not hauing the consent or aduise of such, as therin should haue geuen him best direction. The second was published by one Edmund Bany minister at Bolton Percy (as he writeth) M. Ed. Bany. in the liberties of Yorke; who with publicke licence vnder my Lord Archbishop of Yorke his protection, set forth the same to the benefice of his brethren; but yet so punished and plumed, (which he termeth purged;) as I could hardly by the face discerne it for mine, when it came vnto my handes, and I tooke no smale compassiō to see how pitifully the poore thing had bene handled.
            Of this edition then of M. Buny, (letting Of M. Bunies edition. passe th' other as a matter onely of a discretion without malice,) I haue to a laertise the reader some few things, as wel for mine own discharge, wherin I am charged by him, as also for the readers admonishment, not to thinke in deed that booke to be mine, which in my name this preacher hath published. And for vttering that which I haue to say in some kinde of order Fovver pointes of this preface. and conueniencie of methode; I shal touch breefly in this preface thos principal pointes insuing.
            First, how this booke came foorth from me  in the first edition.
            
               
Secondly, how it was set foorth afterwardes  by M. Edm. Buny.
            Thirdly, what he meaneth by his treatise  annexed therunto, tending (as he saith) to pacification.
            Fourthly, how the same booke commeth  foorth at this present, and how the discret reader may vse it to his best commoditie.
            
               of the first edition.
               TO shew how this booke came foorth at the first; it shalbe requisite, perhaps, to repeate breefly ī this place, the things that I saied in my first preface & induction; which preface and induction, M. Buny hath left out in his edition, protesting, That he durst not in conscience and 
                  In his preface to the reader. 
                  in dutie tovvardes God, commend the same in my vvordes vnto the reader. And yet trulie was ther nothing in effect therin (Gentle reader) but that which here in this place shalbe repeated. First, that the primatiue occasion, inducing me to thinke vpon this worke, was the sight of a booke intituled, The excrcise of a Christian life, writen in Italian by Doctor Loartes of the Societie The first occasion of setting soorth the booke of Resolution. of IESVS, and translated some years since by a vertuous learned gentilman of our countrie. Which booke for that I vnderstood of certaintie to haue profited many, towardes pietie and deuotion: I was moued to cause the same to be printed againe, with certaine ample additions to the furnishing of some matters which that author had omitted: deuiding my whole purpose into three seueral bookes, wherof the first was to persuade mē vnto true resolution; the secōd to instruct vs how rightely to beginne; the third, how a man may hould

but and perseuer. Secondly I shewed, that being entred into the worke, and hauing set downe an other order and method to my self, then that treatise of D. Loartes did obserue; and hauing begunao the first booke touching resolution, whereof no part was handled in that other treatise: I found by experience, that I could not wel conioine th' one with th' other, if I would satisfie either th' order or argument by me conceaued: and therfore that I was inforced to resolue vpon a further labour then at the first I had intended, and this was, to draw out the whole three bookes my self, not omitting any thing that was in the said exercise, or other like good treatisses to this effect.
               And al this to the end, that our countriemen might haue some one sufficient directiō, for matters of spirit and vertuous life, among so many bookes of controuersies as haue bene writen & are in writing daily. Which bookes (said I) albeit in thes our troblesome and quarrelous Bookes of deuotion more profitable to good life thē bookes of controuersies. times, they be necessary for defence of our faith against so manie seditious innouations, as now daily are attempted: yet help they litle oftentimes to good life, but rather doe fil the heades and hartes of men with a spirit of contradiction and contention, which for the most part doe hinder deuotion, which deuotion is nothing els, but, A quiet, calme, and peacable state of our soule, induced 
                        〈◊〉

                  The description of deuotion. 
                  and alacritis to the diligent execution of al things that doe or may apperteine to the honour and seruice of almightbe God. For which cause, the holie Apostle dehorted greatly his scholer Timothie 2. Timot. 2. from this contention and contradiction of wordes, affirming clearly, that it was profitable to nothing but to subuect the hearers.
               
                  
I affirmed further, that our forfathers were most happie in respect of vs, who receauing Our fathers happie that builded, and contended not about the foundation. with humilitie one vniforme faith without contention or contradiction, from their mother the holie Catholique Church, did attend onlie to build vpon that foundatiō good workes and vertuous life, as holie scripture commandeth vs to doe; wheras we, spending now al our time in iangling about this first foundation 1. Co. 3. of faith, haue no leasure to build either gould or siluer theron, as th' Apostle exhorteth vs, but doe weary out our selues and our owne contentious spirits, without commoditie; dying with much labour and litle profit, with great disquiet and smale reward. For which cause I exhorted the discret reader of whatsoeuer religion and faith he were, to moderate this heate and passion of contention, and to enter into the careful studie and exercise of good deedes, which are alwayes better among true Christians, then wordes; assuring him that this is the right way to obteine at Gods hāds, the light of true beleefe if he were amisse. Alleaging for example therof, the most famous conuersion of Cornelius the Gentile, whos vertuous life, praiers, and almouse deedes, obteined at the hands of almightie God, (as S. Luke doth testifie) that S. Peter was sent vnto him for his instruction and establishment in right Act. 10. faith.
               I adioined moreouer, that ther being two parts of Christiā diuinitie, the one Theorike or speculatiue, belonging principally to knowledge, Tvvo partes of Christian aiuinisie. discours, and beleefe; the second called practique or actiue, appertaining cheefly to action and execution: the first is more easy and common, then the second, bicause it is more

easy to know then to doe; to discourse then to Speculation easier then practise. worke; to beleeue as we ought, then to liue as we should: and the things that a man hath to beleeue, are fewer then the things he hath to doe; learned in shorter time and with lesse difficultie, thé the other are executed. Euen as we see by experience, that a breefe Cathechisme instructeth a man sufficiently in his faith; but al the bookes and sermons that we can read and heare, can not persuade the least part of men to performe so much in life, as by their vocation is required. For which cause I said, that both our Saucour and his Apostles did treate much more in their speaches and writings of things to be done, then of things to be known; of vertuous liuing, then of right beleeuing. The like I saied, of Holie fathers and Doctours in the Church after them, as it may be sene in their homilies, sermons, exhortations, treatises, commentaries, and expositions.
               For this cause I saied also, that I had chosen to say some thing of this second part of Christian diuinitie appertaining to manners and direction of life, allotting to my self three principal pointes to be handled therin, and to be treated in three seueral bookes. The first wherof, to conteine the reasons and motiues The three bookes of this Christiā directorie, vvith their argumentes. which may stir vp a Christian man to make a firme and sound resolution. The secōd to prescribe the particular meanes, how a man without errour may put in vre and practise his resolution made. The third, to declare certaine helpes and instructions, wherby to be able to perseuer vnto the end. The first of thes bookes, was then set downe and published. The secōd and third vpon necessarie causes were deferred for a time. And this is the summarie of al that

was writen in my former preface and Induction, suppressed now by M. Buny for meere conscience sake as he protesteth Wherin notwithstanding I doe not easilie see, what may be accompted either so heinous or intollerable, as his scrupulous conscience should be a fraide to let the same passe vnto the readers eare, except it were for that in a certaine aduertisement, I desired eche Catholique to pray for our persecutours; or for that (perhaps) in the lines before repeated, I doe affirme faith, and beleef to be more common and easy then vertuous life; which notwithstanding I thinke, many Protestants in England wil confesse to be true; and wil easilie proue the same by the liues and actions of their own preachers and ministers. So much then for this: now let vs behold, how M. Buny hath set foorth the same booke with his purgation.
            
            
               of M. Bunis edition.
               M. Buny hauing taken this booke into his correction, as also into my Lord Archbishop of Yorke his protection; geueth it this title, A title giuen by M. Buny. 
                  A booke of Christian exercise &c. Perused and accompanied vvith a treatise tending to pacification, by Edm. Buny. And vnder the title, he writeth this sentence of scripture. IESVS Christ yester day and 
                  Heb. 13. 
                  to day and the same for euer. The misterie why he set thes wordes ther, him self alone (as I thinke) vnderstandeth and hard it were for other men to coniectare. If he had taken the wordes immediatly following in the same sentence of S. Paul; they had bene more cleare, if not more also to the purpose. For they ar thes, Be not caried avvay vvith variable and strange doctrines.
                  
But let vs permit M. Buny to folow his An old trick of beretiques to abuse simple people vvith obscure places of scripture. See Epiph. cont. heres. and 
                           〈◊〉
                         Quod vult Deum.
                   kinde. The holie fathers that write against auncient heretiques, doe note it for an old tricke of thos companions, to delight them selues, and deceue others with obscure places of scripture. And S. Peter expresly signifieth of the same men, that principally they vsed to take the said obscure sentences out of S. Paul, whence this by M. Buny is also cited. And this for the first page.
               In the next page, he placeth my Lord of Yorkes armes, accompanied with a paire of goodly crosse keyes, and a croune set ouer thé. Vnder which he writeth two latin verses, that 2. Pet. 3. say thus much in English, Thes armes haue bene 
                  My L. of yorkes armes. 
                  noble in times past by ancient gentry and commendation of learning; but novv they are made more noble by the honour of Peter adioined vnto them. So that now (as ye see) it is both good doctrine, and very commendable in my Lords grace of Yorke to clame both keyes & croune, from Peters seat, which in the Byshop of Rome is made so hainous, and so bitterly inueighed against daily.
               After the armes, insueth the dedication of the whole booke, (treating of mortification The epistle dedicaterie. and contempt of the world) vnto his good Lordship. The reason of which dedication, M. Buny vttereth in thes wordes, For that hauing 
                  In his Ep. dedicat. 
                  had (saieth he) so longe experience of the vvorld as your Lordship haue, very liklihood teacheth that needes you must grovve more and more from the loue therof. And it is sufficiently knovvn vnto al, that hauing 
                  My L. of yorkes mortificatiō and calling vpō others. 
                  found this mercy your self, you haue in like sort in this long course that God hath geuen you, much called on others to doe the like. In which wordes, we see, that touching the first pointe of my Lords wearines of this world, M. Buny proueth it

very slenderly, by a bare likelihood only. Albeit in the second, of his Graces calling vpon others to like mortification, he alleageth the commō and sufficient knowledge of al, wherunto in reason eche man must yeld. And in truth I haue heard, how ther want not of diuers sortes and His L. hostise of Doncaster. Sir Robert Stapleton & others. sexes also, who can witnesse by experience of my Lordes good mortification, and how hotely he hath poursued them of late, for such affaires; and therfore (no doubt) but that this booke was very fitly dedicated to his Lordships protection.
               After the epistle dedicatorie vnto my Lord, ther foloweth a preface to the reader, wherin The preface to the reader. M. Buny saieth, That by the litle that he hath bestovvedin the studie of schole men, he vvil perceaueth that this booke vvas gathered out of them; vvho liuing in the corrupter time of the Church (as he speaketh) did most of al, by that occasion, treate of reformation of life, vvhen as others vvere rather occupied in controuersies. To which I answer, that by the litle which M Banies ignorance. M. Buny here vttereth, he sheweth him self scarse worthy to be my Lord Archbishops chaplaine, (albeit to that dignitie much learning be not required,) for that whosoeuer shal looke vpon the homilies, sermons, commentaries, and other workes of S. Ambrose, Augustin, Gregorie, Maximus, Bede, Bernard, Anselme, and other that were not scholemen; and shal compare the same (touching exhortation and instruction to good life.) With the questions, distinctions, speculations and subtilties of Peter Lumbard, Hales, Scotus, Durand, Iandun Capreolus and others of that profession; shal easily see, that in this matter ther is no comparison: and consequently that M. Bunis litle studie in the scholemen is lesse then nothing at al, not

knowing so much as the very subiect and argument which they handle, or the manner how they handle the same. But al this was spoken M. Bunies vanitie. by M. Buny, for a vaine florish, and to persuade his reader, that as him self was very learned, so al that was in this booke being taken out of Dunsies (as now in England they tearme scholemen,) might appeare more contemptible in euery mans iudgement, and so in reason stand the more subiect to M. Bunis learned censure, to put out, cut of, mangle, change & pare away whatsoeuer it pleased him. Yet protesteth he forsooth, very solemly, That he allovveth vvel of the matter in general, and that he is glad that some of 
                  Ep. Dedicate. 
                  vs also, haue taken paines in this kinde of labour, and that others of our prosession are sometimes occupied in reading such bookes. As who would say, that this were a strange and rare matter in our behalfe, either to write or reade bookes of this qualitie or argument.
               But here I would demande of M. Buny in sincerite, where or when, any of his religion did either make or set forthe (of them selues) any one treatise of this kinde or subiect? I meane, Only Catholiques vvrite boo kes of deuotion. of deuotion pietie and contemplation? Of ours I can name infinite both of times past and present. As in times past S. Bernard, S. Bonauenture, S. Auselme, Iohn Gerson, Thomas de kempis, Dionisius Cathusianus, and others, whom no man wil deny to haue bene al of our religion. For this time present, the most excellent writinges of Ludouicus de Granada, Diegostella, Polancus, Angerius, and this present booke with infinite others, writen in this kinde doe testifie that this argument is not strange among Catholiques, but rather proper and peculier vnto them alone, seing that M. Buny is not able to

name one on his side, from the first heretique that cuer wrote, vnto this daie, which of his owne accorde hath employed him self in this subiect, except it were of enuie and malice to defile and corrupt an other mans labours, to the end they should not worke that good effect, which otherwise they would, as M. Buny hath now done mine, and as one Rogers an other like companion (whom also he nameth) hath corrupted in englishe the most excellent 
                     
                        〈1 line〉
                      bookes. worke of Thomas de Kempis of the imitation of Christ, striking out without conscience, whatsoeuer he pleaseth; whereas the same booke before, was truly set forth in our natiue tongue by a Catholique. An other also of the same crue, hath vsed the like violence vnto the holie meditations of S. Augustin and Saint Bernard, putting out and in what liked him best, and making thos blessed men to speake like protestātes, against whom they were most opposite enimies.
               The same hath M. Buny done vnto me, throughout my whole booke, and to most of the ancient Fathers therin named also, as afterward shalbe declared. And this shameles shift of corrupting other mens bookes, is an old occupation of heretiques from the beginning, as may appeare by the often complaintes of most ancient fathers, whos workes they were not ashamed to infect and corrupt whiles they were yet liuing. In respect of which impudencie the holie Apostle S. Paul, wel prophetied of them to his scholer Timothie, that they should haue, cauteriatam conscientiam, a seared and yronburned cōscience. And againe; that they should 1. Tim. 4. sinne wilfully and damnably in their owne Tit. 3. knowledge and iudgement. So we reade that

old heretiques aduentured to corrupt not only priuate mens workes and treatises; but also the holic Canons of general Councels them selues, wherof therwere so many witnesses yet liuing to controle them. This may appeare by the greuous complaint which holie Athanasius Athanas. apolog. 2. tp ad felic. made in his time against the Arians for corrupting the first Nicen Councel, and other fathers after him, for like heretical attemptes in their times; especially against the sacred text of diuine scripture, in corrupting whereof, al heretiques from time to time haue bene most malepert, bold, and impudent, for shadowing their sectes with some shew of holie write.
               And to the ende M. Buny may not here eskape, and tel his reader that this was a spirit That protestātes doe follovv the same spirit of corrupting. of heretiques in old time, and not to be found in the protestantes of thes daies: I doe referre him not only to the collections which diuers Catholiques of this age haue gathered against them, touching thes attemptes; but also to the testimonies, confessions, and accusatiōs of protestantes them selues, one against and other for like impudencie. Especially against the Sacramentaries, or thos that folowed th' opinion of Zuinglius (wherof I thinke M. Buny wil not deny him self to be one,) whom Martin Luther the father of al protestantes doth affirme, to be the most horrible corrupters of other mens bookes, that euer were; concluding his whole inuectiue against them with this sentēce, Their opinion of the Sacrament they began vvith lies, and 
                  Luth. in Lipist. ad Ioan. Heruagium typogra. Argent. 
                  vvith lies they do desend the same; and they broch it abrode by the vvicked fraude of corrupting other mens bookes. The like he saieth and much more, of their corrupting the holie scriptures in diuers places.
               
                  
But what? was Martin Luther him self irreprehensible 
                     The nevv brethrens testimonies, the one against the other. Zuing. li. de Sacra. fol. 412. 10. 2. Bez. in resp. ad defens. Castal. Itē in praefat. Test. an 1556. in this pointe, wherin he accuseth so vehemently the Sacramentaries? No truly if we beleeue Zuinglius, who termeth him, both, A foule corruptour and horrible salsifier of Gods vvord, one that folovved the Marcionistes and Arians that rased out such places of holie vvrite as vvere against them. Beza accuseth Occolampadius together with al his brethren the diuines of Basile for great impietie ī abusing the sacred scriptures traslated by them. The like he doth, but with much more vehemencie against Castalio, an other brother, affirming his dealing with holie scripture, to be both bold, pestilent, sacrilegious and ethnical. Carolus Molineus was a brother also of the same blood, and yet he cō
                  fesseth Mol in trá. Test. noni. part. 11. fol. 110. Item part. 64. 65. 66. 74. 99. of Caluin, That he made the text of the Gospel to leape vp and dovvne at his pleasure; that he vsed violence to the same, and added of his ovvne to the very sacred letter, for dravving it to his purpose. This same authour testifieth and crieth out of Beza, quod de facto 
                        〈◊〉
                      mutat, that actually he is not ashamed to change in his translations the very text of holie scripture, when it maketh against his purpose.
               I might passe on further in stirring this euil sauoured sinke, of heretical iniquitie, discouered and moued by their owne brethren, (for such is alwaies the agreement of like mates) were it not that the matter it self is vnfit for thes pages, and the dealiag of M Buny with me in this booke, shal easilie dec are their spirit M. Bunies particuler dealing in editiō of the booke of resolution. and practise, if nothing therin were alleaged besides. Now then I come to shewe how dexterously he hath behaued him self in this edition of my booke.
               
                  FIRST IN A L places wher conueniently

he maye, he maketh me speake after B V N. first deuise. To MAKE his aduersaries speake like Protestantes. the phrase of Protestantes; as for example, page 204. of his booke, wher I talke of Catholique preestes that heare confessions; he maketh me saie, men that be skilful to giue Counsail, &c. Againe page 229. wher I saie out of holie scripture, here hence doe proceede al thos large promises, to virginitie, chastitie, voluntarie pouertie, &c. he maketh me saie; hence doe procede thos promises to mortification and nevvnes of life; & he striketh out the scriptures which I alleage for the other. In like maner page 368. when I saie, penance & satissaction. He maketh me saie, toile of amendment. And so in infinite other places (which were to long here to recite) M. Buny maketh me to speake like a good minister of England. Neither dealeth he only thus with me; but ī like maner also with the ancient fathers, so long as by that meanes he can hold in with them, and when he can not, then he breaketh of and biddeth them a dieu.
               Let one or two examples serue for al; page 374. he ronneth on a whole halfe lease with S. Augustine, turning euery wher the wordes penance and satisfaction into repentance, vntil at S. Augustine taught to speake by M. Buny. légth S. Augustine saieth, that this penāce must be inioined to the penitent by the preest: and ther M. Buny leapeth ouer that, but yet after a line or two, ioineth with him familiarly againe, and so runneth on, vntil he cometh to an other blocke, that cā not be remoued, wher he is inforced againe to leape ouer. So in like maner page 209. wher S. August. recounteth the storie of S. Antonie the monke of Egipt; M. Buny leaueth out the name Monke, and teacheth S. Augustine to say; S Antonie that had professed a priuate and solitarie life in Egipt. And then

wher S. Augustin writeth, that ther vvas a Monasterie of the same monkes, norished by S. Ambrose vvithout the vvalles of Millan; M. Buny maketh him to leaue out the names of Monkes & Monasterie, as also the name and almes of S. Ambrose, & to say onlie that others (as he then heard) did the like, euen in Millan it self. And finally, he frameth euery mans speech (wher he can) to such a stile as though he had bene trained vp in Iohn Caluins schole.
               
                  SECONDLY, when he hath not commoditie to change the very wordes, or els dareth BVNY second deuise. To INSERT parentheses. not for that they are scripture: then seeketh he to salue the matter with inserting some parenthesis, as though the same were of th' authour him self. So page 39. I say, that our Sauiour being demanded by a certaine prince, how he might be saued; would geue him no other hope albeit he were a prince, but, if thou vvilt enter into life, kepe the commandementes. Wher M. Buny helpeth Math. 18. Marc 10. Luc. 19. the matter out with this parenthesis, saying; He vvould geue him no other hope (so long as he sought saluation by his vvorkes) but keepe the commandementes, &c. As though this prince had sought his saluation erroniously, & that Christ had answered him in his error, & so deceaued him. In like maner page 229. wher I alleage out of S. Paul and out of the reuelations, that men shalbe crowned in heauen according to their 2. Tim. 2. Apoc. 2. fight in this life: M. Buny bodgeth in this parenthesis (in some good measure) therby to limite the Holie Ghost in his meaning. Semblably, page 229. when I alleage plainly the wordes of scripture, No man knovveth vvhether he be vvorthie of loue or hatred in Gods sight. He addeth Eccle. 9. this parenthesis (by outward things) as who would say, that by inward things ech man

might know the same, which the Holie Ghost in this place did not forsee.
               
                  THIRDLY when he can not accōmodate BVN. third shift. MAROInal annotations of diuers fortes. the matter ether by changing the wordes, or by putting in a parenthesis; then maketh he oftentimes certaine amotations in the margent; wherof certaine be idle and foolish, some be ridiculous and absurd, and other be wicked and tending to impietie.
               Of the first kinde, you may see examples page 171. wher, for that I saie, that our natural Annotatiōs fonde. passions moderated, may serue vs to vertue; he maketh a longe and fond annotation, that we doe hold that the soule doth follow the temperature of the body, and thervpon doe grounde that our Lady was borne without original sinne; and other such docttines, which is neither so no so; nor the good man vnderstandeth what he saieth in this point nor what we hold, albeit (if you will beleeue him) he hath studied the schoelmen. Page 228. wher I saie that ther was no reason in our fight, whie almightie God should so much abuse his owne only sonne in this world, as to suffer so many indignities as he did: this man saith in a margical note, that ther vvas great reason in it. And so consequently, doth bring the inscrutable misterie of the sonne of God his abasement, (wherat S. Paul so often times wondered, and wherat the very Angels remaine astonished;) within the compasse of humane wit & reason, which euery simple man by nature may comprehend.
               Of the second kinde, which are absurde, you may finde examples page 153. wherby a marginal 2. Annotatiōs absurd. note he discrediteth the beleefe of S. Cyprian about the knowledge, that we shal haue

of our fathers, mothers, and other acquaintance in heauen; as though one Cyprian with Christian men of reason, weighed not more in the affaires of our soule, then ten coople of Bunis, were they neuer so vendible. So againe page 214. vpon the religious rule of life which S. Augustine reporteth to haue bene reuealed to his mother for him to follow, M. Buny writeth, That it vvas but a more careful indeuour in the 
                  Aug. lib.8. confes. cap. 12. 
                  vvay of godlines. And page 212. he addeth to the same, That it vvas but such, as vve al (saieth he) are bound vnto. But yet he that shal reade either S. Augustine him self, or els Possidonius his scholler declaring the particulers of that rule, Possid. in vita Aug. which he saw S. Augustine obserue in life, and prescribe vnto others: he wil easily confesse (I thinke) that how soeuer the ministers of England may be bounde therunto by M. Bunis word in this annotation, yet that they doe obserue but few partes therof in conuersation: especially touching wiuing, I am of opinion, that M. Buny wil not denie S. Augustins rule to containe some-what more, thē he and his fellowes at this day doe practise. To like fond absurditie appertaineth that which is noted by him, page 300. wher I affirming that Gods secret iudgement of ech mans particuler predestination, is vncertaine to vs, he noteth in the margent, that calling and iustifying are very plaine and infallible tokens therof, and so far is it not vncertaine to the faithful; as who would saie, that it were an easie mater for him that hath faith, to know who are so called or iustified, as is requisite to assure a man of his particuler predestination: whereas notwithstanding, Christ saith of the first, that many are called vvhich are not chosen, and of the second, S. Paul saith in him self

                  that he vvas guiltie of nothing, and yet therby he vvas not iustified.
               
               Of the third kinde of annotations, which 3. Annotations vvicked. are both wicked & impious, ther might many examples be alleaged, but thes few insuing shal suffise to discouer M. Bunies spirite. First then, page 212. as concerning the life of that holie and most wonderful man S. Antonie the first monke of AEgipt, whom al antiquitie so much Athanas. in vita Anton. Aug lib. 8. cōfes. c. 12. admired, and whom S. Athanafius in writing his life, so highely extolled, and whos doinges S. Augustin so hartely reuerenced, as he made the same a principal motiue & paterne to his owne conuersion; (especially for that he tooke thos wordes of our Sauiour, Goe and sel al thou 
                  Mat. 19. 
                  hast and geue to the poore, as spoken to him self in particuler:) vpon this mans conuersion (I say) & most wonderful life, M. Buny maketh this scorneful & irreligious note, that it may vvel be doubted, 
                  Against S. Antonie. 
                  vvhether he had in that place sufficient groundvvorke of thos his doings, vnles he had some other special motion besides. Condemning herin not only S. Antonie, but also S. Athanasius, S. Hierome, S. Augustine & al other fathers, that so highely commend S. Antonie for putting in execution thos wordes of our Sauiour.
               To like purpose or rather more vvickedlie, he maketh an other annotation page 308. vpon Against S. Augustine. the most famous conuersion of S. Augustin recorded by the pen of that holy father him self, to vvit, that some pointes of the storie vvhich S. Augustin vvriteth, are such, as a man may as vvel doubt they proceeded of Sathan as of God; therby to bring in question that excellent mans cōuersion. But of al other, that annotation of his, is most ridieulous Against our B. 
                        〈◊〉
                      die. and yet blasphemous, wher he wil needes bring in our blessed Ladie to haue brokē fower

seueral commandemēts (forsooth) at one clappe, for that she defended not her sonne vpō the Crosse. For, page 369. wher I in commendation of the confessiō which the theefe made, said in my booke, that it was at such a time, when al the world abādoned our Sauiour, and the very Apostles thē selues either doubted or lost their faith of his Godhead: this man noteth in the margēt, that the blessed Virgin likevvise vvas by, and saied nothing (that vve reade of) in his defence: a plaine breach (saieth he) of the first, fist, sixt, & ninth cōmandomentes. A strange matter, that thes men should be so desirous to skore vp & make Catalogues of our Ladies sinnes which she neuer committed. But let vs see with what shew of reason.
               He saith that she brake fower commandementes at one time; Let vs then examine them what they are. The first commandemēt (according Aug. quest. 71. in Exo. & con. 1. in Psal. 32. as S. Augustine in old time, & Catholiques now a daies are accustomed to number them) is; Thou shalt haue no strāge Godes before me, nor make vnto thy self any grauen Idole to adore the same. The fift is, Thou shalt not kil. The sixt, Thou shalt not commit adulterie. The ninth, Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours wife. And this, as Catholiques doe number the commandementes. But according as some protestantes wil recon the same, The fift is, Honor thy father & thy mother. The sixt, Thou shalt not kil. The ninth, Thou shalt not beare false vvitnes against thy neighbour. Now thē (gentle reader) consider with indifferencie, how in reason Great absurditie & impietie of M. Buny. it may be said, that the blessed Virgin, the sacred mother of God, for not defending her sonne vpon the Crosse, against the Magistrates & soldiers, did breake any of thes fower commandementes; that is to say, did either make vnto her self any strange God or Idole, or did

dishonour her father and mother; or did cōmit Maruelous absurdities. murder or adulterie; or did beare false witnes against her neighbour; or did couet her neighbours mate; whether (I say) it be credible, that in not defending her sonne at that instant, she committed any one of thes hainous & mortal crimes, and much more, whether she cōmitted fower of them together, as M. Buny affirmeth? Let (I say) the indifferent and Christian reader iudge of this accusation, as also consider, whether M. Bun. the. diuels proctor. M. Buny be not worthio of a very good fee at the deuils hādes, for indeuoring to bring into his clawes, so rich a pray, as was the most excellēt pure & sacred mother of our Sauiour, by accusing her of fower deadlie sinnes together?
               
                  AND THVS much of annotations; passing ouer diuers other thinges that might be BVN. third snift. THEVsting out. examined if time and place did not prohibite. But the greatest shift of al others which M. Buny hath to ridde his handes, when nether changing of the wordes, not putting in of pareutheses, nor annotations in the margent wil cleare and pacific the matter; is, to strike and thrust out what so euer he misliketh, whether they be my wordes, or els the discourses of ancient fathers, yet authorities them selues of sacred scripture. For vnderstanding wherof it is to be cōsidered, that first, generally whersoeuer he findeth the mētion of certaine thinges that please him not, as of abstinence, fasting, chastesing the bodie, penance, satisfaction, virginitie, merit, hier, gayning of heauen, laboring for reward, or the like: he commonly striketh al out together with th' Authours that treat therof, or els so mangleth the same as is pitiful to behold.
               Secōdly whatsoeuer authoritie commeth in

his way, which he cānot mangle, out it goeth Impudent dealing in striking out. Monkes. without redēption, be it Father, Doctor, Counsel or Scripture. Herof you may see exāples, Page 29. of his booke, wher he thrusteth out S. Hierome and Ioannes Cassianus, for that they mē
                  tiō Mōkes of the primatiue Church. So againe page 98. he thrusteth out S. Cyprian & Possidonius, for that they geue testimonie of an apparitiō 
                  Apparitiōs of Christ. which Christ our Sauiour made to a godly man at his death. In like maner, Page 109. he trusteth out S. Ambros, S. Augustin, S. Gregorie and S. Bernard together, for that they persuade men by their examples to be affeard of Purgatorie. Further, Page 98. he striketh out S. Augustin. Purgatorie. S Gregorie and venerable Bede, with their large discourses which they make concerning appatitions of certaine Angels to godlie people. So againe, Page 305. he thrusteth out the Apparitiōs of Angels. exāple of S. Paul the first heremite with the authoritie of S. Hierome that wrote his life. And this in hatred of Monkes and heremites. After Neremites. that againe, Page 374. he thrusteth out S. Augustin with al that he cā alleage about satissactiō 
                  Satisfactiō. Penance. and final penance. Page 60. he thrusteth out the weping, fasting, watching, lying on the ground, wearing of sack clothe and other bodilie punishmētes Bodily affliction. that King Dauid vsed vpon him self, albeit they be recorded and set downe in holie scripture. Page 169. he thrustath out the exāple of S. Paul th' Apostle how he was assisted & made 2. Cor. 12. able by Gods holie grace, to resist & ouercome the temptatiōs of the flash, to the end (by like) Resisting of temptatiōs. that no man should take courage by that exā
                  ple, to fight & resist thes temptations as he did. Page 2. he striketh out the promisses made in scripture to virginitie, chastetie, golding of Promisses to Virginitis. our selues for the kingdome of heauen, voluntarie

pouertie and the like: al (I say) he thrusteth out, together with the scripture alleaged for the same. And finally, not to hold the reader any longer in the enumeratiō of thos thinges, which he shal finde almost in euery other leafe of the booke: Page 157. he thrusteth out not only S. Augustin talking of the price of heauē, and of the facilitie to gaine the same; but also striketh out in like maner the very wordes of Christes vvordes thrust out by M. Buny. Mat. 11.
                   Christ him self, saying, the kingdome of heauen doth suffer violence, & men doe lay handfast vpon it by force. And what may be said then (gentle reader) of thes mē, who spare neither Fathers, Doctours, Prophetes, Apostles, nor Christ him self, when they stand in the way against their foolis he herefies?
               
                  AND THIS of thrusting out. But now if OF mangling. OTHER mens sayings. I would speake of mangling. I might say much more, but that this place beareth it not, and therfore thous halt be content (good reader) to accept of one example only among infinite that might be alleaged, and by this one, thou maist make vnto thy self some certaine coniecture of the rest. Page 367. it is handled and proued by me against the impedimēt of delay, how that vvee by deferring our cōuersion, doe alwaies binde our selues to greater penance & satisfaction afterwardes, &c. In which discourse, M. Buny first in steed of the worde, Penāce, vseth alwaies the worde, repētance, (as though al were one) and so runneth on smoothly so long as it wil hold out. And as for the worde Satisfaction, for that he had no other word to put in for it, he thrusteth it cleane out. Then commeth he to S. Cyprian, who saith that, a diligint 
                  Cyp. lib. de laps. & l. 5. epist. 9. ad Corn. 
                  and long medicine is to be vsed to a deepe sore; which wordes M. Buny admitteth and setteth

downe as good and currant. But the other part of the sentēce immediatly following, was, that 
                  The measare of penance. 
                  our penance must be no lesse thē vvas our fault cōmitted, which part M. Buny striketh out of the text, as also al the rest ensuing, wherin S. Cyprian prescribeth, that this penance must be made with teares, watching, wearing of hear-cloth, & the like, which seeme to be thinges nothing pleasant to the bodie of a Minister.
               After S. Cyprian followeth S. Augustin in the very same page, affirming; That it is not sufficient for a sinner, to change his maners, & to leaue of to sinne, except he make satisfaction also to God for his sinnes past by sororrful penance, geuing of almes &c. With which wordes M. Buny would haue nothing to doe, for that they were incorrigible, & therfore he' thrust thē quite out: yet out of S. Hierome, that in the third place insued, he was content to admit thes wordes, Our bodie that hath liued in many delightes must be chastised vvith affliction; our 
                  Hier. ep. 27 ad Lustoch. 
                  long laughing must be recōpenced vvith much vveping. But the wordes immediatly following in the same seutence, (our soft linning and fine silke apparel must be changed into sharpe hear-cloth) seemed to harde to this delicate doctour, and therfore he thrust them quite out.
               In the end of the ranke, came graue S. Ambros, affirming, That vnto a great vvound, a deepe 
                  Intollerable dealing. 
                  & long medicine in needful; Which wordes M. Buay very quietly and courteously let passe. But vpon th' other that immediatly followed, he gaue a deade blow, & thrust them by head & shoulders out of the booke, to wit, Grāde seelus, grādē necessariā habet satisfactionē.

               Now thē (gentle reader) what shal we thinke or say of thes mē or of their maner of dealing?

Haue they honest meaning trow you? Haue A consideration vpon the premisses. they sidelitie? Haue they a conscience? Haue they respect of God or man, that deale in this order? Is it hard to found any new religiō, or to defend it, or to auouch what folie or falsaood soeuer, by this maner of proceeding? If thes mē had habilitie to doe what their consciences would permit thē in the world abrod, what an alteration, what a subuersiō, what a metamorphosis would they make in al matters of antiquitie? If they had to them selues the setting forth of the holy fathers & doctours workes, how would they loppe and circumcise the same? how would they set them foorth in their Ierkins, yea, barehose and doubletes, cutting of al other garmentes and furniture that liked thē not, or were not sutable to the season of thes mens senses? If thes men (I say) had the keeping of al antiquities, of fathers, Councels, and scriptures, & that to thē selues alone in their owne custodie, without the knowledge or cōtradiction of any one Catholique, for the space of only fiue hundred yeares together, (as they graunt we held thē al in our handes for a thousand,) what maner of bookes (trow you) should we finde them? How currant and absolute for the protestant religiō? No doubt but we should heare thē speake euē as Iohn Caluin speaketh in al matters of controuersie, or rather as that good man for the time would haue them to speake, vnto whos handes the last edition of such workes should be committed.
               And thus much shal suffice for discouerie of M. Bunies editiō of my booke, now remaineth ther only a word or two to be saide of the treatise which he adioined, tēding (as he saith) to Pacification.
            
            
               
               Of M. Bunies Pacification.
               AND first of al, a man would thinke that M. Buny did take but a very strange way to pacification, in offering me the greate iniurie which before hath bene shewed, in his editiō. But for that he pretendeth his peace to be towardes the general, by labouring the aduersaries, as his phrase is: I shal be content to passe ouer my particuler, and to examine peaceably what he saieth, and how he laboreth vs to that effect.
               But here againe at the very first enterance, ther riseth a new stoppe against al vnion or pacification with vs, for that he is so singulerly persuaded of the rare light and knowledge of truth which they haue alone among them selues, as he dareth to pronounce, That (to their knovvledge) God neuer yet bestovved the like on others. 
                  Intollerable pride of beretiques. In which asseueratiō for that he excepteth neither the fathers or doctours of the primatiue Church, nor yet th' Apostles them selues, whom we hoped to haue had at least wise for iudges and arbiters in making this peace: what probabilitie can ther be of vnion or composition amōg vs, seing that at the very first word, he maketh his cause better, not only then ours, but also then the case and condition of any other whatsoeuer, since Christes departure frō earth or before? But yet this I wil let passe also, as a vaunt proceeding of an humour peculier to mē of his stampe. For if you goe to al the petie sectes of thes our times, or of any other times that haue bene from the beginning: ech one wil sing the self same song, affirming euery other bodies candel to be out, but only theirs. And if they should not say so, they were not sectes or sectaries, for that they acknowledged

not their true mother, which is pride, and singularitie.
               After this his proud enterāce, he beginneth, his seely discourse: and for methodes sake, maketh many diuisions and subdiuisions, euery thing running therin by couples, wherin he is so fertile and abundant, as by methode he confoundeth al memorie. But yet as I may, I wil here recite the cheef pointes therof.
               First then he saith, that ther is great reasō why we should ioine with them, and none at al why they should yeld to vs. The first he proueth, for that it becommeth the Church of God to be at VVhy vve should ioine vvith protestantes. vnitie in it self. Which reason how far it proueth his purpose, the reader can consider. The second he declareth, for that the gaine that they should receaue by comming to vs, in his opinion should be very smal, both touching VVhy they vvil not ioine vvith vs. matters of religion as also of state. For in religion he maketh his accompt, that they should haue nothing more thē now they haue, except only certaine Sacramentes, Images, and ceremonies (which he calleth representations,) al which he esteemeth of smale auaile. In matters of state likewise, he supposeth the commodities would be few and litle: as namely to be deliuered from the Popes curse, which he saieth, they finde now by experience, not to be so hurtful, as hertofore it was esteemed; which reason (as you know) may as wel serue against Godes curse also, for that it doth not alwaies shew forth presently his sensible effect.
               Next after this, he declareth how that by Their hurtes in yelding to vs. yelding to vs, they should not only not receaue gaine, but also great hurtes, & that in double maner. First in religion, wherin among other things they should be bounde to coafession &

penance, which thinges (saith he) are burdensome and 
                  So much the more certaine to proceede of grace and of Gods special ordinance, for that othervvise men vvould neuer haue receaued thē. 
                  abhorring from mans nature. Then in state, for that by this meane, they should come vnder the gouernement of the Byshope of Rome, which he estemeth intolerable: adding further, that this only reason of state holdeth many of their side, from comming to vs, who otherwise in conscience would-haue no scrupule at al; which is such a confessiō, as I meruail that euer my Lord Archebishope would let it passe in print. For howsoeuer this poore Minister to terrifie the common people, deuiseth bugges vpō the Ecclesiastical authoritie of the bishope Note this. of Rome, if it should be restored in England againe, yet euery man of reason can consider with him self, that the Emperour, the kinges of Spaine, France, Polonia and other Princes, admitting the-same authoritie, doe finde no such incōueniēces, as neither our Princes of Englād euer did, for so many ages together, when they were more potent and glorious then they haue bene since the suppression therof. Wherfore if this reason only doe stay so many from vs, as M. Buny affirmeth, it is very like we shal haue the greater part shortly, when God shal open their vnderstanding in a matter that in it self is so plaine and palpable.
               This being done, he commeth to shew the cōmodities that we should receaue by ioining with them, and thos also (after his maner) he The cōmodities offered to vs in ioining vvith thē. maketh of two sortes. First in religion, and thē in our ciuil state. In religiō (saith he) we should first receaue, the free vse of holie seriptures, (as though amōg vs now ther were no vse therof,) and then also we should be deliuered from the burden of confession and penance, as also from religion. al vowes of chastitie, pouertie, and obedience.

And finally we should so cleaue to Christ alone (saith he) as vve should abandon al other helpes both in heauen and earth, of Angels, Saintes, other men, as also our ovvne. Which (saith he) were a great aduantage. And then he maketh a solemne protestation in thes wordes. If any people can be found 
                  The Protostantes protestation. 
                  in the vvorld, that doe more abādone al other meanes in heauen & earth, then vve doe, then vve must pronounce against our selues, that in this respect they are nerer to this aduantage then vve art. Vnto which protestation notwithstanding, I doubt M. Buny (if he should be wel vrged) would be very much ashamed to stand and cleaue. For albeit I confesse, that he and his felowes doe very litle in deede wherby to helpe them selues by their workes, yet by this reason they should doe far better, ī doing nothing at al. For he that should neuer pray, nor desire other men to pray for him, he that should neuer fast or doe other good deede, but should rather defie the same, and lay al vpon Christes passiō, he should more abandone al other helpes and meanes both in heauen and earth besides Christ, then many of the best protestantes doe.
               Next in our ciuil state, he saith that we should greatly be bettered by ioyning with Cōmodities by yelding, in our ciuil state. them, being made partakers of the blessednes of England, which is greater (as he saith) at this time, then euer it vvas since the lande vvas first inhabited. Wherof he seemeth to alleage two reasons or causes. First, for that Protestantes in Intellerable lying flatterie. thes temporal affaires are alwaies prosperous, for (saith he) how soeuer it goe with others that are not frindes to the ghospel, yet shal the fauorers therof alwaies Hovv doe they prosper at this day in Frā
                     ce and Flā
                     ders? prosper: howsoeuer it be with the residue of the children of Israel, yet the tribe of Iuda shal alwaies florish. The

other places the people are going vnder their burdens, but in England al is mirth and saftie. The second cause of this blessednes of England is, for that England (saith he) is gouerned by a Prince of their owne countrie, one that dealeth mildly with them, one that sendeth not ther pleas abrod to other cōsistories, one that drieth them not vp with exactions. And when conuenient collections are made, the mony that is exacted of subiectes is not sent (saith he) Note this blessednes. out of the realme to the maintenance of forraine powers, but is imployed at home, to their honour and defence. Wherin notwithstanding it seemeth that this good man, talketh rather by meditation or fiction, then by any great intelligence he hath in such affaires.
               After al this, he goeth about to remoue certaine graue impedimentes, which he imagineth The remouing of impediments. doe let many Catholiques from coming vnto their side. For which cause he sheweth, first, that we Catholiques should not leese altogether our credites by making vs Protestantes, or at least wise we should not leeso the same Of discredit. with them that be good and of their side: or if we did somewhat impare the same, yet patiēce were to be vsed, for the Ghospels sake. In like maner he sheweth that the holie saintes of heauen would not be angrie with vs (as we seeme to doubt) for leauīg their patronage. Also that keruers, kandlemakers, belcasters, organistes, and other such like, who might feare Of hurtes. to want by following the Ghospel, albeit in truth they should leese no smale part of their gaine, yet might the matter be eased, and they comforted otherwise.
               Thus discourseth this wise man in very great sadues. And after al this, he hādleth diuers other

pointes both of controuersies in religion, & of the harde dealings of the Protestant magistrate towardes Catholiques in Englād, wherwith he supposeth many are staied from comming vnto them, but al, with as great discretion and foundation as he hath done the former, demanding of vs in very good earnest, why we should stand so much vpon Limbus Patrum, vpon Christes descending into hel, vpō real presence, freedome of wil, and merit of workes, vpon traditions, preestood, and sacrifice, vpon worshiping of Saintes and Images, mariage of preestes, inherent iustice, and the fiue Sacramē
                  tes that we numbre more then they doe? why (I saie) we should so relie and sticke vpon thes thinges, as for their sakes not to ioyne with thē and be Protestantes, wheras notwithstanding al thes thinges, the Protestātes saith (as he saith) Atheisme. and ours is al one in substance, and we al are members of one true Catholique and Apostolique Churche, albeit some of vs be somewhat better members in that Church then others.
               And this last point of the Church (therby Hovv by N. Buny vve are al of one Church. to allure vs the more) he vrgeth very often and earnestly: to wit, that we are al members of one true Church, reprehending greatly his fellow Ministers and brethren, who, vpon indiscrete Zeale (as he saith) vrged first this separation, and did vvrite in not so sensed a maner as they 
                  Page 108. 
                  ought to haue done, adding further; vve are to iustifie that of departing from the Church, ther ought to be no question at al among vs. But what is the cause (thinke you) of this so greate and suddaine curtesie which now at length M. Buny against al custome of his brethren doth offer vnto vs? you shal heare it vttered (if you please)

in his owne wordes, for by cons

                     ing so far vvith them (saieth he) as to graunt that vve are not both of one Church; vve bring our selues to needles trouble. For that it is greate probabilitie vvith them, that so vve make our selues aunsvverable for to finde out a seueral and distinct Church from them, from vvhich vve descende, vvhich hath continued from the Apostles age to this present, els that needes vve must acknovvledge that our Church is sprung vp of late, or at least, since thers: This is his confession; which VVhy protestātes are novv so kinde as to make attonement vvith vs. we hauing heard, we neede not stande any longer in doubt, wherfore he is become so kinde, as at length to make vs al of one true Catholique and Apostolique Church with them, whom hitherto they haue detested as the Sinagogue of Antechrist. Why also M. Buny tooke in hande to write this treatise of pacification, to wit, for that in deede (as he confessed before) He novv perceaueth that men held vvith them, rather for respect of state and ciuil commodities, then of conscience and beleefe. Which The only motiue to protestant religion in England. regarde of temporal commoditie in very truth (Gentle reader) is the only reason or baite that they can lay before vs at this time, wherby to moue vs to come vnto their parte. Which respect and motiue notwithstanding, our Lord knoweth how bare and brickle a matter it is, and how longe or litle while it may endure. But this only thing set a side, in al other respectes, reasons, allurementes, motiues, or considerations, which heauen or earth can yeld, wherby to stirre a Christian minde to embrace any religion, they are al for vs, and none for them; as perhaps hereafter may be declared more largelie, in some special treatisse, which by occasion of this may be taken in hand. In the meane space let this suffice for

answere of so much as M. Buny hath writen in his pacification.
            
            
               Of this present edition vvith certaine instructions to the Reader.
               THER remaineth now then (gentle reader) for the ending of this preface, to admonish the only in a worde or two, what thou hast in this later edition more then in the former, and how thou maist reape the commoditie that is intended and wished to the therin. First, the whole booke hath bene reuewed, and both amplified and bettered in diuers 1. The vvhole booke reuevved. pointes throughout al the chapters that doe remaine as before. Secondly, the title therof is altered as may appeare in the beginning for that the other booke of Christian exercise, 2. The title altered. since the first edition therof, hath bene set foorth a parte by it self.
               Thirdly, diuers treatises and chapters haue bene wholy altered, especially in the first 3. Diuers treatisses altered. part, wher, vpon a purpose of greate breuitie which in the beginning was conceaued, (but afterwardes could not be held) many things were shifted ouer, and diuers discourses knit vp with more imperfection then in the second part therof.
               Fourthly, sundrie new chapters and treatises haue bene added in this edition. And thes 4. Nevv chapters added and vvhy. partly of mine own liking, imagining that the matter might (perhappes) affect other men as much as it did me; among which I may accompt the chapter of examples of true resolution, and some other: Partely also vpon aduertisement of good and reuerend Catholique preestes that liue in England, who finding

by their experience in dealing with mens soules, (as my self also did,) that this long time of schisme and sectes, wherein they heare nothing but weangling and contradictions in matters of courtouersies, (their life in the meane space running at al libertie without discipline, and loding their consciences with infinite burden of sinne;) hath wroght in mens mindes a certaine contempt and carles insensibilitie in thes affaires, esteeming al things to stand vpon probabilitie only of dispute to and fro, and so by litle and litle, doth The greuous temptations of faith that come by heresie. bring them also to thinke the same of Christian religion it self, imagining that the Iewes, Turkes, Saracens and other enimies therof, (being worldly wise men) may haue as greate reason perhaps to stande against the same, as thes later learned men of oar owae time haue, to staud in so many rankes and diuisions of sectes against the Catholique faith, and as the old Philosophers pretended to haue against the being of one God him self.
               Thes thinges (I saie) being so; (which is alwaies the effect of diuision and heresie,) thos vertuous and discrete men were of opinion The reason of particuler chapters added of nevv. that it should not be amisse in this second edition to adioyne two chapters of the certaintie of one God, and of our Christian faith and religion. Besides this, I was admonished by the writinges of our aduersaries since the publishing of my first edition, how they misliked two principal pointes in that booke. First, that I speake so much of good workes and so litle of faith: secondly, that I talked so largely of Godes iustice and so breefly of his mercie. In both which pointes, albeit an indifferent man might haue bene satisfied before, and easilie

perceaue that the aduersarie doth but picke quarels of calumniation: yet to giue more ful contentement in this matter, euen vnto our enemies: I haue besides that which is spoken els wher, (and namely in the 2. and 4. chapters touching faith,) adioyned also a special chapter of the two seueral partes of Christian profession, which are beleefe and life. And for the second, I haue framed a whole new chapter in the begiuning of the second part, intituled; against dispaire of Godes mercie. Thos were the causes of my large and ample additions in this booke.
               And yet was ther besides al thes, one cause more, which also I conceaued by information An other cause of the amplificatio of tins booke. of others. An I this was, that diuers persons (as I was tolde) hauing desire in them selues to reade the former booke, but yet being weake and feartul to be touched so nere in conscience, as they imagined this booke would doe; durst neuer intermedle therwith, being informed that ther was nothing in the same wherwith to intertaine them selues, but only such vehement matter of persuasiō, as would troble and afflict thom. For remedie of which inconueniencie (if it were an inconueniencie,) I haue inserted diuers chapters and discourses of matters more plausiole, and of them selues more indifferent, whervvith the reader may solace his minde, at such times as he findeth the same not willing to feele the spurre of more earnest motion to perfection.
               And to the end he may the better be able to serue him self at al times and to al purposes, The reason of the methode adioined in the ende. of whatsoeuer is contayned within this booke; I haue thought good to set downe in the end of al, a short draught or methode for

the particuler vse of euery part and parcel therof; how it may sorue either to prayer or meditation, or els to instruction, exhortation, consolation, or other effect according to the time and place, or to the neede, state, condition & other qualetie, of the person that shal come to reade the booke.
               Now then (good reader and my deare Christian brother) hauing nothing els at this time to admonishe the of; I wil end this preface The conclusion vvith certaine instructions. and remit the to the reading of the booke it self that followeth; exhorting the most earnestly for thine owne soules sake in the tender bowels of our sweet Sauiour IESVS, that thou reade the same with attention, as matter that appertaineth nearest of al other vnto the, and with al to yeld most hartie and humble thākes to almightie God, that in his Catholique Church fayleth not from time to time to sende diuers strange and stronge meanes, whereby to stirre vp men to consideration of their estate, and to the gayne of their saluation in the life to come. This (I say) by almightie Gods diuine goodnes and prouidence, is ordinarie in his True treating of demotion only in the Catholique Church. spouse the Catholique Church, wher his spirit abideth vntil the worldes end: and it is so in her alone, as it is her proper and peculier possession, and neuer trulie to be founde in them, who liue out of her, albeit for a time and in some pointes they maye haue a shewe or shadoe therof. This we see fulfilled in al heretiques and sectaries both of old and of our daies, who albeit some times they wil seeme to writ bookes, of institutions to manners and good life; yet their doctrine therin being as wilde, as their faith is wandering; they neuer bring any thing to passe, but from worse to worse,

wherof the whole world at this daye doth giue experience. The reason of this in general, VVhy no heretique treateth sincerly of deuotion. may be taken from the nature and spirit of heretiques, described vnto vs for our admonishment in holie scripture, wherof one principal point is, that they shalbe as S. Paul saith, Sine pace, without al rest or peace, and consequently, 2. Tim. 3. 
                  alvvaies learning and neuer attaining to the knowledge of truth. They shal bestow al their time in iangling and quarreling, and in the meane space, as S. Peter wel noteth, they shal vvalke according to their ovvne concupiscences, albeit 2. Pet. 3. they talke neuer so much of mortification and of their quickning spirite, for which cause he calleth them also, illusores, mockers and deceauers; that is, as S. Paul seemeth to interprete the same; fellovves that vvith seigned vvordes shal make their ovvne gaine, and vvhich hauing a shevv of pietie, shal (in life) deny the force or vertue thereof.
               
               And this why heretiques in general can neither teach true pietie and deuotion, not VVhy protestantes of alother sectaries can not teach true pietie. yet giue example therof in their owne liues. But now if we looke into the particuler sectes that are of this our most vnhappie time; we shal finde a more peculier reason why they in special, much lesse may doc the same. For that in truth the very groundes of their opinions doc resist altreating of such affaires; neither can you vrge almost any one point of true pietie, but that 
                     〈◊〉
                   must impugne some principal article of their doctrine. As may appeare by that which hath bene declared before, concerning the places both of fathere and scriptures thrust out by M. Buny in my former booke, wherof also it were not hard to make diuers most cuident demonstrations in this place.
               
                  
For, if (for example sake) you exhort men to labour for their owne saluation, as S. Paul Examples bovv protestantes can not teach piesie of life vvithout imparing their doctrine. did, Philip. 2. ver. 12. then you teach them to put confidence in their owne workes, which with protestantes is abhominable. If you encourage men to suffer in respoct of rewarde, as Christ did, Matth. 5. ver. 12. then fal you flatly vpon the doctrine of merite. If you tel them that heauen is put in their owne handes to gaine, as our Sauiour did, Math. 11. ver. 12. then allow ye not only of morite, but also of free wil. If you wish men to liue in feare and trembling in respect of Gods secret iudgements, and of the vncertaintie of our saluation, as S. Paul did, Phi. 2. ver. 12. Hob. 3. ver. 14. and S. Peter. 2. ep. 3. ver. 17. then impeach you the certaintie of protestantes predestination. If you counsail men to make amendes by good workes forth 
                     〈◊〉
                  : euil life past, as S. Iohn Baptist did, Luke 3. ver. 8. then you reach satisfaction. If you terrifie them with the feare of hel, and with the declaration of the paines in the world to come, as Christ did, Math. 8. ver. 12. then with them you offer iniurie to Gods infinit mercie. If you exhort men to fasting, praying, loue of virginitie, desire of pouertie, chastesing their own bodies, restitutió, penance, and the like, as al the course of holie scripture doth: then runne you into plaine and open papistrie.
               And then (deare Christian brother) what treating can ther be of pietic in life, wher No effect of verme sollovveth vpon the prating of protestants. none of thes important matters may be once named? Truly (good brother) wel may a man vainlie talke in the aire of a quick ening spirite and mstrification, as they are wonte in pastime to doe; but nothing in sinceritie-wil euer be

brought to passe, where thes weightie pointes be not soundly and seriously handled. For take away the mention of thes thinges forth of holie scripture it self, together with the large and frequent exhortations that therin are made vnto them; and very litle wil remaine about other affaires; the cheefe indeuour of Gods holie spirit being bent (as is manifest) to the setting forthe and inculcating of thes matters, aboue al other, vnto Christian people.
               Which spirit of almightie God, the Catholique Church his holie and deare spouse, The spirit of the Catholique Church. taking vpon her to imitate; after the foundation of true faith once laide, calleth vpon her children both daily and hourly by infinit wayes and mianes, to remember and put in vre thes pointes of vertuous life, while her enimies in the meane space, doe lye wrangling and cauiling about contradictions in beleefe. And therfore in the Catholique Churche onlie (gentle reader) shalt thou finde the true spirite of teaching, and of execution of thes pointes touching pietie: within the lappe and bosome wherof if thou alredy be, thou hast humbly and hartely to thanke God for the same, and with al sollicitous diligence and care to make thy gaine of such helpes as she offereth the for attayning thy saluation. But if thou finde thy self in other estate (as alas many may at this daye in our poore afflicted countrie;) then I beseeche the tender marcie of our Soueraine Lord and Sauiour, that by readings of this present booke, thou maist the sooner be moued to make thy selfe partaker both of the one and of the other benefite; that is to saie;

not onlie to enter into the vnion of his Catholique Church, but also (which more importeth) to leade a true Christian and vertuous life within the same. And so to our Lord IESVS I commit the. At S.

general or more often alleaged, then the lacke of consideration, by which as by a The dāger of inconsideration. common snare and decept of our aduersarie, most men fall into synne and are holden also perpetuallie in the same, to their final destruction and eternal perdition.
               So Esay the prophet speaking of the carelesse nobilitie and gentrie of Iurie, that gaue them selues to bāketting & disporte, without consideration of their duties towardes god; repeateth often the threat of vvoe against them, and thé putteth downe the cause i thes wordes: The

                  vvorkes of god you respect not, nor haue you consideration of his doinges. And then insueth: Therfore hath hell enlarged his soule, and opened his mouth vvithout all measure or limitation, & the stoute, and high, and glorious of this people shall descende into it.
               
               Here are two causes (as you see) and two effectes lynked together, of thes Iewes damnation, th' one depending of th' other. For as good cheere and sensualitie brought thes men to inconsideratiō of gods workes and proceedinges towardes synners: so Incosideratiō brought them to the mouth and pittes brymme of hell. I say, that inconsideration of gods workes towardes sinners, brought them to this peril, for that it followeth in the verie same place; And the Lord of hostes shalbe exalted in indgemēt, and our holie god shalbe sanctified in iustice; as if he had sayed,

that albeit you will not consider now gods iudgemétes and iustice, amiddest the heate and pleasure of your seastinges: yet shall he by excercising the same vpon you hereafter, be knowen, exalted, and sanctified throughout the world.
               The like discourse maketh God hym self by the same prophet, to the daughter of Babylon, and by her, to euerie finful and Esa. 47. sensual soule figured by that name. Come downe (sayeth he) & sitte in the dust thou daughter of Babylon: thou hast said, I shal be a Ladye for euer, and hast not put vpon The daughter of Babylon forgetteth her ende. thy harte the thinges thou shouldest, nor hast thou had remembrāce of thy last ende &c.

               Holie Ieremie, after he had weyghed with hym self what miseries for synne the prophetes Esay, Amos, Ozee, Ioel, Abdias, Michaeas, Nahum, Sophonias and hym self (all which prophetes lyued within the cōpasse of one hūdred yeares) had fortolde to be imminent vppon the world; not onlie to Samaria and the ten tribes of Israel, which were now alredie caried into banishmēt to the furthest partes of th' east: but also to the states & coū

                     est qui recogitet corde. The whole earth falleth into extreme ruine & desolation, for that there is no man which considereth depelie in his hart.
               
               This complaint made good Ieremie in his dayes for compassiō of his people, that ranne miserablie to perdition for want of consideratiō. And the same complaint with much more reason may euerie good Christiā make at this tyme, for th' infinite soules of such as perishe daylie by incōsideration.

of Esaye. Therfore, & for this cause, is my people led away captiue in all bondage & slauerie to perditiō, for that they haue no knowledge, no vnderstāding of their owne estate, no forsight of the tymes to come, no consideration of their danger. Herehence floweth all the miserie of my people, and yet this is a mysterie that all men wil not know.
                  Will you see what a mysterie and sealed secret this is? harcken then how one describeth The mysterie of incō

                      the same, and with what circumstances. Furthermore (saith he) a certaine hydden word was spoken vnto me, and mine eare as it were by stealth receiued the veines of his whyspering: it was ī the horror of a vision by night, when deade sleepe is wonte to possesse mē. Feare came vpon me and trēbling, and all my bones were extremely terished. At lēgth a spirit past by, in my presence, wherat the heares of my flesh stoode vp in horrour. There stoode before me one whose face I knew not. His image was before mine eye. & I hard his voyce as the sound of a soft ayer.
               
               Hytherto is described in what maner and order this secret was reueiled: but now what said this visiō or spirit (thinke you) at the last? trulie, he made a shorte discourse to proue by the fall of th' āgels for their synne, that much more,

whose bodies are of flesh), & they, which haue their foundation of earth, (as most folke of this world haue that putt their confidence in thinges of this life;) they must all consume by litle and litle, as tho cloth doth by the mothe, & at lēgth they must vpon the sudden, (within lesse space perhappes thē is from morning to night) be cut downe and dispatched, when they thinke least of it.
               
               And to shew that herein standeth a point of high secresie, (I meane to consider & ponder well this discourse) he maketh his conclusiō in thes wordes immediatlie following; & quia nullus intelligit, in aeternum peribunt. 
               
               And for that few or none of those men before mētioned, who haue such earthlie foundatiōs, doe vnderstand Lack of cōsideratiō cause of eternal destruction. this pointe aright, (I meane of their suddaine death, & cutting of frō this world,) therfore must they perish eternallie, and this is a secrete which few men will belyeue. 
                     Vir insipiens non cognoscet, (saith Dauid) & stultus nō intelliget haec: an vnaduised man wil not learne thes thinges, nor wil a foole vnderstand them:  but what thinges? 
                     Psal. 91. A point that fooles vvill not consuler. it inseweth in the same place: how wonderful the workes of god and how deepe his cogitations are aboute sinners, who sprynge vp as grasse (and florish in this world) vt intereant in seculum seculi, to th' ende they may perish for euer and euer.
               The prophet Daniel had many visions and straunge reuelatiōs of great and high mysteries: but one amongest all other (&

this the least,) of the most dreadful iudgementes of god vppon synners in th' ende of the world. The vision was by the great ryuer Tigris; wher, as diuers angels were Dan. 10. attending about the bankes; so vpon the water it self, stood one in the likenes of a A most terrible vision of Daniel vvherī he savv Christ. man, of exceeding dreadful maiestie; his apparrel being onlie lynninge, through which his bodie shyned like pretious stone; his eyes like burnig lampes, his face like flashinge lightening, his armes and legges like brase inflamed, and his voice as the shoote of a whole multitude of people that should speake together.
               This was Christ by all interpretation: at whose terrible presence when Daniel fel downe dead, he was erected againe by an Angel and made strong to abyde the vision, and so hauing hearde and seene the most wonderful thinges that ī his booke he recompteth; he was bold to aske a question or two, for better vnderstanding therof, and his first question was, hovv long it should bee, ere thes most vvōderful things tooke 
                  Dan. 12. 
                  their ende? VVherunto the man vpon the water answered, by stretching out both his brasen armes to heauen, and swearing straūgelie, by hym that liued for euer and euer; that it should be a tyme, and tymes, and halfe a tyme. Which answer, Daniel not vnderstāding, began to question further, but he was cutt of with this dispatch: Goe thy 
                  A secret. 
                  vvay Daniel, for thes speeches are shutt vp and sealed vntil the tyme preordained. And yet for his futher instruction it was added in the

same place; Impie agent impij, nec intelligent. Wicked men will alwayes doe wickedlie, 
                     Dan. 12. VVilfull ignorance. and will not vnderstand thes mysteries, albeit we should neuer so much expounde them.
               Wherby as by all the rest that hytherto hath ben alleaged, is made apparent, that inconsideration, negligence, carelesse ignorance, and lack of vnderstanding in our owne estates, and in gods iudgementes & proceedinges with iniquitie and synne, hath bene a bane, and a common perditiō of rechelesse men, from tyme to tyme.
               And if we will turne our eyes to this our age much more shall we see the same The cause of so much sinne at this day. to be true. For what is the cause (think you) why at this day, we haue so manie of those people, whom holie Iob doth call abhominable, that drinke vp iniquitie as beastes due vvater, that, committ all synne, all iniustice, Iob. 15. all turpitude, without remorse or scruple of consciēce? what is the cause of this (I say) but lack of consideration, lacke of vnderstāding, lack of knowledge? for as Christ said to Hierusalem touching her destruction, si cognouisses & tu, &c. if thou also (ó sinful soule) diddest Luc. 19. know, what hangeth ouer thy heade for this carelesse life of thine: if thou (daughter of Babylon) wouldest remember and ponder in thy hart what shalbe th' ende Es2. 47. of thes thy delightes: thou wouldest not lyue so pleasantlie as thou doest, Nunc autem abscondita sunt haec ab occuiis tuis. But now (sayeth Christ) thes thinges are hydden Luc. 9.

               Not, but that thou mayst haue knowen them if thou wouldest, but for that thou Voluntarie inconsideration. arte one of them, who say to god, scientiam viarum tuarum nolum', we will not haue vnderstanding of thy wayes; one of them, Iob. 21.

                  Pro. 28. 
                  ne audiat legem, that turne away their eares to th' ende they may not heare gods law: quorum oratio est execrabiiis, whose not onlie Ibid. life, but also prayer is execrable and detestable in the sight of their maker.
               Truelie, nothing in reason can be lesse tollerable in the presence of gods Maiestie, then wheras he hath published a law vnto vs with so greate charge to beare it in mynde, to ponder in harte, to studdie & Dent. 6. & 11. Iosue 1. Psal. 118. Eccle. 6. & 22. meditate vpon it both day and night, at home and abrode, at our vpry singe and at our downe lyinge; to make it our cogitatió, our discourse, our talke, our excercise our rumination, and our delight: that we should notwithstanding so contemne the same, as to make it no part of our thought, but rather to flee the knoledge therof, as we see most men of the world doe, for not troubling their consciences.
               But the holie Ghost hath layed downe the reason hereof long agoe in these wordes: cum sit timida nequitia, dat testimoniū
                   
                  Ecclo 17. 
                  condemnationis. For that wickednesse in it

self, is alwayes' fearfull, it gyueth witnesse The first cause vvhy men slie cōsideratiō. against it self of damnation, when so euer it thinketh of the law of god, or of honestie. So Felix the gouernour of Iurie when S. Paul began to talke of iustice, chastitie, and gods iudgmentes before hym; he was wonderfullie a feard, and said to Act. 24. Paul, that he should departe for that tyme: and that he vvould call for hym againe aftervvard, vvhen occasion should require. But he neuer dyd, and what was the cause? For that (as Iosephus testifieth) he was a wicked man Ioseph. li. 20 antiq. cap. 5. & Drusilla his fayre ladie that was with hym at S. Pauls speeche, was not his true wife, but taken by allurement and violence from an other, and therfore it offended them both to heare preaching of chastitie.
               This then is one principall cause, whie men of this world will not enter into consideration of their owne estate, and of gods cōmandementes, least they should reade and see their owne faultes, & beare witnesse against thē selues, of their owne condemnation. Wherunto the scripture annexeth an other cause, not far vnlike to this, which is, that worldlie men doe so dro vne them selues in the cares and cogitations The second cause vvhy men slye cōsideratiō. of this life, as they leaue in their mindes no place to thinke vpon gods affaires, which are the busynes of their owne soules. This expresseth Ieremie the prophet most effectuallie, when hauing made his complaint, that not withstānding Iere. 7. his preaching and crying in the templegate,

for long tyme together, where all the people passed by hym and heard hym; yet no man (sayeth he) would enter into consideration, or say with hym self, vvhat haue I donne? wherof he addeth presentlie the cause and reason;  
                     omnes enim conuersi sunt 
                     Ierem. 8. 
                     ad cursum suum, quasi equus impetu vedens ad praelium. All men are sett vpon their owne courses and wayes, and doe runne in the same, with as great vehemēcie and fearse obstination, as a furious armed horse, whē he heareth the trompett in the beginning of a battaile.By which cōparison the holie ghost expresseth verie lyuelie, the irrecouerable state of a setled worldlie man, that followeth greedilie his owne designmentes in the negotiation of earth.
               Thes are two of the chyefe causes of inconsideration, I meane, wilful malice, and obstinate occupation in the vanities The third cause of incōsideratiō. of this life. And yet mētioneth the scripture, a third sorte also of inconsiderate men, who nether of direct malice, nor yet of greate occupatiō in worldlie affaires, doe neglect consideration, but rather of a certaine lightenesse and idle negligēce, for that they will not trouble their heades with any thing but disporte and recreation, of whom it is written: aestimauerūt 
                  Sap. 15. 
                  lusum esse vitā nostra. They esteeme this life of ours to be but a plai-game. And in an other place of the same mē: ita securi 
                  Eccle. 8. 
                  viuunt quasi iustorum facta habeant. They lyue as securelie and considentlie without care or cogitation, as if they had the good

workes of iust men to stand for them. But as the holie Ghost pronoūceth in the same place; 
                     hoc vanissimum, this is vanitie and folie in the highest degree.
               
               For as in thinges of this life, he were but a foolish marchant, that for quietnes A comparison. sake would neuer looke into his accōptbookes whether he were behind hand or before: and as that ship-master were greatelie to be laughed at, that for auoiding of care, would sett downe and make good cheere, & let the shippe goe whether she would: so much more in the busines of our soule is it madnesse and follie, to flye consideratiō for eschuyng of trouble, seing in th ende this negligence must needes turne vppō vs much more trouble and irremediable calamitie.
               For as Ieremie sayeth to all such men, in nouissimo dicrum intelligetis ca, in the ende 
                     Iere. 30. & 23. In the end ynel men shall vnderstand vvhether they vvill or no. of your dayes, you shall not chuse but know, & see, and vnderstand thes thinges which now for delicacie you will not take the paines to thinke of. But when shall this be trow you? he telleth plainlie in the same place: vvhen the furie of our lord shall come foorth as a vvhirle vvinde, and shall rushe and rest vppon your heades as a tempest; then shall you know and vnderstand thes thinges.
               It seemeth that the Babylonians were The exā

                  sideration (as all wealthie people are,) not only by that which before hath bene touched of the daughter of Babylon, that

would not consider her endinge dayes; Esa. 47. but also, for that not long before the most terrible destruction of that greate Citie, by the Medes and Persiās, God cried vnto her in thes wordes: My deerlie beloued Esa. 21. Babylō, put aside the table and stand vppon thy watch: rise vp you princes from eating and drinking; take your targetes in your handes; goe, and set a watcheman vppon the walles, and what so euer he seeth, let hym tell you.And then was there a watcheman sett vppon the wales, and a Lyō to denounce with open mouth, what soeuer danger he saw comming towardes them. And God taught the people to crie in this sorte to their sentinel or watchman: Esa. 21. 
                  
                     Custos quid de nocte? custos quid de nocte? Thow watcheman, what seest thou coming towardes vs by night? what espyest thou (ò sentinel) drawing on vs in the darkenesse?
               
               By all which circūstance, what els is VVe must stand vpon our vvatch insinuated, but that god would haue vs stād vppon our watch, for that his iudgementes are to come vppon the world by night, when men least thinke therof? Luc. 12. they are to come as a theese at mid-night, as also in an other place we are admonished: and therfore happie is the man that shal be founde watcheful.
               But now the dore and sole entrance Cōsideratiō the onelie dore to our vvatch. into this watch, wherof the securitie of our eternal life depēdeth, can be nothing els but consideration. For that, where no cōsideratiō is, there can be no watch, nor

fore-sight, nor knowledge of our estate; & consequentlie no hope of saluation, as Bern. lib. 1. de consid. holie S. Bernard holdeth; which thing caused that blessed man to wryte fyne whole bookes of consideration to Eugenius.
               Consideration is the thing which bringeth vs to know both god and our selues. And touching god, it layeth before vs his Maiestie, his mercie, his iudgementes, his commandemēts, his promisses, his threatninges, his proceeding with other men before vs, wherby we may gather what we also in tyme must expect at this hādes.
               And for our selues, consideration is the keye that openeth the dore to the closet The manie cōmodities of consideration. of our hart, where all our bookes of accompt doe lye: it is the looking glasse, or rather the verie eye of our soule, wherby she taketh the vew of her self, and looketh into all her whole estate: Into her riches, her debtes, her dueties, her negligēces: her good guiftes, her defectes, her saftie, her dāger; her way she walketh in, her course she followeth, her pace she holdeth, and finallie, the place and ende wherto she draweth. And without this consideratiō, she runneth on hedlong into a thousand brakes and bryars, stumbling at euerie steppe into some one inconuenience or other, and continuallie in perill of some great and deadlie mischiefe.
               And wonderful (trulie) it is, that in all other busines of this life, men can see and confesse, that nothing may be ether begunne,

prosecuted, or well ended without consideratiō, and yet in this greate affaire, of gayning heauen, or falling into hell, few thinke consideration greatelie necessarie to be vsed.
               I might stand here to shew th' infinite other effectes and commodities of consideration, as that it is the watche or Effectes

               Our Faith is confirmed & increased by consideration of gods workes and miracles; our Hope by cōsideratiō of his promisses, Hovv all vertues are stirred vp & quickened by consideration. and or the true performance therof to all them that euer trusted in hym: our Charitie or loue of god, by consideration of his benefites and innumerable desertes towardes vs: our Humilitie, by cōsideratiō of his greatenesse, and of our owne infirmitie: Our Courage & Fortitude, by cōtē
                  plation of his assistance in all causes for his honour: our Contempte of the world, by consideration of the ioyes of heauen eternall: and so all other vertues both moral and deuine, doe take their heate, and quickening, and vital spirite from consideration.
               By th' excercise of consideratiō and meditation

holy Dauid sayeth, that he felt a Psalm. 38. burning fyar to flame within his breast; that is, the fyar of zeale, the fyar of feruour in religion, the fyar of deuotion, the fyar of loue towardes god and his neighbour. And in an other place he sayeth, that by the same excercise, he svvept and purged his ovvne spirit, which is to be vnderstoode, Psal. 76. from the dust of this world, from the dregges of synne, from the cōtamination and coinquination of humaine creatures, for that consideration in deede is the verie fanne that seuereth and driueth away the chaffe from the corne.
               For which cause we shall neuer reade of any holie man from the beginning of the worlde, nether before Christ or after, The exercise of holy men touching consideration. who vsed not much and familiarlie this moste blessed excercise of cōsideration & pondering. And for the first three Patriarches, it shalbe sufficient to remember the custome of yonge Isaac recorded in Genesis. VVhich was, to goe foorth towardes

And this he did being yet but a childe and vnmarryed (far different from the custome of yong gétlemé now a dayes who frequent the fieldes to follow their vanities): And as litle Isaac could not haue this custome but from his father Abraham, so (no doubt) but he taught the same to his sonne Iacob, and Iacob againe to his posteritie.
               
                  
And as for Moyses and his successor Iosue, it may easelie be imagined how they Moyses & Iosue. vsed this excercise, by the most earnest exhortations, which they made therof to others in their speech and writinges. The Deut. 6. & 11. good kinges of Iuda also, notwithstāding their many great temporal affaires, doe testifie of them selues cōcerning this excercise; Ios. 1. as Dauid almost euery where, that the commandementes of god were his daylie meditation, not onlie by day and that,

                  tota die all the day, & per singuios dies, euerie day, & in matutino, in the morning, & septie 
                  Psalm. 38. 62. & 118. 
                  in die, seuē tymes a day: But also he insinuateth his custome by night; meditatus sum nocte cum corde meo, I doe meditate by night in Psal. 76. my harte vppon thy commaundementeso Lord; signifying hereby, both his watchfulnes by night, when other men were a sleepe, and the hartie care that he had of this exercise which we esteeme so litle.
               Salomon also king Dauides sonne, so 
                     K. Salomō. long as he liued in the grace and fauour of god, obserued this excercise of his father, and exhorteth other men, to haue continual 
                  Eccle. 6. 
                  and daylie cogitation in this affaire. VVhich if hymself had continued still, it is liklie he had neuer fallen from god by women as he did. The good king Ezechias is reported 
                     K EZechias. to haue meditated like a doue, that is, in silence & solitarines with hymself alone, which is the true way of profitable Esa. 58. meditation. Esaye testifieth of his owne watching by night in this excercise, and Esa 26. how he did the same with his spirite

alone in the verie bowels of his harte.
               Holy Iob maketh mention not onlie of The consideration that Iob vsed and the seuites therof. his maner of considering, but what also he cōsidered, & what effect he found in hym self by the same. First he considered (as I said) the wayes, foot-stepes, & cōmandemetes of god, & thé his dreadful power to witt; how no man was able to auerte or turne away his cogitation, but that his sowle did what soeuer it pleased, and by this (sayeth he,) 
                  
                     considerans eum timore sollicitor. 
                     Iob. 23. I am made sollicitous or watcheful with feare. when I doe consider hym. In which wordes he insinuateth two most excellent effectes of cōsideratiō; first, the Tvvo effectes of consideration. Esa. 32.
                   feare of god, of which it is writen, salutis the saurus timor Drnini, the feare of God, is the treasure of saluation; and the second that by this feare he was made sollicitous, watchfull, and diligent in gods seruice, of whiche the prophet Micheas saith thus. I vvil tell the (ò man) vvhat is good Mich. 6. and vvhat our Lord requireth at thie handes: to witt, to doe iudgement, and loue mercie and to vvalke sollicitous and vvatchfull vvith thie God.
               
               But ò thou holie and blessed man Iob, A consideration vpon the doinges of Iob. Iob. 9. did this excercise of consideration, bring foorth in thee so greate feare and terror of god? and so carefull watchfulnes for obseruing his cōmandementes? now I see well the cause, why thou wrytest of thv self, that thou dydste doubte and feare all thy workes and actions, were they neuer so circumspect. But what shall we say

now a dayes (most happie Sainte) who do not doubt so much as our owne dissolute, careles, and inordinate actions, who feele no terror of God at all, nor doe vse anie one iote of watchfulnes in obseruing his commandementes? trulie, this proceedeth of nothing els, but of inconsideration: it proceedeth of lacke of knowledge both of god and of our selues. For (doubtelesse) yf we knewe eyther of thes two thinges a-right, (as in deede neyther of them can be well vnderstoode without th other,) it could not be, but that manie of vs would chaunge our wrong courses.
               O merciful Lord, what synful māin the world would lyue as he doth, if he knew ether thee or hymself as he should doo? I meane, if he considered what thou arte, & what thou hast bene to other that lyued & cōtinued in synne as he doth? Not without greate cause, cried so often and earnestlie to the, that holy Doctor of thy church, for obteyninge of thes two poynctes at thie handes: vt cognoscam te, vt cognoscam me, that Augustin. in lib. cō
                     fess. I may know thee, and that I may know my selfe, saith he: that is, that I may consider, and feele the true knowledge hereof, for many men doe knowe, but with lytle commoditie.
               We know and beleeue in grosse the mysteries of our faith, that there is a god Knovvledg and beleefe in grosse. who rewardeth good andeuel, that he is terrible in his councels vpon the sonnes of men; that there is a hell for synners, a heaué for good lyuers, a most dreadful day

of iudgement to come, a straite accompt to be demanded, and the lyke. All this we know and belieue in general, as marchandise wrapped vp together in a bundle. But for that we vnfolde not thes thinges, nor rest vpon them in particuler; for that we lett them not downe into our hartes, nor do ruminate on them with leasure and attention; for that we chue them not well in mynde by deepe consideration, nor doe disgest them in hart, by the heat of meditation: they remaine with vs as a sworde in his scaberde, and do helpe vs as lytle vnto good lyfe (for which they were reueiled) as a preseruatiue in our pocket A similitude. neuer applyed, can helpe our health. We beare the general knowledge of thes mysteries locked vp in our breastes, as sealed bagges of treasure that we neuer told nor opened, and consequentelie, we haue nether feeling, sense, or motion therby; euen as a man may carye fyar about hym in a flynt stone without heate, and perfumes in a pommander without smell, except th' one be beaten aud th' other chafed.
               All standeth then (good reader) in this one poinct, for direction of our selues in The importance of cō
                     sideration. this lyfe, and for reaping benefit by the mysteries of our faithe and religion; that we allot our selues tyme to meditate, ponder, and consider what thes thinges doe teache vs. For as the sycke man, that had most excellent remedies and precious potions set before hym, could expect no profit or ease therby, if he onlie dyd

looke vpon them, or smeld them, or toke them into his mouthe alone, or should cast them foorthe of his stomache agayne, before they were setled or had tyme to worke there operatiō: euen so is it in this case of ours. And therfore with greate reason said S. Paul to Timothie, after he had taught hym a lōge lesson. Haec meditare. 
                  1. Tim. 4 Meditate, consider, and ponder vpon thes thinges which I haue shewed you: as if in other wordes he had said, all that hytherto I haue told you or written for your instruction, and all that euer you haue heard or learned besydes, will auayle you nothing for your saluation, except you meditate and ponder vpon the same, and do sucke out the iuyse therof, by often consideration.
               
               Wherfore to conclude this chapter, my deare and wel beloued brother, for that The cōclusion of the chapter. consideration is so precious, and profitable, so needful and necessarie a thinge as hathe bene declared; I thought it cōueniēt in this first fronte and entrance of my booke, to place the mention and diligent recommendation therof, as of a thinge most requisite for all that insueth. For without consideration, nether this that I haue saide alredy, nor any thing els that shall or may be said hereafter, cā yeld thee profit, as by most lamentable experience we see daylie in the world, wher manie millions of men, passe ouer their whole The miserie of the vvorld. age without takinge profit of so manie good bookes, so manie preachinges so

manie vertuous examples, so many terrible chastismentes of God vpon synners which euerie wher they see before their face. But yet, for that they will not, or haue not leasure, or dare not, or haue no grace, to enter into consideration therof: they passe ouer all, as sickmen doe pills, diuertinge as much as they may, both their eyes and cogitations, from all suche matters as are vngrateful vnto them.
               But as good Ieremie sayth, the tyme will come, when they shalbe inforced to see Iere. 30. & 23. and know and cōsider thes thinges, when perhappes it will be to late to reape great confort or consolation therby. Wherfore (deare brother.) that which perforce thou must doe in tyme to come, and that perchance to thy greater damnation, (I meane to enter into consideratiō of thyne owne estate:) doe that now willinglie to thie conforte and merite, for preparinge the waye to thy saluation. Preuent the daye and redeeme the tyme, accordinge to S. Pauls wise councel: runne not head-long Ephes. 5. with the worlde to perdition: staye some tyme as holie Ieremie admonisheth the, and say to thy self, vvhat doe I? whether Ierem. 7. doe I goe? what course hold I? what shalbe myne ende? Take some tyme from thy pleasures, and from the companie of thy pleasant friendes to doe this, althoughe it be with some losse of pastyme and recreation: for I assure the, it will recompence it self in th' ende, and make the merye when thy laughinge fryndes shall weepe.
               
                  
Th' effect of all the considerations that Th' effect of all the chapters follovvinge. insewe, is, rightlie to know god, for by knowinge hym, we shall know our selues, and all thinges els whiche are necessarie for vs to know; and without knowinge hym all knowledge ī the world is vanitie and meere follve. haec est vita eterna (sayeth Christ to his father) vt te cognoscant solum Deum verum. Et quem misisti Iesan Christian. 
                  Ioh. 17. This is lyfe euer lastinge, that man know thee, which art onlie true god, and Iesus Christ whome thou hast sent.
               Gods nature and essence we can not know in this lyfe; but the onely meane to know god in this world, is, to know his Maiestie, to know his mercie, to know The vvaye to knovve god in this life. his iustice, to know his iudgementes; to know his hatred to synne, his fauour to the goode, his benefites, and promisses, to all: his grace, his threates, his wayes, his cōmandemites, his dealinges towards other men before vs; all which things the cōsiderations followinge doe sett before our eyes, and consequentelie, they doe teach vs to know god a-right. Reade them therfore (deare brother) with attention and rememember the wordes that God vseth to vs all; vacate & videte quoniam 
                  Psal. 45. 
                  ego sum Deus. Take leasure, and consider that I am a God. It must not be donne in haste, nor (as the fashion is) for curiositie onlie, to reade three or fower leaues in one place, and so in an other: but it must be dóne wich such serious attentió, as appertaineth to so great a busynes which

(in trueth) is the weightiest that possiblie vnder heauen, may be takē in hand. It is the busines wherof Christ meant especiallie, when he said, vnumest necessarium, one onlie thing is necessarie. For that all Luc. 10. other thinges in this world are but trifles to this, and this alone of it self, of more importance, then they all.
            
            
               
               THAT THERE IS A GOD, WHICH REWARDETH. GOOD AND EVYLL, against all Artheistes of olde, and of our tyme. VVith the proofes alleaged for the same, both by Ievve and Gentile. CHAPT. II.
               IT is a thing both common and ordinarie A common: custome in sciences, to, suppose principles. in sciēces & artes whō they are learned or deliuered by other; to suppose diuers poī
                  tes and principles, and to passe them oaer without proofe, as ether knowen before to the learner, or els so manifest, casie, and euident of them selues, as they neede no other proofe, but onely declaration.
               So when we take in hand to instruct a An example in cheualrie. man in chvualrie, or feates of armes; we doe sappose that he knoweth before (were he neuer so rude,) what a man,

what a horse, what armour, what fighting meaneth: as also that warre is lawful and expedient in diuers cases; that princes of the world may wage the same; that soldiars haue to liue in order and discipline vnder their regiment; 2nd that kinges for this cause doe hold their Generales, Lieutenantes, Coronels, Captaines, and other like officers in their bandes, garrisons, campes, and armies.
               In manual artes and occupations likewise, it is euidēt, that diuers thinges must In handycraftes. be presupposed to be foreknowen by the learner, as in husbadrie or agriculture; in buylding, in paynting, and other such excercises, when a man is to be taught or instructed, it were not conuenient for the teacher, to stand vppon euerie pointe or matter that apperteineth to the same, but must leaue and passe ouer many things as apparent of them selues, or easilie to be discerned of euerie learner by nature, sense, reason, or common experiēce.
               But yet in liberal sciencies and professions of learning, is this more apparent, In liberal sciences. where not onely such commō and vulgar poītes are to be presumed, without proofe or discourse; but also certaine propositiōs are to be graunted in the beginning, as Growndes to be graū

So the Logitian (for example) wil haue you yelde ere he enter with you; that contradictorie propositions can not be together ether false or true, nether, that one thing may be affirmed and denied of an other
                  
                  in one and the self same respect and tyme.
               
               The Moral philosopher will haue In Moral Philosophie. you graunte at the beginning, that ther is both: good and euyl in mens actions: and that the one is to be follovved and the other refused. The Natural Philosopher wil haue you confesse, In natural Philosophie. that all physicall bodies which depende of nature, haue motion in themselues and are subiect to alterations, and vvhat soeuer is moued, is moued of an other. The Mathematique at his first enterance, will In the Mathematiks. demande your assent, that euerie vvhole is bygger then his parte; as also, the Metaphysique or supernatural Philosopher, that nothing can bee and not bee, at one tyme. And so In Metaphysike. other such lyke principles and common growndes, in thes and all other sciences are to be demanded, graunted, and agreed vppon at the beginning, for the better pursute and establishment of that which hath to follow, being thinges in them selues (as you see,) eyther by nature, comon sense, or experience most cleare and manifest.
               And is not this also in diuinitie, (trow you,) & in the affaires that we haue now In Diuinitie. in hand? yes trulie, if we beleeue S. Paul who writeth thus to the hebrues: Credere oportet accedētem ad Deum, quid est, & inquirē
                     tibus 
                  Heb. 11. 
                  se remunerator sit. He that is in cōming towardes God, must beleeue that there is a God, & that he is a rewarder to such as seeke hym. Behold here two principles, wherin a man must be resolued before he Tvvo principles in diuiritie. cā seeke or draw neere vnto god. The one,

                  that ther is a god, and the other, that the same 
                  
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     . 
                        〈◊〉
                     . 
                  god is iust to revvard euerie man that seeketh hym according to his desertes.
               
               VVhich two principles or general groūds are so euidēt in dede of their owne natures, and so ingrassed by gods owne hande, into the mynde and vnderstanding of euerie particuler man, at his natiuitie, (according to the saying of the prophet: the light of thy countenance is sealed vpon vs, ò Lord,) that were not the tymes we lyue Psal. 4. in, to-to wicked, and the shameles induration of sinners intollerable: we should not neede to stande vpon the proofe of thes pointes, for confirmatiō of our cause that we now intreate, of resolution: but rather, supposing and assuring our selues, that no reasonable creature lyuing, could doubt of thes principles; should pursue onely the consideration of other thinges that might stirre vp our wills to perfourmance of our duties towardes this God that hath created vs, and remaineth to paye our rewarde at th' ende.
               But for so muche as iniquitie hath so aduaūced her selfe at this day, i the hartes The cause of this chapter. of many, as not onely to contemne and offend theyr maker, but also to denye hym, for patronage of their euyl life, and for exstinguishing the worme of their owne afflicted and most miserable consciences: I am inforced before all other thinges, to discouer this fonde and fowle errour of theirs, and to remoue also this refuge of desperate iniquitie, by she wing the inuincible

veritie of thes two prīciples, th' one depending of the other, in suche sorte, as the first being proued, the second hath of If ther be a God, he is a iust revvarder. necessitie to follow. For if once it be manifest, that there is a God, which hath care and prouidence of all thos, whome he hath created and gouerneth; thē must it insue by force of all consequence, that he is also to rewarde the same men according to their merites and desertes of this life.
               First then to proue this principle, that there is a God, I neede vse no other argument, or reason in the world, but onlie, to referre eche mā to his owne See Lactantius at large in his booke of the vvorkmāshipe of the vvorld. sense, in beholding the world, wherof euerie parte and portion is a most cleere glasse, representing God vnto vs, or rather a sayre table wherin God hath drawen & imprinted The vvorkes of the vvorld doe declare the vvorkman. hymself, in so manifest characters and legible letters; as the simplest man lyuing may reade and vnderstand the same.
               In respect hereof said the wise man so longe agoe. That vaine and foolishe were all thos who cōsidering the workes that are sene in this world, could not therby rise to vnderstād the worke-man. And he Sap. 13. gyueth this reason,  
                  
                     a magnitudine enim speciei creaturae, cognoscibiliter poterit Creator horum videri. For that by the greatenes of bewtie in the creature, may the Creator therof be sene and knowen. Which S. Paul cōfirmeth when he sayeth, that the inuisible Rom. 1. thinges of God, may be sene and knowen by the visible creatures of this

world. Which is to be vnderstoode in this sense, that as a prisonner in a dungeon may easilie by a little beame that shyneth in at a chyncke, conceaue ther is a sunne, from whence that beame descendeth: and as a trauailer in the wildernesse that falleth vpon some channel or brooke, may ascende by the same to the well or fontaine: euen so, he that beholdeth and cōsidereth the wonderful workes of this world, may therby conceaue also the wonderful Artificer or workeman that made them.
               If a man should passe by sea into some A Similitude. foraine, strāge, & sauuage countrie, wher nothing els but birdes and beastes did appeare; yet if he should espie some exquisite building or other worke of arte and reason in the place; he would presentelie assure hymself, that some men dwelt or had bene in that countrie, for that suche thinges could not be donne by beastes or vnreasonable creatures: euē so in the vew and consideration of this world.
               If we cast our eyes vpon the heauens; we remaine astonished, with the miracles The Heauens teache God. that we behold: but who made them? we see the skyes of exceedīg huge highenes; distinguished with colours and bewtie most admirable; adorned with starres and planetes innumerable, and thes so qualified with theyr diuers and different and vnequal motiōs, as albeit they neuer moue or goe together: yet doe they neuer gyue lett or hynderance th' one to th' other, nor chāge there course out of order or season.
               
                  
                  
                     Quis enarrabit caelorum rationem, & concentum caeli, quis dormire faciet? Who is able to Iob. 28. declare the reason of thes heauēs, or who can make cease or sleepe the vniforme course of theyr motion; saith God to Iob? As who would say, that because no man or mortal creature can doe this; therfore may we imagine of what power and perfection their maker is. Which king Dauid had donne when he pronounced,  
                     caeli enarrant 
                     Psal. 18. 
                     gloriam Dei, & opera manuum eius, annunciat firmamentum. The heauens declare the glorie of God, and the firmament doth preache the workes of his handes vnto vs.
               
               If we pull downe our eyes from heauen, The earth teacheth vs God. to earth; we behold the same of an infinite bignesse, distinguished with hills and dales, woodes & pastures; couered with all varietie of grasse, herbes, flowers and leaues; moistened with riuers, as a bodie with veines; inhabited by creatures of innumerable kindes and qualities; inriched with inestimable and endeles treasures: and yet it self standing, or hanging rather with all this weighte and poise, in the middest of the ayer, as a litle balle without proppe or pillar. At which deuise and most wonderful miracle, God hym self, as it were, glorying, said vnto Iob. VVhere 
                  Iob. 38. 
                  vvere thou, vvhen I layed the foundations of th' earth? Tell me if thou haue vnderstanding, vvho measured it out, or drevv his lyne vpon the same? VVheruppon are fastened the pillars of his foundation, or vvho layed the first corner stone
                  
                  therof?
               
               If we looke nether vp nor downe, but cast our countenance onlie a side: we espie The Sea shevveth God. the sea on eche hand of vs, that invironeth rounde about the lande. A vaste crcature, that conteineth more wonders theu mans tongne can expresse. A bottemlesse gulfe, that without running ouer, receaueth all riuers which perpetuallie doe flow. A resteles fight & turmoile of waters, that neuer repose netherday nor night. A dreadful, raging, and furious elemēt, that swelleth, and roareth, & threateneth the lade, as though it would deuoure it all at once. And albeit in situation it be higher then the earth, as the philosopher sheweth, & Aris:. lib. de mirabilibus. doe make assaultes daylie towardes the same, with most terrible cries and waues mounted euen to the skie: yet when it draweth neere to the lande, and to his appointed borders; it stayeth vpon the suddaine, though nothing be there to let it, & is inforced to recoile backe againe, mur muring as it were, for that it is not permitted to passe any further.
               Of which restrainte, God asketh Iob this question. VVho hath shutt vp the sea vvith gates, vvhen he breaketh forth in rage as 
                  Iob. 38. 
                  from his mothers vvombe? Wherunto no man being able to gyue answer, God ansuereth hym self in thes wordes. I haue limited hym vvith my boundes, & I haue set hym both a dove and a barre, and haue said vnto hym, hytherto shalt thou come, and shalt not passe further; here shalt thou breake thie svvelling vvaues.
               
               
                  
This in summe, is of thinges without vs. But if we should leaue thes, and enter The things in man declare God. to seeke God within our owne selues, whether we consider our bodies or our soules, or any one parte therof, we shall finde so manie straūge thinges, or rather so manie seas of miracles and wonders, that preach and teach their maker vnto vs; as we shall not onlie perceaue and see God most euidentlie, but rather (as a certaine Iamblicus de Myst. cap. 1. old heathen hath writen,) we shall feele and handle hym in his workes. Which kinde of speech also S. Paul hym self doubteth not to vse, affirming, that  God hath geuen space to euery man in this life to seeke hym, siforte attractent cum aut inueniat, if perhappes they would handle hym, or Act. 17. finde hym oute. Which maner of wordes doe siguifie, that by consideration of gods creatures, and especiallie of the wonders in man hym self, we may come to see and perceaue the Creator so cleerlie; that in a sorte we may be said to feele and handle hym. So iointelie doe all thinges concurre to the manifestatiō of their maker: So manifestelie and effectuallie doe they teach and demonstrate, and painte out God vnto vs: nothing being so lyttle, that declareth not his greatnes, nothing so greate, which acknowdlegeth not his soueraitie, nothing so low, that leadeth vs not vp to behold his maiestie, nothing so highe, that descendeth not to teach vs this veritie.
               It were a labour without ende, to goe about in this place to alleage what might

he saide in the profe of this principle, that there is a God; seing there was neuer yet learned man in the world, ether Gentile or other, that acknowledged and confirmed not the same, being dryuen therunto by the manifest euidencie of the truth it selfe.

                  Epicurus, and some few others that were open Atheistes & denied God: I answer, that some of thes were vtterly vnlearned, Laertius lib. 2. & 4. de vit. philos. and rather sensual beastes then reasonable men; and consequentlie might deny any thing, according to the saying of holie Dauid: the foole said in his hart, there is no God. 
                  Psal. 13. & 52. Others that had some smacke of learning, rather iested at the falshode of their owne Panisme idoles, then denied the being of one true God.
               But the most parte of thes mē, in deede, and such others as in old tymes were accompted Atheistes, denyed not. God so much in words, as in life & factes; such as S. Paul called Atheistes in his dayes, that Rom. 1. Philip. 3. obeyed their bellies, and followed their pleasures in sinne & sensualitie, not vouchsafing to thinke of God in this life, (such was the Epicure, and manie other are at this daye of his profession:) but yet, (as Lactantius well noteth) when the same Lact. lib. 3. institut. men came to be sober, & speake of iudgement (as at their death or other tyme of distresse and miserie;) they were as redye to cōfesse God as any other what soeuer.
               
                  
But for learned men, and people of diseretion, sobrietie and iudgement, there was neuer yet any (were he Iewe or were he Gentile,) that doubted in this veritie, but had meanes of probation to confirme the same, as more particulerlie in the rest of this chapter shalbe declared.
               
                  Hovv the heathens proued there vvas a God. Sect. 2.
                  
                  AMONG the Gētiles or heathē people, those men were all wayes of most credite and estimation, that professed the Philosophers. loue of wisdome, & for that respect were termed philosophers. Who being deuided into diuers sortes & sectes, had fower principal sciēces, wherof they made profession, eche one of thes hauing other lower sciences comprehended vnder it.
                  The first of thes foure, is called Natural Fovver pri cipal sciences. philosophie; the second, Moral; the third; Supernatural, or Metaphysicke; the fowerth, Mathematique. And for the first three, they haue eche one their proper meanes and peculier proofes, wherby to cōuince, that there is a God. The fouerth, which is the Mathematique, for that it The Mathematique proueth not God. hath no cōsideratiō at all of the efficient or final cause of thinges, (vnder which two respectes and considerations onlie God may be knowen and declared to mē in: his world:) therfore this science hath no proper meane peculier to it self, for prouing this veritie, as th' other sciences haue, but receaueth the same as borrowed

of the former.
                  
                     THE NATVRAL phisosopher amóg THE Natural philosopher. the Gentiles, had infinite arguments to proue by the creatures that there was a God, but all he reduced to thre pricipal & general heades, which he termed exMotu, ex Fine, & ex Causa Efficiēte. That is, arguméts drawen from the Motions, from the Endes, and frō the Cause efficient of creatures that we behold; which termes th' examples solowinge, shall make cleare & manisest.
                  Th' argument of Motion, standeth vppó this general ground in philosophie, that 
                        The first argument in natural Philosophie. Arist. lib. 7. & 8. phy. 
                     vvhat soeuer is moued, is moued, if an other. Wherin also is obserued, that in the motions of creatures, there is a subordinatiō th' one to th' other. As for example; thes inferiour bodies vppon earthe, are moued & altered by the ayre and other elemēts; and the elements are moued by the influence and motion of the Moone, Sunne, and other heauenlie bodies; thes planets agayne are moued from the highest Orbe or Spheare of all, that is called, the first mouable, 
                     Primum mobile. a boue which, we cā goe no further among creatures.
                  Now then asketh the philosopher here whoe moueth this first moueable? for if you saye that it moueth it self; it is against our former ground, that nothing is moued in nature, but of an other. And if you saye, that some other thing moueth it; then is the questiō againe, who moueth that other? & so from one to one, vntill you come to some thing

that moueth, and is not moued of an other, and that must be God which is aboue all nature.
                  This was the common argument of Plat. l. 10. de legib. Arist. lib. 8. phys. cap. 5. Plato, and of Aristotle, and of all the best philosophers. And they thought it a demonstration vnauoydable, and it seemeth they were admonished of this argument by consideration of the clocke, whose hammer when it stryketh, sheweth the next wheele wherby it is moued: and that wheele, sheweth an other wheele; An argument taken from the clocke. and so from one to one, vntill ye come to hym that was the first cause of motion to all the wheeles, that is, to the clockemaker hymselfe.
                  Aristotle, to king Alexander, vseth this pretie similitude. That as in a Quyar of Arist. lib. de mūdo. singers, when the foreman hath gyuē the first tune or note, there insueth presentlie a sweete harmonie and consent of all other voyces, both great and small, sharpe A similitude. and meane: So God in the creation of this worlde, hauing gyuen once the first pushe or motion to the highest heauen, called primum mobile, ther insue vppon the same, all other motions of heauens, planetes, elements, and other bodies, in most admirabile order, concorde, and congruetie, for cōseruation and gouernement of the whole. And thus is God proued by th' argument of motion.
                  Th' other two arguments of th' Ende, and 
                     The second argumēt of natural philosophie. 
                     of the Cause Efficiēt of creatures, are made euidēt in a certaine maner by this that hath

bene spoken of Motiō. For seing by experiēce, that euerie thing brought foorth in nature, hath a peculier Ende appointed, whereto it is directed by the selfe same nature, (as we see the byrde is directed to build her nest by nature, the fox to make his denne, and so the lyke in all other creatures:) the philosopher asketh here, what thīg is that, which directeth nature her self, seing eche thīg must haue somewhat to directe it to his Ende? And no answer can be made, but that the Director of Nature, must be some thing aboue Nature, & that is God hymself. This argument of Philo. l. de opificio mundi. the final Ende is most excellentlie handled, by Philo Iudaeus in his learned treatise of the vvorkemanshipe of the vvorlde.
                  
                  From the Cause efficiēt, the Philosopher disputeth thus. It is euident by all reason, The third argumēt of natural Philosophīe. in respect of the corruptions, alterations, and perpetual motiōs of all creatures, that this world had a beginning; and Vide Plutarch de placitis Philosoph. all excellēt philosophers that euer were, haue agreed theruppon, except Aristotle for a tyme, who held a fantasie, that the world had no beginning, but was from all eternitie, albeit at last in his old age, he confessed the contrarie, in his booke to king Arist. l. 8. phys. & l. de Gen. & corrup. Arist. l. de mundo & vide plotin. l. de mundo. Alexander.
                  This then being so, that this world had 3 begīnīg, it must needes follow also, that it had an Efficient cause. Now then is the question, whoe is that Efficient cause that made the world? if you say, that it made it self; it is absurde: for how could it haue

power to make it self, before it self was, and before it had any beeing at all? if you say, that some thing within the world made the worlde: that is, that some one parte of the world, made the whole: this is more absurde, for it is, as if a man should say, that the fingar (and this before it was a fingar, or parte of the bodie,) did make the whole bodie.
                  Wherfore we must confesse by force of this argument, that a greater and more excellent thing, then is the whole world putt together, or then any parte therof, made the world, and was the Cause efficient of the frame that we see; and this cā be nothing els but God that is aboue the world. So that hereby we see, how many wayes the Natural philosopher is fraught with arguments, to proue there is a God, & that by reason onlie, without all light or assistance of faith.
                  
                     BVT THE Metaphisique or Supernatural THE Metaphysique and his argumentes. Philosopher amōg the Gétiles, as he to whome it appertained most in special, to handle thes high & supernatural affaires, had manie more arguments and demonstrations, to proue and cōuince the being of one God.
                  And first of all he said, that it could not The first argumēt in Metaphysique. stande with any possibilitie in his science, that eus finitum, a thing finite, or closed within bosides & limites, (as this world & euerie creature therin is,) could be, but from some Maker or Creator. For (sayeth he,) the thīg that in it self is not infinite,

hath his boundes and limmites, and cōsequētelie ther must be some thing, that assigned thes boūdes and limites. And seing ī this world there is no creature so great, which hath not boundes and limites: we must of necessitic imagine some infinite supreme Creator or Maker, that limited thes creatures, euen as we see, that the potter at his pleasure, gyueth boūdes and limites to the pot that he frameth.
                  This argument the Metaphisique confirmeth by a ruled principle in his science, Ut maxia in Metaphysique. 
                     that euerie thing vvhich is by participation, must be reduced and referred to some other thing, that is not by participation, but of it self. And he calleth a thing by participation, which is Arist. li. 2. Metaph. cap. 2. not in the fullest or highest degree of perfection in his kinde, but may haue additiō made vnto it. As for exaple; water, or anie thing els that is heated by the fiar, is hoate by participatiō, and not of it self, for that it maye alvvayes be hoater, and haue addition of heate made vnto it: But fiar is hoate of it self, and not by participation, for that it hath heate in the highest degree, and in that kinde can receyue no additiō; wherfore the heate of all other things, which are hoate by participation of fiar, are reduced (concerning their heate) to the heate of fiar, as to their original.
                  Now then (sayeth the Metaphisique) we see by experiēce, that all the creatures and partes of this worlde, are things by participation onlie, for that they are finite in nature, and haue limitations in all their

perfections, and may receaue additions to 
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                      the same, and consequentelie, they must of necessitie be referred to some higher cause that is infinite in perfection, and consisteth of it self alone, without participation from others; and this is God, who being absolute, endeles, and without all limitation of perfection in hym selfe deriueth from his owne incomprehensible infinitenes, certaine limited natures and perfectiōs to euerie creature, which perfections in creatures, are nothing els, but litle particles and participations of the bottōles sea of perfectiōs in the Creator, wherunto they are to be referred and reduced, as the beame to the sunne, and the brooke to the fountaine.
                  A second argument vseth the Metaphisique The 2. argument in Metaphysique. Multitude. Plat. in Parmen.
                      grounded vppon certaine rules of vnitie, wherof one principale is, that euerie multitude or distinction of things, proceedeth from some vnitie, as from his fountaine. This he sheweth by manie examples of things in this world. For we see by experiēce, that the diuers motions or mouinges of the lower sphers or bodies celestial, doe proceede of the mouing of one highest Primum Mobile. sphere, & are to be referred to the same, as to their foūtaine. Many riuers are reduced to one well or ofspring: innumerable beames to one sunne: all the boughes a of tree, to one stocke.
                  In the bodie of mā which for his beautie MICRO COSMOS. and varietie is called, the little vvorld, the veynes which are without number, haue

all one beginning in the liuer; the arteres, ī the harte; the sinowes, in the braine. And that which is more, the infinite actions of life, sense, and reason in mā, as generatiōs, corruptions, nourishementes, digestions, The infiite thinges bat prosede from be soule. & alterations: Eeeling, smelling, tasting, seing, hearing, mouing, speaking, thinking, remembring, discoursing, and ten hundred thousand particuler actions, operations, and motions besides, which are excercised in mans bodie vnder thes or other such names and appellations: all thes, (I say,) being infinite in number, most admirable in order, and distincte in euerie their office and operation; doe receaue not withstanding, their beginning from one most simple vnitie, and indiuisible substance, called the soule, which produceth, gouerneth, and directeth them all, to so innu nerable, differēt, and contrarie functions.
                  By this concludeth the Metaphisique, that as among the creatures, we finde this most excellente order and connexion of thinges, wherby one bringeth furth manie, and euerie maltitude is referred to his vnitie: so much more in al reason, must the whole frame of creatures conteined in this world (wherein there are so manie milliōs of multitudes with their vnities,) be referred to one most simple & abstract vnitie, that gaue beginning to them all, and this is God.
                  A thirde argument vseth the Metaphisique, The 3. argument in Metaphysike. Subordination. deriued from the subordination of

creatures ī this world; which subordination is such, and so wonderfull; as we see no creature by nature serueth itself, but an other, and all together doe cōspire in seruing the common.
                  We see the heauens doe moue aboute continuallie without ceasing, and this not to serue them selues, but inferior creatures lesse excellent then them selues. We see that water moystneth the ground, the aver cooleth, openneth, and cherysheth the same, the Sunne heateth and quic keneth it, the Moone and Starres powre foorth their influēce, the windes refreshe it, and all this, not for them selues, but for other. The earth againe, that receaueth thes seruices, vseth not the same for her self, or for her owne commoditie, but to bring foorthe grasse wherewith to feede cattaile, and they feede not for them selues, but to gyue nourishement vnto man.
                  Now then (sayeth the Metaphisique,) A similitude. if a man that stoode a farreof vppon a mountaine, should see in a field vnder hym, a great, huge & maine armie of souldiars, most excellent well appointed; ech one in order agreing with th' other; deuided into Rancks, Squadrōs, Companies, & offices; subordinate th' one to th' other by degrees; and yet all tending one waye, all their faces bent vppon one place, all mouinge, marching, and turning together, all indeuoringe with allacritie towardes the perfourmance of one common seruice, bymutual assistance, without dissention,

discorde, difference, or clamour: he that should see this (sayeth the metaphisique,) as he could not but imagine some general high Capitaine to be among thes soldiars, whom all obeyed, and from whose supreme commandement and order this most excellent subordination, agreement, and vnion proceeded: so much more, vpon consideration of the former coherence, consent, and miraculous subordination of creatures amōg them seiues in their operations, must we inferre, that they haue some general cómaunder cuer thē all, by whose supreme dispcsition, eche creature hath his charge & peculier taske appointed, which he must perfourme, for the cō
                     man and vniuersal seruice of the whole.
                  The fouerth reason or argument alleaged The 4. argument in Metaphysique. Prouidēce. by the supernatural philosopher, is, of the marueilous prouidence, arte and wisdome, discouered in the making of euery least creature within the world. For seing there is nothing so litle, nothing so base or cōtemptible, within the compasse of this heauen that couereth vs, but if you consider it, you fynde, both arte, order, proportion, bewtie, and excellēcie in the same: this can not proceede of fortune as foolishe Lucretīus made diuers bokes against the vvorkemanshipe of the vvorld. Lucretius and some other would haue it; for that fortune is casualtie without order, rule, or certaintie, and therfore needes it must come frō the wisdome, and prouidence of some omnipotēt Creator.
                  If you take a flye, or a flea, or a leafe fró

a tree, or any other the least creature that is extant in the worlde, and consider the same attentiuelie: you shall fynde more miracles, thē partes therin; you shal fynd suche proportion of members, such varietie of colours, such distinctiō of offices, such correspondence of instrumentes; and those so fit, so well framed, so coherent, so subordinate: as the more you contemplate, the more shall ye maruaile, nether is ther anie one thing in the world, more effectual to draw a man to the loue and admiration of his Creator, then to excercise hym self often in this contemplation; for if his harte be not of stone, this will moue his affection.
                  We reade of Galen a profane and verie Galen inforced to cōfesse gods prouidence. irreligious Phisitian, who as hymself confesseth in a certaine place, taking vpō hym to consider of the partes of mans bodie; and fynding much wisdom in the order, vse, and dispositiō of the same, sought Galen. I. 5. de vsu part. first to gyue the praise and glorie therof to nature, or to some other cause, then to God. But I processe of tyme, being oppressed, as it were, with th' ey ceding greate wisdome, cunning, and prouidēce which he discouered in euerie least parcell and particle of mans bodie, wherin nothing was redundāt, nothing defectiue, nothing possible to be added, altered, or better deuised: he brake foorth into thes wordes:  
                        Compono hic profecto cāticum in Creatoris nostri 
                        Lib. 3. de vsu part. 
                        laudem, quòd vltràres suas ornare voluit, melius quia vlla arte possent. Here trulie doe I make

a song in the praise of our Creator, for that of his owne accorde, it hath pleased hym to adorne and bewtifie his thinges better, then by any arte possible it could be immagined
                  
                  Hereby then doth the Metaphisique gather and conclude most euidentlie, that there is a God, a Creator, a most wise and powerfull artificer that made all thinges: Such a one, as exceedeth all boundes of nature, and of humane habilitie. For if all the world should ioyne together, they could not make the least creature which we see in this world. He concludeth also, that the forsight and prouidence of this Creator is infinite, for thinges to come in all eternitie; & finallie, that his wisdome and cogitatiōs are inscrutable. And albeit some tyme, he reueile vnto vs some parte therof; yet often againe we erre therin. For which cause a wise heathē Platonick concludeth thus,  after long search aboute thes affaires. I will praise God (saith he) A vvonderfull speech of a heathen. in those thinges I vnderstand, and I will admire hym in those which I vnderstande not. For I see, that my self oftentymes, doe thinges wher in my seruantes are blinde and cōceaue no reason: As also I haue sene litle children, cast into the syar Iewels of Plotin. li. de proui. greate price, and their fathers writinges of greate learning and wisdome, for that they were not of capacitie to vnderstāde the valure, and worthines of the thing.
                  
                  One argument more will I alleage of 
                        The 5. argument in Metaphysique. Immortalitie of the soule. Plat. l. 10. de repub. the Methaphisique, grounded vpon th' immortalitie

of mans soule; which immortalitie, is proued with one consent of all learned men (as Plato alleageth,) for that it is a spirite and immaterial substance, whose nature dependeth not of the state of our mortal bodie; for so by experience we see daylie, that in olde mē and withered sicklie bodies, the minde and soule is more quicke, cleere, pregnant, and liuelie, then it was in youth, when the bodie was most lustie.
                  The same also is proued by the vnquē
                     cheable desyre which our mynde hath of learning, knowledge, wisdome, & other suche spiritual and immaterial thinges, wheri her thirst by nature is so greate, as, it can not be satisfyed in this lýfe, nether can the obiectes of sense and bodilie pleasures, or any other commoditie or delight of this material world, content or satiate the restles desyre of this im naterial crea VVhen the desyre of our soule shalbe satisfied. ture. Which is an euident argument to the Philosopher, that some other obiect and contentatiō is prepared for her in an other world, and that of such excellencie and supereminent perfectiō, as it shall haue in it all wisdome, all learnig, all knowledg, all bewtie, 'and all other causes of loue, ioye, and contentation, wherin our soule may rest for euer.
                  This being so (saith the Philosopher) that the soule and mynde of mā, is immortall: of necessitie it mast insue, that an immortall Creator sent the same into our bodies, and that to hym againe it must returne

after her departure from this life here. This was the true meaning in deede (The mid. in lib. de anima. how soeuer some later interpreters haue misvnderstood the same,) of that aunciēt doctrine of old philosophers, which Plutarche alleagethe out of Pythagoras and Plato, afirming; that all particuler Plut. de placit. Philoso. soules of men, came sent from one general and common soule of the whole world, as sparcles from the fyar, and beames from the common sunne: and that after their separatiō from their bodies, they shall returne againe, to that general soule, called The meaning of olde philosophers touching Anima mundi. 
                     Anima mundi, the soule of the world, (for that it gyueth lyfe & being to the world) and so to remaine with that general soule eternallie.
                  This was the doctrine of olde philosophers, which seemeth in deede, to haue bene nothing els (though deliueredi other wordes) but that which Salomō hym self affirmeth, in plainer spech, & spiritus redibit ad Deum, qui dedit illum: and our soule or spirit, shall returne to God that gaue it vnto Eccle. 12. vs. And this may suffice for a taste of that which the Metaphysique or Supernatural philosopher can say for proof, that there is a God.
                  
                     THERE REMAINETH yet a third parte of humane wisdome or philosophie, called Moral, whose reasons and arguments THE Moral philosopher. for proofe of this veritie, I haue of purpose referred to the last place, for that they be more plaine and easie thē the former, and more sensible to the capacitie

of euerie simple and vnlearned reader.
                  For first of all, he obserueth in the verie naturall inclination of man (be his The first argumēt of Moral philosophie. manners otherwise neuer so euel,) that there is a certaine propension and disposition to confesse some God or Deitie; as by example he proueth in all nations, were they neuer so fearce or barbarous; yet alwayes cōfessed they some God by nature, though no man did teach or instruct them therin. The same is confirmed, by the common vse of all heathens, in Tertulian handlech this pointe excellēthe in Apolog. lifting vp their eyes and handes to heauen, in anie suddaine distresse that commeth vpon thē. Which importeth, that nature her self hath ingrated this feeling, that there is a God. Yea, further he alleageth, that by experience of all ages, it hath bene proued, that Atheistes them selues, that is, suche men, as in their health and prosperitie, for more libertie of sinful life, would striue against the being of anie God; when they came to die or fall into great miserie, they of all other men, would shew them selues most fearful of this God, as Seneca declareth, and as Suetonius sheweth in th' exā
                     ple Seneca li. 1. de ira. Sueton. in Callig. of Calligula. Whiche is a token, that their conscience inforced them to beleeue a Godhead.
                  Nay, Zeno the Philosopher was wont to saye, that it seemed to hym a more substantial The saying of Zeno touching the deathes of Atheistes. proofe of this veritie, to heare an Atheist at his dying daye, preache God frō a payre of galloes, or other such place of miserie, (when he asketh God and nature

forgyuenes;) thē to heare all the philosophers in the world dispute the poite; for that at this instāte of death & miserie, it is lyke, that suche good fellowes, doe speake in earnest and sobrietie of spirite, who before in their wantonesse, impugned God ether of vanitie, ambition, sensualitie, or dissimulation.
                  Now then, when the Moral Philosopher hath proued by this natural inclination of man, that there is a God, whiche hath imprynted in vs such a feelīg of hym self, as no conscience can deny hym, whē it cometh to speake sincerelie: thē steppeth he a degree further, and proueth, that this god which is acknouledged, cā be but one; The reason vvhy there can be but one God. for that, if he be God, he must be infinite; and if he be infinite; he can haue no compagnion: For that two infinite thinges can not stande together, without impeachement, th' one of th' others infinitie.
                  He proueth the same by the custome of most gentiles, who (as Lactātius well noteth Lact. lib. 2. diuin. instit. cap. 2. in his tyme) whē they swore, or cursed, or prayed, or wished anie thing hartilie, (especiallie in affliction, that lyghteneth th' vnderstanding;) then fashion was to say, God, and not, the Godes. And for the Deus & non dij. learnederforte of them, how so euer they dissembled, and applyed them selues outwardlie to the error of the common people: yet in earnest they neuer spake of more thē of one God, as Plato signifieth of hym self to Dionysius king of Sicilie, in a certaine letter wherin he gaue hym a signe

when he spake in earnest and when in iest.

Wherof Cicero hym self may be an example, who in his bookes de Natura deorū, followeth so farre th' academical veyne of doubtful disputing to & fro about the nature of Godes: as he maye Arnob. cōtra gētes. seeme (and so dyd he to diuers Christians of the primatiue church,) to be verie irresolute whether there were any God or no. Albeit in th' ende he make shew to conclude very plainlie & peremptorilie with the Stoikes.
                  All the fower sectes of Philosophers then, who in their tymes bare the credit All olde Philosophers acknovvledged one God. of learning and wisdome, made profession of one God, when they came to speake as they thought. But if we ascēde vp hygher to the dayes before these sectes beganne, that is, to Vide apud Plutarch de placitis Philos. Trismeg. ī Paemād. & in Asclep. Pythagoras & Archytas Tarē

And finallie, the consent and ful agreemēt, of all learned and wise men, in applying this Godhead not to manie, but to one onlie, that made this world, & gouerneth the same.

                        non diu ipsis, quos non Naturae ratione, sed honoris causa Deos nominamus. We doe not attribute th' appellation of true God, (sayeth Trismegistus) ether vnto men, or vnto diuells, or vnto the multitude of other godes themselues. For that we call the godes, not in respect of their natures, but for honours sake. That is, we call thē godes to honour thē for their famous acts, & not for that we thinke them in nature true godes. Which Cicero confirmeth in thes wordes: the life of man and common custome,

And herehence it. cometh, that Hercules, Castor, Pollux, Aesculapius, and Liber, are novv become godes, & heauen almost is filled vvith mankynde.
                  
                  The second argument of Moral Philosophie, is, devltimo fine, & summo hominis 
                     The. 2. argument of Moral philosophie. 
                     bono, that is, concerning the last ende of man, and of his highest or supreme felicitie, wherby the being of God is also cō
                     firmed.

And albeit I haue said some what of mans ende before; yet that which in this place I am to adde, is more proper and peculier to Moral philosophie. For as other sciences may and doe consider the final endes of other creatures, which are diuers, & yet all concurre for the seruice of man: so this science of Moral philosophie doth properlie consider the final ende of man hym self, calling it, summum bonum, his greatest and highest happines, wherunto he was created, and wherunto he tendeth in this life, and wherin he resteth and reposeth without further Motion or appetit, whē he hath obteined it.
                  For better vnderstanding wherof, it is Euerie thing in this vvorld hath a natural desire to his ende. to be considered, that euerie thing in this world hath some particuler ende, together with an appetite and desire ingraffed by nature to that ende; which desire ceaseth, when the ende is obteined. As for example: a stone hath a natural appetite to goe downwarde to the Centre or middie of the earth, and so it resteth in no place, (except by violence it be stayed,) vntill it come thyther. On the countrary, fyar, reposeth no where (excepte it be restrained) vntill it moūte aboue the ayer to his peculier & natural place of abode, wher, of it selfe it resteth. And so in other thinges that are without sense, their is a certaine natural appetite & desire to their ende, which ende beig once obteined, that desire and appetite of it selfe reposeth.
                  In beastes likewise we behold, that

they haue a desire to fill their bellies, and to satisfie their other senses, which being satisfied, they remaine contented, and desire nothing els, vntill the same appetite of sense wante his obiect againe. Wherby we perceaue, that sensualitie or contentation The felicitie of beastes. of the senses, is the final ende desired of beastes, and their verie summum bonum, or supreme felicitie.
                  But in man, albeit for maintenaunce of the bodie, there be this appetite also to satisfie his senses, according to the lower portion of his mynde, that is called sensatiue; yet according to th' other higher parte of his mynde, whose name is Reasō, or the reasonable parte, (which is the onlie parte in deede, that is peculier to man, and distinguisheth hym from vnreasonable beastes;) he hath an appetite of some more highe and excellent obiect, then is the contentation of thes senses; for that by experience we see and feele, that often times, when the senses be all satisfied, yet is the mynde not quiet, which argueth, that sensualitie, or sensual delectation, is not our summum bonum, wherin our mynde must rest and enioy here felicitie.
                  Here vppon haue Philosophers & wise men fallen to dispute in all ages, what should be the final felicitie, and summum bonum of mankynde? And Cicero sayeth, Cic. li. de finib. bonorum & malorū. that this pointe, is, cardo totius philosophie, the hooke or hyndge wherō all philosophie hangeth; for that this being once

founde out, cleare it is, that all other thinges and actions are to be referred to th obteining of this ende & happines. And therfore aboute this pointe, there hath bene maruelous contentiō and fight The cōtention of Philosophers, about the felicitie of man. among Philosophers; the Stoikes refuting the Epicures, and the Peripateticues resuting againe the Stoikes, and the Platoniques, (who went nearest the truthe) impugning and refuting both th' one & th' other; and this dissentiō went so sarre foorth, th' one parte assigning one thing, and th' other an other, to be this felicitie, or summum bonum; that Marcus Varro a most learned Roman. gathered two hundred fowerskore and eight diferent opinions Aug. l. 19. de ciuit. cap. 1. (as S. Augustine noteth) about this matter.
                  And finallie when all was said and examined, Plato founde, that nothing which might be named or immagined in this life, could be the felicitie or summum bonum, of man, for that it could not satisfie the desire of our mynde. And therfore he pronounced this general sentence. It is 
                     The sentē
                        ce of Plato, in Phadon. 
                     impossible that men should synde their felicitie, or (summum bonum) in this life, seeke vvhat vvay they vvill, but in the next life vvithout all doubt it must be founde. The reason of which sentence and determination was, for that Plato was able to refute any thing, that th' other Philosophers did or could name to be our felicitie & final ende in this life, were it Riches, Honours, Pleasures, moral vertues, or the like, which eche secte

did assigne.
                  As for example; he proued that riches Hovv nothing in this lyfe can be our felicitie. could not be our sammum bonum or happines, for that they are vncertaine, vndurable, vaine, variable, and thinges that bring with them more danger oftē tymes and trouble of mynde, thē doth pouertie. Honours he refelled, for that besides their vanitie, they depende of the mouth and myndes of other men, who are changeable and inconstante. Pleasures of the body and voluptuousnes, for that they are common to vs with beastes, & alwayes haue annexed their sting, and discontentation, when they are paste. Moral vertues, for that they consist in a certaine perpetual fight and warre with our owne passions, which neuer gyue vs rest or repose in this life. Finally, whether so euer we turne our selues, or what soeuer we laye our handes vpon, in this life, to make it our felicitie, or summum bonum; it faileth vs (sayeth Plato,) nether gyueth it any durable contentation to our mynde; wherfore, this felicitie is to be sought and obteined in the life to come.
                  Thus farre arriueth Moral philosophie Hovvfarre Moral philosophie reacheth in determining mans felicitie. by reason, to proue, that mans felicitie or final ende, can not be in any thing of this life or world. It proueth also by the same reason, (as in parte it hath bene touched before,) that this felicitie of our mynde in the life to come, must be a spiritual and immaterial obiecte, for that our mynde and soule is a spirite: it must be immortal,

for that our soule is immortal. But what? goeth yet humane philosophie any further? or can Plato assigne the particuler pointe wherin it standeth? Heare his wordes, and confesse, that not without reason he was called, Diuine. In this it cō
                     sisteth (saith he,) 
                        vt coniungamur Deo qui 
                        Plato in Phaed. 
                        omnis beatutidinis, fastigiū, meta, finis. That we be ioined to God, who is the toppe, the butte, and the ende of all blessednes.  And can any Christian (thinke you) say more then this? yet harcken what a scholler of Platos sayeth, for explication of his masters sentence. Supremus hominis finis, supremum 
                     Plotinus Enu. 1. llb. 4. cap. 1. 
                     bonum, idest Dens. The final ende of mā wherto he tendeth, is a supreme or soueraine good thing, & this is God hym self. By which wordes we see that thes heathens, by the ende of man, could finde out God, which was the second argumēt propounded in Moral philosophie.
                  A thirde argument vseth the Moral The 3. argument in Moral philosophie touching revvard and punishment. Philosopher, for proofe of God, (whiche shalbe the last I will alleage in this place) deduced from consideration of good and euel, vice and vertue; and especially of the rewarde which by nature, reason, & equitie is due to th' one; as also of the punishement belonginge to th' other. For (sayeth he) as in all other thinges, creatures, and actions of this world, that passe from the Creator, we see proportion, order, iustice, wisdome, and prouidence obserued; so, much more must we assure our selues, that the same is obserued in the

same Creators actions and proceedinges towardes man, that is the cheefe & princiral of all his other creatures.
                  Now then we see and be hold, that all other creatures, are directed to their endes by nature, and doe receyue cōforte and contentation as longe as they hold that course: And losse, disease, & gricfe, as soone as they breake or swarue from the same. Onlie man hath reason gyuen hym whereby to know and iudge of his Ende; as also free will and election wherby he maye ether directe his way to the same by vertue, or turne a straye by following of wickednes. When upon it insueth, that in all equitie and instice, there must remaine rewaide for such as doe well, and follow the right pathe assigred the to their ende and felicitie, which is by good lyse: and punist on ente forth' other that abandone the same for pleasure and sensualitic.
                  But we see in this worlde, (saith the Thilosopher,) that moste wicked men doe receyue leaste punishement; and manie there bee (as princes and highe potentates,) whose liues and actions, be they neuer so vitious, yet are they aboue the correction of moitall men: and manie poore men in the contiarie parte, who for their vertue, patience, & honestie, receyue nothige in this lyfe, but enuie, malice, cō
                     tempte, reptoche, despite, and oppression.
                  
                     See of this matter, Socrates, in apologia. Plato. in Cratyl. & in Gorgia. & in phaed. & in I. 10. de legib. Plut. de Sera numinis vindicta. & others. Wherefore, (sayeth he) ether wanteth there prouidence & equitie in the gouerment & dispositió of thes great affaires,

which we see not to want in thinges of lesser moment: or els must there be a place of punishement & rewarde in the lyfe to come, vpō the soules of such as passe from hence, & a iuste and powerful iudge to make recompence of thes inoqualites and iniustices permitted in this world. Which iudge, can be none but the Creator hym self.
                  And so hytherto haue I declared, how euerie particuler science among the Gentiles had particuler meanes and wayes to demonstrate God, by cōtemplation of his creatures, and by force of reason, which no man could denie. Now remaineth it to shewe, how the Iewe or faithful Israelite, before Christs appearance, was able to confirme this veritie to a heathen, which, shalbe the subiect of the sectiō insueinge.
               
               
                  Hovv the Ievves vvere able to proue God. Sect. 3.
                  THe people of Israel that for manie The people of Israel Gods partage. yeares and ages, were the peculier people and partage of God; as they dwelt enuironed with Gentiles of ech side that impugned their religion and worshippe of one God, an I had manie weakelinges. amōg them selues that were oftē tempted to doubt of the same religiō, by th' exáple of so manie nations and countries aboute them, that made profession of a contrarie religion: so had the diuines and learned mē of this people, diuers forcible proofes and most reasonable argumentes peculier

to themselues, (besides the gifte of faith or anie other demonstratiō that hy therto hath bene alleaged,) to cōfirme their brethren in the belief of one God, and to cō
                     uīce all atheistes or infidels in the world.
                  And albeit thes proofes which they vsed were manie, as the Creation of the world Diuers thinges vvherby the Ievves shevve God. by one God; the deriuing of th' hebrue religiō frō the beginning; the cōuersation of God withe Abraham, of whome the Iewes descended; the miraculous deliuering of that nation from Egipt; the law receaued from gods owne mouth by Moyses; the straunge enterance of Iewes into the lāde of promisse; th' extinguishig of the Gentiles which before inhabited there; th' erectiō of the Iuishe Monarchie, and protection therof against all other natiōs; the miraculous deedes & sayinges of Prophetes, and a thousand thinges and reasons besides, which confirme most euidētelie, that the Iewes God was the onlie true God: yet for that all thes thinges & sayinges with an infidel, had no more credite then the writinges or scriptures wherin they were recorded; hereby it came to passe, that all which a Iew could say for profe of God, more then a Gētile, depended onlie vpon th' authoritie of his scriptures; And for this cause, he referred all his proofes and argumentes to make euident the truthe and certaintie of thes scriptures, which thing once performed, the being of one God can not be called in controuersie; for that thes scriptures are

nothing els but a narration of th' actes & gestes of that onlie one God, which the Iewes professe.
                  We are now to see then, what the Iewe was able to saye for proofe of his scriptures, and consequentelie, for demō
                     stration of God, and of his iudgementes Cōsortablà to heare the certaintie of scriptures declared. declared theri. Which discourse, as it was profitable in old tyme, for staye and cōfirmation of all such, as were or might be tempted with infidelitie: So can it not be but verie comfortable to vs Christians of thes dayes, to behold the certaitie of thes scriptures layed before vs, vpon which the foundation of our whole faith dependeth.
                  
                     FIRST THERFORE, the Iewe for THE. 1. proofe of scripturs, Antiquity. proofe of his scriptures, alleagethe the greate and wonderful antiquitie therof. For as God (saith he) was before idoles, & truth before falshod; so was the scripture, which is the storie of the true God, longe before the wrytinges of Panymes or infidels. Iosephus I. 10. cont. Appionē, hādleth this at large. Nay, further he sheweth, that the most parte of thinges recompted in the Bible, were donne before most of the Panime Godes were exstante, and that the verie last writers of the Hebrue Canon, which are Esdras, Aggaeus, Zacharias & Malachie (Eusebiua assigneth them. 570. in Chron. almost six hundred yeares before the cōming: of Christ, when the secōd Monarchie of Persiās begā,) were before the most of heathen aunciēt historiographers, to wit, before Hellanic', Herodot', Pherecides, Thucy dides, and Xenophon.
                  
                     
And albeit the Gétils had some Poetes before, as Orpheus, Homer, & Hesiod; & Lycurgus the Lawmaker that liued a good while after: yet th' eldest of thes, arriued no higher then the dayes of king Salomó, whiche was fyue hundred yeares after Moyses, the first wryter of the Bible. After whose tyme, the most parte of heathen godes were longe vnborne, as Ceres, Vulcan, Mercurie, Apollo, A Elculapiu, Castor, Pollux, and Hercules, as the Gentiles themselues in their Genealogies doe Euphemerus Messen. in Genealo. Deorum. confesse. And as for Abraham that liued fyue hundred yeares before Moyses, he was not onlie elder thē thes lesser Gods, which I haue named; but also the Iupiter, Neptune, Plato, and such other, who for dignities sake and antiquitie, are called by the Gētiles, Dij maiorum gentium, the Godes of greater Nations. And yet before Abraham, Cic. de natura Deorum. doe the scriptures conteine the storie of two thowsand years or there about.
                  So that by this it is euident, that the wrytinges of heathés & the multitude of their godes, are but late fables īrespect of th' old & venerable antiquitie of Hebrue scriptures, & consequételie, th' authoritie of thes scriptures, must in reason be greater then of all other writinges in the world besides, seing they were exstant before all others, in those first tymes of simplicitie and sinceritie, & were in parte translated into diuers liguages before the Monarchie of the Persians, that is, before Euse. li. 9. de praep. any storie of the Gentiles were writen, as

Eusebius out of manie heathen authours Euāg. 23. declareth.
                  
                     NEXT TO the reason of antiquitie, is alleaged the manner of wryting, authorising, 
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                      & cóseruing thes scriptures, which is such, as greatelie cōfirmeth the certaintie of thinges conteyned therin. For first, what soeuer is sett downe in these wrytinges, was ether taken immediatelie frō the mouth of God, as were the propheties and bookes of the law; or els collected from tyme to tyme by general consent, according as matters & miracles sell out, as were the booke of iudges, the bookes of Kinges, and Chronicles, and some other that conteine recordes and histories of tymes. Which bookes were not gathered by some one priuate man, vpon hearsaye or by his owne imagination, longe after thinges donne, as heathen histories and other prophane recordes & monumtes are; but, they were writen by general agreement, in the self same dayes, when thinges were in sight and knowledge of all men, and so could not be seigned.
                  Secondlie, when bookes were writen, Hovv Scriptures 
                           〈◊〉

                      they were not admitted into the canon or authoritie of scriptures, that is, of gods worde or diuine writinges, but vpon great deliberation, and most euidēt proof of their vndoubted veritie. For, ether the whole cōgregatió or Synagoge, who had th' approuing here of, (and among whom commonlie were diuers prophetes,) did know most certainlie the thinges and miracles

to be true (as did also the whole people) that were recorded in thes writinges, conteining histories: or els they saw the same confirmed frō God, by signes and wonders, as in the bookes of their prophetes, & of their-law gyuer Moises, it fell out.
                  Thirdlie, when anie thing was writen and admitted for scripture, the care of cō
                     seruation therof was such, and the reuerence The care of cōseruatiō. of Iewes therunto so great; as may easilie assure vs, that no corruption or alteration could happen vnto it. For first the thig was copied out into twelue Autentical Copies for all the twelue tribes; and then againe in euerie tribe ther were so manie Copies made, as were particuler synagoges within that tribe. All was donne by special Notaries, Scribes, ouerseers and witnesses. The Copies after diligent renewe taken, were layde vp by the whole Cōgregatiō in the treasure-howse of the temple vnder diuers lockes and keyes, not to be touched, but by men appointed, nor to be vsed but with singuler reuerence. To adde, diminish, corrupt or alter, was present death by the lawes of the Nation. And how then was it possible (sayeth the Iewe,) that among thes writinges, ether falshode should creepe in, or truth once receaued, could afterwardes be corrupted?
                  It is not possible (sayeth he) in reason: and therfore obserueth he an other thing in this case, which ī truth is of verie great

consideration; to witt, that no other Nation vnder heauē did euer so much esteeme Th' estimation that Ievves had of their scriptures. their owne writīges, that they would offer to die for the same, as the Iewes were redieto doe for euerie sentēce and syllable of their scriptures. Wherof also it did proceede, that in all their miseries and afflictions, (wherin they were a spectacle to all the world;) in all their flightes and banishementes, to Egipt, Babylon, Persia, Media, and other corners of the earth; in all their spoiles, assaults, and deuastations at home; they yet euer had special care to conserue these writinges, more then their owne lyues, and so haue kepte the same without may me or corruptiō, more ages together, then all Nations in the world haue donne any other monumentes.
                  
                     THE THIRD persuasion which is vsed by the Iewe for the veritie of his THE 3. proofe of scripturs. The sinceritie of the vvriters. scriptures, is, the consideration of the particuler men that wrote them; who were such, as in reason can not be suspected of decept or falshod. For as I haue said, the Stories of the Byble, were writen from tyme to tyme by publique authoritie, and by the testimony of all men that saw and knew the thinges that are rehersed. The bookes of propheties, were endited by the prophetes them selues, who were plaine, simple, and sincere mē, authorized from God by continual miracles, and yet so scrupulous and timerous of their owne speeches, as they durst say nothing, but only, our Lord saith this; the God of Hostes commaundeth

that. &c.
                  
                  And when they had preached and reade their writinges in the hearinge of all the people; they protested, that it was not mans worde, but gods, and that for such they left it in the publique treasurie of their Nation, vntill by tracte of tyme, th' euent and fulfilling of their propheties should proue thē true (as alwayes it did,) The lyues & deathes of the prophetes. and their owne both liues and deathes declare, that they meant no falshode; their liues being such, as were not subiect to the corruption, pride, vanitie, or ambitiō of this life, (as other prophane and heathen writers were,) and their deathes for the most parte, offered vp in holie martirdome, for defence of that truthe whiche they had preached & writen: as appeareth See Epiphan de vitis prophetarum. in Esay, that was sawed in peeces by kīg Manasles: in Ieremie, that was stoned to death by the common people: in Ezechiel, that was slayne by the capitaine of the Iewes at Babylō: in Amos, whose braines were beaten oute by Amasias the wicked & idolitrous priaest in Bethel: in Micheas, whose necke was broken by prince Ioam sonne to kinge Achab: in Zacharie, that was slaine at th' Aulter, and the lyke.
                  And this for the Prophetes of later tymes A peculier cōsideration of Moises, first vvriter in the Bible. amōg the Iewes. But now if we cōsider the first Prophete of all that wrote among that people, I meane Moyses, that was not only a Prophet, but also an Historiographer, a Law giuer, a Captaine, and a Prieste: the first that euer reduced that

people to a common wealth, and the first that putt their actes & gestes in writing, or rather th' actes and gestes of almightie God towardes them: this man (I say) if we cōsider hym onlie, (I meane the circūstances of his person:) the Iewe thiketh this a sufficiēt motiue, to make anie mā of reason beleeue what so euer he hath lefte writen in the Bible, without further confirmatiō.
                  And first for his antiquitie, I haue spokē before, and the heathēs doe confesse it: & Euseb. l. 9 & 10. de praep. Euang. Ioseph. l. 1. cont. Appio. & L. 2. anti. for miracles donne by hym, the greatest ennemies that euer he had in the world, that is, Appiō in his fowerth booke agaīst Iewes, and Porphirie in his fowerthe booke agaīst Christiās, dee acknowledge them; and Porphirie adioyneth more for proofe therof, that he fownde the same cōfirmed by the storie of one Saconiathō a Gentile, who liued (as he saith) at the same tyme with Moyses. But what? all those miracles (say they) were donne by artemagicke & not by the power of God, as Moyses boasted.
                  But thē asketh thē the Iew, wher Moises a shepheard, could learne so much magick? or why could not the Magitians of Pharao, whose studie was in that profession from their infancie, ether doe the lyke, or Exod. 3. 4. 8. at least wise delyuer them selues from the plagues of Egipt? whie did they crie oute, The miraculous. vvorkes of Moyses. Exod. 14. 
                     the fingar of God is here? where did you euer heare such workes donne by magicke as Moyses did, when he deuided the redde sea? when he called into his cāpe so many

Quayles vpon the suddayne, as sufficed to Exod. 16. feede six hundred thousand men, besides women and children? When he made a Num. 11. rocke to yeld foorth a fountaine? whē he caused a dewe to fall frō heauē that nourrished Iosue 5. Psal. 77. his whole campe for fortie yeares together? when he caused the grounde to open and swalloe downe alyue, three of Num. 16. the richest noble men of all his armie, together with their tabernacles, and all other bagges and baggage? When he caused Ioseph. li. 4. antiq. cap. 2. & 3 a siar to come from heauen, and cōsume siftie gentlemen of the former Rebelles adherētes, without hurting any one that stoode about them?
                  Thes thinges did Moyses and manie other, in the sight of all his armie, that is, in the sight of so manie hundred thousand people, amōg which, there were diuers his emulators and sworne enimies, as by the storie & icripture it self appeareth. Core, Num. 16. Deut. 11. Psal. 225. Dathan, and Abiron with their faction, soughte in all thinges to disgrace hym, & to deminishe his credite; and therfore if any one pointe of thes miracles had bene reprouable; Moyses would neuer haue durst to putt the same in writinge, nor would the people haue stode with hym, & much lesse haue receaued his writinges for diuine, and for gods owne wordes, (beinge sollicited agaynst hym by so potent meanes;) had not they knowen all thinges to be most true therin conteined, and had seene his straunge miracles, and familiaritie with God.
                  
                     
But he dealt plainelie and simplie in this behalfe; he wrote the thinges of The plaine and sincere proceeding of Moyses. his owne doinges, which euerie man present, did know to be true; and of Gods speeches and communicatiōs to hym self, he wrote so much as he was commaunded, wherof both God, and his consciēce did beare hym witnesse. He caused the whole to be reade vnto the people, and layed vp in their Sacred Arcke and Tabernacle, as gods owne writing, and couenaunt with that nation. He caused all the whole armie to sweare and vowe th' obseruāce therof. And thē drawing towards Nu. 20. & 27. Deut. 31. his death, he made a most excellēt exhortation vnto them, persuading them sincerlie to the seruice of their God; and cō
                     fessing his owne infirmities, and how for his oftences he was to die, before their enterance to the lande of promisse. He cō
                     cealed Exod. 32. Gen. 49. Nu. 12. Deut. 14. notth' offēces of his brother Aarō, of his Grand-father Leui, of his sister Marie, and other of his kinred, (as worldlie princes for their honours are wonte to doe;) nether did he goe aboute to bring in gouernment after his disceasse, any one of his owne sonnes, (which is greatelie to be obserued;) notwithstandinge he lefte Num. 27. Deut. 3. behynde hym goodlie gentlemen fitt for that roome, & hym self of power to place them, if he had endeuored: But he lefte the gouernment to a straūger, named Iosue, as God had commaunded hym.
                  All which thinges (sayeth the Iewe) doe proue suffiçientelie that Moises was

no man of ambition or of worldlie spirit, but a true Scruaunt of God, and consequētlie, that he wrought not by magicke or falshod, but by the onlie power of his Lorde and Master, and that his writinges are true, and of the same authoritie, that in his lyfe and death he affirmed them to be, that is, th' vndoubted worde of almightie God.
                  
                     THIS HE confirmeth yet further by a fowerth reason, which is, the consent THE. 4. proofe of scripturs. Consent. and approbatiō of all later writers of the Bible, that insued after Moyses. For as among prophane writers of worldlie spirite, it is a common fashion for hym that followeth, to reprehende the former, and to hunte after praise by his ancetours disgrace: so in thes writers of the Bible, it is a most certaine argument that all were guyded by one spirite from God, that in continuance of so manie ages & thousand yeares, no one yet euer impugned th' other, but alwayes the later supposing and approuing the former for true, doth build therupon, as vpon a sure fondatiō. So the writinges of Iosue, doe confirme and approue the writinges of Moises; and the recordes of the Iudges, doe reuerence and allowe the booke of Iosue. The Storie of kiges & chronicles, doth referre it self to the storie of iudges. One Prophete cōfirmeth & other. And finallie, Christ approueth thē all, by the knowē diuisiō of law, psalmes, ad Prophetes, which is a demonstratiō that all their spirites agreed i one.
                  
                     
And thus hytherto haue bene declared 4. Considerations external. thes fower considerations, that are external or without the Bible: to witte, th' antiquitie and continuāce of the scriptures; the maner of their writing and preseruing  from corruption; The sinceritie,  vertue, and simplicitie of their writers;  together with their agreement and coherēce  in one spirit. But now further (sayeth the learned Iew) if you will but open the booke it self, and looke into the texte, & Considerations internal. that which therin is conteined: you shall see gods owne hande, gods owne characters, gods owne signe, and seale, and subscription to the paper. You shall see Gods omnipotencie, Gods spirite, Gods prouidence, no lesse in thes letters of his booke, then you beheld the same before, in the tables of his creatures. Nay, much more (sayeth he,) for that thes letters were deuised for declaration of thos tables, to th' ende, that such as for their blyndnes, could not see hym in his creatures; might learne at least to reade hym in his scriptures.
                  
                     CONSIDER thē first (sayeth he,) the subiecte or argumēt which the scriptures THE. 5. proof of scripture. Their argumēt and Ende. doe handle, together with the scope and ende, wherto they doe leuell. You shall finde, that the first is nothing els but th' actes and gestes of one eternal God, as before hath bene mentioned; and the secōd nothing els, but the onlie glorie & exaltation of the same great God, together with the saluatiō of mankynde vpō earth.

And shall you finde anie writinges in the world besides, that haue so worthie an argument, or so highe an Ende? Reade all the volumes and Monumentes of the Pagans; turne ouer all their authors of what kynde, or name, or profession soeuer, and see what mention they make of thes two thinges, I meane, of the honour of God, & of the saluation of man? Reade their Philosophers, & see, whether euer they name or pretende thes thinges. Reade their Historiographers, Philosophers. and marke how manie battails and victories they attribute vnto God? They will describe to you oftē the particuler cōmēdatiō of euerie Captaine; Historiographers. they will defraude no one souldiar of his praise in the victorie; they will attribute much to the wisdome of the general; much to his courage; much to his watchfulnes; much to fortune. They will attribute to the place, to the wynde, to the wether, to the shining of the sunne, to the raising of the dust in th' enimies eyes, to the flying of some litle birde in the ayer, and to a thowsand such petie obseruatiōs besides; but to God nothing. Where as cō
                     trarie wise in the scriptures, it is in euerie battail recorded. God deliuered them into their enimies handes: God ouertbrevv them:. God gaue the victorie.
                  
                  Againe, consider the lawes and law makers among the Gentiles, as Lycurgus, Heathen Lavvmakers. Solon, Draco, Numa, and the like, and see whether you may finde any one such law, or tending to such an ende, as this is of

the Iewes: thou shalt loue thie God vvith all 
                     Deut. 6. 
                     thie hart, and vvith al thie soule; and shalt loue thy neighbour as thie self. Consider in all the Prophetes and Southsayers. Southesayers and Diuiners amōg the Gentiles, whether they vsed to say ī their predictions, as the prophetes of Israel did, Dominus dixit, our Lord hath spoken it; or els, Ego dico, I doe speake it. Compare their Versifiers and Poetes. Versifiers and Poetes, with those of the scripture, and see, whether they haue laboured in the praise of men, or of God. And where as heathen Poetes, haue filled vp their bookes (as also the most parte of ours at this day,) with matter of carnal loue: marke whether anie of thē euer brake forth into such pangues of spiritual chaste loue, as Holie Dauid did, whē he said: I will loue the, my God, my strēgth, my firmament, my refuge, my deliuerer, Psal. 17. my helper, my protector, and the horne The vehement loue of Dauid. Psal. 72.
                      of my saluation. And againe in an other verse. What haue I desired vpon earth besides thee? my flesh and harte haue fainted for thee, thou God of my hart, thou God that arte my parte and portion euerlasting?
                  By all which is euident, that as prophane Prophane vvritinges treate onlie of men. writinges and writers, which doe treate of men, extoll men, seeke the grace of men, referre all to the commoditie and good liking of men, doe proceede of the spirite of mā, & are subiecte to those infirmities of falshode, errour, & vanity, wherwith man is intangeled in this life: so the scriptures, which handle matters aboue

the compasse of flesh and blood; that referre all to God, and supernatural endes; could not proceede of nature or of humane spirit. For that by nature, the Iewes were men as the Gentiles were, and had their infirmities of flesh & blood, as th' other had. And therfore it must needes be concluded, that thes high and supernatural writinges amonge them, proceeded from God that specially directed them, & gaue them lighte of vnderstanding, aboue all other nations & people in the world.
                  
                     NEXT AFTER the argument and Ende of the scriptures, the Iew willeth vs to consider the peculier stile and phrase THE. 6. proof of scripturs. Their stile. which they vse; for that (sayeth he) it being different from all other maner of writing in the world, and vnimitable to man: it doth discouer the fingar of God, by which it was framed. See 3. Augustine of this at large, lib. 12 de ciu. Dei. For where as humane writers doc labour much in adorninge their stile, and in reducing their wordes to number, weight, measure, and sounde, with addition of manie figures, and other ornamentes, for allurement of the reader: the scripture taketh quite an other course, and vseth a most maruelous simplicitie, therby to accommodate it self Simplicity. to the capacitie of the weakest; but yet, alwayes carying with it so greate profunditie, as the best learned, in searche therof, shall confesse their owne ignorance. Profundity. For examples sake; consider but the verie first wordes of the Bible; In the beginning, God created heauen and earth; and the
                     
                     earth vvas emptie and voide, and darkenes vvas 
                     Gen. 1. 
                     vpon the face of the depth; and the spirit of God vvas caried vpon the vvaters; and God said, lett light be made, and light vvas made, &c. What can be more plaine and simple then this narration, to instruct the most vnlearned aboute the beginning and creation of the world? and yet, when learned men come to examine euerie pointe therof, how & what, and where, and in what manner, & when, thinges were donne; it astonisheth them all, to cōsider the difficulties which they finde, and the depthe of so infinite inscrutable mysteries.
                  Besides this, there goeth in the same simplicitie, a straunge Maiestie and grauitie The grauitie and Maiestie of speech ī the scriptures. of speech, declaring sufficientlie from how greate and potent a prince it proceedeth. For as great Monarches in their edictes and proclamations, are wonte to speake vnto their subiectes, not in figures and rhetorical phrases, but plainlie, breeflie, and peremptorilie, to shew their authoritie: so the scriptures, to declare whose edictes they be, doe vse the like maner of phrase and stile to all the world, without alluring or flattering anie man, and without respect of Monarche, Emperour, prince, or potentate. Fac hoc & viues, doe this and thou shalt liue: Si peccaueris in 
                     Deut. 4. 16. 22. 
                     me, morieris in aeternum, if thou sinne against me, thou shalt die euerlastingly.
                  And albeit (as I haue said) the scripturs doe vse this simplicitie of speech, and doe not admitte that kynde of painted and artificial

stile, which humane writers dos so much couet: yet in persuading, instructing, The force of the scriptures in mouing affections. mouing of affections, and all other effectes whiche speech or writinge can worke; there is no comparason, (a thing most wōderful,) betwene anie other writinges in the world, and thes. Wherof I. could alleage manie proofes and examples, but that it were to longe. Let anie: man reade attentiuelie, but the first chapter of the prophetie of Esay, and cōpare it with anie one parte or parcel of Tullies or of Demostines oratiōs, & see whether the difference of wordes, be as great as the difference of motions? Let diuers hymnes and holie psalmes of the scriptures, be cō
                     ferred with the most pathetical poemes that mans wit hath inuēted, and see, whether there be anie comparason in styrring and fiaring of affections, or no?
                  This am I sure, that Iosephus the Iew, Faluins. Iosephus de Antiq. Iudaic. See S. Hiero n. lib. de script. Eccl. who for glorie of his eloquence, had his image of mettal, erected by Titus the Emperour ī the market place of Rome, wrote the same storie, which the scriptures conteine, and bestowed much labour and humane cūning therin. But yet euen in thos places, when he endeuoured most to shew his arte, as in the sacrifice of Isaac by his Gen. 22. father, and in the meeting of Iephte with his onely daughter, which by vow he Iudic. 11. was cōstrained to put to death; the scriptures are able to pearse the hart, & wring owt teares of the reader, whom Iosephus will not greatelie moue with his rhetorical

narration, though otherwise verie learned and artificiallie penned.
                  Aristaeus that learned Gētile, of whom Tvvo miracles reported by Aristaeus. we haue made mention before, who was in special fauour with Ptolomie the second greate Monarche of Egipt, (aboute 300 yeares before Christes natiuitie,) and a chief doer in procuring the translation of the Hebrue. Bible into the greeke language, reported of his owne knowledge Aristaeus libello de translat Bibliorum & apud Euse. 1. 8. de praepeuāg. ca... to that king two straunge accidentes which had happened in his time, & which he had vnderstoode of the parties themselues, to whom they had happened. The first was, of Theopompus an eloquent Historiographer, who hauing Theopōpus. translated certaine thinges out of the Bible, and endeuouring to adorne the same with vaine colours of eloquence; could not perfourme his desire, but was strokē with a suddain maze and gyddines in the head, and was warned in his sleepe, not to proceede further in that worke after that sorte, for that such manner of style, was to base for so high matters, as the scriptures conteined.
                  The other example was of one Theodectes, a writer of tragaedies, who tolde Theodectes. Aristaeus, that once he attēpted to bring certaine matters out of the Iewes Bible; into a pagan tragedie, and that theruppō he was presentlie strikē blīd; wherwith, he being asto nished, and falling to repentance for that he had donne, and decisting from the enterprise, (as also Theopompus

did:) they were both of them restored againe to their healthes. And thus much did thes three Paganes confesse, of the authoritie, diuinitie, and peculier sacred stile of our scriptures.
                  
                     BVT NOVV further it insueth in order, that after the subiect and phrase, we THE. 7. proofe of scripturs. The Contentes. should consider a litle the contentes of thes scriptures, whiche will perhappes, more clearlie direct vs to the vewe of their authour, then any thing els that hytherto hath bene said. And for our present purpose, I will note onlie two special thinges conteined in the Bible. The first Highe doctrines. st albe certaine high & hiddē doctrines, which are aboue the reach and capacitie of humane reason, and consequētlie, could neuer fall into mans braine to inuent thē. As for example; that all this wonderful frame of the world, was created of nothing, where as philosophie saith, that of Nothing, nothing can be made: that Angels, being created spirites, were damned eternallie for their sinnes: that Adam, by disobedience in Paradise, drew all his posteritie into th' obligation of that his synne; and that, the womas seed should deliuer vs from the same: That God is one in substance, and three in persons: that the secōd of thes persons, beig God, should become man and die vpon a Crosse for mankinde: that after hym, the way to all felicitie & honour, should be by contempt, suffering, and dishonour. Thes doctrines (I say) and many more, conteined in the Bible, being

thinges aboue mans capacitie to deuise, and nothing agreinge with humane reason: most euidentlie doe declare, that God was th' authour & enditer of the scripturs, for that by hym onlie, and from no other, thes highe and secret mysteries, could be reueiled.
                  The second thing conteined in scriptures, The propleties in scripture declare their authour. Esa. 41. 23. that could not proceede but from God alone, are certaine propheties or fortellinges of thinges to come. Wherin God hymself prouoketh th' Idoles of the Gentiles, to make experience of their power, in thes wordes: Declare vnto vs vvhat shall insue hereafter, & thereby vve shall knovv that you are Godes in deed. Which is to be vnderstoode; if they could fortell particulerlie & plainlie, what was to come, in thinges meerlie contingent or depending of mans will: they should therby declare their power to be diuine.
                  For albeit thes Idoles of Gentiles, as Hovv the deuils, and other creatures, may fortell thīgs to come. Apollo and other that gaue foorth Oracles, (which were nothing els in deed, but certaine wicked spirites that tooke vpon them these names,) did some times happen vpon the truth, and fortel thinges to come; as also some Astrologers, Southsayers, and Magitians doe, ether by forsight in the starres & other elementes, or by th' assistance of thes wicked spirites and deuils: yet are the thinges which they pronosticate, ether natural and not contingent; & so may be forseene & fortolde in their causes; (as raine, heate, colde,

wīdes, & the like:) or els, if they be meere accidental; thes predictions of theirs are only coniectures, and so, most incertaine and subiecte to errours.
                  This testifieth Porphyrie the greate patron of Paganisme, in a special booke of Th' opinion of a healthē touching the propheties of his Godes. th' answers of his Godes, wherin he sweareth that he hath gathered trulie without addition or detraction, the Oracles that were most famous before his tyme, with the false and vncertaine euent therof; In consideration of which euent, he setteth downe his iudgment of their power in predictions, after this manner. The Godes 
                     Porphy. li. de resp. & oracu. 
                     doe fortell some naturall thinges to come, for that they doe obserue the order and coniunctiō of their natural causes: But of thinges that are contingēt, or doe depend of mans vvill, they haue but coniectures only, in that by their subtilitie and celeritic, they preuent vs. But yet they often tymes doe lye, and deceaue vs in both kyndes: for that, as natural thinges are variable; so mans vvill is much more mutable.
                  
                  Thus farre Porphyrie of the propheties of his Godes, whereunto agreeth an other heathen of greate credit, among the Graecians, named Oenomaus, who for that he had bene much delighted with Oracles, & Oenomaus de falsitate oraculorū & de artificibus maleficiis. more deceaued: wrote a special booke in th' ende, of their falshod and lies; and yet sheweth, that in manie thinges wherin they deceiued, it was not easie to cōuince them of opē falshod, for that they would inuolue their answers (of purpose,) with such obscurities, generalities, equiuo cations,

and doubtefulnes; as alwayes they would leaue them selues a corner wherin to saue their credites, when th' euent should proue false. As for example, when Craesus that famous & riche Monarche of Deceptful. Oracles. Lidia, cōsulted with Apollo, whether he should make warre against the Persiās, & therby obtaine their Empire or no? Apollo, desirous of bloodshed, (as all wicked spirites are;) gaue his oracle in thes wordes, for deceauing of Craesus. If Craesus vvithout feare, shal passe ouer Halys; (this Euseb. li. 
                           〈◊〉
                         de praep. euā. ca. 10. was a riuer that laye betwene hym and Persia,) he shal bringe to confusion a greate riche kingdome: Vpon whiche wordes, Craesus passed ouer his armie, in hope to get Persia, but so one after, he lost Lidia, by euel vnderstanding of this doubteful prophetie.
                  This then is th' imbecilitie of both humane The circū
                        stances of Propheties; set dovvne in the scriptures. & angelical power, ī pronosticatig things to come, which are mere cōtingēt. In which kinde, not withstanding, seing that the scriptures haue manie and almost infinite propheties, fort old manie yeares, (& some tymes ages) before they came to passe; sett downe in plaine, particuler, and resolut speech; at such tymes as there was nether cause to coniecture them, nonprobabilitie that euer they should be true; deliuered by simple and vnlearned persons, that could forsee nothing by skill or arte; and yet that all thes by their euentes haue proued most true, and neuer anie one iote in the same haue fayled: this (I say)

alone, doth conuince most apparentlie, (all proofes and reasons, and other argumentes laid a syde,) that thes scriptures are of God and of his eternal and infallible spirite. And therfore of thes propheties, will I alleage in this place, some few examples.
                  Abraham the first father and special Patriarche of the Iewes, had manie propheties 1. The prophetie to Abraham for his posteritie. Gen. 12. 13. 15. 17. 18. &c. and predictions made vnto hym, as of his issue, when he had yet none, nor euer lyke to haue; of his inheritinge the land of Canaan, and the lyke. But this which followeth, is wōderfull, of his posterities discent into Egipt; of their tyme of seruitude and manner of deliuerauce thēce; (the same being fortolde more thē fower hundreth yeares before it was fulfilled;) & at that tyme whē no likelihode therof ī the world appeared. The wordes are thes. Knovv thou before hande, that thy issue shal be a straunger in a forraine lande, and they 
                     Gen. 15. 
                     shal subiect them to seruitude, and shall asstict them for fovver hundred yeares; but yet I vvill iudge the nation vnto vvhome they haue bene slaues, and ester that, they shal departe thence vvith greate riches. This is the prophetie; and how exactelie it was afterwarde fulfilled, by the ruine of the Egytians, and deliuerance of the Israelites, euen at that Exod. 12. Gal. 3. tyme which is here appointed: not onelie the booke of Exodus doth declare, wher the whole storie is layed downe at large: but also the cōsent of Porphv. li. 4. cōt. Chri. Appiō. l. 4. cōt. Iudaeos. heathen wryters, as before hath bene touched. And it is

speciallie to be noted, that this prophetie was so cōmon and well knowen amōg all Iewes, from Abrahams tyme downe vnto Moyses, and so deliuered by tradition frō fathers to their children: as it was the onelie comfort and staye, not onlie of all that people in their seruitude of Egypt: but also of Moyses and others, that gouerned the people afterwardes, for fortie yeares together in the deserte, & was the onelie meane in deede, wherby to pacifie them in their distresses and miseries; and therfore Moyses in euerie exhortation almost, maketh mention of this promisse and prophetie, as of a thing well knowen vnto them all, and not deuised or inuēted by hym selfe or anie other.
                  Longe after this, Iacob, that was Abrahams 2. The prophetie for the gouernment of Iuda. nepheue, being in Egipt, & making his testament; said of his sowerth sonne Iuda. Iuda, thie brothers shal praise thee, and the childrē of thie father, shal bovve vnto the &c. the Scepter shal not be taken from Iuda, vntil he come, that is to be sent, and he shal be the expectation of nations. Which later parte of the Gen. 49. prophetie, all Hebrewes doe expounde that it was meant of the comming of Messias, which was fulfilled almost two thousand yeares after, at the coming of Christ, as shalbe shewed in an other special chapter. For at that tyme, kinge Herod, 2 straūger, putt owt quite the line of Iuda, Ioseph. de antiq. li. 14. from the gouernment of Iurie. But for the first parte, touching Iudas scepter; it is wonderfull to consider the circumstances

of this prophetie.
                  For first, when it was spokē and vttered by Iacob, there was no probabilitie of anie Scepter at all, to be amōg the Iewes, for that the Israelites or sōnes of Iacob at that daye, were poore and few in nūber, and neuer like to be a distincte nation of themselues, or to depart foorth of Egypt againe. And secondlie, if anie such thinge should come to passe, as they might be a people, and haue a scepter or gouernmēt of their owne: yet was it not lyklie, that Iuda and his posteritie should possesse the same, for that he had three elder brothers, to witt, Ruben, Simeō, and Leuie, who in Vnlikelihodes of this prophetie. all likelihode, were to goe before hym. And thirdlie, when Moyses recorded and putt in wryting this prophetie, (whiche was diuers hundreth yeares after Iacob had spoken it,) it was muche lesse likelie that euer it should be true, for that Moyses, then present in gouernmēt, was of the tribe of Leuie, & Iosue designed by Godfor his successour, was of the tribe of Ephrai, Exod. 2. Iosue. 19. and not of Iuda. Which maketh greatelie for the certaintie of this record. For that it is most apparent, that Moyses would neuer haue putt suche a prophetie in writing, to the disgrace of his owne tribe, and to the preiudice and offence of Rubē, Simeon, Ephraim, and other tribes; nether would they euer haue suffred such a derogation, but that it was euident to them by tradition, that their Grandsire Iacob had spoken it, albeit then presentelie, there

was no greate likelihode, that euer after, it should come to be fulfilled.
                  And this was for the tyme of Moyses: but yet consider further, that from Moyses to Samuel, (that was last of all the Iudges,) there passed fower hūdreth years more, & yet was there no apparēce of fulfillinge 1. Reg. 1. & 8. this prophetie in Israel; for that the tribe of Iuda was not established in gouernmēt. At lengthe they came to haue kinges to rule, & then was there chosen 1. Reg. 9. one Saul to that place, not of the tribe of Iuda, but of Beniamin, & he indued with diuers children to succede hym. And who would then haue thought that this prophetie could euer haue bene fulfilled? but yet for that it was gods worde, it must needes take place; and therfore when no man thought therof, there was a Dauid. poore shepheard chosen owt of the tribe of Iuda, to be kinge, & the regiment & scepter so established in his posteritie; that albeit 1. Reg. 16. manie of his descendentes offended God more greeuouslie, then euer Saul did, who was putt out before: and albeit ten tribes 3. Reg. 12. 2. Para. 11 at once brake from Iuda, and neuer returned to obedience againe, but conspired with the Gentiles and other enimies of The vvonderful prouidence of God tovvards the house of Iuda. euerie syde, to extinguishe the said kingdome and regiment of Iuda: yet for the fulfilling of this prophetie, the gouernmēt of Iuda held owt still, for more then a thowsand and two hundred yeares together, vntill Herodes tyme as I haue said. Which is more, then anie one familie in

the world besides, can shew for his nobilitie Euseb. in Chron. or continuance in gouernment.
                  The same Iacob when he came to blesse his litle nepheues Manasses, and Ephraim, 3. The prophetie for the greatenes of Ephraim aboue Manasses. that were Iosephs children; though hym self were now dimme of sight, and could not well discerne them, yet dyd he putt his right hande vpon the head of the youger, and his left hand vpon the elder, and that of purpose, as it proued afterwarde. For when Ioseph their father misliked the placing of their Grād-fathers hādes, & would haue remoued the right hande fró Gen. 48. Ephraim, and haue placed it vpon the head of Manasses, that was the elder: Iacob would not suffer hym, but answered. I knovv my Jonne, I knovv, that Manasses is the elder; & be shall be multiplied into manie people; but yet his yonger brother shalbe greater then be. Which afterward was fulfilled, for that Ephraim was alwayes the greater and Iosue 16. & 17. strōger tribe, and in fine, became the head of the kyngdome of Israel, or of the ten tribes, wherof there was no suspition or Eccle. 47. Esay. 7. & 28. Icrem. 31. Ezec. 37. Oze. 5. likelihode, when Iacob spake this, or when Moyses recorded it. And how then came Iacob to forsee this, so manie hundred yeares before? as also to forsee and fortell the particuler places of his childrens habitations, in the lande of promisse? as Zabulon at the sea side; Aser in Gen. 49. the fertile pastures; and other the like, Iosue. 14. Exod. 12. Gal. 3. Act. 13. fower hundred yeares, and more. Wherhence had he this (I say) to fortell what

lottes so longe after should appointe, but onelie from God, who gouerned their lottes?
                  The like might be asked concerninge 4. The forsight of Moyses. Nu. n. 34. 35. 36. Iosue. 15. 16. 17. Moyses, who before his death in the desert, deuided out the lande of Canaan, to euerie tribe, euē as though he had bene in possession therof, & as afterwarde, it fell out by casting of lottes, as in the booke of Iosue it doth appeare. And could any humane witt or science (thinke you) forsee, what eche tribe should attaine (after his death) by drawinge of lottes? Againe, the same Moyses forsawe and fortolde in publique hearing of all the people, how in tymes to come, longe after his death, the Iewes should forsake God, and for their Deut. 31. & 32. synnes be cast into manie banishementes, and finallie be forsaken, and the Gentiles receaued in their roome, as in deed it Deut. 32. v. 21. came to passe. And whence (trow you) could he learne this, but from God alone?
                  In the booke of Iosue, there is a curse 5. The prophetie for the perpetūal desolation of Iericho. Ios. 6.
                      layed vpō the place where Iericho stoode, and vpon what soeuer person should goe about to rebuild the same; to wit, that in his eldest sonne, he should lay the foundations, and in his yongest sonne, should he builde the gates therof: which is to saye, that before the foundations were layed, and gates builded, he should be punished with the death of all his children. Which thing was fulfilled almost fiue hundred yeares after, in one Hiel, who presumed vnder wicked kinge Achab to rebuild Iericho againe,

and was terrified from the same, by the suddaine death of Abiram and Segub his children, as the booke of kinges reportech, 3. Reg. 16 
                     according to the vvorde of our Lord, vvhich he had spoken in the hande of Iosue, the fonne of Nun; And since that tyme to this, no man ether Iewe or Gētile, hath taken vpon hym to raise againe the said Citie, albeit the situation be most pleasant, as by relation of Stories and Geographers appeareth.
                  In the third booke of kinges, it is recorded, 6. The prophetie for the birth and actes of Iosues. 3. Reg. 12
                      that when Ieroboam had withdrawen ten tribes from th' obedience of Roboam, kinge of Iuda; to th' ende they might neuer haue occasion to revnite thē selues againe to Iuda, by their goinge to sacrifice in Ierusalem, (as by the law they were appointed:) he builded for them a goodlie gorgeous highe Aulter in Bethel, and there cōmanded them to doe their deuotions. And when he was one day thero present hymself, and offering his incense vpon the said Aulter, and all the people lookinge on; there came a man of God (sayeth the scripture) and stoode before the Aulter, and cried out aloude, and spake thes wordes: O Aulter, Aulter, this 
                     3. Reg. 13 
                     sayeth our Lorde; behold, a childe shalbe borne of the hovvse of Dauid, vvhose name shalbe, Iosias, and he shal sacrifice vpon thee, thes idolatrous priestes that novv burne francomsense vpon the, and he shal burne the bones of men vpon thee.
                  
                  Thus spake that man of God, in the presence and hearinge of all the people

more then three hundred yeares before Iosias was borne; and it was registred prosentelie, (according to the manner of that tyme, which I haue noted before,) and with the same, were registred also the miracles which happened about that fact; as that, the Aulter clefte in two vpō the mans wordes; and Ieroboam extendinge owt his hande to apprehend hym, lost presentelie the vse and feeling therof, vntill it was restored againe by the said holie mans prayers; who notwithstanding, Disobediē
                        ce punished greenouslie in Gods dearest. for that he disobeyed Gods commandement in his returne, and dyd eate with a prophet of Samar a, (which was forbidden hym:) he was slaine in his way homeward by a Lion, and his bodie was brought backe againe & buried in Bethel, nigh the said Aulter, amongest the sepulchers of those idolatrous preestes of that place; but yet with a superscription, vpon his tombe, conteining his name, and what had happened.
                  There passed three hundred yeares, 4. Reg. 23 and Iosias was borne, and came to reigne in Iuda; And one daye cōming to Bethel to ouerthrow the Aulter, and to destroye the sepulchers of those idolitrous priestes that had bene buried i that place; whē he began to breake their tombes; he fownde by chance; the sepulcher of the said man of God, with the superscription vpon it. By which superscription, and by relation of the citizēs of Bethel, when he perceaued that it was the sepalcher of hym that

had fortolde his byrth, his name, and his doinges, so manie hundred years before he was borne: he lett the same stande vntouched, as the fowerth booke of kinges doth declare. Cap. 23.
                  
                  Now consider, whether among anie people in the world, but onlie amonge the Iewes, ther were euer anie such prophetie, so certaine, so particuler, so longe fortolde before the tyme, and so exactelie fulfilled? But yet the holie scriptures are full of the lyke, and tyme permitteth me onlie to touch some few of the principal.
                  Esay the prophet, is wonderful in fortelling the mysteries and actes of the Messias; his natiuitie, his life, and all the particulers that happened in his passiō. In so much, that S. Ierome sayeth, he may seeme rather to write a storie of deedes past, Micron. in Prolog. Galeat. then a prophetie of euentes to come. But yet among other thinges, it is to be noted, 7. The prophetie for the destruction of Hierusalem & Babylon. that he liuing in a peaceable and prosperous tyme in Iuda, when the Iewes were in amitie and greate securitie with the Babyloniās; he forsawe and fortolde the destruction of Ierusalem by the said Babylonians, and the greeuous captiuitie of Iewes vnder them, as also the destruction of Babylon againe by Cyrus kinge 4. Reg. 20 v. 16. Esay. 5. of Persia, whose expresse name and greatnes, he published in writing, almost two hundred yeares before he was borne; saying in the person of God; First, to Ezechias king of Iuda, that reioysed in the frindshippe he had with Babylon: behold 
                     4. Reg. 20
                     
                     the dayes shall come, vvhen all that thou and thye fathers haue layed up, shall be caried avvay to Babylon, and thy children shalbe eunuches in the king of Babylons Palace. And next, to Babylō he said; the destruction of Babylon, vvhich Esay 
                     Esay. 13. 
                     the sonne of Amos savve &c. houle & crie, for that the day of our Lorde is at hande: &c. And thirdlie, to Cyrus, (not yet borne,) who was preordained to destroye the same, and to restore the people from banishemēt, & to rebuild the temple in Ierusalē, he sayeth thus: I say to Cyrus; thou art my shepheard, and 
                     Esay. 24. 
                     thou shalt fulfill all my vvill. I say to Ierusalem; 
                     8. The vvonderful prophetie for Cyrus king of Persians. Esay. 25. 
                     thou shalt be builded againe. I say to the temple; thou shalt be founded again. This sayeth our Lord, to my amointed Cyrus; I vvill goe before thee, & vvill humble the glorious people of the earthe, in thy presence; I vvill breake their brasen gates, & crushe in peeces their yron barres; for my seruant Iacobs sake haue I called thee by thie Name, and haue armed the, vvher as thou 
                     This he sayeth, for that Cyrus vvas an infidel. 
                     knovvest not me.
                  
                  Can anie thing be more clearlie or miraculouslie spoken in the world, then to name a heathé not yet borne, that should conquerre so stronge a Monarchie as Babylon was, at this tyme, & should builde againe the temple of Ierusalem, which others of his owne religiō had destroyed before hym? what cause, what reason, what lykeliehode, could be of this? yet Esay speaketh it so confidentelie, as he Esay. 13. sayeth, that he savve it: and he nameth two witnesses therof, that is, Vrias and Zacharias, that were not borne in manie yeares after, saying; and I tooke vnto me tvvo faithful

vvitnesses, Vrias the prieste, and Zacharias 
                     Esay. 8. v. 2. 
                     the sonne of Barachias. Wherof the first was a Prophet in Ieremies tyme, a hundred years after Esay; & the secōd liued fowers Iere. 26. v. 20. kore years after that againe, in the dayes of pari', as by the beginig of his prophetie appeareth; and yet both (as you see) were Zac. 1. v. 1 distinctely named by Esay so long before.
                  And whereas this booke of Esay was pronoūced opēlie to the people (as other Circumstā
                        ces of certaine truth. propheties also were) and published into manie thousand handes before the captiuitie of Babylon fellowt: and then carried also with the people, and dispersed in Chaldea, & other partes of the world: there can be no possible suspition of forgerie in this matter; for that all the worlde both sawe it, and redde it, manie yeares before the thing came to passe; yea, when there was no opiniō of suche possibilitie.
                  The same captiuitie and destruction of Ierusalem, by the Babyloniens, was prophetied 9. The propheties and doinges of Ieremie in the siege of Hierusalē. by Ieremie, a hundred yeares after Esay, and a litle before the matter came to passe. Yea whiles the Babylonians were aboute the walles of Ierusalem, and besieged the same for two yeares together, Ieremie was within and tolde euerie man that it was but in vaine to defende the Citie, sor that God had now deliuered it. And albeit he were accompted a traitour for so speaking, (especiallie when by an armie of Egipt that came to th' ayde of Ierusalem frō Pharao, the siege of Babylonians

was raised for a certaine tyme:) yet Ieremie continued still his asseueration, and said to Zedechias the king, thou shalt 
                     Ierem. 37. v. 16. 
                     be deliuered into the handes of the king of Babylon. And to the people; haec dicit Dominus, tradendo tradetur haec ciuitas, &c. this sayeth Ierem. 38 v. 3. our Lord, this Citie most certainlie shalbe deliuered into the handes of the Babylonians. And so he continued, notwithstanding he were putt in prison, and whipt, & threatened daylie to be hanged; vntil in deed the Citie was taken, and Zedechias Ierem. 39. 4. Reg. 24 & 25. eyes puld out, his children slaine before his face, and all other, thinges perfourmed, which Ieremie had prophotied and fortolde them before.
                  And which is yet more maruelous, Ieremie dyd not onelie fortell the particulers of this captiuitie, but also the determinate tyme, how longe it should indure, sayinge: And all this land of Jurie shal be into vvildernesse, and astoniednesse; and all this people 
                     
                        Ierem. 25. v. 11. The yeares fortolde of the captiuitie of Babylon. 
                     shal serue the kinge of Babycon for threescore and ten yeares, and vvhen three scare and ten yeares shalbe complete, I vvill visite vpon the kinge of Babylon, and vpon that Natiō, sayeth our Lordo, and I vvill lay the same into aeternal desolation. Eut vpon Iuda, vvill I cast my pleasant eyes, and vvil bringe them backe to this land againe, &c. In which prophetie is conteined, first the Ierem. 24. v. 5. &c. 29. v. 10. particuler tyme, how longe this captiuitie should indure. Sechdlie, the destruction of Babylon, and of that Monarchie, by the Persians: and thirdlie the returning home of the Iewes againe; which three thinges

to haue bene after fulfilled, not onelie Esdras, 1. Esd. 1. & 2. 3. Esd. 2. that liued at that tyme, and was an actor in perfourmaunce of the last; but all other heathen writers besides, doe recorde and testifie.
                  And this prophetie of Ieremie, was so famous and certainlie beleeued amongest all the Iewes, in the tyme of their captiuitie: as when the daye of expiration drew neare, Daniel writeth thus of hym selfe: In the first yeare of Darius, I Daniel, vnderstoode in the scriptures, the number of the seuētie yeares, 
                     Dan. 9. v. 1. 
                     vvherof God spake to Ieremie, that they should be fulfiled, touching the desolation of Ierusalem; and I turned my face to my Lord God, and besoght hym, in fasting and sakcloth, &c. Mother onelie the Iewes vnderstoode and beleeued this Gentiles beleeued the scripture. prophetie; but euen Cyrus hym self, that was a Gētile, gaue full credit ther vnto, & therby was iuduced to restore the Iewes; as appeareth both by his owne wordes 1. Esd. 1. 3. Esd. 2. and proclamation, sett downe by Esdras, that executed the same; & by his deedes also, in restoring home the Iewes, and rebuilding their temple at his owne great charges, as all historiographers of the heathens doe confesse.
                  I might here alleage infinite other examples, and make no ende, if I would followe the multitude of propheties which are dispsed throughout the whole scripture? I might shew how Daniel fortolde The propheties of Daniel. to Balsasar king of Babylon, in the myddest of his triūphe, and in the hearing of all his peeres, the destruction which in Dan. 5.
                     
sned vpon hym the verie same night after.
                  I might alleage how the same Daniel in the first yeare of Darius the Median, in Dan. 11. the beginning of that second Monarchie of Medians and Persians, fortolde Beholde three kings shall yet stād in Persia, and the fovverth shalbe rich aboue all the rest. how manie kinges should regine after in Persia, & how the last (who was the fowerth after hym, & his name also Dariꝰ,) should fight against the Graeciās, & be ouercome by a Graeciā king (which was Alexāder;) and how that kingdome also of Greece, should be deuided & torne in peeces, after Dan. 11. v. 2. Alexanders death, and not passe to his posteritie, as Iustine and other heathen writers Instin. hist. l. 12. & 13. doe testifie that it was, by Antigonus, Perdiccas, Seleucus, Antiochus, Ptolomaeus and other Captaines of Alexander, that, deuided the same among them selues, aboue a hundred yeares after Daniel was deade.
                  I might declare how the same Daniel The sovver Monarchies of Assyrians, Persians, Graecians, and 
                           〈◊〉
                         Romans. forsawe and fortolde, the fower greate Monarchies of the world, and described the same as distinctelie, as if he had liued in them all, and as by experience we finde since to be true. I might alleage, the particuler descriptiō of the fight betwene Darius Dan. 2. Dan. 8. The fortelling of great Alexander. Ioseph. l. 1. de antiq. Iudaic. 
                           〈◊〉

And therfore Alexander (as Iosephus reporteth) comming to Ierusalem about a hūdred yeares after, and reading

this prophetie of Daniel interpreted vnto hym by Iaddus the highe priest; assured hym self that he was the man therin signified, and so, after sacrifice dōne to the God of Israel, (of whom he affirmed, that he had appeared vnto hym in Macedonie, & had exhorted hym to take this warre in hand,) and after he had bestowed much honour and manie benefits, vpon the highe priest and inhabitans of Ierusalem: he went forward in his warre against Darius with greate alacritie, and had that famous victorie which all the world knoweth.
                  A hundreth such propheties more, which are as plaine, as euident, and as distincte as this, I might alleage of Elias, Elizaeus, Samuel, Dauid, Ezechiel, the twelue lesser prophetes, and of other which I haue not named. And in verie truth the whole scripture is nothing els, but a diuine kynde of bodie replenished throughout with the vital spirit of prophetie, and euerie daye some prophetie or other is fulfilled, (though we marke it not) and shalbe to the worldes ende.
                  And the miracle of this matter is yet more increased, if we consider what manner VVhat maner of persons our prophetes vvere. of people they were for the moste parte, by whome thes propheties of hydden thiges were vttered: to witt, not such men as could gather their forsight of thinges by Astronomie or Astrologie, that is, by contemplation of the starres, as some fond Gentiles did pretēde, (though

Ptolomie denye that such thinges can be Ptolo. in l. de fructu. forrolde but only by inspiratiō frō God;) nether yet were they so sharpe witted, as to attaine to prophetie by stronge imaginations, Moses Narbon. in lib. Abubacher & 
                           〈◊〉
                        . as most vainlie Auerroes and his followers hold that some man may; nor finallie, were they so delicatelie fed as by exacte dyet and rules of Alchymie, to come to prophetie, as Alchymists dreame that a man may doe, and that Apollonius Thyanaeus did, who by Stellified meates Roger. Baco. l. de sex. sciēt. experimentalib. (as they speake) came to be Stellified hym self, and so by helpe of his glasse called Alchymusi, to fortell some matters and affaires to come. Our prophetes (I say) knew none of thes phantasticall deuises, being for the most parte, poore, simple, & vnlearned men, as in particuler is recorded, that Dauid was a shepheard, & Amos was a keeper of Oxen; yea, often tymes Amos 1. they were women, as Marie the sister of Aaron, called in scripture by the name of Exod. 15. Prophetesse. Debora the wife of Lapidoth; Anna the mother of Samuel; Elizabeth the mother of Iohn Baptist; Anna Iudic. 5. 1.

the certaintie conteined therin.
                  
                     AND NOVV albeit, this might seeme THE. 8. proofe of scripturs. Approbatiō of heathen vvriters. sufficient in the iudgement and consciēce of euerie reasonable man, (as the Iew supposeth) to proue that the scriptures be onlie from God, and cōsequentlie by thē, that there is a God: yet hath he one reason more to confirme their sinceritie, which I will alleage in this place, and therwith make an ende. His reason is, that although thes Holie writinges whiche proceede of Gods spirite, doe not take their testimonie or confirmation from mā: yet for more euidencie of the truth, God hath so prouided, that all the principall and most straunge and wonderful thinges recompted in scripture, should be reported also, and confirmed by insidels, Pagās, Gentiles, and heathē writers them selues; albeit in some poynctes, they dyffer from the scripture in the manner of their narration, for that they adioine superstitions therunto. Which maketh the more for approbation of the thinges, for that hereby it appeareth, they tooke not their stories directelie from the Bible, but by tradition and most auncient antiquities of their owne.

them, as they are in the scriptures,) & by all other, that doe sce in reason, that of necessity, their must be yelded some Creator of thes thinges. Next to this, the flud 2. The slud of Noe. of Noe is mentioned by diuers most auncient heathē writers; as by Berosus Chaldaeus, Ieronymus Egyptius, Nicolaus Damascenus, Gen. 6 7. 8.

The longe life of the first fathers. according as the scripture reporteth it, not onlie the former authours, but also Manethus, that gathered the historie of the Egyptiās; Molus Hestiaeus, that wrote Gen. 5. & 10. & 11. the actes of the Phaenicians; Hesiedus, Hecataeus Abderida, Helanicus, Acusilaus, & Ephorus, doe testifie, that thes first inhabitantes of the world liued commonly a thousand yeares a peece, and they alleage the reason therof to be, both for the multiplication of people, and for bringing all sciences to perfectiō, especially Astronomie and Astrologie, which, (as they write,) could not be brought to sufficient perfection, by anie one mā that had liued lesse then 600. yeares, in which space the greate yeare (as they call it) returneth

aboute.

And thes Gentiles doe shew by reason, that if there had not bene some such miracle in the diuision of tongues; no doubt, but that all tongues, being deriued of one, (as all Marke this reason. mē are of one father,) the same tongues would haue retained the self same rootes and principles, as in all dialectes or deriuations of tongues we see that it cōmeth to passe. But now (saye they) in manie tongues at this day, we see that there is no likelihode or affinitie among them, but all different th' one from th' other, and therby it appeareth, that they were made diuers and distincte euen from the beginning.

Of Isaac, Iacob, Iob, Ioseph &c. albeit he mingle some tymes certaine fables, wherby appeareth, that he tooke his storie not owt of the Bible wholie. And he alleageth one Leodemus, Gen. 15. 16. 17. 18. &c. who (as he sayeth) liued with Moyses, and wrote the same self thinges that Moyses did; so that thes writers agree almost in all thinges, touching Isaac, Iacob, Ioseph, and all their affaires, euen vnto Moyses; and with thes doe concurre also Theodotus a most auncient Poet, Artabanus and Philon, Gentiles.

And that the Ethiopians learned

circuncisiō of him, which afterward alwayes they retained, and so doe vntill this day. And as for his miracles donne in Egypt; his leading the people thence by the reade sea; his liuing with them fortie yeares in the desert; the heathen writers agree in al things, with the scriptures, sauing onely that they recōpt diuers things to the praise of Moyses, which he hath not writen of him self, adding also his description, to witt, that he was a longe taule man, with a yeolowe bearde, and The discription of Moyses person out of heathen vvriters. longe heare. Wherwith also accordeth Numenius Pythagoricus, touching the actes of Moyses, whose life he sayeth, that he had reade in the auncientest recordes, that were to be had.

And with Eupolemꝰ, agree Polyhister & Hecataeus Abderita, that liued & serued ī warre with king Alexāder the great, and they make mention amongest other thīges, of the inestimable riches of Salomō, and of the treasures which he did The treasures hiddē in the sepulcher of Dauid. hyde and burie, (according to the fascion of that tyme) in the sepulcher of his father Dauid: which to be no fable, (though not mentioned by the scripture,) Iosephꝰ

The things that ensued after Salomons dayes. among them selues, and their diuers warres, afflictions, and transmigrations into other cōtries; manie heathen writers doe mention and recorde them, and among other, Herodotus and Diodorus Sieulus. And the fornamed Alexander Polyhistor, talking of the captiuitie of Babylon, sayeth, that Ieremie a Prophet, tolde Ioachim Iere. 37. 4.

                  And finallie, I will conclude with Iosephus the learned Iewe, that wrote imediatelie after Christs ascension and protesteth, that the publique writinges of the Syriaus, Chaldaeans, Phenicians, and Ioseph. l. 1. de Antiq. Iudaica. innumerable hystories of the Graecians, are sufficiēt to testifie the antiquitie, truth, authoritie, and certaintie of holie scriptures, if there were no other proofe in the world besides.
               
               
                  The cōclusion of the chapter, vvith th' applicatiō. Sect. 4.
                  
                  THus farre haue I treatede of the wayes and meanes, which haue bene left to the world from the beginninge, therby to know & vnderstande their Maker. In treating which point I haue stayed my self the longer, for that it is the groūd & foundatiō of all that is or maye be said hereafter. It is the first, & final, & chiefest principle of all our eternal saluation or damnatiō, and of the total weale or woe, that must befail vs & possesse vs for euer.
                  Which grounde and veritie, if it be so certaine and euident as before hath bene shewed by all reason and proofe both diuine and humane; and that the matter be so testified and proclamed vnto vs, by No excuse of the ignorance of God. all the creatures of heauen and earth, and by the mouth and writing of our Creator hymself, as no ignorance or blindnes

can excuse the same; no slouthfulnes dissemble it, no wickednes denie it: what remaineth then, but to consider with our selues, what seruice this God requireth at our hádes? what gratitude, what duetie, what honour for our creation? to th' ēde, that as we haue proued hym a most bountiful Creator, so we may fynde hym a propitious iudge, & munificent rewarder. For it is not probable, that his diuine maiestie which hath appointed euerie other creature to some action for his owne glorie, (as hathe bene declared at large before;) should leaue mankinde onelie, whiche is the worthiest of all the rest, without obligation to his seruice.
                  In which one pointe not withstanding, though neuer so cleare, (such is the The errour of the olde Philosophers. Rom. 1. & 2.
                      fondnesse of our corrupt nature without gods holie grace;) fayled thos auncient wise men of the world, of whom S. Paul speaketh so much in his epistle to the Romans, taking compassion of their case, and callinge them fooles and all their great learnīge & philosophie meere fondnesse; for that, vvheras (by the meanes before mentioned) they came to knovv God; they did 
                     Rom. 1. 
                     not seeke to glorifie hym, as appertained vnto God, not yet did render hym due thankes, but vanished avvaye in their cogitations; &c. That is, they tooke no profitt by this knowledge of theirs, but applied their cogitations vpon the vanities of this worlde, more then vpon the honour and seruice of this Rom. 1. v. 28. their God. For whiche cause, S. Paul adioyneth

presentelie in the same place, that forso much as they did thus, & did not shew foorthe by their lyfe and workes, that they had the knowledge of God in deede: God deliuered them ouer to a reprobate sense, and suffered them to fall into horrible synnes, which S. Paul doth name and detest in all that chapter; and finallie concludeth, that their euerlasting perdition ensued principallie vpon this one pointe; that wheras, they knevv the iustice of God, (by all the wayes and argumē
                        tes Rom. 1. E v. 32. that before haue bene declared:) yet would they not vnderstand (saith he) that death was due to all such, which liued in wickednes, as they did.
                  
                  And the same Apostle, vpon consideration A general sentēce pronounced by S. Paul. of thes matters, wherin he standeth long for th' importance therof, pronounceth in sine this general sentence, with great asseueration and vehemencie of spirit: that the vvrath of God is reucaled from heauē
                      
                     Rom. I. V. 18. 
                     vpon al impietie and iniustice of thos men, vvho holde the knovvledge of God in vnrighteousnes. that is, who beig indued with the knowledge of God, doe liue notwithstanding vnrighteouslie, or, (as he saidbefore) doe consume their dayes in vanitie, not makīg accompt of the seruice, which they doe owe to that God for their Creation and other benefites. Which thinge, if S. Paul might trulie saye vnto these Gentiles before his tyme, who had onelie natural knowledge and vnderstanding of God; that is, so much as by his creatures was to

be gathered: what may or shalbe said vnto Th' application to our selues. vs, who haue not onelie that light of nature which they had; but also the wrytinges ànd lawe of God hymself, communicated speciallie vnto the Iewes; and aboue that also, haue hearde the voyce of his onelie sonne vpon earth, and haue receiued the doctrine of his most holie ghospel, and yet doe liue as negligentelie (manie of vs) as did the verie heathens, touching good life and vertue?
                  Surelie, in this case, I must denounce against my self, that if it be true, (as it can not be false,) which this blessed Apostle affirmeth here of thes heathen philosophers, that by that litle knowledge they had of God, they vvere made inexcusable: then Rom. 1. v. 20. by the most iust & certaine rule of Christ, layed downe in S. Luke, 
                        cui multum datum est, multum quaretur ab eo, that of euerie man Luc. 12. which hath receiued much, a greater accompte shalbe taken for the same: we are forced to inferre, that our accompt shalbe greater, and our selues much more inexcusable before his diuine maiestie, thē the verie Gentiles and heathens are; if after all our knowledge and manifest vnderstanding of his Godhead and iustice, vve vanishe avvay in our cogitatiōs, as they did, & as most parte of the world at this day are sene to doe; that is, if we applie our cogitatiōs & cares, aboute the vaine affaires of this tēporal life and trāsitorie cōmodities, which we should bestowe vpō the seruice and honour of this our Lord and Creator.
               
            
            
               
               OF THE FINAL ENDE AND CAVSE WHIE MAN WAS CREATED BY GOD and placed in this world. And of th' obligation he hath therby, to attende to th' affaire for vvhich he came hyther. CHAPT. III.
               BY the Chapter precedent, I nothing doubt (gétle reader,) but, if thou haue sene and perused the same, thou remainest sufficientlie informed of thy Creator. Now followeth it by order of good consequence, that we cōsider with some attention, (for that it standeth vs much vpon,) A necessarie Consideration. what intent & purpose God had in creating vs and this world for our sakes, and in placing vs therin as Lords of the same? By the former considerations we haue learned, that as among other creatures,

nothing made it self; so nothig was made for it self, nor to serue it self. The heauens (we see) doe serue th' ayer, th' ayer serueth th' earth, th' earth serueth beastes, the beastes serue man; and then is the questió, whom mā was made to serue? For in hym also, holdeth the former reason, that seig he was not made by hym self: it is not likelie that he was made to serue hym selfe
               If we consult with the scripture herein; we finde a general sentence layed downe without exception; Vniuersa propter semetipsum 
                  Prou. 16. 
                  operatus est Dominus, our Lorde hath made all thinges for hym self. And if all; the man likewise (no doubte,) who is Man made to serue God. not the least of the rest which he hath made. And hereby it cometh to passe, that man can not be said to be free, or at his owne appointement or disposition in this world, but obliged to perfourme that thing, for which he was sent into this habitation. Which pointe holie Iob declareth plainelie, in a certaine inuectiue that he maketh against such men as were careles and negligent in consideration of this affaire. A vaine man (sayeth Iob. 11. he) is lifted vp in pride, and thinketh hym self to be borne as free, as the colt of a vvilde asse. That is, he thinketh hym self bound to nothīg, subiect to nothīg, accōptable for nothing that he doth in this life: but onlie borne free, to passe his time ī disporte & pleasure, as a wilde colte in a desert, that hath no Master to tame hym. Whiche in other

words, the wise mā vttereth thus: He estremeth 
                  Sap. 15. 
                  this life of ours, for aplaigame, & therfore careth not how he liueth or wherin he spéd & passe-ouer the tyme. And this of the man, whó the scripture calleth Vaine.
               
               But now for the sooer, wise, and discrete, of whom it is writen, the vvay of life is vpon the learned, to th' ende they may decline 
                  Pro. 15. 
                  from the lovvest hell: they are farre from so greate follie, as to imagine that no accompt shall be demanded of our being in this world; for that they haue reade, that God shall bring into iudgement, vvhat so euer is 
                  Eccle. 11. & 12. 
                  donne, for euerie fault that is commytted. And the Christian man knoweth further by the mouth and asseueration of his Saue our Mat. 12. and Redeemour, that he shall be accomptant for euerie idle worde that he misvttereth; and finalie, there is no man that is ether of reason, or conuersant in the writinges Accompt to be rēdered. and testament of his Creator, but remembreth well, that among all other irritations, wherby the wicked man is said to prouoke Gods patience to indignation, none is more often repeated or more greeuouslie taken, then, that he said 
                  Psal. 9. 43 & 141. 
                  in his harte, God vvill as ke no accompt.
               
               With thes men then alone, shall be my speeche in this present chapter, who haue a desire to discharge well this accompte. For attayning wherof (trulie,) I can gyue them no better counsaile, instruction, or aduise, then to doe in this case, as a good marchant-factour is wonte to doe, when he arriueth in forraine Countries, or as a

souldiar or Capitaine sent by his prince to some greate exploite, is accustomed, when he cometh to the place appointed: that is, to weigh and consider deepolie, for what cause he came thither? whie he Profitable 
                        〈◊〉
                      and considerations. was sent? to what ende? what to attempte? what to prosecute? what to perfourme? what shalbe expected and required at his handes, (vpon his returne,) by hym that sent hym thyther? For thes cogitations (no doubt) shall stirre hym vp to attende to that, for which he came, & not to imploy his tyme in impertinent affaires. The lyke would I counsail a Christian to putt in vre, concerning the case proposed, and to demande of hymself, betwene God and his conscience, why, and wherfore, and to what endo, he was created & sent hythe: into this worlde? what to doe? wherin to bestowe his dayes? &c.
               And then shal he fynde, that for no other cause, matter, or ende, but onlie to serue God in this life, and by that seruice, to gaine heauen and saluation in the lyfe to come. This was the condition of our Gen. 14: Deut. creation, as Moyses well expresseth; and this was the consideration of our redeeming, fortolde by Zacharie, before we were yet redeemed; that vve being deliuered 
                  Luc. 1. 
                  foorth of the handes of our enimies, should serue God, inholines and righteousnes, all the dayes of our liues.
               
               Of this consideration doe ensue two The. 1. consequence upon due consideration, of our ende. consequentes to be obserued. Whereof

the first is, that seinge our ende and final cause of being in this worlde, is to serue God, and therby to worke our owne saluation: whatsoeuer thinge we doe, or bestowe our tyme in, which ether is contrarie or impertinent, or not profitable to this ende, (though it were to gaine kingdomes,) it is vanitie and lost labour, that will turne vs in tyme to griefe and repē
                  tance, (if we change not our course,) for that it is not the matter for which we came īto this life, nor wherof we shalbe demanded an accompt, except it be to receyue iudgement and punishement for the same.
               Secondlie it followeth of the same consideration, that seing our onlīe busines The 2. consequēce. and affaire in this worlde, is to serue our Maker, and saue our owne soules; and, that all other earthelie creatures are put here to serue our vses to that onlie ende: we should for our partes be indifferent to all thes creatures, as to riches or pouertie; to health or sicknes; to honour or cōtempte; to lytle learning or much learning: and we should desire onlie so much or litle of either of them as were best for vs to th' attainement of our said ende and Butte pretended; that is, to tho seruice of God & the weale of our soules. For who so euer desireth, seekthe, loueth, or vseth thes creatures, more thē for this: rūnneth from his ende for which he came hyther.
               By this then, may a careful Christian Hovv eche 
                        〈◊〉
                      may take a scā
                     teling of his estate. take some scanteling of his owne estate

with God, and make a cōiecture whether he be in the right waye, or no. For if he attende onlie or principallie to this ende, for which he was set hyther; if his cares, cogitations, studdies, endeuours, labours, talke, conuersation, and other his actiōs, doe runne vpon this matter, and that he careth no more for other creatures, as honours, riches, learnig, and the lyke, thē 
                  A right course. they are necessarie vnto hym for this ende that he pretēdeth: If his dayes & life be spent in this studdie of the seruice of God, and procuring his owne saluatiō in carefulnes, feare, and trembling, as th' Apostle aduiseth hym: then is he (doubteles) Philip. 2. a most happie and blessed man, and shall at length attaine to the kingedome which he expecteth.
               But if hē finde hym self in a contrarie A vvrong and dangerous course. case and course; that is, not to attende in deede to this matter for which onlie he was sent hyther; nor to haue in his hart & studie this seruice of God and gayning heauen, but rather some other vanitie of the world, as promotion, wealth, pleasure, sumptuous apparrel, gorgeous buildinges, beautie, fauour of princes, or anie other thing els, that apparteineth not vnto this ende: if he spend his tyme about thes trifles, hauing his cares and cogitations, his talke and delight, more in thes thinges, then about th' other greate busines of gayning Gods eternal kingdome, for which he was made and placed in this wold: Then is he (I assure hym) in a peri

lous waye, leading directelie to perditió, except he alter and change his course. For, most certaine it is, that who so euer shal not attende vnto the seruice he came for; shal neuer attaine therewarde assigned and promissed to that seruice.
               And for that, the most parte of all this worlde (not onlie of infidels but also The reason vvhie so fevv are saued. Christiās,) doe rūne amisse in this pointe, and doe not take care of that affaire and busines, for which alone they were created and placed heere: hence it is, that Christe and his holie Sainctes, bothe before and after his appearance in fleshe, Mat. 7. 20 & 22. Lut. 13. haue spoken so hardlie and seuerelie, of the verie simal number that shalbe saued (euen among Christians,) and haue vttered certaine speeches, which seeme verie rigourous to fleshe and blood, (& to such as are most touched therin) scarse credibile, albeit they must be fulfilled. As among other thinges, that a louer of this Iacob. 4. Mat. 19. Marc. 10. worlde can not be saued; that riche men doe enter as hardlie into heauen, as a Camel through a Needles eye, and the like; The reason of which maner of speeches doth stande in this, that a riche man or worldling, attending with all his industrie to heape riches (as the fashion is,) can not attende, (nor euer doth,) to that for which he came into this world, and consequentelie, can neuer attaine heauen, except God worke a miracle, and therby doe cause hym to spende oute his riches to the benefyte of his soule, (as some

tymes he doth,) and so doe lessen the Camel in suche sorte, as he may passe the Needles eye. Wherof we haue a verie rare Luc. 19. example in the Gospel, of Zachaeus, who beinge a riche man did presentelie vpō th' entering of Christ into his house, (and muche more as appeareth into his harte,) resolue hym self, to change his former A perfect example of a good conuersion. course touchinge riches, and at one blowe to begynne withall, gaue awaye halfe of all he possessed to the poore; and for the rest, made proclamation, that who soeuer had receaued anie wrong at his handes, (as comonlie manie doe by them that are riche,) he should come and receyue fower tymes so much amendes. By which almes and restitution, he deliuered hym self from the Camels gibbe or bunch on his backe, that letted his passage through the Needles eye. And this extraor dinarie fauour and grace he receyued, by the fortunate presence of his most blessed and bountiful Guest, who had signified before in an other place, that hym self was able, so to drawe the Camel, as he should passe the Needles eye; for that thinges impossible to man, were possible to Mat. 19. Marc. 10. God.
               But to leaue this, and to goe forwarde in our former purpose; no mauaile it is, if in the world abrode, so fewe be saued, seing that of thousandes, skarse one doth accompt of that busines, whiche of all other, is the chiefe and principall. Consider you the multitude of all sorte of

people vpon earthe, and see what their trafike and negotiation is? see whether they treate this affaire or no? see wherin The vvrōg course of the vvorld. their care, and studie, and cogitation consisteth? How manie thousandes finde you in Christiandome, who spende not one houre of fower and twentie, nor one halfe daye of fortie, in the seruice of God, or busines of their soule? how infinite haue you, that breake their braines aboute worldlie cōmodities, and how few that are troubled with this other cogitation? how manie finde tyme to eate, drinke, sleepe, disporte, decke and trim ne them selues to the vew of others; and yet haue no tyme to bestowe in this greatest busines of all other busines? how manie passe ouer whole dayes, weekes, monethes, and yeares, (and finallie their whole liues,) in haukīg hūting, & other pastimes, without regarde of this importāt affaire? how manie miserable women haue you in the world, that spend more dayes in one yeare in pricking vp their apparell and adorning their carcasse, then they doe houres i prayer for the space of all their life? And what (alas) shall become of this people in th' ende? what will they doe or saye at the daye of accompte? what excuse will they alleage? what waye will they turne them? A Cōparison expressing theranitie of our occupatiōs.
               
               If the marchand-factour, which I mentioned before, after manie years spent in forraine countries vpon his Masters exspences, should returne at length, & gyue

vp his accomptes, of so much tyme and monie spent in singinge; so much in daunsinge; so muche in fencinge; so much in Courtig: who would not laugh at so fond a recōning? but being further demaūded of his master, what tyme he had bestowed vpon the marchandise and affaires for which he was sent; if the man should answer, that he had not leasure to thinke vpon that thing for the great occupation whiche he had in th' other: who would not esteeme hym worthie of all punishement and confusiō? And much more shame and confusion (no doubt,) shall they sustaine at the last dreadfull day, in the face and presence of God and all his. Angels, Math. 16. who being sent into this world to traffique so riche a marchādise as is the kingdome of heauen; haue neglected the same, and haue bestowed their studdies, vpō the moste vaine tryfles and follies of this world, without cogitation or care of th' other.
               O ye children of Adam, (saith the spirit Psal. 4. Hiere. 2. of God) whie loue you so vanitie, and seeke after lies? Whie leaue you the foū
                  taine, and seeke after Cesternes? If a goldē Game of inestimable value, should be proposed to suche as would rūne and could winne the same; and when the course or A Comparison. rase were begunne, if some should steppe asyde and follow flies or fethers that passed in th' ayer, without regarde of the price & Goule proposed: who would not maruaile and take pittie of their follie?

Euen so is it with men of this world, if we belieue S. Paul, who affirmeth, that 8. Cor. 9. we are all placed together in a Course or rase, and that heauen is propounded vnto vs for the Game or Price: But euerie man (saith he) arriueth not thyther; and why? for that most men doe steppe a syde and leaue the marcke. Most men doe runne awrie, and doe followe fethers vp and downe in th' ayer; most men doe pursue vanities, and doe wearie them selues oute in the pursute therof, vntill they can nether runne, nor goe, nor moue their limmes anie further; and then for the most parte it is to late to amende their follie. Will you heare the lamentations of suche vnfortunate men? These are their owne wordes recorded by scripture. We are wearied out in the waye of iniquitie and perdition; and the waye 
                        Sap. 5. The complainte of vvorldlīgs, in th' ende of their life. of God we haue not knowen. What profitt haue we receyued of all our pompe & pride, and vaunting riches? what good haue they donne vs? They are now past awaye, as a shadoe, and as a messenger that rideth in post, and we are consumed in our owne iniquities.
               
               This is the lamentable complainte of such men, as ranne awrie and followed a wronge course in their actions of this life. Thes are they, who pursued riches, honour, pompe, and like vanities, and forgate the busines for which they were sent. Thes are they, who were esteemed happie men in this world, and thought to

runne a most fortunat course, in that they heaped much riches together; aduaunced them selues and their families to greate The fondé iudgemēt off the vvorld. dignities; became gorgeous, & glorious, and dreadful to others; and finallie, obtained what so euer their lust and concupiscence desyred. This made them seeme blessed to earthelie cogitations, and the waye wherin they ráne, to be most prosperous and happie. And I make no doubt, (by experience of thes our tymes) but they had admirours and enuiours in great. abundance, who burned in desire to obtaine the same course. And yet when I heare their complainte in this place, and their owne confession wherin they saye expresselie, vve senseles men did erre from the 
                  Sap. 5. 
                  vvay of truth: when I consider also th' addition of scripture, Taliadixerunt in inferno, 
                  they spake thes thinges when they were in hell:I can not but esteeme their course for most miserable, and condemne wholy the iudgement of flesh in this affaire.
               Wherfore (my brother) if thou be wise, yelde not to this decept of worldlie lippes and tongues, that vse to blesse & sanctific such as are in most daunger and nearest Psal. 10 to perdition. Leane rather to the sincere councel of S. Paul, who willeth the Gal 6. to examine vprightlie thy owne workes and wayes, and so to iudge of thie selfe without decepte. If thou walke the waye of Babylon, most certaine it is, that thou shalt neuer arriue at the gates of Hierusalem, except thou chaunge thie course. O

(my brother) what a gryese will it be vnto thee, when after longe labour and much toyle, thou shalt finde thie self to haue gone a wrie? if a man had trauailed A comparyson expressing our gryese in th' ende, for our running a vvronge course. but one whole daye, and therby made wearie, should vnderstande at night, that all his labour were lost, & that his whole iourney was out of the waye; it would be a marueloꝰ afflictiō vnto hym (no doubt,) albeit no other incōueniēce were therin, but onlie the losse of that dayes trauaile, which might be recouered and recompenced in the next. But if besides this, his busines were great; if it laye vpon his life to be at the place whether he goeth, at a certaine hower; if the losse of his waye were irrecouerable; if the punishment of his errour, must be death and confusion; and hym self were so wearie that he could stirre no one foote further: imagine then, what a gryeuous message this would be vnto hym, to heare one say: Sir; you are amisse, and haue ridden wholie besides your way?
               So then wil it be vnto the, (my soule,) at the daye of death and separation The miserie of a soule that hath gone avvrie at the last day. from my bodie, if in this life, thou attende not to thy saluation for which thou were created, but shalt passe ouer thy dayes in followinge of vanities. Thou shalt finde thy self a straye at th' ende of thy iournei; thou shalt finde thy self wearie, and inforced to saye withe those miserable damned spirites, I haue vvalked hard and craggie 
                  Sap. 5. 
                  vvayes, for that in deede the waye of

wickednes is full of thornes and stones, though in shew it be couered with faire grasse & manie flowers. Thou shalt finde at that daye, that thou hast lost thy labour, lost thy tyme, lost all opportunitie of thy owne commoditie. Thou shalt finde thie errour to be irrecouerable, thie daū
                  ger vnauoydable, thie punishement insupportable, thie repentance vnprofitable, and thie griefe, and sorrow, and calamitie inconsolable.
               Oh, he that could beholde and feele th' inwarde cogitations of a worldlie mans hart at that instant, after all his honours and pleasures were past; no doubt, but he should finde hym of an other iudgement and opinion in thinges, then he was in the ruffe and heate of his ioylitie. He doth well perceyue then, the fondnes of those triffles which he followed in this life, albeit it were to make hym self a Monarche. If a man did know the cogitations Alexāders death. that Alexander the Great had, when of poison he came to die, after all his victories and incredible prosperitie; if we knew the thoughtes of Iuliꝰ Caesar at Iul. Caesar death. the day of his murder in the Senate house, after the conquest of all his enimies, and subiection of the whole world, to his owne onlie obediēce: we should well perceiue, that they tooke litle pleasure in the wayes they had walked, not withstanding they were esteemed most prosperous and happie, by men of this world. Tvvo rare examples.
               
               Iosephus the Iewe, recompteth two

very rare examples of humane felicitie, in Herode the first, and Agrippa his Cosine: Ioseph. l. 14 15. & 18 de antiq. Iudaica. & de bell. Iud. l. 2 wherof th' one by Antonie the Triumuir, and th' other by Caligula th' Emperour, (both of them being otherwise but priuate gentilmen, and in great pouertie and miserie when they fled to Rome,) were exalted vpon the suddaine, to vnexpected great fortune, and made riche Monarches and glorious Potentates. They were indued (at seueral tymes) with the kingdome and crowne of Iurie, & that in such ample sorte, as neuer any of that Nation after them had the like. For which cause they are called in the Hebrue storie, for distinctions sake, Herode the Great, and Agrippa the Great. They ruled and commaunded all in their dayes: they wanted nether siluer nor gold, nor pleasures, nor pastimes, nor friendes, nor flatterers. And besides all thes gyftes of fortune, they abounded also in ornamentes and excellencie of bodie and witte. And all this was increased and made the more admirable by reason of their For enuie onlie of Agrippa his fortune, Herodias did ruine her self and her husband, as Ioseph saith. l. 18. antiq. cap. 8. 9. 15. Her husband vvas Herod An tipas, that slevv. S. Iohn Baptiste and vvas sonne to Herode the first. Luc. 3. Mat. 14. base & low estate before, in respect wherof, their present fortune was esteemed for a perfect paterne of most absolute felicitie.
               This they enioyed for a certaine space, and to assure thē selues of the continuāce; they bent all their cares, cogitations, and studdies, to please the humours of the Roman Emperours, as their Gods and authours of all their prosperitie and felicitie vpō earth. In respect of whose fauours

(as Iosephus noteth,) they cared litle to violate their owne religiō of the Iewes, or anie thing els that was most Sacred. And this (forsooth) was esteemed of manie, a most wise, politique, prosperous, and happie course. But what was th' ende and consummation of this their rase?
               First, Herode fell sicke of such an incurable 
                     Herodes death. Iosep. l. 15. antiq. and lothesome desease, and was tormented in the same with so manie terrours, and horrible This Herod vvas called Ascolonita, & slevv th' infantes in Bethlem. Matth 2. accusations of his conscience; as he pronounced hym self to be the most miserable afflicted creature, that euer liued; and so calling one daye for a knife to pare an aple, would nedes haue mundered hym self with the same, if his arme had not bene stayed by them that stoode by. And for Agrippa, Iosephus reporteth, how that vpon a certaine daye which he kept festiual, in Caesarea, for 
                     The death of Agrippa. Iosep. l. 19. cap. 7. the honour of Claudius the Roman Emperour; when he was in his most extreme pompe and ioylitie, in the middest of all his Peeres, Nobles and Damosels, cōming foorth at an hower appointed, (all glittering in golde & siluer,) to make an oration vnto the people: his voice, gesture, countenāce, and apparel so pleased; as the said people began to crie (being sollicited ther vnto by some flaterours,) that it vvas the voyce of God, and not of man; wherin Agrippa taking pleasure and delectation; S. Luke saith, he vvas stroké by Gods Angel. Act. 12. And cōsider hovv Ioseph'agreeth vvith that Narration. was stoocken presentlie from heauen, with a moste horrible putrifaction of all his bodie, wherof he died, repeating

onlie to his friendes thes wordes, in the middest of his tormētes. Behold ye mee, that doe sente to you a God, hovv miserablie I am Inforced 
                  Euseb. l. 2. hist. cap. 9. 
                  to departe from you all.
               
               Now then would I demaunde of thes two so fortunate men, who laying a side all care of God and religion, did follow the prefermentes of this world so freshelie, and obtained the same so luckelie: how they liked of this their course and rase in th' ende? Trulie, I doubt not, but if they were here to answer for them selues; they would assure vs, that one hower bestowed in the seruice of God, and of their saluation; would more haue comforted them at that last instant, then all their labours & toiles which they tooke in their liues, for pleasing of Emperours, and gathering the grace and good likinge of mortal men.
               Vse then (ô Christian,) vse this experience Sincere and profitable counsaile. to thy commoditie: vse it to thy instructiō; vse it to thy forwarning. That which they are now, thou shalt be shortlie; and of all follies it is the greatest, not to profite or flee daungers by th' exāple of others. The difference betwene a wise mā and a foole, is, that th' one prouideth for a mischiefe while tyme serueth, & th' other would doe, whē it is to late. If thou mightest feele now, the state and case wherin thy poore hart shalbe at the last daye, for neglecting the thing that of all other it should haue studdied & thought vpō most: thou wouldest take frō thy meate, & sleepe,

and other necessaries, to repaire that is past. Hytherto thou hast time to refourme thy course, if thou please, which is no small benefite, if all were knowen. For in this sense (no doubt,) is it most true, which the wise man saith; that better it is Eccle. 4. to be a lyuing dogge, then a dead Lyō. For that, while the daye tyme of this life indureth; all thinges amisse may easelie be amē
                  ded. But the dreadful night of death will Ioh. 9. ouertake thee shortlie, & then shall there be no more space of reformation.
               Oh that men would be wise and forsee Deut. 32. thinges to come, sayeth one prophet. The greatest wisdome ī the world (deare brother,) is to looke and attēde to our owne saluation. For as the scripture sayeth most trulie; he is a vviseman in deede, that is vvise to 
                  Eccle. 37. 
                  his ovvne soule. And of this wisdome it is writen in the verie same booke, as spoken by her self. In mee is the grace of all life and 
                  Eccle. 24. 
                  truth, and in mee is the hope of all life and vertue. In moral actions and humane wisdome, we see that the first and chyefest circumstance is, to regarde well and consider the ende. And how thē doe we omit the same, in this greate affaire of the kingdome of heauen? If our ende be heauē, what meane we so much to affect our selues to earth? if our ende be God; whie seeke we so greedilie the worldlie fauour of men? if Great follie and errous. our ende be the saluation and eternitie of our soule; why doe we follow vanities and temporalities of this life? vvhie spende 
                  Esa. 55. 
                  ye your monie, and not in breade? sayeth God

by Esay: vvhie bestovve ye your labour i thinges that vvill not yeld you savuritie? If our inheritance Ephe. 1. 1. Thes. 2. 2. Pet. 1. be, that we should reigne as kinges; whie putt we our selues in suche slauerie of creatures? if our birth allow vs to feede of bread in our fathers howse; whie delighte we in huskes prouyded for the Luc. 15. swine?
               But (alas) we may saye with the wise man in scripture. Fascinatio nugacitatis obscurat 
                  Sap 4. 
                  bona. 
                  The bewitching of worldlie trifles doth obscure and hyde from vs the things that are good & behouesull for our soules: ô most daungerous inchantement. But what? shall this excuse vs? no trulie: Errour in cur course of life is not pardoned. Ose. 4. for the same spirite of God hath left recorded: Populus non intelligens vapulabit. The people that vnderstādeth not shalbe beaten for it. And an other prophet to the same effect pronounceth. This people is not 
                  Esa. 28. 
                  vvise, and therefore he that made them, shall not pardon them, neither shall he that created them take mercie vpon them. It is writen of fooles: 
                     ventum seminabunt & turbinem metent. They shall sowe and cast their seede vpon the windes, and shall receyue for their haruest nothing els but a storme or tēpest. Wherby is signified, that they shall not onlie cast away and leese their labours, but also be punished and chastened for the same.
               Consider thē I beseeche the, (my deare A profitable forevvarning. brother) attētiueiie, what thou wilt doe or saye, when thie Lord shall come at the last daye and aske the an accompte of all thy labours, actiōs, and tyme spent in this

life? when he shall require a recōning of Math. 25. his talentes lent vnto the? when he shall say, as he said to the Farmour or Steward in the Gospel. Redde rationem villicatiouis 
                  Luc. 16. 
                  tuae, gyue accompt of thie Stewardshippe and charge committed vnto the? what wilt thou saye, when he shall examine & weigh & trie thie doiges, as golde is examined and tried in the fornace, that is, what ende they hade? wherto they were applied? to what glorie of God? to what profite of thie soule? what measure, and weight, and substance they beare? Balsasar king of Babylon, sitting at his banket merry vpon a tyme, espyed suddainlie, certaine fingares without a hande, that A rare chance that happened to Balsasar K. of Babylon. wrote in the wall ouer right against his table, thes three Hebrue wordes, MANE, THEKEL, PHARES. Which three wordes Daniel interpreted in thre sentences to Balsasar, Dan. 5. it his maner. MANE; God hath numbered thee (Balsasar) and thie kingdome. THEKEL; he hath weyghed thei the Goldsmiths balāce, & thou art founde to light. PHARES; for this cause, hath he deuided thee from thie kingdome, and hath gyuen the same to the Medes and Persians.
               Oh, that thes three golden and most siggnificant wordes, ingrauen by th' angel vpon Balsasars wall, were regestred vpō euerie dore and poste in Christiādome, or rather imprinted in the harte of eche Christian; especiallie the two first, that importe the numbering and weighing of all our actions, and that, in the weightes

and ballance of the Goldsmithe, where euerie graine is espied that wanteth. And If God examine straitlie th' actiōs of infidells, much more of Christiās is they be careles. if Balsasars actions, that was a Gentile, were to be examined in so nise and delicate a payre of balance, for their triall; & if he had so seuere a sentence pronounced vpon hym, that he should be deuided from life and kingdome, (as he was the same night followinge) Quia inuentus est minus habens, for that he was founde to haue Dan. 5. lesse weight in hym, then he should haue: what shall we thinke of our selfes that are Christians, of whom it is writē aboue all others; I vvill search the sinnes of Ierusalem 
                  Sopho. 1. 
                  vvith a candle? What shall we expect, that haue not onlie lesse weight thē we should haue, but no weight at all, in the most of our actions? what may such men (I saye) expecte, but only that most terrible threat of diuision made vnto Balsasar, (or rather A dreadful diuision. worse if worse may be,) that is, to be deuided from God and his Angels; from participation with our Saueour; from cō
                  munion of Sainctes; from hope of our inheritance; from our portion celestial, and life euerlastinge? according to th' expresse declaration, made hereof by Christ hym self in thes wordes, to the negligent seruant: The Lord of such a seruant, shall com' at a 
                  Math. 24.

               Wherfore (deare brother) to conclude The cōclusion. this chapter, I can saye nothing more in

this dangerous case, wherin the world so runneth awrie, but onlie exhorte thee (as Rom. 12. th' apostle doth,) not to conforme thy self to the common errour that leadeth to perdition. Fall at length to some reconning and accompt with thy life, and see where thou standest, and whether thou goest. If hytherto thou haue wandred and gone a straye: be sory for the tyme lost, but passe no further. If hytherto thou haue not cō
                  sidered the weightines of this affaire: serue thy selfe of this admonition, and remember that it is writen, that a wise man Pro. 5. profiteth by euerie occasion. Esteeme thy resolution in this one pointe, the chiefest menage that euer shall passe through thy handes in this world, albeit thou were 2 Monarche and Ruler of ten worldes together. And finallie, I will ende with the verie same wordes, wherwith the wise man concludeth his whole booke. Deum 
                  Eccle. 12. 
                  time, & mandataeius obserua; hoc est enim omnis homo. 
                  Feare God, and obserue his commaundements, for this is euerie man.That is; in this doth all and euerie man consist: his ende, his beginning, his life, and cause of being: that he feare God, and directe his actions to th' obseruance of his commaundementes; for that without this, he is no man, in effect, seing that he looseth all benefite, both of his name, nature, redemption, and creation.
            
            
               
               THAT THE SERVICE WHICH GOD REQVIRETH OF MAN IN this present life, is religion. VVith the particuler confirmations of Christian religion, aboue all other in the vvorld. CHAPT. IIII.
               HAVINGE prouedī the former chapiters, that there is a God, which created man; and that man in respecte hereof, & of other benefites receyued, is bounde to honour and serue the same God: the question may be made in this place, what seruice this is that God requireth, and wherin it doth consist? Whereunto th' answere is brief and Of religion. easie, that it is Religiō; which is a vertue, See S. Tho. 2. 22. quest. 81. 82. 83. that cōteyneth properlie, the worshippe and seruice that we owe vnto God: euen

as Pietie is a vertue, conteyning the dutie Pietie. that children doe owe vnto their parentes: and Obseruance an other vertue, that Obseruāce. comprehēdeth the regarde, that schollers and seruantes beare vnto their masters. In respect of which comparison and likenes betwene thes vertues, God faith by a certaine Malac. 1. Prophet. The fonne honoureth his father, & the seruát his master: if thē I be a father, vvher is my honour? if I be a Master, vvher is my feare?
               
               The actes of Religiō are diuers and different; The actis and operations of Religion. some internal, as deuotion and prayer; some other external, as adoration, worshippe, sacrifice, oblations, vowes, & such like, that are declarations and protestations of th' internal. It extendeth it self also, to stirre vp and putt in vre the actes and operations of other vertues for the seruice of God; in which sense S. Iames nameth it Pare and unspotted religion, to 
                  Iacob. 1. 
                  visite Orphanes & VVidovves in their tribulation, and to keepe our selues vndefiled from the vvickednes of this vvorld. Finallie, how so euer some heathens did vse this worde Religion to some other significations: yet, (as S. Augustine well noteth,) August. lib. 10. de ciuit. cap. 1. th' vse therof among the faytheful, hath alwayes bene, to signifie therby the worshippe, honour, and seruice that is due vnto God: so that if in one worde you Hovv much it importeth to be religions. will haue it declared, what God requireth of man in this life: it may be rightelie said, that all standeth in this, that he be Religious.
               Hereof it proceeded, that what so euer

sorte or sect of people in the world, professed reuerence, honour, or worshippe to God, or to Gods, or to any diuine power, essence, or Nature what soeuer; (were they Iewes, heathens, Gentiles, Christiās, Turkes, Moores, Heretiques, or other:) they did alwayes call their said professiō, by the name of their Religion. In which sense also and signification of the worde, I am to treate at this tyme of Christian religion, that is, of the substance, forme, maner, and waye reueiled by Christ and his Apostles vnto vs, of persourning our duetie and true seruice towardes God. Which seruice, is the first pointe necessarie to be resolued vpon, by hym that seeketh his saluatiō, as in the Chapter that goeth before hath bene declared. And The necessitie of Chri stiā religiō. for obteyning this seruice & true knowledge therof, no meane vpō earth is left vnto man, but onlie by the light and instruction of Christian religion, according to the protestation of S. Peter to the gouernours of the Iewes, whē he sayed. Ther is no other name vnder beauen gyuen vnto men 
                  Act. 4. 
                  vvherby to be saued, but only this of Christ and of his religion.
               
               If you obiecte against me, that in former tymes before Christes natiuitie, as vnder the law of Moyses for two thousand Hovv men vvere saued in olde time vvithout Christiā religiō. years together, there were many Sainctes that without Christian religion serued God vprightelie, as the Prophetes and other holie people; and before them againe, in the law of Nature, whē nether

Christiā nor Iuishe religion was yet heard of, for more then other two thousand years, there wanted not diuers that pleased God and serued hym trulie, as Enoche, Noe, Iob, Abraham, Iacob, and others: I answer, that albeit thes men (expeciallie the former, that liued vnder the law of nature;) had not so particuler & expresse knowledge of Christe and his mysteries as we haue now; (for this was reserued to the tyme of grace, as sainct Paule in diuers Gal. 3. & 4 Ephes. 3. Colos. 1. See S. Angust. li. 19. cont. Fanst. cap. 14. places at large declareth:) that is albeit they knew not expresselie, how and in what maner Christ should be borne; whether of a virgine or no; or in what particuler sorte he should liue and die; what sacramentes he should leaue; what waye of publishing his ghospel he should appointe, & the like; (wherof not withstanding verie manie particulers were reueiled to the Iewes from tyme to tyme, and the nearer they drew to the tyme of Christes appearance, the more plaine reuelation was made of thes mysteries:) yet (I say) all and euerie one of thes holie All olde Sainctes beleeued in Christ, and vvere saued by Irym. Sainctes, that liued from Adam vntill the comming of Christ, had knowledge in general of Christian religion, and did be lieue the same: that is, they belieued expresselie, that there should come a Saueour and Redeemer of man-kinde, to deliuer them from the bondage contracted by the sinne of Adam.
               This was reueiled straight after their fall, to our first parentes & progenitours

in Paradise; to witt, that by the vvomans 
                  Gen. 3. v. 15. 
                  seede, our redemption should be made. In respecte wherof it is said in the reuelations, that Christ is the Lambe that hath bene slaine from the beginning of the Apoc. 13. worlde. And S. Peter in the first general Councel holdē by th' Apostles, affirmeth, Act. 15. v. 11. that th' old aunciēt fathers before Christes Natiuitie, were saued by the grace of Christ, as we are now; which S. Paul confirmeth Rom. 5. Ephe. 8. in diuers places. And finallie, the matter is so cleare in this behalfe, that the Reade S. Thom in 1. 2. qu est. 103. art. 4. & August. l. 18. de ciu. c. 47. & ep. 49. & 157. & tract. 45. in Ioh. Cle. Alex. lib. 6. strom. & Hieron. in cap. 3. ad Gal. The differences betvvene our beleefe and th' old fathers. Esay. 7. Gen. 49. whole schoole of diuines accordeth, that the faith and religion of th' old fathers, before Christes appearance, was the verie same in substance that ours is now, sauing onlie, that it was more general, obscure, and confuse then ours is, for that it was of thinges to come, as ours is now of thinges past and present.
               For example; they, beleeued a Redeemer to come; and we beleeue that he is alredie come. They said, virgo concipiet, a Virgine shall conceyue; and we say virgo concepit, a virgine hath conceyued. They had sacrifices and caeremonies that presigured his cōming for the tyme ensuinge; we haue sacrifice and sacramentes that represent his beinge for the tyme present. They called their Redeemer, th' expetatiō of Nations; and we calle hym now, the saluatiō of Nations. And finallie, there was no other difference betwene the old faith of good men from the begining, & ours; but onlie in the circumstances of tyme., clearnes,

particularitie, and of the maner of protesting the same, by owtwarde signes and ceremonies. For that in substance they beleeued the same Redeemer that we doe, & were saued by the same beliefe in his merites, as we are. For which cause 
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   Eusebiꝰ well noteth, that as we are called now Christiās; so they were called then Christi, Psal. 104. that is, annointed, ī prefiguratiō of the true Christ, in whom they belieued, as the first & head of all other anoynted, and who was the cause and authour of their annoynting.
               By this then it is most manifest, that not onlie now to vs that be Christians, but at all other tymes from the begining of the world, & to all other persons and people what so euer, that desired to saue their soules, it was necessarie to beleeue and loue Christ, and to professe in harte his religion. For which consideration, I thought it not amisse in this place, after the former groundes layed, that their is a God; and that man was created and placed here for his seruice: to demonstrate The causes of this Chapter. and proue also this other principle, that the onlie seruice of this God, is by Christian religion. Wherin, albeit I doe not doubt, but that I shall seeme to manie, to take vpon me a superfluous labour, in prouing a veritie, which all men in Christendom doe confesse: yet, for the causes before alleaged in the second chapter, which moued me in that place to proue, there is a God: that is to saye, first, for the

comfort, strengthe, 2nd confirmation of suche, as either frō th' enimie may receiue temptations, or of them selues may desire to see a reason of their beleefe: and secondlie, for awakening, stirring, or stingig of others, who ether of malice, carelesnes, or sensualitie, are fallen in a slamber, and haue lost the feeling and sense of their beleefe, (for manie such wante not in thes our miserable dayes:) it shall not be (perhappes) but to verie good purpose, to laye together in this place, with the greatest breuity that possiblie may be, the most sure groundes and inuincible euidences, which we haue for declaration and confirmation of this matter.
               For albeit, as th' Apostle S. Paul declareth, Heb. 11. the thinges which we belieue, be not such in them selues, as may be made apparēt by reason or humane argumētes, for that our faith, that is, th' assent of our iudgemēt to the thinges propounded by God vnto vs, must be voluntarie, to th' ende it waye be meritorious: yet, such is the goodnes and most sweet proceeding of our merciful God towardes vs; as he will not leaue hym self without suficient testimonie both inwarde and owtward, as the same Apostle in another place doth Act. 14. testifie. For that inwardlie, he testifieth The diuers testimonies from God of the thinges that vve belieue. the truth of such thinges as we beleeue, by gyuing vs light and vnderstandinge, with internal ioye and consolatiō in beleeuing them. And owtwardle, he gyueth testimonie to the same, with so manie

conueniences, probabilites, and argumentes of credibilitis, (as Diuines doe call them:) that albeit the verie pointe of that which is belieued, remaine still with some obscuritie, (to th' ende there may be place for our will and merite:) yet are there so many circumstances of likelihodes, to induce a man to the beliefe therof; 'as in all reason it may seeme against reason to denie or mistrust them.
               This shall easelie appeare by the treatise following of Christ and Christianitie, and of the foundations of our religion, which shalbe confirmed by so manie pregnant reasons, and most manifest circústáces of euidét probabilitie: as I doubt not, but the zelous Christiá shall take exceedig cófort therin, & esteeme hymself happie, to haue a lotteī that faith & religion, wher he shall see and feele so much reason, proofe, and conueniencie to concurre and shew it self, for his satisfaction.
               And to this effect, it shalbe of no meane moment, that I haue proued before, the certaintie, diuinitie, and infallible truth of the Iewes scriptures, or old testament; which writinges we hauing receaued frō that Nation, that doth (as it were) professe enimitie against vs; & the same being writen so many ages before the name of Christianitie was knowen in the world: it can not bee but of singuler authoritie, what so euer shalbe alleaged out of those recordes for our purpose. And therfore as before, in prouing our first principle, that

there is a God, we vsed onlie the testimonie of such witnesses, as could not be partial: The vndoubted vvitnesses to be alleageà in this chapter. so muche more in this confirmation of Christian religion, shall we stande onlie, ether vpon the confessions of such as are our enimies; or vpon the recordes of others, who must needes be indifferent in the cause, for that they liued before ether cause or controuersie in Christianitie was knowen or called in question.
               My whole purpose shal be then, to make manifest in this chapter, that Iesus Christ The drifte of this chapter. was the Saueour and Redeemer of mankind, fore-promissed and expected from the beginning of the world; that he was the sonne of God, and God him self; and consequentelie, that what so euer he hath lefte vs in his doctrine and religion, is true and sincere, & the onlie waie of Saluation vpon earth. For clearer proof and declaration wherof, I will reduce what soeuer I haue to saye herein, vnto three The principal heades. principal heades or braunshes, according to th' order of three distincte tymes wherin they fell out: that is to saye; in the first place shal be considered, the thinges that  passed before the natiuitie or incarnation of Christ. In the seconde, the thinges dōne  and verified from that tyme vnto his ascension; which is the space of his aboode vpon earth. And in the third place, such euentes shalbe cōsidered, as ensued for cō
                  firmatiō 
                   of his deitie, after his departure.
               In declaration of which three general poinctes, I hope by th' asistance of hym

whose cause wee handle, that so many cleare demonstrations shalbe discouered; as shall greatelie cōfirme thie faith (gentle reader) and remoue all occasions of temptations to infidelitie.
               
                  Hovv Christ vvas fortolde to Ievve & Gētile. Sect. 1.
                  FIrst then, for such thinges as passed before Christ appeared in fleshe, and doe make for proofe of our Christian religion; it is to be noted, that they are of two sortes, or at least-wise, they are to be The Ievve and Gētile. taken from two kindes of people, that is, partelie from the Iewes, and partelie frō the Gentiles. For seing that Christ was appointed from the beginning, yea, before Ephes. 1. 1. Tim. 2. Tit. 1. 1. Pet. 1. the world was created, (as S. Paul affirmeth,) to worke the redemption both of Iewe and Gentile, and to make them both one people in the seruice of his father: herehēce it is, that he was fortold Esa. 2. 11. 19. Icrem. 9. 12. 16. and presignified to both thes Nations; & diuers forwarninges were left among them both, for stirring them vp to expect his comminge, as by the considerations following shall nost euidentelie appeare.
                  AND TO beginne with Iewes; no man can denie, but that throughout the whole THE. 1. consideration. THE Messias promissed. bodie and course of their scriptures, that is, from the verie beginning to the last ending of their old testament, they had promissed to thē a MESSIAS, which is the same thing that we call, CHRIST, that is to saye, a person annointed and sent from

God to be a Saueour, a Redeemer, a Pacifier of Gods wrath, a Mediatour betwene God and man, a Satisfyer for the sinnes & offences of the world, a Restorer of our innocencie lost in Paradise, a Master, an Instructour, a Lawgyuer, and finally, a spiritual and eternal king, that should sitt & rule and reigne in our hartes, to conquer the power and tyrannie of Satan, that ouer-came our first parentes, and assaileth vs daylie.
                  This is euident by the first couenant of 1. The first couenant to Adam. Gen. 2. all, that euer God did make with man, whē he said to Adā our first father in Paradise; In vvhat daye so euer thou shalt eate of the tree that is forbidden, thou shalt die. Which couenaunt being after broken, on the parte of our said progenitour: he receaued his iudgement; but yet with a most benigne promisse of redemptiō for the tyme to come: for thus God said to the deuil or serpent that had deceaued hym: The seede of the vvoman shal crushe thy head, & thou shalt lye in 
                     Gen. 3. 
                     vvayte to hurt his heele. That is, one shall proceede in tyme of the seede of the woman, who shall cōquer death & sinne (that are thy weapons,) and shall not care for thy tēptatiōs, but shall treade them vnder his feete, & this shal be Christ the Messias of the world. Thus did not onlie the Rabbi Mose. Ben maimon, in hunc locū. eldest Iewes and Rabbines vnderstād this place, (what so euer the latter haue dreamed, that there Messias should be only a tēporal kīg:) but also the old Chaldie paraphrase (named, Thargum Hierosolymitanum) expoūdeth

it plainlie ī thes wordes, applīed vnto the deuil that had deceaued Adam. They haue a 
                     Tharg. Hie. ros. in Gen. 3. 
                     certaine and present remedie against the (o deuil,) for that the tyme shall come, vvhen they shall treate the dovvne vvith their heeles, by the helpe of Messias vvhich shalbe their kinge.
                  
                  The same thing is confirmed by the verie same promise seuen tymes repeated and To Abraham and Isaac. established vnto Abraham, that liued verie neare two thousand yeares after Adam: and againe to Isaac his sonne after hym: In 
                           〈◊〉
                         tuo benedicentur omnes gentes terrae. 
                     Gen. 12. & 18. & 22. All nations of the earth shalbe blessed in thy seede. Which had bene in deede, but a verie small benediction to Abraham, or to other Iewes after hym, (that neuer saw this Messias actuallie,) if he had bene onlie to be a temporal king; And much lesse blessing had it bone to Gentiles and other nations, if this Messias of the Iewes, must haue bene a temporal and worldlie Monarche to destroye and subdue them to the seruitude of Iurie, as fondlie thes later teachers of that nation doe contende.
                  This yet maketh the Patriarche Iacob 3. Jacobs prophetie of Christ. Gen. 49. more plaine, who prophesing at his death of the comminge of Christ, hathe thes wordes: the scepter (or gouernment) shall not be taken from the house of Iuda, vntill be come that is to be sent, and he shal be the expectation of Nations. Which later wordes, the fornamed Tharg. Hie ros. & Onkelos in hunc locū. Chaldie paraphrase, as also great Onkelos, (both of singuler authoritie amōgest the Iewes,) doe interprete thus: Donee Christus seu Messias veniat, &c.
                     vntil Christ
or the Messias come, (which is the hope and expectation of all Nations, as well Gentiles as of vs that are Iewes;) the gouernment shall not ceasse in the house or tribe of Iuda. By which sentence of scripture, and interpretation of the Iewes thē selues, we come to learne, (besides the promisse for the Messias,) two cōsequences in this matter, against the Iewes of later tymes. First, that if their Messias must be The Messias must be a spiritual & not a temporal king. the hope and expectation as well of Gentiles as of Iewes: then can he not be a temporal kinge to destroye the Gentiles, (as the latter Iewes would haue it,) but a spiritual king to reigne ouer them, and to bring in subiection their spiritual enimies for them, (I meane the fleshe, world, and deuil,) as we Christians doe beloeue. Secondlie, if the temporal kingdome of the house of Iuda, (where of Christ must come) shall ceasse and be destroyed at the comming of Messias, (as this scripture auoucheth:) how then can the Iewes expect yet a temporal king for their Messias, as most fondlie they doe?
                  But to leaue this controuersie with the later Rabines, and to goe forward in declaration of that which we tooke in hand, that is, to shew howe Christ was fortolde & fore-promissed to the Iewes: it is to be noted, that after the death of Iacob last mentioned, there is litle recorded in scripture of the doinges of his people, during the fower hundred yeares of their bondoge in Egypt. But yet the tradition

of that Nation teacheth, that as soone as The tradition of the Ievves in Misdrasch Thehilim. they were deliuered out of Egypt, and were in the desert towardes the lande of promisse; the three sonnes of Chore, called Aser, Eleana, & Abiasaphe, (of whome there is mention in the sixth chapter of Exodus and other where;) made diuers songes and Psalmes, in the praise and expectation of the Messias to come; and that the holie men of that tyme, did solace thē selues with singing the same; and that king Dauid afterward in the second parte of his Psalmes, begining from the 41. vnto See the titles of thes psalmes. 41. 44 45. 46. 47 48. 82. 84 86. 87. the 87. gathered the most parte of those olde songes together, as yet they are to be seene in his psalter.
                  But Moyses, who liued with that people, & gouerned them in the wildernes, had a cleare reuelatiō from God of this Messias, in thes wordes. I vvill raise vp a Prophet to 
                     5. Moyses prophetie of Christ. Deut. 13.
                      
                     this people from amongest their brethren, euen as thy self; and I vvill putt my vvordes in his mouth, and he shal speak vnto them all thinges vvhich I shal ordaine vnto him: and he that shal refuse to heare the vvordes vvhich he shal speake vnto thē in my name; I vvill he reuenged vpon that man. Which wordes; that they can not be vnderstoode of anie other Prophet that euer liued after Moyses among the Iewes, but onlie of Christ; it appeareth plainelie by this testimonie of the holye ghoste. And 
                     Deut. 34 
                     were arose not anie other Prophet in Israel, like 
                     6. Dauids propheties of Christ. 
                     unto Moyses, &c.
                  
                  After Moyses about fower hundred yeares, ensued Dauid, whoe for that he

was a holie man, and the first king of the howse of Iuda, out of whose linage the Messias was to come: the particulers of this mysterie, were more abundantlie and manifestlie reueiled vnto hym, then vnto anie other. And first, for assurance that Christ should be borne of his stocke and linage, thes are the wordes of God vnto hym: I haue svvorne to Dauid my seruant: I vvil 
                     Psal. 88. 2. Reg. 7. 1. Para. 22 
                     prepare thie seed for eternitie, and vvill build vp thie seat to all generations. Which wordes, albeit the later Iewes will applie to king Salomon, that was Dauides sonne; (and in some sense they may so bee; for that Salomon was a figure of Christ to come:) yet properlie thes wordes, and his kingdome shal 
                     Psal. Reg. 5. 1. Para. 22 
                     stand for euer, and for all eternitie, which are so often repeated in this and other places of scripture; can not be verified in Salomō, whose earthelie kingdome was rent & torne in peeces straight after his death, 3. Reg. 12 by Ieroboam, and not longe after, as it were extinguished; but they must needes be vnderstoode of an eternal king, which should come of Dauids seede; as must also thes other wordes of God in the psalmes; Thou arte my sonne, this day haue I begotten the, 
                     Psal. 2. 45. 47. 67. 72. 
                     I vvill gyue vnto thee the Gentiles for thine inheritance. Which was neuer fulfilled in Salomon, nor in anie temporal king of Iurie after hym. And muche lesse thes wordes that follow: He shall endure vvith the sunne, 
                     Psal. y 1. 
                     and before the moone, from generation to generation. There shal rise vp in his dayes, peace, vntil the moone be taken avvay: he shal reigne from sea
                     
                     to sea, vnto the endes of the vvorld: All kinges shal adore hym, and all Nations shal serue hym: for that he shal deliuer the pooreman that had no helper; he shal saue their soules, and deliuer them from vsurie, and from iniquitie: all tribes of the earth shal be blessed in hym, and all Nations shal magnisie hym.
                  
                  Thes wordes of Christs eternal kingdome; of his enduring to the worlds ende; of his vniuersal raigne ouer Iew and Gentile; of his adoration by all Nations; of his deliuerie of soules from bondage of iniquitie; and finallie, of his making blessed all tribes of the earth: can not possiblie be applied to anie temporal kinge that euer was among the Iewes, or euer shalbe, but onlie to Christ.
                  This promisse made vnto Dauid for 7. Ieremies prophetie touching Christ. Ierem. 23 & 33. Christ to come of his seede, is repeated after his death by manie prophetes, and confirmed by God, as in Ieremie, where God vseth thes wordes: Behold, the dayes come on, and I vvill raise vp to Dauid a iust seede, and he shal reigne a kinge, and shal be vvise, and shal doe iudgement and iustice vpon earth. And in his dayes shal Iuda be saued, and Israel shal dvvel confidentlie, & this is the name that men shall call hym. OVR IVST GOD. All this was spoken of Dauids seede, aboue fower hundred yeares after Dauid was dead. Whiche proueth manifestlie that the former promisses and speeches, were not made to Dauide for Salomon, or for anie other temporal kinge of Dauids lyne, but for Christ, who was called so peculierlie the sonne and
                     
                     seede of Dauid, for that Dauid was the first king of the tribe of Iuda, and not onelie was Christs Progenitor in flesh, but also did beare his Type and Figure in manie other thinges.
                  For which cause likewise in the prophet Ezechiel (who lyued about the same 8. Ezechiels prophetie of Christ. tyme that Ieremie did,) the Messias is called by the name of Dauid hym self. For this God spake at that tyme, vnto Ezechiel. I vvil saue my slocke; nor shall they bee anie longer lest to the spoile. &c. I vvil raise ouer 
                     Ezec. 34. 
                     them, ONE PASTOR, vvhich shall seede them; my seruāt DAVID, he shal seede them; and he shal 
                     Christ is called Dauid. 
                     be their Shepheard, & Prince, and I vvill be their God, and vvil make vvith them a conenant of peace, &c. In which wordes, not onlie we Thalm. tract. Sanh. ca. helec. that are Christians, but the later Iewes also them selues doe confesse in their Thalmud, that Messias is called by the name of Dauid, for that he shall descende of the seede of Dauide; as by reason also it must needes be so, for that king Dauid being dead fower hundred yeares before thes wordes were spoken, (as hath bene noted;) could not now come againe, to feede gods people or gouerne them hym self.
                  Esay the prophet, who Iyued about a The propheties of Esay touchīg Christ. Esa. 2.
                      hundred yeares before Ieremie and Ezechiel, had maruelous for knowledge of the Meisias and his affaires, and describeth hym verie particulerlie, beginning i this maner. In the later dayes, the HILL of gods house, shall be prepared vpon the toppe of mountaines, and all Nations (or Gentiles) shal flovve vnto
                     
                     hym. And manie people shal say; come and lett vs ascende to the HILL of our Lord, & he shal teach vs his vvayes, and vve shall vvalke in his pathes: it shall iudge Nations. &c. Which verie Mich. 4. wordes are also repeated in Micheas the prophet, and are applied there, (as also here,) vnto the Messias, and can haue no other meaning, by the iudgement of the Iewes and Hebrues themselues. And Esay doth prosecute the same matter afterwardes, in diuers chapters. As for exāple, in the sowerth, talking of the same Messias, which before he calleth the HILL of Gods hovvse; he addeth thes wordes. In 
                     Esay. 4. v. 2. 
                     that daye, shall the issue of our Lorde, be in 
                           〈◊〉
                         and glorie; and the fruite of the earth, in 
                           〈◊〉
                        , and exultation, to all such as shal be saued of Israel. In which wordes, he calleth the Messias, both the issue of God, and the fruite of the earth, for that he should be both God and man. And in the nynthe chapter Esa. 9. v. 6. he calleth hym by thes termes: Admirable: Councelour: God: Stronge: Father of the future vvorld: and, Prince of Peace.
                  
                  In the eleuenth chapter, he describeth hym most wonderfullie in thes wordes; there shall goe soorth a bransh of the stock of Iesse, 
                     Esa. 11. v. 1. (whiche Iesse was Dauids father;) and out of the roote of that branche, there shall mounte 
                     Psal. 71. Ecclc. 45. 
                     up a flovver, and the spirite of our lord shall rest upon hym; the spirite of vvisdome and of vnderstanding; the spirit of councel and sortitude; the spirite of knovvledge and pietie: he shall not iudge 
                     VVōnderful properties of Christ. 
                     according to the sight of (fleshely) eyes, nor yet condemne according to the hearing of (fleshely)
                     
                     eares; but he shall iudge poore men in iustice, and shall dispute in equitie for the mylde men of the earth. He shal strike th' earth vvith the rodde of his mouth, and vvith the spirite of his lippes shall he flea the vvicked man. Iustice shall be the girdle of his loynes, & faith shall be the bande of his reines. &c. Hytherto are the wordes of the Prophet; wherin nothing trulie can be more plaine and euident, then that by the rodde or branche of Iesse, is meant the Virgine Math. 1. Luc. 3. Act. 13. Rom. 15. Marie, who directelie descended of the linage of Iesse; and by the flovver ascending from this branche, must needes be vnderstoode Christ, that was borne of her, & had all those excellences & priuileges aboue other mē, which Esay in this place, assigneth vnto hym.
                  Whose further graces yet, and speciall Other properties of Christ. Esa. 25. v. 8. diuine properties, the same Prophet expresseth more particulerlie in the chapters following, wher he sayeth: he shall for euer ouerthrovve and destroye death; he shal open the eyes of the blinde, and th' eares of the deafe; he shal not crie nor cōtēde, nor shal he accept the person of 
                     Esa. 35. v. 5. Esa. 42. v. 2. 
                     any man; but in truth shal he bring foorth iudgement. He shal not be sorrovvful nor turbulēt. &c. And finallie, in the fortie and ninthe chapter he alleageth the wordes of God the father vnto Christ, touching his commission in this sorte: it is too litle, that thou 
                     Esa. 49. v. 6. Act. 13. 47. 
                     be to me a seruant, to raise vp the tribes of Iacob, and to conuert vnto me the dregges of Israel. Behold, I haue appointed thee also for a light vnto 
                     The commission of Christ. 
                     the Gentiles, that thou he my saluation vnto the vttermost partes of all th' earth.
                  
                  
                     
And to conclude this matter, without alleaging more propheties for the same; 10. The prophetie of Daniel touchinge Christ. (which in truth are infinite throughout the Bible;) Daniel that liued in th' ende of the captiuitie of Babylon, a litle before Aggaeus, Zacharias and Malachias (who were the last Prophetes that euer florished amongest the Iewes, almost fiue hū
                     dred years before the natiuity of Christ:) this Daniel (I say) reporteth of hym self, that being in Babylon, and hauing fasted, worne heare-cloth, and prayed longe vnto God: there came the Angel Gabriel vnto hym, at the tyme of Euening sacrifice, and fortolde hym, not onlie of the deliuerance of the people of Israel from the captiuitie of Babylon out of hande, (for that the seuentie yeares of their punishement, fortolde by Ieremie, were now expired:) but also he tolde hym further, that the tyme of th' vniuersal deliuerance of mankinde, from the bondage and captiuitie of sinne; was now shortened, & that after seuentie hebdomades, (which, as shalbe shewed after, make vp iust the tyme that passed from the rebuilding of the temple of Ierusalem after their deliuerance from Babylon, vnto the birth of Christ:) there should be borne the Saueour of the world, and be putt to death for redemption of mankinde.
                  The Angels wordes are thes. I am come to shevv vnto thee, ô Daniel, for that thou art a 
                     Dan. 9. v. 23. 
                     man of goode desires. And therfore doe thou marke my speeche, & vnderstande this vision. The seuētie
                     
                     hebdomades are shortened upon thie people, and upon thie holie Cittie; to th' ende preuarication may be consumed, and sinne receyue an ende: to th' ende iniquitie maye be blotted out, and eternal iustice brought in her place: & to th' ende visiōs & propheties maye be fulfilled, and the SAINCTE OF SAINCTES annointed. Knovv thou therfore and marke, that from the ende of the speeche, for rebuilding of Ierusalem, vnto Christ the CAPTAINI; there shall chebdomades seuen, and hebdomades sixtie tvvo: and after sixtie tvvo hebdomades, Christ shalbe putt to death, and the people vvhich shall denie hym, shall not be his people.
                  
                  I might passe on futher to other Prophetes and propheties, and make no ende, if I would alleage what might be said in this behalfe; for that the whole scripture runneth all to this one pointe; to fortell and manifest Christ, by signes, figures, parables, The Butt of all scripture. and propheties; and for this cause was it principallie writē. But that which is alredie spoken, shall be sufficient for our first consideration, wherby is seene, that among the Iewes, from age to age, Christ was prophetied and fortolde, together with th' eternite of his kingedome that should be spiritual.
                  NOVV FOLLOVVETH there a second consideration of the qualitie of Christs THE. 2. Consideration. person, no lesse of importance then the former, and wherin the later Iewes doe THAT Christe should be God and man. more dissent from vs; and that is, of the God hode of the Messias promissed. I saye the later Iewes or Rabines are different herein from vs, as also they are in manie

other pointes and articles, wherin their ancestours (that were no Christians) did The custome of Heretikes. fullie agree. Euen as all Heretiques are wonte to doe, that first breake in one pointe, and then in an other from the Catholique faith; and so doe runne on, from one to one, makinge them selues in all thinges as dislike as they can, for hatred of that vnitie, wher vnto their pride will not suffer them to returne. So is it in the generation of this reprobate people, who first agreed with vs in al, or most pointes, touching Christ to come, & denied onlie the fulfilling or application therof, in Iesus our Saueour: But afterward, their vngratious ofspring, being not able to stāde in that issue against vs, deuised a new plea, and be tooke them selues to a farre higher degree of impietie, affirming, that we attributed manie thinges vnto Iesus, that were not fortolde of the Messias to come; and among other, that he should be God, and the sonne of God, and the second person in Trinitie, &c.
                  But herein (no doubt) thes obstinate and graceles men, doe shew them selues both ignorant of their owne scriptures, & disagreing from the writinges of their owne forefathers. For as for scriptures, it is euident by all or most of the propheties alleaged before, that Christ (or the Messias) That Christ must bee both God and man. Gen. 3. r. 15. must be God, and the sonne of God, indued with mans nature; that is, both ma & God. So ī Genesis, where he is called, the seede of the vvoman; it is apparent, that he

shalbe man; and in the same place, when he is promissed, to crushe the deuil and breake 
                     The. 1. proofe. Esa. 4. v. 2. 
                     his heade; who can doe this but onlie God? Likewise, when he is called Germen Iehouae, the seede of our Lord God; his Godhood is signified: as is his manhoode also, when in the same place he is named; the fruite of the earth. Who can interprete thes speeches; that his kingedome shall be euerlasting; That, he 
                     Esa. 9. Psal. 71. 
                     shall endure vntill the Moone be taken avvaye & after; That, God begate hym before Lucifer vvas created; That, no man can tell or recumpte his 
                     Psal. 109. 
                     generation; That, all Nations and Angels must 
                     Esa. 53. Psal. 96. Heb. 1. Psal. 110. 
                     adore hym; That, he must sitt at the right hand of God, and manie other such speeches pronounced directelie and expressie of the Messias; who (I say) can vnderstand or interprete them, but of God, seing that in man they can not be verified?
                  And as for the last of thes testimonies, concerning Christes sitting at his fathers right-hand: three of our Euangelistes doe Math. 2. Marc. 12. Luc. 20. reporte, that Iesus did blancke diuers of the learnedst pharisies with alleaging onlie thes wordes of Dauid: The 
                     Iehoua in Hebrne. Psal. 110. 
                     Lord said to my Lord, sitt at my right-hande, vntill I putt thie enimies as thy footest role. For, (said Iesus,) if Christ be Dauids sonne; how did Dauid call hym his Lord? signifying hereby, that albeit the Messias was to be Dauids sonne, according to his manhode: Rab. Ionath. lib. collect. & Misdrasch. Tehilim in psal. 2. v. 7. yet was he to be Dauids Lord, according to his God head. And so doe both Rabbi Ionathan, and the publique commentaries of the hebrues, interprete the place.
                  
                     
Micheas is plaine; And thou Bethleem; 
                     The. 2. prose. Mich. 5. 
                     out of the, shall proceede a RVLER in Israel; & his going foorth, is from the beginning, and from the dayes of eternitie. This can not be vnderstood of any mortal man, that euer was or shalbe. But yet Esay goeth further whē he saith. A litle childe is borne vnto vs, and a yonge sonne is gyuen vnto vs, and his principalitie is vpon his ovvne shoulder, and his name shalbe 
                     Esa. 9. GOD; the father of the future vvorld (So is it in the hebrue. 
                     or of eternitie;) the Prince of peace, &c. In which wordes, we see that Christ is called God. But if the Iew doe cauil here & saye, that El, or Elohim, the hebrue wordes, which we An obiectiō ansvvsred. Exod. 15. v. 11. interprete God i this place, may some tyme be applied to a creature, (as in Exodus once El signifieth an Angel, and Elohim at othertymes, is applied to Iudges:) then marke and consider this discourse of Dauid touchinge the Meisias, to whom he saith; Thou art beautiful in forme aboue the children 
                     Psal. 44. 
                     of men; grace is spred in thie lippes, and therfore hath God blessed thee for euer, &c. Thie seate ò God, is for euer and euer; the rodde (or scepter) of thie kingedome, is the rodde of direction: thou hast loued iustice and hated iniquitie; therfore o God, thie God hath annointed thee vvith oyle of ioye aboue thie partners. Here the Messias is called God twice, by the same worde Elohim, as God his father is; and therfore as the worde signifieth true God in th' one, so must it also in th' other.
                  But to remoue all grounde of this refuge The. 3. proofe. touching El, & Elohim, that are names of God, whiche may be communicated

some tymes and vpon some occasions to Creatures: most apparent it is, that the name IEHOVA, which is called, Tetagrammation, and which is so peculiar to God Christ is called Iehoua. alone, as neuer it maye be cōmunicated to other: this name (I saye) which is of such reuerence among the Iewes, as they daie not pronounce it, but in place therof, doe reade Adonai, that signifieth Lorde: is euerie where almost in scripture, attributed to Christ, See Esa. cap. 18. v. 7. & cap. 28. v. 5. namelie where the latine interpretour hath trāslated, Lord: as for exāple, in two diuers places of Ieremie, after the longe description of the Messias, which before I haue recited; he concludeth thus: hoc est nomen quod vocabunt eum, Iehoua iustus noster, this is the name which they shall Iere. 23. v. 7. & ca. 33. v. 16. call hym OVR IVST IEHOVA, or as the Hebrue hath word for word, Iehoua our iustice. And so do the auncient hebrue expositours Rab. Abba coment in Thren. v. 16 confesse vpon thes places of Ieremie, namly Rabbi Abba, who asketh the question what Messias shalbe called? and then he answereth out of this last place; he shalbe called th' eternal Iehoua. The like Misd. Thehilim in Psal. 20 v. 1 doth Misdrasche gathervpō the 20. Plasme, and Rab. Moses Hadarsan expounding a place of the Prophet Sophonie cap. 3. v. Rab. Mos. Hadars. in Gen. ca. 41. 9. concludeth thus: in this place Iehoua signifieth nothing els but the Messias.
                  
                  Wherby appeareth, that as well in scripture, as also in th' opinion of olde hebrue expositours, the Messias was to be true God and man. And I might allea ge manie other testimonies of auncient Rabbines,

if it were not to long: especiallie, if I would enter among that kinde of expositours, whom they call Cabalistes, (who Tvvo sortes of Hebrue expositours, Cabalistes and Thalmudistes. are more auncient and lesse brutishe then are th' other sorte, which are termed Thalmudistes,) I should finde many cleare and manifest declarations against the Iewes doctrine and errour of later tymes. And among other, (for example onlie of Cabalistical expositions,) I referre the reader to the discourse of Rabbi Hacadosch (which in Hebrue signifieth the holie Rabbine, & liued not longe after Christ,) Iere. 23. v. 7. vpon the words of Ieremie before recited; in which, for that he findeth the Messias to be called Iehoua, which word in hebrue is compounded of the three letters Iod, and Vau, and He twise repeated: this doctor maketh his discourse by arte Cabalist in this maner.
                  
                     Euen as (sayeth he) the letter He in Iehoua, is compounded of two other letters named Daleth and Vau, (as appeareth by their forme:) so shall the Messias (that Rab. Hacadosch. in ca. 9. Esa. is signified by this word Iehoua,) be made of two natures, th' one diuine, & th' other humane. And as in Iehoua, there is twise A Cabalistical discourse. 
                        He, and consequentelie two Daleths and two vaus conteined therin: so are there two birthes, filiations, or chyldehodes in Messias; th' one, wherby he shalbe the sōne of God, and th' other wherby he shalbe the sonne of a virgine, which Esay calleth Esa. 8. the Prophetise. And as in Iehoua the letter He is twise putt, & yet both Hes doe make

in effect but one letter: so in Messias there shalbe two distinct natures, and yet shall they make but one Christ. Thus playeth this Cabaliste vpon the letters of Iehoua (according to the maner of their diuinitie,) and draweth great mysteries (as ye see) from letters endes. In which kinde of reasoning, albeit we putt no grounde or strength at all: yet is it sufficient to shew, that amōg th' elder Iewes it was a knowē and confessed doctrine, that Christ should be both God and man, and haue two natures conioyned distinctelie in one person, which is the same that we Christians doe affirme.
                  Nay, I will adde further (and this is The. 4. proofe. greatly to be obserued;) that the self same aūcient Iewes (as some also of the later) doe holde, & proue by scripture; that christ shalbe (for alwayes they speake of the Messias to come,) the verie sonne of God, & verbum Dei incarnatum, and the worde of Christ called the sonne of God. God incarnate, or made fleshe. And for the first, that he shall be the sōne of God; they proue it out of diuers places alleaged by me before: as for example; out of Genesis, wher the latine texte hath; the scepter of Iuda shall not be taken avvaye; vntil he come, 
                     Gen. 49. v. 10. Rab. Dauid Kimhi in l. radicum. 
                     that is to be sent: the Hebrue hath, vntil Silo come; which Silo; Rabbi Kimhi proueth by a longe discourse, to signifie so much, as siliꝰ eiꝰ, his sonne; that is, the sonne of God. The same they proue by the place of Esay, wher the Messias is called, germen Iehoua, 
                     Esa. 4. v. 2 the seede or sonne of Iehoua. Which the

Chaldaye Paraphrase turneth, the Messias of Iehoua. They proue the same also, out of Tharg. in hunc loca. diuers Psalmes wher Christ is called plailie the sonne of God; as where it is said: he 
                     Psal. 49. 
                     shall saye vnto me, thou art my father, &c. I vvill put hym, my eldest sonne, more higher then all the kinges of th' earth. &c. Iehoua said vnto me, thou art my sonne, this daye haue I begotten thee. &c. Kisse the 
                     This is according to the Hebrue text. Iere. 17. 
                     sonne ye kinges and iudges of the earth, 
                     Psal. 2. 
                     and happie are all they, that place their hope in hym. Which last words, can no waye be vnderstoode of the sonne of anie man, for that it is writen, cursed is the man, that putteth his trust in man. Wherfore Rabbi Ionathan, Rabbi Nathan, Rabbi Selomoth, Aben Ezra, and others, doe conclude by thes and other places which they alleage, that the Messias must be the verie sonne of God.
                  And for the second pointe, they goe The. 5. proofe. yet further, affirming, this sonne to be verbum patris, the word of God the father. Which the forsaid Ionathan in his Chaldaye Paraphrase doth expresse in many translations: as for example; wher Esay Christ the vvorde incarnate. sayeth, Israel shalbe saued in Iehoua vvith eternal saluation, (which Iehoua signifieth Christ, as all men confesse;) In the chaldaye paraphrase. Osee. 1. Ionathan turneth it thus: Israel shalbe saued by Gods 
                     Esa. 45. v. 17. 
                     vvord. So againe, wher God saith by Osee; I vvil saue the house of Iuda by Jehoua their God; (which is by Christ:) Ionathā trāstateth it thus: I vvill saue Iuda by the vvorde of their God. In like maner; wher Dauid writeth, Iehoua said to my Lord, sitt at my righte 
                     Psal: 11 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                     
                     
                     hand. &c. Ionathā expresseth it thus: Iehoua said vnto his vvorde, sit at my right hand. So Rabbi Isaac Arama writing vpon Genesis, Rab. Isaac. com. in cap. 47. Gen. Psal. 106. v. 20. R. Simeon. Ben. Iohai. com. in cap. 10. Gen. Iob. 19. v. 26. expoundeth this verse of the psalme, he sent his vvorde and healed them, &c. to be meát of Messias, that shalbe Gods worde. And Rabbi Simeon the chief of all the Cabalistes, vpon those wordes of Iob, I shall see God in my flesh, gatheretn, that the worde of God shall take flesh in a womans bellie. So that this doctrine was nothing straunge among th' auncient Rabines.
                  For further confirmation wherof also, (seing the matter is of so greate importance,) consider what is recorded in a R. Simeon in Zohar. treatise called Zoar, of highe authoritie amonge the Iewes, where Rabbi Simeon that was last before alleaged, citeth a place oute of olde Rabbi Ibba, vpon thes wordes in Deuteronomie, Iehoua our Lord, is one Iehoua. Which wordes the said auncient Dcut. 6. v. 4. Rabbi Ibba interpreteth thus: by the first Iehoua in this sentence, (being th' incommunicable name of God,) is signified The blessed Trinitie proued by an auncient Rabbine. (sayeth he) God the father, prince of all thinges. By the next wordes, (our Lorde,) is signified God the sonne, that is fountaine of all sciences. And by the second Iehoua in the same sentence, is signified God the holie Ghost, prooceeding of them both. To all whiche is there added the word (One,) to signifie, that thes three are indiuisible. But this secrete shall not be reueiled vntill the comming of Messias. Hytherto are the wordes of Rabbi

Ibba, reported in Zohar by Rabbi Simeō; where also the said Rabbi Simeon interpreteth thes wordes of Esay, Holie, Holie, Holie, Lord God of Sabaoth, in this maner. Esa. by repeating three tymes holie, (saith he) doth as much as if he had saide. Holie father, holie sonne, and holie spirit, which three holies, doe make but one onlie Lord God of Sabaoth.
                  
                  Finallte, I will conclude this controuersie The. 6. proose. betwene the later Iewes and vs, with th' authoritie of learned Philo, who liued in the verie same tyme with Christ, and was sent Embassadour twise to Rome Philo lib. 2. legat. Ruff. l. 1. hist. 1. 6. Euscb. in Chion. in the behalf of his Nation in Alexādria; that is, first in the. 15. yeare of Tyberius th' Emperour, (which was three yeares before Christes passion, and the very same yeare wherin he was baptised by S. Iohn:) and the second tyme about eight yeares after, to witt, in the first of the reigne of Caligula. This man, that was the learnedst that euer wrote among the Iewes, after the writers of holie scripture ceased; made a special booke of the banishment of his countrimen, where he hath this discourse insueing.
                  What tyme maye be appointed (saith Philo li. de exulibus. he, for the returne home of vs baninshed Iewes; it is hard to determine. For by tradition we haue, that we must expect the death of a high priest. But of those, some die quickelie, and some liue longer. But I am of opiniō, that this high priest shalbe, the verie worde of God. Whiche shalbe

voide of all sinne, both voluntarie and involuntarie; whose father shalbe God, and this worde shalbe that fathers wisdome, by which all thinges in this world-were created. His head shalbe annointed with oyle, & his kingedome shall florishe & shine for euer.
                    This wrote Philo at that tyme, whē he litle imagined, that the same high priest, whom he so much expected, and the same worde of God, whose kingdom he describeth, was now alredie come into the world. And this shal suffice for our second consideration, what maner of Messias the Iewes did expect.
                  NOVV IN THE third place commeth THE. 3. Consideration. VVHEther Christ shoulde change the lavve of Moyses. Gal. 3. & 4. Heb. 7. it to be considered, what authoritie and power the Messias should haue at his appearance vpon earth, and whether he should change and abrogate the lawe of Moyfes or no? wherin there is no lesse controuersie betwene vs and the later Iewes, then in the former pointe of his diuinitie. For we holde with S. Paul, that the lawe of Moises was gyuen vnto the Iewes but for a tyme, to entertaine that people withall, and by th' outward signes 1. Cor. 10 & ceremonies which it had, (wherof the most parte, or all, prefigured Christ to come;) to be their schoolmaster & leader to the tymes of faith, wherin it should be abrogated, and a farre more perfect law sett downe by Christ in place therof. The lavve of Moyses imperfect. Heb. 7.
                  
                  This we proue first, for that the law of Moyses was an imperfecte law, bringing nothing to perfection, as S. Paul well noteth.

It was (as S. Peter saith) a burdensome law, which the Iewes them selues Act. 15. were not able to beare, for the multitudo of ceremonies therin contained. It was a carnal and seruile law, consisting most in th' external. It was a law of terrour and feare, more then of loue and libertie Gal. 3. of spirit. It was a law (as I said before) of signes and figures for thinges to come, & consequentelie to cease, when those thinges which it prefigured, should come to be present. It was a law peculier and properfor Deut. 15. the Iewes alone, without respect of all the rest of the world; and th' excercise therof was allowed onlie in the coū
                     trie Deut. 13. & 14. Leu. 5. & 23. Exo. 23. Deut. 27. of Iurie; & that which is more, it was not pmitted, but ī one place onlie of that countrie, that is, in Hierusalem, whether euerie mā was boūd to repaire thre tymes a yeare, to witt, at the Pasqua, at the Pētecoste, & at the feaste of Tabernacles; & in that place alone, to make their sacrifices, & in no other countrie or place besides.
                  Now then reasoneth the learned Diuine; Good reasones. if this law of Moyses were for the Iewes and Iurie onlie: how could it serue for the tyme of the Messias, who was to be kinge, as well of the Gentiles, as of the Iewes; & to rule all people in the world Psal. 2. 21. 26 Esa. 2. 11. 19. that should beleeue in hym, vnder one law? If th' excercise of this law, were allowable onlie, and lauful in Hierusalemt how coulde it possiblie bee fulfilled by Christians, that are dispersed ouer all the world? As for example; how could they

repaīre to Hierusalem thrise euerie yeare? how could euerie woman that should dwell in England or India, repaire to Hierusalem for her purification after Leuit. 12. Exod. 13. Num. 8. euerie childebirth, as by the law she was commāded? Most euident it is then, which we said before, that this law was gyuen but to idure for a tyme. And to vse S. Pauls owne wordes, it was but, introductio melioris 
                     Heb. 7. 
                     spci, an introduction to a better hope. It was but an entertainement of that people, (which by their being amōg th' Egyptians were prone to idolatrie,) vntill Christ should come and ordaine a perfect law. That is, a law of spirit and internal The nevv lavve of Christ and the perfectiōs therof. affection: a law of loue and libertie: a law that should be common to all men, serue for all countries, tymes, places, and persons: a law that should be writen in the bowels of our hartes: a law that should be tollerable, easie, sweet, plaine, light, brief, and factible, as well to the poore as to the riche: a law (to conclude) that should consist in charitie.
                  This signified Moyses, when he said to his people, after he had deliuered the former law vnto them: your Lord shall raise vnto you a Prophet of your ovvne Nation, and 
                     Deut. 18. 
                     from among your ovvne brethren, as my self: hym shall you heare. As though he had said; you shall heare me but vntill he come, that must be a law gyuer as my self; but yet of a more perfect law; and therfore more to be heard and obeyed. And then he addeth; vvho so euer shall refuse to heare the vvords of
                     
                     this Prophet, I my self vvill reuenge it, sayeth our Lord God. Which wordes can not be verified in anie other Prophet after Moyses vntill Christ; for that of those Prophetes the scripture sayeth, there arose no 
                     Deut. 34. 
                     Prophet like vnto Moyses in israel. Which is to be vnderstoode, that they had no authoritie to be Lawmakers as Moyses had, but were all bounde to th' obseruation of that law onlie which Moyses left, vntill Christ came, whom Moyses here calleth a Prophet as hym self, that is, a Lawmaker, & exhorteth all men to heare & obey hym.
                  This yet is made more plaine by the prophetie of Esay, who sayeth; out of Sion 
                     Esa. 2. 
                     shall come a lavve, and the vvorde of God out of Hierusalem. Which can not be vnderstood of Moyses law, that had bene published A nevv lavv prophetied. 800. yeares before this was spoken, and that, from the mount Sinai, and not from Sion: but Christs law began from Sion and Hierusalem, and from thence was spred into all the world. Which the same Esay forsawe when talking of the comming of Messias, he sayeth. In that daye there 
                     Esa. 15. 
                     shalbe an Aulter to God, in the middest of the lād of Egypt. And the title of our Lord at the ende therof, &c. and God shalbe knovven to the Egytians at that daye, and they shall honour hym vvith sacrifices and oblations. Which wordes could not be verified i th' old law of Moyses, for that by that law th' Egyptiās could haue neither aulter nor sacrifice; but at Christes comming it was fulfilled, when th' Egyptians were made Christians, and

enioyed both th' Aulters & sacrifices that Christians doe vse.
                  The same thing was fortolde by God in Malachie, wher he sayeth to the Iewes and of the Iuishe sacrifices. I have no pleasure 
                     Malac. 1. 
                     in you, neither vvill I receyne oblations at your handes. For that from th' vprising of the 
                     The reprobation of th' old lavv vvith a promisse of a nevv. 
                     sunne, vnto the going dovvne therof, my name is great among the Gentiles, and they doe sacrifice vnto me euerie vvher, and doe offer vnto my name a pure oblation, saith the Lord God of hostes. In which worlds we see first, a reprobation of the Iuishe sacrifice, and consequentlie, of the law of Moyses, which depended principallie of that sacrifice. Secondlie we see, that among the Gentiles, there should be a pure maner of sacrifice, more gratefull vnto God, then th' other was, and such, as might be perfourmed in euerie place of the world, and not be tied to one place onlie, as the Mosaical law and sacrifice was.
                  And finallie, I will conclude this whole matter, with th' expresse wordes of God hym self, concerning the ceremonies and preceptes of the olde law. Dedreis praecepta 
                     Ezec. 20. 
                     non bona, & iudicia in quibus non viuent. I gaue vnto them preceptes that were not good, and iudgementes wherin they shall not lyue. That is, they were not good to continue perpetuallie, nor shall they lyue in them for euer, but vntill the tyme by me appointed; of which tyme, he determineth more particulerlie by Ieremie the Iere. 3. prophet, in thes wordes. Beholde the dayes
                     
                     shall come, and I vvil make a nevv Couenant or Testament vvith the house of Israel and Iuda: 
                     A nevv Testament promissed. 
                     not according to that Couenant, vvhich I made vvith your fathers, vvhēn brought them foorth of the land of Egypt. Where you see, that at the comming of Christ into this world, (for of hym and his birth, he talketh at large in all this chapter;) there shalbe a new Testament, conteining a different law from that of th' old testament, which was giuen to the Iewes at their going foorth of Egypt.
                  Thus much then hytherto hath bene The summe of that vvhiche hathe bene said. shewed, that Christ in all ages was fortolde & promissed: that he should be God: and that his authoritie should be to chāge the law of Moyses, (that was gyuen but for a tyme,) and to establishe a new law, and Couenant, & a new Testament of his owne, that should endure and continue for euer.
                  
                     AND ALBEIT thes thinges be THE 4. Consideration. AL PARticulers fortolde of Christ. very wounderfull, and sufficient to establishe any mans beliefe in the world, whē he shall see them fulfilled, (which shalbe th' argument of my second Section:) yet resteth not the scripture here, but passeth further, and fortelleth euerie particuler acte, accident, and circumstance, that shall fall oute of importance aboute the Messias in his comming, incarnation, birthe, life, death, and resurrection. As for example; at what particuler tyme and season he should appeare. Gen. 49. v 10. Dan. 9. v. 26. Math. 1. v. 26. That he should be borne of a virgine.

                     Esay 7. v. 14. That the place of his birth should be the Toune of Bethleē. Mic. 5. v. 1. Luc. 2. v. 21. Mat. 2. v. 16. Mat. 2. That at his birth all the infantes rounde about Bethleem should be slaine for his sake. Ierem. 31. v. 15. That the kinges of the easte, should come and adore hym, and offer gold, and other giftes vnto hym. Psal. 71. v. 10. That he should be presented by his mother in the Temple of Hierusalem. Malach. 
                     Luc. 2. 3. v. 1. That he should flee into Egypt, and be recalled thence againe. Osee 11. v. 2. Esa. 19. v. 1. That Iohn Baptiste should goe before hym and crie in the desert. Esa. 40. v. 3. Malach. 3. v. 1.
                  After this, that he should beginne his owne preaching with all humilitie, quietnes, Mat. 5. and clemencie of spirit. Esa. 42. v. 2. That he should doe straunge miracles and heale all diseases. Esa. 29. v. 8. & 35. v. 5. & 
                     Mat. 4. & 8. Marc. 8. 61. v. 1. That he should die for the sinnes of all the world. Esa. 53. Dan. 26. That he should be betrayed by his owne disciple. Mat. 27. 
                     Psal. 40. v. 10. & 54. v. 14. & 108. v. 8. That he should be solde for thirty peeces of siluer. Mat. 16. Mat. 27. 
                     Zach. 11. v. 12. That with those thirtie peeces there should be bought afterward a field of Potshards Jerem. 30. That he should ride into Hierusalem vpon an asse before Mat, 21. 7. his passion. Zacha. 9. v. 9. That the Iewes should beate and buffet his face, and defile the same with spitting vpon hym. Esa. 50. Mat. 26. 67. 
                     v. 6. That they should whippe, and teare, and rent his bodie before they putt hym to death. Esa. 53. v. 2. Psal. 37. v. 18. That they should putt hym to death among thieues Luc. 22.
                     
and male factours. Esa. 53. v. 12. That they should gyue hym vineager to drinke, deuide Mat. 27. his apparel, and cast lottes for his vpper garment. Psal. 68. v. 22. & 21. v. 19. That Mat. 28. he should rise againe frō death the third daye. Psal. 15. v. 19. Osee. 6. v. 3. That he should ascende to heauen, and sitt at the right Luc. 24. Act. 7. hande of God his father for euer. Psal. 67. v. 19. & 109. v. 1.
                  All thes particularites and a number more, were reueiled in scripture touching the Messias, some fower thousand years, some two thousand, some a thousand, and the last of all, aboue fower hūdred yeares before Christ was borne. Which if we laye together, and doe consider withal, how exactelie they were fulfilled afterward in the person of Iesus, as in the next section shalbe declared: if we adde also to this, that we haue receyued thes prophesies and predictions, from a Nation that most of all other doth hate vs, and that the same are to be seene and reade in their Bibles, euen worde for word as they are in ours: if you holde in memorie also, what inuincible proofes were alleaged before in the second chapter, for th' infallible truth & certaintie of those Hebrue scriptures: you shall fynde, that hardlie, anye thing can be imagined for manifestation of a truth, before it come to passe, which God hath not obserued in forshewing the Messias. THE. 5. Consideration.
                  
                  
                     AND ALL THES cōsiderations are touchinge the Iewes. There remaineth

some what to be said of the Gētiles. Who MANIFEstation of Christ to the Gētiles. albeit they were to receyue their principal knowledge in this affaire from the Iuishe Nation, to whom the Messias was first and principallie promissed, and from whom the Gentiles had to expecte both their Saue our and his Apostles; as also the scriptures for testimonie and witnesse of them both; and finally all their certaine knowledge and sounde vnderstanding in the mysteries of Christ: Yet had they also among them selues, some kynde of notice and forwarning in this matter, whiche being ioyned with that, whiche I haue set downe before of the Iewes, and examined at the light of Gods diuine propheties before alleaged: it will make verie muche for confirmation of our Christian veritie. And therfore this last consideration, shalbe of the fore-knowledge of Gentiles in this behalf.
                  For better vnderstanding wherof; it is to be noted, that besides all knowledge of the Messias, that diuers Gentiles might haue by the Hebrue scriptures, whiche (Chap. 1. as I haue shewed before,) were in the Greeke language, diuers ages before Christ was borne: or by th' instruction & conuersation of Iewes, with whom manie Pagans did liue familiarlie: there remained Three peculiare vvayes vvherby Gentyles mighth care of Cbrist. three wayes peculier to Gentiles, wherby they receyued some vnderstanding & forwarning of this great mysterie. The first was, by tradition and writinges of their auncestours. The second, by propheties

of their owne. The third, by admonishement of their Idoles & Oracles, especiallie when the tyme of Christes appearance drew neare.
                  And for the first way, it is euident, that The first vvaye. as the Iewes receyued diuers thinges by succession from their forfathers; & they againe from Moyses; & Moyses from the Patriarches, Iacob, Isaac, and Abraham, (who was the first man, from whom that whole natiō proceeded, and in whō they were distinguished from all other people in the world:) so had the Gētiles & other Natiōs their succession also of doctrine & Traditiō of learninge amonge Ievves and Gentiles. monumētes, euen from the beginning; albeit the lower they went, the more corrupt they were, and more obscured in diuine knowledge, by their excercise ī idolat ie. So wee know that the Romans had their learning from the Grecians; & the Graecians frō th' Egyptians; th' Egyptians, from the Chaldaeans, who were the first people that receyued instruction in diuine matters from Adam, Methusalem, Noe, & others of those first and auncient fathers.
                  Now then it is to be considered, that Euseb. in Chron. by consent of writers, there were three famous men that liued together in those auncient times; to witt; Abraham, (who Abrahā. Iob. Zoroastres. descending from HEBER, was the father and beginner of the Iewes or Hebrues:) And wth hym, Iob, and one Zoroastres, that were not of that linage of Heber, but as we call them for distinctiōs sake, either heathens or Gentiles, albeit that difference

was not then in vre. And of Iob, we know by the testimonie of his booke, that he was a most holie and vertuous mā. Of Zoroastres, we know onlie, that he was greatelie learned, and left monumētes therof vnto his posteritie.
                  This Zoroastres, liuing in Abrahams time, might by accompt of scripture, see or speake with Noe. For that Abraham was borne aboue three skore yeares before Noe disceassed. And Noe was borne aboue fyue hundreth yeares before Methusalem dyed; which Methusalem, had lyued two hundred and fortie yeares with our first father Adam, that had enioyed conuersatiō both with God & Angels. And therby (no doubt,) could tell many highe and secrete mysteries, especiallie touchinge Christ, in whom all his hope for redemption of his posteritie, did consist. Which mysteries & hidden knowledge, it is not vnlike, but that Abrahā, Iob, Zoroastres, and others, who lyued at that tyme with them, might recevue at the third hand, by Noe and his children, I meane The Ievves haue a tradition, that Abraham serued Sem. 15. yeares in 
                           〈◊〉
                        . Sem, Cham, and Iaphet who had lyued before the Fludde, and had seene Methusalem, which Methusalem lyued (as I sayed,) so many yeares with Adam.
                  Herehence it is, that in the writinges of Zoroastres which are yet exstant, See Clem. Alex. lib. 1. strom. & Orig. l. 6. con. Celsu. & Procl. l. 2. & in Part. Plaltonis. or recorded by other authours in his name, there are founde verie many plaine speches of the sonne of God, whom he calleth, Secundam mentem, the second mynde.

And muche more is it to be seene in the writinges of Hermes Trismegistus, (who lyued after in Egypt, & receyued his learninge from this Zoroastres;) that thes Trisinegistus. first heathen philosophers had manifest vnderstanding of this second person in Trinitie, whom Hermes calleth; the first begotten sonne of God; his onlie sonne; his deare, eternal, immutable, & incorruptible sonne; vvho. 
                     Mercurius Herm. in Paemād c. L & deiceps. 
                     Sacred name is inessable: thos are his wordes. And after hym againe among the Graecians, were Orphens, Hesiedus, & others, that vttered the like specches of the sonne of God; as also did the Platonistes, whose Graecians. wordes and sentences were to longe to repeate in this place. But he that will see them gathered together at large, lett hym reade either Origen against Celsus the heathen, or els S. Cyril in his first booke against Iulian th Apostata. And this shall suffice for this first way, wherby the Gentiles had vnderstanding of Christ.
                  For the second thing which I mentioned, it is to be vnderstoode, that amonge the Gētiles, there were certaine prophetisses or women prophetes, called Sibyllae; 
                     The propheties touching Christ among the Gentiles. which in the greeke tongue (as Lactantius gathereth,) maye signifie so much, as either Councelours to God, or Reutilours of Gods Councel. And thes women being endued (as it seemeth) with a certaine spirit Lact. lib. 1. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . instit. cap. 6. of prophetie, did vtter from tyme to tyme, (though in such termes as most Gē
                     tiles vnderstoode them not;) most wonderful particularities of Christ to come,

agreīg (as it were) wholie, with the prophetes of Israel, or rather setting downe Of the Sibylles. manie thinges in much more plaine and euident speeche, then did th' other: th' one of them beginning her greeke meerer in thes verie wordes: knovv thie God, vvhich is the sonne of God, &c. An other of thē maketh a whole discourse of Christ in greeke verses called Accrostichi; for that the begī
                     ning Lact. lib. 4. instit. ca. 6. of euerie verse, is by some letter appointed in order, foorth of some one sentēce, that runneth through the whole. As for example; the sentence that passed throughe the beginning of those verses whiche now we talke of, was this. S. Augustine translateth al the verses. l. 18. de Ciuitat. Dei ca. 23. 
                     Iesus, Christ, Sonne of God, Saueour, Crosse. And there were so manie verses in the whole discourse, as there are letters in this sentēce. The total argumēt beīg, of the incarnatiō, life, death, glorie, and iudgement of the sonne of God. And the last two verses of all the meeter, are thes; He that hath bene here described by our Accrossike verses; is an immortale Saueour, and a Kynge, that must suffer for our sinnes.
                  
                  And for that thes propheties of the Sibylls, are of marueilous importāce to cō
                     firme the veritie of our Christian religiō; and are alleaged oftē for that purpose, by The greek verses of the Sibylles, of vvhat importance and authoritie. the most graue & learnedst fathers of our primatiue churche: as for example; by Iustinꝰ the martyr, in his apologie for Christians; by Origen, against Celsus; by Arnobius, and his scholler Lactātius, against Gentiles; by S. Cyril, against Iulian th' apostata;

by S. Augustine, in his Cittie of God; by Eusebius, and Constantine th' Emperour, and others: I will say somewhat. in this place, for th' authoritie and credite of thes verses, least anie man perhappes might imagine, (as some Gentiles in olde tyme would seeme to doe:) that they were deuised or inuented by Christians. And the most of my proofes, shall be out of a learned See this Oration in Eusebius l. 4. ca. 32. de vita Constantini. at the onde. oration, writen in latine by the foresaid Emperour, to a Councel of Prelates in his dayes; wherein he indeuoureth to shew, the vndoubted authoritie of thes Sibyll propheties, which he esteemed so much (after diligent search made for their credite and sinceritie;) as they seeme to haue bene a great cause of his constant zele and feruour in Christianitie.
                  First then he sheweth, that thes predictiōs of the Sibylles, could not be deuised or seigned by Christians, or made after The. I. proof sop credit of the Sibylverses. Varro lib. de rebus diuin. ad C. Caesarem. pont. max. the tyme of Christes natiuicie; for that Marcus varro, a wost learned Romā, who liued almost a hundrethe yeares before Christ, maketh mention at large of thes Sibylles, (who in number he saith were ten,) and of their writinges, countries, & ages: as also of the writers or authours, that before his tyme, had left memorie of them. And both he and Fenestella, (an other heathé,) doe affirme, that the writinges of thes Sibilles, were gathered by the Romans from al partes of the world, Fenest. c2. de 15. viria (wher they might be heard of,) and layed vp with diligence, and great reuerence

in the Capitole, vnder the charge and custodie of the highe priestes and other Officers, in such sorte, as no man might see or reade them, but onlie certaine Magistrates called the, Fistine, and muche lesie might any man come to falsifie or corrupt them.
                  Secondlie he sheweth, that Sibylla Erythraea, who made the former Acrostike verses of Christ, restisicth of her self, that The. 2. proofe. she liued about 600. years after the fludde of Noe, and her countriman Apollidorus Erythraeus and Varro doe reporte, that she liued before the warre of Troie, & pro phetied to the Graecians that went to that warre, that Troie should be taken. Which was more then a thousand years before Lact. l. 1. instit. cap. 6. Christ was borne. Cicero also, that was slaine more then fortye yeares before Christs natiuitie; translated into Latine, Cicero. the former See Cicero of this Acrostike verses of Sibylla, l. 2. de diuinatione. Acrostike verses, as Constantine sayeth, which translation was to be seene in his workes, when Constantine wrote this oration; so that by no meanes they could be deuised or brought in by Christians.
                  Thirdlie he sheweth, that the same Cicero, The. 3. proofe. in diuers places of his workes, besids the mention of these Acrostike verses, insinuateth also an other prophetie of Sibylla, touching a king that should rise ouer all the world, wherwith hym self and the Romans were greatlie troubled: and therfore in one place, after a longe inuectiue against his enimie Antonie, that would seeme to gyue credit to that

prophetie; or rather as Cicero doth vrge against hym, would haue had the same fulfilled in Iulius Caesar: he concludeth thus: lett vs deale vvith the prelates of our religion, to 
                     Cicero l: 2. de diuin. paule post medium. 
                     alleage onle one thing rather out of the bookes of Sibylla, then a KINGE, vvhom nether the Gods nor yet men, came suffer hereafter to be in Rome.
                  
                  The like prophetie of Sibylla touching Cic. l. 1. ep. fam. ep. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 
                     a king, is insinuated by the same Cicero in his first booke of Epistles to Lentulus; to witt, that See lib. 2. oraculorum Sibyl. when the Romans should restore a king in Egypt by force; thē should insue the vniuersal king, that should be Lord ouer Romans and all other. Which prophetie, being much vrged by Epist. 5. Cato the Tribune, against the restoring of He vvas father to Cleopatra. Ptolomaeus Auletes late king of Egypt, that for his euil gouernment was expulsed by his subiects: the matter was to be of such weight by all the Roman Senat, (I meane the sequel of this prophetie:) that whereas otherwise for manie respectes, they were greatelie inclined to haue restored the The scare vvhich the Romās had of th' vniversal king, prophetied by Sibylla. said Ptolomie: yet in regarde of this, religion, (as they called it,) they changed their mindes. But what? could they alter by this, the determination of God? No truly; for sone after, king Polomie perceyuing the Senatours mindes to be altered; fled secretely from Rome, to one Gabinius Dion. l. 39. hist. that was Gouernour of Siria; and for fiue Millions of gold, that he promissed hym, he was by the forces of Gabiniꝰ restored; and so not longe after, was Christ borne, according to the meaning of the Sibyl

prophetie.
                  Fowerthlie, the say de Emperour Constantine proueth th' authoritie of thes Sibylles verses, for that Augustus Caesar before Christ was borne, had such regarde The. 4. proofe. of them, that he layed them vp, in more straite order then before, (according as Suetonius a heathen, in his life reporteth,) vnder the Alter of Apollo, in the hill Palatine; wher no man might haue the sight Suet. tranq. ca. 3. de vita Augusti. of them, but by special licence; which licence, Constantine proueth, that Virgil the Poet had, for that he was in highe fauour with Augustus. And therfore in a certaine Ecloge, or composition of verses, that he made in praise of a yong chylde named The propheties of Sibylla alleaged by Virgile. Saloninus, newlie borne to Asinius. Pollio, Augustus great friende; or (as other take it,) of Marcellus, a litle boye, that was nephue to Augustus by his Sister Octauia; or rather of them both, for adulation of Augustus: he applieth (I say) to one, or both of thes yonge infantes, the whole prophetie, which he had reade in the verses of Sibilla, touching the birthe of Christ, & of the peace, grace, & golden world, that should come with hym. Vpon which subiect he beginneth thus. Virgil. Eclog. 4. Christes preordination.
                  
                  
                     Vltima Cumaei venit iam temporis aetas;
                     Magnus ab integro saeculorum nascitur ordo;
                     Iam redit & virgo; rediunt Saturnia regna.
                  
                  
                     That is; now is come the last age prophetied by Sibylla called, Cumaea: now cō
                        meth to be fulfilled the great ordinaunce and prouidence of God, appointed from

the beginning of the world; (thes were Sibylles wordes:) now cōmeth the virgine; and the first golden dayes of Saturnus, shall returne againe.
                  
                  Thus much translated Virgile out of Sibylla, touching th' eternal determinatiō of God, for Christs comming into this world; as also of his mother the virgine; and of the infinit blessings that should appeare with hym. Now ensueth in the same Poet, what Sibylla had said for Christs actual natiuitie. Christes birth.
                  
                  
                     Iam noua progeniescaelo dimittitur alto:
                     Chara Deum soboles. &c.
                  
                  
                     Now a new progenie or ofspring, is sent downe from heauen; the dearlie beloued issue or childe of the Gods.  And note here, that Sibilla said plainlie; chara Dei soboles, the dearlie beloued sonne of God, and not of Gods; but that Virgile would follow the style of his time. And thirdlie, he setteth downe out of Sibylla, th' effect and cause of this sonne. of Gods natiuitie, in thes wordes. Christes cause of cō
                        minge.
                  
                  
                     Te duce, si qua manent, sceleris vestigia nostri;
                     Irrita perpetua, soluent formidine terras.
                  
                  
                     That is; thou beinge our leader, or Captaine; the remnant of our sinnes, shalbe made voide, or taken awaye, and shall deliuer the world for euer, frō feare for the same. Thes are virgils wordes translated (as I said,) out of Sibilla. And now consider you in reason, whether thes propheties might be applied (as Virgile applied them,) to those poore children in

Rome or no, who died soone after this flatterie of Virgile, without doing good either to them selues or to others? Albeit (perhappes) in this pointe, the Poet bee to be excused, in that he being not able to imagine, what the Sibyl should meane: made his aduantage therof, in applying the same to the best pleasing of Augustus.
                  Thes then are the proofes, which Censtantine vseth for the credit and authoritie of the Sibyl verses. And of Sibilla Erithraea in particuler, that made the Acrostik verses before mentioned, of Christes death and passion; he concludeth in thes wordes. Thes are the thinges vvhich sell from

For vvhich cause, I am induced to accompt her for blessed, vvhom our Saucour did voutel safe to chuse for a prophet, to denounce vnto the vvorld, his holie prouidence tovvardes vs. And we may consider in this whole discourse of Constantine, for authoritie of thes verses. First, that he vseth onlie the testimonie of such  writers, as liued before Christ was borne, or Christians thought vpon. Secondlie, that he vseth thes prooses to no meaner  audience, the to a Councel and congregation of learned men. Thirdlie, that he was  an Emperour which vseth them; that is, one that had meanes to sce and examine the original Copies in the Romane treasarie. Fowerthelie, that he had greate learned  men aboute hym, who were skilful, and would be diligent in the searche of suche an antiquitie of importance; especiallie

Lactantius, that was Master to his Lactātius. sonne Crispus, & who most of anie other authour, reciteth and confirmeth the said Sibyls verses: & Eusebius Caesariensis, that wrote th' ecclesiastical historie, & See Euseb. l. 4. cap. 32. de vita Cōstantini
                           •
                         hovv this oratiō vvas first vvriten in latine & translated into greek. recordeth this oration of Constantine therin. And finallie, we may consider that Constantine was the first publique Christian Emperour, and liued within 300. years after Christ; whē the recordes of the Romās were yet whole to be seene. He was a religious, wise, and graue Emperour; and therfore would neuer haue bestowed so muche labour, to confirme suche a thing, at such a tyme, to such an audiēce; had not the matter bene of singuler importance. And thus much of the second pointe touchinge prophetes among Gentiles.
                  There remaineth onlie a worde or two Of the confession of Oracles, cō
                        cerninge Christes cō
                        minge. to be spokē of the thirde; which is, of the confession of deuils and Oracles, concerning Christs comminge; especiallie, whē the tyme of his appearance drew neare, and that they begā to forefeele his power and vertue. Wherin, as I might alleage diuers examples recorded by the Gentiles them selues: so for that I haue bene somewhat longe in the former pointes, and shall haue occasion to saye more of this matter, in an other place hereafter: I will touche onlie here two oracles of Apollo, concerninge this matter. Th' one wherof; was to a priest of his owne, that demaunded hym of true religion, and of God; to whom he answered thus in greeke: ô thou
                     
unhappie priest, vvhy doest thou aske me of God, The first Oracle. that is the father of all thinges; and of this most renoumed kynges deare and onlie sonne; and of the spirit that conteineth all &c. Alas, that Suidas in Thulis. & Porphy. & Plutarch. de oracul. spirit vvill inforce me shortelie, to leaue this habitation and place of oracles.
                  Th' other oracle, was to Augustus Gaesar, euen about the verie tyme, that Christ was redy to appeare in flesh. For where as The second Oracle. the said Emperour now drawinge into age, would needes goe to Delphos, and Suidas i. vita August. Niceph. l. 1. bist. cap. 17. there learne of Apollo, who should reigne after hym, & what should become of thinges whē he was dead: Apollo would not answere for a greate space; notwithstanding, Augustus had bene verie liberal, in making the greate sacrifice called Hecatombe. But in th' ende, when th' Emperour began to iterate his sacrifice againe, and to be instant for an answer: Apollo, (as it were) inforced, vttered thes straunge wordes vnto hym. An Hebrue childe, that ruleth ouer the blessed Gods, commaundeth me to leaue this habitation; and oute of hand to gett me to hel. But yet doe you'departe in silence from our Aulters. Thus much was Apollo inforced to vtter of his owne miserie, and of the cōming of th' Ebrue boye that should putt hym to banishment. But yet the deceptful spirit, to holde still his credire, would not haue the matter reueiled to many. Wherupon, Augustus falling into a greate musinge with hym self, what this answer might importe: returned to Rome and builded there an Aulter in the Capitole,

with this latine inscription, (as Nicephorus affirmeth;) Ara primogeniti Dei. 
                     Niceph. l. 1. hist. cap. 17. Th' Aulter of Godes first begotten sonne.
                  Thus then haue I declared how that The cōclusion of this first Sectiō. the cōming of Gods sōne into the world, was for tolde both to Iewe and Gentile, by all meanes that possiblie in reason might be deuised: that is; by propheties, signes, figures, ceremonies, tradition, and by the confession of deuils them selues. Nor onlie, that his comming was fortold: but also; why, and for what cause he was to come; that is; to be a Saueour of the world; to die for sinne; to ordeine a new law, and more perfect common wealth. How also he was to come: to witt; in mans fleshe; in likenes of sinne; in pouertie, & humilitie. The tyme likewise of his appearance was foresignified, together with the maner of his birth, life, actions, death, resurrection, and ascensiō. And finallie, nothing can be more desired for the fore knowledge of anie one thing to come; then was deliuered & vttered cō
                     cernīg the Messias, before Christ or Christians were talked of in the world. Now thē remaineth it to consider & examine, Th' argument of the tvvo sectiōs follovving. whether thes particularities, fortolde so lōg agoe of the Messias to come, doe agree in Iesus, whom we acknowledge for the true Messias. And this shallbe the subiect & argument, of all the rest of our speeche in this chapter.
               
               
                  
                  Hovv the former predictions vvere fulfilled in Iesus, at his being vpon earth. Sect. 2.
                  ALbeit in the pointes before recited, which are to be fulfilled in the Messias at his comming; we haue some controuersie and disagreemēt with the Iewe, as hath bene shewed: yet our principal contention in them all, is with the Gentile and heathen, that beleeueth no scriptures. Our controuersie vvith Gentiles. For that in diuers of the fornamed articles, the Iewe standeth with vs, and for vs; & offereth his life in defence therof, as farre foorth, as if he were a Christiā. In so much, that the Gētile oftē times, is inforced to maruaile, when he seeth a people, so extremelie bent against an other, as the Iewes are against Christiās; and yet to stand so peremptorilie, in defence of thos verie principles, which are the proper causes of their disagreement.
                  But hereunto the Iew maketh answer; that his disagreement from vs, is in th' application of thos principles. For that in no wise he will allowe, that they were, or may bee verified in Iesus. And herein he standeth against vs, much more obstinatelie then doth the Gentile. For that the Gentile, as soone as he commeth Our controuersie vvith the Ievves. once to vnderstande and beleeue the propheties of scripture; he maketh no doubt or difficultie in th' application thereof; for that he seeth the same most euidentelie fulfilled in our Saueour. Which is the cause, that fewe or no Gentiles since

Christs appearance, haue come to be Iewes, but that presentelie also they passed ouer to be Christians.
                  But the Iewe, by no meanes wilbe moued to yeeld, albeit he haue neither scripture, Th' obstinacie of the Ievves. nor reason, nor probabilitie for his defence. Which among other thinges, is a verie great argument to proue, that Iesus was the true Messias in deed, seing that among the markes of the true Messias set downe by Gods Prophetes, this was one; that he should be refused by the Iuishe Nation. Herehence are those wordes of Psal 113. Esa. 28. the Holie Ghost so longe before vttered. The stone vvhich the 
                     The builders are the Ievves, who take vpon thē to build Gods house. Math. 21. Esa. 6. Deut. 28. 
                     builders refused, is made the head stone of the corner: this is donne by God, and is maruailous in our eyes. Hence is that great complainte of Esay, touching th' incredulitie & obstinacie of this people, against their Messias at his comming; which Moyses also longe before Esay, expressed most effectuallie.
                  It maketh then, not a litle for our cause, (gentle reader,) that the Iuishe Nation is The Ievves obstinacie against 
                           〈◊〉
                        , 
                           〈◊〉
                         
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         for vs. so wilfullie bent against vs; and that they refused Christ so peremptorilie, at his being among them. For whom so euer that Nation should receyue, and acknowledge: it were a great argument by scripture, that he were not in deede the true Messias. But yet to demonstrate 
                        〈◊〉
                      worlde, how litle shew of reason they haue, in standing thus against their owne saluation, and in refusing Iesus, as they doe: I will in as great breuitie as I may,

runne ouer the chief pointes that passed at his being vpon earth, and therby examine by the testimonies of his greatest enimies, whether the forsaid propheties and all other signes, which haue bene frō the beginning, to fortell vnto vs the true Meisias; were fulfilled in hym and his actions or no.
                  And for that the matters are manie and diuers, that will come herein to be The diuisiō of this Section into sovver Cō
                        siderations. handled: I will for order sake, reduce all to fower considerations. Wherof the first shalbe, touching the tyme foreprophetied of the comming of Meisias, and whether the same agreed with Christes Natiuitie or no. The seconde shalbe, of diuers particulers that passed in Christes incarnation, birth, circumcision, and other accidētes, vntill the tyme that he began to preach. The third shalbe, of his life, conuersatiō, miracles, and doctrine. The fowerth and last, of his Passion, death, resurrection, and Ascensiō. In all which (as I sayed before,) I will vse no one Authour or testimonie The testimonies here vsed. of our owne side, for prouing anie thing that is in controuersie bytwene vs: but all shall passe by trial, either of their owne scriptures; or of manifest force and consequence of reason; or els by expresse recorde of our professed enimies.
                  FOR THE first then, concerning the tyme, which is the principal and head of THE 1. Consideration. THE tyme appointed all the rest; it is to be noted, that by consent of all writers both Pagan, Iuishe, & Christian; Iesus, (whom we beleeue and

confesse to be true Christ,) was borne the 25. daye of December, in th' ende of the 41. yeare of th' Emperour Augustus reigne, which was 15. years before his reigne ended. Also in the beginning of the 33. yeare of Herodes reigne in Iurie, which was 4. yeares and more before his death. And from the beginning of the world, as See Euseb. i chro. some accompt; 5199. And as other; 4089. for that in this pointe betwene the Hebrues and Graecians, there is a differēce of some litle more then a hundreth years, concerninge their reconinge.
                  The state of the worlde at Iesus Natiuitie, The general state of the vvorld at Christes comminge. was this. The three Monarchies of the Assyrians, Persians, and Graeciās, were past ouer, and ended: & the Romans were entered into the fowerth, that was greater then anie of the rest, according to the prophetie of Daniel, 500 yeares before. Dan. 2. Octauius Caesar, surnamed Augustus, after fyue ciuil warres by hym self waged, and after infinit broyles and bloodshed in the Suetom tranq. & Aurel. victor. & alii, in vita Augusti. worlde, reigned peaceablie alone, for many yeares together: & in tokē of an vniuersal peace ouer all th' earth: he caused the temple gates of IANVS to be shutt, according to the custome of the Romans in such cases; albeit this had happened but twise before, from the buylding of Rome vnto that tyme. And the verie same daye that Christ was borne in Iurie, Augustus commaūded in Rome (Oros. l. 6. hist. ca. 22. as afterward was obserued,) that no man should call hym LORDE, therby to signifie the free libertie,

rest, ioye & securitie, wherin al mē were, after so longe miseries, which by continual warres the world had suffered.
                  By this we gather first, that this tyme of Iesus birth, agreed exactelie with the The. 1. proofe. The Roma Monarchie prophetie so longe before sett downe in Daniel, (who lyued in the first Monarchie;) that after his tyme, there should be three Monarchies more, and the last, biggest Dan. 2. v. 31. 34. 44. of all; at whose appearinge, the Messias should come, and build vp Gods kingdome throughout all the world.
                  Secondlie, we see that fulfilled, which Esay aboue a hundreth yeares before Daniel, The. 2. proofe. The peace of all the vvorld. Esa. 9. v. 6. 7 & cap. 32. v. 18. fortold; that at the cōming of Christ; people should sitt in the beautie in peace. And againe; there shalbe no ende of peace. And yet further: he shall be Prince of peace. And kinge Dauid, longe before hym againe; in his dayes there shal ryse iustice, and abundance of peace. Which thinge, though especiallie it be to be vnderstoode, of th' internal peace Psal. 71. and tranquilitie of our myndes and soules: yet, considering that external peace also was necessarie for a tyme, for the quiet plantinge & publishinge of Christes Gospel: and seinge that the same wās brought to passe most miraculouslie vpon the suddain, when in reason men least might expect the same, for th' infinite warres wherin the worlde a litle before had bene; and by reason of the Roman Monarchie so freshelie established; (whiche in their begininges are wont to be troublesome:) this peace (I saye,) can not be, but, a

greate argument, that this was the proper tyme of the Messias his comminge. And this, for the state of the world in general.
                  But now for the particuler state of The. 3. proofe. The scepter of Iuda. Iurie, at Iesus natiuitie; thus it was, according as Iosephus the Iew, (who was borne within fyue yeares after Christ his passion,) describeth the same. One Herod a straunger, whose father called His grādfather vvas a Sextane in Apollos tē
                        ple, & his father vvas brought vp amonge thieues in Idumaea. Euseb. l. 1. cap. 6. ex Aphricano. Ioseph. l. 14 antiq. ca. 2. Antipater, came out of Idumaea, was rysen to acquaintance and fauour with the Romans, partelie by his said fathers meanes, who was (as Iosephus wordes are,) a vvell monicd man, industrious, and sactious; and partelie also by his owne diligence and ambition; being of hymself, both wittie, beautiful, and of excellent rare qualities. By which cōmendatiōs, he came at length to marry the daughter of Hyrcanus kinge of Iurie, that was descended liniallie of the house of Dauid, and tribe of Iuda. And by this mariage, obteined of his father-in-law to be Gouernour of the prouince of Galilie, vnder hym. But Hyrcanus afterwardes, fallinge into the handes of the Parthyians, that caried hym into parthia: The first rysing of Herod Ascolonita. Herod ranne away to Rome, and there, by the helpe and special fauour of Antonie, that ruled in company together with Octauius: he obteined to be created kinge of Iurie, without all title or interest ī the world. For that not onlie his said fatherinlaw Hyrcanus was yet a lyue in Parthia; but also his yonger brother Aristobulus, and three of his sonnes named Antigonus,

Alexander, and Aristobulus, and diuers other of the blood Royall, in Iurie.
                  Herodthen, hauing procured by thes meanes to be kinge of Iurie; procured Ioseph. l. 15 antiq. c. 9. 11. first to haue into his handes the forsaid kinge Hyrcanus, and so put hym to death; as also he brought to the same ende his yonger brother Aristobulus, together The most horrible murders, cōmitted by Herod. with all his three sonnes. He putt to death also, his owne wife Mariamnes that was kinge Hyreanus daughter, as also. Alexandra her mother; And soone after, two of his owne sonnes by the said Mariamnes, for that they were of the blood Royal of Iuda. And a litle after that againe, he put to death his third sonne named Lib. 17. ca. 10. Antipater. He caused to be slaine at one tyme 40. of the chiefest noble men of the tribe of Iuda. And, as Philo the Iewe Lib. 15. c. 1. writeth, (that liued at the same tyme with hym,) he putt to death all the Sanhedrin, that is, the seuentie and two Senatours Philo li. de tempore. of the tribe of Iuda, that ruled the people. He kylled the chief of the sect of Pharisies. He burned the genealogies of all the kinges and princes, of the house of Iuda; and caused one Nicolaus Damascenus Ioseph. l. 14 cap. 2. an Historiographer that was his seruant, to draw out apetidegree for hym and his line, as though he had descended A paterne of an ambitiōs Tyrāt. from the auncient kinges of Iuda. He translated the highe priesthode & solde it to straungers. And finallie he so rased, dispersed, and mangled the house of Iuda;

as no one iote of gouernment, dignitie, or principallitie remained therin. And when he had donne all this: then was Iesus, of the same house and line, borne in Bethleē, the proper Cittie of Dauid, which Dauid was the founder and first authour of Regalitie in Iuda.
                  Now then, consider the prophetie of Iacob concerning the particuler tyme of The prophetie of Iacob, touching the scepter of Iuda. Gen. 49.
                      Christes appearāce, almost two thousand years before thes thinges fell out. Come hyther my childrē
                      (said he,) that I may tell you the thinges vvhich are to happē in the later dayes. &c. The scepter shall not be taken from Iuda, untill he come, vvho is to be sent; and he shall be th' expectation of Nations. Which prophetie, that it was fulfilled now at Christes Natiuitie, when Herod had extinguished all gouernment in Iuda; no man can denie, that will acknowledge the thinges sett downe before, which are recorded by writers both of that tyme, and of the Iuishe Nation and religion. And that it neuer was fulfilled from Dauids dayes, That the scepter neuer failed in Iuda, vntill Herode came. 1. Reg. 16
                      (who began the gouernment to the house of Iuda,) vntil this time: appeareth plainlie by all histories and recordes, both Diuine and Prophane. For that frō Dauid, (who was the first kinge,) vnto Zedechias, that was the last, and died in the Captiuitie of Babylon: the Scripture sheweth how all kinges descended of the 4. Reg. 29 Iere. 37. house of Iuda. And during the tyme of the captiuitie in Babylon, (which was 70 yeares;) the Iewes were alwayes permitted

to chuse to them selues a gouernour of the house of Iuda, whom they Thalm. in tract. Sanhed. cap. Dinei Mā
                        monoth. Rab. Moses Egyp. in praefat. Maimonim Esd. l. 1. c. 1. 2. 3. called RESCHGALVTA. And after their deliuerie from Babylon, Zorobabel was their Captaine of the same tribe; and so others after hym, vntill ye come to the Machabies, who were both Captaines & priests; for that they were by the mothers side, of the tribe of Iuda, & by the fathers side, of the tribe of Leui, as Rabbi kimhi holdeth. And from thes men downe to Mach. l. 1. c. 2. 3. Rab. Kimhi com. in Agg. Ioseph. l. 13 & 14. anti. Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, whom Herod slew; there continued stil the same line, as Iosephus declareth. So that by this prophetie it is euident, that Iesus was borne at the propper tyme appointed for the Messias, whē there was neither king, nor Captaine, nor highe prieste, nor Councelour, nor anie one gouernour of the house and tribe of Iuda, left in Iurie.
                  An other prophetie ther is, no lesse euident then the former, wherin it is affirmed, The. 4. proofe. The destructiō of the second Temple. that the Messias shall come before the secōd Temple of Ierusalem, (that was builded by Zorobabel after the Iewes returne from their captiuitie in Babylon,) should be destroyed by the Romans. For 3. Reg. 6. & 7. 2. Para. 3. Euseb. in Chron. Clem. l. 1. strom. 4. Reg 25 1. Esd. 1. 3. 4. better vnderstanding wherof, it is to be noted, that the Temple of Ierusalem was builded twise: first by Salomon, which lasted about 442. yeares; and then it was burned and destroyed by Nabuchodonosor, kinge of Babylon. Wherfore aboute seuētie yeares after, it was builded againe, by Zorobabel, who reduced the Iewes frō
                     
Babylon, and so it continued, vntill it was destroyed the second tyme by Titus sonne to Ve: pasian the Roman Emperour, about fortie yeares after Christs Ascension. At what tyme, it had lasted from Zorobabel, almost six hundred yeares: And from Salomon, aboue a thousande.
                  And as in tyme of the second building, the people of Israel were poore, and much 
                        1. Esd. 5. & 6. The building of the second Tē
                        ple, lesse gorgeous thē the first afflicted in respecte of their late longe banishement, (though much assisted to this worke by the liberalitie and munificēcie of Darius kinge of Babylon:) so was the building and workeman hippe of this seconde temple, nothing comparable, for excellēcie, to the first building of Salomō, when the Iewes were in the flower of their glorie and riches. This testifieth Aggaeus 1. Esd. 5. the Prophet, who was one of the builders; and he testified the same to Zorobabel and to the rest of thos that were with hym, by Gods owne appointement, in thes wordes. The vvorde of God vvas made 
                     Agg. 2. v. 4 
                     to Aggeus the Prophet. Tell Zorobabel the sonne of Salathiel Captaine of Juda, and Iesus the sonne of Iosedec highe prieste, and the rest of the people. VVho is there leste of you, that savv this temple in his first glorie, (before our transinigration,) & vvhat say you to this, vvhich Novv vve see? is it not in our eyes, as though it vvere not at all? that is, is it not as though it were a thinge of nothing, in cōparison of the former temple, which Salomon builded?
                  Thus said Aggaeus by Gods commissiō, of the material building of this second

Temple. And yet, to comfort the Iewes withall, he was commaunded presentelie in the sane chapter to say thus. Comfort thie self Zorobabel, and comfort thie self Iesu sonne of Iosedec high priest, and comfort your selues all ye 
                     Agga. 2. 
                     people of the earth, saith the Lord God of hostes: doe ye the thinges vvhich I couenanted vvith you, vvhen ye came foorth of the land of Egypt, and feare not, for that my spirit shall be among you. Thus sayeth the Lord of hostes; 
                     This he saithe for that the 3. Monarchies issued, vvherin there vvas continuall vvarre and bloodshed. 
                     a litle time yet remaineth, vvhen I vvill moue both heauen and earth, both sea and lande, vvith all countries in the vvorld. And then shall come the DESIRED OF ALL NATIONS; and I will fill this hovvse (or temple) vvith glorie, sayeth the Lord of hostes. Siluer is mine, and gold is mine, sayeth the Lord of hostes: great shalbe the glorie of this ast hovvse or temple, more then of the first, sayeth the Lord God of hostes. Hytherto are the wordes of God by Aggaeus, and the often repetition, of the Lord God of hostes, is to signifie the certaintie & great weight of the matter promissed.
                  Now consider then, that wher as God had said immediatelie before, that this second temple was nothing in respect of the first, for pompe and riches of the material building, (which the olde men in the booke of Esdras did testifie, by their weeping, 1. Esd. 3. when then they saw this seconde, & remembred the first:) yet now God saith that, Gold and seluer is his ovvne, (as though he made no accompt of th' abundāce therof in the former temple, or of the want of the same, in this:) and that not withstanding

the pouertie of this second building; yet, shall it be filled and replenished vvith glorie, and that in such sorte, as it shall farre passe in glorie, the former; and that shall bee, (as both here is expressed, and other where most plainlie,) by the comming of This vvas fulfilled vvhē Christ vvas personallie, and taught in the Tēple. Luc. 1. 2. 19 Mat. 21. 26. &c. Christ into the second temple, which shalbe a greater dignitie, then anie dignitie what soeuer was found in the first building of Salomons temple.
                  Concerning which point, it is to be cōsidered, that the learned Iewes, besides 
                        Prerogatiues of the first Tēple. Rab. Samuel tract. Sanhed. in Thalm. Hierosol. Rab. Aba in l. dicru. the material difference of building before mentioned, doe note fiue thinges of great importance to haue bene wanting in the seconde temple, which were in the first. To witt; the fire sent from heauen to burne the Holocaustes: The glorie of God (or Angels) appearing among the images of Cherubins, that stoode in the temple: The manifeste inspiration of Gods spirit  vpon Prophetes, (for that prophetie  fayled in the second temple:) The presence  of the Arcke: And last of all, the  
                     Vrim and Thumim. All which great wantes  and differences not withstanding, God saith, as you see, that the glorie of this second temple shalbe much greater then the first, by the comminge of Christ into the same. Which thing, Malachie the prophet that lyued at the same tyme when the second Malac. 3. temple was in buildinge, confirmeth yet more expresselie in thes wordes. Beholde I send my 
                     This Christ interpreted of S. Iohn Baptiste. Math. 11. 
                     Angel, and he shal prepare the vvay before my face. And straight after, shal
                     
                     come to his temple, the Lord or ruler vvhom you seeke, and the MESSENGER OF THE TESTAMENT, vvhome you desyre. Beholde 
                           〈◊〉
                         cometh cometh saith the Lord of hosles, and vvho ca imagine the day of his comming? or vvho can stande or abyde te see him? for he shalbe as a purging fire. &c.
                  
                  By all which is made euidēt, that Christ must come and appeare in the seconde téple, before it be destroyed; (as Iesus did,) and therfore he can not be new to come, seing the laid temple was destroyed aboue 1500. year past by the Romas, as hath bene said. Which destruction and final desolation, was prophetied by Daniel to ensue soone after the byrth and death of Christ, in thes wordes. After sixtie and tvvo heb 
                           〈◊〉
                        , 
                     Dan. 9. The second Temple to be destroyed presentlie after Christes Passion. 
                     Christ shalbe slaine; And a people vvith their Captaine to come, shall destroye the Cittie, and the Sanctuarie, and th' ende therof shalbe vastitie or spoile. And after the vvarre ended, there shall ensue th' appointed desolation. Which prophetit to haue fallen out lytterallie, about fortie yeares after Iesus was put to death, when Ierusalem was destroyed, and the temple ouerthrowen by Titus; the storie of Iosephus the learned Iewe, who was a Captaine against Titus in that Ioseph de bello ludiaco lib. 6. warre; doth manifestlie & at large declare.
                  AND for that we haue made mention here, of Daniels prpohetie, concerning The. 5. proofe. The 72. Hebdomades. the particuler tyme of Christs comming, and of his death; which confirmeth the purpose we treate so perspicuouslie, as nothing can be said more euident: it shall

not be amisse, to examine the same before we passe anie further. For better conceyuinge wherof, it is to be vnderstood, that this greeke worde Hebdomada, (signifying seuen,) doth sometyme importe a weeke of seuen dayes, accordinge to our commó vse; and then it is called in scripture Hebdomada 
                     Tvvoe kindes of vveekes. 
                     dierum, a weeke of dayes; as Dan. 10. v. 2. where Daniel sayeth, that he did mourne three weekes of dayes. But at other tymes, it signifieth the space of seué yeares, and is called in Scripture Hebdomada annorum, a weeke of yeares. As in Leuiticus wher it is said: Thou shalt number 
                     Leui. 25. vide etiam cap. 23 & alibi passim 
                     to theoseuen vveekes of years, that is, seuen tymes seuen, vvhich make fortie and Nine years.
                  
                  Now then it is certaine, that Daniel in the prophetie before alleaged, where he assigneth 62. weekes to the tyme of Christs death, could not meane vveekes of dayes; for that he appointeth onlie seuen weekes, to the rebuilding of the cittie of Ierusalem; of the Temple; & of the walles aboute; which were not ended but in fortie and nyne yeares after, as may be gathered Lib. 1. & 2. by the bookes of Esdras: which 49. weekes, doe make iust seuen weekes of yeares. And therfore it is certaine, that such Hebdomades of yeares are meāt here by Daniel, in all the prophetie.
                  First then, when th' Angel came to cō
                     fort hym, and to open vnto hym secretes for the tyme to come: he said thes words. Marke my speech and vnderstand the vision. The 
                     Dan. 9. v. 23. 
                     seuentie hebdomades (or vveekes) are shortened
                     
                     (or hastened) vpon thy people, and vpon thie holie Cittie; to th' end all preuarication and sinne may take an ende, and iniquitie be blotted out, & euerlasting iustice be brought in place therof; to th' ende that visions and propheties may be fulfilled, and the HOLIE OF HOLIES, may be annointed. In which wordes, it seemeth that Ierem. 25. & 29. the Angel did allude by naming seuentie, vnto the seuētie yeares of captiuitie, prophetied by Ieremie; after which ended, the VVhie 
                           〈◊〉
                         Angel nameth 70. Hebdomades in this place. people should be deliuered frō their tēporal bondage in Babylō. And therfore Daniel now being ī that place, & perceauing the same time to be expired; prayed to God with great instance, to fulfill his promisse made by Ieremie. Wherto th' Angel answered, that it should be donne. And as after the expiration of seuentie years, God was now to deliuer them, from the bodilie captiuitie of Babylon: so was he also after seuentie hebdomades more, to deliuer them from bondage of sinne and preuarication, and that by th' annointed MESSIAS which is indeede the Holie of all Holies.
                  
                  This (I say) may be the reason of naming seuentie hebdomades, therby to allude to the number of the seuentie years of that Babylonical seruitude. For that immediatelie after the Angel appointeth the whole exacte nūber, to be three skore and nine hebdomades; that is, seuen to the building of the cittie and temple, & three skore and two, from that, to the death of Dan. 9. v. 
                           〈◊〉
                         5. Christ, in thes wordes. Knovv thou and
                     
                     marke, that from the ende of this speech, to the tyme that Ierusalem shalbe builded, and vnto 
                     The exact number of vveekes, frō the building of the secōd Tēple to the death of Christ. 62 
                     Christ the Captaine, there shalbe hebdomades seuē, and Hebdomades sixtie tvvo; and the streetes and vvalles (of Jerusalem) shalbe builded againe though vvith much difficultie of the tymes: and after sixtie and tvvo Hebdomades, Christ shalbe slaine. And the people that shal denie hym, shal not be his. &c. And then vnto consummation and ende, shal perseuer desolation.
                  
                  Now then if we putt thes yeares together, whiche are here mentioned by Daniel: that is, first the seuen Hebdomades, which make fortie and nyne yeares; and then the three skore and two from the restauratiō of Ierusalem, which make fower hundred thirtie and fower more: we shall fynde the whole number to be Th' accōpt of Daniels vveekes. 483. yeares. Which being begonne from the first yeare of Cyrus, as some wil, (for that he first determined the Iewes reduction:) or from the second yeare of Darius, as other will, (for that he confirmed and putt the same in execution:) or from the twēteth yeare of the said Darius, for that then, he made a new edicte in the fauour of Nehemias, and sent hym into Iurie: euerie waye they will ende in the reigne of Herod and of Augustus, vnder whome Christ was borne; or in the reigne of Tyberius Caesar, vnder whome he suffered. And by no interpretation in the world, can it be auoided, but that this tyme appointed by Daniel, is now owt, aboue a thousand & fyue hūdred yeares past, whyle

yet the temple stoode, and was not putt to desolation. And therfore of necessitie Christ must be come about that tyme, and neuer more hereafter to be looked for.
                  THE traditions and obseruations of th' old Iewes thē selues, doe maruelouslie The. 6. proofe. The traditiōs of Rabines. confirme this belief of ours, for that they all did runne to this one pointe, that aboute the tyme of Augustus his reigne, (wherin Iesus was borne,) the Messias should appeare. It is often repeated in the Thalmud; that one Elias left this traditiō, that the worlde should endure six thousand Thalm. tract. Sādr. cap helec. & alibi. yeares; two thousand before the law of Moyses; two thousand vnder the same law; and two thousand after that, vnder the Messias. Which last two thousand yeares, by all computation, could not beginne much from the birth of Iesus. And the Rabbines a great while gone, complained in their Talmud, that ther Thalm. in tract. Auodazara. seemed to them in thos dayes, seuen hundred & fourtiene yeares past, since Christ by the scriptures, should haue appeared; and therefore they doe maruaile whie God so longe deferreth the same.
                  Another obseruation they haue vpon the wordes of Esay; paruulus natus est nobis, 
                     
                        Esa. 9. v. 6. An obseruatiō of the Cabalistes. a lytle childe is borne vnto vs. In which wordes, for that they finde th' Ebrue letter, MEM, to be shutt in the middest of a worde; (which is strange in that tongue, for that MEM is wont to be open in the middest of wordes, and shutt onlie in the ende:) they gather manie secretes. And

amonge other, that seinge MEM signifieth six hundred years; so longe it should be Th. lm. in lib Sabbath. & in tract Sanhedrin. after Esay, vntill the tyme of Christe. Which accompt of theirs, falleth out so iust: that if you recone the yeares from Achaz kinge of Iuda, in whose tyme Esay spake thes wordes, vntil the tyme of king Esa. 7. Herode, vnder whome Christ was borne: you shall perceyue the number to faile in Mat. 2. litle or nothing.
                  A muche like obseruation hath Rabbi Moses the sonne of Maimon, (whom the Th' obseruation of Rab. Moses. Iewes doe holde in extreme greate reuerence, calling hym the doctor of iustice,) in his epistle to his countrimen of Africa, concerning the tyme of Christs appearance. Rab. Mos. Ben. Maimon. ep. ad Iudaeos African. Which he thinketh to be past, accordinge to the scriptures, aboue a thousand yeares, in his dayes: (he lyued about the yeare of Christ. 1140:) but that God deferreth his manifestation for their sinnes. To which purpose also apperteineth the Rab. Iosue. ben. leui. in Thal. tract. Sanhed. c. helec. tradition of one Elias, (as Rabbi Iosue reporteth it ī the Thalmud,) that the Messias was to be borne in deede, (according to the scriptures,) before the destruction of the second temple; for that Esay sayeth of the Synagoge; before she vvas vvith child, 
                     Esa. 66. v. 7. 
                     she brought foorth; and before the greefe of trauaile came, she vvas deliuered of a man child. That is, (saith he,) before the Synagogue was afflicted and putt to desolation, by Christ hydeth hym self in the sea. the Romans; she brought forthe the Messias. But yet (sayeth he) this Messias for our sinues, doth hyde hym self for a tyme,

in the sea and other deserte places, vntill we be worthie of his comming.
                  To the like effect, is th' obseruation of 
                        Th' obseruatiō of the Talmud. Talm. tract. Sanhed. c. helec. Rab. Iohanan. Rab. Iuda Rab. Nehorai. &c. the Talmud it self, and of diuers Rabbines therin, concerning the wicked manners of men that should bee at Christs appearance vpon earth, of whom they doe pronounce thes wordes. The vvise men in Israel, shalbe extinguished: the learning of our Scribes and Pharisies shalbe putrisied; the scholles of Diuinitie shalbe stevves at that tyme. Which thig Iosephus, that liued in the same age with Christ, affirmeth to be fulfilled in the time of Herod; in so much that if the Romans Ioseph. l. 20 antiq. cap. 6 & 8. & lib. 6. de bello Iud. 15. & lib. 7. c. 9. had not destroyed them; without doubt (sayeth he) either the earth would haue opened and swallowed thē doune, or els fire from heauē would haue consumed thē.
                  All then runneth to this ende, both by scripture, tradition, obseruation, and instincte The. 7. proof Forebodīg.
                      of God hym self: that about Herodes tyme, the true Messias should be borne. And hereof came that common Tacit. l. 21. Sueton. in vita Vesp. Ioseph. de bello Iudai. I. 7. c. 12. and publique fame, that is recorded by Tacitus, Suetonius, and Iosephus, (which was also writen in open sight, vpon the chiefest Tower of the Cittie of Ierusalē;) that out of Iurie should rise, a general Lord of th' vniuersal vvorld. Which prophetie as the Romans either contemned, or turned an other waye, applying the same afterwarde to Vespasian: so the Iewes vnderstood it of their Messias, and Herode feared the matter greatelie, and for that, was so watchefull to exstinguishe the line of

Dauide as hath bene shewed.
                  Hereof also it did proceede, that the The. 8. proofe. The general expectation of the people. Magi, or wise men of the Easte, attended so diligentelie about that tyme, to expect the Starre that Balaam had promissed at the comming of this kinge. Herehence also it was, that the whole people of Iurie, remained so attent at this tyme, more then euer before or sence, in expecting the Messias. Where vpon as soone as euer they heard of Ihon Baptist in the desert; they ranne vnto hym, askinge if he were Ioh. 1. Christ? As afterward also they flocked to Iesus, demaūding, art thou he vvhich is to come; or doe vve expect an other? Which wordes importe, the great expectation wherin that people remained in thos dayes. Nether wanted that expectation in the chief gouernours thē selues; as may appeare, by that speech of theirs to Iesus; hovv lōge 
                     Ioh. 10. 
                     vvilt thovv kill vs (with this expectation?) if thou he Christ; tell vs plainlie.
                  
                  Of which fame, expectation, and greedie Diuers false Christes did rise in luric. desire of the people, diuers deceyuers 
                        〈◊〉
                      occasion to call them selues the Messias, in those dayes; and the people followed them presentelie; which thing had not happened in any age before. And among other, there is named one Iudas Gaulonites, or Galilaeus (as S. Luke calleth Act. 5. Ioseph. l. 17 c. 8. & l. 18. c. 1. & 2. & l. 20. c. 2. & 6. him;) and an other Iudas, the sonne of Ezeehias, both of them verie wicked and licētious felowes. One also called Atōges, a Shepheard; and two other named Theudas and Egyptius, most notable deceyuers.

And aboue all, there was one, Barcozbam, who (as the Talmud saith) for thirtie years together, was receyued for the Messias, Talm. tract Sanh. cap. helec. Rab. Mos. Ben. Maim. in Sententiis. by the Rabbines them selues, vntil at last they slewe hym, for that he was not able to deliuer them from the Romans. Which facilitie in the people, when Herode sawe: he caused Nicolaus Damascenꝰ (as I noted before,) to deuise a petigree Nicol Damascenus. Ioseph. 1 14 antiq. c. 2. for hym from the auncient kinges of Iuda: And so he, as well as other, tooke vpō hym, to be the Messias, whom-diuers carnal Iowes, that expected the Messias to be a magnificent king, (as Herod was,) would seeme to beleeue, & diuulgate abrode; and therof in the Gospell, they are thought to haue bene called, Herodiani; that is, Herodians Mat. 22. Marc. 3. & 12. or followers of Herod, who came to tempt Christ, with the scribes and pharisees.
                  Wherfore to conclude at length, this weightie pointe of the tyme of Christs The cōclusiō of this first cōsideration of the ryme. appearing; seing that about the birth of Iesus vnder Herodes reigne, there cōcurred so many signes & argumētes together; as the general peace of the Roman Empire; the defection of the line and regimēt of Iuda; the open decaye of the second temple; the iust calculation of Daniels hebdomades; the attestation of Oracles; th' obseruation of Rabbines; the publique fame and expectation of all the Iewes; together with the palpable experience of more then fiftien hundreth yeares past, since Iesus appeared, wherin we see the

Iuishe people, in vaine to expect an other Messias; they being dispersed ouer all the world, without temple, law, sacrifice, Prophet, or promisse, for their redemptiō; (which neuer happened to them, vntill after Iesus death, for that in all other their banishementes, captiuities, and afflictions, they had some prophetie, consolatiō, or promisse, for their deliueric:) Thes thinges all (I say) considered, and putt together: we may moste vndoubtedlie and assuredlie conclu le, that Iesus was borne at the iuste tyme appointed, and fortolde by Gods holie spirit; and consequentelie, that he onlie was the holie true Messias, and Saueour of the world, which vet shall better appeare by examination of other thinges, that are to follow.
                  IN THE SECOND consideration there THE. 2. Consideration. Christ his Birthe. come to be weighed, thes pointes follo ving; the Line and stocke of Iesus; his maner of conception; the place of his Birth; his Circumcision & name; his adoration by the Magi; his presentation in the temple; and his flight to Egypt.
                  FOR his Line and stocke; there was neuer 1. Iesus Lym. man denied or doubted, but that Iesus was directetie of the tribe of Iuda, & descēded lineallie by his mother, of the peculiar ho vse of Dauid, (3. Reg. 7. Psal. 30. Esa. 11. according as it was fortolde that the Messias should doe;) which is proued most clearlie, by the two genealogies and petidegrees, sett downe Mat. 1. Luc. 3. by S. Mathew and S. Luke, of the blessed

virgins whole descent, from Dauid to Iosephe, that was of the same tribe and kinred with her. And it is confirmed by their repairinge to Bethleem; (when proclamation was made by Of this matter, vvri teth Iosephus l. 18. c. 1. antiq. Cyrenius in Augustus name, that euerie person should repaire to the head Cittie of their tribe & familie, to be cessed for their tribute;) seing that Bethleem was the proper Cittie onlie of them, that were of the house and line of Dauid; for that king Dauid 1. Reg. 17 2. Reg. 2. was borne therin. And finallie, it is euident by that the Scribes and Pharasies, who obrected matters of much lesse importance against Iesus then this, (as that he was a Carpenters sonne, therby to debase hym for his pouertie;) yet neuer obiected Mat. 13. Luc. 6. they against hym, that he was not of the house of Dauid. Which they would neuer haue omitted, if they might haue done it with any colour; for that it would haue weyed more against hym, then all the rest, and would haue in one worde dispatched the whole controuersie. Nay, I adde further, that it remaineth registred in the Iewes Thalmud it self, that Jesus of 
                     Thal. tract. Sēh. c. Nigmar had. 
                     Nazareth Crucified, vvas of the blood Royal from Zorobabel, of the house of Dauid.
                  
                  FOR the maner of his conception, and 2. The maner of his conception. Luc. 1.
                      of the message or annunciation made vnto his mother, by th' Angel; albeit it depende principally, vpon the relation and credite of the virgin her self, who onlie was priuie there vnto; and vpon the testimonie of Iosephe, to whom it was reueiled by

the same Angel afterwarde: yet, hē that Mat. 1. shall consider the circumstances of the thing it self: as first, the simplicitie of both the reporters. Then, how that it is not likelie, that Iosephe being iust, (as he is described,) would haue cōcealed a thing so much against hym self, and against the lawe, if he had not some way bene assured of the ttuth. Thirdlie, th' innocent age of the blessed virgin, (who was not past 14. yeares olde at that tyme, as S. Augustine Augustin. Lib. 4. de Trin. c. 5. & l. cont. Iudzos c. 5. Chrysost. in cap. 1. Luc. and other aunciēt fathers doe proue by manifest argumentes:) All thes thinges (I saye) doe make it improbable, that she would inuent such a matter of her self. And finallie, the straunge prophetie, whiche she vttered in here Canticle of MAGNIFICAT, and which we see now fulfilled, (albeit at that tyme verie vnliklie;) to witt, that all generations should cal her BLESSED: Thes circumstances, he that shall consider; can not but see that the matter must needes be true.
                  AND as for the kinde and maner of his Natiuitie; most manifest it is by scripture, 3. The maner of Iesus natiuitie. Esa. 7. that the Messias was appointed to be borne of a virgine; for so saith Esay plainlie; Beholde, a virgine shall conceyue, and bring foorth a sonne. And Esay appointeth this to king Achaz, for a wonderful & straūge signe from God. Which he could not haue donne in reason, if the Hebrue worde in that place, might haue signified a yonge woman onlie, (as some later Rabines will affirme;) for that it is no signe nor strange

thinge, but verie common and ordinarie, for yonge women to conceyue and bring foorth childrē. Wherfore the Septuagint doe verie well translate it in greeke, by the proper name of Virgine, and so also did th' elder Iewes vnderstande it, as Rabbi Parthenm. Simeon well noteth. And Rabbi Moses hadarsan of singular Credit withe the Rab. Simeō Ben. Iohai in cap. 2. Gen. Iewes, vpon the wordes of the Psalme; Truth shall budde foorthe of th' earth &c. 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      thus: here Rabbi Io
                        ••
                     n noteth that it is Rar Mos. 
                           〈◊〉
                         in 
                           〈◊〉
                         14, v. 12. not saide, truth shalbe ingendred of th'earth; But, truth shall budde frorth; to signifie therby, that the Meisias, (who is meant by the worde, Truth,) shall no be begottē(as other men are) in carnal population.  Thus farre Rabbi Moses; who in an other place, that is, vpon the 25. chapter of Genesis, alleageth Rabbi Berachias to be of the same opinion, and to proue it out of the 109. Psalme vers. 4.
                  The same is proued also, by the plaine wordes of Ieremie. God hath created a nevv thinge vpon earth; A vvoman shall inuiro: (or 
                     Iere. 31. v. 22. 
                     inclose) a man. That is, she shall inclose hym in her wombe, and bring hym fourth, after a new and straunge maner, without generation of man. And finallie, Rabbi Hacadosch proueth by Cabala out of many Rab. Hacad. quest. 3. in E a. c. 9. places of scripture, not onlie that the mother of Meisias shalbe a virgine, but also that her name shalbe Mary. All the ten Sibyls in like maner, (according as Betuleius Betuleins in l. de car. Sibyl. setteth oute their propheties,) doe make special mention of the mother of

Messias, that she shalbe a most pure and holie virgine; so that this matter was reueiled verie clearlie, both to Iewe and Gentile before it came to passe. And Clemens Alexandrinus writeth, that Simon Magus, to th' end he might not seeme inferiour to Iesus, in this pointe; feigned, that Clem. in recognit. he was also borne of a virgine, as Iesus was.
                  THAT Bethleē, where Christ was borne, 4. The place appointed for the birth of the Messias. Mich. 5. was the peculier place preordained by God, for the birth of the Messias; the prophet Michaeas fort olde plainlie, when he vttered diuers ages before Christ was incarnate, thes wordes. And thou Bethleem Ephrata, arte but a litle one (in respect) of thousandes in Iuda; (and yet,) shal there come foorth of thee, one that shalbe the RVLER of Israel; and his comming foorth is from the beginning, and FROM THE DAYES OF ETERNITIE. By which wordes is plainelie expressed, that albeit Bethleem were but a litle poore Towne (as in deed it was,) in comparyson of manie other in Iuda: yet therin should be borne temporallie that Gouernour of Israel, whose diuine birth was before the worlds foundation, and from all eternitie. And so doe interpret this place, both Ionathan Ben vziel the great Author of the Chaldaie paraphrase, (who died 28. yeares before Christ was borne,) and also R. Selomoh and Hacadosch in their comē
                     taries vpon this place of Michaeas.
                  The same thing fortolde Dauid, of Ephrata, or Bethleem, (for both names

doe signifie one thing, as appeareth by the former place of Michaeas, and Gen. 35. & 48. 1. Para. 2. Psal. 131. others,) when talking of the Messias, and being desirous to know where he should be borne: sayeth; I vvill not goe into the tabernacle of my house, nor into my bedde; nor vvill I gyne my eyes sleepe, or rest to the temples of my head; vntill I find out the place, that is appointed for my Lord; the tabernacle (or house) for the God of Iacob. And then, the mysterie being reueiled vnto hym; he sayeth presentely: Beholde vve haue heard of it (novv) in Ephrata (or Bethleem:) vve haue founde it out in the fieldes 
                     This he saith for that in Danites tyme, Bethleem stoode nigh vnto vvoods Math. 2. 
                     of vvoode. And to shew how he reuerenced the place for that cause; he addeth immediatelie: vve vvill adore in the place vvher his seete haue stoode. Wherby he for prophitieth, not onlie th' adoration vsed after in that place vnto Iesus by the Magi, or three kinges of th' east: but also of all other adoratiō vsed in the same place in the memorie of Iesus, by other deuout Christians vntill this daye. For which respect Origē sayeth, that the place of Bethleem was Orig. cont. Cels. most famous and renoumed in his dayes.
                  For th' Angels appearing to the shepheardes, 5. Th' Angels singinge. in the night of the Natiuitie; there can be no more said, but the credite, honestie, and simplicitie of them, that reported it; and likelie it is they would neuer feigne a thing, that might haue bene refuted by testimonie of the sheapheards them selues, if it had bene false. 6. The name Iesus.
                  
                  Of the name of IESVS, gyuen to hym in his circumcision; it was to be seene sett

downe in a booke, that how so euer it were not scripture; yet was it extant in the worlde, before Christ was borne. I meane the fowerth booke of Esdras, which hath thes wordes in the person of God the father. Beholde the tyme shal come, vvhen the signes shall appeare that I haue tolde 
                     4. Esd. 7. 
                     &c. And my sonne IESVS, shalbe reueiled, vvith these vvho are vvith hym &c. And after those yeares my sonne CHRIST shall dye, and th' earth shall render thos that sleepe therin. Rabi Hacadosch also proueth by arte Cabalist, out of manie places and textes of scripture, that the Messias name at his comming, shalbe, Rab. Haca in Esa. 9. Gen. 49 & psal 71. & 95. IESVS. And among other, he addeth this reason; that as the name of hym who first brought the Iewes out of bondage into the lande of promisse, was Iesus, or Iosue, (which is al one:) so must his name be Iesus, Note this reason. that shall the second tyme deliuer thē from the bondage wherin they are, and restore them to their olde & aunciēt possession of Iurie, which is the chiefe benefite they expect by the Messias.
                  Finallie, it is not probable that the virgine Marie should feigne this name of her self, for that among the Iewes there were manie other names of more honour and estimatiō, at that tyme; as Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Moyses, and Dauid. And therfore if she would haue feigned any; it is like shee would haue taken one of thē, as soone as this, which had not bene the name of anie greate Patriarche.
                  THERE followeth the comming of

the three Magi or wise men, from th' easte; 7. The coming of the three kinges. Mat. 2. of whom Cypr. ser. de Bapt. & idē Tert. l 3. cōt. Marcion. hillar. l. 4 de Trin. los. 12. Cyprians wordes are; it is an olde tradition of the churche, that the Magi of th' easte, vvere kinges, or rather litle Lordes of particuler places. Which is to be vnderstood, such litle kinges, as Iosue slew thirtie in one battaile. And it is to be noted, that S. Mathew maketh mention of the comming of thes kinges to Hierusalem, as of a knowen and publique matter, wherof all Ierusalem and Iurie was able to beare hym wituesse. For he talketh of their open comming to Ierusalem; and of their inquirie for the new borne king; of their speech and conference had with Herod; as also of Herodes consultation with the Scribes and Pharasies, about the place of the Messias birth. And finallie, he sheweth the most pittiful murder that insued of almost 14. Thousad, as saith the Lyturgie of the AEthiopians, and Calend. Gracorum. infinite infantes, in all the circuite of Bethleem for this matter. Which could not be a thinge vnknowen to all Iurie, & much lesse feigned by S. Mathew, for that he should haue gyuen his aduersaries the greatest aduātage in the world; if hè had begunne his Ghospell with so notorious and opē an vntruth, which might haue bene refuted by infinite persons that were yet a liue.
                  Epiphanius is of opinion, that thes Bpiph. haeret. 51. kinges arriued in Hierusalem two yeares after Christs Natiuitie; for that Herod slew all infantes of that age. But other hold more probablie, that the starre appeared Ammon. Alex. in 
                           〈◊〉
                        . vnto them, two yeares before

Christs Natiuitie, so that they came to Bethleē, the thirtienth daye after Christs Niceph. l. 1. c. 13. birth, according as the Church doth celebrat th' epiphanie. S. Basil thinketh, that Basil. ser. in nati. dom. they were learned men, and might by their learning, and art magike, (wherin those countrimen at that tyme were verie skilful;) vnderstand and feele, that the power of their heathē Godes, was greatlie deminished and broken. They might also be stirred vp with that commō brute, and general prophetie, spred ouer all th' east in those dayes, as both Suetonius Suet. in Vespas. c. 4. Ioseph. l. 7. de bel. c. 12. Num. 24. and Iosephus doe recorde; that oute of Iurie should come, an vniuersal Kinge ouer all the vvorld. By thes meanes (I say,) and by the prophetie of Balaam, left a nonge them from Moyses tyme, (for he was a Gētile) wherby was signified, that a starre should rise and declare a greate and mightie king in Israel; they might be induced, at the sight of this Starre, to take so longe a iourney as they did, towardes Iurie.
                  This Starre (as I haue said,) was fortold Propheties of thinges that should fall out in Bethleem. Num. 24. Psal. 71. v. 10. Iere. 31. v. 15. by Balaam a heathen Prophete, aboue 1500. yeares before it appeared. And after Balaam againe it was prophetied by Dauid, that kinges of Arabia, Saba, and other Eastren countries, should come and adore Christ, and offer both gold and other gystes vnto hym. The murder also of those infantes of Bethleem, was presignified by Icremie, in the weeping of Rachel, for thee slaughter of her children: Gen. 35. v. 18. which Rachell was buried in Bethleem,

and for that cause, thos infantes, were called her children, albeit she were dead aboue 2000. yeares before they were slaine, and aboue 1500. before Ieremie wrote the prophetie. Amongest which infantes, Herode also for more assurance, slewe an infant of his owne. For that (as Philo noteth) he was descended by his Philo l. de temp. mother of the lyne of Iuda. Which crueltie comming to Augustus eares, he said (as Macrob. l. 2 Saturnal. cap. 4. Macrobius reporteth,) that he had rather bee Herods swyne, thē his sonne; for that, he being a Iewe, was forbidden by his Augustus speech of Herode. religion to kill his swine, though not ashamed to kill his sonne.
                  The same Starre wherof we speake, is mentiōned by diuers heathen writers; as Plin lib. 2. cap. 25. by Plinie, vnder the name of a Comete, (for so they termed all extraordinarie Heathē testimonies for the Starre vvhiche guided the vvise men. Starres;) which appeared in the later ende of Augustus daies, and was farre different from al other, that euer appeared. And therfore, contrary to the nature of thos kind of Starres, it was adiudged by the whole college of Southsaiers, to portend vniuersal good vnto the earth; and for that cause, had an image of metal erected to it in Rome, and (as Plinies wordes are,) Is Cometa vnus, toto orbe colitur: that only Comete, is worshipped throughout the whole world.
                  Origine also, writeth of one Chaeremon Origen. cōt Celsum. a Stoike, that was much moued with the consideratiō of this starre; & for that after the appearance therof, he perceyued

the power of his Godes, decayed; toke a iourney into Iury, (in company of other Astronomers,) to informe hym self further of the matter. Wherunto Chalcidius, Chalcid. apud Marsil. Ficin. tract. de stella. Mag. a Platonike doth adde, that the Chaldaean Astronomers did gather by contemplatiō of this Starre, that some God discended from heauen to the benefit of mankinde. And finally, the Sibyls talking of the cō
                     ming Sybil. Samia apud Betul. of Christ; affirmed plainly; Rutilans cum sydus monstrabit; a blasing Starre shall declare his comming. Which prophetie Virgile the Poet hauing read in Augustus tyme, and soone after hauing seene the same fulfilled: applied it (as I shewed before of al the rest,) to the flattering of Caesar, and therfore he saieth in the place before alleaged.
                  
                     Ecce Dionaei, processit Caesaris astrum. 
                     Eglog. 4.
                  
                  
                     Beholde the Starre of Caesar (descended of Venus,) hathe now appeared; which Starre in deede, was the Starre of Caesars Lord and Mayster.
                  AFTER fortie daies past ouer, S. Luke Luc. 12. reporteth; how Iesus by his mother was presented in the temple of Ierusalem; and 7. The presentation of Iesus in Hierusalē. there withall recounteth two straunge thinges that happened at the same time: to witte; that two graue and reuerend persons, Simeō, surnamed Iust; and Anna, the Prophetesse; (both of singuler sanctity amongst the Iewes;) cōmig into the Temple, at the very time, when Iesus was there in his mothers armes: tooke notice of him, and acknowledged him publiquely

for the Messias and Saue our of the world. Fortelling also, by the spirit of prophetie, diuers particuler thinges that were to ensue, both to Christ and Christians, and especially to his mother the blessed Virgin. Which thinges being published at that time, & confirmed afterward by the euent: doe well declare, that this narration of S. Luke, could not be forged; as doe also the number of particuler circumstances set doune about the time, place, & persones, most notoriouslie knowen to al Lerusalem. For, as for Anna, she had liued from her youth vntil four skore yeares of Anna the prophetisse. Simeon. age in the temple; & therby was knowen to the most parte of Iurie. And as for Simeon, he was the scholler of the most famous. HILLEL, and cōdisciple to Ionathan Thal. tract. pitkei Auoth. maker of the 
                        〈◊〉
                      paraphase, of whō I spoke before; and the Iewes Thalmud confesseth, that by the death of thes two Thal. tract. Ioma cap. Tereph. Eccalpi. mē (but especially of Simeon,) failled the spirit of the great Synagogue, called Sanhedria; which after the captiuity of Babylō, vntil Herods time, supplied (in a sorte) the spirit of prophetie, that was expresly in Israel before the said captiuity.
                  
                     OF CHRISTS flight into Egypt for feare of Herod, S. Luke well noteth, that 9. Christs flight into Egypt. Luc. 2. Osee 11. it was prophetied by Osee longe before; that God vvould call his sonne oute of Egypt. And the prophet Esay describeth the same very particulerlie, when he sayeth; Behold, our Lord Iehoua, shall ascende vp, (or ride) vpō a light cloude; (which was his flesh or humanitie;)

                     Esa. 19. 
                     and shal goe dovvne into Egypt; and all th' idoles of Egypt, shall shake at his presence. Which later pointe, Eusebius sheweth, Euseb. li. 6. dem. c. 20. & l. 9. c. 2. 3. 4. that it was fulfilled most euidentlie, in the sight of all the worlde; for that no Nation came to Christian religion with so greate celeritie, or with so greate feruour, as did th' Egyptians; who threw downe their Idoles before any other heathen Nation. And as they had bene the The benifite that Egypt receaued by Christes flight vnto it. first in idolatrie to other countries: so were they the first, (by Christes cōminge vnto them,) that afterwarde gaue example of true returne to their Creatour. It followeth in Esay: And I vvil gyue vp Egypt into the handes of cruel Lordes; and a Potēt kinge shall take dominion ouer them. Which was fulfilled aboute the verie time wherin Christ was to come. For that then, after manie spoiles and cruelties excercised vpon Egypt by the Roman Lordes and Princes, Pompey, Caesar, Antonie, and others: in th' ende, Cleopatra their Qiene, (that was the last of all the bloode and lyne of the Ptolomces,) was inforced to slea her selfe; and so Augustus th' Emperour, tooke possession of all Egypte, and subiected it as a prouince, to the Romans Empire.
                  But consider you, how Esay concludeth the matter, after all thes temporal afflictions, threatened against Egypt; and confesse, that suche aduersitie, is no signe of Gods disfauour to them who receaue it. For thus sayeth God, after all his cominations.

                     In that day, there shalbe an Aulter of Iehoua in the middest of Egypt; they shall crie to God in their tribulation, and he shal send them a SAVEOVR &c. Blessing shalbe in the middest of that lande, to vvhome our Lord God of hostes hath gyuen his benediction, saying; Blessed is my people of Egypt. And here we make an ende of our second consideration.
                  
                     IN THE THIRD PLACE, there cōmeth to be considered, (according to our former THE. 3. Consideration. diuision,) the life; conuersation, doctrine, and miracles of Iesus. And first, touching THE LIFE & Actions of Iesus. things done by hym after his cō
                     minge out of Egypt, (whiche might be about the sixt or seuēth yeare of his age,) vntil his Baptisme by S. Iohn, (whiche was the 30.) there is litle recorded, either in Prophane or Ecclesiastical writers. For that, as S. Iustin, S. Chrysostome, Iust. in Tripho. Chrys. in Iohan. Aug. l. 4. de Trinit. c. 5. S. Augustine, and others doe write; he bestowed that time in the common exercises and labours of mans life; therby to shew hymself trueman, and giue demonstration how much he detested idlenes.
                  OF S. Iohn Baptist, all Hebrue writers of that time doe make mention, with exceeding 1. Of S. Iolm Baptiste. praise and admiration of his holines; especially Iosephus, that liued īmediately after Christs dayes, sayeth; hewas, Vir optimus; Iudaeos excitans ad virtutum studia. 
                     Ioseph. l. 18 antiq. ca. 7. A most excellent man, stirring vp the Iewes to the exercise of vertue. He addeth also, that partly for feare of the great concourse of people, which flocked vnto hym; and partly by the sollicitation

of Herodias, cōcubine and brothers wife to Herode Antipas, the great Herodes sonne; (for whos cause he had turned of his owne wife, daughter of Areta king of the Arabians:) he was apprehended, and imprisoned in the Castle of Acherun, and therin soone after, put to death. Which murther, Ioseph esteemed to be the cause of all the miserie whiche ensued afterward to Herode and his whole familie.
                  Of this man, it was writen by Malachie the prophet: Beholde, I send my messenger (or 
                     Malac. 31 
                     Angel) before me; and he shal prepare the vvay before my face: and presently shal come to his Temple, the RVLER vvhom you seeke, and the MESSENGER OF THE TESTAMENT, vvhich you desire. Which prophetie was fulfilled most euidently, when vpon the preaching of S. Iohns behauiour tovvardes Christ. S. Iohn, Christ came vnto hym: and albeit S. Iohn had neuer sene hym before; yet he acknowledged hym for the Messias, in the presence of infinite people; and his acknowledgment was confirmed by the visible descending of a doue & voyce frō heauen, in the sight and hearing of all the Math. 3. Marc. 1. Luc. 3. people present; accordinge as three of our Euangelistes doe reporte. Which they would neuer haue presumed to doe; had not the matter bene most euident, & without al compasse of denial or cōtradiction.
                  And truly, no one thing in al this storie of Iesus life, doth more establish the certaintie of his being the true Messias; then that Iohn Baptiste, (whos wisdome, learning, vertue, and rare sanctitie,

is confessed and recorded by the writings of al our aduersaries:) should refuse the honour of Messias offred to hym self, and lay it vpō Iesus: as also, should direct thos disciples that depended of hym, to the only folowing and embrasing of Iesus doctrine. Which is most euidētly prooued that he did; for that fo so many folowers and disciples as hym self had; no one appeared euer after, that was not a Christiā.
                  WHEN Iesus was baptised, he beganne to preache; & his whole doctrine was directed 2. The preaching and doctrine of Iesus. Deut. 6. Met. 2. to the manifestation of his Fathers will, and amendment of mans life. It tended all, to this one ground and principle: thou shalt loue thy Lord, vvith all thy soule; and thy neyghbour as thy self. It was plaine, easie, perspicuous, and euidēt, though it treated of most high mysteries. It had nether pōpe nor pride of Rhetorical wordes, nor flattering Heathen doctrine. of mans wickednes, as the doctrine of manie Philosophers had. Neither consisted it, of vnpro ficable externall ceremonies, Iuishe ceremonies. (is the later obseruations of the Iewishe laye did;) nor was it fraught with carnalitie and spirit of this world; as the Turkishe Alcoran, and other sectaries Turkish Alcoran. doctrine is. But all was simplicitie, all was spirit, all was trueth, all was honestie, all was humilitie, all was charitie. The cōparison of Christs lavv vvith that of Moyses. Mat. 5. 
                  
                  It tooke awaye or disanulled, no one perfecte or spirituall point of Moyses lawe; but rather reuiued, interpreted, fulfilled, and made perfect the same For wheras that commannded external obseruance,

this added also, internall obedience. Whereas that said, loue your friē
                     des; this adioyned, loue also your enemies. Wheras that commaunded, we should not kill; this further commaundeth, to speake no angrie wordes. Wheras that prohibeted to committ actual adulterie; this also forbiddeth to couet in minde. Wheras that said, take no interest or vsurie of a Iewe that is thy coūtrie-man; this saieth, take it of no man what soeuer. Wheras that accoumpted euerie Iewe only to be thy neyghbour; this teacheth euery person liuing to be thy brother. Wheras that taught thee, to offer vp a calse or a sheepe, or an oxe, for thy finnes; this instructeth thee, to offer vp a contrite harte, in the blood of hym that died for all, with a firme purpose of amendement of life. And finallie, this doctrine tendeth whollie, to Th' effect of Christs doctrine. the true, sincere, & perfect seruice of God thy Lord, that made and redeemed thee: to th' exaltatiō of his onlie name, power, goodnes, and glorie: to the depression of mans pride, by discouering his miserie: to the contempt of this world, and vaine pompe therof: to the mortification and subdueing of our sensuall appetit: to the true loue and vnfeigned charitie of our neighbour: to the stirring vp of our spirit to celestiall cogitations: to peace of conscience, tranquilitie of mynde, puritie of bodie, consolation of our soule. And in one word, to reduce mankvnd againe to a certaine estate of innocencie, simplicitie,

and Angelicall sanctitie vpon earth, with his eye fixed onlie, in th' eternall inheretaunce of Gods kingdome in heauen.
                  THIS was the doctrine deliuered by Iesus; which is the same, that Gods Prophets fortolde, should be deliuered by the Messias. And as for his life and conuersation, 3. The life & conuersatiō of Iesus. by the testimony of his greatest aduersaries, it was more admirable, then his doctrine; his life being a most liuely table, wherin the perfection of al his doctrine was expressed. A man of such grauitie; as neuer in his life he was noted to laugh: of such humilitie; as being the sonne, of God, he scarse vsed in this world, the dignitie of a seruāt: of such sweet and mylde behauiour; as al the iniuries of his ennemies, neuer wreested from him one angry word. Finally, he was such an one, as he was described by Esaie, so many ages before he was borne, in thes wordes: he shal not crye nor contend, nor shal any nan heare his 
                     Esa. 42. 
                     voice in the streete: he shal not crush a broken reade, nor tread out a litle flaxe that lieth smoking on the grounde. And an other Prophet, not long after hym, brake foorth into, this speech, vpō consideratiō of the behaueour Zach. 9. that should be in the Messias; Reioyse thou daughter of Sion; trjumphe thou daughter of Ierusalem; for beholde, thy king shal come vnto the, thy iust sauiour: he is poore and humble, &c. And as thes Prophets did foretel the vertue & sanctetie of the Messias: so the deuils thē selues could not but confesse the same, to haue bene fulfilled in the person of Iesus;

as is most euident by the testimony of Porphyrie, a professed enemie of the Christian name. Who after consideration of diuers Oracles vttered by his Idoles, touching Iesus: he breaketh into this confession. It is exceeding vvonderful, vvhat testimonie 
                     Porphyr. li. de laud. Philos. 
                     the Gods doe gyue of the singuler pietie and sanctitie of Iesus; for vvhich they auovvch hym revvarded vvith īmortalitie: but yet thes Christiās are deceyued, in calling him God. Thus muche Ioseph. l. 18 antiq. c. 7. writeth Porphyrie. And last of al, Iosephꝰ the Iewe, that was borne imediatlie after hym, writeth of hym thus. Ther vvas at this tyme one Iesus, a vvise man, if it be laufull to cal hym a man; a vvorker of most vvonderful miracles, and a Maister and teacher of al such men, as vvillingly vvere content to embrase the truth.
                  
                  IN WHICH testimonie of Iosephus, we 4. Of Iesus Miracles. see mention also of Iesus miracles, which is the next thing wherof we are to consider. And as Iosephus in this place, being a Iewe, beareth witnes that Iesus performed many straunge miracles: so most apparantly, and according to the interpretation of Iosephus in this place, were the same miracles fortolde by the Prophetes of God, that they should be done by the true Messias. So, Esaie in his 35. Predictions of the Messias Miracles. chapter describeth at large, how the Messias at his coming, shal declare his commission by gyuing sight to the blind, hearing to the deafe, speech to the dombe, & agilitie of body to the Lame & Cripplē. And that which is more maruailous; God reuealed this point very particularly to

the Gentiles by the Sibyles, among who one of them wrote thus of Christ to come, as Lactantius recordeth. He shal doe al by his 
                     Lact. I 4. diuina. Instit. cap. 15. 
                     only vvord: he shal cure al infirmities; he shal raise the dead; he shal make the lame to runne & skippe; the deafe shal heare; the blind shal see, & the dombe speake. In fiue loaues and tvvo fishes, fiue thousand persons shalve satisfied: and the fragmentes shal fil tvvelue baskets, to the hope of many. He shal commande the vvindes, and vvalke vpō the furious sea, vvith his feete of peace. And after diuers other greeke verses to this purpose, she cōcludeth in thes wordes: Mē shal saie, that I am a madde and lying Prophetesse; but vvhen at thes things shal come to passe: then remember mee; for then shal no man say more, that I vvas a liar, but rather the Prophet of the great Gad.
                  
                  To thes predictions of Prophetes in Iurie, and among the Gentiles, doe agree the Doctours of the Iewes them selues, in many places of their Thalmud: to Thal. tract. Beracoth. ca. Mermathas Colin. witte; that the Messias shalbe most wonderful in working miracles. And in their publicke commentarie vpon Ecclesiastes, they haue thes wordes. All the former miracles 
                     Misdrasch Coheleth. cap. 1. 
                     of Prophetes and Saintes, shalbe nothing to the miracles of the Messias, vvhen he cōmeth. And thus much of the fortelling of Christes miracles. But now for the fulfillinge therof in Iesus; that is, how thes predictions were perfourmed in the stupendious workes and actions of our Saueour: ther is no difficultie. For that besides the former testimonie of Iosephus,

(which were sufficient in this case;) the 
                        The confession of Iesus miracles by his enimies. Thalm. in tract. Auoda. Zara. Misdrasch, Coheleth. Alcoran. Azoar. 1. 4. 11. 13. Iewes them selues, doe graunt & recorde Iesus miracles in diuers treatises of their Tha'mud: yea, they make mentiō of many wonderful thinges which Iesus did, that are not writen by our Euangelistes. The same doth Mahomet in his Alcorane; affirming, Iesus the sonne of Marie, to haue bene a great prophet; and to haue wrought his miracles by the only power and spirit of God: and that hym self was sent to confirme Iesus doctrine, sauing only in the point of his godhead; wherin he sayeth, that Iesus went to farre, and had a checke for the same at Gods hand, when he returned to heauen.
                  Thus much doe thes enimies confesse of Iesus miracles. Which, as it is much, cō
                     ming frō such witnesses: so if they would either deny, or dissemble the same; they might be proued agaist thē by most euidēt reasōs; especiallie in two pointes, wherin ther can be no probablitie of denial.
                  The first is, the calling and retaining of his apostles and other followers, The calling of the Apostles. (wherof Iosephus also in the place before alleaged, maketh mention, as of a great miracle;) who were of diuers callinges, states, conditions, trades, and occupations Iosep. li. 18. antiq. c. 4 in the world. And yet all, vpon the suddaine, lefte both father, mother, wife, children, and other temporal respectes; and followed hym, who had nothing to gyue or promisse them in this world. A man, that neuer spake them fayre, nor

vttered doctrine, that was not repugnant to the sensualitie of this life, as may appeare by their owne writinges & testimonies of hym. A mā, that was conténed by the better sorte, as then it might seeme; that is, by the wise and learned of that countrie; & especiallie misliked by them, that were in gouernment, as a dangerous and troublesome man to the state. One, that had neither friendes in the world to beare hym out, nor house to put his head in. And yet, not withstanding all this, that worldlie men and women, and some such also, as were great sinners, and loose liuers before, should leaue all their A greate Miracle. worldlie hope, staye, and condition, to follow such a man, with so great inconueniēces, losses, daungers, and disfauours as they did; and should cōtinue with hym in all his afflictions, and be content to die and lose their liues; rather then forsake hym, or abandone his seruice; this (I saye) is such a miracle, as neuer in the world fell out the lyke, and must needes be graū
                     ted by th' enimie, to be supernatural. The miraculous facts of Ièsus.
                  
                  The second point is of external thinges & factes donne by Iesus, aboue all power of humane abilitie, in the sight & knowledge of all the Iewes; which factes were published by our Euangelistes, and especiallie by S. Mathew, in th' Hebrue tongue, while yet the persons were aliue vpon whom they were wroughte, or infinite other that might be witnesses therof. As for example; the raising of Lazarus in 
                     
Bethania, that was a village, but a mile or Ioh. 11. two distant from Hierusalem; at whose death and burial, (being a Gentleman) manie Scribes and Pharysies must needes be present, (according to the Iuishe custome Ioseph. l. 17 antiq. c. 11. at that tyme reported by Iosephꝰ;) and they sawe hym bothe disceassed, interred, and the funeral feaste obserued for hym; as also raised againe by Iesus after fower dayes of his burial. With whom they did both eate and drinke, and conuerse after his returne to life, and euerie daye might beholde hym walking in the streetes of Hierusalem. This storie (I saye) how could it be feigned?
                  So in like manner the raising of the  Archisinagogues daughter, whose name Math. 9. Marc. 5. is affirmed to be Iairus, with diuers other circumstances that doe make the thinge most notorious. The raysing of the wydows sōne, before the gare of the Citie of  Naim., in the presence of all the people Luc. 7. that bare the Corps, and stoode about it. The healing of the Cripple in Hierusalé,  that had layé 38. yeares lame, at the Pooles syde or bathe, called Probatica: which mira Ioh. 5. cle was donne also in the sight of almost infinite people. The casting out of a legiō 
                      of deuils, from a man that for manie years together, was knowen to liue possessed in the mountaynes; which deuills by peculier licence, obtained of Iesus to enter into a heard of Swyne, & so presentelie; caried two thousand of them awaye into Mat. 8. Marc. 5. the sea and drowned them. Wherupon

the whole countrie about of the people called, Gerasines, being striken with feare vpon sight of the fact: besought Iesus most humblie, to departe from their borders. The feeding & filling of more then 5000  men, besides women and children, with Mar. 14. Luc. 9. fiue barlie loues and two fishes onlie. The turning of water into wine, at the mariage  of Cana, in the presence of all the Guestes. The healing of hym by a word  onlie, that had an incurable dropsie; and Luc. 14. this at the table of a principal Pharisie, and in the sight of all that satt at dinner with hym.
                  Thes (I saye,) and diuers other such miracles, which were donne in the presence and sight of so infinite people, and recorded by our Euangelistes at such tyme, whē manie desyred to discredit the same, and might haue donne easelie, by manie witnesses and authoritie, if anie parte therof had bene subiect to calumniation: can not in reason or probabilitie, be doubted of. And therfore I must conclude, that seing thes thinges are aboue all power of humane The cōclusion of this cōsideratiō. nature, and could not be donne, but by the fingar and vertue of God hym self: considering also, that it is impossible, that God should assiste, or gyue testimonie to falshood: it must needes insue, that all was true and sincere, which Iesus affirmed; & consequentelie, seing he affirmed hym self to be the sonne of God, and the true Messias: it must needes follow by thes miracles, that he was so in deede; which is the

ground of that speech of his, to the faithlesse Pharysies, if you vvill not beleeue my 
                     Ioh. 10. 
                     vvordes, beleeue my deedes. And thus much of Iesus life, doctrine, conuersation, and miracles.
                  THERE REMAINETH now onlie, the THE. 4. Consideration. sowerth and last consideration of this section; which is, the passion, resurrection, and ascension of Iesus. And aboute his passion, THE Passiō and Resurrection. there is litle or no controuersie; for that all his enimies doe agree & graunte, that he was betrayed by his owne disciple; apprehended, afflicted, and deliuered vp by the Iewes; and finallie putt to death vpō a Crosse, by the Gentiles. The testimonie of Iosephus may suffice for all herein. whose wordes are; that the principal Ievves 
                     Ioseph. l. 18. antiq. c. 4. 
                     ofbis countrie, hauing accused and deliuered ouer Iesus to Pilat, (that vvas Gouernour of Iurie for the Roman Emperour;) he adiudged hym to the Crosse. The same doe all other Iewes & Gentiles recorde; and in this they take great offence and scandale, that we should attribute diuinitie, vnto a man that had suffred on the Crosse.
                  But if we shew, that this was th' eternal preordination and appointement of God, for sauing of mankinde; and that the same was fortolde both to Iewe & Gentile from the beginning; and so vnderstood also, by the Iuishe Doctors of elder tymes: then euerie reasonnable man (I trow) will remaine satisfied, and preferre Gods diuine wisdome, before mās follie.
                  First then, consider, that when Christ

had ended his preaching, and wrought so Christes ascendinge to Hierusalē to receaue his passion. Math. 20. & Marc. 8. Mat. 21. manie miracles as seemed sufficient to his eternal wisdome; and when the tyme was come preordained for his passion, (wherof he tolde publiquelie his disciples before;) he went vp to Hierusalem of purpose, to receyue his death; and made a solemne entrie into that Citie vpon an asse; which was prophetied of hym by Zacharie manie yeares before. Reioyce daughter of

                  And after his abode some dayes in that place; he was betrayed and solde by his Mat. 10. & 16. Psal. 40. 54. 108. owne disciple, as Dauid beforehande in manie places had foretolde should come to passe. Then folowed his apprehension and most seruile abusage by the Iewes, wher of it was foreprophitied in his person by Esay: I gaue my bodie to them that beate 
                     Esa. 50. 
                     it; and my cheekes to them that bussited the same. I did not turne my self avvay from them that reproched mee; nor yet from them that did spitte in my sace.
                  
                  After this barbarous intreatie by the Iewes; they deliuered hym ouer to Pilat a Gentile, and neuer ceased to solicite and pursue their vnquenshable hatred The barbarous abusage of Iesus fortolde by prophetie. against him, vntil they sawe him on the Crosse. Where also he was vsed in the highest degree, of spiteful dealīg. Wherof the foresaid Dauid, made mention longe before, in the person of the Messias, when he said: they pearsed my handes and seete; they 
                     Psal. 21. 
                     deuided among them my apparaile; and vpon my
                     
                     (vpper) Garmente they did caste lottes. And aganie, of another crueltie he cōplaineth saing: they gaue me Gaule to eate, and in my 
                           〈◊〉
                         they refreshed me vvith vinegar.
                  
                  And finallie, that Christ should die for Christes death most plainlie fortolde. the sinnes of mankind, ys a common principle bothe prefygured and foretolde throughout all the olde scripture. Prefigured; by the sacrifice of Isaac: by the raising vp of the Brasen Serpent; and by all Gen. 21. 22. other sacrifices that were in that lawe. Fortolde; not onely by the scriptures before Num. 21. aleadged, but also must plainely by Daniel, who was tolde by an Angel, that after a certaine time, by him there apointed; vngetur sanctus senctorum. 
                     The Saint of Saintes shalbe anointed, & occidetur Christus; 
                        Dan. 9. this anointed Saint or Christ, shalbe put to death.Zacharie also about the same time, doth not onely fortel his death; but also the kinde therof, and from what people he should receyue the same: for thus he saith in the person of Christ him self. The 
                     Zach. 12. 
                     inhabitantes of Icrusalem at that daye shal looke vpon me, vvhom they haue Crucisied.
                  
                  But if ye will reade the whole storie of Christs passion set downe at large, The most vvonderful predictiō of Christ his passion by Esay. Esa. 17. 600 yeares before it fel out: I referre you to a narration of Esay, who to signifie the straungnes of the case, begineth with this preface: vvho vvill gyue credit to that vve shal reporte? &c. And then after a litle, he goeth on in thes wordes. He shall mount vp as a tvvigge from a drie earth. He hath no fourme or beautie vpon him. VVe beheld him, and ther
                     
                     vvas no countenance in him; vve savve him the 
                     Christes deformitie vpon the Crosse. 
                     most contemtible and dispised man in the vvorld.
                  
                  
                     A man full of paines, and experienced in infirmitie. His countenance vvas obscure and despicable, and vve made no accompt of him. Truly, he tooke vpon him self our greefes, and did beare our paines. VVe accompted him as a leaper; & as a mā stricken and punished by God. But he vvas vvounded for our iniquities, and crushed in peaces 
                     Christ appointed to die for our synnes. 
                     for our vvickednes. The discipline (or correction) of our peace lieth vpon him: and by his vvoundes, vve are made vvhole. VVe haue all erred, & gone astraye, like sheepe, euery man after his ovvne vvayes; and God hath layde vpon him, the iniquitie of vs all. He vvas offred vp for vs, because he vvould soe; he shalbe led le to his slaughter, as a sheepe; and as a Lambe he shalbe silent before his Shearours.
                  
                  
                     For the sinnes of my people, haue I stricke thyn, saith God. He hath donne no iniquitie; neither vvas there decepte founde in his mouth. Yet vvould our Lord crush hym in infirmitie. But if

the Prophettes of Israel, to that Nation.

Hadars. in Dan. and others, and doe proue further out of the forealleadged prophetie of Daniel, Chap. 9. vers. 27. that after Messias shal haue preached halfe seuen yeares, he shalbe slaine. For that Daniel saith, in halfe 
                     Dan. 9. v. 27. 
                     of seuen yeares, the Hoste & Sacrifice shal cease. Vpon which wordes they comment thus: three yeares and a halfe, shal the presence of God in flesh crie and preach vpon the Mounte Oliuet, and then shal he be slaine. Which wordes the Iewes ordinarie commentarie vpon the Misdrasch Tehilim. Psalmes, doth interpret to be meante of Christs preaching three years & a halfe, before his passion. Which disagreeth verie litle or nothing from the accompte of vs Christians, and of our Euangelistes.
                  And so we see by all that hitherto hath Of the Miracles that fell out in Christ his death and Passion. bene said, that the verie particulers of Christes whole death and Passion, were foretolde most plainlie both to Iewe and Gentile, and acknowledged also by the auncient Doctours of the Iewish nation, before th' effectuatiō therof came to passe. And Sibylla addeth further two particuler miracles, that should fall out in the said Passion of the Messias: to witt; that the

                     veil of the Ievves Temple should breake in tvvo, and that at middaye, there should be darkenes for three houres, ouer all the vvorld. Which thing to haue bene fulfilled at the death of Iesus, not onelie S. Mathew doth assure vs Mat. 17. in his Gospell: but also Eusebius affirmeth, that he had reade the same, worde for

worde recorded in diuers heathē writers. Euseb. in Chron. An. Domi. 3. 2. Phleg. Trallian. Li. 14. Chron. An. 4. Olim. 202. And amongest other he citeth one Phlegō, an exacte Chronicler, that reporteth the same in the 4. yeare of the 202. Olympias; which agreeth iust with the 18. yeare of Tyberius reigne, wherin our Saueour suffered. And he goeth so nighe, as to name the very houres of the daye, which our Euangelistes doe. See Orig. cont. Cels. l. 6. & Suid. in verbo Iesus. & Tere. in Apolog. AEsculus also an olde Astronomer, doth confirme the same, and prooueth moreouer, by the situation and constitution of the Sunne and Moone at that tyme, that no Eclipse could then be naturally. Which thing in like manner, Dionysius Areopagita did obserue in the Dionys. Areop. in cp. verie daye of Christs Passion, being at that tyme but 25. yeares olde, and yet well studdied in Astronomie, as hym self testifieth. And finallie, Lucianus a learned priest of Lucian. praesb. apud. Euseb. Antioche, was accustumed to prouoke the Gentiles to their owne comentaries and stories, for recorde and testimony of those thinges.
                  Ther ensueth now, for ending and confirmation of al that hath bene said and Of Iesus resurrection. prooued before, to adde a worde or two, of Iesus Resurrection. Which point, as of al other it is of most importance: so was it most exactly fortolde both to Iewe and Gentile, and promised by Christ him self in al his speeches, while he was vpon earth. And among the Iewes, it was assured by al the propheties before recited, which do promisse so great aboundāce of glorye, ioye, and triumphe, to Christes.

church after his passion. Which neuer possibly could be fulfilled; onles he had risen from dearh againe. And therfore the said Resurrectiō was prefigured in Ionas, Ionas. 2. together with the time of his abode in the Sepulcher. It was also expressle forshewed by Dauid, affirming, that God vvould 
                     Psal. 15. 
                     not permit his holy one, to see corruption. And after him againe, more plainely by Osee; Osee 6. 
                     he shal quicked vs againe after tvvo daies: in the third day he shal raise vs, and vve shal liue in his sight. And to the Gentiles, Sibyllaieft writen, Lact. lib. 4. Inst. Diuin. cap. 19. not farre from the same time: he shal ende the necessitie of death, by three daies sleepe: and then returning from death to light againe, he shal be the first, that shal shevv the beginning of Resurrection to his chosen: for that by conquering death, he shal bring vs life.
                  
                  Thus much was promissed by Prophets, before Christs appearance. And Iesus to comfort his Disciples and folowers, reiterated Mat. 12. 16. 17. 20. Mar. 8. 9. 10. Luc. 11. 18. Iohan. 2. this promisse againe of him self in many speeches, albeit oftentimes his meaning was not perceaued. Which promisse of returne from death, if it had bene made for some long time to come, (as Mahomet promissed his Sarasins after 800. yeares to reuisite them againe;) albeit the performance were neuer meante: yet might Mahom. in Alcor. Azoar. 17. the salshode lurke in the length of time. But Iesus, assuring all men, that he would rise againe, within three daies: it can not be imagined, but that he sincerely purposed to performe his promisse, for that otherwise, the fraude must soone haue bene

discouered. Now then, let vs cōsider what maner of performance Iesus made hereof.
                  And first the persōs most interessed in the The appearīgs vvhich Iesus made after his resurrection. matter, as they whose total hope, staye, refuge, and felicitie, depended hereof; I meane his appaled, dismaied, and afflicted disciples, doe recount twelue sundrie apparitiōs, which Iesus made vnto them in flesh, after his resurrectiō. The first, was to  Mary Magdalene aparte, when she with Mat. 16. Salome and other women, went and remained with ointments about the Sepulcher. The second, was to all the forsaid  women together, as they returned homewards, Mat. 28. who also were permitted to embrase his feete. The third, was to Simon  Peter alone. The fourth, to the two disciples 1. Cor. 15. Luc. 24. in their iourney to Emaus. The fifth, was to all the Apostles, and other disciples  together, whē the doores were shut.  The sixt, was to the same company againe, Ioa. 20. after eight daies, when Thomas was  with them: at what time also he did both 1. Cor. 15. Ioa. 20. eate and drincke, and suffred his bodie to be handled among them. The seuenth, was  to S. Peter and S. Ihon, with fiue other Ioa. 21. disciples, when they were in fishing; at what time also he vouchsafed to eate with  them. The eight, was to eleuen disciples Mat. 28. at one time, vpon the mounte Thabor in  Galiley. The ninth, was to more then fiue 1. Cor. 15. hundreth brethern at one time, as S. Paule  testifieth. The tenth, was to S. Iames, as the Ibid. same Apostle recordeth. The eleuenth,  was to al his Apostles, disciples, & friends Act. 1.
                     
together, vpon the mount Oliuet by Ierusalem, when in their presence, he ascended vp to heauen. The twelueth and  last, was after his Ascension, vnto S. Paul, as him self beareth witnes. 1. Cor. 15.
                  
                  Al thes apparitions are recorded in Scripture, as made by Iesus after his Resurrection, to such as by his eternal wisdome, were preordained to be witnesses of so glorious a spectacle. To whom as S. Act. 1. Luke affirmeth, he shevved him self aliue by many argumentes, for the space of 40 dayes together, and reasoned vvith them of the kingdome of his father. And why any mā should mistrust the testimonie of thes men that sawe him, conuersed with him, eate with him, touched him, and heard him speake; & whos entire estate and welfare depēded wholy of the certaintie hereof: I see no reason. For what comfort had it bene or consolation to thes men, to haue deuised of them Circumstā

What encouragemēt might they haue takē, in thos doleful times of desolation and afflictiō, to haue had among them, the dead bodie of him, on whos only life their vniuersal hope and confidence depended? The Scribes & Pharisees, beīg a stonished with the sudaine newes of his rising againe, cō
                     firmed vnto them by their owne souldiars that sawe it: found no other waie to resist the fame therof, but onely by saying, (as also their posteritie doe vnto this dave,) that his disciples came by night, and stole away his bodie, whiles the souldiours

were a sleepe. But what likelihood or possibilitie can there be in this? For first, it is euident to al the world, that his Apostles thēselues, (who were the heads of al the rest,) were so dismaied, discomforted, and deiected at that time; as they durst not once goe out of the dore. For which cause, only thos seely women, who for their sexe esteemed them selues more free from violence; presumed alone to visite his Sepulcher, which no one man durst for feare of the souldiours; vntil by thos women they were informed, that the forsaid band of souldiours were terrefied and put to flight by Christes Resurrection.
                  And how then was it likely, that men Greate improbabilitics. so much amazed & ouercome with feare, should aduenture to steale a bodie from a Guarde of Souldiours that kept it? Or if their hartes had serued them to aduenture so greate a daunger: what hope or probabilitie had ther bene of successe? especiallie, consideringe the said bodie lay e in a new sepulcher of stone, shutt vp and locked, and fast sealed by the Magistrate? How was it possible (I say) that his disciples should come thyther? breake vp the Monument? take out his bodie? and carie the same away, neuer after to be sene or founde, without espial of some one amō
                     gest so many that attended ther? Or if this were possible, (as in reason it is not;) yet what profite, what pleasure, what comfort, could they receaue hereby? We see that thes apostles and disciples of his,

who were so abandoned of life and hart in his Passion: after two dayes onlie, they were so changed; as life and death can be no more contrarie.
                  For, wheras before they kept home in The great change in Iesus disciples, by his resurrectiō. all feare, and durst appeare no wher, except amonge their owne priuate friēdes: now they came foorth into the streetes and common places, and auouched with all alacritie, and irresistible constancie; euen in the faces and hearinge of their greatest enimies; that Iesus was rysen frō death to life; that they had sene hym; spoken with hym; and enioyed his presence. And that for restimonie and confirmation hereof, they were most redie to spēd their liues. And could all this (trow you) proceede onlie, of a dead bodie, which they had gotten by stealth into their possession? Would not rather the presence and sight of such a bodie; so torne, mangled, & deformed as Iesus bodie was both vpō the Crosse and before; haue rather dismayed them more, then haue gyuen them cōfort? Yes trulie. And therfore Pilat the Gouernour, considering thes circumstances; and that it was vnlikelie, that either the bodie should be stolne without priuitie of the Souldiars; or if it had bene; that it should Th' examinatiō of the matter by Pilate. yeeld such life, hart, consolation, & courage to the stealers: beganne to gyue eare more diligentelie to the matter; and calling to him the Souldiars that kept the watch, vnderstoode by them the whole truth of th' accident: to witt; that in their

sight and presence, Iesus was risen out of his sepulcher to life, and that at his rising, ther was so dreadful an earth-quacke, with trembling & opening of sepulchers rounde about; such skriches, cries, & cō
                     motion of all elementes: as they durst not abyde longer, but ranne and tolde the Iuishe magistrates therof, who being greatelie discontented (as it seemed) with th' aduertisement; gaue them money to saye, that while they were sleeping, the bodie was stolne by his disciples frō them.
                  All this wrote Pilate presentlie to his Lord Tyberius, then Emperour of Rome. Pylates letter to Tyberius, and his proceeding thervpon. And he sent withal, the particuler examinations and confelsions of diuers other, that had sene and spoken with such as were risen from death at the same tyme, and had appeared to many of their acquaintance in Hicrusalem, assuring them also, of the resurrection of Iesus. Which informations when Tyberius th' Emperour had considered, he was greatelie moued therwith, & proposed to the Senate, that Iesus might be admitted among the rest of the Roman Godes; offering his owne consent, with the priuiledge of his supreme royal suffrage to that decree. But the Senate in no wise would agree therunto. Whervpon Tyberius being offended, gaue licence to all men to beleeue in Iesus that would; and forbydde vpō paine of death, that anie officer or other, should molest or trouble such as bare good affectiō,

zeale, or reuerence to that name. Thus much testifiethe Tertulian againste the Tertul. in apolog. pro Christian. Gentiles of his owne knowledge; who liuing in Rome, a learned man, & pleader of causes, diuers years before he was a Christian; (which was about 180. yeares after Christes Ascension;) had great abilitie by reason of th' honour of his familie, learning, and place wherin he liued, to see and know the recordes of the Romās. And the same doth cōfirme also Egesippus, Egesip. l. 1. hist. Euseb. l. 4. c. 21. Rutsin. l. 1. c. 22. an other Auncient writer, of no lesse authoritie then Tertulian, before whom he liued.
                  Neither onlie diuers Gentiles had this opinion of Iesus resurrection againe from death, but also sundrye Iewes of great Th' opinion of the vviser sorte of Ievves touchinge Iesus resurrectiō ī that time. credite and wisdome at that tyme, were inforced to beleeue it; notwithstanding it pleased not God to gyue them so much grace, as to become Christians. This appeareth plainelie by the learned Ioiephus, who writing his storie not aboue fortie years after Christs Passion, tooke occasion to speake of Iesus and of his disciples. And after he had shewed how he was Crucified by Pilat, at th' instance of the Iewes; and that for all this, his disciples ceased not to loue hym still: he adioyneth furth with these wordes. Idcirco iliis tertio die vita resumpta, denuo apparuit. That Ioseph. l. 14 antiq. c. 4. is, for this loue of his disciples, he appeared vnto them againe the third daye, whē he had resumed life vnto hym. Which expresse, plaine, and resolute wordes, we

may in reason take, not as the consession onlie of Iosephus, but as the common iudgement, opinion, and sentence of all the discrete and sober men of that tyme, layed downe and recorded by this Historiographer. In whose dayes ther were yet manie Christians a lyue, that had seene & spoken with Iesus after his resurrection; and infinite Iewes, that had heard the same protested by their fathers, brethren, kinlfolke, & friends, who had bene them selues Eye-witnesses therof.
                  AND thus hauinge declared and prooued the resurrection of our Saue our Iesus, Of Iesus Ascēsion. both how it was forshewed, as also fulfilled: there remaineth nothing more of necessitie to be said in this Section. For that, who soeuer seeth and acknowledgeth, that Iesus beinge deade, could rayse hym selfe againe to life: will easilie belieue also that he was able to ascende to heauē. Wherof, notwithstandinge, S. Luke alleageth Act. 1. six skore witnesses at the leaste, in whose presence he ascended from the toppe of the mount Oliuet, after 40 dayes space which he had spent with them, frō the tyme of his resurrection. He alleageth also, the appearing of two Angels among Lykelihodes of truthe. all the people, for testimonie therof. He nameth the day, and place, when, & wher it happened. He recompteth the verie wordes, that Iesus spake at his Ascension. He telleth the maner how he ascended, and how a cloude came downe and receiued hym into it. He declareth what the

multitude did, whether they went, and in what place they remained after their departure thence. And finallie, he setteth downe so manie particulers; as it had bene th' easiest matter in the world, for his enimies to haue refuted his narration, if all had not bene true. Neither was ther any to receyue more dōmage by the falsehood therof, then hym self and thos of his profession, if the matter had bene feigned.
                  Wherfore to conclude at length this treatise of the Birth, Life, Doctrine, Actiōs, The cōclusion of this secōd sectiō. Death, Resurrection, and Ascenciō of Iesus: seing nothing hath happened in the same, which was not fortolde by the prophets of God; nor any thing forshewed by the same prophetes concerninge the Messias, whiche was not fulfilled most exactly, within the compase and course of Iesus abode vpon earth: we may most certainly assure our selues, that as God can neither foretell an vntruth, nor yelde testimonie to the same: so can it not bee, but that thes things which we haue shewed to haue bene so manifestly fore-prophesied, and so euidently accomplished: must needs a-certaine vs, that Iesus was the true Messias. Whiche thing shal vet more particulerly appeare, by that which ensewed by his power and vertue, after his Ascention; which shalbe the argumēt of the section that foloweth.

In which kinde, albeit I might treate of many and almost infinite branches: yet for order and breuities sake, I meane only to take in consideration, thes fewe that ensue. Wherin not only the power of Iesus, but also his loue, his care, his prouidence, and most perfect accomplishment of all his promisses; and finallie, the iustificatiō of all his speeches, prophesies, and doctrines vpon earth, haue bene declared.
                  And to reduce what is to be said herein, to some order and methode; it is to be noted, that in the first place shalbe considered the sustentation, protection, encrease, and The diuisiō of the particuler considerations insuinge. continuation of Iesus litle Church and kingdome, that him self first planted and left vpon earth.

The whole Citie was bent against them: them selues were poore and simple people; and diuers of them womē: Lands or Reuenues they had not to mainteine them; nor friends in Court to gyue them countenance against their enimies. The name of Iesus was most odious; and who soeuer did fauour him, was accompted a Traitour & ennemie to the state. There wanted not (perhaps) among them, who considering the great multitude, would imagine with themselues, what should become of them; wher they should finde to maintaine & sustaine

them; what should be the ende of that The state of Christs first Church. feeble congregation? For abrode they durst not goe, for feare of persecution: & continue long together, they might not, for want of necessaries. Besides that, euery houre they expected to be molested and drawē forth, by Catchpoles & Officiers. And albeit, in thes distresses, the freshe memorie of Iesus, and his sweet promisses made vnto them at his departure; as also the delectable presence of his blessed mother, and her often evhortations and encouragements vnto them, did comfort them greately, as wel may be supposed: yet to him that by humane reason, should ponder and weigh their present state and condition: it could not chuse but seme hard, and no waies durable.

By whos comming, besides the internal ioye, and incredible alacritie and exultation of minde; they receyued also fortitude, and audacitie, to goe forth into the world. They receyued the gift of tongues, enabling them to conuerse and deale with al sortes of people.

Whereof not long after, a man as learned, as euer was any conuerted from paganisme to Christianitie, beareth recorde in his defense to an Emperour and his officers, who according to the nature of persecutours, accōpted Christians for Traitours to his state and dignitie. Which vulgar obiection, this forsaid learned man refuteth in thes wordes.
                  If we were enemies to your estate; you Tertuliā in Apolog. ad gentes. might well seeke new Cities & Coūtries wherof to beare gouernment; for that you should haue in your Empire, more ennemies then Citizens. We haue filled your Townes, your Cities, your Prouinces, your Ilādes: your Castles, your Forteresses, your Tentes, your Campes: your Courtes, your Pa laces, your Senates, and your market

places. Only we haue left your idolatrous temples vnto your selues; al other places are ful of Christians. If we were enemies, what dangerous warres might we make against you (albeit our number were farre lesse,) who esteeme so litle of our liues, as to offer our selues daily to be slaine at your handes? This then is your safetie in very deed; not your persecuting of vs, but that we are honest, patient, and obedient; and that it is more lauful in Christian religion, to be killed, then to kill.
                  By which wordes of Tertulian, in this The vvonderfull quicke increase of Christes Church. first beginnings and infancie (as it were) of Christian religion, (for he liued in the second age after Christ;) we see how this litle flocke and kingedome of Iesus was increased, not withstanding all the resistance and violence of the world against it. Which appeareth by the same Tertulian, In praesae. Apolog. to haue bene such; & was euen at that tyme when he wrote those wordes; (the fowerth persecution being then in most furie:) as all the malefectours of the world together, had not so much rigour shewed against them; as had the most innocent Christiā that liued, for confeising onlie that name and religion.
                  This then declared must apparentelie, that it could not proceede, but of some diuine power and supernatural assistance, that in so shorte a space; amiddest the contradiction and opposition of so manie aduersaires; amōge the whippes, & swordes

and tortures, of so greate, potent, and violent persecutours: this poore, simple, and feeble cōgregatiō, should pearse through, and augment it self so strongelie. Especiallie if we cōsider th' outwarde meanes Th' īcrease of Christiās against nature. of this increase; wherein ther was nothing to allure or cōtent mans nature: nothing gorgeous, nothinge delectable, nothinge to please or entertaine sensualitie.
                  We reade of an Emperour, that takinge in hande to conquer the world, made this Plutarch. in Apoth. Prisc. regum. The proclamation of Cyrus Monarche of Media.
                      Proclamation for winninge men vnto his partie. Who soeuer will come and be my Seruaunt; if he be a footeman, I will make hym a horsman. If he be a horsman, I will make hym ryde with Coches. If he be a Farmour, I will make hym a Gentleman. If he possesse a cotage, I will gyue hym a village. If he haue a village, I will gyue hym a Cittie. If he be Lorde of a Cittie, I will make hym Prince of a regiō & countrie. And as for Gold, I wil power it foorth vnto them by heapes & weight, and not by number.
                  
                  This was Cyrus edict and proclamation to his followers: very glorious (as we see) in pompe of wordes and ostentation Iesus proclamation. of stile. Let vs now compare the proclamation of Iesus, whos entrance and preface was; Paenitētiā agite: doe ye penāce. Math. 3. Ioh. 16. And then it followed; In hoc mundo pressuram habebitis: In this world you shall receyue affliction. And then after againe; they shal vvhippe and murder you. And yet further: you shalbe hateful in the sight of all 
                     Math. 10.
                     
                     mē, for my sake. Thē is ther adioy ned: he that 
                     Luc. 9. 
                     loueth his life, shal loose his soule. After that ensweth: he that vvil follovv me, must beare his Crosse. And finallie the cōclusion is: he that 
                     Luc. 1. 
                     cōmeth to me, and doth not hate his father, his mother, his vvife, his children, his brethrē, his sisters, as also his ovvne life; he is not vvorthie to be my seruant.
                  
                  This was the entertainment proposed by Iesus, to such as would come and serue vnder his Banner: with expresse protestatiō, that hym self was sent into the world, Math. 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      not to bring peace, rest, and ease to flesh and blood, but rather to be the cause of sworde, fire, tribulation, combat, & enmitie. And yet, with thes colde offers, presented to the world by poore, abiecte, & most contemptible officers; and by this doctrine, so Crosse and opposite to mans nature, inclination, and sensual appetite: he gained more hartes vnto hym, within the space of fortie yeares, as hath bene said; then euer did Monarche in the world possesse louing subiectes, by what soeuer temporal alluremente they did or might propose. Which argueth most euidently, the omnipotent puissance of hym, that contrary to mans reason, could bring to passe so miraculous a conquest.
                  THER FOLOVVETH in order, the cō
                     sideration THE. 2. Consideration. OF Christs Apostes. of Christs Apostles; which in some respect, may be said more straunge and wonderful, then the former, in that they being both rule, and simple, and vnletteredmen, (& for the most parte, of the

baser sort,) should be chosen and assigned to so great a worke, as was the conuersiō of all Countries and Natiōs; and to stand in combat with the power, learning, and wisdome of all the world. Neither only had they to contend and fight against their enemies, but also to direct and gouerne and menage al thos, who should be adioyned to their maisters kingdome. To which charge they seemed so vnto warde and insufficient, in al that time wherin they liued with him vpon earth: as by their questions and demandes made vnto him 2 litle before his passion: they might appeare to haue learned very litle, in three whole years conuersation and instructiō; and in very deed, to be incapable of so high mysteries and functions.
                  Yet notwithstanding, thes men who of them selues were so weake and impotent; after strength and confirmation receyued by the descending of Gods holy spirit into them; became so perfect, able, and most excellent men: as they brought the whole world in admiration of them. Not only, by the most exquisite perfectiō of their doctrine, (wherin of a sudaine, without studie, they excelled and conuinced the greatest Philosophers then liuing;) but also, and that especially, by the rare and stupendious Miracles, which they wrought in the sight of al men. The contemplation wherof, as S. Luke reporteth, Act 2. droue the beholders not only into great meruaile, but also into feare and exceeding

terrour.
                  And for example, he recompteth the Th' apostles Miracles. restoring of a lame mā at the Temple gate of Ierusalem, which had bene a Criple for the space of fortie yeares or more, and the miracle dōne and testefied, in the presence and knowledge of all the Citie. He recordeth also, the dreadful death of Ananias Act. 3. and Saphira by the only speech and voice of S. Peter: as īn like maner, the healīg of infinite sicke people, by the presence & Act. 5. shadowe of the same Apostle. He reporteth the most wonderful deliuerance of the said S. Peter out of the hands and prison of Herode by an Angel. The varietie of lāguages, which all th' Apostles spake The visible descending of the holy Ghost vpon al such, on whom the said Apostles did but laie their handes. The miraculous conuersiō of S. Paul, by Christs appearing 1. Cor. 15. 2. Cor. 12. Act. 9. 22. 26. vnto him in the way when he went to persecute. Of which miracle, S. Paul protested in euery place afterward, and once especiallie, in open audience and iudgement before Agrippa the king, and Festus Gouernour of Iurie.
                  Thes miracles and manie moe are recorded by S. Luke; wherof some part were sene by him self, and the rest most euident to all the worlde, as dōne in publique before infinite witnesses. Neither is it possible they could be forged, for that (as in the like I haue noted before,) it had bene most easye to haue refelled them, and therby to haue discredited the whole

proceedings of Christian religion, in thos first beginnings. As for example; if the miracle of Peters deliuery forth of the handes The Miracls reported of th' Apostles, could not be feigred. and prison of Herod Agrippa, had any way bene to be touched with falsehood: how many would ther haue bene of Herodes Officiers, Courtiars, seruantes, or friends, that for defence of their Princes honour, (so deeply tainted by this narratiō of S. Luke, published not lōg after the thig was dōne:) how many (I say) would haue offred them selues to refuce and disgrace the writer therof, hauing so pregnant meanes by publike recorde to doe the same? So againe, wheras the same Luke reporteth of his owne knowledge, that in a Citie of Macedonie, named Philippi, S. Paul & Silas after many miracles dōne, Act. 16. were whipped and put in prison, with a diligēt guarde in the lowest prison of al; their feete locked fast in stockes of tymber; and that at midnight when Paul and Silas beganne to pray, the whole prison was shaken, and all the dores throwen open; as also the gyues, not only of thos two, but of al the other prisoners vpon a sudaine burst in sunder; & that therupon, not only the Iayler cast him self at the feete of Paul, but the Magistrates also, (who the daie before had caused them to be whipt,) came and asked them pardon, and entreated them to depart from their Citie: This storie (I say) if it had bene false; ther needed no more for consutatiō therof, but only to haue examined the

whole Citie of Philippi, which could haue testified the contrary.
                  And yet amongst so many aduersaries, None euer durst impugne the Miracles of our Apostles, but by calumniation. & eager impugners of Christian religiō, as Gods enemie stirred vp in the primatiue Church, of all sortes and sectes of people: no one euer appeared, that durst attempt to take in hand, the particuler improouing of thes or the like miracles; but rather confessing the factes; sought alwayes to discredite them, by other sinister calumniations: namely and commonlie; that they were wrought by the deceits and sleights of art magike. Thus said the Iewes of the miracles of Iesus; and so Mat. 12. said Iulian th' Apostata, of the wonderful Apud Ciryl. li. 1. cōt. Iulia. Aug. lib. de vera Relig. straunge thinges done by S. Peter, and S. Paul; affirming them to haue bene the most expert in Magike, of any that euer liued; and that Christ wrote a special booke of that profession, and dedicated the same to Peter and Paul; wher as notwithstanding, it is most euident, that Paul was a persecutour diuers yeares after Christ departed. One Hierocles also wrote a booke, Euseb. lib. cōt. Hiero. wherin he feigneth Appolonius Tyanaeus to haue done the like miracles by Magicke, which Christ and his Apostles did by diuine power. And finally, it is a general opinion, that both Nero and Iulian gaue them selues so extremely to the studie of that vaine science, as no men euer did the like; vpon emulation onely of the miracles done in Rome by Peter and Paul when Nero liued, and by other Saintes &

disciples, in the time of Iulian.
                  But what was the ende? Plinie that was a Pagane, writeth thus of Nero; that Plin. lib. 30. Nat. hist. cap. 1. as no man euer laboured more then he in that science: so no man euer left a more certaine testimonie of the maruailous exceeding vanitie therof. The like in effect Zosimus in cit. Iulia. writeth Zosimus of Iulian, albeit him self a malitious heathen. And if it were not writen; yet their seueral extraordinarie calamities, and most miserable deathes, which by al their Magike they could not forsee: doth sufficiently testifie the same vnto vs; especially the last words of Iulian; Vicisti Galilae, vicisti. Thou hast woune Niceph lib. 10. cap. 35. histo. (ô Galilaean,) thou hast gotten the victorie. Acknowleging therby, as well the truth of Christs miracles and of his folowers, as also the vanitie, follie, and madnes, of his owne endeuours.
                  Thus then went foreward Christs The successe of th' Apostles. Marc. 16. Apostles, and preached him euery wher throughout the world: Domino cooperate, & sermonem confirmante, sequentibus signis, that is, (as S. Marke affirmeth;) Our Lord Iesus working with them, & confirming their preaching by signes & miracles. In respect of which benigne assistance of Iesus in their actions; S. Luke saieth further; they 
                     Act. 14. 
                     dealt most confidently in our Lord; his vvord of grace giuing testimonie to their doinges, and shevving forth signes and most prodigious vvonders hy their handes. No pers cution, no terrour, no threats of enemies, no difficultie, or daunger that might occurre; could staie

them from their course of setting foorth Christs name and glorie. And they were so assured of the truth, by the inward illuminations which they had, and by this Th'

                      certaine testimonie of Gods fauour and assistance in doing miracles: as one of thē writeth thus: That vvhich vve haue eard, vvhich vve haue sene vvith our eyes, vvhich vve

In which verie name, he tooke so exceedig great delight; as in a few Epistels which he left writē; he is obserued to haue vsed this sentence, Dominus noster Iesus Christus, aboue two hundred tymes.
                  Neither endured this in thes Apostles, for a time onlie, but all their liues, which The ioyful andinze of th' Apostles. as they spent with alacritie in the seruice of Iesus: so inthe ende they gaue vp the same most cherefully, to what soeuer death presented it self, for cōformation &

sealing of their former doctrine; neuerso ful of cōfidence, courage, and consolatiō, as at that houre; nor euer so boldly denouncing 2. Tim. 4.

                        . Thes. 2. their Maister, or talking so ioyfully of rewardes, Crounes, &c Kigdomes; as at the verie last instant and vpshot of their wordly combat. This thé declareth most manifestly, that the actions of thes men, proceeded not of humane spirit, nor could be perfourmed by the power of má; But by the diuine force and supernatural assistance of their Lord and God, whom they confessed.
                  AND THVS MVCHE in brauitie, of Christs Apostles. Ther ensue his Euangelistes; that THE. 3. Consideration. OF th' Euāgelistes. is, such men, as haue lefte vnto vs writen, his birth, life, doctrine, & death. Wherin is to be noted, that lesus being God, tooke a different way from the custome of man, in deliuering vnto vs, his lawes and preceptes. For that men, who haue bene lawmakers vnto the worlde, knew no surer way of publishing their lawes, and procuring authoritie to the same; then to write them with their owne handes, and in their life time to establishe their promulgation. So Lycurgus, Solon, & others among the Grecians: Numa to the Romanes: Mahomet to his Sarasins: and diuers other in like maner. But Iesus to Iesus lest nothing vvriten by hym seif. shew his Diuine power in directing the penne and stile of his Euangelistes, would not leaue any thing writing him self, but passed from this world in simplicitie and filence, whithout any further shewe or

ostentatiō of his own doings; meaning notwithstāding, by his eternal wisdome, that the prophetie of Ezechiel should be Ezec. 1. fulfilled, which foresignified the being of his fowre irrefragable witnesses, which daie and night without rest, should preache, extolle, and magnifie their Lord and Maister, to the worldes ende.
                  Foure then were fore-prophetied, and foure (as we see) by Gods prouidence The different qualities, & circumstances of the 4. Euāgelists. were prouided, to fulfil the same prophetie. The first and last, are two Apostles, that wrote as they had sene. The two midle, are two diseiples, who registred thinges, as they had vnderstoode by conference with the Apostles. The first Ghospel was written by an Apostle; to giue light & open the waie to al the rest: And the last, in like maner was written by an Apostle; to giue authoritie and confirmation to al the former. The first was writtē in Hebrue or Iewish tongue, for that Iesus actions were dóne in that countrie; to th' ende that therby, eyther the whole Nation might beleeue them, or the obstinate impugne them. The other three, were written in the publique tongues of al other nations; that is, in the Greeke and Romane languages: if it be true (See Armacan. l. 9. de quaest. which diuers holde,) that S. Marcs Ghospel was first written in Latin.
                  They wrote their stories in diuers countries, eche one remaning farre distant frō 
                     Circumstā
                        ces of truth in our Euā
                        gelistes. an other; and yet agreed they al (as we see) most exactly, in the verie same narration.

They wrote in diuers times, the one after the other; and yet the later, did neither correct nor reprehend anie thing ithe former. They published their stories, when infinite were aliue that knew the factes, and many more that desired to impugne them. They set doune in most of their particuler narrations, the time, the day, the houre, the place, the village, the house, the persons, the men, the women, and other the like. Which circumstances, the more they are in number, the more easie to be refuted, if they were not true. Neither did they in Iurie write of thinges done in India; but in the same countrie it self; in Townes & Cities that were publiquely knowen; in Bethania, and Bethsaida, villages hard by Ierusalem; in the Suburbes and hiles about the Citie; in such a Streete, at such a Gate, in such a Porch of the Temple, at such a fishpoole, which al people in Ierusalem did euery daie beholde.
                  They published their writinges in their owne life time; and preached in worde, so much as in writing they had recorded. The publishing of our Ghospelles. They permitted the same to the iudgment and examination of al Christs church; especially of the Apostles, who were able to discerne euerie least thing therin contained. So Marke set forth his Ghospel, by the instruction and approbation of S. Peter: as also did Luke, by the authoritie of Hieron. in catalog. Script. Eccles. S. Paul. They altered not their writinges afterward, as other authours are wont, in

their later editions: nor euer corrected they anie one iote of that which they had first set doune. And that which neuer happened, in any other writinges in the world besides; nor euer Prince or Monarch was able to bring to passe, for credite of his edictes or sanctions: they gaue their liues, for defence and iustefying of that they had written.
                  Their maner of writing is sincere and simple; without al arte, amplification, or The maner of style in our Euāgelistes. Rhetorical exornatiō. They flatter none; no not Iesus him self, whom they most adore; nor in confessing him to be their God and Creatour, doe they conceale his infirmities of fleshe, in that he was man; as Mat. 21. Marc. 2. Iohn. 7. Luc. 19. his hunger and thirst; his being wearie; how he wept; his passions of feare; and the like. So lykewise, in the Apostles that were the gouernours, superiours, and heads of al the rest; doe thes Euangelistes dissemble, hide, or passe ouer no such thinges as were defects and might seeme to worldlie eies, to turne to their discredites. As for exāple; how Christ rebuked them for their dulnes in vnderstanding: how after long instruction, they proposed notwithstanding verie rude and impertinent Marc. 15. Iohn. 10. 11. & 20. questions vnto him: how Thomas would not beleeue the attestation of his fellowes: how S. Ihon and S. Iames the sonnes of Zebedee, ambitiouslie sollicited to haue the preheminence of sitting nearest to Christ ī his glorie. Which later Marc. 10. clause, beīg set doune clearly by S. Marke,

while yet S. Ihon the Apostle was liuing: the same was neuer denied nor taken yll by the said Apostle, neither S. Markes Ghospel the lesse approued by him, albeit he liued longest, and wrote last of al the rest.
                  Nay, which is more, and greatly (no A special point to be obserued in our Euangelistes. doubt) to be obserued; thes Euangelistes were so sincere and religious in their narrations: as they noted especiallie the impersections of them selues, and of such other, as they principally respected. So S. Mathew, nameth him self Mathevv the Publican. And so S. Marke, being Peters disciple, Mat. 10. Narc. 14. recordeth particulerly, how S. Peter thrise denied his maister. S. Luke, that was scholler and dependent of S. Paul, maketh mention alone, of the litle differences betwene Paul and Barnabas; & in the storie Act. 15. of S. Stephens death, after al his narration ended; he addeth a clause that in humane iudgement might haue bene left out, to witt; Saulus erat consentiës neci eius. Saul was Act. 7. cōsenting & culpable of Stephens death. Wherby we may perceaue most perspicuouslie, that as thes men were plaine, sincere, and simple, and farre from presuming to deuise any thinge of them selues: so were they religious, and had scruple to passe ouer or leaue oute any thinge of the truth, in fauour of them selues, or of any other whosoeuer.
                  Thes mens writinges then, were published & receyued for vndoubted truth, by all that liued in the verie same age, and

were pryuie to the particulers therin cō
                     teined. They were copied abrode into infinit mens handes, and so conserued with all care & reuerence, as holie and diuine scripture. They were read in churches, throughout all countries and Nations; expounded, preached, and taught by all pastours; and commentaries made vpon No doubt, but that vve haue the true vvritinges of our Euā
                        gelistes. them by holie fathers from tyme to tyme. So that no doubt can be made, but that we haue the verie sa ne writinges incorrupt, as th' authours left them: for that it was impossible for anie enimie to corrupt so manie Copies ouer al the world, without discoucrie and resiitance. And the same very text, wordes, and sentences, which from age to age, the learned fathers doe alleage out of thes scriptures, we fynde them now, as they had them at that tyme. As for example; S. Iohn that lyued longest of all th' Apostles and Euangelistes, had amōge other schollers and auditours, Papias, Ignatius, & Policarpus; al which agree of the foure Ghospels, and other writinges left vnto vs in the newe Testament; affirming S. Iohn to haue approued the same. These men were maisters againe to Iustinus Martyr, Irenaeus, and other, whose writinges remaine vnto vs. And if they did not; yet their sayinges and iudgementes touching the Scriptures, are recorded vnto vs by Eusebius and other fathers of the next age after, and so from Fuseb. li. 5. hist. cap. 15. hand to hand vntil our dayes. So, that of this, ther can be no more doubt, then

whether Rome, Constantinople, Hierusalem, and other such renoumed Cities knowen to al the world at this day; be the very same, wherof Authours haue treated so much in auncient times.
                  AND THVS MVCHE of Christs Euangelistes; THE. 4. Consideration. OF Martyrs. for whose more credit, and for confirmation of thinges by them recorded; his diuine prouidence preordained, that infinite witnesses, (whom we cal Martyrs,) should offer vp their blood in the primatiue Churche and after. Wheras for no other doctrine, profession, or religion in the world, the like was euer heard of, albeit among the Iewes, in the tyme of the Machabies, and at some other Machab. li. & 2. tymes also, when that nation for their sinnes were aff

                     icted by Heathen Princes, some fewe were tyrannized and iniuriouslie put to death: yet commonly, and for the most parte, this was rather of barbarous furie in the Paganes for their resistāce, thē directly for hatred of Iuishe religiō. And for the number, ther is no doubt, but that more Christians were putt to death, within two monethes for their beliefe throughout the world; then were of Iewes in two thouland yeares before Christs comming. Which is vndoubtedly a matter verie wounderful; considering, that the Iuishe religion impugned no lesse the Pagan Idolatrie, then doth the doctrine of the Christians. But this came to passe, that Christes wordes might be fulfilled, who said; I come not to bring peace, but 
                     Mat. 5.
                     
                     the svvorde. And againe; I sende you forth as 
                     Math. 10. 
                     sheepe among vvolues. That is to saye; to be torne and harried, and your bloud to be deuoured. Thre points. to be cōsidered in our Martyrs.
                  
                  In which extreme and most incredible sufferinges of Christians, thre pointes are worthie of great consideration. The first, what infinite multitudes of al states, conditions, sexe, qualities, and age, did suffer dailie fortestimonie of this truth. The second; See the narratiō of Philaeas by shope in Affrica touching this pointe, alleaged by Eusebius. l. 8. hist. cap. 11. & 12. What intollerable and vnacustomed tormentes, not hard of in the worlde before, were deuised by Tyrantes for afflicting this kinde of people. The third; what inuincible courage, and vnspeakable alacritie the Christiās shewed, in bearing oute these afflictions, which the enimies theselues could not attribute, but to some diuine power and supernatural assistance.
                  And for this later point of comfort in their sufferings, I will alleage onlie this The singu ler alacri tie of Chri stians, in their suffe ringes. Tertul. in apolog. c. 1.
                      testmonie of Tertuliā against the Gētiles; who obiected, that wicked men suffered also, as wel as Christians. Wherto this learned Doctour made answere in these wordes. Truth it is, that many men are prone to yl, and do suffer for the same: but yet dare they not defend their euil to be good as Christiās doe their cause. For that euery euil thig by nature, doth bring with it either feare or shame: & therfor we see, that malefactours, albeit they loue euill; yet would they not appeare so to the world, but desire rather to lie in couert. They tremble when they are taken; and

when they are accused, they deny all, and do scarse oftentimes cōfesse their doings vpon torments. And finally, when they are condemned, they lament, mone, and do impute their il fortune to destinie, or to the planets. But the Christian, what doth he like to this? Is their any man ashamed? or doth any man 'repent him when he is taken, except it be for that he was not taken rather? If he be noted by the enemy for a Christian; he glorieth in the same: if he be accused; he defendeth not him self: if he be asked the question; he confesseth it willingly: if he be cōdemned; he veldeth thankes. What euil thē is ther in this Christian cause, which lacketh the natural sequele of euil? I meane, feare, shame, tergiuersatiō, repentance, sorowe, and deploration? what euil (I say) can this be deemed, whose guiltines is ioye? whose accusation, is desire? whose punishment, is happines?
                  
                  Hitherto are the wordes of learned Tertulian, who was an eye-witnes of that Iesus assistance to his Martyrs. he wrote, & had no smal part in the cause of thos that suffred, being him self in that place and state, as daily he might expect to taste of the same affliction. To which combat, how redie he was, may appeare by diuers places of this his Apologie, wherin he vttereth, (besides his zeale & feruour,) a most confident securitie, and certaine assurance of Iesus assistance, by that which he had sene performed to infinite other in their greatest distresses, from the same

Lord before. So that nothing doth more a-certaine vs of the diuine power and omnipotencie of Iesus; then the fortitude inuincible, which aboue al humane reason, force, and nature, he imparted to his Martyrs.
                  
                     AFTER VVHICH consideration, there THE. 5. Consideration. THE subiection of spirites. cōmeth to be weighed, the fifte point before mentioned, which is, of the same power and omnipotēcie of Iesus, declared and exercised vpon the spirites insernal. Which thing, partely may appeare by the Oracles alleaged in the ende of the former section, (wherin thos spirites foretolde, that an Hebrew Childe should be borne, to the vtter subuersion and ruine of their Tyrānical dominion:) And much more at large the same might be declared, by other answers & Oracles vttered after Christes natiuitie and registred in the monumentes euen of the heathens them selues. Wherof he that desireth to see more ample mention, (especially out of Porphyrie, who then was liuing,) let him read Eusebius sixte booke de preparatione Euangelica, where he shal finde store; and namely, that Apollo many times exclamed Hei mihi, congemiscite: Hei mihi; hei mihi; Oraculorum defecit me claritas. 
                     Woe vnto me; lament yee with me: woe vnto me; woe vnto me; for that the honour of Oracles hath now foresakē me. Which cōplaintes and lamentations, are nothinge els but a plaine confession, that Iesus was he, of whom a prophet said diuers ages before,
                        Attenuabit omnes Deos terrae: he shal weareout & bring to beggarie, al the Godes or Soplo. 2. Idols of the earth.
  This confessed also the wicked spirites them selues, when at Christs appearing ī Iurie, they came vnto him at diuers times, and besought him, not to afflict or torment them, nor command them presently to returne to hel; but rather, to permit them some litle time of entertainment, in the sea or mountaines, or amōg heardes of swine, or the like. Which confession they made in the sight of all the world: and declared the same afterwardes by their factes and deedes.
                  For presently vpon Iesus death, & vpon Of the miraculous ceasinge of Oracles at Chrisis appearinge. the preaching of his name and Ghospel throughout the worlde, the Oracles which before were aboundant in euery prouince and countrie, were put to silēce. Wherof I might alleage the testimonies of verie many Gētiles them selues, as that of Iuuenal: Iuuen.

                     Dij, quibus imperium hoc steterat. &c. 
                     Lucan.
                  
                  
                     That is: the Goddes by whom this empire stood, are al departed from their temples, and haue abandoned their Altars & places of habitatiō. Strabo also hath thes expresse wordes: The Oracle of Delphos at 
                     Strab li. 9. Geograph. 169 Plutar. de defectu Oracul. 
                     this daye, is to be sene in extreme beggarie and mē
                        dicitie.
                     
And finally, Plutarche that liued within one hundreth yeares after Christ, made a special booke, to search out the causes, why the Oracles of the Goddes were ceased in his time. And after much turning & winding many waies, resolued vpon two principal pointes, as causes therof. The first, for that in his time, ther was more store of wise men then before, whos answers might stād in stead of Oracles: and the other, that peraduenture the Tvvo insufficient causes. spirits which were accustomed to yeeld Oracles, were by length of time growen olde and dead. Both which reasons in the verie common sense of al men, must needs be false; and by Plutarch him self, can not stand with probabilitie. For first; in his bookes which he wrote of the liues of auncient famous men, he confesseth, that in such kinde of wisdom, as he most esteemed, they had not their equals amōg their posteritie. Secondlie, in his treatises of Philosophie, he passeth it for a ground, that spirits, not depēding of material bodies, can not die or waxe olde: and therfore, of necessitie we must conclude, that some other cause is to be yeelded of the ceasing of thes Oracles, which can not be but the presence and commaundement of some higher power, according to the saying of S. Iohn: To this ende appeared the 
                     1. Ioh. 3. 
                     sonne of God, that he might dissolue (or ouerthrovve) the vvorkes of the deuil.
                  
                  Neither did Iesus this alone, in his owne person, but gaue also power and authoritie

to his disciples and folowers to doe the like; according to their commission in S. Matheus ghospel; Super omnia Demonia 
                     Mat. 10. 
                     & spiritus immundos &c. 
                     You shal haue authoritie, ouer al deuils and vncleane spirites. Which commission, how they afterward put in execution, the whole world yeeldeth testimonie. And for examples 
                        〈◊〉
                      onlie, I wil alleage in this place, an offer or chalēge made for proof therof, by Tertullian to the heathen magistrates and persecutcurs of his time: his wordes Tertul. in Apolog. ad gentes. are thes. Let ther be brought here in presence before your tribunal seats, some person who is certainly knowen to be possessed with a wicked spirite: and let that spirite be commaunded by a Christian, to A most cō
                           fident offer made by Tertulian. speake, and he shal as trulie confesse him self to be a deuil, as at other times to you, he wil falselie say that he is a God. Againe at the same time; let there be brought forth one of thes (your priests or Prophets) that wil seeme to be possessed by a diuine spirite; I meane of thos, that speake gasping &c. (in whom you imagine your Gods to talke,) and except that spirit also, (commaunded by vs,) doe confesse him self to be a deuil, (being indeed afraid to lye vnto a Christian:) doe you shedde the blood of the Christiās in that very place, &c. None wil lye to their owne shame, but rather for honour or aduantage: yet thos spirits wil not saye to vs, that Christ was a Magician, as you doe; nor that he was of the common condition of men. They

wil not saie, he was stolne out of his sepulcher; but they wil confesse, that he was the vertue, wisdome, and worde of God; that he is in heauen, and that he shal come againe to be our iudge &c. Neither wil thes deuils in our presence, denie them selues to be vncleane spirits, and damned for their wickednes; and that they expect his most horrible iudgment, professing also, that they doe feare Christ in God, and God in Christ; and that they are made subiect vnto his seruantes.
                  
                  Hytherto are the wordes of Tertullian, conteining (as I haue said) a most confident chalenge, and that vpō the liues and blood of al Christians, to make trial of their power in controlling thos spirites, which the Romanes and other Gentiles adored as their Godes. Which offer, seing it was made & exhibited to the persecutors them selues, then liuing in Rome; wel may we be assured, that the enemie would neuer haue omitted so notorious an aduauntage, if by former experience he had not bene persuaded, that the ioining herein would haue turned and redounded to his owne confusion.
                  And this Puissant authoritie of Iesus, The vvonderfull authoritie of Christians ouer spirits imparted to Christians, extended it self so farre forth; that not only their wordes and commandemētes, but euen their very presence did shut the mouthes, and driue into feare thes miserable spirites. So Lactantius sheweth that in his daies, among

many other exāples of this thing, a seely Lact. lib. 2. diuin. Instit. c. 16. seruing-man that was a Christiā, folowing his maister into a certaine temple of Idoles; the Godes cried out, that nothing could be weldone, as long as that Christian was in presence. The like recordeth Eusebius of Diocletian th' Emperour, who going to Apollo for an Oracle; Euse. l. 5. de prap. Euā. receyued answere, that the iust mē vvere the cause that be could saye nothing. Which iust men, Apollos priest interpreted, to be meant ironically of Christians: & therevpon, Diocletian beganne his most cruel and fearce persecution, in Eusebius daies. Sozomenus also writeth, that luliā th' Apostata endeuoring with many sacrifices Sozom. l. 3. hist. ca. 18. and coniurations, to drawe an answere from Apollo Daphnaeus, in a famous place, called daphne, in the suburbes of Antioche: vnderstood at last by the Oracle, that the bones of S. Babylas the Martyr, that laie nere to the place, were the impedimēt why that God could not speake. And therupō, Iulian presently, caused the same bodie to be remoued. And finally, here of it proceeded, that in all sacrifices, coniurations, and other mysteries of the Gentils, ther was brought in, that phrase recorded by scoffing Lucian; Exeant Christiani; let Christians depart; for that while Lucian. in Alex. they were present, nothing could be wel accomplished.
                  To conclude; the Pagane Porphyrie, that of al other, most earnestly endeuored to impugne and disgrace vs Christiās,

and to holde vp the honour of his enfeebled Porph. li. 1. cōt. Christ. apud Euse. li. 5. c. 1. de prae. Euāg. idoles; yet discoursing of the great plague that raigned most furiously in the Citie of Messina, i Cicilie wher he dwelt; yeeldeth this reason, why Aesculapius the God of Physike, (much adored in that place.) was not able to helpe them. It is no maruailes sayeth 
                           〈◊〉
                         this Citie so many yeares be vexed vvith the plague, seing that both Aesculapius 
                     A maruelous consession of Porphyrie. 
                     and al other Godes, be novv departed from it, by the comming of Christians. For since that men haue bigunne to vvorship this Iesus, vve could neuer obtaine any profite by our Godes. Thus much confessed this Patrone of paganisme, concerning the mayme that his Godes had receyued by Iesus honour. Which albeit he spake with a malitious minde, to bring Christians in hatred and persecution therby; yet is the confession notable, and confirmeth that storie which Plutarch in his forenamed booke, doth report; that in the later yeares of Tyberius A pretie storie of Plutarche. raigne, a strange voice and exceeding horrible clamour, with hideous cries, skriches, and houlinges were heard by many, in the Greciāsea, complaining that Plutar. de defectu Oracul. the great God PAN was now departed. And this Plutarch (that was a Gētile,) affirmeth to haue bene alleaged and proued, before th' Emperour Tyberius; who maruailed greatly, & could not by al his diuines and South sayers, whom he called to that consultation, gather out any reasonable meaning of this wonderful accident. But we Christians, comparing the

time wherin it happened, vnto the time of Iesus death and passion; and finding the same fully to agree: may more then probably persuade our selues, that by the death of their great God PAN (which signifieth all,) was imported the ruine and vtter ouerthrow of all the wicked spirites and Idoles vpon earth.
                  
                     AND THVS HATH the Deitie of Iesus bene declared and proued by his THE. 6. Consideration. THE punishmēt of enimies. omnipotent power in subduing infernal enimies. Now resteth it for vs to make manifest the same, by his like power and diuine iustice, shewed vpon diuers of his enimies here on earth; whos greatest punishment, albeit for the most part, he reserueth for the life to come: yet sometimes, for manifestation of his omnipotē
                     cie, (as especially it was behoueful i thos first daics of his appearāce in the world,) he chasteneth thē also euen here on earth, in the eye and sight of al men. So we read of the most in famous and miserable death of Herode the first, surnamed Ascolonita, 1. Herod Ascolonita. who after his persecution of Christ in his infancie, and the slaughter of the infantes in Bethleem for his sake; was wearied out by a lothsome life, in feare and horrour Ioseph. l. 17 antiq. c. 10. & lib. 1. de bel. Iudai. ca. 21. of his owne wife and children; whom after he had most cruelly murdered; was enforced also by desperation, thorough his inspeakable vexations, grieues, and torments, to offer his owne hand to his owne destructiō, if he had not bene staied by friends that stood about.
                  
                     
After him, Archelaus his eldest sonne, that was a terrour to Iesus at his returne 2. Archilam. from Egipt, fel also by Gods Iustice, into maruailous calamities. For first, being left as king by his father; Augustus Ioseph. l. 17 antiq. c. 15. l. 2. de bel. Iuda. c. 6. would not allow or ratefie that successiō; but of a king, made him a Tetrarch, assigning to him onlie the fourth part of that dominion, which his father had before. And then againe, after nine yeares space, tooke that away in like maner, with the greatest dishonour he could deuise, seazing vpon al his treasure and riches by way of confiscation, and condemning his person to perpetual banishment, wherin he died most miserablie, in Vienna in France.
                  Not long after this, the second sonne 3. Herod Antipas. of Herode the first, named Herode Antipas, Tetrarch of Galiley, who put S. Ihon Baptist to death, and scorned Iesus before his passion, (wherat both him self and Ioseph. l. 18 antiq. c. 9. l. 2. de bel. c. 8 Herodias his concubine were present;) was deposed also by Caius th' Emperour (being accused by Agrippa, his nearest kinseman,) and most contumeliously sent in exile; first, to Lions in France, and after that, to the most desert and inhabitable places of Spaine, wher he with Herodias wandered vp and doune, in extreme calamitie, so long as they liued; and finally ended their daies, abandonned of al men. In which miserie also it is recorded, that the Niceph. l. 1. cap. 20. daunsing daughter of Herodias, who had in her Iolitie demaunded Iohn Baptists

Head, being on a certaine time enforced 4. Herodias daughter. to passe ouer a frosen riuer, the yse brake, and she in her fall, had her head cut of by the same yse, without hurting the rest of her body, to the great admiration of al the lookers on.
                  The like euent had an other of Herode 5 Herode Agrippa. familie, named Herod Agrippa, th' acculer of the fornamed Herod the Tetrarch; who in his great glorie and triumphe, hauing yut to death S. Iames the brother of S. Ihon Euangelist, and imprisoned S. Peter: was soone after in a publique assemblie of Princes and Nobles, at Caesarea; striken from heauen, with a most horrible disease, wherby his bodie putrified, Act. 12. Ioseph. 1. 19. antiq. c. 7. and was eaten with vermine, as both S. Luke reporteth, and Iosephus confirmeth. And the same Iosephus, with no small Lib. 18. c. 7. maruaile in hym self, declareth; that at the verie time when he wrote his storie, (which was aboute 70 yeares after the death of Herod the first:) the whole progenie and ofspring, kinred, and familie of the said Herod, (which he sayeth was exceeding great, by reason he had niene The stocke of Herode soone extinguished. wiues together, with many children, brothers, sisters, nephews, and kinsefolke,) were all extinguished in most miserable sorte, and gaue a testimonie (saith Iosephus) to the world, of the most vaine confidence, that men doe put in humane felicitie. The punishmēt of Romanes.
                  
                  And as thes punishements lighted openlie, vpon Iesus professed enimies in

Iurie: So escaped not also the Romans their chastissement; I meane such, as especiallie had their handes in persecution of hym, or of his followers after hym. For 5. Pilate. first, of Pontius Pilate, that gaue sentence of death against hym, we reade, that after great disgrace receyued in Iurie; he was 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . lib. 7. hist. Euseb l. 2. c. 7. hist. sent home into Italie, and ther by manifold disfauours shewed vnto him by the Emperour his maister, sel into such desperation, as he slewe him self with his owne handes. And secondlie, of the very Emperours them selues, who liued from Tyberius (vnder whom Iesus suffred,) vnto Constātine the great, vnder whom Christian religion tooke dominion ouer the world, (which contained the space of three hūdreth yeares;) very few or none, escaped the manifest scourges of Gods dreadful iustice, shewed vpon them at the knitting vp of their daies. For examples Tertul. in Apolog. sake; Tyberius, that permitted Christians to liue freely, and made a lawe against their molestation, as before hath bene shewed, died peaceably in his bedde. But 6. Calligula. Caligula that folowed him, for his contempt shewed against al diuine power, in making him self a God; was soone after murdered by the cōspiracie of his dearest friendes. Nero also, who first of al other 7. Nero. beganne persecution against the Christians; within fewe monethes after he had put S. Peter and S. Paul to death in Rome, (hauing murdered in like manner his owne mother, brother, wife, & maister;)

was vpon the sudaine, from his glorious estate and maiestie, throwen doune into such horrible distresse and confusion, in the sight of al men; as being condemned by the Senate, to haue his heade thrust into a pillorie, and ther most ignominiously to be whipped to death: was cōstrained, for auoiding th' execution of that terrible sentence, to massacre him self with his owne handes, by the assistance of such as were dearest vnto him.
                  The like might be shewed in the tragical 8. Manie Emperous that died miserablic. endes of Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Domitian, Commodus, Pertinax, Iulian, Macrinus, Antoninus, Alexander, Maximinus, Gordianus, Aurelianus, Decius, Gallus, Volutianus, Aemilianus, Valerianus, Galienus, Caius, Carinus, Maximianus, Maxentius, Licinius, and others, whos miserable deathes, a noble man & Councellour wel neare a thousand yeares past, Euagrius Scolast. l. 3. hist. ca. 41. did gather against Zosimus a heathen writer, to shew therby the pouerful hand of Iesus vpon his enemies; adding further more, that since the time of Constantine, whiles Emperours haue bene Christians, few or no such examples can be shewed, except it be vpon Iulian th' Apostata, Valens the Arrian heretique, or some other of like detestable and notorious wickednes. And thus much of particuler men chastised by Iesus.
                  But if we desire to haue a full example 9. The chastisment of Hierusalem and of the Iuishe people. of his iustice, vpon a whole Nation together: let vs consider what befell Hierusalem

and the people of Iurie, for their barbarous crueltie practised vpon him, in his death and Passion. And trulie, if we beleeue Iosephus and Philo the Iuishe historiographers, (who liued either with Christ or immediatelie after him;) It can hardlie be expressed by the tongue or penne of mā, what insufterable calamities and miseries, were inflicted to that people (presentelie vpon th' Ascension of Iesus,) by Pilat their gouernour, vnder Tyberius th' Emperour; and then againe by Petronius, vnder Caligula; and after that, by Cumanus, vnder Claudius; and lastlie, by Festus & Albinus, vnder Nero. Through Ioseph. lib. 19. antiq. li. 2. & 3. de bel. Iudai. Philo in Flacco & l. 2. de leg. Cornel. Tac. lib. 12. whos cruelties that nation was enforced finallie to rebell and take armes against the Roman Empire, which was the cause of their vtter ruine and extirpation by Titus and Vespasian. At what time, besides the ouerthrowe of their Citie, burnīg of their Temple, and other infinite distresses, which Iosephꝰ an eye-witnes protesteth, that no speech or discourse humane can declare: the same authour recordeth eleuē hundreth thousand persons to haue bene slaine, and foure skore and seuentiene thousand takē aliue, who were either put to death afterward ī publique triumphes, or solde openly for bondslaues into all partes of the world.
                  And in this vniuersal calamitie of the Iuishe Nation, being the most notorious and grieuous that euer happened to Nation or people, before or after them, (for

Yea, further it is obserued & noted, that as they apprehended Iesus, & made th' ētrāce to his passiō vpō the mount Oliuet: sp Titus (as Iosephus writeth,) vpon Ioseph. li. 5. de bel. c. 8. the same mounte planted his first siege for their final destruction. And as they ledde Iesus from Caiphas to Pilate, afflicting him in their presence: so now were themselues ledde vp and doune, from Iohn to Simon, (two tyrantes that had vsurped Cap. 27. dominion within the Citie,) and were scourged and tormented before their tribunal seates. Againe, as they had caused Iesus to be scoffed, beaten, and vilanously entreated by the souldiours, in Pilates Palace: so were now their owne prīcipal rulers & noble mē, (as Ioseph' noteth,) most scornesully abused, beaten, and crucisied by the same souldiours. Which later point of crucising, or villanous putting to death vpō the Crosse, was begunne to be practised by the Romans, vpon the Iuishe Gentrie, immediatelie after Christes death and not before. And now at this tyme of

the warre, Iosephus affirmeth, that ī some one daie, 500 of his nation were taken & put to this opprobrious kinde of punishement; in so much, that for the greate multitude (saith he,) Nec locus suff

                      that is; nether the place was sufficient to containe so many Crosses, as the Romans sett vp; nor the Crosses sufficient to sustaine so many bodies, as they murdered by that torment.
                  
                  This dreadful and vnspeakeable miserie, fell vpō the Iewes, about fortie yeares after Iesus Ascention, when they had A marueilous prouidēce of God for deliuering the Christians that vvere in Ierusalē at the tyme of the destruction. shewed them selues most obstinate and obdurate against his doctrine, deliuered vnto them, not only by him self, but also by his Disciples; of which disciples they had slaine now S. Stephen and S. Iames, and had driuen into banishment, both S. Peter and S. Paul, and other that had preached vnto them. To which later two Apostles, (I meane S. Peter & S. Paul,) our Sauiour Iesus appeared a litle before their martirdomes in Rome, (as Lactātius writeth,) and shewed, that within three or foure yeares after their deathes, he was to take reuenge vpon their Nation, by the vtter destruction of Ierusalem, and of that generation. Which secrete aduise, the said Lactantius affirmeth, that Peter and Lib. 4. diuin. Inst. ca. 21. Euseb. li. 3. hist. cap. 5. Niceph. c. 3. Paul reueyled to other Christians in Iurie; wherby it came to passe, (as Eusebius also and other authours doe mention,) that al the Christians liuing in Ierusalem, departed thence, not long before the

siege begāne, to a certaine towne named Pella, beyond Iordan, which was assigned vnto them for that purpose, by Iesus himself, for that it being in the dominion of Agrippa, (who stoode with the Romans,) it remained in peace and safetie, while al Iurie besides was brought to desolation.
                  This then was the prouidence of God for the punishment of the Iewes at that time. And euer after, their estate declined The Iuishe miseries after the destruction of Hierusalem. from worse to worse; and their miseries daily multiplied throughout the world. Wherof he that wil see a ver lamentable narration; let him read but the last booke only of Iosephus historie de Bello Judaico, wherin is reported besides other thinges, that after the warre was ended, and al publique slaughter ceased: Titus sent sixtiē thousand Iewes, as a present to his father to Rome, ther to be putt to death in diuers and sundrie maners. Others he applied to be Spectacles for pastyme to the Romans that were present with him; wherof Iosephus saieth, that he sawe with his Ioseph. li. 7. de bel. c. 20 & 21. owne eyes, two thousand & fiue hundreth murdered and consumed in one day, by fight and combat among them selues, and with wilde beastes at the Emperours appointement. Others were assigned in Antioche and other great Cities, to serue for faggots in their famous bonefires at times of triumphe. Others were solde to be bondslaues: others cōdemned to digge & shew stones for euer. And this was the

ende of that warre and desolation.
                  After this againe vnder Traiane th' Emperour, ther were so infinite a number of The final desolatiō of the Iuishe Nation. Iewes slaine and made awaye by Marcus Turbo in Africa, and Lucius Quintus in the East: as al histories agree, that it is impossible to expresse the multitude. But yet more wonderful is it, which the same historians doe reporte; that in the 18. yeare of Adrian th' Emperour, one Iullus Seuerus being sent to extinguishe all the remnant of the Iuishe generation: destroied Oros. lib. 7. cap. 13. Ariston pel laeus in hist. Euseb. lib. 4. cap. 8. Niccph. lib. 3. c. 24. in smal time 980 Townes and villages within that countrie, and slewe fiue hundreth and fowre skore thousand of that bloode and nation in one daye: at which tyme also he beate downe the Citie of Hierusalem in such sorte; as he lest not one stone standing vpon an other of their aunciēt buildinges; but caused some parte therof to be reedefied againe, and inhabited by only Gentiles. He chāged the name of the Citie, and called it Th' Emperours name, vvas Aclius Adrianus. AFLIA, after th' Emperours name. He droue al the progeny and ofspring of the Iewes furth of all thos countries, with a perpetual lawe confirmed by the Emperour, that they should neuer returne; no, nor so much as looke backe from any highe or eminent place, to that countrie againe. And this was done to that Iuishe Natiō by the Roman Emperours, for accomplishing that demaund, which their prīcipal elders had made not longe before to Pilate the Romau Magistrate, concerning Iesus most

iniurious death, cryinge out with one cō
                     sent and voice; to wit: Let his blood be vpon vs, and vpon our posteritie.

                     AND HEERIN ALSO, (I meane in the most wonderful & notorious chastisment, THE. 7. Consideration. THE fulfilling of Iesus propheties. or rather reprobation of this Iuishe people, which of all the world was Gods peculier before,) is sett out vnto vs, as it were in a glasse, the seuenth and last pointe, which we mentioned in the beginning of this section: to witt, the fulfilling of such speeches & propheties, as Iesus vttered when he was vpon earth: as namely at one time, after a long and vehement commination, made to the Scribes, Pharisees, and principal men of that Nation, (in which he repeateth eight seueral times the dreadful threat woe:) he concludeth finally, that al the iust blood, iniuriouslie shedde, from the first Martyr Abel, should be reuenged verie shortelie Mat. 23. vpon that generation. And in the same place, he menaceth the populous Citie of Ierusalē, that itshould be made desert. And in an other place, he assureth thē, that one Luc. 21. stone should not be left standing therof vpon an other. And yet futther he pronounced vpon the same Citie, thes words. The daies shal come vpon thee, and thy enemies shal enuiron thee vvith a vval, and shall besiege 
                     Luc. 19. 
                     thee; they shall straiten the on euery side, and shal beate the to the grounde, and thy children in thee, 
                     Iesus speeches of Ierusalem. And yet more particulerly, he foretelleth the verie signes, wherby his disciples should perceyue when the time in deed

was come; vsing this speeche vnto them. VVhen you shal see Ierusalem besieged vvith an 
                     Luc. 21.

Great distresse shal fal vpon this earth, and vengeance vpon this people. They shalbe slaine by dint of the svvord, and shal be led as slaues into al countries. And Jerusalem shalbe trodden vnder seete by the Gentiles, vntil the times of Nations be accomplished.
                  
                  This foretold Iesus of the miserie that was to fal vpon Ierusalem, and vpon that The circū

And yet how certaine and assured foreknowlege, (and as it were most sensible forefeeling) Iesus had of thes miseries, he declared, not only by thes expresse words Luc. 19. and by their euēt: but also by thos pittiful teares he shed vpon sight and consideration of Hierusalem, and by the lamentable speeche he vsed to the women of that Citie, who wept for him at his Passion, persuading them, to weepe rather for thē selues and for their children, (in respect Luc. 23. of the miseries to followe,) then for him.
                  Which wordes and predictions of Iesus, together with sundrie other his speeches,

fore shewing so particularlie the imminent calamities of that Nation, (and that, as I haue said, at such time, when in humane discourse ther could be no probabilitie therof;) when a certaine heathen Chronicler and Mathematique, named Phleg. Thralli. lib. annal. Phlegon, about an hundreth yeares after Christs departure, had diligently considered, hauing sene the same also in his dayes most exactelie fulfilled, (for he was seruant to Adrianus th' Emperour, by whos commandement, as hath bene said before, the final subuersion of the Iuishe The testimonie of a beathē, for the fulfilling of Christs propheties. nation was brought to passe:) this Phlegō (I say) though a Pagan, yet vpon consideration of thes euentes, and others that he saw, (as th' extreme persecution of Christians fortold by Christ and the like:) he pronounced, that neuer any man foretold things so certainlie to come, or that so preciselie were accomplished, as were the predictions and propheties of Iesus. And this testimonie of Phlegon, was alleaged and vrged for Christians, again't Orig. lib. 2. cūt. Celsum sub initiū. one Celsus a heathen Philosopher and Epicure, by the famous learned Origen, euen the very next age after it was writtē by th' authour; so that of the truth of this allegation, ther can be no doubt or question at all.
                  And now albeit thes predictions and Other propheties of Iesus fulfilled to his Disciples. propheties, concerning the punishment and reprobation of the Iewes, fulfilled so euidently in the sight of al the world, might be a sufficient demonstration, of Iesus

for knowlege in affaires to come: yet are ther many other thinges besides foreshewed by him, which fel out as exactly, as did thes; notwithstanding that by no learning, mathematical reason, or humane cōiecture, they were or might be forsene. As for example; the foretelling of his owne death; the maner, time, and place therof: as also the person that should betraie him, together with his irrepentantende. The flight, feare, and scandal of his disciples, albeit they had promissed & protested the contrarie. The three seueral denials of Peter. The particuler time of his owne resurrection, and Ascension. The sending of the Holy-Ghost; and many other the like predictions, propheties, & promisses, which to his Apostles, Disciples, and folowers, that heard them vttered, and left them written before they fel out, and saw them afterwarde accomplished; and who by the falsehood therof should haue receyued greatest dōmage of all other mē, if they had not bene true: to thes men (I saie) they were most euident proofes of Iesus diuine prescience in matters that should ensue.
                  But yet for that an Infidell, (with whom onlie I suppose my self to deale in this place,) may in thes and the like thinges, find perhapes some matter of cauillation; and saie, that thes propheties of Iesus were recorded by our Euangelistes, Propheties fulfilled in the sight of Gentiles. after the particularities therin prophetied were effectuated, and not before; and

consequentlie, that they might be forged: I wil alleage certaine other euentes, both foretolde and registred, before they came to passe; and diuulged by publique writinges in the face of al the worlde, when ther was smal semblance that euer the same should take effect. Such were the particuler  foretelling of the kinde & maner of S. Peters death, whiles yet he liued: The peculier and differēt maner of S. Iohn  th' Euāgelists ending, from the rest of the Apostles: The prerogatiue giuen to Peter  aboue the rest, that his Faith and Chaire should neuer faile, (which we see miraculouslie verefied euen vntil this day; the successions of all other Apostles hauing failed and his not. The forshewing & describinge to his disciples, the most extreme  and cruel persecutions, that should insue vnto Christians for his sake, (a thing at that time not probable in reason, for that the Romanes permitted the exercise of al kindes of religions:) And that notwithstanding  in all thes pressures and intollerable afflictie is, his faithfull followers should not shrincke, but holde out, and daily encrease in zeale, fortitude, and number; and finallie, should atchiue the victorie and conquest of al the world: a thīg much more vnlikly, at that daye, & so farre passing al humane probabilitie; as no capacitie, reason, or cōcept of man, might reach or attaine the foresight therof.
                  And with this wil we cōclude our third and last part of the general diuision set

doune in the beginning, concerning the groundes and proofes of Christian religion.
               
               
                  The Conclusion. Sect. 4.
                  
                  BY AL that hytherto hath bene saide, The summe of the sormer three Sections. we haue declared and made manifest vnto the, (gentle reader,) three thinges of great importance. First, that from the beginning and creation of the worlde,  ther hath bene promised in all times and ages, a Messias or Saueour of mankinde, in whom and by whom, al Nations should be blessed; as also, that the particuler time, maner, and circumstance of his cōming; together with the qualitie of his person, purpose, doctrine, life, death, resurrection, and Ascension, were in like maner by the prophets of God, most euidently forshewed. Secōdly; that the very  same particulers and special points, that were dessigned and set doune by the said Prophets, were also fulfilled most exactly with their circumstances, in the person and actions of Iesus our Saueour. Thirdly, that besides the accomplishment  of all the for said propheties; there were giuen by Iesus, many signes, manifestatiōs, and most infallible arguments of his Deitie and omnipotēt puissance, after his Ascention or departure from al humane and corporal conuersation in this world. By al which waies, meanes, arguments, and

proofes; & by ten thousand more, which to the tongue or penne of man are inexplicable, the Christian minde remaineth setled, and most firmely grounded in the vndoubted belief of his religion; hauing besides al other thinges, euidēces, certainties, and internal comfortes and assurances, which are infinite: thes eight demonstratiue Eight reasons. reasons and persuasions which ensue, for his more ample and aboundant satisfaction therin.
                  First; that it was impossible that so many 1. The propheties. thinges, should be foretold so precisely, with so many particularities, in so many ages, by so different persons al of sanctitie, with so great concorde, consent, and vnitie, and that so long before hand, but by the spirite of God alone, that only hath foreknowlege of future euents. Secondly; 2. The fulfillinge. that it could not possibly be, that so many thinges, so difficult and strange, with al their particularities and circumstances, should be so exactly and preciselie fulfilled, but in him alone of whom they were truly meant. Thirdly; that it can no waies be imagined, that God would euer 3. Gods assistance. haue concurred with Iesus doinges, or assisted hym, aboue all course of nature, with so aboundant miracles, as the Gentiles doe confesse that he wrought, yf he had bene a Seducer, or taken vpon hym to set foorth a false doctrine. Fourthly; if Iesus 4. Iesus doctrine. had intended to deceaue and seduce the world; he would neuer haue proposed a doctrine so difficult and repugnant

to al sensualitie; but rather would haue taught things pleasant and grateful to mans voluptuous delight, as Mahomet did after him. Nether could the nature of mā, haue euer so affectuously embrased such austeritie, without the assistance of some diuine and supernatural power. Fistly; 5. Iesus maner of teachinge. for that Iesus being poorely borne and vnlettred, as by his aduersaries confessiō doth appeare, and that in such an age and tyme, when all worldly learning was in most florishing estate: he could neuer possibly but by diuine power, haue attained to such most exquisite knowlege in all kinde of learning, as to be able to decide all the doubtes and controuersies of Philosophers before him, as he did; laving doune more plainly, distinctly, & perspicuously, the pithe of all humane and diuine learning, within the compasse of three yeares teaching, (and that to auditours of so great simplicitie;) then did al the Sages of the world, vntil that 
                        〈◊〉
                     , in so much that euen then, the most vnlearned Christian of that time, could say more in certaintie of truth, concerning the knowledge of God, the Creation of the world, th' ende of man, the reward of vertue, the punishment of vice, th' immortalitie and rest of our soule after this life, and in other such highe poinctes and mysteries of true philosophie: then could the most famous and learned of al the Gentiles, that had for so many ages before, beaten their braines in contention about the

same.
                  Sixtlie, if Iesus had not meant plainly 6. Iesus life and maner of proceedinge. and sincerely in al his doinges, according as he professed; he would neuer haue takē so seuere a course of life to himself, neither would he haue refused al temporal dignities and aduancemēts as he did; he would neuer haue chosen to die so opprobriously in the sight of al men, nor made election of Apostles and Disciples so poore and contemptible in the world; nor if he had; would euer worldly men haue folowed him in so great multitudes, with so great seruour, zeale, constancy, and perseuerāce vnto death Seuenthly, we see that the first 7. The beginners & first publishers of Christian religion. beginners and founders of Christian religion left by Iesus, were a multitude of simple and vnskilful persons, vnapt to deceyue or deuise any thing of them selues. They beganne against al probabilitie of mans reason: they went forward against the streame and strength of al the world: they continued and encreased aboue humane possibilitie: they perseuered in tormētes and afflictions insufferable: they wrought miracles aboue the reache and compasse of mans habilitie: they ouerthrew Idolatrie, that then possessed the world, and confounded al powers infernal, by the only name and vertue of their maister. They saw the propheties of Iesus fulfilled, and al his diuine speeches and predictions come to passe. They sawe the punishmēt of their enimies and chief imnugners to fal vpon them, in their dayes.

They sawe euery daie whole Prouinces, Countries, and kingdomes conuerted to their faith. And finally, the whole Romane Empire and world besides, to subiect it self to the lawe, obediēce, and Ghospel of their maister.
                  Lastly; among all other reasons and argumentes, this may be one most manifest 8. The present state of Ievves. vnto vs; that wheras by many testimonies and expresse propheties of the olde Testament it is affirmed, that the people of Israel should abandone, persecute, and put to death the true Messias at his comming, as before hath bene shewed; and for that facte, should it self be abandoned of God, and brought to ruine and dispersion ouer al the world; (wherin according to the wordes of Osee; they shal sitt for a long time, 
                     Osee 3. 
                     vvithout king, vvithout prince, vvithout sacrifice, vvithout Altar, vvithout Ephode, or images; and after this againe shal returne and seeke their God, in the last daies:) we see in this age the verie same particularities fulfilled in that Nation, and so to haue continued now for thes fiftiene hundreth yeares: that is; we see the Iuishe people abandoned and afflicted aboue al Nations of the world; dispersed in seruilitie throughout al corners of other Nations; without dignitie or reputation; without king, prince, or common wealth, of them selues; prohibited by al Princes, both Christian & other, to make their sacrifices, wher they inhabite; depriued of al meanes to attaine to knowledge in good literature, wherby

daily they fal into more grosse ignorance and absurdities against common reason, in their later doctrine; then did the most barbarous infidels that euer were; hauing lost al sense and feeling in spiritual affaires; al knowledge and vnderstāding in celestial thinges for the life to come; hauing among them no Prophet; no graue teacher; no man directed by Gods holy spirite: and finally; as men forlorne and filled with al kinde of miserie, doe both by their inward and external calamities, preach, denounce, & testifie to the world, that Iesus whom they Crucified, was the only true Messias and Saucour of mankinde, and that his blood, (as they required,) lieth heauilie vpon their generatiō for euer.
                  Wherfore to conclude this whole The cōclusion of the Chapter vvith an admonishement. discourse and treatise of the proofes and euidences of our Christian religion; seing that by so manifolde and inuincible demōstratiōs, it hath bene declared & laied before our eyes, that Iesus is the only true Saucour and redeemer of the world, and consequently, that his seruice and religion is the only waye and meane to please almightie God, and to attaine euerlasting happines; ther remaineth now to consider, that the same Iesus, which by so many Prophets was promised to be a Saucour; was also foretolde by the self same Prophetes, that he should be a Iudge and Iesus shal be also a Iudge. examiner of al our actions. Which later point, no one Prophet that hath forshewed

his cōming, hath omitted seriously to inculcate vnto vs. No, not the Sibyls them selues, who in euery place where they describe the most gracious cōming of the Virgins sonne, doe also annexe therunto his dreadful appearance at the day of iudgmēt; especially in thos famous Acrosticke verses, wherof there hath Apud Euse. lib. 4 in vit. Const. in si. bene so much mention before; the whole discours vpon the words, Iesus, Christ, the sonne of God, Saucour, and Crosse, containeth nothing els, but a large and ample description of his most terrible cōming infire and flame, and conflagration of the world at that dreadful daie, to take accompt of all mēs wordes, actions, and cogitations.
                  To which description of thes Pagane Prophetes, is consonāt the whole tenour 1. Reg. 2. Psal. 95. Esa. 2. 13. 26. 27. 30 Iere. 30. Dan. 7. Sopho. 1. Malac. 4.

Thess. 4. 5. and cōtext of the olde Bible, foreshewing euery where, the dreadful Maiestie, terrour, and seueritie of the Messias at that day. The new Testament also, which tendeth wholy to comfort and solace mankinde, and hath the name of Euangile, in respect of the ioyful newes which it brought to the world; omitteth not to put vs continually in minde of this point. And to that ende, both Iesus him self, amiddest al his sweet and comfortable speeches with his Disciples, did admonishe them often of this last daie; and his Apostles, Euangelistes, & Disciples after him, repeated, iterated, and vrged this important consideration, in al their wordes

                     2. Thess. 1 1. Tit. 2. 2. Pet. 3. Heb. 9. Iud. 14. Apoc. 1. and writinges.
                  Wherfore as by the name and cogitation of a Saueour, we are greatly stirred vp to ioye, alacritie, confidence, and consolation: so by this admonishment of Gods Saints, and of Iesus himself, that he is to be our Iudge, and seuere examiner of al the minutes and moments of our life: we are to conceyue iust feare and dread of this his second comming. And as by the whole former treatise we haue bene An illatiō vpon the premisses vvith an exhortatiō. instructed, that the only waie to saluatiō is by the profession of Iesus religion: so by this accompt that shalbe demanded at our handes at the last daie, by the Authour and first institutour of this religion, we are taught, that onles we be true Christiās indeed, and doe performe such duties as this law and religion prescribeth vnto vs; so farre of shal we be from receyuing any benefite by the name; as our iudgment shal be the more grieuous, and our final calamitie more intollerable. For which cause, I would in sincere charitie, exhorte euery man, that by the former discourse hath receyued any light, and is confirmed in his iudgment concerning the truth of Christian religion; to employ his whole endeuours for the attainemēt of the fruite and benefite therof: which is, by being a true and real Christian: for that Christ him self foresignified, that many should take the name without commoditie of their profession. And to the ende ech man may the better knowe or coniecture of

him self, whether he be in the right way or no, and whether he perfourme in deede the dutie required of a true Christian: I haue thought conuenient, to adioyne this chapter next following of that matter, and therin to declare the particuler pointes belonging to that profession. Which being knowen, it shall be easie for euerie one that is not ouer partial, or wilfullie bent to deceaue hym self, to discerne of his owne estate, and of the course and waye that he holdeth. Which is a highe pointe of wisdome for all men to doe while they haue tyme; least at the later daye, we hauing passed ouer our liues in the bare name onlie of Christianitie, without the substance: doe finde our selues in the number of thos most vnfortunate people, who shall crye Lord, Lord, and receaue no comfort by that confession.
               
            
            
               
               HOW A MAN MAY IVDGE OR DISCERNE OF HIM SELF, VVHETHER HE BE a true Christian or not. VVith a declaration of the tvvo partes belonging to that profession; vvhiche are, beleefe and lyse. CHAPT. V.

                  mendations, and proprieties therof; the next point is, to shew the meanes and way wherby to attaine the same: so much more, in this diuine & heauenly doctrine of Christian religion (which concerneth our soule and euerlasting saluation;) for that we haue shewed before, not only the most vndoubted truth wherupon it standeth, but also that the knowledge therof

is so absolutelie necessary, as there is no other name or profession vnder heauen, wherby mankinde can be saued, but only Act. 4. this of Iesus: it foloweth by order of good consequence, that we should treate Th' effect of this chapter. in this place, how a man may attaine the fruite of this doctrine: that is to saye; how he may come to be a good Christian; or if alredy he professe that name; how he may examine or make trial of him self, whether he be so in deed or not. Which examination (to speake in briefe,) consisteth wholie in consideration of thes two Tvvo pointes.
                   pointes. First; whether he beleeue vnfainedly the total summe of documēts & mysteries,  left by Iesus & his disciples in the Catholique Church; and secondlie, whether  he performe in sinceritie the rules and preceptes of life, prescribed vnto Christians for direction of their actions. So that on thes two points we are to bestowe our whole speeche in this chapter.
               
                  AND FOR THE FIRST, how to THE. 1. parte, cō
                     cerning beleefe. examine the truth of our beleefe; it would be ouer tedious to lay doune euery particuler waie, that might be assigned for discussion therof: for that it would bring in the contention of al times, aswel auncient as present, about cōtrouersies in Christian faith, which hath bene impugned from age to age, by the seditious instruments of Christs infernal enemie. And therfore, as well in respecte of the lēgth, (wherof this place is not capable,) as also for that of purpose I doe auoide al

dealing with matters of controuersie, within the cōpasse of this worke: I meane only at this time, for the comfort of such as are alredy in the right waie, and for some light to others, who perhaps of simplicitie may walke awrie; to let doune with as great breuitie as possibly may be, some few general notes or obseruations, for their better helpe in this behalfe.
               In which great affaire of our faith and beleefe, (wherin consisteth as well the ground and foundatiō of our eternal welfare, as also the fruite & entire vtilitie of Christs comming into this world;) it is to be considered, that God could not of his infinite wisdome, (forseeing al thigs, and times to come;) nor euer would of his vnspeakable goodnes, (desiring our The matters of faith and beleefe easie amōg Christians. saluatiō as he doth;) leaue vs in this life, without most sure, certaine, and cleare euidencie in this matter: and consequētly, we must imagine, that all our errours cō
                  mitted herein (I meane in matters of faith and beleefe among Christians) doe proceede rather of finne, negligence, wilfulnes, or inconsideration in our selues; then either of difficultie or doubtfulnes in the meanes left vnto vs for discerning the same, or of the want of Gods holie assistance to that effect, if we would with humilitie accept therof.
               This Esay made plaine, when he prophetied of this perspicuitie; that is, of this most excellent priuilege in Christian religion, so many hundred yeares before

Christ was borne. For after that in diuers chapters he had declared the glorious cō
                  ming of Christ in signes and miracles, as also the multitude of Gētiles that should imbrace his doctrine, together with the ioye and exultation of their cōuersion: he forsheweth presentlie the wōderful prouidence of God also, in prouidinge for Christians so manifest a waye of directiō for their faith and religion; as the most simple and vnlearned man in the world, should not be able (but of wilfulnes) to goe astraye therin. His wordes are thes, directed to the Gentiles. Take comfort and 
                  Esay. 35. 
                  feare not: beholde your God shall come and saue you. Then shall the eyes of the blinde be opened, and the eares of the deafe shalbe restored &c. And there shalbe a path & vvaye; and it shalbe called 
                  The direct holie vvay of the Catholique Church. THE HOLIE WAYE: & it shalbe vnto you so direct a vvay, as fooles shall not be able to erre therin. By which wordes we see, that among other rare benefites that Christes people were to receaue by his comminge; this should be one, and not the least; that after his holie doctrine once published and receyued, it should not be easie for the weakest in capacitie or learning that might be, (whom Esay here noteth by the name of fooles,) to runne awrie in matters of their beliefe; so plaine, cleare, & euidēt, should the waye for trial therof be made.
               Here hence it is, that S. Paul pronounceth so peremptorilie of a contētious and heretical man, that he is damned by the testimenie 
                  Tit. 
                        〈◊〉
                     .
                  
                  of his ovvne iudgement or conscience; for that he hath abandoned this common, direct, and publique waye, which all men might see, and hath deuised particuler pathes and turninges to hymself. See S. August. tract. 1. in epist. Iohan. & li. de vn. Eccl. cont. Petilian. ca. 14. Herehēce it is, that th' auncient fathers of Christe primatiue Church, disputinge against the same kynde of people; defended alwayes that their errour was of malice and wilful blindnes, and not of ignorance; applyinge thos wordes of prophetie vnto thē, they that savve me, rannc out from me. That is, saith S. Augustine,  they which sawe and Psal. 30. beheld the Catholique Church of Christ, Concion. 2. in Psal. 30. (which is the plaine waye denoted byEsay, and the most eminēt mountaine described by Daniel; as also by Esay hymself in an other place, & expounded by Christ Dan. 2. Esa. 2. Math. 5. in S. Mathewes Ghospel:) this Churche (saith he) wicked heretiques beholding, (for that no mā can auoide the sight therof, but he that most obstinatelie will shut his eyes;) yet for hatred and malice, doe they runne out of the same, and doe raise vp heresies and schismes against th' vnitie therof.
               
               Thus much saith this holie doctour: by whose discourse we maye perceyue, that the plaine and direct waye mentioned by Esay, wherin no simple or ignorant man can erre, is the general bodie of Christes visible Church vpon earth, planted by his Apostles throughout al countries & Nations, and cōtinuinge by succession, vnto the worldes ende. In which Church, whosoeuer

remaineth, & beleeueth al thinges that are taught therin; cā not possiblie fall The vvay of auoiding errour in beliefe. into errour of faith. For that this church or vniuersal bodie, is guided by Christes spirit, who is the heade therof, and so no waies subiect or withi cōpasse of errour. For which cause, S. Paul nameth it, the pillar and sirmament of truth. And the same 1. Tim. 3. Church, is so manifest and euident, (and shalbe so to the worldes ende, as the same Aug. tract. in epist. Iohā. Chri, hom. 4. de verb. Isai. vidi Dn̄m. learned Doctour, and other his equals doe proue:) that it is more easie to fynde it out; then it is to see the Sunne or Moone, when it shy neth brightest, or to beholde the greatest hill or mountaine in the world. For as S. Augustines wordes are, albeit particuler hilles in one countrie, may be vnknowen in an other; as Olympus in Greece, may be vnknowen in Affrica, and the mountaine Giddaba of Affrike, may be vnknowen in Greece: yet (saith this holie father) a mountaine that passeth throughout all Countries and filleth vp the whole world (as Daniel prophetied Dan. 2. Christes Church should doe;) can not be but apparent to the sight of al men, and consequentlie must needes be knowē of al men, but onlie of such, as wilfullie doe shut their eyes from sight therof.
               
               For declaration of which reason, argument, and discourse of Holy-Fathers, A declaration of the fathers argument. Mat. 5. 18 20. (being also the discourse of Christ hym self in the Ghospel, when he remitteth mē to the visible Church, that is placed on an hill;) it is to be noted, that in the time frō
                  
Christes ascension, vntil the 14. yeare of Neroes raigne, who first of the Romane Emperours, beganne open persecution against the proceedinges of Christians, & put to death S. Peter and S. Paul: In this time (I saie) of tolleration vnder the Romane Empire, (which cōtained the space of 37. yeares;) Christes Apostles and Disciples had preached and planted one vniforme Ghospell thoroughout all the worlde, as both by their actes and gestes recorded, as also by the peculier testimonie of S. Paul to the Romanes may appeare. Rom. 1. Which thing being done most miraculoussie, by the power and vertue of their Maister; and Bishops, pastours, and other gouernours, being ordained in euery Church and countrie, for guiding and directing the same by them selues & their successours to the worlds end: this (I say) being once brought to passe; and the litle stone that was cut out of a hill without handes, being now made a huge mountaine that had spreed it self ouer the whole face of the earth, according to Daniels prophetie: thē thos holy and sage Dan. 2. Apostles for preuenting of al new doctrines and false errours that might afterwardes arise, (as by reuelation from Iesus, they vnderstood there should doe many:) most earnestly exhorted, and with al possible vehemēcie called vpon the people, 1. Cor. 16. Galat. 5. 2. Thess. 2. to stand fast in the documents and traditions then receaued; to holde firmly the faith and doctrine already deliuered, as a

                  Depositum and treasure committed to be safely kept vntil the last daie. And aboue 1. Tim. 6. 20. 2. Tim. 1. Mat. 7. Rom. 16. 2. Tim. 2. 3. Tit. 3. 2. Thess. 3 2. Ioa. 7. Apoc. 2. all other thinges, they most diligently forewarned them to beware newfangled teachers, whom they called Herctiques; who should breake from the vnitie of this vniuersal bodie, already made and knit together; and should deuise new gloses, exposition, and interpretations of Scripture; bring in new senses, doctrines, opinions & diuisions; to the renting of Gods Church and Citie now builded, and to the perdition of infinite soules.
               For discerning of which kinde of most pernicious people, (as S. Austen and other Aug.

And that the only Anckor, staie, and securitie of a Christian mans my nde in matters of beleefe for his saluation, was to be a Catholike; that is, See S. Hie

both of hym self and others, doth subiect his iudgment to the determination of Christes vniuersal visible and knowen Church vpon earth, embrasing whatsoeuer that beleeueth, and abādoning whatsoeuer that reiecteth. And this is that plaine, direct, sure, and infallible waye among Christians, whereof we spake out of Esaie and other prophetes and Saintes of God before, wherin no man can erre though neuer so simple, but only of wilful and obstinate malice; which is declared in this maner followinge.

For so it was foreshewed and promissed most perspicuouslie by Daniel, when he foretelling the soure great Monarchies, that after him should ensue, adioineth thes euident wordes, of the church and kingdome of Christ: In the daies of thes kingdomes, shal 
                  Dan. 2. 
                  God raise vp a Celestial kingdome, vvhich shal indure for euer, vvithout subuersiō; & that kingdome shal not be deliuered ouer to any other people. By which last wordes, as also by diuers promisses of Christ hym self in the Math. 16. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . 28. Ghospel, we are acertained, that the very

same visible congregatiō, Church, bodie, common weale, gouernment, and kingdome, which was established by the Apostles in their time, should endure and continue by succession of folowers, vnto the worlds ende: neither should it passe ouer or be deliuered to any other people; that is, no new teachers or later doctrines dissenting from the first, should euer finallie preuaile against it. Which prophetie to haue bene fulfilled frō that day vnto this, is made euident and most apparant, by the recordes of al ages; wherin, albeit diuers errours and heresies haue sprong vp, and made great blustering and disturbance for a time: yet haue they bene repressed and beate doune againe, by the same Church, and her visible pillars in the ende.
               For examples sake; in the first age, there rose vp certaine seditious fellowes amōg No Heresie euer 
                        〈◊〉
                      again, the Churche. the Iewes, making some cōtention about their ceremonies, as also did Simon Magus, Nicolaus, Cerinthus, Ebion, and Menander, that were heretiques. Against whō, (besides the Apostles,) stoode ī defence of that which was published before, their Disciples, S. Martialis, S. Dionisius Areopagita, Ignatius, Policarpus, & others. In the secōd age, rose vp Basilides, Cerdon, Marcion, Valentinus, Tacianus, Apelles, Montanus and diuers others: against whom stoode in the battaile, Iustinus Martyr, Dionisius bishop of Corinth. Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertulian, and their equals. And so douneward

frō age to age vnto our daies, whatsoeuer heresie, or different opinion hath bene raised contrary to the general consent of this vniuersal bodie; it hath bene checked and controlled by the watchmē, pastours, & chief gouernours of this bodie; and finally, hath bene condemned and anathematized by their general assemblies, consent, and councelles, gathered from time to time, as occasions serued in al partes of the world. Wherby it is most manifest, that he, who relieth vpon this general consent of Christes Church in A secure vvaye. earth, and adhereth to nothing against the iudgmēt of the same; cā not possibly erre in matters of beleefe, but walketh in that sure, secure, and infallible path, wherin Esaye sayeth, that a very foole can not Esa. 52. goe amisse.
               Wherfore, to conclude this first parte of our present speech, cōcerning the trial The cōclusion of the first parte. of our faith and beleefe: he that is a true Catholique, and holdeth hym self within th' obedience of this general and vniuersal Church, which hath descended by succession from Christ and his Apostles: that is, as olde Vincentius said eleuen hundred years agoe, in his most excellent treatise Vincent. lirin. li cont. heres. against innouations of heretiques: he that Ioueth the Churche and bodie of Iesus Christ so much, as he preferreth nothinge in the world before the Catholique and vniuersal doctrine therof: not any priuat mans authoritie, loue, wit, or eloquence; not reasons of nature or pretēce of scriptures,

against that which before hym was beleeued by all men: he that followeth vniuersalitie, antiquitie, and consent in his beleefe; and standeth firmelie to that faith, which hath bene held from time to time in al places, in al seasons, by al or the most parte of Bishopes, Priestes, and Doctours in Christianitie: he that cā say with S. Augustine, that he trulie followeth that vniuersal Church, which had her beginninge Aug. cont. epist. Manachaei cap. 4. & lib. de vera relig. cap. 7. by the enteringe in of Natiōs, got authoritie by miracles, was increased by charitie, and established by continuance: which hath her succession of bishopes from the Chaire of Peter vntil our time: that Church, whiche is knowen in the worlde by the name of Catholique, not onlie to her friendes, but also among her enimies, for that euen heretiques in common speech doe terme her so, hauinge no Marke this reason of S. Austen. other meanes to distinguishe them-selues and their followers from her, but by calling them reformers, Illuminates, vnspotted bretheren, and such other names that are different from Catholiques:
               
               
                  He that protesteth with S. Ierom, that he doth abhorre all sectes and names of particuler men; as Marcionistes, Montanistes, Valentinians and the like: he that Hieron. Dialog. cont. Luciferian. Cyprian. epist. 50. ad Cornel. epis. Rom. Gal. 5. doth confesse sincerlie with blessed Cyprian, that one priest for the time, is to be obeyed by gods ordinance, as iudge in Christes roome, by the vniuersal brotherhode of al Christianitie: he that is modest, quiete, sober, voide of contētion, & obedient,

                  Phil. 1. Tit. 3. Rom. 12. as S. Paul describeth a true and good Catholique: he that is humble i his owne cōcept, and aggreinge to humble thinges; firme in faith, & not variable, nor delighted vvith nevv doctrines: he that can captiuate his vnderstandinge 
                  Ephes. 4. Heb. 13. 2. Cor. 10. 
                  to the obedience of Christ, which is, to beleeue humblie such thinges, as Christ by his church proposeth vnto him, albeit his reason or sense should stande against the same: And finallie, he that can be content at Christes commandement, to heare the Church in al thinges, without Mat. 18. Mat. 23. doubt or exception, and obey the Gouernours therof, albeit in life they be Scribes and Pharises; and consequentelie, can say trulie, & sincerlie, with the whole Ambros. ep. 81. ad Syricium. Hieron. ad Pamach. Aug. serm. 81. de tép. College of Christes Apostles together, Creda sanctam Ecclesiam Catholicam, I doe belieue the holie Catholique & vniue: sal Church, and what soeuer that Church doth set furth, teach, holde, or beleeue: that man (no doubt) is in a most sure case for matters of his faith, and can not possiblie walke awry therin; but may thinke hym self a good Christian, for this first pointe, which is, for matters of beliefe.
               THERE FOLLOVVETH the second THE. 2. parte of this chapter. OF good syfe. parte of Christian profession, concerning life and manners; which is a matter of so much more difficultie then the former, by how many more wayes a man may be lead from vertuous life, then from sincere faith. Wherin ther can be no comparison at all, seing the pathe of our beliefe is so manifest (as hath beneshewed,) that no

mā cā erre therin, but of inexcusable wilfulnes. Which wilfulnes in errour, the holie See S. Aug. lib. de vtilit. cred. c. 1. & tract. 1. in epist. Iohan. Cyprian. ep. 61 fathers of Christes primatiue Church, did alwayes referre to two principal and original causes; that is, to pride or ouerweening in our owne concepts; and to malice against our superiours, for not giuing vs contentation in things that we desire. Of the first doe proceede, the deuising of new opinions; new glosing, Tvvo causes of heresie. expounding, and applying of Scriptures; the calling of holy writ it self in question; the contempt of auncient customes  and traditions; the preferring of our iudgments before al others, either present or past; the debasing of holie Fathers, priests prelates, Councels, ordinances, constitutions, and al other thinges, and proofes what so euer, that stand not with our owne good liking and approbatiō. Of the  second fountaine, are deriued other qualities, conformable to that humour; as are, the denying of Iurisdictiō and authoritie in our Superiours; the contempt of Prelates; th' exaggeration of the faults and defectes of our Gouernours; th' impugnation of al Bishoplike dignitie, or ecclesiastical eminentie, and especially of the Sea Aposto lique, wherunto appertainet the correction of such like offendours; & finally, for satisfying this deuilishe and The doinges of heretiques. most pernicious veine of malice, thos wicked reprobates, doe incite and arme the people against their spiritual pastours; they enkindle factions against Gods annointed

substitutes; they deuise a new Church, a new forme of gouernment, a new kingdome, and ecclefiastical hierarchie vpon earth, wherby to bring men in doubt and staggering, what or whom to beleeue, or wherunto to haue recourse in such difficulties as doe arise.
               Thes two maladies (I save) of Pride Th' obseruation of S. Cyprian. and Malice, haue bene the two causes of obstinate errour in al heretiques from the beginning; as ful wel noted that holy and auncient martir S. Cyprian, when he said Cyprian. epist. 65. ad Rogatian. so longe agoe: Thes are the beginnings and original causes of heretiques and wicked schismatsques: first, to please and like wel of them selues; and then, being puffed vp with the swelling of pride, to cōtemne their gouernours & superiours. Thus doe they abandone and forsake the church: thus doe they erect a prophane Altar out of the church, agaīst the church: Thus doe they breake the peace and vnitie of Christ, and doe rebell against Gods holie ordination.
               
               Now then, as thes are the causes, either only or principal of erring ī our beleefe; Many causes of euill lyse. most facile and easie (as we see) to be discerned: so of errour in life & maners, ther are many more occasions, causes, ofspringes, and fountaines to be found. That is to saye, so many in number, as we haue euil passions, inordinate appetites, wicked desires, or vnlauful inclinations within our mynde; euery one wherof, is the cause oftentimes of disordered life, and breach of

Gods commandementes. For which respect, ther is much more set doune ī Scripture, for exhortation to good life, then to faith; for that the errour herein is more ordinary and easie, and more prouoked by our owne frailtie, as also by the multitude of infinite temptations. Wherfore we read that our Saueour Iesus in the verie beginning of his preaching, straight after he was baptised, & had chosen vnto hym S. Peter and S. Andrew, Iames and The effect of Christs first sermon. Math. 5. 6. 7. Iohn, & some other few Disciples, wēt vp to the moūtaine, & ther made his first most excellēt, famous, and copious sermon, recited by S. Mathew in three whole chapters; wherin he talketh of nothing els, but of vertuous life, pouertie, meekenes, iustice, puritie, sorowe for sinne, patience in suffering, contempt of riches, forgyuing of iniuries, fasting prayer, penance, entring by the strait gate; and finally, of perfection, holines, and integritie of cō
                  uersation; and of the exact fulfilling of euery iote of Gods lawe and commaundementes.
               He assured his Disciples with greate asseueration, that he came not to breake Math. 5. v. 20. the law, but to fulfil the same; and consequentelie, whosoeuer should breake the least of his commaundementes, and should so teache men to doe; that is, should perseuer Math. 5. therein, without repentance, and so by his example drawe other men to doe the like: should haue no place in the kingdome of heauen. Againe, he exhorted thē
                  
most earnestlie to be lightes, and to shyne by good workes, to all the world, and that excepte their iustice did exceede the iustice of Scribes and pharises, (which was but ordinarie and external,) they Ibid. v. 21. could not be saued. He told them plainlie, they might not serue two masters in this life, but either must forsake God or abandon Mammon. He cried vnto them, Attendite, stand attent, and consider well your Cap. 6. Cap. 7. state and condition: and then againe; seeke to enter by the straite gate. And lastlie, he concludeth, that th' onlie trial of a good tree, is the good fruite which it yeeldeth; without which fruite, let the tree be neuer so faire or pleasant to the eye, yet, is it to be cut downe & burned; & that not euerie one who shal say or crie vnto hym, Lord, Lord, at the last daye should be saued, or enter into the kingdome of heauen; but onlie such, as did execute in deedes, the wil and commaundementes of his father in this life. For want wherof, he assureth them, that manie at that daye, who had not onlie belieued, but also donne miracles in his name, should be denied, reiected, and abandonned by hym.
               Which longe lesson of vertuous life, being the first that euer our Saueour gaue in publique to his Disciples then newlie Faith is not sufficient vvithout vvorckes. gathered together, as S. Mathew noteth; (hauing treated verie litle of pointes of faith before, but onlie in general by some miracles and preachinge, hauinge shewed hymself to be the true Messias:) doth sufficientlie

teache vs, that it is not enoughe to beleeue in Iesus, and to make professiō of his name and doctrine; except we conforme our lyues and actions accordinge to the prescript of his commaundmentes. For albeit in Christian religion, faith be the first and principal foundation, whervpon all the rest is to be stayed and grounded: yet as in other material buildinges, after the foundation is layed, ther remaineth A similitude touching faith & vvorks. the greatest labour, time, cost, cunning, and diligence, to be bestowed vpon the framinge and furnishinge of other partes that must insue: euen so in this celestial edifice or buildinge of our soule, hauing layed once the foundation and grounde of true beliefe, (which a Christian oftentimes dispacheth in the space of In learning ouer his Catechisme. one weekes learninge;) the rest of al our life, time, labour, and studies, is to be employed in the perfecting of our life and actions, and as it were, in raising vp the walles & other partes of our spiritual buil ding, by the exercise of al vertues, and diligent obseruation of Gods commaundements. Without the which, our faith is to no more purpose or profite, then is a foundation without a building vpon it, or a stocke or tree that beareth no fruite. Which thinge S. Iames expresseth most excellentelie in this fit similitude. Euen as a bodie vvithout spirite is dead; so is saith vvithout 
                  Iac. 2. 
                  vvorkes.
               
               Which necessary point of vertuous life and obseruing Gods commandements, for

that certaine carnal and sensual Christiās An anciēt errour of sensual men about faith & vvorkes in the primatiue Church, euen yet whiles the Apostles thē selues were aline, would in no wise vnderstande aright; but for pleasing their owne appetites, deuised vpon certaine darke and hard speeches of S. Paul, that only faith was sufficient to saue them: S. Austine and other auncient fathers were of opinion, that not only thes last wordes of S. Iames, & the whole discourse which he maketh of this matter in that chapter; but also both his and all other Apostles writinges, set forth and published after S. Pauls epistles, were prin cipally to represse this most absurde and pernicious errour. For declaratiō wherof, I wil allege only thes words of S. Augustine folowing, expresly writē in a booke for this purpose, intituled of faith & good workes. Thus then he beginneth.
               For that this wicked opinion of only faith, was sprong vp in the Apostles time, by ill vnderstāding of S. Paul; al the other S. Austem discourse. Apostolical epistles which ensue, of S. Peter, S. Iohn, S. Iames, and S. Iude, were directed principally to this ende, to proue 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      de 
                        〈◊〉
                     . & oper. cap. 14. with al vehemencie, that faith without good workes is nothing worth. Euen as in deed S. Paul him self did not define euery maner of faith, wherby we beleeue in God; but only meaneth that profitable & euangelical faith, which hath workes annexed, proceeding of charitie. And as for Gal. 5. that faith, which is without workes, and yet seemeth to thes men to be sufficient

for their saluation; he protesteth, that it is so vnprofitable, as he doubteth not to save of hym self; If I should haue all faith, in 
                  1. Cor. 13. 
                  such sort, is I vvere able to moue mountaines, & yet had not charitie; I vvere nothing. By which charitie (no doubt) good life is meant, for that, as in an other place it is said: Charitie 
                  Rom. 13. 
                  is the fulfilling of al the lavv. Wherfore S. Peter most euidently, in his secōd epistle, hauing exhorted men to holines of life and maners; sheweth, that certaine wicked persons tooke occasion by some obscure sentēces of S. Paul, to promisse them selues securitie of saluatiō, by only faith. Which hard sentences, S. Peter affirmeth, that thes miserable mē, peruerted to their owne destruction, as they did also other holiescriptures; seing that S. Paul was of the verie same opinion, that the other Apostles were concerning life euerlasting to be obtained by none, but by such onlie, as ioined vertuous life with their beliefe. But S. Iames of al other, is most vehement against al such, as thinke that faith can suffice to saluation without good workes; in so much, as he compareth them to the deuils thē selues, saying: Doest thou belieue that there is one God? thou doestvvel: 
                  Iacob. 2. 
                  the deuils also doe belieue the same and tremble. What could be spokē more truly, briefly, and vehemently then this? seing in the Ghospel we read, that the deuils made the same confession of Christes deitie, that Marc. 1. Mat. 16. did S. Peter, and yet Christ commended the one, and reprehended the other. &c.

Wherfore, let not simple mindes be deceyued, Ibid. c. 22 & thincke that they knowe God, if they confesse hym with a dead faith; that is, with a faith voide of good works as deuils doe, for that they read (perhappes) in scripture thes wordes of Christ; this is life euerlasting, that men knovve thee the true God, and Iesus Christ vvhom thou hast sent: 
                  Ioa. 17. Lett them not (I saye) be deceyued with this; but lett them remēber, how Christes Apostle expoundeth that saying, when he writeth; By this vve knovve God (trulie,) is vve keepe his Commaundementes; and vvho soeuer 
                  1. Ioh. 2. 
                  sayeth, that he knovveth hym, and yet keepeth not his Commaundementes: he is a liar, and the truth is not in hym.
               
               Thus farre S. Augustine, declareth this veritie out of the scriptures; and he addeth Enchirid. cap. 67. further in an other place, the testimonie of S. Paul for comprobation hereof, who admonished the people of Corinthus in thes wordes: Deceyue not your selues: nether fornicatours, nor adulterours, nor 
                  2. Cor. 6. 
                  theeues, nor couetous persons, nor backbiters, nor drunckards, shal obtaine the kingdome of God. Which S. Augustin proueth, that S. Paul in truth could neuer haue auouched; if the Corinthians by onlie faith might haue escaped damnation.
               The very same discourse maketh S. Gregorie the great, out of holie write The proose vsed by S. Gregorie. vpon this pointe. For hauinge considered thos most confortable wordes of Christ to S. Thomas, blessed are they vvho haue not seene, and yet haue beleeued: he annexeth as Iohn. 20.
                  
followeth. Perhaps here, euerie Christian will saye within hym self, I doe belieue and therfore I am blessed, & shalbe saued. Greg. hom. 29. in Euā. Wherin he saith truth, if his life be answerable to his beleefe. For that a true faith doth not contradicte in maners, the thiges which it professeth in wordes. For which cause, it was said of certaine false Christians, by S. Paul; that they confessed 
                     Tit. 1. 1. Ioh. 2. 
                     God in vvordes, but denied hym in deedes, and by S. Iohn; that vvho soeuer saith, he knovveth God, and keepeth not his commaundements, is a lyar. Which being so; we must examine the truth of our faith, by consideration of our lyfe: for then, and not otherwise, are we true Christians; if we VVhat vve promissed in Baptisme. fulfill in workes, that wherof we haue made promisse in wordes: that is; in the daye of our baptisme, we promissed to renounce the pompe of this world, togyther with all the workes of iniquitie; which promisse, if we perfourme now Li. 33. moral. cap. 7. after baptisme; thē are we true Christiās, and maye be ioyful. And in an other place the same holie father addeth this. For that diuers men, are Christians in profession and faith onlie, and not in life: herehence it is said, by the voice of truth it self; Not euerie one that shall say to me Lord 
                     Math. 7. 
                     Lord, shall enter into the kingdome of heauen. And againe: vvhie doe you call me Lord, Lord, and doe not perfourme the thinges that I tell you? Herehence it is, that God cōplained of his olde people the Iewes, saying; this people ho 
                     Malac. 7. 
                     noureth we vvith their lippes, but their hart is
                     
                     sarre of from me. And the Prophet Dauid of the same people: they loued hym vvith their 
                     Psal. 77. 
                     mouth, and vvith their tongues they lyèd 
                           〈◊〉
                         hym. Wherfore, lett no man trust that his faith may saue hym without good deedes, seing that we know it is writen expresselie; that faith vvithout vvorkes is dead: and Iacob. 2. consequentelie, can not be profitable, or saue vs from damnation. Hytherto S. Gregorie.
               
               Which verie conclusion S. Chrysostome maketh with great vehemencie, vpon consideration The testimonie and exhortation of S. Chrysostome. Math. 25. of that woesull chaunce and heauie iudgemet, that happned vnto him, who in the Ghospel, was admitted to the feast of Christian faith and knowledge, but for lacke of the ornament or garment of good life, was most cōtumeliouslie depriued of his expectatiō; of whō S. Chrysostoms wordes are thes. He was īuited to the feast & brought into the table; but for that by his fowle garment, he dishonored our Lord that had īuited hym: heare how miserable and lamentable a punishemēt he suffered. He was not onlie thrust from the Chryshom. 2. in Iohan. table & banquet; but also bounde hand & foote, and cast into vtter darkenes, wher ther is eternal weepinge and gnashing of teeth. Wherfore, lett vs not, deare bretheren, lett vs not (I saye) deceyue our selues, and immagine, that our faith will saue vs without good worckes. For except we ioyne pure lyfe to our beleefe, and in this heauenlie vocation of ours, doe apparrel our selues with worthie garmentes of

vertuous deedes, wherby we may be admitted at the mariage daye in heauen: nothing shall be able to deliuer vs from the damnation of this miserable man, that wanted his weddinge weede. Which thingt S. Paul well noteth, when hauinge said; vve haue an euerlasting hovvse in heauen, not made by mans handes: he addeth presentelie 2. Cor. 5. this exception; sitamen vestiti & non nudi inueniamur, that is, if we be founde at that daye, well apparreled & not naked.Would God euerie Chistian desyrous of his saluation, would ponder well this discourse and exhortation of S. Chrysostom.
               And so with this alone, to conclude our speech in this chapter, without allegation The cōclusion of this chapter. of further matter or authorities, (which are infinite to this effect;) it may appeare by that which hath already bene set doune, wherin the true profession of a Christian consisteth; and therby eche man that is not partial, or blinded in his owne affection, (as many are,) may take a vewe of his estate and condition, and frame vnto him self a verie probable coniecture, how he is like to speed at the last accompting daie; that is; what profite or dōmage he may expect, by his knowledge and profession of Christian religion. For as to him that walketh vprightly in that vocation, and perfourmeth effectually euerie waye his professed dutie; there remaine both infinite and inestimable rewardes prepared: so to him that strayeth a syde, and swarueth from the

right path of lyfe or faith prescribed vnto him; there are no lesse paines and punishmēts referued. For which cause, euery Christian that is careful of his saluation, ought to fixe his eye verie seriouslie vpon them both; and as in beleefe to shew him self constant, firme, humble, obedient, and in one worde, Catholique: so in life and conuersation, to be honest, iust, pure, innocent, and holie.
               And for that, this second point concerning life and maners, is of more difficultie (as hath bene shewed) then the other of beleefe, (wherof notwithstanding we haue also treated sufficiently in the former chapters:) the rest of this whole worke, shal tende to the declaration of this later part, I meane of good life; therby to stirre vp and awake, (if so it may please the merciful goodnes of our blessed Saueour;) the slouthful hartes of Christians, to the cogitatiō of their owne estate, and make them more vigilant in this greate affaire, wheron dependeth their endles woe or welfare.
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  THE PRINT BEING come to this place, M. Bunneys edition of this booke vvas deliuered to me, out of vvhose infinite corruptions, maymes, and mā
                     glinges, diuers thinges shalbe noted hereafter in the margent.
               
            
            
               
               OF THE TWO PRINCIPAL POINTES THAT DOE APPERTAINE TO A Christian life; that is to saye: To resist all synne, and to excercise all kynde of vertue; vvith the meanes and methode hovv to perfourme them both. CHAPT. VI.
               SVPPOSINGE that in the partes of this booke which ensue, we are to deale only with suche, as are instructed and settled in true Christian faith; (wherunto we haue The reason of this Chapter. proued before, that vertuous life and good deeds are necessarily to be adioined,) it semeth conuenient in this place, to treate of the pointes or prīcipal partes belonging therunto. Which partes, are briefly prescribed by God hym self, in the writinges of Dauid, Esaie, and other prophetes Psal. 36. Esa. 1. of the olde testament, exhorting men, to decline from vice, and to embrace vertue.
                  
But much more plainly by S. Peter, S. Paul, and other Apostles of the Euangelical law: the first affirming, that the fruite and effect of Christes death and passion was; that vve being dead to sinne: should liue to 
                  1. Pet. 2. Tit. 2. 
                  Iustice: and the other adioining; that the grace of God our saueour, appeared to al men, instructing vs to this ende, that vve renouncing al vvickeanes, should liue iustly and godly in this vvorld.
               
               By which testimonies of holy write, The tvvo partes of good life. is made cleare and euidēt, that the whole dutie of a good Christian, is reduced to thes two heades or principles; to wit, to the resistance of al euil, and to th' exercise of al pretie and vertue. In respect of the first wherof, our life is called in holie scripture, a warfare vpon earth; and vertuous Iob. 7. 2. Cor. 10. mē are termed souldiours; for that, as good souldiours doe lye in continual wayte to resist their ennemies: so vigilant Christians doe carefully stand vpon their watche, for resisting the suggestions and temptatiōs of sinne. In regarde of the second Mat. 9. 10 20. Tim. 5. pointe, we are named labourers, husbandmen, sowers, marchātes, bankers, stewards, fermers, and the like; and our whole life is termed a marte and trafique; for that, as thes kinde of people, doe attēd with diligēce to their gaine and encrease of tēporal riches in this life: so ought we to applie our selues wholy, in the cōtinual exercise of good workes, for augmētation of our merite and treasure in the world to come.
               
                  
Thes then are the two partes of a good Christian life; the two principal pointes wherupon we should meditate; the exercises wherin we should be occupied; the two legges wherupon we should walke towards our Countrie; the two armes wherwith we should laye faste-hand on Godes eternal kingdome; the two winges wherby we must flie and mount vp to heauē. So that, whosoeuer doth want any one One of thes partes not auailable vvithout the other. of thes two partes, albeit he had the other; yet can he neuer ascende to Godes blisse; no more then a bird can flie, being maimed of one of her winges. My meaning is; that neither integritie of life, is sufficiēt without good workes; nor good workes auailable, without a pure and vndefiled life. The later is made cleare by Gods owne speeches, to the people of Israel; whos sacrifices, oblations, praiers, and other such workes; that were commended and commaunded by hymself, he oftentimes reiected, and accompted abhominable, for that the presentours and exhibitours Esa. 1. Iere. 6. Amos. 5. therof, were men of impious and wicked conuersation. The former also is apparantly shewed, by Christes parable of the foolishe virgins; who albeit they were Virgins, and incontaminate from sinne: yet because they lacked the oile of good workes, to giue light in their lampes: they were excluded from the mariage banquet, as also that other most infortunate Mat. 25. Luc. 13. fellow was, who wanted his wedding ornament. Both thes pointes then

are necessarie to a Christian mans saluation, & that so necessarie; as the one without the other is not auailable.
               
                  AND FOR THE FIRST, which is resisting of sinne; we are commaunded by THE. 1. parte of resisting sinne. Godes holy worde, to doe it manfully, vigilantly, and constantly. And S. Paul addeth moreouer; that in this resistance, we ought to striue euen vnto death, and to the Heb. 10. Ephe. 5. Iac. 4. 1. Pet. 5. shedding of our last blood, if occasion doe require. The same are we taught by diuers other Apostles and Saintes in Christes Church, exhorting and instructing vs to this fight and cōbat with the flesh, world, & deuil, that entice vs to sinne. For proofe wherof, it shal suffice in this place, to alleage thos last wordes of Iob, which doe conclude his large discourse of the most dreadful power and crueltie of Leuiathā; Memento belli; 
                  be not vnmindeful of the Iob. 40. warre, which thou wagest with this ennimy.
               
               Which warre and resistance, is to be Hovv perfect our resistāce must be. performed with such exquisite diligence, and firme resolution on our behalf: as it behoueth vs, not only to withstand the committing of any one actual sinne; but also the very consent of minde therunto. For so we are commaunded expresly; bevvare least at any time, thou giue consent vnto 
                  Tob. 4. 
                  any sinne. Concerning which thing, it is briefly to be noted, that sinne may be committed either in deed or in wil alone. And to this later kinde, al diuines agree, and proue it by S. Iames, that ther are three Iacob. 4.
                  
degrees; to witt; Suggestion, Delectation, Aug. l. 1. de ser. do. cap. 23. & li. 12. de Trin. cap. 12. and Consent. Wherof, as the first is of the ennimie; the second. of our sensualitie; the third, of reason: so may the first be without fault; the second includeth (for the most part) some negligence; the third 
                     Three degrees to sinne. Greg. ad inter. 11. August. 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   conuinceth vs alwaies of iniquitie. Or to vse the verie wordes of S. Gregorie the great. In Suggestion, is the seede of sinne; in Delectation, the norrishment; in Consent, the persection. So that, who soeuer doth but only yeeld consent of minde to the perfourmance of any vnlauful act, so farr foorth, as he would committ the same, if he had time, place, and abilitie therunto: is condemned by holy write, in the guilt of that sinne, as deeply, as if in deed he had now actuallie committed the same. So Christ Mat. 5. him self, in the matter of adulterie expresly pronounced, and long before that, Exod. 12. Deut. 5. by the mouth of Moyses, he determined the like in other offenses of the people of Israel.
               In consideration of which seuere determination, it is most wonderful and dreadful to consider, (our selues being so The diligence of auncient auncient in resisting sinne. negligent herein as we are,) what great attention, watche, care, and feare, holy Saintes of God in times past had, in this point of resisting sinne, and the very first motions and temptations therof. In times past (I saie) in thos blessed daies of antiquitie, when the spirite of God was yet hoate and boiling in the breastes of his deuout seruants, and when recheles sensualitie

had not so ouerwhelmed the world as now it hath. We read of the iust and most blessed man Iob, that notwithstanding all his integritie & perfection Of Iob. of life; yet did he diligently discusse and feare euery the least of his owne Iob. 9. actions; being wel assured (as he protesteth,) that God doth not pardon such as are negligent, and doe offend him therin. Holy Dauid also, though he were a king; yet did he euery night, brushe or svveepe his 
                  Of Dauid. 
                  spiri e, by diligēt examination or the very Psal. 76. cogitations and inward motions of his hart. In which exercise S. Paul, that most Of S. Paul. worthie Apostle and exact obseruer of his maisters commaundemētes, was so precise and careful; as albeit he were assaulted with many strong and violent temptations of the flesh, by Satans suggestion: yet by his owne diligent resistance together with the assistance of Gods holy grace, 1. Cor. 4. which was giuen vnto him particularly for that combat; he preserued his minde so pure and vnspotted from al blot of cō
                  sent: as after the victorie obtained, he durst affirme of him self, that to his knowledge, he was guiltie of no fault or 2. Cor. 12. offence.
               For better obtaining of which victorie, it is most probable, that he vsed External helpes for the resisting of sinne. 2. Cor. 6. 11. 1. Tim. 1. thos external helpes & remedies of much fasting, lōg praying, paineful watchig, & rigourous chastising of his owne bodie, which he mentioneth in his writinges. To which ende appertained in like maner,

the same and like exercises recorded by S. Paul and other writers, to haue bene 1. Cor. 9. vsed by the rest of the Apostles; that is to saie, Thes thīges Bunney clippeth as not so necessarie for Ministers. diuers and frequent austerities, and bodely mortifications, therby to bring their flesh in subiection to their spirites, and to make them selues more able to withstand al sinful temptations and suggestions of the aduersarie. So Egisippus, Eusebius, and others doe make wonderful Egis apud Enseb. li. 2. lust. cap. 23. Of S. Iames
                   narrations of the strait diet, apparrel, and forme of life vsed by S. Iames the iust, in whom they recorde among other thinges, that with continual praying vpon his knees, the skine therof was made so hard as the braune of a Camels knee. The like or rather more straunge thinges, doth Philo Philo. lib. 4. de vit. contempt. Of S. Mark
                   the Iewe set foorth in the life and exercises of S. Marke, & of his disciples that liued in Alexandria, who by their exquisite seueritie in this behalf, droue into admiration euen thos, that were aduersaries of their religion. By imitation of which first and perfect Christians, in this combat of resisting sinne, diuers other did afterward take in hand that strait course of life, wherof we read with admiration in aunciēt writers, as Bunney doubteth vvhether S. Anthonie had sufficiīt groundvvorke of his dainge; but Athanasius doubted not. S. Anthonie, whos life is recorded by holy Athanasius; Paul and Hilarion, whos wonderful actes are set doune by S. Ierome; and infinite other, whos most admirable and rare austerities are described by Cassianus, almost twelue 10. Cass. de Inst.  hundred yeares gone.
               Al which exercises tended to this only.

ende, to enhable them selues the better to stand in the fight and bataile against al wickednes and sinne. This was the beginning of austeritie of life, in thos first fathers and founders of our religion. This was the cause of first leauing the world The reason of Monastical life in the beginninge. and flying to the desert. This was the origine of al Monasteries, Cloisters, Eremitages, Celles, & Solitarie habitatiōs. And finally, this was the reason of al breach and separation from flesh and blood, and from al wordly conuersation; therby to eschue al occasions of external temptations, and by that meanes, to gather the more force and strength, for resistance of the internal. In which internal conflict not with standing, the combat oftentimes was so sharpe and vehement; as it is most wonderful to consider, what is recorded by the forsaid writers, touching assaults endured in this behalfe, by thos auncient Saintes that had left the world, and what extreme paines and afflictions they susteined willingly, for continuing their resistance against their spiritual aduersarie. Which thinges were sett doune (no doubt) & left writen to vs by Gods holie prouidence, for our confusion that now liue, who are so careles and negligent in resustinge th' assaultes and temptations of synne as we make no accompt or estimation ther of at all.

wilde desert of Syria: was most terribly tempted (not vnlike to S. Paul,) with suggestions 2. Cor. 12. of the fleshe. But what did he for resisting of this temptation? and what successe had he therin? You shal heare reported by this his owne declaratiō. O (saieth Hiero. epi. 22. ad Eust. he,) how often being in the wildernes & vaste desert, burnt vp and scorched by the extreame heates of the Sunne, (wherin the Moūkes of my time had their vglie habitations,) was I tempted with cogitations of Romane delights? &c. I sat alone, for that I was replenished with sorowe and bitternes. The partes of my bodie were now become deformed, and vglie with continual wearing of my sacke: and my skinne was as blacke, as the skinne of an Ethiopian. I wept daily and passed my time continually in groning: And when at length, sleepe came vpon me against my wil; I laic doune & did beate my bare bones, scarse hanging togither, against the ground. Of my meate & drincke I wil The auste risie of olde Mounkes. saie nothing; wheras in this place, we that are Mōkes, doe vse only colde water euen when we be sicke, and doe thincke it a great delicacie to taste any one thing that sauoureth of the fire.
               
               
                  I therfore being in this case, and hauing shut my self vp in this prison for feare of helfire, & for auoyding of sinne; being fellow now only to scorpions and wilde beastes, and wholy worne out with continual fasting: yet could I not auoide the temptations of the flesh &c. Wherfore I

did cast my self doune at the feet of Iesus: I did bathe the ground about me with S. Ieroms cōbat vvith tentatiōs of the fleshe. teares, and dried the same vp againe with my owne heare. I did represse my rebellious flesh, with continual abstinence of whole weekes togyther. I am not ashamed to confesse this miserie of my wretched estate. I remember that I cried vnto Iesus whole daies and nightes togyther, and ceassed not to beate and knocke my breaste, vntil he arose & rebuked my enimie, and therby restored to me my former tranquillitie. I perseuered in praier in that forlorne and sauuage desert, (being angrie and rigourous against my self,) & I hampered with imprisonment my miserable flesh, as our Lord is my witnes, vntil at length after infinite teares shed, and my verie sighte dazeled with long looking vp and beholding the heauens, I seemed The consolation of stryuinge, in stryuinge ende. againe to be restored to the companie & felowship of Angēls. Wherwith being made exceeding ioyful, and replenished (as it were) with al kinde of diuine and Celestial solace; I beganne to sing againe within my self, that most pleasant songe: vve shal novv rūne after the svvet sauour of thy 
                     Cant. 1. 
                     fragrant ointments, O Lord.
                  
               
               Thus did thes blessed fathers & Saintes of God behaue them selues: and thus did The miserable state of mosie Christiās at this daye. they esteeme them selues bound to doe, for resisting of sinne, and for maintenance of their integritie, against the wicked assaultes of their ghostly enimie; remembring wel how it is written; fight valiantly
                  
                  for thy soule, and striue vnto death for maintenance of iustice. But (alas) deare brother, Eccle. 4. how doe we behaue our selues in this importāt busines? what doe we? what paines take we? what attention, what vigilance doe we hold vpon our thoughtes, wordes and actions? what caution doe we vse? what resistance doe we make? Is ther any man that flieth the occasions of sinne, or rather prouoketh not the same? is ther any now adayes that mortisieth his fleshe, or rather doth not cherishe and pamper it to wickednes? is ther any man that represseth his owne appetites? that standeth in fight against sensual suggestions? nay rather, doth not al the world runne after their owne concupiscences? doe they not yeeld them selues as slaues to euery temptatiō that doth arise? to euery assault that the enimie maketh? doe they not deuoure euery hooke which the deuil layeth for their intrappinge, and swalow doune euerie poisonned baite, that is cast for their destructiō? O merciful Lord, what a pitiful state of the world is this? harcken (good Christian) how this case of a careles sensual man is described, euen by the very fingar of God hym self. I looked forth through the barres of my wīdowe (sayeth The description of a man than follovveth his concupiscence. Prou. 2.
                      the diuine wisdome of God;) and I sawe and considered a fond yong fellowe, who walked by corners of the streates ī darkenes, &c. And ther ranne vnto hym a woman, decked vp like an harlot, and prepared to deceyue soules, &c. she enticed hym

by flatterie, and many sweet speeches, and entangled hym with stronge alluremētes. Presently, he folowed her as an oxe ledde vnto the slaughter, and as a wanton skippinge lambe that is caried to the shambles; like a birde that maketh haste to the snare; so foloweth he, not knowing seely sotte, that he is drawen to fetters, and that the daunger of his soule dependeth thereon, vntill his harte be strocken through. &c.
               
               This is the description which the holy The bondage and daunger by yeldinge to our concupiscence. Ghoste vseth, to set out vnto vs the miserable condition of a dissolute and recheles Christian, which hath no care of resisting temptations, but folovveth euery suggestion of his owne sensual appetite, and therby, not only woundeth to death his owne hart and soule, by euery consent he yeeldeth: but also, (as the Scripture here noteth,) enthralleth him self in such miserable bondage and captiuitie, and casteth him self into so strong bandes & inextricable fetters of his ennimie; as he can not possibly afterwardes deliuer him self, but by some wonderful extraordinarie miracle wrought by God. For as truly Christes Apostle writeth; he that yeeldeth to

               To thes miseries (loe) and inexplicable The miseries of them that resist not sinne. calamities, is the world brought, by not resisting the temptations of sinne, but yeelding to euery vnlawful motion of our sensual appetites. According as it was foretolde so long ago, If thou permit thy soule

                  to haue her concupiscences; she vvill make thee a ioye and pray to thy enimies. Oh ye children of Adam, whye consider ye not this thinge? ô worldlinges, ô careles Christians, whie forget ye this pointe so necessarie to be pondered? is it possible that men should be so negligent, in their owne apparent, and irremediable daungers? The world is come now to that desperate cō

                  AND THVS HAVING shewed THE. 2. parte. OF labouring i good vvorkes. how euil souldiars we are in resisting our enimie; it remaineth to cōsider, how prudent marchātes and labourers we are for

encrease of our gaine and spiritual riches, by the exercise, negotiation, and trafique of good workes. About which point is to be obserued, that man from his first fal in paradise, was assigned to trauaile and take paines in this kinde of exercise, and in no sort to be idle. For so it is plainlie set doune in the booke of Genesis; man vvas placed in paradise to labour. And after Gen.

                   that, in diuers other places of the olde testainent, the spirite of God exhorted men Pro. 12. Eccle. 20. Iere. 4. to be paineful, industrious, and diligently to til such land, as God hath lent them for their gaine. Which the prophet Osce interpreteth thus; Seminate vobis Iustitiam, 
                  enrich Osee. 10. you selues by sowing iustice. And the wise man more plainly; vvhat soeuer thy hād 
                  Eccle. 9. 
                  can doe, doe it instantly. The reason of which exhortation, is set doune by the same instrumēt of Gods spirite, in an other place: Anima operantium impinguabitur. 
                  The soule of such as labour and take paine, shal be fattened; And againe: Seminanti Institiam, merces sidelis. To hym that soweth iusticc or good deeds, ther remaineth a faithful and sure reward. In respect wherof in the description of a blessed and fortunate mā, it was put for one principal qualitie by the prophete; that he receyued not his soule in 
                  Psal. 23. 
                  vaine, but laboured and employed the same to his greatest benefite. And this in the old testament.
               But in the new, wherin the most excellent Of laboring in the nevv. testament. merites of Christ, doe yeeld inestimable dignitie to al good workes that

are done in his name, this precept of labouring, hath much more place, and is more seriouslie recommended; for that by Christes spirite and aboundance of grace, we are more enhabled to performe the same; as may appeare by the wordes of God him self in Ezechiel, wher foretelling the times of the Messias to come, saieth. At that day, vvil I place my spirite in 
                  Ezech. 36 
                  you, and vvil bring to passe, that you shal vvalke in my commaundements, and shal labour and take paines. Which labour is to be vnderstoode, in performance of good workes, according as S. Paul describeth the condition of Christian people, when hecalleth thē, an acceptable people, clensed by Christes blood, to 
                  
                     Tit. 2. The definitiō of a good Christian. Ephe. 2.
                   
                  be a folovver of good vvorkes. And in an other place he defineth a good Christian to be, the had vvorke of God, created ī Christ, to vvalke in good vvorkes. And yet further Christ him self in the Ghospel declareth plainly, what the state and condition of Christiās is in this life, by the parable wherin he likeneth hym self to the riche banker, who committed diuers summes of money to his seruantes, with this charge; Negotiamini dum venio. 
                  Make ye your trafique Luc. 19. and commoditie, vntil I come and cal for an accompt.
               
               By al which is most manifest, that the life and vocation of a Christian in this The vocation of a Christian. world, is to labour and make his gaine by the talentes that God hath lent him; and to fructesie in al good vvorkes, as S. Paul exhorteth Gal, 6. vs. Hereby also doth appeare,

that the time of this our life, is nothing els but a certaine season alotted vs, wheri to sowe & plant; nothing els, but a fayer or marte wherin to trafique, negotiate, & make our exchaunge for the kingdome of heauen. In which affaire and negotiation, he that is diligent, painful, & industrious, is accompted a vvyse man, euen by Gods owne mouth: as on the contrary part, the Pro. 10. careles, slouthful, and negligent mā, is called the childe of confusion, voide of wit, and subiect to al miserie, contempt, and beggarie. Herehence are thos speeches of holie Scripture, Manus sortium dominabitur: 
                  Pro. 12. 
                  The hande of him, that laboureth with courage, shal preuaile and be potent. And againe; Robusti habebunt diu. tias. The stout & Pro. 11. painful shal haue welth at wil. And yet further; he that diligently tilleth his soile, shal aduance to great hight his rickes of corne. And to Eccle. 20. the negligent it is said on th' other side, Egestatem operata est manus remissa. 
                  The lazie Pro. 10. and slouthful hand, doth worke vnto his maister nothing els but beggarie. And finally, the more to confound our foly & lazines in this point, and to make deeper impression therof in our hartes, we are by holy writ referred, euen vnto the schoole and instruction of vnreasonable creatures in this behalfe. Goe thou slouthful and lither sellovv, (sayeth the wisdome of God) vnto 
                  Pro. 6. 
                  the Ant or emmote, and consider his vvayes, and by hym learne vvisdome. He hath neither gouernour nor maister to teach hym, and yet doth he in sommer make prouision of soode vvheron to liue
                  
                  and sustaine hym self in vvinter. By which wordes we are admonished, not only what is our dutie in this life, concerning labour and trauaile in good workes: but also, that the most excellent and supreme point of wisdome, which possibly can be imagined, is, to gather store in this time present, for the time to come, and to make our bancke here in this world, wheron to liue in the countrie wherunto we take our iourney.
               This is that great and rare wisdome, which is called in scripture, the vvisdome of 
                  
                     Christian vvisdome vvherin it consisteth. Prou. 9. Rom. 11. 2. Cor. 1. Esa. 33. Eccle. 6. 
                  Saintes, or rather as S. Paul termeth it, the wisdome of God him self, not knowen to the world. That wisdome, which Esay calleth diuitias salutis, the treasure of saluatiō. That, wherof the wise man saith; cogitare de illa sensus est consummatus, to thinke onlie and ponder vpon this kinde of wisdome, is most perfect vnderstanding and prudent knowledge. And againe: God loueth no man but hym that dvvelleth or remayneth 
                  Eccle. 7. 
                  vvith vvisdome. And finallie, to stirre vs vp to this kinde of wisdome, he maketh an ample exhortation, with a declaration of the nature, dignitie, & vtilitie therof, in thes wordes. Come to this wisdome, as he Eccle. 6. that soweth vpon hope of haruest; & haue patience for a tyme, to expect her fruites. Thou must labour and take paines a litle in her worke, and soone after shalt thou taste of the commodities she bringeth forth. Oh how vngrateful is she to the ignorant; and a foole will not abide her.

She is not reueiled to many; but to whom she is once knowen, with them she remaineth, vntill she bringe them vnto the sight and presence of God hym self &c. Harken therfore my sonne, & follow her wayes with all thy force &c. For that, at the last daye, thou shalt finde rest in her, & she shal turne thee to great ioye and consolation.
               
               This was that blessed and wise mans counsaile: and for fulfilling of this counsail, as also for obtaining the rest, ioye, & final consolation wherof here is mentiō; S. Paul crieth so vehementelie vnto vs, exhorting vs euerie wher to doe good workes, and that abundantelie, instantelie, Gal. 6. in al tymes, to all men, vpon al occasions, with immoueable constancie; assuring 1. Cor. 15. vs, that our labour herein shall not be lost, but that the tyme shall come, whē we shall reape incessantlie. To which purpose also, appertaineth the parable propounded by our Saueour of the prudent Steward, with a verie effectual exhortation Luc. 16. in the ende, that in this life we should purchase our selues friendes, by the vse and distribution of our wicked mammō, which friendes maye afterward make vs place in heauen. To this effect are directed all those admonitions of holie scripture. VVorke your ovvne saluation: And againe; bretheren, be ye careful to make your vocation 
                  Philip. 2. 2. Pet. 1. 
                  and election sure by good vvorkes. And yet further S. Paul adioyneth an other circumstance, therby to moue vs the soner,

saying; VVbile vve haue tyme lett vs doe good vvorkes; insinuating hereby, that this tyme Gal. 6. present was allowed vs onlie for that purpose, and that this tyme being past, ther would be no more place for such matters, a cording to that sage admonishement of our Saueour hym self; the night 
                  Ioan. 6.

                   of almes-deedes and charitable workes, yet exstant to the world, as witnesses of their excercise in this kinde of wisdome. So many commō wealthes established, so many churches builded and indued with abundant maintenāce; so many All thes

                      also hospitals. &c. By shopprickes, deanries, Archedeaconries, Chanonries, Prebendes, Chantries, and Benefices. So manie Hospitales and houses of Orphanes & fatherles infantes,

as also for the reliefe of other poore impotent and distressed people. So many Seminaries, Schooles, Halles, Colleges, and Vniuersities, for increase of learninge. So many Bridges, highe-wayes, Caussies, Townhouses, and other publique commodities. So many places of prayer and deuotion; as Monastaries, Abbayes, Priories, Couuentes, Nunries, Eremitages, Cells, Oratories, and other like, for repose of vertuous people that would leaue the worlde, and betake them selues onlie to contemplation of heauenlie thinges, and excercise of a more holie and retired life.
               Al which charitable deeds and many The charitable deeds of our auncestours & vvāt therof in vs. more that can not be recounted, came out of the purses and coffers of godlie Christians in auncient times; who very often gaue not only of their abondance and superstuities; but spared also from their owne sustenance and necessarie releefe; as also tooke awaie and aliened many things from their owne children and posteritie, to emploie thē in thes charitable vses, for the benefite of their soules. Wheras on the contrarie side, we that now liue in this miserable corrupt time, are so farre of from geuing away our necessaries, and plucking from our owne bodies to thes offices of charitie: that we make no scruple at all, to spoile the poore and godlie of thes benefites and releefes, which were left vnto them by our holie forefathers. And as for our owne superstuities and excesses, we seeke commōlie

to emploie them, rather on haukes, and dogges, and other brute beastes, (as sometimes also vpō much more vile vses,) then in charitable deedes to the releefe of our poore brethern, and to the ease of our owne soules in the life to come. So vtterly faileth the whole world at this daie, in performing this point of doing good deedes.
               Wherfore to drawe to a conclusion of this whole chapter: it may appeare by The perfection of Christian vocation, if it vvere fulfilled. that which hitherto hath bene said; first, what a perfect and most excellent creature a good Christian is; whos life is nothing els but a continual warfare and resistāce of al sinne, both I thought, word, and deed; and an incessant exercise of al pietie and good workes, which his hand or hart may possibly performe. Which kinde of life, if it were exactly fulfilled, in such sort as it was prescribed by Christ the authour of our profession: most euident it is, that the common weale of Christianitie, should be a most heauenly, blessed; and Angelical estate vpon earth, wherin no fraude, no deceipt, no malice, no contention, no wickednes, iniustice, or violence should raigue: and consequētly, either few or no tēporal lawes should be necessarie for punishment of the same. For that by the only lawe of religion and conscience, al would be simplicitie, al puritie, al truth and honestie, concorde, loue, and charitie, one towardes the other; euē as we read, that it fel out in the first daies

and ages of Christian religion, when this lawe of conscience was yet obserued. But now, for that the world hath abandoned commonlie in euery place, thes two principal partes of Christian dutie, (I meane the resistance of synne, and performance of good workes:) the most part of Christians are become more sensual, and dissolute in maners and life, then euer were the more ciuile part of Gentiles and Infideles; which is a most intollerable and supreme dishonour to our Saueour, that gaue his life for reducing vs to a better conuersatiō. For which cause, in al reason, right, and equitie, the punishment of such vnworthie Christians, must needs be farre greater at the later daie, then of the verse Paganes, who had not that light and assistance for their direction; according to that speech of Christ to certaine ingrateful Townes & places wherin he had preached: woe be to thee Corozain: woe be to the Bethsaida; for that, if the like thinges Mat. 11. Luc. 10. had bene done in Tyrus and Sidon (which are heathen Cities,) that haue bene done in the: they would haue repented; & therfore I tel you, that it shalbe easier for them in the daie of iudgement, then for you. Which point, would God that men now adayes would attentiuely consider. The difference of the vertuous and vvicked in this vvorld and in the next.
               
               Secondly; it may appeare by thes, and other thinges before set doune, what a maruelous different life the good and euil doe passe in this world; and consequently, how different a lot they are to receyue in

the next, from hym that rewardeth eche man (as S. Paul saieth) according to his actions, Rom. 2. 2. Tim. 4. either good or euil. For first, the vertuous Christiā, doth not only abstaine from committing sinne, (especially that which diuines cal mortal, & which eche man by Gods assistance may eschewe,) but also by cōtinual resisting & fightīg against the same, he encreaseth daily and hourely his Note that Bunny thrusteth out this vvord MLRIT not onlie here, but in al the booke besides, vvhich is almost in euerie leafe of auncient fathers vvry tinges, as also expresselie Eccles. 16. v. 15. & the value thereof, vvhich is retribution for good vvorkes, 
                        〈◊〉
                      in euerie place of scripture. Gen. 4. v. 4. Exod. 1. 20. Leu. 11. 43. Psal. 118. 112. Mat. 5. 12. 2. Tim. 4. 8. Heb. 11. 26. &c. merite, for the Crowne of heauē. But the careles man, by yeelding consent of hart to euery leude concupiscence that offereth it self; doth not only not gaine any merite at al, but heapeth vp sinne vpō sinne without ende or number. Againe, the careful man besides auoiding sinne, & the gaine which he gathereth by fighting in that combat; performeth also infinite good workes, at lest wise in hart and desire, which is accepted by God for deedes, wher further habilitie faileth. But the lose Christiā, neither in hart or deed doth any good at al; but in place therof committeth infinite euils: so that, as the one employeth his whole mīde, hart, wordes, and handes, with al the forces, and other habilities that God hath lent him, to the doing of good and resisting of euil: so the other bendeth al his powers both of bodie, minde, and fortune, to the seruice of vanities, the world, and of his owne flesh, and to the encrease of Christes enimies kingdome. And hereby, as the former encreaseth hourely in merite before God, (wherunto by his holie promisse belongeth

encrease of grace in this life, and of glorie in the life to come:) so the later cō
                  tinually, by all his thoughts, wordes, deeds, and endeuours, doth multiplie in stane frō time to time, wherunto of Gods iustice doe appertaine both vengeance and damnation, with the tormente of hel. And in this contrarie course, they passe ouer their liues, for twentie, thirtie, fortie, more or fewer yeares, and so come to die, eche man with his cōtrarie accompt: which being such as I haue said; can it be maruailous to any man liuinge, if ther be so great diuersitie in their pavementes, & euerlastinge conditions for the world to come; seing their dealinges & recōninges were so opposite and vnequal in this life present?
               Learne then (my deare brother) if The cōclusion vvith an exhortation thou be wise; by thes and like considerations, to awaken thy self while thou hast tyme. If thou finde by examination of the two forsaid partes of Christian dutie, that hyterto thou hast walked avvrye, & hast not perfourmed the life required in that vocation: thanke God for this so great a benefite, as is the reuciling of thy daunger while yet ther is tyme and place to make amendes. Many (no doubt) are this day in tormentes, and shalbe euerlastinglie, who passed ouer their liues without euer thinking of thes affairs, and if they had receyued so special fauour as thou doest now, in hauing thes matters so particulerlie layed before the; perhappes

they had escaped thos eternal calamities, wherin now they are fallen without possibilitie of redresse. Vse then Gods mercie to thy gayne (deare Christian) and not to thy greater and more intollerable damnation. Cast not awaye wilfullie that most precious Inel thy soule, which Christ hath bought so dearlie, and which he desireth so vehementelie to saue, & enriche with grace & euer lasting glorie; if thou wouldest yeeld the same into his handes, and be content to direct thy life according to his most hoiie and sweet commaundementes.
            
            
               
               OF THE ACCOMPT WHICH CHRISTIANS MVST YEELD TO GOD of the duties and offices before rehearsed. As also the Maiestie, seueritie, terrour, and other circumstances of that reconinge day, vvith tvvo seueral times appointed for that purpose. CHAPT. VII.
               AS IN euerie office and charge committed to a seruant A points of great vvisdome. in this life, it is a principall point of wisdome, to consider and beare in minde, what accōpt & reckonig shal be demaunded therof by him who placed him in that roome; as also, what nature and disposition his master is of in taking his audite; that is, whether exact or remisse, facile or rigorous, milde or sterne; and whether he haue power to punishe at his pleasure if he

finde hym faultie: euen so it behoueth a careful Christian man, in the charge of his life and dutie before mentioned and declared, verie diligently to waighe and ponder with him self, what maner of reckoning his Lord and Saueour wil require at his handes, and in what termes, either of rigour or lenitie, facilitie or seueritie, he will proceed with hym in that accompt or audite. Which thing a prudēt man may easelie conceyue by consideration of thes two points which ensue.
               First; if he waighe the manner, order, and circumstances, wherby his charge, Hovv the lavve of good life vvas published. Exod. 19. & 20.
                   that is, the lawe and rule of his conuersation was published and proclaymed by God vnto the world. Which thing is set forth at large in the booke of Exodus, wher is described with what maruelous and dreadful maiestie, feare, terrour, thunder, and sound of trumpets, the ten commandements of God (which containe the perfect forme of a vertuous Act. 7. life) were pronounced by Angels vnto the people of Israel. Which terrour and maiestie, S. Paul applieth expressie to this Heb. 12. meaning, that we should greatly tremble to violate or transgresse this law, which was deliuered with such circumstance of dread and horrour: seing that the lawes of great princes & potentates, are exacted commonly and executed vpon the offendours, with much more terrour then they were proclaimed.
               Secondly; the same in part may be conceyued;

if we consider what Iudge or Auditour VVho and vvhat maner of auditour shall receyue our accomptes. 2. Cor. 5. Luc. 12. 16. 19. 20.
                   we shal haue in this accompt. Which S. Paul declareth plainly in thes words. VVe must al be sommoned before the tribunal seate of Christ, and euerie man receyue either good or euil, according as he hath behaued him self vvbiles he liued vpon earth. Which thing Christ hym self confirmeth in diuers parables, when he promiseth to take accompt of al his talents lent vnto his seruants in this world. And in S. Mathews Ghospel he expresseth the particuler maner Mat. 16. of that accompt, saing: The Sonne of man shal come vvith his Angels in the glorie of his Father to take an accompt, and then shal he giue 
                  Mat. 16. 
                  vnto euerie man according to his vvorkes. And yet more particularly and seuerely of the same matter and daie: I saie vnto you, that euerie idle vvord that men shal speake, they shal giue accompt therof in the daie of iudgment. By Mat. 12. which speech of our Saueour we are admonished, not only that we shal giue an accompt of our doinges, but also that we shal yeeld the same to him self, who saieth in an other place, Ego sum Iudex & testis, I am both Iudge and witnes in this accompt. Iere. 29. We are instructed also, that this accompt shalbe most exact and exquisite, not omitting the least errours and offenses that haue passed in our life: That particuler reward or punishment shalbe assigned to eche mā, cōfourme to the qualitie of his accompt: And finally, that this accompt or day of reconning, (for declaration of the terrour & maiestie that shalbe

vsed therin,) is called here by Christ, a iudgment and tribunal, wherin sentence of life or death is to be pronounced.
               Of which iudgmente or accompting daye, the scripture noteth vnto vs two Tvvo daies of Iudgement. kindes. The first wherof is called a particuler iudgment, for that it is exercised vpon euerie soule immediately after her departure from the bodie, according to the wordes of holie S. Paul; It is appointed 
                  1. Particuler. Heb. 9. 2. General. 
                  for euery man once to die, and after that to haue his iudgment. The second is called a general iudgment, for that it shal be executed vpō al the world together at the last daie, when mankinde shalbe translated from this terrestrial habitation. And of this iudgement, are to be vnderstood aswel thos former wordes of Christ, touching his cōming in glorie, as also infinite other places and passages of Scripture, which doe forewarne and admonish vs of this most dreadful daie. And albeit in the first particuler iudgment, eche soule that departeth hence, receyueth an irrevocable sentence, either of life or death eternal, (as may appeare by the examples of Lazarus Iuc. 16. and of the riche glutton, wherof the one was determined to euerlasting repose, and the other to eternal torments immediatly vpon their separation from this world:) yet are ther alleaged by the holie Saintes of God, diuers most cleare, facile, and euident reasons, why his diuine wisdome, besides that first priuate and particuler daie of trial, hath ordained

also this second, which shalbe publicke, manifest, and vniuersal.
               The first wherof, is; that the bodie of  man rising from his sepulcher at that daie, Fovver reasones vvhie ther is a second iudgement. may be partaker of eternal punishment or glorie with the soule, euen as in this life, it was participant of the vertues or vices which the soule did exercise. The second reason is; for that as Christ was  contemptible in this world, and dishonoured publiquily, and put to confusion with his Saints after him in the sight of al men: so was it conuenient that once in this world, he should shewe his power and maiestie, and that in the sight of al his creatures together, but especially of his wicked enimies, who after that daie are neuer to see or beholde him more. The third is; that both wicked sinners &  blessed Saītes of God, might receyue their rewardes and final paimentes openly, in the sight and hearing of eche other; to the more hart breake and confusion of the impious, and triumphāt ioye of the vertuous, who commonly in this world, were contemned, ouerborne, and troden doune by the other. The fourth and last is; for that  men when they die, doe not commonly cary with them al the good or euil which they haue wrought; hauing left behinde them diuers thinges, which may encrease their merite or demerite after their deathes: as are their examples; their instructions gyuen to other; their temporal faculties or abilities; bookes, preachings,

exhortatiōs, & other like meanes, wherby good or euil may proceede after their departure. The reward wherof, can not so conueniently be assigned vnto thē whiles this world endureth, for that their ioyes or punishmentes in the places wher they are, may daily be augmented, by the hurt or good that may be wrought in the world, by thos meanes which they left behind them.
               So diuines doe holde, (for examples Oh that mē vvould cō
                     sider vvel this reason. sake) that the glorie of S. Paul is encreased daily in heauen, and shalbe vnto the worlds ende, by reason of them that daily doe profite by his writing and rare examplar life vpon earth: as also on the contrarie part, that the tormentes of Arrius, Sabellius, and other wicked heretiques; Heretikes. are continually augmented, by the numbers of thē who frō time to time are corrupted with their seditious and pestilent writiges. The like they holde of dissolute Loose Poetes. Poets and other loose writers, which haue left behind them lasciuious, wantō, and carnal deuises; as also of negligent parents, maisters, or teachers, who by Euil Parentes. their rechelesnes and euil examples gaue occasion to corrupte the children, cholers, or seruants committed to their gouerment and instruction. But after this general daie of iudgment once past, their shalbe no more place of meriting either good or euil; for that the world then and ther shal receyue an ende, and a final sentence be pronounced of what soeuer

hath passed from the first foundation and establishment therof.
               Of this last and general iudgment then, which containeth a confirmation or ratefying of the particuler going before, as also a final conclusion, clearing, and knitting vp of al accomptes and reckonings with mākinde, for his trafique & stewardship in this worldlie pilgrimage: The Hovv necessarie the 
                        〈◊〉
                      is of the last day of iudgment. holie Scripture of God amoni heth vs most carefully to haue continual remembrance and consideration, as of the greatest and most important busines that euer we shal deale in, and as the forceblest means to restraine vs from sinne. that possiblie may be deuised among 
                     〈◊〉
                   men in this life. For of this were vttered thos wordes especiallie, beare in minde the last end of all thinges, and thon shalt iot synne euerlastinglie. 
                  Eccles. 7. Which holie Dauid seemed to haue experienced in hym self when he wrote as foloweth. I haue obserued the vvayes of my Lord, neither haue I committed vvickedness against 
                  Psal. 57. 
                  my God; for that his iudgements vvere alvvaye in my sight, and his iustice I haue not cast out of my mynd. And (by thes meanes) I shalbe vnspotted in his presence, and vvill keepe my self from committing iniquitie. Hence it is that the blessed Prophet Moyses when he saw the people of Israel careles in committing synne, cried out in zeale; ō foolishe Nation vvithout 
                  Deut. 32. 
                  vvisdom or councel; vvould God they had vvitt and vnderstanding, and vvould forsee the end of thinges to come. As who would say; if they had so much witt as to consider this, and

what accompt they must gyue to God at the last day of their doinges; they would not offend hym as they doe. But as the scripture saith in an other place, for that this day of reconing is disterred; and for that Gods iudgment is not pronounced presentelie 
                  Eccles. S. 
                  against the vvicked: the children of men doe commit vvickednes daylie vvithout ail feare. We haue then to consider in this place, for our owne instruction and good admonishement in life, what maner of accompting daye this shalbe, whos remembrance is so much and often commended vnto vs in holie scripture. For better conceyuing 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      poīts of this chapter. wherof, we shall deuide this chapter into three principal heades or pointes.
               The first wherof, shalbe of preparatiōs or  preābles, assigned to goe before this daye.
               The second, of thinges that shall passe  and be executed at that daye.
               The third, of that which is to ensue  vpon the sentence gyuen and the iudgement ended.
               
                  CONCERNING THE FIRST, it is THE. 1. parte. OF preparations. to be noted, that for the more dread and Maiestie of this great daie, the eternal wisdome of God hath ordained and reuealed vnto vs, that before the comming therof, when it approcheth nere, thershal most wonderful and horrible preparations, signes, and tokens appeare in the world. The first wherof, shalbe the garboiles, tumultes, and commotions of all Nations, kingdomes, and people vpon earth. Which our Saueour hymself described

in thes wordes to his Apostles: VVhen you shal heare the fame or brute of vvarres and vprores; be not afraid: for that thes thinges must be, and yet presently the ende of the world shal not ensue. One nation shal rise 
                  Luc. 2 
                        •
                     
                   
                  against an other, and one kingdome shal impugne another: ther shalbe great earth-quakes, pestilence, and famine; most terrible signes and tokens from heauē. Vpon which wordes of our Saueour Greg. hom. 35. in Euā. the blessed father S. Gregorie hath this discourse. The last tribulation must haue many tribulations going before it; and by thes manifold afflictions precedēt, are declared the eternal afflictions that must ensue. And therfore Christ said, that after warres and vprores, the ende should not immediatly folowe: for that, it behoueth that many transitorie calamities should goe before; to denounce vnto vs the endles woes which are to come after.
               
               Thes warres, tumultes, and most dreadfull confusions here signified by Christ, are specified more plainly in other places of holie writ; but especially by Ezechiel, Ezech. 38 Dan. 7. Apoc. 13. See S. Ierome com. in cap. 7. Dan. Daniel, and S. Ihon in his reuelations. Wher it is prophetied, that a litle before the last general daie of iudgment, ther shalbe reuealed the man of sinne, called Antechrist; who after the conquest of many kings & kingdomes, shal make hym self the Monarch and absolute owner of the world; and shal exercise vpon good Christians more barbarous crueltie, and shed more innocent blood, within the space of three yeares and a half (which

shalbe the terme of his outragious tirannie, Dan. 12.) then al other ennimies of God haue done from the beginning. The matter is described most strangely by the Prophete Ezechiel. Who after declaration of one most bloodie bataile to be fought by Ierusalem, wherin he saieth figuratiuely, that the weapons of such as shalbe slaine, shalbe sufficient to make fire for seuen yeares after: he adioyneth in the person of God this narration. I haue spoken in my zeale, and in the fire of my wrath haue I promised, that in the last daies when Ezech. c. 38. & 39. Gog and Magog shal come into the world (by thes names are signified the armie of Antechrist,) ther shalbe a great commotion A moste vvonderful prophetie of the slaugoter to be cō
                     mitted by Antechrist. vpon the earth, and the fishe of the sea, the birdes of the aire, the beastes of the field, & al that crecpeth on the groūd, together with al humane generation which liueth vpon the face of the earth, shalbe in an vprore before my face. Hilles shalbe ouerturned; hedges shalbe broken doune; & euery strong wal shal fal to the ground. I wil cal against them the sword, from the toppes of al mountaines; and euery mans sword shalbe bent against his owne brother. My iudgment shalbe in pestilence, and blood, and vehement stormes, & in huge stones that shal fal doune. I wil raine fire and brimstone. &c. And thou sonne of mā tel vnto al the foules & birdes of the aire, and to al the rauenous beastes of the field: assemble your selues; make haste; come together, from al quarters,

to feede of the sacrifice which I shal prepare vnto you: a great sacrifice, vpon the mountaines of Israel. You shal eate the flesh of stoute champions, and shall drincke the blood of Princes. You shall feede of their fat vntil you be cloide, and you shal drincke their bloode til you be druncke. You shal be filled at this my table, and al Nations shal see this my iudgement that I haue exercised, and in what maner I haue stretched out my potent hād vpon them.
               
               Thus much hath the word of God, and muche more, (which for breuitie I doe The 2. Kynde of preparations. omit.) of the greate miseries & cōfusions that shalbe among men, some litle time before the daie of iudgment. Which time being expired; ther shal ensue other preparations in the heauens and eliments of the world, much more dreadful then thes. Which by Christ hym self and his Saintes are described in this maner. At that daie ther shalbe signes in the Sunne, in the Luc. 21. Mat. 24. Mar. 13. 2. Pet. 3. Moone, & in the starres. The sunne shalbe darkened; the moone shal giue no light; the starres shal fal from the skies; and al the powers of heauen shalbe moued. The firmament shal forsake his situation with great violence; the elements shalbe dissolued with heat; and the whole earth with al that is in it, shalbe consumed with fire. The firme land shal moue and leaue her place, and shal flie away like a doae; the pressures of Nations vpō earth shalbe inestimable, by reason of thes thinges) and

through the confusion of hideous noise from the sea and floudes; and men shal wither away and drie vp for feare and expectation of the thinges, which at that day shal happen to the vniuersal world. Thus farre out of the Ghospel.
               But S. Iohn the dearly beloued disciple of our Saueour, setteth out the same 
                     Apoc. 6. A moste vvonderful reuelation of S. Iohn. more at large, according as it was reuealed vnto him, i this maner. I heard (saieth he) a voice like the sound of a thunder, saing; come and see; and I did see. And beholde, a white horse and one that sat vpon him that had a bowe; and he went to conquere. After which folowed a blacke horse, and he that rode vpon him had a paire of balance in his hande. After him passed forth a pale horse, and he that sat vpon him was called, DEATH, and Death. Hel. 
                     HEL folowed behinde him; and he had authoritie giuen to him, to slea by sword, by death, and by the beastes of the earth. The earth did shake; the sunne grewe blacke like a sacke; the moone like blood; the Starres fel from heauē; the skie doubled it self like a folded booke; euery hil and Iland was moued from his place: the kinges of the earth, and princes, and tribunes, and the riche and stoute hid thē selues in dennes and in the rockes of hilles. Then appeared ther seuen Angels Seuen trū
                        petes & seuen blastes. with seuen trumpetes, and eche one prepared him self to blowe his blast. At the first blast, came ther haile and fire mixt  with blood. At the second blast, came 
                     
a whole mountaine of burning fire into the sea, and the third part of the sea was made blood. At the third blast fel ther a  great Starre from heauen named Absinthiū, burning like a torch, and infected the riuers and fountaines. At the fourth blast  was stricken doune the third part of the sunne, moone, & Starres; & an egle flewe into the element crying with a hideous voice; woe, woe, woe to al them that dwel vpon the earth.
               
               At the fifte blast fel an other starre from Apoc. 9. heauen, which had the keye of the pit of  hel: & he opened the pit, and ther arose a smoke as from a great fornace; and ther came forth certaine locustes like scorpions, who tormented al such as had not the marke of God in their foreheads. And at thes daies men shal seeke death and shal not finde it. And thes locustes were like VVōderful locustes. barbed horses, with Crounes on their heads. Their faces like men, their heare like women, their teeth like lions, and the noise of their winges, like the noise of many chariotes running together; their tales like scorpiōs, and their stinges were in their tailes: their king was an Angel of hel, named Abbadō; which signifieth an vtter destroier. At the sixt blast  of the trumpet were loosed foure Angels tied before; & then rushed forth an army of horsmen in number twentie hundreth times tē thousand. And I sawe the horses, and they which sat vpon them had brestplaces of fire and brimstone. The heads of

thes horses were as lions, & out of their mouthes came fire, smoke, and brimstone, wherby they slewe the third part of men which had not repented; and their strength was in their tales, which were like serpentes. Then was ther an Angel which putting one foote vpon the sea, & an other vpon the land, did sweare by him that liueth for euer and euer, that after the blast of the seuenth trumpet, ther should be no more time. And so when the seuenth  Angel had sounded, ther came great voices Apoc. 11. from heauen, saying; the kingdome of this world is made to our Lord and his Christ, and he shal raigne foreuer.
               
                  And I heard a great voice saying to the seuen Angels; goe and poure out seuen Apoc. 16. The seuen cuppes of Codesire. cuppes of Godes wrath vpon the earth; and so they did. And the first brought forth cruel woundes vpō men. The lecōd turned the sea into redde blood. The third turned the riuers and fountaines into like blood. The fourth, afflicted men with fire and made them blaspheme God. The fifte made them eate their owne tongues for sorowe. The sixt dried vp the water. And I sawe three foule spirites like frogges, issue out of the mouth of a dragon. And finally the seuenth cuppe being poured out, ther came a mightie voice from the throne of God, saying; it is dispatched. And ther folowed lightenings, and thunders, and voices, and earthquakes, such as neuer were since men dwelt vpon the earth. Thus farre this Apostle, Euange list

and prophet S. Iohn.
               And now tel me, (my good Christiā brother,) is it possible for any tongue either A inconsideratiō vpon the 
                        〈◊〉
                     . humane or Angelical, to expresse a thing more forceblie thē this is here set doune? what mortal hart can chuse but tremble, euen at the reading and remembrāce only of thes inspeakable and incomprehensible terrours? What maner of daie will that be (trowest thou,) when the heauens shal mourne, the whole earth shal shake, the sunne and moone loose their light, the Starres fal doune, the sea and floods forsake their chanels and natural courses, al the elementes be dissolued, the face of the earth ouerflowed with blood, and the vniuersal world on a flaming fire? Is it maruaile now, if the Scriptures Sopho. 1. Psal. 74. auouch that the iust men and Angels them selues shalbe afraid of that daie? And then to reason as S. Peter doth; if innocency & 1. Pet. 4. Iustice shal scarsely esteeme them selues secure in that fearful trial: what shal become of sinne and iniquitie? what shal become (I saie) of the careles and dissolute Christian, when he shal see so infinite a sea of miseries rushe vpon him? O that mē would thincke vpon this daie while they haue yet time! O that they would awake and prepare them selues by vertuous life to stand secure & confident at this woful houre.

                  VVHEN THE FORMER preparations THE. 2. parte. OF thinges that must passe in this Iudgement. shalbe fulfilled and finished, and the whole world brought to that pitiful state and plight, which I haue described;  then (saieth the Scripture) shal the signe of the fonne of man appeare in the skie; and al the tribes of the earth shal see him cōming in the cloudes of heauē, amiddest Mat. 25. Iuc. 21. al his Angels, with much power and glorie, in great authoritie and maiestie. And ther in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, he shal send his Angels with a 1. Cor. 13. trūpet, & with a great crie at midnight, & they shal gather together his elect from the foure partes of the world, euen from heauen to earth. Hitherto are the wordes of holie Scripture. Wherin is set doune the first act of this dreadful iudgment, which is the cōming of the Iudge to his throne and tribunal seate; so much the more terrible and ful of maiestie in this The comming of the Iudge. his second appearāce, by how much more contemptible he was and despised in his first being vpon earth for the worke of our redemption. So S. Iohn affirmed, that Apoc. 5. & 13. he which was siaine as a lambe, should come againe to iudge as a Lion. Of which cōming, the Prophete Malachies wordes are. Beholde our Lord shal come and vvho shalbe 
                  Mal. 3.
                  
                  able to abide the daie of his comming? And the Prophete Esaie addeth further touching the same cōming; that the verie mountaines 
                  Esa. 64. 
                  shalmelt at that daie before his face. And yet further he describeth the same in an other place thus. Beholde our Lord shal come in strength and sortitude, as a storme of haile, and as avvhyrle vvinde breaking and throvving doune vvhat soeuer standeth in his vvaie; as a rage of 
                  Esa. 28. 
                  many vvaters that ouer-stovve and rushe together &c. Wherunto the Prophet Dauid annexeth, that burning fire shal runne before his 
                  Psal. 49. 
                  face, and on euery side of him, a violent tempest.
               
               This terrible Iudge then being set, and The maner of the Iudgment. al creatures of the world conuented before him; the Scripture laieth doune vnto vs, the order of that iudgment, described by Daniel in thes wordes. I stoode (saieth Dan. 7. he) vvith attention; and I savve certaine seates placed, and the Auncient of yeares sate doune in iudgment. Thousand thousands vvere attendant to serue him; and ten hundreth thousand thousands, stood vvaiting before him. The iudgment vvas settled, and the bookes vvere opened. Thus much was reueyled to Daniel, without declaration what bookes thos were. But to S. Iohn the same were made manifest; who expoundeth the matter thus: I savve 
                  Apoc. 20. (saieth he) a great bright throne, and one that sate vpon the same, before vvhos face both heauē and earth did tremble. &c. And I savve al thos that vvere dead, both great and smal, standing before the throne. And the bookes vvere ther opened, and al thos that vvere dead had their iudgemēt, according to the thinges vvhich vvere
                  
                  vvriten in thos bookes; euery one according to his vvorkes. By which wordes we are gyué to vnderstand, that the books which at that daie shalbe opened, and wherby our cause must be discerned, shalbe the euidences of our deedes and actions in this life, recorded in the testimonie of our owne consciences, and in the infallible memorie of Gods inscrutable wisdome. Wherūto shal gyue witnes in that place against the reprobate, The store of vvitnesses agaīst as at the last day. both heauen and earth which were created for them; the Sunne and Moone with all the starres and planetes, which from the beginning of the world haue serued them; the elements and other creatures inordinately loued and abused by them; their compagnions ther present with whom they sinned; their brethern whom they afflicted; the preachers and other Saints of God whom they contemned; and aboue al other thinges, the ensigne and standard of their redemption, I meane the triumphant Crosse of Christ, which shal at that daie be erected in the sight of all the world. Al thes (I saye) with infinite other thinges, shal thē beare witnes against the wicked, and condemne them of intollerable ingratitude, in that they offended so gratious and bountiful a Lord, as by so manifold benefites allured The considence of the good, and terrour of the vvicked. them to loue and serue him.
               
                  At this daie, (saieth the Scripture,) shal the iust stand in great constancie against thos by whom they were afflicted, and oppressed in this life. And the wicked seeing

this, shalbe surprised with a horrible Sap. 5. Luc. 25. Apoc. 6. feare, and shal saie vnto the hilles, fal vpō vs and hide vs, from the face of him that fitteth vpon the throne, and from the indignatiō of the Lambe; for that the great daie of wrath is now come. O merciful Lord, how great a daie of wrath shal this be? how truly said thy Prophete in his meditation of this daie; vvho can conceyue the 
                  Psal. 89. 
                  povver of thy vvrath, or vvho is able for very scare, to recount the greatnes of thine indignatiō? This is that daie of thine, wherof thy seruant said so long before; that thy zeale and 
                  Prou. 6. 
                  surie should spare none in this daie of reuenge, nether should yeeld or be moued vvith any mans supplication; nor should admit revvards for the deliuery of any man. This is that most dreadful daie of thine, wherof thy holy Prophete admonished vs, when he said; Behold 
                  Esa. 13. 
                  the daie of our Lord shal come; a cruel daie, ful of indignation, vvrath, and surie, to bring the earth into a vvildernes, and to crushe in peeces the sinners therof. And an other Prophete of the self same daie: behold the daie of our Lord dot bcome; a daie of darknes and dimnes; a daie of 
                  Ioel. 2. 
                  cloudes and stormes; a most terrible daie, and such an one, as vvas neuer from the beginning of the vvorld, nor shalbe after in al eternitic. This is Godsday. thy daie (ô Lord) and so properly thou wilt haue it called; like as it pleaseth thy goodnes to terme the course of this present life, the daie of man. For that as in the time of this present world, thou art content Mans day. to holde thy peace and be patient, and suffer sinners to doe their wil: euen so.

at this last daie, thou wilt rise vp & pleade for thine owne glorie, and wilt make thy self knowen to the terrour of thine enimies, according as thy seruant Dauid foretold of the when he said; Cognescetur Dominus iudicia faciens. God wil be knowé, Psal. 9. when he shal come to doe iudgment.
               Good God, what a maruailous daie shal this be, when we shal see al the children A dreadfull daye. of Adam gathered together from al corners and quarters of the earth; when (as S. Iohn saieth) the sea and land shal Apoc. 20. yeeld their dead bodies, and both hel and heauenshal restore the soules which they possesse, to be vnited to thos bodies? What a wonderful meeting wil this be, (deare Christian,) how ioyful to the good, and how lamentable, doleful, and terrible to the wicked? The godlie and righteous, being to receyue the bodies wherin they liued, into the league & felowship of their eternal blisse; shal embrase them with al possible swetnes and delight, singing with the prophet; Behold, hovv good & pleasant 
                  Psal. 132. 
                  a thing it is, for brethern (or parteners) to dvvel together in unitie. But the miserable damned spirites, beholding the carcaies which were the instruments and occasiós of their sinne; & wel knowing that their inspeakable tormentes, shalbe encreated by their mutual coniunction and association: shal abhorre and vtterly derest the same, & curse the daic that euer they were acquainted together; inueighing most bitterly against all the partes and semes

therof, as against the eies, for whos curious delighte so many vanities were seught; the eares, for whos pleasure and daliance so great varietie of sweet sounds and melodie was procured; the mouth and taste, for whos contentemēt and fond satisfaction, so innumerable delicacies were deuised. And to be short, the backe and belly with other sensual partes, for contentatió of whos riotous volupteoulnes, both sea and land were sifted and turmoiled.
               This shalbe the most sorowful condition of thes infortunate soules at that daie: but this sorowe shal not auaile them. For the iudgment must passe on. And then (saieth the Scripture) shal christ separate 
                  Mat. 25. 
                  the sheepe frō the goates, & shal place his sheepe on the right hand, and the goates on the lest. O most dreadful separation: what would Alexander, Caesar, Pompeie, and other 
                     To late to repēt at the day of iudgment. such potentates of the earth giue at that daie, to haue but the lowest roome amōg them of the right hand. They (I saie) who had al the roome of this world at their pleasure, & al dignities vnder their owne commandrie, would now make more accompt of the meanest place and corner among Gods elect, then of al the pompe and brauerie of ten thousand worldes, if they were to liue againe: their cogitatiōs at this daie, being farre different from that they were vpon earth, and their iudgmēts wholy contrary. But (alas) ther is no time of alteration or amendment now. They

must stand to that which is past, and according to their former demeanours they must receyue their doome. They haue a Iudge present, whose power they can not auoide; whos wisdome they can not deceyue; whos equitie they can not bowe; whos seueritie they can not mollefie; whos indignation they can not appease; whos determination they can not alter; and from whose sentence they can not possiblie appeale.
               O my deare and louing brother; no tongue of man (beleeue me) can expresse, The treasure of a good consciēce at the day of iudgment. what a singuler treasure a good consciēce wil be at this daie, when thou shalt see al the Princes and Monarches of this world stand ther naked, trembling, & appalled; being vtterly destitute of an answere to the whole multitude of their most secret sinnes, displaied openly before their faces An vnspottel conscience (I say) at this instant, shal be a greater consolation, then al the dignities or pleasures of a thousand worldes. For wealth wil not help; the iudge wil take no giftes; our owne submission wil not be admitted; intreatie of friēdes wil not preuaile; intercession of Angels and other Saintes shal haue no place; for that their glorie shalbe at this daie (as the prophete saieth) to binde kings in fetters, & noble princes in yron manacles, to execute vpon them the iudgement 
                  Psal. 149. 
                  prescribed. Alas, what wil al thos delicate and daintie people doe at this instāt, who liue now in ease and pleasures, and can

take no paine in the seruice of God, nor abide to heare the naming of this daye? what shift (I saie) wil they finde out ī thos extremities? whether wil they tur ne thē? whos help wil they craue? They shal see al things crie vengeance round about thē; al things yeeld them cause of feare and horrour; but nothing any one sparcle of hope or consolation. Aboue them, they A most 
                        〈◊〉
                      case and condition. shal beholde their Iudge offended with their wickednes; beneath them, hel open, and the cruel fornace redie boiling to recevue them to torment. On the right hād, shalbe their sinnes accusing them; on the left hād, the Diuels redie to execute Gods eternal sentēce vpon them. Within them, shal lye their conscience gnawing; without them. al damned soules bewailing; on euery side the whole world burning.
               O merciful Iesus, which art to behold this ruful spectacle; what a passage shal Attend negligēt Christian. this be? what wil the wretched sinner doe, saie, or thincke when he shal be enuironed with thes inexplicable miseries? how wil his hart susteine thes anguishes? what waie wil he take? To goe backe is impossible; to goe foreward is intollerable; to stand ther stil is not permitted; what then shal he doe, but as thou (O Marc. 14. Lord) with thy sacred mouth hast foretold; that he shal drie and wither vp for verie feare; seeke death, and death shal flie from him; crie and beseech the hilles and Apoc. 6. & 9. mountaines to fal doune and couer him, and they refusing to doe him that releefe,

or afford him so great a comfort; he shal stand ther, as a most desperate, forlorne, and miserable catise, vntil he receyue that dreadful and irreuocable sentēce of thine; Goe yee accur sed into euerlasting fire.

Then shal the sonne of man saie to thos on his right hand. Come yee blessed of my father, and possesse the kingdome which is prepared for you, from the beginning of the world. I was hungrie and you gaue me to eate; I was a straūger and you gaue Math. 25. me harbour; I was naked and you clothed me; I was sicke and you visited me; I was in prison and you came to comfort me. And to them on his left hand he shal saie. Depart from me yee accursed into euerlasting fire, prepared for the Deuil and his Angels; for I was hungrie and you fedde me not; I was a straunger and you harboured me not; I was naked and you clothed me not; I was sicke and in prison, and you visited me not. Then shal they saie vnto him; O Lord when haue we sene the hungrie, thirstie, or a straunger, or naked, or sicke, or in prison, and did not minister vnto the? And he shal answere: I tel you, for that you haue not done thes thinges to one of thes lesser (your brethern;) you haue not done them to me. And then thes wicked shal goe into eternal punishment, and the iust into life euerlasting. Hitherto are the wordes of Christ him self.
               
                  
In which may be noted, first; that in recounting the causes of thes miserable Notes vpon Christes last sentence. mens damnation, our Saueour alleageth not lacke of beleef, or that they were not faithful; wherof the reason may be that, which him self vttereth in an other place 1. Ioa. 3. of Infidels, saying; he that beleeueth not, is alredy iudged. And S. Paul of an heretique; that he is condemned by his ovvne proper iudgmēt. 
                  Tit. 3. 2. Secondly; he obiecteth against them, not any actual enormous sinnes; wherof (per haps) maie be assigned for a reason, which S. Iohn doth insinuate and signifie, that 1. Ioa. 3. & 5. such kinde of manifest & deadlie sinners, are now euidently appertaining to the dominion of Satan. Wherfore Christ vrgeth only agaīst thes reprobates, certaine omissions of good workes and charitable deeds, commended vnto vs by the rule of Christiā perfectiō. Maske vvel this pointe, ô carles Christian. And for thes, he pronounceth against them, his most dreadful sentence of euerlasting damnation. Which sentence being once passed the Iudges mouth, and recevued in the eares of al that infinite assemblie ther present: imagine thou my soule, what an vniuersal shoute and outcrie will therupon straight ensue: the saued; reioysing and singing eternal praises in the glorie of their Saueour; the damned, bewailing, blaspheming, and cursing the daie of their natiuitie; the Angels, commending and extolling the equitie of that iudgment, against which the parties that are conuicted, shal not be able to finde any lest exceptiō. Cō
                  sider

the intollerable vpbrading of thos most insolent infernal spirites, against the miserable condemned soules that are deliuered to their praie: with how bitter scoffes and tantes, wil they traile them to their torments? with what intollerable insultation wil they execute the sentence of God against them? Consider, the eternal separation that now must be made of A vveeful separation. Fathers and children, of mothers and daughters, friendes and companions; the one to glorie the other to miserie, without any hope euer to heare or see any more the one the other. And that which shall be as great a grief as any of the rest; the sonne or daughter going to rest and ioye, shal not take pitie of their owne parents or friends that are caried to calamities: but rather shall reioice therat, for that it redoundeth to Gods glorie, for execution of his Iustice.
               O my soule, which now art here considering of thes thinges a farre of, and thē shalt be present to see them actuallie before thine eyes; what a doleful separation wil this be? what a fare-wel? what a parting? whos hart would not breake at that daie, to abide this intollerable seuering, if a hart could then breake, & therby make some ende of his paines? But so much ease The vandtie of al vvorldlie prefermētes as the List. wil not be permitted. O yee children and louers of this world; wher will al your delights, recreations, and vanities be at this daie? Al your pleasant pastimes; al

your pride and brauerie in apparel; your glistering in gold; your sweet sauours of perfumes; your honours of cappe and knee; your adulation of flatterers? your delicate faire and daintie dishes; your musike; your wanton daliances, and pleasant entertainments? Wher are all your good friēdes and merie compagniōs, accustomed to laugh and disport the time with you? Are al now gone. O vanitie of vanities; now when you haue most need of them, they are furthest of from you, and the remēbrāce therof shal doe nothing but tormēt you. O my deare brethern, how soure wil al the pleasures past of this world seeme at that howre? How doleful wil the cogitation therof be vnto vs? how friuolous a thing wil al our dignities, riches, offices, and other preferments appeare, wherin we take such excessiue delight now, and doe weary out our spirites for gaining the same? And on the contrarie side, how ioyful wil that man be at this instant, who hath attended to lead a vertuous life, in resisting of finne & doing good works, albeit it were with much paine and contempt in this world? Most happie creature shal he be, that euer he was borne; and ouer-whelmed with al ioye that euer he tooke that path in hād; and no tongue but Gods, can expresse his happines.
               Wherfore here (my louing brother) The cōclusiō of the vvbel chapter. to make an ende, and to frame no other cōclusion of al this whole declaratiō, but

only that which Christ himself doth make vnto vs (who being the chief actour that shal deale in this affaire, knoweth best of al other what counsail to giue:) let vs cósider with our selues, euē in the very bottō of our hartes, how easie a matter it is now in this life, with a litle paine and diligéce, to auoide the danger of this most dreadful daie. For which cause also it is most certaine, that the same is foretolde vs, and so often vrged in holy write to our remembrance; as in like manner, so particulerly described by our most merciful iudge & Saueour, to the ende we should by thes seuere & earnest admonishmits, be stirred vp to prepare our selues for it. So Christ himself doth most euidentlie declare, whē after al his former threatniges he cōcludeth in thes most sweete wordes of exhortation. Looke about your selues; Marc. 13. watch and praie; for you knowe not whé the time shal be. But as I saie to you, so I saie to al men: be watchful. And yet further Math. 24. in an other place he adioineth. Attēd vnto your selues, that your hartes be not ouercome with eating, and drincking, & with the cares of this life, and so that daio ouertake you vpon the suddaine. &c. Be you therfore watchful, and alwayes praye, that you may be worthie to escape althes thinges which are to come, and to stand confidently before the sonne of mā at that daye.
               
               Thes are the words and forewarnings of thy Iudge and Saueour, vnto thee my

soule. And what more friendly and fatherly The svveet and fatherlie dealing of Christ vvith vs. 2. Pet. 3. exhortation couldest thou desire; Canst thou plead ignorance in this affaire hereafter? If thou thincke so; heare yet a further admonishment of his chief Apostle. The daie of our Lord (saieth he) shal come as a theef (when men thincke not of it,) In which the heauens and elemēts shalbe dissolued; and al the earth with her inhabitants shalbe consumed with fire. Which being so; what maner of men ought we to be in holie conuersation and pietie, expecting and going on to meet with this daie of our Lord &c.? In which wordes of S. Peter, is diligently to be noted, that this meeting with the daie of Iudgment, wherunto he exhorteth vs, is Hovv vve may goe & meete vvith the day of the iudgement. nothing els, but the due examination of our present perilous estate, and the speedie amendment of our life, to the workes of pietie and holy conuersation: which in deed, is that onlie soueraine remedie, wherof the wise man forwarneth vs, when he saieth; Prouide a medecine before the 
                  Eccle. 18. 
                  maladie, and examine thy self before iudgment, and so shalt thou finde fauour in the sight of God. Wherunto S. Paul wel agreeth saying; If 
                  I. Cor. II. 
                  vve vvould iudge our selues, vve should not be iudged. But for that no man entreth into this due iudgemét of himself, his life, state, and actions: here of it cōmeth, that so few dot preuent this dangerous daie; so few prepare themselues; so fewe doe accept of the good counsaile of Christ; so feweare watchful; and so infinite doe fal a sleepe

in the ignorance of their owne peril, to their remediles destruction and vnauoidable damnation. Our blessed Lord giue vs his holie grace to looke better about vs.
            
            
               OF THE NATVRE OF SINNE, AND OF THE VNVVORTHINES OF HIM that committeth the same. For iustifyinge the seueritie of gods iudgement setdoune and declared in the chapter going before. CHAPT. VIII.
               TO THE ende that no man may iustly complaine of the seuere accoumpte, whiche God is to take of vs at the last daye, or of the rigour of his iudgemēt, set doune in the chapter before: it shal not be amisse to cōsider in this place, the cause why God doth shew such seueritie against sinne and sinners; as both by that which hath bene saide may appeare

that he doth, as also by the whole Godes hatred against sinners. course of holy scripture, where in euerie place almost, he denounceth his extreme hatred, wrath, and indignatiō against the same: as where it is sayed of hym, that he 
                  Psal. 5. 
                  hateth al those that vvorke īiquitie. And againe: that both the vvicked mā and his vvickednes, are 
                  Sap. 14. Prou. 15. Iob. 11. Esa. 1. Psal. 13. Psal. 49. Eccle. 15. 
                  hateful in his sight. And finallie, that the whole life of sinners, their thoughts, wordes, yea and their good actions also, are abominations vnto him, whiles they liue i sinne. And that (which yet is more) he can not abide nor permit the sinner to praise him, or to name his testament with his mouth, as the Holie Ghost testifieth. and therfore no meruaile if he shew such seueritie against him at the last daye, whom he so extremelie hateth & abhorreth in this life.
               Of which great hatred there might be manie reasons alleaged; as the vndutiful transgressiō & cōtēpt of godes cōmandementes; the great ingratitude of a sinner in respect of his diuine benefites, and such other: which might iustifie sufficientlie his indignation and seuere hatred against him. But there is one reason aboue al the rest, which openeth the verie fountaine The reason vvhy God so hateth a sinner. and origine of the matter; and this is, the intollerable iniurie donne vnto almightie God, in euerie mortall sinne that we commit: which in deede is so opprobrious & abhominable an iniurie; as no meane worldly potentate could beare the same at his subiectes handes, and much lesse God

him self (being the omnipotent Lord of al glorie and Maiestie,) may in reason tollerate an outrage so often iterated against him, as is sinne daily committed by the wicked.
               For the better vnderstanding of which iniurie, we are to consider, that euerie time we cōmit a mortal sinne, there doth passe thorough our hart & minde (though we marke it not,) a certaine practik discourse of our vnderstandinge, (as there doth also in euerie other electiō,) whereby we lay before vs on the one side, the profit of that sinne which we are tempted to commit; that is to saie, the pleasure which allureth vs therunto: and on thother parte, the offence of God, which is, the leesinge of his grace and friēdshippe by that sinne, yf we yeeld vnto it. And thus hauinge as it were the balances there before vs, and setting God in one end therof, and in the The iniurie done to God by sinne. other the aforesaide pleasure; we stand in the middest deliberatinge & examininge the waight of both partes; and finallie doe make choise of the pleasure, and reiect almightie God: that is; we chuse rather to loose the fauour of God, together with his grace, and whatsoeuer he is worth besides, then to lacke that pleasure and delectation of sinne. Now then, what can be more opprobrious and horrible then this? what cā be more reprochful to God, then to prefer a most vile pleasure before his infinite Maiestie? is not this farre more intollerable, then the disgrace offred to

him by the Iewes, when they made choise of Barrabas the murderer, and reiected Mat. 17. Marc. 15. Iesus their Saueour? surely, how hamous soeuer that sinne of the Iewes were, yet in two poites this doth seeme to exceede the same. First, in that the Iewes knew not whome they refused in their choise, as we doe. Secondly, in that they refused Iesus but once, wheras we refuse him both daily and hourly, whensoeuer in our hartes we giue consent vnto mortal sinne.
               And is it meruaile then, that God dealeth so seuerely & sharplye with sinners in the worlde to come, whoe doe vse hym so opprobriouslie and contemptuouslie in this life? Vndoubtedly the malice of a sinner is greate towardes God, and he doth The malice of a sinner tovvardes God. not onlie dishonour hym by contempt of his commaundementes, and by preferring most vyle creatures before hym: but also beareth a secrete hatred & grudge against his maiestie, and woulde (if it lay in his power) offer his endeuour to pull hym out of his seate, or (at the least wise) 
                     〈◊〉
                   in his hart, there were no God at all to punish sinne after this present lyfe. Let euerie sinner examine the botome of his conscience in this point, whether he could not be content, there were no immortalitie of the sowle, no reckoninge after this life, no iudge, no punishment, no hell; and consequentlye no God at al; to the ende he might the more securelie enioye his pleasures?
               And because God (who searcheth the

harte and reynes) seethe well this most Sap. 1. Rom. 8. Psal. 7. vndutiful & trayterous affectiō towardes hym, lurking within the bowels of sinful men, (how smoth so euer their wordes may be:) here of it commeth, that in the whole course of holie Scripture, he denounceth them for his enimies, and professeth open warre and hostilitie against them. And then suppose yoa, what a pitiful Rom. 5. Lacob 4. 1. Ioh. 3. case thes vnfortunate men are in, (being but seely wormes and wretches of the earth,) whē they haue so puissant an enimie to fight against them, as doth make the verie heauens to tremble at his looke. And yet that the case is so; heare what himself sayeth, what he threatneth, what he thundreth out against them. After he had by the mouth of Esaye the Prophet re peated many sinnes abhominable in his sight, as the taking of bribes, oppressing Sinners enemies to God and God to them. of poore people, and the like: He defieth the doers therof, as his open enymies, saying: This saieth the Lord God of hostes, the stronge Lord of Israel: Beholde I vvi. be reuenged vpon mine enimies, and vvill comfort my self in their destruction. And the Prophet Dauid, as he was a man in most high fauour with God, and made preuie to his secretes aboue many other: so he (more than any other,) doth expresse this seuere meaning of God, & his infinite displeasure against sinners; calling them his enimies, vessels of his wrath, and ordayned to eternal ruine and destruction; and complaineth that the world will not beleeue this

point. An vnvvise man (saieth he) vvill not 
                  Psal. 90. 
                  learne this, neither vvill the foole vnderstand it. And what is this ô holy Prophet? it foloweth; That siners and vvorkers of iniquitie (after they haue appeared i the vvorld) doe perishe euerlastingly. And what is the reason of this? he answereth immediatly: because toy enimies (o Lord,) thy enimies (I saie) o Lord, shal perishe, & til they that vvoreke iniquitie shalbe cosumed. Wherby we see, that all sinners be enimies to God, and God to them, as also vpō what grounde and reason.
               But yet (for the further iustifyinge of godes seueritie,) let vs consider in what measure his hatred is towardes sinne; how great; how far it proceedeth; withi what boundes it is comprehended; or whether it haue any limites or bondes at all, or rather be infinite and without limitation. And to vtter the matter as in trueth it stā
                  deth; Godshatred is infinite against sinne and vvhie. if all the tongues in the world were made one tongue, and all the vnderstandinges of all creatures (I meane of Angels and men) were made one vnderstandinge: yet, could nether this tongue expresse, nor this vnderstanding conceiue, the great hatred of gods harte towards euery mortall sinne which we commit. And the reason hereof standeth in two pointes. First, for that God by how much more he is better than we are: by so much more he loueth goodnes and hateth synne, than we doe. And for that he is infinitelie good: therfore his loue to goodnes is infinite, and his hatred to euil, immesurable;

and consequentlie, his rewardes to them both, are infinite; the one in hell, with euerlasting miserie; thother in heauen, by eternal felicitie.
               Secondlie; we see by experience, that how much more great and worthie the VVhy euery sinne deserueth infinite punishment. person is, against whom an offence is cō
                  mitted; so much greater is alwayes the offence: as for example, the self same blow or iniurie offred to a bond-slaue and to a prince, differeth greatlie in qualitie and in the nature of offence; and consequentlie, deserueth farre different hatred and punishment. And for that euerie mortal sinne which we commit, is donne directlie against the person of God hym self, as hath bene declared before, whose dignitie is infinite: therfore the offence or guilt of euery such sinne is infinite, and consequently, deserueth infinite hatred and infinite punishment at gods handes. Hereof foloweth the reason of diuers thinges both sayed and donne by God in the scriptures, and taught by diuines towching the punishments of sinne, which seeme verie straunge vnto the wisedome of the Rom. 8. 1. Cor. 1. world, and in deede to them scarce credible. As first of al; the most dreadful punishment of eternal and irreuocable damnation of so manie thowsandes, or rather millions of Angels, that were created to The punishmēt of Angels. glorie with almost infinite perfection, & that for one onlie sinne, but once committed, and that onlye in thought, as diuines are of opinion.
               
                  
Secondlie, the rigourous punishment Of Adam and Eu of our first parents Adam and Eue, and al their posteritie, for the eatinge of a seely aple; for which fault, besides the chastisinge of the offenders themselues, and al the creatures of the earth for the same, and al their children and ofspring after them, both before our redemption and after; (for albeit we are deliuered frō the guilte of that sinne, yet tēporal punishmētes doe remaine vpon vs for the same, as hunger, thirst, cold, sicknes, death, and a thousand other miseries:) besides also the infinite soules, damned for the same before the comming of Christ, by the space offower thousand yeres; as also since, as wel, infidels, which are not baptized, as others: besides al this I say, (which in mās reason maye seeme seuere enough:) gods wrath and iustice could not be sufficiētly satisfied, except his owne onlie sonne had come downe into the worlde, & takē our flesh vpon him, and by his paines & death made satisfaction for the same. And when The value of Christes satisfactiō. he was now come into the world, & had in our flesh subiected him self vnto his fathers iustice; albeit the loue his father bare vnto him, were infinite, and euery litle paine that he endured for vs, or at leastwise euery droppe of bloode which he shed for our cause, had ben sufficient for the whole satisfactiō; (for that his fleshe being vnited to his godhead, made euerie such satisfactorie action of his, of infinite value and merite, and consequently of infinite

satisfaction, correspondent to the infinitie of our first parents sinne:) yet to the ende that God might shew the greatnes Esa. 53. of his hatred and iustice against the said sinne and al other; he neuer ceased to adde affliction to affliction, and to heape tormentes vpō the bodie and flesh of this his most deare and blessed sonne, (for by Esaye, he sayeth, that him self was the doer therof;) vntil he had brought him vnto that most rueful plight, that his flesh being all mangled and most lamentably torne in peeces, retained no one droppe of blood within it. He spared him not (I saye) euen then, when he beheld him sorowful vnto death, and bathed in that agonie of blood and water, when he hard him vtter thos most dolorous and compassionable speeches, O my father, if it be possible, let this cuppe passe from me. And after that Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. againe, muche more pitifully vpon the Crosse: O my God, my God, vvhy hast thou forsaken me? Notwithstanding al which cries and lamentatiōs, his most merciful father, (louing him as he did,) would not deliuer him; but for satisfying of his Iustice, laied vpon him stripe vpon stripe, paine vpon paine, torment after torment, vntil he had Mat. 27. Psal. 21. Esa. 53. rendred vp his life & soule into his sayed fathers handes: which is a wounderful & dreadful documēt of godes hatred against sinne.
               I might here mention the sinne of Esau The sinne of Esan. in selling his inheritance for a litle meate: of which S. Paule sayeth, he founde no place
                  
                  of repentance after, though he sought the same 
                  Gen. 25. & 27. Heb. 12. of Saul. 1. Reg. 15 & 16. 1. Reg. 9. & 15. & 16. 
                  vvith teares. Also the sinne of Saule, whos sinne beinge but one, and that onlie of omissiō, in not killinge Agag the kinge of Amalech and his cattel, as he was willed: was notwithstanding vtterlie cast of by God for the same, (though he were his annointed and chosen seruāt before;) & could neuer get remission therof, albeit both he and Samuel, Gods holie prophet, did greatly lament and bewaile, and made intercession in that behalfe.
               In like maner might I alleage the exā
                  ple of kinge Dauid, whose two sinnes 2. Reg. 12 Psal. 5. 34. 68. 108. 101. 29. 2 Reg. 12 albeit vpon his hartie repentance God forgaue; yet notwithstanding the said repentance and sorrow, and all the All thes bedilie punishmentes Bun. leaueth 
                        〈◊〉
                     , yet vvith stāding they be set doune in scripture. weepinge, fastinge, watchinge, lyinge on the grounde, wearinge of sackloth, and other bodilie chasticementes, which this holie prophet recordeth that him self did put in vre: God punished him besides, with maruelous seueritie; as by the death of his dearlie beloued childe, & by manie other continual afflictions, and temporal punishementes, during the rase of his whole life. And al this to shew his hatred against sinne, & thereby to terrifie vs from committinge the same.
               Of this also doe proceede, al those harde Hard speeches in scripture against sinners. and seuere speeches of holie write touching sinners, which comming from the mouth of the Holie Ghost, (and therfore no doubt both true and certaine,) may iustlie yeeld greate cause of feare, to al

such as liue in sinful state; As for example, Eccle. 40. where it is saied: death, bloode, contentiō, edge of svvorde, oppression, hunger, contrition, 
                  Psal. 10. 
                  and vvhippes; all thes thinges are created for vvicked sinners. And againe: God shal raine Psal. 9. snares of fyre vppon sinners; brimstone vvith tē
                     pestuous vvindes, shalbe the portion of their cup. And yet further ī manie other places, thes most dreadful speeches and comminations Psal. 3. Psal. 9. Psal. 36. Psal. 144. are to be founde: God wilbe knowen at the day of iudgement vpon the sinner, who shalbe taken in the workes of his owne handes: manie whippes belong vnto a sinner; let sinners be turned into hell; God shal scatter al sinners, and shal dash ther teeth out of their mouthes; God shal scoffe at a sinner when he seeth his daye of destructiō cōmeth on; the sworde of sinners shall turne into their owne Psal. 57. Psal. 36. Psā. 103. hartes: The armes of sinners shalbe crushed and broken, and they shal wither and dry vp like haye from the face of the earth: desire not the glorie and riches of a sinner, Psal. 140. for thou doest not know the suddaine subuersion which shall come vpon hym; Eccle. 2. Psal. 72. Esa. 13. for God hath gyuē him riches, to deceyue him therwith; beholde the daye of our Lord shal come; a cruel daye, and ful of indignation, wrath, and furie, to make desolate the earth, and to crush in peeces her sinners within her. Thē shal the iust man reioice seinge this reuenge, and shal wash Psal. 7. his handes in the blood of sinners.  Thes loe, my deare brother, and innumerable other such sentēces of scripture, pronounced

by the holie spirit of God against sinners, maye instruct vs of their pitifull estate, & of the vnspeakable hatred of his diuine Maiestie against thē, so lōg as they persist in their sinful life and cōuersation.
               Of all which considerations, the self same holie scriptures, doe gather certaine conclusions greatelie to be obserued. wherof the first and more general is; that sinne bringeth al people to miserie; secondlie Prou. 14. Psal. 10. and more particulerlie: that he vvhich loueth sinne, bateth his ovvn soule; Or as the Angel Raphael vttereth the same ī otherwordes; Tob. 12. 
                  they vvhich commit sinne, are enimies to their ovvne soules. Wherfore they laye downe to al men, this general, seuere, & most necessarie commaundement, vpon al the paines before recited. Flee from sinne, as from the face of a snake. And againe: Bevvare thou neuer 
                  Eccle. 21. Tob. 4. 
                  consent to sinne. For how soeuer the worlde may make litle accounte of this matter, by whome (as the scripture noteth) the sinner is praised in his lustes, and the vvicked man 
                  Psal. 9. 
                  is blessed for his vvickednes: yet most certaine it is (for that the spirite of God auoucheth it,) that he vvhich committeth sinne, is of the deuil, 
                  1. Ioh. 3. and therfore is to receyue his portion amonge deuils and damned spirites, at the latter daye.
               And is not al this sufficient (most deare brother) to breed in vs a detestation of The obstinacie of sinners. sinne, with feare and horrour to commit the same? Is not this of force and strength sufficient, to shake the hartes of them that wallowe perpetually in the pudle of sinne?

and doe commit the same daylie without scruple, remorse, or consideration? what desperate obstinacie & obduration is this? Surely we find now by experiēce, that the holye Ghost prophesied ful truelie of thes men, when he sayed; sinners alienated from God, are possessed vvith a surit like a serpent, and like a deafe cocatrise vvhich stoppeth her eares, against the enchaunter. This surie (I saie) is the furie or madnesse of Psal. 17. willfull synners, which stoppe their eares like serpentes, to all the holy enchauntmentes that God can vse vnto them, for their conuersiō; that is, to all his internal motions and good inspirations; to all remorse of their owne consciences; to all threatninges of holie scriptures: to al admonishmentes of gods seruauntes; to al examples of vertuous liuers; to al the punishementes that light vpon the wicked; and to all the other meanes which God can vse for their saluation.
               Good Lorde, what man would commit a mortal sinne, for the gayning of ten The losses that come by euerie mortall sinne. thowsande worldes, if he considered the infinite dōmages, hurtes, inconueniences, & mileries, which doe ensue by cōmitting of the same? For first, who soeuer sinneth  mortallie, leeseth the grace of God inherent in his soule, which is the greatest gift that can be gyuen to man in this life; & cōsequētlie, he leeseth al those thinges which did accompanie that grace; as are Esa. 11. & Icro. Ibid. the vertues infused, and the seuen giftes of the Holy Ghost, wherby the sowie was

beautified in the sight of her spouse, and armed against al assaultes of her ghostlie enimies. Secondlie, he leeseth the fauour  of God, and consequentlie, his fatherly protection, care, and prouidēce ouer him; & enforceth hym to be his professed enimie. Which, how great a losse it is, we may esteeme in part, by the state of a worldly princes seruant and fauorite, who being in highe grace and credit with his Soueraine, should by some one great offence lose al his fauour at one instant, and incurre his mortal hatred and displeasure.
               Thirdly, he leeseth all his inheritance,  clayme, and title to the kingdome of heauē, Rom. 6. which is due onlie by grace, as S. Paul wel noteth; and consequentlie, he depriueth hym self of all dignities and commodities depending therupon in this life; as are the condition and high priueledge of being the sonne of God; the communion of Sainctes; the protection of holie Angels, and the like. Fourthlie, he looseth  the quiet, ioye, and tranquillitie of a good conscience, and all the fauours, cherishmentes, consolations, and other comfortes, wherwith the holie Ghost is wont to visite the mides of the Iust. Fifthly, he looseth  the merit and rewarde of his good workes done al his life before, and whatsoeuer he doth, or shal doe, while he continueth in that miserable and sinful state. Sixtlie, he maketh hym self guiltie of  eternall punishment, and enrolleth his name in the booke of perdition, and consequentlie,

byndeth hym self to althose miseries and inconueniences, wherunto the reprobate are subiect; that is to saie, to be an inheritour of hel and damnation; to be in the power of the deuill and his Angels; to be thral to synne and euerie temptation Esa. 13. therof; and his sowle (which was before the temple of the holy ghost, the habitation of the blessed Trinitie, the spouse of God, & place of repose for holy Angels to visit:) now to be a dēne of dragons, The leesing of Christ by sinne. a nest of scorpions, a dongeō of deuilles, a sincke & swine-stie of al filth and abhomination, and hym self a companion of the miserable damned spirites.
               Lastlye, he abandoneth Christ, and renounceth al the interest and portion he had with hym, treading hym vnder his feete, defiling his most pretious blood, & Crucifying hym againe (as S. Paul auoucheth,) in that he sinneth agaist him, who died for sinne, and maketh hym self a persecutour of his redeemer. For which cause Heb. 10. Heb. 6. Rom. 6. the same Apostle pronounceth a most hard and heauie sentence against such men, in thes wordes: If vve synne vvillfullye novv 
                  Heb. 10. Rom. 26. 
                  after vve haue receyued knovvledge of the trueth: there remaineth no more sacrifice for synnes, but rather a certaine terrible expectation of iudgement, and rage of fyre, vvhich shall consume the aduersaries. To which S. Peter agreeth, 2. Pet. 2. when he saieth: It had bene better not to haue knovvē the vvay of iustice, thē after such knovvledge, to slyde backe agayne from the holye commaundement vvhich vvas gyuen.
               
               
                  
This being so; let sinful worldlinges goe now and solace them selues in their Fonde excuses of sume. vanities and watōnes, as much as they lift. Let them excuse and pleasantlye defend the same, by saing; pryde is but a pointe of gentrye; glouttonie, good fellowship; anger and reuenge, but an effect of courage; lecherye and wantonnes, a trycke of yowth: they shall one daye finde, that these excuses will not be receyued: but rather that al such pleasant deuises & toies, wilbe turned into teares; al such fond concepts into doleful lamentations. They shall proue to their great cost, that God will not be iested with, but that he is the Gal. 6. same God still, and will aske as seuere accounte of them, as he hath done of other before; although now it pleasenot them to keepe any accounte at al of their life and actions; but rather to turne all to disporte and pleasure, persuading them selues, that how soeuer God hath delt before with other; yet vnto thē he wil pardon al. But this is a mere madnes, and a voluntarie deluding of our selues; for that God hym self by his sacred word, instructeth vs to reason after an other sashion. Which I wil here breefly touch, exhorting euery prudent Christian seriously to examine the same.
               At what time the great Apostle of the Gentiles S. Paul; tooke vpō him to make a Rom. 11. comparison betweene the grieuous sinnes of his nation the Iewes (for which they were reiected and made reprobate

by God,) and thos which Christians doe commit after their Redemption; he framed this collection concerning Gods iustice due vnto them both, saing: If God spared not the naturall boughes; take heede least he spare not thee. And there-vpon he inferreth Rom. 11. this admonition, noli altum sapere, sed time, Be not high minded, but feare. Againe, he reasoneth thus vpon the olde and the new lawe. He that brake the lawe of Moyses, being conuicted by two or three witnesses, Heb. 10. died for the same without commiseration or mercye: & how much more greeuous punishment then doth he deserue, who breaking the law of Christ by wilfull sinne, treadeth the Sonne of God vnder his feete, polluteth the bloode of the new testament, and reprocheth the holie Ghost? In like maner reasoneth S. Peter and S. Iude towching the sinne of Angels and ours. If God spared not the Angels 2. Pet. 2. Ep. Iud. when they sinned, but did thrust them downe to hell, there to be tormented, and to be reserued vnto iudgement with eternall chaines vnder darckenes: how much lesse will he spare vs? And agayne; if the Angels which passe vs in power and 2. Pet. 2. strength, be not able to beare gods horrible iudgement against them: what shall we doe?And yet further in an other place, the same Apostle reasoneth thus:  if the iust man shal hardlie be saued, where shal the wickedman and sinner appeare?
               
               By al which examples, we are instructed, 1. Pet. 4. how to reason maturely & sincerely

in our owne cause. As for example, eche A good maner of reasoninge. man may truly saie thus vnto hym self: if God haue punished so seuerelie one sinne in the Angels, in Adam, and in others before  recited: what shall I looke for, which haue committed so manie sinnes against hym? If God haue damned so manie  soules for lesser sinnes then mine, are: what will he do to me for mine that are farre greater? If God haue borne longer  with me, then he hath done with many other whom he hath cut of, without geuing them of repentance: what reason is there, that he should beare longer with me? If Dauill and others after their  synnes forgyuen, tooke such paines in afflicting them selues, for satisfaction of the temporal punishement in this life: what punishemēt remaineth for me, either here or in the wold to come, for satisfaction of so manie sinnes cōmitted? If it be true  that our Sauvour saith, that the waye is Math. 7. Luc. 13. harde, and the gate narrow wherby men goe into heauen, and that they shal aunswere for euerie ydle worde before they Mat. 12. enter therein: what shal become of me that doe liue so easie a life, and doe keepe no accounte at al of my deedes, and much lesse of my wordes? If good men in olde time did take such paines for their saluation, and yet (as S. Peter saieth) the verie iust were scarcely saued: what a state am I in, which take no paine at al, but doe liue in all kinde of pleasure and worldly contentations?
               
                  
Thes argumētes, consequentes, and conclusions, are more true (good Christian,) and would proue more profitable vnto vs, if we would excercise our selues therin, and therby enter into some cogitation of our owne daungers, and into iust feare of Gods seuere iudgementes, without flatteringe or deceyuinge our selues. For wāt wherof either onlie or principallie, the most parte of enormous sinnes from time to time are committed, according as holy Dauid most euidentlie declareth, when Tvvo prin cipal causes of deceauīg our selues. hauing shewed and detested the multitude of sinnes which the world committeth; he reduceth (al as it were,) vnto two prin cipal causes. Wherof the first is, that men deceyue them selues and others, by vaine flatterie, in deminishing their sinnes; of whom he saith: they are taken in their ovvne deuises, for that they praise the vvicked man in the lustes & desires of his ovvne minde. The second Psal. 9. is, for that this deceipt and flatterie is referred commōlie by the vitious man, to the driuing of Gods iudgementes out of his memorie, to the end he may sinne with lesse feare and scruple. For so saith the prophet expresselie; The sinner hath exasperated God against him, (in that he hath said,) god in the multitude of his vvrath, vvil not require an accounte of my doinges. But what effect ensueth of this? heare the wordes immediatelie folowing: he hath not God before his eyes; his vvayes are filthie from time to time. And what is the cause of al this? for that thy iudgementes (o Lord) are remoued from his sight:
                  
that is; for that he wil not see, he wil not behold, he wil not heare, he wil not consider or beare in mind thy iudgementes, ô Lord, but wil needes flatter, delude, and deceyue hym self. Herof it commeth, that he neuer maketh an end of his filthie life & wicked wayes, but exasperateth thie iustice o Lord, against him, vntil it be ouer late to repent or amende. Thus said this holie Sainte, of wicked sinners: but what of him self? heare his wordes (deare brother) and imprint them in thie memorie. I haue kept the vvayes of my Lord, (saith he,) & haue not donne vvickedlie in the sight of 
                  Psal 17. 
                  my God, for that al his iudgements are before my eyes, and I haue not tast his iustices from me. Beholde the vertuous life of king Dauid, & The remē
                     brance of Gods iudgemētes, cause of vertue. beholde the cause therof. For that Gods iudgemētes were continuallie before his eyes; therfore was his life pure, and voide of wickednes; or as in other wordes at an other time he expresseth; I vvil cōfesse vnto 
                  Psal. 118. 
                  the (o Lord) in the direction (or puritie) of my hart, for that I haue learned the iudgementes of thie iustice. And againe in the same place: I haue chosen to vvalke the vvay of truth, for that I doe not forget o Lord thy iudgementes: that is, (as a litle after he expoundeth the same,) for that I doe feare and trēble at thy iudgementes. O most excellent effecte of the feare of Gods iudgementes. No maruaile though it be called the beginning of al wisdom, and the verie dore and entrance to eternal saluation: no maruaile if the same holie prophet in the verie same psalme doe pray so

hartilie; strike through my flesh, vvith thy feare, ò Lord.
               
               S. Paule after he had shewed to the Corinthians, Hovv the Apostles did persuad vs to feare. 2. Cor. 5. that we must al be presented before the tribunal of Christ, euerie man to receyue according to his merites; he maketh this conclusiō. VVe knovving therfore thes thinges (deare bretheren) doe persuade the feare of our Lord vnto al men. And S. Peter hauing made a longe declaration of the Maiestie of God, and of Christ now raining in heauen; concludeth thus: yf then you cal him father, vvhich doth iudge euerie man according 
                  1. Pet. 1. 
                  to his vvorkes, vvithout exceptiō of persons: doe you liue in feare, during the time of this your habitation vpon earth. A necessarie lesson (no doubt) for al men, but especiallie for such, who by reason of their sinful life, doe remaine in displeasure and hatred of almightie God, and hourelie doe stand obnoxious (as I haue shewed) to the seueritie of his most dreadful iudgementes. wherinto if once they fal; (especiallie by departure from this life:) the matter remaineth remediles for all eternitie insuinge, as God him self hath forwarned vs. Which thing being so: what man of wisdome would not feare? what Christiā that is careful of his owne estate, would eate or drinke, or take his repose with quiet, vntil by hartie repentāce, and other such means of holie Sacramentes, as God hath left for this purpose in his Church, he had discharged his conscience of the burden of sinne, and made an attonement

betwene his soule & Saueour? O merciful Lord, how dangerous is his estate, vntil he haue donne it? how manie wayes may he fal into thos heauie handes of his eternal iudge, wherof S. Paul conceyued horrour in onlie thinking? One litle stone, falling from the house toppe as he passeth by; one slippe of his horse, as he rideth; one assault of an enimie, whē he thinketh not vpon him; one poore ague by a surfect or other distēperature; one suddaine mischance of a milliō that may fal vnto him; is able to bereaue him of this life, & to cast him into thos termes of euerlasting calamitie, wherehence the whole world shal not be able to deliuer him. And is not this then a matter to be feared? is not this a case to be preuented? O how trulie saith the holie scripture; blessed is the man vvhich alvvaies is fearful, and he that hath a hard hart, 
                  Pro. 28. 
                  shal fal into perdition.
               
               Our Lord God of his mercie, gyue vs his holie grace, to feare him as we should, and to make such accounte of his iudgementes and iustice, as by threatning the same, he would haue vs to doe, for th' auoiding of sinne. And thē shal not we delaye the time, but shal resolue our selues to serue him, whiles he is content to accept of our seruice, and to pardon vs al our offences, if we would once firmelie make this resolution from our hart.
            
            
               
               AN OTHER CONSIDERATION FOR THE FVRTHER IVSTIFYING OF Gods iudgementes and manifestation of our grieuous offence. Taken from the inestimable Maiestie of him vvhom vve offende, and of the innumerable benifites vvhich he hath bestovved vpon vs. CHAPT. IX.
               ALBEIT the most parte of Christians through their wicked life, arriue not to that state when holy Dauid was, when he sayed to God; thy iudgementes 
                  Psal. 118. 
                  ô Lord, are pleasant vnto me; (as in deed they are to all those that lyue vertuouslie and haue the testimonie of a good conscience:) yet at leastwise, that we maye be inforced to confesse with the same Prophet; that, the iudgementes of our Lord are true, 
                  Psal. 18. 
                  and iustified in them selues: I haue thought expedient,

to adde a reason or two in this chapter, wherby it maye appeare, how great our offence is, in sinnīg against God as we doe; and how righteous his iudgemētes & iustice are agaist vs, for the same.
               
                  AND FIRST OF AL IS to be considered, the maiestie of hym, against THE. 1. part. MAIESTIE of God. whom we sinne. For most certaine it is, (as I haue noted before,) that euerie offence is so much the greater and more grieuous, by how much greater and more noble the person is, against whom it is done, and the partie offending, more base and vile. And in this respect, almightie God (to terrifie vs from offending hym,) nameth hym self oftentimes with certaine great and dreadful titles of maiestie; as to Abraham: I am an omnipotēt Lord. And Gen. 17. Esa. 66. agayne to Esay; heauen is my seate, & the earth is my footestole. And at an other time he cō
                  maunded Moyses to beare to the people in his name, this ambassage: harden not your neckes any longer, for that your Lord and God, is 
                  Den. 10. 
                  the God of godes, and the Lord of lordes, a greate God, both potent and terrible, vvhich accepteth nether person nor bribes.
               
               First then I saye, consider (gentle Christian) of what an infinite maiestie he is, whom thow a poore worme of the earth, hast so often and so contemptuously offended ī this lyfe. We see in this world, that no man dareth to offende openly, or say one worde against the maiestie of a temporal Prince, within his owne dominions: But what is the maiestie of all

earthly princes put together, if it be compared to the thowsand parte of Gods incomparable & inestimable maiestie, who with one worde made both heauen and earth, and all the creatures therin, and Psal. 148. with halfe a worde could annihilate and destroie the same againe. Whom all the creatures which he made, both Angels, heauens, Starres, and elementes, doe serue at a becke, and dare not once offend; & vnder vvhom (as holy Iob saieth) doe croucb and trēble, euē they that beare vp & susteine the vvorld. 
                  Onlie a sinner is he, which emboldeneth Iob. 9. hym self against this maiestie, and feareth not to offēd the same, whom (See Cvr l. Catech. 3. Chrv. hom. 26. in Gen. Clem lib. 8. cap. 16. as the holye Catholique Church doth professe day lie, in her preface to the blessed sacrifice,) the Angels do praise, the dominations doe adore, the powers do tremble, and the highest heauens, together with Cherubins and Seraphins, thrones, and al other multitudes of celestial spirites, doe continually praise with hymnes of glorie.
               
               Remember then (deare Christian brother,) that euerie tyme thou doest commit a capital sinne, thou gyuest (as it were) a blowe in the face to this great God of eternal maiestie, whos mansiō (as S. Paul describeth,) is in a light inaccessible such as no man in this vvorld can endure to behold. Wherof S. Iohn th' euangelist gyueth 1. Tim. 6. good testimonie, by his owne experiēce; who notwithstādig he were an Apostle, and most dearly beloued of his God and

maister; yet when Christ appeared vnto him after his Resurrection, with certaine sparcles only of his dreadful gloric, vttering Certaine de clar. iliōs of Gods Maiestie. words of most sweet consolation vnto hym; he was for al that, so astonied & oppressed with feare, that he fel doune starke dead, as him self confesseth, vntil the same his Lord and Maister, vouchsafed to raise him vp againe. The like trial of this inexplicable maiestie, had Moyses the familiar friend and trustie seruant of God; who after many conferences, desiring once in his life to see him, whos wordes he had so often heard; made humble petition for the same. But God answered, that no man might see hym and lyue. Yet notwithstanding, to satisfie his request, and to shew him in parte what a terrible and maiesticall God he was: he promised Moyses, that he should see some part of Exod. 33. his glorie; how beit he added, that it was needfull he shoulde hyde him self in the hole of a rocke, & be couered with Gods owne handes for his defence, whiles he, (or rather his Angel as diuines doe interprete,) did passe by in glorie. Who being once past; God remoued his hande, and suffered Moyses to behold the hynder partes only of the Angel, which was notwithstanding most terrible and dreadful.
               The same maiestie was reuealed also in some part to Daniel, who sawe God (as he writeth) placed vpon a most glorious Dan. 7. throne; his apparell vvas as vvhit as snovv; bis beare lyke vnto fyne vvoolle; bis throne vvas of
                  
                  a flame of fyre, and his chariottes vvere a burning furnace; a svvift flud of fyre ranne from his face; thousand thousandes did serue him, and ten thousand hundred thousands did assist him: Al this and much more is recorded in holy scripture, to admonishe vs therby, what a wonderful prince of maiestie he is, whom a synner doth offend. Which thing that iust and holie man Iob considering; and hearing but one word vttered by his friend which in his conceit did sauour of presumption Iob. 26. against this God; burst forth into thes wordes. Whom wilt thou teach (my friend?) wilt thou teach him which hath inspired breath into man? which hath stretched out the heauens ouer the vacuitie of this world, and hath hanged vp the earth in the aire without staie? before whom hel is wide-open and ther is no couering from perdition? The pillers of heauen doe tremble and quake at his only fight. And if we should heare but the lest whispering of his speech; who should be able to abide the thunder of his maiesties greatnes?
               
               Imagine then novv (my louing brother, A contemplation of Gods Maiestie.) after althes testimonies, that thou seest before thy face, this great and mightie king sitting in his chaire of maiestie, with chariottes of fire, vnspeakable light, and infinite millions of Angels aboute him. Imagine further, (which also is most trew,) that thou seest al the creatures in the world stand in his presence, and trembling at his maiestie, and most carefullie

attending to doe that, for which he created them: as the heauens to moue aboute: the Sunne, moone, and Starres to geeue lighte and influence: the earthe to bringe foorth her sustenance: and euerie other creature diligently to labour for perfourmance of the dutie assigned vnto him. Imagine besides, that thou seest al these creatures (how bigge or litle soeuer they be,) to hange and depende onlie of the power and vertue of this God; and therby only to stande, moue, and consist; and that there passeth from God to eche creature in the world, yea to euerie parte that hath motion or being in the same, some beame of his vertue: euen as from the sunne, we see infinite beames passe into the ayer. Consider (I say) that no one parte of anie creature in the world, (as the fishe in the sea, the grasse on the ground, the leaues of Hovv al creatures depende vpon the Creator. trees, or the partes of man vpon the face of the earth,) can grow, moue, or consist, without some litle streame of vertue and power deriued to it continuallie from God. So that, thou must imagine God to stand as a most glorious and resplendent Sunne, in the midle or center of al thinges created, and from him, to passe foorth innumerable beames and streames of vertue, to all the creatures that are either in heauen, earth, the ayer, or waters, & to euerie parte and particle of the same; and that vpon thes beames of his deuine vertue, all creatures doe depend; in so much, as if he should stop or diuert but any one of them

al; it would destroye and annihilate presentlie some creature or other.
               This I saye, if thou shalt consider touching the maiestie of God, and the infinite dread that all creatures haue of him, except onlie a sinner, (for the deuils also doe feare him as S. Iames affirmeth:) thou Iac. 2. wilt not meruaile at the seuere iudgemēt appointed for his offence. For sure I am, that very shame of the world maketh vs to haue more regarde in offending the poorest friende we haue in this life, thē a wicked man hath in offending almightie God: which is an intollerable contempt of so great a maiestie; & such a cōtempt in deed as God him self doth account to pro ceede of plaine infidelitie. For wheras at a certaine time, he had declared his owne Lacke of feare proceedeth of Infidelitie. great power, by the mouth of Ieremie, & threatened manie punishmentes to the Iewes for their wickednes: thei werenothig moued therwith. Wherupō he cōmaūded hī to returne againe vnto thē, & to say thes wordes. Heare thou folishe people, vvhich hast no hart; you that haue eyes and see not, eares and 
                  Ierem. 5. 
                  heare not. And vvil ye not then feare me? vvil ye not trēble in my sight? vvhich haue sett the sandes for a bounde vnto the sea, and haue gyuen him an eternal precept vvhich he shal not breake? &c. This people hath a faithles hart &c. Which is as much as if he had said, that this lacke of feare in the Iewes, proceeded of their defect of faith. For if they had belieued him to be in deed so powerful, terrible, & ful of maiestie, as the holie scripture setteth

him doune; they would haue conceyued more feare in offending him.
               
                  BVT NOVV IF VVE adioine to THE. 2. part. GODs benefites. this contemplation of maiestie, an other consideration of his benefites bestowed vpon vs: our default wil grow to be far greater. For that to iniury him, who hath done vs good; is a thinge moste detestable euen in nature itself. And there was neuer yet so fearce a harte, no not among brute beastes, but that it might be wonne with curtesie and benefites. But much more among reasonable creatures doth beneficence preuaile, especiallie if it come from great personages, whose loue and friendshippe (declared vnto vs but in small gyftes) doth greatlie by nde the hartes of the receyuers to loue them againe.
               Consider then (deare Christian) the infinite good turnes and benefites which thou hast receyued at the handes of this great God, therby to winne the to his loue, and that thou shouldest leaue of to offende and iniurie him. And albeit no tongue created either of man or Angel, can expresse the one halfe of thes giftes which thow hast receyued from him, or the value therof, or the great loue and hartie good will, wherwith he bestowed the same vpon the: yet for some better helping of thy memorie, & stirring vp thine affection to be grateful; I will repeate certaine generall and principall pointes therof, wherunto the rest may be easilie referred.
               
                  
First then, cal to minde, that he hath bestowed THE. 1. benefite. Or creatiō. vpō thee the benefite of thy creation; wherby he made the of nothing to the likenes of hymself, and appointed the to so noble an ende, as is to serue him in this life, and to raigne with him in the life to come; hauing furnished thee besides, for the better attainmēt therof, with the vse, seruice, and subiection of al his other creatures. The greatnes of which benefite may partly be conceyued, if thou doe imagine thy self to lacke but any one parte of thy bodie, as a legge, an arme, an eye, or the like: and that one should freelie euen of pure good wil and loue, supplie thy want, and gyue the same vnto thee. Or if thou wantest but any one of thy senses, as that thou were deafe, blynde, or dumme; and some man should restore thy sight, hearing, or fpeech vnto thee: howe wouldest thou esteeme of this benefite? how much wouldest thow professe thy self beholdig vnto him for the same? And if the gyft of one of these partes onlie, would seeme vnto thee so singuler a benefite: how greatly oughtest thou to esteeme the free gyfte of so manie partes together?
               Adde now hereunto, (as I haue sayde) that he hath created the, to thee lyknes of no other thing, but of him self; to no other ende, but to be his honorable seruante in this world, and his compartener in kynglie glorie, for all eternitie to

come: and this he hath done to the, being only a peece of earth or claye before. Now ymagine then, of what sea of loue al this proceeded. But yet adde further, how he hath created all this magnificēt world for the, and all the creatures therof to serue thee in this busines: the heauens to gouerne the and to geeue the light: the earth, ayer, and water, to minister most infinite varietie of creatures for thy behoof and sustenance: and of al thes hath made the Lord & maister, to vse them for thine auaile and benefite in his seruice. Which giftes being so manifold and magnificent as they are; I appeale to thine owne cōscience (good Christian brother) how intollerable an ingratitude it is, so greatly to dishonour & iniurie the giuer, as to applie thes giftes to his offence, which he bestowed vpon the for his seruice.
               Next after this ensueth the benefite of thy redemption, much more excellent and The 2. benefite. OF redemption. bountiful thē the former; the effect wherof is, that wheras thou hadst lost al those former giftes and benefites, and hadst made thy self guiltie by sinne of eternal punishmēt and damnation, (wherunto the Angels were now deliuered for their sinne committed before:) God chose to redeeme the, and not the Angels; and for satisfying of thine enormous fault, vouchsafed to deliuer his owne only soone to the most opprobrious death of the Crosse. O Lord God, what hart can possibly conceyue the greatnes of this benefite?

Suppose with thy self (gentle Christian) for better vnderstanding of this benefite; that thou being a poore and abiect person, vnder the dominion of some great & mightie Emperour, hadst with some of his principal Peres, committed grieuous crimes A supposition for expressing the greatnes of this benefite. against his Emperial Maiestie; thou oftentimes, and they but once; and being both by law conuicted, and redie to suster Iustice for the same; so singulerly should the Emperours fauour extend it self in thy behalf, as deliuerig ouer thos other great princes to execution for their demerites; he conceyued a desire to saue and pardon thee. And finding no other conuenient meanes in respect of his Iustice, how to doe the same, should vpon his only sonne and heire of al his Empire, laie the paines, shame, and tormēts of death due vnto thy trespasses. Tel me now, if being so abiect and cōtemptible a creature, thou shouldst receyue so great a grace of a mightie Emperour, who had for fewer offences, euen in thy sight, put to death greate and glorious princes; (as God did thos principal Angels:) how wonderfully wouldest thou thincke thy self bound and beholden vnto him for the same? But if further, this sonne and heire of this noble Monarch, refusing to speake one word for thos great princes, should not only accept willingly this dishonour and punishment laid vpon him by his father, for thy sake, but also should offer himself therunto, and craue most instantly, that he might by his death

make satisfaction for thine offences, and not only this, but also to deriue vnto thee the participatiō of his inheritāce, making thee of a bondslaue, heire apparant to so Puissant an Emperour, & coheire to him self: could thy hart possibly conceyue so great a benefite? were it possible, that thy powers of bodie & soule should not dissolue in the cogitation of so inspeakable a grace? would not thy bowels burst in sunder with the vehemencie of loue towards such a benefactour? Or can any mā of reason, euer imagine, that thou wouldest willingly for a thousand worlds, offend any more so gratious a Lord? And yet is this benefite of thy redemption (deare brother,) by infinite degrees surpassing both this and al other temporal graces, that mans wit can imagine, in al and euery circumstance that before hath bene mentioned.
               In the third place doe come to be considered, THE. 3. and 4. benefites. OF vocation and iustification. two other benefites named vocation and Iustification. The first wherof is, that, wherby God of his infinite depth of mercies, hath called vs from infidelitie, to the state of Christians; and therby made vs partakers of this our redemption last mentioned, which infidels are not. For albeit he payed the ransome for al in general; yet hath he not imparted the benefite therof to al, but to such onlie as best it pleased his diuine goodnes to bestow it vpon. After which grace of vocation, and Rom. 8. 1. Cor. 1. our acceptance therof, insued immediatlie

our iustification wherby we were not onlie set sree from al our sinnes committed before, and from al paine and punishement dew to the same: but also our soules were beutified and enriched by the infusion of his holie grace inherent, accompanied Rom. 5. 1. Cor. 13. Esa. 11. with the vertues theological, as faith, hope, and charitie; & with the most pretious giftes of the Holie Ghost: and by this grace, wee were made iust and righteous in the sight of God, and entitled to the most blessed inheritance of the kingdome of heauen, the worthines of which gift, no tongue of man or Angels can expresse.
               After these doe ensue a greate number of benefites together, apperteining properly The 5. benefite. OF the Sacramentes. to such as are made the children and true frendes of God; euery one wherof in it self is of most infinite price and valew. Among which are in the first place to be nombred, the holie Sacraments of Christs Church, left vnto vs for our comfort and preseruation after we be entred into the bosome therof. They being nothing els in deed, but certaine sacred cōduits to cō
                  uaie vnto vs the holie grace of God: especially thos two which appertaine to al men in general, I meane, the holy Sacraments of penance and of the blessed bodie and blood of our Sauyour: wherof the first, is to purge our sowles from sin so The vse of Sacramētes often as she falleth; the seconde, to feede and comforte the same after she is purged. The first, is as a bathe made of Christs

owne pretious bloode, to washe and clēse our woundes therein: the secōde as a most comfortable and riche garment, to couer our soule after she is washed. In the first, Christ hath left with his spouse the Church, al his authoritie, which he hath in heauē or earth to remit sinnes: in the secōd, he hath left him self, & his owne flesh and bloode, to be a pretious foode, wherwith to seede and cherish our soule after her sinnes be remitted.
               Besides al thes; ther yet remaineth an other benefite which we cal the benefite The 6. benefite. Of preseruation and inspiratiō. of Preseruation; wherby God hath kept and preserued vs from infinite dangers, wherūto many others before vs haue fallen, and into which our selues had fallen in like maner, if gods-holie hande had not stayed vs: as from heresie and infidelitie, and manie other greeuous sinnes: but especially, frō death & damnation, which longe a goe by our wickednes, we deserued to haue bene executed vpon vs. Wherunto maie be annexed also the most singuler benefites of godlie inspirations and admonitions, wherby God hath often both knocked inwardlie at the dore Apoc 3. of our conscience, and warned vs outwardly by so many wayes and meanes, as are good bookes, good sermons, good exhortations, good companie, good exāple of others, & a thousand other most merciful means besides, which at diuers times he hath vsed and doth vse, therby to gaine vs and our sowles vnto his eternal kingdome,

by stirring vs vp to abandon vitious life, and to betake ourselues to his holy and swete seruice.
               Al which most rare and excellent benefites, being measured either according Circumstā
                     ces of benefites. to their inestimable value in themselues, or according to the loue of that harte from which they do proceede, or els if we respect the maiestie of the giuer, or meanesse of the receyuer: ought in reason to moue vs most vehementlie to gratitude towardes so bountiful a benefactour. And this gratitude shoulde be, to resolue ourselues at length, to serue him vnsaynedlie, & to preferre his fauour before al wordlie or mortal respectes whatsoeuer. Or if we can not obtaine so much of ourselues; yet at leastwise not to offende him anie more by our sinnes and wickednes.
               There is not so fearse or cruell a nature in the world, (as I noted before,) but is mollisied, allured, and wōne by benefites: And stories do make reporte of straunge A Flian. in 
                        〈◊〉
                     . animal. examples in this kinde, euen among brute beastes; as of the gratitude of lyons, dogges, and other like, towardes their maisters and benefactours. Onliean obstinate sinner is he, among all the sauuage creatures that are, whom neither benefites can moue, nor curtisies can mollifie, nor promises can allure, nor gyftes can gayne, to the faithfull seruice of God his Lord and maister.
               The greatest synner that is in the

world, if he geeue his seruante but twentie nobles a yeare, or his tennant some The intollerable ingra titude of a sinner tovvards God litle farme to liue vpon; if they for this, should not serue him at a becke; he crieth out of their ingratitude. But if they should further malitiouslie seeke to offende him, and to ioyne in amitie with his professed enimie: how intollerable a matter would this seeme in his conceit? And yet him self, dealing much more ingratfullie and iniuriouslie with almightie God, esteemath it a matter of smal consideration, & easely pardonable. He dealeth (I saie) far more ingratfullie with God; for that he hath receyued a thousand folde for one, in respect of all the benefites that one mortal man can gyue vnto an other. Seing, that of God, he hath receyued al in al; the bread which he eateth, the grounde he treadeth, the light he beholdeth, the aire he enioyeth, and finally, what so euer he possesseth ether within or without his bodie: as also the minde with al her spiritual endumētes, wherof eche one is more worth, then ten thousand bodies.
               Of this extreme ingratitude and iniurie, God himself is enforced to complaine in Godes complainte of sinners. diuers places of holy scripture, as where he saith; they repaied me euil for good. And yet much more vehemētlie in an other place, Psal. 34. he calleth the heauens to witnes of this iniquitie crving out: Obstupescite caeli super 
                  Iere. 20. 
                  hoc. O you heauens be you astonished at this. As if he should saye by a figuratiue kinde of speech; goe out of your wittes

you heauens with meruaile, at this incredibile iniquitie of man to wardes me; For so he expoundeth the whole matter more Esa. 1. at large in an other place: 
                     Audite cals & auribus percipe terra, &c. Harken oye heauens, and thow earth bende hither thine eares: I haue nourished vp children and haue exalted them, and now they doe cō
                     temne me. What a lamentable complaint is this of almightie God against most vile and base wormes of the earth? But yet he amplifieth this iniquitie more vehemētly by certaine examples and comparisons.

               Wherfore (deare brother) if thou haue The cōclusion. grace, cease to be vngrateful to God any longer: cease to offend him which hath by so many waies preuented the with benefites: cease to render euil for good, hatred for loue, contempt for his father lie affection towardes the. He hath done for the Isa. 4. al that he can: he hath geeuen the al that thow art: yea and (in a certaine maner) al that he is worth hym self: and meaneth besides, to make the partaker of al his glorie in the world to come, and requireth

no more for al this at thy handes, but loue and gratitude. O my louing brother why wilt thou not yelde vnto him this his desire? why wilt thou not doe as much to him, as thou woldest haue an other mā to doe to the, for lesse then the ten thousand parte of thes benefites which thow hast receyued? for I dare bouldly saye, if thow haddest gyuen but an almes to a poore man at thy dore, thou wooldest thike him bounde to loue the for it, al beit besids this, ther were nothing in the that greatly might deserue his loue. But thy Lord and maister (setting a parte al his giftes bestowed vpon the) hath infinite causes to drawe thy loue vnto him, that is to saye, all the causes which any thing in the world hath in it to purchase loue, Causes of loue in God besides his benefites. and infinite more besydes. For, if all the perfections of thinges created both in heauen and in earth, that may procure loue, were ioyned together in one: as al their beautie, al their vertue, al their wisdome, al their sweetnes, al their nobilitie, al their goodnes, and other like excellencies: yet thy Lord & Sauy our whom thou contemnest, surpasseth all thes, and that by infinite and infinite degrees: for that he is not onlie all thes thinges together: but morouer he is verie beautie it self, vertue it self, wisedome it self, sweetenes it self, nobilitie it self, goodnes it self, and the verie fountaine and welspring, from which by litles peeces and parcels al thes thinges are deriued vnto his creatures.
               
                  
Be a shamed then (good Christian) of this thine ingratitude, to so great, so good, and so bountifull a Lord: and resolue thy self for the tyme to come, to amende thy course of life, and former behauiour towardes him. Say at lēgth with the Prophet, (hauing considered thine owne ingratitude:) O Lord pardon me mine offences, for they are great in thy sight. I know there is nothing (ô Lord) which doth so much Psal. 24. displease the, or drie vp the fountaine of thy mercie, or so byndeth thy handes frō

But I haue done it (ò Lord) in mine ignorance, not considering thy infinite giftes bestowed vpon me, or what account thou wouldest demaunde againe of the same. But now, seing thou hast vouchsafed to make me woorthie of this special grace also, wherby to see & knowe mine owne errour & default: I hope hereafter by direction of the same grace, to shew my self a better childe towardes the. O my God, I am vāquished at lēgth with cōsideratiō of thy loue: and how can I haue the harte to offend thee hereafter, seing thou hast preuented me so manie wayes with benefites, euen when I demaunded not the same? Can I haue hādes euermore to sinne agaīst thee, which hast gyuen vp thine owne handes, to be nayled on the crosse for me? No, no, it is to great an iniurie agaīst thee (ô Lord,) and woe worth me that haue

dōneit so oftē heretofore. But by thy holy assistāce, I trust not to returne to such iniquitie for the time to come, to which I beseeche the for thy mercie sake, from thy holie throne of heauen, to saye.

               OF WHAT OPINION WE SHAL BE CONCERNING THE MATTERS AFORsaid, at the time of our death. As also vvhat our state shalbe at that passage, and hovv different our iudgement from that it is novv. CHAPT. X.
               THE holy scriptures doe teach vs, and experience maketh it plaine, that during the time of this The induration of some hartes. life, the commodities, prefermentes, & pleasures of the world, doe possesse so stronglie the hartes of manie men, and doe hold them chained with so forcible enchauntmentes, being forsaken also vpon their iust desertes of

the grace of God: that saye and threaten what a man can, and bring against then all the whole scripture, euen from the begynning of Genesis to the end of the Apocalips, (as in decde it is al against synne and synners:) yet wil it preuaile nothing with them, being in that lamentable case, as either they beleeue not, or esteeme not, what so euer is saide to that purpose, against their setled lyfe and resolution to the contrarie. Of this we haue infinite examples in scripture: as of Sodome and Gomorra, Gen. 19. with the cities ther about, which would not heare the warninges that good I ot gaue vnto thē. Of Pharao also and his court, whom al that euer Moyses Exo. 6. 7. 8. 9. could doe, ether by signes or sayinges, moued nothing at al. Of Iudas in like maner, who by no sweet meanes or sharpe Math. 26. threatninges, vsed to him by his maister, could be brought to change his wicked resolution. But especially the holy Prophets sent by God, from tyme to tyme, to dissuade the people from their noughtie life, and consequentlie to deliuer them from the plagues that hanged ouer them; doe gyue abundant testimonie of this matter, complaining cuerie where, of the hardnes of synners hartes, that wold not be moued with al the exhortations, preachings, promisses, allurementes, exclamations, threatnings, and thunderinges, that they could vse. The Prophet Zacharie shal testifie for all in this behalf; who faieth of the people of Israel a litle before their

destruction. This sayeth the Lord of hostes, iudge iustije: wherunto presentlie he addeth: And they vvould not attende, but turning their backes 
                  Zach. 7. 
                  vvent avvaye, and stopped their eares, to the ende they might not neare; and they did obdurate their hartes as an adamant stone, to the end they might not heare the lavve, and the vvordes. vvhich God did send in his spirite, by the handes of the former Prophetes, vvherby godes great indignatiō vvas stirred vp against them.
               
               This then is, and alwayes hath bene, the maner of dissolute worldlinges and reprobare people; to harden their hartes as an adamant stone, against any thing that can be told them for the amendement of their liues, and for the sauing of their soules. Whiles they are in health and prosperitie, they wil not know God, as in an Esa. 1. other place himself complaineth. But yet as the Prophet saieth: God wil haue his daye, with thes men also, when he wilbe knowen. And this is, cognoscetur Dominus 
                  Psal. 9. 
                  iudicia saciēs. God wilbe knowen when he begineth to doe iudgmēt, which is, at the daye of their death; being in deed the next dore to their iudgement, according as S. Paul testifieth, saying; it is appointed for al 
                  Heb. 9. 
                  men once to die, and after that ensevveth iudgement.
               
               This (I saye) is the day of God, most terrible, Isa. 2. 13. 34. 37. 61. sorowful, and ful of tribulation, to the wicked; wherin God wilbe knowen to be a righteous God, and to restore to euerie 
                  2. Cor. 5. 
                  man according as he hath donne vvhile he liued: or as the Prophet describeth it; he vvilbe 
                  Psal. 75.
                  
                  knovven then to be a terrible God, and such as one, as taketh avvaye the spirite of princes; a terrible God to the kinges of the earth. At this daye, as there wilbe a great change in al The greate change of thinges at the daye of death. other thinges, mirth being turned into sorow, laughinges into weepinges, pleasures into paines, stoutnes into feare, pride into despaire, and the like: so especiallie wil there be a strange alteration in the iudgement and opinion of men: for that the wisedome of God, wherof I haue spoken in the former chapters, and which (as the scripture saieth) is accounted folie by the vvise of this vvorld; wil then appeare in 1. Cor. 2. her likenes, and, (as it is in verie deede,) wilbe confessed by her greatest enimies, to be the onlie true wisedome; and al carnal wisdome of worldlinges, to be Rom. 8. 1. Cor. 1. meere folie, as God calleth it.
               This the holie scripture setteth downe clerelie, when it describeth the verie speeches and lamentations of the wise men of this world, at the last daye, concerning the state of holy men whom they despised in this life. We senseles mē, did esteeme their life to be mere madnes, & their end to be dishonorable: but looke how they are now acconnted among the children Sap. 8. of God, and their portion is with the sainctes. We haue erred from the waye of trueth, and the light of righteousnes, hath not shined before vs, nether hath the sunne of vnderstanding appeared vnto vs. We haue weried out our selues, in the waye of iniquitie and perdition, and we

haue walked craggie pathes: but the waye of our Lord we haue not knowen. Hytherto are the wordes of holie scripture: The lamē
                     tation of vvicked mē in the ende. wherby we may perceyue, what great change and alteration of iudgement there wilbe at the last daye, from that which men haue now: what consessing of folie, what acknowledging of errour, what hartie sorow for laboure lost, what fruiteles repentance for hauing runne a-wrie. O that men would ponder and consider attentiuely these thinges now. VVe haue vveried out our selues (saye thes miserable men) in the vvayes of iniqnitie and perdition, and vve haue vvalked craggie pathes. What a description is this of lamentable wordlinges, who beate their braines dailie, and wearie out them selues, in the pursute of vanitie and chasse of this worlde, for which they suffer notwithstanding more paine often times, then doe the iust in purchasing of heauen? And when they arriue at the last daie, to the gate of death, weried and worne out with trouble and toyle; they finde that al their labour is lost, all their vexation taken in vaine. For that the litle pelfe which they haue scraped together in this world, & for which they haue struggled and drudged so extremely; wil auaile thē nothing at that instant, but rather encrease exceedingly the burden of their afflictions. Three causes of great miserie in death. Which afflictions shalbe so manifold, greeuous, and intollerable in the wicked: as no mind created may perfectly

conceyue the same, but he that seeleth them; albeit in part some smal coniecture may be made therof by thes three general pointes ensuing, wherunto the rest may be referred.
               
                  THE FIRST IS, THE excessiue paines which commonlie mē suffer in the THE. 1. matter. OF miserie in death. separation of their soules and bodies; which hauing liued so longe time together, vnited as two deare frendes in loue and pleasure, are now most loth to parte, were it not that violently they are enforced therunto. This paine may partlie be conceyued; if we would driue out life, but from the least parte of our bodie, as for example, out of our litle fingar, like as surgeans are wont to doe, when they wil mortifie any one place, to make it breake. What intolerable paine doth a man suffer, before this member be dead? what raging greefe doth he abyde? If then the mortifying of one litle parte onlie, doe so much afflict vs: Imagine, what the violent mortifying of al the partes together wil doe. For we see that first the soule is driuen by death to leaue the extreamest partes, as the toes, feete, and fingers: then the legges and armes, and so consequently one parte dieth after an other, vntill life be restrained onlie to the harte, which holdeth out longest as the principal part; but yet finallie must be also constrained to render it self, though with neuer so much paine and resistance. Which paine how great and stronge it is, may appeare

by the breaking in peeces of the verie stringes and holdes wherwith it was enuironed, through the excessiue vehemencie of this deadlie torment.
               Neuertheles, before it come to this pointe of yelding; no man can expresse the cruel conflict that is betwixt death and her, and what distresses she abideth in the time of her agonie. Imagine that a A similitude expressinge the paines of death. prince possessed a goodlie citie in al peace, wealth, and pleasure, and greatlie frinded of al his neighbours round about him, who promised to assiste him in al his needes and affairs; & that vpon the sudden, his mortal enimie should come and besiege this citie, and taking one holde after an other; one wall after another; one castell after an other; should driue this prince onlie to a litle tower and besiege him therin, al his other holdes being beaten doune, and his men slaine in his sight: what feare, anguishe, and miserie woold this afflicted prīnce be in? How often would he looke out at the windowes & loope holes of his tower, to see whether his friendes and neighboures would come to help him or no? And if he saw them all to abandone him, and his cruel enemie euen readie to breake in vpon him; would he not (trow you) be in a most pitiful plight? Euen so then fareth it with a poore soule, at the hower of death. The bodie wherin she raigned like a iolie princesse in al pleasure, whiles it florished; is now battered and ouerthrowen

by her enimie, which is death: the armes, legges, and other partes wherewith she was fortified as with walles and wardes during time of health, are now surprised and beaten to the grounde, and she is driuen onlie to the harte, as to the last and extremest refuge, wherein also she is most fearcelie assayled in such sorte, as she can not possiblie hold out longe. Her dearest friendes who soothed her in time of prosperitie, and promised assistance, as youth, agilitie, strength, courage, diet, phisicke, and other humane helpes; doe now vtterlie abandone her: the enimie wil not be pacified or make any league at al, but night and daye assaulteth this Turret wherein she is retired, and which now beginneth to shake and shiuer in pecees, in such sort, as she expecteth hourelie when her enimie in most raging & dreadful maner, wil burst in vpon her.
               What thinke you is now the state of this afflicted soule? It is no maruaile if a wise man become a foole, or a stoute worldling most abiect in this instant of extremitie, as we often see they doe, in such sorte, that they can dispose of nothing well either towardes God or the world at this houre. The cause wherof is, the extremitie of paines oppressing their mindes, (as S. Austē wel noteth) geuing An admonition of S. Augustin. vs ther withal a most excellent fore-warning of this daie, if men were so happie as to follow it. When you shalbe in your last sicknes deare bretheren (sayeth

he) ò how harde and painful a thing wil Ser. 48. ad Frat. in Ercmo. it be, for you to repent of your faultes committed, and of good deedes omitted? and why is this? but onlie, for that all the intentiō of your minde wil runne thither, where al the force of your paine is? Manie impedimentes shall let men at that day. As the paine of the bodie, the feare of death, the sight of children, for the which their fathers shall often times thinke thē selues damned; the weeping of the wife, the flatterie of the world, the temptation of the deuil, the dissimulation of phisitions for lacre sake, and the like. And beleeue thou (ò man) which readest this, that thou shalt quickelie proue al this trew vpon thy self; and therfore I beseech the, that thou wilt doe penance before thou come vnto this last daie. Dispose of thy house, and make thy testament whyle thou arte whole, while thou art wise, while thou art thine owne man: for if thou tarie vntil the last daie, thou shalt be led whether thou wouldest not.Hitherto are S. Austens words.
               
                  THE SECONDE THING which THE. 2. matter. OF miserie in death. shal make death most terrible and grieuous to a worldlie man; is the sudaine parting, (and that for euer and euer) from al the thinges which he loued most dearely in this life; as from his riches, possessiōs, honours, offices, faire buildinges, goodlie apparel, and rich iewels: as also from wife and children kindred and frindes, and al other earthly delightes and

commodities, wherewith in this life he thought him self a most happie man. And now to be plucked from thes vpon the sudaine, without hope euer to see or vse them againe, and that often times when he least doubteth any such matter: must needes be a pointe of extreme griefe; especiallie, if he be in the state which holie Iob describeth when he saith. The vvicked 
                  Iob. 21. 
                  man dieth vvhen he is strōge and vvhole of bodie, riche & happie; vvhile his entrals are ful of fatte, and vvhiles his bones are vvel vvatred vvith marooe. O Iesu, what a griping griefe, how intollerable a torment vvil this be? O how true an oracle is that of God which saieth:  
                     O mors, quam amara est memoria tua, homini pacem habenti in substantiis suid?Eccle. 41.
                      O death, how bitter is thy memorie vnto a man, that hath peace and rest in his substance & riches? as who would say, there is no greater bitternes or greefe in the world to such a man, then to remember or only thinke on death; but much more to taste and trie it himself, yea and that immediately, when it shalbe saied vnto him, as Christ reporteth it was vnto that great wealthie man in the Ghospel, which had his barnes ful, and was nowe come to the highest top of his felicitie; Thou soole, euen 
                  Luc. 12. 
                  this night thy soule shalbe taken from the; and then vvho shal enioy al that vvhich thou so painfully hast scraped together?
               
               O deare Christiā, it is impossible for any The sorovv of leavinge al. mortal tōgue to expresse the doleful state of a worldlie man in this instāt of death,

when nothing of al that he hath gathered together with so much labour and toile, and wherin he was wont to repose so great affiance, wil now auaile him any longer, but rather afflict his soule with the memorie therof, cōsidering that now he must leaue al to others, & goe him self to gyue accounte for the gathering and vsing of the same, (and that perhaps to his eternal damnation,) whiles in the meane time other companions in the world, doe liue merilie and pleasantlie vpon that he hath gotten; litle remembringe and lesse caring for him, that perhaps lieth burning in vnquēcheable fire for thos riches vnrighteously heaped and left vnto them. This vndoubtedly is a most woful and lamentable point, which shal bring manie a man, to greate sorow and anguishe of harte at the last daye; when al earthlie ioyes must be left, al pleasures and commodities foreuer abandoned. O what a doleful daye of partinge wil this be? what wilt thou saie, (my frende) at this daye, when al thy glorie, al thy welth, al thy pompe, is come to an ende? What art thou the better now to haue liued in credit with the world? in fauour of princes, exalted of men; feared, reuerenced, and honoured of al sortes; seing at this instant al thy iolitie, pride, and pompe is at an ende, al thy former felicitie is arriued now to her euerlasting periode?
               
                  BVT NOVV BESIDES al this; THE. 3. matter. there is a third thing which more then al

the rest, wil make this daie of death to be OF miserie in death. most dreadful & miserable vnto a worldlie man: to witt, the consideration what shall become of him, both in bodie and soule. And as for his bodie; it wilbe no smal horrour, to thinke vpon that saying of holie scripture; the end of the vvicked 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   
                  Eccle. 10. 
                  fleshe, shalbe fire and vermine, and his inheritāce shalbe serpentes, beastes, and vvormes; that is, it must be throwen out to be the foode of vermine. That bodie, I meane, which was before so delicatelie entertained, with al varietie of meates, softe pillowes, and beddes of doune; so trimlie set forth in apparel, and other ornamentes; wherevpon the winde might not be su fred to blow, nor the sunne to shine: that bodie (I saye) of whose beautie there was so much pride taken, and wherby so great vanitie and sinne was dayly commited; that bodie, which in this world was accustomed to all pampering and nicenes, & might abide no austeritie, or discipline at al: must now be forlorne and abandoned of all men, and left only for apraie to be deuoured of wormes. Now the time is come, when thos wordes of God must be fulfilled which he vttered by his Prophet against delicate people: In that day God shal pul of al ornamentes, chaines, braselets, 
                  Esa. 3. 
                  ringes, Iuels, pomanders &c. and then shal be, in steed of svveet sauours, stinch; ī place of rich girdles, 
                        〈◊〉
                      for could heare, 
                        〈◊〉
                     . &c. Al which bodilie disgrace and miserie, albeit it can not but breed much horrour in the

hart of him that lieth a dying: yet is this nothing in respect of the dreadful cogitations, Cogitations of him that lieth in dying. which he shal haue touching his soule: to wit, what shal become therof; whether it shal goe after her departure out of the bodie? And then considering that she must appeare before the iudgement seate of almightie God, and there receyue sentence, either of vnspeakeable glorie, or insupportable paines: he falleth to consider more in particuler, the daunger therof, by comparing godes iustice and threates (set doune in holy write against sinners,) with his owne life: he begineth to examine the witues, (which is his conscience,) and findeth the same readie to laye infinite accusations against him, when he commeth to the place of iustice.
               And now (deare Christian brother) beginneth in deed the inexplicable miserie of this poore afflicted man; now doe al the multitude of his sinnes present thē selues before his face; now doth he in deed see verified that sentence of sacred Scripture; In fine hominis denudatio operum. 
                  Eccle. 11. 
                  The workes of euery man are laid open at his ende.Now doe master before his eyes all Gods threats against wicked liuers; nether is ther any one seuere saying of holy writ pronounced against sinners, which now doth not offer it self vnto his minde. Our ghostlie enimie which in this life laboured to keepe al these thinges frō our cōsideration, therby the more easely,

to entertaine vs in sinne and pleasure; wil now laye al and more, before our face, amplifying and vrging euerie point to the vttermost, and alleaging our conscience in euery thing for his witnes. Which when the poore soule in dying can not deny; she must needs therby most vehemently be terrefied: and so we see it daily come to passe, euen in many most vertuous and holie men: whereof S. Ierome reporteth Ierom in vita Hilarionis abba. a verie memorable example of blessed S. Hilarion, whos soule being greatly frighted with thes confiderations, and exceeding loth to depart from his bodie; at length after long conflict, he tooke hart & said, goe forth my soule, goe forth, vvhy art thou so sore affraid; thou hast serued Christ almost threescore & ten yeres, & art thou novv so fearful to depart? To like effect also the holie martyr of god S. Cyprian telleth of avertuous Cyp. lib. de mortalit. and godlie bishoppe, which dyinge in his time, was greatlie terrified at the houre of death, notwithstanding he had liued verie vettuouslie; vntil at length Christ Note here that Bun. reiecteth not only thes authorities of S. Cypriā & Possidonius, but also she vvhole discourses folovving of S. Augustine, S. Gregorie, and of venerable Bede: for that they talke of apparitions. appearing vnto him in the forme of a goodlie yong man, rebuked him in thes wordes; you are affraid to suffer, and out of this life you vvil not goe; vvhat thē shal I doe vnto you? which wordes and example S. Austen did often vse to recount talking of this matter, as his scholar Possidonius recordeth in his life.
               Now then, if good men and saintes are so a fearde at this passage, yea such as had serued God with al puritie of life, & perfect

zeale for the space of three score and ten yeres together: what shal they be, which scarcely haue serued him in deed one daye in al their liues, but rather haue spent their yeres in sinne and vanitie of this world? shal not these mē (trow you) be in greate extremitie at this passage? Surely S. Augustine describeth the same verie effectuously in one of his sermons, and (according to his manner) doth gyue a notable exhortation vpon the same. If you wil know dearlie beloued (saith he) Ser. 50. ad fiatres in Eremo, and cap. 1. de vanitate seculi. with how greate feare & paine the soule of man doth passe from the bodie: marke diligently what I shal saie vnto you. The Angels at that hower, shal come to take the soule and bring her before the iudgement seate of a most dreadful iudge: and then she callinge to minde her wicked deedes shal beginne exceedingly to feare and tremble, and would gladlie flie and leaue her deedes behinde her, seekinge to entreate the Angels, and to request but one hower space of delaye. But that wil not be graunted: and her euil workes crying out al together shal speake against her, and save, we wil not staye behinde or parte from the, thou hast done vs, and we are thy workes, and therfore we wil follow the whether soeuer thou goest, yea euen vnto the seate of iudgement. This (loe) is the state of a sinners soule, which partinge from his bodie with most horrible feare, goeth onwardes to iudgemēt loden with sinnes, and with infinite confusion.

Contrariwise the iust mans soule goeth out of his bodie with greate ioye and comforte, the good Angels accompaininge her, with exultation. Wherefore (brethren) seinge these thinges are so; doe you feare this terrible hower of death now, to the ende you maye not feare when you come vnto it. Foresee it now, that then you maye be secure. Thus farre S. Augustine.
               And for that this holie father & learned Doctour in Christes Church, maketh mentiō in this place of good and euil Angels which are redie at the houre of death Appearing of Augels at the houre of death. to receyue the soules of such as depart out of this life: it shal not be from our purpose to note, that oftentimes God doth permit the apparitions of Angels both good and euil, as also of other saintes, to some men lyinge on their death beddes, for a tast ether of comforte or sorow, touchinge that which shal ensue in the world to come. And this is also one singuler priuiledge, among other belonging to this passage. And concerning the iust, I haue shewed before an example out of S. Cyprian and S. Augustine touching one to whome Christ appeared at the hower of his death. And S. Lib. 4. ca. 11. 12. 13. 14. &c. Gregorie the greate, hath diuers like narratiōs to that purpose i the fourth booke of his dialogues. As for example sake, of one Vrsinus, to whom the blessed Apostles S. Peter and S. Paule appeared. But as concerning euil spirites and wicked Angels, which shewed thē selues

vnto diuers sinners at the houre of death, and denounced vnto them their eternal damnation, and horrible tormentes appointed in hel: we haue manie and most terrible exāples, recorded in many graue & aunciēt writers. As among other, that recorded by S. Gregorie of one Chrisorius Lib. 4. diad. cap. 38. a greate riche man, but as ful of sinne as of wealth, to whome lying on his death-bed, the infernal fiendes in most vglie māner appeared, shewing how now he was deliuered into their power, and therfore would neuer depart from him vntil he dying, left his soule vnto thē to be caried to eternal tormentes.
               The like examples doth venerable Bede recount to haue happened in our countrie Lib. 5. hist. Angl. c. 14. about his time. And among other, of a certaine wicked Courtier in great fauour with king Coenride, to whom lying in the panges of death, and being now a litle recouered; both the good and euil Angels appeared visibly; the one laying before him a verie smal booke of his good deedes, the other a greate huge volume of his enormous crimes. Which after they had caused him to reade; by the permissiō of the good Angels, they seazed vpō him, assignig also vnto him the certaine houre of his departure, according as both him selfe confessed openlie, to al that came to visit him; and as by his horrible & desperate death ensuinge (at the very hower by them appointed,) he manifestlie confirmed. The like storie recordeth he in the

chapter folowing, of one whom he knew Beda lib. 5. cap. 15. him self; and (as both he, S. Gregorie, and S. Cyprian also doe note,) al these & such other visions, were permitted for our sake which doe yet liue, and maye take commoditie by the same; and not for their good that died, whom they nothing at al auailed.
               Which being so deare Christian brother; The application of al that haith bene said. that is, this passage of death being so terrible, so daungerous, & yet so ineuitable as it is: seing so manie mē doe perish and are ouer whelmed daylie in passing ouer this perilous gulfe, as both holie scriptures and auncient fathers doe testifie by examples & recordes vnto vs: what man of discretion would not learne to be wise by other mens dangers? or what reasonable creature would not take heede & looke aboute him, being warned so manifestlie and apparantlie, of his owne peril? if thou be a Christian, and doest belieue in deede the thinges which Christiā faith doth teach the: thē doest thou know an I most certainlic belieue also, that of what state, age, strength, dignitie, or condition, so euer thou be now; yet must: hy self (which now in health & mirth doest real this point, and thinkest the same litle appertainig vnto thee) one of these daies, (and that perhaps very shortlie after the readinge hereof,) come to proue al these thinge, in thine owne person: that is; thou must with sorow and griefe beenforced to thy bed, and there after al straggliges

with the dartes of death, thou must yelde thy bodie which thou louest now so dearly, to be the baite of wormes, and thy soule to the trial of iustice, for her doinges in this life.
               
                  IMAGINE THEN (my friend,) euē thou I saye, which art so fresh and froelicke A VERY profitable consideration. VPON he premisses. at this instant, that the ten, twentie, or two yeres, (or perhaps two monethes or daies,) which thou hast yet to liue, were now come to an ende, and that thou were euen at this present, stretched out vpon a bed; wearied and worne with dolour and paine; thy carnal frindes about the weepinge and howlinge and desiring thie goodes; the phisitions departed with their fees, as hauing gyuen the ouer; and thou lyinge there alone mute and dumme in most pitiful agonie, expecting from moment to momēt, the last stroke of death to be gyuen vnto the. Tel me in this instāt, what would al the pleasures and commodities of the whole earth auaile the? what comfort or ease would it be vnto the now to haue bene of honour in this world; to haue gathered wealth and purchassed much; to haue borne office, and enioyed the princes fauour; to haue left thy children and kinred in aboundance; to haue trodden donne thine enimies; to haue stirred much, and borne greate swaye in this life? what pleasure (I saye) or benefite would it be to the, to haue bene beautiful, to haue bene gallant in apparel, goodlie in personage, glittering in golde? would

not al thes thinges rather afflict then profit thee at this instant?
               No doubt but now, thou shouldest wel see & throughlie perceaue the vanitie of The cogitation and speeche of the soule at the last day. Prou. 11. thes trifles; thou shouldest proue true the saying of the wise man; non proderūt diuitie in die vltionis, riches wil profit nothing in the day of Gods reuēge. That most excellent demaunde of holie Iob, would oftentimes offer it self vnto thie remembrāce; Quid ad cum pertinet de domo sua, post se? 
                  What Iob. 21. hath a man to doe with his house, familie, or kinred after he is gone; what good, what comfort shal he take therby? VVho 
                  Iere. 15. 
                  vvil haue mercie of the, (saith God to Ierusalem by his prophet Ieremie,) or vvho vvil be sorovvful for the at this day? vvho vvil goe to intreate for thie peace? Thou bast abandoned me, saith God; thou hast gone from me; and novv vvil I strech out my hand, and kil the. And yet further by an other prophet he demādeth of wicked men; VVhat vvil ye doe in this day 
                  Esa. 10. 
                  of my visitation, and of calamitie that commeth vpō you? to vvhose helpe vvil ye flie? vvher vvil ye leaue your glorie? And in an other place expressīg yet more effectuallie their state and miserie, he saith: they shal crie to the 
                  Iere. 11. 
                  Godes vvhom they serued in this life, and they shal not saue them, in this time of affliction: that is, they shal crie & cal vpon their frēdes, acquaintance, wealth, honour, and other idoles which they serued more then God in this life, but they shal receaue no help or comfort from them.
               O deare Christian brother, what difference

of cogitatiōs, what chāge of iudgmentes, what discouerie of vanities wil this day bring? Thy harte within thee wil now beginne to reason; Loe, heere is an A lamentable complaint. end now of al my delites and worldlie prosperities. Al my ioyes, al my pleasures, al my mirth, al my pastimes, are now finished. Where are my friendes that were wont to laugh with me; my seruātes wont to attende vpon me; my children wont to disporte the time with me? where are al my coches and horses, wherwith I was wont to make so goodlie a shew; the cappes and knees of people accustomed to honour me; the troupes of suters following me? where are al my daliances and trickes of loue; al my pleasant musicke; al my gorgeous buildinges; al my costlie feastes and banquettinges? And aboue al other, where are now my deare & sweete frindes, who seemed they would neuer haue forsaken me? But (alas) al are now gone, & haue left me heere alone to aunswere the reckoninge for al, and none of them wil doe so much as to goe with me to iudgement, or to speake one worde in my behalfe. Woe worthe me, that I had not foreseene this daye rather, and so haue made better prouision for the same. It is now to late; and I feare me, I haue purchased eternal damnation, for a litle pleasure; and haue lost vnspeakable glorie, for a fleetinge vanitie. O how happie, and twise fortunate are they, whoe so liue as they may not be a fearde of this daye? I

now see the difference betwixt the endes of good and euil, & maruaile not though the scriptures saye of the one, the death of sainctes are precious: And of the other, the death of sinners is miserable: O that I had liued so vertuouslie, as some other haue donne; or as I had oftē inspirations from God to doe; or that I had done the good deedes I might haue donne: how sweete and comfortable woold they be to me now in this my last, & extremest distresse?
               To thes cogitations and ruful speeches (my louing brother,) shal thie soule be The Conclusion. driuen at this last howr of her departure, if now thou preuent it not, by wisdome and diligence. For which preuention, To meās to preuent the terrour of death. the spirit of God hath reueiled vnto vs two principal means: the first wherof, is, the diligent excercise of good workes in this life, wherunto Christ him self assureth  a good and happie passage at our death. For so he pronounced plainlie by a voice from heauen, to his deare Apostle S. Iohn: they shal novv rest & repose from their labours; for that their good deedes doe follovv 
                  Apoc. 14. 
                  them. And holie Dauid the prophet, expresseth the maner of a good mans departure more in particuler, saying: Dominus opem seret illi super lectum doloris cius. God Psal. 4. shal help and assist him vpon the bed of his sorow; that is, vpon the bed of his last departure, which to a worldlie man, may rightlie be called the bed of sorow, for that it is nothing els, but a collection and heape of al sorowes together.
               
                  
The second meane wherby to preuent this sorowful day, is, continuallie to premeditate  and hold in mind the coming therof, as holie Iob did, who saith of him self: al the dayes of my life, doe I attend the comming 
                  Iob. 14. 
                  of my change or departure from this vvorld. Out of which attētion & premeditation, doe proceede sundrie most excellent effectes and frutes, for preuention of al euil that may insue at that day. The first wherof,  is, to stand in continual awe and feare of death, as holie Dauid did, who confessed of him self, that the feare of death vvas 
                  Psal. 54. 
                  fallen vpon him. Out of which feare doth proceed a second effect of great weight in  mans life, named heedfulnes or sollicitude, which the blessed mā Iob had by his fornamed meditation of death; for so he saith of him self, that, by consideration, he vvas 
                  Iob. 23. 
                  made sollicitous vvith scare, and therupon he addeth further, that he doubted al his 
                  Iob. 9. 
                  vvorkes. In which case S. Paul also signifieth him self to be, when he exhorted al men to be careful to doe good vvorkee vvhiles 
                  1. Cor. 7. 
                  they haue time; and, for that this time is but short; so to vse this present vvorld, as though they vsed it not. The third effect that followeth by the meditation of death, is the vnderstanding  of our owne basenes and vilitie, wherunto S. Paul exhorted the Corinthians when he said vnto them. Except you be reprobates you knovv your selues. For he 1. Cor. 7. that thinketh often vpon the state of a dead man, shal easilie confesse with saint Iacob. 4. Esa. 4. Iames, that our life is a vapor; and with Esay;

                  that al the glorie of man, is but as a flovver of the field. And wil finallie say to him self with the wise man. Quid superbit terra & 
                  Eccle. 10. 
                  cinis? Whie doth earth and dust ware proude, and take so much vpon it?
               Thes are three most excellent effectes  that doe insue, by frequent meditation and consideration of death. But besides thes, ther followeth also a fowerth, which is the casting from vs of al superfluous worldlie cares, which are commonlie in them that consider not ther ende, according as the wise man warneth vs when he saith; God hath giuen (or permitted) to the sinner, 
                  Eccle. 2. 
                  affliction and superfluous care to scrape and gather together, to leaue it to such as to God it shal best please. And out of this effect, is ingēdred  by litle and litle and by degrees, an other more high and excellent thing, called the cōtempt of creatures for the loue of their Greator, wherunto S. Paul was arriued when he wrote thos finie wordes; I doe 
                  Phil. 8. 
                  esteeme al thinges as dunge, for the gaining of 
                   
                  Christ. And from this proceedeth an other (which is the sixt and last,) called the cō
                  tempt, or rather the loue and desire of death. Which S. Paul also had attained vnto, when he said of him self. I doe desire to be dissalued, and to be vvith Christ. And the holie prophet Dauid, who said in the beginning (as you haue heard,) that the feare of death vvas fallen vpon him: came at length to Psal. 41. crie out; my soule doth thirst after God, that is the liuelie vvel-spring; vvhen shal I come, and appeare before the face of God? So that from

the feare of death, (which is the first effect that springeth of the remembrance The highest felicitie of Saintes in this life. & meditation therof,) he was come now to the loue and most earnest desire of the same, which is the highest degree of comfort, and the most supreme felicitie that saintes doe arriue vnto in this life.
               Endeuour then (my deare Christiā brother) by frequent and diligent premeditation The conclusiō of al. of this passage, to attaine to this felicitie, or at least wise, to some parte or degree therof. Feare death now, that thou maist not feare it then. For as God by his holie spirite assureth the; he that feareth 
                  Eccle. 1. 
                  novv, shal be in securitie at the last, in the day of his departure. Nay, as holie Iob further describeth Iob. 5. the matter; he shal laugh at that day whē other mē are in spoile & famine; he shal not feare the beastes of the earth; his legue shal be with the stones of Nations; that is, he shal be no more moued or terrified with comming of death, then stones are; he shal see, that his tabernacle shal be that day in peace; he shal enter into his sepulcher, in al aboundance, as a mow of corne in the haruest time: that is; he shal departe hence in aboundance of al grace and merit at the houre of his death, which to a vertuous man, is the day of haruest, wherin he shal reape the rewardes of his good deedes which he hath sowen in this life.Thus describeth Iob the blessed departure of a godlie man, cōcluding his whole discourse with this admonition and exhortatiue clause;

                  Ecce, hoc ita est; quod auditum, mente pertracta 
                  Behold, this thing is as I haue said; which Iob. 5. thou hauing vnderstoode, passe it not ouer sleightlie, but reuolue and discusse the same diligentlie in thie minde.
               
            
            
               OF THE GREATE AND SEVERE PAINES AND PVNISHMENTES APPOINted by God for sinners after this life. As also of tvvo kindes and sortes: herof, the one temporal for them that shal be saued, th' other eternal for the damned. CHAPT. XI.
               AMONGST all the meanes which God vseth towardes the children of men in this life, to moue them to the resolution, wherof I entreate; the strōgest & most forcible is, the consideratiō of punishmentes prepared by him for rebellious

sinners and transgressours of his cō
                  maundemēts. Wherfore he vseth this motiue often, as may appeare by al the prophetes, who doe almost nothing els but threaten plagues and destruction to offendours. And this meane hath oftentimes The force of feare. preuailed more then anie other that could be vsed, by reason of the natural loue which we beare towardes our selues; and consequentlie the natural feare which we haue of our owne danger. So we reade Ion. 5. that nothing could moue the Niniuites so much as the fortelling them of their imminent Math. 3. destruction. And S. Iohn Baptist, albeit he came in a simple and contemptible maner: yet preaching vnto the people the terrour of vengeance to come, and that the 
                  Marc. 1. 
                  axe vvas novv put vnto the tree, to cut dovvne for the fire al such as repented not: he moued Luc. 3. the verie publicanes & souldiers to feare, (being otherwise people of verie harde metal) in such sort, as they came vnto him vpon this terrible embassage, and asked what they should doe to auoide these punishmentes?
               For which cause, hauing now cōsidered in the former chapters of death, and of godes seuere iudgment ensuing thervpon, (wherin euerie man hath to receyue according to his workes in this life:) it followeth 2. Cor. 5. that we consider also of the punishmentes which are appointed for thē that shalbe founde faultie ī that accounte, hereby at leastwise (if no other consideration wil serue,) to induce Christians to

this resolution of seruinge God. For as I haue noted before, if euerie man haue naturallie a loue of him self and desire to cō
                  serue his owne ease: then should he also haue feare of peril, wherby he is to fal into miserie & calamitie. This expresseth S. Bernard verie excellently according to In serm. de primordii. his wonte. O man (saieth he) if thou haue left al shame, (which appertaineth to so noble a creature as thou art:) if thou feele no sorow (as carnal men doe not:) yet loose not feare also which is founde eué in brute and sauage beastes. We vse to loade an asse and to werie him out with laboure, and he careth not, because he is an asse: but if thou wouldest thrust him into fire, or flinge him into a ditch, he would auoide it as much as he coulde, for that he loueth life and feared death. Feare thou then, and be not more insensible thā a beast: Feare death, feare iudgment, feare Prou. 9. hel. This feare is called the beginning of wisdome, and not shame or sorow; for that the spirite of feare is more potent to resist sinne, then the spirite of shame or sorow. Wherfore it is saide, remember the 
                     Eccle. 7. 
                     ende and thou shalt neuer sinne; that is, remember the final punishmentes appointed for sinne, after this life.Thus far S. Bernarde.
               First therfore to speake in general of Three coniectures of shegreatnes of Gods punishmētes. the punishmentes reserued for the life to come: if the scriptures did not declare in particular their greatnes vnto vs; yet are there manie reasons to persuade vs that

they are most seuere, grieuous, and intollerable. Psal. 71. Deut. 10. For first, as God is a God in al his workes, that is to saye, greate, wounderful, and terrible: so especiallie he sheweth the same in his punishmentes: being called Psal. 4. Psal. 93. for that cause in holy scripture, Deus iustitiae, God of iustice: as also, Deus vltionum, God of reuenge. Wherfore seing al his other workes, are maiestical and exceeding 1. His Maiestie. our capacities: we may likewise gather that his hande in punishment, must be also most wonderful. God himself teacheth vs to reason in this maner, when he Iere. 5. sayeth: And vvil ye not then feare me? and vvil ye not tremble before my face? vvho haue set the sande, for limites to the sea; and haue giuen the vvaters a commaundemēt neuer to passe the same; no not then, vvhen they are most troubled, and the vvaues therof most outragious? As who would say; if I be wonderful and doe passe your imagination, in these woorkes of the sea and other of this world, which you behould dailie: then haue yee iust cause to feare me, considering that my punishmētes are like to be correspondent to the greatnes of my other actions. 2. Gods mercie.
               
               An other coniecture of the great and seuere iustice of God in punishing, may be the consideration of his infinite and vnspeakable mercie; which, as it is the verie nature it self of God, and consequently, without ende or measure, as his godhead Psal. 84. is: so is also his iustice. And these two, are the two armes (as it were) of his diuine Maiestie, embracing & kyssing one th' other,

as the scripture saieth. And therfore as in a man of this world, if we had the measure of one arme, we might easely cō
                  iecture the length of the other: so beholding daily the wounderful examples of godes infinite mercie towardes them that doe repent: we may therby conceyue the seueritie of his Iustice towards such as he reserueth to punishment in the life to come, and whom for that cause, he calleth in holy writ, Vasa furoris; that is, vessels, Esa. 13. Psal. 7. of furie, wheron to exercise the rage of his dreadful and most terrible indignation. Gods patience.
               
               A third consideration to induce vs to the vnderstāding of the greatnes of Gods punishmentes in general; may be his maruailous patience, and long suffering of sinners in this life. As that (for example) he permitteth diuers mē from sinne to sinne, from day to day, from yeare to yeare, frō age to age, to liue continually in the contempt of his Maiestie, and transgression of his commaundementes; refusing al persuasions, allurementes, good inspirations, or other meanes of grace and fauor, that his merciful goodnes can deuise to offer for their amendment. And what man in the world could suffer this? or what mortal hart were able by inestimable sufferāce & for bearing in this life, to shew such patience? but now if al this should not be requited with seueritie of punishment, in the worlde to come: it might seeme to be against the law of iustice and equitie, and

so one arme in God to be longer then the other. S. Paule toucheth this reason in his epistle to the Romans, where he saith: duest thou not knovv that the benignitie of God is 
                  Rom. 2. 
                  vsed to bring thee to repentance? and thou by thy bard and impenitent hart, doest heape vp vengeace vnto thy self, in the day of vvrath and appearance of Gods iust iudgementes, vvhich shal restore to euerie mā according to his vvorkes. In which sentence S. Paul vseth the phrase of heaping wrath or vēgeāce, to signifie therby, that like as the couetous man, doth laie vp money daily to make his heape encrease; so the irrepentant sinner doth heape sinne vpon sinne: and God on the contrary side, heapeth vengeance to vengeance, vntil his measure be ful, to restore in the ende, measure against measure, as Esa. 27. the prophet saith, and to paye vs home according to the multitude of our ovvne abhominations. 
                  Iere. 16. Gen. 15.
               
               This was the meaning of almightie God when he said to Abraham that the iniquities of the Amorrheans vvere not yet complet: As also in the reuelations vnto S. Ionn Euangelist, when he vsed this conclusion of that booke: He that doth euil, let him doe yet more euil: and he that lieth in filth, let him yet 
                  Apoc. 22. 
                  become more filthie: for beholde I come quicklie, and my revvard is vvith me, to render to euerie man according to his deedes. By which wordes God signifieth, that his forbearance and tolleration with sinners in this life, is an argument of his greater seueritie in the life to come: which the prophet Dauid

doth insinuate in like maner, when talking Psal. 36. of a careles sinner, he saieth:  God shal deride him for that he seeth before hand, that his daie vvil come. Which daie (no doubt) is to be vnderstoode the daye of account and punishmēt after this life; for so doth God more at large declare him self in another place, in these wordes. And thou sonne of Ezech. 7. man, this saieth thy Lord God: the end is come; now (I save) the end is come vpon the. And I wil shew on the my furie, and wil iudge the according to thy waies. I wil laye against the al thine abominatiōs, & myn eye shal not spare the, nether wil I take anie mercie vpon the, but I wil laie thine owae waies vpon the, & thou shalt know that I am the Lord. Behold affiction commeth on, the end is come, the end (I saie) is come: it hath watched against the, and beholde it is come: destruction is now come vpon the: the time is come; the daie of slaughter is at hand. Shortlie wil I power out my wrath vpon the, and I wil fil my furic in the, and I wil iadge the according to thy waies, and I wil lay al thy wickednes vpō the: myn eye shal not pitie the, nor wil I take any compassion vpon the, but I wil lay thy waies vpon the, and thy abhominations in the middest of the, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord that striketh. Hitherto is the speech of almightie God deliuered by the mouth of his holie Prophete.
               
                  SEING THEN we now vnderstand OF hel. in general; that the punishmentes of God

in the life to come are most certaine to be OF paines in particuler. AND of tvvo sortes, therof. Heb. 10. greate and seuere, to al such as fal into thē (for which cause S. Paul affirmeth, that it is a horrible thing to fal into the handes of the liuing God:) Let vs consider some what in particuler, what maner of paines and punishmentes they shalbe. For better conceyuing wherof, it is to be noted, that there be two sortes of sinners in this worlde: the one, which die in the guilt of mortal sinne, and in the disfauour and hatred of almightie God, of whom it is said, Apoc. 21. 
                  the portion of vvicked men, shalbe in the lake burning vvith fire and brimstone, vvhich is called the second death. The other, which haue the guilt of their sinne pardoned by their repentance in this life, but yet haue not made that temporal satisfaction to gods iustice, nor are so thoroughlie purged in this world, as they may passe to heauen without punishmēt: and of these it is writen; 1. Cor. 3. Aug. in Psal. 37. 
                  They shal suffer detrimēt but yet they shalbe saued as by fire. 
                  Vpon which wordes of S. Paul, the holie father S. Austen writeth thus. Because S. Paul sayeth that these mē 
                  The paines of Purgatorie & the greatnes therof. shalbe saued by fire; therfore this fire is cōtemned. But surely, though they shalbe saued by it: yet is this fire more grieuous then whatsoeuer a man can suffer in this life: albeit you know how greate and intollerable thinges men haue or maie suffer. The same S. Augustine in an other place Hom. 16. ex 50. homi. expoundeth yet further the words of the said Apostle i this maner; They which haue donne thinges worthie of temporal

punishment (of whom the Apostle saieth, they shalbe saued by fire,) must passe 1. Co. 3. through a firie riuer, and most horrible shallowes of burning flames, signified by the prophet, when he saith; and a fludd of 
                     Dan. 7. 
                     fire vvent before him; and looke how much matter there is in their sinnes; so longe must they sticke in passing through; how much the fault requireth, so much shal the punishment of this fire reuenge. And because the word of God doth compare the soule of a sinner, to a pot of brasse, saying: put the pot emptie vpon the coles, vntil al the rust be melted of: therfore in this fire al idle speeches, al filthie cogitations, al light sinnes, shal boile out and consume, which by a shorte waie might haue bene seperated from the soule in this life, by almes & teares.  Hitherto S. Augustine.
               And the same holie father in an other place hath these wordes. If a sinner by his August. de vera & falsa poenitentia. cap. 18. conuersion escape death, and obtaine life, yet for al that, I can not promise him, that he shal escape al paine or punishment. For he that differred the fruites of repentance vntil the next life, must be perfited in purgatorie fire: & this fire (I tel you) though it be not euerlasting, yet is it passing greuous; for it doth far exceede al paines that mā can suffer in this life. Neuer was there founde out yet so greate a paine in flesh, as that is, though martyrs haue abidden straunge tormentes, and many wicked mē haue suffered exceeding greate punishmentes.
               
               
                  
To like effect doth S. Gregorie write Gregor. in Psal. tertis. paenitent. Psal. 27. of the seueritie of this punishment, expounding those wordes of Dauid. O Lord rebuke me not in thy surie, nor correct me in thy vvrath. 
                  This is as if he said (saith S. Gregorie) I know that after this life, some must be clensed by purging fire. And other must receyue sentēce of eternal damnation. But because I esteeme that purgīg fire (though it be transitorie) to be more intolerable, then al the tribulation which in this life may be suffered: therfore I doe not onlie desire, not to be rebuked in the furie of eternal damnatiō; but also I greatlie feare to be purged in the wrath of transitorie correction. Thus far S. Gregorie. And I might adde a hundred like other sayinges out Note that Bun. turneth of here, thes and al other fathers that speake of Purgatorie. He is not of their opiniō. of the auncient holie fathers, touching the extreame seueritie of this purging fire after death, and of the greate feare which they had therof. But that this alredy spoken may be sufficient to gyue admonishment to Catholique men that agree with thes Saints in beleef of this doctrine, more carefully to looke vnto them selues, for auoiding the rigour of this fier especially by thes two principal meanes of Almes-deedes and teares, wherunto S. Augustine most earnestly exhorteth August. in Psal. 37. them in the place before alleaged; wher also he frameth this notable collection. We see (sayeth he) what men doe or may suffer in this life: what racking, what tearing, what burning and the like: and yet al this is nothing in respect

of that fire. Thes thinges therfore which we suffer heere, are much more easie then that fire: and yet you see, that men wil doe any thing rather then suffer the same: how much more then ought we to doe that litle which. God commaundeth vs, to auoide that fire, which is by many degrees more grieuous?  This was the feeling which learned S. Augustine had in thes affaires.
               And truly it is verie straunge and wonderful The feare that olde saintes had of the fire of Purgatorie. Serm. 55. in cant. to consider, how great feare and terrour holie men of auncient time conceyued at the verie cogitation of this fire, and how slenderly we passe the same ouer now a daies, hauing infinite more cause to feare then they had. Among other that blessed deuout mā S. Bernard, who lead so examplar and strict a life as the world doth know; entering into contemplation of this matter, brake forth into thes words ensuing. O would God some man would now before hand, prouide for my head abundance of water, & to mine eyes a fountaine of teares; for so perhaps the burning fire should take no hold, where running teares had clensed before. And againe; I tremble and shake for feare, of falling into Gods hands. I wolde gladlie present my self before his face alredie iudged of my self, and not to be iudged thē of him. Therfore I wil make a reckoning whiles I am here both of my good deedes and of my badde. My euil shalbe corrected with better woorkes; they shalbe watered

with teares; they shalbe punished by fasting; they shalbe amended by sharp discipline. I wil rip vp the verie bottome of my wayes & workes, to the ende he may finde nothing vntried at that day, or not fullie discussed to his handes. And then I hope in his mercie, that he wil not iudge the same faults againe, as he hath promised. Hitherto are the wordes of S. Bernard. Naum. 1.
               
               The like great feare vttered holy S. Ambrose in thes wordes: O Lord, if thou Ambros. Praecat. prae parat 2. Ad Missam. reserue any thing in me to be reuenged in the next life: yet I humblie beseech the, that thou gyue me not vp to the power of wicked spirits, whiles thou wipest away my sinnes, by the paines of Purgatorie. And againe, in an other place: I shalbe Serm. 1. in Psal. 118. searched & examined as lead (in this fire) and I must burne vntil al the lead be melted away. And if then there be found no siluer metal in me: woe be vnto me, for I Cor. 3. must be thrust doune to the profoundest partes of hel, or els wholie waste away as straw in the fire. But if anie gold or siluer be found in me, not through my workes, but by grace and Christes mercie, and through the ministerie of my prestoode; I shal also once say: surelie they that 
                  Psal. 30. 
                  trust in the, shal neuer be confounded. And thus much of this temporal punishment reserued euen for the purging of Gods seruants in the life to come.

are dessigned to eternal death: we must Imagine that with them the case standeth much more hardlie: for therunto may be applied, that saying of our Sauiour to the good women of Hierusalem, who lamented his case, when he was going to his passion: If they doe these things in grene 
                  Luc. 23. 
                  vvord: vvhat shal become of the drie? which wordes S. Peter seemeth in some parte to expounde, when he saieth: If the Iudgement 
                  1. Pet. 4. 
                  of God begin vvith vs vvhich are his seruants: vvhat shal the end of vvickedmen be? As who wold say, that in al reason, their ende must be intollerable. For more particuler conceyuing whereof, because the matter is of great importāce for al Christiās to know: it shal not be perhaps amisse, to consider brieflie, what the holie scriptures & auncient fathers of the Catholique Church, (directed no doubt by the holie Ghost) haue reueiled vnto vs, touching this punishment.
               And first of al, concerning the place it self of punishment appointed for the damned, Of the names of hel ix diuers tō
                     gues. commonlie called hel; the scripture in diuerse languages, vsed diuerse names, but al tending to expresse the grieuousnesse of torments therin to be endured. As for example, in the latin tongue, it is Esa. 5. & 38. INFERNVS. called, INFERNVS, that is, a place beneath or vnder ground, as most of the olde fathers doe interprete. But whether it be vnder ground or no, most certaine it is, that it is a place most opposit to heauen which is said to be aboue, and from which

lucifer was throune doune. And this Iob. 11. Esa. 14. name is vsed to signifie the miserable deiection and hurling doune of the damned, to be troden vnder the feet, not onlie of almightie God, but also of al good men for euer. For so sayeth the scripture. Beholde 
                  Mala. 4. 
                  the day of the Lord commeth burning like a fornace, and al proud and vvicked men shal be stravv to that fornace, and you that feare my name shal tread them dovvne, and they shalbe as burnt ashes vnder the soles of your feet in that day. And this shalbe one of the greatest miseries that can happen to the proude and stoute potentates of the worlde, to be thrown doune with such contempt, and to be troden vnder the feet of thē, whom they so much despised in this world.
               The Hebrue word which the scripture vseth for hel, is SEOL, which signifieth SEOL. Esa. 14. Mat. 14. properly a great ditche or dungeon. In which sense the same place is also called in the Apocalips, lacusirae Dei, the lake of Gods wrath. And againe, Stagnum ardens 
                  Apo. 14. Apo. 21. Mat. 11. In cō. supra verba, vide latenter. HADES. ZOPHOS. 2. Pet. 4. 
                  igne & sulphure, a poole burning with fire & brimstone. In greek the scripture vseth three wordes for the same place. The first is, HADES, vsed in the ghospel, which (as Plutarch noted) signifieth a place where no light is. The second is ZOPHOS, in S. Peter, which signifieth darknes it self. In which sense it is called also of Iob. terra 
                        〈◊〉
                      & operta mortis caligine, a darke Iob. 10. Mat. 22. land and ouer whelmed with deadlie obscuritie. Also in the ghospel, revebra exteriores, vtter darknesse. The third greeks 2. Pet. 4.
                  
worde is TARTAROS, vsed also by S. Peter: TARTAROS. which worde being deriued of the yerbe tarasso, (which signifieth to terrifie, trouble, and vexe) importeth an horrible confusion of tormentors in that place: euen as Iob sayeth, there is no order, but euerlasting horrour, which the holy Ghost in an other place describeth more at large in thes wordes; Ther are spirites created to reuenge, and in their furie they haue sortified their 
                  Iob. 10. 
                  tormentes. VVhen the final daie shal come, they shal povver forth the force and rage of him that created them; fire, haile, famine, death, teeth of beastes, scorpions, and serpents.
               
               The Chaldie worde (which is also vsed in Hebrew, and translated into greke) is GEHENNA. First of al vsed by Christ our Saueour, Eccle. 39. GEHENNA. Math. 5. for the place of them which are damned, as S. Ierom noteth vpon the tenth chapter of S. Mathewes ghospel. And this Marc. 9. word being compounded of gee and binnom, signified a valley nigh to Ierusalem, The valley hinnom. called the valley of hinnom; in which the olde Idolatrous Iewes, were wont to burne aliue their owne children in the honour of the deuil, and to sound with trumpets, tvmprils, and other loud instruments, whiles they were making of this abhominable sacrifice, to the ende, the pitiful shrikes and cries of their children might not be heard. And this place was afterward vsed for the receipt of al filthines, dung, dead carions, and the like. And most probable it is, that our Sauiour vsed this word GEHENNA aboue al other,

for hel; therby to signifie the miserable burning of soules in that place, the pitiful The lothsomnes of hel. clamours and cries of the tormented, the confuse and barbarous noise of the tormentors, together with the most lothsom filthinesse of the place; which otherwise is described in the scriptures, by the names of adders, snakes, cocatrices, scorpions, and other venemouse creatures, as hath bene and shalbe afterwards declared. And with this word GEHENNA, concurreth also in signification an other vsed by the Prophet Esaie, to denote the same place; that is to saie, TOPHET. Which properly TOPHET. signifieth the forsaid valley of the children of Hinnom; but is applied expresly to declare and represent the most horrible dungeon of dāned soules. Which Esaie, (talking of God as of a great king,) describeth in thes wordes. From eternitie is 
                  Esa. 30. TOPHET prepared by this king, a profound and spatious roome. His food is fire and store of vvood: The breath of our lords mouth doth kendle the same, like a maine riuer of brimstone.
               
               
                  AND NOVV HAVING thus declared OF the paines OF hel. the names of this place & thereby also in some part, the nature: it remaineth that we examine, what maner of paines men suffer in the same. For declaration whereof, we must consider, that as heauē and hel are contrary, assigned to contrary persones, for contrary causes: so haue they in al respectes contrarie properties, conditions, and effects; in such sort, as whatsoeuer is spokē of the felicitie of the one,

may serue to inferre the calamitie of the other. As for example; when S. Paule 1. Cor. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . sayeth, that no eye hath seene, nor eare hath beard, nor hart conceyued the ioyes that God hath prepared for them that shalbe saued: we may interre, that the pains of the damned must be of like proportion. So againe, when the scripture saith, that the felicitie of thē in heauen is a perfect felicitie, containing al goodnesse, so that no one kinde of pleasure cā be imagined which they possesse Exo. 33. not: we must thinke on the contrary part, that the miserie of the damned, must be also an absolute miserie, containing al afflictions that may be, without want of any. So that, as the happines of the good is insiaite and vniuersal; so also is the calamitie of the wicked infinite and vniuersal. Now in this life, al the miseries and paines which fal vpon man, are but particular and not vniuersal. As for example, we see one mā pained in his eyes, an other in his teeth, an other in his stomak, an other in his back: which particular pains not witstanding, are some times so extreame, as life is not able to resist them, & a man wolde not suffer them long for the gaining of a million of worldes.
               But suppose that some one mā were tormēted The paines of hel infinite & vni uersal. in al the parts of his bodie at once, as in his head, his eyes, his tōgue, his teeth, his stomak, & in al other ioints & mēbers of his bodie besides: suppose (I say) he were most cruellie tormented with extreme paines in al these parts together,

without ease or intermissiō. What thing could be more miserable then this? what fight more lamentable? what calamitre more vnspeakable? If thou shouldest see but a brute beast lye in the strete thus afflicted; I know thou couldest not but take compassion of him. Wel then, consider what difference there is betwene abiding thes paines for a week, or for al eternitie: in suffering them vpon a sost bedde, or vpon a burning gridiron and boiling fornace: among a mans friendes comforting him, or among the suries of hel whipping and tormenting him. Consider this (I say gentle reader,) and if thou wouldest take agreate deale of labour, rather then in this life temporallie to abide the one; be contēt to sustaine a litle paire, rather then to incurre the other in the life to come eternallie.
               But yet to penetrate these things a litle further; not onelie al these partes of the Hovv euerie parte bathe his particuler torment in hel. body which haue bene instruments to sinne, shalbe tormented together in this place of punishment; but also euerie sense both external and internal for the same cause, shalbe afflicted with his particular torment, contrarie to the object wherein it delited most, and toke pleasure in this world. As for exāple; the lasciuious eyes shalbe afflicted with the vglie and feareful sight of deuils: the delicate eares with the horrible noise of damned spirits: the daintie nostrels, with poisoned stench of brimstone and other vnsupportable filth:

the delicate taste, with most rauinous hungar and vnquē chable thirst: and al the sensible partes of the bodi, with burning fire. As also inwardlie, th' imagination of the damned, shalbe tormented, with the apprehension of paines both present and to come: the memorie, with the remembrāce of pleasures past: the vnderstanding, with consideration of the felicitie lost, and the miserie now come vpon them. O poore Christian, what wilt thou doe amiddest the multitude of so intollerable calamites?
               It is a wounderful matter, and able (as one father sayeth) to make a reasonable The paines of hel exercised for 
                        〈◊〉
                     , & not for chestisment. man goe out of his wittes, to consider what God hath reueiled vnto vs in the scriptures, touching the dreadful circumstances of this punishment, and yet to see, how litle the rechelesse mē of this world doe feare it. For first, touching the vniuersalitie, varietie, & greatnesse of the paines; not onely the reasons before alleaged, but also diuerse other considerations in the scriptures, doe declare the same. As where it is sayed of the damned, cruciabuntur die & nocte, they shalbe tortured day and night. Apo. 20. & 14. Apo. 18. Luc. 16. And againe, Date illi tormentum; geue her torment, speaking of Babilon in hel. By which wordes of torture and torment may wel appeare, that the paines in hel are exercised, not for chastisment, but for affliction onlie and torment of the patients. And we see commonlie in this world, that tortures and torments are

so great, violent, and extreame, as the wit of man can reach to deuise. Imagin then (good brother) when God almightie shal bend his endeuour & infinit endles wisdome to create torments, (as he hath done in hel) what maner of tormēts they are like to be?
               If creating an elemēt here for our comfort (I meane the fire) he made the same so The fearse nature of hel fire, vvith the differences from ours. insufferable as it is, in such sorte, as a man wolde not holde his onelie hand therin one day, for to gaine a kingdome: what a fire think you, hath he prouided for hel, which is not created for comfort, but onelie for torment, of the parties? Our fire hath a thousand differences from that, and therfore is truelie said of the holy fathers, to be but as a painted or fained fire in respect of that. For first our fire was made to comfort (as I haue said; and that  onlie to afflict and torment. Our fire hath neede to be fedde cōtinuallie with wood,  and fuel, or els it goeth out: that burneth eternallie without feeding, and is vnquencheable, for that (as Esay saith) the Esa. 30. breath of Godes owne mouth doth blow, feede, and nourish the same. Our fire giueth  light, which of it self is comfortable; that admitteth none, but hath his desolation of inexplicable darkenes. Ours is out of his natural place and situation, and  consequentlie of lesse force then it would be ther; for which cause also we see, that it indeuoureth with al force to mounte vp, and get from vs. But that of hel is in

the natural and proper place wherin it was created, and therfor hath al his ful strength, and abideth perpetuallie. Ours consumeth the foode that is cast into it,  and therby in short space dispatcheth the paines: that, afflicteth and tormenteth, but consumeth not, to th' ende the paines may be euerlasting. Our fire is extinguished  with water, and the rage therof greatlie abated by the coldenesse of the ayer and other elemētes about it: that, hath no such abatement or qualification at al, but his absolut force remaining in al surie. And  finallie, what a straunge and incredible kinde of fire that is, may appeare in part, by thes wordes of our Sauiour, so often repeated in the Ghospel: There shalbe vveeping and gnashing of teeth. For that weeping, seemeth properlie to be referred to the Mat. 8. 13 22. 24. Luc. 13. effect of extreme burning in that fire, seing the paines of scalding and burning doe enforce teares sooner then any other paines; as appeareth in them, who vpon the sodain doe put anie burning thing in their mouthes, or doe vehementlie scald anie tender & sensible part of their body. And gnashing or chattering of teeth (as euery man knoweth) proceedeth principallie of great and extreme cold. Imagine then (my brother) what a fire this may be, which hath so contrarie extreme effects both of heate and cold. O mightie Lord, what a straunge God art thou? how wonderful and terrible in al thy workes and inuentions? how bountiful art thou to

those that loue and serue the? and how seuere and terrible to them which cōtemne thy commaundements? Hast thou deuised away how they which lie burning in a Apoc. 21. like of fire and brimstone, shal also be tormented with extreame colde? what vnderstanding of man can conceyue how this may be? but thy Iudgements (ô Lord) are a depth without bottom, & therefore Psal. 35. I leaue this to thy onelie prouidēce, praising thee eternallie for the same.
               But now besides these general paines 5. Seueral paines for seueral offenders. common to al that be in that place; the scripture signifieth also, that there shalbe particular and seueral torments, peculiar both in qualitie & quantitie to the sinnes and offences of ech offendour. For to that ende sayeth the prophet Esay to God, thou 
                  Esa. 27. Esa. 28. Iere. 2. Apo. 20. Psa. 27. 98 Eze. 24. Osee. 12. Zach. 1. 
                  vvill iudge in measure against measure. And God saieth of him self; I vvil exercise Iudgement in vveight, & Iustice in measure. And that is the meaning of al those threates of God to sinners, where he sayeth that he wil paie them home according to their particular workes, and according to the inuē
                  tions of their owne harts. In this sense it is saied in the Apocalipse of Babylō, now throwen downe iuto the lake: Looke hovv 
                  Apo. 18. 
                  much she hath glorified herself, and hath liued in dolites: so much torment and affliction geue her. Whereof the holy fathers haue gathered the varietie of tormēts that shalbe in that Li. de veri. poen. c. 2. place. As there be differences of sinnes; so shal there be varietie of torments, (sayeth old Ephraem) for the adulterour shal haue

one kinde of torment, the murderer an other, the thiefe an other, the drunkarde an other, the liar an other. And so he foloweth on, shewing how the proude marshal be trodden vnder feet to recompence his pride; the glutton shal suffer inestimable hungar; the drunkarde extreme thirst; the delitiouse mouth shalbe filled vp with gaule; and the delicate bodie seared with hote burning yrons.This is the contemplation of this holie auncient father.
               And trulie the holie Ghost signifieth 
                     Iob. 20. A maruailous descriptiō vsed by the scripture. such a thing when he sayeth in the scriptures, of the wicked worldling: His breade in his belly shalbe turned into the gaul of serpēts: he shal be cōstrained to vomet out again the riches vvhich he hath deuoured; God shal pul them forth of his belly: he shalbe cōstrained to sucke the gaules of cocatrices, and the tongues of adders shal slea him; he shal beare the smart of al that euer he hath done: and yet shal he not be consumed, but shal suffer according to the multitude of al his deuises. By which wordes is plainlie shewed, that wicked men shal receyue particular torments for their gluttonie, for their delicate fare, for extorsion, & the like. Which torments shal be greater then any mortal tongue can expresse: as may appeare by thes vehemēt and dreadful wordes which are here vsed to insinuate the same.
               And yet further, besides al this vniuersalitie, particularitie, rigour, greuousnes, 6. The straitnes of pains in hel. and horrour which hitherto hath bene declared to be in thes paines and tormentes;

the holie spirit of God reueileth vnto vs an other condition or qualitie no lesse terrible then the former which is, the most seuere straitnes therof, without al possibilitie of anie one iote of help, aide, ease, intermission, relaxation, respiration, or comfort. This is signified by thos seuere wordes of our Saueour so often times repeated, that the daned shalbe cast into hel bounden hand and foote, that is, without al habilitie Math. 12. of resistance or strugling against their tormentes: Also, by that most dreadful shutting vp of the gate, wherof our Saueour spake in such dolful maner when he said; clausa est ianua, the gate is shut vp, and made fast for euer; that is to say; in hel the gate of al mercie, of al pardon, of al ease; of al intermission, of al comfort, is shut vp Math. 25. foreuer; and that both from heauen, from earth, from the creator, and from al creatures; in so much, that no consolation is euermore to be hoped for, (as in the miseries of this life there is alwaies some,) but extreme desolation for al eternitie.
               This straitnes is likewise most liuelie expressed in that dreadful parable of the riche glutton in hel; who was driuen to 
                     Luc. 16. The vvonderful exā
                     ple of the riche glutton. that necessitie; as he desired most pitifullie that Lazarus might dippe the top onlie of his fingar in water, therwith to coole his tōgue, in the middest of that fire wherein he was tormēted, & yet could not he obtain it. A smal refreshing it semeth that it wold haue bene vnto him, if he had obtained his request; but yet to shew the

straitnesse of the place, it was denied vnto him. O ye that liue in sinful welth of the world, consider but this one example of Gods seueritie, and be a fearde. This man was in that russe & iolitie a litle before, as he wolde not gyue the verie crommes of his table, to buy heauen; and now wolde he gyue a thousand worldes (if he had them) for one drop of water to coole his tongue. Good God, what demaund could be lesse then this? what request more humble? He durst not aske to be deliuered thēce, or to haue his torments diminished, or to haue a great vessel of water wherwith to refresh his whole bodie; but onely so much as would sticke on the top of Lazarus fingar, to coole his tongue. To what extreme need was this poore man now driuen? what a strong imagination had he of the force of one drop of water? to what pitiful chaunge was his tongue now come, that was accustomed to be so daintelie bathed, and diligentlie tended with al kindes of pleasant liquors? O that one mā can not take example by an other: ô that Ooliba wil not learne to be wise by seing the punishmentes of her elder The example of one moueth not an other. sister Oolla. God reueiled the calamitie of the former, inflicted for her wickednes, therby to terrifie the latter, from the like sinne; but for that she profited nothing by Ezec. 23. that exāple, he saieth; for so much as thou Ooliba hast walked in the waies, of thie sister Oolla: this saith God vnto the; I wil lay the cup of thie sister vpō the; thou

shalt drinke it as she did, both in depthe and largenes; thou shalt drinke it vp euen vnto the verie dregges.
               
               Thus said the prophet of God then to Hierusalem, that would not be warned by the punishemētes of Samaria; and thus saith the sonne of God now to al men, that wil not be terrified by thes tormētes of the damned Glutton; and if al this be true (as it must be except the wordes of our Saueour could be false:) then what wonderful people are we, that seing our selues in danger of this intollerable miserie; doe not seeke with more diligence to preuent the same?
               In respect of these extremities & strait dealings of God in denying al comfort & consolation at this day: holie scripture Apo. 16. Eccle. 23. sayeth, that men shal fal into rage, furie, and vtter impatience, blasphening God, & cursing the day of their natiuitie, with Apo. 23. Luc. 23. eating their own tongues for griefe, and desiring the rockes and mountaines to come and fal on them, therby to ende and finish their paines.
               But now, if we adde to al this, the eternitie and euerlasting continuance of these 7. The eternitie of the paines. torments; we shal see, that it encreaseth the matter beyond al hu nane cogitation. For in this world, there is no torment so great, or affliction so violēt; but that time either taketh away or diminisheth the same. For either the tormentor, or the tormented dieth, or some other occasion happeneth, wherby the extremitie of the tribulation

is mitigated. But here no such hope or cōfort may be expected; for that, Apo. 21. as holie writ affirmeth, Cruciabuntur in saecula saeculorū, in stagne ardente igne & sulphure: 
                  They shalbe tormented for euer and euer, in a poole that burneth with fire & brimstone. As long as God is God, so long must they burne therin. Neither shal the tormentour or the tormented die, but both must liue eternallie, for the eternal miserie of him that suffereth.
               O (sayeth one holie father in a godlie meditation) if a sinner damned in hel, did A vvōderful saying, and cogitation of eternitie. know that he had to suffer those torments no more thousand yeres, then there be sandes in the sea, and grasse leaues on the grounde; or no more thousand milliōs of ages, then there be creatures in heauē, hel, and in earth: he wold greatlie reioice; for that he wolde comfort him self at the least wise, with this cogitation; that once yet the matter wold haue an ende. But now (saieth this good man) this word Neuer, breaketh his hart, considering that after a hundred thousand millions of worldes; (if ther might be so many,) he hath as farre to his iournies end, as he had at the first day of his entrāce into thos torments. Consider (good Christian) what a length one houre wold seme vnto the, if thou haddest but to hold thy hand in fire and brimstone onelie during the space thereof, or to be stretched on a racke, or other torture. We finde by experiēce, that if a man be grieuouslie sick, though he be

laid vpon a verie soft bed; yet one night seemeth a long time vnto him. He turneth and tosseth him self from side to side telling the clock, and counting euerie houre as it passeth, which seemeth to him a whole day. And if a man should saye vnto him, that he were to abide that pain but seuen yeres together: he wold goe nigh to dispare for griefe. Now if one night seeme so long and tediouse to him that lieth on a good soft bedd, afflicted onelie with a litle ague: what wil the lying in fire and brimstone doe, whē he shal know euidentlie, that he shal neuer haue ende thereof? O deare brother, the satietie of continuance is lothsome, euen in things that are not euil of them selues. If thou shouldest be bound alwaies to eate one onelie meate, albeit otherwise of it self it were not ingrate: yet would it be displeasant vnto the in the ende. If thou shouldest be bound to sit stil al thy life in one place, without mouing: it would seeme grieuous and intollerable, albeit no man did torment thee in that place. What then wil it be, to lie eternally, that is to say, world without ende, in most extreme torments and inexplicable desolatiōs? is it any way to be comprehended, how they may be suffered? ô blind iudgement of man, that maketh no more accounte of preuenting thes calamities.
               And yet might I here adioine an other circumstance of thes punishmētes, which holie scripture it self omitteth not, when

it saith, that al these torments shalbe suffered 8. Darckenes in hel. in darkenes; a thing dreadful of it self vnto mans nature, as you know. For that there is not the stoutest hart made of flesh, but if he found him self alone, destitute, Mat. 8. 22 and naked in some desolate place of darkenes, and should heare the voices and cries of infernal spirites drawing towardes him; he would be striken with feare in respect of the place it self, albeit as yet he felt no hurt vpon his body. For that nothing is more terrible to mans imagination, then to conceaue perils at hand; which the eye can not discouer, nor any thing more ful of extreme desolation, thē hauing our sight, to want for euer the vse and obiect therof. This then is the most pitiful and desolate state of such as are 9. The derisiō that shall e vsed tovvards the damned. damned, that their insupportable & euerlasting paines are sustained in darknes. whereunto also may be added an other circumstance recorded by the prophet to knit vp al the rest, which is, that God shal laugh at them in thes their miseries; an affliction Psal. 36. perhappes to be numbred amongest the greatest of al others. For as in this life, to be moned by a mans friendes in time of aduersitie, is exceeding great cō
                  fort: so to be derided and laughed at, especiallie by them, who onelie may help and redresse our miseries; is a great and intolerable encrease of calamitie.
               
                  AND NOVV AL THIS that I haue OF the paines. OF damage hitherto treated, is but one onlie part of a damned mans punishment, called by diuines,

                  paena sensus, the paine of sense or feeling; that is, the paine or punishment sensiblie inflicted vpon the soule and bodie. But yet beside this, ther is an other part of his punishmēt called, poena damni, the paine of losse or dammage; which by al learned mens opinion, is either greater, or no lesse then the former. And this is, the infinite losse which a damned man indureth, in being excluded for euer & euer, from the sight of his Creator, and from his glorie. Which sight onelie, being sufficient to make happie and blessed al thos that are admitted therunto; must nedes be an infinite miserie to the damned man, to lacke the same eternallie. And therfore, this is put as one of the first and chiefest plagues to be layed vpon him; Tollatur impius ne videat 
                  Esa. 26. 
                  gloriam Dei, 
                  Let the wicked man be taken away to hel, to the ende he may not see the glorie of God. And this losse containeth al other losses and dommages in it: as are the losses of eternal blisse and ioye; of eternal glorie; of eternal societie with the Angels; and the like: which losses when a damned man considereth, (as he can not but consider them perpetuallie;) he taketh more grief thereof (as diuines doe proue) then of al other sensible torments that he abideth besides.
               And hereof proceedeth that great and general torment, which is so often repeated The vvorme of conscience. Mar. 9. in holie write, by the name of the vvorme of our conscience, so called; for that, as a worme lieth eating and gnawing the

wood wherein she abideth: so shal the remorse Esa. 66. Eccle. 7. Iudit. 6. of our owne conscience, lie within vs griping and tormēting vs for euer. And this worme or remorse shal principallie consiste, in bringing to our mindes, the The cogitationis of the dāned. meanes & causes of our present extreame calamities. To wit, our folie and negligē
                  ce, whereby we lost the felicitie which other men haue gotten. And at euery one of thes considerations, this worme shal gyue vs a deadlie pinche & gripe, which shal reache euen to the verie bottome and intrals of our hart. As when it shal lay before vs, al the occasions that we had offered to auoide the miserie, wherin now we are fallen, and to gaine the glorie which we haue lost: how easie it had bene to haue done it: how nigh oftentimes we were to resolue our selues to doe it: and yet how vnfortunatlie we left of that cogitation againe. How many times we were foretolde of this daunger, and yet how litle care and feare we tooke of the same. How vaine thos wordlie trifles were, wherein we spent our time, and for which we lost heauen, and fel into thes most intolerable miseries. How they are now exalted, whome we thought fooles in the world: and how we are now proued fooles and derided, who thought our selues wise. Thes things (I say) & a thousand more, being laied before vs by our owne conscience; shal yeld vs infinite griefe and desolation, for that it is now to late to amend them. And this griefe is

called the worme or remorse of our own conscience: which worme, shal more enforce mē to weepe and houle at that day, then any torment els, considering how negligentlie, foolishlie, and vainlie, they are come into those so insupportable torments, & that now there is no more time place, or leaue to redresse their errors.
               Now onlie is the time of weeping, wailing, and of euerlasting lamentation The time of eternal vveeping. for thes mē; and yet al in vaine. Now shal they beginne to freat and rage, and maruaile at them selues, saying: where was our wit? where was our vnderstanding? where was our Iudgement, when we folowed vanities, and cōtemned thes affaires of our saluation? This is the talke of sinners in hel (sayeth the scripture) vvhat 
                  Sap. 5. 
                  hath our pride, or vvhat hath the glorie of our riches profited vs? They are al novv vanished like a shadovv: vve haue vvearied out our selues in the vvay of iniquitie and perdition, but the vvay of our Lord vve haue not knovvn. This (I say) must be the euerlasting song of the damned and tormented conscience in hel; eternal repentance without auaile. By which extremitie, he shal be brought to such desperatiō (as the scripture also noteth;) that he shal turne into furie against him self, teare his owne flesh, rent his owne soule (if it were possible,) & inuite the fiendes and furies to torment him more, for that he hath so beastlie behaued him self in this world, as not to prouide in time, for this principal matter, onlie (in deede) to haue

bene thought vpon. O if he could now haue but an other short life to lead in the world, how wold he passe it ouer? with what diligence? with what seueritie? But this wil not be graunted; neither is ther anie price of value to purchase it. Onlie we (deare brethren) that are yet aliue, doe inioye this inestimable grace & treasure of time for our amendement, if we were so happie as to resolue in deed, to make our gaine and commoditie therof. One of thes daies, we shal be past it also, and shal not recouer the same againe, no not one houre, if we wold buy it with a thousand worldes; as no doubt but that the dāned wold doe, if it lay in their powers. Let vs now then so vse this benefite, as when we are past hence, we haue no neede to wish our selues here againe.
               This is the onlie time wherin we may auoide al; now is the season whē we may The passing cōmoditie of the preset time. put our selues out of daunger of al thes terrible matters: now (I say) if we resolue our selues out of hand. For we know not what shal become of vs to morrow. It may be that to morrow our harts wil be as hard and careles of thes affaires, as they haue bene heretofore, and as Pharao his hart was, after Moyses departure from him. O that he had resolued him self throughlie whiles Moyses was with him; how fortunate a creature had he bene? if the riche Glutton had taken the time while Lazarus lay at his dore; how blessed a man had he made him self? he

was for told his miserie (as we are now) by Moyses and other prophets, according Luc. 16. as our sauy our doth signifie; but he wold not heare. After ward he fel into such admiration of his owne foly, that he wold needes haue Lazarus sent from Abrahams bolome vnto his brethren in the world, to warne thē of his errour. But Abraham told him, it was booteles; for that they wold not haue beleeued Lazarus in this case, but rather (perhappes) haue persecuted him as a liar and difamer of their honorable brother disceased, if he should haue reuealed vnto them his torments. And so in verie deede would the wicked men of this world doe now, if one should come and tel them that their parents or friēds are damned in hel, for such and such offences as them selues are intāgled withal. What then can God deuise to doe for the sauing of thes men? what way, what means, what order may he take, when neither warning, nor example of others, nor threats, nor exhortations wil doe any good? we know, or may know, that leading the life we doe, we can not be saued. We know and ought to know, that many before vs haue bene damned for lesse matters. We know and can not chuse but know, that we must shortlie die, and Greate negligence & ouer sight. receyue our selues, as they receyued; liuing as they did, or worse. We see by this laid down before, that the paines are vntolerable and yet eternal, which doe attende and expect the wicked. We confesse

them most vnfortunate and miserable that for anie pleasure or commoditie of this world, are now fallen into thē. What then should let vs, to dispatche our selues quicklie of al impediments? to breake violentlie from al bandes and chaines of this wicked world, that let vs from this true and zealouse resolution? why should we sleepe one night in sinne; seing that night may chaunce to be oar last, and so the euerlasting cutting of, al hope to come?
               Resolue thy self therefore (my deare brother) if thou be wise; and cleare thy The conclusion. soule from thes daungers while God is willing to receyue thy amendment, and moueth the therunto by these meanes, as he did the riche man by Moyses and his other prophets while he was yet in his prosperitie. Let his example, be oftētimes before thine eyes, and cōsider it throughlie, and it shal doe the good. God is a wounderful God; and to shew his patience and infinit goodnesse, he woeth vs in this lise; seeketh vnto vs, and layeth him self (as it were) at our feet, to moue vs therby to our owne good; to winne vs, to drawe vs, and to saue vs from perditiō. But after this life, he altereth his course of dealing: he turneth ouer the leafe, and chaungeth his stile. Of a lambe he hecometh a lyon to the wicked: and of a Saniour, a iust and seuere punisher. What can be said or done more by his diuine Maiestie to moue vs. He that is forewarned, & sceth his owne daunger before his face,

& yet is not stirred vp nor made the more wary or fearful therby; may wel be pitied, but surelie by no meanes can he be holpen, making himself incapable of al remedies, that may be vsed.
            
            
               OF THE MOST HONORABLE, EXCELLENT, AND MVNIFICENT rewardes and paimentes. Ordained for such as trulie serue God, and doe imploy their time in perfourmance of his most holie commaundementes. CHAPT. XII.
               THE motiues, reasons, & cōsideratiōs laied doune before, in the precendent chapters, might wel suffice, to stirre vp the hart of anie one reasonable Christian, to take in hand this resolution wherof we presently treate, and wherunto I doe so much couet to persuade thee (for thy onelie good and gaine) gentle

reader. But for that al hartes are not of one constitution in this respect, nor al drawen and mooued with the same meanes: I purpose to adioine here a consideration of commoditie, wherunto cōmonlie eche man is prone by nature; and consequently, may be perhaps of greater force to worke that effect which we desire, then any thing else that hitherto hath bene spoken. I intend therfore in this place, to treate of the benefits which are reaped by the seruice of almightie God; of the gaine procured therby; and of the good pay and most liberal reward which God performeth to his seruants, aboue al other maisters that may be serued. And though God the best Paimaister. the iust feare of punishment, (if we serue him not) might be sufficient to driue vs to this resolution: and the infinite benefites alredie receyued, might induce vs to the same, in respect of gratitude, (of both which some what hath bene sayed before:) yet am I content so farre to enlarge this libertie to thee (good reader,) that except I shew this resolution, which I craue, to be more gainful and profitable then any thing els in the world that can be thought of; thou shalt not be bound vnto it for anie thing that hitherto hath bene saide in that behalf. For as God in al other things is a maiestical God, ful of bountie, liberalitie, and princelie magnificence; so is he in this point aboue al other; in such sort, as albeit what soeuer we doe or can doe in his seruice, be indeed

but debt and tribute due vnto him, and for that cause of it self deserueth nothing; yet of his munificent Maiestie, he Mat. 10. Matc. 9. letteth passe no one iote of our seruice vnrewarded; no, not so much as a cuppe of cold water, bestovved for his loue.
               
               God commaunded Abraham to sacrifice Gen. 22. vnto him his onelie sonne Isaac, whom he so dearly loued. But when he was redie to doe the same; God sayed vnto him, doe it not: it is enough for me that I see thine obedience. And for that thou hast not refused to obey me, I sweare to thee (saith Liberal pai mēt for litle paines. he) by my self, that I wil multiplie thy seed as the starres of heauen, and as the sands of the sea: and among them also one shalbe the Messias and Sauiour of mankind. Was not this (trow you) a most liberal 2. Reg. 7. pay for so litle paines? king Dauid discoursing with him self on a certaine time, how his owne palace being richly builded of Cedar timber, the arke of his Lord and maken was lodged only vnder a poore tēt; resolued with him self, to erect a house and temple for the same. Which onelie cogitation God tooke in so good parte, as he sent Nathan the prophet vnto him presentlie, to refuse the thing; but yet to tel him, that for so much as he had determined such a matter, God wold build a house, or rather a kingdome to him and his posteritie, which should last for euer, and from which he wold neuer take away his mercie, what sinnes or offences so cue: Psal. 88. they committed. Which liberal promisse

we see now fulfilled in the Church of Christ descended originally from that noble family. What should I labour to heape together moe examples to this effect? Christ him self gyueth a general note hereof, when he calleth the workemen and payeth to ech man his wages so duelie; as also when he sayeth of him self; behold I come quicklie, and my revvard is vvith 
                  Mat. 20. Apoc. 22. 
                  me. By which places it is euident, that God suffereth no labour in his seruice to be lost or vnpayed. And albeit (as hereafter In the secōd part & 2. chap. of this booke. in place conuenient more amply shal be shewed,) he payeth also, (and that abundantlie) in this life present: yet (as by these two texts appeareth) he deferreth his chiefe paye, vnto his comming in the end of the day; that is, after this life, in the resurrection of the iust, as him self saieth in an Luc. 14. other place.
               
                  OF THIS PAIMENT then reserued for gods seruants in the life to come, THE. 1. part. OF the revvard in general. Mat. 25. 2. Tim. 4. 2. Pet. 1. Luc. 14. we are now to consider, what maner a thing it is, and whether it be worth so much labour and trauail, as the seruice of God requireth. And first of al, if we beleeue the holie scripture, calling it a kingdome, a heauenlie kingdome, an eternal kingdome, a most blessed kingdome: we must nedes confesse it to be a maruailous great reward: seing that in this world, hardlie can there be found so bountiful a Monarch, as wil bestowe a kingdome vpon his seruant in recompēse of his seruice; and if he would and were

able to performe the same; yet would it be nether heauenly nor eternal nor blessed kingdome, such as this is which God hath promised vnto his seruants. Secondlie, if we credit that which S. Paul saieth of this reward, that nether eye hath seene, nor eare 
                  1. Cor. 2. Esa. 64. 
                  beard, nor hart of man conceyued, how great a matter it is: thē must we yet admit a greater opiniō thereof. For that we haue sene many wounderful things in our dayes; we haue heard more wounderful; we may conceyue most wounderful, and almost infinit. How then shal we come to vnderstand the greatnesse and value of this reward? surelie no tongue created either of man or Angel can expresse the same, no imagination conceyue, no vnderstanding comprehend it. Christ him self hath said, nemo scit nisi qui accipit: No man knoweth it Apoc. 2. but he that enioyeth it. And therfore he calleth it hidden manna in the same place. Notwithstanding, as it is reported of a Hovv the greatnes of heauēlie ioy is found out. learned Geometrician, who finding the length of Hercules foote vpon the hil Olimpus, drew out his whole bodie by the proportion of that one part: so we by some things set doune in holy scripture, and by some other circumstances agreing therunto, may frame a coniecture of the matter, though it be farre vnequal and inferiour to the thing it self.
               I haue before declared, how this reward in holy writ is called a heauenly, euerlasting, & most blessed kingdome. By which wordes is signified, that al shal be kinges.

and most happie kinges, that shalbe found worthie of this reward. To like, effect is it called in other places, a crovvn of glorie; 
                  Apoc. 2. & 3. Mat. 16. Lue. 10. 
                  a throne of Maiest. c; a paradise, or place of pleasure; a life euerlasting. S. Iohn the Euangelist, being in his banishment by special priuilege made priuie to some knowlege and feeling thereof, aswel for his owne comfort as for ours, taketh in hād to describe 
                     Apo: 21. & 22. The discription of paradise vsed by S. Iohn. it, by comparison of a citie: affirming, that the whole bodie therof was of pure gold, inuironed with a great and high wal of the pretiouse stone, called Iaspis. This wal had also twelue foundations, made of twelue distinct pretious stones which he there nameth: also twelue gates made of twelue riche stones called Margarits, and euerie gate was an entire Margarit. The stretes of the citie were paued with gold, interlayed also with pearls and pretious stones. The light of the citie was the clearenesse & splēdour of Christ him self, sitting in the middest thereof: from whose seat proceded a riuer of water, as cleare as cristal, to refresh the citie: and on both sides of the bankes, there grew the tree of life, geuing out continual and perpetual fruit. There was no night in that citie, nor any defiled thing entered thereinto: but they which are within, shal raigne (sayeth he) for euer and euer.
               
               By this description of the mostriche and pretious things that this world hath, S. Iohn wold geue vs to vnderstand, the infinite

finite value, glorie, & Maiestie, of this felicitie, prepared for vs in heauen: though (as I haue noted before) it being the Heb. 1. Math. 13. princelie inheritance of our Saue our Christ, the kingdome of his father, the eternal habitation of the holie Trinitie, prepared before al worldes to set out the glorie, and to expresse the power of him that hath no end or measure, ether in power or glorie: we may verie wel thinke with S. Paul, that nether tongue can declare it, nor hart imagine it.
               When God shal take vpon him to doe The magnificencie of God expressed diuerslie. a thing for the vttermost declaration (in a certain sorte) of his power, wisdome, and eternal Maiestie: imagine you what a thing it wilbe? It pleased him some time, to make certaine creatures to serue him in his presence, and to be witnesses of his glorie: and thereupon with a word, he 1. By the creatiō of Angels. created the Angels, both for number and perfection of nature so strange and wonderful, as the cogitation therof astonieth our vnderstanding. For as for their number they were almost infinite, passing the number of al the creatures of this inferiour world, as diuers See S. Thom. part. 1. q. 50. art. 3. & Dionis. de caelesti Hier. c. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . Dan. 7. learned men and some ancient fathers are of opinion: albeit Daniel (according to the custome of holy writ) doe put a certain number for an vncertaine, when he sayeth of Angels, a thousand thousands did minister vnto him, (that is vnto God) and ten thousand times a hundreed thousand, did stand about him to assist. And for their perfection of nature, it is Psal. 102.
                  
such, (being, as the scripture saieth, celostial spirits and like burning fire;) as they farre surpasse al inferiour creatures, in natural knowledge, power, beautie and al other excellēcies; which i one Angel are more, for perfectiō of nature (not respectig grace,) then in al other creatures of the world put together. What an infinit Maiestie thē doeth this argue in the Creator?
               After this, when many of these Angels were now fallen: it pleased almightie 2. By the creation of the vvorld for man. God to frame an other creature, farre in nature inferiour vnto this, to fil vp the places of such as were fallen; and therupō created man of a peece of claye, appointing him to liue in this world, as a place of entertainmēt & trial for a time: which place God notwithstanding determined, afterward to destroie againe. But yet in creating this transitorie world, (which is but a base cotage in regard of his own eternal habitation,) cōsider (god reader) what power, what magnificence, what Maiestie he hath shewed? what heauens & how wonderful hath he created? what infinit starres and other lights hath he deuised? what elements hath he framed? and how maruailouslie hath he compacted thē together? The seas tossing and tumbling without rest, and replenished with infinite sortes of fish: the riuers running incessantlie through the earth like veins in mans bodie, and yet neuer emptie nor ouerflowing the same: the earth it self so furnished with al varietie of creatures, as

the hundreth part thereof, is not vsed nor emploied by man, but onelie remaineth to shew the ful hand, and strong arme of the Creator. And al this (as I saied) was done in an instant, with one word onelie, and that for the vse of a smal time in respect of the other future life, which is to endure for al eternitie. What then may we imagine that the habitation prepared for that eternitie shal be? If the cotage of his meanest seruant, and that made onelie for Mark this collection. a time, to beare of (as it were) a shower of raine, be so princelie, so gorgeous, so magnificēt, so Maiestical, as we see this world is: what must we think that the kings palace it self is, appointed for al eternitie, for him self and his friends to raigne together? We must needes think it to be as great, as the power and wisdome of the maker could reach to perfourme; & that is, incomparablie, and aboue al measure infinite.
               The greate king Assuerus, which raigned Hest. 1. 3. By the promisse of a banquet. in Asia ouer a hundred twentie and seuen prouinces, to discouer his power & riches vnto his subiects, made a feast (as the scripture sayeth) in his great citie of Susa, to al the princes, states, and potentates, of his dominions, for a hundred and fourscore dayes together. Esay the prophet Esa. 25. sayeth, that our God and Lord of hosts, wil at the last daie make a solemne banquet to al his people vpon the hil and mount of heauen; and that a haruest banquet, of fat meates and pure wines. And

this banquet shal be so solemne, as the very sonne of God him self, chiefe Lord and Patrone of the feast, shal be contēt to gird him self, and to serue in the same, as by his owne wordes he promiseth. What maner of banquet then shal this be? how magnificent Luc. 12. and maiestical? especiallie seing it hath not onely to endure a hundred and fower score dayes, (as that of Assuerus did,) but more then a hundred and fourscore millions of ages: not serued by men (as Assuerus feast was) but by Angels, and by the verie sonne of God him self: not to open the power and riches of a hundred tuentie and seuen prouinces, but euen of Almightie God, the king of kings, and Lorde of Lordes, whose power & riches are without end, and greater then al his creatures put together can cōceaue. How glorious a banquet shal this be then? how triumphant the ioy of this festiual daye? how in comprehensible a blisse, to be partaker therof? O most miserable and foolish children of Adam, that are borne to so rare and singular a dignitie, and yet can not be brought to cōsider, loue, or esteeme of the same.
               Other many thinges ther be, wherby to coniecture the exceeding greatnes of 4. By the plea sures & cō
                     modities of this life. this reward and felicitie; as for example, to consider, that if God haue geuen so many pleasures and comfortable giftes in this life, (as we sec innumerable in the world,) being a place notwithstanding of banishment, an habitation of sinners,

a vale of miserie, and appointed only for a time of repenting, weeping, mourning, and bewailing: what wil he doe in the life to come, to the iust, to his friends, in the time of ioye & mariage of his sonne? Apoc. 19. This was a most forcible consideration with good S. Augustin, who in the secret speech of his soule with God, said thus. O August. soliloq. c. 2. my Lord, if thou for this vile bodie of oures, hast geuen vs so great and innumerable benefites, from the firmament, from the ayer, from the earth, from the sea: by light, by darkenesse, by heate, by shadow: by dewes, by showers, by windes, by raines: by birds, by fishes, by beasts, by trees: by multitude of hearbes, and varietie of plants, and by the ministerie of al thy creatures: O swet Lord what maner of things, how great, how good, & how innumerable, are thos which thou hast prepared for vs in our heauelie Countrie, where we shal see thee face to face? If thou doe so greate things for vs in our prison: what wilt thou geue vs in our palace? If thou geuest so many things in this world, to good and euil men together: what hast thou laid vp for onelie good men in the world to come? if thine enemies and friends together are so wel prouided for in this life: what shal thy onelie friēds receaue in the life to come? if there be so great solaces in these daies of teares: what ioye shal there be in that day of mariage? if our iaile and prison containe Apcc. 19. so great matters: what shal our Countrie

and kingdome doe? O my Lord and God, thou art a great God, and great is the multitude of thy magnificence and svvetnes: and as Psal. 30. there is no end of thy greatnes, nor number of thy mercies, nor depth of thie wisdome, nor measure of thy benignitie: so is there neither end, number, depth, length, greatnes, or measure of thy rewardes, to them that loue thee & doe fight for thee. Hitherto S. Augustin.
               An other meane wherby to conceaue some parte of this reward in the life to 
                     By the honour that God hath vsed to his seruantes in this life. 1. Reg. 2. Psal. 138. come, is, to remember and weigh the manifold promisses of almightie God, to honour and glorifie al thos that shal loue & serue him. VVhosoeuer shal honor me (saieth he) I vvil make him glorious: and the prophet Dauid, as it were complaineth ioifullie, that Gods friends were to much honoured by him. Which he might with much more cause haue said, if he had liued in the new testament, and had heard that promisse of Christ whereof I spake before, Luc. 12. that his seruants should sit doune & banquet, and that him self wold serue and minister vnto them, in the kingdome of his father. What vnderstanding can cōceaue, how great this honour shal be? But yet in some part it may be gessed, by that he saieth, Mat. 19. Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 6. that they shal sit in iudgement with him; and (as S. Paul addeth,) shal be Iudges not onelie of men, but also of Angels. It may also be coniectured by the exceeding great honour which he at certaine times hath done to his seruants, euen in Mat. 10.
                  
this life; wherin notwithstanding, they are placed to be despised and not to be honoured.
               How great honour was that (trow Gen. 12. 14. 20. Abraham. Exo. 5. 6. 7. 8. you,) which he did to Abraham in the sight of so many kings and princes of the earth, as of Pharao, Abimelech, Melchiseedech, and others? How great honour was that he did to Moyses in the face of Pharao and of al his court, by the Moyses. wonderful signes that he wrought by him? What excessiue honour was that he did to holie Iosue, when in the sight of al Iosue. his armie he stayed the sunne and Moone in the middest of the firmament at Iosues Iosu. 10. appointement, obeying therein (as the scripture saieth) to the voice of a man? what honour was that he did to Esay in Esa. 38. the preface & sight of king Ezechias, whē he made the sunne to goe backe tenne degrees in the heauens? what honour was that he did to helias in the sight of wicked 
                     Helias. 3. Reg. 17 Achab, when he yelded the heauens into his hands, and willed him to say, that neither raine nor dew should fal vpon the ground (for certain yeres) but by the wordes of his mouth onely? what honour was that he did to Elizeus in the 
                     Elizeus. 4. Re. 5. 4. Re. 13. sight of Naaman the noble Syrian, whom he cured onelie by his word from the leprosie, whos bones also after his death, raised vp (by onelie touching) the dead to life? inallie, not to alleage more examples herein; what singular honour was that he Th' Apostles. gaue to al the Apostles of his sonne, that

as many as euer they laid handes on, were healed from al infirmities, as S. Luke affirmeth? Act. 5. Nay (which is yet more) the verie girdles and napkins of S. Paul did the Act. 19. same effect; and yet more then that also, so many as came within the onelie shadow of S. Peter, were healed from their Act. 5. diseases. Is not this maruailous honour euen in this life? was there euer Monarch, prince, or potentate of the world, that could vaunt of such points of honor? And if Christ did this to his seruantes, euen in this world, whereof notwithstanding he Ioh. 18. 2. Tim. 4. Apo. 4. saith his kingdome was not: what honour shal we think he hath resesued for the life to come; where his kingdome shal be in al fulnes, and where al his seruants shal be crouned as eternal kings with him?
               Lastlie, for some further declaration of 6. By the 3. places vvherto a man is appointed. this matter, and for expressing th' incomparable excellencie of heauenlie blisse; some diuines doe vse a consideration of the three different places, wherunto man by his creation is ordained, albeit in al pointes it be not necessarie to hold the same iust proportion. The first of which places is, our mothers wombe; the second, this present world; the third is, coelum Empireum, which is the place of blisse in the life to come. Now in these three places, (say the learned,) we must hold some like proportion, (by al reason) betwene the third and second place, as we see sensiblie to be obserued betwene the second and first. So that, in what proportion the second

doeth differ from the first: in like measure must the third be different from the second, on rather much more, for that eternal and heauēly thinges doe exceede al comparison of trāsitorie thinges amōg themselues. By this proportion then, we must say, (for exāple sake,) that as farre as Mark the collection. the whole world doth passe the wombe of one priuate woman: so much in al beautie, delites, and Maiestie, doth the place of  heauēlie blisse, passe al this whole world with the ornamentes therof. And as much as a man liuing in the world doth exceede  a child in his mothers bellie, for strength of bodie, beautie, wit, vnderstāding, learning and knowledge: so much and farre more, doth a Saint in heauen passe al men of this world, in al these excellencies and infinite more besides. And looke how great horrour a mā of perfect age would  conceaue, to returne into his mothers wombe againe: so much and farre greater would a glorified soule haue, to come back from that eternal blisse into this vale of miserie. The nine moneths also of life in the mothers wombe, are not so litle in  respect of any mans age in the world, as is the longest life vpon earth, in respect of euerlasting life in heauen. Nor the blindenesse, ignorance, and other miseries of the  child in his mothers wombe, are any way to be compared to the cecitie, darknes, folie, & other calamities of this life; in respect of the cleare light, most excellent knowledge, deuine vnderstāding, & other

singuler prerogatiues of the Saints in heauen. So that by al thes reasons laid together, ther may a general coniecture be framed of the most infinit and incomprehensible excellencie of this reward wherof we treate.
               
                  BVT NOVV TO CONSIDER the same thing somewhat more in particular; THE. 2. part. OF THE tvvo partes of felicitie in heauen. it is to be noted, that this reward or glorie of heauen, shal comprehend in it self two partes or members; the one called essential, belonging to the soule: the other termed accidental, belonging to the bodie. First of the soule. The essential part consisteth in the vision or sight of God, as afterward shalbe shewed. The accidental consisteth in the Secōd of the bodie. change and glorification of our flesh after the general resurrectiō, wherby this corruptible bodie of ours, shal put on incorruption, (as S. Paul sayeth) and of mortal 1. Cor. 15. Sap. 9. Ephe. 4. become immortal. Al this flesh (I say) of ours, that now is so combersom and aggreeueth the minde; that now is infested with so many inconueniences; subiect to so many mutations; vexed with so many diseases; defiled with so many corruptiōs; replenished with so infinit miseries and calamities: shal then be made glorious & most perfect, to endure for euer without change or mutation, and to raigne with our soule euerlastinglie. And for this purpose (as See S. Tho. 3. par. q. 82. in supple. diuines doe proue) the same shalbe endued with certaine excelles qualities and giftes from God, which S. Anselm (whom in this matter I wil folow) In l. de simi. c. 48. 49.
                  
doth reckon to be seuen; to wit, beautie, agilitie, fortitude, penetrabilitie, health, Seuen priuileges of the glorified bodies. pleasure, & perpetuitie. Al which excellencies, either doe want in the damned bodies; or else their contraries are found therin.
               And first of al, concerning the priuiledge and high excellencie of beautie, 1. Beautie. how singuler it shalbe in the bodies glorified, our Saueour him self in some part declareth, when he sayeth. At that daie shal the Iust shine as the sunne in the 
                  Mat. 13. 
                  kingdome of their father. A maruailouse speech, and in humane sense almost incredible, that our putrefied bodies should shine and become as cleare as the sunne. Whereas in the contrarie part, the bodies of the damned shal be as black and vglie, as filth it self. The second prerogatiue assigned to the bodies of the iust, is 2. Agilitie. agilitie or velocitie, whereby their flesh is deliuered from al lumpish heuinesse, wherwith it was pestered in this life, and made as light as the Angels them selues which are spirits, and doe passe from place to place with infinit swiftnesse, as also doe ascend and descend of them selues, against the nature of corruptible bodies: whereas in the meane space, the damned bodies shal be bound both hand & foote, Mat. 22. not able once to moue, as the scripture expressie noteth.
               The third gift and qualitie is supernatural strength, wherewith the glorified 3. Strength. Cap. 52. bodie shal so abound (as Anselmꝰ saieth,)

that he shal be able to moue the whole earth if he wold: and contrariwise, the damned body shal be so weake and impotent, as he shal not be able to remoue the verie wormes frome: his owne face and eyes. The fourth qualitie is penetrabilitie, or free power of passage, whereby the glorified bodie shalbe inabled, to pearse 4. Penetrabilitie. and penetrate any other bodies what soeuer; as walles, doores, the earth or firmament without any resistance, quite contrarie to the nature of a corruptible bodie. So we see that. Christs bodie glorified, Ioh. 20. after his resurrection, entered the house wher his disciples were, the dores being shut, and pearsed also the heauens at his Ascensiō. The fift rare qualitie, is most absolute health; whereby the glorified 5. Health. body shal be deliuered from al diseases & paines of this life, and from al troubles & encombrances belonging to the same; as are, eating, drinking, sleeping, and other like; and shalbe set in a most perfect and florishing state of health and freedome, neuer decayable again: whereas the damned bodie in contrarie maner, shal be filled and stuffed with innumerable diseases, paines, and torments, which no tongue of man is able to expresse.
               The sixt perfection is delite and pleasure, 6. Pleasure. wherewith the glorified bodie aboue al measure shalbe replenished; al his senses together finding now their peculier and proper obiects in much more excellencie, then euer they could in this

world. Now (I say) euerie part, sense, mē
                  ber, and ioint, shal be filled with exceeding delectation and pleasure; according as in the damned, ech part and sense shal contrariwise be afflicted and tormented. I wil alleage S. Anselmus his wordes, for that they expresse vnto vs this matter most liuelie. Al the whole glorified body Ansel. c. 5v. vbi sup. (layeth he) shal be filled with abundance of al kind of comfort; the eyes, the eares, the nose, the mouth; the hands the throte, the lungs, the hart; the stomacke, the backe, the bones, the marowe; and the very-entrales them selues, and euery part thereof, shalbe replenished with such vnspeakable swetenesse and pleasure; that truelie, it may be sayed, that the whole man is made t, drinke of the riuer of Gods diuine 
                     Psal. 35. 
                     delites, and made-dronke vvith the abundance of Gods house.
                   In contrarie wise the damned bodie, shalbe tormented in al his partes and members; euē as if you saw a man that had a burning yron thrust into his eyes, an other into his mouth, an other into his brest, an other into his ribbes, and so through al the ioints, partes, and members of his bodie. Would you not thinke him miserable, and the other man happie?
               The seuenth and last excellencie of a glorified body, is called perpetuitie or securitie 7. Perpetuitie of life, wherby it is made assured neuer to die or alter more from his felicitie; according to the saying of holie scripture, the iust shal liue for euer. And this Sap. 5. is one of the chiefest prerogatiues & most

excellent dignities of a glorified bodie, wherby al care, doubt, and feare is taken away, al danger of hurt and noyance. For if al the world should fal together vpon such a bodie; it could not hurt or harme it any thing at al: where as the damned bodie lieth alway in dying, and is subiect to the griefe of euery blow and tormēt laied vpon it, & so must remain for al eternitiē.
               Thes Al thes thinges Bun. either reiectath, or mā
                     gleth: perhap pes, as not appertainīg to the bodies of Protestā
                     tes. seuen most excellent qualities, prerogatiues, dignities, and preeminēcies, shal adorne and beautifie, or rather deifie (in a certaine sorte) the bodies of the iust in the life to come. And albeit this vniuersal happinesse be but accidental (as I haue sayed,) and nothing in deed to the essential felicitie of the Queene & mistres her self, that is our soule: yet is it a matter of no smal importance as you see, but such, as if any bodie in this life had but any one iote of the least part therof, we should esteeme it most happie. And to obtaine so much in this world, many men wold aduenture farre; whereas to get thē al together in the life to come, no man almost wil moue his fingar.
               But now to leaue this, & to come to the The 2. part of felicitie, called essen tial, pertaining to the faule. most excellēt & essential point of this felicitie, that is, to the part which pertaineth to the soule: it is to be vnderstood, that albeit there be many things that doe cōcurre in this felicitie, for the accōplishment & perfection of ful happinesse; Yet the fontaine of al is but one onelie thing, called by diuines, Visio dei beatifica, the sight

or visiō of god that maketh vs happie. Haec sola est summū bonū nostrū, sayeth S. Augustin; Aug. lib. de trin. c. 13. this onelie sight of god, is our intire happinesse. Which Christ also affirmeth, whē he sayeth to his father, this is life euerlasting, that men knovv the true god, and Iesus Christ 
                  Ioh. 17. 
                  vvhome thou hast seut. S. Paul also putteth our felicitie, in seing god, face to face. And S. Iohn, in seing god, as he is. And the reason of al this 1. Cor. 13. is, for that al the pleasures delites and cō
                  tentations Hovv the visiō of God shal make men happie. of this world, wherin mortal mē doe solace them selues, being nothing els but litle peeces & crummes of Gods incomprehensible felicitie: the same are cō
                  tained much more perfectlie and excellentlie in god him self, (from whom they are deriued,) then they are in their owne natures imparted vnto man; as also al the perfections of Gods creatures, are more fullie in him, thē in them selues. Whereof it foloweth, that who soeuer is admitted to the visiō & presence of almightie God, the Creatour and fontaine of al delites; he shal ther finde al the goodnesse and perfections of worldlie thinges compact and vnited together, and presented vnto him at once. So that whatsoeuer may delite either bodie or soule; there he shal enioye it wholie, knit vp together (as it were) in one bundle, and with the presence thereof, shal be rauished in al partes both of mind and bodie; in such sort, as he shal not be able to imagine, think, or wish for anie one ioye whatsoeuer, but there he shal finde the same in his ful perfectiō.

There he shal finde al knowledge, al wisedome, al beautie, al riches; al nobilitie, al goodnes, al pleasure, and whatsoeuer besides may deserue either loue or admiration, or woorkethanie pleasure or contentation vnto man.
               Al the powers of our mind shalbe filled with this sight, presence, and fruition of God: al the senses of our bodie shalbe God to the saued shalbe al in al. satisfied & passinglie contented with the same. God shalbe the vniuersal felicitie of al his saints; containing in him self alone al particular felicities, without end, number, or measure. He shalbe a glasse to our eyes, musike to our eares, honie to our mouthes, most swete & pleasant balme to our smel. He shalbe light to our vnderstā
                  ding, contentation to our wil, continuation of eternitie to our memorie. In him shal we enioye al the varietie of times that delite vs here: al the beautie of creatures Mug. lib. 4. de anima. ca. 15. that allure vs here: al the pleasures and ioyes that content vs here. In this vision of God (sayeth one doctor) we shal know, we shal loue, we shal reioice, we shal praise. We shal know the verie secrets and iudgements of God, which are a depth 
                     Psal. 13. Knoledge. 
                     vvithout bottome: As also, the causes, natures, beginnings, ofsprings, and ends of al creatures. We shal loue incomparablie, both God, (for the infinite causes of loue Loue. that we see in him;) and our brethren and companions as much as our selues, for that we shal see them as much loued of God as our selues, & for the same cause for which

we are loued: whereof ensueth, that our ioye shalbe without measure; both, for that we shal haue a particular ioye for euery thing we loue ī God, which are infinit: and also, for that, we shal reioice at The greatnes of ioye in heauen. the felicitie of euerie one of our brethren as much as at our owne; and by that meanes, we shal haue so many distinct felicities, as we shal haue distinct companions in our felicitie; which being without number; it is no maruaile though Christ sayed goe into the ioye of thy Lord, and not, let Mat. 25. thy Lordes ioye enter into thee: for that no one hart created, cā receaue the fulnes and greatnes of this ioye. And hereof finallie it doth insue, that we shal praise God without end or wearines, with al our hart, with al our strength, with al our powers, with al our partes; according as the scripture sayeth; Happie are they that 
                     Psal. 83. 
                     liue in they house (ô Lord) for they shal praise thee eternallie vvithout end. 
                   Hitherto this learned doctor.
               Of this most blessed visiō, sight, possession, The speech of S. Augustine touching the vision of God. Tract. 4. in ep. Ioau & cap. 36. foliloq.
                   and fruitiō of almightie God, wherunto in heauen th' elect are admitted, the learned father S. Augustine writeth thus. Our Saueour in the Gospel said vnto his Disciples, Happie are the cleane of hart, for they shal see God. By which wordes we are let to vnderstand, that ther is a sight and vision of God, which is sufficient of it self to beatifie men, and make them happie. A Mat. 5. visiō which nether eye hath seene in this world, nor eare hath heard, nor hart conceaued.

A vision (deare brethrē) that passeth 1. Cor. 3. al the beautie of earthlie things; of gold, of siluer, of woodes, of feeldes; of sea, of ayer, of sunne, of moone; of starres & of Angels: for that al thes things haue their beautie from thence. VVe shal see him face to face (saieth his Apostle) and vve shal 
                     1. Cor. 13. 
                     knovv him, as vve are knovven. That is, we shal know the power of the father, we shal know the wisdome of the sonne, we shal know the goodnes of the Holie Ghost, we shal know the indiuisible nature of the most blessed Trinitie. And this verie seing of the face of God, is the ioye of Angels, and of al other saints and celestial spirites in heauen. This is the reward of life euerlasting; this is the glorie of al blessed Cherubins; their euerlasting pleasure; their croune of honour; their game and goal of felicitie; their riche rest; their beautiful quietnes; their inward and outward consolation; their diuine paradise; their heauenlie Ierusalem; their happines of life; their fulnes of blisse; their eternal triumphe; their pretious peace of God, which passeth al vnderstāding. This sight Psal. 4. of God, is the ful beatitude, the total glorification of man and Angels; to see and behold him (I say) that made both heauen and earth; to see and behold him (deare brother) that made thee, that redemed thee, that glorified thee. For in seeing him, thou shalt know him; in knowing him, thou shalt loue him; in louing him, thou shalt possesse him; in possessing him,

thou shalt praise him; and in praising him thou shal spend thie whole eternitie. For he is the inheritance of his people; he is the possession of their felicitie; he is the reward of their expectation. I vvilbe thy 
                     Gen. 15. 
                     great revvard saieth he to Abraham. O Lord, thou art great, and therfore no marmile if thou be a great reward. The sight of thee therfore is al our hiar, al our reward, al our ioye & felicitie that we expect: seing thou hast saied, that this is life 
                     Ioh. 17. 
                     euerlasting, to see & knovv thee our true God, & Iesus Christ vvhom thou hast sent. Thus vttered S. Augustine his feeling in thes affairs.
               
               
                  AND NOVV HAVING thus declared THE. 3. part. OF circumstances increasing the ioyes of heauen. the two general partes of heauēlie felicitie, the one appertainīg to our soule, the other to our bodie: it is not hard to esteeme, what excesse of ioye both of thē ioined together, shal worke vnto vs & i vs at the most happie day of our glorificatiō. Which the forsaid holie S. Augustine conceaued and expressed in thes most zelous S. Augustines apprehensiō of the ioyes of heauen. Phil. 4. and affectuous wordes. O ioye aboue al ioyes, passing al ioyes, & without which there is no ioye; when shal I enter into thee, when shal I enioye thee, to see my God that dwelleth in thee? O euerlasting kingdome, ô kingdome of al eternitie, ô light without end, ô peace of God that passeth al vnderstāding, wherin the soules of Saintes doe rest with thee (ô Lord,) and 
                     Esa. 51. Esa. 35. 
                     euerlasting ioye is vpon their heades, and they doe possesse ioye and exultation, and al paine and sorovv is fledde from them. O how glorious

a kingdome is thine (ô Lord) wherin al Saintes doe raigne with the, adorned vvith 
                     Psal. 103. Psal. 20. 
                     light as vvith pretious apparel, and haue crovvnes of pretious stones vpon their heades? O kingdome of euerlasting blisse, where thou art present (ô Lord) the hope of al Saintes, and the diademe of their euerlasting glorie, replenishing thē with ioy on euerie side by thy blessed sight. O Lord, in this kingdom of thine, there is infinit Ioye and mirth without sadnesse; health without sorow; life without labour; light without darknesse; felicitie without abatement; al goodnes without euil. Here youth florisheth that neuer waxeth old; life that knoweth no end; beautie that neuer fadeth; loue that neuer cooleth; health that neuer diminisheth; ioye that neuer coaseth. Here sorow is neuer felt; complaint is neuer heard; matter of sadnesse is neuer seene; nor euil successe is euer feared. For that they possesse thee (ò Lord) which art the perfectiō and culme of their felicitie.Hitherto blessed Augustine.
               And now deare Christian brother, if we that liue in thes dayes and doe read 1. Of the ioiful mutatiō as a iust mās death. thes thīges, would enter in deed into thes considerations, as this holie man & other his like did; no doubt, but we should be more inflamed with the loue of this heauenlie felicitie prepared for vs, then we are; and consequentlie, should striue more to gaine it, then (alas) we doe. And to the ende thou maiest conceaue some more feeling

in the matter, cōsider but a litle withme, what a ioiful day shal that be at thy. house, when hauing liued in the feare of God, & atchiued in his seruice the end of thy peregrination; thou shalt come (by the meanes of death) to passe from miserie and labour, co life of immortalitie; and in that passage (when other men beginne to feare) thou snalt lift vp thy head in hope, Luc. 21. according to thie Saueours wordes, for that the time of thy saluation commeth on: tel me (I say) what a day of ioy shal that be vnto thee, whē thy soule stepping furth of prison, and conducted by the Angels to the tabernacle of heauen, shal be receaued there, with the honorable companies and troupes of that place? with al Ephe. 1. Colos. 1. 1. The. 1. Esa. 6. those hierarchies of blessed spirites that are mentioned in scripture: as Principalities, Powers, Vertues, Dominatiōs, Thrones, Angels, Archangels, Cherubines, and Seraphines? with the holie Apostles and Disciples of Christ; with Patriarches, Prophets. Martyrs, Virgines, Innocentes, Luc. 15. Confessors, holie Bishopes, Priestes, and other Saints of God? Al which, as they did reioice at thy conuersion from sinne: so shal they triumphe now at thy coronation and glorification. What ioye and iubilie wil thy soule receaue at that day (deare brother,) whē she shal be presented by her good Angel, in the presence of al thes princelie states, before the seat and Maiestie of the blessed Trinitie, with recital and declaration of al thy good

woorkes donne, & trauailes sustained for the loue and seruice of almightie God; when (I say) thos blessed spirites shal lay doune in that honorable consistorie, al thy vertuous actes, with their particularities; al thy almes deedes; al thy prayers; al thy fastinges; al thy innocencie of life; al thy patience in bearing iniuries, al thy constancie in aduersities, al thy temperāce in meates, and drinkes; al the vertues of thy whole life; when al (I say) shal be recounted there, al commēded, al rewarded; shalt thou not see now the value and profite of vertuous liuing? shalt thou not cōfesse now from the bottom of thy hart, that gaineful and honorable is the seruice of God? shalt thou not now be most ioiful, and blesse the hower ten thousand times, wherein first thou resoluedst thy self to leaue the slauerie of this miserable world, to serue onlie so bountiful a Lord? shalt thou not think thy self now beholden most deeply to him or her, that persuaded thee first to make this resolution? yes verily.
               But yet more then this; when thou shalt look about thee and consider into what a 
                     2. The ioye of securitie. porte and hauen of securitie thou art arriued, and shalt cast backe thin eyes vpon the daungers which thou hast passed, and wherein other men are yet in hazard: thy cause of ioye shal greatlie be encreased. For thou shalt see euidentlie now, how infinite times thou were in peril to perish in that iourney, if God had not held

his special hād ouer thee. Thou shalt now see the daungers wherin other men are; the death and damnation wherinto many of thy friends and acquaintance haue fallen; the eternal paines of hel incurred by sundry, that vsed to laugh and be merie with thee in the world. Al which shal augment the vnspeakable felicitie of this thy so fortunate a lot. And now for thy self, thou maist be secure, thou art out of al daunger for euer and euer. There is no more need now of feare, of watch, of labour, or of care. Thou maiest now lay doune al armoure, as the children of Israel Iosu. 21. 22. Gen. 3. Sap. 17. did when they came into the land of promisse; for there is no more enemie to assaile thee; there is no more wielie serpent to beguile thee: al is peace, al is rest, al is ioye, al is securitie. Good S. Paul hath no 1. Cor. 9. more need now to fast, to watch, or to punish his bodie: Good old Ierome, may Iero. cp. 22. ad Eusto. Apo. 19. now cease to afflict him self both night and day for the conquering of his spiritual enemie. Thy onelie exercise must be now to reioice and triumphe, and to sing alleluya to the Lābe, which hath brought the to this felicitie, and wil continue the therin for euerlasting eternitie.
               O dear Christian and most louing brother, what excessiue ioy and comfort wil 
                     3. The seing of Christ in glorified flesh. Mat. 2. it be at that day, to see that holie LAMBE sitting in Maiestie vpon his seate of state? If the tree wise men of the East, came so farre of, and so reioiced to see him lying in a Māger: what wil it be to see him now

triumphing in his glorie? If S. Iohn Baptist Inc. 1. did leape at his approching towardes him in his mothers wombe: what shal his presence doe in this his royal and eternal kingdome? It passeth al other ioye and glorie that Saintes haue in heauen (sayeth blessed S. Augustine) to be admitted to the Serm. 37. de sanctis. inestimable sight of Christ his face, and to receaue the beames of glorie from the splendour of his Maiestie. And if we were to suffer tormentes euerie day, yea, to tolerate the verie paines of hel for a time, therby to gaine the sight of Christ in heauen, & to be ioined in glorie to the number of his saintes: it were nothing in respect of the worthines of the reward. O that we made such accompt of this matter, as this holie and learned man did: we woulde not liue as we doe, nor loose the same for such vaine trifles, as most men in the world doe loose it dailie.
               But to goe forward yet some what further in this consideratiō. Imagine (deare 
                     4. Meetinge vvith our frindes in heauen. brother) besides al this that hitherto hath bene said, what a ioye it shal be vnto thy soule at that daye, to meet with al her godlie friendes in the kingdome of heauen; with father, with mother, with brethern, with sisters; with wife, with husband with maister, with scholers; with neigboures, with familiers, with kinred, with acquaintance: the welcomes, the mirth, the swete embracementes that shal be there; the inestimable ioy whereof, the holie ancient Martyr and most blessed

father and doctor S. Cyprian expresseth in thes wordes. Who is ther in peregrination The saving of S. Cypriā l. de mortalit. iu sine. abrod (saith he) that reioiceth not exceedinglie at the verie thought of his returne to his friendes and Contrie? O deare brethren, heauen is our Contrie; & the inhabitantes of that place, are our friendes and kinsfolk: why make we no more haste to salute and imbrace them? In heauen an infinit multitude of Bun. reiecteth here this beleefe of S. Cypriā touching Knovvledge in heauē, of fathers & mothers &c. But euerie man of reason, can put a difference betvvene a Cyprian and a Buney. our parēts, brethren, children and acquaintance doe expect vs. What a ioy wil it be, both to them and vs, to meet and imbrace and solace our selues together? how inestimable wil the delite of thos heauen lie kingdomes be, and how extreme the felicitie, wher eternitie of life shalbe voide of al feare of death?  Thus farre S. Cyprian; adding further a most vehement exhortation that we should make hast to the attaining of this meeting.
               This then shal be a most high & incomprehensible ioy: but yet further, adde to this, the most triumphant exultation that 
                     5. The dailie arriual of nevv brethrē to heauen. dailie shalbe in that place at the fresh arriual of new brethrē and sisters, comming thither frō time to time with the spoiles of their enemies, conquered & vanquished in this world. O what a cōfortable sight wil it be, to see thos seates of Angels fallen, filled vp againe with men and women of flesh, frō day to day? to see the crownes of glorie set vpon their heades; and that in al varietie, according to the infinit varietie of their combates and conquestes.

One, for martirdome or cōfession against 2. Tit. 4. Apo. 2. 3. 4. the persecutor; an other, for virginitie or chastitie against the flesh; an other, for pouertie or humilitie against the world; an other, for many conquestes together against the deuil? There the glorious quiar of Apostles, (saieth the forsaid holie Cyprian Lib. de mor tal. there the number of reioising prophets, there the innumerable multitude of holie Martirs, shal receaue the crounes of their deathes & sufferinges. There, triumphing virgines which haue ouercome cō
                     cupiscence with the strength of continencie: there, the good aulmners which haue liberallie fedd the poore, and according to our Lordes commandement, haue made ouer their earthly riches to the storehouse of heauen, shal receaue their due and peculiar reward.  O how shal vertue shew her self at this day? how shal good deedes content their doers? And among al other ioyes and contentations, this shal not be the least, to see the poore soules that come thither at a iumpe, either from the paines and miseries of this life, or frō the tormēts of the purging fire, how they shal be raushed, remaine astonished, and as it were, besides them selues, at the suddain mutation, and excessiue honour donne vnto them.
               If a poore afflicted man, that were out of his way, wandering alone in a deepe, miric, and durtie lane, in the middest of a darke and tempestuous night, farre from companie, destitute of money, beatē with

raine, terrified with thunder, stiffe with A similitude expres sing the sud den ioy of the iust after their de parture. cold, wearied out with labour, almost famished with hungre and thirst, and neare brought to despare with multitude of miseries; should vpō the suddain, in the twinkling of an eye, be taken out of that affliction, and be placed in a goodlie large and tiche palace, furnished with al kinde of cleare lightes, comfortable fire, sweete sauours, daintie meates, soft beddes, pleasant musike, delicate apparel, and honorable companie: al prepared for him alone, and al attending his comming, to receaue and imbrace him, to serue & honour him, and to annoint and croune him a king for euer: what wold this poore mā doe trow you? how wold he looke? what could he say? Surelie I think he would be able to say litle, but rather, breaking forth into teares, would for ioye remaine mute and dumme, his hart being not able to containe the suddain & exceeding greatnesse of so inestimable comfort.
               Wel then (deare brother) so shal it be, and much more with these twise happie soules, that come to heauē from the troubles of this life. For neuer was there cold shadow so pleasant in a hoate burning sunnie day; nor the welsprig to the poore trauailer in his greatest thirst of the sommer; nor the repose of an easy bedde to the wearied seruant after his labour at night: as shalbe this rest of heauen, to an afflicted soule which commeth thither. O that we could conceaue this; that we could imprint

this in our hartes; that we had a feeling The value of heauen, and th' account that old Sainctes made there of. of this that I say: wold we folow vanities as we doe? wold we neglect this matter as we doe? No doubt, but that our coldenes in purchasing these ioyes, doth procede of the smal opinion we doe cō
                  ceaue of thē. For if we made such account and estimate of this Iewel of heauenlie blisse, as other marchants before vs (more skilful and wiser then our selues) haue done: we wold bidde for it as they did, or at leastwise wold not let it passe so negligentlie, which they sought after so carefullie. S. Paul saieth of our Saue our, 
                     proposito 
                     Heb. 12. 
                     sibi gaudio sustinuit crucem; He layinge before his eyes, the ioyes of heauen, susteined the Crosse. A great estimation of the matter, which he wold buye at so deare a rate. But what counsaile geueth he to other men about the same? surelie none other, but to goe and sel al they haue, to purchase 
                  Mat. 13. 
                  this treasure. S. Paul of him self, what sayeth he? verilie, that he esteemed al the vvorld as 
                  Philip. 3. 
                  dung, in respect of the purchasing of this Iewel. S. Pauls scholar Ignatius, what Icrom. in catalogo. biddeth he? heare his own woordes. Fire, galowes, beasts, breaking of my bones, quartering of my members, crushing of my bodie, al the tormentes of the denil together; let them come vpon me, so I may enioye this treasure of heauen.  S. Augustine Ser. 31. de sanctis. that learned father, what offereth he? you haue now heard, that he would be content to suffer tormentes euery day, yea the very torments of hel it self, to gaine this

ioye. Good Lord, how farre did these holy Saints differ from vs? how contrarie were their iudgementes to ours in these affaires? who wil now maruaile of the wisdome of the world, iudged folie by God, and of the wisdome of god iudged 1. Cor. 1. 2. & 3. Psal: 4. foly by the world? Oh children of men (saieth the prophet) vvhy doe ye loue vanitie & seeke after a lie? why doe you embrace straw and contemne gold? straw (I say) & most vile chaffe, and such as finally wil set your own houses on fire, and be your ruine and eternal perdition?
               
                  BVT NOVV TO draw towardes an end in this matter (though there be no WHERunto a Christian is borne by Baptisme. end in the thing it self:) let the careful Christian consider wherunto he is borne, and where of he standeth in possibilitie, if he wil. He is borne heyre apparent to the kingdome of heauē: a kingdome without end, a kingdome void of limitatiō, a kingdome of eternal blisse, the kingdome of Gal. 3. & 4. Ephe. 1. & 5. Colos. 3. Tit. 3. Rom. 8. Iacob 2. Heb. 1. 9. 1. Pet. 1. 3 2. Pet. 3. Apoc. 1. Mat. 19. Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 6. almightie God him self: he is borne, to be ioint-heyre with Iesus Christ the sonne of God; to raigne with him; to triumph with him; to sit in Iudgement of Maiestie with him; to iudge the very Angels of heauen with him. What more glorie can be imagined, except it were to be God him self? Al the ioyes, al the riches, al the glorie that heauen containeth, shal be poured forth to make him happie. And to make this honour and triumphe yet more; the glorious Lambe that sitteth: vpon the throne of Maiestie, with his eies like fire,

his feet like burning copper, and his face Apo. 1. & 4. Luc. 12. more shining then the pretious diamant; from whos seat there procedeth thunder and lightening without end; and at whos feet the fower and twentie elders lay doune their crounes: this lambe (I say) this glorious God and man, shal rise and honour him with his own seruice. Who then would not esteeme of this royal inheritance? who would not make greater account therof then we doe, especiallie seing the gaining and winning of the same is now (by the benefit of our redemptiō and grace purchased vnto vs therin,) brought to be in our own handes? according to the expresse wordes of our Saue our, Math. 11. saying. Note that Bun. thrusteth out, as vvel thes vvordes of Christ, as thos that insuc of S. Au gustin: and therby shevveth, that he spareth th' Euāgelist no more then anciēt fathers, vvhen he mistiketh their vvritinges. Serm. 37. de sanctis.
                   
                  The kingdome of heauen doth suffer violence, & men doe lay hand-fast vpon it, by force. That is to saye, by the force of gods couenant made with Christias, that they liuing vertuouslie, shal obteine the same; whatsoeuer Christian doth perfourme this vertuous life, taketh heauen (as it were) by force and by violence. The matter is put in the povver of the doer (sayeth S. Augustin) for that the kingdome of heauen suffereth violence. This thing (ò man) that is, the kingdome of heauen, requireth no other price but thy selfe it is so much vvoorth as thou art vvoorth: geue thy self, and thou shalt haue it. By which he signifieth, that euery man, how poore or needie soeuer he be in this world, may gaine this inheritance to him self; may make himself a prince, a king, a Monarch, if he wil: euen the meanest and miserabl est

man I say vpon earth. O most wonderful bountie and liberalitie of our Saueour; ô princelie hart and vnspeakable mercie: ô incredible prodigalitie (in a certaine maner so to say,) of treasures so inestimable, as are the most infinite and endlesse riches of heauen.
               Tel me now, gentle reader and most louing and deare brother, why wilt thou The buying of heauen. not accept of this offer of thie Saueour? why wilt thou not account of this his kingdome? why wilt thou not buye this endles glorie of him, for so litle a labour as he requireth for it? Hear how earnestly he persuadeth thee to bargaine with him: 
                     Apoc. 3. 
                     Suadco tibi emere a me (saith Christ) aurū ignitum, probatum, vt locuples sias. I doe giue thee counsaile, to buye of me pure and tried gold, to th' end thou maiest be riche. Why wilt thou not folow this counsaile (deare brother?) especiallie of a marchant that meaneth not to deceaue thee? Nothing can greeue this thie Saue our more, Exo. 5. then that men wil seek with such paines, to buy straw and chaffe in Egipt, wheras he wold sel vnto thē fine gold at a lower price: and that they wil needes purchase pudle water, with more labour and cost, Icre. 2. Apo. 21. thē he wold require for ten times so much pure liquour, out of the verie fontaine of life it self. There is not the wickedst man that liueth in the world, but taketh more trauaile in gaining hel, (as after more largelie shal be declared) then doth the most painful seruant of God in purchasing

of heauen and eternal blisse. O folie, ô madnes.
               Follow not then (ô thou careful Christian) The folie of seeking vvorldlie vanities. this fanatical frensie of earthelie wisdome; make not thie self partaker of their errour. For the day wil come, when thou shalt see them doe heauie penance for their sollie, at what time thie hart shal be right ioiful that thou hadst neuer any part or portion amōg them. Let them goe now and bestow their time, in transitorie vanities, in finful pleasures and delites of this world; let them build now their pleasant palaces; let them purchase dignities, scrape peeces & paches of earth and ground together: let them hunt after honours and frame castels in the aier: the time wil come ere long (if thou belieue Christ him self) wherin thou shalt haue Luc. 6. Luc. 12. Math. 26. sinal cause to enuie their felicitie. If they doe imagin and talke baselie now of the glorie and riches of God and of his Saintes in heauen; not esteeming them in deed, in respect of their owne, or contemning them rather, for that carnal pleasures are not reconed therin: doe thou make litle account of their wordes; for that the sensual 
                  1. Cor. 2. Ep. lad. A similitude.
                   
                  man vnderstandeth not the things vvhich are of God. If horses were promised by their maisters a good feast and banquet, most euident it is that they could imagin nothing els, but prouander and water to be their best cheere, for that they haue no knowledge of daintier dishes: so fareth it with thes men who being accustomed

only to the pudle of fleshlie pleasures; can mount with their mindes to no higher thig thē brutish sensualitie. But I haue shewed to thee before (gentle reader) some waies and considerations, to conceaue greater matters; albeit as I haue aduertised the often, we must confesse stil, with S. Paul, that no humane hart can conceaue 1. Cor. 2. the least parte therof. For which cause alse, it is not vnlike that S. Paul him self 2. Co. 12. was forbidden to vtter the things which he had seene and heard, in his most wonderful miraculous assumption vnto the third heauen.
               Wherfore to conclude at length this whole chapter; thou hast to consider my The cōclusion vvith th' application of al that hath bene said. deare and louing brother, that this greate Game and Goale of heauēlie blisse, which hitherto I haue endeuoured to describe vnto thee, is set vp onlie for them that wil runne vnto it, as S. Paul wel noteth: and no man is crouned in this glorie, but such onelie as wil fight for it, according as the same. Apostle doth teach and forwarne 1. Cor. 6. Phil. 3. 2. Tim. 2. 1. Ti. 6. Heb. 12. Mat. 7. 19 25. vs. It is not euerie one that saieth to Christ, Lord Lord, shal enter into the kingdome of heauen: but they onelie which shal doe the wil of Christs eternal father that is in heauen. Albeit this kingdome of Christ be set out to al men, yet euerie man shal not arriue to raigne with Christ, but such onelie as shal be content Rom. 8. Mat. 11. to suffer with Christ. Though the kingdome of heauen be subject to violence: Apo. 14. & 20. (as hath bene said,) yet no man can enter

there by force, but he onelie whose good deedes shal follow him to make open the gates: that is; except he enter (as the prophet Psal. 14. saith) vvithout spot, and haue vvroght iustice. My meaning thē is, that as I haue shewed, the exceeding greatnes and worthines of this treasure (gentle reader:) so thou being a Christian shouldest also conceaue the right way of gaining the same; which is no other by the testimonie of Christ him self, but onelie by holie and vertuous life, in keping his commandemētes. Thou art therfore to sit doune & consider, (according Math. 7. & 19. Ioh. 14. Luc. 14. to thy Saueours counsaile,) what thou wilt doe and determine herin; whether thou haue so much spiritual money, as is sufficient to build this tower, and to make this heauenlie warre, or no: that is; whether thou haue so much good wil and holie manhood in thee, as to bestow the paines of a vertuous life, (if it be rather to be called paines then pleasure,) required for the gaining of this eternal kingdome. This is the question, this is the principal The final end of al that hath bene said. pointe, this is the verie whole issue of al the matter; and hitherto hath appertained whatsoeuer hath bene spoken in this booke before, either of thy Creatour and creation, of thie particular end; or of the Maiestie, bountie, and iustice of thie God and Saueour: as also of the account he wil demand of thee; and of the punishment or rewardes laid vp for the life to come. Al this (I say) hath bene meant by me to this onelie end and purpose, that

thou (measuring the one part and the other,) shouldest finallie resolue thie self what thou wouldest doe, and not to passe ouer thy time in careles negligence, as manie are accustomed to doe, neuer espiing their own errours vntil it be to late to amend them.
               For the loue of God then (deare Christian An exhortation. brother) and for the loue thou bearest to thy own soule & eternal welfare, shake of this most dangerous securitie, wherin flesh and blood is wont to lulle the careles people of this world; make some earnest resolution, for looking to thy state in the life to come. Recalle to mind oftentimes that worthie sentence; Hoc momentum, vnde pendet aeternitas: This life A saying to be remembred. is the momēt, wherof dependeth al eternitie of weal or woe hereafter. If it be but a moment (deare brother) and yet a moment of so great consequence and importance: how is it passed ouer by earthelie men with so litle care, and cogitation? what reason may be alleaged of this so dangerous a negligence? what cause may be assigned, of so extreme a follie? Al the creatures of earth, heauen, and hel, euen from the very first to the last, if thou examine them al, may be argumentes and motiues vnto thee, to leaue this perilous course wherin thou art: al are or may be bookes lessons and sermōs vnto thee, preaching and protesting, (some by their punishment, some by their glorie, some by their beautie, and al by their creation,)

that thou oughtest without delay, to make resolution of an other kinde of life; and that al is vanitie, al is folie, al is iniquitie, al is miserie, besides the onelie seruice of thie Lord and maker. And so with this, wil I make here an ende of this first part, reseruing some other things to be spoken in the second; for remouing of such impedimēts, as our spiritual aduersarie is wont to cast against this good worke of Resolution, as against the first step and degree of our saluation.
               Our Lord God & Sauiour Iesus Christ, who was content to paye his own pretious blood for the purchasing of this noble inheritance of his kingdome vnto vs; geue vs his holy grace, to esteeme of it, as the great weight of the matter requireth, and not by negligence to loose our title and portion therin.
               The end of the first part, containing motiues to resolution.

For so it fareth, that when he seeth by the former reasons and demonstrations alleaged, that the iudgement of man is conuinced in the pointes which are treated, and that it can no longer resist or deny, but that the onlie true wisdome were in deed, to breake of from the vanities and sinful life of this world, and to be-take our selues to the gainful

Read then this parte also (deare Christian brother) vvith no lesse diligence then the former; for that the profit therof shal be equal, and thy contentement perhapes farre greater; in respect of the varietie of matters handled therin, and of the manifold comfortes which thy soule in perufing shal receaue therby.
            
            
               
               OF THE FIRST IMPEDIMENT THAT IS WONT TO LET SINNERS from resolution. VVhich is, the mistrust and diffidence in Gods mercie, through the multitude and grieuousnes of their offences. CHAPT. I.
               AMONG al other gricuous and most perilous cogitatiōs, which in this world are accustomed to offer them selues to a mind entangled and lode with great sinnes; this vsually is the first, (thorough the nature of sinne it self Dispaire an ordinarie temptations to the greatest sinners. and craftie suggestion of our ghostly enemie;) to fal into distrust and despaire of Gods mercie. Such was the cogitation of most vnhappie Cain, one of the first inhabitantes of mankind vpon earth; who after the murther of his owne only brother, and other sinnes by him committed; brust furth into that horrible and desperate Caini.
                  
speech, so greatly offensiue to his Lord and Maker, mine iniquitie is greater, then 
                  Gen. 4. 
                  that I may hope for pardon. Such was in like maner, the desperate conceit of wicked Iudas, one of the first of them that were Iudas. chosen to the peculiar seruice of our Redeemer; who feeling his conscience oppressed with manifold enormous iniquities, and most of al with the prodition of his owne Lord & maister: tooke no other ware of amendment or redresse, but to destroie him self both in bodie and soule; adioining only thos words ful of miserable distrust and desperation; I haue sinned in 
                  Mat. 27. 
                  betraying the innocent and iust blood. By which wordes and most wreched ende, he more grieuouslie offended and iniuried his most louing & merciful Saueour, then by al his former iniquities committed against him.
               This then (most louing brother,) is the first and greatest rocke, wherat a sinful The ship vvrak of soules ouerloded vvith sinnes. soule ouerburdened with the charge of her owne iniquities, and tossed in the waues of dredful cogitations by the blastes and stormes of Gods threats against sinners, doth commonlie make her shipwrake. This is that most horrible depth and dungeon, wher of the holie Scripture saieth, The impious man, vvhen he is come into 
                  Prou. 18. 
                  the botome and prosonditie of his sinnes, contemneth al. This is that remediles sore and incurable wound wherwith God him self charged Ierusalem when he said; Insanabilis fractura tua; Thy rupture is irremediable. Iere. 3. And the Prophet Michaeas considering

the same people, thorough the multitude of their wickednes to eneline now to despaire of Gods goodnes towards them; brake forth into this most pitiful complaint; for this vvil I vveepe and lament extremely; I vvil strippe of my clothes, and vvander 
                  Mich. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . 
                  naked; I vvil rore like vnto Dragons, and sound out my sorovve as Strutbious in the desert, for that the vvound and maladie of my people is desperate.
               
               This is that great and maine impediment that stoppeth the conduits of Gods The miserie of desperation. holie grace, from flowing into the soule of a sinful man. This is the knif that cutteth in sunder al thos heauely blessed cordes, wherwith our sweet Lord and Saneour endeuoureth to draw vnto repentance the hartes of sinners, saing by his prophete, I vvil pul them vnto me vvith the chaines of loue and charitie. For by this meanes Osee 11. euery sinful conscience commeth to answere almightie God, as did Ierusalem, when being admonished of her sinnes, & exhorted by his prophet to amendment of life; she said: Desperaui, nequaquam faciam; I ame become desperate; I wil neuer Iere. 2. thincke of any such thing. To which lamentable estate, when a sinful man is once arriued; the next steppe he maketh, is, (for auoiding al remorse and trouble of consciēce;) to engulfe him self into the depth of al detestable enormities, and to abandone his soule to the verie sincke of al filth and abhominations; according as S. Paul said of the Gentiles in like case; that
                  
                  by despaire they deliuered them selues ouer to dis 
                  Ephe. 4. 
                  solute life, therby to commit al maner of vncleanes.
               
               Which wicked resolution of the impious, is the thing (as I haue noted before) that most of al other offences vpon earth, doth exasperate the ire of Almighty God, depriuing his deuine Maiestie of The thing vvherin God most deliteth, is mercie. that most excellent propertie, wherin he cheifly deliteth and glorieth, which is, his infinite and vnspeacable mercie. This might be declared by diuers and sondrie examples of holy writt; how be it, two only shal suffice for this present. The first is of the people of Israel not long before their banishment to Babilon; who being threatned from God by the Prophet Ieremie, that manifold punishments were imminent ouer their heads, for their grieuous sinnes committed against his Maiestie: begāne (in stead of repentance) to fal to desperation, and consequently, resolued to take that impious course of al dissolute life, alleaged before out of S. Paul; for thus they answered God exhorting them by his threats to reforme their wicked liues. VVe are novv grovven desperate; & therfore vve vvil hereafter folovve our ovvne 
                  A desperat resolution. 
                  cogitations, and euerie one sulfil the vvickednes of his ovvne conceite. Wherat God stormed infinitely, and brake forth into this vehement Pere. 18. interrogation: 
                     Interrogate Gentes; quit audiuit talia horribilia?  Aske and enquire of the verie Gentiles, whether euer among them were heard any such horrible blasphemies.
                  
And after this, for more declaration of this intollerable iniurie herin offerred to his Maiestie: he commaunded the Prophet Ieremie to goe forth of his owne house; and to get him to a potters shope, which in the village was framing his vessels vpon the wheele. Which Ieremie hauing done; he sawe befor his face a pot crushed and broken by the potter al in peeces vpō the wheele; and thincking therby that the vessel had bene vtterly vnprofitable and to be cast away: he saw the same clay ptesently framed agayne by A maruelous exāple of Gods cleinencie. the potter, into a new vessel more excellent then before. Wherat he maruailing; God said vnto him: Doest not thou thinck (Ieremie) that I can doe with the house of Israel, as this potter hath done with his vessel? Or is not the house of Israel in my handes, as the clay is in the handes of this craftesman? I wil denounce vpon the sodaine against a Nation and kingdome, that I wil roote it vp and destroye it; and if that nation or kingdome doe repent from their wickednes, I also wil repent me of the punishment which I intended to laie vpon them. And then he proceedeth foreward, declaring vnto Ieremie the exceeding greif and indignation which he conceaueth, that any sinner what soeuer, should despaire of mercie & pardon at his hands.
               The second example is of the same people of Israel during the time of their banishment in Babilon, at what time being

afflicted with many miseries for their sinnes, An other example of Godes vvō
                     derful mercie. and threatned with many more to come, for that they changed not the course of their former wicked conuersation: they beganne to despaire of Gods mercie, and to saie to the Prophet Ezechiel that liued banished among them, & exhorted them to amendment vpon assured hope of Gods fauour towards them; Our iniquities and sinnes doe lye greeuouslie vpon vs, and vve languish in them, and vvhat hope of 
                  Eze. 33. 
                  life then may vve haue? At which cogitation and speech God being greatly moued; appeared presently to Ezechiel & said vnto him; Tel this people; I doe liue saieth the Lord God of hostes, I vvishe not the death of the impious, but rather that he should turne from his vvicked vvaies and liue. VVhy vvil the house of Israel die in their sinnes, rather then turne vnto me? And then he maketh a large and vehement protestation, that how greuously soeuer any person shal offend him, & how great punishments soeuer he shal denounce against him; yea, if he had giuen expresse sentence of death and damnation vpon him: yet, Si egerit paenitentiam a peccato suo, secerit
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      iudicium & iustitiam; that is; if he repent him self of his sinne, and exercise Iudgment and iustice to be vsed in true repentance; that is, iudgment vpon our selues, and iustice tovvardes others. iudgement and iustice for the time to come; al his sinnes that he hath committed shalbe forgiuen him (saieth almightie God) for that he hath done iudgment and Iustice.
               
               And this now might be sufficient, (albeit nothing els were spoken) for remouing this first obstacle and impediment of

true resolution, which is the dispaire of Gods infinite goodnes and mercie. Neuertheles, for more euident clearing and demonstration of this matter; and for the greater comfort of such as feele them selues burdened with the heauy weight of their iniquities committed against his deuine Maiestie: I haue thought expedient in this place to declare more at large, this aboundant subiect of Gods endles mercie, towards al such as wil truly turne vnto him; in what time, state, condition or age Fovver partes of this chapter. soeuer in this life: which shalbe shewed and set doune by thes foure points and partes that doe ensue.
               
                  FIRST OF AL, by the infinite and THE. 1. part. TOVCHING. the loue that God: beareth tovvardes man. incomprehēsible loue that almightie God beareth vnto man; which loue is alwaies the mother of fauour, grace, and mercie. If you demaund of me in what sort I doe proue that the loue of God is so exceeding great towardes man: I answere as the Cosmographer is wont to doe, who by the greatnes and multitude of the streames and riuers, doth frame a coniecture of the fountaine frō which they flowe. The proper riuers which are deriued and doe ronne forth of loue, are good turnes and benefites; which seing they are infinite endles and inestimable, bestowed by God vpon man, (as in place before hath bene declared, and the whole vniuersal frame of this world doth aboundantly beare witnesse;) it foloweth most euidently, that the origine, fountaine, & welspring

of al thes fauours, graces, and good turnes; must needs be infinite, immeasurable, and farre surpassing al compasse of mans vnderstanding.
               If you require of me the cause and reason, why almightie God should so wonderfully be affected towards man; I can directly yeld you none at al, but rather meruaile therat with holy Iob, why so soueraine a Maiestie should set his hart Iob. 7. vpon so base a subiect. Notwithstanding, the holy Scripture seemeth to alleage one principal reason of this loue, when it saieth; Nihil odistieorum quae secisti, & parcis omnibus, 
                  Sap. 11. 
                  quia tua sunt, Domine, quidiligis animas. 
                  That is; Thou (O Lord) which louest soules, canst not hate thos thinges which thou hast made, but doest vse mercy towards al, for that they are thine.  And the like maner of reasoning vseth God 1. The first cause vvhie God loueth vs, for that he is our Creator & vve are his ovvne vvorkes. Ezec. 18. him self when he saieth by his Prophet Ezechiel; behould, al soules are mine: and hereupon he inferreth a litle after; Numquid voluntatis meae est mors impij: Can I haue the wil to damne a wicked man, seing that his soule is mine, created and redeemed by me? as who would saie, this were a case against al order and equitie. And the reason of this maner of speech and argument is, for that euery man naturally is enclined to loue the things that be of his owne making. So we see that if a mā haue an orchard wherin be great varietie of trees and plantes, yet if ther be but one of his owne peculier grafting that florisheth

and prospereth wel; he taketh more delite therin, then in any of the rest, for that it is his owne workemanship. So in Euerie man giuē to loue his ovvne. like maner if a man haue a vineyard of his owne planting and trimming. For which respect, the holy prophet Dauid, finding him self and the whole kingdome of Iurie in great affliction & calamitie: thought no other means so forcible to draw God to compassion and commiseratiō of their case, as to crie out to him in this maner; Thou vvhich gouernest Israel, looke tovvards vs 
                  Psal. 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   
                  and be attēt: Thou hast brought forth a vineyard out of Egipt, thou hast purged the same from Gentiles, and hast planted it. Thou ô God of al povver, turne tovvards vs, looke vpon vs from heauen, and visite this thy vineyard vvhich thy ovvne right hand hath planted. The like maner of persuasion vsed the holy prophet Esaie to moue God when he said; looke vpō
                   
                  Esa. 
                  vs I beseech the (ô Lord) vvhich are the vvorke of thine ovvne hands.
               
               But aboue al other, the blessed man Iob standeth, as it were, in argument and disputation Iob. 1. with God about this matter, saying; haue not thy hāds made me? haue they The confidēce of Iob in that God had made him. not framed me of clay and earth? hast not thou compacted me as cheese is made of milke? hast not thou knit my bones and sinowes together, and couered my flesh with skinne? hast not thou giuen me life, and conserued my spirite with thy continual protection? how soeuer thou seme to dissemble thes matters and hide them in thy hart; yet I know that thou remēbrest

them al, and are not vnmindful of them. By which words this holy man signified, that albeit God suffered him greatly to be tempted and afflicted in this life, so farre forth, as he might seme to haue forgotten him: yet was he wel assured that his deuine Maiestie could not of his goodnes forsake or despise him, for that he was his creature and the proper workemanship of his owne hands. In which verie name of vvorkemanship, holy Dauid tooke such great comfort, considering that the workeman can not chuse but be louing and fauourable towards his owne work, (especially so excellent and bountiful a workeman as is almightie God, towards a worke made as mā is, to his owne shape and likenes:) that in al his necessities, yea euen in his greatest infirmities of flesh, and most grieuous offenses committed against his Maiestie, he conceaueth most assured Th' assured hope Dauid had in that he vvas Gods vvork manship. hope of mercie and pardon, vpon this cō
                  sideratiō, that he was his workemanship; and consequentlie, wel knowen to his deuine wisdome, of how bricle & infirme a metal he was made. For thus at one time among other, he reasoneth of this matter. Looke how farre distant the east is from Psal. 102. the west; so farre of hath God remoued our iniquities from vs. Euen as a father doth take compassion of his owne children; so doth our Lord take mercie vpon vs: for that he wel knoweth the mould wherof we are made, and doth remember that we are nothing els but dust.
               
               
                  
In which discourse the holie Prophet maketh mention of two thinges, that did assure him of Godes mercie; th' one, that God was his Creator and maker, and therby priuie to the frailtie of his constitution & nature: th' other that he was his father, whos propertie is to haue compassion on his children; and this is a second reason, more strong and forcible perhappes then the former, whie euerie man The second reason of assurance of Gods loue, for that he is our Father. maie be most assured of pardon that hartely turneth vnto almightie God; considering that it hath pleased his deuine Maiestie, not only to be vnto man a creatour (as he is to al other thinges;) but also a father, which is the title of the greatest loue and coniunction, that nature hath left to thinges in this world. Wherof a certaine philosopher said wel; that no mā could conceaue the loue of a parents hart, but he onlie that had a child of his owne. For which respect, our Sauiour IESVS to put vs in mind of this most feruent loue; and therby as it were, by one fire to enkendle an other within our hartes; did vse often times and ordinarily, to repeat this Mat. 5. 6. 8. &c. sweet name of Father in his speeches to his folowers, and therupon founded diuers most excellent and comfortable dissourses; as at one time, when he dehorted them from ouer much care and worldlie solicitude: he addeth this reason; Your father 
                  Math. 6. 
                  in heauen knovveth that you haue need of thes thinges: as who would saie, he knowīg your wantes and being your father; you

shal not need to trouble yourselues with too great anxietie in thes matters, for that a fathers hart can not but be prouidēt and careful for his children. The like deduction maketh he in the same place, to the same effect, by comparison of the birdes of the aire and other- irreasonable creatures; for which, if God doe make (saith he) so aboundant prouision, as al the whole world may witnesse that he doth: much more careful wil he be to prouide for men that are his owne children, which are more deare vnto him then any other terrestrial thing created.
               Al which speeches and reasons of our Sauiour, are deriued from the nature and propertie of a parent, which can not but affect and loue his children; especially such a father whom Christ calleth celestial, who in this perfection of true father ly VVhat a father God is. loue, so farre exceedeth al earthly parents put together; as in power, clemencie and goodnes, almightie God surpasseth the infirmitie of his feeble creatures. Such a father, as hath not only geuen life and being vnto his childrē; but also (as S. Paul Gal. 4. saieth) hath powred into their hartes the deuine spirite of his only eternal sonne, stirring them vp to most assured confidence and inuincible hope, in his fatherly goodnes and protection. And vpon assurance of this hope haue aswel sinners as Saints from the beginning, fled vnto him confidently vnder this title of paternitie, and neuer were deceaued. So the prophet

Esaie aswel in his owne name, as in the name of the sinful people of Israel, doubted not to crie. Thou art our father; Abraham 
                  Esa. 63. 
                  hath not knovven vs, and Israel is ignorant of vs: Thou, o Lord, art our father, thou art our redeemer. And to cōfirme this assurance vnto vs, Christ sent that most sweet and comfortable Christes cō
                     fortable em bassage. Ioan. 20. embassage vnto his disciples, presentlie vpon his resurrection; Goe and tel my brethren, that I doe ascend vnto my father and vnto your father; vnto my God, and vnto your God. By which two wordes of Father and God, the one of loue, and th' other of power; the one of wil, the other of abilitie: he tooke away al doubt of not speeding, from each man that should make recourse to this merciful Lord and Father.
               God him self also after many threates vsed by the prophet Ieremie against the people of Israel for their sinnes, in the end, lest they should dispaire, turneth about his talke, and changeth his stile, assuring them of many graces and fauours, Hovv greatlie the respect of a father moueth God. Iere. 31. if they would returne vnto him; telling the house of Israel, that he had loued her from the beginning, and had sought to draw her vnto him by threates, to the end he might take mercy vpon her: and that now he intended to build her vp againe, to adorne her with ioy and exultation, to gather her children from al corners of the earth; to refresh them with the waters and riuers of life, & al this (saith he,) quia factus sum Israeli pater; for that I am become now a Father to Israel. And in the

same place to wicked Ephraim (the head citie of the rebellious kingdome of Samaria) he saith; Ephraim is become my honorable sonne, my delicate and dearely beloued child; 
                  Iere. 31. 
                  therefore my bovvels are moued vvith compassion vpon him, and in abundance of mercy vvil I take pitie of him. So much attributed God to this respect of being a father vnto Israel and Ephraim, and of their being his children; that for this cause only (notwithstanding their infinit enormous sinnes) his bowelles of endles mercie were moued with loue and compassion towardes them.
               And thes are thos tender merciful bowelles, which holie Zacharie father to Luc. 1. S. Iohn Baptist, protesteth to be in almightie God towardes mankind that had offended him. Thes are thos which were vo. 16. in that good old father mentioned in the Gospel, who being not only offended but

By which parable our Saueour IESVS endeuored to set forth vnto vs, the incomprehensible mercie of his heauenly Father towardes sinners: in which respect he is truely called by his Apostle pater misericordiarum, the father of mercies. For 2. Cor. 1. that (as S. Bernard wel noteth) this sea & Oceā of mercies, doth flow peculiarly frō the hart of a father, which can not be said Ber. ser. 5. de natal. so properly of the gulfe and depth of his iudgementes. For which cause he is called Psal. 35. in Scripture the God of iustice and reuēge, and not the Father. And finally this blessed VVhat the name of Fa ther doth import. name of father in God, doth import vnto vs by Godes owne testimonie, al sweetenes, al loue, al frendship, al comfort; al satherly prouidēce, care, and protection; al certaintie of fauour, al assurance of grace, al securitie of mercie, pardon, and remission of our sinnes, whensoeuer vnfainedly we turne vnto him. And in this point his diuine Maiestie is so foreward and vehement, to geue vs assurance; that being not content to set forth his loue vnto vs by the loue of a fathers hart; he goeth further, and protesteth vnto vs that his hart is more tēder towardes vs in this behalf, then the hart of any mother can be to the only child and infant of her own wombe. For thus he saith to Sion, which for her sinnes, begā to doubt least he had forsaken her: Can the mother

                  vvritten thee in the flesh of my ovvne handes. And this, for so much as God is called our Father.
               Ther remaineth yet a third consideration, which more setteth forth Gods inestimable The. 3. argument of Gods loue, the geeuing in's sonne for vs. loue, then any of the other demonstrations before handled. And this is, that he gaue the life and blood of his only begotten and eternal sonne for purchasing and redeeming vs when wee were lost; a price so infinite and inexplicable, as (no doubt) his diuine wisdome would neuer haue giuen, but for a thing which he had loued aboue al measure. Which our Sauiour him self that was to make the paiment, doth plainly signifie; and therfore also seemeth, as it were, to wonder at such a bargaine, when he saieth in the Ghosple; So dearly hath God (my father) loued the 
                  Ioh. 3. 
                  vvorld, that he hath giuen for it his only begotten sonne. In which wordes he ascribeth this most wōderful dealing of his father; vnto the vehemencie and exceeding aboundāce of loue; as doth also his dearest disciple and Apostle S. Sohn, saing; In this appeareth 1. Ioa. 4. the great loue and charitie of God towards vs, that he hath sent his only begotten sonne into the world to purchase life for vs. In this (I saie) is made euident his exceeding charitie, that we not louing him, he loued vs first; and gaue his owne sonne to be a ransome for our sinnes. Christ vvas geuen for loue. 
                  Wherunto also the holie Apostle S. Paul agreeth, admiring in like maner the excessiue loue of God in thes wordes; God Rom. 5.
                     
doth maruailouslie commend and set forth, his great loue vnto vs, in that we being yet sinners, he gaue his sonne to the death for our redemption. And in an other place framing out, as at were, a measure of Gods mercie by this aboundance of his loue; Ephe. 2. faieth thus. God who is rich in mercie, thorough the exceeding loue which he bore vnto vs, we being dead in sinne, he reuiued vs in Christ, and raised vs vp euen vnto heauen, making vs to sitte doune ther with him, to the ende he might declare to al ages and worldes ensuing, the most abundant riches of his grace and goodnes towards vs.
               
               This was the opinion of that noble Apostle S. Paul, and of al his coequals, Apostles Euangelistes Disciples & Saints; that this worke of our redemption proceeded only from the inflamed fornace of Gods immeasurable loue. And therfore to The cōclusion of this point made by S. Paul. Tit. 3. make no other conclusion her of then that which S. Paul him self doth make: If God haue not spared his owne proper & only begotten soone, but hath geuen him vp to death for gaining vs vnto him: how can it be, that with him he hath not geuen vnto vs al other thinges? If when we were his enemies and thought not vpon him, he Rom. 5. sent to seeke vs so diligently; by such a messinger as he loued so dearly; allowing him to laie doune a price for vs which he so infinitely esteemed: what shal we thincke that he wil doe vnto vs now; (we being made his owne by our redemption,)

if we returne willingly vnto him; whē onr receauing shal cost him nothing els, but only a merciful looke vpon vs; which is not so much from the infinite bowels of his botomeles mercie, as is one droppe of water from the most huge gulfe of the maine Ocean sea. And this shal suffice for this first point of Gods loue, declared vnro vs, by the three most sweete and comfortable names & respectes, of Creator, Father, and Redeemer.
               
                  NEXT AFTER VVHICH we are to consider in what maner God is accustomed THE. 2. part. to expresse and declare this loue of Hovv God expresseth his loue tovvardes sinners. his, in his dealings & proceedīgs towards sinners. And first of al the wise man (hauing had long experience of this matter,) beginneth to describe and set it forth in this sort, saing vnto God himself: Thou (O 
                  Cap. 11. 
                  Lord) doest dissemble the sinnes of men to geue vnto thē time of repentance. And thē when they wil not vse this benefite of his forbearing, but wil needs enforce him to punish and correct them; he saieth further of this correction: Such as vvilfully doe runne astraie 
                  Cap. 12. 
                  (O Lord) and vvil not turne vnto the; thou doest correct thē svveetly by litle & litle, admonishing and exhorting them to leaue their sinnes and to beleeue in thee. Thes two pointes then of exceeding clemencie, by the testimonie of the wise man, are found in almightie God: Tvvo rare pointes of 
                        〈◊〉
                      in God. first, to winke at the wicked life of men, and to expect their conuersion with inspeakable patience and longanimitie, according as also the Prophet Esay beareth

witnes, adioining the cause therof in thes wordes, Your Lord doth attēd your conuersion, to the end he may take mercie on you, and therby be 
                  Esa. 30. 
                  exalted. And secondlie, for the same respect when he is enforced by reason of his Iustice, to chastice them; yet doth he the same with such moderation and mildnes, as alwaies in this life he reserueth place of pardon.
               And to thes two we may adioine yet a third propertie of his mercie, more admirable (perhaps) then the former; which Tertul. in Apol. ca. 2. is, (as Tertulian excellently noteth,) that he being the partie offended, yet first and principally desireth reconsiliation; he hauing receaued the wrong and iniurie, yet doth he most busely entreate for amitie & attonment. And wheras in al right and God that is offended, seeketh attonment vvith vs. equitie he might denie vs pardon, and for his power take reuenge of vs at his pleasure: yet doth he not only offer vs peace of his owne accord; but also sueth vnto vs by al means possible to accept therof, humbling (in a certaine maner) his deuine Maiestie to our basenes and vilitie; and behauing him self in this respect, as a prince that were inamoured of his bondslaue and abiect seruant.
               This might be declared by many of his owne speeches and doinges in holy Scripture; but one place out of the Prophete Esaie shal serue for al: wher almightie God so earnestly wooeth the conuersion of Ierusalem, as no louer in the world could vtter more signes and testimonies of

a hart inflamed and set on fire with loue, then he doth towards that citie which so highly had offended him. For first after Gods vvooing of Hierusalem. many threats poured out against her, if she did not returne; lest she might perhapps fal into despaire; he maketh this protestatiō in the beginning of his speech: Indignatio non est mihi &c. Angrie I ame not (ò Hierusalem,) but what soeuer I haue 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     . 27. spoken, I haue spoken of good wil and loue. Secondlie, he entreth into this dispute His protestation. and doubt with him self about punishing her for her sinnes; what shal I doe? Shal I tread her vnder my feete and put her to the fiar? or els vvil she staie my puissant hand and 
                  His cunctation. 
                  make peace vvith me, vvil she (I saie) make attonment vvith me? After which doubt and cunctation; he resolueth him self to chāge his maner of stile, and to fal a litle to chide with her, and then saith: harken O yee deafe inhabitants of Ierusalem; looke aboute you, ye blind 
                  His chiding 
                  folke that vvil not see: vvho is blind and deafe but my seruant, that vvil not regard or listen to the messingers vvhich I send? O thou vvhich hast opē eares, vvilt thou not heare? And then a litle after, he beginneth to smooth and speake faire againe, saing: Euer since thou hast bene 
                  His faire speech. 
                  gratious & glorious in mine eyes, I haue loued the; and for thy soule vvil I yeue vvhole natiōs. Feare not, for that I ame vvith the. Wherwith she being litle or nothing mooued, he returneth to a sweet maner of complaint, saing: Thou hast enthralled me by thy sinnes, and vvith 
                  His complaint. 
                  thine iniquities thou hast greatly afflicted me. Which being said, and she somewhat

wonne therby to loue him, as it seemeth: he turneth vnto her with this most comfortable and kind speech; I ame he, I ame he, vvhich cancelleth thine iniquities for mine ovvne 
                  His kind speech. 
                  sake, and vvil neuer thincke any more vpon thy sinnes.
               
               Al which being done, and they now reconciled, and made fast frends together: his diuine Maiestie beginneth a verie louing conference (as it were) and sweet expostulation with her, saing in thes wordes: Cai thou to memorie the things that are 
                  His conference. 
                  past, and let vs iudge our selues here together. Tel me if thou haue any thing vvherby thou maiest be iustefied. Thy first parent vvas a sinner &c. Wherat she being ashamed, and hauing nothing in the world to answere for her self: almightie God comforteth her, and knitteth vp the whole matter in this most His svveet conclusion. kind and amiable sort.  Feare not, for I wil power out my spirite vpon the and vpon thy seed, and my benediction shal be vpō thine ofspring; thy children shal budde vp and florish as willoes planted by the water side; Thus saieth the Lord and king of Israel, the Lord of hostes that is thy redeemer; I ame the first and the last, and besides me ther is no other God. Be mindful of this thou house of Iacob, I haue dissolued and dissipated thy sinnes, as a cloud is dissolued in the aire; be mindful of this and haue an assured confidence. Thus farre continueth the treatie betwene God and his citie of Ierusalem.
               And now tel me (deare Christian brother)

whether it be possible for any hart A consideration vpon the former treatie of God vvith Hierusalē. or tongue in the world, to conceaue or expresse more waies or significations of most vehement good wil and burning affection, then of Gods part in this treatie hath bene declared? What louer or enamoured person vpon earth, what passionate hart could wooe more earnestly, sue more diligently, sollicite more artificially, complaine more pitifully, expostulate more amiablie, conferre more intrinsically, remit offences more redely, offer benefites more aboundantly, conclude more sweetly, and giue more pregnant testimonies of vnfeined loue, or more assured certaintie of eternal league & amitie, thē doth almightie God vnto this natiō that so grieuouslie had offended him? who wil not confesse now with the prophet Dauid, that svveet and merciful is our Lord, and his miserations aboue al the rest of his mast vvonderful 
                  Psal. 144. 
                  vvorkes. Who wil maruail, if the same prophet made a vowe, that his euerlastīg Psal. 16. song should be of the mercies of this his Lord and maker?
               But yet this thing is made much more Gods tender loue to Hicrusalē vvhē he vvas to destroy it. apparant, by that which his deuine Maiestie did afterwardes to the same people in the daies of Ieremie the prophet (aboue an hundreth yeares after this treatie in the time of Esaie;) at what time God being resolued to destroie them and their citie, for their obduration in their sinnes; when the hower of execution drewe neare, his bowels of mercie were so touched

with commiseratiō towardes them, as he called to Ieremie, and commaunded him once againe to goe vp to the temple gate wher al the people did passe in and out, and ther with a loude voice to crie as foloweth. Heare yee the word of God, ò Iere. 7. al you of Iuda, that doe passe in and out by thes gates; thus sayeth the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel: yet doe you amend your waies, and I wil dwel in this place with you. &c. And when this exhortation, and blessed indeuour of almightie God could not moue or profit them any thing at al: then his vnspeakable goodnes began with sharpe threates in this maner; My furie and indignation is gathered Iere. 7. together vpon this citie; and vpon the inhabitantes, and vpon the very beastes and cattel therof, as also vpon the fruite and trees of this region. The carcases of this people, shalbe foode to the birdes of the aire, and to the beastes of the filde; their enimies shal come & cast forth Iere. 8. of their sepulchers, the bones of the kīges and princes of Iuda; the bones of their priestes prophetes and inhabitantes; and shal drie them at the sunne, and cast them out vnto the dunghil. After al which lōg and dreadful cōmination, he altereth his speech presentelie againe, and saith with a very lamentable and pitiful voice. And 
                  A pitiful complaint. 
                  vvil not he that is fallen (notvvithstanding al this) rise vp againe? VVil not be that is departed from me, returne vnto me againe? O, vvhy doth my people runne from me so obstinatelie?
               
               
                  
By which louing complaint, and infinite other meanes of mercie that God The vvonderful proceeding of God vvith Hierusalē. vsed to that people, when no amendment at al could be procured: his diuine Maiestie was inforced to cal Nabuchodonosor king of Babilon before the walles of Hierusalem, to destroy it. But euen now also consider the bowels of his vnspeakable mercie. For hoping that by this terrour they might perchance be stirred vp to conuersion; he sent Ieremie the prophet to them againe, with this embassage: tel the inhabitantes of Hierusalem; vvil ye not yet receaue discipline and obey my vvordes? 
                  Iere. 35. Wherat thos graceles people were so litle moued, as they tooke Ieremie and cast him into prison for his message, and therby exasperated most grieuoulie Gods further indignation against them. Notwithstanding al which, his incomprehensible clemencie would not thus abandon them; but commanded holie Ieremie to Iere. 36. write out al his threates and promisses in a booke together, and to send the same vnto them, forth of the prison wher he lay, by his seruant Baruch, to be read in their hearing; and so he did. Wherof whē Ioacim the king had vnderstanding; he commanded Baruch to be brought into his presence, and ther to read the booke by the fier side, as the Scripture noteth. And whē he had heard but three or foure pages therof, he cut them out with a penne knif, The obstinacie of the Iuish nation. and threwe the whole booke into the fier, and so consumed it. At which obstinat

and impious dealing, albeit almightie God were extremely offended; yet cō
                  manded he this same booke to be indited and writen againe, in much more ample maner then before, therby (if it had bene possible) to haue stirred vp & gained that people vnto him. But when this by no means in the world could be brought to passe; then permitted his diuine Maiestie, the whole citie to be destroied, according to his former threate, and that rebellious people to be lead away captiue in bōdage to Babilon. In which place and miserie (notwithstanding their demerites) his infinit mercie could not for sake them, but sent his prophet Ezechiel, as also Baruch vnto them, with extreme complaint of Eze. 23. their obduration; and yet offring vnto thē mercie and pardon euen thē, if they would repent.
               And what more wonderful clemencie then this, can possibly be imagined deare Christian brother? May in reason any man euer now enter into doubt or despaire of Gods mercie, how great and greeuous soeuer the burden of his sinnes 
                     Ezec. 2. Epithetons geuē by God to the people of Israel. be, when he considereth this proceeding of his eternal Maiestie with the people of Israel, for so many yeares and ages together; whom him self calleth notwithstanding, Gentem Apostatricem dura facie & indomabili corde;
                   an apostatical nation of a shameles countenance and incorrigible disposition? Can God deuise any more effectual and forcible means, to erect & animate

a sinner confidently to returne vnto him, then are thes? And yet (gentle reader) for thy further confort and encouragement in this behalf, I wil adioine one thing more, which doth exceed and passe al reason and reache of humane imagination; and this is, that God promiseth to a A vvōderful point. sinner that faithfullie wil returne vnto him, not only to forget and vtterly extinguishe al memorie of his former iniquities; but also to make more ioy and triumphe at his conuersion, and to loue and cherishe him more tenderlie at his returne; then if he had neuer fallen or departed from his seruice.
               This God him self signifieth by the Prophet Esay when he saith: cal vnto Hierusalem; 
                  Esa. 40. 
                  speake vnto her hart; (that is, comfortably:) for that her iniquitie is for giuen; she hath 
                  VVhat ioy theris made at a sumers conuersion. Esa. 30.
                   
                  receaued dubble at Gods handes for al her sinnes committed. And more plainelie in an other place by the same Prophet; the light of the moone shalbe as the light of the sunne; and the light of the sonne shal be as the light of seuen dayes, seuen tymes put together, vvhen God shal binde vp the vvoundes of his people & heale their fores. And to this purpose doe appertaine directelie thos most wonderful parables of our Saueour in the Ghospel, concerning th' extraordinarie ioye and feasting that Luc. 15. the careful woman made when she had founde againe her grote that was lost; & the good Shepherd, when he brought backe the sheepe that was astray; and the merciful father when he receaued home

his sonne that before had abādoned him. And to the same purpose doth it also appertaine, that in the Prophet Dauid God Psal. 57. glorieth especiallie in the seruice of thos people, that before had not knowen him. And this shal suffice for this seconde pointe, to shew, what wonderful meanes almightie God doth vse, in setting forth his mercie for allurement of sinners vnto repentance.
               
                  AND SO HAVING declared what THE. 3. part. VVHAT assurāce God geueth to them that repent. exceeding great loue and mercie God beareth towardes man, and how effectuallie he expresseth the same by his sueing vnto sinners for their conuersion: it followeth that we should in this third place examine some what more in particuler, what certaine assurance his diuine Maiestie geueth, of vndoubted pardon and ful remission of their sinnes, to al such as vnfainedlie shal resolue them selues to make their refuge vnto him. Which thing, albeit euerie mā by that which before hath bene treated, may sufficientlie conceaue: yet for th' importāce of the matter, it shal not be amisse in this place also to adde a word or two, for more plaine and euidēt demonstration therof. And this shal be donne by setting doune both the wordes and deedes, that is, both the promisses and perfourmāce which almightie God hath vsed and excercised in this behalf, to al such as haue offended him whatsoeuer.
               And for the first, which are his promises; most apparent it is, as wel by the

thinges which before haue bene discussed, The promisses of God to sinners that repent. as also by the whole course, bodie, & drift of holie scripture; that the promises of mercie and pardon which his diuine Maiestie hath made to synners, and wherunto by his sacred word, he hath (in a certaine maner) obliged him self; are both manifold, vehement, absolute, resolute & vniuersal. VVho so euer shal depart from his 
                  Ezec. 18. 33. 34. 37. 
                  vvicked vvayes, and turne vnto me, (saith almightie God) I vvil receaue him. Behold the vniuersalitie of al people and persons, without excluding any. And then further; At vvhat day soeuer an impious man shal returne vnto me from his impietie; his vvickednes shal not hurt him; saith the same L. God, of hostes: see the vniuersalitie of al times & seasons without exceptiō. But yet harken what God addeth besides. Leaue of to doe peruerselie, (saith he to the Iewes &c.) and then doe you come and finde fault vvith me, if you 
                  Esa. 1. 
                  can. For if your sinnes vvher as red as skarlet, they shal be made as vvhite as snovve. &c. Consider the vniuersalitie of al kind of synnes, be they neuer so greeuous, so horrible or haynous. And finallie, God talking to a soule that hath oftentimes fallen & most infinitelie offended him; he saith thus:  it is Iere. 3.a common receaued speech that if a womā depart from her husbād, and doe ioine her self to an other man; she may not returne to her first husband againe, for that she is defiled, and made contaminate. And yet wheras thou hast departed from me, and hast committed fornication with many

other louers; doe thou returne vnto me againe, and I wil receaue the, saith almightie God. 
               
               By which wordes is expressed the fowerth vniuersalitie, containing al states, qualities, and conditions of men; how many waies, or how oftentimes, or how contemptuouslie soeuer, they haue committed sinnes against his diuine Maiestie. And what may be added now more vnto this? was ther euer prince that made so large an offer vnto his subiectes? or was ther euer father that gaue so ample and vniuersal promise of pardō vnto his children? Who can now mistrust him self to Fovver vniuersalities in Gods promisses to sinners. be excluded from this assurance of mercie, wherin al sortes of people, al kindes of sinnes, al times and seasons, al states and qualities of sinners are comprehended? O most miserable and infortunate man that excludeth him self, whom God excludeth not. What is ther in this general and vniuersal promises, wherof anie man in the world should haue pretence, to make any least doubt or question? Of the meaning (perhapes) and intent of him that promiseth? O deare brother, it is onlie loue and tharitie; and consequentlie, can not deceaue vs. Of the truth and suertie of his promisses? It is infallible; and more certaine then heauen and earth put together. Of the power that he hath to perfourme Three pointes of great comfort. his promisse? It is infinite, and not restrained by any boundes or limitation: wherof thē may we doubt? or in which of thes

three pointes may we not conceaue most singuler consolation? heare the comfortable meditation, that blessed S. Bernard made vpon thes three particulers which wee haue now mentioned. Tria considero (saith he) in quibus tota spes mea consistit; charitatem 
                  Bern. ser. in verb. Psalm. misericordia Domini in aeter. cantab. 
                  vocationis, veritatem promissionis, potestatem redditionis. &c. 
                  That is, I doe consider three thinges (saith this holie mā) wherin al my hope cōsisteth, & wherby it is made inuincible. First, the exceeding loue and charitie of him, that calleth me to him by repentance; secondlie, the infallible truth and certaintie of his promise which he maketh to me of pardon and mercie; thirdlie, the endles power and abilitie he hath to perfourme whatsoeuer he promiseth. This is that triple or threefold rope and chaine, which holie scripture saith is Eccle. 4. hardlie broken: for that by this rope, let donne vnto vs from heauen which is our contrie, into this world, that is our prison; we may ascende and mount vp (if we wil) euen vnto the sight and possession of Gods eternal kingdom and heauēlie glorie. Thus farre that blessed father.
               But now to the second pointe; if we consider how faithfullie almightie God Hovv God hath persourmed his promises, to sinners that haue repented. hath put in execution thos promises of his from time to time, & how no one man vpon earth, (so many ages as the world hath continued) was euer yet frustrate of his hope, in making his conuersion vnto his Maiestie, if he made it from his hart: we shal finde further cause for vs to confide.

For so much as it is not probable, or ī reason to be imagined; that he which neuer failed in times past, wil breake his promise for the time to come; especially seing now in Christianitie, when we haue this aduantage aboue other former times (as S. Iohn doth also note,) that he who was 1. Ioa. 2. and is our iudge, is become also our aduouocat to pleade our cause.
               Cast backe thine eyes then my louing deare brother, and take a vew of al ages times and seasons past and gone. Beginne from the first creation of the world, and come donneward euen vnto this daye; & examine indifferentlie whether in al this wide compasse of times, persons, places & Neuer sinner repēted that vvas not pardoned. most greeuous offences committed against his diuine Maiestie, ther were euer yet any one sinner vpon earth, that returned vnsay nedlie and was not receaued. The sinne of our first parentes, was presentelie forgeuen Gen. 3. vnto them, vpon their first signification of greefe and sorowe for the same. And not onlie this, but our Saueour also Adam & Eue. Iesus Christ was promissed to be sent, for restoring them and their posteritie to the glorie and felicitie, which by their fal they had lost. After this, vntil the time of Abraham and of the people of Israel, as some workes of Gods iustice are recorded in holie writ, that were excercised vpon irrepentant offendours: so are ther many more celebrated of his mercie; and onlie two persons in particuler are mentioned, who notwithstanding some

sorow which they seemed to haue of their offences, were yet reiected; the first The reicetion of Cain and Esau. wherof was the murderer Cain, who at the beginning denied his wickednes vnto God; and then being conuicted, despaired of remission. The second was Esau, whom S. Paul calleth a profane fornicator; who founde no place of repētāce, albeit Heb. 12. with teares he sought the same. Wherof S. Chrisostome geueth the reason in Chris. hom. 80. de paenit. ad pop. Antio. thes wordes: For this cause Esau obtained not pardon, for that he did not repente as he should haue done; his teares proceeding rather of anger and temptation, then of true sorovv.
               
               When the people of Israel came to be a distinct nation, and to be gouerned at Gods appointement: how greeuouslie (trow you) did they offend day lie, and almost howerlie his diuine Maiestie? And how gratiouslie did his vnspeakable clemencie remitt and pardon their manifold and innumerable sinnes & trespasses done agaist him? The whole scripture (in truth) The infinit sinnes of the Iuishe people & their infinit pardons receaued frō God. seemeth nothing els, but a perpetual narration of Gods incredible patience and infinite mercies towardes them. And if I would speake of particuler persons amōg them, which he receaued to his fauour after greate and manifold offences committed; ther would be no end of that recital. Let Manasses that most impious and wicked king, be an exāple for al; of whos Th' exāple of Manasses enormous life and most detestable actes, whole pages are replenished, both in the 4. Reg. 21 2. Par. 33. bookes of kinges and Chronicles; and yet

afterwardes notwithstanding, the same man falling into miserie and calamitie among the Babylonians, (a fortunate schoole oftentimes for Princes, who in their prosperitie are wont to contemne God,) he begā to be sorowful for his former life and actions; and to doe great penance (as the scripture saith) in the sight of God, for the same. Wherat his diuine and incomprehēsible mercie was so much moued presentlie, as he receaued him to fauour, and brought him backe from his prison and fetters, to his kingdome and imperial throne of Maiestie.
               The exāple also of the Niniuites is very notable & singuler in this behalf: against The exāple of the Niniuites. whom almightie God hauing decreed a sentence of death, to be executed within a certaine time; he commanded Ionas the Ion. 1. 2. 3. 4. prophet to goe and denounce that sentēce vnto them. But Ionas wel knowing the nature and disposition of God towardes mercie; forsaw (as afterwardes he signifieth) that if he should goe and beare that embassage vnto them, and they therupon make change of ther liues; his Maiestie would presentlie pardon them, and so he should be taken for a false and lying prophet. For auoiding which inconuenience, he chose rather to flee away by sea to the citie of Tharsis, and ther to hide himself. But almightie God raised a tempest in that iourney, and disposed in such sort, as Ionas was cast into the sea, and ther receaued and deuoured by a whale; from

whos belly he was commanded afterwardes to repaire to Niniue, and to doe his former message; which he perfourmed. And the tenour of his message was, that within fortie dayes that huge citie of Niniuie should be destroyed. Which he hauing denounced vnto them: the sequel fel out, as Ionas before had suspected. For the Niniuites beleeuing the message, and betaking them selues to repentance, God forgaue them presentlie; wherat Ionas was exceedinglie greeued & offended, & complained sweetlie to God of his strāge dealing herin, demanding whie he had inforced him to come and preach destruction vnto them, knowing wel before hād, that he would pardon them. But his merciful Lord answered him fullie to this pointe, by a certaine accident that fel out, wherto Ionas was not able to replie one word.
               For so it chanced, that Ionas sitting without the walles of Niniuie, vnder an Iuie bush, that in one night by Gods appointment was sprōg vp to couer him frō the sunne: the same Iuie by Gods ordināce perished vpon the suddaine, and was consumed by a worme, leauing the poore prophet destitute of that consolation of shadoe which he receaued by it. Wherwith he being not a litle disquieted and afflicted; Cōsider this speech of almightie God. Ion 23. 4. God said vnto him; thou (Ionas) art sorowful, and much grieued for losse of thine Iuie tree, which not withstanding thou diddest not plant nor make to grow,

nor tookest any labour at al about it. But the same grew vp in one night, and in one night it perished againe. And shal not I then, be careful to pardon my greate citie of Niniuie, wherin ther be aboue an hundred and twentie thousand innocent people, which can not distinguish betwene their right hand and their left? This was the answer of almightie God to Ionas, for defence of his singuler inclinatiō to mercie, in respect that the Niniuites were his owne creatures, his owne workmanship, and the labours of his own handes, as al other people also are. Of which kinde of reason, and consideration, ther haue bene diuers thinges said and declared In the first part of this chapter. before, for manifestation of Gods infinit mercie. And al this that hitherto hath bene spoken, is of thinges onlie donne in time of the old testament, before the appearance of Christ our Saueour in flesh.
               But now if we looke into the time of grace, when God incarnate came him self Examples of mercie in the nevv testament. in person, to shew the riches of his endles mercie vnto mortal men vpon earth: we shal see more examples without comparison, of this exceeding clemencie. For that now, our Creator and shepheard ouercome (as it were) with extreme compassion came down into the vale of our miserie, with resolution not onlie to offer pardon and forgeuenes to al his sheepe that were a stray and would returne; but Luc. 15. also to follow & seeke them out; & being found, to lay them on his own shoulders,

and so to beare them backe vnto the fold againe, and ther to geue his life and blood for their defence against the wolfe. O sweet Lord, what greater loue cā be imagined Ioan. 10. & 11. then this? what more pregnant signification of inflamed charitie, can mans cogitation conceaue or apprehend? is it maruaile now if he which descēded vnto vs with this hart, and with thes bowels of burning affectiō, did set open the gates of al his treasures, fauours, & graces vnto vs? Is it maruaile if the holie apostle S. Paul doe saye of this time, Superabundauit gratia, that grace did ouer abounde: and yet Rom. 5. further in an other place; that Christ being verie God, did in a certaine sort impouerish and emptie him self, with the Phil. 2. most wonderful effusion of mercies and hauoke of heauen, which at this time and euer since he hath made?
               
               Herehence it proceeded that al his delite and pleasure vpon earth, was to conuerse The vvonderful clemēcie of Iesus our Sauiour. with sinners, and to geeue them cō
                  fort, corage, and cōfidence in him. Which he did so manifestlie, in the sight of al the world; as he was very scandalous and offensiue therby to the Scribes and Pharisees, and other principal rulers among the Math. 9. & 11. Marc. 2. Luc. 5. Iuish nation. Herehence also did proceed thos his most maruailous speeches and strange inuitations of wicked men vnto him; as for example at one time among other, when he cried out in publique; Come vnto me al ye that doe labour and be heauie loden, and I vvel refresh you. And at an other Math. 11.
                  
time, going into the temple of Ierusalem vpon a high festiual day, when al the people were gathered together: he stood vp in the middest of them al, and brake forth into this vehement inuitation, with a lowd voice, as S. Iohn Euangelist recordeth; if any man among you, be thirstie; let him 
                  Ioan. 7. 
                  come vnto me, & he shal drinke. Hereby it came to passe, that his diuine Maiestie was termed commonlie, Publicanorum & peccatorum 
                  Mat. 11. 
                  am cus; The frend and familiar of wicked Publicans and sinners. And herof finallie it did proceed, that he receaued al, imbraced al, and forgaue al that repaired vnto him; were they Scribes, Pharisees, Souldiars, Publicans, Vserers, Harlotes, Theeues, Persecutours, or whatsoeuer most grieuous offendours besides; (wherof particuler examples in eche kinde might be alleaged:) assuring vs furthermore, that after his resurrection and blessed ascensiō to the right hand of his father, he would be more bountiful yet in this maner of proceeding, and dravv al vnto him self: being Ioan. 12. at one time both our Iudge and Aduocat, our king and Mediatour, our God and Redeemer, our Father and brother, our Priest and Sacrifice, and he that both pleadeth and determineth our cause together.
               What then should not we hope at this time (deare Christian brother) at the handes Great and manie causes of assured hope in IESVS. of this our Lord and Maister, which hath left vnto vs such wordes, such deedes, such assured euidencies of his infallible loue and abundant mercies towards vs?

why should not his dealinges with other men before vs, geeue vs hart and corage to confide assuredlio in him, for the time present and to come? why should not his former most infinit mercies, be vnto vs oderiferous alluring sauours and oyntmentes, to make vs as the spouse did in the Canticles, follow and runne after Cant. 1. him? Heare what deuout S. Bernard doth meditate vpō this passage of Christs Bern. ser. 5. in Cant. fragrant ointmentes. O sweet Iesus (saith he) the freshe and oderiferous smel of thie wonderful clemencie doth allure vs to runne after the, when we heare saye, that thou despisest not beggars, nor abhorrest sinners. Wee know right wel (ô Lord) that thou didest not reiect the theefe that confessed thee, nor the sinful woman that wept vpon thee, nor the Chananaean that humbled her self before thee, not the wicked adulteresse brought vnto thee, nor the toullar or tribut gatherer that followed thee, nor the publican that repaired vnto thee, nor the disciple that denied thee, nor Saul that did persecute thee, nor thie tormentours that did naile thie sacred bodie vpō the crosse. O Lord, al thes are fragrant smels and sauours of thie most sweet mercie; and at the sent of thes thie ointmentes, we doe follow and runne after thee. Thus farre S. Bernard.
               
                  AND SO VVITH THIS to come THE. 4. part. Th' application of al that hath bene said. to the fourth and last part of this chapter, and to applie al that hath bene said of Godes mercie, to our present purpose;

What man is ther liuing in the world, that reading and beleeuing thes thinges, can doubt or mistrust to receaue pardon for his sinnes? If God be he that iustifieth; vvho is able to condemne vs, saieth the holie Apostle Rom. 8. S. Paul? If God be minded to deliuer vs, who can take vs out of his hands? If God protest that he wil pardon vs, why should Ioa. 10. we make any doubt or questiō therof at al? Why should not we ioine rather with that confident and faithful seruāt of his S. Paul, who saieth vnto vs and to al other sinners liuing, in his maisters name; let vs repaire vnto him vvith a true hart in fulnes of faith, hauing 
                  Heb. 10. 
                  purged our hartes from an euil conscience; let 
                  S. Pauls exhortatiō to confidence. 
                  vs hold fast an immouable confession of our hope, seing he is faithful vvhich hath giuen vnto vs his promis, and let vs consider hovv one of vs may prouoke an other to charitie and good vvorkes. By which wordes the holy Apostle signifieth, that what sinner soeuer shal resolue with him self to purge his conscience frō wickednes for the time to come, and to employ the rest of life in charetie & good workes: he may confidently and boldly repaire vnto almightie God, with most certaine assurance to receaue pardon and remission. And alas (deare brother) why then should anie man despaire? wherfore should any man cast away his owne soule, that God so much desireth to saue? what a pitiful and lamentable case is it, to behold so many Christians in the world to goe languishing in ther sinnes, and to giue thē selues ouer to al kind of careles and dissolute

sensualitie (which by God him self is called desperation,) vpon this conceit & wicked cogitation, that now they are gone so farre, and so deeply rooted and habituated in this kind of life, as either it is impossible or in vaine for them now, to thincke of change or amendements O deare Brother, let thes men harken to this excellent discourse of holy Chrisostome, which ensueth.
               
                  If thou be a wicked man (saieth he,) thincke vpon the Publicane. If thou be vncleane of life, consider the harlot. If An excellēt discourse and exhortation of S. Chrysost. liom. 2. in Psal. 50. thou be a murtherer, remember the theef. If thou be a swearer, cal to mind the Blasphemer. Cast thine eyes vpon Saul and Paul, first a persecutour, and then a preacher; first a violent robber, afterward a good steward and Dispenser: First chaffe, afterward corne: first a wolfe, afterward a sheppard; first lead, after gould: first a pirate, afterwards a good pilot: first a dispersour, afterward a gatherer; first a breaker doune of Gods vineyard, afterward a plāter: first a destroier, afterward a builder. Thou hast sene manifold wickednes; but now behold vnspeakable mercie. Thou hast heard the pride of the seruant; consider now the loue and clemencie of the Maister. I wil not thou saie to me, I ame a blasphemer, I haue bene a persecutour, I haue lead an vncleane and abhominable life, and therfore I doubt lest I shal not haue pardon; Saie not so vnto me, for here thou hast examples to the

contrarie, in euerie of thes & manie other sinnes. Thou maiest safely fly to what port thou list, and that either in the old or new Testament. For in the old thou hast Dauid, in the new thou hast Paul. I wil not haue the therfore alleage excuses vnto me, for couering thine owne cowardnes. Hast thou sinned, doe penance: hast thou sinned a thousand times, repent a thousand times vnfainedly. This is the only ointment that may be poured in to an afflicted consciēce, the torment wherof I doe wel knowe. For the Diuel standeth by, whetting his The speech of the diuel. to a sonle loden vvith sume. sword of desperation and saing vnto the; Thou hast liued wickedly al thy youth, & thy former yeares thou hast mispent; thou hast hanted plaies and spectacles with thy companions, and hast folowed after louse and lasciuious women; thou hast taken other mēs goods from them wrongfully; thou hast bene couetous, dissolute, and effeminate: thou hast foresworne thy self; thou hast blasphemed & committed many other hainous and enormous crimes, and therfore what hope canst thou haue of saluation? Truly none at al. Thou art a mere castawie, and canst not now goe backe; and therfore my counsaile is, that now thou vse the pleasures and commodities of this world, and passe ouer thy time in mirth of hart, without cogitation of other affaires.
               
               
                  Thes are the wordes of the Deuil (louing brother:) Thes are the counsailes & persuasions of our enemie. But mine are

contrarie. If thou haue fallen, thou maiest S. Chrysostoms counsail against the diuels temptation. rise againe: If thou haue bene a lost companion, yet thou maiest be saued. If thou haue committed fornication and adulterie in time past; thou maiest be continent for the time to come. If thou haue hanted playes & games; thou maiest drawe backe thy foot from hence forth. If thou haue delighted in leud and euil companie; thou maiest herafter acquaint thy self with good. Thou hast free wil to chuse ether part. This only is necessarie; that thou beginne thy conuersion out of hand, & that thou repent and take in hand to reforme thy self, though it be at the first but a litle. Let thine eies beginne but to shed forth one teare; enter into thy conscience; consider thy self but indifferently; examine thine actions and what they deserue; lay before thy face the daie of Iudgment with the torments of hel on the one side, and the ioyes of heauen on the other. Repēt, confesse, amend thy life, seeke a medicine for thy wound, out of hand while thou art in this life, in what state or condition soeuer thou be. Yea if thou be vpon thy death-bed, & ready to breath out thy soule No time to late to repent. and spirit; feare not to repent, for that Gods mercie is not restrayned by the shortnes of time. Which I speake vnto you (my deare brethren) not to make you hereby the more negligent, but only to stirre you vp to the confidence of Gods mercie, and thereby to auoyde the most dangerous gulfe of desperation. Hitherto

are the wordes of this holie and learned Father.
               In which long and large discourse of his, we are to note, that (together with most excellent encoragement which he geueth to al sinners of what state and cō
                  dition soeuer they be, in al times and seasons to confide in Gods mercie, and neuer to despaire;) he geueth also an holsome admonishment, that we should not by this confidence become more necligent in reforming our liues, but rather do it out of hand, without al delay or procrastinatiō. Whereunto in like maner the holy father S. Augustine in a like exhortation against despaire, doth endeuour most vehemently An exhoritation and ad monition of S. Augustine. Ser. 58. de temp.
                   to stirre vs vp in these wordes: Let no man after a hundred sinnes, nor after a thousand, despaire of Gods mercie; but yet so let him not despaire, as he seeke presently without al stay, to recōcile him self to God by amendment of life; least perhaps after that by custome he hath gotten a habit of sinne, he be not able to deliuer him self from the snares of the Diuel, albeit he would.
               
               And in the very same sermon he discourseth yet further of the same matter, in manner folowing. Not euery man that hath sinned, but he that perseuereth in sinne, is hateful and abominable in the sight of God. For that no man must distrust of Gods mercie towards him that wil amend and leaue his sinnes. For that God him self as a most sweete comforter hath

said by his Prophet, that the impietie of a 
                     Eze. 11. 33 
                     vvicked man shal not hurt him, at vvhat day soeuer he shal turne from the same. But yet this great mercie of our Lord, is thē only profitable vnto vs; if we delay not our conuersion, nor doe multiplie sinnes vpon sinnes. Which I wil declare vnto you by th' example of woundes and ruptures of our bodie, by which th' infirmities also of our mind and soule may be conceaued.
               
               
                  Thus then we see, if a mās foote, leg, or arme be broken; with how great paine A similitud of the bodie, to expresse the miscrie of the soule, by multiplying sinne. the same is restored to his accustomed strength. But if any member of our body should be broken twise, or three times, or more often in one and the self same place: your charitie cā imagin, how hard a thing it were for that part to recouer her perfit health againe. So fareth it (deare brethrē) in the woundes and ruptures of our soule. If a man doe commit sinne once or twise, and doe vnsainedly without dissimulatiō make his refuge to the medicine of perā
                     ce; he doth out of hand obtaine health againe, and that sometimes without any skar or blemish of the disease past. But if he begin to adde sinnes vpō sinnes in such sort, that the woundes of his soule doe rather putrifie within him by couering and defending them, then heale by repentance and confession: it is to be feared, least that heauy speach of th' Apostle be fulfilled in him, to whom he saith; dost thou 
                     Rom. 2. 
                     not knovv, that the benignitie of God is vsed to bring thee to repentance? but thou by the obdurate
                     
                     and irrepētant hart, dost heape to thy self vvrath, in the day of vengeance and of the reuelation of Gods iust iudgement.
                    Thus far S. Augustine.
               But now (deare Christian brother) what can be spoken more effectually, either to 
                     〈◊〉
                   vs to hope and confidence in Gods mercie, 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   presumption in delaying our amendment, thē here hath bene vttered by these noble pillars, and fathers of Christes Church, and most excellent instrumentes and temples of his holie Spirit? The diuine wisdome Codlie mā vvordes ought to moue vs greatlie. Eccle. 12. of almightie God i a certaine place saith, that the wordes of wise men, ought to be spurres vnto vs, and as it were nailes, driuen into the depth of our hartes: meaning thereby, that we should be stirred vp and most vehemently moued, when we heare such wise men as the holie Ghost there meaneth (which in deede are only they that haue the knowledge and true feare of God,) make such exhortations vnto vs, and ue vs such holsom admonishmentes, as thes godlie fathers in this great affaire haue donne. And how is it then (deare brother) that we are nothing stirred vp thereby, nothing quickned, nothing awaked? Wel; I wil conclude this whole chapter and treatise with an other exhortation and admonition of S. Augustine; for that besides the graue authoritie of the mā (which ought to moue vs much) I thinke nothing can be spoken more excellently, or more agreeing to our peculiar purpose. Thus then he saith.
               
                  Almightie God doth neuer despise the repentance of any mā, if it be offered vnto him sincerely & simply: nay, he accepteth A notable discourse of S. Augustine touching our conuersion. Ser. 181. de temp.
                   the same most willingly, embraceth the penitent, and endeuoreth to reduce him to his former state wherein he was before he fel. And that which is yet more; if a man be not able to fulfil the whole order of his satisfaction; yet doth not. God refuse the least penance that is, though it be dōne in neuer so short a space. Neither doth he suffer the reward to perish of any litle conuersion. And this doth the prophet Esaie seeme to me to signifie, when Esa. 54. he faith in Gods person to the people of Israel: I haue contristed thee a litle for thy sinne; I haue striken thee and haue turned my face from thee: thou hast bene sad and hast walked in sorow, and I haue cō
                  forted thee againe. These examples then of penance (deare brethren) we hauing before our eyes; let vs not perseuer in our wickednes, nor despaire of reconciliatiō, but rather let vs say with a confidēt hart: we wil turne home to our father, & present our selues vnto our God; for truely (my brethren) he wil neuer turne away from the man, that turneth vnto him. Himself hath said that he is a God that draweth Esa. 19. nere vnto vs, were it not that our sinnes doe make a separation betwixt him and vs. Let vs take away then the separation and obstacle, and so nothing shal let our coniunction with him, which he greatly desireth. For to this end did he

create vs, that he might bestow vpon vs eternal blisse in his kingdome of heauen. He did not make vs for hel, but he made Hel not made for man. Mat. 25.
                   his kingdome for vs, and hel for the diuel. So he saith in the Gospel; Come ye blessed of my father, enioy the kingdome prepared for you frō the beginning of the vvorld. And to the dā
                  ned; Depart from me ye accursed into euerlasting fier vvhich is prepared for the deuil & his angels.
               
               
                  If then hel fier was prepared for the Diuel and the kingdome of heauen for man, from the beginning of the world; it remaineth only that we prouide; not to loose our inheritance by persisting in sinne. So long as we are in this life, how In this life al penāce is auailable but not after. many or great soeuer our sinnes may be, it is possible to wash them away by penāce: but when we shal be once departed from this world, albeit then we do repent, (as no doubt but we shal from the bottom of our hartes,) yet shal it auaile vs nothing. And albeit our teeth do gnash, our mouth, crie out, our eies gush forth in teares, and our hartes lamēt with innumerable complaintes and supplications: yet shal no man heare vs, no man assist vs, nor so much as with the tip of his fingar, geue vnto vs a drop of water to coole our tong amiddest her tormentes; but we shal receaue that lamentable answer which the rich glotton receaued at the mouth of Abraham: There is betvvene vs and you a great distance, so that none may passe from vs to you, nor from you to vs.
                   Hitherto lasteth S. Augustins exhortation.
            
            
               
               
                  THE SECOND LET OF RESOLVTION, WHICH IS, THE SVPPOSED hardnes and asperitie of vertuous life. The fallacie vvherof is discouered, and the manisoid helpes declared, that doe make the same most easie, svveet, and pleasaent. CHAPT. II.
               
               The euerlasting and irreconciliable enimie of our heauēlie blisse and saluation, hauing receaued by the former reasons and considerations of Gods īfinit goodnes, a very strong encounter and contradiction against his first and greatest assault of desperation; (him self also being inforced to confesse, though with endles greef and enuie, that Tvvo assaultes of our ghostlie enimie. the mercie of almightie God is without measure towards man:) he retireth him self back manie times from the pursute therof, (i such especially as haue yet some

time to liue in this world, & seeme not to be neare vnto their ending dayes,) and taketh in hand a more calme and easie enterprice, (as it may appeare,) persuading such sinners as he can not bring to despaire, that at least wise they stand aloose and hold themselues of from al resolutiō, to put in vre and excercise the preceptes of Christian life, for that they are hard, vnsauerie, painful, and troblesom; ful of melancholie and sadnes; void of comfort, good felooship, and dilection; opposite to al mirth contentation and ioy; subiect to continual affliction and vexatiō of mind; and finallie not supportable to such bodies, such mindes, such education, such custome, such course of life as theirs are.
               This is an ordinarie sleight and practice of our aduersarie; which he maketh to seeme so sweet and plaucible, by certaine ointmentes that he adioineth of flatterie, to our sensualitie: that most men of the world doe receaue this persuation for sound councel and perfect wisdom, esteeming al other either simple or sottish, or at least wise far inferiour in iudgment & discretion to them selues, that doe imbrace or persuade the contrarie. By which meanes it commeth to passe, that this second point of hardnes and difficultie in vertuous life, is a verie great, strong, ordinarie, and vniuersal impediment, that letteth infinit soules, from imbracing the meanes of their saluatiō; and consequentlie, not to be passed ouer in this place

without ful examination and perfect answer.
               First then albeit wee should suppose, that the way of vertue were so hard in 1. If vertuous life vvere hard, yet vvorthie the labour. deed, as the enemie would make it seeme; yet might I wel say with S. Iohn Chrisostom, that seeing the reward is so great & infinit as before we haue declared: no labour should seeme great for gaining of the same. Againe, I might say with holy S. Augustine; Lib. de cō
                     punct. cordis. Hom. 16. ex 50. That seeing we take daily so great paine in this world, for auoiding of lesser inconueniences, as of sicknes, imprisonementes, losse of goodes & life, and other the like: what paines should we refuse for auoiding the eternitie of hel fire, the torment wherof is insupportable? The first of thes considerations S. Paul vsed when he said;  
                     the sufferinges of this 
                     Rom. 8. 2. Pet. 2. 
                     life are not vvoorthie of the glorie vvhich shal be reuealed in the next. The second, S. Peter vsed, when he wrote; that seeing the heauens must be dissolued, and Christ come in Iudgement to restore to euery man according to his woorkes: what maner of men ought we to be in al holy conuersation?  As who wold say; No labour, no paines, no trauaile, no penance, ought to seeme hard or great vnto vs, to the ende we might auoide the terrour of that dreadful day. S. Augustin demandeth this question; what we thinke the riche glutton Lue. 16. in hel wold doe now for auoiding his tormētes, if he were in this life again; wold he take paines or no? wold he bestirre

him self, rather then turne into that place of calamitie againe? I might adioine to this, the infinit paines that Christ tooke for vs; the infinit benefites he hath bestowed vpon vs; the infinit sinnes we haue committed against him; the infinit examples of Saincts, that haue troden this path before vs, being notwithstanding of more delicate cōstitution of bodie thē we are: in respect of al which, we ought to make no bones at a litle paines and labour, if it were true that Gods seruice were so troublesome as many doe esteeme it.
               But now in verie truthe the matter is nothing so; and this is but a subtile deceate 2. The vvays of vertue is not hard in deed. Mat. 12. of the enemie for our discouragement. The testimome of Christ him self is cleare in this point, saing: Iugū meū suaue est, & enus meum leue: My yoke is sweet, and my burdē light. And his dearlie beloued disciple S. Iohn, who had best cause to know his maisters secret herein, sayeth plainlie; Mandata eius grauia non sunt; his commaundements 1. Ioh. 5. are not greeuous. What is the cause then why so many men doe conceaue such an insuperable difficultie in this affaire? Surelie, one cause is, (besides the fallacie of the deuil which is the The cause of pretēdeā difficulties. cheefest,) for that men feele the disease of concupiscence in their bodies, but doe not cōsider the strength of the medicine geuē vnto vs against the same; they crie with S. Paul, that they finde a lavv in their members repugning to the lavv of their minde, (which is,

the rebellion of concupiscence left in our flesh by original sinne;) but they confesse not, or cōsider not with the same apostle; that the grace of God, by Iesus Christ, shall deliuer 
                  Ibidem. 
                  them from the same. They remember not the comfortable saying of our Saueour vnto S. Paul, in the middest of his greatest temptations; Sufficie tibi gratia mea; My grace is 2. Co. 12. sufficient to strengthen thee against them al. Thes men (I say) doe as Helizeus his disciple did, who casting his eyes onelie vpō 
                  4. Re. 6. the number of his enemies; that is, vpon the huge armie of Syrians redie to assault him; thought hīself lost & vtterly vnable to stand in their sight, vntil by the prayers of his master the holie Prophet, he was permitted by God to see the Angels, that stoode there present to fight on his side; and then he wel perceaued that his parte was the stronger.
               So fareth it with the weake and distrustful people, who feeling and considering onlie the miseries and infirmities of their own nature, wherby day lie strong The singuler assistāce of God, for ouer cumming difficulties. tentations do rise against them; doe account the batail painful, and the victorie vnpossible; hauing not tasted in deed, nor euer proued (through their own default and negligence) the manifold helpes of heauenlie and spiritual succours, which almightie God neuer faileth to send vnto such, as are content for his sake to take this cōflict in hand. S. Paul had wel tasted that ayde, who hauing reckned vp al the hardest incounters and impedimentes that

might be; he adioineth notwithstanding; Sed in his omnibus superamus propter cum qui dilexit 
                  Rom. 8. 
                  nos:
                   But we ouercome in al these combates, by his assistance, that loueth vs. And then falleth he to that most wonderful protestation, wherof both heauen earth and hel may stand in admiration; that nether death, nor life, nor Angels, nor other thing, should be able to seperat him from Christ, or to make him abandon his seruice; and al this vpon the confidence of spiritual ayd frō his said Saueour, wherby Philip. 4. he sticked not to auouch, that he could doe al things. The Prophet Dauid also had proued the force of this assistance, when he saide; I did runne the vvay of thy commaundementes (ô 
                  Psal. 118. 
                  Lord,) vvhen thoudiddest enlarge my hart. This enlargement of hart, was by spiritual consolation of internal vnction, wherby a mans hart drawen together by anguishe and sorow, is opened and enlarged (at what time Gods holie grace is powred ito it) no otherwise then a drie purse is softened and enlarged by annointing it with oyle. Of which diuine oyle, and heauenlie comfort, when this blessed seruant of God had receaued his part; he confessed presentlie, that he did not onlie walke the wayes of Gods commandementes with ease; but also did runne them ouer with exceeding pleasure. Euē as a carte wheele A similitude. which creketh and complaineth, vnder a smal burden when it is drie; doth runne on merilie and without al noise, when a litle oyle is put vnto it. Which thing

aptlie expresseth our state and condition; who without Gods assistance are able to doe nothing; but with the ayde thereof, are able to conquere and ouercome al things.
               And surelie, I would gladlie aske these men that imagine the way of Gods holy A question to be demā
                     ded of pretenders of difficulties. Psal. 118. law to be so hard and ful of difficultie; how the prophet could say (who was a man as we are) I haue taken pleasure (ô Lord) in the vvay of thy commaundementes, euen as in al the riches of the vvorld? And in an other place; That the same commandementes vvere more pleasant and more to be desired, then any gold or pretious stone; and more svveter thē hony 
                  Psal. 18. 
                  or the hony combe; By which wordes he yeeldeth to vertuous life, not onely due estimation of honour and value aboue al treasures in the world; but also of pleasure, delite, and sweetnes; therby to confound al those that abandone & forsake the same, vpon idle pretensed and feined difficulties. And if king Dauid could say thus much in the old testament, and of the old law, (which notwithstanding was infinitlie more hard thē is the new:) with how much more reason may we speake it now, in the time of grace, when not onlie the seruice of God in it self, is Ioan. 5. Rom. 5. Heb. 6. without al comparison more sweet and easie: but also the peculier helpes and assistances of almightie God, much more effectual and abundant.
               For further declaratiō wherof, I would demand of thee, thou poore infortunat

Christian, that deceauest thie self with The end of Christs cō
                     ming to make the vvay easie. thes bugges and fancies of imagined difficulties, whie Christ our Saueour came into this world? whie tooke he our flesh vpon him? whie laboured he and tooke so much paines among vs? whie shed he his blood? whie praied he to his father so often for vs? whie appointed he the Sacramentes as conduites to deriue his most holie grace vnto vs? whie sent he the Holie Ghost into the world? what signifieth Ghospel or good tidings? what meaneth the words, Grace & Mercie brought with him? what importeth the comfortable name of IESVS? Is not al this to deliuer vs from sinne? from sinne past, (I say) by Mat. 1. his only death; from sinne present and to come, by the same death and by the assistance of his holy grace, bestowed on vs more abundantlie then before? Was not this one of the prīcipal effectes of Christ his comming as the prophet noted; that craggie pathes should be made streight, and hard 
                  Esa. 40. Esa. 11. Et vide Ier. ibid. Amb. lib. 1. de sp. 5 c. 20. S. Aug ser. 209. de temp. 
                  vvayes plaine? was not this the cause whie he indued his church with the seuen blessed giftes of the Holie Ghost, and with the vertues infused; to make the yoke of his seruice sweet, the exercise of good life easie, the walking in his commandemētes pleasant: in such sort, as men might now sing in tribulations, haue confidence in Mat. 5. Luc. 6. Act. 4. 2. Cor. 4. perils, securitie in afflictions, and assurance of victorie in al temptations? is not this the beginning, midle, and ende of the Ghospel? were not thes the promises of

the Prophetes, the tydinges of the Euangelistes, the preachinges of the Apostles, the doctrine, beleef, and practise of al saincts? and finallie is not this, verbum abbreuiatum, The word of God abbreuiated Esa. 10. and made short, wherin doe consist al the riches and treasures of our Christian profession?
               But for that this matter is of exceeding great weight, to the strēgthening of Christians in their vocation, against the The summe of this chapter vvith the tvvo ge neral partes therof. temptations of pusilanimitie and deiectiō, which are verie ordinarie & dāgerous to most mē in the world; it shal not be amisse (perhappes) to treate & discusse the same more at large in this place, laying doune the particuler meanes and helpes which euerie man hath or may haue in this busines, if he want not wil to vse and applie the same to his assistance and commoditie. And for that the feeld is large, & the matters are many, which doe appertaine vnto this point: I haue thought conuenient for more plainesse and perspicuitie of the reader, to reduce the whole summe, vnto two general heads & partes; In the first wherof, shalbe shewed the manifold  & sundry helpes, that almightie God doth lend to man, for the faciliting of the way of his holie commandementes; and in the second shalbe layed doune certaine  instructions, admonishmentes, and examples, how to make our auaile of thos helpes that are lent vnto vs.
               
                  
                  The first part. Of the helpes that are geuen to Christians for making vertuous life easie.
                  
                  IT were a verie hard and difficil matter for any man to take vpon him, to set forth al and euerie the particuler waies 
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                      and meanes, wherby our most merciful Lord and Saueour, doth comfort, strengthen, and cherish the soule, that resolueth to liue faithfullie in his seruice. Ther are infinite secretes that doe passe betwene them, infinit priuie tokens and significations of loue, that none els can expresse or conceaue: wherof the Prophet Esay hauing had a taste, cried out; Secretum meum mibi, Secretum meum mihi: 
                     My secret is to my Esa. 24. self, my secret is to my self. But yet of thos publique and ordinarie waies, wherby it is euident in holie write, that almightie God is accustomed to worke this effect of making sweet and easie his commandementes; I shal here recount the chiefe and principal for our common consolation & encoragement.
                  
                     AND FIRST OF AL other, we must recon in this number, the infusion of THE. helpe. GODS grace and the force therof. Gods most holie & pretious grace into our mindes and soules, wherby they are beautified and strengthened against al difficulties and temptations, as S.* Paul was in particular against the tribulations and temptations of the flesh. And this grace 2. Cor. 12. is of such efficacie and force in the soule

where it once entereth; that it altereth This grace geuen to S. Paul, Bun. striketh out; for fear, least by S. Pauls exā
                        ple, any man should think himself aide (vvith the holpe of Gods grace) to resist such temptations. the whole state thereof, making thos thinges cleare, which were obscure before; thos thinges pleasant, which were bitter before; thos thinges easie, which were hard and difficult before. And for this cause also it is saied in scripture, that it maketh a new spirit & a new hart wher it is bestowed by almightie God; which his diuine Maiestie signifieth by the Prophet Ezechiel in thes wordes, when he treateth of the graces that should be geuē at the comming of Christ in flesh; I vvil geue vnto them a nevv hart, and vvil put a nevv 
                     Exo. ca. 31. & 36. 
                     spirit in their bovvelles; to the end they may vvalke in my preceptes, and keepe my commandementes. What can be spokē more effectuallie of the power of Gods holie grace, to the perfourmance of good workes.
                  In like maner of the force and efficacie of the same grace to resist, mortifie, & The force of grace in resisting tē
                        ptations. conquer the passions of our flesh and sensualitie, which by their rebellion against vertue doe make the way of Gods commandementes vnpleasant, S. Paul testifieth clearlie, when he writeth thus to the Romans: This vve knovv, that our old man is crucified, 
                     Rom. 6. 
                     to the ende that the bodie of sinne may be destroyed, & vve be in bondage no more therūto. In which wordes, by the old man, and the bodie of sinne, S. Paul vnderstandeth our rebellious appetite and concupiscence, which is so crucified and destroied by the most noble sacrifice of Christ our Saueour: as we may by the grace purchased

vnto vs in that holie sacrifice, So proueth S. Aug. l. 2. de pecca. mer. cap. 6. resist and conquere this appetite, and so keepe our selues from the seruitude of sinne: that is; from any consent and guilt of mortal sinne, if we wil our selues. And this is that noble & entire victorie, which God promised so long agoe to euerie Christian soule by the meanes of Christ, when he Esa. 41. said. Be not a feard for I am with thee: step not aside, for I thy God haue strengthened thee, and haue assisted thee; and the right hand of my iust (MAN,) hath taken thy defence. Behold, al that fight against thee, shalbe confonded and put to shame; thou shalt seeke thy rebelles, and shalt not find thē: they shalbe as though they were not, for that I am thy Lord and God.
                  
                  Loe here a ful victorie promised vpon our rebelles, by the helpe of the right hand of Gods iust man; that is, a ful cóquest vpon our disordinate passiōs and temptations, by the aide of grace from IESVS Christ. And albeit thes rebelles are not here promised to be taken cleane away; but onelie to be cōquered and confonded: yet is it saied, that they shalbe as though they vvere not. Wherby is signified, that they shal not hinder vs in the way of our saluation, A similitude shevving, hovv passions vvhen theyare mo derated may be prositable. but rather aduance and further the same, if we wil. For as wild beastes which of their owne nature are fearse, & would rather hurt then profite mankind; being mastred and made tame, become verie cō
                     modious & necessarie for our vses: so thes rebellious passions of ours, which of thē
                     
selues would vtterlie ouerthrow vs, being once subdued and mortified by Gods grace and our own diligence, doe stand vs in singular steade to the practise and exercise of al kinde of vertues. As for exāple: 
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        . choler or angre, to the inkendling of zeale; hatred, to the pursuing of sinne; a hautie mind, to the reiectig of the world; loue, to the embracing of algreat and heroical attemptes, in consideration of the benefites receaued from God. Besides this the verie conflict and combat it self in subduing thes passions, is left vnto vs for our great good; that is, for our patience, humilitie, merite, and victorie in this life: and for our glorie and croune in the life to come: as S. Paul affirmed of him self, and coufirmed to al others, by his example.
                  Now then lett the slothful Christian goe put this handes vnder his girdlie, and saye: There is a lyon in the vvaye, and a lyonesse in the parthredie to deuoure hin, for which he dare not 
                        〈◊〉
                      furth of dores. Let him crie; It is colde, and therefore he dareth not goe to plovve. Let him excuse him self that it is vneasie Prou. 26. Excuses of slothful Christians. Pro. 20. Pro. 24. to labour, and therfore he can not purge his vineyarde of nettles and thistles, nor build any vval about the same; That is; let him saye, that his passions are strong, and therfore he can not conquere them: his body is delicate, and therfore he dare not put it to trauayle: the way of vertuous life is hard and vneasie, and therfore he can not applie him self therunto. Let him saye al this and much more, which ydle and slothful

Christians are accustomed to bring for their excuse: let him alleage the same as much and as often times as he wil; it is but an excuse, and a false excuse, and an excuse moste dishonorable and detractorie to the force of Christ holie grace, purchased vnto vs by his bitter passion: that now his yoke should be vnpleasant, seing Mat. 11. he hath made it sweete; that now his burden should be heauie, seing he hath made 1. Ioh. 5. Ioh. 8. Rom. 7. it light; that now his commaundementes should be greeuous, seing his most deuine Maiestre affirmeth the contrarie: that now we should be in seruitude of our passions, seing he hath by his grace deliuered Rom. 8. Psal. 26. 27. vs, and made vs truelie free. If God be vvith vs, vvho vvill be against vs, sayeth the Apostle? 
                        God is my helper and defender (saieth holie Dauid,) for vvhom shal I quake, or trēble? If whole armies should rise against me: yet wil I alwaies hope to haue the victoric. Psal. 22.
                       And what is the reason? for that thou art vvith me (ô Lords) thou fightest on my side; thou assistest me with thy grace; by helpe and assistance whereof, I shal haue the victorie, though al the squadrons of my enemies, that is, of the flesh, the world, and the deuil, should at once rise against me. Nay, I shal not onelie haue the victorie, but I shal haue it also most easilie, and 1 Ioh. 5. with al pleasure cōfort & delite. For thus much signifieth S. Iohn; in that, (hauing saied that the commaundemētes of Christ are not greeuous;) he inferreth presently, as the cause there of; Quoniam omne quod natum
                     
                     est ex Deo, vincit mundum. For that al which is borne of God, ouercommeth & conquereth the world: that is; the grace and heauenlie assistance which is deriued and sent vs from God aboue, doth both conquer the world, with al the difficulties and temptations therof; as also make the commaundements of almightie God, most easie vnto vs, and al vertuous life veric sweet and pleasant.
                  But here perhappes you wil saye vnto Hovv Christes for nice is a yoke and burden and yet not heauie nor troblesome. me: Christ him self confesseth it to be a yoke and burden; and how then can it be so pleasant & easie as you make it? wherto I answer; that Christ addeth also, that it is a sweete yoke & a light burden; wherby your obiection is taken away. Againe it is further signified, that there is a burden which greeueth not the bearer, but rather helpeth and refresheth the same; like as the burden of fethers vpon a birdes back, beareth vp the bird, and is nothing at al greeuoꝰ vnto her. So in like maner though it be a yoke, yet is it a sweete yoke, a comfortable yoke, a yoke more pleasant than hony or hony combe, as sayeth the Prophet. Psal. 118. And whie so? because we drawe therin, with a sweete yokefelow; we drawe with Christ him self; that is to say, Christes holie grace draweth at the one end of the yoke, and our endeuour at the other. And because when a great oxe and a litle doe drawe together in one yoke, the weight lieth al vpon the greater oxe his neeke, for that he beareth vp the yoke

from the other: therof it cometh, that we drawing in this yoke together with Christ, which is infinitly stronger and greater then we are; he lighteneth vnto vs the whole burden, and onelie requireth, that we should goe on comfortablie with him, and not refuse to ioyne and perseuer vnder this sweet yoke in his companie; for that the paines shalbe his, and the pleasure and profit ours. And this him self. Mat. 11. signifieth verie expreslie in the Ghospel, when he inuiteth al men that are heuelie The yoke of Christ deliuereth vs from many yokes. loden, to come vnto his yoke and he wil refreshe thē. Wherby he declareth plainly that his calling vs to the bearing of his sweet yoke, is onlie therby to disburden and ease vs, and not any waye to loden or agreeue vs: to disburden vs (I say) of the heauie loadinges packes and yokes of this world; as from the burden (for example) of a guiltie conscience, the burden of melancholie, the burden of enuie, hatred, and malice; the burden of pride, the burdē of ambition, the burden of couetousnes, the burden of wrath, the burden of feare, the burden of al wickednesse, and of hel fire it self. From al these burdens, lodinges, and miserable yokes, our most louing Saucour desireth to deliuer vs, by couering our neckes onelie with his yoke and burden, so lightned and sweetned by his holy grace; as the bearing therof is not trauailsome, but most easie, pleasant, iocunde, and comfortable. And thus much of the first and principal helpe that maketh the path

of vertuous life easie; I meane of Gods holie grace, inherēt in mans soule, which is the ofspring and fountaine of al other helpes that doe insue.
                  
                     THE SECOND thing that maketh this yoke so sweet, this burden so light, & THE. 2. helpe. VEHEMENcie of loue. this waie of Gods commaundementes so pleasant to resolued men, is vehemencie of loue; loue (I meane) towards God, whose commaundementes they are which we take in hand. For that euery mā can easelie tel, & hath experienced in him self, what an irresistable force the passion of loue conteineth, and how it maketh most facil the verie greatest paines that are in this world. What maketh (for examples sake,) the mother to take such incessant paine in the bringing vp of her child, & to indure with comfort so many trauailes as she doth, but onelie loue? what causeth the wife to fit so attentiue at the beds side of her husbande when he is sicke, but onelie loue? what moueth the beastes and birdes of the ayer, to spare from their owne foode, and to endaunger their own liues, for the feeding and defending of their litle ones, but onelie the great force and puissance of loue? See S. Aug. of this matter, ser. 9. de verb. dom. S. Austen doth prosecute this pointe at large by many other examples, as of Marchantes that refuse no aduenture of sea, for loue of gaine; of huntars, that refuse no season of euill weather, for loue of game; of soldiers, that refuse no danger of spoyle. And he addeth in the end: that if the loue of man can be

so great towardes creatures here, as to make great labours easie, and in deede to seeme no labours but rather pleasures: how much more shal the loue of good men towardes God make al their paines and trauailes comfortable, which they take in his seruice.
                  This extreme loue was the cause and reason, whie al the intollerable paines & The great force of loue betvvene Christ and his seruātes. afflictions which our Saue our Christ suffered for our sake, did seeme nothing vnto him. And this loue also was the reciprocal cause why so infinit trauailes and tribulations as zelous Christians from the beginning haue suffered for their Lord and Maister, seemed nothing vnto them. Imprisonmentes, tormentes, losse of honour, goodes, and life; haue seemed verie trifles to innumerable seruantes of God, in respect of this feruent and burning loue. This loue droue infinite virgines, and tender children to offer them selues in time of persecution, for zelous affection toward him, which in the cause was persecuted. This loue caused holie Apollonia of Alexandria, being broght to the fire, to slip Euseb. li. 6. c. 34. out of the handes of such as ledde her, and ioyfullie to runne into the same, of her self. This loue inforced blessed Ignatius, Ierom. in catalogo. the auncient Martir to saye (being condemned to beastes, and fearing least they would refuse his bodie, as they had done the bodies of diuers Martirs before him;) that he would not permit that; but would rather prouoke them to pulle and

teare his bodie in peeces.
                  Thes are the effectes (deare brother) of feruent loue; which doe make euen the The loue of Gods commādemētes. thinges that in this world are most difficult and dreadful of thē selues, to appeare verie facile sweete and pleasant; and much more the lawes and commaundementes of almightie God; which in them selues are most iust, reasonable, holie and easie. Da amantem (sayeth S. Austen speaking of this Psal. 6. & 18. Mat. 11. 1. Ioh. 5. Tra. 26. in Iohan. matter,) & sentit quod dico: Si autem frigido loquor, nescit quid loquar:  
                     Geue me a man that is in loue with God: and he feeleth this to be true, which I say: but if I talke to a cold Christian; he vnderstandeth not what I say. And this is the reason whie our blessed Saueour talking of the keeping of his commandementes; repeateth manie times this word, LOVE; as the onelie sure ground wheron their whole regard, reuerēce, & obseruation depēdeth; for want of which loue among men in this life; the most part of the world neither respecteth nor keepeth them. And herehence it is, that in the same our Saueour vseth thes and other like speeches; If you doe loue me; then keepe my 
                     Ioh. 14. 
                     commandementes: And againe, he that hath my commandementes, and keepeth them, he is he that loueth me. And yet further: He vvhich loueth me, vvil keepe my commandement; and he that loueth me not; keepeth not my commandementes. In which last wordes, some doe note, that to him that loueth he sayeth his commandement 
                     An obseruation. in the singular number; for that to such a one, al his commandmentes are but

one commandement, according to the saying of S. Paul; That loue alone is the fulfilling 
                     Rom. 13. 
                     of al the lavv, for that it comprehendeth al in al. But to him that loueth not, Christ saieth his commandmentes, in the plural number; signifying thereby, that they are both many and heauie to him; for that he wanteth loue, which should make them few and easie. The effect of which point, S. Iohn also expresseth, when he sayeth; this is the loue of God, vvhen vve keepe his commādementes, 
                     1. Io. 5. 
                     and his commandementes are not heauie. That is to say, they are notthing heauie to him, which hath loue; otherwise no maruaile though they be most heauie; for that euerie thing appeareth burdenous and intollerable, which we doe against our liking: and so by this also (deare Christian brother) thou maiest make a coniecture, whether the true loue of thie Lord and Saueour be in thee, or not.
                  
                     AND THESE ARE two meanes, THE. 3. helpe. PECVLIER light of vnderstāding. wherby the life of vertuous men is made easie in this world. There folow diuers other, to the end that thes negligent excusers may see, how vniust & vntrue their excuse is, concerning the pretended hardnes of liuing in Gods seruice. Which in verie deede is indued with infinit priuileges of cōfort, aboue the life of most prosperous sinners; euē in this world. Wherof the next that I wil name, for exāple sake, is a certaine special and peculiar light of vnderstanding, pertaining to the iust; and called in scripture prudentia sanctorum, the Prou. 9.
                     
wisdome of Saintes; which is nothing els, but a certaine sparkle of heauenlie wisdome, bestowed by singular priuilege vpō the vertuous, for their direction in this life; wherby they receaue most comfortable light and vnderstanding in spiritual affairs, touching their owne and other mens saluation, and in thinges necessarie therunto. Of which knowledge the prophet Dauid meant, whē he saied; 
                        not as mihi 
                        Psal. 16. 
                        fecisti vias vitae; thou hast made the waies of life knowen vnto me:  as also whē he said of him self; Super senes intellexi; I haue vnderstood Psal. 118. more then old men. And againe in an other place: 
                        Incerta & occulta sapientiae tuae 
                        Psal. 50. 
                        manisestasti mihi; thou hast opened to me the vnknowen and hidden secretes of thy wisdome. This is that most excellent light wherwith S. Iohn saieth that Christ our Ioh. 1. Saue our lighteneth his true seruantes; as also that vnction of the Holie Ghost, which the same Apostle teacheth to be 1. Io. 2. geuen to the godlie, thereby to instruct thē in al thinges behoofful for their saluation. This is in like maner that writing of Gods law in mens hartes, which he promised Iero. 31. Esa. 54. by the prophet Ieremie, so long agoe, to be performed in the time of grace; as also the instruction of men immediatlie from God him self, fortold by the prophet Esaye. And finallie, this is that soueraine vnderstanding in the law, commandementes, and iustifications of almightie God, which holy Dauid so much desired, and so often demānded in that most

diuine Psalme, which beginneth with this vehement protestatiō; Blessed are the vnsputted in the vvay; (that is, in this life;) and Psal. 118. 
                     blessed are al sucb as doe vvalke in Gods lavv.
                  
                  By this heauenlie light of vnderstanding, & by this supernal illumination imparted The great comfort of internal light. to the good, for their direction; the way of vertue is made very easie and passing comfortable. For as in bodilie sight and in viages of this world, it falleth out, that he which hath good eyes and seeth perfectelie, goeth on his way with far greater alacritie, ioy, & securitie, then doth an other that either lacketh that sense, or hath it very dimme: So in the course of our soule in this life, it is of no lesse importance and comfort but rather of much more, for a mā to haue this celestial vnderstānding for gouerning him self to his saluation; that is, to know what he doth, see wher he walketh, discerne wither he goeth, cōceaue what he expecteth; and to be in that happie state wherof S. Paul saith, that a spiritual ma is able 
                     1. Cor. 2. 
                     to iudge of al thinges. Whereas in the meane space the carnal and sensual man (as the same Apostle testifieth) is so blind, as he cā 
                     neither see nor conceaue tbe thinges that are of Gods spirit. Of which sort of men, the Prophet Esay saith in their owne person, expressing their miserie; vve haue groped like as 
                     Esa. 65. 
                     blinde men doe for the vvalle, and vve haue stumbled at middaye, euen as if it bad bene in darkenesse. By which wordes is set forth vnto vs the exceeding great calamitie of wicked

men, who see not wher they goe) what state they are in; how farr of, or how neare they are to perdition; but doe liue in continual darkenes, and most vncomfortable blindnes; which they cōfesse also in an other place of holie scripture saing; the light of iustice hath not shined vnto vs; and the sonne of vnderstanding hath not appeared 
                     Sap. 5. 
                     to our eyes; vve are vveried in the vvay of iniquities. The lacke then of this heuenlie light is wearisome & miserable vnto the wicked, and consequentlie the inioying therof, most comfortable to the vertuous.
                  
                     NOVV THEN to proceed; an other principal matter which maketh the waye THE. 4. helpe. INTERNAL consolatiō. of vertue easie and pleasant to them that walke therein, is a certaine hidden and secret consolation, which God-poureth into the hartes of them that trulle serue him. I call it secret and hidden; for that it is knowen to none but to such onelie as haue felt and receaued part therof. For which cause, Christ him self calleth it, Apoc. 2. 
                     hidden manna, knovven to them alone that doe inioye it. To which effect also the Prophet Dauid said to almightie God; Great is the multitude of thy svveetnes (o Lord) vvhich thou 
                     Psal. 30. 
                     haste laid up and hidden for them that feare thce. And againe in an other place, thou vvilt 
                     Psal. 67. 
                     laye aside (o Lord) a special chosen rayne or devve for thine inheritance. And almightie God him self promiseth to a denout soule by the Prophet Osee; I vvil leade her a side into a 
                     Osee 2. 
                     vvildernesse, and there vvil I talke vnto her hart; that is, I wil cōfort her. By al which

wordes, of vvildernesse, separating, choise. and hidden, is signified vnto vs, that this cō
                     solation is a secret priuilege bestowed onelie vpon the vertuous; and that the carnal hartes of wicked men, haue no parte or portion therin.
                  But now, how exceeding great and inestimable The force & svveetnes of this consolation. Psal. 35. & 64. the sweetnes of this heauenlie wine is to them that taste it; no tongue of man or angels can expresse. A certaine coniecture onlie may be made, by the wordes of holy Dauid, whoe attributeth vnto it sufficient force, to make al men drunke, that taste therof: that is to saie, to take from them, al sense and delectation in terrestrial pleasures, according as Peter whē he receaued but a drop or two therof vpon the mount Thabor at his Maisters Mat. 17. Marc. 9. Luc. 9. Psal. 35. transfiguratiō, forgate him self presentlie, and talked as a man distracted touching the building of tabernacles there, and restīg in that place for euer. This is, torrēs voluptatis, that sweet streame of pleasure, according Esa. 29. as the Prophet calleth it, which comming from the mountaines of heauē, watereth (by secret wayes and passages) the hartes and spirites of the godly, and maketh them drunken with the vnspeakable ioye which it deriueth vnto them. This is a kind of taste of the verie ioyes of heauen in this life, bestowed vpon good men, to comfort and encourage thē in their waye, and to keepe them from fainting. For as Marchants desirous to sel their wares, are content oftē times to let

you see & hādle, and some times also to taste A similitud expressing the cause vvhy God giueth this consolation. Apoc 3. the same if the nature therof so require, therby the sooner to induce you to buy: euen so almightie God being verie careful and willing to sel vnto vs the ioyes of heauen, is content to imparte a certaine taste before hand to such as he seeth are willing to buye, thereby to make them come of more roundlie with the price, & not to sticke to pay so much, yea more labour then he requireth. This is that exceding ioye and iubilie in the hartes of iust men, which the Prophet meaneth, when he saieth: The voice of exultation and saluation 
                     Psal. 117. 
                     is in the tabernacles of the iust. And againe, Blessed is that poople that knovveth iubilation. That is; that people which hath experienced this extreme ioye and pleasure of internal consolation. S. Paul had tasted it 2. Cor. 7. when he wrote these wordes, amiddest al his labours for Iesus Christ: I am filled vvith consolation, I ouerflovve and super abound in al ioye amiddest our tribulations. What can be spoken (deare brother) more effectuallie then this, to shew the diuine force of this spiritual consolation.
                  But thou wilt here aske me perhappes: if this be so, whie thou being a Christian The vvaye to come to spiritual cō
                        solation. as well as other, hast neuer vet tasted of this sweet consolation? wherunto I answere, that (as hath bene shewed before) this is not meate for euerie mouth; but a chosen moisture prouided for Gods inheritance 
                     Psa. 67. 
                     onelie. This is vvine of Gods ovvne seller, layed vp for his spouse alone: That is, for the deuout Can. 1.
                     
soule dedicated vnto Gods seruice. This is a teate of comfort, onelie for the child to sucke, as the prophet Esaye testifieth. The Esa. 66. soule that is drouned in sinful pleasures and delites of this world, can not be partaker of this rare benefite, neither the harte that is replenished with carnal cares and cogitations. For as Gods Arcke and 1. Reg. 5. Io. 8. 14. 15. 16. 1. Io. 2. Exo. 16. the idole Dagon could not stand together vpon one Aultar: so can not Christ and the world stand together in one harte. God sent not the pleasant Manna vnto the people of Israel so lōg as their flower and chibols of Egipt lasted: nether wil he send this heauenlie consolation vnto thee, (deare brother) vntil thou haue ridde thy self of the cogitations of vanitie. He is a wise marchant, though a liberal. He wil not geue a taste of his treasure, VVorldlie consolations & heauēlie stand not vvel together. where he knoweth there is no wil to buye. Resolue thy self once in deede to serue him, and thou shalt then feele thi heauenlie ioye wherof I talke, as many thousandes before thee haue done, and neuer yet any man was herein deceaued. Moyses first ranne out of Egipt, to the Exod. 2. hilles of Madian, before God appeared vnto him: and so must thy soule doe out of worldlie vanitie, before she can looke for these consolations.
                  But if thou wouldest resolue thie self effectually, & once offer thie self througly to his diuine seruice: then (no doubt) but thou shouldest finde most sweet and merciful intertainement aboue al expectatiō,

notwithstanding thy former euil life and Beginners chieflie cherished by God. sinnes whatsoeuer. For that such is the abūdāt goodnes of his diuine Maiestie, for encoraging of al mē to repaire vnto him; that he alwayes sheweth more particuler and tender loue towardes them that come newlie vnto his seruice, then vnto others Luc. 15. which haue serued him of longer time. Which is most euidentlie signified, by the parable of the prodigal sonne, whom the good father cherished with much more tendernes and sollicitude, then he did the elder brother, which had serued him continuallie. And the causes hereof are two; the one, for the ioye of the new gotten seruant, as is expressed by S. Luc in the Ghospel; the other, least he finding no consolatiō at the beginning, should turne back to Egipt againe; as God by a figure in the children of Israel declareth most manifestlie in these wordes: VVhen Pharao 
                     Exo. 13. 
                     had permitted the people of Israel to depart out of Egipt: God brought them not by the countrie of the Philistines, (vvhich vvas the nearest vvaye,) thinking vvith him self, lest perhappes it might repent them, if they should see vvarres streight vvay rise against them, & so should returne into Egipt againe. Behold here the cause whie almightie God would not presentlie permit warre and desolation to fal vpon his people, after they were departed out of Egipt, least they should repent them, and so turne backe again. What fatherlie hart Mat. 11. can expresse more tender & inflamed loue then this?
                  
                     
                     YET TO GOE foreward; after this THE. 5. helpe. THE peace of cōlciēce. 2. Cor. 1. priuilege of internal consolation, ensueth another, making the seruice of God also pleasant, and this is the testimonie of a good conscience; wherof blessed S. Paul made so great account, as he called it his glorie. And the Holie Ghost saieth of it further, by the mouth of the wise man; Secura mens quasi iuge conuiuium; a secure mind Pro. 15. and good consciēce is as a perpetual feast. Of which we may inferre, that the vertuous mā hauing alwaies this secure mind and peace of conscience, liueth alwaies in festiual ioye and ioiful feasting. And how then is this life hard or vnpleasant, as you imagine? On the contrary side, the wicked man, hauing his cōscience vexed with the priuitie & guilt of many sinnes, the same Gen. 4. 1. Mac. 6. Mat. 27. Act. 1. Marc. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . is alwaies tormented with in it self; as we reade that the conscience of wicked Cain was, after he had slain his own brother; and of Antiochus for his wickednesse done to Ierusalem; and of Ludas for his treason against his maister; as our Saueour also doth signifie generallie of al naughtie men, when he saieth that they haue a worme that gnaweth their consciences both day and night. The reason wherof, the holie scripture openeth in an other place, when it saieth, al vvickednesse is sul of 
                     Sap. 7. 
                     feare, geuing testimonie of damnation against it self; and therfore a troubled conscience alvvaies presumeth cruel matters: That is to say; it presumeth cruel thinges to be imminent ouer itself, as it maketh account to haue deser-

ued. But yet further, aboue al other, holie Iob most liuelie setteth furth this miserable state of wicked mens consciences in thes wordes: A vvicked man is proued al the dayes of his life, though the time be vncertaine hovv long he shal playe the tyrant. The sound of 
                     
                        Iob. 15. The trouble of an euil conscience. 
                     terrour is alvvaies in his eares; and although it be in time of peace, yet he alvvay suspecteth some treason against him. He beleeueth not that he can rise againe from darknesse to light, expecting on euery side the svvord to come upon him. VVhen he sitteth doune to eate, he remembreth that the day of darknesse is redy at hand for him: tribulation terrefieth him, and anguish of minde enuironeth him, euen as a king is enuironed vvith soldiars, vvhen he goeth to vvarre.
                  
                  Can any thing be expressed more effectuallie (louing brother) then this matter is here let doune by holie writ it self? what creature may be imagined more miserable The saying of S. Chrisostom of a vvicked conscience. Hom. 8. ad pop. ant.
                      and pittiful than this man, which hath such a boucherie and slaughter house within his owne brest and harte? what feares, what anguishes, what desperatiōs are here declared? S. Chrisostome discourseth most excellentlie vpō this point. Such is the custome of sinners, (sayeth he) that they suspect al thinges, in so much as they doute their owne shadowes; they are afeard at euery litle noise, and they thinke euery man that cometh towardes them, to come against them. If men talke together, they thinke they speake of their sinnes. Such a thing is sinne, as it bewrayeth it self, though no man accuse it: It

holdeth alwayes the sinner in extreme feare, albeit ther be no appearance of any danger to wardes hi. Heare how notablie holy writ describeth this feare of sianers & the iust mās libertie. The vvicked man flieth 
                        Pro. 28. 
                        though no man pursue him. And whie doeth he flie if no man pursue him? for that he hath within his owne conscience an accuser that doth pursue him, the which accuser he alwayes carieth aboute with him. And as he can not flie from him self: so cā he not flie from this accuser that resteth within his conscience; but where soeuer he goeth, he is pursued beaten and whipped by the same, and his wounde is incurable. But the iust man is nothing so: The iust man (saveth Salomon) is as consident as a 
                        Pro. 28. 
                        lion.
                     Hitherto are the wordes of S. Chrisostome.
                  
                     VVHERBY, AS also by the scriptures THE. 6. helpe. CONFIdent hope. before alleaged, we take notice yet of an other prerogatiue of vertuous life, which is a most liuelie hope or cōfidence of eternal saluation, this being one of the greatest treasures and richest Iewels that Christian men haue left them in this life. For by this we passe through al afflictiōs, al tribulations and aduersities, most ioyfullie. By this we say with S. Paul; VVe doe 
                     Iac. 5. Rom. 5. 
                     glorie in our tribulations, knovving that tribulation vvorketh patience, and patience proofe, & proofe hope vvhich consoundeth vs not. This is our most strong and mightie comfort; this is our sure ankor in al our most tēpestuous times and stormes, according as the same

holie Apostle auoucheth, when he saith; Heb. 6. 
                     that it is a most strong solace and comfort vnto vs, when we make our refuge to the hope that is proposed by God that can not lie, which hope we hold as the sure & infallible anker of our soule. This is that Ephe. 6. 1. The. 5. noble helmet of saluation, as the same Apostle calleth it, which beareth of al the blowes that this world can laye vpon vs. And finallie, this is the onelie rest set vp in the harte of a vertuous man; that, come life, or come death; come health, or come sickenesse; come wealth, or come pouertie; come prosperitie, or come aduersitie; come neuer so violent seas and waues of persecution; he fitteth doune quietlie, and sayeth calmelie with the Prophet; my trust 
                     Psal. 55. 
                     is in God, and therfore I feare not vvhat flesh can doe vnto me. Nay further with holy Iob, amiddest al his miseries, he singeth this most confident dittie; si occiderit me, in ipso sperabo; if God should kil me, yet would I Iob. 13. put my trust in him. And this is (as the scripture sayed before) to be as confident as a Lion; whose propertie is, to shew most courage, when he is in greatest peril, and neare vnto most troubles.
                  But now, as the holy Ghost sayeth, non sic impij, non sic. The wicked can not saie Psal. 1. thus, they haue no parte in this cōfidence, no interest in this consolation: Quia spes 
                     Pro. 10. 
                     impiorum peribit, sayeth the scripture: the hope of wicked men is vaine, and shall perish. And againe, praestolatio impiorum furor, 
                     Pro. 11. the expectation of wicked men is furie.

And yet further, spes impiorum abhominatio animae: The hope of wicked men is abhomination, Iob 11. and not a comfort vnto their soule. And the reason hereof is double. First, for that in verie deed (though they The vaine hope of vvicked men, say the contrarie in wordes) wicked mē doe not put their hope and confidence in God, but in the world, in their riches, in their strength, friendes, and authoritie; & finallie in the deceauing arme of man: euen as the prophet expresseth in their persone, Iere. 17. when he sayeth: VVe haue put a lye for our hope: That is, we haue put our hope in Esa. 28. thinges transitorie, which haue deceaued vs. And this is yet more expressed by the scripture, saying: the hope of vvicked men is as 
                     Sap. 5. 
                     chasse, vvhich the vvinde blovveth avvay: and as a buble of vvater vvhich a storme disperseth: and as the smoke vvhich the vvinde blovveth abrode: and as the remembrance of a guest that stayeth but one day in his inne. By al which metaphores, the Holie Ghost expresseth vnto vs, both the vanitie of the thinges wherein in deed the wicked doe put their trust; and how the same faileth them, after a litle time, vpon euery smal occasion of aduersitie that falleth out.
                  This is that also which God meaneth, when he so stormeth & thundreth against those which goe into Egypt for helpe, & Esa. 30. & 36. doe put their confidence in the strength of Pharao, accurfing them for the same, & promising, that it shal turne to their owne confusion: which is properlie to be vnderstoode Iere. 17. 48. of all those, which put their

cheef confidence in worldlie helpes; as al wicked men doe, whatsoeuer they say or dissemble to the contrarie. For which cause also of dissimulation, they are called hypocrites by Iob: for where as the wiseman saieth, the hope of vvicked men shal perish: Iob saieth, the hope of hypocrites 
                     Pro. 10. Iob. 8. 
                     shal perish, calling wicked men hypocrites: for that they say, they put their hope in God, where as in deede they put it in the world. Which thing, not only Scripture, but also experience teacheth. The vvicked mans hope is not in God. For with whom doeth the wicked man consult in his affaires and doubtes? with God principallie, or with the world? to whom doeth he seeke in his afflictions? whom doeth he cal vpon in his sickenes? from whom hopeth he to receiue comfort in his aduersities? to whom yeeldeth he thankes in his prosperities? When a worldly man taketh in hande any worke of importance, doeth he first consult with God, about the euent thereof? doeth he fal downe on his knees, and aske his aide? doeth he referre it wholie or principallie vnto his honour? if he doe not; how can he hope for aide therein at his hādes? how can he repaire to hym for assistance in the daungers and lettes that fal out about the same? how can he haue any cō
                     fidence in hym, which hath no part at al in that woorke? It is hypocrisie then (as Iob truely saieth) for this man to affirme that his confidence is in God: whereas in deede it is in the world, it is in Pharao, it

is in Egypt, it is in the arme of man, it is in a lie. He buildeth not his house with the wise man, vpon a rocke: but with the foole, vpon the sandes: and therfore (as Christ wel assureth him) vvhen the rayne 
                     Mat. 7. 
                     shal come and studdes descend, & vvindes blovv, & al together shal rush vpō that house (which shalbe at the hower of his death:) thē shal this house sal, & the sal of it shalbe great. Great, The sal of a vvicked mans house. for the great chaunge which he shal see: great, for the great horrour which he shal conceaue: great, for the great miserie which he shal suffer: great, for the vnspeakable ioyes of heauen lost: great, for the eternal paines of hel incurred: great euery way assure thy self (deare brother) or els the mouth of God would neuer haue vsed this word, Great. And this is sufficiēt for the first reason, why the hope of wicked men is vaine; for that in deede they put it not in God, but in the world.
                  The second reason is; for that, albeit they should put their hope in God, yet VVicked men can not kept in God. (liuing wickedlie) it is vaine and rather to be called presumption, than hope. For vnderstanding wherof, it is to be noted, that as there are two kindes of faithes recounted in holy scripture, the one a Iacob. 2. Mat. 7. 1. Co. 13. & 15. deade faieth without good woorkes; that is, which beleeueth al you say of Christ, but yet obserueth not his commaundementes: the other a liuelie, & iustifying faieth, which beleeueth not onelie, but Rom. 1. Gal 3. Ephe. 2. also woorketh by charitie, as S. Paules woordes are: So are there two hopes folowing

these two faithes: the one of the good, proceeding of a good conscience, where of I haue spoken before: the other of the wicked, resting in a guiltie conscience, which is in deede no true hope, but rather presumption. This S. Iohn proueth 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 3. plainlie, when he saieth: Brethren if our hart reprehend vs not, then haue vve confidēce vvith God: That is, if our harte be not guiltie of wicked life. And the wordes immediatlie folowing doe more plainly expresse the same, which are these: VVhat so euer vve aske, vve shal receaue of hym, for that vve keepe his commaundementes, and doe those thinges vvhich are pleasing in his sight. The same 1. Ti. 1. confirmeth S. Paule, when he saieth, that the end of Gods commaundementes is charitie, frō a pure harte and a good conscience. Which wordes S. Austen expounding in diuers places of his workes, proueth at large, that without a good conscience, there can no true hope be conceaued. S. Paul (saieth he) addeth (from a good conscience) because of 
                     2. Austens saing of hope. lib. 1. de doct. chri. cap. 37. 
                     hope: for he vvhich hath the scruple of an euil conscience, dispareth to attaine that vvhich he beleeueth. And againe. Euery mans hope is in his ovvne conscience, according as he feeleth hym self to loue God. And againe in an other booke, the Aposlle putteth a good conscience for hope: for he onelie hopeth vvhich hath a good conscience: 
                     In prafat. Psal. 31. 
                     and he vvhom the guilt of aneuil conscience doeth pricke, retireth backe from hope, and hopeth nothing but his ovvne damnatiō. I might here repeate a great many more priuileges, & prerogatiues of a vertuous life, which

make the same easie, pleasant, and comfortable, but that this chapiter groweth to be long: and therfore I wil onelie touche (as it were in passing bie) two or three other pointes of the most principal: vvhich notwithstāding would require large discourses to declare the same, according to their dignities.
                  
                     THE FIRST wher of is, the inestimable priuilege of libertie & freedome, which THE. 7. helpe. FREEDOM; of mind. Ioh. 8. the vertuous doe enioy aboue the wicked, accordig as Christ, pmiseth i thes words: If you abide i my cōmademēts, you shalbe my scholers in deed, & you shal knovv the truth, and the truth shal set you free: Which wordes S. Paul as it were expounding, saieth; vvhere the 
                     2. Co. 3. 
                     spirit of our Lord is, there is freedome. And this freedome is meant, from the tyranny and thraldome of our corrupt sensualitie and concupisēce, called by diuines the inferior parte of our minde: whereunto the wicked are so in thraldome, as neuer was any bondslaue more to a most mercilesse cruel and bloody tyrant. This in part may be conceaued by this one example.
                  If a man had married a riche, beautiful, and noble gentlevvoman, adorned with An exāple expressing the bōdage of vvicked men giuē to sensualitie. al induments which might be deuised or desired in that sexe: and yet notwithstanding should be so sotted & entangled with the loue of some foule and dishonest begger, or seruile maide of his house, as for her sake to abandone the company & friendship of his saied wife, to spende his time in daliance and seruice of this base

houswife: to rūne, to goe, to stād stil at her appointment: to put al his liuing and reuenues into her handes, for her to consume and spoile at her pleasure: to deny her nothing, but to waite and serue her at a becke: yea and to compel his saide wife to doe the same: wolde you not think this mans life miserable and most seruile? And yet surely the maner of seruitude whereof we talke, is farre greater and more intolerable than this. For no woman or other creature in this world, is, or can be of that beautie or nobilitie that ladie Reason is, to whom mā by his creatiō was espoused: which notwithstanding we see abandoned, contemned and reiected by hym, for the loue of Sensualitie, her hand-maid, & a most deformed creature in respect of reason: in whose loue notwithstanding or rather seruitude, we see wicked men so drouned, as they serue her day and night with al paines, perils, and expenses; and doe constraine also reason her self, to be subiect to al the beckes and commaundementes of this new tirannical and vile mistresse. For, wherefore doe they labour? wherefore doe they watch? wherfore doe they heape riches together, but onelie to serue their sensualitie, & her desirs? wherfore do they beate their braines, but onelie to satisfie this cruel tyrant and her passions?
                  And if you wil see in deed how cruel and pitiful this seruitude is: consider only some particular examples of the same.

Take a man whom she ouerruleth in any The miserie of a man ruled by sensualitie. passion: as for example, in the lust of the flesh: what paines taketh he for her? how doeth he labour, how doeth he drudge in this seruitude? how potent and strong doeth he feele her tyrānie? Remember the strength of Samson, the wisdome of Salomon, 2. Re. 11. Iud. 14. the sanctitie of Dauid ouerthrowen by this tyrannie. Iupiter, Mars, and Hercules, 3. Re. 11. who for their valiāt actes otherwise, were accounted godes of the Panimes: were they not ouercome, and made slaues by the enchantement of this tyrant? And if you wil yet further see of what strēgth she is, and how cruellie she executeth the same vpon those, that Christ hath not deliuered from her bondage: consider (for examples sake in this kinde) the pitiful case of some disloyal wife, who though she know that by committing adulterie, she runneth into a thousand dangers and inconueniences; as the losse of Gods fauour, the hatred of her husband, the danger of punishment, the offence of her friendes, the vtter dishonour of her persone (if it be knowen;) and finallie, the ruine and peril of bodie and soule: yet to satisfie this tyrant, she wil venture to commit the sinne, notwithstanding any dangers or perilles whatsoeuer.
                  Nether is it onelie in this one point of carnal lust, wherin sensuality hath such An ambitious man. tirānical dominatiō ouer thē that enthral théselues vnto her, but also in euery other passiō. Looke vpon an ambitious or vainglorious

man: see how he serueth this mistresse, with what care & diligence he attendeth her commaundementes; which is no other, but to folowe after a litle wynde of mens mouthes, to pursue a litle fether flying before him in the ayer. You shal see that he omitteth no one thing, no one time, no one circūstance for gayning therof. He riseth early, goeth late to bedd, trotteth by daye, studieth by night; here he flattereth, there he dissembleth, here he stoupeth there he looketh bigge; here he maketh freends, there he preuenteth enemies; and to this onely end he referreth al his actions, and applieth al his other matters, al his order of life, his cō
                     panie keeping, his sutes of apparell, his house, his table, his horses, his seruantes, his talke, his behauiour, his iestes, his lookes, & his verie going in the streete.
                  In like wise he that serueth this Beldame in the passiō of couetousnesse; what A couetous man. a miserable slauerie doth he abyde: his harte being so mured in prison with money, as he must onelie thinke thereof, talke therof, dreame therof, and imagin onelie new waies to get the same, and nothing else. If you should see a Christian man in slauerie vnder the great Turke, tyed in a galley by the legg with chaines, there to serue by rowing for euer: you could not but take compassion of his case. And what then shal we doe of the miserie of this man, whoe standeth in captiuitie to a more base creature, than is a Turke, or

anie other reasonable creature; that is, to a peece of metal, in whose prison he lieth bound, not onelie by the feete, in suche sort, as he may not goe anie where, against the commoditie and commaundement of the same; but also by the handes, by the mouthe, by the eyes, by the eares, and by the harte: so as he may nether doe, speake, see, heare, or thinke any thing, but in seruice of the same? Was there euer seruitude so greate as this? doeth not Christ saye Ioh. 8. Rom. 6. 2. Pet. 2. truely now, qui facit peecatū seruus est peccati; He that committeth sinne is a slaue vnto sinne? doeth not S. Peter say wel,  
                        A quo quis superatus est, huius & seruus est; A man is a flaue to that, wherby he is conquered?
                  
                  From this slauerie then are the vertuous deliuered, by the power of Christ, and by The libertie a man hath by serning God. his assistance; in so muche, as they rule ouer their passions and sensualite, and are not ruled thereby. This God promised by the prophet Ezechiel, saing. And they sbal knovv, that I am their Lord, vvhen I shal breake 
                     Eze. 34. 
                     the chaines of their yoke, and shal deliuer them from the povver of those, that ouerruled them before. And this benefit holie Dauid ackowleged in himself, when he vsed these moste affectuous wordes to almightie God. O Lorde I am thy seruant, I am thy seruant; 
                     Psal. 90. 
                     & the childe of thy hand-mayde; thou hast broken my bandes, and I vvil sacrifice to the, a sacrifice of praise. 
                     This benefit also acknowledged S. Paul, when he sayed, that our olde man was crucified, to the end the bodie of sinne Rom. 6. might be destroyed, & we be no more

in seruitude to sinne; vnderstanding by the olde man, and the bodie of sinne, our concupiscence, mortified by the grace of Christ in the vertuous.
                  
                  
                     THE. 8. helpe. PEACH of mind. 
                     AFTER THIS priuilege of freedome, foloweth an other, of no lesse importance then this; and that is, a certaine heauenlie peace, serenitie and tranquilitie of minde, according to the saying of the Psa. 75. Psa. 118. prophet: Factus est in pace locus eius, his place is made in peace. And in an other place: 
                        Pax multa diligentibus legem tuam, there is great peace to them that loue thy law. And on the cōtrary side, the prophet Esay repeateth this sentēce oftètimes from the mouth of almightie God him self, Non est 
                     Esa. 48. 57. 
                     pax impijs dicit dominꝰ; Our Lord God auoucheth, that there is no peace vnto the wicked. And an other prophet saieth of the Psal. 13. same men, Contrition and infelicitie is in their vvaies, and they haue not knovven the vvay of peace. The reason of this difference hath bene declared heretofore; wheras I set downe the diuersitie of good and euil men, touching their passions. For the vertuous hauing now (by the aide of Christs holy grace) subdued their said passions, doe passe on their life most sweetly and calmely vnder the guide of reason, without any perturbatiòs that indanger them in the greatest occurrents of this miserable life. But the wicked not hauing mortified Rom. 11. any part of the said passions, are tossed and tombled with the same, as with vehement and contrary windes. And therfore

their state is compared by Esay to a Esa. 57. tempestuous sea, that neuer is quiet; and by S. Iames, to a citie or countrie, where the 
                        Iac. 3. Tvvo causes of disquietnes in vvicked men. inhabitantes are at warre and sedition among them selues. And the causes here of are two: first, for that thes passions of cō
                     cupiscence being many and almost infinit in number, doe lust after infinit thinges, and are neuer satisfied, but are like thos bloodsuckers which the wise man speaketh Pro. 30. of, that crie alwaies Geeue Geeue, and neuer say, Hoe. As for example, tel me, when is the ambitious man satisfied with honour? or the incontinent man with carnalitie? or the couetous man with money? neuer truelie; and therfore as that mother can not but be greatlie afflicted which should haue many children crying to her at once for meate, she hauing no bread at A similitude. al or not sufficient to breake vnto them; so the wicked man being greedilie called vpon without ceasing, by almost infinit passions, to yeld vnto their desires; must needes be vexed and pitifullie tormēted, especiallie being not able to satisfie any one of the least of their petitions.
                  An other cause of vexation in thes mē 
                     The. 2. cause. is, for that thes passions of disordinate concupiscence, be oftentimes contrarie the one to the other, and doe demāde most opposite and contrarie thinges, representing vnto vs most liuelie the confusion of Babel; where one tongue spake against an Gen. 11. other, and that in diuerse and contrarie languages. So we see oftentimes that the

desire of honour saieth to his maister, spend here: but the passion of auarice saieth, hold thy handes: Lecherie saieth, venture here: But pride saieth; No, it may turne thee to dishonour. Anger saieth, reuenge thy self here: but ambition saieth, it is better to dissemble. And finallie, here is fulfilled that which the Psal. 54. prophet saieth; vidi iniquitatem & contradictionem in ciuitate; I haue seene iniquitie and contradictiō in the self same citie; Iniquitie, for that al the demandes of thes passions are most vniust, for so much as they are against reason her self: Contradictiō; for that one contradicteth the other in their demandes. From al which miseries God hath deliuered the iuste by geuing Phil. 4. them his peace, vvhich passeth al vnderstanding, 
                     Ioh. 14. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . as the Apostle saieth; and which the world can nether geue nor taste of, as Mat. 10. Christ hym self affirmeth.
                  And thus many causes may be alleaged now (besides many other which I passe ouer) to iustifie the veritie of our Saue ours wordes, affirming that his yoke is svveet and easie; to wit, the assistance of grace, the loue of God, the light of vnderstanding, the internal consolation, the quiet of cō
                     science, the confidēce therof proceeding, the libertie of soule and bodie, with the sweet rest and peace of our spirites, both towardes God, our neighbours, and our selues. By al which meanes, helpes, priuileges and singuler benefites, the vertuous are assisted aboue the wicked, as hath bene shewed; and their way made easie,

light and pleasant.
                  
                     TO AL VVHICH yet we may adioine THE. 9. Reason. EXPEctation of revvard. one other great priuilege as the last but not the least comfort to them that walke vnder the yoke of Christs seruice; and this is, the promise and most assured expectation of reward; to wit, of eternal glorie and felicitie to the good; and of euerlasting damnation and tormētes vnto the wicked. O good God, what a matter is this, to comfort the one, if their life were paineful; and to afflict the other, amiddest their greatest. pleasures and swetest delectations? The labourer when he thinketh of his good paye at night, is encouraged to goe thorough with the heat of the day though it be painful vnto hym. Two that An example. should passe together towardes their countrie, the one to receaue honour for good seruice done abrod, th' other as prisoner to be arraigned of treasons, committed in forraine dominions, against his Soueraigne; could not be alike merie in their inne vpon the way. For albeit he that stood in danger should sing, or make shew of courage and comfort, and set a good face vpon the matter, yet th' other might wel thinke that his hart had many a cold pul within hym; as no doubt but al wicked men haue, when they think with themselues, of the life to come. If Ioseph and Pharaos baker had knowē both their distinct lottes in prison; to wit, that on such a day, one should be called furth to Gen. 40. 41. 43. be made Lord of Egypt, and th' other to be

hanged vpon a paire of new gallowes: they could hardly haue bene alike merie whiles they liued together in the time of their imprisonmēt. The like may be sayed, and much more truely, of vertuous and wicked men in this world. For when the one sorte doe but thinke vpon the day of death, which to thē is to be the day of their deliuerance from this prison; their hartes can not but leape for verie ioye, considering what is her after to ensew vnto thē. But th' other are afflicted and doe fal into melancholie and extreme desolation, as oftē as mention or remembrāce of death is offered; for that they are sure, that it bringeth with it their eternal bane, according as holy scripture saieth; The vvicked mā being dead, there remaineth no more hope vnto hym. 
                     Pro. 11.
                  
                  Wel then (deare Christian brother) if al thes thinges be so; what should stay thee now at length to make this resolution, wherunto I exhort thee? wilt thou yet say (notwithstanding al this) that the matter is hard, and the way vnpleasant? or wilt thou beleeue others that tel the so, albeit they know lesse of the matter then thy self? Beleeue rather the word and promisse of thy Sauiour Christ, which assureth Mat. 11. thee the contrarie. Beleeue the reasons before alleaged, which doe proue it most euidentlie. Beleeue the testimonies of them which haue experienced the matter in them selues, as king Dauid, S. Paul, S. Iohn Euangelist, and others whos testimonies I haue alleaged before, cōcerning

their owne proofe. Beleeue many hundredes, which by the holy grace of God, are conuerted day lie in Christendome frō vicious life, to the perfect seruice of their Lord; al which doe protest that them selues haue found much more facilitie and comfort, thē ether I haue said in this place, or can say in the matter.
                  And for that perhaps thou mayest replie, The testimonie of such as haue had experience in them selues. that such men as haue experiēced this in them selues, are not now liuing in the place wher thou art, to geue this testimonie of their owne experience: I can and doe assure thee vpon my consciēce before almightie God, that I haue had conserēce with no smal number of such persons my self, and that to my singuler comfort, in beholding the strong hand and exceeding bountifulnesse of Gods sweetnes towards them in this case. Oh deare brother; no tongue can expresse what I haue seene herin; and yet sawe I not the least part of that which they inwardly felte. But yet this may I say, that they that attend in the Catholique Church Here Bun, is inforced to mangle extremly. to deale with soules in the holy sacrament of Confession, are in deed thos, of whom the prophet saieth, that they vvorke in multitudes of vvaters, and doe see the maruailes of God in the 
                     Psa. 106. 
                     depth; In the depth (I say) of mens conscieuces vttered with infinit multitudes of teares, whē God toucheth the same with his holy grace. Beleeue me (good reader,) for I speake in truth before our Lord IESVS, I haue seene so great and exceeding

consolations in diuers great sinners after their conuersion, as no hart can almost cō
                     ceaue; and the hartes which receaued thē, were hardlie able to-containe the same: so abundātlie distilled doune that heauē
                     lie dewe from the most liberal and bounteful hand of God. And that this may not seme strange vnto thee; thou must know, that it is recorded of one holy man called Effrem, that he had so maruailous great Vide pratam spirituale SS. Patrum. consolations after his conuersion, as he was often constrained to crie out to God: O Lord retire thy hand from me a litle, for that my hart is not able to receaue so extreme ioye. And the like is writen of S. Bernard; who for a Gosr. invita Bern. certaine time after his conuersiō from the world, remained as is it were depriued of his senses, by the excessiue consolations he had from God.
                  Houbeit, if al this can not moue thee, but that thou wilt stil remaine in thy distrust: heare the testimonie of one, whom I am sure thou wilt not for shame discredit, especially speaking of his owne experience; And this is the holie martyr and doctor S. Cyprian, who writing of the Li. cp. 1. verie same matter to a secret frend of his called Donatus, confesseth that he was before his conuersion, of the same opiniō that thou art now; to wit, that it was impossible for him, to chaunge his maners, & to sinde such comfort in a vertuous life, as after he did, being accustomed before to al kinde of loose behauiour. Therfore he beginneth his narration to his friend

in this sort; Accipe quod sentitur antequant discitur, &c. 
                     Take that which is first felte before it be learned;  and so he foloweth on with a large discourse; shewing, that he proued now by experience, which he could neuer beleeue before his cōuersion, albert almightie God had promised the same. The like writeth S. Augustine of him selfe in his bookes of confession, shewing Li. 6. confess. c. 12. that his owne passions & the deuil wold needes persuade him, before his conuersion, that he should neuer be able to abyde the austeritie of a vertuous life: especiallie touching continencie in the sinnes of the flesh (wherin he had liued wantonlie, vntil that time;) it seemed to him vnpossible that he coulde euer abandon the said sinne, and liue chaste; which notwithstanding he afterwards found both easie, pleasant, and without al difficultie. For which he breaketh into these wordes, Li. 8. confess. ca. 1. Psa. 34. directed vnto almightie God him self; O my Lord let me remēber & confesse thy mercies towardes me; let my verie bones reioyse and saye vnto thee, O lord vvho is like vnto thee? thou hast broken my chaines, and 
                     Psa. 115. 
                     I vvil sacrifice to thee a sacrifice of thankes geuing. Thes chaines which the blessed man mentioneth; were the chaines of concupiscence, wherby he stoode bounden in captiuitie before his conuersion, as he there confesseth; but presentlie thervpon, he was deliuered of the same, by the blessed helpe of Gods most holie grace.
                  My counsaile should be therfore vnto

thee (gentle reader) that seing thou hast The cōclusion of this first part. so many testimonies, exāples, reasons, and promises of this matter; thow shouldest at least, proue once, by thine owne experience, whether this thing be true or no; especiallie seing it is a matter of so great importance, and so worthie thy trial: that is to say, a matter concerning so neare thy eternal saluation as it doth. If a meane felowe should come vnto thee, and offer for hazarding of one crowne of golde, to make thee a thowsand by Alchimie; albeit A similitude. thou shouldest suspect him for a cousiner, yet the hope of gayne being so great, and the aduēture of losse so smal: thou wouldest goe nigh for once, to venture and see the trial. And how much more shouldest thow doe it then in this case, where by proofe thow canst leese nothing; and if thou speede wel, thou art sure to gaine as much as Gods kingdome and the euerlasting ioye of heauen is worth. And thus much for this first part.

                  ANd now, albeit this great affaire be such as I haue declared before, and nothing so as the world and Satan doe beare men in hand: yet may not I let passe in this place (deare Christian brother) to admonishe thee of one thing, which the ancient Fathers and saintes of God

that haue passed ouer this riuer before Resistance at the beginning. thee (I meane the riuer deuiding betwene Gods seruice and the world) doe affirme of their owne experience; and that is, that as soone as thow takest this worke or resolution in hand, thow must expect many great encounters, strong impedimentes, sharpe contradictions, and fearce temptations: thow must expect assaultes, combates, and open warre within thy self.

This dothe Saint Hillarie proue both by reasons and examples. This dothe the scripture it self forewarne thee when it saith, My sonne, vvhen thou art to come to the seruice of God, stand fast in iustice and in feare, and prepare thy minde vnto temptation. And the reason of this is; for that the deuil possessing quietlie thy soule before, laye stil, and sought onelie meanes to cōtent the same, by daily suggesting new delites of carnal and worldly pleasures. But when he seeth that thow offerest to goe from him; he beginneth streight wayes to rage, and to moue sedition within thee, and to tosse vp and downe bothe heauen and earthe, before he wil leese his kingdome in thy soule. This is euident by the example of him whom our Sauiour Christ, cō

seeme nether to heare nor speake, while he possessed that bodie quietlie: yet when Christ commaunded him to goe out; he bothe heard and cried out, and did so teare and rent that poore bodie, before he departed, as al the standers by thought in deede that he had bene dead. This also in figure was shewed, by the storie of Laban, who neuer persecuted his sonne in law Iacob, vntil he would needes depart Gen. 31. from him. And yet was this more plainly expressed in the doinges of Pharao, who after once he perceaued that the people of Israel meant to departe his kingdome, neuer ceassed greeuouslie to afflict them (as Moyses testifieth) vntil God had vtterlie deliuered them out of his handes, with Exod. 5. the ruyne and destruction of al their enemies. Which euent al holie doctors and saintes in Gods church, haue expounded to be a plaine figure of the deliuerie of soules from the tirannie of the deuil.
                  And now if thou wouldest haue a liuelie example of al this that I haue sayed before, I could alleage thee many; but for The conuersion of S. August. breuities sake, one onelie of S.

And surelie whosoeuer shal but reade the whole at large, especialie in his sixth, seuenth and eigth bookes of his confessions, shal greatlie be moued & instructed therby. And I beseeche the reader that

vnderstandeth the latine tongue, to vewe ouer at least but certaine chapiters of the eigth booke, where this Saints final conuersion (after infinit combates) is recounted. It were to long to repeate al here, though in deede it be such matter, as no mā could euer be wearie to heare it. There he sheweth, how he was tossed and tombled in this conflict betwene the fleshe & the spirite; betwne God drawing on one side; and the world, the flesh, and the deuil holding backe on the other parte. He went to Simplicianus a learned old man Li. 8. cōfess. c. 1. & 2. & a deuout Christian: he went to S. Ambrose bishop of Milan; and after his cō

One daye after dinner there came into his house, 2 Christian Cap. 6. courtier and capitaine named Potinian, Al this storie Bun. cutteth out, sauing certaine ragges of his ovvne making. and finding by chance S.

Which storie after Augustin had heard; as also, that there was a monasterie A Monasterie of monkes as Millan before S. August. time. of those monkes, without the walles of Millā, (in which Citie this happened) &

that they were nourished by S. Ambrose Cap. 7. the bishope (wherof Augustine before this, knew nothing;) he was much more afflicted then before: and after Potinian was departed, withdrawing him self a side, had a most terrible combate with him self, wherof he writeth thus. What did I not say against my self in this conflict? how did I beate and whyppe my owne soule, to make her folow thee (ô lord?) But she held backe, she refused, & excused her self; and when al her argumentes were conuicted, she remained in horrour and feare as of death, to be restrained from her loose custome of sinne, wherby she had now consumed her self euen vnto death. After this he went into a garden with Alipius, his companiō, Cap. 8. and there cried out vnto him.  
                        Quid hoc est? quid patimur? surgunt indocti & caelum rapiunt; & nos cum doctrinis nostris, sine corde, ecce vbi volutamur in carne & saaguine. What is this? (Alipius) what suffer we vnder the tyrā

And he goeth forward in that place, shewing the wonderful and almost incredible tribulations that he had in this fight, that daie. After this, he went further into an orcharde, and there he had Marke this gentle reader. yet a greater cōflict. For there, al his pleasures past represented thē selues together before his eyes, saying vnto him?

And then (saieth S. Augustin) O Lord, turne from the mind of thy seruant, to think of that filth which they obiected to my soule. What filth, what shameful pleasures did they lay before mine eyes? At length he saieth that after long and tedious combats a maruailous tempest Cap. 12. of weeping came vpon him; & being not able to resist any longer, he ranne away from Alipius, and cast hym self vpon the ground vnder a figge tree, and gaue ful scope vnto his eies, which brought forth presentlie whole fluddes of teares. Which after they were a litle past ouer; he began to speake to God in this sort: 
                        Et tu domine, 
                        Li. 8. c. 12. 
                        vsquequo? quam diu? quam diu, cras, & cras? quare non modo? quare non hac hora finis est turpitudinis meae? O Lord, how long wilt thou suffer me thus? how long, how long shal I saye to morow, to morow? why should I not doe it now? whie should there not be an end of my filthie life, euen at this instant? And after this foloweth his final & miraculous conuersion, together with the conuersion of Alipius, his companion; which because it is set downe breeflie by him self, I wil recite his owne wordes, which are, as foloweth immediatlie vpon those that went before.
                  
                      I did talke (saith he) in this sorte to

almightie God, and did weepe most bitterlie, S. August. final cōuersion by a voice from heauen. with a deepe contrition of my hart; and behold, I heard a voyce, as if it had bene of some child singing from some house nere vnto me, and oftentimes it repeated thes wordes, take vp and read; take vp and read. And streight waies, I chāging my countenance, began to think most earnestly with my self, whether children were wont to sing any such thing, in any kind of game that they vsed; but I could neuer remēber, that I had heard any such thing before. Wherfore repressing the force of my teares; I rose vp, interpreting no other thing, but that this voice came from heauen, to bidde me open the booke that I had with me, (which was S. Paules epistles) and to read the first chapter that I should finde. For I had heard before of S. Anthonie, how he was admonished to S. Anthonies conuersion. Athanasius in vita Antonij. his conuersion, by hearing a sentence of the Gospel, which was read, when he by chance came into the Church: & the sentence was; Goe and sel al thou hast, and geue to the poore, and thou shalt haue a treasure in heauen, 
                        Mat. 19. 
                        and come and folovv me. Which saying S. Anthonie taking as spoken to him in particular; was presentlie conuerted to thee (ô Lord.) Wherfore I went in hast to the place where Alipius sate, for that I lad left my booke there whē I departed. I snatched it vp, and opened it, and read in silence the first chapiter that offered it self vnto mine eyes;and therein were these wordes; Not in banquettinges, or in dronkennes; 
                        Rom. 13.
                        
                        not in vvantonnes, and chamber vvorkes; not in contention and emulation; but doe you put on our Lord Iesus Christ, and doe you not performe the prouidence of flesh, in concupiscences.
                      
                  
                  
                     Further then this sentence I would not reade, nether was it needful. For presentlie with the end of this sentence, as if the light of securitie had bene poured into my hart, al the darknes of my doutfulnes fled away. Wherepon putting in my finger, or some other signe, (which now I remember not,) vpon the place; I closed the booke, and with a quiet countenance opened the whole matter to Alipius. And he by this meanes, vttered also that vocatiō which now wroght in him, (which I before knew not. He desired that he might see what I had reade, and I shewed the place vnto him. He considered the whole, and went further also then I had reade. For it folowed in Saint Paul, Rom. 14. which I knew not,) take vnto you him that is yet vveake in faith. Which saying, Alipius applied vnto him self, and opened his whole state of doutfulnes vnto me. But by this admonition of S. Paul, he was established, and was ioyned to me in my good purpose; but yet calmelie, & without any troublesome cunctation, according to his nature and maners, wherby he differed alwayes greatlie from me, in the better parte.
                  
                  
                     After this we went in together, to my Her name vvas Monica, a verj. mother; we tel her the whole matter; she reioyseth: we recite vnto her the

whole order of the thing; she exulteth & holy vvom. ī as he shevvth. triumpheth, and blesseth thee (ô Lorde,) which art more strong and liberal than Li 9. c. 9. 10 11. 12. 13. we can aske or vnderstand; for that she sawe now, much more graunted to her from thee, touching me, than she was wont to aske with her pittiful & lamentable sighes. For thou haddest so cōuerted me now to thee, that I nether sought for wyfe, nor any other hope at al of this world, lyuing and abiding in that This vvas the religions rule of Asonostical life vvhich S.

And thus thou diddest turne her sorow now, into more abundāt solace, than she could wish; and into muche more deare & chast ioye, then shee could require, by my children, her nephues, if I had taken wife. O Lorde, I am thy seruant, I am now thy seruant, and childe of thy handmay de; thou hast broken my chaines, and I wil sacrifice to thee therfore, a sacrifice of praise. Let my harte and tongue praise the: and let my bones say to thee. O Lorde, vvhoe is like vnto thee? Let them saye it (ô Lord;) and doe thou answere, (I beseeche thee,) and saye to my soule; I am thy saluation.
                      Hitherto are S. Augustines own wordes.
                  Now then (deare Christian brother) in the miraculous example of this famous Annotatiōs vpon this conuersion. mans conuersion, there be diuers things to be noted, bothe for our comfort, and also for our instruction. First is to be  marked; the great conflict he had with his ghostely enemie, before he could get

out of his possession and dominion; which was so much the more (no dowt) for that he was to be so greate a pillar afterward in Gods Church. And we see that his fellow Alipius found not so great resistance, for that the enemie sawe there was much lesse in him, to hurt his kingdome, than in S. Augustine: which ought greatlie to animate and comfort them, that feele great resistance, and strong temptations against their vocation; assuring The best men, haue greatest cō
                        flict in their conuersion. them selues, that this is a signe of more grace and fauour, if they manfullie goe through. So was S. Paul called (as we read) most violentlie, being striken down to the grounde, & made blinde by Christ, before his conuersion, for that he was a Act. 9. chosen vessel, to beare Christes name vnto the Gentiles.
                  Secondly is to be noted in the same example, that although this man had most  strong passions before his conuersion, & that in the greatest and most incurable diseases, which cōmonlie afflict worldlie men; as in ambition, couetousnes, and sinnes of the flesh, (according as him self before cōfesseth,) which maladies possessed Li. 6. c. 6. & 15. him so stronglie in deede, as he thought it vnpossible (before his conuersion,) euer to subdue and conquer the same: yet afterwarde, he proued the contrarie, by the help of Gods omnipotent grace. Thirdlie  also is to be considered, that he had not onelie the victorie ouer these his passions afterward, but also found great sweetness

in the way of vertuous life. For a litle after his conuersion, he writeth thus: I LL 9. c. 6. could not be satisfied (ô Lord) in those dayes, with the maruailous sweetnes which thougauest me. O, how much did I weepe in thy himnes & canticles, being vehementlie stirred vp with the voyces of thy Church, singing most sweetlie! Those voyces did runne into my eares, & thy trueth did melt into my hart, & thēce did boyle out an affection of pietie, and made teares to runne from me, and I was in most happie state with them.
                  
                  Fourthlie is to be remembred for our 4. The diligē
                        ce of S. Aug. in arying and follovving Gods vocation. instruction and imitation, the behauiour of this holy man about his vocation. First in searching & trying out the same, by his repaire to S. Ambrose, to Simplicianus, & others; by reading of good bookes, frequenting of good companie, and the like; which thou oughtest also (good reader) to doe whē thou feelest thy self inwardlie moued; and not to lye dead, as manie are wont, resisting openlie the holie Ghost with al his good motions, & not so much as once to geue eare to the knocking of Christ at the dore of their consciences. Apoc. 3. Moreouer, S. Austen (as we see) refused not the meanes to know his vocation, but prayed, wept, and often retired him self alone from companie to talke with God, in that matter. Which many of vs wil neuer doe, but rather doe detest and flie al meanes that maye bring vs into those cogitations of our conuersion. Finallie, S.

Austen, after he had once seene clearlie the wil and pleasure of God, made no more staye of the matter, but bracke of stronglie from al the world and vanities therof; gaue ouer his rhetorike lecture at Millan; left al hope of promotion in the Li. 9. c. 2. court, and betooke him self to serue almightie God through lie; and therfore, no maruaile if he receaued so great consolation and aduauncement from God afterward, as to be so worthie a member in his holy Church. Which example is to be folowed of al them that desire perfectiō, so farforth as ech mans condition & state of life permitteth.
                  And here by this occasion I may not let passe to aduertise thee (good reader) Violence to be vsed at the beginning of our conuersion. & also by S. Austens exāple to forewarne thee, that who soeuer meaneth to make this resolution throughlie, must vse some violence to him self at the beginning. For as a fire, if you rushe in vpon it with force, is easilie put-out, but if you deale softlie, putting in one hand after an other, you may rather hurt your self then extinguish the same: so is it with our passions, who require manhode and courage for a time, at the beginning. Which who soeuer shal vse (together with the other meanes set doune in the second booke of this treatise:) he shal most certainlie finde that thing to be easie, which now he thinketh heauie; and that most sweete, which now he esteemeth so vnsauorie. For proofe wherof, as also for conclusion of this

chapter, I wil alleage a shorte discourse out of S. Barnard; who after his fashion, proueth the same most fitlie by an authoritie alleaged out of the holy scriptures. His wordes are thes.
                  Christ sayeth vnto vs; take my yoke vpon you, and you shal find rest. This is a maruelous Bernard. in verba Euāgelij: Ecce nos relicuimus omnia. noueltie, but that it cometh from him vvhich maketh al things nevv. 
                     He that taketh vp a yoke, findeth rest; he that leaueth al, findeth a hundred times so much. He knew wel this (I meane that man according to the hart of God) which sayed in his psalme; Doth the seate of iniquitie cleaue to thee (ô 
                        Psal. 93. 
                        Lord) vvhich feignest a labour in thy commandement? is not this a feigned labour (deare brothren) in a commandement; I meane a light burden, a sweet yoke, an annointed crosse? So in old time he saied to Abraham, Gen. 22. 
                        take thy sonne Isaac, vvhom thou louest, and offer him to me in sacrifice. This was a feigned labour in a commandement. For Isaac being offered, he was not killed, but sanctified therby. Thou therfore, if thou heare the Christsyoke a feigned labour. voice of God within thy hart, willing thee to offer vp Isaac (which signifieth ioy or laughter;) feare not to obey it faith fuilie and constantlie. What soeuer thy corrupt affection iudgeth of the matter, be thousecure. Not Isaac, but the Ramme shal die for it; thy ioy shal not perish, but thy stubburnes onelie, whose hornes are entangled with thornes, and can not be in thee, without the prickinges of anxietie. Thy Lord doth but tempt the, as he did

Abraham, to see what thou wilt doe. Isaac (that is, thy ioy in this life) shal not die, as thou imaginest, but shal liue; onelie he must be lifted vp vpon the wood, to the end, thy ioy may be on high, and that thou maiest glorie, not in thine owne flesh, but onelie in the crosse of thy Lord, by whom thy self also art crucified: crucified, (I say) but crucified to the world: for vnto Gall. 3. God thou liuest stil, and that much more, then thou diddest before.
                  
               
            
            
               THE THIRD IMPEDIMENT THAT STAYETH DIVERS MEN FROM REsolution in Gods seruice. VVhich is, the feare they conceaue of persecutution, affliction, losse, danger or tribulation. CHAPT. III.
               THER want not many persons in the world, who, (either moued by the reasons and considerations before recited, or conuicted by their owne experience, for that they behold daily no smal numbers of godly persons to liue as

contentedly as them selues) doe yeld thus much vnto vertuous life, that in very deed they esteeme the same to be easie and pleasant inough, to such as are once entered in therunto. And that in good sooth, for their owne partes, they could be content to embrace and folow the same, if they might doe it with quiet and peace of al handes. But yet to request them vnto it in such time or place, or with such order and circumstances, as tribulation, affliction, or Nevv snifies to auoide resolution. persecution may fal vpon them for the same: they think it a matter vnreasonable to be demaunded, and them selues verie excusable, both before God and man, for refusing it. But this excuse (deare brother) is no better then the other going before of the pretēded difficultie; for that it standeth vpon a false ground, as also vpō an vniust illation or consequent inforced vpō that ground. The ground is this; that a man may liue vertuouslie, and serue God truelie, with al worldlie ease; & without any affliction, tribulation, or persecution; which is false. For that, albeit external contradictions and persecutions, be more in one time then in an other; more in this place, then in that: yet can there not be any time or place without some, both external and internal. Which although (as I haue shewed before) in respect of the manifold helpes and consolations sent from God in cōterpoise of the same, they seeme not heauie nor vnpleasant vnto the godlie: yet are they in them selues both great

and weightie, as would appeare if they fel vpon the wicked and impatient. Secondlie, the illation and consequēce made vpon this ground, is vniust; for that it alleageth tribulation, as a sufficient reason to abandone Gods seruice, which God him self hath ordained for a meane to the contrary effect; that is, to draw men therby Fovver pointes to be handled in this chapter. vnto his seruice and from the seruice of the world. For better declaratiō wherof (the matter being of verie great importance) I wil handle in this chapter, thes fower pointes insuing.
               First, whether it be ordinarie for al  that must be saued, to suffer some kinde of persecution tribulation or affliction; that is, whether this be appointed an ordinary or vsual meane of mans saluation in this life.
               Secōdlie, what are the causes whie God  (louing vs as he doth) wold chuse & appoint thes sharpe meanes of our saluation.
               Thirdlie, what principal reasons of cō
                  fort a man may haue in his tribulations  and afflictions.
               Fourthlie, what is required at his hādes in hat state. which fower pointes being  declared, I doubt not but great light shal appeare in this whole matter, which seemeth to flesh and blood to be so ful of darknes and improbabilities.
               
                  The first part.
                  
                     AND TOVCHING the first, there needeth litle proofe, for that Christ

him self hath affirmed to his Disciples, & 1. VVHEther al good men must suffer tribulation or no. by them to al other his seruantes; In mundo pressuram sustinebitis; In the world you shal sustaine affliction. And in an other place; In your patience shal you possesse your soules: that is to say, by suffering patientlie the aduersities, that shal be layd vpon you: Ioh. 26. Loc. 11. 2. Ti. 3. which S. Paul yet vttereth more plainlie when he sayeth; Al they that vvil liue godlie in Iesus Christ, shal suffer persecution. Yf al, then none can be excepted. And to signifie yet further the necessitie of this matter, bothe S. Paul and Barnabas also did teach (as S. Luke reporteth) that vve of necessitie must enter into the kingdome of God, by many 
                     Act. 14. 
                     tribulations: vsing the worde oportet, which signifieth a certaine necessitie. And Christ him self yet more plainly reuealeth this secret, whē he sayeth to S. Iohn th' Euangelist, Apo. 3. 
                     that he chastiseth al those vvhō he loueth. Which wordes S. Paul as it were expounding to the hebrewes sayeth, flagellat 
                     Heb. 12. 
                     omnem filium quē recipit; he whippeth euery child whom he receaueth. And S. Paul vrgeth this matter so farre in that place, as he affirmeth plainlie al those to be bastardes, and no children of God, who Ver. 8. are not afflicted by him in this life. The same position he holdeth to Timothie: Si sustinemus & conregnabimus; if we suffer 2. Ti. 2. with Christ, we shal raigne with Christ, & not otherwise. Wherin also cōcurreth holie Dauid, when he sayeth, Multe tribulationes 
                     Psa. 33. 
                     iustorum; The iust are appointed to many tribulations.
                  
                     
The same might be proued by many 1. Testimonie of scripture. other meanes, as by that our Sauiour sayeth. He came not to bring peace, but the svvord into the vvorld. Also by that S. Paul Mat. 10. sayeth. That no man can be crovvned except he 
                     2. Tim. 2. 
                     fight laufullie. But how can we fight, if we haue no enemie to oppugne vs? The same signifieth Christ in the Apocalips, when C. 2. & 3. he repeateth so often that heauē is onelie for him that conquereth. The verie same is signified by the shippe, wherinto Christ Matt. 8. entered with his disciples, which was tossed and tumbled, as if it wold haue bene drouned; this (I saie) by al the auncient Fathers exposition, was a figure of the troubles and afflictions, that al they should suffer, which doe saile in the same shippe with Christ our sauiour. The same also is proued, in that the life of man is Iob. 7. called a warfare vpon earthe; and by that, he is appointed to labour and trauaile, Iob. 5. while he is here; also in that, his life is replenished with many miseries, euen by Iob. 13. the appointement of almightie God after mans fal. The same also is shewed, in that that God hath appointed euery man to passe through the paines of death, before he come to ioye. In like maner, by the infinite contradictions and tribulations, bothe within and without, left vnto man in this life. As for exāple, within, are the rebellions of his concupiscence & other miseries of his minde, wherwith he hath continualie to make warre, if he wil saue his soule. Without, are the world, and the

deuil, which doe neuer cease to assault him, now by faire meanes, and now by foule; now by flatterie, & now by threates; now alluring by pleasure and promotion, now terrefying by affliction and persecution; Against al which the good Christian hathe to resist manfullie, or els he leeseth the crowne of his eternal saluation.
                  The verie same thing also may be shewed by the examples of al the most renowned 2. The exāple of saintes in the old testament. saintes, from the begining; who were not onelie assaulted internallie with the rebellion of their owne flesh; but also persecuted & afflicted outwardlie, by diuerse aduersities, therby to confirme more manifestlie this purpose of almightie God vnto vs. This we see in Abel, persecuted and slaine by his owne brother, as sone as Gene. 4. euer he begāne to serue God sincerly. The same we see in Abrahā, afflicted diuerslie after he was once chosen by almightie God. Of the same cuppe dranke al his Gen. 22. children and posteritie that succeded him, in Gods fauour; as Isaac, Iacob, Ioseph, Iudit. 8. Moyses, and al the prophetes; of whom Christ him self geueth testimonie, how their blood was shed most cruellie by the Ma. 5. 23. world. The affliction also of Iob is Luc. 13. wonderful, seing the scripture affirmeth it to haue come vpon him by Gods special Iob. 1. appointement, he being a most iust man. But yet more wonderful was the afflictiō of holie Tobias, who among other calamities, was stricken blinde by the falling Iob. 2.
                     
doune of swallowes dung into his eyes; of which the Angel Raphael tolde him afterwarde: Because thou vvere a man grateful 
                     Tob. 12. 
                     to God, therefore it vvas of necessitie that this tentation should proue thee. Beholde the necessitie of afflictions to good men. I might adde to this, the example of Dauid and others; but that S. Paul geueth a general testimonie of al the saintes of the olde testament, saying: That some were racked; Heb. 11. some reproched, some whiped, some chained, some imprisoned: other were stoned, cut in peeces, tempted, and slaine with the sword: some went about in heare clothe, in skinnes of goates, in great neede, pressed and afflicted, wandering and hyding them selues in wildernesses, in hilles, in caues, and holes vnder grounde, the worlde not being woorthie of them. Of al which he prononceth this comfortable sentence, to be noted of al men: Non suscipientes redemptionem, vt meliorem inuenirent resurrectionem: 
                     That is, God wolde not deliuer them from these afflictions in this life, to the end their resurrection and rewarde in the life to come might be more glorious.  And this of the saintes of the olde testament.
                  But now in the new testament, founded 3. Sainctes of the nevv testament. Luc. 24. expresselie vpon the crosse, the matter standeth much more plaine, and that with great reason. For, if Christ could not goe into his glorie but by suffering, as holy scripture affirmeth: then by the most reasonable rule of Christ, affirming, that the
                     
                     seruant hathe not priuilege aboue his maister, it Mat. 10. Luc. 6. Mat. 10. must needes in reason folowe, that al haue to drinke of Christes cuppe, which are appointed to be partakers of his glorie. And for proofe herof, looke vpon the dearest frendes that euer our Sauiour had in this life, & see whether they had parte therof or no? Of his mother, old Simeon prophesied Luc. 2. and tolde her at the beginning, that the svvorde of tribulatiōs should pearce her harte; signifying therby, the extreme afflictions that she felt afterward in the death of her sonne, and other miseries heaped vpon her. Of the Apostles it is euident, that besides al their labours, trauailes, needes, sufferinges, persecutions and calamities, which were infinite, and in mans sight intolerable, (if we beleue S. Paul recoūting the same:) besides al this 1. Cor. 4. 2. Cor. 4. 6. 11. 12. Act. 20. Rom. 8. Ioh. 21. (I saye) God wold not be satisfied, except he had their blood also, spent in his seruice: and so we see that he suffered none of them al to die naturallie or in his bed, but onelie S. Iohn by a special priuilege particulerlie granted to him from Christ; albeit if we consider what S. Iohn also suffered in so long a life as he liued, being banished by Domitian to Pathmos; & at Ter. lib. de prescrip. hereti. Ierom. lib. cont. Iouin. an other time, thrust into a tonne of hoate boyling oyle at Rome (as Tertulian and S. Ierome doe reporte;) we shal see that his parte also was no lesse then others in this cuppe of his maister. I might reckō vp here infinite other exāples, but it needeth not; for it may suffice, that Christ hathe

geuen this general rule in the new testament; He that taketh not vp his crosse and 
                     Math. 10. 
                     folovveth me, is not vvoorthie of me. By which, is resolued plainelie, that there is no saluation now to be had, but onely for them that take vp (that is, doe beare willingly) their proper crosses, and therwith doe folow their captaine, walking on with his crosse vpon his shoulders before them.
                  But here perhappes some man may say; if this be so, that no man can be saued An obiection ansvvered. without a crosse: that is, without afflictiō and tribulation; how doe al thos that liue in peacible times and places, where no persecution is, no trouble, no affliction or tribulatiō? To which I answere; first, that if there were any such time or place, the mā liuing therein should be in verie great danger, according to the saying of the prophet, they are not in the labours of other 
                     Psal. 72. 
                     men, nor yet vvhipped & punished as others are, and therfore pride possessed thē, and they vvere couered vvith iniquitie and impietie: and their iniquitie proceeded of their fatnesse, or abundāce. Besides this, albeit men suffered nothing in this life, yet (as S. Austen largelie proueth:) In psa. 73. & de vera & falsa penitētia. c. 18 1. Cor 3. if they died out of the state of mortal sinne; they might be saued by suffering the purging fire in the next, according to the saying of S. Paul; that such as build not gold or siluer vpon the true foundation, but wood, straw, or stuble: shal receaue dammage thereof at the day of our Lord, to be reueiled in fire; but yet by that fire they shal be saued.
                  
                  
                     
Secōdlie I answer, that there is no time and place so voide of tribulation, but that there is alwaies a crosse to be found, for them that wil take it vp. For euer is there either pouertie, sicknesse, slaunder, enemitie, iniurie, contradiction, or some like affliction offered continually. For that, thos mē neuer want in the world, wherof the prophet saied; They that doe render euil for 
                     Psal. 37. 
                     good, did detract me, for that I folovved goodnesse. At the least wise, there neuer wāt thos domestical enemies, of which our Sauiour Christ for warneth vs; I meane ether Mat. 7. our kinred and carnal friends, who commonly resist vs, if we beginne once throughly to serue almightie God; or els our owne disordinate affections, which are the most perilous enemies of al other, for that they make vs warre vpō our own ground. Again, there neuer want the temptations of the world and deuil, the resisting wherof is much more difficult in Time of peace more dangerous then of persecution. time of peace and wealth, then in time of external affliction and persecution; for that thes enemies are stronger in flatterie, then in force; which a godly father expresseth by this parable. The sunne and wind (saieth he) agreed one day to proue their seueral strengthes in taking a cloke from a waiefaring man. And in the forenoone, A parable. the wind vsed al violence that he could to blow of the said clok. But the more he blew, the more fast held the trauailer his clock, and gathered it more closely about him. At after noone the sunne

sent forth her pleasant beames, & by litle and litle so entered into this man, as he caused him to yeeld & to put of, not onely his cloke, but also his cote. Whereby is proued (saieth this father) that the allurementes of pleasure are more strong and harder to be resisted, then the violence of persecution.
                  The like is shewed by the example of 2. Re. 11. king Dauid, who resisted easily many assaults of aduersitie; but yet fel dangerously in time of prosperitie. Wherby appeareth that vertuous men haue no lesse warre in time of peace, then in time of persecution. Nor euer wanteth there occasion of bearing the crosse, and suffering affliction, to him that wil accept of the same. And this may susfice for this first point, to proue that euery man must enter into heauen by tribulation as S. Paul saieth.
               
               
                  The second part.
                  TOVCHING THE second, why God wold haue this matter so; it were sufficiēt 2. THE cause vvhy God sendeth afflictiō to the godly. to aunswer, that it pleased him best so, without seeking any further reason of his meaning herein: euen as it pleased his diuine Maiestie, without al reason in our sight, to abase his sonne so much, as to send him hither into this world to suffer and die for vs. Or if we wil needes haue a reason hereof, this one might be sufficiēt for al; that seing we looke for so great a glory as we doe; we should labour a litle first for the same, and so shew our selues worthie

of Gods fauour and exaltation. But yet, for that it hath pleased his diuine Maiestie, not onely to open vnto vs his wil and determination for our suffering in this life; but also diuers reasons of his most holy purpose and pleasure therin, for our further encouragement and consolation that doe suffer: I wil in this place repeate some of the same, for declaration of his exceeding great loue and fatherlie care towardes vs.
                  
                     THE FIRST cause then, and the most 1. ENCREAse of glory. principal, is, to encrease therby our merit and glorie in the life to come. For hauing appointed by his eternal wisdome and iustice, that none shal be crouned there, but according to the measure of his fight in 2. Tim. 2. Apoc. 2. this world; the more and greater cōbates that he geueth (together with sufficient grace to ouercome them:) the greater crowne of glorie prepareth he for vs at our resurrection. This cause toucheth S. Paul in the wordes before alleaged of Heb. 11. the saintes of the olde testament; to wit, that they receaued no redemption from their miseries in this world, to the end they might find a better resurrection in the world to come. This also meant Christ expresselie when he saied: Happie are they 
                     Mat. 5. 
                     vvhich suffe: persecutiō, for theirs is the kingdom of heauen: happie are you vvhen men speake euil, and persecute you, &c. reioyse & be glad (I saye,) for that your revvard is great in heauē. Hereunto also appertaine al those promises, of gaining life by leesing life; of, receauing a hundred
                     
                     for one, and the like. Herehence do procede Mat. 10. Mat. 19. Esa. 56. Mat. 19. 1. Cor. 7. Psal 67. Mat. 19. Luc. 12. Pro. 21. Luc. 9. 2. Cor. 4. al those large promises to virginitie, and chastitie: and to such as geld them selues for the kingdom of heauen: to voluntarie pouertie, and to the renouncing of our owne wil by obedience. Al which are greate conflictes against the fleshe, world, and our owne sensualitie, and can not be performed but by sufferings and affliction. Finally S. Paul declareth this matter fullie, when he sayeth: that a litle and short tribulation in this life, vvorketh a beape of glorie aboue al measure in the hight of heauen.
                  
                  
                     THE SECOND cause why God appointed this, is to draw vs therby from 2. HATRED of the vvorld. the loue of the world, his professed enemie; as in the next chapter shalbe shewed at large. This cause S. Paul vttereth in these wordes; VVe are punished of God (in this 1. Co. 11. life) to the end vve should not be damned vvith this vvorld. In like maner as a Nurse, that to weane her child from the loue and liking of her milke, dothe anointe her teat with Aloes, or some other such bitter thing: so our merciful Father, that wolde retire vs. A similitude. from the loue of wordlie delites (wherby infinite men doe perish daily) vseth to send tribulation, which of al other thinges hath most force to woorke that effect; as we see in the example of the prodigal sonne, who could by no meanes be stayed from his pleasures and retired home to his olde Father, but onelie by Luc. 15. affliction.
                  
                     
                     THIRDLIE, God vseth tribulation as a most present and soueraine medicine 3. A MEDEcine to cure our deseases. to heale vs of many diseases, otherwise almost incurable. As first, of a certaine blindenes and careles negligence in our estate, contracted by wealth and prosperitie. In which sense, holy scripture saieth, that affliction geueth vnderstanding. And the wise man affirmeth, that the rodde bringeth 
                     Eccl. 28. Pro. 29. 
                     vvisdom. This was shewed in figure, when the sight of Tobie was restored by the Tob. 12. bitter gaule of a fish. And we haue cleare examples in Nabuchodonasor, Saul, Antiochus, and Manasses; al wich came to Dan. 4. 2. Mac. 9. 2. Para. 33 see their owne faultes by tribulation, which they wolde neuer haue done in time of prosperitie. The like we read of the brethren of Ioseph, who falling into some affliction in Egypt, presentlie entred into their owne conscience, and sayd; VVe suffer those thinges vvorthely, for that vve 
                     Gen. 42. 
                     sinned against our brother. And as tribulation bringeth this light, wherby we see our owne defectes: so helpeth it greatlie to remoue and cure the same; wherin it may be wel likened vnto the rodde of Moyses. For as that rodde striking the hard rockes, brought foorth water, as the scripture Ero. 17. Deut. 8. Psal. 77. saieth: so, this rodde of affliction falling vpon stonie harted sinners, mollifieth them to contrition, and often times bringeth forth the fluddes of teares to repentance. Tob. 3. In respect wherof, holy Tobie saieth to almightie God; In time of tribulation thou forgeuest sinnes. And for like 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                     
it is compared also to a file of yron which Iob. 23. Prou. 17. Eccle. 2. Esa. 1. Ier. 9. taketh away the rust of the soule. In like maner, to a purgation that driueth out corrupt humours. And finallie to a goldsmithes forge which cōsumeth away the refuse metals, and fineth the gold to his perfection, I vvil trie thee by fire to the quick, (saieth God to a sinner by Esay the prophet) and I vvil take avvaie al thy tinne, and refuse metal. And againe by Ieremie, I vvil melt them and trye them by fire. This he meant of the fire of tribulation, whose propertie is (according as the scripture saith) to purge and fine the soule, as fire purgeth & Sap. 3. Zach. 13. fineth gold in the fornace. For besides the purging and remouing of greater sinnes, by consideration and contrition, (which tribulation woorketh, as hath bene shewed;) it purgeth also the ruste of infinite euil passions, appetites, and humours in man; as the humour of pride, of vaine glorie, of slouth, of choler, of delicate nisenes, and a thousand more, which prosperitie ingendreth in vs.
                  This God declareth by the prophet Ezec. 24. Ezechiel, saying, of a rustie soule; put her naked vpon the hote coles, and let her heate there, vntil her brasse be melted from her, and vntil her corruption be burned owt, and her ruste cōsumed. There hath bene much labour and sweate taken about her, and yet her ouer much ruste is not gone out of her.This also signifieth holy Iob, when hauing sayed, that God 
                     Iob. 33. 
                     instructeth a man by discipline (or correction)

                     to the end he may turne him from the thinges that he hath done, and deliuer him from pride: (which is vnderstoode of his sinful actes,) he addeth a litle after, the maner of this purgation, saying; his flesh being consumed by punismentes, let him returne againe to the daies of 
                     Ver. 25. 
                     his youth; That is, al his fleshlie humours & palsions being now consumed by punishmentes and tribulations, let him beginne to liue againe in such puritie of soule, as he did at the beginning of his youth, before he had contracted these euil humours and diseases by prosperitie.
                  
                     NETHER ONELIE is tribulation a strong medicine to heale sinne: and to 4. A PREseruatiue. purge awaye the refuse metalles in vs, of brasse, tinne, yron, lead, and drosse, as almightie God by Ezechiel sayeth: but also a most excellent preseruatiue against sinne for the time to come. According as good king Dauid saied, thy discipline (o Lord) hath 
                     Psal. 17. 
                     corrected me for euermore; That is to say, it it hath made me wary, and watchful, not to commit sinne againe, according as the scripture sayeth in an other place; Agrenous infirmitie or afflictiō maketh the soule sober. 
                     Eccl. 31. For which cause the prophet Ieremie calleth tribulation, virgam vigilantem? A watcheful rodde; that is, (as S. Ierome expoundeth Iere. 1. it,) a rodde that maketh a man watchful. The same signified God, when he saied by Ose the prophet; I vvil hedge 
                     Ose. 2. 
                     in thy vvaye vvith thornes; That is, I wil so close thy life on euerie side with the remembrance and feare of affliction, that

thou shalt not dare to treade awrie, lest thou treade vpō a thorne. Al which, good Dauid expresseth of him self in these Psal. 18. wordes: before I was humbled & broght lowe by affliction, I did sinne and offend the (ô Lord:) but after that time, I haue kept thy commandementes.
                  
                  
                     OF THIS ALSO appeareth yet an 5. A PREuentiō of the punishmēt in purgatory. other cause, why God afflicteth his elect in this life; and that is, to preuent his iustice vpon them, in the world to come: I mean that Iustice, which otherwise remaineth to be executed vpon euery one after their departure hence in that most greuous purging fire, wherof I spake before. Touching which S. Barnard sayeth thus; Oh vvold to God some man vvolde novv 
                     Ser. 55. in cantic. 
                     before hand, prouide for my head abundance of vvaters, and to mine eyes a fountaine of teares; for so happely the burning fire should take no hold, vvhere running teares had clensed before. And the reason of this is, (as that holy man him self noteth after) for that God hath said by Naum the prophet, I haue afflicted the once, and I vvil not afflict thee againe: 
                     Naum. 1. 
                     there shal not come from me a double tribulation.
                  
                  
                     SIXTHLIE, God sendeth tribulation 6. TO PROue vs. vpō his seruants, to examine & proue them therby, whether they be fatheful & constant or no: that is, to make thē selues and other men see and confesse, how faithful or vnfaithful they are. This in figure was signified, when Isaac wold Gen. 27. grope and touche his sonne Iacob, before he wold blesse him. And this the scripture

expresseth plainlie, when talking of the tribulations layed vpon Abraham, it addeth, tentauit Deus Abraham, God tempted 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 22. Abraham, by these meanes to proue him. And Moyses saied to the people of Israel; Thou shalt remember hovv thy God ledde thee 
                     Deut. 8. 
                     fortie yeres about the desert to afflict thee, and tempt thee; to the end it might appeare vviat vvas in thy hart, vvhether thou vvoldest keept bis commandemētes or na. And againe, a fewe chapters after: Your God and Lord doth tempt 
                     Deu. 13. 
                     you, to the end it may be manifest vvhether you loue him or no, vvith al your hart and vvith al your soule. In which sense also, the scripture sayeth of Ezechras, after many praises geuen vnto him, that God left him sor a time to be tempted, that the thoughtes of his hart might therby be made manifest. 
                     2. Par. 32.
                  
                  And that this is Gods fashion towards al good men, king Dauid sheweth in the persone of al, when he sayeth, Thou hast proued vs (ò Lord) thou hast examined vs by fire; thou hast layed tribulation vpon our backes, and 
                     Psal. 63. 
                     hast brought men vpon our heades. And yet how wel he liked of this matter, he signifieth, when he calleth for more therof in an other place: saying, Trie me (ò Lord) and tempt me; burne my reines and hart vvithin me. 
                     Psa. 25. That is, trie me by the way of tribulation and persecution; search out the secretes of my hart and reines; let the world see whether I wil sticke to the in aduersitie or no. Thus sayed that holie prophet, wel knowing Tribulatiō trieth. that which in an other place the holy Ghost vttereth; that as the fornace
                     
                     trieth the potters vessels, so tribulation trieth men. For as the sounde vessels onelic, do Eccl. 27. hold when they come to the fornace, and thos which are crased doe breake in peeces: so in time of tribulation and persecution, the vertuous onely stand to it, and the counterfeit bewraye them selues: according to the saying of Christ: In tempore tentationis recedunt: They depart from me Luc. 8. in time of temptation.
                  
                     THE SEVENTH reason, whie God layeth tribulation vpon the vertuous, is, 7. TO MAKE men runne to God. therby to make them runne vnto him for aide & helpe: euen as the mother, to make her child to loue her more, and to runne vnto her, procureth the same to be made afearde and terrified by others. This, God expresseth plainlie by the prophet Ole, saying of them that he loued; I vvil dravv 
                     Ose. 11. 
                     thē vnto me, in the ropes of Adam, in the chaines of loue, and vvil seeme vnto them as though I raysed a yoke vpon their iavv bones. By the ropes of Adam, he meaneth affliction, wherby he drew Adam to know him self; as also appeareth by that he addeth of the heauy yoke of tribulation, which he wil lay vpon the heades and faces of his seruantes, as chaines of loue, therby to draw them vnto him. This chaine had drawen Dauid vnto him when he saied, O 
                     Psal. 31. 
                     Lord thou art my refuge from the tribulation of sinners. As also thos wherof Elay saieth, Esa. 26. 
                     they saught the out (ò Lord) in their affliction. Also thos of whom Dauid saied, Infirmities 
                     Psal. 19. 
                     vvere multiplied vpon them, and after that,
                     
                     they made hast to come. And God saieth generallie of al good men; They vvil rise betimes 
                     Ose. 6. 
                     in the morning, and come to me in their tribulation. Wherfore holy king Dauid desiring Psal. 82. the weale of certaine men, and to winne them to God, saieth in one of his psalmes; Fil their faces (o Lord) vvith shame and confusion, and then vvil they seeke vnto thy name. And this is true (as I said) in the elect and chosen seruantes of God. But in the Tribulatiō. helpeth not the reprobate. reprobate, this rope draweth not, this yoke holdeth not, nor doth this chaine of loue winne them vnto God; wherof God him self complaineth, saying: In vaine haue 
                     Iere. 2. 
                     I stricken your children, for they haue not receaued my discipline. And againe the prophet Ieremie saieth of them to God; thou hast crushed them, and they haue refused to receaue 
                     Iere. 5. 
                     thy discipline; they haue hardened their faces euen as a rocke, and vvil not returne to thee. Behold, they haue rent the yoke, and broken the chaines.
                  
                  
                     OF THIS NOVV ensueth an eight reason, why God bringeth his seruantes 8. To MAnifest Gods povver and loue in deliuering. into affliction: to wit, therby to shew his power and loue in deliuering them. For as in this world a princelie mind desireth nothing more, thē to haue occasiō wherby to shew his habilitie & good wil vnto his deare frend: so God almightie which hath al occasions in his owne handes, and passeth al his creatures together in greatnesse of loue and nobilitie of mind; worketh purposely diuers occasions and opportunities, wherby to shew and exercise she same. So he brought the three childrē
                     
into the burning fornace, therby to shew his power and loue in deliuering them. So he brought Daniel, into the liōs dēne; Dan. 3. 6. 13. Susanna, vnto the point of death; Iob, into extreme miserie; Ioseph, into prison; Tobie Iob. 1. 2. Gen. 31. Tob. 2. 12. vnto blindnes: therby to shew his power and loue in their deliuerance. For this cause also did Christ suffer the shippe to be almost drouned, before he would Mat. 8. awake; & S. Peter to be almost vnder water; Mar. 14. before he would take him by the hande.
                  
                     AND OF THIS one reason, many other reasons and most comfortable causes 9. THE IOY of deliuerance. doe appeare of Gods dealing herin. As first, that we being deliuered from our afflictions, might take more ioy and delite thereof, then if we had neuer suffered the same. For as water is more grateful to the waiefaring man, after a long drouth; & a A sunilitude. calme more pleasant vnto passingers after a troublesome tempest: so is our deliuerie more sweet after persecution or tribulation, according as the scripture saieth; Speciosa misericordia Dei in tempore tribulationis; 
                     Eccl. 35. the mercie of God is beautiful and pleasant in time of tribulation. This signified also our Sauiour, whē he saied, your sorovv shalbe turned into ioy; that is, you shal reioice Ioh. 16. that euer you were sorowful. This had Dauid proued when he saied, thy redie (o 
                     Psal. 22. 
                     Lord) and thy staffe haue comforted me that is, I take great comfort that euer I was chastised with them. And againe, according to the multitude of my sorovves, thy consolations 
                     Psal. 53.
                     
                     haue made ioiful my mind: That is, for euery sorow that I receaued in time of afflictiō, I receaue now a consolation after my deliuerance. And again in an other place, I vvil exult and reioice in thy mercie ô Lord. And wherfore (good king) wilt thou so reioice? Psal. 30. it foloweth immediatly: For that thou hast respected my abasement, and hast deliuered my soule frō the necessitie vvherin shee vvas, and hast not left me in the handes of mine enemie.
                  
                  This then, is one most gracious meaning of our louing and merciful father in afflicting vs for a time; to the end our ioy may be the greater after our deliuerance; as no doubt but it was, in al thos whom I haue named before, deliuered by Gods mercie: I meane, Abrahā, Ioseph, Daniel, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, Susanna, Iob, Thobias, Peter and the rest; who tooke much more ioy after their deliuerance, then if they had neuer bene in affliction at al. When Iudith had deliuered Bethulia, and returned thither with Holofernes head; Iudith. 6. 14. 15. there was more hartie ioy in that citie, then euer there would haue bene, if it had not bene in distresse. When S. Peter was Act. 12. deliuered out of prison by the Angel; there was more ioy for his deliuerance in the Church, then could haue bene, if he had neuer bene in prison at al.
                  
                     OVT of this great ioy resulteth an other 10. THANKES giuing for our deliuerance. effect of our tribulation, much pleasant to God, and comfortable to our selues; and that is, a most hartie and earnest thankesgeuing to our Lord for our deliuerance;

such as the prophet vsed when he saied, after his deliuerance: I for my part vvil sing 
                     Psal. 58. 
                     of thy strength, and vvil exalt thy mercie betimes in the morning, for that thou hast bene my aider and refuge, in the daey of my tribulation. Such hartie thankes and praise did the childrē of Israel yeeld to God for their deliuerance, when they were passed ouer the read sea, in that notable song of theirs, which beginneth, Cantemus domino; and is Exo. 15. 1. Re. 2. Iudie. 5. Iudi. 12. registred by Moyses in Exodus. From like hartie affect came also thos songes of Anna, Debora, and Iudith, moued therunto by the remembrance of their afilictions past. And finally, this is one of the cheefest things that God esteemeth and desireth at our hādes; as he testefieth by the prophet, saying, cal vpon me in the day of tribulation; & 
                     Psal 49. 
                     I vvil deliuer thee, and thou shall honour me.
                  
                  
                     BESIDES AL thes effects, God hath yet further reasons of laying persecution 11. EMROLDning vs 
                           〈◊〉
                         Gods seruice. vpon vs; as for example, to the end that by suffering, & perceiuing in deed Gods certaine assistance and consolation therin, we may come to be so hardie, bold, and constant in his seruice, as nothing afterward can dismay vs. Euē as Moyses, albeit he were first afeard of the serpent that Exo. 4. was made of his rodd, and so fled away from it: yet afterwardes, whē he by Gods commandement had once taken it vp by the taile, he feared it no more. This the Psal. 45. prophet Dauid expresseth notablie, whē he saieth: God hath bene our refuge, and strēgth, and helper in our great tribulations, and therfore

vve vvil not feare if the vvhole earth should be troubled, and the mountaines cast into the middest of the sea. What greater considence can be imagined then this?
                  
                     AGAINE, by persecution & afflictiō 
                     12. THE exercise of al the vertues. God bringeth his children to the exercise and perfect possession of al the holy vertues belonging to a Christian man. As for example, faith is exercised in time of tribulation, by considering the causes of Faith. Gods permission, and beleeuing most assuredlie the promises he hath made for our deliuerance. Hope is exercised in conceauing Hope. & assuring our selues of the rewards promised to thē that suffer patiently. Charitie Charitie. is exercised, in considering the loue of Christ suffering for vs, and therby proueketh the afflicted to suffer againe for him. Obediece is exercised, in cōforming Obedience. Patience. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . our willes to the wil of Christ. Patience, in bearing quietlie. Humilitie, in abasing our selues in the sight of God. And so likewise al other vertues, belōging to a good Christian, are stirred vp, exercised, confirmed, strengthened, and established in man by tribulation, according to the saying of S. Peter: God shal make perfect, confirme, and 
                     1. Pet. 5. 
                     establish them, vvhich haue suffered a little for his name.
                  
                  
                     FINALLY, Gods meaning is by laying 13. To MAKE vs like vnto Christ. persecution and affliction vpon vs, to make vs perfect Christians, that is to say, like vnto Christ our captaine, whom the prophet calleth Virum dolorum, & scientem infirmitatem; 
                     a man of sorowes, and one Esa. 53.
                        
that had tasted of al maner of infirmities, therby to receaue the more glory at his returne to heauen, and to make more glorious al thos, that wil take his parte therin. To speake in one word; God wold make vs by tribulation to become crucified 
                     Crucified Christians. 
                     Christians, which is the most honorable title that can be geuen vnto a creature in heauen or earthe. Crucified (I say) and mortified to the vanities of this world; to the flesh and to our owne concupiscence and carnal desires; but quicke and ful of al liue lie spirit, to vertue, godlines, and deuotion. This is the heauenly meaning of our Soueraine Lord and God, in sending vs persecution, tribulation, and affliction; in respect whereof holy Iob douteth not to say: Blessed is the man that is afflicted by God. 
                     Iob. 5. Mat. 5. And Christ him self yet more expresselie; Happie are they vvhich suffer persecution. If they be happie and blessed therby, then is the world (no doubt) greatlie a vvrie, which so much abhorreth the sufficiance therof; thē is almightie God but vnthankfully dealt with al by many of his childrē, who repine at this happines bestowed vpon them, where as indeed they should accept it with ioye and thankes-geuing. For proofe and better declaratiō wherof, I wil enter now into the third point of this chapter, to examine what reasons and causes there be, to induce vs to this ioifulnes & contentation in tribulation.
               
               
                  
                  The third part.
                  
                     AND FIRST of al for proofe and declaration of this third part, the reasons VVHY tribulations should be perceaued ioifullie. and causes before alleaged of almightie Gods merciful and fatherly meaning in sending vs affliction, might be sufficient to comfort and content any Christian mā or woman, who taketh delite in Godes holy prouidence towardes them. For if God doe send affliction vnto vs, for the encrease of our glorie in the life to come, for drawing vs frō infectiō of the world, for opening our eyes, and curing our diseases; and for preseruing our soules from sinne hereafter, as hath bene shewed in the former part: who can be iustly displeased therwith, but such as are enemies vnto their owne eternal welfare? We see, that for the obtaining of bodilie health, we are content, not onely to admit many bitter and vnpleasant medicines, but also (if neede require) to yeeld willingly some parte of our blood to be taken from vs. And how much more should we do this, for the eternal health and saluation of our soules? But now further; if this medicine haue so many more commodities besides, as haue bene declared: if it serue here for the punishment of our sinnes, due otherwise in an other place, in farre greater quantitie and rigour of iustice: if it make The benefites of suffering. a trial of our estate, and doe draw vs to

God: if it procure Godes loue towardes vs; yeeld matter of ioy by our deliuerāce; prouoke vs to thankfulnes; embolden and strengthen vs in his seruice; and finally, if it furnish vs with al vertues, and doe make vs like to Christ him self crucified: then is there singular great cause, why we should take comfort and consolatiō therein: for that to come neare and to be like vnto our maister and Sauiour, is the greatest dignitie and preeminēce that can be imagined. Lastly, if Gods eternal wisdom haue so ordained and appointed, that this shalbe the meares of his seruātes saluatiō; the badge and liuerie of his sonne; the high way to heauen vnder the standard of his Crosse: then ought we not to abhorre thes meanes, not to refuse this liuerie, not to flie this way, but rather with good S. Peter Act. 5. and Iohn, to esteeme it a great dignitie to be made worthie of the most blessed participation therof. We see that to weare A comparison. the colours of the prince, is thoght aprerogatiue among courtiers in this world; but to weare the robe or crowne it self, were to great a dignitie for any inferiour subiect to receaue. Yet Christ our Lord and king is content to imparte both the one & th' other of his, vnto vs. And how then ought we (I pray you) to accept therof?
                  And now (as I haue said) these reasons might be sufficient to comfort and Special considerations, of cōfort in affliction. make ioyful al those that are so happie as to be called to suffer affliction and tribulation

for Christes cause. But yet there want not some more particular considerations besides. Wherof the first and most principal is, that this matter of persecutiō and affliction commeth not by chance or 1. Gods prouidence and his loue. casualtie, or by any certaine general direction of starres and planetes vnto Christians, but by the special prouidence and peculiar dispositiō of God, as our Sauiour Christ sheweth at large in S. Matthews Mat. 10. gospel; that is to say, this heauenlie medecine or potiō, is made for vs by the very hand of almighty God. Which Christ signifieth expresly when he saied to his disciples, at it were in anger, shal I not drinke the cuppe vvhich my Father hath geuen to 
                     Ioh. 18. 
                     me? That is, for as much as mine ownfather hath tempered a potion for me, shal I not drinke it? as who would saye, it were too much ingratitude. Secōdlie is to be noted, that the verie same hand of God, which tempered the cuppe for Christ, who was his owne natural sonne, hath done the same also for vs, according to Christs saying; You shal drink of my cuppe; to wit, of the same cuppe which my Father hath Mat. 10. tempered for me. Herof it foloweth, that, with what hart and loue, almightie God tempered this cuppe vnto his owne most dearlie beloued sonne; with the same he hath tempered it also to vs: that is, altogether for our good & for his glorie. Thirdlie is to be considered, that this cuppe is tēpered with such special care (as Christ sayeth) that, what trouble or danger

soeuer it may seeme to woorke: (as al purgations for a time doe) yet shal not one heare of our head perish by the same. Nay Luc. 21. Mat. 10. Psal. 79. further, is to be noted, that which the prophet sayeth, O Lord thou shalt geue vs to drinke in teares, in measure. That is, the cuppe of teares and tribulation shal be so tempered in measure by our heauenlie phisition, as no man shal haue aboue his strength. The dose of Aloes and other bitter ingredients shalbe qualified with manna and sufficient sweetnes of heauēlie consolation. God is faithful (saieth S. Paul) 1. Co. 10. 
                     and vvil not suffer you to be tempted aboue your abilitie. This is a singular point of comfort, and ought alwaies to be in our remembrance.
                  Besides this, we must consider, that the appointing and tempering of this cuppe, 2. Al tribulatiōs measured vnto vs by Christ Mat. 28. Heb. 5.
                      being now in the handes of Christ our Sauiour, by the ful commission graunted him from his Father, & he hauing learned by his owne sufferinges (as S. Paul notifieth) what it is to suffer in flesh and blood; we may be sure that he wil not laie vpon vs more, then we can beare. For, as A comfortable comparison. if a man had a Father or brother that were a most skilful phisition, and should receaue a purgation from them, tempered with their owne handes; he might be sure it wold neuer hurt him, what rōbling soeuer it made in his bellie for the time: so and much more may we be assured of this potion of tribulation ministred vnto vs by the hand of Christ, howsoeuer

(as S. Paul saieth) it seeme vnto vs vnpleasant Heb. 12. in the operation.
                  
                     BVT ABOVE al other comfortable 3. GODES measure of tribulation goeth according to the measure of his Ieue. Apoc. 3. Heb. 12. cogitations, this is the greatest and most ful of consolatiō, to consider, that he diuideth this cuppe onelie of loue, as him self protesteth, and as S. Paul proueth; that is, he geneth out portions of his crosse (the richest Iewel that he maketh accōpt of) as worldlie princes doe their treasine: vnto none, but vnto his chosen and picked freendes; and among them also, not equally to 
                        〈◊〉
                     , but to euerie one a measure, according to the measure of good wil and special affection wherwith he loueth them. This is euident by the examples before set downe of his dearest frendes most of al afflicted in this life; that is to say, they receaued greatest portiōs of this treasure, for that his good wil was greatest towardes them. This also may be seene manisestly in the exaple of S. Paul, of whom after that Christ had saied to Ananias, vas electionis est mihi, he is a chosen vessel vnto me: he geueth immediatlie Act. 9. the reason therof: For I vvil shevv vnto him, vvhat great thinges he must suffer for my name. Loe here, for that he was a chosen vessel, therfore he must suffer great matters for Christ. Doth not the measure of suffering goe then according to the measure of Gods loue vnto vs? Surely S. Peter knew wel how the matter went, and therfore he writeth thus: If you liuing vvel, doe suffer vvith patience; this 
                     1. Pet. 2.
                     
                     is a grace (or priuilege) before God. And againe alitle after: Yf you suffer reproche in the name of Christ, you are happie; for that the honour and 
                     1. Pet. 4. 
                     glerie, and povver of God, and of his holy spirit, final rest vpon you.
                  
                  Can there possibly be any greater rewarde promised to man or anie more The great dignitie of suffering. excellēt dignitie, thē to be made partaker of the honour, glorie, and power of Iesus Christ? Is it maruaile now if Christ saied, Happie are you vvhen men reuile and persecute 
                     Mat. 5. 
                     you? Is it maruaile though he saied, gaudete in illa die, & exultate, reioyse and triumphe Luc. 6. ye in that daie? Is it maruaile, though S. Paul said, I take greate pleasure, and doe glorie in my infirmities or afflictions, in 2. Co. 12. my reproches, in my necessities, in my persecutions, in my distresses for Christ? Is it maruaile if S. Peter and S. Iohn being Act. 5. reproched and beaten at the Iudgement seat of the Iewes, went away reioysing that they were esteemed worthie to suffer contumelie for the name of IESVS? Is it maruaile thogh S. Paul accounted this such a highe priuilege geuen to the Philippiens when he saied, It is geuen vnto you, 
                     Philip. 1. 
                     not onelie to beleeue in IESVS Christ, but also to suffer for him, and to haue the same cōbat vvhich you haue seene in me, and novv heare of me? Al this is no maruaile (I save,) seing that suffering with Christ, and bearing the crosse with Christ, is as great a prefermēt in the court of heauen, as it should be in an earthlie courte for the prince to take of his owne garment, & to laye it on the backe

of one of his seruantes.
                  Of this now foloweth an other consequent 4. TRIBVlation a signe of predestinatiō. of singular consolation in time of affliction; and that is, that tribulation (especiallie when grace is also geuen to beare it patientlie) is a great coniecture of our predestination to eternal life. For, so much doe al those argumentes before touched, insinuate. As also on the cōtrary part, to liue in continual prosperitie, is a dreadful signe of euerlasting reprobatiō. This point is maruailouslie proued by S. Paul vnto the hebrewes, and greatlie Heb. 12. vrged. And Christ geueth a plaine signification in S. Luke, when he saieth; Happie 
                     Luc. 6. 
                     are you that vveepe novv, for you shal laugh. And on th' other side; VVoe be vnto you that laugh novv, for you shal vveepe: vvoe be vnto you rich men, vvhich haue your consolation here in this life. And yet more vehementlie then al this, doth the saying of Abraham to the riche man in hel, (or rather Christs wordes parabolicallie attributed vnto Abraham) confirme this matter. For he saieth to the riche man complayning of his torment: Remēber child, that thou receauedst 
                     Luc. 16. 
                     good things in thy life time. He doth not say (as S. Barnard wel noteth) rapuisti, thou tokest them by violence, but recepisti, thou receauedst them. And yet, this now is obiected against him for a sufficient cause of his damnation as wee see. Holy Dauid handleth this matter in diuers places, but purposelie in two of his psalmes, Psal. 27. & 143. and that at large. And after long search,

and much admiration, his conclusion of wicked mē prospering aboue other in the world, is this: Veruntamen propter dolos posuisti 
                     Psal. 37. Ver. 18. 
                     eis, deiecisti eos dum alleuarentur. 
                     Thou hast geuen them prosperitie (ô Lord) to deceaue them withal; and thou hast indeed throwen them downe, by exalting them:  That is; thou hast throwen them downe to the sentence of damnation in thy secret and inscrutable determination.
                  Here then the comparison of S. Gregorie Com. in Iob. taketh place; that as the oxen appointed to the slaughter, are let runne to feed at their pleasure, and the other A comparison of S. Gregorie. kept vnder dailie labour of the yoke: so fareth it with euil and good men. In like maner, the tree that beareth no fruite, is neuer beaten (as we see) but onelie the fruitful; & yet th' other (as Christ saieth) is reserued for the fire. The sick man that Ma. 3. 7. Ep. Iud. is past al hope of life, is suffered by the phisition to haue whatsoeuer he lusteth after; but he whos health is not dispaired, can not haue that libertie graunted. To conclude, the stones that must serue for 3. Re. 6. the glorious temple of Salomon, were hewed, beaten, and polished without the Church, at the quarrie side, for that no stroke of hammer might be heard within the temple. S. Peter saieth, that the vertuous 1. Pet. 2. are chosen stones, to be placed in the spiritual building of God in heauen, where there is no beating, no sorow, no tribulation. Here then in this life must we Apo. 21.
                     
be polished, hewed, and made fit for that glorious tēple; here (I say) in the quarrie of this world; here must we be fined, here must we feele the blowe of the hammer, and be most gladde when we heare or feele the same; for that it is a signe of our election, to that most glorious house of Godes eternal mansion.
                  
                     BESIDES THIS matter of predestination 5. TRIRVlatiō bringeth the cōpany of God him self. Psal. 90. and election, there is yet an other thing of no smal comfort to the godlie afflicted, founded on these wordes of almightie God, cum ipso sum in tribulatione; I am with him in tribulation. Wherby is promised the companie of God him self in affliction and persecution. This is a singular motiue (saith S. Barnard) to stirre men vp to embrace tribulation, seing that euen in this world for good companie, men aduenture to doe many hard and difficult things. Ioseph was caried captiue into Egypt, and God went downe with Gen. 37 Sap. 10 him (as the scripture saieth:) yea more then that, he went into the dongeon, and was in chaines with him. Sidrach Misach and Abdenago were cast into a burning fornace, and presentlie there was a fourth sene, that did beare them companie; of whom Nabuchodonasor saieth thus:  did Dan. 3 we not put three men onelie bound into the fire? And his seruantes answered, yea verilie Sir. But behold (sayeth he) I see fower men vnbounde walking in the middest of the fire; and the shape of the fourth is like the sonne of God. Christ

restored, as he passed by, a certaine beggar vnto his sight, which had bene blind from his natiuitie. For which thing, the man being soone after called in question, and speaking somewhat in the praise of Ioh. 9 Christ, for the benefit receaued; he was cast out of the sinagoge by the pharasies. Note this example. Wherof Christ hearing, sought him out presentlie, and conforting his hart, bestowed vpon him the light of minde, much more of importāce then that of the bodie geuen vnto him before. By this and like examples it appeareth, that a man is no sooner in affliction and tribulation for iustice sake, but streight waie Christ is at hand to beare him companie: and if his eyes might be opened, as the eyes of Elizeus his disciple was, to see his companions, the troupes of Angels (I meane) 4. Re. 16 which attend vpon their Lord in this his visitation: no doubt but his hart wold greatlie be comforted therwith.
                  
                     BVT THAT which the eye can not see, the soule feeleth; that is, she feeleth 6. THE assistance of Gods grace in tribulation. the assistance of Gods grace amiddest the depth of al tribulations. This he hath promised againe and again; this he hath sworne; and this he performeth most faithfullie to al those that suffer meeklie for his name. This S. Paul most certainlie assured him self of, when he saied, that he did glorie in al his infirmities and tribulations, to the end that Christ his vertue might dwel in him; that is to say, to the end that Christ should assist him more

abundantly with his grace. Cūenim infirmor, tunc potens sum; 
                     for when I am in most infirmitie, then am I most strong, saith he. That is, the more tribulations and afflictions are layed vpon me, the more potent is the aide of Iesus Christ his grace vnto me. And therfore the same Apostle writeth thus of him self and of al th' other Apostles together; VVe suffer tribulation in al things, but yet vve are not distressed; vve are 
                     2. Co. 4 
                     brought into perplexities, but yet vve are not forsaken; vve suffer persecution, but yet vve are not abandoned; vve are throvvē dovvne to the ground, but yet vve perish not. This thē ought to be a most sure and secure staffe in the hand of al Christians afflicted, that whatsoeuer befal vnto them, death or life, yet the grace of almightie God wil neuer faile to hold them vp, & beare thē out therin. for most true and certaine is that saying of S. Austen, so often repeated by him in Ser. 88 de temp. & de nat. & gr. ca. 26. his workes; that God neuer forsaketh anie man, except he be reiected and forsaken by man first.
                  
                     FOR THE LAST reason of comfort in affliction, I wil ioine two thinges 7. 8. SHORT time of suffering, and great revvard. 2. Co. 4 together, of great sorce and efficacie in this matter. The first wherof, is the expectation of rewarde: th' other is the shortnes of time wherein we haue to suffer: both are touched by S. Paul in one sentence, when he saith, that a litle, and momentanie tribulatiō in this vvorld, vvorketh an eternal poise of glory in the hight of neauen. By momentanie, he sheweth thē litle time we

haue to suffer: and by eternal poise of glorie, he expresseth the incomprenensible greatnes of the reward prepared in heauen for recompence of that suffering. Christ also ioineth both thes comfortes together, whē he saieth: Behold I come quicklie, 
                     Apo. 22. 
                     and my revvard is vvith me. In that he promiseth to come quicklie, he signifieth that our tribulation shal not enduie long; and by that he bringeth his reward with him, he assureth vs that he wil not come emptie hāded, but redie furnished, to recompence our labour throughly. And what greater meanes of encouragement, deare brother, could he vse then this? If a man did beare a verie heauy burden, yet if he were sure to be wel paied for his labour, and that he had but a litle way to 
                        〈◊〉
                      
                     
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         comparison. the same, he would straine him self greatlie, to goe through to his waies end, rather then for sparing so short a labour, to leese so large and so present a reward. This is our Lordes most mercirul dealing with vs, to comfort vs in our affliction, and to animate vs to hold out māfully for a time, though for the present the poise seeme heauie on our shoulders. The comming of Iac. 5. Mat. 11. Apoc. 7. 21. Gal. 6. our Lord is euen at hand, and the iudge is before the gates, who shal refresh vs, and wipe away al our teares, and place vs in his kingdom to reape ioy without fainting. And then shal we prooue the saying of holy S. Paul to be true; That the sufferinges of this vvorld are not vvoorthie of that glorie 
                     Rom. 8 
                     vvhich shalbe reuealed in vs. And this may be

sufficient for the reasons left vs of comfort in tribulation and affliction.
               
               
                  The fourth part.
                  
                     AND THVS now hauing performed Hovv VVE 
                           〈◊〉
                         behaue our selues in tune of tribulation. the first three partes before promised; there remaineth onelie to saye a worde or two of the fourth; which is, what we haue to doe for our partes in time of persecution tribulation and affliction. And this might be dispatched in saying onelie that we haue to conforme ourselues to the wil and meaning of almightie God, vttered before in the causes of tribulation. But yet for more ease and better remembrance of the same, I wil breeflie runne ouer the principal pointes, that are to be borne in memorie.
                  
                     AND FIRST of al, we should indeuour 1. To REioice. to aspire vnto that perfectiō, wherof our Sauiour speaketh, & wherunto he exhorteth vs when he saith, gaudete & exultate. reioyse and triumph in your aduersities. Or els if our corrupt and lumpish nature Luc. 6. wil not permit vs to arriue vnto this so singular a perfectiō; yet ought we at least wise to performe that which the Apostle so expresly commandeth when he saieth, Iacob. 1 
                     omne gaudium existimate cum in varias tentatianes incideritis, esteeme it a matter worthie of al ioye, when ye fal into diuers temptations; that is, if we can not reioyse at it in deede, yet ought we to thincke it a matter in it self worthie of reioysing; reprehending our selues, for that we can

not reach vnto it. And if we cā not mount thus high nether, (as in deede we ought to doe) yet in anie case to remēber, what in an other place he saieth: patientia vobis 
                     Heb. 10 
                     necessaria est, vt reportetis promissionem: 
                     You must of necessitie haue patience, if you wil receaue Gods promisse of euerlasting life.
                  
                  
                     SECONDLIE, we ought to doe as 2. To COME to God by seruent prayer. Mat. 8. the Apostles did, when they were in the most terrible tempest of the sea (Christ being with them, but a sleepe;) that is, we must goe and awake him; we must crie vnto him with the prophet: Exurge, quare obdormis domine? O Lord arise, why doest Psal. 43 thou sleepe in our miserie? This wakening of Christ doth please him wonderfullie, as before hath bene shewed; but especialie if it be done, with that assured confidence of true affectioned children, wherwith S. Marke describeth the Apostles to haue awakened Christ. For their wordes were Marc. 4 these; Maister, doth it not appertaine vnto the, that vve perish here? As who would saie, are not we thy Disciples and seruantes? art not thou our Lord and Maister? is not the cause thine? is not al our trust and hope in the? how chaunceth it then, that thou sleepest and sufferest vs to be thus tossed & tombled, as if we appertained nothing vnto the? With this zele and affection praied holy Esaye, when he sayed; attend Esa. 63. (o Lord) from heauen; looke hither from the holie habitation of thy glorie; where is thy zeale? where is thy fortitude? where

is the multitude of thy merciful bowels? Haue they shut thē selues vp now towards vs? thow art our father, Abraham hath not knowen vs, & Israel hath bene ignorant of vs; thow art our Father (ô Lord) turne thy self about for thy seruāres sake, for loue of the tribe of thine inheritance. Thus I say we must cal vpon God; thus we must awake him, when he seemeth to sleepe in our miseries; with earnest, with deuout, with continual prayer; alwaies hauing in our minde that most comfortable parable of Christ, wherin he saieth, Luc. 11 that if we should come to our neighbours dore, and knocke at midnight to borowe some bread, when he were in bedde with his children, and most loth to rise: yet if wee perseuer in asking and beating at his dore stil, though he were not our freend, yet would he rise at length, and geue vs our demaunde, therby at least to be ridde of our crying. And how much more wil God doe this (saieth Christ) who both loueth vs, and tendreth our case most mercifullie?
                  But yet here is one thing to be noted in this matter: and that is, that Christ suffered An important note. Mat. 8.
                      the shippe almost to be couered with waues (as th' Euangelist saieth) before he wold awake; therby to signifie, that the measure of temptations is to be left onelie vnto him self. It is sufficient for vs to rest vpon the Apostles wordess He is faithful, and therfore he vvil not suffer vs 
                     1. Co. 10 
                     to be tempted aboue our strength. We may not

examine or mistrust his doings; we maye not inquire why he doth this; or why he suffereth that; or how long wil he permit the euils to raigne. God is a great God in al his doings; and when he sendeth tribulation, he sendeth a great deale together, to the ende he maye shew his God permitteth temptations to grovv great before he remedy. great power in deliuering vs, and recompence it after, with greate measure of cō
                     fort. His temptations often times doe goe very deepe, therby to trie the verie hartes and reines of men. He went farre with Elias, when he caused him to flie into a mountaine, and there most desirous of death, to saye; They haue killed al thy prophetes (o Lord) and I am left alone, and novv they seek 
                     3. Re. 19 
                     to kil me also. 
                     He went farre with Dauid, whē he made him crie out: why dost thou forget my pouertie and tribulation? And Psal. 30. in an other place againe: I saied with my self in the excesse of my mind; I am cast out from the face of thy eies, ô Lord. God went farre with the Aposties, when he 2. Cor. 1. enforced one of them to writ, we wil not haue you ignorant (brethren) of our tribulation in Asia, wherein we were oppressed aboue al measure, and aboue al strength; in so much as it lothed vs to liue any longer. But yet aboue al others, he went furthest with his owne deare sonne, when he cōstrained him to vtter thos pitiful and most lamentable wordes vpon the crosse; My God, my God, vvhy hast thou for 
                     Mat. 27 Psal. 21 
                     saken me? Who can now complaine of any proofe or temptation what soeuer laid

vpon him, seing God would goe so farre with his owne deare and onely sonne?
                  
                     HEROF then enseweth the third 3. MAGNAnimitie vvith a strōg faith. thing necessarie vnto vs in tribulation: which is magnanimitie; grounded vpon a strong and inuincible faith of Gods assistance, and of our final deliuerance, how long soeuer he delay the matter, and how terrible soeuer the storme doe seeme for the time. This God require that our hādes, as maye be seene by the example of the disciples, who cried not, vve perish; before Mat. 8. Luc. 8. the waues had couered the ship, as Saint Mathew writeth: and yet Christ saied vnto them, abi est sides vestra, where is your faith? S. Peter also was not a feard vntil he was almost vnder water, as the same Euangelist recordeth; and yet Christ reprehended Mat. 14 him saying, thou man of litle saith, vvhy diddest thou doubte? What then must we doe in this case, deare brother? surelie we must put on that magnanimous faith of valiant king Dauid, who vpon the most assured trust he had of Gods assistance, saied, In deo meo transgrediar murum; In the helpe of my God I wil goe through a wal. Psal. 17 Of which inuincible saith S. Paul was also, when he saied: Omnia possumineo qui me 
                     Phil. 4. 
                     consortat; I can doe al thinges in him that comforteth and strengtheneth me. Nothing is vnpossible, nothing is to harde for me, by his assistance. We must be (as Prou. 28 the scripture saieth) quasi leo considens abs
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         terrore. Like a bolde and confident lion, which is without terrour; that is, we

must not be astonied at anie tempest, atanie tribulation, at anie aduersitie; we must saye with the prophet Dauic, experienced Psal. 3. in thes matters; I vvil not feare many thousandes of people that should enuironne or 
                     Psal. 21 Psal. 26 
                     beseege me together. If I should vvalke amiddest the shadovv of death, I vvil not feare. If vvhole armies should stand against me, yet my hart should not tremble. My hope is in God, & therfore I vvil not feare vvhat man can doe vnto me. God is my helper, and I vvil not feare vvhat stesh can doe vnto me. God is my he per, and protector, and 
                     Psal. 55 
                     therfore I vvil despise and contemne mine enemies. And an other prophet in like sense: Psa. 117 Esaie 
                           〈◊〉
                        . 
                     Behold, God is my Sauiour, and therfore vvil I deale considentlie, and vvil not feare. Thes were the speeches of holy prophetes; of men that knew wel what they saied, and had often tasted of affliction, them selues; and therfore could say of their owne experience, how infallible Gods assistance is therin.
                  To this supreme courage, magnanimitie, and Christian fortitude, the scripture 4. Christian fortitude. Eccl. 10 Eccl. 4. exhorteth vs, when it saieth; If the spirit of one that is an authoritie, doe rise against thee; see thou yeeld not from thy place vnto him. And againe, an other scripture saith: striue for iustice, euen to the losse of thy life; and stand for equitie vnto death it self, & God shal ouerthrow thine enemies for thee.
                     And Christ him self yet more effectually Luc. 12. recom nēdeth this matter in thes wordes; 
                      I say vnto you my freendes, be not a fearde of them vvhich kil the body, and aftervvard haue
nothing els to doe against you.
 And S. Peter addeth 1. Pet. 3. further, 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         cōturbemini; That is, doe not onely not feare them, but (which is lesse) doe not so much as be troubled for al that flesh and blood cā doe against you.
                  Christ goeth further in the Apocalips, Christs exhortation to magnammitte. Apoc. 2.
                      and vieth maruailous speeches to entise vs to this forticude. For thes are his wordes; he that hath an eare to heare, let him heare what the spirit saith vnto the churches. To him that shal conquere, I wil geue to eate of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God. This saieth the first and the last, he that was dead, and now is a liue: I know thy tribulation, and thy pouertie: but thou art riche in deed, and art blasphemed by thos that say they are true Israelites, and are not, but are rather the Sinagogue of Satan. Feare nothing of that which you are to suffer; behold, the deuil wil cause some of you to be thrust into prison, to the end you may be tempted: & you shal haue tribulation for Thos tenne daies some thinke to haue bene the tenne general persecutions, vvithin the first 300. yeres, after Christ. Cap. 3.
                         tēne daies. But be faithful vnto death, and I wil geue the a croune of life. He that hath an eare to heare, let him heare what the spirit saieth vnto the churches. He that shal ouercome, shal not be hurt by the second death. And he that shal ouercome, and shal keepe my workes vnto the end, I wil geue vnto him authoritie ouer nations, euen as I haue receaued it from my father; and I wil geue him besides, the morning starre. He that shal ouercome, shalbe appareled in white garmentes; and I wil not blot

his name out of the booke of life, but wil confesse his name before my father, and before his Angels. Behold, I come quicklie; hold fast that thou hast, lest an other man receaue thy croune. He that shal conquere, I wil make him a pillar in the temple of my God, & he shal neuer goe foorth more; and I wil write vpon him the name of my God, and the name of the citie of my God, which is new Ierusalem. He that shal conquere, I wil geue vnto him to sit with me in my throne; euen as I haue conquered, and doe sit with my father in his throne.
                  
                  Hitherto are the wordes of Christ to S. Iohn. And in the end of the same booke, after he had described the ioyes and glorie of heauen at large, he concludeth thus; And he that fate on the throne said to me. Write thes wordes, for that they are most faithful and true,  
                     Qui vicerit possidebit haec, & ero illi Deus, & ille erit mihi

                     He that shal conquer, shal possesse al the ioyes that I haue here spokē of; and I wil be his God, and he shal be my sonne. But A terrible

                  Here now we see both allurements & threates; both good and euil: life & death: Eccl. 18. the ioyes of heauen, and the burning lake

of hel proposed vnto vs. We may streach out our handes vnto which we wil. If we fight and conquere (as by Gods grace vve may) then are we to enioy the promises laid doune before. If we shew our selues ether vnbeleuing in thes promises, or feareful to take the sight in hand, being offered vnto vs, then fal we into the danger of the contrarie threates; euen as S. Iohn affirmeth in an other place, that certaine noble men did, amōg the Iewes; who beleeued Ioh. 12. in Christ, but yet durst not confesse him, for feare of persecution.
                  
                     HERE THEN must ensew an other 5. A FIRME resolution. vertue in vs, most necessary to al tribulation and affliction; and that is, a strong & firme resolution, to stand and go through, what opposition or contradiction soeuer we find in the world, ether of fauning flatterie, or of persecuting crueltie. This the scripture teacheth crying vnto vs, esto

                        . Sydrach, Misach, & Abdenago, when hauing heard the flattering speech, and infinite threates of cruel Nabuchodonasor,

they answered with a quiet spirit; O king Dan. 3. we may not answere you, to this long speech of yours. For behold our God is able (if he wil) to deliuer vs from this furnace of fire which you threaten, and from al that you cā doe othervvise against vs. But yet if it should not please him so to doe; you must know (Sir king) that we doe not worshippe your goddes, nor yet adore your, golden: Idole, which you haue set vp.
                  
                  This resolution had Peter and Iohn, who being so often brought before the councel, and both commanded, threatned, and beaten, to the end they should talke no more of Christ, they answered stil; Obedire 
                     Act. 4. 5. 
                     oportet Deo magis quam hominibus, we must obey God, rather then men. The same had S. Paul also, when being requested with S. Paul. teares of the Christians in Cesarea, that he wold forbeare to goe to Ierusalem, for Act. 21. that the holie Ghost had reuealed to manie, the troubles which expected him there: he answered;  what meane you to wepe thus, and to afflict my hart? I am not onelie readie to be in bondes for Christs name in Ierusalem, but also to suffer death for the same. And in his epistle to the Romanes, Rom. 
                              〈◊〉
                           . he yet further expresseth this resolution of his, when he sayeth: what thē shal we saye to these thinges? if God be with vs, who wil be against vs? who shal separate vs from the loue of Christ? shal tribulation? shal distresse? shal hungar? shal nakednes? shal peril? shal persecution? shal

I am certaine that nether death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor strength, nor height, nor depth, nor any creature els, shalbe able to separate vs frō the loue of God, which is in Iesus Christ, our Lord.
                  
                  Finallie, this was the resolution of al the holie Martyrs and Confessors, and Of Martyrs. other seruantes of God: wherby they haue withstood the temptations of the deuil, the allurementes of flesh and bloode, and al the persecutions of tirants, exacting things vnlauful at their handes. I wil alleage one example more out of holy scripture, and that before the comming of Christ, but yet nigh vnto the same; and therfore no manuaile (as the holy fathers doe note) though it tooke some heate of Christian feruour and constancie towardes martyrdome. The example is wounderful, for that in mans sight it was but for a smal matter required at their hādes, by the tirantes commandement; that is, onelie to eate a peece of swines flesh: for thus it is recorded in the scripture.
                  It hapened seuen brethren to be apprehended together in those dayes, and to be broght (with their mother) to the tyrannous 2. Mac. 7 A maruailous constā

out of vs, ô king? we are readie here rather to die, then to breake the auncient lawes of our God. Wherat the king being greatlie offended, commanded the frying pānes and pottes of brasse to be made burning hote; which being redie, he caused this first mannes tongue to be cut of, together with the toppes of his fingers and toes, as also with the skinne of his head, the mother and other brethern loking on; & after this he caused him to be fried vntil he was dead. Which being done, the second brother was brought to torment, & after his heare pluckt of from his head together with the skinne, they asked him whether he wold yet eate swinnes flesh or no, before he was put to the rest of his tormentes? wherto he answered, noe: & thervpon was (after many tormentes) slaine with the other. Who being dead the third was taken in hand, and being willed to put forth his tongue, he held it forth quicklie together with bothe his handes, to be cut of, saying confidentlie: A vvorthie saying. 
                        I receaued both tongue and handes from heauen, and novv I despise them bothe for the lavve of God, for that I hope to receaue them al of him againe.
                     
                  
                  
                     And after they had in this forte tormented and put to death six of the brethrē, euerie one most cōstantly protesting his faith, and the ioye he had to die for Gods cause; there remained onelie the yongest, whome Antiochus (being ashamed that he could peruert neuer a one of

the former) endeuoured by al meanes possible to draw from his purpose, by promising and swearing, that he should be a rich and happie man, and one of his checi frē
                        des, if he wold yeld. But when the youth was nothing moued ther with, Antiochus called to him the mother, and exhorted her to saue her sonnes life, by persuading him to yeld; which she feigning to doe, therby to haue libertie to speake to her sonne; she made a most vehement exhortation to him in the hebrew tongue, to slād A noble example of a mother. to it, and to die for his conscience; which speech being ended, the youth cried owt with a loud voice, and vttered this noble sentence worthie to be remembred. Qucon suslinetis? non obtempero praecepto regis, sed praecepto legis: Whom doe you staye for? I doe not obey the commandement of the king, but the commādement of the law of God. Wher vpon both he and his mother were presentlie (after many and sundrie tormentes) put to death.
                  This then is the constant and immouable resolution which a Christian man should haue in al aduersitie of this life. Wher of S. Ambrose saieth thus. Gratia praeparandus est animus, exercenda mens, & stabilienda

                      Our minde is to be prepared with grace, to be exercised, and to be so established in constancie, as it may, not be troubled with anie terrours, brokē with any aduersities, yeld to anie punishmentes

or tormentes whatsoeuer. 
                  
                  IF YOV aske me here how a man 6. Hovv a man may come to an inuincible resolution. may come to this former resolution; I answere, that S. Ambrose in the same place, putteth two waies how to attaine the same: the one is, to remember the endles & intolerable paines of hel, if we haue it not, or doe yeld against our own cōscience for feare: the other is, to think of the vnspeakable glorie of heauen, if we perseuer constant. Whereto I wil adde the thirde, which with a noble hart, may perhappes preuaile as much as either of thē both: and that is, to consider what others haue suffered before vs, especiallie Christ him self, and that onelie of mere Ioue and affection towardes vs. We see that in this world, louing subiectos doe glorie of nothing more, then of their daungers or hurtes taken in bataille for their prince, though he neuer tooke blowe for them againe. What thē would they doe, if their prince had bene afflicted voluntarilie for them, as Christ hath bene for vs? But if this great example of Christ seeme vnto the to high to imitate: looke vpon some of thy brethren before thee, made of flesh and blood as thou art; see what they haue suffered before they could enter into heauen; and thinke not thy self hardlie dealt withal, if thou be called to suffer a litle also.
                  Saint Paul writeth of al the Apostles 2. Cor. 4 The sufferings of the Apostles.
                      together;
Euen vnto this houre we suffer hungar and thirst, & lacke of apparel; we
are beaten with mennes fistes; we are'vagabondes, not hauing where to staie: we labour and worke with our owne handes: we are cursed, and we doe blesse: we are persecuted, and we take it patientlie: we are blasphemed, and we pray for them that blaspheme vs: we are made as it were the verie out-castes and purgings of this world euen vnto this day:  That is, though we be Apostles, though we haue wrought so many miracles, and conuerted so many millions of people: yet euen vnto this day are we thus vsed. And a litle after, describing 2. Cor. 6 yet further their liues, he saieth: we shew our selues as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulations, in necessities, in distresses, in beatinges, in imprisonmentes, 1. Co. II The particular sufferinges of S. Paul. in seditions, in labours, in watches, in fastinges, in chastitie, in longanimitie, in sweetnes of behauiour.  And of him self in particular he saieth, In laboribus plurimis, &c. 
                     I am the minister of God in many labours, in imprisonments more then the rest in beatinges aboue measure, and oftentimes in death it self. Fiue times haue I bene beaten of the Iewes, and at euery time had fortie lashes lacking one: three times haue I bene whipt with roddes: once I was stoned: three times haue I suffered ship wrake: A day and a night was I in the bottome of the sea: oftentimes in iourneys, in dangers of fluddes: in dāgers of theeues: in dangers of Iewes: in dāgers of Gentiles: in dangers of the citie: in dā
                        gers of wildernes: in dangers of sea: in

dangers of false brethren: in labour and trauaile: in much watching: in hungar and thirst: in much fasting: in cold and lack of clothes and besides al thes external thinges, the matters that dailie doe depēd vpō me, for my vniuersal care of al Churches.
                  
                  By this we may see now, whether Christs holy Apostles taught vs more by Hovv Christ suffred the Apostles to vvant. wordes, then they shewed by their owne examples, about the necessitie of suffering in this life. Christ might haue prouided for them if he would, at leastwise thinges necessarie to their bodies, and not haue suffered them to come into thes great extremities of lacking clothes to their backes, meate to their mouthes, and houses to pat their heades in. He that gaue thē authoritie to doe so manie other miracles, might haue suffered them also to haue procured sufficient maintenance for their bodies, which should be the first miracle that worldly men would worke, if they had such authoritie. Christ might haue saied to Peter when he sent him to take his tribut from out of the fishes mouth; take so much more, as wil suffice for your Mat. 17. necessary expēces, when you trauaile ouer foraine countries. But he woulde not, nor yet diminish the great afflictions which I haue shewed before, though he loued them as dearely, as euer he loued his owne soule. Al which was done, (as S. Peter interpreteth) to geue vs example, 1. Pet. 2. what to folow, what to looke for, what to desire, what to comsort our selues in,

amiddest the greatest of al our tribulatiōs.
                  Saint Paul vseth this, as a principal consideration, Heb. 12. when he writeth thus to the Hebrewes, vpon the recital of the sufferinges A notable exhortatiō of S. Paul. of other saintes before thē. Wherfore we also (brethren saieth he) hauing so great a multitude of witnesses (that haue suffered before vs,) let vs lay of al burdens of sinne hanging vpon vs; and let vs runne by patience vnto the battaile offered vs, fixing our eyes vpon the authour of our saith, and fulfiller of the same, IESVS; who putting the ioyes of heauen before his eyes, sustained patiētly the Crosse, contemning the shame and confusion therof, and therfore now sitteth at the right hand of the seate of God. Thinke vpon him (I say) which sustained such a contradictiō against him self, at the hādes of sinners: & be not wearie, nether faint yee in courage. For you haue not yet resisted against sinne vnto blood; and you haue for gotten (perhaps) that comfortable saying, which speaketh vnto you as vnto children: My sonne; doe not contemne the discipline of our Lord, and be not vvearie vvhee thou art chastised of him. For whom God Prou. 3. Iob. 5. Apoc. 3. loueth he chastiseth, and he whippeth euery sonne whom he receaueth. Perseuer therfore in the correctiō laied vpon you. God offereth him self to you as to his children. For what child is there whom the father correcteth not? if you be out of correction, wherof al his children are made partakers; then are you bastardes, &

not children. Al correction, for the present time when it is suffered, seemeth vnpleasant and sorowful; but yet after, it bringeth foorth most quiet fruite of iustice, vnto them that are exercised by it. Wherfore, strengthen vp your wearie handes, and loosed knees; make way to your feete. &c. That is, take courage vnto you, and goe forward valiantly vnder the Crosse laied vpon you. This was the exhortation of this holy captaine vnto his countrie man (souldiers of IESVS Christ) the Iewes.
                  Saint Iames the brother of our Lord vseth an other exhortation in his Catholike 
                        Iac. 5. The exhartation of S. Iames. epistle to al Catholikes, not much different from this. Be you therfore patient my brethren (saith he) vntil the cō
                        ming of our Lord. Beholde, the husbandman expecteth for a time, the fruite of the earth, so pretious vnto him, bearing patientlie vntil he may receaue the same in his season; be you therfore patient, and comfort your hartes, for that the cōming of our Lord wil shortlie draw neere. Be not sadde, and complaine not one of an other. Beholde the Iudge is euen at the gate. Take the prophetes for an example of labour and patience, who spake vnto vs in the name of God. Beholde, we account them blessed which haue suffered. You haue heard of the sufferance of Iob, and you haue seene (Isa, e) that our Lord is merciful and ful of compassion.
                  
                  I might here alleage many things more

out of the scripture to this purpose, for The conclusion. that the scripture is moste copious herein: and in verie deed, if it should al be melted and poured out, it would yeld vs nothing els almost, but touching the crosse, and patient bearing of tribulatiō in this life. But I must end, for that this chapter groweth to long, as the other did before. And therfore I wil onelie, for my conclusion, set down the confession and most excellent exhortation of olde Mathathias, in the time of the cruel persecution of Antiochus against the Iewes. The storie is thus reported in the scripture.
                  
                     At that time the officers of Antiochus said vnto Mathathias; thou art a prince, 1. Mac. 2 The confession & exhortatiō of Mathathias. & of greatest estate in this citie, adorned with children and brethern; come thou therfore first, and doe the kinges commā
                        dement, as other men haue done in Iuda and Ierusalem, and thou and thy children shalbe the kings freends, and enriched with gold and siluer, and many giftes frō him. Wherto Mathathias answered with a loude voice: if al nations should obey Antiochus, to depart from the obedience of the lawes of their auncestours; yet I, & my children and brethern wil folow the lawes of our fathers; Let God be merciful vnto vs at his pleasure, &c. And the daies came of Mathathias his death, and then he saied vnto his children. Now is the time that pride is in her strength. Now is the time of chastisemēt towardes vs, the time Note. of euersion & indignation is come. Now

therfore (ô Children) be you zelous in the lawe of God: yeld vp your liues for the testament of your fathers; remember the workes of your auncestours, what they haue done in their generations, and so shal you receaue great glorie, and eternal name. Was not Abraham found faithful Gen. 12. Gen. 41. Num. 25 in time of temptation, and it was reputed vnto him for iustice? Ioseph in time of his distresse kept Gods commandementes, and was made Lord ouer al Egypt. Phinees our Father, for his zeale towardes the lawe of God, receaued the testament Iosue. 1. Iud. 14. 2. Re. 2. 4. Re. 2. of an euerlasting presthode. Iosue for that he fulfilled Gods word, was made a captaine ouer al Israel. Caleb for that he testified in the Church, receaued an inheritance. Dauid for his mercie, obteined Dan. 3. the seat of an eternal kingdome. Elias for that he was zealous in zeale of the lawe, was taken vp to heauen. Ananias Azarias Dan. 9. and Misael through their beleefe, were deliuered from the flame of the fire. Daniel for his simplicitie, was deliuered frō the mouth of lions. And so doe you runne ouer, by cogitation, al generations, and you shal see that al those that hope in God shal not be vanquished. And doe you not seare the vvordes of a sinful man; for his glorie is nothing 
                        A vvorthie saying. 
                        els but dung and vvormes; to daie he is great and exalted, and to morovv he shal not be found; for he shal returne vnto his earth againe, and al his fond cogitations shal perishe. Wherfore take courage vnto you (my children) and plaie the men in the lawe

of God. For ther in shal be your honour & glorie. Hitherto are the wordes of scripture, which shal suffice for the end of this chapter.
               
            
            
               THE FOVRTH AND GREATEST IMPEDIMENT THAT HINdereth resolution, to witte: The loue and respect vvhich men beare to the pleasures and vanities of this vvorld. CHAPT. IIII.
               AS the former impedimentes which now by Gods grace we haue remoued, be in verie deed great staies to many mē, from the resolutiō we talke of: so this that presently we take in hand, is not onely of it self a strong impediment and let; but also a general cause & (as it were) a commō ground to al other impedimentes that be or may be. For if a man could touch the hidden pulse of al

such as refuse, or neglect, or doe differre to make this resolution: he should find the The vvorld the ground of al other impedimentes. true cause & origine therof, to be the loue and respect which they beare vnto this world, what soeuer other excuses they pretend besides. The noble men of Iewrie, pretended feare to be the cause, why they could not resolue to coniesse Christ openly: but S. Iohn that felt their-pulses, and knew their disease, vttereth the true cause to haue bene, for that they loued the glory 
                  Ioh. 12. 
                  of men, more then the glory of God. Demas that for sooke S. Paul in his bandes, euen a litle before his death, pretended an other cause of his departure to Thellalonica, but S. Paul saieth it was, quia diligebat hoc seculū; 
                  2. Ti. 4. for that he loued this world. So that this world is a general and vniuersal impediment, and more largely dispersed in mens hartes thē outwardly appeareth; for that it bringeth forth diuers other excuses, therby to couer it self in the people wher it abideth.
               This may be confirmed by that most excellent Mat. 13. Marc. 4. Luc. 8. parable of our Sauiour Christ, recorded by three Euangelistes, concerning the three sortes of men which are to be damned, and the three causes of their damnation; wher of the third, and last, & most general (including as it were both the two former) is, the loue of this world. For the first sorte of men ther mentioned, are  compared to a high waie, wherin al seed of life that is sowen, ether withereth presentlie, or els is eaten vp by the birdes of

the ayer; which is, (as Christ expoundeth The exposuion of the parable of she seed. it) by the deuils, in such careles men, as contemne what-soeuer is said vnto thē; such are insidels, heretikes, and other like obstinate and contemptuous people. The second sorte of damnable people are compared  to rockie groundes, in which, for lacke of depe roote, the seed that falleth continueth not; and by this are signified, light and vnconstant persons, that now choppe in, and now runne owt; now are seruent, and by and by keie-colde againe; & so in time of tēptation, they are gone; saith Christ. The third sorte are compared to a feild, wherin the seed of life  groweth vp, but yet there are so many thornes about the same (which one father expoundeth to be the cares, troubles, miseries, and deceinable vanities of this life) as the good corne is choked vp, and bringeth soorth no fruite. By which last wordes lie signifieth, that whersoeuer the doctrine of Christ groweth vp, & yet bringeth not forth due fruite: that is to saie, whersoeuer his faith is planted receaued and professed, (as among Christians it is,) and yet bringeth not forth vertuous life, holie conuersation, good workes, and due seruice of God corespōdent to this seed; ther the principal cause is, for that it is choked with the loue and care of this present world.
               This is a parable of maruailous greate The importance of this varable. importance, as may appeare; both for that Christ after the recital therof, cried out

with a lowde voice: He that hath eares to 
                  Mat. 13. 
                  heare, let him heare: As also, for that he expounded it him self in secrete onelie to his Disciples: And principallie, for that before the exposition therof, he vsed such a solemne preface; saying; to you it is geuen to knovv the misteries if the kingdome of heauen, but to others not: for that they seing doe not see, and hearing doe not heare nor vnder stand. Wherby Christ signifieth, that the vnderstanding of this parable, among others, is of singular importance, for conceauing the true misteries of the kingdome of heauen; and that many are blinde, which seeme to see; and many deafe and ignorant, that seeme to heare and know: for that they vnderstand not wel the misteries of this parable. For which cause also his diuine wisdome maketh this conclusion, before he beginne to expound the parable: Happie are your eies that see, and biessed are your eares that heare. After which wordes, he beginneth his exposition, with this admonitiō; Vos ergo audite parabolam, Doe you therfore heare and vnderstand this parable.
               And for that this parable doth containe and touch so much in deede, as may or is needful to be saied, for remouing of this greate and dangerous impediment of worldly loue: I meane to staie my self onelie vpon the explication the ros in this place, and wil declare the force and truth of certaine wordes here vttered by Christ of the world and worldlie pleasures. And forsome order and methodes sake, I wil

drawal to these six pointes folowing. Six partes of this chap.
               
               First; how and in what sense al this whole world and commodities therof are  meere vanities in them selues and of no value, as Christ here signifieth; and consequentlie, ought not to be an impedimēt, to let vs from so great a matter, as the kingdome of heauen and seruing of God is.
               Secondlie; how they are not onelie vanities  and trifles, but also Deceptions, as the wordes of Christ are; that is to say, deceyte, and fallaces, not performing to vs in deede, those litle trifles which they doe promise.
               Thirdlie; how they are spinae, that is,  pricking thornes, as our Saueour affirmeth; albeit they seeme to worldly men to be most sweet and pleasant thinges.
               Fourthlie; how they are arumnae, that  is to saie miseries and afflictions.
               Fiftlie; quomodo suffocant, how they  strangle or choke their possessours, according as the sonne of God in this parable auoucheth.
               Sixthlie; how we may vse them notwithstanding,  without these daungers & euils, and to our great comfort, gaine, and preferment.
               
                  The first point of the parable.
                  
                     AND NOVV for the first, albeit I 1. THE first parte: hovv al the vvorld is vanitie, might stande vpon many reasons and demonstrations; yet doe I not see how breefly & pithelie it may be better declared,

that al the pleasures and goodlie shewes of this world are mere vanities, as Christ here signifieth, then to alleage the testimonie & proofe of some, which hath tasted and proued them al; that is to say, of such an one, as speaketh not only by speculation, but also of his owne experience and practise. And this is the wise and mightie king Salomon; of whom the 2. Par. 9. scripture reporteth wounderful matters, touching his peace, prosperitie, riches, & The vvorld lie prosperitie of king Salomon. glorie in this world; as for example, that al the kings of the earth desired to see his face, for his wisdom and renowned felicitie; that al the princes liuing besides, were not like him in wealth; that he had six hundred sixtie and six talents of gold (which is an infinite somme) brought him in yerelie, besides al other that he had from the kinges of Arabia, & other princes; that siluer was as plentiful with him as heapes of stones, and not esteemed, for the great store & abundāce he had therof; that his plate and Iewelles had no end; that his seat of maiestie, with stooles, liōs to beare it vp, and other furniture, were of gold, passing al other kingely seates in the world; that his pretious apparel and armour was infinite; that he had al the kinges, from the riuer of the Philistians vnto Egypt, as his seruantes; that he had fortie thowsand horses in his stables to ride, and twelue thousand chariottes, with horses and other furniture redie to them for his vse; that he had two hundred

speares of gold borne before him, and six hundred crownes of gold bestowed vpon euerie speare; as also three hundred bucklers, and three hundred crownes of gold, bestowed in the guilding of euery buckler; that he spent euerie daie in his howse, a thousand nine hundred thirtie and seuen quarters of meale & flower; thirtie oxen, with an hundred wethers, beside al other 3.

Al this, and much more doth holie scripture report of Salomons worldlie wealth, wisdom, riches, ꝓsperitie: which he hauing tasted, and vsed to his fil; pronounced yet at the last this sentence of it al: Vanitas vanitatum, & omnia vanitas; Vanitie Eccl. 1. of vanities, and al is vanitie: by vanitie of vanities meaning, (as S. Ierome interpreteth) the greatnesse of this vanitie, In cap. 1. ecclesia. aboue al other vanities that may be deuised.
                  Nether only doth K. Salomon affirme Salomons saying of him self. Eccl. 1.
                      this thing in word, but doth proue it also by examples of himself. I haue bene king of Israel in Ierusalem (saith he,) and I purposed with my self, to seeke out by wisdom al things. And I haue seene, that al vnder the sunne, are meere vanities and affliction of spirit. I said in my hart, I wil goe and abound in al delites, and in euery pleasure that may be had: and I saw that Cap. 2. this was also vanitie. I toke great workes in hand, builded houses to my self, planted vineyardes, made orchardes and gardens,

& beset them with al kind of trees: I made my fish-pondes to water my trees: I possessed seruantes and hand-maides, & had a great familie, great heardes of cattel, aboue any that euer were before me in Ierusalem: I gathered together gold & siluer, the riches of kings and prouinces: I appointed to my self musitians and singers, both men and women, which are the delites of the children of men: fine cuppes also to drinke wine, and what soeuer my eyes did desire, I denied it not vnto them: nether did I let my harte from vsing any pleasure, to delite it self in these thinges which I had prepared. And whē I turned my self to al that my handes had made, & to al the labours wherin I had taken such paines and sweat; I sawe in them al, vanitie and affliction of the minde. 
                  
                  This is the testimonie of Salomon, The testimony of S. Iohn. vpon his own proofe, in these affaires; & if he had spoken it vpon his wisdom onely (being such as it was;) we ought to beleeue him; but much more, seing he affirmeth it of his own experience. But yet, if any man be not moued with this: let vs bring yet an other witnesse owt of the new testamēt, & such a one, as was priuie to the opiniō of our Sauiour Christ herin; and this is, the holie Euangelist & apostle 1. Ioan. 2. S. Iohn, who maketh an earnest exhortation to al wise men, neuer to intangle them selues with the loue of worldly affaires, vsing this reason for the same; mundus transit & concupiscentia eius, the world is

trāsitorie & al that is to be desired therin; that is to saie, it is vaine, fleeting, vncertaine, and not permanent; and then comming to shew the substance of this transitorie-vanitie, he reduceth them al to three general heades or branches, saying; vvhat so euer is in this vvorld, is either concupiscence of 
                     The general brāches of vvorldly vanities. 
                     the flesh, or concupisceuse of the eies, or pride of life; By the first he comprehendeth al sensual pleasures vsed in cherishing and pampering the flesh; by the second al beautie and brauerie of riches; by the third, he signified the vanitie of ambitiō in worldly honour and estimation.
                  Thes then are the three general and Three principal vanities. most principal vanities of this life, wherin wordlie men doe wearie owt their braines; to wit, ambition, couetousnes, and carnal pleasures; wherunto al other lesser vanities are addressed, as to their superiours. And thersore it shal not be amisse to consider of thes three in this place together with their dependents; for that eueric one of thes three haue diuers branches depending of them; especially the first, which here I wil handle, called by S. Iohn, Ambition and pride of life, wherunto belong thes six members that ensue.
                  
                     FIRST vainglorie, which is a certaine disordinate desire to be wel thought of, 1. VAINglorie. wel spoken of, praised and glorified of men: and this is as great a vanitie, (though it be common to many) as if a man should runne vp and doune the streetes, after a

fether flying in the ayer, tossed hither and thither with the blastes of infinit mennes mouthés. For, as this man might wearie out him self before he gate the thing which he folowed, and yet when he had it, he had gotten but a fether: so a vainglorious man may labour a good while, before he attaine to the praise which he desireth: and when he hath it, it is not worthie three chippes; being but the breath of a few mennes mouthes, that doth alter vpon euery light occ sion, and now maketh him great, now litle, now nothing at al. Christ him self may be an example of this; who was tossed to and from in the speech of men: some said he was a Samaritan and had a deuil; other said he was a prophet; other said he could Mat. 27. Ioh. 8. not be a prophet, or of God, for that he kept not the Sabboth day: others asked, if he were not of God, how he could doe so many miracles? So that there was a scisme or diuision among them about this matter, Ioh. 9. as S. Iohn affirmeth. Finally, vpon Palme sunday, they receaued him into Ierusalem, with triumph of Hosanna, casting Mat. 21. Mar. 11. Mat. 27. their apparel vnder his feet. But the thurseday and friday next ensuing, they cried, Crucifige against him; and preferred the life of Barrabas, a wicked murderer before Luc. 23. his.
                  Now my freend, if they delt thus with The miseroy of depēding on other mens mouthes. the Saueour of the world which was a better man, then euer thou wilt be; and did more glorious miracles, thē euer thou

wilt doe, to purchase name and honour with the people: why doest thou so labour and beate thy self about this vanitie of vainglorie? why doest thou cast thy trauailes into the wind of mens mouthes? why doest thou put thy riches in the lippes of mutable men, where euery flatterer may robbe the of them? hast thou no better a chest to locke them vp in? S. Paul was of an other mind, when he said: I esteeme 
                     1. Cor. 4. 
                     litle to be iudged of you, er of the day of man. And he had reason surely. For what careth he that runneth at the tilt, if the ignorant people that stand by doe geue sentence against him, so the Iudges geue it with him? If the blind man, in the way to Iericho, had depended of the liking and approbation Luc. 18. of the goers bie, he had neuer receaued the benefit of his sight: for that, they disuaded him from running and crying so vehemently after Christ. It is a miserable thing for a man to be a windemil, which grindeth not nor maketh meale, but according as the blast endureth. If the gale be strong, he sourgeth about lustely; but if the winde slake, he relenteth presently. So, doe you praise the vainglorious man, and ye make him runne; if he feele not the gale blow, he is out of hart. He is like the Babilonians, who with a litle sweete musike, were made to adore any Dan. 3. thing what soeuer.
                  The scripture saith most truely, as siluer is tried in the fire by blovving to it: so is a man 
                     Pro. 27. 
                     tried in the mouth of him that praiseth. For as

siluer, if it be good, taketh no hurt therby, but if it be euil, it goeth al into sume: so A fit similitude. doth a vaine man, by praise and commendation. How many haue we seene puffed vp with mennes praises, and almost put besides them selues for ioy thereof and yet afterward brought downe, with a contrarie winde, and driuen ful neare to desperation by cōtempt? How many doe we see dailie (as the prophet did in his daies) Psal. 9. commended in their sinnes, and blessed in their wickednes? How many palpable & intolerable flateries doe we heare both vsed, and accepted dailie, and no mā crieth with good king Dauid, avvay vvith this oile, and ointment of sinners, let it not come vpon 
                     Psa. 140. 
                     my head? Is not al this vanitie? Is it not Psal. 39. madnes, as the scripture calleth it? The glorious Angels in heauen seeke no honour vnto themselues, but al vnto God: and thou poore worme of the earth desirest to be glorified? The foure and twentie elders in the Apocalips tooke of their crounes, and cast them at the seet of the Apoc. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . lamb: and thou wouldest plucke fortie frō the lamb to thy self, is thou couldest. O fond creature: how truely saieth the prophet, Psa. 143. 
                     homo vanitati similis factus est: a man is made like vnto vanitie: that is, like vnto his owne vanitie: as light as the verie vanities them selues, which he foloweth. And yet the wise man more expressely, In vanitate sua appenditur peccator, the sinner is Eccl. 23. weighed in his vanitie: that is, by the vanitie which he foloweth, is seene how

light and vaine a sinful man is.
                  
                     THE SECOND vanitie that belongeth 2. VVORLDly honour and promotion. to Ambition, is desire of worldly honour, dignitie and promotion. And this is a great matter in the sight of a worldly man: this is a Iewel of rare price, & worthie to be bought, with any labour, trauaile, or peril what-soeuer. The loue of Ioh. 11. 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      letted the great mē, that were Christians Ioh. 19. in Iewrie, from confessing Christ openly. The loue of this, letted Pilat from deliuering IESVS, according as in consciē
                     ce he saw he was bound. The loue of this, letted Agrippa and Festus, from making Act. 26. themselues Christians, albeit they esteemed Paules doctrine to be true. The loue of this, letteth infinite men daily from embrasing the meanes of their saluation. But (alas) thes men doe not see the vanitie hereof. S. Paul saith not without iust 1. Co. 14. cause, Nolite esse pueri sensibus, be you not Childrē in vnderstanding. It is the fashiō of Children, to esteeme more of a painted bable, then of a riche Iewel. And such is the painted dignitie of this world; gotten with much labour, maintained with great expenses, and lost with intolerable greef and sorow. For better conceauing wherof, ponder a litle with thy self (gentle reader) any state of dignitie that thou woldest desire; and think how many haue had that before the. Remēber how many mounted vp, and how they descended downe againe: & imagine with thy self, which was greater, ether the ioy in getting,

or the sorow in leesing it. Where are now al thos emperours, thos kings, thos princes & prelats, which reioised so much once, at their owne aduancement? where are they now, I say? who talketh, or thinketh of them? are they not forgotten, and cast into their graues long agoe? And doe not men boldely walke ouer their heads now, whos faces might not be looked on, without feare, in their life? what then haue their dignities done them good?
                  It is a wonderful thing to consider the vanitie of this worldly honour. It is like The vanity of vvorldly honour. a mans owne shadow, which the more a man runneth after, the more it flieth: and when he flieth from it, it foloweth him againe: and the onely way to catche it, is to fal downe to the ground vpō it. So we see, that thos men which desired honour in this world, are now forgotten; & thos which most fled from it, and cast them selues lowest of al mē by humilitie; are now most of al honoured: honoured (I say) most, euen by the world itself whos enemies they were, while they liued. For who is honoured more now, who is more commended and remembred, then S. Paul Philip. 3. and his like, which so much despised worldly honour in this life, as he made lesse accompt therof then of cōmon dūge. Most vaine then is the pursute of this worldly honour, which nether contenteth the minde, nor easeth the pained body, nor continueth with the possessour, nor leaueth behind it any benefit or cōtentation.
                  
                     
                     THE THIRD vanitie that belōgeth 3. THE vanitie of vvorldly nobilitie. to ambition or pride of life, is nobilitie of flesh & blood; a great pearle in the eye of the world, but in deed in it self, and in the sight of God, a meere trifle and vanitie. Which holy Iob wel vnderstood, whēn he wrote thes wordes; I said vnto 
                     Iob. 17. 
                     rottennesse, thou art my father; and vnto vvormes, you are my mother and sisters. He that wil behold the gentrie of his auncestours, let him looke into their graues, and see whether Iob saith truely or no. True nobilitie was neuer begonne but by vertue; and therfore, as it is a testimony of vertues in the predecessours, so ought it to be a spurre to the same in the successours. And he which holdeth the name therof by descēt only without vertue, is a meere monster, in respect of his auncestours; for that he breaketh the limites and nature of nobilitie. Of which sort of men, God saieth by one prophet: They are made abominable, euen 
                     Cic. 9. 
                     as the things vvhich they loue; their glorie is frō their natiuitie, from the bellie, and from their cō
                        ception.
                  
                  It is a miserable vanitie, to begge credit of dead men, wher as we deserue none our selues; to seek vp old titles of honour from our auncestours, we being vtterlie vncapable therof, by our own base maners and behauiour. Christ clearlie confounded this vanitie, when being descended him self of the greatest nobilitie and rase of kings that euer was in this world;

and besides that, being also the sonne of God; yet called he him self ordinarilie, the 
                     Math. 8. 20. 24. 26. 
                     sonne of man; That is to say, the sonne of the pore virgin MARIE (for otherwise he was no sonne of man;) and further then this also, called hi self a shepheard, which Ioh. 10. in the world is a name of contempt. He sought not vp this & that old title of honour, to furnish his stile withal, as our mē doe: Nether, when he was to make a king first in Israel, did he seeke owt the auncientest blood, but tooke Saul, of the 1. Re. 9. basest tribe of Iewes: and after him, Dauid the poorest sheepheard of al his brethren. 1. Re. 16. And when he came into the world, Mat. 4. Psal. 44. 1. Cor. 1. he soght not out the noblest men to make princes of the earth: that is, to make Apostles: but tooke of the poorest, & simplest, therby to cōfound (as one of them saieth) the folish vanitie of this world, in making so great account of the preeminence of a litle flesh and blood in this life.
                  
                     THE FOVRTH vanitie that belongeth to ambition or pride of life, is 4. THE vani tie of vvorldly vvisdome. 1. Cor. 3. worldlie wisdome; wherof the Apostle saieth: The vvisdom of this vvorld is folie vvith God. If it be folie, then great vanitie (no dowbt) to delite and bost so much in it, as men doe. It is a strange thing to see, how contrarie the Iudgmentes of God are to the iudgmentes of men. The people of Israel wold needes haue a king (as before I haue said) and they thought, God would haue geuen them presentlie some great mightie prince to rule ouer them, but he

chose out a poore man, that folowed 1. Re. 9. asses vp & down the countrie. After that, when God wold displace this man againe for his sinnes; he sent Samuel to anoint one of Isay his sonnes; and being come to 2. Re. 16. the house, I say brought forth his eldest sonne, Eliab, a lustie taule felow, thinking him in deed most fitte to gouerne; but God answered, Respect not his countenance, nor his taulnes of personage, for I haue reiected him: nor doe I iudge according to the countenance of man. After that, I say brought in his second sonne, Abinadab, and after him, Samma, and so the rest, vntil he had shewed him seuen of his sonnes; Al which being refused by Samuel; they maruailed much and said, there was no more left but onelie a litle read headed boye, that kept the sheep, called Dauid; which Samuel caused to be sent for. And as sone as he came in sight, God said to Samuel, this is the man that I haue chosen.
                  When the Messias was promised vnto the Iewes to be a king, they imagined presentlie according to their worldlie wisdome, that he should be some great prince: and therfore they refused Christ, that came in pouertie. Iames and Iohn being yet but carnal, seing the Samaritanes contemptuouslie Ioan. 12. to refuse Christes disciples sent to them, and knowing what Christ was; thought streight way, that he must in reuēge, haue called downe fire from heauen to consume them: But Christ rebuked them, saying; you knovv not of vvhat spirit you 
                     Luc. 9.
                     
                     are. The Apostles preaching the crosse & necessitie of suffering, to the wise Gētiles and Philosophers, were thought presentlie 1. Cor. 1. fooles for their labours. Festus, the Emperours lieutenant, hearing Paul to speake so much of abandoning the world, Act. 26. and folowing Christ, said he was madde. Finallie, this is the fashion of al worldlie wise men: to condemne the wisdome of Christ, and of his Saints. For so the holie scripture reporteth, of their own confession, being now in place of torment; nos insensati vitam illorum aestimabanins insaniam; 
                     Sap. 5. we fond men, esteemed the liues of Saintes as madnes. Wherfore, this is also great vanitie (as I haue said) to make such accoumpt of worldlie wisdome; which is not onelie called folie, but also madnes, by holie scripture itself.
                  Who would not thinke, but that the wise men of this world, were the fittest to be chosen to doe Christ seruice in his Church? Yet S. Paul saieth, non multi sapientes, 
                     1. Cor. 1. 
                     secundum carnem, God hath not chosen many wise men according to the flesh. Who wold not think, but that a worldly wise man might easilie also make a wise Christian? yet S. Paul saith no; except first he become a foole, stultus fiat, vt sit sapiens: 
                     1. Cor. 3. If any man seeme wise amongest you, let him become a foole, to the end he may be made wise. Vaine then & of no account, is the wisdome of this world, except it be subiect to the wisdome of God.
                  
                     THE FIFTH vanitie belonginge

to pride of life, is corporal beautie; wherof 5. THE vanitie of beautie. Pro. 31. Psa. 118. the wise man saith, vaine is beautie, and deceauable is the grace of a faire countenance. Wherof also, king Dauid vnderstode properlie, when he said, Turne avvaye my eies (ō Lord,) that they beholde not vanitie. This is a singular great vanitie, dangerous and deceatful; but yet greatlie esteemed of the Psal. 4. children of men, whose propertie is, to loue vanitie, as the prophet affirmeth and experiēce teacheth. Beautie is cōpared by holiemen, to a painted snake, which is faire without, and ful of deadlie poison within. If a man did cōsider what infinite ruines and destructiōs haue come by ouer light geuing credit therunto, he wolde beware of it. And if he remembred what foule drosse lieth vnder a faire skinne; he wolde litle be in loue therwith, saith one holy father. God hath imparted certaine sparcles of beautie vnto his creatures, therby to drawe vs to the consideration and loue of his owne beautie, wherof the other is but a shadow; euen as a man finding a litle issue of water, maye seeke out the fountane therby; or happening vpon a smal vaine of gold, may therby come to the whole mine it self. But we like babes, delite our selues onelie with the faire A lesson to be read in the beautie of al creatures. couer of the book, and neuer doe consider what is writen therin. In al faire creatures that man doth beholde, he ought to reade this lesson, saith one father; that if God could make a peece of earth so faire and louelie, with imparting vnto it some

litle sparke of his beautie: how infinite faire is he himself, and how worthie of al loue and admiration? And how happie shal we be, when we shal come to enioye his beautiful presence, wherof now al creatures doe take their beautie?
                  If we wolde exercise our selues in these maner of cogitations, we might easilie keepe our hartes pure and vnspotted before God, in beholding the beautie of his creatures. But for that we vse not this passage from the creature to the creator, but doe rest onely in the external appearance of a deceatful face, letting goe the bridle to our foule cogitations, and setting wilfully on fire our own concupiscences: hence it is, that infinite men doe perish day lie by occasion of this fond vanitie. I cal it fond, for that euerie childe may discrie the deceate and vanitie therof. For take the fairest face in the world, wherwith infinite folish men fal in loue vpon the sight therof, and rase it ouer but with a litle scrach, and al the matter of Hovv quickly beautie is destroied. loue is gone; let there come but an Ague for foure daies and al this goodly beautie is distroyed; let the soule depart but one halfe hower from the bodie, and this louing face is vglie to looke on; let it lie but two daies in the graue, and those who were so hote in loue with it before, wil skarse abyde to beholde it, or come neare it. And if none of those things happen vnto it: yet quicklie cometh on olde age, which riueleth the skinne, draweth in

the eies, setteth-owt the teeth, and so disfigureth the whole visage, as it becometh more contemptible and horrible now, then euer it was beautiful and alluring before. And what then can be more vanitie then this? What more madnesse, then ether to take a pride therof, if we haue it our selues, or to indanger our soules for the same, if we behould it in others?
                  
                     THE SIXT vanitie belonging 6. THE vanitie of apparel. Eccl. 11. to pride of life, is the glorie of fine apparel; against which the scripture saith, In vestitu ne gloriaris vnquam; See thou neuer take glorie in apparel. Of al vanities this is the greatest, which yet we see so common among men of this world. If Adam had neuer sallen we had neuer vsed apparel. For that, apparel was deuised to couer our shame of nakednes, and other infirmites contracted by that fal. Wherfore, we that take pride and glorie in apparel, doe as much as if beggar should glorie & take pride of the olde cloutes that do couer his sores. S. Paul said vnto a bishop, If vve haue vvhervvithal to couer our selues, let 
                     1. Ti. 6. 
                     vs be content. And Christ touched deeplie the daunger of nice apparel, when he cō
                     mended so much S. Iohn Baptist for his austere attire, adding for the contradictorie, Qui moliibus vestiuntur in domibus regum sunt; They which are clothed in soft and Ma. 3. 11. Luc. 7. delicate apparel, are in kinges courtes; that is, in kinges courtes of this world, but not in the kinges court of heauen. For which cause in the descriptiō of the riche

man damned, this is not omitted by our Sauiour: That he vvas apparelled in purple and 
                     Luc. 16. 
                     silke.
                  
                  It is a wounderful thing to consider the different proceeding of God and the Gen. 3. world herin. God him self was the first tailer that euermade apparel i this world, and he made it for the most noble of al our auncestous, in paradise: & yet he made it but of beasts skinnes. And S. Paul testifieth Heb. 12. of the noblest saintes of the olde testament, that they were couered onelie with goates skinnes, and with the heares of Cameles. What vanitie is it then for vs, to be so curious in apparel, and to take such pride therin, as we doe? we robbe & spoile al creatures in the world, to couer our backes, and adorne our bodies. From one, we take his wolle; from an other his The extreme vanitie and pouertie of man. skinne; from an other his furre: and from some other their verie excrementes; as the silk, which is nothing els, but the excrementes of wormes. Nor yet content with this, we come to fishes, and doe begge of them certaine pearles to hang about vs. We goe doune into the grounde for gold and siluer; and turne vp the sandes of the sea, for pretious stones; and hauing borowed al this of other creatnres, we iette vp & doune, prouoking men to looke vpō vs, as if al this now were our own. When the stone shineth vpon our fingar, we wil seeme (forsooth) therby to shine. When the siluer and silkes doe glister on our backes; we looke bigge, as if al that

beautic came from vs. And so (as the prophet saith,) we passe ouer our daies in Psal. 77. vanitie, and doe not perceaue our owne extreme folie.
                  
                     AND THVS much now may suffice, THE 2. head of vvorldiy vanities. Concupiscence of the eyes.
                      for declaration of the first general head of worldlie vanities, termed by S. Iohu, Pride of life. Ther followeth the seconde which he calleth, Concupiscence of the eyes; wherunto the auncient fathers haue referred al vanities of riches, and wealth of this world. Of this S. Paul writeth to Timothie; Geue commandement to rich men of 
                     1. Ti. 6. 
                     this vvorld, not to be high minded, nor to put confidence in the vncertaintie of their riches. The reason of which speech is vttered by the scripture, in an other place when it saieth; Riches shal not profit a man in the daie of reuēge; 
                     Prou. 11. That is; at the daie of death and iudgement. Which thing the rich men of this world doe confesse them selues, though to late, now being in tormentes; diuitiarum iactantia quid nobis contulit? what hath the Sap. 5. brauerie of our riches profited vs? Al which doth euidentlie declare the great vanitie of worldlie riches, which can doe the possessour no good at al, whē he hath most need of their help. Riche men haue slept, their sleepe (saith the prophet) and haue found 
                     Psal. 75. 
                     nothing in their handes; that is, riche mē haue passed ouer this life, as mē doe passe ouer a slepe, imagining them selues to haue goldē mountaines and treasures wher with to help them selues in al needes that shal occurre, & when they a wake (at the daie

of their death) they finde themselues to haue nothing in their hādes that can doe thē good. In respect wherof, the prophet Baruch asketh this question; VVhere are they novv, vvhich heaped together gold & siluer, 
                     Cap. 3. 
                     & vvhich made no end of their scraping together? And he answereth him self immediatlie: Exterminati sunt, & ad inferos descenderunt; They are now rooted owt, and are gone down vnto hel. To like effect saith S. Iames. Novvye riche mco doe ye vveepe and vvaile and houle in your miseries that come vpon you; 
                     Iac. 5. 
                     your riches are rotten and your gold and siluer is rustie; and the rust therof shal be in testimonie against you: it shal seede vpon your one flash as if it vvere fire, you haue hoarded vp vvrath to your ovvn selues in the last daie.
                  
                  If wealth of this world be not onelie so vaine, but also so perilous as here is affirmed: VVealth not only raine but also perilous. Phil. 3. what vanitie then is it formen to set their mindes so vpon it, as they doe? S. Paul saieth of him self, that he esteemed al but as dung of the earth. And he had great reasō surely to say so, seing in deed riches are no better then the verie excrements of the earth, and fownde onelie in the Iob. 28. most barraine places therof, as they can tel which haue seene their mines. What a base matter is this then for a man to tie his loue vnto? God commāded in the ólde Leui. 11. law, that what soeuer did goe with his breast vpon the ground, should be vnto vs in abhomination. How much more then, a reasonable man, that hath glewed his hart and soule vnto a peece of earth? VVe
                     
                     came naked into this vvorld, and naked vvee 
                     Cap. 1. 
                     must goe soorth againe, saieth Iob. The mille whele stirreth much about, and beateth it self from daie to daie, and yet at the yeres end, it is in the same place that it was ī the beginning: so riche men, let them toile & labour what they can, yet at their death must they be as poore, as at the first daie wherin they were borne. When the riche man dieth (saith Iob) he shal take nothing Iob. 27. with him; but shal close vp his eies, and finde nothing. Pouertie shal laie handes vpon him, and a tempest shal oppresse him in the night; a burning winde shal take him awaie, and an hurle winde shal rushe vpon him, and shal not spare him; it shal binde his handes vpon him, and shal hisse ouer him, for that it seeth his place wether he must goe.
                  
                  The prophet Dauid in like wise forewarneth vs of the same, in these wordes: Be not afraid vvhen then seest a man made riche, and the glorie of his house multiplied. For vvhen he dieth, he shal take nothing vvith him, nor shal his glorie desiend to the place vvhether he goeth; he shal passe into the progenies of his aunceslours, (that is, he shal goe to the place where they are, who haue liued as he hath done) & vvorld vvithout end he shal see no more light.
                  
                  Al this and much more is spoken by the Holie ghost, to signifie the dangerous vanitie of worldlie wealth, and the folie of those men, who labour so much to procure the same, with the eternal peril of their soules. If so many phisitions, as I haue here

alleaged scriptures, should agree together, A comparison. that such or such meates were poisonned and perillous: I thinke fewe men wold geue the aduenture to eate therof, though otherwise in taste they appeared sweet and pleasant. How thē cometh it to passe, that so manie earnest admonitions of God himself, can not staie vs from the loue of this dangerous vanitie? Nolite cor apponere, 
                     Psal. 61. saith God by the prophet; that is, set not your hartes vpon the loue of riches. 
                        Qui 
                        Eccl. 31. 
                        diligit aurum non iustificabitur, saith the wise man: he that loueth gold shal neuer be iustified. 
                     I am angrie greatlie vpon riche natiōs. 
                     Cap. 1. Mat. 19. saith God by Zacharie. Christ saith; Amen dico vobis, quia diues difficilè intrabit in regnum calorū: 
                     Truelie I saye vnto you, that a riche man shal hardlie get into the kingdome of heauen. And againe, vvoe be to you riche 
                     Luc. 6. 
                     men, for that you haue receaued your consolation in this life. Finallie, S. Paul saith generallie 1. Ti. 6. of al, and to al: They vvhich vvilbe riche, doe fal into temptations, and into the snares of Satan, and into many vnprofitable and hurtful desires, vvhich doe drovvne them in euerlasting destruction and perdition.
                  
                  Can any thing in the world be spoken more effectualie, to dissuade from the loue of riches than this? must not here now al couetous men of the world ether denie God, or condemne them selues in their The pretē
                        ce of vvife and childrē refuted. own consciences? Let them goe now and excuse them selues, by the pretēce of wife & children & kinsfolke as they are wōt: saying; they meane nothing els, but to prouide

for their sufficiencie. Doth Christ, or S. Paul admit this excuse, wher Gods seruice and their own saluation commeth in question? ought we so much to loue wife, or children, or other kinred as to endanger our soules for the same? Tel me (deare Christian brother) what comfort may it be to an afflicted father in hel, to remember that by his meanes, his wife and children doe liue wealthelie in earth, & that for his eternal woe, they inioy some few years pleasurs? No, no, deare brother, this is vanitie, & a mere deceate of our spiritual enemie. For within one moment after we are dead, we shal care no more for wife, children, father, mother, or brother in this matter, thē we shal for a mere straunger; and one penie geuen in almes while we liued, for Gods sake, shal comfort vs more at that daie, thē thousandes of poundes bestowed vpon our kinred, for the natural loue we beare vnto our own flesh & blood. The which one poīt would Christ al worldly men could consider, and then (no doute) they would neuer take such care for kinred, as they doe: especially vpon their death beddes, whence presentlie they are to depart to that place, where flesh and blood holdeth no more priuilege, nor riches haue any power to deliuer; but onely such, as were wel bestowed in the seruice of God, or geuen to the poore for his names sake. And this shalbe sufficient for this point of riches.
                  
                     THE THIRD branche of worldlie

vanities is called by S. Iohn concupiscence 
                     THE 3. head of vvorldly vanities. 
                     of the flesh; which conteineth al pleasures and carnal recreations of this life, as are banquetting, laughing, playing, and such other delites, wherwith our flesh is much comforted in this world. And albeit in this kind, there is a certaine measure to be allowed vnto the godly, for the conuenient maintenance of their health, (as also in riches it is not to be reprehēded;) yet, that al thes worldly solaces, are not onely vaine, but also daungerous, in that excesse and abundance, as worldly wealthie men seeke and vse them, appeareth plainlie by thes wordes of Christ. VVoe be 
                     Ioh. 16. 
                     vnto you vvho novv doe laugh, for you shal vvepe. VVo be vnto you that novv liue in fil & satietie, for the time shal come, vvhen you shal suffer bungar. And againe, in S. Iohns gospel Ioh. 16. speaking to his Apostles, and by them to al other, he saith; you shal' vvepe & morne, but the vvorld shal reioise; making it a signe distinctiue betwene the good and the badde, that the one shal mourne in this life, and th' other reioise and make them selues merie.
                  The very same doth Iob confirme both Iob. 21. of the one & th' other sort: for of worldlinges he saith; that they solace them selues with al kind of musicke, and doe passe ouer their dayes in pleasure, and in a verie moment doe goe doune into hel. But of the godly he saith in his owne persone; Iob. 3. that they sigh before they eate their bread. And in an other place,
that they Iob. 9.
                        feare al their workes, knowing that God spareth not him which offendeth. The reason whereof the wise man yet further Eccl. 9. expresseth, saying: That the vvorkes of good men are in the handes of God, and no ma knovveth vvhether he be vvorthie of loue or hatred, at Gods handes: but al is kept vncertaine for the time to come. And old Tobias insinuateth yet an Tob. 5. other cause, when he saith: VVhat ioy can I haue or receaue, seing I sit here in darknes, speaking litterallie of his corporal blindnes, but yet leauing it also to be vnderstood of spiritual and internal darknes.
                  Thes are then the causes (beside external affliction which God often sendeth) 
                        VVhy good me are sad in this life. 1. Co. 2. 2. Co. 7. Philip. 2. Iob. 3. Ioh. 16. why the godly doe liue more graue sadde and feareful in this life, then wicked men doe, according to the counsaile of S. Paul; and why also they sigh often and weepe, as Iob and Christ doe affirme; to wit, for that they remember oftentimes the seuere Iustice of almightie God; their owne frailtie in sinning; the secret iudgement of his predestination vncertaine to vs; the vale of misery and desolation, wherein they liue here; which made euen the very Apostles them selues to grone, as S. Paul affirmeth; albeit they had much lesse cause Rom. 8. then we haue. In respect wherof we are willed to passe ouer this life in carefulnes, Ephe. 4. Mac. 24. 2. Cor. 5. & 7. Eccl. 7. watchfulnes, feare, and trembling. In regard wherof also, the wiseman saith; It is better to goe to the house of sorovv, then to the house of feasting. And againe. VVhere sadnes is, there is the hart of vvisomē; but vvhere
                     
                     mirth is, there is the hart of fooles. Finally, inconsideration of thes things the scripture saiths Beatus homo qui semper est pauidus, Happie Tro. 28. is the man which alwaies is feareful. Which is nothing els, but that which the holy Ghost commaundeth euery man, by Micheas the Prophet, solicitum ambulare cū Deo; To walke carefully and diligently Mich. 6. with God, thinking vpō his commaundementes; how we keepe and obserue the same; how we resist & mortifie our members vpon earth; how we bestowe our time, talents, and riches lent vnto vs; how we labour in good workes for the gaining of heauen; what accompt we could yeeld if presently we were to die. &c. which cogitations, if they might haue place with vs; would cut of a great many of thos worldly pastimes, wherwith the careles sort of sinners are ouerwhelmed: I meane, of thos good feloushippes, in eating, drinking, laughing, singing, disputing, and other such vanities that distract vs most.
                  Hereof Christ gaue vs a most notable aduertisemēt, in that he wept often times; as for example, at his natiuitie, at the resuscitation of Lazarus, vpon Ierusalem, & Ioh. 10. Luc. 19. vpon the Crosse. But he is neuer redde to haue laught in al his life. Her of also is cch mans own natiuitie and death a signification and figure; which two extremities, (I meane our beginning & ending) being reserued by God in his own handes to dispose; are appointed vnto vs in sorow

greef and weeping as we see and feele. But the midle parte therof, (which is our life) being left by God in our own hādes, we passe it ouer with vaine delites, neuer thinking whence we came, nor whether we goe.
                  A wise trauailer passing by his Inne, albeit he see pleasāt meates set before him A similitude. to banquet at his pleasure; yet he for beareth and restraineth his appetite vpon cō
                     sideration of the price, and of the iourney he hath to make; and taketh nothing, but so much, as he knoweth wel how to discharge the next mornig at his departure. But a foole layeth handes on euerie delicate bayt that is presented to his sight: and playeth the prince for a night or two. But the next morning when it cometh to the reckning, he wisheth that he had liued onelie with bread & drinke, rather then to be so troubled as he is, for the paiment. The custome of Gods Church is, to fast the euen of euerie feast, and then to make merie the next daye following, which is the festiual it self. And this representeth the abstinent life of goodmen in this world, therby to be merie in the world to come. But the fashion of the world is contrarie, that is, to eate and drincke merilie first at the tauerne, and after to let the host bring in his reckning. They eate, drinke, and laugh: and the host, he skoreth vp al in the meane space; And when the time cometh that they must paye; many a hart is sadde, that was pleasant

before.
                  This very self thing holy scripture affirmeth also, of the pleasures of this world: Risus dolore miscebitur & extrema 
                     Pro. 14. 
                     gaudij luctus occupat; Laughter shal be mingled with sorow, & mourning shal ensue at the hinder end of mirthe. The deuil, that plaieth the hoste in this world, and wil serue you at an inche with what delite or pleasure you desire, writeth vp al in his booke; and at the daie of your departure, (which is, at your death) he wil bring in the whole reckoning, & charge you with it al; and then shal folow that, which God promiseth to worldlinges by the prophet Amos, Your mirth shalbe turned 
                     Amos. 2. Tob. 2. 
                     into morning and lamentation. Yea, and more then this, if you be not able to discharge the rekoning, you may chaunce to heare that other dreadful sentence of Christ in the Apocalips, quantum in delitiis fuit, tantum 
                     Apo. 18. 
                     date illi tormentum; Looke how much he hath taken of his delites, so much torment doe you lay vpon him.
                  Wherfore, to conclude this point and therwithal this first parte of the parable The cōclusion of the 1. point. touching vanities: truelie may we saie with the prophet Dauid, of a worldlie minded man; Vniuersa vanitas omnis homo 
                     Psal. 38. 
                     viuens, The life of such men conteineth al kind of vanitie. That is to saie, both vanitie in ambition, vanitie in riches, vanitie in pleasures, vanitie in al things which they most esteeme. And therfore, I may wel end with the wordes of almightie

God by the prophet Esay; vaevobis, qui trahitis iniquitatem in funiculis vanitatis; Wo be vnto you, which doe draw wickednes in Esa. 59. the ropes of vanitie. These ropes are those vanities of vainglorie, promotion, dignitie, nobilitie, beautie, riches, delites, and The ropes of vanitie. other such like before touched, which alwaies draw with them some iniquitie & sinne. For which cause holie Dauid saith vnto his Lord, Thovvhatest (ô Lord) obseruers of super fluous vanities. And the scripture Psal. 3. reporting the cause why God destroied 4. Re. 17. vtterlie the familie and linage of Baasa king of Israel, saith, it was, For that they had prouoked God in their vanities. And lastlie, for this cause the holy Ghostpronounceth generallie of al men: Beatus vir qui non respexit in vanitates, & insanias falsas; Blessed is Psal. 39. that man which hath not respected vanities, and the false madnes of this world.
               
               
                  The second point of the parable.
                  
                     NOVV COME I to the second part proposed in this chapter, (which was also Hovv vvorldly vanities are also deceites. Mat. 13. the second point contained in Christes parable,) to shew how this world with the commodities therof, are not onelie vanities, but also deceites; for that in deed, they performe not vnto their folowers, thos idle vanities & trifles which they doe promise. Wherin, the world may be compared to that wretched and vngrateful deceiuer Labā, who made poore Gen. 29. Iacob to serue him seauen yeeres for faire

Rachel, and in the end deceiued him with False promises of the vvorld. foule Lia. What false promises doth the world make daily? To one it pmiseth lōg life and health, and cutteth him of in the middest of his daies. To an other it promiseth great wealth and promotion, and after long seruice, performeth no parte therof. To an other it promiseth great honour by large expences, but vnder-hand it casteth him into contempt by beggarie. To an other it assureth great aduancemēt by mariage; but yet neuer geneth him abilitie to come to his desire. Goe you ouer the whole world, behold countries, vew prouinces, looke into cities, hearken at the dores and windowes of priuate houses, of princes palaces, of secrete chābers, and you shal see and heare nothing els. but lamentable complaintes; one, for that he hath lost; an other, for that he hath not wonne; a third, for that he is not satisfied; tenne thousand, for that they are deceiued.
                  Can there be a greater decrit (for exā
                     ples fake) then to promis renoume and The salse promises of renoune. memorie, as the world doth to her folowers, and yet to forget them as soone as they are dead? Who doth remember now one, of fortie thousand ioly felowes in this world, captaines, souldiars, counsaillers. Dukes, Erles, Princes, Prelates, and Emperours, Kinges and Quenes, Lordes and ladies? whoe remēbreth them, I say? who once thinketh or speaketh of them now? hath not their memorie perished with their sound, as the prophet fortold?

Did not Iob promise truely, that their remē

                     Psal. 9. Iob. 13. Psal. 1. 
                     should be as ashes troden vnder soote? And Dauid: That they should be as dust blovvn abrod vvith the vvind? The first holy eremite named This example Bunnie thrusteth out in despit of heremites. S. Paul, did hide him self (as S. Hierome in his life reporteth) fowers kore and tenne yeeres in a wildernesse, without knowing or speaking with any man, or once shewing or reuealing him self to the world. And yet now, the world both remembreth and honoreth his memorie. But many a king and Emperour, haue striued and laboured al their life to be knowne in the world, and yet are now forgotten. So that the world is A comparison. like in this point, (as one saith) vnto a couetous and forgetful hoste; who, if he see his old ghest come by his inne in beggarlie estate, al his money being spent, he maketh semblance not to know him. And if the ghest meruaile thereat, and say, that he hath come often that way, and spent much money in the house: th' other answereth, it may be so my frind, for there passe this way so many, as we vse not to keepe accompt of al men. But what is the way to make this hoste to remebre you, saith this author? the way is (saith he) to vse him euil as you passe by: beate him wel, or doe some other notable iniurie vnto him (as Paul, and his like did vnto the world;) and he wil remember you as long as he liueth, and many times wil talke of you, when you are farre of from him.
                  Infinite are the deceites, and dissimulations

of the world. It seemeth goodly, VVhat the deceites of the vvorld are. faire & gorgeous in vtter shew; but whē it cometh to handling, it is nothing but a fether; when it cometh to sight, it is nothing but a shadow; when it commeth to weight, it is nothing but smoke; when it commeth to opening, it is nothing but an image of plaister woork, ful-of old ragges and patches within. O miserable and most deceitful world, saith S. Augustine; whos Aug. in medit. griefe is true, and delite false; whos sorowes are certaine, and pleasures vncertaine; whos paines are permanent, and repose transitory; whos toiles are intollerable, & rewardes most contemptible; whos promises are princely, and paimēts begarly; whos miseries are void of al cō
                        solation, and whos happines is mingled with al kinde of miserie.
                  
                  To know the miseries of the world, A fimilitude. you must goe a litle out from it, saieth one. For, as they which walke in a mist, doe not see it so wel, as they which stand vpon a hil from it: so fareth it in discerning the world; whos propertie is, to blinde them that come to it, to the end they may not see their owne estate; euen as a Rauen, first of al, striketh out the poore shepes eyes, to the end she may not see the way, to escape from his tyrannie.
                  So thē after the world hath once bereft The practice of the vvorld. the worldling of his spiritual sight, in such sort as he can iudge no longer betwene good and euil, vanitie and veritie: then it rocketh him also a sleepe, at his

ease and pleasure. It bindeth him sweetly, it deceiueth him pleasantly, it tormenteth him in great peace and rest: it hath redy presently a proude spirit which shal place Math. 4. him in the pinnacle of greedie ambition, and ther-hence shew him al the dignities and prefermentes of the world; it hath twentie false marchantes, which in the darke shal shew vnto him, the first & former endes of faire and precious clothes, but in no case may he looke into the whole peeces, nor carie them to the light therby to discerne them. It hath fower hundred false prophetes to flatter him, as Achab had, which must keepe him from 3. Re. 22. the hearing of Micheas counsaile; that is, from the remorse of his owne cōscience, which telleth him the trueth.

And to be breefe in this matter, doe you what you can for this world, and loue it and adore it as much as you wil; yet in the end, you shal finde it a right Nabal: who after many benefits receiued from Dauid, yet when Dauid came to haue neede of him, he answered, vvho is

                  The third point of the parable.
                  
                     HAVING DECLARED how the Hovv pleasures of the vvorld are thornes. commodities of this world that let men from resolution, are vanities and fallaces; it commeth next to be examined, in what sense our Saueour calleth them in like mā
                     ner, thornes: of which S. Gregorie writeth Mat. 13. thus; who euer would haue beleeued me (saith he) if I had called riches thornes Hom 15 in Euang. (as Christ here doth;) seing thornes doe pricke, and riches are so pleasant? And yet truly are they called thornes, for that,

with the prickes of their careful cogitations, they teare and make bloodie the mindes of worldly mē. By which words this holy father signifieth, that euen as a mans naked body, tossed & tumbled amōg many thornes, can not be but much rent and torne, and made bloodie with the prickes therof: so a worldly mans soule beaten with the cares and cogitations of this life, can not but be vexed with restles pricking of the same, and wounded also with many temptations of sinne which doe occurre. This doth Salomon (in the places before alleged) signifie, when he doth not onely cal the riches and pleasures of this world, vanitie of vanities, that is, the greatest vanitie of al other vanities; Eccle. 1. 2. 3. 4. but also affliction of spirit; geuing vs therby to vnderstand, that where thes vanities are, and the loue of them once entered; there is no more the peace of God which passeth al vnderstanding; there is no longer rest or quiet of mind; but warre of desires, Phil. 4. vexation of thoughtes, tribulation of feares, pricking of cares, vnquietnes of soule, which is in deed a most miserable & pitiful affliction of spirit.
                  And the reason here of is, that as a clocke can neuer stand stil from running, so long A comparison. as the peazes doe hāg therat: so a worldly man, hauing infinite cares, cogitatiōs, and anxieties hanging vpō his mind, as peazes vpō the clocke, can neuer haue rest or repose day or night, but is inforced to beat his braines when other men sleepe, for

the compassing of thos trifles, wherwith he is incombred. O how many riche mē in the world do feele to be true, that I now say? how many ambitious men doe proue it daily, and yet wil not deliuer thē selues out of so miserable imbroilments?
                  Of al the plagues sent vnto Egypt, that Exod. 8. of the flies was one of the most troublesome and fastidious. For, they neuer suffered men to rest, but the more they were beaten of, the more they came vpon them. So, of al the miseries and vexations, that God laieth vpon worldlinges, this is not The termēt of riche mē in their riches. the least, to be tormented with the cares of that thing, which they esteeme their greatest felicitie, and can not beat them of, by any meanes they can deuise. They rush vpon them in the morning as sone as they awake; they accompany them in the day; they forsake them not at night; they folow them to bedde; they let them from their sleepes they afflict thē in their dreames; and finally, they are thos importune and vnmerciful tyrāts, which God threatneth Iere. 16. to wicked men by Ieremie the prophet, qui nocte ac die non dabīet requiem, which shal geue no rest either by day or by night. And the cause hereof, which God alleageth in the same chapter, is, quia abstuli pacem meam a populo isto 
                           〈◊〉
                         dominus,) misericordiam, & miserationes. 
                     For that I haue takē away my peace from this kind of people; (saith God) I haue taken away my mercie, and my commiserations. A very heauie sentēce to al them, that lie vnder the yoke

and bondage of thos miserable vanities.
                  But yet the prophet Esay, hath a much more terrible description of these mens Esa. 59. estate: They put their trust in thinges of nothing (saith he) and doe talke vanities; They conceaue labour and bring foorth iniquitie; They breake the egges of serpentes, and vveaue the vvebbes of spiders. He that shal eate of their egges, shal die; & that vvhich is hatched thēce shalbe a Cocatrice. Their vvebbes shal not make cloth to couer them; for that their vvorkes are vnprofitable; & the vvorke of iniquitie is in their bandes. Thes are the wordes of the ꝓphet Esay, declaring The explicatiō of the vvordes of Esay. vnto vs by most significānt similitudes, how daungerous thornes the riches and pleasures of this world are. And first he saith, they put their hope in thinges of nothing, and doe talke vanities: to signifie, that he meaneth of the vanities and vaine men of this world, who commonlie doe talke of the things which they loue best, & wherin they place their greatest affiance. Secondlie he saith, they conceaue labour, and bring forth iniquitie; alluding herin to the childbirth of women; who first, doe conceaue in their wombes, and then after a great deale of trauaile, doe bring forth their infant: euen so worldlie men, after a great time of trauaile and labour in vanities, doe bring foorth no other fruite, then sinne and iniquitie. For that is the effect of these vanities, as he speaketh in the same chapter, crying out to such kind of men: VVoe be vnto you, vvhich doe dravv iniquitie in the ropes of vanitie.
                  
                  
                     
But yet to expresse this matter more forciblie, he vseth two other similitudes; Tvvo significant similitudes. saying, they breake the egges of serpentes, & doe vveake the vvebbes of spiders: Signifying by the one, they vanitie of thes worldly cares, and by th other, the daunger therof. The spider we see, taketh great paines and labour many daies together, to weaue vnto her self a webbe; and in the end, when al is done, cōmeth a puffe of winde or some other litle chaunce, and breaketh al in peeces: Euē as he in the gospel which had taken great trauaile and care, in heaping Luc. 12. riches together, in plucking down his olde barnes, and building vp of new; and when he was come to saie to his soule, Novv be merie; that night his soule was takē from him, and al his labour lost. Therfore Esaie saith in this place, that the vvebbes of these vvcauers shal not make them clothe to couer them selues vvith al, for that their vvorkes are vnprofitable.
                  
                  Th' other comparison containeth matter of great daunger and feare. For, as the bird that fitteth vpon the egges of serpē
                     tes, by breaking and hatching them, bringeth forth aperilous brood to her owne destructiō: so thos that sit (as it were) on brood vpō thes vanities of the world, doe hatch at last their own destruction. The reason wherof is, (as Esay saith,) for that the vvorke of iniquitie is in their handes: stil harping vpon this string, that a man can not loue and folow thes vanities, or intangle him self with their ropes (as his

former phrase is) but that he must in deede draw on much iniquitie therwith; that is, he must mingle much sinne and offence of God with the same. Which effect of sinne, because it killeth the soule that cōsenteth vnto it, therfore Esay compareth it vnto the brood of serpentes, that killeth the bird which bringeth them forth into the world. And finallie, Moyses vseth the like similitudes, when he saith of vaine and wicked men. Their vineyard is the vineyard of 
                     Deut. 32. 
                     Sodomites, their grape is the grape of gaule, and their clusters of grapes are most bitter; their vvine is the gaul of dragons, and the poison of cocatrices vncurable. By which dreadful and lothesome comparisons, he would geue vs to vnderstand, that the sweete pleasures of this world, are ī deede deceitful thornes; and wil proue in the end most bitter and daungerous.
               
               
                  The 4. point of the parable.
                  
                     THE FOVRTH point that we haue to Hovv the vvorld is miserie. consider, is, how this word, aerumna, that is, miserie and calamitie, may be verified of the world and of the felicitie therof: Which thing, albeit it may appeare sufficientlie, by that which hath bene said before: yet wil I (for promise sake) discusse it a litle further in this place, by some particulars. And among many miseries 1. Breuitie. which I might here recount, the first and one of the greatest, is, the breuitie and vncertaintie of al worldlie prosperitie. O

how great a miserie is this vnto a worldlie man, that would haue his pleasures cō
                     stant and perpetual? O death hovv bitter is thy remembrance (saieth the scripture) vnto a ma 
                     Eccl. 41. 
                     that hath peace in his riches? we haue seene many men aduanced, & not endured two monethes in their prosperitie; we haue heard of diuers maried in great ioye, and not to haue liued six daies in their selicitie; we haue read of straunge matters happened out in thes kindes, and we see with our eyes no few exāples dailie. What a greefe was it (thinke you) to Alexander 1. Mac. 2. the great, that hauīg subdewed, in twelue yeres, the most part of al the world, should be then enforced to die, when he was most desirous to liue, and when he was to take most ioye and comsort of his victories? What a sorow was it to the riche mā in the gospel, to heare vpon the suddaine, hac nocte: euen this night thou must die? What a misery wil this be to many wordlings Luc. 12. when it commeth, who now build palaces, purchasse lāds, heape riches, procure dignities, make mariages, ioyne kinredes, as though there were neuer any end of al thes matters? What a dolful day wil this be to them (I saie) when they must be turned of, no otherwise then princes mules are wont to be at the end of a iourney; that is, their treasure taken frō them, and their gauld backes onelie left vnto them selues? For, as we see thes mules of princes goe al the daie long, loaden with A comparison. treasure, and couered with faire clothes,

but at night shaken of into some sorie stable, much brused and gauled, with the cariage of those treasures: so riche men that passe through this world, lodened with gold and siluer, and doe gaule greatlie their soulesi cariage therof; are despoiled of their burden at the daie of death, and are turned of with their wounded cōsciē
                     ces, to the lothesome stable of hel and damuation.
                  An other miserie ioined to the prosperitie 2. Discontentement. of this world, is the greuous counterpeare of discontentemētes, that euerie worldlie pleasure hath with it. Runne ouer euerie delite and solace in this life, and see what sauce it hath adioined. Aske them that haue had most proofe therof, whether they remaine contented or no? The possession of riches, is accompanied with so many feares and cares, as hath bene shewed. The aduācemēt of honours, is subiect to al miserable scruitude that may be deuised. The pleasure of the flesh, though it be lauful and honest; yet is it accompanied (as S. Paul saith) vvith tribulation of the flesh: But, if it be with sinne; 1. Cor. 7. tēne thou and times more is it enuironed with al kind of miseries.
                  Who can recken vp the calamities of 3. Miseries of bodie. our bodie? so many diseases, so manie infirmities, so many mischances, so many dangers? who can tel the passions of our minde that doe afflict vs, now with sorowe, Of minde. now with enuie, now with furie? who can recount the aduersities, and misfortunes

that come by our goodes? who Of goodes. can number the hurtes and discontentations, that dailie ensewe vpon vs frō our neighbours? one calleth vs into law for Of neighbours. our goods; an other pursueth vs for our life; a third, by slaunder impugneth our good name. One afflicteth vs by hatred, an other by enuie, an other by flatterie, an other by deceite, an other by reuenge, an other by false witnes, an other by opē armes. There are not so many daies, nor houres in our liues, as there are miseries and contrarieties in the same. And further thē this, the euil hath this prerogatiue aboue the good, in our life; that one defect onelie, ouerwhelmeth and drowneth a great nūber of pleasures together. As if a man had al the felicities heaped together, which this world could yeld, and yet had but one toothe out of tune: al th' other pleasures would not make him merie. Herof you haue a cleare example in Amā, cheefe counsailer of king Assuerus: who, Hest. 5. for that Mardochaeus the Iew did not rise to him when he went by, nor did honour him, as other men did: he said to his wife & freēdes, that al his other felicities were nothing, in respect of this one affliction.
                  Adde now to this, the miserie of darknes and blindnes, wherin wordlie men liue, 4. The misery of blindnes. (as in parte I haue touched before;) most fitlie prefigured by the palpable darknes of Egypte, wherin no man could see his Exo. 10. neighbour, no man could see his worke, no man could see his way: such is the darknes

wherin woridlie men walke. They haue eyes, but they see not, saith Christ: Mat. 13. that is, though they haue eyes to see the matters of this world, yet they are blinde, for that they see not the thigs they should see in deed. The children of this world are wiser in their generation, then the children Luc. 16. of light. But that is onelie, in matters of this world, in matters of darknes, not in matters of light, wherof they are no children, for that the carnal man vnderstandeth not the things which are of God. Walke ouer the world, and you shal 1. Cor. 2. finde men as sharp eyed as Egles in things of earth, but the same men as blind as beetles in matters of heauen. Her of ensue thos lamentable effects that we see daily, of mans lawes so carefully respected, and Gods commaundemétes so cōtemptuously reiected: of earthly goods sought for, and heauenly goods not thought vpon: of so much trauaile taken for the body, and so litle care vsed for the soule. Finally, if you wil see in what great blindnes the world doth liue; remember, that S. Paul comming from a worldling to be a good Christian, Act. 9. had skales takē from his eyes by Ananias, which couered his sight before, when he was in his pride and ruffe of the world.
                  Besides al thes miseries, there is yet an 5. Temptations and dangers. other miserie, greater in some respect, thē the former: and that is, the infinit number of temptations, of snares, of intisementes in the world, wherby men are drawen to perdition daily. Athanasius writeth of S.

Anthonie the heremite, that God reuealed Athan. in vita Antonii. vnto him one day the state of the world; and he sawe it al hanged ful of nettes in euery corner, and deuilles fitting by to watch the same. The prophet Dauid, to signifie the verie same thing, that is, the infinit multitude of snares in this world, saieth, God shal raine snares vpon sinful 
                     Psal. 10. 
                     men; that is, God shal permit wicked mē to fal into snares, which are as plentiful in the world, as are the droppes of raine which fal doune from heauē. Euery thing almost, is a deadly snare vnto a carnal and loose harted mā. Euery fight that he seeth, euery word that he heareth, euery thought that he conceaueth, his youth, his age, his freendes, his enemies, his honour, his disgrace, his riches, his pouertie, his compagnie keeping, his prosperitie, his aduersitie, his meate that he eateth, his apparel that he weareth, al are snares to draw him to destruction that is not watchful.
                  Of this then, and of the blindnes declared before, doth folow the last and greatest 6. Facilitie of sinners. miserie of al other which can be in this life. And that is, the facilitie wherby worldly men doe runne into sinne. For truely saieth the scripture, miseros facit populos peccatum, Sinne is the thing that maketh Pro. 14. people miserable. And yet, how easily men of the world doe commit sinne, and how litle scruple they make of the matter, Iob signifieth, when talking of such a man, he saieth, bibit quasi aquam iniquitatem: 
                     Iob. 15. He suppeth vp sinne, as it were water;

that is, with as great facilitie, custome & ease, aduētureth he vpō any kind of sinne that is offered him, as a man drinketh water, when he is a thirst. He that wil not beleeue the saying of Iob, let him proue a litle by his owne experience, whether the matter be so or no. Let him walke out into the streetes, behold the doinges of men, vew their behauiour, cō
                     sider what is done in shoppes, in halles, in consistories, in iudgement seates, in palaces, and in cōmon meeting places abroad: what lying, what slandering, what deceiuing there is. He shal find, that of al things wherof men doe make any accōpt in the world, nothing is so litle accounted of, as to commit a sinne. He shal see The sinful state of the vvorld. iustice solde, veritie wrested, shame lost, and equitie despised. He shal see the innocent condemned, the guiltie deliuered, the wicked aduaunced, the vertuous oppressed. He shal see many theeues florish, many vsurers beare great sway, many murderers and extorsioners reuerenced and honoured, many fooles put in authoritie: and diuers which haue nothing in them but the forme of men, by reason of money, to be placed in great dignities for the gouernmēt of others. He shal heare at euerie mans mouth almost; vanitie, pride, detraction, enuie, deceit, dissimulation, wantō
                     nesse, dissolution, lying, swearing, periurie, and blaspheming. Finally, he shal see the most part of men, to gouerne them selues absolutely, euen as beastes doe, by the

motion of there passions, not by law of iustice, reason, celigion, or vertue.
               
               
                  The. 5. pointe of the parable.
                  
                     OF THIS DOTH ensue the fifte Hovv the vvorld strā
                        gleth. point that Christ toucheth in his parable, and which I promised here to handle; to wit, that the loue of this world choketh vp and strangleth euerie man whom it possesseth, fromal celestial and spiritual life; for that it filleth him with a plaine contrarie spirite, to the spirite of God. The Apostle saieth, Si quis spiritum Chrsti 
                     Rem. 8. 
                     non habet, hic non est cius; If any man haue not the spirit of Christ, this felow belongeth not vnto him. Now, how contrarie the spirite of Christ, and the spirite of the world is, maie appeare by the twelue 
                        Gal. 5. The effects of the spirit of Christ. fruites of Christs spirite reckned vp by S. Paul vnto the Galathians: to wit, Charitie, which is the roote and mother of al good workes; Ioye, in seruing God; peace, or trā
                     quilitie of minde, in the stormes of this world; Patience, in aduersitie; Longanimitie, in expecting our reward: Bogitic, in hurtig no man; Benignitie, in sweete behauiour; Gentlenes, in occasion geuē of anger; Faithfulnes, in performig our promises; Modestie, without arrogancie; Continencie, from alkind of wickednes; Chastitie, in conseruing a pure minde in a cleane and vnspotted bodie. Against thes men (saith S. Paul) there is no lavv. And in the verie same chapter Gal. 5. he expresseth the spirite of the world by

the contrarie effectes; saying,  the worcks The effectes of the spirit of this vvorld. of flesh are manifest, which are, fornication, vncleannes, wantonnes, lecherie, idolatrie, poysonninges, enemities, contentious, emulations, wrath, strife, dissention, sectes, enuie, murder, drōkennes, glutonie, and the like: of which I fortel you, as I haue tolde you before, that those men which doe such things shal neuer obteine the kingdome of heauen.
                  
                   Here now may euery man iudge of the spirit of the world, and of the spirit of Christ; and (applying it to him self) may coniecture, whether he holdeth of the one or of th' other. S. Paul geeueth two pretie short rules in the very same place Tvvo rules of S. Paul to knovvour spirit. Gal. 5. to trye the same. The first is, They vvhich are of Christ, haue crucifie ltheir flesh, vvith the vices, & concupisconces therof. That is, they haue so mortified their owne bodies, as they commit none of the vices and sinnes repeated before, nor yeld not willinglie vnto the concupiscences or temptations therof. The second rule is, if vve liue in spirite, then let vs vvalke in spirit: That is, our walking & behauiour is a signe whether we be aliue or dead. For if our walking be spiritual, (such as I haue declared before by the twelue fruites therof:) then doe we liue and haue life in spirite: but if our workes be carnal, (such as S. Paul now hath described:) then are we carnal and dead in spirite, nor haue we any thing to doe with Christ, or portion in the kingdome of heauē. And for that al the world

is ful of those carnal workes, and bringeth forth no fruites in deede of Christs spirit, nor permitteth them to grow or Christ and the vvorld enemies. prosper within her: thence is it, that the scripture alwaies putteth Christ and the world for opposite and open enemies.
                  Christ him self saith, that the vvorld can 
                     Ioh. 14. Ioh. 15. 17. 
                     not receaue the spirit of trueth. And againe in the same Euangelist he saieth, that nether he, nor anie of his, are of the world, though they liue in the world. And yet further, in his most vehement prayer vnto his father, Pater iuste, mundus te non cognouit: iust father, the world hath not knowen Ioh. 17. thee. For which cause S. Iohn writeth, If any man loue the vvorld, the loue of the Father 
                     Ioh. 2. 
                     is not in him. And yet further, S. Iames; that vvbs soeuer desireth only to be a sreend of this 
                     Iac. 4. 
                     vvorld, is therby made an enemie to God. What wil worldly mē saie to this? S. Paul affirmeth 1. Co. 11. plainlie, that this world is to be dā
                     ned: And Christ insinuateth the same in S. Iohns gospel: but most of al, in that wonderful Ioh. 12. fact of his, whē praying to his Father for other matters, he excepteth the world by name. Non promun lo, saith he; I Ioh. 17. doe not aske mercie and perdone for the world, but for those which thou hast geuen me out of the world. Oh what a dreadful exception is this; made by the Ioh. 1. Luc. 13. Sauiour of the world; by the lambe that taketh awaie al sinnes, by him that asked perdone, euen for his tourmentours and crucifiers, to except (I saie) now the world by name from his mercie? Oh that

worldlie men would consider but this one point onelie, they would not (I think) liue so voide of feare as they doe.
                  Can any man maruaile now, why S. Paul crieth so carefully vnto vs, nolite conformari huic saeculo, cōforme not your selues to this Rom. 12. world? & againe, that we should renounce vtterly al secular desires? Can any man Tit. 2. maruaile why S. Iohn, which was most priuie aboue al others to Christs holy meaning herein, saieth to vs in such earnest sorte, Nolite diligere mundum nequè ea quae in mundo sunt, doe not loue the world, nor 1. Ioh. 2. any thing that is in the world. If we may nether loue it, nor so much as conforme our selues vnto it, vnder so great paines as are before rehearsed (of the enimitie of God and of our eternal damnation:) what shal become of thos mē, that doe not onely cōforme them selues vnto it and to the vanities therof, but also doe folowe it, seeke after it, rest in it, and doe bestow al their labours, and trauailes vpon it.
                  If you aske me the cause why Christ VVhy Christ hateth the vvorld. 1. Io. 5. so hateth and abhorreth this world; Saint Iohn telleth you, Quia mundus totus in maligno positus est, 
                     for that al the whole world is set on noughtines: for that it hath a spirite contrarie to the spirite of Christ,  as hath bene shewed: for that it teacheth pride, vainglorie, ambition, enuie, reuēge, malice, with pleasures of the flesh, and al kinde of vanities. And Christ on the contrarie side, preacheth al humilitie, meekenes, perdoning of enemies, abstinence,

chastitie, sufferance, mortification, bearing the Crosse, with cōtempt of al earthlie pleasures for the kingdome of heauen. Christ hateth it, for that it persecuteth the good, & aduanceth the euil; for that it rooteth out vertue, and planteth al vice; And finalie, for that it shutteth the doores against Christ when he knocketh, and Apoc. 3. strangleth the hart that once it possesseth.
                  Wherfore to conclude this part, seing A description of the vvorld. this world is such a thing as it is: so vaine, so deceitful, so troublesome, so dangerous: seing it is a professed enemie to Christ, excommmunicated and damned to the pit of hel: seing it is (as one father saieth) an arcke of trauaile, a schole of vanities, a marcket of deceite, a laberinthe of errour; seing it is nothing els but a barraine wildernes, a stonie field, a dirtie stie, a tempestuous sea: seing it is a groue ful of thornes, a medowe ful of scorpions, a flourishing garden without fruite, a caue ful of poisoned and deadlie basiliskes: seing it is finallie (as I haue shewed) a fountaine of miseries, a riuer of teares, a faigned fable, a delectable frensie: seing (as Saint Au. ep. 39. Austen saieth) the ioy of this world hath nothing els but false delite, true asperitie, certaine sorowe, vncertaine pleasure, trauailsome labour, fearful rest, greeuous miserie, vaine hope of felicitie: seing it hath nothing in it (as S. Chrisostome saith) but teares, shame, repentāce, reproche, sadnes, Hom. 22. ad pop. Antiochenum. negligences, labours, terrours, sicknes, sinne, and death it self: seing the worlds

repose is ful of anguish, his securitie without foundation; his feare without cause, his trauailes without fruite, his sorowe without profit, his desires without successe, his hope without rewarde, his mirthe without continuance, his miseries without remedies: seing thes and a thousande euils more are in it, & no one good thing can be had from it, who wil be deceiued with this visard, or allured with this vanitie hereafter? who wil be staied from the noble seruice of God by the loue of so fond a trifle as is this world? And this to a reasonable man may be sufficiēt, to declare the insufficiencie of this third impediment.
               
               
                  The. 6. point of this chapter.
                  
                     BVT YET NOVV for satisfying my promisse in the beginuing of this chapter: Hovv vve may auoid the euil of the vvorld. I haue to adde a word or two in this place, how we may auoide the foresaid daungers of this world, as also vse it vnto our gaine and commoditie. And for the first, to auoide the daungers, seing there are so many snares and trappes, as hath bene declared: there is no other waie, but onelie to vse the refuge of birdes in auoiding the dangerous snares of fowlers: that is, to mounte vp into the ayer, and so to flie ouer them al. Frustra tacitur rete ante oculos pennatorum, saith the wise man: that Pro. 1. is, the net is laide in vaine before the eies of such as haue winges and can flie. The

spies of Hierico, though many snares were laide for them by their enemies; yet they escaped al, for that they walked by hilles, saieth the scripture. Which place Origen expounding, saieth, that there is no waye He. 1. in Iosue. to auoide the daungers of this world, but to walke vpon hilles, and to imitate Dauid, that saied, Leuaui oculos meos ad montes, vnde ve 
                           〈◊〉
                         auxiliū mihi, I lifted vp mine eies Psa. 120. vnto the hilles, frō whence al mine aide and assistāce came, for auoiding the snares of this world. And then shal we saie with the same Dauid, Anima nostra sieut passer erepta est de laqueo venantium: Our soule is deliuered Psa. 123. as a sparo we from the snare of the fowlers. We must saie with S. Paul, Our conuersation is in heauen; and then shal we Phil. 3. litle feare al thes deceites, and daungers vpon earth. For as the fouler hath no hope to catch the birde, except he can allure her to pitch, and to come doune, by some meanes: so hath the deuil no way to entangle vs, but to say as he did to Christ, mitte te deorsum, throw thy self doune; that Mat. 4. is, pitch doune vpon the baites which I haue laid, eate and deuour them, enamour thy self with them, tie thine appetite vnto them and the like.
                  Which grosse and open temptation he that wil auoide, by contemning the alluremēt of thes baites, by flying ouer them, by placing his loue and cogitations in the mountaines of heauenly ioyes & eternitie: he shal easily escape al daungers and perils. King, Dauid was past them al when

he saied to God: VVhat is there for me in heauen, or vvhat doe I desire besides thee vpon earth? 
                     Psal. 72. 
                     my flesh and my harte haue fainted for desire of thee. Thou art the God of my hart, and my portion (ô Lord) for euer.
                  
                  Saint Paul also was past ouer thes daungers, when he saied, that now he was crucified Gal. 6. to the world, and the world vnto him: and that he esteemed al the wealth of Phil. 3. this world as meere dung; and that albeit he liued in flesh, yet liued he not according 2. Co. 10. to the flesh. Which glorious example if wee would folow, in contemning and despising the vanities of this world, and fixing our mindes on the noble riches of Gods eternal kingdome to come: the snares of the deuil would preuaile nothing at al against vs in this life.
                  Touching the second point; how to vse the riches and commodities of this world Hovv to vse vvorldly vvealth to our aduantage. Luc. 16.
                      to our aduantage; Christ hath laied doune plainly the meanes, Facite vobis amicos de Māmonainiquitatis: Make vnto you freendes of the riches of iniquitie. The rich gloutton might haue escaped his tormentes, & haue made him self a happie man by helpe of worldly wealth, if he had listed. And so might many a thousand that now liue Luc. 16. in Christianitie, and wil goe to hel for the same cause that the glutton did. Oh that men would take warning one by an other, and be wise whiles they haue time. S. Paul saieth, Deceiue not your selues; Looke 
                     Gal. 4. 2. Cor. 9. 
                     vvhat a man sovveth, and that shal he reape. What a plentiful haruest then might riche

men prouide to thē selues if they would, hauing such store of seede by them, and so much ground offered them daily to sow it in? Why doe they not remember that sweet haruest-song, Come ye blessed of my father; enter into the kingdom prepared for you; for 
                     Mat. 25. 
                     I vvas hungrie, and you fed me; I vvas thirstie, and you gaue me to drink; I vvas naked and you appareled me? Or if they doe not care for this; why doe they not feare at least the blacke Sanctus that must be chaunted to them for the contrary? Agite anne diuites, plorate, vlulantes in miserijs vistris quae adueniēt 
                     Iac. 5. 
                     vobis: goe now you riche men; weepe and houle in your miseries that shal come vpō you?
                  The holy father Iohn Damaseen reporteth a goodly parable of Barlaam the heremite, Dam. in hist. Barlaā & Iosaphat cap. 14. A parable.
                      to our purpose. There was (saieth he) a certaine citie, or common wealth, which vsed to chuse to them selues a king from among the poorest sorte of people, and to aduaunce him to great honour, wealth, and pleasures for a time. But after a while, when they were wearie of him, there fashion was to rise against him, and to dispoile him of al his felicitie, yea of the verie clothes of his backe, and so to banish him naked into an Iland of a farre countrie; where, bringing nothing with him, he should liue in great miserie, and be put to exceeding slauerie for euer. Which practise one king at a certaine time considering, by good aduise (for al th' other, though they knew that fashion, yet

through negligence & pleasures of their present felicitie, cared not for it;) tooke resolute order with him self, how to preuent this miserie: which was by this meanes. He saued euery day great sommes of money from his superfluities and idle expences; and so, secretly made ouer before hand a great treasure vnto that iland, wherunto he was in daunger daily to be sent. And whē the time came, that in deed they deposed him from his kingdom, and turned him away naked, as they had done th' other before: he went to the ilād with ioy and confidēce, where his treasure lay; and was receiued there, with exceeding great triumph; and placed presently in greater glorie, then euer he was before.
                  This parable teacheth as much as possibly may be said in this point. For this citie Th' application of this parable. or common wealth, is this present world, which aduaunceth to authoritie, poore men: that is, such as come naked into this life; and vpon the soudaine when they looke least for it, doth pul them doune againe, and turneth them of naked into their graues, and so into an other world; where bringing no treasure of good workes with them, they are like to finde litle fauour, but rather eternal miserie. The wise king that preuented this calamitie, is he, which in time of wealth in this life (according to the counsail of our Saueour Christ) doth seeke to lay vp treasure Luc. 12. in heauen by almes deedes and other good works, against the day of his death,

when he must be banished hence naked, as al the prices of that citie were. At which time, if their good deeds do folow them, then (as God pmiseth,) they shal be happie Apo. 14. Mat. 25. men, and placed in much more glorie, then euer this world was able to geue them. But if they come without oile in their lampes; then is there nothing for them to expect, but nescio vos; I know you not. And when they are knowen; Ite 
                     Mat. 25. 
                     maledicti in ignem aeternum, goe you accursed into fire euerlasting.
               
            
            
               EXAMPLES OF TRVE RESOLVTION IN THE TVVO FORMER POINTES; of suffering for Christ, and contemning the vvorld. Adioined for the better declaration and confirmation of the tvvo chapters next going before. CHAPT. V.
               FOR so much as the two precedent chapters of contemning the world and suffering for Christ, are by their own natures, and in mans natural sight and reason, very dreadful and lothsome

to flesh and bloud, and to whatsoeuer depēdeth therof; in such sort, as diuers persons, (who otherwise esteme thē selues The reason of this chapter. no euil Christians,) doe take horrour and auersion euen at the very name and mention of such things; persuading them selues that the necessitie of Christiā profession, requireth not any resolution to so high a perfection: I am moued in this place, to adioine to the former treatises, a breefe declaration of the practise and excercise of ancient Christians in thes two points, wherby their opinions and censures may better be seire thē by their words; and wherin ech other Christiā that liueth at this day, may behold as in a table or glasse, what behoueth him to doe (when occasion is offered) if he professe to serue vnder the same banner, and doe expect his paye at the handes of the same king and maister, that they did.
               Many things haue bene said before, cō
                  cerning thes two misteries of worldlie VVhat hath bene handled before. contempt, and sufferance in tribulation. And among other matters it hath bene declared, that the very foundatiō of Christian Religion (which is the holie crosse and Crucifix) standeth builded principaly vpon thes two pillers. It hath bene showed, how Christ our Sauiour when he sent forth his Apostles and disciples, as the first spiritual fathers and masters of the world; instructed thē especially in thes two doctrines, as most behooful and necessarie to the end which he pretēdeth.

And for that his diuine wisdome did easily foresee, that deedes haue much more force to persuade then wordes: he did set forth this doctrine most exactly in the example of his own life, making the same a paterne of al worldly contempt and suffering for iustice; as also did his said Apostles and disciples after him, to the true and perfit imitation of their maister.
               Thus much then hath bene treated before; and many particulers haue bene declared The firme resolutiō of th' apostles. as wel of the holie Apostles extreme suffering in al kindes and maners of affliction, as also of their vtter dispising whatsoeuer was pretious or pleasant in this world, for the perfect seruing of their Lord and maister. No allurements of this world could intise them, no dignities delight them, no flatterie deceiue them, no pleasure peruert them, no labours weary them, no difficultie stay them, no terrour or tyrannie of mortal man could feare them from their course begonne, as long as their soules remained within their bodies. Some of them ended their liues by the sword, some vpon the crosse, others were stoned and throwne downe from highe pinacles, others were scorched & skinned aliue: and al this for the perfect seruing of their maister, and to stir vs vp to folowe their examples. Which thing the learned and deuout Father S. Iohn Chrysostome considering, when he treated of the deedes of S. Peter and S. Paul in particuler, breaketh furth into this speech

folowing.
               
                  O holie and blessed Apostles of my Sauiour, what thankes shal we yeld vnto The speach of S. Chrysostom. ser. 32. in mor. exhort. you for al the labours and toiles that you haue taken for vs? When I thinke of thee, O Peter, I fal into admiration; and when I remember thee O Paul, I fal besides my self, and am oppressed with teares. For what shal I say, or what shal I think, whē I behould the afflictions that you haue suffered? How many prisons haue you two sanctified? how many chaines haue you adorned? how many torments haue you 
                        •
                     usteined? how many reproches haue you receaued? O blessed bee those tongues of yours, that haue bene such instruments of the holie Ghost, and blessed be your members inbrued with blood, for the loue of Christes Church. You haue trulie followed your maister in al things, &c. Reioyce therfore thou Peter, to whom it was giuen to die vpon the crosse, therby to imitate thy Sauiour: and triumphe thou Paul, whose head was cut of with the sword for the same cause. O this sword shal be to me in steade of a crowne, and the nailes wherwith S. Peter was crucified, shal be most pretious stones in my Diademe. Thus much & many things more vttereth this holie father with great feruour, in admiration of the sufferings of thes blessed Apostles: whose labours how much he indeuored to put in execution in his own life, and how far he was made partaker of like afflictions, it may appeare

to him that wil reade the Vide hist. Secrat. li. 6. Ecclesiastical historie, which declareth how he both liued and died in continual tribulation.
               O deare christian brother, if we had so tender harts in contemplation of thes affaires, as had this holie man of God, we would be of other iudgment in many things then we are. We see that S. Chrysostome was thus moued, with the consideration onelie of thes two Apostles trauails. But how much might be said of al the rest in like maner? Of S. Iames that Of S. Iames. was called the brother of IESVS, and was left by him as the first bishope of Hierusalem, it is writen by Egesippus that liued Egesip. lib. 5. hist. apud Euseb. li. 2. cap. 22. immediatly after his time, that he being in singuler auctoritie & credit for his holines and wisdome, not only among al Christians, but also among the whole nation of Iewes (for which he was called by the name of Iames the Iust as Iosephus the Iew reporteth;) yet chose he a most austere and sharpe life, neuer testing either wine or flesh, or anointig his body with oile, according to the fashion of the countrie. He was so diligent and painful in continual praying vpon his knees, that the skinne therof was as hard as the brayne of a camels knee. And being broght forth one daie and placed vpon a pinnacle of the temple of Hierusalem, in the presence of in inic people, (for it was on the highe feast of Easter) and ther intreated by al the nobles and Magistrates of Iurie to speake some word in derogation

of Christian religion, with promisse of infinite honour for the same, if he would yeld the runto: he made choise not only to lacke that honour, but also to be reuiled by the people, to be throwen downe from the pinnacle wher he stood, and to haue his head cleft in sunder with a staffe or instrument that diars of cloth doe vse, rather then to relent one iote in professing that thing which he knew to be true.
               This was the smal accompte that thos men made of worldly dignities and promotions, when they broght with them any let or hinderance to Gods perfect seruice. And this was the redy desire they haue to suffer, in euery least occasion offered for their. Masters honour. O gentle reader, how worthely said our Samour Iesvs of thes mē; you are they vvho baue stood vvith me in my temptations, and therfore I prepare 
                  Luc. 22. 
                  for you a kingdome; and how iustely may it be verified of vs, that which the same our Sauiour in another place saith, in tempore tentationis accedunt, they abandone me in Luc. 8. time of tentation.
               
                  BVT LET VS see now further, how thes which insued and liued after the Apostles, behaued themselues in this behalfe. For better conceauing wherof, thou THE manifold tentations of the primatiue church. hast to remember (louing brother) that for the space of three hundred years together after Christs departure out of this world; he sent almost continual temptations, that is to say, continual tribulatiōs,

afflictions & persecutiōs vnto his Church vpon earth, (except only certaine short times or breathing,) wherin he ment to make euident proofe of his seruantes patience, and of his owne power against his enimies. And wheras a litle before his departure, he forwarned his disciples of thes things to come, assuring them that they Mat. 10. should haue pressures, and that he sent thē forth as lambes among wolues; he perfourmed the same in such sorte not long after, as it may seeme that he brake open al the gates and barres of hel at once, (as els wher I haue noted) and turned forth al the legions of suries therin conteined, as most rauenous beares and lions vpon thes his lambes. For in ten general & most deadful persecutions, which in this time, by publique authoritie & cōmādemēt were excercised; it is impossible for man to recounte, either the tyrannie and iniquitie of the lawes, or the barbarous crueltie of the executors, or the infinite multitude of the sufferers, or the strange inuentions of the tormentours. And albeit in thes times of trial (as alwaies it falleth out,) ther wanted not diuers Christians (as Eusebius Euseb. li. 8. hist. cap. 2. wel noteth that writeth the storie) who for loue of their own ease made shipwrak of their saluation: yet without number were thos also that by contempt of the world, did beare out the storme, and perseuered faithful. Of whom for our instruction & comfort in like occurrētes, some sew shalbe noted in this discourse following.
               
                  
After the death of S. Iames before mentioned, & the destruction of Hierusalem, Th' exāple of Simeon. which was especially hastened by God for punishement of that murder (as Iosephus the Iewe was of opinion,) Ege sippus Ioseph. apud Euse. lib. 1. c. 22. and Eusebius doe reporte, that so many of the Apostles and disciples of Christ as were then aliue, gathered them selues together, Apud Euse. l. 3. c. 10. & 26. and ordeined bishop of Hieruialē in place of S. Iames, one Simeon the soune of Cleophas; which Cleophas, S. Luke nameth for one of the two disciples that Luc. 24. went to Emaus together, and talked with Christ vpon the way, after his resurrection. S. Matthew also and S. Iohn doe Mat. 27. Ioh. 19. make mention of MARY the wife of Cleophas, which was continually in the company of the blessed Virgin-mother of our Saue our, at his Passiō: which MARY being mother to this Simeon; and her husband Cleophas, being brother to Ioseph (as Egesippus holdeth:) Simeō was accompted as cosine german to our Sauiour IESVS, and by al probabilite, had bothe sene him and heard him in his life.
               This man then hauing liued verie long in this his charge of bishoprike, & being now a hundred and twentie yeares olde, was in the time of Traian the Emperor (S. Iohn the Euangelist being dead a litle before.) accused by certaine heretiques: who then first (as Egisippus saith, who liued in the same time) beganne to shew Egesip. apud Euse. li. 3. cap. 26. them selues openly in the world, (hauing

liued secretly in corners before,) for that al the holy Apostles and others which had heard our Sauiour speake, were now dead, and therfore thes heretiques deuised now, what new expositions vpon The publique beginning of heretiques. scriptures liked them best. And for that this man was the only or cheefe piller that stood against them for defence of the Catholique faith and apostolical traditiō at that daie, they caused him coningly to be apprehended and presented before Atticus then gouern our of Iurie for the Emperour. Who after many allurementes and threates vsed vnto him, when by no me ās he could moue him to relent from his cō
                  stancie in Christes seruice: he caused him to be beaten with whippes and to be tormented many daies together: which the old man indured with most wonderful corage, in so much that Atticus being The death of Simeon. astonied (saith our author) that one of six skore years of age, could beare so many torments, commanded him finally to be nailed on a crosse as his master Christ was, and so he died.
               At the very same time liued therin Asia a man of singuler name for his holines, The storie of S. Ignatius. called Ignatius, disciple to the apostles, & by them or deined bishop of Antioche after that S. Peter had lest the same. This mā being accused for his faith to the gouernour of Syria, and standing constant in the confession therof, was condemned by him to be torne in peeces of wild beastes. But for that he was a person of great

marke; he was sent prisoner to Rome vnder the custodie of ten soldiars, to suffer ther. And albeit thes soldiars vpon the way vsed him very discurteously and kept him straite; yet founde he meanes either by speech or letters to comfort al Christians as he passed by them. But especially (as Eusebius noteth) he inculcated two Fusch li 3. cap 30. pointes to be remembred of them, Primum, vt haereses, quae tum primò emergere caeperunt, maxime praecaue: ēt; deinde, vt apostolorū traditioni 
                        〈◊〉
                      adhaerescerēt; 
                   first, that they should aboue al other things take heed of new opinions and heresies which then first began to creepe abroad: and secōdly, that they should sticke and cleane most firmely to the tradition of th' Apostles, for the true vnderstanding and interpretation of scriptures; that is to say, they should admit no other interpretation but that which al Ignatius his rule to discerne truth. churches by general and vniforme consent had receaued from th' apostles; insinuating hereby, that this should be an infallible rule to guide men by, vnto the worlds ende.
               Besides this the good man got time also and opportunitie in his iourney, to write diuers epistles to sandry churches, which Eusebius in his storie setteth downe. And among other things either he being informed, or fearing of him self, that the Christians in Rome hearing of his comming, would make means to the Emperour to get pardon for his life, and so depriue him of martyrdome: he write a

most earnest letter vnto them, beseeching them not to doe so. Out of which letter, both Eusebius and S. Hieron doe cite thes Easeb. li. 3. cap. 20. Hieron. in catal. most excellent words following. In this my iourny (saieth he) from Syria to Rome, I am inforced to fight day and night with ten leopards, that is, with ten soldiars sent to keepe me. Who the more benifites I doe bestow vpon them, the worse The Zelous vvords of S. Ignatius at his death. and the more cruel they are towards me. But their iniquitie is my instruction, and yet hereby I am not iustified. Would God I were once come to inioy thos beastes that are appointed to deuoure me. I desire greatly that it may be hortly, & that they may be stirred vp to eate me quickly, least perhapes they abstaine to touch me, as they haue done from the bodies of other martyrs. But if they should refuse to set vpon me, I wil intise them on my self. Pardon me (my children) for I know what is good for me. Now I begine to be Christs true disciple, desiring nothing that is sene in this world with mans eyes, but only IESVS Christ my Sauiour. Fire, crosse, beastes, breaking of my bones, quartering of my members, tearing and renting of my body, and al th' other tormentes that the diuel can inuent, let them al come vpon me, only that I may inioy my IESVS.
               
               Thus far doth Eusebius cite the words of his own epistle, which yet is exstant.

                   yet further, that when he came to suffer, and heard the roringes of the lions redy to

come forth vpon him, he vsed thes words; I am Gods corne, and the teeth of thes wild beastes must grinde me, to the ende I may be pure and good bread for Christs table. He suffered (saith S. Ierome) in th' eleuenth yeare of Traians reigne; and his reliques were carried backe againe, by Christians from Rome to Antioche, and S. Ignatius reliques. ther are kept without the gate called Daphnitica.
               Here we see the feruour of this seruant of God; we see his constancie, his corage, his comfort in suffering. And how came he (deare brother) to this most happie and blessed estate? We heare him say of him Hovv old Christians came to their constancie. self, that novv he began to be Christes true disciple, vvhen he desired nothing that mans eye can behold, but only his Lord and Sauiour IESVS Christ. This burning loue then of IESVS, did consume in him al other loue and affection that stayeth worldly men from like resolution. He was no frende or louer of this world. Heare the saying of an other light and lanterne of Gods church, which liued at the very same time, and suffered so one after him, for the same cause, and spake with him in his iourney toward Rome; I meane S. Policarpus, who wrote S. Policarp. his speach of S. Ignatius. thus of Ignatius, presently after his martyrdome, vnto the Philippenses. I beseech you brethren to yeld al obedience wher it is due, and to vse al patience in your afflictions, Euseb. li. 3. cap. 30. according to the example which you haue seene in Ignatius, and other martyrs; as also in S. Paul and the rest of the

Apostles, assuring your selues, that thos men ranne not in vaine, but in faith and iustice; and therfore are gone to the place which was due vnto them, being now with their Lord, of whos afflictions they were made partakers in this life. They were no louers of this world, but they loued their maister, who suffered death for our loue, and rose againe for our glorification. Thus far Policarpus.
               And for that we are fallen into the mention of this rare and worthie man Policarp, The storie of S. Polycarp. who albeit he sawe not Christ hī self in flesh, yet did he liue most familiarly with diuers of the Apostles, & especially with S. Iohn Euāgelist; whose domestical disciple he was many yeares, and by him made bishope of the Church of Smyrna: and for that his fight and martyrdome for Christian religion, ensued not longe after the death of Ignatius; it shal not be amisse to speake of him also in this place. The storie is set downe at large by Eusebius, Euseb. l. 4. c. 13. & 14. and others out of an Epistle writen by the Christians of the Church of Smyrna, which were al present at the whole tragedie of his death; the summe wherof is this: that wheras at a certaine day by the commandement of the Emperour Antonius, incredible and innumerable tormēts were vsed against Christiās, in the citie of Smyrna: diuers did beare the same out with inuincible courage, to the singuler comfort of their brethren, and to the great admiration of their enemies; albeit

one Quintus that was newly come out of Dangerous for any mā to offer him self to persecutours. Phrygia, and had rashlie offered him self to the tortours before he was sought for; fel shamefully the same day, & denied his profession.
               Polycarpus then while thes thinges were in doing remained secretly in a house therby, with other christians; whether euery thing was brought to him by the brethren as soone as they were done: and at length newes came, that Polycarpus himself was sought for. Wherat he nothing moued, answered with a quiet mind and countenance, that he was ready; meaning in deede to expect the officers ther vntil they came for him. But the christians that were present with him, inforced him whether he would or no, to retire him self vnto a litle village not far of, where he made his abode for certaine daies, whiles he was sought for in the citie. During which time, he did nothing els (saith the storie) but pray day and night, and that especially for the peace and vnitie of the Church, for that heresies now pubblicly Policarpus greatest care for the Churches vnitie. begon to swarme. He had a vision also, (which he tould vnto thos that were ther present with him) signifying that he must goe to Christ by fier. At length the purseuants that had sought him al about the citie, came by Gods permission, vnto the village where he was, and therupon he sted by night vnto another, whether they followed him also. And ther finding two children in the street, enforced the one

of them by beating, to discouer the house wherin he laie.
               Comming therfore into the house, and vnderstanding that he was in a chamber Policarpe apprehended. aboue, sent for him to come downe; and albeit the messenger fauouring Polycarpus, shewed him a way how to escape by an other house, yet he refused the same, saing; we haue fled inough, let Gods wil be done. And so comming downe with a mery countenance, bid them hartely welcome, and commanded the meate left in the house to be set before them, beseeching them only to giue him one houres space wherin to pray vnto his Lord, before he departed: Which they willingly granted, being much moued with his gray haires and fatherly countenance, as allo cast into admiratiō with the feruour of his praiers that he made ther by him self, whiles they were eating. Which being ended, they tooke him forthe, placing him vpon an Asse, and so led him towardes the citie of Smyrna, very early in the morning vpon the great saboth day, hauing aduertised the Magistrates before of their comming, who for that cause were gathered together with al the people in the market place.
               And to make the matter more solemne, they sent forth one Herode, that was prouost Policarpus his cariage to Smirna. of the peace, to mete him and fetch him in. He therfore comming forth with great pompe in his coche, met with Polycarpus, & first saluted him with great honour

and reuerence, causing him to come downe from the asse, and to sit with him in his coche, & there began to flatter him, saing; You are a graue and wise man, haue The maner of persecutours speeches. respect vnto your self. what great matter (man) is it to say, Lord Caesar; or to make a sacrifice. But Polycarpus held his peace; and when the other went forward to vse many wordes to that purpose, Polycarpus answered: Syr, in fine I am not to folow your counsel. At which wordes he taking great disdaine; thrust him headlong out of his coche, and that with such violēce, as he wounded pitifullie his legge in going forth. But the old man making no accompt therof, followed merily the soldiars that lead him.
               And when he came to the place wher the iudges were; he entred in with a mery Policarpus confession before the multitude. countenance, and much the more, for that at the very instant when he entred, ther was a cleare and lowd voice heard from heauen, saying; beos good corage Polycarpe, & bebaue thy self valiantly. When he came before the high magistrate, named Procōsul; first, ther was an insinite crie geuen out by the people against him. Which being appeased; the Proconsul asked him, whether he were Polycarpus; to which he answered, yea. Then said the Proconsul, haue regarde vnto thy oldage, (Father) repent & desire that wicked mē may be destroied. Wherat Polycarpe turned him self vnto the multitude, and lifting vp his handes to heauen with a deepe sigh, said; ô Lord

destroy or take awaie the wicked. Then said the Proconsul; sweare also by Caesars fortune, and defie Christ. Wherto Polycarp answered; I haue serued Christ now fourescore years and more, and he neuer yet did me any hurt but much good, and how thē can I defie my Lord & king, that hytherto hath so mercifully dealt with me? Then vrged the Procōsul againe, that he shoulde sweare by Caesars fortune. Wherto th' other replied, if thou name Caesars good fortune so often, for oftentations sake; know thou, that I am a Christian, which hath

                   them not worthie to be dealt withal in such a matter; but to the, as to a Magistrate, our profession teacheth vs to haue respect and reuerence.
               After this there passed diuers other speaches betwene them, the one threatening tormentes, beastes, fier and sword; and th' other shewing al desire and readines to susteine the same. The people cried out continually that he might be Vnruly behaueour of a multitude. torne with wild beastes. But that was denied, for that the beastes were wearied out vpon other martyrs before. Thē cried they that he might be burned aline, which Policarp hearing, and remembring the vision which he had seene in the village

before his apprehension, fel downe of his knees and praied; and soone after rising againe, turned him to the people and said; be ve content, for you shal haue your desire, for it is determined that I shal be burned aliue; and a litle after, the Proconsul gaue sentence for his burning.
               When he was brought vnto the fier, he put of his own apparel, saith the storie; The martyrdome of S. Policarp. but when he came to his showes he had some difficultie therin, for lake of vse, being neuer permitted by Christians to doe that office to him self before, euery one thinking it a felicitie to be the first in doinge of that seruice, whersoeuer he came, therby to touch his holy body. He praied vehemently in the fier, and gaue immortal thankes vuto almightie God that had made him worthy of that daies combate; during which time, the fier diuided it self in two partes, and would not touch him; in so much, that the magistrate was constreined to send one to ronne his body through with a sword, wherwith he died. Thus far repeteth Eusebius out of the epistle of thes men that were present at his martyrdome, & they doe adde further thes wordes in the same epistle; that Euseb. li. 4. ca. 14. & Niceph. li. 3. ca. 35. the Iewes and Gentils ther present, did suggest to the Magistrate, to take heede least we did steale away his body, and so begin to honour him in stead of our God crucified. Vpon which suggestion, his body by commandement was burned ther in our presence after it was dead, but yet we

afterward gathered vp his bones out of the ashes, and laid them vp as things more pretious then gold or pretious stones, in S. Policarpus his reliques. a place conuenient for such a treasure; hoping that one day God wil permit vs to come togither in peace, and to celebrate the festiual day of this his holy martyrdome.
               
               I haue bene the lōger in setting downe the cōbat and end of this glorious Sainct, for that he was a most rare and singuler man, and his example may serue vs for our instruction to diuers purposes; but especially, To be noted in S. Policarp. how we ought to be firme and cō
                  stant, in holding the general vniforme doctrine, and interpretation of scripturs, deliuered by tradition from th' apostles in the Catholique church, with detestation of al new opiniōs, as also S. Ignatius warned vs before. The holy bishop and martyr Iren. lib. 3. cap. 3. apud Euseb. lib. 4. c. 13. of God Irenaeus, that liued in his time, and went from Liōs in France, vnto Asia to see and heare him, reporteth certaine things of this blessed man, which I can not in this place omit (notwithstanding I make haste) for that they may greatly profit such men in thes our dayes, as haue grace to be moued or holpen with any thing.
               
                  Policarpe (saith he) was not only instructed by th' apostles them selues, but also made bishop, by them of Smirna. He Irenaeus his testimony of Policarpus doctrine. liued familiarly with many that had sene and spoken with our Saueour in flesh, and we in our youth saw him in Asia, for he

liued long, and ended his life by a most famous martyrdome. He taught alwaies thos things, which he had learned of the apostles, & which the Church deliuereth, and which are only true. Which may be proued, by the consent of al the churches of Asia, and by the bishopes which haue succeded after him. He was a more faithful witnes of the truth, then Valentinus, or Marcion, or al the body of other heretiques together, which haue brought pestilent new sectes into the Church. He wēt to Rome, Anacetus being thē bishop, and reduced to the church and true religion, diuers that were peruerted by the for said heretiques: and protested openly, that he had receaued of th' apostles them selues, that only and sole truth which is deliuered by the Catholique church. Ther are yet a liue that haue heard him tel, how that S. Iohn th' apostle of our Saue our, being once at Ephesus going into a common bath, and seing Cerinthus the heretique to be within; ranne out againe in hast, saying S. Iohns hatred against heretiques. to them that were with him; let vs flee from hence, least the bath fal downe and destroy vs, in which the enimie of God Cerinthus remaineth. The same Policarpe, at the same time when he was at Rome, meeting by chance with Marcion the heretique ther, and being demanded of him whether he knew him or not; answered; vea, I know the for the cheefe child of Satan. So wary were the holy apostles and their schollers, not so much

as to talke with such fellowes, as indeuored by their new commētaries and expositiōs of scriptures, to change the truth before receaued. And so S. Paul warneth vs al to doe, when he saith;  Auoid an heretical man after one or tvvo admonitions, assaring 
                  Tit. 3. 
                  thy self, that such a one is peruers and sinneth, being condemned by his ovvne proper iudgement. Hitherto are the words of holy Irenaeus.
               The same Irenaeus, writing to one Florinus his old acquaintance in schole of Polycarpus (& now beginning to be an heretike in Rome) as foloweth. Thes opinions of thine (O Florinus) to speake Iren. ep. ad' stor. & Euseb. lib 5. cap. 19. frendly, are not true nor wholsome. Thes opinions are repugnant to the Church. Thes opinions thou receauedst not by tradition from the Preestes, that before vs were scholers to the Apostles. I did see thee when I was but a child with Polycarpus in Asia, at what time thou liuing very gorgiously in the Emperours court, diddest indeuour to hold a good opinion with Polycarp. I remember those times wel, & they stike in my mind more firmly, The doings and sayings of S. Polycarp. then other things that passed since. In so much, that I can tel at this time, the very place wherin this blessed man did sit whē he spake vnto vs. I can tel the order and maner of his comming in; the forme and fashion of his life; the shape of his body, the maner of his disputing & of his preaching to the multitude. I remember how he was wont to recompt vnto vs, the familier conuersation that he had with S.

Iohn th' Euangelist, & with diuers others who had seene our Sauiour. I remember how he would tel vnto vs their speaches, & what he had heard them say of Christ; of his miracles, vertues and doctrine, which they had seene with their owne eyes, and heard with their eares, which were al agreing with the scriptures that now we haue.
               
               
                  Thes things through the great mercy of God towards me, I heard at that time, both diligently and attentiuely; not so much committing them to inke & papire, as to the inward cogitation of my minde. And while I liue, I doe and shal by Gods holy grace most carfully renewe the memory therof. And now here before almighty Mark this protestatiō. God, I may truly protest, that if this holy and Apostolical preest Polycarp, should haue heard of such new opinions, as you defende; he would haue stopped his eares, and cried out (according as his fashion was,) O good God, vnto what miserable times, hast thou reserued me, to heare thes things! And presently would haue risen and runne away from the place, where he had bene standing or sitting, when such doctrine should haue bene vttred. Hitherto Irenaeus.
               
               
                  AND NOVV (deare Christiā brother) who would not be moued, with ANNOtatiōs vpō the premisses touchig the danger of nevv opinions. the graue and zelous speeches of thes reuerend men, that liued so nighe to the times of the holy Apostles, and of our Saueour him self? How exceeding great

was their care amiddest al their other tribulations, and at the very last time when they were to depart out of this world, (for Irenaeus also soone after suffered martyrdome,) to forwarne Christiā people to beware of heresie and schisine, and to detest al maner of new commentaries & expositiōs vpon holy scriptures, other then the vniuersal traditiō of the Church did leaue vnto them from the Apostles time. They saw wel and were so tould by the Apostles them selues, that ther was no other certaine waie to vnderstand and hold the truth first planted, but to stick to this tradition (for vnderstanding of scriptures) which should passe from hand to hand, from bishope to bishope, frō doctor The nature and 
                        〈◊〉
                      of tradition. to doctour, from Councel to Councel, frō Church to Church, from age to age vntil the worldes end; and without this, they saw by experience of thos first heresies, that euery heretique would make his part as good as the catholique Church from time to time, by interpreting the scriptures after his owne deuise. To the end thē, that Christes Catholique people might stād together firmly in vnitie of faith, and arme them selues iointly to the contempt of this world & suffering for their master; thes holy men did so carefully crie vpon them, hauing heard at the Apostles own mouthes (as it may be supposed; how detestable a thing heresie was ī the sight of God: and whersoeuer it entred, that ther was no more hope of any vertue or other

good thing to saluation. For which cause it is recorded in like maner, that diuers of thes first martyrs, being brought foorth Apollinar. hiera. apud Niceph. li. 4. c. 23. to die in the company of certaine heretiques, that offered to die also for defence of Christian religion; they refused to goe forth or die in their company, affirming thē in truth to be enimies to IESVS Christ, howsoever otherwise they made profession to die for him.
               This be spoken by the way, concerning thes notable mens zeale in detestation of schisme and heresie, and of new expositiōs of holy scripture against the tradition of antiquitie: which no man can thinke to be from our purpose, if he consider the times wherin we liue, and how litle this tradition is now regarded by many, in respect of their own new deuises and fresh inuentions. But now it foloweth in the forsaid storie of Eusebius, that S. Irenaeus in processe of smal time, came also to make his combat for the confession of his maister, in the citie of Liōs in France; wher, after infinit torments and afflictiōs that he suffered, he ended his life the xxviij. day of The martyrdome of Irenaeus. Iune vnder th' Emperour Seuerus. But before this, he was sent into Asia to the Christians there, from the Christians in France that liued in persecution, and in the way he had letters also to the bishop of Rome Eleutherius, in his own commē
                  dation. Which letters doe wel declare, what a reuerend opinion the martyrs of God had of him. And th' other letters that

he carried into Asia, doe set foorth the maruailous trial that our Sauiour vsed at that time vpon his seruantes. wherof for our instruction, as also for our comfort in aduersities that fal vnto vs, I haue thought good to recite some part also in this place.
               The letters beginne thus. The seruantes of IESVS Christ, that dwel at Lions and The letters of Christiās suffering persecution in France. Apud Evse. lib. 5. c. 1. Vienna in France, send peace in our Lord IESVS, vnto their brethern in Asia and Phrigia, who haue the same faith and hope of redemption &c. The greatnes of our afflictions which grow vpon vs, in this place, and the multitude of torments that we suffer, neither can we, nor any man els by writing expresse. And then they shew first, how they were forbid by publique edict to enter into any common house, boothe, or market place, or to come abrod out of their own dores. Secōdly, frō their owne houses they were fetcht out by officers, led to the market place, and in the way reuiled and spit on by the people, beaten with stones and other weapons which ech mā had in his hand; their apparel pulled from their backes, and this before iudgement was geuen against thē, while yet they expected the comming of the President to determine their cause. Who whē he came, demaunding no other question of them, but only whether they were christiās or no; commaunded al maner of torments to be exercised vpon thē. And for that a noble yong gentilman named

Vetius, began to speake a word or two in their behalf; he was also condemned among the rest, as aduocate of the christians. Thirdly they shew, that al their frindes, acquaintance, and kindred among the Gentils at that time, forsooke them. Their owne seruants for feare of tormēts, came in and accused them most falsly of eating of This vvas a commi accusation of Christiās in thos dayes, in respect of the B. Sacrament, vvhich then vvas holden to be Christs flesh. mans flesh; and that which greeued them most of al, ten of their companie vpon the first sight of torments, abiured Christ openly.
               And yet al this notwithstāding they declare, that Christ their Sauiour forsooke thē not in thos extremities, but cōforted thē aboue al measure, by the noble cōfessiōs and cōbates of diuers others, wherof they recite very strang examples; namely of one Sanctus a deacon, who for al the VVonderful constantie of diuers martyrs. torments the enemies could vse vpon him from morning vnto night, could not be inforced to answere the President to no one question that he demanded, but onely by those two latin wordes (Christianus sum) I am a Christian. Thes two wordes (saith the storie) serued for answere to whatsoeuer he was asked, either touching him self or others. The like they write of one Blandina a noble woman, which wearied out al her tormentours, and therfore in a rage towardes the end of the day, they tied her to a great beame, and hanged her vp in the aire. Which beame for that it represented the forme of a Crosse as shee hanged vpon it: did comfort both her and

al other Christians infinitly. They declare besides, that their holy old bishope named Pothenus (in whose place Irenaeus Pothenus. succeded after) being four score and ten yeares old, and not able so much as to stād on his feete, was caried to the place by the hands of souldiours, and there ended his life with incredible fortitude. And of the foresaid Blandina, they write, that Blandina. being put downe from the beame againe, she was beaten with whippes, rent with yron hookes, set vpon a burning frying pan, and after that, wrapt in a net and cast amōg wilde bulles. In al which torments she kept a mery countenance, thanking God most hartelie for this benefit, and for that shee had sene her owne children die constantly in the same place for the same cause before her.
               They report also of one Attalus a man of great name & authoritie in that cittie, The corage of Attalus the martyr. who being drawē forth of his house, was first lead about the place of spectacle with a table borne before him, wherin was writen in great latine letters, This is Attalus the Christian: and afterward he was abused by the people in al kinde of most extreme villanous maner; but yet because of his calling, the president durst procede no further against him, vntil he had writē to Rome to the Emperour, and receaued answer, which soone after was had, (he in the meane space being kept in prison wher he did singuler much good,) & then vpō the solemne day of the publike faires

that were in Lions, he was brought forth againe, and first put to fight with diuers wild beastes, by which he was greatly torne and tormented, but not slaine. And then after al this, he was placed naked in a chaire of burning yron, and ther examined Great crueltie. of his faith. And when the smoke and lothsome stinch of his flesh that broiled, offended them that stoode about him; he said vnto the people; ò brethren, this is in deed to denoure mans flesh, wherof falsly you accuse vs. And finallie, the storie addeth, that after thes tormentours had ended their furie ī the slaughter of so many Christiās, as it was a very horrour vnto them selues to behold their bodies and bones; yet were they not so satisfied. But first caused the said bodies to be watched in that place for the space of six daies together (vntil they were putrified) to the end that Christians should not steale them away: and then also doubting least some of their reliques might be reserued, if Spite of Infidels against reliques. they should so abandone them; they burnt al to ashes, & caste the same into the great riuer of Rhodanus that ronneth through the citie.
               Thes were the combates (gētle reader) wherby almightie God in thos daies would proue and trie his trustie seruantes. Heare now an other breefe description set doune by Dionisius bishope of Alexā
                  dria of the things that he and other Christians suffered ther in his citie, not long after vnder Decius the Emperour. He

writeth the historie to the Bishop of Antioche, and the same is recorded by Eusebius. Euseb. li. 6. c. 32. & 33. & lib. 7. c. 10. I speak before God (saith he;) & his diuine Maiestie knoweth that I speak the truth, &c. The persecution began here against vs before the Emperors edict came forth, as it were by a certaine prophesie that shortely it would insue. First they A most cruel persecution on Alexandria. began with a certaine godly woman named Quinta, whō they drew by the heels about the citie vpō the pauemēt, & whipped her naked, and finally murdered her with stones. After that, they came in furie vnto al our houses, & drew vs forth, that is, euery man his neighbour according as either hatred moued him or couetousnes to haue his goodes. For what so euer was pretious in our houses, they tooke with them, and the rest they flung out into the streets. This indured for diuers monethes, and many noble Martyrs died in this time; as Appollonia, Serapion, and others; albeit some that were not worthie of this conflict, made shipwrake of their saluation.
               
               At length was published the most horrible edict of Decius against vs, and then might you see that dreadful sentence of our Sauiour fulfilled, that the very elect if it vvere possible, should be driuen to fal. 
                  For first Mat. 24. of al, thos that were rich among vs, or of any great calling (wherof ther were many,) some of them preuented the Magistrates The dāger of riches in persecutiō. and offered them selues voluntarily (as good subiectes) to fulfil the Emperours commandement. Others permitted

them selues as vnwilling, to be drawē by the Magistrates to adore their Gods; others went as allured, and constrained Diuers sortes of filling. (as it were) by persuasiōs of their neighbours, frendes and kinsfolkes: others did it secretly in their owne houses at home: others went with so euil a wil and with so ilfauored a countenance to sacrifice, as they were laughed at by the enimies them selues, for that they had neither corage to deny it, nor yet hart to doe it. Others wēt openly and impudently vnto it, affirming that they had neuer bene Christians in their liues; al which to behold, made vs remember that saing of our Sauiour, hovv 
                     Mat. 19. 
                     hard it is for a riche man to be saued.
                  
               
               
                  Many of the poore sort followed the example of riche men: some fled, some were taken and caried to prison, and after Poore men follovv easilie th' example of the riche. diuers daies were induced to forswere Christ. Others came out and began to suffer tormentes, but presently fainted and denied their faith. But afterward ensued the glorious spectacle of the chosen martyrs: wherof the first was, old Iulian that could not moue by reason of the goute; yet being set vpon a camel, and whipped Constant martyrs. naked through out al the streetes of Alexandria (which you know is very large,) was afterward burned aliue. After him followed Cronion, Macar, Alexander, Heron, Dioscorus, Ammon, Zeno, Ptolomaeus, Ingenes, Mercuria, Dionysia and others. And the said Dioscorus for that he was but yet a child, after a certaine

time was let goe by the president, hoping that he might be corrupted. But he is here with me very constant, and most redy to sustaine a greater conflict when God shall cal him to it.
               
               Thus wrot this blessed man of God; adioining many things of his own examinations and sufferings, which for breuitie sake I omit; onely I may not let passe, that The Zele of Dionys. against Schisme & Heresie. rare zeale which he shewed amiddest al thes his afflictions, against Schismatiques and Heretiques; as may appeare by thos wordes of his, which he writeth in an epistle to Nouatus, when he by new inuentions began to trouble the Church of Euseb. li. 6. cap. 37. Rome. The wordes are recorded by Eusebius & are thes which ensue. It should haue bene thy deuty O N ouatus (saith he,) to haue suffered al inconueniences in the world, rather then to haue broken the concord of Gods Church. And truely that martyrdome which is suffered for the defence of the consent and vnitie of Christs Martyrdom at heretiques hādes more commendable then at Insidels. Church, is no lesse, but rather much more commendable, in mine opinion, then that which is suffered for not sacrifising to Idoles. For that in the later, a man suffereth martyrdome for sauing his owne soule; but in the former, he suffereth for sauing the whole Church. And thus far of Dyonisius.
               
               At the very same time, with this holy mā (though somewhat yonger) liued the famous Prelate and martyr of God, S. Cyprian; Of S. Cyprian. who, (as by his owne writings appeareth

and is recorded by Pontius his Deacon, that liued with him; and by S. Hierom, Pōt. in vit. Cyp. Hier. in catal. Aug. ser. de S. Cyp. S. Augustine & others that ensued him) not onely made many martyrs in his time by his exhortations, and by his exā
                  ple in suffering: but also cōcluded his own life with a most famous martirdome, susteined with al ala critie for his masters sake. He wrote a whole worke in exhortation to martirdome, and an other of the good that commeth to Christians by suffering, and many epistles to the same effect & purpose, especially to such as were in prisons, mines, banishment, and persecution; in which writings of his, he doth most deuinely set out the dignity of this thing. And in the end, whē his owne time drew nere to suffer in like maner, for that th' Emperours edict was determined against Christians; S. Cyprian being in banishment, and hauing receaued newes therof by some that he had sent for that purpose to Rome, aduertised one Successus a Bishop, of the whole matter, and by him the rest of the brethren in Africa in thes wordes.
               
                  Brother Successus, know you, that the men whom I sent to Rome, are returned, and doe bring for certain, that Valerian S. Cyprians epistle vvri ten a litle before his death. the Emperour hath writen to the Senate, that al bishops preestes and deacons be executed presently, &c. The copy of which letters we hope wil come hither Lib. 5. cp. 9. quickly, and so we stand resolued by Gods grace to al sufferance; expecting at the

mercy of our Lord, a croune of life euerlasting. Know you also that Sixtus died three daies before S. Laurence. Sixtus the Bishope of Rome, was put to death the eight day before the Ides of August last. I beseech you that thes things may be signified by your means to al our felow bishopes in thos Prouinces, to the end that by their good exhortatiōs, the whole brother-hood of Christians, may be strengthened and prepared to this spiritual combat that is imminent; and that no man in thes times thinke so much vpon death, as of the immortalitie which hath to folow death. Let euery man (I say) with ful faith and al vertue dedicated to our Lord, reioice rather thē feare, in this confession which we must make; assuring our selues, that the true souldiours of Christ our God, shal not be slaine but crouned therin.
               
               After this not many daies, he liuing in certain orchardes or gardins in the country; was aduertised by his frendes, that two Pursiuantes were sent to take him, & bring him to the citie of Vtica; whervpō he fled. And least any man should thinke perhaps that it was of feare; he wrot an epistle (which was the last that is extant The last letter that euer S. Cyprian vvrote. of his wryting) vnto the Preestes, deacōs, and people of his Church of Carthage wher he was bishope; shewing them the reason why he had retired him self from the hādes of the Purseuantes, in thes wordes. When it was brought vnto vs (deare brethren) that officers were sent to lead Li 5. ep. 1.
                     
me vnto Vtica; by the coūsel of our deare frends I was content, vpon iust cause, to retire my self from our orchardes: for that it seemed to me, conuenient for a Bishope, to make his last confession in that citie, where he hath gouuerned Gods Church; to the end that by his confession, he may honour his flocke & people. And it seemed to me that the honour of our glorious Church of Carthage, should be much deminished S. Cyprian vvould die in Carthage and not in Vtica. at this time, if I, the bishope thereof, should receaue my sentence and death in Vtica. For which cause, I haue alwaies desired & praied almightie God, that I might make my confession & suffer in Carthage, and from thence depart vnto my Lord. So then here we abide presently in a very secret place, expecting the retourne of the Proconsul from Rome to Carthage, who wil bring with him (I doubt not) the determination of the Emperour, touching both bishopes and Iaimen, that are Christians; and wil decree that which our Lord, for the present, wil haue to be done. And as concerning you (my dearest brethen) according to the discipline which alwaies you haue receaued from me out of our Lordes commādementes; doe you obserue al tranquilitie among your selues; let no man raise tumultes touchīg the doings of his brethrē; This also doth S. Augustin repeat out of the place. let no man offer him self to the persecutions, but when he is apprehended, then let him speak; for in that instant, God wil speak in vs, who rather wil haue vs CONRESSOVRS

thē PROFESSOVRS in his cause. Touching Lib. 1. cont. ep. Gaudēt. other things that I would haue you obserue; I hope before my sentence be giuen, by our Lordes instruction to dispose in general. Christs IEVVS keepe and preserue you al long in his Church.
               
               Soone after this was writen, that is, vpon the 13. of September as Pontius and Pont. in vita Cyp. de quo Hiero. in catal. vit. illust. other doe write, came sodainly vpon him, two purseuantes; and apprehending him, brought him to the new Proconsul called Galerius Maximus, at Carthage; wher after a glorious confession made of his faith, (the particularities wherof were here to long to be set downe,) his sentē
                  ce was reade, that he must be behedded. Wherunto S. Cyprian answered, Deo gratias; and so the next daie after, receaued his Martyrdome, at a place called Sexti not far of from Carthage; shutting vp his The martyrdome of S. Cyprian. owne eyes with al peace and confort of minde, and commanding twentie crounes of gold to be giuen to him that cut of his head. And Pontius that was ther present, addeth thes wordes. The brethren stoode rownd about him weeping, and did cast their napkins and prayer bookes before him, that none of his blood might be drūk vp of the ground. His body by reason of the curiositie of the Gentils that pressed S. Cyprians solemne burial vvith tapers &c. about him, was buried for the present in a place nigh bv, but the night following, it was taken thence againe by the Christiās, and caried solemly with torches & wax tapers to the possession of one Macrobius

Candidus, in the way called Apellensis, nigh to the fish pondes, &c.
               
               And the reuerend opinion of this mans sanctitie was so great among Christians euen presently vpon his death, that they builded Churches in his honour and memorie, as may appeare by the storie of S. Victor bishop of Vtica, who liued the next age after, and recordeth in his first booke de persecutione Vandalica, how that the heretical Vandals that were Arians, ouerthrew two goodly Churches in Africa, dedicated to S. Cyprian, th' one in Churches erected to S. Cyprian, vvith solemne festival daies. the place wher he was martired called Sexti, th' other in the place wher his body was buried called Mappalia. S. Augustine also in his confessions lib. 5. cap. 8. maketh mention of a Church in Africa dedicated to S. Cyprian, wher Monaca his mother praied for him at his departure towardes Italie. And in Vide cp. 120. ad Honor. cap. 5. & serm. 12. tem. 10. diuers places he mentioneth the solemnitie which yearly was celebrated in the day of his martirdome; which day (according to the Churches phrase,) he calleth his natiuitie. And in his tenth tome he hath a whole sermon made in the feast of S. Cyprians natiuitie, of which sermō not only venerable Bede maketh mention in his commentarie vpō the second epistle to the Ephesians, but also Possidius S. Austens scholler, in Indiculo. And finally S. Augustine euery wher not only maketh most honorable mention of this blessed martir; but also against the Lib. 5. de bapt. cont. Domt. c. 7. Donatistes desireth to be holpen by his

praiers now in heauen. Wherfore his exā
                  ple ought greately to moue vs.
               I might here recompt many other persecutions, and the singuler combats of infinit particuler men, which could neuer (I dare say) weary the Christian reader. But yet would they be to long for this place. The last general persecutiōs vnder Diocletian and others. Eusebius affirmeth, that to set doune onely the fight susteined in his time, vnder Diocletian, Maximianus, Maximinus, and other tyrants, (which was the last general affliction, before the general peace restored by Constantine:) were a matter of infinit volume. For (saith he) the persaecution See Euseb. toto lib. 8. & 9. began in the moneth of Marche, whē Christians were ready to celebrate the feast of Christs holy passiō. At what time Diocletians first edict was, that al Christiane Churches through out the world, should presently be ouerthrowne, al Pastors therof taken, and by al maner of torments that mans wit could deuise, be enforced to sacrifice together with their people. Thē (saith Eusebius) was it a time, when ech man might easily see who loued the world, or loued God; who was a good A time of trial. Christian, and who was a counterfete; who was true corne, & who was chaffe. Many lost their soules (saith he) in this combat, & many got them eternal crounes. The edict was executed with al rigour and fury throughout al Prouinces at once: and diuers were the issues of such as came into trial. But the infinit glorie of such as conquered, surpassed far the infamie

of such as fel.
               And the ennemy in the end, being vtterly confounded, would gladly haue seemed to haue brought that to passe, which The practise of Gods enimies, for to seeme to haue vvone. he neither did, nor could. For whē by force he had drawen Christians vnto the tē
                  ples of the Idols, he would haue had it seeme, that they came voluntarily; & whē men would not sacrifice, he was desirous at least-wise, that they should permit him to say & publish, that they had sacrificed; others being beaten doune with clubbes vpon their knees, were reported to haue kneeled of their owne wils for adoring the Godes; wherof some cried opēly notwithstanding, that they neither had nor euer would doe so, for any torment that could be laid vpon thē. But the more resolute sorte, they were dealt with in al most cruel and barbarous maner without measure, reason, or order. Wherof you may reade both many and strange examples in the eight and ninth bookes of Eusebius, who wrote the things as he saw them passe; and when our Sauiour permitted al A comfortable consideration. thes extremities to fal vpon his Church, then was the time neerest that he had determined to beautifie her in earth, with greatest peace, rest, riches and glorie: euen as he did immediatly after, by conuerting Constantine to be so zelous a Christian.
               
                  AND HERE NOVV doth end the storie of Eusebius, which conteinēth the conflictes of the first three hundred yeares THE ende of Eusebius storie. after Christes departure. But the ecclesiastical

writers that doe ensue after him, ech man in his age, doe declare, that after the times of Constantine, the Catholique Church inioyed not longe her temporal peace, but had her exercise from time to time, albeit in an other sorte then before: that is to saie, not by Pagans, but by such as some times had bene her owne childrē; a far more lothesome, odious, cruel, and The persecutiō of heretiques more cruel then of Pagans. dangerous afflictiō then the former.

this mans doings, and sheweth that in his The relatiō of S. Gregorie touching Iulian. youth, both he & S. Basile were acquainted with Iulian in the grammer schole. At what time he saith, they wel fore saw great signes of wickednes in him; notwithstánding at that time, he seemed verie deuout, and for deuotions sake (though he were a great Prince) he would needes take vpon him the office of lectorship in the Catholique Church, and besides that (saith S. Gregorie) began to build Churches also to christian Martyrs. But when he came to be Emperour, he washed of his Iulian denout in his youth. baptisme with bloud, and profaned his hands of purpose (saith S. Gregorie) wher with before he had touched the most pure 
                  Orat. prima in Iulia. pag. 556.

               After this, he made an edict for the spoiling and profaning (saith this Sainct) of al Church-stuffe, mony, sacred ornaments The vvicked edictes of Iulian. and holy vestements, that were to be had: for defiling of aulters, for deshonoring preestes, deacons, and Virgins; but principally, for breaking downe of Martyrs sepulchres, and for the distroying their Churches. In respect wherof, this holy father writeth vnto him thus. Thou persecutour after Herod; thou traitour after Iudas; thou murderer of Christ after Pilat; thou ennemy of God after the Iewes: Orat. 2. in Iudic. pag. 559. dost thou not reuerence those holie sacricrifices slaine for Christ?

               But now after the death of wicked Iulian, albeit some times, good Emperors The Arriā persecution. were sent by God; yet indured they not long, but the Arriā heretiques came in gouernmēt againe, & so did beare the swaie for diuers ages after; afflicting & persecuting most extremely the Catholiks, as may appeare by al the ecclesiastical writers that are extāt of that time. And for a better coniecture what was done and suffered in the whole world abrod, I would wish thee (gentle reader) but to vew that which remaineth writé of one parte only, and that for the space of few years; I meane of the persecution of the Arrian Vandals in Africa, which began not long before S. Augustins death, and indured diuers

years after, and is recorded in three seueral bookes by the holy man, Victor bishope of Vtica, that was one of the sufferers. The storie is strange, and most worthie the reading, for that it hath very many things, which set foorth the perfect forme of times, that haue insued since, and yet doe indure.
               Possidius that liued with S. Augustin, & after writ the storie of his life, reporteth S. Augustines greefe & sorrovv for the Vā
                     dal persecution. in the same, that when the holy man saw but the beginninges of this persecution, he was wonderfully afflicted with compassion in his minde. For (saieth he,) he saw now alredy Catholique Churches destitute of their priestes; sacred Virgins and others that liued continent, to be dissipated and cast out; the Hymnes and praises of God, to haue ceased in most Churches; the buildings of Churches burned; the solemne seruice due vnto almightie God, to be no more vsed in their proper places; the diuine sacrifices and sacramentes, either not to be sought for any longer, or els that ther were not easily found priestes to minister the same vnto such as sought them. Hitherto are the wordes of Possidius.
               But S. Victor, comming to declare the said persecution more in particuler; sheweth, that albeit they were cruel against al Catholiques in general: yet saith he, Vict. l. 1. de pers. Vand. 
                  praecipuè in ecclesijs, basilicis

                   They principally did excercise their wicked crueltie,

vpon Churches, oratories, church-yards, and Monasteries. And then he goeth forward, shewing their further cruelties and outrages in abusing preestes and monkes, and in spoiling alters: of which he saith in particuler, de pallis altaris, (proh nesas) 
                  Note that things and conferre thē vvith our times. 
                  camisias sibi & femoralia faciebant. Of the corporesses, and other clothes of the aulter, (sie on the villanie) they made them selues shirtes and briches. Further he addeth, that they gathering diuers sacred Virgins together, against al shame, would behold and handle the priuie partes of their bodies; whom afterward (for that they would not be leud with them,) they tormented with fire, and threw into riuers with stones tied to their feet, saying vnto them, tel vs how doe your bishops and clergie men vse to lie with you? besides al this, he saith, that they prohibited Catholiques, Missas agere vel tractare; to haue Masse or to talke therof; they forbide them also to burie Christians solemly, with lightes tapers and torches; and finally, they forbid them al excercise of their Catholique Christian religion. And for that in thes things they were not obeied as they desired, but were resisted openly and manfully, by them that had spirit & corage from God, to doe it: therfore did they rage and fome aboue al measure, and did excercise more extremitie in al despiteful and villanous kind of cruelties, then did the Pagan persecutours, either before or after.
               
                  
                  NOVV THEN to make here our staie, and to passe no further in this discourse: THE conclusion of this chapter. thou seest (deare brother) in this descent of Gods Church for fiue hūdred years together after Christs departure; how ordinarie a thing it was to our Saue our to send persecution vnto his dearest seruants for their trial and merit. In which matter notwithstanding is diligently to be considered; first, the greatenes and sharpnesse  of this trial, to the end we be not desmaied Fovver things to be considered. when the like, more or lesse, doe fal vnto our lot. Secondly, how pittiful and miserable the fal of diuers were in this trial,  to the losse of their soules and eternal desolation. Thirdly, how the causes of this  their fal were, either pride and temeritie, wherby they tempted God; or els the loue of this present world, wherby they were allured to forsake their Lord and master. Fourthly, how glorious the victorie was  of thos that were resolute, and how euerlasting their reward both in this world & in the world to come.
               Besides this, it shal not be amisse for thee to consider and that for thy particuler A comfortable consideratiō for a Catholique that suffereth. comfort, if thou be a Catholique; how careful thes holy Martyrs were that suffered in the primatiue Church, to keepe them selues within the vnitie of Catholique faith & doctrine, deliuered vniuersally by tradition, in al Churches frō age to age; to the end their sufferinges and labour; might reccaue their merit. How diligēt also they were in aduertising others

of this important pointe, assuring them that without this, their trauailes could be of no profit or auaile. And as it is most euident and certaine, that al thes blessed martyrs & Sainctes which before I haue named, together with their brethren, did cōtinue by successiō for fiue hundred years together, in the common knowen faith of Christēdome, called at that time, Catholique; and did defend the same both by wordes writing and suffering against al apostaces, heretiques, schismatiques, or other newfangled enemies whatsoeuer: So is it as euidēt & apparēt to the world, that the same vniuersal & general church, faith, and doctrine, which thes men left, haue continued euer since vntil this daie, (and shal doe to the worlds ende) fighting and striuing against al new vpstart enemies of the same traditiō of Christian religion, which thes mē so carefully commended vnto vs.
               By al which, as also by the maner of persecution that was then, and by the An illatiō vpon the premisses. thinges them selues that were suffered at heretiques hādes in thes old times, euerie Catl. olique man that by Gods special grace, is made worthie to suffer the like in thes our daies, maie take singuler comfort and great instruction therin; considering, nubem illam testium propositam, as S. Paul calleth Heb. 12. it; that is, the great multitude and cloude of examples and witnesses that haue gone before vs, to instruct and animate vs in this battaile. 
                  And the holy Apostle
vseth the word, cloude, to allude by a metaphore vnto that cloude which out Sauiour sent to the people of Israel, to Exod. 13. direct their iourney in the deserte; insinuating hereby, that thes excellent examples of holy Martyrs and Confessours which I haue named before to haue suffered so valiantely in the primatiue church, ought to be vnto vs, a most certaine direction both for corage, cōstancie, wisdome, alacretie, and resolution in this spiritual fight: assuring our selues that we following their steppes, in fighting for the like cause, against the like enemies, with like fortitude and humilitie, and in like patience and longanimantie as they did: we shal not want the like grace, like comfort, like assistance, like merit and reward at our merciful Sauiours hand, as they receaued.
            
            
               
               THE FIFT IMPEDIMENT OF RESOLVTION, IN THE SERVICE OF ALmightie God. Proceeding of ouer much presumption in the mercie of our Sauiour, vvithout remembrance of his iustice. CHAPT. VI.
               AS many men, for their excuse against the resolutiō which we persuade, doe serue them selues with the reasons that before we haue confuted: So is ther an other forte of people that taketh a more shorte way to dispatch their handes of al that can be said to moue thē by seare, (quite contrary to them whom in the first chapter of this second part I answered:) & this way is, to lay the whole matter of their stay vpon the backe and shoulders of our Sauiour Christ himself; and to answere what soeuer you can say against them, with this onely sentence;

                  God is merciful. Of thes men our Saue our seemeth to complaine greeuously by the prophet, when he saieth, Supra dor sum meū
                   
                  Psa. 128. 
                  fabricauerunt peceatores, prolongauerunt iniquitatem; Sinners haue built vpon my backe, they haue prolonged their iniquitie. By Building on Gods back. which wordes he signifieth, that prolonging of our iniquities in hope of Gods mercie, is to build our sinnes on his back and shoulders. But what foloweth? wil God beare this iniurie? no verelie; for the next wordes ensuing are; Dominus iustus cō
                     cidet ceruices peccatorum; God is iust, and he wil cut in sunder the neckes of sinners. Here (loe) are two cooling cardes, for the two warme imaginations before recited. For meane you (Syr) to prolong your iniquitie, for that God is merciful? remember then also, that he is iust, saieth the prophet. Are ye gotten vp, vpon the backe of almightie God, to make your nest of sinne there? take heed; for he wil fetch you doune againe, and breake your necke douneward, except ye repent; for that in deed there is no one thing which may be more iniurious to Gods diuine maiestie, then to make him the foundation of our sinful life, who lost his owne life for the extinguishing of sinne.
               But you wil say perhappes; And is not God then merciful? yes truely (deare brother,) Hovv God is both mer ciful and iust. he is most merciful; & there is neither end nor measure of his mercie; he is euen mercie it self; it is his nature and essence; and he can no more leaue to be merciful,

then he can leaue to be God. But yet (as the prophet here saith) he is iust also. We must not so remember his mercie, as we forget his iustice. Duleis & rectus dominus, our Lord is swete, but yet vpright & iust also, saith holy Dauid. And in the same place, al the vvaies of our Lord are mercie and 
                  Psal. 24. Ser. 52. paruorum. The tvvo feete of God. 
                  trueth. Which words S. Barnard expounding in a certaine sermon of his, saieth thus. There be two feete of our Lord, wherby he walketh his waies: That is, Mercie & Trueth: and God fastneth both thes feete vpon the hartes of them which turne vnto him. And euery sinner that wil truely conuert him self, must lay hand-fast on both thes feete. For if he should lay hande on mercy onely, letting passe truth & iustice: he would perish by presumptiō. And on th' other side, if he should apprehend iustice onely, without mercie; he would perish by desperation. To the end therfore that he may be saued, he must humblie fal doune and kisse both thes feete: that in respect of Gods iustice, he may retaine feare; and in respect of his mercie, he may conceaue hope. And in an Ser. 6. in cant. other place; Happie is that soule, vpon which our Lord IESVS Christ hath placed both his feete. I wil not sing vnto thee, Iudgement alone, nor yet mercie alone (my God,) but I wil sing vnto thee, with the prophet Dauid, mercie and iudgement Psa 110. ioined together. And I wil neuer forget Psa. 148. thos two iustifications of thine.
               S. Austen handleth this point most August. excellently

in diuerse places of his workes. Let them marke (saieth he) which loue so much mercie and gentlenes in our Lord; Tract. 33. in Ioh. let them marke (I say) and feare also his trueth. For (as the prophet saieth) God is both swete and iust. Doest thou loue that Psal. 24. he is sweete? feare also that he is iust. As a sweete Lord he said, I haue held my peace at your sinnes. But as a iust. Lord he addeth, And thinke you that I vvil hold my peace still 
                     Psa. 102. God is merciful, and ful of mercies, say you: it is most certaine; yea adde vnto this, that he beareth long. But yet feare that which commeth in the verses ende; & verax; That is, he is also true and iust. There be two things wherby sinners doe stand in danger; Tvvo daun gers of sinners. the one, in hoping to much, (which is presumptiō;) th' other, in hoping to litle, which is desperation. Who is deceiued by hoping to much? He which saieth to himself, God is a good God, a merciful God, & therfore I wil doe what pleaseth me: and why so? because God is a merciful God, a good God, a gentle God. Thes men runne into daunger by hoping to much. Who are in daunger by despaire? they, which seing their sinnes greuous, and thinkīng it now vnpossible to be pardoned, say within them-selues; wel, wee are once to be damned: why doe we not then whatsoeuer pleaseth vs best in this life? Thes mē are murdered by desperation, th' other by hope. What therfore doeth God for gaining of both thes men? To him which is in daunger by hope, he saieth; Doe not say 
                     Eccl. 5.
                     
                     vvith thy self, the mercie of God is great, he vvil be merciful to the multitude of my sinnes; for the face of his vvrath is vpon sinners. To him that is in danger by desperation, he saieth: At vvhat time soeuer a sinner shal turne him self to 
                     Ezec. 11. 
                     me, I vvil forget his iniquities.
                   Thus farre S. Austē; besides much more which he addeth in the same place, touching the great peril and folie of thos men, who vpon vaine hope of Gods mercie, doe perseuer in their euil life.
               It is truely (deare brother) a verie euil consequent, and a most vniust kind of reasoning, An 
                        〈◊〉
                      maner of reasoning. to say; that for so much as almightie God is merciful & long suffering, therfore wil I abuse his mercie, and continue in my wickednes. The scripture teacheth vs not to reason so, but rather quite contrarie. God is merciful, and expecteth my conuersion, and the longer he expecteth, the more greeuous wil be his punishment when it commeth, if I neglect his patience: and therfore I ought presently to accept of his mercie. So reasoneth S. Paul, who saieth, doest thou contemne the riches Rom. 2. of his long suffering and gentlenes? Doest thou not know that the patience of God towardes thee, is vsed to bring the to repentāce? But thou through the hardnes of thy hart, and irrepentant mind, doest hoard and heape vp to thy self wrath, in the day of vengeance, at the reuelation of Gods iust iudgemēt. In which wordes S. Paul signifieth, that the longer God suffereth vs with patiēce in our wickednes,

the greater heape of vengeance doth he gather against vs, if we persist obstinate in the same. Wherunto S. Augustin addeth an other consideration of great Tract. 33. in loan. dread and feare; and that is,  if he offer thee grace (saith he) to day, thou knowest not whether he wil doe the same tomorow. If he geue thee life and memorie this weeke; thou knowest litle whether thou shalt enioy that benefit the next.
               
               The holie prophet beginning his seuentie and second Psalme, of the dangerous Gods goodnes nothing helpeth thos that perseuer in sinne. prosperitie of worldlie men; vseth these wordes of admiration; Hovv good a God is the God of Israel, vnto thē that be of a right hart? And yet in al that Psalme, he doth nothig els but shew the heauie iustice of God towardes Psa. 72. the wicked, euen when he geueth thē most prosperities, & worldlie wealth; and his conclusion is; Behold (ô Lord) they shal perish vvhich departe from thee; thou hast destroyed al those that haue broken their faith of 
                        〈◊〉
                      vvith the. By which is signified, that how good soeuer God be vnto the iust; yet that pertaineth nothing to the releefe of the wicked, who are to receiue iust vengeance at his handes, amiddest the greatest mercies bestowed vpon the godlie. The eyes of our Lord are vpon the iust, 
                  Psa. 33. (saieth the same prophet,) and his eares are bent to heare their praiers; but the face of our Lord is vpon them that doe euil, to destroie their memorie, from out of the earth.
               
               It was an old practise of deceiuing prophetes, resisted stronglie by the prophetes

of God, to crie, peace peace, vnto wicked men; when in deed their was nothing towardes them but daunger, sword and Ier. 6. 8. destruction; according as the true prophetes fortolde, and as the euent proued. Wherfore, the prophet Dauid geueth vs a notable & sure rule to gouerne our hope Ezec. 13. and confidence withal, when he saith, sacrificate sacrificiū iustitiae, & sperate in domino; doe you sacrifice vnto God the sacrifice of righteousnes, and then trust in him. Wherwith S. Iohn agreeth when he saith, If our hart or conscience doe not reprehend vs [for 1. Io. 3. wicked life:] then haue vve confidence vvith God; As who wold saie; if our conscience be guiltie of lewde and wicked life, & we resolued to dwel and continue therin; then in vaine haue we confidence in the mercies of God, vnto whose iust iudgemēt we stand subiect for our wickednes.
               It is most wonderful, and dreadful to consider, how almightie God hath vsed The seuertie of God punishmēt vpon same. him self towardes his best beloued in this world, vpon offence geuen by occasion of finne; how easelie he hath chaunged countenance; how soone he hath broken of frendshippe; how straitlie he hath takē accompt; and how seuerelie he hath punished. The Angels that he created with 1. The Angels. so great care and loue, and to whom he imparted to singular priuileges, of al kinde of perfections, as he made them almost verie Goddes, (in a certaine maner,) committed but onelie one sinne of pride agaīst Esa. 14. his maiestie, and that onelie in thought,

as diuines doe hold; and yet presentlie, al that good wil and fauour was chaunged into iustice; and that also so seuere, as they were throwen downe to eternal tormentes, without redemptiō; designed for euer, to abide the rigour of hel fire and intollerable 2. Pet. 2. Ep. Iud. darkenes.
               After this, almightie God made to him self an other new frend of flesh & blood, Adam & Eve. which was our first father Adam in paradises where God conuersed with him so frendlie and familiarlie, as is most wounderful to consider. He called him, he talked with him, he made al creatures in the world subiect vnto him; he brought them al before him, to the end that he, and not God, should geue to them their names. He made a mate and companion for him; he blessed them both; and finallie, shewed al possible tokens of loue, that might be. But what ensewed? Adam committed but one sinne; and that, at the entisement of an other; and that also a sinne of smal importance, (as it may seeme to mans reason,) being but the eating of an aple forbidden: and yet the matter was no sooner done, but al frendship was brokē betwene God and him; he was thrust out of paradise, condemned to perpetual miserie, and al his prosperitie to eternal damnation, together with him self, if he had not repented. And how seuerelie this greuous sentence was executed afterward, maie appeare Great seueritie. by the infinite milliōs that went to hel for this sinne, for the space of fower

thousand yeres, that passed before it was ransōmed; which finallie could not be done, but by the comming downe of Gods owne sonne, the second person in Trinitie, into this flesh; & by his intolerable sufferinges, and death in the same.
               The two miracles of the world, Moyses 3. Moyses & Aaron. and Aaron, were of singular authoritie and fauour with God; in so much as they could obtaine any thing at his hādes for other men. And yet, when they offended God once them selues at the waters Num. 20. 27. 33. of contradiction in the desert of sin, for that they dowted somewhat of the miracle Den. 10. 33. 34. promised to them by God, and therby did dishonour his maiestie before the people, as he saieth: they were presentlie rebuked most sharpelie for the same. And albeit they repented hartelie that offence; and so, obtained remission of the fault or guilt: yet was there laid vpon them a greuous punishment for the same; & that was, that they should not enter them selues into the land of promise, but should die when they came within the sight therof. And albeit they entreated God most earnestlie for the release of this penance: yet could they neuer obtaine the same at his hādes, but alwaies he answered thē; seing you haue dishonoured me before the people, you shal die for it, and shal not enter into the land of promise.
               In what special great fauour was 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  4. Saul. with God, when he chose him to be the first king of his people? caused Samuel the

prophet so much to honour him, and to 1. Re. 10. & 11. Act. 13. annoint him prince vpō Gods own inheritance, as he calleth it? when he commē
                  ded him so much, and tooke such tender care ouer him? And yet afterward, for that he brake Gods commandement in reseruing 1. Re. 13. 15. 16. certaine spoyles of warre, which he should haue destroied, yea, though he reserued them to honour God withal, as he pretended: yet was he presentlie cast of by God, degraded of his dignitie, geuen ouer to the handes of an euil spirite, brought to infinite miseries, (though he shifted out 1. Re. 16. for a time,) and finallie so forsaken and abandoned by God, as he slew him self, 1. Re. 31. his sonnes were crucified on a crosse by his enemies, and al his familie and linage 1. Par. 10. extinguished for euer.
               K. Dauid was the chosen and deare frend of God, & honoured with the title 5. Dauid. of one that vvas according to Gods ovvne hart. But yet, as so one as he had sinned, the prophet Nathan was sent to denounce Gods 2. Re. 12. heauie displeasure and punishment vpon him. And so it ensued, not with standing his greate and voluntarie penance that Psal. 34. 68. 108. 101. him self added for the pacifying of Gods wrath, by fasting, praier, weeping, wearing Psal. 29. of sacke-cloth, eating of ashes, & the like. By which is euident, that how great Gods mercie is to them that feare him, so great is his iustice to thē that offend him.
               The holie scripture hath infinite examples of this matter; as the reiectiō of Cain Gen. 4. and his posteritie streight vpon his murder.

The pitiful drowning of the whole Gene. 8. world in the time of Noe. The dreadful Gen. 19. consuming of Sodom and Gomorra with the cities about it, by fire & brimston. The sending downe quicke vnto hel, of Chore Num. 16. Dathan and Abiron, with the slaughter of two hundred and fiftie their adherēts, for rebellion against Moyses and Aaron. The suddain killing of Nadab and Abiu, 1. Le. 10. sonnes of Aaron, and chosen preestes, for once offering on the Aultar other fire then was appointed them. The most terrible striking dead of Ananias and Saphira, Act. 5. for retaining some parte of their owne goodes, by deceit, frō the Apostles: with many more such examples, which holie writ doth recount.
               And as for the grecuousnes of Gods iustice, and heauines of his hand when it The heauines of gods hand. lighteth vpon vs, though it may appeare sufficientlie by al thes examples before alleaged, (wherin the particular punishmentes, as you see, are most rigorous:) yet wil I repeat one act of almightie God more, owt of the scripture, which expresseth the same in wounderful sort and maner. It is wel knowne that Beniamin among Gen. 42. 43. al the twelue sonnes of Iacob, was the dearest vnto his father, as appeareth in the booke of Genesis; (& therfore also greatlie respected by God; and his tribe placed in the best part of al the land of promise, vpon the diuision therof, hauing Iosu. 18. Ierusalem, Iericho, & other the best cities within it:) Yet notwithstanding for one

onelie sinne committed by certaine priuate men in the citie of Gabaa, vpon the wife of a Leuit; God punished the whole tribe, in this order, as holy scripture recounteth. He caused al the other eleuen Iudi. 19. 20. tribes to rise against them; & first, to come to the house of God in Silo, to aske his aduise, and to folow his direction in this warre against their brethren. And thence hauing by Godes appointement ioined battaile twise with the tribe of Beniamin, the third daie God gaue them so great a victorie, as they slew al the liuing creatures, within the compasse of that tribe, except onelie six hundred men that escaped awaie into the desert: the rest were slaine both man, woman, children, and infantes, together with al the beastes, and cattel; & al the cities, villages, and howses burnt with fire. And al this, for one sinne committed onelie at one time, with one woman.
               And who then (deare Christian brother) wil not confesse with Moyses, that 
                  A consideration vpon the premisses. 
                  God is a iust God, a great God, and a terrible God? Who wil not confesse with S. Paul, that it is horrible to fal into the handes of the liuing God? Who wil not say with holy Dauid: Deu. 10. Heb. 10. Psa. 118. 
                  A Iudicijs tuis timui; I haue feared at the remembrance of thy iudgementes. If God would not spare the destroying of a whole tribe, for one sinne onely: if he would not perdon Chore, Dathan, and Abiron for once: the sonnes of Aaron for once: Ananias, & Saphira, for once: if he would

not forgiue Esau, though he demaunded it with teares, as S. Paul saieth: if he would Heb. 12. not remit the punishment of one fault to Moyses & Aaron, albeit they asked it with great instance: if he would not forgiue one proude cogitation, vnto the Angels: nor the eating of one apple vnto Adā, without infinite punishment; nor would passe ouer the cuppe of affliction from his own deare sonne, though he required the same thrise, vpō his verie knees, with the sweate of blood and water in his presence: what reason hast thou (my brother) Mat. 26. to thike, that he wil let passe so many sinnes of thine vnpunished? what cause hast thou to induce thy imagination, that he wil deale extraordinarilie with thee, & breake the course of his iustice for thy sake? Art thou better then thos whom I haue named? or hast thou any priuilege from his Maiestie aboue them?
               If thou wouldest consider the great and strange effectes of his iustice, which we Great and straunge effectes of gods iustice. see dailie executed in the world: thou shouldest haue litle cause to persuade thy self so fauorablie, or rather to flatter thy self so daungerously, as thou doest. We see that, notwithstanding Godes mercie, yea after the death and passion of Christ our Sauiour, for sauing of the whole world: yet so many infinite millions be damned daily, by the iustice of almightie God; so many insideles, heathens, Iewes and Turkes, that remaine in the darknes of their owne ignorance; and among Christīans,

so many heretiques and misbeleuers; and among Catholiques, so many euel liuers, as Christ truely said, that few were they Ma. 7. 20. which should be saued; albeit his death was paid for al, if by their own wickednes they made them selues not vnworthie therof. And before the comming of our Sauiour much more we see, that al the world went awrie to damnatió, for many thousand yeres together, excepting a few Iewes, which were the people of God. And yet among them also, the greater part perhappes were not saued, as may be cōiectured by the speeches of the prophetes from time to time: and specially by the sayings of Christ to the harisees and other rulers therof. Now then, if God for the satisfying of his justice, could let so many millions perish, through their own sinnes, as he doth also now daily permit, without any preiudice or impechement to his infinit mercie; why may not he also damne thee forthy sinnes, notwithstanding his mercie, seing thou doest not onely commit them without feare, but also doest confidently persist in the same?
               
                  The 2. part of the chapter.
                  
                     BVT HERE now perhappes some man may say, if this be so, that God is so seuere in punishment of euery sinne; and VVHEther Gods mercie be greater thē his iustice. that he damneth so many thousandes for one that he saueth: how is it true, that the mercies of God are aboue al his other vvorkes,
                     
(as holy scripture affirmeth,) and that it 
                     Psal. 14. lac. 2. 
                     passeth and exalteth it self aboue his iudgement? For if the number of the damned doe exceede so much the number of thos which are saued; it seemeth that the worke of iustice doth passe the worke of mercie. To which I answere, that touching the smal number of them that are saued, as also of th' infinit quantitie of such as are damned, we may in no wise doute; for that besides al other prophetes, Christ our Sauiour hath made the matter certaine, and out of Mat. 7. & 20. question. We haue to see therfore, how, notwithstāding al this, the mercie of God doth exceede his other workes.
                  And first, his mercie may be said to exceede, for that, al our saluation is of his mercie, and our damnation from our selues The first vvay hovv Gods mercie is aboue his iustice. Ose. 13. only, as from the first and principal causes therof, according to the saying of God, by the prophet, Perditio tua Israel, tantummodò in me auxilium tuum. 
                     Thy perdition is onely from thy self (ô Israel) and thy assistance to doe good, is onely from me. So that, as we must acknowledge Gods grace and mercie for th' author of euerie good thought and acte that we doe, and consequently, ascribe al our saluatiō vnto him: so none of our euil actes (for which we are damned) doe proceede from him, but onely from our selues, and so he is no cause at al of our damnation; and in this doth his mercie exceede his iustice.
                  Secondlie, his mercie doth exceede, in The 2. vvay. that he desireth al men to be saued, as S.

Paul teacheth, and him self protesteth, 1. Tī. 2. Exe. 18. when he saieth, I vvil not the death of a sinner, but rather that he turne from his vvikednes and liue. And againe by the prophet Ieremie, he complaineth greeuouslie that men wil not accept of his mercie offered. Turne from your vvicked vvaies (saith he,) vvhy vvil ye die, a you house of Israel? By which Iere. 3. appeareth, that he offereth his mercie most willinglie and freelie to al, but vseth his iustice onelie vpon necessitie (as it were;) cōstrained therunto by our obstinate behauiour. This, our Sauiour Christ signifieth more plainlie, when he saith to Ierusalem; O Ierusalem, which killest the prophetes, and stonest them to death that Math. 23. are sent vnto thee; how oftē wold I haue gathered thy children together, as the henne clocketh her chickins vnderneth her winges, but thou woldest not? behold thy house (for this cause) shal be made desert, and left without children. Here you see thee mercie of God often offered vnto the Iewes: but, for that they refused it, he was enforced (in a certaine maner) to pronounce this heauie sentence of destruction and desolatiō vpon them; which he fulfilled within fortie or fiftie yeares after, by the handes of Titus and Vespasian, Ioseph de bello Iud. L1. c. 1. 2. 3. Emperours of Rome; who vtterlie ouerthrewe the citie of Ierusalem, and the whole nation of Iewes, whom we see dispersed ouer al the world at this daie, in bondage both of bodie & soule. Which worke of Gods Iustice, though it be most

terrible; yet was his mercie greater to thē, as appeareth by Christs wordes, if they had not reiected the same.
                  Thirdlie, his mercie exceedeth his iustice, The 3. vvay. euen towardes the damned them selues; in that he vsed many meanes to saue them in this life, by geuing them freewil and assisting the same with his grace to doe good: by mouing thē inwardlie with infinite good inspirations: by alluring thē outwardlie with exhortatiōs, promisses, examples of others; as also by sicknes, aduersities, and other gentle corrections. By geuing them space to repent, with occasions, opportunities, and excitations vnto the same. By threatning thē eternal death, if they repented not. Al which thinges being effectes of mercie, and goodnes towardes them; they must needes confesse amiddest their greatest furie and tormentes, that his iudgementes are true, & iustified in them selues, and no waies to be cō
                     pared with the greatnes of his mercies.
                  By this then we see that to be true, which the prophet saieth, Misericordiam & 
                     Psa. 53. 
                     veritatem diligit dominus; God loueth mercie and trueth. And againe; Mercie and trueth haue met together; Iustice and peace haue kissed 
                     Psa. 84. 
                     on an other. We see the reason why the same Psa. 100. prophet protesteth of him self; I vvil sing vnto thee mercie and iudgement, (ô Lord,) not mercie alone, nor iudgement alone, but mercie and iudgement together: that is, I wil not so presume of thy mercie, as I wil not feare thy iudgement: nor yet wil

I so feare thy iudgement, as I wil euer Feare to be ioined vvith hope. despaire of thy mercie. The feare of Gods iudgement, is alwaies to be ioined with our confidence in Gods mercie; yea in verie Saintes them selues, as Dauid saith. But what feare? that feare trulie, which the Psa. 33. scripture describeth, whē it saith: the feare of our Lord expelleth sinne: the feare of Eccle. 1. Prou. 1. Eccl. 7. Eccl. 15. Eccl. 7. Eccl. 2. God hateth al euil. He that feareth God, neglecteth nothing; he that feareth God, wil turne and looke into his owne hart: he that feareth God, wil doe good woorkes. They which feare God, wil not be incredulous to that which he saith; but wil keepe his waies, and seeke out the things that are pleasant vnto him. They wil prepare their hartes, & sanctifie their soules in his sight.
                  
                  This is the description of the true feare of God, set downe by holie scripture. This The praise of true feare. is the description of that feare, which is so much commended and commanded in euerie part and parcel of Gods worde. Of that feare (I saie) which is called, Fons vitae, radix prudentiae, corona & plenitudo sapientiae, 
                     Pro. 14. 
                     gloria & gloriatio, beatum donum: 
                     That is, the fountaine of life, the roote of prudence, the crowne and fulnes of wisdome, the Eccle. 1. 5. glorie and gloriation of a Christian man; a happie gift. Of him that hath this feare the scripture saith, happie is the man vvhich feareth our Lord, for he vvil place his minde vpon 
                     Psa. 111. 
                     his comman lementes. And againe, the man that feareth God shalbe happie at the last end, and 
                     Eccle. 1. 
                     shalbe blessed at the day of his death. Finally, of

such as haue this feare, the scripture saith, that God is their foundation; God hath Psal. 24. Psal 30. Psal. 60. Psal. 62. Psa. 144. prepared great multitude of sweetnes for them; God hath purchased them an inheritance; God is as merciful to them, as the father is merciful vnto his children. And (to conclude) Voluntatem timentium se faciet; God wil doe the wil of those that feare him with this feare.
                  This holie feare had good Iob, when he said to God; I feared al my vvorkes. And he yealdeth the reason therof; For that I 
                     Iob. 9. 
                     knevve that tbovv sparest not him that offendeth thee. This feare lacked the other, of whō the prophet saieth: The sinner hath exasperated God, by saying, that God wil not Psal. 9. take accompt of his doings, in the multitude of wrath. Thy iudgementes (ò Lord) are remoued from his sight. And againe; vvherfore hath the vvicked man stirred vp God against him self, by saying God vvil not take account of my doings?
                     It is a great exasperation of God against vs, to take the one halfe of Gods nature from him, which is, so make him merciful without iustice; and to liue so, as though God wold take no account of our life; wheras he hath protested most earnestlie the contrarie; saying, that he is like a hard and couetous man, which wil not be contēt to receiue his owne againe, Mat. 25. but also wil haue vsurie for the lone: that he wil haue a straite reckoning of al his. Luc. 16. goodes lent vs: that he wil haue fruite for al his labours bestowed vpon vs: & finallie; Mat. 7. that he wil haue account for euery Luc. 13.
                     
word that we haue spoken. Mat. 12.
                  
                  Our Sauiour Christ, in the three score and eight psalme, which in sundrie places Mat. 27. Marc. 15. Ioh. 2. of the gospel he interpreteth to be writen of himself, among other dreadful curses, which he setteth down against the reprobate, he hath these; let their eyes be daseled in such sorte as they may not see: povvre out thy vvrath (my Father) vpō thē, let the furie of thy vengeance take hād fast on thē. Adde iniquity vpō their miquitie, & let him not enter into thy iustice. Let them be blotted out of the booke of life; & let them not be enrolled together vvith the iust. Here (loe) we see, that the greatest curse which God can laye vpon vs, next before our blotting out of the booke of life, is to suffer vs to be so blinded, as to adde iniquitie vpon iniquitie, and not to enter into cōsideration of his iustice. For which cause also, this confident kinde of sinning D. Tho, secunda. secundae. q. 14. art. 1. 2. 3. vpon hope of Gods mercie, is accounted by diuines for the first of the six greuous sinnes against the holie Ghost, which our Sauiour in the gospel, signifieth to be so hardlie pardoned vnto men by his Father. VVhy presumption is a sinne against the holy Ghost. And the reason why they cal this a sinne against the holie Ghost, is, for that it reiecteth wilfullie one of the principal meanes left by the holie Ghost, to retire vs from sinne; which is, the feare and respect of Gods iustice vpon sinners.
                  Wherfore, to conclude this matter of presumption: me thinkes, we may vse the The dāger of not fearing. same kinde of argumēt touching the feare of Gods iustice, as S. Paul vseth to the Romanes Rom. 13.
                     
of the feare of Gods ministers; which are temporal princes. Wouldest thou not feare the power of a temporal prince, saith he? doe wel then; and thou shalt not onelie not feare, but also receiue laude and praise therfore. But if thou doe euil, then feare; for he beareth not the sword without a cause. In like sort may we saye to those good felowes, which make God so merciful, as no man ought to feare his iustice. Would ye not feare (my brethrē) the iustice of God in punishmēt? liue vertuouslie then, and you shal be as voide of feare, as lions are, saieth the wiseman: For that, perfect charitie expelleth feare. 
                     Pro. 28. But if you liue wickedlie, then haue you 1. Ioh. 4. cause to feare, for God called not him self a iust iudge for nothing. 2. Ti. 4.
                  
                  If the matter had bene so secure, as many men by flatterie doe persuade themselues it is, S. Peter would neuer haue said vnto Christians now baptized; VValke you in scare, during the time of this your earthely 
                     1. Pet. 1. 
                     babitation: Nor S. Paul to the same men, Phil. 2. 
                     VVorke your ovvne saluation in feare & trembling. But here perhappes, some men wil aske me, how then docth the same Apostle An obiection ansuered. in an other place say: That God hath not geuen vs the spirit of feare, but of vertue, loue, 
                     2. Ti. 1. 
                     and sobrietie? to which I answere: that our spirite is not a spirit of seruile feare: that is to liue in feare onely for dreade of punishment, Seruile feare, and the feare of children. without loue; but it is a spirit of loue, ioined with the feare of childrē, wherby they feare to offend their father,

not onely in respect of his punishment, but principally for his goodnes towardes them, and benefites bestowed vpon them. This S. Paul declareth plainly to the Romanes, Rom. 8. putting the differēce betwene seruile feare, and the feare of children; you haue not receiued againe the spirit of seruitude (saith he) in feare, but the spirit of adoption of children, vvherby vve crie to God, Abba father. He saith here to the Romanes; you haue not receiued againe the spirit of seruitude in feare; because their former spirite, (being Hovv the feare of gē
                        tiles vvas seruile. gentiles,) was onely in seruile feare: for that they honoured and adored their Idoles, not for any loue they bore vnto them, being so infinit as they were, and such not able leudnes reported of them (I meane of Iupiter, Mars, Venus, and the like;) but onely for feare of hurt from them, if they did not serue adore and honour them.
                  S. Peter also in one sentence expoandeth 1. Pet. 3. al this matter. For hauing said, timorem corum ne timueritis, feare not their feare (meaning of the seruile feare of wicked men:) he addeth presentlie, Dominum autem Christum sanctificate in cordibus vestris, &c. cum modestia, & timore, conscientiam habentes bona; 
                     That is, doe you sanctifie our Lord IESVS Christ in your hartes; hauing a good conscience, with modestie and feare. So that the spirit of seruile feare, which is grounded onely vpon respect of punishment, is forbidden vs: but the louing feare of children, is commaunded. And yet also about

this, are there two things to be noted.
                  The first, that albeit the spirite of seruile. 1. Seruile feare necessary to beginners. feare be forbiden vs, (especiallie whē we are now entered into the seruice of God;) yet is it most profitable for sinners, and for such as yet doe but beginne to serue God; for that it moueth them to repē
                     tance, & to looke about them: for which cause it is called by the wiseman, the beginning of vvisdome. And therfore, both Ionas Pro. 1. IOH. 13. Mat. 3. to the Niniuites, and S. Iohn Baptist to the Iewes, and al the prophets to sinners haue vsed to stirre vp this feare, by threatning the daungers and punishmentes which were imminent to them, if they repented not. But yet afterward, when men are cō
                     uerted to God, and doe goe forward in his seruice; they change euery day this seruile feare into loue, vntil they arriue at last, vnto that state wher of S. Iohn saith, that perfecti loue or charitie expelleth feare. Wherupon S. Austen saieth, that feare is 1. Ioh. 4. Tract. 9. in cp. 1. Ioh. the seruant, sent before to prepare place in our hartes; for his mistres, which is charitie. Who being once entered in, and perfectly placed: feare goeth out againe, & geueth place vnto the same. But where this feare neuer entereth at al, there is it impossible for charitie euer to come and dwel, saieth this holy father. 2. Seruile feare may vvel remaine also aftervvard.
                  
                  The second thing to be noted, is, that albeit this feare of punishment, be not in verie perfect men; or at leastwise, is lesse in them, then in others, as S. Iohn in the place before alleaged teacheth: yet being

ioined with loue & reuerence, (as it ought to be,) it is most profitable and necessary for al common Christians, whose life is not so perfect, nor charitie so great, as that they haue that perfection, wherof S. Iohn speaketh. This appeareth by that, that our Sauiour Christ persuaded also this feare, euen vnto his Apostles, saying; Feare you him, vvhich after he hath slaine the bodie, hath povver also to send both bodie and soule 
                     Luc. 12. Mat. 10. 
                     vnto hel fire: this I saye vnto you, feare him. The same doth S. Paul to the Corinthians, whoe were good Christians, laying downe first the iustice of God, & therupō persuading thē tò feare. Al vve (saith he) must be presēted before the tribunal seat of Christ, 
                     2. Cor. 5. 
                     to receiue, ech man his proper desertes, according as he hath done, good or euil in this life. And for that vve knovve this; vve doe persuade: he feare of our Lord vnto men. Nay (that which is more) S. Paul testifieth, that notwithstanding al his fauours receiued frō God; he retained yet him self this feare of Gods iustice, as appeareth by those wordes of his; I doe chastise my bodie, and doe bring it into 
                     1. Co. 9. 
                     seruitude, least perchance, vvhen I haue preached to others, I become a reprobate myself.
                  
                  Now then (my frend) if S. Paul stoode The conclusion. in awe of the iustice of God, notwithstā
                     ding his Apostleshipp; and that he was 1. Cor. 4. guiltie to him self of no one sinne or offence, as he protesteth: what oughtest thou to be, whose conscience remaineth guiltie of so many misdeedes and wickednes? This knovv you (saieth S. Paul) that no 
                     Ephe. 5.
                     
                     fornicatour, vncleane person, couetous man, or the like can haue inheritāce in the kingdome of Christ. And immediatly after, as though this had not bene sufficient, he addeth, for preuenting the folie of-sinners, which flatter thē selues; Let no man deceiue you vvith vaine vvordes; for the vvrath of God commeth for thes thinges, vpon the children of vnbeleef. Be not you therfore partakers of them. As if he should say; They that flatter you & say, Tush, God is merciful, and wil pardon easily al thes and like sinnes: thes mē deceiue you (saith S. Paul,) for that the wrath and vengeance of God lighteth vpon the children of vnbeleef, for thes matters: that is, it lighteth vpon thos which wil not beleeue Gods iustice, nor his threates against sinne; but presuming of his mercie doe perseuere in the same, vntil vpon the sodaine, Gods wrath doe rush vpon them, and then is it to late to amende. Wherfore (saieth he) if you be wise; be not partakers of their folie; but amend your liues presently, while you haue time. And this admonition of S. Paul shal be sufficient to ende this chapter, against al thos that refuse, or deferre their resolution of amendement, vpon vaine hope of Gods pardon or tolleration.
               
            
            
               
               THE SIXT THING THAT VSETH TO STAY AND HINDER MEN FROM MAture resolution. VVhich is the deceitful hope and persuation to doe it better or vvith more ease aftervvard. CHAPT. VII.
               THE reasons and authorities which hitherto haue bene alleaged, might seme (I doubt not) sufficient in the iudgement and censure of any reasonable man, to proue the necessitie of the resolution wherof we treate, and to remoue al impedimentes that offer them selues against the same. But yet, for that (as the wiseman saieth) he which is 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     . 18. once minded to breake with his frind, seeketh occasiōs how to doe it with some colour and shew: there be many in the world, who hauing no other excuse of A vvaine excuse. their breaking & houlding of from God; doe seeke to couer it with this pretense,

that they meane, by his grace, to amend al in time. And this time is driuen of from day to day, vntil almightie God (in whos handes onely the momentes of time are) doe shut them out of al time, and doe send them to paines eternal without time, for that they abused the singular benefite of time in this world.
               This is one of the greatest & most dangerous deceites, and yet the most ordinary and vniuersal, that the enemie of mankind doth vse towardes the children of Adam. And I dare say boldlie, that more doe perish by this deceite among Christians, thē by al his other guiles and subtilities that he vseth besides. He wel knoweth the The causes vvhy the deuil persuadeth vs to delay. force of this snare aboue al others, and therfore vrgeth it so much vnto euerie man. He considereth, better then we doe, the importance of delay, in a matter so weightie, as is our conuersion and saluation. He is not ignorant how one sinne draweth on an other; how he that is not fit to day, wil be lesse fit to morow; how custome groweth into nature; how old diseases are hardly cured; how God withdraweth his grace; how his iustice is redie to punish euery sinne; and how by delay we exasperate the same, and heape vengeance on our owne heades, as S. Paul Rom. 2. saieth. He is priuie to the vncertaintie and perils of our life; to the dangerous chaunces we passe through; to the impedimentes that wil come daily more and more, to let our conuersiō. Al this he knoweth

and wel considereth, and for that cause persuadeth so many to delay as he doeth. For being not able any longer to blind the vnderstāding of many Christians, but that they must needes see clearlie, the necessitie and vtilitie of this resolution; and that al impedimentes in the world, are but trifles, & mere deceites, which diuert them from the same: he runneth to this onely refuge, that is, to persuade men, that they deferre a litle, and that in time to come they shal haue better occasion and opportunitie to doe it, then presentely they haue.
               This, S. Augustine proued in his conuersion, as him self writeth. For that after Li. 8. confess. ca. 7. 12. he was persuaded, that no saluation could be vnto him, but by change and amendement of his life: yet the enemie held him, for a time in delaie, saying vnto him; staye yet a litle; yet deserre for a time. Therby (as he saith) to binde him more fast in the custome of sinne; vntil by the omnipotent power of Gods grace and his owne most earnest endeuour, he brake violentlie from him, crying to God; vvhie shal I longer saye to morovv, to morovv? vvhy shal I not doe it euen at this instant? And so he did, euen in his verie youth, liuing afterward, a most holie and seuere Christian life.
               But if we wil discouer yet further, the The causes vvhiche make our conuersion harder by delay. greatnes and peril of this deceit: let vs consider the causes that may let our resolution and conuersion at this present; and we shal see them al increased, and strengthened

by delaie; and consequentlie, the matter made more hard and difficult, for the time to come, then now it is. For first  (as I haue said) the continuance of sinne bringeth custome; which once hauing gotten prescription vpon vs, is so hard to remoue, as by experience we proue daily in al habites that haue taken roote within vs. Who can remoue, (for examples sake) without great difficultie, a longe custome of dronkennes, of swearing, or of any other euil habite, once setled vpon vs? Secondlie, the longer we persist in our sinful  life, the more God plucketh his grace and assistance from vs; which is the onelie meanes that maketh the waie of vertue easie vnto men, and their conuersion possible. Thirdlie, the power and kingdome  of the deuil is more established, & confirmed in vs by continuance; and so, the more hardely to be remoued. Fourthlie, the libertie of our free wil is more &  more weakened, and daunted by frequentation of sinne, though not extinguished. Fiftlie, the faculties of our mind, are more corrupted; as, the vnderstanding is more  darkened, the wil more peruerted, the appetite more disordered. Sixtlie and lastlie, our inferiour partes and passions are  more stirred vp and strengthened against the rule of reason, and harder to be repressed by continuance of time, then they were before.
               Wel then, (deare Christian brother) put al this together, and consider indifferentlie Note.
                  
with thy self, whether it be more likelie, that thou shalt rather make this resolution hereafter, thē now. Hereafter, (I say) when, by longer custome of sinne, the habite shalbe more deeply rooted in thee; the deuil in more firme possession of the; Gods helpe further of frō thee; thy minde more infected; thy iudgement more weakened; thy good desires extinguished; thy passions confirmed; thy bodie corrupted; thy strength diminished; and al thy whole common wealth more peruerted?
               We see by experiēce, that a ship which The sam. shevved by comparisons. leaketh, is more easily emptied at the beginning, then afterward. We see, that a ruinous palace, the longer it is let runne, the more charge and labour it wil require in the repairing. We see, that if a mā driue in a naile with a hammer, the more blowes he geueth vpon it, the more harde it is to plucke out againe. How then thinkest thou to commit sinne vpon sinne, and by perseuerance therin, to finde the redresse more easie hereafter, then now? It is writen among the liues of old heremites; 
                     An example. In prato spirituali sanctorum Patrum. how that on a time, an Angel shewed to one of them in the wildernes, a certaine good felow that hewed doune wood; who hauing made to him self a great burden to carie thence, laied it on his backe; and for that it was vneasie, and pressed him much, he cast it doune againe, and put a great deale more vnto it, and thē beganne to lift at it a new. But when he felt it more heauie then before; he fel into

a great rage, and added twise as much more vnto it, therby to make it lighter. Whereat when this holy mā mused much; the Angel told him, that this was a figure of them in the world; who finding it some-what vnpleasant to resist one or two vices at the beginning, doe deferre their conuersion, and doe adde twentie or fortie more vnto them, thinking to finde the matter more easie afterward.
               Saint Austen expounding the miracle of our Sauiour, in raising Lazarus from Tract. 49. in Ioh. death to life, which had bene dead now fower daies, as th' Euangelist saieth: examineth Ioh. 11. Mat. 9. Luc. 7. the cause why Christ wept, cried out, and troubled him self in spirit, before the doing of this acte, where as he raised others with greater facilitie. And he concludeth the mysterie to haue bene, for that Lazarus was now dead fower daies, and also buried: which signifieth, the fower degrees of a sinner; the first, in voluntarie delectation of sinne; the second, in consent; the third, in fulfilling it by worke; the fowerth, in continuance or custome therof; wherin whosoeuer is once buried (saieth this holy father) he is hardlie raised to life againe, without a great miracle of God, and many teares of his owne part.
               The reason hereof is, that which the wiseman saieth, Languor prolixior grauat medicum; 
                  The reason of more difficultie by delay. an old sickenes doeth trouble the phisition; Breuem autem languorem, praecidit medicus.
                  But the phisition cutteth of quicklie Eccl. 10.
                     a new or fresh disease, which hath endured but a litle time, 
                  The verie bones of an old vvicked man shalbe replenished vvith the

                  vices of his youth (saieth Iob) and they shal sleepe vvith him in the dust, vvhen he goeth to his grauc. We reade that Moyses, in part of Exo. 32. punishment to the people, that had sinned in adoring the golden calfe, broke the same in peeces, and made them drinke it. So, the vices wherein we delited during our youth, are so dispersed by custome in our bodies and bones; that when old age doth come on, we canne not ridde them at our pleasure, without great difficultie and paine. What folie then is it, to deferre our amendment vnto our old age, when we shal haue more impedimentes and difficulties by a great deale, then we haue now?
               If it seeme harde to thee to doe penance now; to fast, to praie, and to take vpon thee other afslictions, which the Church prescribed to sinners at their conuersion: how wilt thou doe it in thy old age, whē thy bodie shal haue more neede of cherishing, then of punishment? If thou find it vnpleasant to resist thy sinnes now, and to roote them out, after the continuance of two, three, or fower yeeres: what wil it be after twentie yeres more adioined vnto them? How madde a man wouldest thou A comparison. esteeme him, that trauailing on the waie, and hauing great choise of lustie strong horses, should let them al goe emptie and laie al his cariage vpon some one poore

and leane beast, that could skarse vphold him self, and much lesse sustaine so great a burden cast vpon him? And surelie no lesse vnreasonable is that man, who passing ouer idlely the lustie daies and times of his lise, reserueth al the labour & trauaile vnto impotent and feble age.
               But to let passe the folie of this deceit; tel me, (good Christiā) what ingratitude Ingratitude tovvardes God. and iniustice is this, towardes almightie God, hauing receiued so many benefites from him alredie, and expecting so great a paye as the kingdome of heauē is, for thy seruice: to appoint out, notwithstanding, the least, and last, and worst part of thy life unto his seruice; & that, wherof thou art most vncertaine, whether it shal euer be, or neuer; or whether God wil accept it whē it cōmeth or no? He is accursed by the prophet, which hauing whole and sounde cattel, doth offer vnto God the lame, or halting part therof. How much Malac. 1. more shalt thou be accursed, who hauing Comparisons. so many daies of youth, strength, and vigour; doest appoint vnto Gods seruice, onelie thy limping old age? In the law it Deu. 25. was forbidden, vnder a most seuere threate, for any man to haue two measures in his house for his neighbour: one greater to his frend, and an other lesse for other men. And yet thou art not ashamed, to vse two measures of thy life, most vnequal, in preiudice of thy Lord and God; wherby thou allotest to him, a litle, short, maimed, and vncertaine time of old age; and vnto

his enemie, the world, thou assignest the greatest, the fairest, the surest part therof.
               O deare brother, what reason is there, why God should thus be vsed at thy handes? what lawe, iustice, or equitie is this, Vniust dealing vvith God. that after thou hast serued the world, flesh, and deuil al thy youth and best daies: in the end to come and thrust thine old bones, defiled and worne out with sinne, into the dish of thy Creatour: his enemies to haue the best, and he the leauinges: his enemies the wine, and he the lies and dregges? Doest thou not remember, that Leui. 3. Num. 18. Mala. 1. he wil haue the fat and best part offered to him? Doest thou not thinke of the punishment of thos, who offered the worst part of their substance to God? Folow the counsaile then of the holie Ghost, if thou be wise, which warneth thee, in thes wordes: Be mindeful of thy Creator in the daies of thy youth, before the time of affliction come on, 
                  Eccl. 5. 
                  & before thos yeeres dravv neere, of vvhich thou shalt saie, they please me not.
               
               How many hast thou sene cut of before thine eyes, in the middest of their daies, whiles they purposed in time to change their life? How many haue come to old age it self, and yet then haue felt lesse wil of amendement then before? How many haue driuen of, euen vnto the verie houre of death, and then least of al haue remembred their owne estate; but haue died, as dum ne & sensles beastes, according to the saying of holie S. Gregorie, The sinner hath also this affliction laied
                  
                  vpon him, that vvhen he cometh to die, he forgotteth 
                  Serm. 10. de sanctis. 
                  him self, vvhich in his life time did forget God? O, how many examples are there sene herof dailie? how many worldlie men, that haue liued in sensualitie; how many great sinners, that haue passed their life in wickednes; doe end and die, as if they wēt into some place insensible, where no account, no reckening should be demanded? They take such care in their testamentes for flesh and blood, & the commodities of this world, as if they should liue stil, or should haue their part of thes vanities when they are gone. In trueth, to speake as the matter is, they die as is there were no immortalitie of the soule; and that, in verie deede, is their inward persuasion.
               But suppose now, that al this were not so, and that a man might as easilie, commodiouslie, The losse of merite. yea and as surely also, cōuert him self in old age as in youth, and that the matter were also acceptable enough to God: yet tel me, what great time is their lost in this delaie? what great treasure of merit is there omitted, which might haue bene gotten, by labour in Gods seruice? If whiles the captaine and other souldiers A comparison. did enter into a rich citie, to take the spoile, one souldier should saie, I wil staie & come in the next daie after, when al the spoile is gone; would you not thinke him both a coward, and also most vnwise? So it is, that Christ our Sauiour and al his good souldiers, tooke the spoile of this life; enriched them selues with the merites

of their labours; caried the same with them as billes of exchange, to the bancke of heauen, & there receaue paie of eternal glorie for them. And is it not great folie and peruersnes in vs, to passe ouer this life without the gayning of any meritat al? Now is the time of fight, for gaining of our crowne: now is the daie of spoile, to seise on our bootie; now is the market, to buie the kingdome of heauen; now is the time of running, to get the game & price; now is the daie of sowing, to prouide vs corne for the haruest that commeth on. If we omit this time, there is no more crowne, no more bootie, no more kingdome, no more price, no more haruest to be looked for. For as the scripture assureth vs; He that for slouth vvil not

               But if this consideration of gaine can not moue thee (gentle reader) as indeed it ought to doe, being of such importance as it is, and irreuocable when it is once past: yet weigh with thy self, what obligation The obligation and charge by delay. and charge thou drawest on thee, by euery day that thou deferrest thy conuersion, and liuest in sinne. Thou makest ech day knottes, which thou must once vndoe againe: thou heapest that together, which thou must once disperse againe: thou eatest and drinkest that hourely, which thou must once vomite vp againe: I meane, if the best fal out vnto thee: that is, if thou doe repent in time, and God doe accept

therof: for otherwise, woe be vnto thee, for that thou hoardest (as S. Paul saieth) wrath, and vengeance on thine owne Rom. 2. head. But supposing that thou receaue grace hereafter to repent, which refusest it now; yet (I say) thou must weepe, for that thou laughest now; thou must be hartilie sorie for that wherin thou delitest now; thou hast to curse the day wherein thou euer gauest consent to sinne, or els thy repentance wil doe thee no good. This thou knowest now, and this thou beleeuest now, or els thou art no Christian. How then art thou so madde, as to offend God now, both willingly, and deliberatelie; of whom thou knowest that thou must once aske pardon with teares? If thou think he wil pardone the; what ingratitude is it to offend so good a Lord? If thou thinke he wil not pardone thee; what folie can be more, then to offend a prince without hope of pardon?
               Make thine account now as thou wilt: if thou neuer doe repent and change thy life, then euery sinne thou committest, and euery day that thou liuest therein, is encrease of wrath and vengeance vpon thee in hel, as S. Paul proueth. If thou doe, by Rom. 2. Gods mercie, hereafter repent and turne (for this is not in thy handes:) then must Satisfactiō for delay. thou one day lamēt, and be waile, and doe penance for this delay, which now thou makest. Then must thou make satisfaction to Gods iustice, ether in this life, or in the life to come, for that which now thou

So that, by how much the more thou prolongest, and encreasest thy sinne; so much greater must be thy paine and sorow in satisfaction. Alto vulneri diligens & longa adhibenda est medicina: paenitentia crimine minor non sit (saith S. Cyprian.) A diligent and long medicine is to be vsed to a deepe sore; and the penance may not be lesse thē the fault. And thē he sheweth in what order it must be: with prayer, with teares, with watching, with lying on the ground, with wearing of heare cloth, and the like. It is not enough (saieth S. Austen) to Hom. vlt. & 50. ho. change our maners, and to leaue to sinne, except we make satisfaction also to God for our sinnes past, by sorowful penance, humble sighes, contrition of hart, and geuing of Almes.

               Marke here (deare brother) that this satisfaction must be both great and long, and also of necessitie. What madnes is it then for the, now to enlarge the wound, knowing that the medicine must afterwardes be so painful? What crueltie can be more against thy self, then to driue in thornes into thine owne flesh, which thou must afterward pul out againe with so many teares? wouldest thou drinke that cuppe of poisoned liquour for a litle pleasure in the taste, which would cast thee soone after into a burning feuer, torment thy bowels within thee, and other dispatche thy life, or put the in great ieoperdie?

                     ple is greatlie noted, and vrged by al thos who deferre their conuersiō; as no doubt it is, and ought to be of verie great comfort to euerie man, which findeth him self now at the last cast, and therfore commō

                  For we must vnderstand (as S. Austen wel noteth) that this was but one particular acte of Christ, which maketh no general rule; euen as we see, that a temporal Circumstā

Besides this, this acte was a special miracle reserued for the manifestation of Christ his power and glorie, at that houre vpon the Crosse. Againe, this acte was vpon a most rare confessiō made by the theefe, in that instant, when al the world forsooke Christ, and euen the Here Butt. vvil needes tring in our lady also: affirming ber to haue broken three commandementes at once, for that she defended not here sonne. God help the fond man. Apostles them selues, either douted, or lost their faith of his godhead.

                     uersion, there is required no other penance, or satisfaction at al, but onely to beleeue and to be baptised, for the gaining of heauen. But it shal not be amisse perhappes, to alleage S. Austens very wordes

vpon this matter. For thus he writeth.
                  
                     It is a remediles peril, when a man giueth him self ouer so much to vices, as he The discourse of S. Augustin vpon the theeses cō
                           uersion. Sermon. 110. de temp.
                         forgeteth that he must geue accōpt therof to God. And the reason why I am of this opinion, is; for that it is a great punishment of sinne, to haue lost the feare and memorie of the iudgement to come, &c. But (dearlie beloued) least perhappes, the newe felicitie of the beleeuing theefe on the Crosse, doe make any of you too secure and remisse: least peraduenture some of you saye in his hart, my guiltie cōscience shal not trouble nor torment me: my naughtie life shal not make me verie sadde, for that I see euen in a momēt al sinnes forgeuen vnto the theefe: we must consider first in that theefe, not onelie the shortnes of his beleefe and confession, but his deuotion; and the occasion of that time, euen when the perfection of the sust did staggar. Secondlie, shew me the faith of that theefe in thy self, and then promise to thy self his felicitie. The deuil doth put into thy head this securitie, to the end he may bring thee to perdition. And it is vnpossible to number al them, which haue perished by the shadowe of this deceitful hope. He deceiueth him self, and maketh but a ieste of his owne damnatiō, which thinketh that Gods mercie at the last daie shal help or releeue him. It is hateful before God, when a man, vpon confidence of penance in his old age, doth sinne the more freelie. The happie theefe

wherof we haue spoken (happie (I saie) not for that he laied snares in the waie, but for that he tooke hold of the waie it self in Christ,) laying handes on the praie of life; and after a strange maner, making Note this. a bootie of his owne death; he (I saie) nether did deferre the time of his saluatiō wittinglie, nether did he deceitfullte put the remedie of his estate, in the last momēt of his life; nether did he desperatlie reserue the hope of his redemotion vnto the houre of his death; nether had he any knowlege ether of religion or of Christ before that time. For if he had had; perhappes he would not haue bene the last in number among the Apostles, which was first in the king some of heauen.
                  
                  By thes wordes of S. Augustin we are admonished, (as you see) that this particular facte of Christ, maketh no general rule of remission to al men: not, for that Christ is not alwaies redie to receaue the penitent, as he promiseth, and was to receaue this theef; but, for that euerie man hath not the time or grace to repent, as he should, at the last houre, according as hath bene declared before. The general waie The general vvay. 2. Co. 11. that God proposeth to al, is that which S. Paul saith; Finis secundum opera ipsorum: The end of euil men is according to their workes. Looke how they liue, and so they die. To that effect saieth the prophet, Once God speke, and I heard thes tvvo things from his 
                     Psal. 61. 
                     mouth. Povver belongeth to God, and mercie vnta thee, (ô. Lord) for that thou vvilt render to
                     
                     euery man, according to his vvorkes. The wise man maketh this plaine, saying, the vvay of simers is paued vvith stones, and their ende is 
                     Eccl. 1. 
                     hel, darkenes, and punishmentes. Finally, S. Paul maketh this general and peremptorie cō
                     clusion: Be not deceiued, God is not mocked; looke 
                     Gal. 6. 
                     vvhat a man sovveth, and that shal be reape. He that sovveth in flesh, shal reape corruption; he that sovveth in spirit, shal reape life euerlasting. In which wordes, he doeth not onely lay downe vnto vs the general rule wherto we must trust; but also saieth further, that to persuade our selues the cōtrary therof, were to mocke & abuse God, which hath laied doune this general law vnto vs.
                  Notwith standing (as I haue said) this general law barreth not the mercie of almightie That the conuersion made at the last day is insufficient. God, from vsing a priuilege to some particular man euen at the verie last cast. But yet miserable is that soule, which placeth the ancker of his eternal wealth or woe, vpon so tyclesome a point as this is. I cal it ticlesome, for that al diuines who haue writen of this matter, doe speake verie dowtfullie of the penance or conuersiō of a man, at the last end. And albeit they doe not absolutely condemne it, in al; but doe leaue it as vncertaine vnto Gods secret iudgement: yet doe they incline to the negatiue part; and doe alleage fower reasons, for which that conuersion is to be doubted, as insufficient for a mans saluation.
                  The first reason is, for that the extreme The first reason. feare & paines of death, being (as the philosopher

saith) the most terrible, of al terrible thinges, doe not permit a man cō
                     monlie so to gather his spirites & senses at that time, as is required, for the treating of so weightie a matter with almightie God, as is our conuersion and saluation. And if we see often times, that a vetie good mā can not fixe his minde earnestlie vpon heauenlie cogitations, at such time as he is troubled with the passions of cholicue, or other sharpe diseases: how much lesse in the anguishes of death can a worldlie man doe the same, being vnacquainted with that exercise, and lodened with the guilt of many and great sinnes, and cloyed with the loue, both of his bodie, and things belonging therunto?
                  The second reason is; for that the conuersion, which a man maketh at the last The second reason. day, is not (for the most part) voluntarie, but vpon necessitie, and for feare: such as was the repentance of Semei; who hauing greeuously offended king Dauid, in time of his affliction; afterward, when he saw 2. Re. 16. him in prosperitie againe, and him self in daunger of punishment; he came, and fel doune before him, and asked him forgiuenes with teares. But yet, Dauid wel 2. Re. 19. perceiued the matter, how it stood; and therfore, albeit he spared, him for that day, wherein he would not trouble the myrth with execution of iustice: yet afterwards he gaue order, that he should be vsed 3. Reg. 2. according to his deserts.
                  The third reason is; for that the custome

of sinne, which hath continued al The third reason. the life long, can not easely be remoued vpon the instant, being growen now (as it were) into nature it self. For which cause, God saieth to euil men, by the prophet Ieremie; If an Ethiopian can change his 
                     Iere. 13. 
                     black shinne, or a leoparde his spottes, that are on his backe: then can you also doe vvel, hauing learned al dayes of your Life, to doe euil.
                  
                  The fowerth cause is; for that the actes of vertue them selues, can not be of so The fourth reason. great value with God, in that instant, as if they had bene done in time of health before. For, what great matter is it (for exā
                     ple sake) to pardō thy enemies at that time, when thou canst hurt thē no more? to geue thy goodes awaie, when thou canst vse them no more? to abandon thy concubine when thou canst keepe her no lōger? to leaue of sinne, when sinne must leaue thee? Al thes thinges are good and holie, and to be done by him, which is in that last state: but yet, they are of no such value, as other wise they wold be, by reason of this circumstāce of time, which I haue shewed.
                  Thes are the reasons whie the holie Fathers and doctors of Christ his Churh, S. Augustines speeche of the doubtful euent of final conuersion. doe speake so dowtfullie of this last conuersion: not, for any want on Gods part, but on theirs who are to doe that great acte. I might here alleage great store of authorities for this purpose: But one place of S. Austen shal serue for al. Thus then he writeth of this matter in a certaine homilie

of his. If a man haue done penance Hom. 47. est lio. 50. truelie, and do die, (being absolued from the bondes wherwith he was tied & seperated frō the bodie of Christ,) he goeth to reste. But if a man in the extreme necessitie of his sickenesse, doe desire to receiue Al tins discourse of S Augustin Bun. striketh out. penance, and doe receiue it, and doe passe hence recōciled: I confesse vnto you, that we doo not denie him that, which he demaundeth: but yet we presume not, that he goeth hence in good case. I doe not presume (I tel you plainely,) I doe not presume. A faithful man that hath liued wel, goeth awaie securelie. He that dieth the same houre he was baptised, goeth hence securelie. He that is reconciled in his health, and doeth penance, and afterward lineth wel: goeth hence securelie. But he that is reconciled, and doeth penance at the last end: I am not secure, that he goeth hence securely. Where I am secure, I doe tel you, & doe geue securitie. And where I am not secure, I may geue penance, but I can geue no securitie. But here perhappes some mā wil say to me; good priest, if you know not in what state a man goeth heace, nor can geue securitie that he is saved to whom penance was assigned at his death: teach vs (I beseech you) how we must liue after our conuersion and penāce? I say vnto you; abstaine from dronkennes, from coucupiscence of the flesh, from theft, from much babling, from immoderate laughter, frō idle wordes, for which men are to geue account in the day of

iudgement. Loe how smal thinges I haue named in your sight. But yet, al thes are Mat. 11. great matters, and pestilent to thos which commit them. Nay yet, I tel you further: a man must not onely abstaine from thes vices, and the like, after penance: but also before, when he is in health. For if he driue it of to the last ende of his life: he can not tel, whether he shalbe able to receiue penance, and to confesse his sinnes to God, and to the priest, or no. Behold the cause why I said vnto you, that a man should liue wel before penance, and after penance better.
                  
                  
                     Marke wel what I saie: and perhappes it shal be needful to expounde my meanīg Note this. more plainlie, least any man mistake me. What say I then? that this man which repenteth at the end shal be damned? I doe Here Bun. putteth in a peece of S. Aug. againe, but suppresseth his name. not say so. What then? Doe I saie he shalbe saued? no. What then doe I saie? I say, I know not: I say, I presume not; I promise not; I know not. Wilt thou deliuer thy self forth of this doubt? wilt thou escape this dangerous and vncertaine point? doe penance thē whiles thou art whole. For if thou doe penāce while thou art in health, and the last day chaunce to come vpon thee: runne presentlie to be reconciled; and so doing, thou art safe. And whie art thou safe: for that thou diddest penance in that time, wherin thou mightest haue sinned. But if thou wilt doe penance then, A notable saying. when thou canst sinne no longer; thou leauest not sinne, but sinne leaueth thee.

But you wil saie to me; how knowest thou whether God wil forgeue a mans sinnes at the last houre, or no? You say wel; I know it not. For, if I knewe that penance wold not profit a man at the last houre, I would not geue it him. Againe, if I knewe that it wold deliuer him: I wold not warne you, I would not terrifie you, as I doe. Two thinges there are in this matter: ether God pardoneth a man, doing penāce, at the houre of death; or he doeth not pardon him. Which of thes two shalbe, I know not. Wherfore, if thou be wise, take that which is certaine, & let goe the vncertaine. Hitherto are S. Austēs wordes of the dowtful case of thos, which doe penance at the last daie.
                  And here now wold I haue the careful Christian to cōsider with me, but this one comparison that I wil make. If they A comparison. that repent, and doe such penance as they may at the last daie, doe passe hence notwithstāding, in such dangerous doutfulnes as S. Augustine sheweth: what shal we thinke of al such who lacke either time or abilitie, or wil, or place, or meanes, or grace to doe any penance at al, at that houre? what shal we say of al thos, who are cut of before? which die suddenlie? which are stricken dumme, or deafe, or senseles, or frantike, as we see many are? what shal we say of thos, which are abā
                     doned by God, and left vnto vice, euen vnto the last breath in their bodie? I haue shewed before out of S. Paul, that ordinarily, 2. Co. 11.
                     
sinners die, according as they liue. So that, it is a priuilege for a wicked man, to doe penance at his death. And then, if his penance (when it is done) be so doutful, as S. Austen hath declared: what a pitiful case are al other in? I meane the more part, which repēt not at al, but die as they liued, and are forsaken of almightie God in that extremitie, according as he promiseth, when he saieth; For that I haue called Pro. 1. Iere. 35. you, and you haue refused to come; for that I haue held out my hande, and none of you would vouchsafe to looke towardes me: I wil laugh also at your destruction, when anguish and calamitie commeth on you. You shal cal vpon me, and I wil not heare; you shal rise betimes in the morning to see me, but you shal not finde me.
                  
                  It is both dreadful and lamentable which the prophet saith, of such as deferre A dreadful saying. Psal. 58.
                      their conuersion, from time to time: Conuertentur ad vesperam; & famem patientur vt canes, & circuibuat ciuitatem; 
                     They wil cōuert them selues to God at the euening, & then shal they suffer hungar, as dogges; and shal runne about the citie.The wordes that goe immediatly before, and doe immediatly ensue after, doe expresse more plainly the greatnes of this threate. For before, the verse is: Attend (o Lord) to visit al nations; take no mercie vpon al thos that vvorke iniquitie. That is, which worke iniquitie vnto the end without change, for otherwise the wish were hard. And

immediatly after enseweth; Thes men shal speake vvith their mouth, and a svvord shal be in their lippes; for vvho hath heard them? and thou (ô Lord) shalt skoffe at them. That is to say, thes men in their last extremety shal cry for help; and their crie shal be as sharp to pearse mēs eares, as a sword is; & yet notwithstāding, no mā shal heare thē. And thou (ô Lord) which onely canst help them, shalt be so farre of from hearing or pitying their case, as thou shalt also laugh at their miserie and destruction. By al which is signified, the great calamitie of such as deferre their conuersion vnto the last day, expressed by three circumstances, in the former sentence alleaged.
                  For first he saith, they vvil turne at the euening; that is, at the houre of death. For as Turning to God at the euening. the euening is the end of the day, and the beginning of night: euen so is this time, the end of light, and the beginning of al darkenes vnto the wicked. In which sense Christ said; I must vvorke the vvorkes of him 
                     Ioh. 9. 
                     that sent me, vvhiles the day lasteth; for night vvil come on, vvhen no man can vvorke more. At this time then; that is, at this euening, in this twy light, betwene day and darkenes, when the pleasant brightnes, and heate of al sunne beames is past: the brightnes (I meane) of honour, of vainglorie, and of worldlie pompe is consumed: when the heat of concupiscence, of carnal loue, of delicate pleasures is quenshed; when the beautiful sommer day of

this life is ended, and the boisterous winter night of death draweth on: (thē saieth the prophet) wil the wicked man beginne of force to turne vnto God; then wil he (forsooth) repent; then wil he resolue him self, and make his conuersion.
                  But what? shal this be accepted? You haue heard the prophets request to God, Final turning to God not accepted. 
                     Non miserearis; doe not take mercie on them. Not, for that the prophet wisheth God to be vnmerciful; but for that he wel knew Gods immutable iustice towardes such kinde of men. Whos miserie, in this extremitie, he expresseth further, by saying, they shal suffer hungar as dogges; which is, as if he should haue saied: euen as dogges, when they are hungrie, are rauenous, & doe seeke by al meanes for meate, be it neuer so homelie: and wil refuse nothing that is offered, but wil deuoure al thos things most gredilie, which they contemned whiles their bellies were ful: so thes men that would not heare of penance, while they were in health, wil now admit any thing, and make strange of nothing. Now (I say) when they can liue no longer, wil they promise any paines: what praiers you wil; what fasting you please; what almes deedes you can desire; what austeritie soeuer you can imagine. They wil promise it, (I say) vpon conditiō they might now haue life againe; vpon condition that the day might be prolonged vnto them; albeit, if almightie God should graunt them their request, in

this also, (as many times he doeth,) they would performe no one point therof; but would be as careles, as euer they were before: yet for the present, you shal see thē as hungrie as dogges, saieth the prophet, most redie to deuour any thing, that may be deuised, for their saluation.
                  And not contented with this, the same prophet addeth yet a further clause of miserie. A maruelous circumstance of miserie for thē that deserre their cōuersion to the euil. And that is, that they shal circuite or runne about the cilic; euen as dogges doe, when they are hungrie, putting in their heades at eucry dore for releef, though it be with great danger to be beaten out againe. This expresseth an vnspeakable distresse and calamitie of wicked men, at the last day; when they shal circuite, and runne about the whole citie of God, both in heauen, and earth, to seeke help, and shal finde none. When they shal crie, with sighes and grones, as pearsing as a sword, and yet shal not be heard. For, whether wil they turne them selues in this distresse? vnto their worldly wealth, power, or riches? alas, they are gone; and the scripture saieth, riches shal not profit in the day of reuenge. Wil they turne vnto their carnal Pro. 11. frends? But what comfort can they geue, besides onely weeping, and comfortles mourning? Wil they aske helpe of the Saints in heauen to pray for them in this instant? It is good, surely, so to doe: but yet, they can not chuse but remember what is writen, The sainies shal reioise in glorie; exultation 
                     Psa. 145. 
                     shalbe in their throtes; and tvvo edged
                     
                     svvordes in their handes, to take reuenge vpon nations, and increpations vpon people; to binde kings in fetters, and noble men in manacles of iron; to execute vpon them the prescript iudgement of God; and this is the glorie of al bis saintes. Their onely refuge thē must be vnto God, who in deed is the onely sure refuge of al; but yet in this case, the prophet saieth here, that he shal not heare them: but rather contemne, and laugh at their misery. Not, that he is contrarie to his promise of Pro. 1. Psa. 58. reccauing a finner, at what time soeuer he repēteth, and turneth from his sinne: but, for that this turning at the last day, is not commonly true repentance and conuersion, for the causes before rehearsed.
                  To conclude then this matter of delay; what wise man is ther in the world, who The cōclusion, vvhat danger is in delay. reading this, wil not feare the deferring of his conuersion, though it were but for one day? Who doeth know whether this shalbe the last day, or no, that euer God wil cal him? God saith; I called, and you refused to come; I held out my hand, and you 
                     Pro. 1. 
                     vvold not looke tovvardes me; and therfore vvil I forsake you, in your extremitie. He doth not say, how many times, or how long he did cal and hold out his hand. God saith, I stand at the dore, and knocke; but he saith not, how often he doth that, or how many knockes he geueth. Againe, he said of wicked Iezabel, the faigned prophetesse Apoc. 2. in the Apocalips; I haue geuen her time to due penance, and she vvold not, and therfore shal she perish: but he saieth not, how

long this time of repentance endured. We read of wonderful examples herin. HEROD the father, had a cal geuen him, and 1. HEROD the first. that a lowd one, when Iohn baptist was sent vnto him, and when his hart was so farre touched, as he willingly heard him, and folowed his counsaile in many thinges, Marc. 6. as one Euangelist noteth. But yet, because he deferred the matter, and tooke 2. HEROD the second. Luc. 11. Luc. 23. Mat. 14. not time, when it was offered: he was cast of againe, and his last doings made worse then his former. HEROD tetrarche the sonne, had a cal also, when he felt that desire to see Christ, & some miracle done by him: but, for that he answered not vnto the cal, it did him no good, but rather much hurt. What a great knocke, had PILATE geuen him at his hart, if he had 3. PILATE. bene so fortunate, as to haue opened the dore presently, when he was made to vnderstand the innocencie of Christ; as appeareth Plat. 27. by washing his handes in testimonie therof, and his wife also sent vnto him an admonition about the same? No 4. AGRIPPA. Act. 26. lesse knocke had king AGRIPPA at his dore, when he cried out, vpon the hearing of S. Paul: O Paul, thou persuadest me a litle, to be a Christian. But, because he deferred the matter, this motion passed away againe.
                  Twise happie had PHARAO bene, if he 5. PHARAO. had resolued him self presently, vpon that motion that he felt, when he cried to Exod. 9. Act. 24 6. FELIX. Moyses, I haue sinned, and God is iust. But by delay, he became worse then euer he was before. S. Luke reporteth how FELIX, the

gouernour of Ieurie for the Romanes, conferred secretly oftentimes with Saint Paul, that was his prisonner; and heard of him the faith in Christ, wherwith he was greatly moued; especially at one time, when Paul disputed of Gods iustice, and of the day of iudgement, whereat FELIX trembled. But yet, he deferred this resolution, willing Paul to depart, and to come againe an other time: and so the matter by dilation came to no effect. How many men doe perish daily, some cut of by death, some left by God, and geuen ouer to a reprobate sense; which might haue saued them selues, if they had not deserred their conuersion from day to day; but had made their resolution presently, when they felte God to cal within their hartes.
                  Almightie God is ready and bountiful to knocke and cal; but yet, he bindeth him The dāger of passing the day of our vocation. self to no time or space, but commeth and goeth at his pleasure. And they who take not their times when they are offered, are excuseles before his iustice, and doe not know whether euer it shalbe offered to them againe, or no; for that, this thing is ouelie in the wil and knowledge of Exo. 33. God alone; who taketh mercie where it pleaseth him best, and is bound to none. Rom. 9. And when the prefixed time of calling is once past, woe be vnto that partie. For a thowsand worldes wil not purchase it againe. Christ sheweth wonderfully the importāce of this matter; when, entering

into Ierusalē vpon Palme-sonday, amidest al the mirth & glorie of his receiuing, he could not chuse but weepe vpō that citie, considering (as most men thinke) that this was the last day of mercie and vocation, that euer should be vsed to the same. And therfore he said with teares; O Ierusalem, if thou knevvest also, thos thinges vvhich appertaine 
                     Luc. 21. 
                     to thy peace, euen in this thy day! but novv thes thinges are hidden from thee. As if he had said; if thow knewest (Ierusalem) as wel as I doe, what mercie is offered vnto thee, euen this day, which is the last day, that euer such offer shalbe made; thou wouldest presentlie accept therof. But now this secret iudgement of my father is hidden from thee; and therfore thou makest litle account therof, vntil thy destruction shal come suddenlie vpon thee; as soone after it did.
                  By this now may be considered, the great reason of the wise mans exhortation: Forslovv not to turne to God; nor doe thou deserre it from day to day; for his vvrath vvil 
                     Eccl. 5. 
                     come vpon the, on the suddain, and in time of reuenge it vvil destroy thee. It may be sene also vpon what great cause, S. Paul exhorted the Hebrewes so vehemently, Dum cognominatur 
                     Heb. 3. 
                     hodie; to accept of grace, euē whiles that verie day endured; and not to let passe the occasion offered. Which euery man applying to him self, should folow, in The honre of our calling not to be omitted. obeing the motions of Gods spirit within him, and accepting of Gods vocation without delay; considering what a greeuous

sinne it is, to resist the Holy Ghost. Euery man ought (I say) when he feeleth Act. 7. a good motiō in his hart, to thincke with him self; now God knocketh at my doore; if I open presently, he wil enter, and Apoc. 3. dwel within me. But if I deferre it vntil to morow, I know not whether he wil knocke againe, or no. Euery man ought to remember stil that saying of the prophet, touching Gods spirit: Hodie si vocem eins auaieritis, 
                     Psal. 94. 
                     nolite obdurare corda vestra; 
                     if you chaunce to heare his voice calling you to day, doe not harden your hartes, but presently yelde vnto him.
                  
                  Alas (deare brother) what hope of gaine hast thou by this perilous dilation, The srutles indeuours of sinners at the last day. which thou makest? Thy account is increased therby, as before. I haue declared; thy debt of satisfaction is made more greeuous; thy enemie more strōg; thy self more feeble; thy difficulties of conuersion multiplied. What hast thou then to with hold thee one day from resolutiō? The gaining perhappes of a litle time in vanitie? But I haue proued to thee before, how this time is not gained but lost, being spent without merit, which is in deed the onely true gaine of time. If it seeme pleasant to thee for the present: yet remember what the prophet saieth, Iuxta ast dies perditionis, & 
                     Deu. 32. 
                     adcsse fistina a temporal; 
                     The day of perdition is at hand, and the times of destruction make haste to come on. Which day being once come; I maruaile what hope thou wilt conceiue. Doest thou thinke (perchance)

to crie, Peccaui? It shalbe wel truely, if thou canst doe it: but yet, thou knowest, that Pharao did so, and auailed nothing. Exod. 9. Doest thou intend to make a good testamēt, and to be liberal in almes deeds, at that time? This (no doubt) is very commendable; but yet thou must remember also, that the virgins which filled their lampes, only at the verie instant of their enterance to the mariage, were shut out, and vtterly reiected by Christ. Dost thou Mat. 25. thinke to weepe & mourne, and to moue thy iudge with teares, at that instant? first, this is not in thy hādes to doe at thy pleasure; and yet thou must consider also, that Esau found no place of penance, though he sought it with teares, as S. Paul wel noteth. Doest thou meane to haue many Heb. 12. good purposes, to make great promises & vowes in that distresse? Cal to minde the case of Antiochus in his extremities; what promises of good deedes, what vowes 2. Mac. 9. of vertuous life made he to God, vpō condition he might escape, and yet preuailed he nothing therby. Al this is spoken, not to put them in despaire which are now in thos last calamities, but to dissuade others from falling into the same; assuring thee (gentle reader) that the prophet said not without a cause; Seeke vnto God vvhile he may be sound, cal vpon him vvhile 
                     Esa. 55. 
                     he is neare at hand. Now is the time acceptable, now is the day of saluation, saieth 2. Co. 6. S. Paul. Now is God to be found, & neare at hand to embrace al them that truelie

turne vnto him, and make firme resolution of vertuous life hereafter. If we deferre this time; we haue no warrant that he wil ether cal vs, or receiue vs hereafter; but rather many threates to the contrarie, as hath bene shewed. Wherfore I wil ende with this one sentence of S. Augustine; Tract. 33. in Ioh. that he is both a careles & most graceles man, which, knowing al this, wil venture notwithstanding the eternitie of his saluation and damnation, vpon the doubtful euent of his final repentance.
               
            
            
               
               OF THREE OTHER LETTES AND IMPEDIMENTES THAT HINDER men from resolution, to vvit. Slothfulnes; careles negligence; and hardnes of hart, vtterly cōtemning al things: vvith the conclusion of this first booke. CHAPT. VIII.
               BESIDES al other impedimētes lettes and hinderances which hitherto haue bene named & recounted, there remaine yet diuers other to be found, if a mā could examine the particular consciences of al such as doe not resolue. But thes three here mentioned, and to be handeled in this chapter, are so publique and knowen: as I may not passe them ouer, without discouering the same; for that, many times men are sicke and euil affected within, and yet know not their owne diseases; the onely

declaration wherof (to such as are desirous of their oune health) is sufficient to diuert the danger of the sickenes.
               
                  Of Sloth.
                  
                     FIRST THEN, the impediment of slouth, is a great and ordinary let of resolution OF Sloth. the first part. to many men; but especially in idle and delicate people, whos life hath bene in al case and rest; and therfore doe persuade themselues, that they can take no paines, nor abide anie hardnes, though neuer so faine they would. Of which kind of persons, S. Paul saieth, that nise 1. Co. 6. people shal not inherite the kingdome of heauen: Thes folkes doe proceede in this order. They wil confesse to be true, so much and a great deale more then is said before: and that they would also gladlie for their partes put the same in execution, but that they can not. Their bodies may not beare it; they can not fast; they can not watch; they can not praie. They can not leaue their disportes, recreations, and Excuses of nise people. merie companions: they should die presently (as they saie) with melanchely, if they did it; yet in their hartes they desire (forsooth,) that they could doe the same; which seing they can not, no doubt (say they) but God wil accept our good desires, & pardon vs in the rest. But let them hearken a litle, what the scripture saith hereof; Desires do kil the slothful man (saith Pro. 21. Salomon:) his handes vvil not fal to any
                     
                     vvorke: al the daie long he coucteth and desireth: but he that is iust, vvil doe, and vvil not cease. Take the slothful and vnprofitable seruant (saith Christ) and fling him into vtter darkenes, vvhere shalbe vveeping and gnashing of teeth. 
                     Mat. 25. 
                     And when he passed by the way and founde a figge tree with leaues, without fruit (which signified desires without Mat. 21. workes:) he gaue it presentlie an euerlasting curse. Finallie, the prophet Dauid detesteth thos men, and saith also, they are detested of God, qui in labore hominū non sunt, 
                     Psa. 72. which are not in the labours of men.
                  Of this fountaine of sloth, do proceed many effectes, that hinder the slothful frō 
                     Fovver effectes of slouth. al good resolution. And the first is, a certaine heauines, and sleepie drowsines  towardes al goodnes, according as the DROVSINES. Pro. 19. Ephe. 5. Marc. 13. Mat. 24. & 25. scripture saith; pigredo immittit soporem, sloth doth bring drousines. For which cause S. Paule saith, surge qui dormis, arise thou which art a sleepe: and Christ crieth out so often, videte, vigilate, looke about you, and watch. You shal see many men in the world, with whom if you talke of a cowe or a calfe, of a fat oxe, of a peece of groūd, or the like, they can both heare and talke willinglie and freshly. But if you reason with them of their saluation, and of their inheritance in the kingdome of heauen: they answere not at al, but wil heare, as Prou. 6. & 24. if they were in a dreame. Of thes persons then saith the wise man; how long wilt thou sleepe, ô slouthful felow? when wilt thou arise out of thy dreame? A litle yet

wilt thou sleepe; a litle longer wilt thou slumber; a litle wilt thou close thy handes together, and take rest: and so, pouertie shal hasten vpon thee as a run ning poste, and beggarie as an armed man shal take & possesse thee.
                  
                  The second effect of slouth, is a certaine  fond feare of paines and labour, and FEARE. of casting dowtes where none be, according as the scripture saith, pigrum deiicit timor, feare discourageth the slothful man. Pro. 19. And the prophet saith of the like, they shake for feare vvhere there is no feare. Thes Psa. 52. men doe frame vnto them selues strange imaginations of the seruice of almightie God, and of verie dangerous euentes, if they should imbrace and folow the same. One saith; if I should Bun. here striketh out the first tvvo mēbers of fusting & praying. fast much, it would without dowte corrupt my blood. An other saith, if I should pray, and stand bareheaded long; I should die most certainly with rheume. A third saieth, if I should kepe account of al my sinnes, to confesse them; it would quicklie kil me with sadnes. And yet al this is nothing els but slouth, as the scripture testifieth in thes wordes; Dicit piger, leo est foris; in 
                     Pro. 21. 
                     medio platearum occidendus sum. 
                     The slouthful man saith (sitting stil in his house) ther is a Lion without; if I should goe out of dores to labour, I should certainly be slaine in the middest of the streetes.
                  
                  A third effect of sloth is, pusillanimitie and faintnes of hart; wherby the slouthful  man is ouerthrowen, and discouraged

by euery litle contrarietie or difficultie Pusillanimitie. which he findeth in vertue, or which he imagineth to finde therin. Which the scripture signifieth, when it saith, inlapide luteo lapidatus est piger, the slouthful man, is stoned Eccl. 22. to death with a stone of durt; that is, he is ouerthrowne with a difficultie of no importance. Againe: De stercore boum lapidatus est piger, the slouthful man is stoned dead with the dung of oxen: which commonly is such a substance, as hardly can doe any hurt.
                  A fowerth effect of slouth is, idle lazines: which we see in many men that 4. Lasines. wil take and consult of this & that, about their amendement, but wil execute nothing. Which is most fitlie expressed by the Holie Ghost in thes wordes; Sieut ostium vertitur in cardine suo, it a piger in lectulo suo. 
                     Pro. 26. 
                      As a dore is tossed in and out vpon his hingels, so is a slothful man, lying lazelie vpon his bedde. And againe; vult & non 
                     Pro. 13. 
                     vult piger; A slothful man wil and wil not; that is, he turneth him self to and from in his bedde, & betwene willing and nilling he doth nothing. And yet further, in an other place the scripture describeth this lazinesse, saying, the slothful man putteth his handes vnder his girdle, and vvil not vouchsase to lift them vp to his mouth, for that it is painful. 
                     Pro. 19.
                  
                  Al thes and many more are the effectes of slothe; but thes fower especiallie, haue I thought good to touch in this place; for that, they let and hinder greatlie this

resolution which we talke of. For he that liueth in a slumber, & wil not heare, or attend to any thing that is said of the life to come; and besides this, imagineth feareful matters in the same; and thirdlie, is throwen downe by euerie litle blocke, that he findeth in the way; and lastlie, is so lazie, as he can beare no labour at al: this man (I say) is past hope, to be gained to any such purpose as we speake of.
                  
                     TO REMOVE therfore this impediment; this forte of men ought to lay before MEANES to remoue Sloth. their eies, the labours of our Sauiour Christ, and of his Saintes; the exhortatiōs they vsed to other men, to take like paines; the threates made in scripture against them which labour not; the condition of our present warfare, that requireth trauaile; the crowne prepared for it; and the misery ensewing vpon idle and lazie people. And finally, if they can not beare the See before. Chap 2. labour of vertuous life, which in deed is accompanied with so many consolations, as it may not rightfullie be called a labour: how wil they abide the labour and tormentes of the damned life to come, which must be both intollerable & euerlasting vnto them?
                  Saint Paul saieth of him self & others, 
                        Thess. 3. The labours of Sainctas to the Thessalonians; we did not eate our bread of free cost when we were with you: but did worke in labour and wearinesse, both day and night, therby to geue you an example of imitation; denouncing further vnto you, that if any man would

not worke, he should not eate. Christ in his parable, went forth into the streetes twise in one day, & til reprehended greeuouslie thos that stoode idle, saing;

                     Mat. 20. 
                     hic statis tota die otio ī?
                      Why doe ye stād here al the day idle, and doing nothing? I am a vine, (saieth Christ) & my father is a husband Ioh. 15. man; euery branche that beareth not fruit in me, my father wil cut of, and cast into the fire. And in an other place: Cut doune the vnprofitable tree; vvhy doth it stand 
                     Lac. 13. 
                     here, and occupie the ground for nothing? And againe: the king dome of heauen is subiect to force; 
                     Mat. 11. 
                     and men doe gaine it by violence and labour. For which cause, the wise man also saieth: Eccl. 9. 
                     what soeuer thy hand can doe in this life, doe it instantlie: for after this, there is neither time, nor reasō, nor wisdome, nor knowledge, that we can employe to any profite. And againe the same wise man Prou. 10. saieth: The lazie hande vvorketh beggarie to it self, but the industrious and ualiant hande heapeth vp great riches. And yet further to the Prou. 20. same effect; The slouthful man vvil not sovv in the vvinter, for that it is cold; and therfore he shal beggein the sommer, and no man shal take pitie of him.
                  
                  Al this pertaineth to shew, how that this life is a time of labour, and not of The conclusion. idlenes; and is appointed vnto vs for the gaining of heauē. It is the Market, wherin we must buye; the batail, wherin we must fight and gaine our crowne; the winter, wherin we must sowe; the day of labour, wherin we must sweate and gaine

our pennie. And he that passeth ouer lazilie this day (as the most part of mē doe) must suffer eternal pouertie and neede, in the long night to come; as in the first part C. 2. 3. pa. 11. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . of this booke more at large hath bene declared. Wherfore, the wise man (or rather the Holie Ghost by his mouth) geueth Prou. 6. ech one of vs, a most vehement admonition and exhortation, in thes wordes. Runne about; make haste; stirre vp thy frind; geue no sleepe vnto thy eies; let not thine eye liddes slumber; skippe out as a doe from the handes of him that holdeth her, and as a bird out of the hād of the fouler. Goe vnto the Emmet (thou slothful man,) and consider ber doinges, and learne to be vvise. She hauing no guide, teacher, or captaine, prouideth meate for her self in the sommer, & gathereth together in the haruest, that vvhich maye serue her to feed vpon in the vvinter. By which wordes we are admonished, in what order we ought to behaue our selues in this life, and how diligēt & careful we should be in doing of al good workes, (as S. Paul also teatheth): considering, that Coloss. 1. Rom. 12. Gala. 6. as the Emmet laboureth most carnestlie in haruest time, to lay vp for the winter to come: so should we do for the next world: and that, sloth falnes to this effect, is the greatest and most dangerous-let that' may be. For, as the Emmet should die in the winter most certainlie for hunger, if she should liue idlelie in the sommer: so without al doute they are to suffer extreme neede and miserie in the world to come, who now for sloth doe omit to labour.
               
               
                  
                  Of Negligence.
                  
                     THE SECOND impediment is called by me, in the title of this chapter, Negligence. But I doe vnderstand therby, a OF NEGligence, the secōd part. further matter then commonly this word importeth. For I doe comprehend vnder the name of negligent, al careles and dissolute people, which take to hart nothing that pertaineth vnto God or godlines, but onelie attend to worldly affaires, making their saluation the least parte of their cogitations. And vnder this kinde of negligence is contained, both Epicurisme, (as Epicurisme, or life of Epicures. Phil. 3. Rom. 16.
                      S. Paul noted in some Christians of his daies, who beganne onelie to attend to eate and drinke, and to make their bellies their God, as our Christians now doe:) and also a secret kinde of Atheisme, or denying God; which is, to denie him, not in wordes, but in life and behauiour, as S. Paul expoundeth it. For albeit thes men Tit. 1. of whom I speake, doe in wordes confesse God, and professe them selues to be as good Christians as the rest: yet secretlie in deed they doe not beleeue God, as their life and doings doe declare. Which thing holy scripture discouereth plainlie, when it saith, vae dissolutis corde, qui non credunt Deo; 
                     Eccl. 2. 
                     woe be vnto the dissolute and careles in hart, who doe not beleeue God. That is, albeit they professe that they beleeue and trust in him; yet by their dissolute and careles doings, they testifie, that in their hartes

they beleeue him not; for that, they haue nether care nor cogitation of matters pertaining to him.
                  This kinde of men, are thos which the Of careles Atheistes. Deu. 22.
                      scripture noteth, & detesteth for plowing with an oxe and an Asse together; for sowing their ground with mingled seede; for wearing apparel of linsie wolsie; that is, made of flaxe and wool together. Thes are they of whom Christ saith in the reuelations, I vvould thou vvere ether colde or hoate. But for that thou art luke vvarme, and 
                     Apoc. 3. 
                     netber cold nor hoate, therfore vvil I beginne to vomite thee out of my mouth. Thes are they who can accorde al religions together, and take vp al controuersies, by onely saying; that, ether they are differences of smal importance, or els that they appertaine onelie to learned men to thinke vpon, and not vnto them. Thes are they who can applie them selues to anie companie, to any time, to any princes pleasure, for matters of life to come. Thes men forbid al talke of spirite, religion, or deuotion in their presence; onelie they wil haue men eate, drinke, and be merie with them; tel newes of the courte and affaires abrode; sing, daunce, laugh, and plaie at cardes; and so passe ouer this life in lesse consideration of God, then doe the very heathens. And hath not holie writ great reason then (deare brother) in saying, that thes men in their hartes and workes are in deede verie Atheistes? yes surelie. And it may be proued by many

rules of our Sauiour him self. As for exā
                     ple; this is one rule set downe by him self; By their fruites yee shal knovv them. For Luc. 6. such as the tree is within, such is the fruit which that tree sendeth forth. Againe, the mouth speaketh frō the abundance of the hart; 
                     Math. 12. and consequentlie, seing thes mens talke is nothing but of worldlie vanities: it is an euident signe, there is nothing in their hart, but that. And then it foloweth also by a third rule, vvhere the treasure is, there is 
                     Math. 6. 
                     the hart; and so consequently, seing their hartes are onelie set vpon the world, the world is their onelie treasure, and not God; and ther vpon are very Atheistes.
                  This impediment (deare Christian Tvvo causes of Atheisme at this daie. brother) reacheth both farre and wide at this daie; and infinite are the people who are intangled therwith; and the causes therof are two especiallie. The This Bun. lesueth out. first is, deuision schisme and heresie, in matters of our faith; which by raising many doubtes and questions, and by contentious quarreling which it maintaineth, wearieth out a mans wit, and in the end bringeth him to care for no part, but rather to contemne al. The second is, inordinate loue of the world; which bringeth men to hate God, and to conceiue enemitie against him, as the Apostle saith; and therfore, no maruaile 1. Ioh. 2. though indeed they nether beleeue, nor delite in him. And of al other men thes are the hardest to be reclaymed, and brought to any resolution of amendemēt, for that they are insensible; and besides

that, doe also flie al meanes, wherby they may be cured. For, as there were final A comparison. hope to be conceiued of that patiēt, which being greuouslie sicke, should nether feele his disease, nor beleeue that he were distē
                     pered, nor abide to heare of phisick, or phisition, nor accept of anie counsail that should be offered, nor admit any talke or consultation about his curing: so thes men are in more dangerous estate then anie other, for that, they know not their owne danger; but persuading them selues to be more wise then their neighbours, doe remoue from their cogitations al things, wherby their health might be procured.
                  THE ONELIE waie to doe thes men THE vvaie to cure careles men. good, (if there be any waie at al) is, to make them know that they are sicke, and in great daunger; which in our case may be done best (as it seemeth to me) by geuing them to vnderstand, how farre they are of, from any one peece of true Christianitie; and consequentlie, from al hope of saluation that may be had therby. God requireth at our handes, that we should Deut. 6. Mat. 22. Luc. 10. loue him and serue him, vvith al our hart, vvith al our soule, and vvith al our strength. Thes are the prescript wordes of almightie God, set downe both in the old and new law. And how farre (I praye the) are thes careles men short of this, who emploie not the halfe of their hart, nor the halfe of their soule, nor the halfe of their strength in Gods seruice; nay, not

the least part therof? God requireth at our handes, that we should make his lawes Deut. 6. & 11. Iohn. I. and preceptes our studie and cogitation; that we should thinke of thē continuallie, and meditate vpon them both day and night, at home and abrode, early and late, when we go to bedde, and when we rise in the morning: this is his commandemēt, and there is no dispensation therin. But how farre are thes men from this, which bestowe not the third parte of their thoughtes vpon this matter, no not the hundreth part, nor scarse once in a yeare do talke therof? Can thes mē saie, they are Christians, or that they beleeue in IESVS, our Saueour?
                  Christ making the estimate of things in this life, pronounced this sentence; Vnum est necessarium, one onelie thing is Luc. 10. Antitheses betvvē true Christians and careles vvorldlinges. 1. Iohn. 2. necessarie, or of necessitie in this world; meaning therby, the diligent and careful seruice of God. Thes mē finde many things necessarie besides this one thing, and this nothing necessarie at al. How farre doe they differ then in iudgement from their Sauiour Christ? Christes Apostle saith; that a Christian, must nether loue the vvorld, nor any thing in the vvorld. Thes men loue nothing els, but that which is of the world. He saith, That vvho soeuer is a frend to the vvorld, is an enemie to Christ. Thes men are enemies to who soeuer is not a frend to the world. How then can thes men holde of Christ? Christ saith, vve should praye stil. 
                     Luc. 18. Ephe. 5. Thes men praye neuer. Christs Apostle

saith, that couetousnes, vncleanesse, or scurrilitie, should not be so much as once named Luc. 21. Mat. 24. Mich. 6. Rom. 11. Rom. 12. Mat. 10. among Christians: thes men haue no other but such talke. Finally, the whole course and canon of scripture runneth, that Christiās should be, attenti, vigilantes, soliciti, instantes, feruentes, perseuerantes, sine intermissione: That is, attent, vigilant, careful, instant, feruent, and perseuerant without intermission, in the seruice of their God. But thes men haue no one of thes pointes, nor any one degree therof, but in euery one the cleane cōtrarie. For they are nether attent to thos things which appertaine vnto God, nor vigilant, nor solicitous, nor careful; and much lesse, instant and feruent; and least of al, perseuerant without intermission; for that they neuer beginne. But on the contrarie side, they are careles, negligent, lumpish, remisle, key cold, peruerse, contemning and despising, yea lothing and abhorring al matters that appertaine to the mortifiing of them selues, and to the true seruice of God. What parte haue thes men then in the lot and portion of Christians, besides onely the bare name, which profiteth nothing?
                  And this is sufficiēt to shew, how great and dangerous an impediment this careles, The dager of a careles man. senseles, and supine negligence is, against the resolutiō wherof we entreate. For if Christ require to the perfection of this resolution, that whosoeuer once espieth Mat. 13. out the treasure hidden in the field,

(which is the kingdome of heauen, and the right way to gaine it) he should presently goe and sel al that he hath, and buie that field: that is to say, that he should preferre the pursute of this kingdome of heauen, before al the commodities of this life whatsoeuer; and rather venture them al, then to omit this treasure. If Christ (I say) require this, as he doeth; when wil thes men euer be brought to this point, who wil not geue the least parte of their goodes to purchase that field; nor goe forth of the dores to treate the bying therof, nor wil so much as thinke or talke of the same, nor allow of him which shal offer the meanes & waies to compasse it?
                  Wherfore, whosoeuer findeth him self in this perilous disease, I would counsaile The conclusion. him to reade some chapters of the first part of this booke; especially the third & fift, entreating of the causes for which we were sent into this world; as also of the account, which we must yeld to God, of our time here spēt; & he shal there vnderstand (I dout not) the errour & dāger he standeth in, by this damnable negligence wherein he sleepeth, attēding onely to thos things which are meere vanities, and for which he came not into this world; and passing ouer other matters, without care or cogitation, which notwithstanding are only of importance, and most necessary for al men to employ their whole care and study in.
               
               
                  
                  Of hardnes of hart.
                  
                     THE THIRD and last impedimēt, that I purpose to handle in this booke, is a certaine HARDNES of hart, the 3. part. affection, or euil disposition in some men, called by the scriptures, Hardnes of harte, or in other wordes, obstination & obstinacie of minde. Wherby a man is setled in resolution, neuer to yeld from the state of sinne wherein he liueth, whatsoeuer shal or may be said against the same. And I haue reserued this impediment, for the last place in this booke; for that, it is the last, and worst of al other impedimentes discouered before, containing al the euil in it self that any of th' other before rehearsed haue; and adding to the same besides, a most wilful and malitious resolution of sinne, quite cōtrarie to that resolution, which we so much endeuour to induce men vnto.
                  This hardnes of hart hath diuerse degrees in diuers men, and in some much Tvvo degrees of hardnes of hart. more greeuous & perilous then in other. For some are arriued to that highe and and cheefe obduration, which I named before; in such sort, as albeit they wel know that they are amisse, yet for some worldlie respect or other, they wil not yeeld, nor chaunge their course, doe, saie, or proue what you wil or can. Such was the obduration of Pilate; who albeit he Mat. 27. wel knew that the cōdemned our Sauiour Christ wrongfullie: yet, not to leese the

fauour of the Iewes, or incurre displeasure with his prince; he proceeded, and gaue that most wicked sentence against him. This also was the obduration of Pharao; who, though he saw the miracles Exod. 6. 7. 8. of Moyses and Aaron, and felt the strong hand of God vpon his kingdome: yet, not to seeme to be ouercome by such simple people as they were; nor that men should thinke he would be enforced by any meanes to relent: he perseuered stil in his wilful wickednes, vntil his last and vtter destruction came vpon him. This hardnes of hart was also in king Agrippa, and in Act. 26. 27. Foelix, gouernour of Ieurie; who, though in their owne consciences they thought that S. Paul spake trueth vnto them; yet, not to hazard their credit in the world, they continued stil, and perished in their owne vanities. And commonly this obduration is in al persecutors of vertue, and Persecutors. of vertuous men: whom, albeit they see euidentlie to be innocent, and to haue equitie on their side; yet, to maintaine their estate, credite, and fauour in the world; they persist, without ether mercie or release, vntil God cut them of, in the middest of their malice and furious cogitations.
                  Others ther are, who haue not this A second degree of abduratiō. obduration in so high a degree, as to persist in wickednes directly against their owne knowledge; but yet they haue it in an other sort: for that, they are setled in firme purpose to folow the trade, which

alredie they haue begonne; and wil not vnderstand the dangers therof; but doe seeke rather meanes to persuade thē selues and quiet their consciences therin: and nothing is so offensiue vnto them, as to heare any thing against the same. Of the; men holie Iob faith: Dixerunt Dco, recede a nobis, & scientiam viarum tuarum nolumus: 
                     Iob. 21. They say to almightie God, depart from vs, we wil not haue the knowledge of thy Psal. 57. waies. And the prophet Dauid yet more expressely; Their furie is like the furie of serpentes, like vnto cocatrices that stope their cares, and vvil not heare the voice of the inchaunter. By this inchaunter, he meaneth the Holie Ghost, which secketh by al meanes possible, to charme them from the bewitching wherin they stand, called by the wise man, fascinatio megacitatis; the bewitching of vanitie. But (as the prophet faith) Sap. 4. 
                     they vvil not heare, they turne their backes, they 
                     Zach 7. 
                     stoppe their eares, to the ende they may not vnderstand; they put their hartes as an Adamant stone, left perhappes they should heare Gods lavve, and be conuerted.
                  
                  The nation of Iewes is peculiarlie noted to haue bene alwaies geuen to this The hard harted. Ievves. great finne, as S. Stephen witnesseth, when he said vnto their owne faces; You stiffe necked Ievves, you haue alvvayes resisted the Holy Ghost: meaning therby (as Christ declareth Act. 7. more at large) that they resisted the prophetes and Saintes of God, in whom Mat. 5. Luc. 11. 13. the Holy Ghost spake vnto them frō time to time, for amendement of their life. And

for that, through the light of knowledge which they had by hearing of Gods law, they could not in truth, or with shew of reason, condemne the things which were said, or auoide the iust reprehensions vsed towardes them; and yet resolued with thē selues not to obey, or change the custome of their proceedings: therfore fel they in fine to persecute sharplie their reprehendors; wherof the onely cause was, hardnes of hart. Indurauerunt facies suas supra petram, & noluerunt reuerti, saieth God by the Iere. 5. mouth of Ieremie; they haue hardened their faces aboue the hardnes of a rocke; and they wil not turne to me. And in an other place of the same prophet he complaineth greeuouslie of this peruersenes: Quare ergo auersus est populus isle in Ierusalem, 
                     Iere. 8. 
                     auersione contentiosa?
                      And why then is this people in Ierusalem reuolted from me, by so contentious and peruerse an alienation; as they wil not heare me any more &c? And yet againe in an other place: Quare moriemini domus - Israel? why wil you die, 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 18. you house of Israel? why wil you damne your selues? why are you so obstinate, as not to heare? so peruerse, as not to learne? so cruel to your selues, as you wil not know the dangers wherin you liue? nor vnderstand the miserie that hangeth ouer you?
                  Doest thou not imagine (deare brother) that God vseth this kind of speech, not onely to the Iewes, but also to many thousand Christians, and perhappes also

vnto thy self many times euerie day, for that thou refusest his good motions, and Godes crie vnto vs daily. other meanes sent from him, to draw thee to his seruice; thou being resolued not to yeld therunto, but to folow thy pursuite, whatsoeuer persuasions shal come to the contrarie? Alas, how many Christians be there, who say to God daily, (as they did whom I haue named before) departe from 
                     Iob. 21. 
                     vs, vve vvil not haue the knovvledge of thy vvaies? How many be there, which abhorre to heare good counsaile, feare and trē
                     ble to read good bookes, flie and detest the frequentation of godly company, lest perhappes by such occasions they might be touched in conscience, and so conuerted and saued? How many be there, which say with thos most vnfortunate hard harted men, wherof the prophet speaketh; Percussinius foedus cum morte, & cum inferno fecimus pactum: 
                     We haue stricken a league Esa. 28. with death, & haue made a bargaine with hel it self; which is in effect as much, as if they had said; trouble vs not, moleste vs not with thy persuations; spend not thy wordes and labour in vaine, talke vnto others who are not yet setled; let them take heauen that take it wil; we for our partes are resolued; we are at a pointe; we haue made a league that must be kept; we haue made a bargaine that must be perfourmed, yea though it be with hel, and death euerlasting.
                  It is a wonderful furie, the obduration of a hard hart: & not without cause compared

by the prophet (as I haue shewed The description of 
                           〈◊〉
                         hard 
                           〈◊〉
                        . Eza. 48. before) to the wilful furie and rage of serpentes. And an other place of scripture describeth it thus: Durus es, & neruus ferreus ceruix tua, & frons tua aerea; 
                     Thou art hard harted, and thy necke is a sinowe of yron, and thy forehead is of brasse. What can be more vehementlie spoken to expresse Li. 1. de cō
                           sid. ad Erg. cap. 2. the hardnesse of this mettal.But yet S. Barnard expresseth it more at large, in thes wordes; Quid ergo cor durum?
                       and what is then a hard hart, saith he? and he answereth immediatlie. A hard hart is that, which is neither cut by compunction, nor softened by godlines, nor moued with prayers, nor yeeldeth to threatning, nor is any thing holpen, but rather hardened by chastising. A hard hart is that, which is ingratful to Gods benefites, disobedient to his counsails, made cruel by his iudgementes, dissolute by his alluremētes, vnshamefast to filthines, feareles to perils, vncourteous in humane affaires, recheles in matters pertaining to God, forgetful of things past, negligent in things present, improuident for things to come.
                  
                  By this description of S. Barnard it appeareth, that a hard hart is almost a desperate The explication of S. Barnards vvordes. and remediles disease, where it falleth. For what wil you doe (saith this good father) to amend it? If you laie the greeuousnes of his sinnes before him: he is not touched with compunction. If you alleage him al the reasons in the world, why we ought to serue God, and why we

ought not to offend and dishonour him: he is not mollified by this consideration of pietie. If you would request him and beseeche him with teares, euen on your knees: he is not moued. If you threaten Gods wrath against him: he yeeldeth nothing therunto. If God scourge him in deede: he waxeth furious, and becōmeth much more hard then before. If God bestowe benefites on him: he is vngrateful. If he counsaile him for his saluation: he obeieth not. If you tel him of Gods secret and seuere iudgementes: it driueth him to desperation, and to more crueltie. If you allure him with Gods mercie: it maketh him dissolute. If you tel him of his owne filthines: he blusheth not. If you admonish him of his perils: he feareth not. If he deale in matters towardes men: he is proude, and vncurteous. If he deale in matters towardes God: he is rashe, light, and contemptuous. Finallie, he forgetteth what soeuer hath passed before hī, towardes other men, either in rewarde of godlines, or in punishment of sinners. For, the time present, he neglecteth it, and maketh no account of vsing it to his benefite. And of things to come, ether of blisse or miserie, he is vtterlie vnprouident; nor wil esteeme therof, laie them neuer so often, or vehementlie before his face. And what waie is there then, to doe this man good?
                  Not without great cause surelie, did the wise man pray so hartelie to God; Animae
                     
                     irreuerenti & insrumitae ne tradas me; deliuer The danger of a hard hart. Eccl. 23. me not ouer (ô Lord) vnto a shamelesse and vnrulie soule: that is, vnto a hard and obstinate hart. Wherof he geueth the reasō in an other place, of the same booke: Cor enim durum babebit malè in nouissimo; for Eccl. 3. that a hard hart shalbe in an euil case at the last daie. Oh that al hard harted people would note this reason of the scripture. Note. But S. Barnard goeth on, and openeth the terrour hereof more fullie, when he saith. Nemo duri cordis salutem vnquàm adepīus 
                     Li. 1. de cō
                        sid. c. 2. Ezec. 36. 
                     est, nisi quem forte miserans Deus abstulit ab to (iuxta prophetam) cor lapideum, & dedit cor carneum. 
                     There was neuer yet hard harted man saued, except perchance God by his mercie did take awaie his stonie hart, and geue him a hart of flesh, according to the prophet. By which wordes S. Barnard signifieth, and proueth out of the prophet, Tvvo kindes of hartes in men, vvith their properties. that there are two kindes of hartes in mē; the one a fleshie hart, which bleedeth if you but prick it; that is, it falleth to cō
                     trition, repentance, and teares vpon neuer so smal a checke for sinne. The other is a stony hart, which if you beate and buffet neuer so much with hammers, you may as soone breake it in peeces, as ether bend it, or make it bleed. And of thes two hartes in this life, dependeth al our miserie, or felicitie for the life to come. For as God, when he would take vengeance of Pharao, had no more greuous waie to doe it, then to saie, Indurabo cor Pharaonis; I wil harden the hart of Pharao; that is, (as S.

Austen expoundeth) I will take awaie my Exo. 4. 7. 14. Au. q. 18. super exod. & ser. 88. de temp. Ezec. 36. grace, and so permit him to harden his owne hart: so when he would shew mercie to Israel, he had no more forcible meane to expresse the same, then to saie, I vvil take avvaie the stony hart out of your flesh, and geue you a fles hie hart in steade therof. Which is to saie, I will take away your hard hart and geue you a soft hart, that wilbe moued when it is spoken vnto. And of al other blessings and benefites which God doth bestowe vpon mortal men in this life, this soft and tender hart is one of the greatest; I meane such a hart as is soone moued to repentance, soone checked and controlled, soone pearsed, soone made to bleed, soone stirred to amendement. And on the contrarie parte, there can be no greater curse or malediction laied vpon a Christian, then to haue a hard and obstinate hart, which heapeth euery day vengeance vnto it self and his maister also, as S. Paul saieth: and is compared Heb. 6. by the same Apostle vnto the ground which no store of raine can make fruteful, albeit it fal neuer so often vpon the same; and therfore he pronounceth therof, Reproba est & maledicto proxima, cuius consuinmatis in combustimem; That is; it is reprobate, & the next dore vnto malediction; whos ende or consum nation must be, fire and burning.
                  
                  Which thing being so, no maruaile though the holy scripture doe dehort vs The conclusion. so carefully from this obduration and

hardnes of hart, as from the most dangerous and desperate disease, that possiblie may fal vpon a Christian, being in deed (as S. Paul signifieth) the next dore to Heb. 6. reprobatiō it self. The same Apostle therfore crieth, Nolite contristare, nolite extinguere 
                     Ephe. 4. 1. The. 5. 
                     spiritum Dei; 
                     doe you not contristate or make sadde; doe you not extinguish the spirit of God, by obduration, by resisting and impugning the same. Againe; non obauretur quis ex vobis sallacia peccati; Let no man Heb. 3. be hard harted among you, through the deceit of sinne. The prophet Dauid also crieth, hodie si vocem eius audicritis, nolite obdurare 
                     Psal. 94. 
                     corda vesira;
                      Euē this day, if you heare the voice of God, calling you to repentance: see you harden not your hartes against him. Al which earnest speeches, vsed by Gods holie spirit, doe geue vs to vnderstand, how carefully we haue to flie this most pestilēt infection of a hard hart; which almightie God of his mercie geue vs grace to doe, and indue vs with a tender hart towardes the ful obedience of his diuine Maiestie; such a soft hart (I say) as the wise man desired, when he said to God; Da serun tuo cor docile; Geue vnto me thy seruant (ô Lord) a hart that is docible, 3. Re. 3. and tractable to be instructed: such a hart as God him self describeth to be in al Esa. 66. them whom he leueth, saying, ad quem respiciam, nisi ad pauperculum & contritum sorde, & timentem sermones meos? To whom wil I haue regarde or shew my fauour, but vnto the poore and humble of hart, vnto the

contrite spirit, and to such as tremble at my speeches?
                  Beholde (deare brother) what a hart VVhat hart God requireth in vs. God requireth at thy hādes? A litle poore and humble hart: (for so much importeth the diminitiue, Pauperculus.) Also a contrite hart, for thy offences past; and a hart that trembleth at euerie word that commeth to thee from God, by his ministers. How then wilt thou not feare at so many wordes, and whole discourses as haue bene vsed before, for awaking the, for denouncing thy peril, for stirring the to amendement? How wilt thou not feare the threates and iudgementes of this great Lord for thy sinnes? How wilt thou dare to proceede any further in his displeasure? how wilt thou deferre this resolution any longer? Surelie the least part of that which hath bene said, might suffice to moue a tender hart, an humble and contrite spirite, to make a present resolution for the amendement of life. But if al together, can not moue thee to doe the same: I can saie no more, but that thou hast a verie hard hart in deed; which I beseech our heauenlie father to soften for thy saluation, with the pretious hoate blood of his onelie sonne, our Sauiour, who was content to shedde it for that effect vpon the Crosse.
               
               
                  The Conclusion of the vvhole booke.

so much as time permitted me, concerning the first general point required at our hā
                     des for our saluation: that is, concerning resolution, appointed by my diuision in the beginning, to be the subiect or matter of this first booke: I wil here make an end; Pag. 9. deferring for a time the performance of my purpose for the other two bookes, vpon the causes and reasons set downe in The other tvvo bookes promised. the beginning; nothing dowting, but if almightie God shal vouchsafe to worke in any mans hart by meanes of this booke or otherwise, this first point of resolution (the most hard of al other,) then that he wil also geue meanes to perfite the saue worke begonne of him self, and wil supplie Phil. 2. by other waies the two pointes folowing: that is to saie, both a right beginning, and a constant perseuerance, wherunto my other two bookes promised, are appointed. Neither would it be hard for any man that were once in deed resolued, to finde helpers and instructours inough, (besides the Holie Ghost, which in this case wil alwaies be at hande,) to assist him in this holy enterprise, albeit thes two other bookes of mine should neuer come foorth. Ther want not at this daie (our merciful Lord be glorified for it,) neither store of godly bookes, nor yet of skilful men, in our owne countrie, that are wel able to guide a zealous spirite, in the right way to vertue. And yet (as I haue promised before,) so meane I (by Gods most holie helpe & assistance)

to send thee (gentle reader) as my time and habilitie wil permit, the other two bookes also; especiallie, if it shal please his diuine Maiestie to cōforte me therunto, with the gaine or good of any one soule by this which is alreadie done: that is to say, if I shal vnderstand, conceiue, or hope, that any one soule so dearlie purchased by the pretious blood of the sonne of God, shalbe moued to resolution by any thing that is here said; or shalbe reclamed from the bondage of sinne, and restored to the seruice of our maker & redemer; which is the onely ende of my writing, as his deuine Maiestie best knoweth.
                  And truly (deare Christian brother) albeit I must confesse, that much more might be said for this point of resolutiō, then is here touched by me, or then any man can wel vtter in any competent kind of booke or volume: yet am I of opinion, that ether thes reasons here alleaged are sufficient, or els nothing wil suffice, for the conquering of our obstinacie, & beating Th' effect of that vvhich hath bene said in this booke. doune of our rebellious disobedience in this point. Here thou maiest see and read the principal argumentes inducing thee to the seruice of God, and detestation of vice. Here thou maiest behold (especially in this second edition which is much larger then the former) first, that of necessitie thou must confesse there is a In the first part. God that made thee and al the rest; the ende and cause whie he created thee, which was to serue him; the only true

way of which seruice, to be by fulfulling Christs holy commandemētes; then, what things are required at thy handes in particular; the account that wil be demanded of thee; the iustice and seueritie of God therin; his goodnes towardes thee; his watchfulnes ouer thee; his desire to winne thee; his reward, if thou doe wel; his infinit punishment, if thou doe euil; his calles; his baites; his allurementes to saue thee. And on the contrarie part, here are In the second part. discouered vnto thee, the vanities, and deceites of thos impedimentes, hinderāces, or excuses, which any way might let, stay, or discourage thy resolution: the faigned difficulties of vertuous life are remoued; the conceiued feares of Gods seruice are taken away; the alluring flatteries of worldlie vanities are opened; the foolish presumption vpon Gods mercie; the danger of delay; the dissimulation of Sloth; the desperate peril of careles and stony hartes are declared. What then wilt thou desire more to moue thee? What other arguments wilt thou expect, to draw the from vice and wickednes, more then thes?
                  If al this stirre the not, what wil moue thee (gentle reader)? If when thou hast The necessuie of resolution. read this, thou lay doune the booke againe, and walke on in thy careles life as quietlie as before; what hope (I beseech thee) may there be conceiued of thy saluation? Wilt thou goe to heauen liuing as thou doest? it is impossible: As soone

thou maiest driue God out of heauen, as get thither thy self, by this kind of life. What then? wilt thou forgoe heauen, and yet escape hel also? this is lesse possible, whatsoeuer the Atheistes of this world doe persuade thee. Wilt thou perhappes deferre the matter, and thinke of it herafter? I haue tolde thee my opinion hereof before. Thou shalt neuer haue more abilitie to doe it then now, and perhappes neuer halfe so much. If thou refuse it now, I may greatlie feare, that thou wilt be refused hereafter thy self. There is no waic then so good (deare brother) as to doe it presentlie whiles it is offered. Breake from that tyrant, which detaineth thee in seruitude; shake of his chaines; cut in sunder his bandes; runne violentlie to Christ, which standeth redie to embrace thee, with his armes open on the Crosse. Make ioyful al the Angels, and court of Luc. 15. heauen with thy conucrsion; strike once the stroke with God againe; make a manlie resolution; saie with that old couragious souldier of IESVS Christ, Sainct Ierome; If my father stoode vveeping on his

                  Oh that we had such hartes (dcare:

Who would lie one daie drowned in sinne? who would liue one daie in such slauerie as we doe? who would eate swaddes with the prodigal sonne among swine, seing he may returne home, and be so honorablie receiued, and entertained by his owne father; haue so good cheere, and banqueting, and heare so great melodie, ioye, and triumphe for his returne? I saye no more Luc. 15. herein, (deare brother) then thou art assured of, by the word, and promise of Godes owne mouth, from which can proceede nether falshood nor deceit. Returne then I beseeche thee; laie handfast on his promise, who wil not faile thee: runne to him now he calleth, whiles thou hast time; and esteeme not al this world worth a strawe, in respect of this one acte. For so shalt thou be a most happie, and thrise happie man; and shalt blesse hereafter the houre and moment, that cuer thou madest this fortunate resolution. And I for my part (I trust) shal not be voide of some portion of thy good happe and felicitie. At least wise I doubt not, but thy holie conuersion shal treat for me with our common father, who is the God of mercies, for remission of my manifolde sinnes, and that I may serue and honour him together with thee, al the daies of my life; which ought to be both our petitions; and therfore, in

both our names, I beseeche his diuine Maiestie to graunt it vnto vs; for his deare sonne, our Lordes sake, IESVS Christ.
                  Amen.

                  ce of thy holy spirite, for my direction & instruction in this meditation that now I take in hande; to the ende that my soule may receaue consolation and benefit therby, in learning to know both thee & her self, thy sacred wil and her bounden dewtie, thy iudgementes and her accomptes, thy endles mercies and her infinite offences. Geue vnto me, ô Father of al mercie and Creator of al good spirits, such a docible and tender hart, as may be pearsed with the holy inspirations, which it shal please thy heauenly benignitie to bestov vpon me. Graunt that the holy fire of godly affections may be inkendled within my bowels by this meditatiō, as it was in the hart of thy seruant Dauid by like holy Psal. 38. excercise. Make my spirit attent to thos blessed and fatherly admonitions, which thou shalt please to send vnto me in this time of treatie betwene thee and me. Illuminate my vnderstanding, incline my wil, stirre vp my affections, inflame my desires,

confirme my memorie and continual remembrāce in al such things, as it shal please thy goodnes to reueale vnto me at this instant or otherwise for my saluation. Graunt al this (ô my most merciful God) for thy deare sonne our Saueour IESVS sake, who hath assured vs, that thou wilt neuer deny a good spirit, to him that in sinceritie demandeth the same.
            
            
               A prayer to be vsed in the ende of our meditation.
               BEhold, ô my God, behold, ô my most merciful and patient Lord, how I haue passed ouer this time of meditation and contemplatiō with thee. With how much negligence, sloth, coldnes, and distraction, and with how litle feeling of thy good motions within me. But thou (ô Lord) art wel witting & priuie to mine infirmities and manifold miseries, & therfore of thee I craue pardon for the same. I thanke thee also most hartely and humbly for al the good thoughts, cogitatiōs, and suggestiōs, which haue presented them selues vnto my minde, in the time of this meditation, as most holy Embassadours sent from thie heauenly throne, to deale with me for the gaining of thy kingdome. Whos blessed voices and most profitable speeches, I beseech thy deuine goodnes to geue me grace that I may imprint in my hart, & seeke to put in executiō in the course of my life

to come; to the ende that my iudgement and damnation be not the more greeuous in respect of thes thy benefites, but rather that my life being amended therby, and my soule stirred vp to more zele in thy seruice, I may finally be made partaker with thy true children of that eternal blisse which thou hast prepared for such as doe loue, feare, and serue thee, and doe yeeld obedience to such holy inspirations as thou doest send vnto them for their euerlasting weale.
