               IMPRINTED AT London by Abraham Ueale dwelling in Paules Church yard at ye ſigne of ye Lamb. 1577.
         
         
            
            
            TO THE RIGHT Worshipful, his very good Frende M. RICHARD MAISTERS Doctor in Phiſick, and Seruant to her excellent Maieſtie.
            
            
               SYR, I SEND you heer a short treatiſe of the Gout, writen by one Balista a Frenchman, and dedicated to a great Phiſitian in Fraunce.
            It came by Fortune (beeing as I think not any where els to be had) into my hands, which for the benefit of diuerſe my freends troubled with that diſeaſe, and partely for mine owne recreation, that was ſomthing delighted with the writer (in as good maner as I could) I

Englished. The verſe in Latin is not very eloquent, and therfore no meruail though the tranſlation be rude and vnpleaſant.
            But ſure his Method and order is not in mine oppiniō to be diſſalowed, but rather much to be commended. I haue noted him in ſuch places as I thought conuenient, and would haue farther augmented him but that I thought it not good to be to curious in an other mans woork.
            Such as it is: I ſend it you and commit it to your good allowance and protection.
            
               Your very loouing freend.

               ❧The Ouerthrowe of the GOVTE.
            
            
               
                  
                     AGainſt the Goute wt al her force
               my minde deſires to goe:
               And wt a valiaunt hand to fling,
               my darts at this my foe.
               Longe time this beaſt hath now preſumed,
               her wicked force to bend:
               Againſt that good olde man that doth,
               the Sedun flock defend,
               Diſeaſed ſore he lies and able,
               not to ſtirre a limme:
               So hath the wretche benomd his Joints
               and ſo hath plagued him.
               That ſtill he is inforſte to keep his houſe,
               as doth the Snaill:
               O pitious hap and great miſchaunce,
               that each man ought to waill.
               It gréeues me to the hart to ſe,
               the torments that he beares:
               Her crueltie Conſtrayneth me,
               to ſtaine my chéekes with teares
               My ſorowes doth cōmaund ye doutfull hap
               of Mars to trye:
               Why ſtand I ſtil? I will aſſayle,
               the monſter preſentlye.
               Drawe néere O swéet Redéemer of,
               the World before vndoone:
               
                  
Of that moſte glorious maieſtie,
               the true and only ſonne.
               Uouchſafe to giue thy ſpéeding darts,
               in this my quarrel iuſt:
               And cauſe that I with them may throwe
               this monſter in the duſt.
               And thou O noble Phillip, by all
               the Gods abooue that be:
               I thée require to ſhowe thy ſelf,
               a man in eche degrée.
               Hope wel for hope auaileth much,
               In driuing gréef away:
               I dout no whit, but ſhortly thou
               ſhalt ſée a fairer day.
               More hapeneth in an houre ſomtime,
               then in a thouſand yéer:
               And many great commodities,
               in ſmalleſt time appéer.
               I truſt to driue the Gout vnto
               the lothſome pit of hel:
               And that thou ſhalt good Phillip haue
               thy feet again ful wel.
               Doo you no more but bear in minde,
               the woords that I ſhall ſay:
               And theſe my leſſons that I giue,
               doo cary wel away.
               The ſuttle ſhackles that this Beaſt,
               dooth binde the féet withall:
               
                  
                  Podagran all the learnd of Gréece,
               haue euer vſde to call.
               Hence ſprang at firſt the hateful name,
               of this ſo painful gréef:
               That ſuddainly the feet unwares,
               aſſaileth like a theef.
               At firſt it rageth in the ioynts,
               and then aſſaults the toes:
               And ſtraight from thence with haſtie courſe
               vnto the héel it goes.
               And ſomtimes to the buckle bones,
               where as it ſwelles and ſhowes:
               With pain while as abundance great,
               of humors thether flowes.
               Somtime the Cod beſide, that bothe
               the ſtones incloſeth round:
               Dooth ſwel withall and hanging lowe,
               it oftentimes is found.
               The cauſer of this great diſeaſe,
               not euermore is one:
               Oft times the parents are the cauſe
               it falles the Childe vpon.
               When as the ſéed but féeble is,
               wherof the frute is wrought:
               For ſince the root ſuch weakenes hath,
               the plant muſt néeds he nought.
               Beſides to vehement exerciſe,
               the Gout dooth often bréed:
               
                  
Of ſeruice long in Venus court,
               it likewiſe dooth procéed.
               The very frame of all the limmes,
               is ſhaken with this game:
               Eche Sinow eke enféebled is
               by vſing of the ſame.
               And Bacchus thou that wunted art,
               the ſpirits to reuiue:
               Dooſt vſe to hurt the féet of ſuch,
               as in thy ſeruice ſtriue.
               Of Martiall acts in ſtately ſtile,
               did Ennius alwaies write:
               And in his cups did blaſe the déeds,
               of many a worthy knight.
               Yet of the Gout at laſt he dyed,
               nor could his verſes ſaue:
               (With all the ſwéetnes that they had)
               their maiſter from the graue.
               Great hurt beſide vnto the ioynts,
               dooth euermore ariſe:
               Of colde, exceſſiue Idlenes,
               and to much exerciſe.
               The hart with fury once inflamde,
               dooth kindle preſently:
               And fireth all the humors ſtraight,
               that in the body lye.
               Wherby vnbrideled all, they rome
               and raunge in euery place:
               
                  
And paining all the Senous ſore,
               they vex in pitious caſe.
               Oft times of thick and clammy fleume,
               this vile diſeaſe dooth bréed:
               Somtime again, of bothe the ſortes
               of Choler dooth procéed.
               And tomuch blood while as it dooth,
               the tender ioynts oppreſſe:
               Is many times the onely cauſe,
               of this vnquietnes.
               Moſte gréeu'd with this diſeaſe are men.
               the women not ſo much:
               The cauſe is plain and euident,
               who liſteth it to touch.
               One reaſon is becauſe that heat,
               in man dooth more excéede:
               Which cauſeth that the humors pearſe,
               the ſenowes more with spéed.
               Moſte ſubiect to the gout are thoſe,
               that greateſt age haue ſéene:
               And ſuch as with ſome ſicknes great,
               haue long tormented béene.
               And cares of minde and ſorowes great,
               doo bréed this gréeuous ſore:
               And want of wunted exerciſe,
               as hath béen ſaid before.
               Let this ſuffiſe to ſhowe the ſpring,
               of ſuch a 
                     •••
                  liſh ſprite:
               
                  
Now time it is my weapons for,
               to ſhowe and fall to fight.
               And firſt I wil begin with herb,
               with Juyce and mettals bright:
               And then of ſtones that ſerue the turn,
               I craue the aid and might.
               Then Beaſts and Birds I ſet in rank,
               and cauſe them to reſtore:
               The weake and weariſh limmes of thoſe
               that lamed were before.
               And laſt of all my Tables doo
               I ſpred with meat and Wine:
               And there the perfect diat for
               this ſicknes doo aſſigne.
               ¶ Firſt Toutſane vnto thée I giue, Not our common Toutſane but Dioſcorides his Panacaea reed Mathiolus.
                  
               
               the cheefeſt place before:
               That dooſt deriue thy worthy name,
               of bealing euery ſore.
               Thou beaten ſmall and mingled wel
               with reaſons good and ſweet:
               In plaiſter made applyed wel,
               dooſt heal the féeble feet.
               An herb there is that in the Sun, Mary Goldes.
               
               dooth woundrouſly delight:
               And after him dooth euermore,
               direct her courſe aright.
               That when be once begins to riſe,
               dooth ſpred and open wide:
               
                  
And mourning hangeth down her hed,
               when Weſtwards he dooth slide.
               This medled wel with ſewet of
               a Gote, dooth driue away.
               The Gout, the like dooth Balme ſtamped
               if to the féet you lay.
               And Ueruen ſod in water dooth
               the féet from ſicknes ſaue:
               Which herb the noble Romans wont
               in great account to haue.
               The alter fair of Iupiter,
               
               with this they vſde to ſwéep:
               And therwith euery corner of
               their houſes ſprinkled déep.
               Beſide the Herald when he gaue,
               defiance to his foe:
               Commaunded was with Garland all
               of Ueruen clad to go.
               Coleworts in this diſeaſe are good,
               béeing ſodden ſpecially:
               The broth wherof refuſe not thou,
               to drink for remedy.
               Put Coliander to the Cole,
               and Salt and Rewe beſide:
               And flower fine of Barley that,
               by grinding ſmall is tride,
               A Pultiſe made of theſe, if to
               the aking ioynts ye lay:
               
                  
It greatly dooth the paines aſſwage,
               and driues the Gout away.
               And if the Gout be ſuch as in
               his rage it dooth not ſwel:
               The Radiſh root wil help, if that
               in Wine you ſéeth it wel.
               The noble Radiſh that our fathers
               olde, did greatly looue:
               And did indéed the ſame eſtéeme,
               all other meats abooue.
               At Delphus was it then decréed,
               it ſhould be grau'd in Golde:
               The Béet in ſiluer to be framde,
               the Raape in leaden moulde.
               This to the Gout is to be laid,
               the Juce of Woodbinde thick:
               And mingle there withall the meal
               or Flower of Fenugrick.
               And Nettel rootes wel bruſed in
               the ſtrongeſt Uinager:
               The leaues beſide béeing pouned with The leaf & the ſeede with Beres Greace.
               
               the tallowe of a Bear.
               And ſtinking Aſſa faetida,
               
               in ſpunges wel applyde:
               Wil like wiſe help the gréeuous Gout,
               and Feuer ſore beſide.
               If therunto you put the War,
               that is from Cipreſſe brought:
               
                  
And ſée that with the ſuet of
               a Gote it wel be wrought.
               Plantain béeing pouned wel with ſalt,
               and Lens with Pap made with Barly Polent good:
               The water Betany, beſides 
               Hemp roots, and Sothernwood.
               The Juyce of Henbane mixt with meal,
               that from the Mil dooth flye:
               And war, with Gum Armoniack
               
               in equall quantitie.
               And boyled wel in Uinagre.
               the braunche of Poplar ſmall:
               With Herb that beares his name of Age,
               that Grounſil we doo call.
               To this it néedful is to put,
               the greace of fatted Bore:
               And mingle wax with Willowe leaues,
               that wel haue ſod before.
               An Herb there is that in the Sea, Phicus marina Sea weed.
                  
               
               dooth alwaies winde about:
               Which (if it be not ouer dry)
               wil heale the painful Gout.
               Who would beleeue that heaps of Corne,
               ſhould driue the Gout away,
               And bring the féeble foot his force,
               to ſtand without a ſtay?
               As Sextus ſearching of the Barnes, Sextus Pompeius
               
               was taken with the Gout:
               
                  
He laid him down in heaps of Wheat,
               that cloſde him rownd about.
               When ſuddainly he felt him ſelf,
               aſwel as any man:
               And ryſing vp with ioyful hart,
               to walke about began.
               For all the humor out was drawen,
               and dryed by this reléef:
               That was the hed, the fountain and
               the cauie of all this gréef.
               For ſuch a force is in the Wheat,
               as that it hath béen ſéen:
               The veſſels ful in ſhorteſt time
               to drawe and dry vp clens
               To Elder leaues. the Sewet of
               a Gote put orderly:
               This laid vnto the féet wil be
               a preſent remedy.
               Forget not that ſame herb beſide
               that gréen dooth alwaies growe: Houſeleek or Singre.
               
               It healeth thoſe ſame angry Goutss,
               that red and fiery ſhowe.
               The Gourd that groweth wilde his rine,
               is thought to doo the ſame:
               Which alſo helps the hed that dooth
               with fiery humors flame.
               The like béeing ſod in Uinagre The wylde Cocumber.
               
               the Cocumber wil doo:
               
                  
So wil the Cole, the ſurging Seas
               that groweth néer vnto. Sea Colwort it groweth vnder the Clyfts beſydes Seaforde in Sussex
               
               And Purſlain pounded wel with Salt,
               dooth heale this painful rage:
               And likewiſe dooth the fiery heat
               of ſhingles ſoon aſſawge.
               Tis very ſtraunge that ruſt of Iron,
               wil heale the gréeuous Gout:
               The wound beſide with Lancel made,
               wil let the poyſon out.
               When Telephus with ſtaf of fierce
               
                  Achilles wounded was:
               And neuer a Surgion there aboute:
               could bring the cure to paſſe.
               They took aduiſement of their Gods,
               
                  Apollo anſwered thus:
               
                  Achilles Swoord (quoth he) ſhall ſaue,
               the life of Telaphus.
               
               With ioyful mind went Telephus,
               
               to méet his enemy:
               Who ſtriking gaue him with his wound,
               a preſent remedy.
               The treacle good beſide, that cures
               the deadly poyſon ſtrong:
               Is ſouerain to be vſde againſt
               the Gout retained long.
               What ſhould I héer of Salt intreate
               Nature that all things ſpun:
               
                  
Created nothing néedful more
               for man then Salt and ſun.
               With ſalt we ſauour all our meat,
               and doo preſerue our food:
               Take Salt away our bankets loſſ,
               no Uiands ſéemeth good.
               Salt maketh ſtrong and luſtie Joynts,
               example good may be: A Bag of Salt beatē ſmal wet in boyling wine and layd to the feet. Or ſalt very fine beaten with Oyl of Camomil made in an Ointment.
               
               The tough and ſturdy limmes of horne,
               in Fiſhers that we ſée.
               Salt with his fretting force, dooth enter,
               pearce and thorow ſpring:
               Diſſolueth, eateth, burneth vp
               and fineth euery thing.
               With Hony, Oile, and meal béeing mixt
               and beaten as it ought:
               It maketh good the féet again,
               that féeble were and nought.
               And if you liſt my poore aduiſe,
               in this diſeaſe to take:
               Go get you to the Sea and bathe,
               your féet when they doo ake.
               Tis good in Brimſtone bathes ſomtime
               to waſh your ſelf beſide:
               Which wil refreſh your craſed limmes,
               and ſtop a ſtormy tide.
               Take water with Salt Péeter mixt
               and Brimſtone, let them boil:
               
                  
And waſh your legges, or if you liſt,
               with Lées of ſodden Oyle.
               And now for ſtones, let thrée ſuffiſe,
               the Jet as one of thoſe:
               From whence a ſtinking ſulphur aſre,
               aſcendeth to the noſe.
               The ſmel wherof doo Serpents ſhun,
               wherwith what ſoeuer you write:
               In brittel veſſel made of Earth,
               wil neuer out of ſight.
               Lay this vnto your Gout, the ſtone
               that Iron vp dooth take:
               Dooth tame this mad vnruly beaſt,
               and quickly out dooth ſhake.
               Beat ſmall a Medſtone, mix it with
               the Milk of ſuch a wight:
               As at her firſt deliuery brings
               a pretie Boy to light.
               This wil aſſwage the Gout, if that
               you lay it therunto:
               And bring the Senowes to their force,
               to doo as they ſhould doo.
               You worthy creatures that haue life,
               with haſte your ſelues addreſſe,
               And let me haue your helping hands,
               in this my buſines.
               The bones of man to aſhes burnt,
               and made in pouder ſine:
               
                  
Béeing drunk, is not of littie force,
               againſt this foe of mine.
               And womans milk, if that you ioyne
               the Humlock therwithall:
               Applyed to the féet dooth heale,
               the raging torments all.
               Put Gooſegrece héerunto and ad
               green Iſop to the ſame:
               Or Opium wherwithall you may,
               a parfect medicine frame. Opium the Juyce or Gum of black Poppey.
               
               With grece of ſwine, ioyne womans heare
               and this ſhall doo you good:
               Béeing laid vnto the aking féet,
               that rage with angry mood.
               Refuſe not thou to bath thy feet,
               with Urin of a man:
               Prouided that the party be,
               as helthy as ye can.
               The right foot of an Egle, to
               your right foot look you lay:
               And to your left leg lay the left,
               to driue the gout away.
               Somtime again with Horſeleaches,
               beſet your féet about:
               That Blood ſuckers are termed of
               the rude and common rout.
               Theſe neuer wil forſake the legges,
               wherto they cleaue and pul:
               
                  
(So great deſire they haue to blood)
               til all their ſkin be ful.
               But all the vileſt humors that,
               they in thoſe partes doo finde:
               Which were the cauſers of this gréef,
               they drink with gréedy minde.
               And when they once haue fiid them ſelues,
               as ful as they may be:
               They leaue the place and fall away,
               as beaſts that drunken be.
               But if they chaunce to cleue to faſt,
               and wil not leaue their holde,
               Then ſprinkle beaten Salt theron
               burnt wul or aſhes colde.
               It holſom is beſide to open in
               thy féet ſome bleeding vain:
               Wherby the humor paſſeth out,
               that bréedeth all thy pain.
               An aged Cock wel ſtewed in broth,
               béeing drunk dooth pleaſure great:
               In filling all the ioints and limmes
               with ſwéet and pleſant heat.
               The milk of Aſſes drunck dooth heale,
               the gout with raging mood:
               So dooth the fleſh therof if that,
               you vſs it for your food.
               The Owle that hath a body fat,
               you ſeeth in water ſtall:
               
                  
And often eat the tender fleſh
               and drink the broth withall.
               The Grece of Swine, with Aſhes mixt
               of dung that Gates doo make:
               Is very ſouerain, if therwith Gotes dūg mingled with Barly flower and Uinagre, a good Pultis. So is the root of marſh malowes mingled with Ducks greace, for olde ſwelling goutes

               When as the limmes and members all,
               with colde congealed be:
               Their naturall heat again, and warmth
               they ſtraight receiue from thée.
               Thou ſuppleſt ſtifned partes and ſuch
               as weake and féebled be:
               Reſtorſte to helth and ſores dooſt heale
               that lothſome are to ſée.
               Thou driu'ſt the Gout from hand and foot,
               what ſhould I vtter more?
               In few woords wil I ſpeake at once,
               thou healeſt enery ſore.
               Such force to thée the helthful roots,
               of noble herbes doo giue:
               Wherwith the wandring herds of Swine
               in pleaſant paſtures liue.
               The Romains, that by valure all

Had thée in honor great for this,
               thy vertues that they knew.
               With thée the gladſome Bride, when as
               the houſe ſhe enter ſhould
               Of her new maried mate, the poſts

               Héer of the wife firſt took her name,
               becauſe in times before:
               The charge to her committed was
               of noynting of the doore.
               For they ſuppoſde this Greaſe would put
               all troubles vnto night:
               And that for euer after, no

               But to my Gout again, The Dung
               of Kites and aſhes fine:
               Of Snailes and Weſel burned bothe
               wil heale this Gout of thine.
               Let Legges that thus diſeaſed be,

               The Sewet like wiſe of a Calf,
               for this is very good:
               To this may alſo added be,

               Moreouer take a Crowe and quick

               And cloſe him ſo that he may haue,
               no place away to creep.
               When foure dayes once be ful expirde,
               go take him from his graue:
               And burn him ſtraight, then mingle Wax
               with the Aſhes that you haue.
               This laid vnto the feet, dooth driue
               this monſter quite away:
               And makes the poore diſeaſed man,

               And Iunoes bird, the Peocock helps

               Annoint thy féet with drippings hot

               And take the Beauers ſtones beſide,
               and mingle wel with that.
               To Aſhes burn the Mullets hed,
               that in the ſea dooth ſwim:
               
                  
With pleaſant Honye mingle it,

               Go take the crauking Frog, and with

               His members all, and lay his féet
               vnto the painful Gout.
               So that the right doo touch the right
               and that the left doo lye:
               Upon the left, ſo ſhalt thou finde

And take thou héed that at thy boord,

               The Lamprey long agone was had,
               in eſtimation great:
               And taken for his daintie taſte,
               to be a Princes meat.
               
                  Antonia (Druſus wife) was wunt,
               the Lamprey for to féed:
               
                  
And ſet her out with rings of golde,
               the farther to excéed:
               A Lampry dead Hortenſius did
               bewaile with many a teare:
               Such was the fauour of the great
               goodwil that he did beare.
               But medle not with it whoſoeuer
               thou art that haſt the gout:
               For why, it dooth increaſe thy paines,
               and brings thy gréef about.
               In fewe woords for to make an end,
               For who can all things touch:
               In this diſeaſe much helthſomer
               is fleſh, then fiſh by much.
               Take for your drink the mildeſt wine,
               and cléereſt you can get:
               And mingle it with water wel,
               the fume away to fet.
               What quantitie you ought to drink,
               I néed not heer define:
               Your own diſcretion héerin beſt,
               a meaſure may aſſigne.
               But this I onely warn you of,
               that when you leaue your meat:
               You leaue with ſome deſire to drink,
               and ſome deſire to eat.
               Then féed on Coliander ſéeds,
               when thus you wel haue fed:
               
                  
To make a mery hart and kéep
               the vapours from the hed.
               Giue not thy ſelf to too much sléep,
               nor watch not all the night:
               And let ſome diſtance be betwixt,
               thy ſleepe and ſupper light.
               Lye not vpon the back for this
               is for the body nought:
               But very ſeldome vſe to ride,
               take neuer any thought.
               Somtime it ſhall be good awhile,
               to paſſe the time away:
               To hear the pleaſant inſtrument,
               of ſuch as wel can play.
               Nothing then Muſick, more our gréef
               and ſorowes baniſh can:
               It glads the minde, and mery minde
               dooth make a helthy man.
               Far from thée look thou euer haue▪
               
               all grim and ſollemne Syers.
               All louring lumpiſh lookes that lothe,
               bequeath them to the Fryers.
               Make choyſe of ſuch companions, as
               be wiſe and ſwéet withall:
               Whoſe talke delightful is to hear,
               and voide of any gall.
               Whoſe grauitie is poudred with,
               an honeſt pleaſant minde:
               
                  
Not tedious to the hearer, nor
               vain waſter of his winde.
               Take ſuch into thy company,
               eſchue the fléering mate:
               The flatterer, and ſuch as where
               they come doo ſo we debate.
               Use alwaes holſome exerciſe,
               thy féet to walke aſſay:
               This exerciſe conſumes and waſtes
               the humors il away.
               For long and ſlothful Idlenes,
               decayes the members all:
               And dooth diſgrace the body quite,
               And cauſeth it to fall.
               And like as Iron ruſteth ſtraight,
               with lothſome Canker vile:
               If that you ſuffer it to reſt
               and vſe it not a while.
               So are our bodyes ſtraight defilde,
               and vnto miſchéef fall:
               If that we let them idle be,
               and woork them not at all.
               Beſide a pitious ſight it is,
               a lamentabie caſe:
               In ſée the King of Creatures all
               lye lame and not haue grace.
               Nor wil to exerciſe him ſelf,
               but Idle ſtil to bée:
               
                  
And through his owne great fault & blame,
               to want his libertie.
               By little and little try thy ſtrength,
               with certain rule and rate:
               Which force with labour wil increaſe,
               ſo it be moderate.
               Auoid the aire that flameth ſtil,
               with ouerſcorching heat:
               And that which ouercolde the members all
               dooth il intreat.
               If theſe my rules you doo obſerue
               I truſt you ſoon ſhall ſée:
               This cruel raging Gout, as ſhe
               deſerues deſtroyd to bée.
               Inough now haue we tryed the féelde,
               the Trumpet bids retire:
               Héer ſtands the bownds of mine exployt

            A Dialogue betwixt the Gout and Cri. Baliſta.
            
               Gout.
               
                  ALas poor wretch alas, which way
               now ſhall I turn my ſight:
               whil as ſo great a ſtorme of darts
               doo ful vpon me light?
               O hapleſſe wretch whome lews aſpects,
               of hateful ſtarres haue torne:
               Accurſed be the lothſome day:
               that euer I was borne.
               All pearſt with darts I am and knowe
               not how my ſelf to ſaue:
               My ioynts are all benummed ſo,
               and neuer a foot I haue:
               What fauour more hath nature ſhowed,
               to beaſts then vnto me:
               That hath ordained them a meane
               to kéep their libertie?
               Oft times the Stag dooth laugh to ſcorne
               the Hunter and his Hound:
               The Bore dooth laugh and euery beaſt,
               that in the woods are found.
               And why? for truſting to their féet
               they ſcape the dangers all:
               Good féet dooth many times preuent,
               great miſchéefs that would fall.
               
                  
But I alas more ſlowly mooue,
               then any Tortoiſe great:
               And lame and feeble as Ilye,
               the darts vpon me beat.
               What now remaines? but that to hel
               pale death me down dooth caſt:
               And make an end of this my life,
               that may no longer laſt.
               Alas and ſhall I dye?
            
            
               B.
               Thou ſhalt.

               Me.

               Thy greateſt fo.
            
            
               G.
               What is thy name?
               what Region camſt thou from?
            
            
               B.
               My name Baliſta is.
            
            
               G.
               Why dooſt

               B.
               To make thée dye.
            
            
               G.
               I not deſerue
               ſo great extremitie.

               A thouſand Gallowſes thou doſt,

               A thuſand racks, a thouſand whéeles,
               and after death dooth fall.
               A thouſand Helles thon dooſt deſerue,
               I haue not long to tel:
               The ſundry ſortes of torments that
               thou haſt deſerued wel.

               Tel me the cauſe.
            
            
               B.
               The cauſe is this
               that men of worthy fame:
               Thou with thy miſchéeuous diſeaſe,
               haſt plagued and ſtricken lame.
            
            
               
               G.
               Whō haue I plagued?
            
            
               B.
               Whōe? it were
               to much for me to tel:
               Alas I am not able for
               to ſtay from wéeping wel.
               Beſides a number that thou wretched
               beaſt, baſt lamed quite:
               While in tormenting of their ioynts,
               thou ſhewds thy cruel ſpite.
               The good Sedunian Biſhop thou
               haſte cauſed down to fall:
               And ouercome, dooſt kéep him yet
               in priſon, as thy thrall.
               Whoſe worthy life dooth gliſter like,

               Him haſt thou in thy ſhackles ſhut,
               and tyed vp in thy teames.
               And therfore dye yu ſhalt.
            
            
               G.
               For pittie yet

               That can I not.

               B.
               I wil be vnto thée.

               O ſpare me yet I thée beſéeche,

               And wel ſhall haue his helth again,
               and walke at libertie.
            
            
               B.
               I more deman̄d.
            
            
               G.
               Whats that?
            
            
               B.
               That thou
               foule beaſt, doo neuer tuch:
               The limmes of any vertuous man,
               nor trouble any such.
            
            
               
               G.
               To this I graunt.
            
            
               B.
               I warne thée look,

               Thy members els aſunder wil,

               G.
               Whome wilt thou licence me, with
               ſhackels ſharp to take and binde?
            
            
               B.
               For that theſe words that I ſhall ſay
               to thée lay vp in minde.
               Firſt ſet thy ſhackels vpon ſuch,
               as alwaies fight and brall:
               And murther on an other ſtil,
               for euery trifle ſmall.
               Whoſe féet are euer forward, for
               to rome vnto the ſwoord:
               Contrary to the ſwéet decrée,
               of Chriſte our ſauiours woord.
            
            
               G.
               But may I be ſo bolde to touch,
               the féet of mightie Kings?
            
            
               B.
               Yea hardly for thence the roof,
               of all this miſchéef ſprings.
               what Region can you finde where Mars,
               
               his Banner hath not ſpred?
               What Cuntrie now that is not with
               the blood of Chriſtians red?
               For what ſo euer the ambitious mindes,
               of Princes foorth dooth bring:

Go fetter thou their féet with bolts,
               that neuer wil away:
               Except they ceaſſe their madneſſe ſoone,
               and from their follyes ſtay.

               B.
               The burſton bellyed lout:
               To him that ſcarce for fat can beare,
               his lothſome guts about.
            
            
               G.
               I neuer medle with the paunch,
            
            
               B.
               The paunches ſuch I call:
               As féed them ſelues vntil they be,
               as fat as Oxe in ſtall.
               And nether feed with word nor life,
               the ſhéep they ought to ſerue:
               But ſlothful beaſts doo leaue their flock
               for hunger like to ſterue.
            
            
               G.
               And ſhall I touch no more but theſe?
            
            
               B.
               Yes, ſuch as vſe to ſweare:

               their ioynts in ſunder teare.
               And for auoyding many woords,
               I thus conclude with thée:
               For beare the vertuous and the good,
