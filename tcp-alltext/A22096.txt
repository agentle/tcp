               ❧A Proclamation for the continuance of
His Maiesties Farthing Tokens.
            
               
                  WHereas the Kings most Excellent Maiestie
for the suppressing of the manifold abuses, in passing of Farthing
Tokens, of Lead, Brasse, Copper, and other Mettall,
betweene Uintners, Tapsters, Chandlers, Bakers, and
other the like Tradesmen, and their Customers; did publish
His Proclamation, bearing Date at White-Hall, the nineteenth
day of May, in the eleuenth yeere of His Maiesties
Reigne, of Great Britaine, France and Ireland, As a prouident Remedie of the said abuses;
whereby his Maiestie did prohibite the vttering of all Farthing Tokens whatsoeuer,
and was pleased to giue full power, and authority, to Iohn Lord Harrington, his
Executors, or Assignes, to make, or cause to be made, such a Competent quantity of Farthing
Tokens of Copper, as might be conueniently vsed within his Realmes of England,
and Ireland, and Dominions of Wales, according to His Highnesse Letters Patents
vnder the Great Seale, for the sole making and vttering thereof, as by the saide
Proclamation, and Letters Patents, more at large it doth appeare. Now forasmuch
as His Maiestie is informed, that vpon the death of the said Lord Harrington, the elder,
and more especially vpon the death of the late Lord Harrington his Sonne, by meanes of
some false bruits spread abroad, by lewd and euill disposed persons, some doubt is made
of the continuance of the force of the said Proclamation, and the vse of the said Farthing
Tokens of Copper: insomuch that thereupon some not well disposed, doe either refuse
to vse them, or doe continue to vtter their owne Tokens, of Brasse, Copper, and other
Mettall, or matter, contrary to the true intent of His Maiesties said Graunt, and Prohibition,
and of the said Proclamation, whereby the said abuses, and the licencious vse of

them doth in some part stil continue; His Maiesty therfore finding how acceptable the said
Farthing Tokens, made by the said Lord Harrington and his Assignes, haue beene to his
Maiesties Subiects, vnto whose hands they haue come, and especially about the Citie
of London, and most chiefly for the reliefe of the poore, indigent, and poorer sort of
people; Hath thought fit by this His second Proclamation, to publish his Royall pleasure,
for the continuance of the force of the said Proclamation, and the confirmation of
His said Letters Patents to the Lady Anne Harrington widow, late wife of Iohn Lord
Harrington, the Patentee deceased, and Executrix of the last Will, and Testament of Iohn
Lord Harrington her Sonne likewise deceased, and to her Assignes, and for the continuance
of the said Farthing Tokens of Copper accordingly.
            And doeth therefore by these Presents, not onely publish and declare his Highnesse
will and pleasure, That the said Farthing Tokens of Copper, shall continue without
any alteration of the Stampe or Print now vsed; And shall, and may passe amongst
his louing Subiects, according to the tenour of the sayd former Proclamation; but also
doeth straitly prohibite and forbid all, and euery person and persons whatsoeuer,
aswell to vse or receiue any Tokens whatsoeuer (other then the Farthing Tokens
made and vttered by the said Lord Harrington the Patentee, or the said Lord Harrington
his sonne, their or either of their Assignes, or made, or to bee made by the said Lady
Anne Harrington her Assignee or Assignes, and vttered, or to bee vttered, as aforesaid) as
also to make, or counterfeit such Farthing Tokens of Copper, or the Engines or
Instruments, whereby they are to bee made, according to the Tenour and true meaning
of his Maiesties said Letters Patents, and former Proclamation in that behalfe;
Willing and commanding all his louing Subiects▪ to vse their best endeauours
for the finding out and apprehending of the said offenders in the Premisses, who shall
be well rewarded for the same, and the offenders receiue condigne punishment.
            
               Giuen at Our Manour of Greenewich, the one and twentieth day of Iune, in
the twelfth yeere of Our Reigne of Great Britaine, France, and Ireland.
               
God saue the King.
