These general considerations mouing other to indict and penne stories, moued me also to gather together and to regester for memorie the merueilous practise of Wyat his detestable rebelliō, litle inferior to the most daūgerous reported in any historie, either for desperate courage in the authour, or for the mōstruous end purposed by his rebellion. Yet I thought nothyng

lesse at the begining, then to publishe the same at this time or at this age, minding onely to gather notes therof where the truth mought be best knowen, (for the which I made earnest and diligent inuestigation) and to leaue them to be published by others hereafter to the behof of our posteritie. But hearing the sundry tales thereof farre dissonaūt in the vtteraunce, & many of them as far wide frō truth, facioned from the speakers to aduaunce or depraue as they fantased the parties: and vnderstādyng besydes what notable infamie spronge of this rebelliō to the whole countre of Kent, & to euery mēbre of ye same, where sundrie & many of them to mine owne knowledge shewed them

selues most faythfull & worthy subiectes, as by ye storie self shal euidently appeare, which either of hast or of purpose were omitted in a printed booke late sette furth at Cāterbury: I thought these to be speciall cōsideratiōs, wherby I ought of duetie to my countrey to compyle and digest suche notes as I had gathered cōcerning that rebellion, in some forme and fashion of historie, & to publishe the same in this age and at this present, contrary to my first intent, as well that the very truth of that rebellious enterprise mought be throughly knowen, as that also the sheire where that vile rebellion was practised, might by opening the full truth in some parte be deliuered frō the infamy whiche as

by report I heare is made so general in other shyres, as though very fewe of Kent were free frō Wyates conspiracie: most humblie beseching your highnes to take this my traueil in so good and gracious parte, as of your graces benigne & gentle nature it hath pleased you to accept my former bookes dedicated vnto your highnes. Wherby I mynde nothinglesse then to excuse or accuse any affectionately, but to set furth eche mannes doynges truely according to their demerites, that by the cōtemplation hereof both the good may be incouraged in the execution of perfite obedience & vnspotted loyaltie, and the wicked restrained from the hatefull practice of suche detestable purposes.

hys owne wordes at sundrie times shall hereafter appeare.

geue vs then your hande, we wyll sticke to you to deathe in this quarell. That done, there came to hym one other of good wealthe, saying: Syr quod he, they saye I loue potage well, I wyll sell all my spones, and all the plate in my house, rather than your purpose shall quayle, and suppe my potage with my mouthe. I trust, quod he, you wyll restore the right religion agayne. Whiste quod Wyat, you may not so much as name religion, for that wil withdraw from vs the heartes of manye:Wyates owne wordes to proue heresy to be the ground of his rebellion. you must only make your quarrell for ouerrunnyng by straungers. And yet to thee be it sayd in counsell, as vnto my frende, we mynde only the restitution of Gods word. But no wordes.

By these his wordes it appeared, that his principall intent was not to kepe out straūgers, whiche commonlye doe not inuade to oure hinderaunce, but by rebellion amongest our selues: nor to aduaunce libertye, whiche euer decayeth through treason: but to aduaunce heresye, the Lady regent of his life and doinges.

               The Shreifes answere to the messenger that brought Wyates letter.
               NEyghbour Monde, rather to satisfie your importunitie, thē to answer Wyates letter, whom in this case I disdaine to answere, or to speake with you apart cōming from a traytour, you may say vnto him that as in dede I haue been desierous of his frendship for neighbourhoodes sake, so haue I muche more desired his reformation in diuers pointes of great disordre, wherby he certainly

knew aswell by my spech to him selfe, as other meanes cōming to his knowledge, that I haue sithens the beginning of the Quenes reigne holden him and some of his coleges in this cōspiracie vehemently suspected for like matters as nowe they haue attempted. Wherein seyng he hath not deceiued me, but by opening him self hath manifestly verified myne opinion conceiued of him, I purpose not to purchase his frendship so deare, as for the gaine of him to lose my self & my posteritie in perpetual infamye. And if suche thinges whiche his fonde headde hath wayed for perilles, to the condempnation of the whole wisedome of the realme (thei allowing the same for good) had been

in dede as perillous, as he with others, for want of due consideration, demeth them, his duetie had been to haue opened his opinion therein as an humble & reuerent peticioner to the Quenes highnes, or to some of her graces counsell. But to presse his soueraigne in any suite or vpon any occasion with weapon & armour by sturring her subiectes to rebelliō, that is and alwaies hath been accompted the parte of most arrogant and presumptuous traytours, and so do I note him and his mates as you may tell them, & shall God willing prouide for thē accordingly. Nowe goodman Monde it shalbe in your choyse whether you will carie this message or no. But as your frende I shall

aduise you to seeke out better company. The messenger excusing himselfe by ignoraunce, departed to Wyat with answere. And sone after returned to the

And as they met wt suche as had serued faiethfully (with whō they durst be frāke) thei spared not to opē their mouthes largely, powring out such language as coulde be but lamentable, or rather odible to euerie true eare, tunderstande any subiecte so farre peruerted from his allegiaūce and duetie, that for gaine or securitie of their owne persones, would reioyce in sittinge still as indifferent, where the crown is a

On thother side the true and faiethful, whose hartes and handes such dimme colour of vnthankefull policie coulde not witholde frō the vtteraunce of nedefull seruice in such generall case of daunger, thought it rather a gaine to aduenture bodye and goodes, wherby either to preserue the heade and the wholle, which was cruelly pursued,

or at least by defense of the same to purchace vnto them & their names the honest opinion of vnspotted membres, and the imortalitie of good fame, wherwith trueth alwaies rewardeth vnfained seruice. For such an in comparable vertue is faiethfull loyaltie, so muche abhorring all corruptible allurementes, that whose hartes shee hathe in gouernaunce, with suche neither sauour of gaine, nor hope of securitie, neyther persuasion of frendeshippe, ne other intisement can so muche preuaile, as for any respect they wil digresse from the right course of true seruice.

            ¶An earnest conference with the degenerates and sedicious, for the searche of the cause of their greate disorder.

in desire to rebel. Al which pointes this present storie doeth plē
               teouslye performe to him that listeth to learne. Wherby first y• good and godly may be comforted, as by this experimente, to consider howe God alwayes defendethe his chosen and electe vessell, our moost gracious and mercifull princesse, against the malitious and cruell assaultes of her ennemies, be they neuer so craftie, neuer so stronge. And secondlye a generall doctrine therewith taughte, or rather by newe experience renued, so many times taughte before, that the ineuitable end of rebellion is certein confusion to the rebel. Of these two ye thirde necessarely springeth, as a terrible prohibition in the heartes of the

If then your soueraygne ought without your interruption to enioye that you can not endure to be denied to youre selues (I meane the free choise of mariage,) if also the same be confirmed by them, vnto whome for their authoritie you are bounde to geue place:
