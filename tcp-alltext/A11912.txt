            ¶ The Preface to the Reader.
            
               IF I had not gentle Reader a better truste in thy gentlenesse, then affyance in myne owne weakenesse, I had not assayed thys second attempte, to bewraye my rudenesse and ignoraunce, vnto thy skilfull iudgemente: but though I mystrusted my selfe, yet I so reposed my hope in thee, that it gaue me corage to trāslate this one Tragedie more of SENECA, for the pleasure of the learned, and the profyte of the vnlearned by readynge of it in theyr natyue language. What kynde of Tragedie it is, or what is to be learned therby, I nede not stand at large to dyscusse, beinge so playnly set furthe by SENECA, far better then I am able to showe or translate it, so worthelye as he hath wrytten it: yet as God hath gyuen me grace, rudely and symply I haue performed it: And bycause that all thynge myght be to the better vnderstandyng and commodytye of the vnlearned, as in some places I do expoūd at large the darke sence of the Poet: so haue I chaunged the fyrste

               Chorus, because in it I sawe nothyng but an heape of prophane storyes, and names of prophane Idoles: therfore I haue altered the whole matter of it, begynnynge thus: Who hath not wist. Diuers reasons could I aledge to mayntayne thys myne alteracion, but I truste thy gentlenes wyll waye it to the vttermoste, and take all thynges in better parte. Thus I byd thee farewell.

               MY shyuerynge minde amazed is,

               My chyllysh lyms with quakyng colde
               doe tremble all afrayde.
               Such plagues & vengeance is at hande
               in what excedyng wyse
               Do sharpe assaultes of gredye greife

               Ofte haue I seene how rampyng rage
               hath forced her to freate.
