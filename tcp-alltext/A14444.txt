Thus wold they knowe the reson of that. that they sawe so meue the sterres of the firmament & of them that shone so clere. Certaynly this was the princyial cause whi first they put them to studye for tenquere the science that they knewe not.

But we may not now reherce alle the goode thynges that they sayde For they were prudent alle and valyant. seen that they set to fore alle other thinges clergye / For yf it were not by clergye / men shold not knowe that god were / And yf they had not ben so prudent men as they were ther had neuer be so grete clergye as is now / And yf ther were now suche as they were thenne that founde first clergye / It sholde be other wyse than it now is / But clergye goth now all to

noght that almost it is perysshid. For in thise dayes ye people seeth not by cause that they that ought vnderstande vertues & to teche other & enseyne & gyue example to doo well they ben they that recule & wythdrawe fro it.

And the clowde that alwaye so longe abydeth and taketh more moysture / so longe after / that it becometh black and moyste / Thenne yssueth out the water whiche cometh to therthe / and thus groweth the rayne. And whan it is alle fallen to therthe. and the grete moysture is staunched the clowde hath lost his broun colour that he byfore helde and the derkenesse of whiche she empesshid the day. Thenne aperith the clowde clere and whyte whiche thenne is lyght and mounteth on hye somoche that in thende she falleth and is deffeted by the hete of the sonne on hye whiche al dreyeth vp / Thenne thayer wexeth agayn pure and clere / and the heuen as blew as azure / Of therthe groweth the rayn and the clowdes also / as of cloth that is weet / and shold be dreyed by the fyre. thēne yssueth therof a moysture lyke a smoke or fumee and gooth vpward. who thenne helde his hande ouer the fumee / he shold fele a vapour whiche shold make his hande moyst and weet / Yf it dured longe he shold appertly knowe that his hande were alle weet / and that water shold droppe and falle therof / And thus I saye to yow that in this maner growe ofte the clowdes and raynes / and our lord god multyplyeth wel them whan it pleseth hym for to make the seedes and fruytes growe that ben on therthe /

And this is the shadowe of the nyght whiche ye deduyt of the day taketh away from vs / But for as moche as the sonne is moche gretter that therthe. the shadowe goth lytyll and lytyl tyl at thende it cometh to nought / lyke the sown of a clocke endureth after the stroke / But yf the sonne and therthe were of one lyke gretenesse. this shadowe shold haue none ende / but shold be all egal wythout declynyng. and yf therthe were gretter than the sonne thenne the shadowe oe the sonne shold goo enlargyng & be more as ye may see the fourme by thyse thre fygures folowyng. & also ye may preue it otherwyse wythout fygures / Take somme derke thynge that may reteyne lyght wythin it as of tree or of stone or other thynge what it be that may be sen thurgh thē

For somtyme she passeth in her cours by suche away that therthe shadoweth her alle / For therthe is gretter than the mone is / & therfore whan therthe is iuste bytwene the sōne and the mone thēne she thus shadoweth her / For bytwene the sonne & the mone is a lygne whiche declyneth so moche to the mone by whiche the sonne smyteth his rayes in her as longe as ther is no letting by therthe / For the more that ther is bytwene them the more is ye mone shadowed / And the lasse that it is bytwene somoche lasse is the shadowe / & the mone leseth the lasse of her light that she receyueth of the sonne / whan she is so shadowed / Thus ye may vnderstonde / yf a lygne passed thurgh therthe by the poynt of the myddle of it / & stratched that one ende vnto the body of the sonne in suche wyse by right sight that it endured on that other ende vnto the mone / whiche euery moneth goth here and there. hyer and lower / yf she were se euen ayenst the sonne / thenne shold

For it gooth as to decline. and is called in latin eclipsis / This eclipse procedeth by cause of defaulte of lyght / and it happeth in this manere that whan the mone whiche is vnder the sonne cometh right bytwene vs and the sonne / thenne in the right lygne it behoueth ye toward vs ye mone taketh & reteyneth the lyght of ye sonne on hye / so that it semeth to vs that is defaylled / for the mone is not so pure that the sonne may shyne ouer her / & thurgh her as thurgh an other sterre / alle like as a cādel / whiche is sette ferre fro your sight / & after ye helde your honde right to fore the candel. thēne ye shold not see nothyng therof / & the more right ye hold your hand bytwene / the more lasse shold ye see this candel / & so moche ye may sette your hand ryght to fore your eyen & so ferre that ye shold see nothyng therof. In this maner I telle yow of the Eclypse that bytwene the Sonne and the Mone is not one waye comune / But the mone gooth an other

waye whiche destourneth her a lytyl from the Sonne. Wherfore vs behoueth to vnderstande that the mone gooth oftymes whan she is bytwene vs and the sonne somtyme aboue and otherwhile bynethe / here and there as she ryseth and declyneth / But whan she passyth in the right lygne euen bytwene vs and the sonne thenne taketh the mone fro vs the lyght and clernes of the sonne in suche wyse as we may not clerly see her in that paas / For thenne shadoweth she therthe / And kepeth the raynes of the sonne that they may not shyne on therthe / And they that ben in this parte / haue in their syght the shadowe behynde them / But it apperyth not comunely to alle men thurgh al the world For the mone is not so grete nowher nygh as all therthe therfor she shadoweth not all but only where she is in the right lygne bytwene therthe and the sonne / And thyder the philosophers were wont to goo where as they knewe it / For by their wyt and studye they had lerned for to approue the daye and tyme whan suche thynges sholde happe By whiche they preuyd plente of thynges wherfore they preysed moche our lord / Thu

Alle dyuersitees that be in persones and whiche haue dyuersitees of makyng and of corsage and alle that happeth by nature / be it in herbes / in plantes or in beestes. this happeth by the vertue celestyal whiche god gaf to the sterres. Whan he first created the world / And that he sette them & endowed them wyth suche nature that he ordeyned them to goo roūd aboute the world ayenst the tornyng of the firmament / And by their tornyng and by their vertu whiche lyeth in heuen. lyue alle thynges that ben vnder it / And yf it pleasyd our lord that he wold holde the heuen all stylle in suche wyse that it torned not aboute. ther is nothing in alle the world / that myght meue him. In hym shold be no vnderstondyng nomore than in a dede body. whiche feleth nothyng ne therin is no wytte ne vnderstandyng ne moeuyng as he that hath no lyf / in suche poynt / shal euery thynge be whan the heuen shal leue his moeuyng.

                  ces in other men that myght not remeue them / For yf ther were no meuyng on the heuen / ther is nothyng that myght lyue on erthe. Also god wyl that it so be that all thyng hath establysshid by right / Thus was the wylle of god in whom alle vertues habounde for to fourme the world / For he made ne created neuer thynge but that he gaf to it suche vertue as it ought to haue / ellis he had made somthyng for nought & without reson / but he dyde not so for he neuer faylled in no thynge / he made and created alle the sterres & gaf to euerich his vertue & who yt wyll not byleue. thus In him is nether memoyre ne reson / For we see openly that the mone taketh lyght whan we see her all full. for the man hath thenne neyther membre ne vayne / but that it is full whan it is in the cours of humours and suche thynges & in lyke wyse it happeth on alle bestes. For they haue thenne their hedes and other membres more garnysshid of margh & of humeurs / And the see also floweth & ebbeth in his cours euery moneth wherof it happeth that they that ben nygh ye see whan they knowe that the mone is ful they wythdrawe them fro the see on hye. And saue them & theyre meynage. and in this poynt they wythdrawe them and holde them in hye places vnto the tyme that the see wythdraweth and lasseth agayn. And thus do they euery moneth. But alle this happeth by the mone whiche is one of the seuen planetes / In lyke wyse is it seen of the sonne. that after the wynter whan he begynneth to mounte / he causeth the fruyt to be brought forth of therthe / and appparylleth the trees wyth

leues. and alle verdure to come agayn. And the byrdes begynne agayn their songe for the swetenes of the new tyme. And whan he rebasshith and declyneth / he maketh the wynter to begynne and causeth flowres and leuis to falle and falle so longe tyl he begynne to mounte agayn as to fore is sayd. Syth that thyse two sterres haue suche vertues / and cause suche thynges to be don / The other whiche ben pourtrayed on the heuen / were not made to serue of nought / But to eueriche is ordeyned his vertue and his right after his nature. Wherfore they make dyuersitees in thynges that ben on therthe / And the moeuynges of tyme / of whiche that one cometh soone and that other late / And the fruytes that come on therthe. Somme come sone and erly and the other late and ben otherwhyle sooner rype in one yere that in an other. And more assured of tempestes & other greuaunces / And thus chaunge in sondry maners. For one somer is softe and moyste / And another is drye and wyndy / Of the wynter it happeth oftymes that they chaūge / so that one is colde / rayny and more desplaysaunt than ye other / And another shal be more Ioyous & lasse damageable / Thus is seen that the one is dere of somme vytaylle or other thynges And that other shal be plentyuous And also it is ofte that ther is plente and good chepe in one yere / In another yere it is had in grete chierte / and is of grete scarset

                   this fallyth somtyme and ofte.

mounteth as moche and as hye in one somer as in another And as moche descendeth in one wynter as in another euery day egally tyl that he come in to / his right poynt / And Ioyneth that other after hym where he was to fore / this knowe well Astronomyers that he gooth euery yere aboute the heuen one torne. And where he is this day in the same place he shal be this day a yere. Ther by is it knowen that if none other hath no power thēne shold euery yere be lyke other. & euery yere alway shold be lyke as the yere to fore was / and euery moneth shold be lyke the same as eueriche shold come / that is to wyte / one Ianyuer lyke another Ianyuer / and feuerer lyke another feuerer / and in lyke wyse alle the other x. moneths / For the sonne gooth alle lyke in one moneth / As he shal the next yere in the same moneth.

               ¶Of the kynge Tholomeus and of somme other philosophers / Capitulo xo.
               THolomeus was a kynge moche subtyl in Astronomye. This tholomeus was kynge of egipte whiche helde the contree longe tyme / Ther were somtyme many kynges that were named Tholomeus / But emonge the other this was he that knewe most of Astronomye and that most enserched of the sterres / and more vnderstode of them than the other / of whiche he composed and made plente of right fayr volumes and bookes / And many dyuerse instrumentes by whiche was foūde appertly alle the gretenes of therthe / And the heyght of the firmament / And how the sterres make their cours bothe by nyght and by daye / By hym were founden first the oryloges of the chirches whiche begynne the houres of the dayes and of the nyghtes / The dayes passe fast on wherfor the chirches haue grete nede to haue good orloges. for to doo therby alway the seruyse of our lord at hour competent and due as well by day as by nyght. For god loueth moche for to be adoured and seruyd entyerly and ordynatly euery day / 

For the Orysons that ben sayd and receyted euery day in the chirches playse more to our lord than do they that ben sayde in many other places / And therfor the oryloges ben necessarye in euery chirche. And men serue god the better in due tyme and fare the better / and lyue the lenger. For yf they ruled soo them self to praye at a certayn hour / And at an other hour in lyke wyse to ete. & other thinges in his right hour / it shold be a lyght thynge to doo & plese god Yf men wold applye them as wel to suche thynges. as they do to do that whiche confoūdeth and sleeth them that is to wete that they be al enclyned to conquere the richesses / of whiche they cesse not nyght ne daye. And wenen to prolonge their lyf therby / But they amasse and gete grete tresours / and pourchasse their deth / For by ye grete goodes that they assemble on alle sydes / they put them in suche thought and payne that they lese ofte their wytte & vnderstandyng. and also their mynde so that they may not enclyne and thinke on thoo werkes that towche their saluaciō as they ought to doo / & by suche werkes shold they be in more ease & lyue lenger and plese better our lord. And shold also haue more helthe of body and of sowle / but they loue somoche the wynnyng of the goodes of the world / that they leue that whiche shold more auayle and prouffyte them. ¶I wote neuer wherfore they gete this hauoir and good. For they lose therby the ease of the worlde / bycause whan they wene to sette them in ease and to be in pees / Thenne cometh deth and maketh them to deye wyth ryght grete sorowe. For the grete couetyse of the good and the payne that they haue made alle way to gete it wythout ordynaunce and mesure hath moche the more hastelyer brought them to their deth And so ben many men deed / that yf they had ordeyned

their affayres and besynesse as they ought to doo at euery hour competently and by ordre / whiche yet had ben a lyue & in good helthe / And lo thus ye may see how they abredge their dayes and auaunce their deth / For at longe nature may not suffre dyuerse mayntenes vnresonable ne the sodeyn agrauacions ne griefs / of whiche by their folyes they trauaylle nature. and it displesyth moche vnto god. And also no good may come therof / But gladlyer and wyth better wyll they traueylle and more dylygently for to wynne and gete the worldly goodes. than the loue of god / And neuer do they thynge by ordre. One day goon they erly to the chirche. and another day late or at suche an hour / as they wene that it shal not hurte them to auaunce their gayne & wynnyng / Thus go they neuer to chirche for to praye vnto god vnto the tyme that they wene that they shal wynne nomore worldly goodes. But they wynne the lasse / For they serue god in vayn / And god shal rendre to them their reward. and they shal bye right dere that they leue to serue hym / For he may rendre to them more meryte in one day. than they may gete in a thousand yere. Suche people ben foles and euyl aduysed. whan of nought they wene to serue hym that alle knoweth and all seeth. ye the lest thought that they thynke yet ben ther somme / whan they go to chirche they goo not in entencion to praye god but only for to gete the loos and goodes of the world. And praye more for their richesses. that god sholde kepe and multyplye them than they do for the saluacion of their sowles whiche ben in grete parylle to be perysshed. And it is a grete meruaylle of suche maner of people / that thynke wel in their hertes and knowe wel that it is euyl that they do / yet for al that they amende them not▪ of whiche it is grete pyte

Whan the philosophers sawe this / they dyde so moche that they establisshed wyth the lordes somtyme regnyng / a lytyl lyght thynge whiche eueri man myght bere wyth hym to bye that was nedeful to hym and behoefful for his lyf. and so ordeyned by aduyse to gydre a thyng whiche was not ouer dere ne holden for ouer vyle.

Monos in grekyssh langage is as moche to saye. as one thyng only / For thenne was but one maner of monoye in all ye world But now euery man maketh monoye at his playsir by whiche they desuoye and goo out of the waye more than yf ther were but one coyne only / For by this cause is seen ofte plente of dyuerse monoyes. Thus establysshed not the philosophers / For they establysshed for to saue the state of the world. And I saye it for as moche yf the monoye were out of grotes & pens of siluer so thenne it shold be of lasse

For the monoyes be not preysed but for the gold and siluer that is therin / And they that establisshed it first / made it right lytyl and lyght / For the more ease to be born al aboute. where men wold goo. for now In late dayes as in the begynnyng of the regne of kynge Edward & longe after was no monoye curraunt in Englond but pens and half pens and ferthynges.

For the good amendeth al wayes / And who that customly doth gladly the good werkes / they ben the cause to lede hym to heuene / as he that hath none other wythdraughte ne other dwellyng place / And therfor he muste enhabyte there / hym behoueth to come in to heuene for to reteyne there his place / and also for to fylle it

Ther is noman in the worlde that can doo so moche good but that he shal alway fynde his place / and his repayre propyce after his merites. ffor as moche as this so moche noble a place is withoute ende and wythout terme in suche wise that no goodes what someuer they be shal neuer haue terme ne ende. ne neuer shal haue defaulte. but it is contynuelly ful of alle consolacion / of alle delices of alle goodes of alle Ioye and of alle gladnesse / wythout hauyng ony thynge voyde. Of whiche they that deserue it of our lord shal haue ful possession of alle the inestimable goodes. ¶Of helle I may frely saye to you. that ther is nothyng sauf sorowe & martyrdom / truly the most anguysshous the most horrible & so moche sorowful that ther is no like And yf so were that the chyldren that haue ben syth. Adam were all dampned yet it myght not be fylled by them / though they were twyes so many more / & they that be theryn perisshed▪ shal be dampned and perpetuelly tormented. ffor after that they be dampned they shal abyde euer as longe as god shal be whiche is wythout begynnyng and wythout endyng And there they shal brenne in fyre eternel withoute hope of alegeaunce of ony mercy of ony hope to haue ony better but alleway werse fro tyme. to tyme / as it is so that the saued sowles desire ye day of dome and of iugemēt for to be gloryfied in body and sowle / The dampned sowles redoubte and drede it thynkynge that after that day they shal be perpetuelly tormented in body and in sowle. And to that dredeful day they be not tormented in the body / but in the sowle / ¶And I haue recyted this thinge shortly to this ende that it may be knowen certaynly that ther is no good deede but it shal be rewarded ne none euyl dede but that it shal be punysshed This is the wille of the creatour And maker of all thynges wythoute whom ther is none that in ony maner hath ony power /

This is that gyueth to vs his colour blew. the whiche estendeth aboue thayer. the whiche we see whan thayer is pure and clere all aboute / And it is of so grete attemperaunce / that it may haue no violence. this is the heuen that encloseth the firmament / Now I shal saye yow all appertly▪ that this that ye may vnderstonde here tofore. by heeryng. may not be taken ne knowen / ne be proued yf it be trouthe or non. ne may not be by ony arte of demonstraunce. lyke as may be seen by eyen.
