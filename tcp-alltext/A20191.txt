            A PASTIME
for Parents to bee vſed with their
children for recreation, to paſſe away
the time; containing the
moſt principall grounds of
Chriſtian religion.
            
            
               Father.
               VVHat is God?
            
            
               Child.
               An infinite perfection,Iob. 11. 7. whoſe
being is of himſelfe.
            
            
               Father.
               Where is God?
            
            
               Child.
               Alwaies euery where,Pſal. 139. as the aire.
            
            
               Father.
               Whether is the Godhead a thing onely
imaginarie or no?
            
            
               Child.
               The Godhead is not a thing which
onely may bée conceiued in thought,Exod. 3.
                  
but indéed is a moſt pure and infinite
ſelfebeing.
            
            
               Father.
               How then doe you conceiue of the
eſſence, and being of the Godhead?
            
            
               Child.
               That the ſubſtance or eſſence of
the dietie is of all things moſt ſimple
and ſingle, and is neither diuided,
multiplyed, nor compact of any elementarie
qualitie.
            
            
               Father.
               Expreſſe your minde morefully.
            
            
               Child.
               This I meane, that the diuine nature
is one, ſimple, vniforme, immateriall,
impaſſible, immutable, illocall,
eternall, omnipotent, omniſcient,
infinite, void of al mixture, cōpoſition,
combinatiō, diuiſion, or diſſimilitude.
            
            
               Father.
               Which be the proper and eſſentiall
attributes of God?
            
            
               Child.
               The proper attributes of God are
vbiquitie, eternitie, vnitie, ſimplicitie,

omnipotency: for theſe do ſpring
from his eſſence and forme, as naturally,
neceſſarily and directly, as the
beames, light, & heat, iſſue from the
Sunne, as the ſtreames from a fountaine
of water.
            
            
               Father.
               Can theſe eſſentiall attributes of
God increaſe, or decreaſe?
            
            
               Child.
               Nothing that is in GOD can bée
augmented, or diminiſhed, or anie
way altered: For as hée is once at
any time, ſo is hée alwaies at all
times.
            
            
               Father.
               What may we learne out of this?
            
            
               Child.
               To feare and tremble ſo often as
wée thinke or ſpeake of this infinite
Maieſtie.
            
            
               Father.
               What are we eſpecially to conſider in
God for our comfort and inſtruction?
            
            
               Child.
               His wiſedome, prouidence, iuſtice,

and mercie.
            
            
               Father.
               Are not all theſe in God as accidents,
or accidentall qualities?
            
            
               Child.
               No: For there are no accidents,
or accidentall qualities in God, that
is nothing ſeperable or mutable: but
all theſe are in God as eſſentiall, and
inſeperable properties, or if you will
of the very eſſence of God.
            
            
               Father.
               Are not theſe forenamed qualities
of wiſedome, prouidence, iuſtice, and
mercie, accidentall, and ſeperable both
in men and Angels?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes verely: for they are no part of
their nature or eſſence, nor yet eſſentiall
properties: for they may bée remooued,
and ſeperated from their
ſubiects.
            
            
               Father.
               You ſaid before that God is alwaies
euery where, that is, in all places at
once: but how can that bee, ſith the

opinion is, that God is onely in heauen?
            
            
               Child.
               God as touching his eſſence is no
more in heauen then in this inferior
world: but he is ſaid to be in heauen,
becauſe his glory and maieſtie doth
there moſt clearely ſhine out.
            
            
               Father.
               Sith God is in all places at once: tell
me alſo whether he doth know all
things at once.
            
            
               Child.
               God doth know all mens thoughts,
words, and déeds at once, all that euer
haue béene, are and ſhall be. For
there is nothing paſt, or to come with
God, but all things are alwayes preſent:
and it is as eaſie a matter for
God to comprehend all things paſt,
preſent, and to come at once, as it is
for vs to tell, one, two, thrée.
            
            
               Father.
               Is it not daungerous then to haue any
baſe thoughts of God, or carnally
or baſely to imagine that God is like a

man, or any other creature?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes aſſuredly: For it is high treaſon
to haue any ſuch thoughts or vile
conceits of God: for God is like no
thing:Eſay. 40. Verſe. 18. as the Prophet ſaith, to whom
will ye liken God?
            
            
               Father.
               Is not the ſinne of the Papiſts verie
great, which make Images and ſimilitudes
of God, and ſet them vp in their
Churches to breed carnall thoughts,
and imaginations of God in the hearts
of the people?
            
            
               Child.
               It is a very high degrée of blaſphemie:Eſay. 40.
for the Prophet ſaith, What
ſimilitude will you ſet vp vnto him?
                  Abac. 2. 18 and
another Prophet ſaith: that the Image
is a teacher of lies.
               
            
            
               Father.
               What ſhall we ſay then to our common
ſwearers which daily blaſpheme
this great maieſty of God, and take his
moſt holy and ſacred name in vaine
for euery trifle?
            
            
               
               Child.
               They ſhall one day know and féele
to their euerlaſting woe, what it is
to blaſpheme ſuch an infinite maieſtie.
            
            
               Father.
               What vſe are the people of God to
make of all this?
            
            
               Child.
               This, to haue ſo great a maieſtie
alwayes in ſingular admiration and
reuerence. And the rather, becauſe
in theſe corrupt times men grow ſo
faſt towards atheiſme and prophainneſſe,
that there is no more any common
deuotion amongeſt them, or any
Reuerence of a Godhead.
            
            
               Father.
               What yet further doe you conſider
in God?
            
            
               Child.
               That he is one in ſubſtance, thrée
in perſons. I meane that in this
moſt ſimple and ſingle eſſence the
three ſeuerall perſons doe ſubſiſt.
            
            
               
               Father.
               Doe you meane that the Godhead
is diſtinguiſhed, or diuided, into three
perſons?
            
            
               Child.
               No, for the eſſence of the Godhead
is ſo ſimple, and ſingle as I ſaid,
that it can neither bée diſtinguiſhed,
deuided, or multiplyed, no not when
the Sonne is ſayd to bée GOD of
God.
            
            
               Father.
               Are not the perſons in the Godhead
diſtinguiſhed?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes, the perſons are diſtinguiſhed
each from other by their proper, and
incommunicable proprieties, that is,
their diuers manner of being which
they haue in the Godhead. As the
Father by creation, the Sonne by redemption,
the holy Ghoſt by ſanctification.
            
            
               Father.
               Expreſſe your meaning yet more
fully.
            
            
               
               Child.
               My meaning is this, that although
the ſubſtance of the deity being moſt
ſimple and ſingle cannot be deuided,
or diſtinguiſhed, nor the ſame eſſence
ſeperated: yet I ſay the perſons are
ſo diſtinguiſhed in office not in eſſēce
as the one of them cannot poſſibly be
the other.
            
            
               Father.
               What call you the perſons in the trinitie?
            
            
               Child.
               I call a perſon a ſubſiſtence in the
eſſence of God, which hauing relation
to others is diſtinguiſhed by his
incommunicable propriety.
            
            
               Father.
               Is not euery perſon the whole and
the ſame ſubſtance of the deitie?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes, for euery perſon is by himſelfe
God.
            
            
               Father.
               Are there not then three Gods?
            
            
               
               Child.
               No, for the Scripture teacheth
plainely that there is but one God
and thrée perſons.Iohn. 1. 7. As 1. Iohn. ſaith,
there are thrée which beare record in
heauen, the father, the word, and the
holy Ghoſt, and theſe thrée are one,
that is one in ſubſtance, and thrée in
perſons, and there bée many other
places of ſcriptures which proue the
diſtinction of the perſons. As where
it is ſayd, goe, and teach all nations
baptiſing them in the name of the
Father, the Sonne, and the holy
Ghoſt. And againe in the third chapter
of the Goſpel of Saint Mathew. ve.
16. 17.
                  Mat. 28. ver. 19. Where firſt mention is made
of a voice from heauen which was
the voice of the Father. Where the
firſt perſon in trinitie is pointed vnto.
Then it is ſayd, this is my beloued
ſonne. There the ſecond perſon
is at. Thirdly it is ſayd, that the
ſpirit of God deſcended, and lighted
vpon him like a done. Which plainlie
noteth out the third perſon which

is the holy Ghoſt, and thus you ſee,
how ye ſcriptures doe auouch a plaine
diſtinction of perſons, as wee ſay a
trinitie in vnitie, & a vnitie in trinitie.
            
            
               Father.
               Yet I cannot by any reaſon diſcerne
but if euery perſon be God then there
muſt needs be three Gods.
            
            
               Child.
               We muſt not in this caſe conſult
with reaſon, but ſimply beléeue the
Scriptures though wee cannot comprehend
by humane reaſon the manner
or rather miſtery of this matter.
For it far excéedeth all humane reach
and capacitie.
            
            
               Father.
               Is not one perſon in trinitie greater
then an other, as the Father greater
then the Sonne, and the Sonne greater
then the holy Ghoſt?
            
            
               Child.
               No, for the perſons be coequall,
coeternall, and coeſſentiall.
            
            
               Father.
               How vnderſtand you that worde

coeſſentiall, which the learned call

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ?
            
            
               Child.
               The perſons in trinitie are called
coeſſentiall, not becauſe they are only
of like eſſence, as wée ſée the particulars
of the ſame kind to be in naturall
things, as in thrée apples growing
together in one, and ſuch like: but
becauſe they are indéede one and the
ſelfe ſame ſimple eſſence; Therefore
the perſons of the deitie cannot without
blaſphemie be ſaid to be onely coherent
together in ſubſtance, or onely
of like ſubſtance.
            
            
               Father.
               Is it not neceſſarie that Chriſtians
ſhould be well grounded in the knowledge
of this vnitie of the Godhead,
and the diſtinction of the perſons?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes verely. For many errours, and
hereſies haue growen in the world about
theſe points.
            
            
               Father.
               Doe you not beleeue that the euerlaſting

God hath made heauen, and
earth and the ſea, & all things in them
contained?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes,Act. 4. 24. they are all the works of his
hands.
            
            
               Father.
               How did he make them?
            
            
               Child.
               By his word.Heb. 11 3. As it is written.
Through faith wée vnderſtand that
the world was ordained by the word
of God.
            
            
               Father.
               Whereof did hee make the world,
and all things in it?
            
            
               Child.
               Of nothing▪ As it is written. The
thinges which wée ſée, are not made
of things which did appeare.Heb. 11. 3.
               
            
            
               Father.
               To what end did God create heauen
and earth?
            
            
               Child.
               To ſet forth his glorie.Pſal. 19.
               
            
            
               
               Father.
               Hath not God as greate a care for
the conſeruation of the world, and all
particular creatures in it, as euer he had
to create them?
            
            
               Child.
               Gods care is no leſſe for the conſeruation
of the creature then firſt it
was for the creation.Pſal. 104. ver. 27. 28. For as in great
wiſedome he made them all; So in
as great wiſedome hée doth preſerue
thē al He is not as a carpenter which
hauing built a houſe, afterward taketh
no more care of it.
            
            
               Father.
               Do you not thinke that God alſo
created the Angels?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes,Col. 1. 16. they alſo are the workes of his
fingers.
            
            
               Father.
               When did he create them?
            
            
               Child.
               In the beginning when he made
all other creatures.
            
            
               
               Father.
               In which of the ſixe dayes were the
Angels created?
            
            
               Child.
               That is a curious queſtion, and
I can giue you no certaine anſwere
vnto it: but it is moſt likely, and probable
that it was in the ſixt and laſt
day when man was created after
Gods owne image. For the Angels
carry the greateſt Image of God in
them.
            
            
               Father.
               What is an Angell?
            
            
               Child.
               An inuiſible ſpirit.Col. 1. 16
               
            
            
               Father.
               Our Lord Ieſus ſaith that God is
a ſpirit:Ioh. 4. 24. What difference then make
you betwixt God and an Angell?
            
            
               Child.
               The difference is excéeding great.
For God is an infinite ſpirit, the Angels
are but finite. GOD is the
creator: the Angels be but creatures,
and although they bée very glorious

creatures: yet God doth infinitly excéede
them in glory.
            
            
               Father.
               Do not the Angels of all other creatures
come neareſt vnto the nature
of GOD, and furtheſt excell the nature
of man?
            
            
               Child.
               The angelicall nature doth exiſt as
a meane betwixt God & mā, although
far nearer the lower, then the vpper
extreame. Participating ſomewhat
of each nature, hauing had a béeginning
as man: and yet being immortall
with God, conſiſting of matter
and forme as doth a man: yet voyde
of all mixture as God. Subſiſting in
ſome matter ſubiect as a man: yet being
incorporeall as God. Ignorant
of ſome things as a man: yet of wonderfull
capacitie and knowledge as
God, and in a word being euery way
finit as a man: yet perfect in all reſpects
as God.
            
            
               Father.
               As you haue ſhewed me the proper

attributes of God ſo alſo ſhew the
proper attributes of the Angels, that ſo
wee may more clearely diſcerne their
glorious nature?
            
            
               Child.
               The Angels haue eſſentiall attributes
proportionable though not
comparable to thoſe in God. For
Gods abſolute vbiquitie, they haue
ſucceſſiue vbiquity, for the eternity of
God they haue immortalitie, for his
moſt ſimple nature, they haue a moſt
thin & ſubtile eſſence, for his omnipotency
they haue great power and
might.
            
            
               Father.
               How proue you that the Angels
haue ſo great power and might?
            
            
               Child.
               Out of the Pſalme. Where it is ſaid
Praiſe the Lord ye his Angels which excell
in ſtrength.
                  Pſal. 103. ver. 20. And againe out of
the Booke of the Kings. Where wée
read that one Angell in one night
did deſtroy the whole army of
Synacherib Kinge of Aſſiria.

being an hundred foureſcore and
fiue thouſand.
            
            
               Father.
               What thinke you of the agilitie and
ſwiftneſſe of Angels?
            
            
               Child.
               I thinke by reaſon of their agile
and thinne ſubſtance being far more
ſubtile and thin then the ayre it ſelfe,
that they glide thorow the ayre with
vnconcernable ſwiftneſſe, and can bée
any where in a moment as God is alwayes
euery where.
            
            
               Father.
               What is your reaſon?
            
            
               Child.
               My reaſon is this, we ſée by daily
experience that the ſun being a viſible
body doth fetch the whole compas of
the heauens in foure & twenty houres
and it is well knowne to all ye learned
that the circle or circumference of the
ſun doth by many degrées excéede the
circle or globe of ye whole earth, néeds
therefore muſt the Sunne bée caried
in an vnſpeakeable ſwift motion

farre paſſing the muſket ſhotte for
elſe how could it goe through his
whole ſpheare in 24. houres as we ſée
it doth, then conſequently it followeth
that the motion of Angels muſt
néedes bée much ſwifter then that
of the Sunne, becauſe they are of a
more thin, agile, aiery, and inuiſible
nature.
            
            
               Father.
               Can an Angell be in many places at
once?
            
            
               Child.
               No but in a minute of time they can
be any where as I ſaid before.
            
            
               Father.
               What ſay you to the knowledge and
vnderſtanding of Angels?
            
            
               Child.
               I ſay that it is excéeding great in all
things, far paſſing all knowledge of
men though neuer ſo learned & ſkilful.
            
            
               Father.
               Doe the Angels know all things?
            
            
               Child.
               No, they are ignorant of ſome

things, as of mēs particular thoughts
of ſome things to come, of the laſt day
and of the eſſence of God.
            
            
               Father.
               What reaſon can you yeelde that
Angels know not the eſſence of God?
            
            
               Child.
               This; the eſſence of God is infinit
therefore no Angell can know it or
comprehend it. For that which is finit
cannot cōprehend that which is infinit:
but the Angels are finite; therefore
they cannot comprehend ye eſſence
of God being infinit, for the eſſence of
God is verely knowen to himſelfe: he
knoweth his owne eſſence, and therefore
hée is infinit. For whatſoeuer
knoweth & comprehendeth that which
is infinit, muſt néeds it ſelfe be infinit.
            
            
               Father.
               Where be the holy and elect Angels
of God?
            
            
               Child.
               Then bée both in heauen,Pſal. 34. 7. earth
and the aire.Mat. 18. 10. And whereſoeuer any
people of God bée, there be they alſo.
            
            
               
               Father.
               What is the ſpeciall office of the
good Angels?
            
            
               Child.
               To preſerue the children of God,Pſa. 1. 91. 11
to gard them,Mat. 18. 10. to miniſter vnto them,
and to kéepe them in all their wayes.
            
            
               Father.
               What is the reaſon that the Angels
are diſcribed with ſix wings a peece in
the Scriptures?Eſay. 9. 2.
               
            
            
               Child.
               They haue two winges to couer
their face, becauſe they are not able to
indure the brightneſſe of Gods glory:
they haue two wings to couer their
féet, becauſe man is not able to abide
the brightnes yt is in them; they haue
two to fly withal, to ſignifie their readines
& prompt obedience to all the
commandements of God.
            
            
               Father.
               What vſe are wee to make of
all this that God is ſo infinite in himſelfe,
and ſo glorious in all his creatures,
ſpecially in the Angels, Sunne,

Moone and Starres, &c.
            
            
               Child.
               We are not onely to feare, dread
and reuerence ſo great a maieſtie: but
alſo to loue him, worſhippe him and
obey him with all our hearts, with all
our ſpirit, and with all our ſtrength,
and with all our thoughts.
            
            
               Father.
               Did not the bleſſed Angels fall from
that excellent eſtate wherein they were
firſt created?
            
            
               Child.
               Many of them fell from their firſt
eſtate & became diuels as appeareth
in the Scriptures.Iohn. 8. 44
                  2. Pet. 2. 4.
                  Iud. ver. 6.
               
            
            
               Father.
               What was the cauſe or chiefe motiue
of the fall?
            
            
               Child.
               They fell of themſelues, that is to
ſay, through their owne motion, will
& diſpoſition without any inſtigation
of any other or any former motiue
whatſoeuer, which thing cauſed God
to caſt them downe without all hope

of recouery: but man falling by the
firſt motiue, and by inſtigation of others
hath left vnto him an aſſured
hope of recouery.
            
            
               Father.
               Is not the number of the Angels that
fell from their firſt eſtate, and became
diuels, very great?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes excéeding great: for the diuell
being demanded by our Lord Ieſus
what was his name, anſwered, My
name is Legion:
                  Mark. 9. for ſaith hée, wée are
many, which plainely prooueth that
there be many diuels.
            
            
               Father.
               What doe you call a Legion?
            
            
               Child.
               A Legion according to the account
of the Romans was ſixe thouſand
footmen: Our Lord Ieſus ſaid to Peter:
                  Mat. 26. 13
                  Put vp thy ſword, for doeſt thou not
thinke that I can now pray to my father,
and he will giue me more then twelue Legions
of Angels? So then it appeareth
by the ſcriptures that there bée very

many both good Angels and bad.
            
            
               Father.
               If there bee ſo many diuels, why
doth the Scripture ſpeake of the diuell
in the ſingular number as if there
were but one?
            
            
               Child.
               There bée multitudes of infernall
Spirits, but yet they doe ſo ioyne together
in one, that they bée called the
diuell in the ſinguler number, becauſe
there is a kingdome of them, and a
vnited ſocietie vnder one head, prince
or principall diuell: and they doe all
ioyne to vphold their ſocietie,Mat. 12. 26 and
kingdome, as Chriſt teacheth.
            
            
               Father.
               Did the diuels by their fall looſe that
great power and ſtrength which they
had by nature and creation?
            
            
               Child.
               No: They doe ſtill retaine their
firſt power and ſtrength,Eph. 6. 12. as experiance
teacheth: and the Scriptures
doe call as well the Diuels, as the
good angels, principalities & powers.
            
            
               
               Father.
               Haue the diuels by their fall loſt that
great wiſedome and vnderſtanding
which they had in their firſt eſtate?
            
            
               Child.
               No: But they haue corrupted, and
depraued it, and turned it from wiſedome
into déepe craft and ſubtiltie: the
like may be ſayd for their ſwiftneſſe
and agilitie.
            
            
               Father.
               Where are the diuels, what place do
they keepe in?
            
            
               Child.
               Their principall aboad is in the
ayre, through the which they glide too
and fro with vnſpeakable ſwiftneſſe:Eph. 1. 7.
and therefore the Apoſtle calleth the
diuell the Prince of the ayre,Eph. 6. 12. and the
diuels are ſaid to be in ye high places.
            
            
               Father.
               The common opinion is that the
diuels be ſhut vp in hell, as it were in a
dungeon of darkneſſe, and that they
neuer come out except they be forced,
and raiſed vp by coniurers.
            
            
               
               Child.
               That is an ignorant, falſe and fantaſticate
opinion quite contrary to
the Scriptures,Iob. 1. 7. which teach that the
diuels are in places héere below.1. Pet. ca. 8.
               
            
            
               Father.
               Is it not a true and warrantable
ſpeech to ſay that the diuels are in
hell?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes: If you take hell metaphorically
for the torments they are in,
and not for any circumſcript place:
for it may be very probably coniectured
that the aboad of the diuels is in
the ayre, and not in any other circumſcript
place as yet: but after the
great iudgement they ſhall goe to
their owne place, euen that depth or
gulfe mentioned, Luke. 8. verſ. 3.
which they doe quake and tremble to
thinke off as appeareth in the Goſpell.Mat. 8. 29.
               
            
            
               Father.
               What is the eſtate and condition of
diuels in the meane time?
            
            
               
               Child.
               In the meane time they are in
chaines of darkneſſe as Saint Peter
ſaith,2. Pet. 2. 4. that is, in a moſt miſerable condition
of life, full of terrible horrour,
euen as grieuous malefactours hauing
receiued the ſentence of death
are yet for a time retained in a ſtinking
priſon, vntill they bée drawen
out to their full and laſt execution:
for S. Iude ſaith expreſly that they
are reſerued in euerlaſting chaines
vnder darkeneſſe vnto the iudgement
of the great day.Iud. ver. 6.
               
            
            
               Father.
               Hauing thus farre ſpoken of God,
and of the Angels and their fall: Let
vs now proceed to ſpeake of man, and
firſt of all tell me, In what eſtate man
was firſt created?
            
            
               Child.
               In a moſt pure and excellent eſtate
frée from ſinne and corruption,
being made after the very image of
God in reſpect of knowledge,Gen. 1. 26. wiſedome,
and righteouſneſſe, hauing

fréedome of will, and Lordſhip ouer
the earth.
            
            
               Father.
               How then fell he from this ſo glorious
and perfect eſtate?
            
            
               Child.
               The woman being beguiled by the
ſuggeſtion of Sathan in the likeneſſe
of a ſerpent,Gen. 3. did entiſe Adam her huſband
to eate of the forbidden fruit in
the middeſt of the garden, and ſo preſently,
both loſt all their former excellency,
and alſo wrapped themſelues,
and their whole poſterity in perpetuall
thraldome and miſery:Rom. 5. and thus
ſinne firſt entred into the world, and
together with ſin came death and the
curſe of God vpon all mankind.
            
            
               Father.
               Now ſince the fall of Adam wherein
doth our miſery eſpecially conſiſt?
            
            
               Child.
               In this; that wée are wholly corrupted
both in reaſon, vnderſtanding,
will, and affections, which is

the very cauſe why we are ſo proone
to euill, and ſo vntoward to all
goodneſſe.
            
            
               Father.
               Doth God hate vs for this our naturall
corruption?
            
            
               Child.
               As an Adder, or a Toad is hated
of man, not ſo much for the euill
it hath done, as for the poyſon
that is in it: and the hurt which it
cannot but doe: ſo God hateth vs,
not onely for the euill wée doe, but
for the euill which wée cannot but
doe, that is, for our poyſoned nature
which is borne and bred with
vs.
            
            
               Father.
               Then you holde that our actuall
tranſgreſsions doe not firſt make vs
euill.
            
            
               Child.
               I hold ſo indéed: For as the hurt
which a venemous ſerpent doth, maketh
her not a ſerpent, but becauſe
ſhée is a ſerpent, ſhée poyſoneth and

hurteth: ſo our euill déedes doe not
firſt make vs euill, but becauſe wée
are of nature euill, therefore wée
thinke and doe euill.
            
            
               Father.
               Doe you thinke that this originall
contagion is wholly in euery particular
man: or that one man hath one
part of it, and another man another:
and ſo part it among them, part, and
part like?
            
            
               Child.
               I thinke thus, that as euery man
receiued from Adam the whole nature
of man: ſo alſo hée receiued the
whole corruption, and is cloathed
with it as a beaſt with a ſkinne,
his whole nature both bodie & ſoule
being oppreſſed with it as a moſt infectious
leproſie: and therefore euery
man hath in him from his parents
the ſéede of all ſinne, which is a
naturall diſpoſition, & proneneſſe to
commit any ſinne whatſoeuer. For
the ſpawne of all the horrible ſinnes
that are practiſed in the world are

in that man which is thought to bée
beſt diſpoſed by nature.
            
            
               Father.
               But experience teacheth that ſome
euen by nature are more ciuill, gentle,
and tractable then others.
            
            
               Child.
               This commeth to paſſe, not becauſe
ſome men are by nature leſſe
wicked then others: but béecauſe
God by his prouidence doth limit,
and reſtraine mens corruptions more
or leſſe, which hée doth for the good of
mankinde: for if men were wholly
left to themſelues, corruption would
ſo excéedingly break out into all manner
of villanies, that there ſhould bée
no liuing in the world.
            
            
               Father.
               It ſeemeth by this that man is a moſt
contagious and vile nature.
            
            
               Child.
               The nature of man in regard of
the corruption thereof, is the worſt
of all natures except the Diuell, yea
worſe then the nature of beaſts, as

Lions, Woolues, Dogs, Swine, &c. for
there is in mans nature ſome thing of
euery beaſts nature. For hée is proud
as the Lyon, cruell as the Woolue,
greedy as the Dogge, craftie as the
For, filthy as the Swine, leacherous
as the Goat, &c. For looke what degrée
of goodneſſe wée had in our firſt
creation in Adam: the ſame degrée
of euill haue wée in the corruption of
our nature by his fall.
            
            
               Father.
               But is this naturall corruption alwaies
liuely and operatiue in vs, I
meane in continuall action and operation,
doth it not ſometimes lye dead in
vs, and ceaſe to worke?
            
            
               Child.
               It is alwayes aliue and woorking,
except where it is kept downe
by ſpeciall grace, and there alſo it
will not bée held downe one minute
longer then ſpeciall grace woorketh,
and preuayleth in the ſoule. For ſo
ſoone as the thought, or action of
grace is out, the thought and action

of ſinne is in: Our concupiſcence
is like a crabbe trée which bringeth
foorth alwayes ſowre fruit: or like
an vntilled field, which bringeth
foorth nothing but wéedes: or a luſty
ſtrong horſe pricked with prouender
that carieth his rider headlong ouer
hedge and ditch.
            
            
               Father.
               But put the caſe a man ſhould haue
no outward obiection to mooue him,
nor externall prouocations to allure
him. Doe you not then thinke that this
naturall infection would lye dead in
him, and ceaſe to worke?
            
            
               Child.
               Concupiſcence would ſhew it
ſelfe, though men were ſhut vp alone
in cloſets betwéene ſtonewals, where
they could haue no externall prouocations,
yea, though there were no
Diuell, or that the Diuell were chained
vp.
            
            
               Father.
               Whether then doe you thinke that

the Diuell or our corrupt nature are
greater enemies to our ſaluation: Or
whether doth more euill ſpring out of
our currupt nature, then from the diuels
ſuggeſtion?
            
            
               Child.
               Firſt, I anſwere that our corruption
is a ſtronger enemie againſt vs
then Sathan, and conſequently our
ſelues greater enemies to our ſelues
then the diuell, for wée haue no ſuch
enemy as our ſelues: and ſecondly
that more & greater euill doth ſpring
from our corrupt nature, then from
Sathans inſtigation. And all this S.
Iames doth affirme, ſaying: Euery
man is tempted,
                  Iam. 1. 14. 
                  when he is drawen away
by his owne concupiſcence, and entiſed: It
is the concupiſcence that doth firſt
both draw away, and entice: as for
the Diuell he doth but worke vpon
our concupiſcence, and is, as it were,
the bellowes to blow it, and fire it,
without the which he could not come
within vs, to doe any thing againſt
vs.
            
            
               
               Father.
               Doe you then thinke that the diuell
cannot worke immediately, or ſine medijs,
without meanes vpon the ſoule or
heart of man?
            
            
               Child.
               I thinke ſo indéed: But that which
the Diuell doth vpon the heart, is by
the externall ſences, and outward
obiects by reaſon of the hypoſtaticall
vnion betwixt the ſoule and the bodie:
for hée worketh, and pierceth
through the body to affect the ſoule,
by reaſon of the naturall ſympathy.
            
            
               Father.
               But doth this birth-corruption remaine
in the very elect after their regeneration?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes vndoubtedly: and the children
of God haue greateſt féeling
of it, and are moſt troubled with it,
and grieued for it: ſtrugling with it
by all good meanes to ſuppreſſe it,
and kéepe it vnder: for ſure it is that

euen after the people of GOD are
iuſtified, and ſanctified, and aſſured
of eternall life: yet they haue
their hands full, and as wée ſay
towe inough to their Rocke to ſnib,
and nippe of thoſe manifolde bloſſonies
and fruites of corruption,
which dayly and hourely ariſe and
ſpring vp in their nature. For as
faſt as one is pinched, and nipt
in the head, an other foorthwith
ſpringeth and ſprouteth out: Not
vnlike the Monſter Hydra with ſeauen
heads, that the Heathen write
of, which hauing one of them cut
off, ſeauen others did ariſe in the
ſtead of it. And thus wée ſée that
the very Elect of GOD haue an
endleſſe trouble, and as wée ſay
worke enough cut out, for as long
as they liue, to repayre this rent
and torne nature. For alas, alas,
though GOD forgiue vs our
ſinnes, yet doth hée not, nor will
hée in this life frée vs of naturall corruption.
            
            
               
               Father.
               Is not the knowledge, and feeling
of this a great corſey, and heart
ſmart to the moſt deare children of
God?
            
            
               Child.
               
                  Yes verely: For there is nothing
that doth ſo ſorely pinch them at the
heart as the conſideration of this,
which indéede maketh them wearie
of their life, weary of the world, and
weary of all: and often wiſh with
the Apoſtle to bée diſſolued and to
bée with Chriſt; for they doe continually
groane vnder this corruption,
as vnder a moſt heauie burthen,
and fetch many a ſorrowfull
ſigh to thinke of it, and are euer
complaining of it, as of a moſt deadly
enemie of theirs. And all this
wée many clearely ſée, as it were, in
a glaſſe, in the example of the Apoſtle
Paule himſelfe that moſt rare,
and excellent Seruant of God. Who
taketh vp moſt pittifull, and lamentable
complaintes of this poyſoned

and infected nature. I know (ſayth
hée) That in mee, that is in my fleſh
dwelleth no good thing. I allow not that
which I doe,Rom. 7. 15 for what I would, that I
doe not: but what I hate, that I doe:
I doe not the good thing which I would:
but the euill which I would not that doe
I. Now if I doe that I would not, it is
no more I that doe it, but the ſinne that
dwelleth in mee. I finde then that when
I would doe good, I am thus yoaked that
euill is preſent with mee. For I delite
in the Law of God concerning the inner
man, but I ſee an other Law in my members
rebelling againſt the law of my mind,
and leading me captiue vnto the Law of
ſinne, which is in my members. And in
the end hée breaketh out into an outcry,
ſaying: O wretched man that I am,
who ſhall deliuer me from the body of
this death?
            
            
               Father.
               Doe not Vngodly, and vnregenerate
men likewiſe mourne vnder
this corruption, and complaine much
of it?
            
            
               
               Child.
               No: you ſhall ſeldome or neuer
heare them cōplaine of it, or mourne
vnder it. For they walke after the fooliſh,
and fulfill the luſts thereof with
all delight and gréedines, being wholly
caried after the ſwing and ſway
of their owne corrupt affections and
deſires.
            
            
               Father.
               What is the cauſe hereof?
            
            
               Child.
               Becauſe they are forſaken of God
and giuen ouer to a great blindneſſe
of heart, and hardneſſe of affections,
ſo that though their miſerie is
excéeding great, yet they haue
little ſight, and leſſe féeling of
it.
            
            
               Father.
               Doe you not thinke that a man in
the ſtate of nature cannot ſo feele his
miſery?
            
            
               Child.
               Sure it is, that a méere naturall
man can haue no true ſight, or liuely

féeling of his miſery, or any ſounde
deſire to come out of it: but doth
greatly pleaſe himſelfe in it, and is
loath to come out of it; for the Apoſtle
ſayth plainely, that the naturall
man perceiueth not the thinges of
the ſpirit of God. For they are fooliſhneſſe
vnto him,1. Cor. 2. 14 neither can hée know
them, béecauſe they are ſpiritually
diſcerned.
            
            
               Father.
               But may not a naturall, and vnregenerate
man haue the knowledge of
God, and the vnderſtanding of his wil,
and ſo conſequently a ſight of heauenly
things?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes; a naturall man hath a kinde
of knowledge and vnderſtanding of
God and of his will: but it is onely
a confuſed and braine knowledge,
and a literall vnderſtanding
of the Scriptures, for hée cannot
poſſibly haue the liuely and ſauing
knowledge, which is ioyned
with quickening grace. Nor that

ſound vnderſtanding and ſight which
doth lineally deſcend from the ſpirit of
ſanctification.
            
            
               Father.
               May not man in the ſtate of nature
haue feeling alſo of God, and of heauenly
things?
            
            
               Child.
               The Scriptures doe teach that a
reprobate may haue a kinde both of
ſight and féeling of heauenly things,
for hée may bée lightened,Heb. 6. 4. and taſt of
the heauenly gift and of the powers
of the world to come, and alſo taſt
of the good woord of God, and bée
made partaker of the holy Ghoſt.
But his ſight and taſt and féeling
can neuer bée ſound and good before
regeneration. So then all the cunning
is to know, whether the worke
of grace in a mans ſoule bée ſounde
and currant or no, for vnregenerate
men are much deceiued with a falſe
light; for they doe blindly Imagine, yt
becauſe they haue ſome kind of ſight,

and féeling of heauenly things, therefore
they haue all, and the ſame that
is in euery elect.
            
            
               Father.
               What difference then doe you make
betwixt the knowledge of the elect &
the reprobate?
            
            
               Child.
               The knowledge of the reprobate
doth puffe vp.
               The knowledge of the elect doth
humble.
               The knowledge of the reprobate is
generall and confuſed.
               The knowledge of the elect is particular
and certaine.
               The knowledge of the reprobates
is onely literall: and hiſtoricall.
               The knowledge of the elect is ſpirituall,
and experimentall.
               The knowledge of the reprobate
is ſpeculatiue.
               The knowledge of the elect is practiue,
that is, ioyned with obedience.
For howſoeuer a naturall, and vnregenerate
man may know much: yet

hath hée not nor can haue any power
to doe, I meane, chearfully and aright
till his heart bée enlarged by Chriſt &
his will renued by grace.
               The knowledge of the reprobate is
like ye knowledge which a mathematicall
geographer hath of the earth
and all places in it, which is but a generall
notion, and ſpeculatiue comprehenſion
of them.
               But the knowledge of the elect is
like the knowledge of a traueller
which can ſpeake of experience, and
féeling, and hath béene there and ſéene
and knowen the particulars.
            
            
               Father.
               Now tell me further what difference
you make betwixt the feeling of the
elect, and the reprobate?
            
            
               Child.
               The reprobate hath a kinde of naturall
féeling of ſinne but it is without
the true hatred of it, for in his
heart hée loueth it.
               The elect doth ſo féele his ſin that
hée hateth it, taketh councell againſt

it, and praieth againſt it.
               The féeling of the reprobate is from
naturall faculties, for hée is not as a
blocke without all ſence.
               The féeling of the elect is from the
ſpirit of ſanctification.
               The féeling of the reprobate ariſeth
from naturall feare & diffidence:
for man naturally féeleth, and feareth
dangers, ſo the reprobates féele and
feare the wrath of God, the accuſations
of their conſciences, the puniſhment
of ſinne, hell fire, &c. But haue no
true féeling of Gods loue towardes
them.
               But the elect haue a liuely féeling
of Gods loue towards them.
               The reprobate hath ſometimes at
ſtarts, a féeling of ſpiritual ioy: but it
vaniſheth incontinently.
               The féeling of the ioy of the ſpirit
in the elect, is more laſting and often.
            
            
               Father.
               As you haue told me much of mans
miſery in nature? ſo tell mee yet

one poynt further, whether a man in
the ſtate of nature can do any thing that
pleaſeth God?
            
            
               Child.
               A méere naturall man cannot
pleaſe GOD in any thing he doth,
but euen his beſt actions are turned
into ſinne.Rom. 8. 8. For the Apoſtle ſayth.
They which are in the fleſh cannot
pleaſe GOD. And againe hée ſaith.
To them that are defiled, and vnbéeléeuing
is nothing pure: but euer
their mindes and conſciences are defiled.Tit. 1. 15.
               
            
            
               Father.
               How long doth a man continue in
this wofull and curſed eſtate wherein
he was borne?
            
            
               Child.
               Till hée bée regenerate and borne
againe. For our Lord Jeſus affirmeth,
that except a man bée borne againe
hée cannot ſée the kingdome
of God.Iohn. 3. 3
               
            
            
               Father.
               By what meanes doth a man come to

be regenerate and borne againe?
            
            
               Child.
               By the outward preaching of the
word, and the inward worke of the
ſpirit.
            
            
               Father.
               By what ſignes may a man knowe
that hee is borne againe,Iame. 1. 18 iuſtified, and
ſanctified?Eph. 1. 13.
               
            
            
               Child.
               By the worke of grace in his
heart.
               By his loue to the word of God.
               By his loue to the children of
God.
               By his hatred of ſinne.
               By his loue of righteouſneſſe.
               By the change of his thoughts.
               By the change of his actions.
               By his mortification of the
fleſh.
               By his ſanctification of the ſpirit.
               By his walking no more after the
fleſhe, but after the ſpirit, and ſuch
like.
            
            
               
               Father.
               Sith man in himſelfe is ſo curſed
and miſerable as you haue declared;
ſhew mee what is his beſt courſe
to take, and firſt of all tell mee
which is the firſt ſteppe to eternall
life?
            
            
               Child.
               The firſt ſteppe to eternall life, is
for a man to know and féele his miſery,
and then labour to gette out of
it.
            
            
               Father.
               How doth a man come to know and
feele his miſery?
            
            
               Child.
               By the ſound vnderſtanding of the
law,Rom. 3. 20. contained in the ten commandements.
            
            
               Father.
               What is the Law?
            
            
               Child.
               The perfect rule of righteouſneſſe
teaching vs what wée ſhould
doe, and forbidding the contrarie.
            
            
               
               Father.
               By whom was the Law giuen?
            
            
               Child.
               By Moyſes.
            
            
               Father.
               To whom was it giuen?
            
            
               Child.
               To the children of Iſraell.
            
            
               Father.
               When was it giuen?
            
            
               Child.
               In mount Sinai.Exod. 19.
               
            
            
               Father.
               How was it giuen?
            
            
               Child.
               With great feare and terror.Exod. 19.
               
            
            
               Father.
               To what end was it giuen?
            
            
               Child.
               To lette vs ſée our ſinnes,
that by the ſight thereof, wée
might bée conſtrayned to flye vnto
Chriſt.
            
            
               Father.
               Is any man able to keepe the
Law?
            
            
               
               Child.
               No;Rom. 2. 2. and therefore no man can bée
iuſtified by the law.
            
            
               Father.
               Sith then the law doth condemne,
and not ſaue. Sith it ſheweth our diſeaſes,
but can giue vs noe remedie,
wherefore then ſerueth it? or what is
the vſe of it both in the regenerate, and
vnregenerate?
            
            
               Child.
               As concerning the vnregenerate.Rom. 7.
Firſt, it diſcouereth their ſinnes.
               Secondly, it ſtirreth vp the affections
of ſinne in them, not of it ſelfe, but
through their default.
               Thirdly, it worketh in them a féeling
of the wrath of God, of death, and
damnatiō, without offering any hope
of pardon, and therefore to them it is
the miniſter of death.
               Laſtly, it doth increaſe, and augment
ſin in them accidentarily, that
is, by reaſon of their great corruption
which declineth from that which
is commanded: but inclineth to that

which is forbidden.
            
            
               Father.
               Lay open this laſt point ſomewhat
more fully.
            
            
               Child.
               Euen as a waterbrooke being ſtopt
with a damme euerwart, it doth ſurg
and ſwell the more, till it breake
ouer the damme: ſo ſinne being reſtrayned
by the Law doth increaſe,
and rage more in men not regenerate,
for their will béeing not reformed,
doth euer tend to that which is
forbidden.Rom. 7. Therefore the Apoſtle
ſayth, that without the Law ſinne is
dead, that is, though ſinne bée in men
before the publiſhing of the Law: yet
it is not knowne, felt, nor perceiued;
as the corrupt humours in mans bodies,
which lye cloſe and are not felt
till the purgation come: but then
they humble and ſtirre mightely to
reſiſt the medicine, or as vnſlaked
lyme, which ſléepeth, as it were, quietly
and ſtirreth not till the water
bée throwne vpon it, but then it

ſmooketh, burneth, and is in an
extreame heate. Or as a Snake
which lurketh cloſe in her hole all
winter, as if ſhée were deade:
but when the hote Sunne ſhineth
vpon her, then ſhée reuiueth, writheth,
and ſtingeth, and ſheweth
her venemous nature. And thus
you ſee what is the workinge of
the Law in vnregenerate men: But
in the regenerate, that is ſuch as are
vnder grace, it is otherwiſe. For
they doe conſent vnto the Law, and
their nature doth not take occaſion
any more by the Law to bring foorth
ſinne.
            
            
               Father.
               What is then the ſpeciall vſe of the
Law of the regenerate?
            
            
               Child.
               Firſt, it is a rule for them to direct
their liues by Secondly, it teacheth
them not to truſt in thēſelues Thirdly
it humbleth them continually in the
ſight of God Laſtly, it is their ſchoolemaſter
to Chriſt.
            
            
               
               Father.
               Whether are the regenerate vnder
the law or no?
            
            
               Child.
               The children of God are vnder the
obedience and inſtitution of the law,Rom. 6. 14.
but not vnder the curſe of it;Gal. 5. 13. for they
being in Chriſt are fréed from that.
            
            
               Father.
               Whether are the vnregenerate vnder
the law or no?
            
            
               Child.
               All wicked and vngodly men are
vnder the curſe of the Law, which is
all one, as to bée vnder the captiuitie
of Sathan and ſinne. For their caſe
is this, they muſt perfectly kéepe the
Law, or elſe bée damned. For they
haue no right to Chriſt, in whom onely
the Law is ſatiſfied. Wée ſée therefore
what a pittiful caſe al men are in,
till they come to Chriſt, and be found
in him.
            
            
               Father.
               What difference is there betwixt the
Law and the Goſpell?
            
            
               
               Child.
               The Law condemneth, but the goſpell
ſaueth: the law caſteth down, but
the Goſpell raiſeth vp.
            
            
               Father.
               What difference is there betwixt the
couenant of the law, and the couenant
of the Goſpell?
            
            
               Child.
               The Legall couenant doth really
differ from the Euangelicall, or new
couenant of Grace. For the old couenant
of the Lawe was conditionall,
and did no otherwiſe giue
life, and ſaluation vnto men, but
if they did performe it, and therefore
it was nothing elſe but a repetition
of that, which GOD made to
Adam, to wit if hée did eate of the
forbidden fruite hée ſhould dye, if
not, he ſhould liue: euen ſo if we kéepe
the Lawe wée ſhall liue thereby.
If not wée ſhall dye. But the
couenant of the Goſpell is frée, that
is, it doth fréely giue life to thoſe that

beléeue though they faile in doing.
            
            
               Father.
               But what comfort then is there
in the couenant of the Goſpell, more
then in the couenant of the Law, ſith
men of themſelues are as vnable to
beleeue the Goſpell, as to keepe the
Law?
            
            
               Child.
               God hath promiſed to giue power
to his elect to beléeue the promiſes of
the Goſpell. But hée hath made no
promiſe to giue power to performe
the Law.
            
            
               Father.
               Are not the Law and the Goſpell
contrary?
            
            
               Child.
               They are not contrary in themſelues
for the ſame God is the author
of them both, the ſame Chriſt the ſubſtance
of them both; the ſame promiſes
of eternall life the end of both; but
the contrarietie is in vs: for to vs the
Law ſaith: Doe this and thou ſhalt
liue. But the Goſpell ſayth, Beleeue

and thou ſhalt be ſaued. Theſe then bée
contrary to bée made righteous by
our ſelues, and to bée made righteous
by another: for theſe cannot ſtand
together.
            
            
               Father.
               What ſay you to the Euangelicall
couenant, or new couenant of grace,
was it not of two ſorts?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes: The firſt was that which
was made to the olde people: the other
was that which was made to
the people of Chriſts newe kingdome.
            
            
               Father.
               What difference is here betwixt
theſe two?
            
            
               Child.
               Theſe two bée all one in ſubſtance,
but differ onely in the manner of diſpenſation,
that is to ſay, in the manner
of vtterance, and meaſure of reuelation:
for otherwiſe in ſubſtance,
Euangelicall couenant hath alwayes
béene one and the ſame, firſt made to

                  Adam in Paradiſe, afterward renued
to Abraham, & his ſéed, ſhadowed
in the law, ſpoken of by the prophets.
and preached vnto vs euer ſince
Chriſt was actually exhibited to the
world.
            
            
               Father.
               You ſeeme to ſay this, that the couenant
of Grace with the old people of
the Iewes, and vs, differeth only in maner,
not in matter, that is, that Chriſt
and all the promiſes of remiſsion of
ſinnes and eternall life, in him were
dimly reuealed, and darkely vttered
vnto them in Types, and ſhadowes:
but vnto vs the ſame are more fully &
clearely opened and reuealed.
            
            
               Child.
               I meane ſo indéed.
            
            
               Father.
               Expreſſe your meaning more at large
in this point.
            
            
               Child.
               When a new impreſſion of any
booke commeth forth in a fayre letter,
good print, diſtinctly verſed, well

bound, and guilt, which béefore was
ill printed in a darke letter, ill bound,
& couered, wée ſay it is a new booke:
yet in ſubſtance it is the ſame with
the former: the difference is onely
in the forme and outward qualitie.
Likewiſe when a Paynter draweth
a darke draught of any kinde of
Picture in obſcure lineaments, and
colours, and afterward flouriſheth
it ouer with more liuely, freſh, and
orient colours, héere is the ſame
thing in ſubſtance, but altered in
qualitie. And thus it fareth béetwixt
the Couenant of Grace made
with our forefathers and vs. For
the oulde people which liued vnder
the minoritie, and wardſhippe of
the Church, had a darke draught
of Chriſt, and all the promiſes
made in him. But wée haue them
more clearely and liuely ſet out,2. Cor. 3. 8.
And as the Apoſtle ſayth, We are not as
Moiſes which put a vaile vpon his face,
&c. But wee all beehold as a mirrour
the glory of the Lord with open face. &c.
                  
And againe, in diuers manners God
ſpake in the olde time to our forefathers
by the Prophets: but in theſe
laſt dayes hée hath ſpoken vnto vs by
his Sonne moſt cléerely and manifeſtlyHeb. 1. 1.
               
            
            
               Father.
               You told me euen now that no man
is able to keepe the Law: Now therefore
tell me what daunger lyeth vppon
it, If a man breake the Law of
God?
            
            
               Child.
               Eternall death and damnation,Rom. 6. 23. for it is written: The wages of ſinne is
death.
               
            
            
               Father.
               Is eternall death and damnation due
to vs for euery little ſin, though it were
but in thought onely?
            
            
               Child.
               Yea, for the leaſt ſinne of thought,
If God ſhould deale with vs according
vnto Juſtice: for it is written:
Whoſoeuer keepeth the whole Law,
                  Iam. 2. 10. 
                  and
yet faileth in one point is guiltie of all.
               
            
            
               
               Father.
               How then ſhall we eſcape this eternall
death and damnation?
            
            
               Child.
               Onely by Chriſt: For hée hath redéemed
vs from the curſe of the Law,
being made a curſe for vs. For it is
written,Gal. 3. 13. 
                  Curſed is euery one that hangeth
on a tree: And againe: Hee that
knew no ſinne,
                  2. Cor. 1. 21. 
                  was made ſinne for vs, that
wee might bee made the righteouſneſſe of
God in him.
               
            
            
               Father.
               How, and by what meanes hath
Chriſt redeemed vs from the curſe of
the Law, and death eternall?
            
            
               Child.
               
                  By the ſhedding of his blood vpon
the Croſſe: for the Scripture ſayth:
That hee hath made vp a generall peace
betwixt his father,Col. 1. 20. and all the elect by the
blood of his Croſſe:Col. 1. 14. 
                  And againe, Wee
haue redemption throught his bloud, that
is, the forgiueneſſe of ſinne. And in another
place.
                  Eph. 2. 13. Wee which vvere farre off
are made neere by the bloold of Chriſt:

                  And the author to the Hebrews ſaith,
That neither by the blood of Goates,Heb. 9. 12. and
calues, but by his owne blood entred he
once into the holy place and obtained eternall
redemption for vs.
            
            
               Father.
               Haue we no further good by Chriſt
but onely a freedome from death, and
a deliuerance from hell & damnation?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes:Eph. 2. 14. For through him we are reconciled
to God the Father,Col. 1. 21. as the
Scripture teacheth,2. Cor 5. 19 and through him
we haue remiſſion of ſinnes,Ioh. 3. 15. eternall
life,Iohn. 5. 24 and all good things, for the Apoſtle
ſayth.1. Cor. 1. 30 
                  He is made of God for vs,
wiſdome, righteouſnes, ſanctification, and
redemption.
               
            
            
               Father.
               Is there no other way nor meanes,
whereby we may obtaine remiſsion of
ſin & eternall life, but onely by Chriſt?
            
            
               Child.
               
                  No: For the holy Ghoſt ſaith, There
is no ſaluation in any other,Act. 4. 12. for among
men there is giuen no other name vnder

heauen, whereby we muſt be ſaued. And
againe, To him doe all the Prophets witneſſe,
that through his name onely, all
that beleeue ſhall receiue remiſsion of
ſinne.Act. 10. 43.
               
            
            
               Father.
               What ſay you then to Popes pardons,
Indulgences, Maſſes, Trentales,
Dirges, and ſuch like: May not a man
by them obtaine remiſsion of ſinnes,
and eternall life?
            
            
               Child.
               Nothing leſſe: For the Scripture
knoweth no ſuch meanes or wayes
to eternall life: but doth vitterly reiect
them as moſt abhominable deuiſes
of them.
            
            
               Father.
               But may not a man be ſaued by his
good works?
            
            
               Child.
               
                  No: For the Apoſtle ſayth, By
grace are yee ſaued through faith,Eph. 2. 3. and
that not of your ſelues, nor of workes,
leaſt any man ſhould boaſt himſelfe.
               And ſure it is that euen in our

beſt actions there is ſome remedy of
corruption as wée doe them: for the
which God in iuſtice may condemne
both vs and our actions: for the
Scripture ſayth:Eſay. 64. 6. 
                  That our very righteouſneſſe
is as a defiled cloath, or filthy
cloute. If then our beſt workes bée
ſtained, how can wée bée ſaued by
works?
            
            
               Father.
               If wee cannot bee ſaued by works,
then wherefore ſhould wee doe them?
as good play for naught, as worke for
naught?
            
            
               Child.
               Not ſo for although wée can not
bée iuſtified in the ſight of God by our
good works: yet they haue their neceſſary
vſe, and ſerue to great purpoſe.
As firſt to glorifie God. Secondly,
to publiſh our Faith to the
world. Thirdly, to bring peace and
comfort to our conſciences in the diſcharge
of our duties. And laſtly, to
winne others.
            
            
               
               Father.
               What doe you call a good worke?
            
            
               Child.
               No worke of man is ſound and
currant indéede, except the ſame bée
commaunded of God to bée done: and
that of our part it bée done in ſuch ſort
and manner as hée requireth, that is,
from a carefull heart, and ſanctified
mind: otherwiſe, whatſoeuer wée do
in the worſhip and ſeruice of God, it
is abhominable.
            
            
               Father.
               If a man cannot bee ſaued by his
works, but by Chriſt only: then tel me
whether al men ſhalbe ſaued by Chriſt
or no?
            
            
               Child.
               None ſhalbée ſaued by Chriſt, but
onely ſuch as beléeue in Chriſt, that
is, ſuch as doe particularly apply
Chriſt, and all the promiſes made in
him to themſelues, beeing fully perſwaded
in themſelues that Chriſt
with all his merits is theirs.
            
            
               Father.
               Are you fully perſwaded that Chriſt

with all his righteouſnes is yours: that
you haue ſpeciall intereſt in him, and
that he dyed for you particularly, and
by name?
            
            
               Child.
               I am fully ſo perſwaded indéede
without all doubting.
            
            
               Father.
               How know you certainly that you
haue ſpeciall intereſt in Chriſt, & that
you ſhall be ſaued by his merits, ſith
thouſands ſhal periſh which will ſay as
much as you, and in words make great
brags, that they hope to bee ſaued as
well as the beſt of them all?
            
            
               Child.
               I doe certainely know it by the
worke of grace in my ſoule: I doe
certainely know it, becauſe I féele it,
for this I am ſure of, that I féele that
wrought in me from aboue, which
cannot bée in any but thoſe whom
God will ſaue.
            
            
               Father.
               What is that I pray you?
            
            
               Child.
               A liuely féeling of his grace, a féeling

of his loue, a féeling of his mercie;
aſſured faith in the promiſes, a
féeling of the ſpirit of adoption, a
chaunge of my heart, an alteration
of my wayes, an vnfained hatred of
all euill, and a ſyncere loue of all
righteouſneſſe.
            
            
               Father.
               May not a wicked man haue all this?
            
            
               Child.
               No: He may haue certaine ſhewes
and ſhadowes of theſe things: but in
déed and in truth theſe things can be
in none but the very elect.
            
            
               Father.
               Cannot the wicked and vnregenerate
man be fully perſwaded that Chriſt is
his, and that he ſhall be ſaued?
            
            
               Child.
               He cannot, whatſoeuer he ſaith, becauſe
hée cannot poſſibly receiue the
ſpirit of adoption, whereby this inward
aſſurance & full perſwaſion is
wrought, & whereby alſo the merits of
Chriſts death are ſealed to euery particular
conſcience.
            
            
               
               Father.
               What other reaſon haue you?
            
            
               Child.
               Becauſe none of the wicked haue
that liuely and iuſtifying faith, which
maketh Chriſt, and all his righteouſneſſe
ours.
            
            
               Father.
               But there is none ſo wicked, but he
will ſay he hath faith, and for the moſt
part they thinke, that they haue all the
faith in the world, and that there is no
want in their faith.
            
            
               Child.
               Alas poore ſoules: In theſe matters
of GOD they ſay and thinke
they know not what. For Faith is
a myſtrrie, and all heauenly things
are ſuch myſteries, as they, men of
this world cannot vnderſtand: they
are hid from their eyes.
            
            
               Father.
               Tell me then what is the heauenly,
and iuſtifying faith?
            
            
               Child.
               A full perwaſion and inward

aſſurance of Gods particular loue to
vs in Chriſt, with a ſence and féeling
of the ſame in our hearts.
            
            
               Father.
               May not this be in the wicked?
            
            
               Child.
               No: It is not poſſible.
            
            
               Father.
               How farre then may a wicked man
goe in faith?
            
            
               Child.
               A wicked man may goe thus
farre: to haue knowledge of the
truth: An aſſent to the ſame, a ioy
both in hearing and ſpeaking of it,
and an outward profeſſion of it for
a time: but the inward aſſurance
of Gods loue, and ſenſible féeling
of it in their heart, they can neuer
haue: which is indéede the very life
of faith.
            
            
               Father.
               Is not this knowledge and aſſent
ſufficient: If a man know the word
of God, and conſent to the truth of
it in his heart, is not this faith?
            
            
               
               Child.
               No: For the diuels may goe ſo
farre, and further too: For the diuels
doe beléeue the Scriptures to bée true.
They beléeue all the articles of the
faith: They haue excéeding great
knowledge of the will of God, and of
the whole Scripture, they beléeue that
there is a God, and that there is a reward
for the righteous, and torments
to come for the wicked, and as Saint
Iames ſaith: The diuels beleeue & tremble:
and yet I hope no man will ſay
the diuels ſhall bée ſaued. Therefore
wée muſt ſéeke a difference béetwixt
their faith and ours, or eſſe our faith
is no better then the faith of diuels.
            
            
               Father.
               If this be true then Lord haue mercy
vpon vs, For out of doubt thouſands
are deceiued in this matter of faith, and
moſt men content themſelues with a
ſhadow of it, ſtead of faith indeed. And
aſſuredly the faith of many carnal proteſtants
is little better then the faith of
diuels.
            
            
               
               Child.
               It is true the more is the pittie: for
the faith that now a dayes goeth for
currant in the world is but an idle,
dead, barren, fruitleſſe, and fantaſticall
faith, or rather an opinion, conceit,
and mathematicall Imagination
of the braine.
            
            
               Father.
               Hovv many parts be there of the true
and liuely faith?
            
            
               Child.
               Two.
            
            
               Father.
               Which be they?
            
            
               Child.
               Iuſtification and ſanctification.
            
            
               Father.
               What is iuſtification?
            
            
               Child.
               A ſetting of vs frée from the guilt of
ſinne by the blood of Chriſt.
            
            
               Father.
               What is ſanctification?
            
            
               Child.
               A clenſing & renuing of our nature

by the ſpirit of God.
            
            
               Father.
               How many parts be there of iuſtification?
            
            
               Child.
               Two: That is to ſay, remiſſion of
ſinne, and the imputation of Chriſts
righteouſneſſe: for when our ſinnes
are forgiuen, & Chriſts righteouſneſſe
imputed to vs, then are wée truly and
indéed iuſtified.
            
            
               Father.
               How many parts be there of ſanctification?
            
            
               Child.
               Two.
            
            
               Father.
               Which be they?
            
            
               Child.
               Mortification and viuification.
            
            
               Father.
               What is mortification?
            
            
               Child.
               A dying to ſinne.
            
            
               Father
               What is viuification?
            
            
               
               Child.
               A liuing to righteouſneſſe.
            
            
               Father.
               How many parts be there of viuification?
            
            
               Child.
               Two.
            
            
               Father.
               Which be they?
            
            
               Child.
               Regeneration, and repentance.
            
            
               Father.
               What is regeneration?
            
            
               Child.
               A repairing of our nature which
was corrupted by Adams fall.
            
            
               Father.
               What is repentance?
            
            
               Child.
               An inward change of the ſoule, and
a conuerſion of the whole man vnto
God.
            
            
               Father.
               Cannot a wicked man haue this repentance,
which is in the change of the
ſoule, and the conuerſion of the whole

man vnto God?
            
            
               Child.
               This is neuer wrought in ye wicked.
            
            
               Father.
               How far then may the vvicked goe
in repentance?
            
            
               Child.
               The wicked may goe thus farre to
haue a ſight of ſin, and a féeling of it,
a confeſſion of it, a ſorrow for it. A
great penſiueneſſe and terrour after
ſome horrible fact, for feare of ſhame,
Law, puniſhment, hell fire, &c. as had
Iudas, Cain, Saule, Eſau, Ahab, and
ſuch like. They may haue alſo a reſolution
for the time to ſinne noe more.
But that part of repentance which
hath the promiſe of mercy annexed vnto
it, that is, the conuerſation of the
whole man vnto God, they can neuer
haue.
            
            
               Father.
               How many parts be there of repentance?
            
            
               Child.
               Thrée
            
            
               
               Father.
               Which be they?
            
            
               Child.
               Inward ſorrow, confeſſion, new obedience.
            
            
               Father.
               Whether is faith before repentance
or repentance before faith?
            
            
               Child.
               If we reſpect time then they goe together,
for ſo ſoone as there is fire ther
is heat, ſo ſoone as a man hath faith,
ſo ſoone hée repents; but in the order
of nature, faith goeth before repentāce
& before all other graces, becauſe it is
the roote of all things that pleaſe God.
But if we reſpect the outward manifeſtation,
then repentance goeth béefore
faith and regeneration, and all
other vertues. Becauſe it firſt of all
appeareth outwardly. For Faith is
like the ſappe of a trée that lyeth hid
within the barke: But repentance
is like the bud that ſpéedily ſheweth
it ſelfe, before either bloſſome, fruit, or
leafe appeare. Faith is like the fire

and repentance like the ſmooke: for
though fire bée béefore ſmooke, yet the
ſmooke ſheweth it ſelfe before the
fire.
            
            
               Father.
               You defined repentance to bee an
inward change of the ſoule, how vnderſtand
you that? Doth repentance
change or aboliſh the ſubſtance of body
or ſoule, or any of the faculties
thereof?
            
            
               Child.
               No ſuch matter. But true repentance
doth rectifie and amend them by
remoouing the corruption: for it turneth
the ſadneſſe of malancholy into
Godly ſorrow, choler into good zeale,
ſoftneſſe of nature, to méekenes of ſpirit,
lightneſſe, and wantonnes to chriſtian
mirth. It reformeth euery man
according to his natural conſtitution,
not aboliſhing it, but redreſſing the
faults of it.
            
            
               Father.
               By what meanes is repentance
wrought in vs?
            
            
               
               Child.
               Both faith and repentance are
wrought in vs by yt preaching of the
Goſpell through the inward worke of
the holy Ghoſt.
            
            
               Father.
               Is not repentance wrought in vs by
the preaching of the Law?
            
            
               Child.
               To ſpeake properly, it is not. For
the Law is not the proper cauſe, but
rather an occaſiō of repentāce, becauſe
it repreſenteth vnto the eye of our
ſoule our damnable eſtate, and ſmiteth
the conſcience with dolefull terrours
and feares, which though they
be no tokens of grace (for they are in
their owne nature the very gates,
and the downefall to the pit of hell)
yet are they certaine occaſions of receiuing
grace.
            
            
               Father.
               Expreſſe this more plainely.
            
            
               Child.
               Euen as a Phiſition is ſometimes
conſtrained to giue that vnto his patient

which increaſeth ſickneſſe & maketh
his fits more ſore and terrible, to
the end he may recouer him: ſo man
becauſe hée is dangerouſly ſicke of ſin
muſt bée caſt into ſome fits of legall
terrors by the miniſtrie of the Law,
that he may be ſoundly and inwardly
cured.
            
            
               Father.
               The Law is a ſcholemaſter to bring
vs vnto Chriſt, ergo it is the cauſe of
repentance.
            
            
               Child.
               It bringeth vs to Chriſt but not ſo
kindly & naturally as doth the Goſpel
by alluring vs, but as it were, violently
and forceably conſtraining vs;
and as they ſay it bringeth vs not ſimply
and of it ſelfe: but after ſome ſort
and manner▪ For the law in it ſelfe is
the miniſtry of death, & damnation,
becauſe it ſheweth a man his wretched
eſtate but ſheweth him no remedy,
therefore it cannot properly be an inſtrumentall
cauſe of that repentance
which is effectuall to ſaluation. But

the doctrine of repentance is a part of
the Goſpell; and therefore the preaching
of the Goſpell, and the preaching
of repentance are put one for another.
Luk. 96. Mar. 6. 12. and conſequently
true repentance doth ſpring out of the
goſpell, as out of his naturall root and
moſt originall cauſe.
            
            
               Father.
               As you haue told me by what meanes
faith and repentance are wrought in
vs: ſo now tell mee by what meanes
they are nouriſhed, & increaſed in vs?
            
            
               Child.
               As faith and repentance are firſt
hatched, and bred in our harts by the
miniſtry of the word: ſo alſo are they
increaſed by the ſame, and by other
good helpes appointed of God for that
purpoſe, as prayer, ſacraments▪ reading,
meditation, conference, and ſuch
like good meanes.
            
            
               Father.
               Firſt then let vs proceed to ſpeak a
little of prayer, and firſt of all, tell me
what prayer is?
            
            
               
               Child.
               And earneſt calling vpon God according
to his will; or as ſome ſay, a
familiar ſpeach betwixt God and vs,
or as a ſecret letter wherein Gods
people ſignifie their minde vnto him
at large, crauing a ſpéedy anſwere,
which hée in his time according to his
will and wiſedome, doth alwayes
moſt graciouſly returne without
fayling.
            
            
               Father.
               How manie partes are there of
prayer?
            
            
               Child.
               Thrée, confeſſion, petition, thankſ giuing.
            
            
               Father.
               Whereof muſt confeſsion bee
made?
            
            
               Child.
               Confeſſion muſt bée made both of
originall ſinne, and actuall tranſgreſſions,
both commiſſions of euill,
and omiſſions of good. And all this
muſt be done, with as much particulariſing

as may bée, that is, calling to
minde, and reckoning vp particular
offences, eſpecially thoſe which lie heauieſt
vpon vs: and that with as great
griefe, vehemency, and aggrauation
of them as is poſſible.
            
            
               Father.
               Whereof muſt our petitions be?
            
            
               Child.
               Petitions muſt bée for the remoouing
of euill, & the obtayning of good;
for ſpirituall, and earthly bleſſings,
concerning our ſelues, and thoſe that
are néere vnto vs, concerning Church
and commonwealth: concerning magiſtracy,
miniſterie, & commonalty.
            
            
               Father.
               For what muſt our thankſgiuing be?
            
            
               Child.
               Firſt, for al ſpiritual bleſſings, as election,
creation, redemption, iuſtification,
ſanctification, adoption, word,
ſacrament, good men, good bookes good
ſocietie, good conference & all furtherances
to eternal life whatſoeuer. Secondly,
for all outward bleſſings, as
preſeruation of prince, country, peace

for magiſtrats, ſoode, rayment, health,
liberty, peace, and preſeruation. For
dayly, ordinary, and particular fauours,
which are renued vpon vs continually
from day to day: euen as the
eagle renueth her bill.
            
            
               Father.
               As you haue ſhewed mee the parts
of prayer; ſo alſo ſhew mee ſome circumſtances
of prayer, and firſt tell me
to whom we muſt pray.
            
            
               Child.
               To God onely.
            
            
               Father.
               In whoſe name muſt we pray?
            
            
               Child.
               In the name of Chriſt onely.
            
            
               Father.
               How muſt we pray?
            
            
               Child.
               In the ſpirit that is, feruently, féelingly,
and conſtantly, which cannot
be without a féeling of our miſery.
            
            
               Father.
               When muſt we pray?
            
            
               Child.
               At all times as occaſion, and neceſſitie

doth mooue:Iame. c. 13 but ſpecially in the time
of affliction, as it is written; if any be
afflicted let him pray.
            
            
               Father.
               Where muſt we pray?
            
            
               Child.
               Euery where;1. Tim. 2. 8 but eſpecially in the

               Father.
               Vpon what muſt our prayers bee
grounded?
            
            
               Child.
               Vpon the word of God, and the promiſes
of the Goſpell.
            
            
               Father.
               What muſt we pray for?
            
            
               Child.
               For thoſe things which our Lord
Ieſus hath taught in his praier which
is the perfect platforme of all prayer
both for matter and forme.
            
            
               Father.
               Which bee thoſe things which our
Sauiour would haue vs alwaies to bee
mindefull of, when we haue any ſuites
vnto his father?
            
            
               
               Child.
               Firſt, the honoring and ſetting vp
of his name héere amongſt vs, both
in regard of his Iuſtice, and mercie,
and alſo in reſpect of his worde and
wiſedome, power and prouidence.
               Secondly, for the aduancement and
flouriſhing eſtate of his Church and
kingdome, by the regiment of his
word and Spirit, by the increaſe of
good worke men in his harueſt, and
a bleſſing vpon their labour: by a remoouing
of all lets, & by a weakning
& ouerthrow of all aduerſary power
whatſoeuer: eſpecially that of Antichriſt,
Idolatry, and Atheiſme.
               Thirdly, that all chéerful obedience
may at all times, and of all perſons in
their ſeuerall places and callings bée
yéelded vnto his moſt holy will, without
grudging or hypocriſie.
               Fourthly, that all things neceſſary
for this life may bée miniſtred vnto
vs, as food, rayment, health, libertie,
peace and preſeruation: and alſo that
a bleſſing may bée vpon all that wée
haue, as body, goods, name, wife, children,

family, ſtocke, ſtore, corne, cattell,
trades, occupations yea all the
works of our hands, both goings out,
and commings in.
               Fiftly, that a generall pardon may
be graunted from the throne of grace
thorow Chriſt, for the remiſſion of all
ſin in his blood, & that therby we may
be iuſtified, acquited, and diſcharged.
               Sixtly, that we may not afterward
be left to our ſelues, but ſufficiently
armed with ſpirituall ſtrength from
aboue to outſtand all temptations
whatſoeuer; that ſo all prayſe may
redound to him which worketh all in
all.
            
            
               Father.
               As you haue ſhewed me the matter
and circumſtances of prayer, ſo ſhew
me the effects of prayer?
            
            
               Child.
               It were an endleſſe labour to enter
into that, ſith the ſcriptures do plentifully
teach, that all hard & admirable
things haue béene compaſſed & effected
by prayer, both for the turning away
of euill, and the purchaſing of good.
            
            
               
               Father.
               Then tell me what things are eſpecially
to be obſerued of vs in prayer.
            
            
               Child.
               There be nine ſpeciall things to be
obſerued of vs in prayer.
            
            
               Father.
               Which be they?
            
            
               Child.
               Repentance, meditation humiliation,
faith, loue, zeale, thankſgiuing,
watchfulneſſe, obedience. Wherof the
firſt thrée goe before prayer: the next
thrée are in the action of prayer. The
laſt thrée follow after prayer.
            
            
               Father.
               Open your meaning more plainly.
            
            
               Child.
               My meaning is this, that our prayers
can neuer bée currant and good in
the ſight of God, except before prayer
firſt wée come with great ſorrow for
ſin & ſtrong purpoſes of amendment.
Secondly except wée muſe & meditate
very déeply of yt great and manifolde
dangers wée goe in euery day, both
within vs & without vs Thirdly, except
wée bée throughly humbled with

the cōſcience of our former tranſgreſſions.
Moreouer in yt actiō of praier ther is
nothing ſound & acceptable to god:
except faith be preſent, yt is a full aſſurance
to be heard for Chriſt, & for the
promiſes made in him Secondly, except
loue toward our brethrē be there
alſo without enuy, wrath, & all vncharitable
affectiōs. Thirdly, except zeale
that is pure & earneſt affectiōs, beare
the chiefe ſway in this action, for god
abhorreth coldnes. Laſtly, except there
be heartie thankſgiuing for fauours
obtained: watchfullnes ouer our affections
afterward, and ſpeciall care of
bettering our obedience in all time to
come.
            
            
               Father.
               Doth not our Lord Ieſus in the preface
of his prayer teach vs all theſe things
concerning the manner of prayer?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes our Lord Ieſus in his preface
doth in general termes teach all theſe
things; for hée teacheth vs to pray in
faith, feare, & loue. In faith and aſſurance,
becauſe God is our Father, in
feare & reuerēce, becauſe he is in heauen.

In loue, becauſe hée is our father
that is, a common father to vs all.
            
            
               Father.
               If we pray according to theſe rules,
are we not ſure to be heard?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes certainly:Ioh. 15. 7. As the ſcriptures do
abundantly teach vs,1. Ioh. 3. 22 and as it may
appeare by this reaſon,1. Ioh. 5 14. that in prayer
there is the mutuall and ioynt worke
of the whole trinitie: the holy Ghoſt
moouing and quickning, the Son mediating:
the father hearing, and graciouſly
returning an anſwere.
            
            
               Father.
               But yet wee ſee by experience, that
God doth not alwayes grant the petitions,
and requeſts of his owne children.
Shew me therefore ſome reaſons why
God ſomtimes denieth the requeſts of
thoſe whom he loueth moſt dearely.
            
            
               Child.
               There bée foure reaſons hereof:Eze. 14. 14
firſt, becauſe God hath otherwiſe decréed
with himſelfe.
               Secondly,Mat. 20. 22 becauſe they know not
oftentimes what to aſke.
               
                  
Thirdly,2. Cor. 12. 9 becauſe hée in his déepe
wiſedome ſéeth it not good for them.
               Laſtly becauſe God will try their
faith,Luk. 18. 7. loue,Lament. 3 8. patience, and conſtancy.
            
            
               Father.
               Hauing thus farre ſpoken of prayer,
as one ſpeciall meanes whereby our
faith is increaſed: Let vs now further
proceede to ſpeake of the Sacraments,
as of an other ſpeciall helpe: and firſt
of all tell me what is a Sacrament?
            
            
               Child.
               A Sacrament is an holy ſigne or
ſeale, ordained of God to confirme
our faith to teſtifie our obedience to
his maieſty, and our loue and fellowſhip
one with another.
            
            
               Father.
               How many Sacraments be there?
            
            
               Child.
               There are but two Sacraments of
the new couenant, namely, baptiſme
and the ſupper of the Lord: for thoſe
onely are Sacraments of the newe
teſtament, which are ceremonies inſtituted
of Chriſt for the common vſe
of the whole Church, hauing the promiſe

of grace annexed vnto them,
which excludeth fiue of the popiſh ſacraments.
            
            
               Father.
               Why are the ſacraments called ſignes?
            
            
               Child.
               Becauſe they repreſent to our ſelues
ſpirituall things, and ſet forth Chriſt,
& his benefits to the outward ſences
of all.
            
            
               Father.
               Why are they called ſeales?
            
            
               Child.
               Béecauſe they ſeale vnto our conſciences
the aſſurance of the forgiueneſſe
of ſinne, and becauſe they doe effectually
apply to the faithful the truth
and fruit of Chriſts death.
            
            
               Father.
               Are our ſacraments but bare ſignes,
and figures as the papiſts charge vs?
            
            
               Child.
               Ourſacraments are not bare ſignes
and figures, but figures ioyned with
their truth and ſubſtance, and ſuch
as not onely repreſent, but exhibite
vnto vs the bodie & blood of Chriſt.
            
            
               
               Father
               Make this more plaine?
            
            
               Child.
               The Sacraments are ſignes to repreſent,
ſeales to confirme, and inſtruments
to conuey Chriſt and all
his benefits to the beléeuers they repreſent,
béecauſe wée are dull to conceiue
and remember: they ſeale becauſe
wée are full of vnbeléefe: they
conuey Chriſt vnto vs, béecauſe otherwiſe
wée doe hardly apprehend
him.
            
            
               Father.
               The Papiſts charge vs that we affirme
an imaginary, figuratiue and ſpirituall
body of Chriſt to be preſent in the ſacrament,
and not his eſſentiall body,
What ſay you to that?
            
            
               Child.
               They doe falſely ſo charge vs,
for wée hold that the Godly receiue
the true and naturall body of Chriſt,
and are partakers of his very ſubſtance,
to make vs grow into one life
with him, for wée can haue no benefit
by Chriſt vntill wée bée partakers

of Chriſt himſelfe, and that in ſuch
ſort, that we become fleſh of his fleſh,
and bone of his bone, that is, one with
him, and he with vs: Howbeit not
corporally, but in ſuch ſort as is agréeable
to a Sacrament, that is to ſay,
ſpiritually, and miſtically.
            
            
               Father.
               Lay open this point more at large?
            
            
               Child.
               Our coniunction with Chriſt is not
in imagination, & conceit onely, but is
reall & ſubſtantiall, though ſecret and
hard to be comprehended; and therefore
the Apoſtle calleth it a great miſtery.Eph. 5.
                  For we are tied to Chriſt by his ſpirit,
as the naturall members to the head
by ioynts and ſinewes, in a moſt ſecret, and
admirable manner. For wée may not
carnally conceiue of this our coniunction
with Chriſt, as though there
were any mingling of his body and
ours, his ſubſtance and ours, or his
perſon & ours: for all things that are
vnited one to another, are not ſtraight
wayes mingled; for although the
light is ioyned with the ayre, and the

Sunſhine with the windowes: yet
can we not therefore ſay they are mingled
together. The coniunction in couenant
betwixt man & wife, maketh
them two, one fleſh, ſo néere is it: yet
for all that, they ceaſe not to be diuers
perſons, and ſundry ſubſtance, although
by couenāt they are one fleſh.
Such is the coniunction, and vnion
betwixt Chriſt and vs: for we are indeede
vnited with the fleſh of Chriſt,
and are fleſh of his fleſh, and bones of
his bones: yet is all this without any
mingling or growing together of our
perſons, and ſubſtance with his: for
as the vnion of the faithfull, one with
another as members of one body, is
not by any reall mingling, or growing
in theyr perſons together but by
the bond of the ſpirit: ſo it is in this
our ſpirituall coniunctiō with Chriſt.
            
            
               Father.
               Sith the Sacraments are ſeales as you
ſay, tell me what it is that they ſeale vnto
vs?
            
            
               Child.
               The Sacrament of Baptiſme ſealeth
vnto our conſciences the remiſſion

of ſinnes, which is the firſt part
of our iuſtification. The Sacrament
of the Lords Supper ſealeth Chriſts
righteouſneſſe, which is the ſecond
part of our iuſtification: and to ſay
all in a word, whatſoeuer the holy
Ghoſt teacheth by the Goſpell, the ſacraments
doe confirme and ſeale the
ſame vnto vs, but eſpecially that our
whole ſaluation ſtandeth in the onely
ſacrifice of Chriſt offered for vs vpon
the croſſe.
            
            
               Father.
               Which be the principall vſes of a ſacrament?
            
            
               Child.
               There be ſeuen principall ends, and
vſes of a Sacrament.
            
            
               Father.
               Which be they?
            
            
               Child.
               Firſt to be ſeales of the new couenant
betwixt God & vs. Secondly, to
aſſure vs of ye truth of gods promiſes.
Thirdly, to vnderprop the weakneſſe
of our faith. Fourthly, to ſeale vnto
our conſciences the certaintie of
the forgiueneſſe of ſins Fiftly, to diſtinguiſh

the Church from Infidels &
heathen, as it were, by certaine viſible
markes, and brands. Sixtly, to
witneſſe our loue and fellowſhip one
with another, and therefore they are
as it were the bands of the Church.
Laſtly, to put vs in a freſh memory of
the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the benefits
which we haue by his death.
            
            
               Father.
               Are our Sacraments of the new couenant,
the ſame with thoſe of the old.
            
            
               Child.
               They are the ſame in ſubſtance,1. Cor. 10. 2
for the ſame Chriſt, the ſame faith, the
ſame promiſes, and the ſame hope of
eternall life are contained vnder both
the couenants: but the ſignes were
changed according to the circūſtance
of time, & ſome other differences there
be in regard of rites, clearneſſe, nomber
and time. Rites, becauſe their outward
forme of adminiſtration was
diuers from ours: cleareneſſe, becauſe
that which was obſcurely ſhadowed,
is now clearely reuealed:
Nomber, béecauſe they had a great

multitude of Sacramentall figures,
wée as few in number, & as effectuall
in ſignification as may bée: In time
becauſe there is nouriſhed in them
the faith of Chriſt to come, and ours
confirme vnto vs the faith of Chriſt
which is already come, and hath accompliſhed
all things which are neceſſary
for our redemption.
            
            
               Father.
               How many parts be there of a Sacrament?
            
            
               Child.
               Two, that is to ſay, the outward
ſigne, & the inward thing ſignified.
            
            
               Father.
               What is the reaſon that God vſeth
outward ſignes?
            
            
               Child.
               Becauſe of our babiſhnes & dulnes
in conceiuing of heauenly things for
if we were altogether ſpirituall and
angelicall, wée ſhould not néede ſuch
groſſe elements: but ſéeing our ſpirit
is drowned in our body, and our fleſh
doth make our vnderſtanding dull,
therefore the Lord is content to apply
himſelfe to our capacitie, and to teach

vs by viſible ſignes, and ſenſible things
as ſometimes he did Abraham, Gideon,
Ezechiah, & other his moſt excellent ſeruants,Gen. 15. 9.
& for this cauſe the ſacramēts are
as it were,Iud. 6. 37. mirrors, or glaſſes, wherin we
may behold the riches of the grace of god
which he beſtowed vpon vs wherin alſo
God doth more expreſly,2. Reg. 20. 
                        •
                     
                   & in a more viſible
manner teſtifie his loue & good will
towards vs, then by his word.
            
            
               Father.
               Which is the outward ſigne in baptiſme?
            
            
               Child.
               Water.
            
            
               Father.
               Which is the inward thing ſignified?
            
            
               Child.
               The waſhing away of ſin by the blood
of Chriſt,
            
            
               Father.
               Which is the proper end of Baptiſme?
            
            
               Child.
               The proper end of baptiſme is, that by
this ſolemne, and holy action wée might
be knowen by the teſtimony of men and
angels to bée in the number of ye viſible
Church.
            
            
               Father.
               Expreſſe your mind more fully touching
the end and vſe of Baptiſme.
            
            
               
               Child.
               Baptiſme is ordained of God not only
to bée a ſacrament of our regeneration &
new birth, & of the burial of the old man,
but alſo to bée a viſible teſtimony of our
admiſſion into the houſhold of god which
is his Church; for in baptiſme we do giue
our names to god, put on his liuery coat
& cognizance, and take the oath of allegiance
to be true ſubiects to ye crown of heauen,
& to ſet our ſelues with al might and
maine againſt the enemies of our Lord &
king; that is, the world, the fleſh, & the diuill,
& to bée all for him, yt is, for his credit
and honour, not regarding our ſelues, ſo
we may bring glory to him whoſe we are
& to whom wée haue ſworne allegiance
& giuen vp our ſelues wholy to ſerue him
faithfully, as our ſpeciall good Lord and
maſter.
            
            
               Father.
               Is there not yet ſome further vſe of baptiſme
beſides this you haue ſpoken of?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes: there is yet ſomewhat more, for
Baptiſme is a ſeale of the couenant betwixt
God & vs; for in Baptiſme a couenant
is made betwéen the Lord, and the

party baptiſed ſolemnly in the aſſembly
of the Church. In which couenant God
for his part promiſed Chriſt with al bleſſings
that come by him, as that he wil be
our God, forgiue vs our ſins, & remēber
our iniquities no more, &c. The partie
baptiſed for his part entreth himſelfe, as
a couenant ſeruant vnto God, promiſeth
faithfull ſeruice with a renouncing of ſathan
& ſin, and whatſoeuer is againſt the
honor and glory of God: and ſo ſtandeth
bound to theſe couenants and conditiōs.
Then this couenant being thus ſolemnly
made betwixt God & his new ſeruant,
is forthwith ſealed by the ſprinkling, or
dropping on of water; and thus you ſée
that Baptiſme doth confirme, and ſeale
the couenant betwixt God and vs.
            
            
               Father.
               But yet wee ſee there be very few that
haue any care to keepe couenants, and to
performe that ſolēne promiſe which they
haue made in baptiſme before many witneſſes,
yea before God and Angels.
            
            
               Child.
               The greater is their condemnation, &
aſſuredly they ſhal one day know to their

roſt, what it is to dally with God, and to
breake couenants with ſo great a king,
as all they doe, which follow their owne
wayes & their owne luſts, not regarding
the commandements of God.
            
            
               Father.
               What is the reaſon that infants are baptiſed,
ſith they can make no profeſsion of
faith and repentance.?
            
            
               Child.
               There be foure reaſons hereof.Gen. 17. 7.
               
               Firſt becauſe they are the ſéed of the
Church.1. Cor. 7. 14
               
               Secondly,Act. 2. 39. becauſe they are within the
outward couenant.Luk. 18. 16.
               
               Thirdly, becauſe the promiſes belong
vnto them.
               Fourthly, becauſe of ſuch is the kingdome
of heauen. For to bée borne in the
wombe of the Church, is vnto infants in
ſtead of faith and repentance; for faithfull
parents do according to the condition of
the couenant, apprehend the promiſe both
to themſelues & their children, though not
all, for wée muſt leaue vnto God his ſecret
iudgements.
            
            
               Father.
               Hauing thus far ſpoken of the Sacrament

of Baptiſme, let vs now proceede to
ſpeak of the ſacramēt of the lords ſupper,
& firſt tell me what is the ſpecial vſe of it?
            
            
               Child.
               Firſt, it ſerueth to ſeale vnto our conſciences
all the promiſes made in Chriſt,
and all the benefits of his death whatſoeuer;
& therfore there is the ſame vſe of it,
that is of a ſeale, which is to cōfirme and
ratifie a writing. For in outward things
men like wel of a promiſe, but better of a
writing, & beſt of all of a ſeale. Now therfore
the ſacrament is, as it were ye kings
broad ſeale ſet to his generall & frée pardon▪
For all the doctrine of the Goſpel, is
as it were an open proclamation of pardon
to all penitent ſinners, & this ſacrament
is the ſeale of the kings pardon to
ratifie & confirme all the promiſes of the
Goſpell, for a word or promiſe muſt neceſſarily
go before the ſacrament, which
it doth ſeale & confirme vnto vs, & therefore
the ſacraments without the word of
promiſe going before, are as it were a
ſeale to a blanke.
               Secondly, the ſacrament of ye Lords ſupper
is as it were a ſecond ſeale ſet by the

Lords owne hand vnto the former couenant
made in baptiſme which is renued
in the Lords ſupper betwixt ye Lord himſelfe,
& the faithfull receiuer, and that by
the outward actions of eating bread, drinking
wine, &c.
               Thirdly, the Lords ſupper ſerueth to
repreſent vnto vs our continuall féeding
in the houſe of God. For as by baptiſme
we are once admitted into the houſhold
of God: ſo by the Lords ſupper is ſignified
a daily féeding in the ſame vpō Chriſt
and all the promiſes made in him, & alſo
vpon the word which is our moſt ſwéet &
heauenly manna.
            
            
               Father.
               Which bee the outward ſignes in the
Lords ſupper?
            
            
               Child.
               Bread and wine.
            
            
               Father.
               Which be the inward things ſignified?
            
            
               Child.
               The body and blood of Chriſt.
            
            
               Father.
               How receiue you the outward ſignes?
            
            
               Child.
               I receiue them with my hands, eate
them with my mouth, & digeſt them with

my ſtomack.
            
            
               Father.
               How do you receiue the inward things
ſignified?
            
            
               Child.
               Onely by faith, and féede of it as of a
foode giuen me to life euerlaſting.
            
            
               Father.
               Is the bread, and wine then changed into
the ſubſtance of the body and bloud of
Chriſt?
            
            
               Child.
               No; for that were to deſtroy ye nature
of a ſacrament, which muſt conſiſt both
of heauenly, & earthly matter. Therefore
the bread and wine remaine ſtill in their
own forme, nature, & ſubſtāce, but Chriſts
naturall body is in heauen. Therfore the
papiſts would make vs beléeue the moone
is made of a gréen théeſe, whē they beare
vs in hand that bread is changed into
fleſh, and wine into bloud, and Chriſts
naturall body is really preſent in the ſacrament,
and yet we ſée it quite contrary
with our eyes, and a child may diſcerne
that it is neither ſo nor ſo.
            
            
               Father.
               Is there then no difference beetwixt
bread and wine in the ſacrament, & common
bread and wine?
            
            
               
               Child.
               There is no difference eyther in ſubſtance
or forme, but only in the vſe & end
whereunto they are applyed, which is to
repreſent & ſignifie holy things: for wheras
before they were common meat, now
they are holy ſignes, and beare the name
of that thing which they ſignifie: otherwiſe
out of this action they are the ſame
with common bread.
            
            
               Father.
               You ſaid euen now that Chriſts bodie
and blood and all the benefits of his death
are receiued of vs by faith▪ tell me therefore
whether a wicked & vnfaithfull man
can receiue them.
            
            
               Child.
               He cannot: for if they be receiued onely
by faith, how ſhall hée receiue them that
hath no faith? the vnbeléeuers therefore
may receiue the outward ſignes, that
is, the bread and wine as wel as others,
as did Iudas: but the inward thing ſignified,
which is the body and blood of
Chriſt, and all the benefits of his paſſion,
none can receiue, but onely the
elect.
            
            
               
               Father.
               If this be true that all that receiue the
ſhell doe not receiue the kernell: then it
followeth that grace is not neceſſarily tyed
to the outward ſigne or ſacrament.
            
            
               Child.
               True indéed: for otherwiſe the faithleſſe
ſhould gaine as much by the ſacrament
as the faithfull, which were moſt
abſurd, but moſt certaine it is that ſaluation
is not tyed, nor ſhut vp within
the Sacraments, neither doe they giue
grace, but onely teſtifie and aſſure, that
grace is giuen: as ſealed euidences doe
giue no lands which are otherwiſe attayned,
as by inheritance, friendſhip,
and money: but onely teſtifie that they
are giuen, and aſſure the quiet poſſeſſion
and enioying thereof.
            
            
               Father.
               Why did God chooſe theſe creatures of
bread and wine to repreſent vnto vs the
body and blood of Chriſt, rather then
any other earthly creature?
            
            
               Child.
               Becauſe there are none other earthly
creatures that can ſo fitly repreſent vnto

our outward ſenſes, thoſe things
which God would haue vs learne by
this ſacrament.
            
            
               Father.
               What be thoſe things that God would
haue vs learne by this Sacrament?
            
            
               Child.
               By the breaking of the bread we haue
to learne, the breaking of the bodie of
Chriſt vpon the croſſe, and by powring
forth of the wine, the ſhedding of his
blood: and by the diſtributing to all that
are preſent, Chriſts communicating
himſelfe to all that will faithfully receiue
him. By eating and drinking wée
learne, that as bread & wine do nouriſh
our bodies in this life: ſo Chriſts body
and blood do nouriſh our ſoules to life euerlaſting:
and as the ſubſtance of bread
and wine by digeſtion paſſeth into the
ſubſtance of our bodies: euen ſo by faith,
Chriſt and wée are vnited with an vnſpeakable
vnion, and wée made fleſh of
his fleſh, and bones of his bones: and
this is the proportion, and analogie betwixt
the ſigne & the thing ſignified. For
if the ſacraments had not a certaine likeneſſe

of thoſe things wherof they are ſacraments,
then were they no ſacraments
at all.
            
            
               Father.
               What more is to be learned hereby?
            
            
               Child.
               That wée being many are one in
Chriſt, as of many graines is made one
loafe, and of many grapes one wine.
            
            
               Father.
               For as much as the vnworthy receiuer is
dāned as the Apoſtle ſaith,1. Cor. 11. how wilt thou
know, whether thou art a worthie receiuer
or no?
            
            
               Child.
               If I examine my ſelfe, and find that I
humbly acknowledge mine owne vnworthines,
that is to ſay, my ſins, and be
heartely ſorry for them, and fully purpoſe
amendment of life, aſſuredly reſting vpon
ye promiſes of pardon made in Chriſt,
then am I worthy, becauſe mine vnworthines
is forgiuen, & put out of remembrance.
            
            
               Father.
               For whom are the Sacraments ordained?
            
            
               Child.
               The ſacraments are ſpecially ordained
for thoſe which beleeue in Chriſt, and do
ſéeke for remiſſion of ſins, & eternall life

onely through his ſacrifice: for how can
the forgiuenes of ſin bée ſealed vnto the
vnbeléeuers whoſe ſin is not forgiuen?
            
            
               Father.
               Who ought to approach vnto the Lords
ſupper?
            
            
               Child.
               None but ſuch as haue the knowledge
of God in ſome meaſure, or at leaſt, that
haue knowledge in this preſent action,
and ſuch as haue faith, repentance and
loue.
            
            
               Father.
               How ſhall a man know that hee hath
theſe things?
            
            
               Child.
               Thrée wayes: Firſt by his ſetled purpoſe,
& deſire to obey God according to al
the commandements of the law Secondly,
by his loue to the word of god Thirdly,
by his daily fruits towards God and
men.
            
            
               Father.
               Who are to be reiected and put back
from the communion?
            
            
               Child.
               Thrée ſorts of men.
            
            
               Father.
               Which be they?
            
            
               
               Child.
               Firſt, ſtrangers, that is, ſuch as are
vnknowen to the Paſtor, are not to bée
admitted, as it is written:Exo. 12. 45. A ſtranger
ſhall not eate thereof.
               Secondly,1. Cor. 11. 28 Ideots, children, mad men,
and fooles are not to be admitted; for they
cannot examine themſelues according to
the Apoſtles rules.
               
                  Thirdly, notorious euill liuers by
whom the congregation is offended; for
it is written: Giue not that which is holy
vnto dogs.Mat. 7. 6. 
                  Againe, It is forbidden in the
law, that any man being circūciſed ſhould be
admitted to the communicating of the paſſouer,Exo. 12. 41.
becauſe they were polluted by touching a
dead corps,Num. 9. 6. and being at a buriall.Leuit. 13. God gaue
often charges,Leuit. 14. and commaundements in the
law, that if any man had vnwittingly defiled
himſelfe by any legall pollution,Leuit. 15. he might not
enter into his owne houſe, much leſſe approch
vnto the Paſſouer till he was purified, and
cleanſed by offring vp a Sacrifice. Now all
theſe Scriptures do plainely prooue that
no prophane, or filthy perſons: as
whooremongers, drunkards; blaſphemers,
riotters, and ſcoffers at religion,

and ſuch like may be admitted to the holy
communion.
               
            
            
               Father.
               What ſay you to ſuch as ſhew no loue
nor deſire to this holy ordinance of God,
nor once ſo much as offer themſelues vnto
it, except ſometimes at Eaſter a little for
faſhion and law ſake?
            
            
               Child.
               Such do ſhew themſelues to bée little
better then miſcreants, and atheiſts: for
they do contemptuouſly refuſe the grace
of God which hée offreth in this ſupper,
and doubtleſſe to abſtaine of ſet purpoſe
is no leſſe ſinne then to receiue vnworthily.
For that patient which is daungerouſly
ſicke, and yet maketh no account
of the Phiſitions receit and order, deſerueth
no leſſe blame, then hée which abuſeth
the ſame receit, that is, doth not vſe
it according to that diet and order that
was preſcribed him.
            
            
               Father.
               If ſome very bad perſons chaunce to
creepe in, or thruſt in themſelues to bee
partakers of this holy inſtitution, is therfore
the whole action defiled?
            
            
               
               Child.
               God forbid: for wée read throughout
the ſcriptures that good & bad haue béene
mingled together in matters of Gods
worſhip and ſeruice, both word, prayer,
ſacraments and ſacifices: and ſure it is,
that the wickednes of the wicked cannot
defile or pollute either the Sacrament it
ſelfe, or any of the godly communicants,
but onely themſelues.
            
            
               Father.
               Are all to be admited to the ſacrament
of the Lords ſupper, which profeſſe ſaith
and repentance either in truth or in ſhew?
            
            
               Child.
               Yes▪ Vnleſſe there bée ſome ſpeciall exceptions
taken againſt them.Exo. 12. 47. For it is
written, al the cōgregation of Iſrael ſhal
obſerue it through their generations,
that is to ſay, all the members of the viſible
Church which are within the outward
couenant.
            
            
               Father.
               How ought miniſters to deale with many
ignorant & ſimple men, & ſeely ſoules
which are able to yeeld ſmall reaſon of
their faith: are they all to be admitted to

the communion, or all to be reiected?
            
            
               Child.
               As miniſters ought not raſhly to accept
of all that offer themſelues without
examination and conference: ſo ought
they not lightly to ſhut out any from
that which ſhould ſeale vp their remiſſion
of ſinnes▪ For albeit they be ſomewhat
ignorant and ſimple, yet finding
in them any ſéeds of religion, and ſparks
of the feare of God, ſhewing it ſelfe in
ſome tractableneſſe to know God, and in
loue to the word, they are to admit them
with encouraging and exhorting them
to go forward. But if with ignorance
and blindneſſe, be ioyned either froward
contempt of meanes, or méere careleſneſſe,
or open wicked behauiour, or profane
diſſolutenes without remorſe when
they be dealt withall; Then they
are with all mildneſſe to
be ſhut out.
            
            All glory be giuen to God.
            FINIS.
