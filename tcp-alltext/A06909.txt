I was the gladder to take

it in hande, bycause no man hath as yet perfectly entreated of this matter, neither in the Greke,The cause of makyng this worke Latin, nor Englysshe tonge, that euer I could se.

It is but an easy thyng to pray, but to praye aright & accordynge to the wyll of God, is a thyng of gret difficulte & much labour. We thinke it an hard thing to speake vnto a terrestiall Prynce with wordes conueniēt, apte & decent, & is it but

a trifle to speake to the moost hyghe Prynce, in whose syght the moost eloquent is very barbarous, and the moost holye, prophane? I haue therfore in this my treatyse followynge declared what praier is,The contē
                  tes of this Boke. wherfore it serueth, & vnto what end we should vse it. I haue also declared of what vertue & strength the true & christē praier is, & howe we should prepare our selues to prayer, that we maye praye aright, & accordyng to Gods pleasure. And for asmuche as some men are of so scrupulous, I had almoost sayd, supersticious consciēce, ye they thynke no prayer to be herd, but that only whiche is prayed in y• chirch, or some other sacred place, as they call it, I haue declared both by Scriptures & auncient Doctours, in what place it is lawfull to praye. Againe I haue declared after what maner men should praye, that God maye accepte theyr prayer, and for

what thynges they should pray, yea & at what tyme. And in asmuche as this word Prayer doth contayne in it not only Peticion, but also thankes gyuyng for the benefyte that is receyued, therfore haue I also declared my mynde concernynge gyuing of thanckes to God the Father thorow Iesus Christ.Colos. iii. All these thinges haue I done in this lytle worke accordynge to the true vayne of ye holy scriptures & the iudgemēt of the best learned Doctors, seking in this my laboure only the glory of God, & the profyte of his holy congregaciō. Which thynge yf it shall maye come to passe, I shall not only not repent me, but verye muche reioyce in the LORDE of this my trauayle, & shall hereby be encouraged after this, to take in hande other argumentes of no lesse vtilite & profyte.

And this is y• very same thing that Christ teacheth in y• Gospell of Mathewe,Math. vi. where he sayth: Whan y• prayest, thou shalte not be lyke to y• Hypocrites. For theyr manner is to stonde prayenge in ye Synagoges & in the corners of the stretes, that mē maye se thē, Certes I saye vnto you they haue theyr reward. But wha

He cōmaundeth vs to enter into oure closet, & to sparre our dore. What other thynge meaneth Christe by this, but that, as I haue sayde before, we should expulse all tēporall thynges out of our hartes, whansoeuer we entend to pray, & haue our myndes altogyther set vpon celestiall & heauenly thynges?Mark wel & followe. Therfore ought so many as entend to praye with fruyte to seke an occasion to be seguestred from all temporall affaires & from the troubles of wordely thynges, whiche myght be

an impediment to them in theyr holy meditacions, & so to be free from all externall & mundane thynges, y• theyr prayer in dede maye be a very lyftynge vp, according to the begynnynge of our diffinicion.

                  ANd that this thynge maye the more conueniently be brought to passe, it shalbe expedient for such as intende to exercyse prayer to repose them selues and to sette theyr hertes quiette from all the troubles of the worlde, yea & to subduce & conuaye thē selues from the cōpany of the worldely people into some secrete & solitarye place for the tyme of theyr prayer, that they maye the more frely gyue theyr myndes to deuout & holy meditacion, as the maner of many holy men was in times paste.

And yet sayth the scripture she spake in her herte. Her lippes only moued,Luke. vii. but her voyce was hearde nothynge at all.

As though he shoulde saye, all that euer is done wtout the herte, is vayne, vnfruytefull, yea & playne abhominacion before God, rather workynge dānaciō then saluacion to the doers of it, as Christ sayeth:Mat. xv. This people honoure me wt theyr lyppes, but theyr herte is farre from me. Uerely they worshyp me in vayne. Thus se we proued by the scripture, that Prayer is the worke of the herte, of the spiryte of the mynde, & not of mouth & lyppes. But let vs heare what the Doctors saye to this matter.

If we shall at the daye of iudgemēt render an accountes of euerye ydle worde yt we speake, as the holy scripture testifyeth, what is then to be thought of those wordes, whiche we vnfruitfully waste, whē we pretend

outwardly to pray, & yet inwardly haue our myndes entāgled wt ye care of worldly thīges, or els entysed frō the affecciō of prayer with vayne cogitacions of thynges carnall.

To praye nothyng at al is iniquite & playne synne,Note. but to pretende outwardly an holy maner of prayenge, & yet not praye in dede in our hertes, is double iniquite, & encreaseth much dānaciō vnto vs, as we haue hearde heretofore, in asmuch as we are dissemblers both before God & mā. But let vs heare what S. John Chrisostome sayeth:Homel. xii. Demul. canan. Many cōmynge into the chyrch do extende & streytch out theyr prayer vnto a thousand verses, as though the multitude of wordes were nedeful

Theyr lyppes are moued only, but theyr mide is without fruyte, & therfore are y• eares of God deafe. Thou heareste not thine owne prayer, & wylt thou that y• 
                     LORDE should heare thy prayer? I haue bowed, yu sayst, my knees. Thou hast bowed in dede thy knees wythin, but thy mynde wādreth abroad. Thy body is within, but thy thought is without. Thy mouth in dede spake, but thy mynd dyd thike vpon vsuries. It dyd count the reuenewes of thy possessions. It dyd behold the descripcions & valowynges of houses. It remēbred the wordes of thy frendes. It loked vpon y• negligenses of thy seruauntes. It laughed at the pleasaunt iestyng of the Pharasites. It consydered the

But thou wylte saye peraduēture, I haue no doughter, whiche is replete with the dyuell, but yu hast a soule, whiche is stuffed full of synne.Homil. lxxix. De oratione. Agayne he sayth, If whan ye bodye lyghtethe prostrate vpon the grounde, & the mouth bableth vaynly, the mynde goeth about the house and market, how maye such one say that he hath prayed in the syghte of God. For he prayeth in the syght of GOD, which gathereth altogyther his mynde quietly, & hath nothyng to do wt the worlde, & lyfteth vp himselfe euen vnto heauen, and putteth out of his mynd al humayn thoughtes. For he yt prayeth, must so praye, that he settethe his mynde at quiet

from worldly thynges, & calleth on God with a sorowfull and contryte herte. Neyther maye he vse many wordes, nor draw out his prayer on a great length, but speake fewe wordes, yea & those symple, playne and homely. For not in the multitude of wordes, but in ye quycknes of mynd doth the whole matter consyst, that we should be heard.Ibidem. Once agayne he saith: In prayer ther is not so much nede of the voyce as of the thought, nor of the stretchyng out of ye hādes as of the intencion of the mynde.

are i vayne, yf the mynd be not present in the tyme of prayer. I wyl pray in spiryte, sayth Paule,i. Cor. xiiii. and I wyll praye also in mynde. I wyll synge in Spirite, and I wyll synge also in mynde. Therfore ye it maye be prayed aryght, let euery mā say, farewel to al humayne affayres and worldely matters, and so quietly repose himselfe, while he prayeth, that accordyng to our diffiniciō, his prayer in very dede may be a lystynge vp of the mynde.

excepte it be pure. It wyll be obiected, than shall we neuer praye. For who can say, my herte is cleane and I am pure from synne?Pro. xx. i. Ioan. i. I aunswere: If ye saye, we haue no synne, we deceyue our selues, & the trueth is not in vs. But yf we confesse our synnes, God is faythfull & ryghteous to forgyue vs oure synnes, and make vs cleane from all vnryghteousnes. The scripture sayth,Psal. xxxi. Rom. iiii. blessed are they whose iniquities are forgyuen, & whose sinnes are couered, blessed is that man to whom the LORDE hathiputed no synne. It sayth not Blessed are they, which haue no iniquities, or which haue no sinne. For S. James sayethe:Iaco. iii. In many thynges we synne al. So long as we are in this mortall flesshe we can neuer be pure & cleane from the dregges of synne, yf from the synne it selfe. We can neuer in this lyfe aspyre vnto so great perfeccion of innocency, that

we maye appeare pure & gyltelesse in the syghte of God,Iob. xxv. in whose eies ye very sterres & Aūgels be not clene. Howe than maye we praye wythe & pure mynde?Learne here howe we may praye▪ wyth a faythfull mynde. Uerely yf oure mynde be faythfull to God, & charitable to our neyghbour, God doth dissemble all our faultes, & in as muche as we are faythfull vnto hym, & louyng to oure christen brothers, he counteth vs all pure,i. Ioan. iii. as S. Iohn sayth: He y• is borne of God, sinneth not, that is to saye, he that beleueth in God,Mark wel. his synne is not imputed vnto hym, in asmuch as he consenteth not to the synne, but hongreth and thyrstethe after the perfeccion of true innocency. Our hertes be purifyed by fayth sayeth the scripture,Act. xv. so that who so euer prayeth with a faythfull & charitable mynde, he is counted before God to praye with a pure mynde.God and the worlde iu

But God beholdeth the mynde, the herte, ye inwarde man, & loketh whither he prayeth in purite & cleanes or not. If the herte be stuffed with fayth & charite, then is God well pleased, & accepteth the prayer for an hygh & pleasaunt Sacryfyce. Who beynge in the temple hearynge the proude Pharise,Luk. xviii. & the poore Publicane prayeng togyther would not haue estemed the Pharise to be more ryghteous & pure in y• syght of God, then ye wretched Publicane▪ For the Pharise confessed no syn, but vertues many.

Fyrste bycause that with an humble herte he came to God for remission of his synnes, beleuyng to obtayne it. Secondely, seynge that he accused no mā but himselfe only. Therfore went he home more iustifyed, sayeth the holye Scripture. Therfore to all suche as outwardly pretende holynes,Mat. xxi. & yet are vnpure in theyr mynde, Christe sayeth.

                     Abell also & Caym offred both sacrifices to god,Gen. iiii. & the scripture sayth that God loked vnto Abell & vnto his gyftes, but vnto Caym and vnto his giftes he loked not. God iudgeth not y• personne of the acte but the arte of the personne. It is here to be noted, that God not after the fasshyon of the world iudgeth ye person of the acte, but the acte of ye person. He fyrste loketh to the person, & afterward vnto the acte, as the holy scripture sayeth here. He loked vnto Abell, & vnto his gyftes. Fyrst vnto Abell, & afterward vnto Abels gyftes. If the person be good, that is, faythful & charitable, thā doth God accepte the gyfte, not for the dignite of the gifte it selfe, but for ye faith of him that offereth.Psal. xv. Psal. xxiii. For as ye Psalmograph sayeth, God hath no nede of oure goodes. The earth is y•

                  As concernynge that the Scripture sayth, God loked vnto Abell, it signifieth that God fauoured Abel,

                  As touchynge that the scripture sayeth, God loked not vnto Caym & vnto his gyftes, it sygnifyethe that God neyther fauoured Caym, nor yet accepted his gyftes, seynge that Caym had in him neyther fayth nor Charitie. For his herte was stuffed full of yre & wrath towarde his brother Abell, in so much that shortely after it came to passe accordynge to his pretensed malyce, that he slewe his brother. And wherfore dydde he slaye hym▪
                     1. Ioan. iii. verely bycause his owne workes were euell, and his brothers ryghteous. Thus sewe, that be our gyftes neuer so precious in ye syght of men,Ec. xxxiiii. yet yf the gyuer be wicked, that is, vnfaythefull and vncharytable,

God vtterlye contēneth & setteth thē at noughte, as the wyse mā sayeth: The gyftes of the wycked, y• moost hygh doth not alowe and approue. S. Iustē also sayth,Det. ccxxvi.

The good LORDE is not wonte to attende & gyue hede to those thinge that are done of vs, but vnto the inwarde mynde, wherof we are moued to do these thynges.

For Prayer is a lyftyng vp of a pure mynde vnto God. Unto God ought we to lyfte vp oure hartes, when we pray,Psa. cxxii. as ye Psal. sayth, vnto ye haue I lyfted vp myne eyes, which dwellest ī heuē Agein, I haue lyfted vp myne eyes into the Mountaynes, frō whence helpe may cōe vnto me.Psal. cxx. My helpe cometh frō ye 
                     LORD which made heauen & earth. Also in another place,Psal. cxix. when I was in trouble, I cryed vnto the LORDE, & he fauourably heard me.Psa. xxxiii. 1. Pet. iii. Psa. xxiiii. The eyes of the LORDE are vpō the ryghteous, and his eares are bent vnto theyr prayers. Myne eyes, sayeth Dauid, are

cryed Adam, Abell, Seth, Enos, Enoch, Nohe, Thare, Abrahā, Isaac, Iacob, Ioseph, Moses, Aaharon, Ietro, Eleazar, Phinees, Iosue, Caleb Othoniel, Gedeon, Helcana, Samuell, Nathan, Dauid, Salomon, Helias, Micheas, Elizeus, Ezechias, Esaias, Iosias, Iob, Mathatias, Thoby, wt all the other auncient fathers & holye Prophetes of the olde Testament, but vnto GOD alone. Agayne vnto whom prayed Ioseph Iohn̄ Baptiste, Lazarus, Nicodemus, Gamaliel, Cornelius, Apollo, Dionisius, Aquilia, Steuen, Philip, Agabus, Ananias, Timothe, Titus, Ioses, Philemon, and all the Apostles, with many other, whiche are contayned in ye volumes of both Testamentes, but vnto God alone? The prayed, and were heard. Shall oure Prayers than be vayne,Esa. xxviii yf we pray with that same purite of mind that they dyd? The scripture sayth:

Who so euer beleuethe in God,Rom. x. Ioel. ii. Act. ii. shall not be confounded. For there is no differēce betwene Iewe & Gentyle. For one is LORDE of all, whiche is rytche ynough vnto all that call on hym. For whosoeuer shall call on the name of the LORDE, he shall be safe, Let vs therfore trust in God,Psa. lxi. poure out oure hartes before hym, lament our cause to him, desyrynge to haue his mooste gracious ayde & helpe in all our trouble & aduersitie, and we may be sure to obtayne whatsoeuer we aske accordynge vnto his wyll,1. Ioan. v. & to seale remedye so present, that nothynge can be wysshed nerer.

If we searche ye holy volumes of the deuine scriptures we shall easely perceyue, that they whiche prayed, dyd neuer praye but for vrgent and ryght necessary causes. As for an example:Exo. xxxii.

                     Therfore the nexte & moost redy waye for a man to prepare hymselfe to praye aright, & with a feruent spiryte & hungry mynde, is to knowe & graūt hymselfe to be a synner, and ye therfore he hath great nede to pray.
               
               
                  ¶ The. xiiii. Chapter.
                  SEcōdly, whē he hath once thorowly debated & beaten we hiselfe his owne misery, wretchednes, synne, & abhominaciō, & perceyuethe that to be delyuered therof, ther is no other waye, but only by the mercy of God thorowe prayer, he muste streyghte wayes set before his eyes the Commaundement of God, which after ye knowledge & confession of his synne commaundeth hym to praye. And here ought he not a lytle to reioyse. For who, whā he hath ones offended God, durste be so bolde as once to desyre pardon of his offence, & to pray vnto God for mercy, yf God himself had not commaundes him so to do?

Uerely no man.Beholde what sinne both. For the transgression of Gods cōmaundement doth so confounde the consicience of ye trāsgressour, that it soner dryueth hym vnto desperacion, than to any hope of helpe or fauour.Gen. iii. This is well proued by Adam, which, when he hadde once broken Gods precepte in Paradyse, fled streyghtwayes from ye face of God, hyd hym, & soughte all meanes possible no more to come īto his syght.Gen. iiii. Howe was Caym also confoū
                     ded in his conscience whē he had kylled his brother Abell, thoughe there was yet no lawe raygnynge? Was he not so consternate & stryken with suche feare, that he sayd: Euery one that fyndeth me, wyll kyll me? was he not ashamed so greatly of his mā slaughter, that he sayd, mine iniquite is greater thē I maye deserue for gyuenes? Dyd he not flye frō ye face of the LORDE, so farre as he myght. Agayn,Mat. xxvi was not Iudas so ashamed

of his dede whan he had solde Christ to the Bysshoppes & heade prestes, ye he brought the mony agayne to thē, & sayde, I haue synned, betrayenge the innocent bloud?Act. ii Dyd not synne so cōfoūd & slay his cōsciēce at ye last, that he went & hāged vp hymselfe, & when he was hanged, dydde not he brast a sūder in the myddes, and all his bowels gusshed out? Who being a Traytoure dare come before the Kynges maiesty to desyre pardon of his offence? Yea who rather beynge fauty in that detestable sinne, fieth not from hys graces presence in to straunge countreyes, that he maye be free and withoute punyshment? For the rewarde of synne is deathe.Rom. vi. Therfore I saye ought he that knoweth & graūteth himselfe to be a sinner very muche to reioyce that God for his offence hath cōmaunded him to praye, whiche els durst nothynge lesse than once to attēpte for to approche

before the diuyne maiesty we onye kynde of prayer,The nature of sinne & when synne shall laboure accordynge vnto ye nature therof for to condemne the conscience, & to expell from the herte all sayth, cōfidence, & trust in God, thā to erecte, eleuate & lyfte vp himselfe by gyuyng sure & vndoubted fayth to the cōmaūdement of God, which commaundeth hym to praye, we this perswasion, that God hath not commaūded him for to praye in vayne. He muste therfore put these & suche lyke Comaundementes euer before his eyes,Mat. vi. Psal. xlix. Mat. xi. Aske, Seke, Knocke, watch praye. Agayne, call on me in the day of trouble. Come vnto me al ye that labour & are ladē. All ye that thyrst come vnto the waters.Esa. xliiii. And ye that haue no mony make hast, by & eate. Come & bye withoute mony, & withoute ony marchaundyse, wyne and mylke. These moost gentle & louyng commaundementes of God cōforte

the sorowefull mynde of the synner greatly, & engraffe in him a certayn gladnes & hope for to obtayne remissiō of his synnes, seyng ye God so boū
                     teonsly commaundeth him to pray.
               
               
                  ¶ The. xv. Chapter.
                  THyrdely when he hathe on this maner poudered the cōmaundement of God, wherwt he is prouoked to praye, than doth cōuenient tyme requyre that he also consydereth the moost louynge, gentle, & bounteous promises of God, in the which he promyseth for to heare vs, & to graunte vs oure peticions. For what doth it profyt for to aske & not to obtayne? If God had only cōmaunded vs to praye, and not also promysed for to heare vs, & gentelly to gyue vs oure desyres, what greate pleasure had he done for vs? what had he done for the which we had nede once to saye, LORDE God a mercy? What syngulare benefite had we receyued of hi?

But although ye Cōmaundement to pray putteth vs i good confort, yet whā we are promysed also graciously to be heard, this maketh vs vnfainedly to reioyce & seriouslye to tryumph. This maketh vs to put oure of oure herte all doloure & sadnes, & to be replete with all myrthe & gladnes. The promyses of God brynge quietnes to the conscience,The promysce of God. huarite to the herte, tranquilitie & peace to the soule. No man is able to expresse howe much & howe great ioye lyeth buried vp in the diuyne promises, & how feruent consolacion the synner taketh by the hearyng of thē.Gen. iii. What ioye thynke ye was thys vnto Adā for to heare after his offence, that ye sonne of GOD should be borne of a pure mayde, & tread downe the Serpētes head, that is, subdue Satā & deliuer Adam wt all his posterite frō his tyranny, bryng thē agayne into the fauoure of God, & make thē heyres

of eternall glory?Gen. xxii. What cōforte I praye you was this to faythefull Abrahā for to heare that in his seed all nacious of the earthe shoulde be blessed? What a great pleasure was this to ye Israelites,Num. xxi. whē they were greuously stynged & slayne of the fyry serpentes for theyr disobedience, to heare this promyse of God: make a brasē serpēt, & set it vp for a signe He that is stryken & loketh vpon it, shall lyue?Iosue. i. What exceadyng cōforte receyued Iosue by thys promyse of God vnto him: I wyll not leaue the neyther wyll I forsake the. Be therfore strōge & take a good herte vnto the? As I maye come nerer to oure matter,Ioel. ii. Act. ii. Rom. x. howe much ioye, consolaciō & pleasure haue the faythfull fealte of this one promyse of God: Euerye one that callethe on the name of the LORDE, shall be saued?
                  Therfore in this behalfe the promises of God must be earnestly wayed,

 pondered & consydered.The promyses of God are oure only conforte. In them must we reste, & dailye as in a moost pleasaūt Herboure. In thē must we repose oure selues. In them must be all oure delyghte, pleasure & felicite. The chefe promises concernynge Prayer are these.Psa. xxxvi. Delyghte thou in the LORDE, & he shall giue the, the peticiōs of thy herte.Psal xlix. Call on me sayth God in the daye of thy trouble, & I wyll delyuer the, and thou shalte honour me.Psa. ixxxx Agayne he sayth: Seynge that he hath put his truste in me, I wyll delyuer hym, & I wyll defende hym, in asmuche as he hath knowen my name. He cryed vnto me, and I wyll graciously heare hym, I am we hym in tribulacion, I wyll delyuer hym & glorify hym. With the length of dayes wyll I replenysh hym, and shewe hym my sauynge helth. Christ also saith:Mat. xi. Come vnto me all ye that labour & are laden, & I shall refresh you. Euery one that is a thyrste, let

hym come to me & drynke.Ioan. vii. Mat. vi. Agayne, aske, & it shall be gyuen you. Seke & ye shall fynde. Knocke & it shall be opened vnto you. For euery one that asketh, receyueth, & he that seketh, fyndeth, & to hym ye knocketh, it shal be opened. If the sone asketh breade of ony of you, whiche is his father, wyl ye profer him a stone? or yf he asketh fysh,Luke. xi. wyll ye gyue hym a Serpent? or yf he aske an Egge, wyll ye profer hym a Scorpion? If ye than which are euell, know howe to gyue good gyftes to your chyldren, howe much more shall your father celestiall gyue the holy ghost to them that desyre it of hym? These & suche lyke promises of God, must he that intē
                     deth to pray set before his eyes, that he cōforted with the remembraunce of them, maye with the more frācke courage gyue himselfe to godly and deuout prayer at all tymes.

                     Fayth gyuen vnto the promyses of godFOurthly when he hath on this maner confyrmed & establyshed his mynde with the contēplacion & beholdynge of the diuyne promises, he maye not dout any thynge at all of them, but faythfully beleue & vndoutedly perswade hymselfe ye they are true, in asmuch as they are the promises not of man but of GOD, which cā not lye,Cit. l. Psa. cxliiii whiche is true, yea whiche is the selfe trueth, whiche is faythfull in all his wordes, & holy in al his workes, whose worde & trueth also abyde for euer and euer.Esay. xi. For though God be neuer so mercyfull, & bounteous in gyftes,Note wel. yet yf we do not beleue that his mercy & bounte pertayne also to vs, we are neuer ye better. Let it so be, that whā a tray tour for his offence cōmitted agenst the Kynges maiesty,Mark this Example flyeth beyonde the sees into a straung countrey by cause he wyll eschewe the daunger of the lawe, & escape ye payne due for

his offence, the Kynges grace hathe pitie on hym, pardon his faulte, and sende ouer his letters vnto hym, wherī is declared the kynges great mercy & gentlenes toward him, and wylleth hym to returne into his natyue countre, & there agayne to enioye the benefytes of the same, & of all other that he possessed before, yea & that with no lesse fauoure, than he dydde in tymes paste, whan he was mooste estraunged from that faulte of treason: yf the Traytour not beleuynge the wordes of the moost gracious & free pardon, woulde contēne & despyse it, recountyng it to be but a vayne gloose, & of no trueth, what should the kynges gentlenes in this behalfe profytte hym? The kynge is mercyfull, but the traytoure is vnfaythfull. Therfore receyueth he no commoditie by the kynges pardon. And yet is not the faulte in ye kyng, but in the traytour, which beleueth

not that glad and merye tydynges.
                  
                     Another example.Agayne: Be it in case, that a cunnyng & learned Phisiciō come vnto a sycke man, promisynge hym helpe & delyueraunce of his dysease, & yet yf the sycke parsō beleueth hym not, but setteth nought by hym, & despyseth his medicines what doth it profytte him? What is he holpen by the presence of the Phisiciō, be he neuer so cūnynge? What doth the redines of helpe profyt him, yf he refuseth to take & enioye it? Uerely nothyng at all. In lyke maner be God neuer so mercyfull & boūteous, & neuer so redy to helpe vs, yet yf we beleue hym not to be so, his mercye, bounty and assistēce profyt vs nothynge at all.Psa. cxliiii The Psalmograph sayeth not only, the LORDE is nygh to all that cal on hym, but he addeth, to al that call on hym in trueth.To cal on God in truethe, what it is What is it to call on God in trueth, but to beleue earnestly that he wyll trulye performe hys

promyses, & do in all thynges as he hath promysed?Psa. lxxxiiii. Agayne, Dauid sayeth: Mercy & trueth haue mette togyther, ryghteousnes & peace haue kyssed one another.Mark this Exposiciō
                      What is this, mercy & trueth haue mette togither but that as God is mercyfull in makynge his promises, so is he true in perfourmynge them? Agayne, what meaneth this, righteousnes & peace haue kyssed one another, but only to shewe, that the ryghteousnes of god in fulfyllynge his promises, and the trāquilite of cōscience haue ioyned them selues togyther in the hertes of the faythfull.
                  Therfore yf we do not obtayne ye hygh treasures & great pleasures ye God hath promised let vs impute it to nothynge els but only to our vnfaithfulnes.Heb. xi. For S.

Agen he saith haue ye ye faith of GOD, ye is to saye, asure pswasiō & confydence of the promyses of the grace & mercy of God, & learne ye to assent & agre to the diuyne promyse which thyng yf ye shall do, verely I saye vnto you, all thynges that ye aske whan ye praye, beleue ye ye shall receyue them, & they shall chaūse to you, as he sayth, al that euer ye aske whan ye praye, beleue that ye shall haue thē, & they shall chaunse vnto you,Math. ix. We read that whan two blynd men desyred Christe to make thē for to se, he sayd vnto thē, do ye beleue ye I am able to do this thynge? They aunswared, we beleue LORDE. Thā sayd Christe vnto thē, accordyng to your faythe, be it to you. And theyr

                      Enter not in to iudgement, O LORDE, sayeth he, with thy seruaunt, for no man that lyueth shalbe iustifyed in thy syght. Nowe thā could he set out his owne ryghteousnes before GOD, that he myghte be iustifyed by it? What shall we then saye to this matter?Note thys Solucion: I aunswere, yea & that not wythoute the authoritie of the holy scriptures & the mynde of the aunciente Doctors, that as in dyuers other places of the Psalmes, so in these and such lyke he speakethe in the parsonne of Christe, and not in his owne. He speketh of Christes innocency, puryte, ryghteousnes & vertue, & not of his owne. He representeth Christes parson, & not his owne. Whan he speaketh in his owne parson, he graunteth

hymselfe alwayes a synner, seketh helth of God, & desyreth not to be heard for his owne ryghteousnes but for Gods ryghteousnes, whiche is Iesus Christ. So that ī Christes name he offered vp his prayers vnto God the father,Exo. xii. Ioan. i. as all the faythfull ought to do. For Christ is the lambe wtout spotte. Christ is that lambe of God, which taketh away ye synne of the worlde.Mat. iii. Christ is that dearly beloued sonne, for whose sake God the father is well pleased with men. Christ is that Byshop,Heb. vii. which is godly, innocente, vndefyled & segregate from synners.Ioan. x. Christ is the dore, by whome alone we muste come to the father.Math. i.

I am, I am he, which putteth awaye thyne iniquities, yea & that for myne owne sake. (Marke ye he sayeth, for myne owne sake.) And wyll remēber thy synnes no more.

But whan Judith that vertuous woman hearde of it, she sayde: Why haue ye consented to

gyne ouer the citie vnto the Assyrianes, yf helpe commeth not vnto you from the LORDE within fiue dayes? What are you that thus tempte the LORD? This is not a sayēg for to prouoke mercye, but rather to store vp yre, & to kyndle furor. Daue ye appoynted ye tyme of the LORDES mercy? & haue ye appoynted hym a daye at youre pleasure?

Therfore do we on thys manner praye in the Pater noster:Math. vi. Forgyue vs oure dettes, euen as we forgyue our detters. And Christ sayth forgyue, and it shall be forgyuen you.

Whan he was not able to paye, hys Lorde cōmaunded hym to be folde, & his wyfe, & his Chyldren, & all that euer he had, & payment to be made. The seruaūt fell downe, & worshypped hym, sayenge: LORDE be pacient toward me, & I wyll paye the all togyther. The LORD had pitie on that seruaunt, losoned hym, and forgaue hym all that he ought. But that seruaunte goynge forth founde one of his fellow seruauntes, which ought hym an hundred pence, and layenge hād on hym, & tahīg him by ye throte

He would not, but went his waye, & cast him ito pryson, vntyll he should paye the dette. Dhan his fellow seruauntes saw that which was done, they lamēted verye sore, & came, and openned vnto theyr Lorde all those thynges that were done. Than dyd theyr LORDE call hym, & sayde vnto hym, thou vngracious seruaunt, I forgaue the all that dette, whē thou desyredst me, had it not ben conuenient also, that yu shouldest haue had pitie on thy fellow seruaunt? And his LORDE beyng angry, cōmytted him to the Ialours, vntyll he should pay all that was due vnto hym. Christe concludethe: So lykewyse shall my heauenly father do vnto you, yf euery one of you euen from y• very hert doth not forgyue hys brother theyr

offences. Hereof doth it appere more clerely than the lyghte, that excepte we forgyue, we shall neuer be forgyuen,Prayers done out of charite please not God. neyther can ony thynge please God that we do, yf it be done out of charitie. For the worde of God abydeth fyrme, sure, & constant for euermore.

For wher so euer thou be, thou mayst make and appoynt thyne altare. For the place hyndereth nothynge, neyther dothe the tyme let, but though thou doste not bowe thy knees, nor knocke thy brest, nor stretche out thy handes to heauen, yet mayst thou pray aright & make thy prayer perfecte, so that thou only shewest & bryngest forth a feruēt mynde. For thou mayst whā thou goest vnto markette, & walkest by thy selfe alone, make longe prayers. Thou mayst also syttynge ī thy shoppe, & sowynge skynnes dedicate

thy soule vnto the LORDE. The seruaunt also that byeth, or goeth vp & downe, & the Cooke doyng his office whan he can not go to chyrche, may make a prayer longe & discrete. For God disdaineth not the place, but requyreth one thynge, that is to saye, a feruent mynde, & a pure soule. For Paule also, not in an Oratory, but in the prison lyenge wyde open, nor stondynge ryghte vp, nor bowynge his knees, for the clogge, wherwyth his feete were bound, dyd not suffer hym, yet seynge that he lyenge prayed feruently, he shaked the prysonne vnlosoned the foundacions, & dydde bynd the keper of the pryson, & afterward brought hym vnto holy religion. And Ezechias not stōding right vp, nor bowynge hys knees, but lyeng wyde open in his bedde bycause of his syckenes, whā he turned hymselfe vnto the wall, in asmuche as he called vpon God feruently & wyth a

And the these beyng stretched out vpon the crosse, wyth fewe wordes purchased the heauēly kyngdome. And Ieremy in the myre and lake, & Daniel in the prysone and amonge the wylde beastes. And Ionas in the belly of a whale, prayeng vnto God, dyd both dissolue all maner of euels, wherwith they were beseged, cōpassed & set about, and also found fauoure at the hande of God, what than oughteste thou to saye, when thou prayest? Uerely euen the same thynge that the woman of Canane dyd. For euē as she sayd. Haue meroye on me, my doughter is greuously vexed of a dyuell, so say thou lykewyse, haue mercye vpon me, my soule is very greuously vexed of a diuell. For synne is a great dyuell, she y• had the dyuell dyd fynde mercy, &

yet was she hated; whā she dyd syn? Haue mercy on me, is but a short saienge, yet doth it contayns an whole see of mercy. For wher soeuer mercy is, ther are all good thīges. Though thou be without the chyrch, cry, sayeng, haue mercy on me though thou dost not moue thy lyppes, but onlye crye in thy mynde. For God also heareth them that holde theyr peace. Ther is no place to be sought, but a begynnyng of a place. Ieremy was in the myre, & he made God bounteous vnto hym by prayer. Iob was on ye dunge hyll, & he made God mercyfull vnto hym. Ionas was in the whales bellye, & he had God gentle to hym. Though thou be in a vayne praye. Wher so euer thou be, praye. Thou arte the temple, seke no place. The see was before the Iewes, and the Egipcians behynd at theyr backes, & Moses in the myddes speking nothynge, for he was greatlye troubled

in his prayer, yet sayd God vnto hym, what cryest thou to me? In lyke maner thou therfore, whan soeuer temptacion shal come vpon the, flye vnto God, & call on the LORDE. Is he a mā, that thou shouldest seke after a place? God is euer at hande. For thou yet spekynge, he wyll say: Beholde here I am presente. Thou hast not yet made thy praier, and he bryngethe helpe. For yf thou haste a mynde pure from vncleane mociōs, though thou be in the market, or in way, or in the consystory, or in ye see, or in the ynne, or in the shyppe, or in onye other place of the worlde, loke where so euer thou calleste on God, there mayest yu obtayne thy peticiō.

For this humiliacion of our selues helpeth greatly to the auaūcement of our prayer. For the more that ony man deiecteth & throweth downe himselfe, the nerer is he made vnto God.Luk. xviii.

For the LORDE is hyghe, & yet doth he beholde humble thynges, he knoweth high thynges a farre of, he despyseth the hawty, & loketh on the prayer of ye hūble, & the prayer of thē doth not he despyse.

and doth seruyce vnto that. For seinge the glory of God ought to shine after a certayne māner in all ye partes of our body,Why she tonge was made. it is cōuenient that the tonge chefely be addicte & giuen to this ministry and seruyce both in syngynge and speakyng, which was chefely made to declare and preache the magnificence, laude & prayse of God. Therfore so that the tong and the herte do consent and agre togyther, beyng alyke occupied in the effusiō of the prayer, it is not only tollerable, but also cōmendable to pray both with tonge and herte.
