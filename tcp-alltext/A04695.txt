               AFter that a certayne
lytle boke was putte
forthe in latyn, to sustayne
the publyque

that know the tongue

                  •
                to be punyshed: I was desyred to
wryte a contrarye consultacion. That
Adulterers ought to be punyshed, and
that in Englyshe, that all men myght
knowe, howe parellous was the tytle of
the latyne boke, and howe vngodly the
autor therof had peruerted and wrested
the holy scryptures to make thē seme to
serue his detestable errour. But not lōg
after this latyn writer recanted & altered
the tytle of hys boke, permittyng al his
false argumētes, weake reasons and his
vayne probacyons for hys parte to stād
styll, nether recāted ne remoued. Which
monstrose boke hauynge yet so manye
false argumentes, nothynge now correspondynge
the newe tytle, when it was
reade, I was the more importunelye of
manye desyred to confute it, and to put
forthe m

                boke in Englyshe. All be it

some there were, whiche semed to be offended,
that I answered not in latyne,
whyche ought rather to haue bene offended
wyth so false and vnlearned a boke
to be put forth of any of their famylie, &
also to haue estiewed the dedicaciō therof,
that afterward, as he was compelled
to recant the tytle, so is he not able to defende
hys boke, ne to iustyfie hys argumentes
made for Adulterers not to be
punyshed. And of what learnynge and
iudgement, and howe affected were they
(thyncke ye) whyche perusyng the boke
before it was printed, praysed it so hyghly?
Oh wycked flatery. Howe swete is

Agayn, whether adultery be not as

earnestly forboden to vs, at it was and is
to the Iewes? And whether adultery
be not now as great and as detestable a
synne before God, and al godly men, as
it was then? Is not adultery nowe as
greate a corrupcyon, iniurye, sclaunder,
and hurte to Christes churche and to all
comō wealthes, as it was in tymes past
                  •
               
And to be short. Whether it raigneth not
growe, rote, sprede, and take place euery
where as rankly vnshamefacedly, and
as comonly nowe as euer it dyd, syth
there is no punyshement ministred for
it, neither of the ecclesiastick nor secular
sorte? Forasmuch thē as al this is trueth

greuouse offence, God as he hathe done
in tymes past, punyshe bothe the realmes,
and the heade rulers wyth all the

chaunced vpon this boke, so entytled:
That Adulteres should not be punished,

                  •
               iuill ordinaunces, naturall and writen
lawes, me thought it was an vngodlye
and an euilll counsell, whiche is euer
worst of all to the counseller him selfe
And therfore 
                  •
               beinge the iust desyers of
many, I addressed me to geue a contrary
counsell. For neuer was there any time
ne nacion more corrupte with this crime
of adultery, then suche, as vnder the
color of the Gospell, where no punishement
is ordined, ru
                  •
               ne into the licenciouse
liberty of the flesh, chaste matrimony
contempned. Insomuche that as we
may coniecture by the scriptures, it pro
               
                  •
               ostiketh
the world to drawe faste to an
ende, and prouoketh the hasty wrath of
God sodenly to destroye all, and to come
to iudgement. And therfore I se it to
be more godly counsel, to punish iustely
this great cryme so wyde spred into so
greate hurt aud corrupcuion of the churches
and comon wealthe. Right heauye
maye euery Christen hert be to se synne
and wickednes take suche strength and

courage in a Christen realme, that any
man vnder any pretence of holines and
charite shoulde stande forthe to defende
the cause of so notable sinners vnpunished.
To whome this patrone of Adulterers
geueth his sinfull counsell, I can
not tell, he is so sliper a serpent of so variable
colors of contradicions, correccions
I woulde saye, nowe counsellinge
the preachers, and then dissuadinge
the Discipels of Christe, and

                  •
               naue aduertisinge the Magistrates,
nowe to haue them punished, and then
to haue them not punished
                  •
                nowe with
the worde, and then with the swearde.
To geue this counsell to auye priuate
man or preacher, he spendeth his penne
in vayne. For no priuate persone vsurpeth
the office of a publique Magistrate
in punishinge this open cryme wyth
deathe. And yet I herde of a man in
this realme, whiche takinge the man
with his wyfe, slewe him. Whome the
lawe coulde not punishe for so doinge.Nume .xx

Prieste

                the Israelite, and the
Madianite woman bothe thorowe with
his speare, as they laye. And God

allowed it for a iust dede, that pacifyed
his wrath. So hainously hateth God the
synne. Yf thys wryter be so malepert,
as to geue his counsel to the kinges maiestie,
and to his counsell, he condempneth
hym selfe two maner wyse by hys
owne wordes, ones he taketh the autotorite
oute of their handes to punyshe
them wyth deathe, callynge it the cruell
seueryte of Moses lawe nowe abrogated,
and maye no more be put in vre.
Another is thys: He sayth: That yf the
tranquyllite of the comon wealth requireth
deathe for the offence, and the magistrates
make the lawe, he sayth not agaynst
it. But yet he constantly affyrmeth
it, that law to be neither profitable
nor necessarye. Wherof it foloweth him
to consent to a lawe neyther necessarye,
nor profytable. But I argewe thus:
What so euer lawe perteyneth to the
publique tranquillite of Christes church
and conseruacion of the comon wealth,
the same is bothe profitable aud necessarye.
But Goddes sawe is to punyshe
adultery with deathe for the tranquillite
and comon wealth of his church: wherfore
hys lawe is bothe necessarye, and

profytable. But here this man wyl deny
the minor, and saye that lawe was geuen,
but to the Iewes, and is nowe abrogated.
But hys sayinge is false: for
this lawe of punishement wyth death is
the lawe of nature, whereof the ten preceptes
are grounded, and can not be abrogated.
Neyther is there any lawe abrogated,
whyche beareth in it selfe the honoure
of God, & the loue to oure neighbour:
but to punish adultery wyth death
pertayneth to Goddes honoure in hys
worde to be obeyed and obserued for the
loue of oure neyghboures, whiche els
shoulde suffer intollerabler iniuries,
then to haue all hys goodes taken from
hym: wherfore it ought to be more punished
then theft. Is not a mans wyfe, or
husbande, or doughter, or seruaunt morderer
to them, then their temporal goods
as horse, kowe, &c? God is the God of
the Gentiles, and tendereth the preseruacyon
& tranquilite of our comon wealth
and churche, as greatlye as he dyd the
Iewes. Wherfore the lawes of hys honoure,
of oure sayth, and mutuall loue
must be geuen to us, as well as to them.
To take awaye, and to cut of putryfyed

and corrupte membres from the whole
body, lest they poyson and destroye the
body, is the lawe of loue to the whole body
to be preserued: wherfore euery lawe
that beareth this loue in it selfe, is the euerlasting
wil of god, made by the same
spirit, which is one & the same of both
y• testamentes, & must nedes stand ferme
& inuiolable, according to his owne sayinge
by his Prophet:Psal .xviij. 
                     •

                  xviij. Lorde thy iudgemētes
are egall ferme, fast and iust. And
all thy iudgemētes shal endure for euer.
Wherfore it is playne that they are not
abrogated, as this yong and newe orator
woulde perswade. Saint Paul beholding
the morals & iudicials of God, affirmeth
cōstantly them to be both perfit
& profitable .ij. Timo .iij. bothe to teache
to reproue vice, to correcte synne & to instruct
mā. Now for asmuch as the iudgments
of God be so profitable so perfit &
so necessarye, what man dare be so bolde
ether to abrogat, to alter, to minish, or to
swade y• Magistrates not to execute thē
               
                  •
               
so far of shuld they be to write & to affirme
them to be neither profitable nor necessary,
but to be cruell blody banished

Supposed alwayes that the Christen
Magistrates and Godlye preachers

charytie and lenite, would I haue called
into counsel, for thys iust punyshement,
whiche is so cleare eyed, that she can se
what thyng she may do by Gods word,
and when she may obtayne her purpose,

Thys charyte therfore (I say) do we enbrace,

Wherfore yf I had not sene this greuouse
offence so frequented with oute al
punishement & shame and feare of God,
and this wryter so farre to haue erred in

winked at his fonde zele and blynde charite.
Albe it, his blynde loue to him selfe
in pleasinge him selfe hath openly for a
shewe of his latyne tongue and greke set
forthe his boke more to exercise his stile,

boke sith it is put forthe to sustayne the

professor and minister of the word
to be the same to the churche, as is the
goode Magistrat, and citesen to the
citye, whiche as they will suffer nothinge
to growe that maye destroye the
cite and comon welth, euen so should the
professor suffer no vyce, ne false doctrine
nor synner vnpunished in the churche:
wherby the congregacion is corrupted,
and greuously sclaundered, and turned
from the feare of God, who be feared &
praysed for euer. Amen.
            But let vs hear, what this writer saith.
Into the reproche and rebukes of them,
whō he iudgeth not to approue his boke
and title therof: he sayth thus: But I
meruel at this vngodlines (shall I cal it)
or rather a loue to them selues, whyche
are wont so greately to abhorre thē that
are slyden into vices, as though their selues
were Goddes vpon the earth, or vtterly
clere from the same spots. Lo. Adultery
is with this man but a litle spotte,
a moot, a litle sliding amisse in this mās
eye. For what synne els is it, yt he in his
boke defendeth? who ther els 
                  •
               end al his
arguments then into this ende, that Adulterers
shoulde not be punished, accordinge

to his his first title an argumentes
of the whole boke? Beholde also how
spyghtfully he depraueth good men for
abhorringe adultery, and would haue it
iustely punished. Neyther is therre now
almost any man, their maners are so corrupte,
but he will tell forth other menis
offences to shewe them selues therby the
more pure and honest.
            
            Here may ye se, of what spirite the man
is caried into the rebukes an fole hardy
iudgement, reprehending and deprauing
other godlye ministers, whiche in pulpits
dampne and abhorre these open obstinate
Adulterers, exhortinge the Magistrates
to punishe it by Gods lawes.

            Here it would be asked this great learned
oratore, whether his Adulterers syn not
of wyl, but against their willes, only
of nature? There is no actual syn, but it
is vnluntary. Adultery is actuall, wherfore
it is a voluntary synne. This were
els in dede a good defence for hys Adulterers
to saye, their synne is so natuaall,
that it is against their willes, and so not
worthy punishment. At last to mitigate
their synne he sayth: Yf one committe a

these men take on?
            
            Suerly yf Adulterers had no beter patrone
then this poete to extenuate, and
defende their cause, they are like to suffer
perpetuall hell tormentes, yf they repent
not in time, albe it they here escape the

But they are suche as be so maried to
their owne lustes, that they obeye them

into their owne fleshely desyers, yea
it taketh dayly suche rote and custome,
that as in other countries dronknes is rekened
for a vertue, so is adultery nowe
comonly but a praysed laughter, & hathe
done one the name of prayse and vertue

excuse is nowe inuented. That they

after the diuorsement may marye another,
or what shall the giltie or vngiltie

willeth not the deathe of synners,
               
knowing not of what death God there
speketh. Neyther wyl we, ne any christē
Magistrate the perpetuall death of dāpnacion

amende and be conuerted, but yet do not
this wyshe and wyll take awaye the iust
iudgementes of God, and punishement
of anye murtherer, thefe or Adulterer.
God there speaketh of the deathe of the
soule and not of the body. Neyther willeth
God by the text of Ezechiel his iudicial
lawes to be abrogated, as this man
meaneth, or els wherfore alledgeth he
this texte agaynste the professors of the
worde, that they should not iustigate the
Magistrates to punish Adulterers? Thē
he maketh this reason.
            
               It is not reade (saith he) that Christe or
any of his apostles bode or cōmaunded
any adulterer to be punished with death
ergo:
            
            So is it not read, that Christ commaunded
the two theues to be hanged yt dyed
with him: and yet did they instely suffer
for their offences according tu Gods lawes,
Christ not sayinge agaynst it. By
this sayd reason a negatiuis, this man
would haue noman for his crime to suffer

deathe. For where is it reade, that
Christ bode this particlare thefe, or that
murtherer by name to suffer death? But
tell me (I praye you) sayd not Christ: I
am not come to breake the lawe, but to
fulfill it? Christ consequently approued
and confirmed the iudicial lawes saing:
Whoso killeth, is bounde gilty the iudgment.
Whiche he declared, sayinge: who
so smiteth with the swerde, shal die with
the swerde. And what law was it, wherof
Paul saith:
                  
                     〈◊〉

                It is not ordined for the
iust man, but for the vniust, as for rebellers
to the Magistrates to parents, for
murtherers, for adulterers, &c? Yf the
payne and lawe made for adultery were
abrogated, Paul woulde not haue confirmed
it, as he did with those wordes
yet lefte in his pistle, neyther woulde he
haue so threatened and feared the Corinthes,
sayinge: Se that ye defyle not your
selues wyth adultery, as certayne men

slayne an hūdreth and twenty thousand.

            And what els desyer we then, that Adulterers
might be punished accordinge to

Where was youre Leuite, when Eias

Now yf Christ hath abolished the
punishment for Adulterers, and expressed
and decreed an easier, ye must shewe
the place, and then we must beleue you
or els we must stand to the eternal will
of God, remitting you to the first original
lawe and ordinaunce of God. We

            For iudgementes & punishmentes are

heady rashe iudgementes, as touchinge
the punishmentes of indurate, desperate
Adulterers with deathe, callinge it rash
and heady, sayinge we haue no aperte
scriptures, to punishe them.
            
            Lo, here is it playne, he would haue thē
synne vnpunished, beinge ignorant of ye
scriptures, whiche commanndeth them
to be stonned to deathe. Where is it
manifest that he belyeth the scriptures &
Gods lawes, whyche Christ came to cō
               firme
bothe wyth mouth and miracles.
And Paul affirmeth the Magistrates
therfore to beare the swearde to execute
the lawes ordined for Adulterers. And
then to declare his highe conninge, he
sayth:
            
               I knowe with how great cruelty adultery
was punished by Moses in the old
lawe.

               o this man is not ashamed ne afraydé
to call the iust pacient merciful Lorde, &
his lawes cruell. Beware leste ye be so
serued of the same iudge, as was that
vuprofitable seruaunt, which for so esteininge
his mayster was worthely boūd
hande and fote, aud cast into extreme
dar
                  •
               knes. God is no chaungelinge, his
wyll, word and iudgements stand ferme
and fast for euer.
            
               But wherfore do we cal it olde, but because
there is now comen a newer lawe
to the whiche the former must geue
place.
            
            This newe lawe to the which Goddes
lawe must geue place, ye must vnderstād
it to be this newe counsellers newe law
where with Adulterers must be newely
punished, that is to say, to haue thre flappes
with a fox tayle for breakinge holye
wedlocke, orels it is as yet no lawe at
al. For it is yet but vnder his consultacion,
which yf it be deathe, it shalbe by
this man nether profitable nor necessary
ergo it is an naughty and wicked lawe.
Thus ye se his fonde presumpcion to
make Gods lawe to geue place to hys
newe lawe, whiche is yet to be made, so

that in the meane ceason they may cōmit
adultery frely vnpunished. But yf the
olde lawe concerninge the punishement,
for breakinge Goddes commaundementes
had bene abrogated, as this wryter
falsely sayth. Christ woulde neuer haue
so oft alledged it agaynst the Pharisais
for the defence and confirmacion of his
doctrine and dedes. He tolde them constantly:
That God commaunded it, that
whoso curseth father or mother shoulde
die. Yf this had bene abrogated by Christes
coming, christ would not haue alledged
it for his purpose. Wherfore that
same iudiciall lawe stode in strength after
his coming, as the other lyke lawes
iudicial do, as honor thy father and mother.
But this man sayth: It was sayde
to the Iewes and not to vs: whiche yf it
were true, so were we not bounde to honor
parents, ne Magi

               Or els (sayth he) yf nothinge be changed,
wherfore are there two testaments?
wherfore hath not the former continued
stil, yf there be nothing in it, which must
be abrogated and abolished?
            
            This man should haue learned of Paul

what thinges and lawes be abrogated,
and whiche partes yet stande in effecte,
and wherfore they were abrogated as he
writeth Hebr .vij. That is, euen for their
weakenes, inutilite and imperfeccion
there declared at length. But the morall
and iudicial lawes did bere in them no
imperfeccion, no weakenes nor inutilite,
but the honor of God and conseruacion
of his comon weal by loue mutual, wherfore
they are not abrogated, as this man
blasphemeth. Yf he had considered the
circumstance and processe of Paul in yt

this Christen realme, whiche professeth

testamentum signifieth the couenaunte
whiche God of his mercie and goodnes
to our fathers and vs hath smiten, and
that there was no nother couenāt of our
saluacion, iustificacion by fayth and redempcion
made with vs, then was made
with Adam, Nohe, Abraham, &c. They
had Christ in figures and shadowes promised
them, lokinge for him in hope as
we haue him in present fayth past. So
that in substaunce the olde and newe couenant
is al one. As the two Cher

There shal not one iot ne title passouer,
til al be fulfilled. And soner shal heauen
and earth perysh, then this lawe or couenaunt
be anulled. There is therfore but
one couenaunt or testament in substance
and two in the maner of deliueraunce of
the same. For to oure fathers was it geuē
to worship one God in spirit, in faith
in innocencie of liuinge, they had one
rightwismakinge and one redempcion,
and did se with vs in faith and hope one

sacrifice Iesus Christ. But because the
maner of the delyueraunce varied as touchinge
the tyme, persons and the figures
of the verite, therfore in two diuerse respectes
one thing hath two accidentary
names, which thinge Paul considering
sayth: Al things happened to them in figures,
but not so vnto vs, for we haue
him in verite. They reioysed in externe, &
we in spiritual thinges. Wherfore that
geuinge of the lawe, wherby the religiō
was then set forth by figures and ceremonies
to the olde fathers, is nowe called
the old testament. But that religion
wherby Christ, whiche hath fulfilled all
thinges in the lawe and prophetes nowe
beynge only al in al thinges is deliuered
and geuen vs in very dede withoute all
figures, is now called the new testamēt.
Not therfore because the fathers had not
then Christ, the grace of the Gospel and
remission of their synnes, but because in
comparison of the olde, and for that the

And this muche be sayde for the difference
of the olde and newe testamente,
for the names therof and abrogacion of

the ceremoniall lawes. Which this writer
knoweth not, and therfore thus erreth
in the abrogacion of the lawes and especially
agaynst that godlye homilie sette

               He reprehendeth the scole diuinite for
deuidinge the lawe into .iij. partes, ceremonies,
iudgementes and morall preceptes.
            
            But he is deceiued, for that distincciō
was made of the most aunceet doctors,
or any scole diuinite was knowne, yf he
had redde them. And yf he had rede the
Bible orderly, he shoulde haue founde in
the olde testament, and in the newe, that

the commaunded decrees. For what contencion,
circumcision made berwixt the
Iewes and Gentyles, and howe it is abrogated
by the decree of the apostles, ye
se in Act .xv. And as for the place this

and therfore they were the morall lawes
(sayth he) whiche he abrogated, & wherof
Paul speaketh.

For in the ceremonies of the Iewes,
sayth Austen, there was rather the confession

of their synnes thē the expiacion.
In that their sacrifices and ablucions
did bewraye them to be impure, when
they woulde be sene most purest, & were

And therfore Paul calleth those ceremonies

them selues their owne dampnacion &

peruerse deuillishenes and deuillish peruersite
of the spirit, wherw• this secte is
caried, whiche when in peruertinge the
scriptures, it can not proue his erroures,
then to falsify the almighty word of god
it addeth to, his own poison, where god
cōmandeth nothing to be added ne taken
frō his word, here he putteth to y• iudicial
lawes, and thrusteth them into Paules
pure texte, and to the hande wrytinge,
sayinge:
            
               Verum iudicia & chirographum.
Loke beter of your boke both greke and
latyne, and tel vs where ye find Iudicia
in that place coupled wt Chirographum?
as I heard your preacher, be like at your
request, I will not name him, openlye

preache it, that the ceremonials and iudicials
are bothe abrogated. Addinge
that the copulaty

the partes be a lyke true. Whiche doctryne
he nor you were able to defende,
when it was afterwarde reasoned at the
table, ye wote where. And here this man
noteth in the mergen of his boke, all the
whole lawes vniuersall of Moses bothe
ceremonial, iudicial and moral to be abrogated,
whiche he resy howe detestable
it is, al men see it, for then should we be
al law les with his Adulterers to synne
in all kynde of synne vnpunished. There
is no heathen miscreaunt, whyche naturally

dirst say or write the ten commaundemē
               tes
of God and the dewe punishmēt ordined
of God for breakinge them, were
abrogated and blotted oute neuer to be
obserued. Nomeruel this man woulde
set Adulterers at liberty in so licenciouse
a state. God geaunte it that he syn
                  •
               e not
but of ignoraunce and simplicite, & not
of a set maliciouse minde incensed of other
agaynst me, whyche haue standen

against him in this cause, before he wrote
his boke ad
                  •
               ertisinge and counsellinge
him to ceasse from his erroure, whiche
nothwithstandinge yet did he put forthe
this boke openlye
                  •
                whose title he hathe
changed, but not the boke nothinge agreable
to the newe title, 
                  •
               e to the things
prefixed. Then he asketh this question:
            
               Yf Adulterers shoulde be punished accordinge
to Gods lawe in Moses boke,
why did not Christ commaunde the opē
Adulteres to be stoned?
            
            Here he declareth his minde playnely,
that ad
                  •
               lterers ought not to be punished
because Christ remitted the Adulteres.
Howe soeuer this man wil nowe seke &
hunte for euasions to glose and pot oute
his boke sayinge, that he ment the vse
of the lawe or of the malediccion therof
to be abrogated, yet as it is playne, neyther
the iust vse execucion nor the malediccion
is abrogated and abolished frō
the Adulterers, but from the iustifyed by
fayth in an innocent lyfe, so do this, and
al his other argumentes tende into thys
scope and ende, that Adulterers oughte
not to be punished, nether by deathe, nor
by any other payne. For this is his argument:

Christ punished not the Adulteres,
but absolued her, and his example
ought to be folowed of euery Christian,
ergo no man oughte to punishe Adulterers,
but let them go quiete, absolued, vnpunished.
But I answere this man in
fewe wordes, as I answered him th
                  •
               n,
and also other which did set him vp to cō
               uicte
me in this argument and other, yf
they had coulde at that tyme. Because
his father sent him then to saue synners
and not to geue sentence of deathe as a
iudge, he came then himself to be iudged
and to be killed and not to slaye in iudggement,
he woulde not then take vpon
him the office of a seculare Magistrate,
but refused to diuyde the heretage, and
then, when they woulde haue made him
a kynge he came to constitute a spirituall
kyngedome, wherin he raygneth by
his worde for euer. This man shoulde
haue considered who they were, that
brought the Adulteresse to him, and for
what entent, not to haue Moses law iustely
executed, but to trap Christ. Wher
he then taughte all iudges and accusers
of other, to be pure in them selues, leste
in accusinge and condempni
                  •
               ge other

they accuse and condempne them selues.
Also this learned man must learne, that
yf Christ had condempned her there standing
alone without sufficiēt wytnes, he
had broken his father lawe, whyche he
came to fulfill. And then had the Phariseis
and Scribes the thinge they hunted
fore. To this he bringeth in saint Paul,
excōmunicating the incestuose Corinth.
I answere lykewyse (as I did then by
mouthe) Paule was no seculare Magistrate,
he was a priuate preacher, hauing
power to edifye and not to destroy with
deathe him, whome he knewe to repent
and to be conuerted to the churche
by suche delyueringe to Satan. And therfore
hauinge the ecclesiastik kayes, and
censure did he binde and lose him, as
Christ commaunded. But howe formidable
is and was that censure to that mā
it appereth .ij. Corinth .vij. and I haue
sayd it before. Neyther was there then in
that cyty anye seculare Christen Magistrate
as ye se it .i. Cor .vi. to execute the
lawe vpon suche offenders. Neyther is
it a good argument, Christ nor Paule
iudged none to deathe, ergo Adulterers
& murtherers ought not to be punished,

with deathe. Nether is it a iust argumēt
Magistrates neglecte their office in iustely
punishinge malefactors, ergo theues,
murtherers and Adulterers maye
synne vnpunished. Then this man bringeth
another argument to proue Adulterers
not to be punished oute of the .vij.
Chap. to the RO. thus:
            
               Yf we be maryed to the new and secōd
housbande Christ, then are we out of bō
                  dage
and crueltye of the former housbād
whiche is synne, &c.
            
            Yf he take & putte his adulterers in the
nomber of these newe maried to Christe
(or els the argument maketh nothing for
his purpose) so maketh he a godly mariage
to marye his Adulterers to Christe,
takinge the members of an herlet to couple
them to Christ. But it rather thus foloweth.
Adulterers haue forsaken Christ
and haue maried thē selues to their flesh
and to the deuyll, and therfore shal God
iustely destroye them. For that they are
vnder the curse and punishement of the
lawe iudiciall .i. Tim .i. Tell vs, are your
Adulterers vnder the lawe, that is maryed
to synne not yet knowne to them
by the lawe, or vnder grace, that is in

Goddes fauour iustified? Before ye said
the whole vniuersall lawe was abrogated,
and so to be no lawe, lefte to punishe
them: wherfore they must be now after
you (as ye here woulde proue it) vnder
grace, vnder a godly grace haue ye put
them: euen vnder a lawles lycenciouse
libertye to synne vnpunished, maryed to
Christ, saye you: God is highly beholdē
to suche a mariage maker, and so are all
Adulterers, so to couple them to Christe
their spouse. Yf they be not vnder ye law
so is theyr olde housbande, the lawe and
synne knowne by it, deade from them, &
they delyuered from this their former,
olde wyfe maryed to Christ: whyche yf
it be so, thē are they no more Adulterers.
Paul sayth with many expresse wordes
that he (whose former wyfe is thus dead
and he losed by her deathe, maryed to
Christ the newe man) is suche one as is
dead from synne, regeuered into Christes
death by a newe byrthe, buryed and
rysen with Christ into a new lyfe, whose
olde man is by repentaunce & perpetual
mortificacion crucified with Christ, absolued
from synne, in whome no synne
reygneth 
                  •
               e dwelleth. To these men thorowe

fayth, and loue and innocency of
lyuing, is the cruell exaccion, execracion,
malediccion and dampnacion of the
lawe abrogated, and not to your Adulterers.
For they do that as the lawe commaundeth
not for feare of the lawe, but
of a redy courage and of a faythfull hert
and mynde, for they are maried to Christ
in deade. But Adultrrers are maried to
synne, and therfore are they vnder the
lawe to be punished therby. Where ye
se your own text returned into your own
confusion. For ye knowe not, what it is
to be vnder the lawe, ne what is the law
in this place, 
                  •
               e who be vnder it, nor
howe we are delyuered from it, and maried
to Christ, nor howe many kindes of
liberty there are, neyther vnderstande ye
Pauls mynde in these .vi. vij. and .viij.
Chapter to the Rom. And yet ye take
in hand to treat of the difference betwixt
the lawe and the Gospell, shewinge nothinge
lesse in youre boke, openinge a perelouse
dore to Adulterers to sinne vnpunished,
putting them not vnder the law.
            
               Who is so ignorant in the scriptures,
that knoweth not Moses lawes to be geuen,
but for a time, and but to the Iewes

Euen your selfe so ignorant, which knoweth
not the onely ceremonial lawes to
be geuen but for a time to thē. And the lawes
Iudiciall and moral, whiche contayne
in them Goddes worshippe oure
fayth and loue, to be the perpetual will
of God geuen to al naciōs. And that the
transgression of the same lawes must be
punished according to the grauite of the
synne. Shew vs, where Christ tempered
or minished in any wordes of his the punishment
for blasyhemers, false prophetes
for murtherers and Adulterers, and
woulde the Magistrates to not punishe
them with death? bringe forth your scriptures.
For we know that he hath geuen
the rulers the swerde,Roma .xiij. and that not in
vayne. The law of God abrogateth not
the lawes of nature but confirmeth thē,
but the lawe of nature punished adultery
with deathe, as it is before shewed, or
els why is the punishment of adulterye
more abrogated then the punishemente
for theft a
                  •
               d murther? are they not all a
lyke preceptes? Thou shalt not kill, nor

                  •
               tele, nor committe adultery? Adulterye
was thought once of God to be as greuouse
a sinne as was blasyhemy, false

doctryne, witchcraft, enchauntings, sinitinge
and killinge of father and mother,
and therfore was punished a lyke. And
is adultery now no synne or a lesse sinne
then it was in Moses tyme? Then he
sayth:
            
               What is more true and i
                     •
                  ste
                     •

lawe of God, whiche procedeth of it self,
righteous
                     •
                  es? And though god punished
it sharpely, yet may it not be sayde he did
it vniustly.
            
            Yf Goddes lawe procedeth out of righteousnes,
and his righteousnes endureth
for euer: why then wyl ye abrogate hys
euerlastinge rightwyse wyl and lawe to
punishe adultery? will ye exalt your selfe
aboue God and his righteous
                  •
               es? Sinne
is now as odiole to God, as euer it was
and with greuoser plages are they worthy
to be punished, whiche knowe no we
his wyl, & wil not obey it. Suerly all the
rethryke ye haue, can not defende youre
Adulterers from the iuste punishment wt
deathe, but to folis and to men corrupte
with the same filthy scabbe, perchaunce
your boke may seme somwhat plausible
and pleasaunt. In some places ye wonl
                  •
               
seme to haue them punished, but not wt 
               
death, and in some vnpunished, for that
ye set them not vnder the lawe, and the
lawe to be abrogated, and the sinne to be
healed by Gods worde with softenes,

maried to Christ. So that your colours
of corrected contradicions and contrary
correccions fyght greately emonge thē
selues, yf the state of your cause & scope
of youre argumentes be diligently obserued.
Then thus ye saye:
            
               Christ abolisheth not the former lawes
as vniuste, but with le

            But what and yf Goddes lawe can neyther
rule nor bynde, nor with prickynge
nor kyllinge bringe and pluck men from
their open adultery theft and murther?
What wyll ye then do with youre softe
leuite and pity to youre adulterose Christians,
as ye call them? Here ye argue cō
               trary
to your instituciō of the vse of the
lawe concerninge iuste men and Christians
for whom the lawe iudiciall is not
ordined (as Paul sayth) as thoughe the
lawe had the sawe vse, strength and effect
vpon iust and vniust, wysely.
            Then he bringeth in the example of the
brason serpent cōpared to Christ, which
(the price payd for synne) shoulde put ye
law out of strength & effect for malefactors
saying: No nother wyse the serpēts
styng taken away, the serpent abydeth,

may hisse but to stinge he can not.
            
            Lo, the lawe may hisse at his Adulterers
that is, geue them a flap with a foxtaile,
and hurte them not. He woulde the iuste
lawes of God to lese their strengthe by
Christes cominge (whiche came to fulfyll
them, and not to breake them) that
they shoulde not condempne Adulterers
wherof Paul sayth, the letter, that is, the
lawe slayth. But he sayth, the lawe now
ruleth: whome? Euen them that will not
be ruled, and not to bynde them to their
owne wiues. What a regimēt and bond
of the lawe this man dremeth, I can not
tel. Paul sayth out of Osee: That nether
the stinge of death, whiche is synne, nor
the strength and power of the sin, which
is the lawe, shal not be taken away, tyll
Christ hath put al his enimies vnder his
fete, and delyuered vp his kingedome to
his father. But be lyke this man imagineth
suche an holy churche in this world
as shalbe after domes daye: when all
rightwisnes onlye shal dwell upon the
earthe .ij. Pet .iij. But ye shall knowe,
when Christ came, he payd the price for
al penitent synners, and true beleuers yt
receyued the benefite of their redempciō
               
and not for comon Adulterers that will
not receyue Christ and his lawes. For
Christ is no gift to them, that wil not receyue
him. Christes bloude is no suche a
gift to them that thrust it from them by
infidelite, trede it vnder their fete, contempne
so rich a redempcion. Of which
sorte are they, that thincke adultery to be
no synne, ne punishe worthy, but withoute
all feare of God and man persiste
in their filthy lyuinge. Christ expowned
that similitude of the brason serpent far
otherwyse, then this man wresteth it for
Adulterers. He applyed it to ye beleuers
in him, sayinge: As Moses exalted the
serpent in the wyldernes, so must the
sonne of man be lifted vp on the crosse,
that al that beleue in him peryshe not: he
sayth not, that Adulterers (whose lyfe
sheweth them not to beleue in Christ) perish
not, nor yet to not be deliuered frō yt
iuste punishment of the lawe. For they
that loked not vp to the serpēt Christ by
fayth, hanginge vpon the crosse, dyed of
the serpents stinginge. Neyther is the
stinge of the lawe plukt out of them that
loked not vp to the brasen serpent. And
therfore ye are but a peruerter of Christes

wordes. Then in alledginge Austen
ye condempne your selfe. For he speketh
there playnely of the heauye multitude &
burden of ceremoniall lawes, and not
of the iudicial and moral lawes. And thē
to vse youre colour of correccion or rather
contradiccion, ye saye:
            
               Here I wyll not play the patrone of carnal
lycence to cause men to synne vnpunished,
which wil not repent.
            
            When ye contende to proue and defende
nothinge more.
            
               Neyther do ye twyche (ye saye) the publyk
ordinary lawes, &c.
            
            When ye do al that ye maye to destroye
them. Yf ye take awaye the iudicial and
moral lawes, as ye abolish them altogether.
For he that taketh awaye all lawes
of God, wherof all lawes and Magistrates
be grounded, taketh awaye the
Magistrates and the ministers of the
lawes.
            
               But ye condempne (ye saye) this importunite

whet the ciuill lawes beyonde all neces

But is it not euery Christen manis profession,
so to loue the glory of God, the
healthe, peace, integrite and tranquilite
of the Christen churches, cities and realmes,
and so to promoue suche open iniuries

                  •
               launderers
of Christes congregacion may be cut of
and punished according to Gods word?
Then he sayth:
            
               It is the part and dutie of the professors
of the worde, to preache the forgeuenes
in the Gospel and to inuite the people to
repentaunce, to lead the weake with the
spirite of softenes, and the hardnecked
obstinat, impenitent, inflexible to leade
them from their synnes, and not from
their lyues.
            
            And is it not the parte of a preacher first
to preache thē the law to shewe thē their
synnes, ere they preache them the Gospell
of forgeuenes? men muste knowe
and acknowledge their synnes with repentaunce,
er they be forgeuē. But what

and youre Adulterers will neyther hear
lawe nor Gospell, nor any repentaunce
preached, but wilbe soner led from their
lyues, then from their synnes? muste not

                  •
               t of with the swerde, aud that by
Goddes worde? And wyl not you haue
vs to preache, and to teache this lawe of
God? Ioan and Christ began at the law
to preache the Gospel. Wherfore els do
the Magistrates beare the swerde, but

                  •
               h to correcte and cut of them,
whom Goddes worde can not refrayne
from their open wikednes? God first to
represse oure affectes, commaundeth vs
not to lust, ne to desyer, or to haue anye
concupiscence of any other thinge, then
oure owne. Whiche barre, yf it can not
holde vs yet he setteth before vs another
barre to brydle vs from the acte saying:
Thou shalt not commit adultery, nor
steall, nor kyl, &c. And yf this barre wil
not hold vs, then hath he constituted the
Magistrates wyth his lawes to punish
the transgressors with death, whiche is
the last remedy to destroye the offender.
But yf we could kepe the first and most
perfit lawe, so neded we not the seconde,

nor the third. But when God did foresee
that nether the first nor the second barre
coulde brydle such prefracte Adulterers
and murtherers from the externe acte,
but that they woulde brydelles runne
into the opē dead vnto the great destruccion
of the comen wealth and intolerable
corrupcion of the Christen societe, thē
he added the thirde and last remedy both
holsom, profitable and necessary, & not so
rigorose ne cruell, as this man wryteth.
Yf it be lawful for the Magistrates to
e
                  •
               ecute death vpon them, why is it not
as lawful for the preacher to exhorte thē
to their lawful office, yf they neglecte it?
God commaundeth vs not to be angrye
which natural sore and vice in vs to heal
it, and that it shoulde not breake forthe
into the hurt of my neyghboure. He commaundeth
vs not to kyll, whiche yoke
yf we cast of, and slaye the man, then is
there the thirde degre present, euen the
slayer to be slayne And this is the thirde
part and last degre of the lawe so adioyued
and annexed in the seconde that the
one can not be abrogated without the other.
And therfore to be sure, this man
abrogateth the whole law for his Adulterers

sake. Yf ye suffer all adulterers and
malefactors to syn, tyll they be all slayn
wyth the swerde of this new broched spirit,
Englād is lyke to s

               ut so
violently resist it, that they will turne the
poynt therof into the bellies of the true
teacher? Truly your spirit is al to weak
to enter, where Christes spirit taketh
no place. Christe commaundeth not to
geue so holye thinges to dogges, nor to
cast perels before swyne. But you wyll
haue your incurable Adulterers not by
feare of death to be brought to continencie
but by the worde, whiche they wyll
neyther heare, ne beleue, but thrust it frō
them.
            
               The original vice and sore of adultery
(sayth he) lyeth depe in our concupiscēce
whiche must be first cured.
            
            I praye you in whiche of all the moste
perfitest, iustified was the original concupiscence
so cured, that he nether lusted

wherof ye know what foloweth.
            
               
               But and yf the fleshe be corrupt wyth
concupiscence, the seuerite and crueltie
of the externe lawes shal do nothinge.
Yisse verely, for whome the feare of god
refrayneth not, yet the feare of the lawe
whiche is death, holdeth them from the
externe acte. For what feare, the swerde
borne of the Magistrates smyteth into
malefactors hertes,R

                Paul expresseth with
many terrible sentences, and much more
feare it bringeth, when it is iustely withoute
affeccions and respecte of persones
ministred and truely executed, yea and
that when the inwarde lustes and concupiscence
rage, and is not mortified.
            
               This spiritual sore (meaninge the concupiscence)
sayth he, muste be healed wt 
spirituall medicines, that is with the
worde of God.
            
            Yf this be true, so woulde ye haue no seclare
Magistrates, whiche thinge the
Anabaptistes holde. For what synne is
there, but it cometh oute of the concupiscence
of the spiritual part of man, which
is his soule consenting to synne? Wherof
synne gendred, and death folowinge,
the man is called fleshe, and the synnes
the workes of the fleshe. Now call them

carnal or spirituall sores as ye lyst. Belyke
ye call lechery a spiritual sore, because
the spiritualtie, after they had forsaken
their own wyues and vowed their
chastite, and consyderinge none so lyke
to lyue in adulterye as them selues,
then they deuolued the iudgementes of
this spirituall sore of adultery from the
laite into their owne spirituall courtes,
that one lecherouse stalland might 
                  •
               law
eche others bake. And now was lechery
called nomore a carnall sore, but a spiritual,
to be healed with a spiritual medicyne:
with what thyncke ye? with the
worde of God? No, for they knew it not.
They layd their own syge leaues therto
that is their dayly darck confessions, penances,
satisfaccions, and misses, and as
they dayly synned, so were they daye by
day in healinge and neuer cured. But he
that was foule, was euery daye the filthier,
as Ioan write 
                  •
               hi

this man argueth thus:
            
               That because in many men adultery cā
not be healed, ne Adulterers brought to
repentaunce, ne corrected with the word
therfore yet it may not be punished with
death, but permitted.
               
But ye shoulde haue argued thus. Because
they contempne the medicyne of
the worde, and persist in their wickednes,
therfore ought they to be punished
with the swerde.Luce .xii

him selfe, rendinge oute a pese of the parable
that semeth for him, but the effecte
and scope therof is playne agaynst him,
whiche he leaueth out for feare, and peruerteth
the text, sayinge:
            
               The Lorde forbiddeth the roten tree to
be cut donne.

And in another place Christ not finding
frute in the fyg tre, accursed it, and it withered
deade, neuer more to bryng forth
frute. And what then thyncke ye, is hys
sentence vpon them, that with no mouicions
no teachinge, no dunginge wylbe
fruteful, but wyl despyse his labor and
brynge forthe euyl frutes, seynge, he

commaunded the fruteles trees to be cut
doun? here ye se, how he peruerteth Christes
wordes sayinge: Chiste forbiddeth,
whiche he playnely commaundeth. Thē
he maketh this wyse argument:
            
               Hole men haue no nede of a phisicion,
but they that are sicke, ergo Adulterers
ought not to be punished with death, but
must be healed with Goddes worde.
            
            Suche an argument may he make for al
theues and murtherers, and so noman to
suffer, but be healed with Goddes word
which is not els but to abolish the ciuile
lawes, and al Magistrates. Suche a licenciouse
common weale dreame the Anabaptistes
this day. But and yf the sick
despyse the holsome medicyne, beynge a
purryfyed member, then Ihon Baptiste
and Christ commaunde suche trees to be
cut doune and cast into the fyer.
            
               But here this man calleth suche obstinate,
hardnecked, incurable Adulterers,
but weake brethren, and but sickly persons.
Asking what phisicion ministreth
his diligence to the sycke man to slaye
hym, whose cure he taketh in hande?
            
            And here I aske him agayne: what Phisicion
is to solishe that taketh an incurable

sore in hande? or will heale that sor
                  •
               
otherwyse, or with any other medicyne
then Gods worde prescribeth him: with
what medicyne commaundeth God the
Magistrates to heale murther, adultery
theft, and suche lyke pestilences to the comon
wealthe? Al this manis argumētes
brought for Adulterers tende into the fauoure
of suche that gladly receyue holsom
counsel beinge obedient to the word
whē they are monished of the preachers
do feare God, amende their lyues. And
make nothinge for Adulterers to be not
punished of the Magistrates. He bringeth
in manye exāples of mercy shewed
of Christ to the faythful penitent confessinge
their synnes, which all make nothing
for opē obstinat malefactors. Nether
do those examples take awaye the
ciuil iustice, nor the swerde from the magistrates
to be executed vpon Adulterers
but that the thefe and murtherer and Adulterer
must neuerthelesse suffer death although
he repented him an hundred tymes
 wt him that was hanged by Christ.
And muche iuste execucion was done of
thē in Christes dayes & sences, albeit the
gilty & condempned persone died a repentant

iust mā before God, whose death
Christe nor his apostles letted not as the
priestes do now with bokes and sanctuaries.
And as for the roytose sonne, whō
this man bringeth in for the defence of
Adulterers. He confessed hys synne, wt 
greate repetaunce to his father, or he
receiued him. He spent but his own good
in excesse of meates and drynckes. And
was no open hurt to the comon weal as
are theues, Adulterers, &c. he hurted only
him selfe. And therfore this example
is but racked & wrested for his purpose

asked Christ, how oft he should forgeue:

sinneth dayly priuately one offending another,

paynes of death then woulde Christe to
be executed vpon him, that offende the
whole churche and especially, that man
whose wyfe is kept in adultery. Then he
sayth:
            
               That forebecause Christe bode Peter
suffer the darnel to grow with the wheat
therfore he woulde Adulterers, and all
suche criminose synners to be permitted
vnpunished among the Christen societe.
               
Who seeth not the fonde ignoraunce;
(shall I call it) or the manifest wickednes
of this man? Christ neuer sayde this
to Peter. But the housholder to his seruaunts
expressing no particlare persone,
but this is nt y• mater, The kocle or darnel
is ther hersies & false doctrine sown
by the deuil, which christ would not haue
pluckt vp; where perel is, therwith to be
pluckte vp also the good corne. For yf
paul had ben pluckt vp a pharisei, he had
neuer haue ben the apostle & preacher of
Christ. Wherfore Christe willeth not in
my wise these kocles or darnel of heretiques,
and not of Adulterers and theues,
&c? to be permitted, but heretiques, wher
their vproting is turned into the destruccion
or hurt of the good and of the whole
churche. It behoueth (sayth Paule) hersies
to be amonge you, that they whiche
be proued be knowne amonge you. But
and yf suche men (yf they shoulde continewe)
would be the subuersion of many
good men, and of the whole church, they
must rather be smiten doune with the
swerde and sithe of iustice: nowe loke &
Adulterers corrupt not holy matrimony
other menis wyues doughters, &c.
            
               
               What and Christ shoulde now come
agayne, and wryte in the foreheades of
these men that woulde so earnestly haue
adultery punished their owne filthines
and Adulteries? Or yf he shoulde wyth
Moses cruell extremite stone them to
death, as many as he knoweth gyltie of
this synne, beginninge at these men that
woulde so fayn haue adultery punished.
I meruel yf they shoulde be a lyue.
            
            Yf this be not a blasphemy to call and
attribute cruel extremite to oure God of
all goodnes, mercy and clemency, there
was neuer blasphemy. Is God chāged
from a mercifull father to a cruell lawe
geuer? to so vniust a iudge, that he willeth
nowe not the same synne to be punished
with lyke paines? brynge forthe his
wordes of the change ro abrogacion of
the paynes of Adultery yf ye can? or els
let his lawe stande ferme and fast iuste
in it self, for euer as the holy Ghost teacheth
vs in his Psalmes, and God also
in his bokes of his lawes, iudgementes,
and preceptes. But is this a good argumēt
for the defence of your Adulterers?

the sinne to be punished right greuosly
And the learned preachers in Germany
consent all, that it ought to be punished
with death, as well as murther or
theft. And yet woulde this patrone and
defender of adultery haue such men for
their good zele to chast matrimony, and
for their desper of the iuste execucion of
Goddes lawes openly shamed, and his
open Adulterers to synne vnpunished. I
my self in priuate communicacion, whē

the bolde shameles continuall frequence
of the sinne without al feare and
shame of God & mā, haue sayd my mind
contrary to this man, whishing the Magistrates
to make it death accordinge to
Gods cōmaundement, wherof this mā
answerd that lawe to be geuē to the Iewes,

ceremonials & iudicials al, as he here writeth,
ar abrogated. Whereof I perceiued
afterwarde, y• this man was kindled to
write this his boke partely against my
sentēce & twitcheth me therin, albe it not
by name. But here I tell him agayne,
but nameles: That yf he knoweth anye
suche cryme, whiche he woulde haue
it wryten in my foreheade, let him wryte
it in his nexte answere, and so accuse
me iustelye, yf he canne. And I shalbe
ready at al tymes to come forthe vnto
myue answere before anye iudge. But
wherfore woulde he not haue the same
done to his Adulterers defamed by their
owne fylthye actes. Yf the Magistrates
be negligente and ceasse from their
office, shoulde not the publyke ministers
of the worde exhorte and warne

them of their dutye? They are commaunded
to cry & not to cease to tell euery state
their offences. But litle regardeth this
man the terrible comminacion of God,

shalt dye. And thou (preacher) premonishest
him not telling him it, that he may
be turned from his synne. Surely he shal
perish in his synne, but his blode wyl I
requyre at thy hand. This wryter so wisely
vnderstandeth the scriptures, that
where so euer he findeth, that we be commaunded
to forgeue our brethren aud felow
seruaunts their priuate mutual, quotidian
faultes, these textes he wresteth to
the open crimes cōmitted against y• hole
comonaltie & church, and woulde haue
them so forgeuen, that the ciuil iustice
shoulde lese her strength. We are bound
verely to forgeue our detterstoward our
selues, but the comon dette requyred by
the law, & they worthy to pay it for their
open murther or adultery, I being a priuate
man, can not dispense with it, or els
wherfore are lawes and magistrates ordined?
Yf my forgeuenes should deliuer
the thefe from the galhose. He would not

that adultery, theft & murther be synnes
worthy to be punished with death. The

euery where Moses law, and the
fearful exāples of deth therin to confirm

consented to the deathe of them that offend

the lawe to lede Goddes people to that
degree, where Iosua taketh them at his
hande to brynge them into the promised
lande, whiche figured the gospel. What
nacion,Deuter .iiij. saith God, is there so great, that
hath iudgementes and lawes so ryghteouse,
as are the lawes and iudgementes,
whiche I set before the this daye? Yf
Goddes lawes and iudgementes which
bothe be thus ioyned together thorowt
the repeticion of the whole law, be thus
righteouse, as no nacion els can make or
vse: dare anye Christen man abrogate,
change or abolishe, yea or neglecte these
iudgementes of God? Yf any man dare
do it, he must geue vs in their places, iudgementes
beter more necessary and profitable:
but what are they that geue vs
none at al? Verely suche persones, as
woulde constitute a lawles licenciouse

abrogated any law but he placed a beter

lambe, the eatinge of his laste souper,
wherin his deathe is remembred with
immortall thankes. Now yf the punishmēt
for Adulterers be abrogated, let this
man shew vs what other stronger payn
Christ hath set in stede therof to represse
the synne. The spiritualtie did geue vs
in sted of it a thrise goying in shirt about
the church yarde before the procession to

But & yf the iudicialles be al abrogated

shadowe of Christ?
            
            Whether he taketh Moses here for his
persone, or for his lawe, yet was he not
Christes shadowe. But the ceremoniall
sacrifices were the figures and shadows
of Christe to come. For Christe came to
fulfill the lawe, which non els could do.
And in the office of teachinge and declaring
Gods wil, it is thus writen:Deu .xix. A prophet
out of the middes of thy naciō, euē
out of thy brethren lyke vnto me, sayth
Moses, shall thy Lorde God stere vp,
whome see that ye heare. It was Iosua,
which in name & office figured Christe.
And Moses shadowed the lawe in thys
accion & office of leading. For as Moses
dyed in the desert, & coulde not bring the
people into the promysed lande, so could
not the law bringe vs to perfeccion & to
our promised heretage. But as Iosua after
his death brought the people into that
rest, so did Christ bring his faithfull into
y• eternal rest.The opinion of a certayne secte nowe sprongen vp Thou shalt therfore know

The lawe of Moses is but the cruell letter
that slayth, it is abrogated, it is but a
shadow. It is the spirit that quickeneth.
This mater must therfore be vnderstādē
spiritually. For what els are al that Moses
wrote but y• letter shadows, say they
aud figures, yea & that euen the ten commaundementes
are but shadowes of a
spirituall lawe. Of what spirite, thinke

ye, speke and wryte these sprites? Verely
of the sprite of phrenesy and hypocrysye.
For this sect abrogateth and passeth not
vpon carnal adultery, nor theft, &c. But
al vpon spiritual adultery, theft and spiritual
murther. And wil haue al spiritual
punishment for them. Whose spiritual
paines are so subtile that they hurt not

face is couered, whiche couer or veyle
was a token of bondage. But where as

There there is the verye lybertye. No
man is compelled to beleue. But who so
truly beleueth, the same will willinglye
and redilye estiewe all vnclennes and
embrace Godly purite, and will euen of
feruente loue accompleshe more of the
lawe willingly, then coulde be extorted
of the Iewes for the very feare of punishement.
But returne to this man sayinge

The dedes of the law are the frutes of ye
spirit. I woulde knowe what thing was
fygured by this precept: It is I that am
the Lorde thy God. Thou shalt haue no
strang gods in mi sight? I know but one
of the ten preceptes to be a figure of the
verye true reste and Sabbothe from sin
and from oure owne willes as Isaie expowneth
it. For, the law and Christ haue
contrary operacions, as haue Moses &
the Gospel, wherfore one can not be the
figure of the other. The lawe workethe
wrathe. The Gospel & Christ reconcile
vs to God. That law maketh syn to encrease,
Christ remitteth it. The lawe accuseth

               Moses was a minister & not a mayster
of the churche, and yet prince of all
the Prophetes.
            
            Yf a mayster be a cōmaunder, a teacher
and a ruler, then was Moses a mayster
and chefe gouerner of the church of Israell,
which church was taught & ruled by
the same spirit of fayth and religion in
Christ to come as is ours in Christ past.
He cōmanded the same preceptes which
are now cōmanded to vs by Christ & his
apostles. And yf he taketh a master for y•
               
heade of the churche: so was Moses the
mayster therof. And then he sayth:
            
               Because the disciples of christ saw non
example of Christ to put Adulterers to
deathe, therfore Christes disciples maye
put no man to deathe.
            
            Are not al christen kinges & magistrates
applying thē selues to be taught of christ
and folowinge his doctryne christes disciples?

Christes comon weale and execute Christes
lawes? Then woulde he proue the

               tes
to be abrogated. And why?
            
               Because (sayth he) Christ brake the Iewishe
ceremoniall of the Sabboth daye.
Shoulde we not kepe the other commandementes,
as to haue on strang goddes.
To make vs no image, &c. because christ
abrogated the ceremuniall shadowe and

the externe obseruance of the Sabothe,
taught them, & is the spiritual reste, he
shoulde haue learned, into what respectes
the Sabboth is ceremoniall, & wher
it is morall? And wherfore Christ beinge
the body present woulde cause vs, and
them to ceasse any lenger to beholde the
shadow, and to loke vpō the body being
the Lorde of the Sabboth. For the ceremonial
part, therof was the scole master
vnto the spirituall obseruance thereof.
Then he bringeth in the text Gal. vi. cō
               foundinge

of brethren preuented, with synne
done of weakenes of man, with the open
