                  Tytus. Sophrone Gesyppus.
               
            
         
      
      
         
            
               
                  WHat tyme in Rome reygned Octauyan
               There was a senatour called Fuluius
               whiche had a sone / a noble gentylman
               Of wyt excellēt / whose name was Tytꝰ
               His noble vertues were harde to dyscus
               Fuluius sent hym / forthe to his study
               Unto Athenes / to lerne phylozophy
            
            
               
               This Tytus was put to be soiournynge
               With one Cremes a noble man of fame
               Whiche had a sone goynge to lyke lernynge
               Gesyppus was this noble yonge mannes name
               And for that Tytus sholde go to the same
               He put his sone with hy

                  n company
               To arystip to lerne phylosopy
            
            
               These. ij. yonge men led togyder theyr lyfe
               Eche to other was so fauourable
               That neuer bytwene them was ony stryfe
               That one wolde the other was agreable
               In lernynge they were equiperable
               Thus they contynued by yeres thre
               At theyr lernynge as bretherne they had be
            
            
               At whiche tyme from this worlde dyd passe cremes
               Whose dethe these yonge men toke ryght heuely
               Tytus made lyke sorowe & heuynes
               As if he where his Sone naturally
               Cremes frendes yt were in company
               Knewe not whiche of theym for to cōforte best
               For with lyke sorowe they were bothe opprest
            
            
               But shortly after Cremes obscque
               Gesyppus kynnesmen came incontynent
               Sayenge yf y• he maryed wolde be
               They knewe a wyfe for hym expedyent
               Of beauty & substaunce ryght excellent
               Of athenes borne and come of noble blood
               Whiche vnto hym sholde be propice & good
            
            
               
               Sophrone was the name of this damoysell
               Whiche yf he wolde haue her in maryage
               He sholde haue her y• dothe other excell
               In beauty / wysdome / & eke personage
               And yet she is but xv. yeres of age
               Gesyppus of this report set on fyre
               With glad semblaunt graunted to theyr desyre
            
            
               And on a daye this damoysell to se
               He toke the way vnto her mancyon
               Tytus kepte hym famyliaryte
               And after they had take refeccyon
               Gesyppus to haue cōmunycacyon
               Toke her a parte his mynde for to disclose
               Wherby he myght knowe her wyll & purpose
            
            
               As Tytus sate by & dyd contemplayre
               Her noble beaute with the curius
               Her goodly countenaunce & vysage fayre
               Her membres and wysdome compendius
               Of her he was so hote and amerous
               His blood enchau
                     •
                  ed so yt with grete payne
               From chaungynge colour he coude hym refrayne
            
            
               After Gesyppus had ben there a space
               They toke theyr leue of the damsell foresayd
               And went togydre home vnto theyr place
               Tytus whiche by loue was full sore dysmayd
               Upon his bedde alone hymselfe he layd
               With musynge he called to his remembraunce
               Her noble beauty in eche circumstaunce
            
            
               
               The more he dyd thynke the more was his payne
               After many syghes & besy thought
               Unto hymselfe he gan thus to complayne
               Alas pore wretche wherto am I now brought
               Tytus this lyfe that yu hast chosen is nought
               Where is thy mynde where is thy loue so set
               Where is thy hope thou sholde no wyse forget
            
            
               Alas Tytus thou sholde well consyder
               That she y• thou louest with herte so fre
               Thou sholde her loue as she were thy thy syster
               Cremes kyndnes deserued so to be
               Thou arte also bounden by amyte
               With Gesyppus thou arte confyderate
               Wherfore nowe yu mayst not his honour hate
            
            
               Reason wolde yu sholde thy corage abate
               Refrayne thy selfe from loue so fraudulent
               For thy desyre is full disordynate
               Close thy syght & mynde from this ylle entent
               Knowledge thy selfe thy foly eke repent
               Let reason now thy mynde & herte excyte
               To exchue thyne vnlaufull apetyte
            
            
               Upon some thynge els do now thy mynde set
               With stonde the loue yt doth the so assayle
               Thou hast good cause this loue for to forget
               The dede were shame thy purpose is but frayle
               With honour thou mayst not therwith preuayle
               Loue & kyndnes sholde cause the fle therfro
               If thou consyder what thou ought to do
            
            
               
               Yf thou sholde breke thy loue and amyte
               And to Gesyppus cōmyt so grete shame
               What sholde happen of thyn ennormyte
               Euery man of vntrouth wolde the blame
               Therby thou sholde lese honoure & good name
               And where thou were namyd a frende stedfast
               As false & vntrue yu sholde be outcast
            
            
               But whan her beauty he dyd remember
               From his counsell he dyd this wyse replye
               The lawe of loue of myght is more strenger
               Than ony lawe the trouthe to verifye
               To goddes & mannes it dothe replye
               Amyte is ofte lost by vyolence
               Amonge many to Erre is small offence
            
            
               The father hathe by loue condiscended
               And with his doughter done his fowle pleasure
               Brother with syster eke haue offended
               Whiche is grete offence & displeasure
               Than from his frende his wyfe for to procure
               Wherfore none can one of this dede reproue
               Syth I am compelled by veruent loue
            
            
               My youthe & courage my dede shall excuse
               Loue to this pourpose dothe me sore compell
               This vyrgyn doth my herte suche wyse abuse
               In bewty and wysdome whiche dothe excell
               That loue and reason togyder rebell
               So that to loue her I can not refrayne
               Whome eche man desyreth for to optayne
            
            
               
               But fortune here I hauecause for to ban
               Whiche to my frende Gesyppus hathe her lent
               Rather than vnto some other straunge man
               From hym to take her I can not assent
               From an other I myght conuenyent
               Alas this chaunce dothe encomber me so
               That I can not tell what is best to do
            
            
               In this wyse Tytus wofully dyd playne
               Of his purpose beynge varyable
               That daye nor nyght he coude hymselfe refrayne
               From syghes & wepynge lamentable
               Mete nor slepe was to hym agreable
               He was so lowe brought by this heuynesse
               That from his bedde he coude not hym redresse
            
            
               Gesyppus whiche sawe hym so impotent
               The sodayn chaunce he gretely dyd bewayle
               And from his frende Tytus he seldome went
               But often asked of hym in counsayle
               What thynge myght best for his soro we preuayle
               And where the sykenes dyd his body greue
               Promysynge hym he wolde his payne releue
            
            
               Tytus made vnto hym fayned excuse
               Not she wynge hym the cause of his greuaunce
               But Gesyppus his sayenge dyd refuse
               That nede he must declare his wofull chaunce
               Wherfore to hym with deedly countenaunce
               With grete syghes & teres distillynge
               He shewed hym it in maner folowynge
            
            
               
               My frende yf it pleased god Immortall
               Dethe more than lyfe to me were ferre better
               For fortune hath made me so bonde & thrall
               That I am lyke from vertue dyffeuer
               Wherfore an honest deth I had leuer
               Than for to lyue & be in worldly shame
               Wherby I myght empayre & lese my name
            
            
               To tell the the chaunce I am ryght shamfast
               But for I ought not dyssemble with the
               To tell the trouthe I shall not be agast
               The cause of my grefe & ennormyte
               Loue beauty shame & also honeste
               Contend & stryue whiche shall haue maystry
               That I knowe not wherto I may apply
            
            
               Unto hym orderly he dyd declare
               How of Sophrone the excellent noblesse
               Was the chefe cause of his sorowe & care
               And how her loue his herte dyd so oppresse
               That of conforte he was remedylesse
               And how by loue he entended to dye
               For withoute shame he knewe no remedy
            
            
               Gesyppus of this was astonyed
               As he y• loued her with all his herte
               And to hym selfe this wyse he replyed
               Better it were from her for to departe
               Rather than Tytus by the cruell darte
               Of loue sholde thus fynysshe his wofull lyfe
               A frende to fynde is harder than a wyfe
            
            
               
               By Tytus te
                     •
                  es to pyte meued
               Was Gesyppus whiche wepte for company
               And in this 
                     〈◊〉
                   Tytus be repreued
               Me thynketh ye be not to me frendly
               In kepynge your sorowe so secretly
               Ye sholde to me soner your mynde dysclose
               What had ben your desyre wyll & purpose
            
            
               Though ye thought the dede to be vnhonest
               Yet to your frende ye sholde it dyscouer
               As well the yll as good he wyll degest
               Yf he be a stedfast frende and louer
               Your helthe & mynde he wyll gladly further
               And yf you nede gyue you his best counsayle
               What thynge therin myght to you moost auayle
            
            
               Yf ye loue Sophrone. I do not meruell
               For knowynge her beauty and noblenes
               Her vertue wysoome whiche dothe so excell
               Wolde moue thy mynde of very gentylnes
               To loue a mayde of so grete worthynes
               For the greter a thynge is of valure
               The more a noble herte it dothe procure
            
            
               But where ye do nowe on fortune complayne
               Whiche hath Sophrone put in my gouernaunce
               Me thynke therof ye sholde be gladde & fayne
               For what man wolde thy desyre more auaunce
               Than his pleasure & namely in suche chaunce
               But alwaye I haue couerted thy helthe
               More than myne owne or ony singuler welthe
            
            
               
               And yf the matter stode in suche a case
               That I myght not refuse it honestly
               Ye had I rather myn honour dyffare
               Than by her cruell loue y• ye sholde dye
               But she is yet in suche estate truely
               That ye may haue her for to be your wyfe
               Whiche I shall do for sauynge of your lyfe
            
            
               Ye had good cause to dyspryse my frendshyp
               Yf in this case I left you destitute
               He is no frende yt kyndnes wyll let slyp
               With honoure whan he may it execute
               How sholde ye me for your frende now repute
               Yf I wolde not in this extremyte
               As a stedfast frende shewe you amyte
            
            
               Sophrone I haue loued with tender herte
               Desyrynge the daye of our maryage
               But my loue is not so veruent & smarte
               But yt I shall my selfe therfro aswage
               Ye loue her with a more better courage
               Wherfore be glad of her ye shall not fayle
               In my chambre shall be your espousayle
            
            
               Wherfore put from your mynd this thought & care
               Leue of your heuynes lamentable
               Restore your selfe to your former welfare
               Ye haue good cause to be confortable
               Apply your selfe to be stronge and able
               That ye may the fruyte of your loue attayne
               Whiche for to haue ye do so moche complayne
            
            
               
               Tytus with this was gretely conforted
               Yet of his profer he had grete meruayle
               To se his kyndnes so soone exorted
               To his desyre voluptuous & frayle
               Gesyppus loue whiche so moche dyd preuayle
               Made hym haue shame of his grete vsurpinge
               Wherfore he spake thus with teeres wepynge
            
            
               Gesyppus thy grete liberalyte
               Is openly to me now manyfest
               Whiche on my parte sholde be shewed to the
               But I shall not obey to thy request
               To take thy wyfe the dede were vnhonest
               Wherfore enioye y• fortune hath the lent
               My hard chaunce to suffre I am content
            
            
               Of thy good fortune vse the chaunce & lote
               And suffre me in sorowe to abyde
               And in salte teres my body to rote
               For harde fortune for me doth so prouyde
               And cruell loue to deth shall be my gyde
               Whiche by desyre me dayly dothe so greue
               That my wretched lyfe it shall me bereue
            
            
               Tytus yf amyte may nowe purchase
               That to my desyre ye wyll you assent
               I shall fynde the meane within a shorte space
               That ye shall haue your purpose & entent
               For ye knowe well that loue is so veruent
               That many haue lost theyr lyfe by y• payne
               Of theyr purpose whan they myght not attayne
            
            
               
               The grefe ye suffre is importunate
               That ye can not therwith longe contynue
               And yf ye sholde by suche mortall 
                     •
                  ate
               Than by lyke chaunce I sholde after ensue
               Yf amyte my mynde coude not subdue
               Yet do I couet your lyfe for to haue
               Wherby I myght myn owne purchase & sau
                     •
                  
               
            
            
               Therfore Sophrone vnto you shall abyde
               Whiche is so excellent a creature
               That ye can not suche another prouyde
               That sholde be so moche vnto your plasure
               My veruent loue I shall ryght well endure
               To loue some other I shall me apply
               Bothe our myndes I may so satysfye
            
            
               Tho suche a wyfe be harde for me to fynde
               yet a sure frende is harder to purchase
               Wherfore to leue her reason doth me bynde
               Than I sholde lese my frende by her trespace
               A wyfe I may me get in lyke space
               But harde it is to fynde a frende stedfast
               A thousande yere yf yt my lyfe sholde last
            
            
               yet do I not my wyfe in this case lese
               Syth y• vnto my frende she shall remayne
               But of. ij. ylles the lest I do chese
               Wherfore yf my prayer may ought obteyne
               From so grete sorowe do your selfe refrayne
               Unto your former state your selfe restore
               That ye may haue yt ye desyre so sore
            
            
               
               Tytus of this was conforted gretely
               And to Gesyppus in this wyse he spake
               I am in doubt where I may apply
               And yf I sholde your profre now forsake
               Whome ye defyre so specyally to take
               But for your kyndenes dothe my shame expel
               I shall applye to your desyre and wyll
            
            
               God graunte y• I may be so fortunate
               You to auaunce with honoure & ryches
               Or to encrease your degre & estate
               Wherby I myght my faythfulnes expresse
               And deserue your benyuolent kyndnes
               That ye may knowe how moche acceptable
               Your mercy is to me agreable
            
            
               Gesyppus sayd I holde this counsayle best
               For asmoche as I haue made a promyse
               I must folowe and colour my behest
               For yf y• I sholde Sophrone nowe dyspyse
               Murmur amonge our frendes soone wolde ryse
               That to an other they wolde her mary
               And so we bothe sholde lese her wylfully
            
            
               Wherfore I thynke it best in my demynge
               That Sophrone as my wyfe y• I shall wedde
               And hyther to my house her for to brynge
               And after that she is brought vnto by bedde
               To her instede of me ye shall be ledde
               Where as ye may accomplysshe your pleasure
               As man & wyfe by lawe & eke nature

               If her frendes ther with wyll be content
               Than is the mater in good case & rest
               And yf they wyll not therunto assent
               yet at the lest ye shall haue your entent

               ¶ How Gesyppus went out of his chambre to
               Tytus and how Tytus lay with Sophrone.
               
                  
               
               This mariage in that tyme was vsed
               That after the tryumphe of the weddynge
               The spouse & bryde sholde be brought vnto bedde
               Where eche vnto other sholde gyue a rynge
               And yf they made therat no refusynge
               Than durynge lyfe they do eche other take
               And els they may promyse than forsake
            
            
               
               Tytus alowed the foresayd counsayle
               Gesyppus Sophrone as his wyfe dyd wedde
               And in his house was made theyr espousayle
               Whan Tytus had his helth recouered
               At nyght the wyues brought the bryde to bedde
               And Gesyppus as custome was truely
               Went to the chamber with her to lye
            
            
               Gesyppus chambre where as the bryde lay
               Tytus chambre annexed was vnto
               Whiche had a lytle dore & secret way
               From the one to the other for to go
               Gesyppus the candell lyght quenched tho
               And to Tytus chambre fast he hastyd
               And with his wyfe to ly he dyd hym bydde
            
            
               Tytus for shame at the fyrst dyd deny
               But Gesyppus of worde & dede stedfast
               Unto his sayenge dyd suche wyse reply
               That to lye with her he graunted at last
               To Sophrons bed he ascended in hast
               And asked in familiaryte
               His wyfe for euer yf yt she wolde be
            
            
               Sophrone wiche knewe nothynge of this mater
               Thought it was Gesyppus y• to her spake
               Wherfore vnto hym she made this answer
               For her husbonde she wolde hym not forsake
               Tytus his wedynge rynge forthe than dyd take
               And put it on the fynger of his wyfe
               Grauntynge to be her husbonde terme of lyfe
            
            
               
               Of venus they vsed the sporte & play
               As pastyme is of louers amerus
               This custome they vsed many a daye
               yet in y• tyme she coude neuer distus
               That her husbonde she lay with was Tytus
               But this coude not be hydde so pryuely
               But at length it must be knowen openly
            
            
               In the meane tyme from Rome were sent lettres
               How his father his mortall lyfe had past
               Wherfore he must his substaunce to possesse
               Resorte thyder in all possyble hast
               Whiche tydynges made Tytus full sore agast
               He couetynge Sophrone with hym to go
               With Gesyppus counseyle what to do
            
            
               This thynge they coude not do cōnuenyent
               Without Sophrone had therof knowledgynge
               Wherfore to shewe her bothe they dyd assent
               And in a secrete chambre they her brynge
               As ye haue herde tolde her of eche thynge
               Whiche for sorowre wepte in grete aboundaunce
               Reprouynge Gesyppus of this false chaunce
            
            
               Without declarynge her mynde & purpose
               Unto her fathers house she resorted
               And vnto hym the chaunce she dyd disclose
               How by Gesyppus she was deceyued
               And y• she was not as they supposed
               The wyfe of Gesyppus but contrary
               By couert meane Tytus dyd her mary
            
            
               
               This thynge her father and frendes dyd greue
               And to Gesyppus kynne they dyd complayne
               So y• they togyder dyd hym repreue
               And for the dede they dyd hym yll dysdayne
               Sayenge he deserued for his false trayne
               In depe pryson to suffre punysshement
               And that this dede he sholde ryght sore repent
            
            
               Gesyppus to theyr sayenge dyd reply
               Affyrmynge the dede to be cōmendable
               And that he deserued to haue truely
               Of them loue & thanke Inestymable
               Whiche had her wedded to one more able
               In ryches honour blood & dygnyte
               Wherby she & hers auaunced sholde be
            
            
               Tytus hauynge knowledge of this barate
               In his mynde he was gretly troublyd
               Knowynge the grekes maner and & estate
               With wordes & thretenynges to fyght & chyde
               Tyll they mete one that dare them well abyde
               Than are they of theyr wordes pacyent
               Theyr symple maner is so Innocent
            
            
               He knowynge theyr custome varyable
               To cause theym to leue theyr malyce & hate
               With a romayns herte he dyd hym able
               In actuall sapyence decorate
               Bothe theyr frendes he dyd there congregate
               Gesyppus beynge with hym in presence
               This wyse he rebuked theyr necligence
            
            
               
               The phylozophers haue determyned
               The actes of euery man mortall
               By the goddes sholde be predestined
               Afore theyr byrthe to be theyr chaunce fatall
               Therfore what fortune vnto vs do fall
               We can not thoughe we wolde therto reply
               Syth yt it is gyuen vs by destyny
            
            
               We ought also faythfully to beleue
               That the goddes haue suche preemynence
               Our fortune at theyr pleasure for to geue
               And yt is iuged by theyr sentence
               Can not be broken by our violence
               Wherfore he is a fole yt wyll dyspyse
               The workes done by the goddes aduyse
            
            
               To my purpose I haue knowledge truely
               That Gesyppus ye haue yll reproued
               For that Sophrone to me he dyd mary
               But yf reason your myndes had moued
               The dede so done ye sholde haue approued
               Sythe yt the goddes dyd it so ordayne
               Not to hym but to me she sholde remayne
            
            
               But for yt some this reason do despyce
               That fortune is by deuyne prouydence
               Whiche thynge to man sholde be grete preiudyce
               I wyll now treate of an other sentence
               Two thynges I am bounde by vyolence
               Whiche to my noblenes is contrary
               But I am compelled for to vary
            
            
               
               One is my selfe of honoure to auaunce
               The other to dysprayse myne enymy
               Whiche I shall do with good remembraunce
               As the matter doth now requyre Justly
               From the trouth of it I wyll not reply
               But with circumspect delyberacyon
               Of my purpose I shall make relacyon
            
            
               Your wordes are grounded more of malice
               Than of ony Just tytle or reason
               Whiche do Gesyppus shamefully dyspyce
               For y• he hath grete kyndnes to me done
               Of two thynges hath the best choson
               My lyfe to saue rather than to fulfyll
               His owne pleasure or your purpose & wyll
            
            
               We are confederate in amyte
               Wherfore the lawe of loue dothe hym thus bynde
               To helpe his frende in his extremyte
               Therfore to proue hymselfe stedfast & kynde
               He shewed loue contrary to your mynde
               Whiche thynge to hym is more cōmendable
               Than to folowe your mynde vnreasonable
            
            
               To one of athenes ye her maryed
               And he hathe geuen her vnto a Romayne
               Athenes to rome may not be compared
               Of all the worlde whiche y• is souerayne
               In whiche I was myn honour to sustayne
               Borne as a cytezyn therin to dwell
               In manhode & leruynge whiche dothe excell
            
            
               
               Ye be bonde & thrall but I am borne fre
               For vnto Rome ye be bonde & subiecte
               Bycause I am scoler in this cyte
               As come of vyle blood ye do me suspecte
               I wyll ye knowe yt I am not abiecte
               My places at rome declare my lynage
               Portured with myn auncestours ymage
            
            
               With tyles of Tryumphe the gate is set
               Whiche myn auncestours by theyr worthynes
               Within the capytoll longe tyme dyd get
               Whiche at this daye doth more and more encrase
               I am a shamed to boost my ryches
               And possessyon whiche are so importune
               As I were the frendly chylde of fortune
            
            
               What cause haue ye Gesyppus to reproue
               That hath wedded Sophrone to suche estate
               At Rome I maye do moche to your behoue
               For the comon welth publyke & priuate
               Yf ye be wyse ye be ryght fortunate
               Gesyppus dothe your blod to honoure rayse
               Wherfore ye haue cause hym to loue & prayse
            
            
               Some may fortune do not so moche dysdayne
               That Sophrone is gyuen me in espousynge
               But for yt I dyd get her by a trayne
               Her frendes therunto not consentynge
               Tho y• I dyd couertly do this thynge
               Lyke a lechour I haue not her forlayne
               Wherby I sholde her & her blood dystayne
            
            
               
               Her fayre beauty enflamed my courage
               That in her loue my herte was set on fyre
               I durst not atempte her in matyage
               Nor of your consent therin to requyre
               For I sholde not optayne of my defyre
               Syth with me to rome y• I sholde her take
               Whose company ye ar lothe to forsake
            
            
               Therfore I haue done this thynge couertly
               To you my mynde I durst not manyfest
               Gesyppus in my name her to mary
               To colour my purpose I thought it best
               Whiche dyd it accordynge to my request
               As a concubyn
                     •
                   I dyd not her vse
               But for my lawfull wyfe I dyd her chuse
            
            
               From Rome there is tydynges vnto me sent
               That my father hath lefte his mortall lyfe
               Wherfore as reason wolde I dyd assent
               Her to lede with me as my lawfull wyfe
               And for I must be from you fugetyue
               Therfore the matter I do many fest
               Requyrynge you it frendely to dysgest
            
            
               If your affynyte I dyd dispyce
               Sophrone with you yf I wolde I myght leue
               And as deluded I may her remyse
               Whiche sholde your hertes more angre & greue
               But god dyffende y• ye sholde me repreue
               Of suche a shame I beynge a Romayne
               Or that my frendes by it sholde dystayne
            
            
               
               Wherfore as a frende I do you requyre
               Your malyce y• ye remembre no more
               But as frendes apply to my desyre
               Sophrone my wyfe vnto me to restore
               With kyndnes I wyll acquyte you therfore
               For whether the dede done be good or yll
               It to amende ye can not thoughe ye wyll
            
            
               And yf my request ye do nowe dyspyse
               Gesyppus with me vnto Rome shall go
               With armed power I shall ageyn you ryse
               Sophrone with stronge honde for to take you fro
               By fell batayle I shall entreate you so
               That ye shall knowe what Indignacyon
               Romayns wyll take for your transgressyon
            
            
               These wordes sayd he arose frome his place
               And Gesyppus by the honde he dyd take
               Knyttynge his browes & frownynge with his face
               His heed for angre at theym he dyd shake
               Suche countenaunce vnto theym he dyd make
               As he dyd dyspyse all theym vtterly
               And as he wolde take vengeaunce cruelly
            
            
               They by these wordes parte for loue dyd gre
               And parte for fere of his grete manasynge
               With hym to haue loue & affynyte
               They thought it best for to be assentynge
               Sith y• Gesyppus had made refusynge
               Tytus affynyte not to forsake
               Wherby they sholde theym both theyr enmys make
            
            
               
               Wherfore all they after Tytus tho went
               Sayenge thy wolde not his wyfe hym witholde
               His frendeshyp to haue they were all content
               Gesyppus theyr talent forgyue they wolde
               And in theyr armes they hym claspe & folde
               With louynge maner as frendes sholde do
               Eche from other departed home to go
            
            
               Sophrone vnto Tytus they sent agayne
               Whiche lyke a noble lady & prudent
               From Gesyppus her loue she dyd refrayne
               And to Tytus her herte she dyd assent
               And with hym to Rome as his wyfe she went
               Where of Tytus frendes & famyly
               She was receyued ryght honorably
            
            
               Gesyppus at athenes styll dyd remayne
               Whiche for he shewed to Tytus amyte
               Of all the people was in grete dysdayne
               And by cruyle dyscorde & enmyte
               He was brought in to suche calamyte
               They hym exiled desolate & poore
               Within athenes neuer to come more
            
            
               He ledynge his lyfe in grete pouerte
               Unto Rome he toke his passage & waye
               To praye Tytus of his benygnyte
               Hym for to helpe in his nedefull afray
               Unto his place he came vpon a day
               Before the gate Tytus he gan abyde
               As he came in of hym to be espide
            
            
               
               Tytus from the market came at the last
               In to his house he went incontynent
               Gesyppus was so heuy & shamefast
               That to Tytus he wolde hym not present
               That he sholde fyrst knowe hym was his entent
               Whiche knewe hym not he was so yll arayd
               Wherfore he past by & to hym nought sayd
            
            
               Gesyppus whiche wrongfully supposed
               That Tytus dyd forsake his acquayntaunce
               Bycause y• he was so poorely clothed
               His grete kyndenes callynge to remembraunce
               To Tytus shewed in his moost nedefull channce
               Parte for sorowe & parte eke for dysdayne
               He went from thens & wofully gan playne
            
            
               Tyll it was nyght aboute he wandered
               Mete he wolde ete but mony had he none
               With thought & care he was so com bered
               That for his dethe he made rufully mone
               And as he was thus walkynge all alone
               Within the cyte he came at the last
               Unto a place whiche was forgrowen and wast
            
            ¶ How Gesyppus lyenge a slepe / two theues came & the stronger slewe the weyker in deuydynge of theyr pray.
            
               
               
            
            
               Aderke caue by chaunce he there soone had founde

               Prouokynge hymselfe for to fall a slepe
               His hard fortune he dyd complayne & wepe
               With heuynesse he was so sore opprest
               That at the last he fell vnto his rest
