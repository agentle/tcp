                     HEnry by the grace of God King of Fraunce and Nauarre, to all men preſent and to come, greeting: Whereas ſince it pleaſed God to call vs to this Crowne, our principall deſire and intent whereat we haue leuelled all our actions, hath tended only to the eſtabliſhment of a good and aſſured peace within this our Realme, to the end that all diſorders, violence and miſeries of warre ceaſing, God might bee ſerued according to his holy commandements: and the authoritie of our lawes and iuſtice reſtored, vnder the protection whereof the three eſtates of our Kingdome might quietly and peaceably enioy ſuch thinges as iuſtly vnto them doe appertaine. For the compaſſing whereof we haue (as it is well knowne) imployed whatſoeuer our habilities, our bloud, yea euen our life, nothing regarding death in reſpect of ſuch reproch and infamie, as iuſtly wee might be charged withall, in caſe we ſhould endure the wrongful vſurpation and diſſipation which ſome men doe preſume to make in this our Crowne of Fraunce. To the end therfore not to omit any thing cōſiſting in the power

of a good Prince, that may tend to the reſtoring of the ſo long expected, ſo neceſſarie & deſired vnion, peace and tranquilitie among our Subiects, we haue with much patience ſupported, and in reſpect of common commoditie pardoned the offences and raſh enterpriſes of diuers, who (were it not for this reſpect) haue deſerued to be chaſtiſed and repreſſed with moſt grieuous, rigorous and exemplarie puniſhments. In conſideration hereof, after all our victories, we haue pardoned & giuen life to thoſe that leuelled at ours: And in regard of the great compaſſion that wee haue taken of the capitall Cittie of our Realme, and to the end to eſchew the ſacke thereof, and to ſaue the bloud of many good Citizens, who were no partakers in the curſed driftes of the fauourers of this rebellion, wee haue choſen rather to fruſtrate our ſelues of that obedience that vnto vs is due, then to ſee the innocent inhabitantes, the women and yong children, together with ſo many beautifull buildinges expoſed to the violence, rage, and fury of fire and ſworde. Wee haue therefore vppon the cauſes and conſiderations aforeſaid, in the moneth of Iuly laſt, agreed and condiſcended to a generall truce, for three monethes, during which time the Deputies of the Faction of our diſobedient Subiectes, haue giuen vs to vnderſtand and aſſured vs, that ſpeedely they would ſende to the Pope, to haue his good aduice vppon ſuch reſolution as they were to take for the concluſion of a good and ſtedfaſt Peace, and reconciliation of vs, who are their King and naturall Prince. Wherein alſo for their partes they haue moſt expreſly promiſed to imploy

themſelues with all loyalty and affection, for the reſtoring of the Peace of this Land, which made vs the more ready to yeeld to the ſaid Truce, albeit wee were ſufficiently enformed of ſuch diſaduantages as otherwiſe vnto them might ariſe, alſo that in matter of armes, wee had them farre on the hippe: yea and that during the ſaid conference, wee had perforce taken the Towne and Caſtell of Dreux, euen in the face of the principall Leaders of their Faction. Notwithſtanding the aſſiſtaunce of the Spaniſh Protectors: as alſo that we wanted no meanes ſo to oppreſſe the ſaide Cittie of Paris, that the want of victuals ſhould in the end haue counſelled them to ſhake off the yoke of thoſe, who for many yeares had tyrannized, and inſolently abuſed their miſerable patience. To all the which notwithſtanding wee of our authoritie did yeeld, the rather in reſpect of the Pope, whome wee wiſhed to be euery way ſatiſfied, & to be truely enformed of our actions and behauiour, to whome alſo we purpoſed to haue recourſe, to lay open our greuances, and to craue his aide, fauour, and aſſiſtance: and to the ſame effect had choſen our deere and well beloued Coſen, the Duke of Neuers, a Prince accompliſhed with all vertues, endewed with wiſedome, pietie, and good deſertes, who preferring the ſeruice of God, and benefite of this Eſtate, before the diſcommodities of his health, and the daungers and tediouſneſſe of the way, hath cheerefully vndertaken the voyage toward him: But as for the Deputies of the ſaid Faction, who ſo aſſuredly promiſed with all diligence to ſend, we haue not perceiued that during the

ſaide three monethes of Truce, they euer made any accompt to depart. Further, albeit that ſince the concluſion of the ſaid Truce of three monethes, we haue in all their actions founde in manner no deſire to reeſtabliſh the publike Peace of this Realme, of the ſpoyle whereof they purpoſe to clothe themſelues, and to grow ritch with the goods and bloud of all good and loyall Frenchmen: with all, that there is come to our handes a certaine Oath, taken by the principal of that Faction, almoſt at the very time that they ſigned the ſaide Truce, and had promiſed faithfully to deale, and to conſider of the meanes, how to conclude a good Peace, and to reconcile themſelues vnto vs, and to that end, to ſend to Rome for the good and wiſe aduiſe of the Pope: the ſaide Oath importing that they ſhould neuer treate of any Peace or agreement with vs, wherein they ſuffered themſelues to bee ſo farre carried away with the paſſions of the King of Spaynes agents, that they reſerued not ſo much as the Popes authoritie, to whome they promiſed to ſend: we were therewith grieued, and prouoked, accordinge to the exigence of the caſe: All which notwithſtanding, vpon their deſire to prolong the Truce for twoo monethes more. vz. to the ende of the moneth of December laſt, ſhewing vs that it was vnpoſſible vppon our refuſall of this delay, for their Deputies to come to Rome time inough to be at ye reſolution, which might be there taken for the revnion of our Subiectes to our obedience, we vpon a deſire to iuſtifie whatſoeuer our actions in the preſence of the Pope preferring our purpoſed reſpect vnto him

before our owne profite, and the ſuretie of our affaires which we much hindered and prolonged, by reaſon of the ſaid delayes and prolonginges of the Truce, wee yet graunted them the ſame for the monethes of Nouember and December. Howbeit gathering by the ſmall deſire that they had to ſee an ende of the miſeries of this Realme, together with the authoritie that vniuſtly they haue vſurped ouer a parte thereof: iudging alſo by the delayes, ſo artificially by them procured, that in all likelyhood they tended onely to prolong the calamities of France, and to aſſure to themſelues the wrongfull vſurpation of the townes and Prouinces by them poſſeſſed. We vpon theſe cauſes hauing referred all theſe matters to the conſideration & mature deliberation of the Counſel, haue reſolued to deny them the prorogation of the ſaid Truce, for the monethes of Ianuary, February, and March, which they craued with ſuch inſtance, as we had cauſe iuſtly to beleeue, that ſuch purſuite neuer tended to grow to any good concluſion of Peace, but rather to temporize vntill the Spaniſh forces might arriue in our frontiers of Picardy, by whoſe comming into the Realme, they mighte haue the better oportunitye to proſecute warre againſt vs, to the deſtruction of our good & loyal Subiectes: which God of his holy grace would not permit, who hath opened our eyes to ſee, (by ſuch their miſſiues as haue bene intercepted,) into their wicked deuiſes, and obſtinate reſolution to mainetaine a perpetuall miſchiefe within this our Kingdome: his deuine clemency hauing taken into his eſpeciall protection the defence of our iuſt cauſe,

and enſpired the hartes of an infinite number of our good vaſſalls and Subiectes, to acknowledge the duety wherein they are naturally bound vnto vs, as appeereth by the comming in within theſe three monethes into our obedience of the townes of Meaux, Lyons, Orleans, Bourges, Pontoiſe and others, among all others ſhal neuer be forgotten the happy comming in of our good towne of Paris, the head Cittie of this Realme, which happened the two and twentieth of March, with ſuch clemency, pollicy, good order and moderation, that not ſo much as one onely Citizen can iuſtly complaine of any iniury or offence againſt him any way committed: where the entry of our Army ſhewed no diſcontentment, but rather reſembled the ioyfull entry heretofore made by the Kinges our predeceſſors at their comming to the crowne, in that the ioy and applauſe of the people, vppon the ſight of their ſo long deſired King, were no whit leſſe then if they had euen then enioyed the like ſurety, as by theſe preſents is vnto them graunted of our grace, fauor, and protection, with forgetfullneſſe of all thinges paſt, and aſſurance that we will neuer put in obliuion the deſertes of ſuch as in our ſeruice haue made ſhew of their vertue and ſtedfaſtneſſe. The conſideration hereof, together with the eſpeciall goodneſſe wherewith (vpon this occaſion) it hath pleaſed God to fauour vs, hath, and ſtill doeth bind vs more then any other mortall creature, to imagine, and continually to deuiſe how we may make our actions and behauiours agreeable before the holy maieſtie of his deuine prouidence, who as hee ſurpaſſeth in goodneſſe

and clemency, whatſoeuer the ſpirite of man is able to comprehend, ſo hath he voutchfafed to leaue vnto vs as an inſtruction and teſtimony, the example and woord of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, to teſtifie vnto vs that whoſoeuer will be accompted his children, muſt forget others tranſgreſsions. Vpon this occaſion acknowledging that nothing is vnto vs a greater witneſſe that wee are made to the likeneſſe of God, then courteſie and gentleneſſe, freely forgetting all paſſed offences and tranſgreſſions: We haue, and by theſe preſentes doe declare, that wee haue, and doe accept into our fauour, the Citizens, dwellers, and inhabitants of our good towne of Paris: Of our eſpeciall fauour and autority royall, we haue and doe aboliſh all matters happened in the ſaid towne during, and by occaſion of theſe preſent troubles, wee will and ordaine, that the ſame doe remaine ſuppreſſed, aboliſhed, extinguiſhed, and taken as thinges neuer happened: and to that effect with the aduice of the Princes and Lordes of our Counſell about vs we haue ordeined and decreed theſe thinges enſuing.
               1 Firſt we will and ordeine according to the Edict of pacification eſtabliſhed by the late King our deere brother and Lord in the yeare 1577. together with the Declarations ſince by vs made for the obſeruation of the ſame, that within the Citty and Suburbes of Paris, and within tenne leagues round about, determined by the ſaid Edict, there ſhall be no exerciſe of any other then the Romiſh Religion: We doe alſo expreſly forbid all maner of perſons, vnder the paines in our Decrees contained, not to moleſt or diſquiet the

Clergie in the celebration of diuine ſeruice, in the enioying or receiuing of the fruites, and reuenues of their benefices, or of any other the rights or duties vnto them appertaining, whereof to that purpoſe wee haue, and by theſe preſents doe giue the ful poſſeſſion. Alſo our wil and intent is, that whoſoeuer ſince theſe troubles haue ſeaſed vpon any Churches, houſes, goods or reuenues appertaining to the ſaid Clergie, reſident within the dioceſſe of Paris, as well of ſuch as are reſident in our ſaide towne, as elſewhere throughout our Realme, and which doe detaine or occupie the ſame, ſhall redeliuer vnto them the full poſſeſſion and free vſe of the ſame, together with all rights, liberties and priueledges that they enioyed before they were diſſeaſed of the ſame.
               2 Alſo for a more full and perpetuall declaration of the ſingular affection and loue that we beare to our good towne of Paris, we haue remitted, reintegrated, and reſtored, and doe remit, reintegrate and reſtore the ſame to all her auncient priuiledges, rights, graunts, franchizes, liberties and freedomes wherwith ſhe hath heretofore beene endued by the Kinges our predeceſſors, all which we doe by theſe preſents a new graunt, confirme and continue the ſame to vſe, and from henceforth to enioy well and duely as in times paſt and before theſe preſent troubles, as well in all matters concerning the vniuerſitie, the body and towne houſe, the prouoſt of Marchaunts, the Shriuewicke and officers of the ſame, as all other bodies, Colledges and Commonnalties of whatſoeuer title or qualitie, which heretofore and before

the ſaid troubles haue bene eſtabliſhed.
               3 To the end alſo to take away all cauſe of enquiries, proceſſes & quarels in time to come, vpon occaſion of any thing happened, during the ſaid troubles: vpon a more ample declaration of our will concerning the diſcharge and aboliſhment afore contained, wee haue ordained and decreed, and by theſe preſents doe ordaine and decree, that the remembrance of whatſoeuer hath paſſed in the ſaid towne of Paris and therabouts, ſo farre as the ſame may concerne the ſaide inhabitaunts and others that were preſent in the towne at the yeelding of the ſame, who ſhall within eight daies after the publication of theſe preſents, exhibite their othes and promiſes contained in our declaration heretofore publiſhed in our Parliament at Paris, from the beginning of theſe preſent troubles, & vpon occaſion of the ſame vnto this day, ſhall remaine extinct and quenched, as well for taking of armes, ſurprize of Townes, forcing of townes, Caſtles, houſes or fortreſſes, razng of the ſame, leuying of Coyne of the recepts generall or particular, of Tenthes, Gable, and ſale of Salt, taxes impoſed vpon the ſame, and all other impoſitions and leuie of Coyne, as wel in the ſaid towne as neere there about, all treaties and forraine impoſition exacted vpon wares, Marchandize, Victuals, caſting of Ordinaunce and Bullets, making of Poulder & Saltpeter with other inſtruments of warre, coyning of mony, practiſings & leuies of Souldiers, conducts and exployts of the ſame, leagues, negotiations and treaties either in the Realme or without, ſale of mooueables, ſelling of

woods, either vnderwood or Timber, amends, booties, raunſomes or any other acts of hoſtilitie: And generally all other thinges that haue beene done, wrought and negotiated after whatſoeuer forme or manner, publike or priuate, during theſe preſent troubles or by occaſion of the ſame: So as neither the ſaid inhabitaunts, neither any of them ſhall from henceforth be troubled, moleſted, diſquieted or ſifted in any maner or ſort whatſoeuer: Willing that to that effect they remaine quit and diſcharged, and in ſuch caſes impoſing perpetuall ſilence to all our atturnies general or any other Parſons whatſoeuer. Our meaning alſo is, and (expreſly) we doe enioyne them that they giue ouer all Leagues, treatiſe, aſſotiacions, practiſes or intelligences as well within the Realme as without, that may any way be repugnant to our authoritie, vnder paine to be puniſhed as guiltie of treaſon. Likewiſe for the auoiding of all occaſions of quarell or debate that may ariſe among our Subiects, we haue inhibited and forbidden, and by theſe preſents doe inhibit and forbid them any way to iniury, reproch, offend or prouoke one an other, either by deede or word for any thing paſſed or during theſe troubles, enioyning them to continue themſelues, and to liue quietly together as good brethren, friends and fellow Citizens vnder the obſeruation of our Edicts, vpon paine to all offenders preſently to bee puniſhed without farther forme of law or proceſſe as diſturbers of the common quiet.
               4 Furthermore we will & ordaine that all arreſts commiſſions, and executions of the ſame, all decrees,

ſentences, iudgments, contracts, and al iudicial acts paſſed betweene parties of one faction, and between all ſuch as voluntarily haue gone to law as well in Soueraigne courtes, in the prouoſtie of Paris, in the preſidiall Sea, and in other courts and iuriſdictions of the ſaid towne, prouoſtſhip and vicomptie during the ſaid troubles, ſhall be good and in force: Neither ſhall there be any enquirie taken vpon executions of death that haue paſſed by the authoritie of iuſtice or courſe of warre and commandement of leaders. Alſo as concerning decrees, ſentences and iudgments graunted againſt the abſent of contrarie factions, whether in criminall courtes or ciuill, or in any the Soueraigne courtes of this Realme or the iuriſdictions of the ſame, they ſhall remaine voide and of none effect vpon any cauſe or occaſion whatſoeuer: Likewiſe all iudgements paſſed againſt the Countie Briſſar in reſpect of the partie that he followed, ſhal be cancelled and reuoked, as alſo ſhall bee whatſoeuer giftes by vs or our prediceſſors of any the goods to him appertaining made or granted, & that in conſideration of the great Loyall and moſt commendable ſeruice done to vs & to the whole eſtate of the Realme, in reducing of the good towne of Paris vnto our obedience. Alſo as concerning all executions of death paſſed againſt any the inhabitants for any matter depending vpon the ſaid troubles, our will and meaning is that the ſaide executions ſhall be no way preiudicial to the honor or memory of the dead: Alſo that ſuch confiſcations as our attournies haue or may pretend vnto, ſhall take no place to the preiudice of their

widdowes children and heires.
               5 We will and our pleaſure is, that all the ſaid inhabitants that ſhall performe the ſaid promiſes, ſubmiſſion and Oath, ſhall reenter into the enioying of their goods, offices, dignities and demaines whatſoeuer ſituated or being, wherein we reuoke all giftes and graunts of any ſuch things that may be preiudiciall to thoſe to whom they did appertaine, or to their widdowes, and heyres.
               6 In conſideration of ſeazures heretofore made vpon the goods, inhearitances, rents and reuenues of the ſaid inhabitants of Paris, or elſewhere within the ſaid prouoſtſhip or vicoumpt, who ſhall fulfill the ſaid promiſes and ſubmiſſions, in whatſoeuer place the ſaid goods be ſituate or remaining, they ſhall remaine voide: And we doe graunt to the ſaide inhabitants ful and perfect recouery of the ſaid ſeazures and haue acquitted and reſtored vnto them whatſoeuer may be vnto vs due in reſpect of the ſame, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer graunts that may bee paſſed, which we haue cancelled and reuoked, and by theſe preſents doe cancell and reuoke, without reſpect of any promiſes or bondes not diſcharged, made by the labourers or fermers as well to the graunts as to the Commiſſaries and Fermers in law, which are and ſhall ſtand voide: Alſo as concerning Debts or credit due to the ſaid inhabitants, our pleaſure is that with reſpect of gifts that therof may haue bene granted, al which we haue, and doe cancell and reuoke, they may compell or cauſe to bee compelled all ſuch as are to them bound by bond, promiſe, Obligation or ſetting

ouer to pay in like forme as they might haue done before the ſaid troubles.
               7 All prouiſions of Offices graunted by the Duke of Mayenne ſhal remaine voide and of no effect. Howbeit ſuch as haue obtained the ſaid prouiſions by the death or reſignation of ſuch as haue beene of their owne faction (except the eſtate of preſidents in our Soueraigne courts) ſhall bee continued in the ſaide Offices by our letters of prouiſion, which to that end ſhall be diſpatched vnto them, without paying any thing as alſo ſhall be continued in like forme all new Officers by vs erected in matter of ſalte, that haue purchaſed their prouiſions of the Duke of Mayenne, which alſo ſhall remaine voide and of no effect.
               8 Such as by the Duke of Mayenne haue bene promoted to benefices not conſiſtoriall, being within the ſaide Cittie voide by death ſhall bee continued in the ſame by taking of vs their dimiſſories neceſſarie, whereby ſuch as they haue had from the Duke of Mayenne ſhal reſt voide and of no effect.
               9 In reſpect of ſuch the inhabitants as were not in the towne at the yeelding of the ſame, whereſoeuer they were or might be, they ſhall enioy the like benefit as others that were preſēt, in caſe within one month after the publication of theſe preſents they doe come in, and make the ſaid ſubmiſſions and promiſe to liue vnder our obedience.
               10 All ſuch inhabitants as vnder our Paſports ſhall depart the towne and betake them into any other parts of our obedience, bearing them ſelues modeſtly and committing nothing repugnant to the fidelitie

they owe vnto vs, vpon their ſubmiſſions and promiſes afore mentioned, ſhall enioy their goods without trouble or moleſtation,
               11 For the eaſe of the ſaide inhabitants, during this preſent yeare, the Debters of ſet rents ſhall not be compelled to paie more of their arreareges quarterly then the yearely ſtint, without preiudice to other former arreareages, for the which there ſhall be order ſet downe, as much to the eaſe of euery man as may be.
               12 That the accompts made at Paris during the troubles by any that were accomptable before the officers of accompts there reſident, ſhall not be ſubiect to the reuiew, but onely in caſe of ordinance.
               13 We meane not notwithſtanding in theſe preſents to comprize any thing committed in forme of thefte or without aduowe: In conſideration whereof we haue permitted and doe permit vnto euery man all free libertie by courſe of law to ſeeke their remedie as they ſhall thinke good, as alſo we doe except all ſuch as ſhall be found guiltie of the horrible murder committed on the Parſon of the late king our deere Lord & brother or of any conſpiracie againſt our life: As alſo all treſpaſſes and tranſgreſſions puniſhable betweene men of one ſelfe faction.
               We doe therefore commaund our deare and truſty Chauncellor, the officers of our Crowne, all Dukes and Peeres of Fraunce and all the Lords of our Counſell and the ordinarie maiſters of requeſts of our houſe, to the ſame end by vs appointed and deputed, to cauſe theſe preſents to be read, publiſhed, and enrowled

in the regiſters of our courte of Parliament, in our Chamber of accompts, in our courte of Aides, in our generalls of Moneys and in all other places expedient: Willing and commaunding that the contents of the ſame be inviolably kept and obſerued, and that notwithſtanding whatſoeuer oppoſitions, appellations, edicts, declarations, arreſts, iudgements, letters, precepts prohibitions and other matters hereto contrarie, to all which in reſpect hereof we haue and by theſe preſents doe derogate together withall derogatories of derogatories thereunto contrarie. For to the end the ſame may remaine firme and ſtedfaſt for euer, we haue to theſe preſents Signed with our hand, ſet our Seale, giuen at Paris in the Moneth of March the yeare of grace 1594. and of our Raigne the fifth.

            The Kinges Letters Patents for the reeſtabliſhment of the Court of Parliament of Paris.
            Tranſlated out of the French copie, Printed at Paris by Frederick Morell, by E. A.
            
               HEnry by the grace of God, King of Fraunce and of Nauarre: To all them to whome theſe preſent Letters ſhall come, greetinge. Whereas through the miſhap of the diſſention rayſed and continued in this our Realme, by the wicked driftes of ſome forreine Princes our enemies, and other our rebellious ſubiectes as well in the time of the late King our moſt honourable Lord and brother, as alſo ſince our comming to the crowne, ſondry townes haue beene withdrawen from the obedience due to our ſaide Lord and brother, and to vs: among the which our good towne of Paris, hauing bene occupied by our ennemies and manifeſtly endaungered to the intollerable yoake and ſhamefull dominion of the Spanyard, hath perpetrated many thinges contrary to the obedience due to their lawfull King: where remayned an infinite number of Citizens, ſome for feare of the loſſe of their goods, others for that they could not abandon ſuch perſons, to whoſe preſeruation by nature they were bound: others for want of meanes and ability to liue elſewhere: and ſome vppon a deſire to doe ſeruice to vs, and to the

whole common-wealth of this Realme. Among whome ſondry Officers of our Court of Parliament did there make their reſidence and continued the exerciſe of the Office to them committed, which before the troubles they had executed in our ſaide Parliament: for the which our ſaide Lord and brother hauing conceiued againſt them moſt iuſt indignation, did inhibite them, and therevpon made certaine declarations ſince publiſhed in the Court of Parliament tranſferred to Tours: The like whereof, and vpon the like cauſe and occaſion our ſelues continued as declaring whatſoeuer their decrees, iudgements, and ordinances to bee voyde and of none effect. Howbeit in reſpect of the cauſes contayned in our Edict which we cauſed to be publiſhed in our great Chamber of Parliament: we of our eſpeciall grace, full power and authority royall, haue extinguiſhed and aboliſhed all matters committed in our ſaide good towne of Paris, during and by occaſion of the troubles: As alſo, wee haue thought it requiſite and neceſſary for the benefite of our ſeruice and common quiet, to the end ſo good a towne ſhould not remaine deſtitute of the exerciſe of iuſtice royall, for the preſeruation of the good, and puniſhment of the wicked, vntill wee may reaſſemble the whole body of that our ſaid Court, by the returne of our truſty and welbeloued, the members of our ſaid Court of Parliament tranſferred to Tours: Alſo the Chamber erected at Chalais for the exerciſe of Iuſtice, whome to that end wee haue ſent for: that the Counſellors and other Officers of the ſaid Court, who haue had their prouiſions from the

kinges our predeceſſors, & haue made their reſidence in this ſaid towne before the ſaide troubles, ſhould be reſtored and reintegrated in the exerciſe of their functions as hauing deemed the ſaid Counſellers worthy this our fauour and grace, in reſpect of the vertue and conſtancy by them ſhewed in ſundry matters, namely in the reſolution taken to make the Decree which they publiſhed and vertuouſly mainetained in the moneth of Iune laſt paſt, againſt ſuch as endeuored to alter and infringe the orders of the lawfull ſucceſſion of this Realme. In conſideration whereof, we haue taken away, and diſanulled, and do take away and diſanull the interdiction made, as well by the ſaid King, as by vs againſt the ſaide Counſellers and other officers, at this preſent in good number reſident in this ſaide towne, who after they ſhall haue taken the oath herein requiſite, in the handes of our truſty and deere Chauncelor, ſhalbe reeſtabliſhed and reſtored to the exerciſe of their Offices: as by theſe preſents we haue reſtored and reeſtabliſhed, and doe reſtore and reeſtabliſh them: to the end after the ſaid oath, they may enioy the like honors, prerogatiues, rightes, authorities, priuileges and preeminences, which afore time they had and did enioy, before the ſaid interdictions: ſo as the ſaid Counſellers may do, and performe all actes and exerciſes of iuriſdiction, and ſoueraigne Iuſtice, that appertayneth to our Parliament, in as ample maner, as they did or might haue done, in caſe the ſaide Interdictions had neuer bene againſt them declared, proceeding to the publication of Edictes, admiſſion of Officers, ſoueraigne

iudgements and all other expeditions and orders heretofore made in our ſaide Parliament. Wee doe therefore commaund our moſt truſty and welbeloued Chauncelor: the Officers of the Crowne: the Dukes and Pieres of France: the other Lords of our Counſell, and the ordinary Maſters of Requeſtes, by vs committed and deputed, that they cauſe theſe preſents to be read, publiſhed, and regiſtred, to the ende the contentes of the ſame may be kept, obſerued and put in execution, according to their forme and tenure: For ſuch is our pleaſure: In witneſſe whereof, wee haue ſigned theſe preſentes with our hand, and to the ſame affixed our ſeale. Giuen at Paris the 28. of March, the yeare of grace 1594. and of our raigne the fifth.

            The Decree of the Court of Parliament of Paris, of the 30. day of March 1594.
            Gathered out of the Regiſters of Parliament.
            
               THe Court hauing from the xii. day of the moneth of Ianuary laſt, ſollicited the Duke of Mayenne to acknowledge that King, whome God & the lawes haue giuen to this Realme, and to procure the Peace, wherevnto he would neuer condiſcend, as being inuegled by the pollicies of the Spanyardes and their adherents: and God hauing ſithence of his infinite goodneſſe deliuered this Towne of Paris, out of the hands of ſtraungers, and reduced the ſame into the obedience of her naturall and lawfull King. Hauing yeelded ſolemne thankes to God for this happy ſucceſſe, deſirous to imploy the authority of the Soueraigne Iuſtice of this Realme, to the end, that by preſeruing the Romane Religion, we might hinder ſtrangers

vnder the falſe pretence thereof, from ſeaſing vppon the Eſtate: and call agayne all Princes, Prelates, Lordes, Gentlemen, and other Subiectes to the grace and clemency of the King, and to a generall reconciliation, and to repaire whatſoeuer the licence of the Ciuill warres hath altered in the authority of the Lawes, and foundation of the Eſtate, Rights, and Honours of the Crowne: the matter deliberated vppon in the ſaide Court, all the Chambers aſſembled, Hath declared, and doeth declare all Arreſtes, Decrees, Ordinances, and Oathes, giuen, made, and taken, ſithence the nine and twentieth of December Anno 1588. in preiudice of the authority of our kings and Lawes of the Realme, to be voyde and wreſted by force and violence: and as ſuch, hath reuoked, cancelled and annihilated them, and ordayned that they ſhall remayne aboliſhed and ſuppreued: And eſpecially hath declared, and doeth declare whatſoeuer hath bene done, contrary to the Honor of the late King Henry the third, aſwell during his life, as ſithens his deceaſe, to bee voyde: Doeth prohibite all perſons to ſpeake of his memory, otherwiſe then with honor and reuerence. And moreouer ordayneth that information ſhall be taken of the deteſtable parricide committed on his perſon, and extraordinarily proceeded againſt thoſe that ſhall be found guilty thereof. The ſayd Court hath reuoked and doeth reuoke the power heeretofore giuen to the Duke of Mayenne, vnder the quallity of Lieftenaunt Generall of the Eſtate and Crowne of Fraunce: It prohibiteth all

perſons, of what eſtate or condition ſoeuer, to acknowledge him in this calling: To yeeld him any obedience, fauour, comfort, or ayde, vpon paine to be puniſhed as offendors guilty of high Treaſon. And vppon like payne hath enioyned the ſayd Duke of Mayenne, and other Princes of the houſe of Lorrayne, to acknowledge King Henry the fourth of that name, Kinge of Fraunce, for their Kinge and Soueraigne Lord, and to yeeld vnto him the obedience and ſeruice to hym due. And to all other Princes, Prelates, Lordes, Gentlemen, Townes, Comminalties, and particular perſons, to forſake the pretended partye of the Vnion. Whereof the Duke of Mayenne hath made himſelfe head, and to yeeld vnto the Kinge ſeruice, obedience and fidelitie: Vppon payne, that the ſayde Princes, Lordes and Gentlemen bee degraded from theyr Nobilitie and declared Peaſantes, both they and their poſteritie, with confiſcation of body and goods, razing and ruinatinge of Townes, Caſtells, and places, which ſhall bee infringers of the commandemente and ordinaunce of the Kinge. Hath cancelled and reuoked, doth cancell and reuoke whatſoeuer hath beene doone, decreed and ordayned by the pretended Deputies of the aſſembly holden in this Towne of Paris, vnder the name of the Generall Eſtates of this Realme: as voide and done by priuate perſons, choſen, and wrought for the moſt parte by the Factious of thys Realme, and partakers with the Spanyarde, and hauinge no

lawfull power at all. Doeth prohibite the ſayd pretended Deputies, to take vppon them this qualitie, or to aſſemble themſelues any more in thys Towne or elſe-where, vppon payne to bee puniſhed as diſturbers of the common reſt, and Traytors. And doeth enioyne thoſe of the ſayd pretended Deputies, which yet at this preſent are in this Towne of Paris, to withdraw themſelues euery of them in hys houſe, there to lyue vnder the obedience of the King, and to take the Oath of fidelitie before the Iudges of the places.
            Hath alſo ordayned and doeth ordayne that all proceſsions and ſolemnities ordayned, during the troubles, and by reaſon thereof ſhall ceaſe, and in ſteed thereof, the two and twentieth day of March ſhallbe for euer kept holy, and vpon the ſame day ſhal be a generall proceſſion, according to the accuſtomed manner. Whereat ſhallbe aſſiſtant the ſayd Court in red Robes, in remembrance, and for to giue thankes to God for the happy deliuery and reduction of the ſayd Towne to the Kinges obedience: And to the end no perſon pretend cauſe of ignorance of this preſent decree: hath ordayned and doth ordayne, that it ſhall bee read, and publiſhed by ſound of Trumpet and publike crye, throughout all the chiefe quarters of thys Towne of Paris, and in all the Courtes of this Iuriſdiction: and to this end the ſame ſhall bee printed, and at the diligence of the Kinges Atturney Generall ſhall be ſent to all his Subſtitutes: Whome it enioyneth to ſee the ſame

executed, and thereof to certifie the ſayd Courte. Done in Parliament, the thirtith day of March 1594.
            
            Read and Publiſhed by ſound of Trumpet, and Proclamation, throughout the principall quarters of this Towne of Paris, the next day being the laſt of the ſayd moneth.
