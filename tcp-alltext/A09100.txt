            Taken in hand since the deathe of the sayd M. Campian, and broken of agayne before it could be ended, vpon the causes sett downe in an epistle to M. Charke in the begyninge.
            
               Sap. 3. The sovvles of the iust are in the hande of God, and the torment of deathe shall not touche them: they seemed to the eyes of foolishe men to dye, but neuerthelesse they rest in peace.

            THE SETTER FORTH OF THIS booke vnto VVilliam Charke Minister.
            
               IT maye be (M. Charke) that you haue expected now somewhat longe, or at leastwyse remayned in some suspence of this defence of the Censure, or reioynder to your replye. VVhich Cēsure, being written (as I haue heard) in eight or nyen dayes space at the most: this defence therof hathe now hadde the staye, more than of so many monethes, before it come to light. But the cause therof is easie to Iudge, especiallie to you, whiche (for the most part,) are priuye to the same.
            In generall, euery one can imagine by hym selfe, how difficult a thing yt is in England at this daye, for a Catholique man to write any book: where nether libertie, nor rest, nor librarie, nor conference, nor beinge is permitted hym. And in particular, thus muche I must adde, whiche you alredie in part doe knowe: that soone after the publishinge of your reply to the Censure, the Author therof addressed hym selfe to a defence, and had in greate part dispatched the same, redie for the printe, in suche sort as the rigorous tyme of your persecution permitted hym. But God sufferinge at that verie instāt; that the sayd print so long sought, and muche feared by you; should be taken: there was taken, lost, and dispersed ther-withall; not onelie all furniture there redy for this booke, but also for sundry other thinges, partlie printed; and partlie in printing; concerning our defence of trueth and equitie, against your falsehood and violent oppressions.
            This disturbance, and losse beinge fallen owt by gods most holy and fatherlie permission: and the Author of the Censure hauing nether tyme, nor place, nor bookes, nor leysure to begynne agayne, nor any hope of print when he should haue done the same: being also necessarilie called awaye at that verye tyme, to a place somewhat farof, vppon vrgent businesse: he resolued



vtterlie to gyue ouer the sayd attempt of defence, partlie vppon the difficulties now alleaged, and partly for that in very dede your replie (M. Charke) seemed sufficientlye to answer yt selfe, being so obscure in many places, as most men without the Censure might not vnderstād yt: and so weake otherwise, as yt needed litle confutation of others. These were some causes: but in deed (as I vnderstand) the principall and cheefe cause was, for that M. Campian (the greatest occasion, and subiect of the Censure) was now also euen at that tyme fa
                  •
               len into your handes, according as you had long wished: and therfore it was to be looked, that accordinge to reason, and all your owne promises, he should be disputed withall openlie, publiklie, and freelie: and so the cheefe matter of the Censure, and your replye (without any more writing) dispatched and taken awaye.
            But after, when it came to hearinge of the worlde abrode
                  •
                how curteouslie you had vsed this learned man with tormentes, bothe before and after hys disputatiōs: and how without all indifferencie or law of reasoning, you handled hym in your conference in the Tower: & how finallie you made hym awaye by cruell deathe, without any shew, or shadow of particular crime committed by hym, against prince or countrie: and that your selfe (M. Charke) as a conquerour of your aduersarie, folowed hym in person to the place of hys Martyrdome, with bygge lookes, sterne countenāce, prowde woordes, and merciles behauyour, (for all these thinges were commonlie reported:) true it is, that diuers godlie men were moued therwithall (and the Author of the Censure, among other) to take in hand agayne the Answer of your booke: aswell for the honour of Christ hys martyre now in rest: as also for declaration to th
                  •
                worlde, of what value you are in reason, learninge, and weight of argument by writinge: whiche are so fearse and violent vpon gods Sainctes at home, in deathe and tormentes: and so Pompeous in gate and speeche vnto the people: for gatheringe, or retayninge some credit vnto your cause.
            
               This (I saye) shall appeare partelye by thys booke. And for these considerations was it taken in hand, after the late deathe of Good M. Campian. Mary yet, (as it was like enough to fall owt) your spyes, searchers, and other persecutours disturbed the writer therof, before he could end the same: as may appeare to the reader by the sight heerof. For this parte being come to my handes, & perceyuing that the authour could not (
                  •
               or this present) goe forward with the rest. I thought it best to bestowe this vpon you, (M Chark) therby to fynde you occupyed, (yf it please you to answer it) vntill the other parte also come to be sett forth.
            Thus brokenlie we are enforced to deale, through the extremitie of tyme, as you see. VVherin, you hauing gotten the start before vs in the fauour of our Prince, you folow the same with such vehemencie, and straytnes, as you allowe vs no one iote, ether of curteousie, or humanitie, or of reasonable indifferencie. You exclude vs from speeche, conference, writing, printing, disputing, or any other dew tryall of our cause. You watche, spye, searche, examine, and persecute euerywhere. You attache, dryue awaye, putt in pryson, rent on racke, put to death those whiche speake, or wryte, or stand in defence of trueth against you. You leaue no Innes, tauernes, fieldes, stables, barnes, douecotes, or palaces vnsearched for vs. And how then is it possible to answere you by wryting? Or what maruayle is there, yf we offer you some tymes halfe a booke for the whole? I doubt not but what soeuer extremitie or crueltie you vse (which shalbe no greater, nor longer than God will permit:) yet you are sure allwayes to be answered by some meanes or other, that God wyll prouide. Hytherto you haue had litle quyet repose in your intrusiō vpon gods Churche, we contynuynge styll our claym
                  •
                and tytle. And heerafter you are lyke daylye to haue lesse, (as I hope) vntill your heresie be rooted owt again, as all her sisters haue bene heeretofore.
            It is a great argument to the people, that the credit of your cause is now crushed euen in your owne



conceytes, seyng you flye openlye, and without shame, all kynde of quiet tryall what soeuer: and with furye moue the magistrate onelye to violence agaynst vs. VVhich thoughe we be redy to be are with all humiltie, according as God shall gyue vs patiēce: yet will we neuer yeeld to you therby in your heresies: but in the myddest of our afflictiōs will we resist your falshoode, more than before. This (I thinke) you sawe in the late martyrdome of good M. Campian, and his companions: whoe, thoughe they dyed moste ioyfullie, protesting their innocencie in all and singular the slaunders deuised against them: thoughe (I saye) they protested pure innocencie therin, both in thought word and deed: and that, vpon the eternall damnation, or saluation of their owne sowles: though also they forgaue moste franklie from the verie bottom of their hartes, all their vniust accusers, condemners, tormentours, executioners, and you also ministers, whoe of their deathe and tormentes were the onelie, or principall instigatours: yet dyd they amyddest all that humilitie, modestie, and Christian charitie, detest with all possible vehemencie of their sowles, all and singular your false and fowle heresies: and so dyed moste constant, pure, and innocent martyres of their Lord & Maister Iesus Christ. VVhose bloode I dowbt not, but will fight agaynst your errours and impietie, many hundred yeres after bothe you are past this worlde together. And albeit, yf they had lyued (especiallie two of them) being indued with suche gyftes, and rare partes, as they were, (which with you were greate causes of hastenyng theyr deathes,) they might (no dowt) haue done muche seruice in gods Churche, and hurt to your cause: yet could they neuer haue done it so strongly, as they haue, and doe, and will doe by theyr deathes: the crye wherof worketh more forciblie bothe with God & man, thā any bookes or sermons, that euer they could haue made. VVherfore, I can say no more, but that they were well bestowed vpon you. You haue vsed thē to the best. Our Lord & his holy name be blessed therfore. And I beseeche hym

                  See of this after: pag. 120.An other example may be this. There was a controuersie betwene the Censurer and M. Charke, whether concupiscence after baptisme be synne in the regenerat, without consent. And the Censurer, to proue that it is not, bringeth S. Augustins Authoritie in many plaine places: wherby M. Chark being sore oppressed, fyndeth no other releefe of his credit with the reader, but to forge a place of S. Austen to the contrarye, by corruption: and so he doeth For wher as S. Augustin sayeth, that cōcupiscence is not so forgyuen in baptisme, that it is not:


               
meaning therby that it is not so taken away by baptisme, but that it remaynith styll to tempt vs: M. Charke to deceyue the reader foysteth in this woorde (synne) to S. Austens text, reciting his woordes thus: Concupiscence is not so forgyuen in baptisme, that it is not sinne: By whiche addition of the woorde (synne) the matter seemeth to stand cleere on hys syde. And this also can not be excused by ignorance: but sheweth open and willfull malice in the man.
            I passe ouer many of these and suche lyke tryck
                  •
               s: whiche can not proceede of negligence, simplicitie, or ignorance: but muste needes be effectes of sett-malice. As where he reportinge diuers vntruethes against the Iesuites owt of Gotuisus, (as he now sayeth:) concealed the author in his first booke. And now, though vppon necessitie he confesse the same: yet fynding the things there reported, in his consciēce to be false: where as his Author citeth allwayes two Iesuites bookes for proofe of the same: that is, Cēsura Coloniensis, (which is not to be had in Englād,) and Canisius his greate Catechisme (which euery man may haue and reade:) M. Chark quoteth the page alwayes in Censura Coloniensis, whiche he is sure can not be seene: and concealeth the page cited lykewise by his Author in Canisius: for that hys reader turning to Canisius hys places, should fynde the falshoode bothe of M. Charke and hys Author. And Sometimes also, when Gotuisus dyd not belye the Iesuites sufficientlye: M. Charke without blushing will falsifie hys woordes, to make them more odious: as where Gotuisus hys woordes are, that the Iesuites saye the scripture is as it vvere a nose of vvax:

                M. Chark sayeth, their woordes are, the scripture is a nose of vvaxe. Infinite such things you shall fynde in the treatyse foloweing: whiche proueth manifestlye that point wherof I spake before: to wytt, that M. Charke is a man of no synceritie in matters of controuersie: but purposelye bent, bothe wittinglie and willinglie, by all meanes possible to deceyue. And thus much (M. Chark) concerning your writing.
            As for your other behauyour towardes M. Campian



in the Tower of London, & els where: I mean not greatlie to stand vpon: It was suche as myght be looked for at a mans handes of your makyng, or degree The Censure somewhat noted your inciuilitie in woords, which you had vttered agaynst hym before in your booke. But that was nothing to the contemptuous vsage of so learned a man in open audiēce, with barbarours threatenyng of that further crueltie, whiche then you had in mynde, and nowe haue putt in execution vppon hym. But aboue all other things, that was most ridiculous, and fytt for a-stage, whiche you thought was excellent, and became you vvell: and that vvas your often turning to the people & requesting them to reioyse, & thank the Lord, that he had gyuen you suche an argument agaynst the papistes, as novve you had to propose

Charke) caused the dores to be shutt, and no man to be lett owt, vntill with one consent, they had ioyned with you in prayer to thanke the lorde for your victorie that daye gotten vppon M. Campian.
            
            O M. Chark, how greedie are you of a litle vainglorie? and how vayne are the wayes by which you seeke yt? thynke you that men haue no Iudgement in the woorld abrode? Trow ye not that many smylde in their sleeues to beholde this hypocrisie? no, no, yf you had parted with M. Campian, but at an euen hand: as you ioyned with hym, with all inequalitie: we should haue

And vvhat then vvolde you and your bretheren haue done abovvt these disputations vvith M. Campian, yf you had thought yt any vvaye able to abyde the vevve?

All this you knovve, and the vvorlde bothe knovveth and meruaileth at yt abrode. Mary vve meruayle not, vvhoe know your purses. For that vve are sure, and dare auowe to your faces, that you vvill neuer deale vvith vs at euen hand, or vpō equall conditions, vvhile you lyue.
            And heere (M. Charke) because we are now fallen into this matter: I am in the name of all my felow Catholiques to renew our publike chalenge of equall disputation to you, and to all your brother ministers agayne. You see M. Campian is gone, whome you named in this matter our onelye Champion. You see also that M. Sherwyn is made awaye with hym, whome you are wont to saye (for more abasement of the other) to haue bene farre better learned than M. Campian hym selfe. But how soeuer that was, bothe of them haue you dispatched, and therby (in your opinion) greatly weakned our cause. Yet notwithstanding we are the same men that we were before: yea muche more desirous of this tryall than before. VVherfore, we request you now at length, yea we coniure you, either for trueth sake, yf you seeke yt: or for your ovvne credites sake, yf ye will retayne it: that you yeald vs after so muche sute and supplication, some equall triall, eyther by writing,



preaching, or disputing. There is no reasō in the worlde (but onelie feare) that may moue you to denye vs this our request. For the reason [of state] which you alleage (M. Charke) in your replye is most vayne. For what can a peaceable disputation graunted vs for religion, indaunger your state: but onelie (that you wold saye) that this disputation may chaunce to discouer your errors, and so make the hearers deteste your state of heresie? For other daunger there can be none to your state. And yf you had the trueth with you (as you pretend) whose propertie is, the more to shew her selfe, the more she is examined: you should muche increase your state, by this publike tryall. For that you shoulde bothe gayne more to your parte
                  •
                by opennyng the sayd trueth: and also confirme many of your owne syde, that now iustlye doe wauer vpon this open discouerie of your feare in tryall.
            VVherfore once againe I saye vnto you ministers: obtaine vs this disputation, thoughe it be onelie but for a shevv, therby to hold & maintaine your credites. VVe protest before God, that vve seek it onelie for the triall of Christ his trueth: for searche vvherof vve offer our selues to this labour, charges, & perill of lyfe. VVe aske for our safties, but onelie such a vvarrant from her Maiestie, as the late Councell of Trent dyd offer vnto all the protestāts of the wolrd: wherof you haue the copie vvith you. VVee will come in what kynde & number, at what tyme, to what place you shall appoint. Yf you will haue your owne countrie mē: they are redie to come. Yf you will haue straungers to dispute in your vniuersities before the learned onely: there shall not want. For your selues, vve gyue you leaue to call all the learned protestants of Europ for your defence. VVe will take onelie our owne countrie men, yf you permitt vs. VVe gyue you leaue to oppose or defende: to appoint questiōs: to chuse owt controuersies: to begynne or end at your pleasure: and to vse any other prerogatyues that you please: so that they impugne not the indifferencie of tryall. VVhat can yow alleage whye yow should not



accept this?
            If you had leuer make this triall in other countries, than at home before your owne people, as perhaps you had: chuse you what protestant state you lyst, and procure vs therin the forsayd saftie from the prince, and we will nether spare labour nor cost, to meet you therin also. Or yf this seeme hard, or lyke you not: then take you but the paynes, some number of you, to come into any Catholique kyngdome, or countrie, where you best please: And wee will procure what securitie soeuer reasonable you shall demaund for your persons: And more then that, we will beare your expenses also, rather than so good a woorke shall remayne vnattēpted. And yf you can deuyse any other conditiō to be performed on our partes, whiche I haue left owt: doe you adde the same: and we will agree (by the grace of God) to fullfill it. If we offer you reason: than deale somewhat reasonablie with vs againe. For all the world will crye shame, and begynne to discredit you, yf you will nether gyue nor take, vpon so great oddes as heere are offered you. If you dare not venture with disputatiōs: yet graunt vs certaine sermons, to encounter with you vpon this matter. Or yf that also be to daungerous: procure vs but a litle passage for our bookes: at leastwyse you (M. Charke) shall doe an honorable acte, to obtayne licence of free passage for this booke, vntill it be answered by you, to the end that men hauinge reade this ouer, may be the better able to conceyue your answer, when it comethe.

            THE ANSVVERE TO THE PREFACE TOVCHINGE DISCERNINGE of Spirites.
            
               MAister Charke besides the matter in question, maketh a praeface to the reader, touching the vtilitie, necessitie, and waye of tryeing spirites: alleginge the woordes of S. Iohn, whereby we are willed not to beleeue euerie spirite, 1. Iohn. 4. but to trie the spirites whether they be of God. VVhich (he saythe) he and his felowes offer to doe: and we refuse. But that this is clearlie false, and a formall speche onelie, withoute trueth or substance: our dedes doe testifie: which are alwayes (with indifferent men) as good as woordes. Our bookes are extant, whereby we haue called to tryall all sectaries of our tyme, as they rose vpp, and shewed new spirites: as Luther, Corolostad, Swinglius, Munster, Stankarus: and Caluin, whome our aduersaries folow as one of the last. And nowe in England, yf we had not bene willing or rather desirouse of this triall of spirites: we wolde neuer haue laboured so muche to obtayne the same of our aduersaries, 
                  VVhiche parte more desirethe triall of spirites.
                in free printing, preaching, or disputatiō: & much lesse wolde we haue aduentured our liues in comming and offering the same to thē at home, with so vnequall conditiōs on our syde, as we haue done, and doe dayly, for the triall of truthe. And yf all these our offers and endeuours, ioyned with so many petitions and supplications for triall, haue obtained vs nothing hitherto, but offence, accusations, extreme rackings, and cruell deathe: me thinke M. Charke had litle cause to make this preface of our refusing triall, and their offering the same: except it were onelye for lacke of other matter, and to kepe the custome of sayeing somewhat in the beginning.
            But perhappes M. Charke will saye, that althoughe we offer triall, yet not suche, nor by suche meanes, as in



his opinion is lawfull, sure and conuenient. VVhen we come to the cōbate: then remayneth it to be examined, whiche parte doeth alleage best meanes: whiche shalbe the argument of this my answer to this preface. 
                  VVho doe offer best meanes of tryall.
                And I will endeuour to shew, that all the meanes of tryall which M. Chark & his felowes will seme to allow in woord, (for they offer none in deede) are neyther sure, possible, nor euident: but onelie meere shyftes to auoyde all triall: and that we (on the cōtrary parte,) doe not onelie allow, but allso offer, all the best and surest wayes of tryall that euer were vsed in Gods churche, for discerning an hereticall spirit from a Catholique.
            The onelie meanes of tryall whiche M. Chark will seme to allow, 
                  Onely scripture.
                is the scripture: wherto onelie he wolde haue all triall referred: and that which can not be tryed therehence by hym, must stand vntryed. And then, as yf we refused all tryall of scripture, he vseth his pleasure in speche against vs. But this is a shyft common to all suche as M. Chark is. And the cause thereof I will declare immediatlye. 
                  Li. 2. de nu. & concup. ca. 31. & li. 3. cont. don. cap. 15. S. Augustin dothe testifye it of the heretiques of his tyme. And all the sectaries of our dayes doe make it plaine by experience, referring thē selues in woordes eche one to the holie scripture onelie, for maintenance 
                  •
               f there errours, and denyeing all other meanes of tryall, whereby the true meaning of scripture may be knowen.
            The causes of this shyft in all new teachers are principally three. 
                  Three causes of appealinge onelie to scripture
                The first, to gett credit with the people by naming of scripture, and to seme to honour it more than their aduersaries doe, by referring the whole triall of matters vnto it. The second is by excluding councels, fathers, and auncitours of the churche, (who from tyme to time haue declared the true sense of scripture vnto vs,) to reserue vnto them selues libertie, and authoritie to make what meaning of Scripture they please, and thereby to gyue colour to euerye fansie they list to teache. The third cause is, that by chalenging of onelie scripture, they may delyuer them selues from all ordinances or doctrines left vnto vs by the



first pillers of Christe his Church, thoughe not expresselie sett downe in scripture: & thereby assume authoritie of allowinge or not allowing, of comptrolling or permittinge, what soeuer liketh or serueth their turnes for the tyme. So, Martin Luther after he had denied all testimonie of man, besides hym selfe, he beginneth thus aboute the number of Sacramentes: 
                  De captiui. Babilon. in initio.
                
               Principio neganda mihi sunt septem sacramenta, & tantùm tria pro tempore ponenda. First of all I must denye seuen sacraments, and appoint three for the tyme. Marie this tyme lasted not long: for in the same place he sayeth, that yf he wold speake according to the vse of onelie scripture, he hathe but one sacrament for vs: 
                  Cap. de Sacram.
                that is, baptisme. But yet the confessiō of Auspurge, whiche pretendeth to folow Luther in all things, 
                  In aeditio. vlt. loc. cō.
                doeth allowe three, by onelye scripture. Mary Melancthon (whiche professeth onelye scripture more than the rest, and wolde seme to knowe Luthers meaning best of all men, for that he lyued with hym) holdeth fower, 
                  In institut.
                by onelye scripture: and Iohn Caluin holdeth two.
            
               
                  Com. in Amos.
               Agayne, by onelie scripture Iohn Caluin fownd the title, of heade of the church, in king henry, to be Antichristiā, vvhich novve, our folovvers of Caluin in England doe finde by onelie scripture to be most christian. 
                  Vide Ench. Eck. & Luth. cont. latom. de incendiariis.
                Mary yet the Magdeburgians by onelie scripture do condēne the same still. In like sorte, by onelie scripture the protestantes defended a greate while against Catholiques, that no heretiques might be burned, or put to deathe, whereof large bookes were written on bothe partes. But now our protestants in England,

                hauinge burned some them selues, haue fownd (as they write) that it is euident by scripture that they may be burned. Luther by onelie scripture, found that his folowers, and the Sacramentaries coulde not both be saued together: and therefore he condemned the one for arrant heretiques. Doctor fulke findeth by the same scripture, that bothe partes are good Catholiques, & neyther of them heretiques. Finallie, how many things doeth M. VVhittgift defend against T. Cartwright to be laufull by scripture

For by this a man maketh hym selfe Iudge, and Censurer, not onelie of all fathers, doctors, councels, histories, examples, presidents, customes, vsages, prescriptions and the like: but also of the bookes of scripture, and sense it selfe, reseruing all interpretation vnto hym selfe. But Catholiques, albeit they gyue the soueraigntie to scripture in all things: yet bindinge thē selues to other things beside, for the better vnderstanding of the meaning of scripture, (as to councels, auncient fathers, tradition of the Apostles, and primatiue churche, with the lyke) are restrained from this libertie of chopping and chaunging, affirming and denyeinge, allowinge and misliking at theyr pleasures. For albeit they hauing wittes as other men haue, might drawe some problable apparāce of scriptures to theyr owne deuises, as euery heretique hitherto hathe done: yet, the auncient interpretation of holie fathers, and receiued consent of the churche not alloweing the same, it wold preuaile nothing. Mary the selfe-willed heretique,

                that reiecteth all things but scripture, and therein alloweth nothing but his owne exposition, may runne and range, and deuise opinions at his pleasure: for he is sure neuer to be conuicted thereof, allowinge no man to be iudge of his interpretation, but onelye hym selfe, or some of hys owne opinion. This we see fullfilled in all heretiques, and sectaries that now lyue: whome it is vnpossible so to conuince by onelye scriptures, but they will alwayes haue some probable shew, whereby to defend them selues and theyr owne imaginatiōs. M. Charke therfore chanting so muche vpon this point of onelie scriptures, treadeth the pathe of his forefathers, and pleadeth for a pryuilege of ease: which whether we will allovve hym or no, he entreth vpon it, of his ovvne authoritie, and dravveth scrip

The rule is this: 1. Iohn. 4.

                  Tom. 7. vvittemb. Fol. 414. Martin Luther interpreteth this place to be vnderstoode of M. Charke and his felowes: sayeinge, That spirit is not of god but of Antichriste vvhich dissolueth Christs fleshe in the sacrament. But to vs Catholiques how can it be by anie deuise wrested, who neyther denye Christe to haue come in fleshe, nor yet do dissolue the name of Iesus, by anie doctrine of ours? But yet, Marke how M. Charke interpreteth this place: and cōfesse, that he hathe a singular grace in abusing scripture.
            
               
                  M. Charks grace ī interpretinge scriptures.
               
               VVhat soeuer spirit (sayeth he) shall confesse Christe to haue come in fleshe as a prophet, alone to teache (as papistes doe not, teaching traditions besides the vvritten vvoorde:) also, as a kinge alone to rule (as papistes doe not, defending the popes authoritie:) also, as a preest, alone to sanctifye (as papistes doe not, vpholding the Masse:) this spirit is of God, and the other of Antichriste. Is it maruaile yf these men build what they list vppon scripture, when they can fovvnde so many absurdities vppon one sentence thereof? I wolde here aske first, whether M. Chark thinketh that vve exclude Christe, vvhen vve allovve



prophetes to teache vnder hym kinges to raigne vnder hym, preests to sanctifie vnder hym, or no? If he thinke we exclude Christe: he is to fond to reason against sensible men, knowing not what they holde. But yf he thinke we allowe prophets, kings, and preests vnder Christe onelie, and in hys name: how can he call this the spirit of Antichrist? doe not the scriptures allowe Prophets and teachers vnder Christe in the churche? Ephes. 4. Act. 5? Also kinges and rulers (thoughe puritanes wolde haue none) 1. Pet. 2. Act. 2? Also may not preestes sanctifie by the woord of God. 2. Timo. 4? How then are these things accompted Antichristian? doe not protestants teache the same? what deepe Mysteries of puritanisme are these,

            Againe, I aske what doe the traditions of Christe and his Apostles (for of those onelie we talke when we compare them with scripture) impeache the teaching of Christe and his Apostles? what doeth the spirituall authoritie of the pope vnder Christe, diminishe the kinglie power, and authoritie of Christe? how doeth the preesthode of mē as from Christe, or the sacrifice of the Aultar instituted by Christe, disgrace Christs presthoode, or his sufficiēt sacrifice ones for all offered on the crosse? There is noted in the Margent, the epistle to the Hebrewes, Heb. 7. & 9. where it is saied: that, that sacrifice on the crosse was ones offered for euer for oure redēptiō. VVhiche we bothe graunt and teache in that manner as then it was done: but yet that impeacheth nothing this dayly sacrifice of ours, whiche must be in the churche vntill the end of the woorde, (as Daniel prophecyed, Dan. 12.) and that in euerie place amongest the Gentiles: (that is, in all the worlde) is Malachie fore-tolde,

to the hebrewes: whom, & other his like yf M. Chark & his felowes wolde not disdaine to reade & beleeue: they wold be a shamed to cauill, and blaspheme gods mysteries as they doe. But for a large and full answere of this common obiection of theirs, owte of the epistle to the hebrewes, towching Christe once bloodilie offered for all: I referre the reader, amōges many other, to certayne particular auncient and learned fathers, of the primatiue churche; whoe doe handle this obiection, and answere it of purpose. In ca 8 ep. ad Hebr. The one is Theodoret byshop of Cyrus, whoe handleth this question: vvhie Christians doe novv vse to sacrifice in the nevv testament, seing the olde lavv vvith all sacrifices vvere abolished, by the one sacrifice of Christe? 
                  Ep. 23. ad Bonif. The other is S. Augustin, whoe proposeth this dowbt: hovv vve sacrifice Christe euery daye vpon the Aultar, seing he is sayd to be sacrificed once for all vpon the crosse? And then he answereth it, bothe fullie and largelie, in that sense as I haue sayd before: So that this obiection was a cómon thing in the primatiue churche, and commōlie answered by euery writer, which M. Chark & his felowes do make so much a doe abowt now, crieing owt that we denie the vertue of Christes passion, the effects of his offices, and the like. See the same answered also by Eusebius, li. 1. demonst. euang. cap. 6. and 10. And by Theophilact. in cap. 5. ad hebr.
            And so, hauing answered now the substance of all that which M. Chark hathe in his preface, The aduersarie admitteth no triall. I might here make an end, but that I haue promised to shew how we offer hym and his felows moste reasonnable meanes of triall, and that they in deede admitt none at all. For what is it to name scripture in woordes, when all thee controuersie is about the sense thereof, wherein they admit no Iudge but them selues? yf we bring scripture neuer so playne, yet will they shift it of, with some impartinent interpretation: And what remedie or further triall haue we then? I will gyue an example or two for instruction of the reader in their procedings. The most of the auncient fathers wrote books in prayse of virginitie aboue wedlocke, & vsed to proue it by the sayeing



of Christe: Math. 19. 
               There be Eunuches vvhiche haue gelded them selues for the kingdome of heauen, he that can take it, let hym take it. Also by the woordes of S. Paul: 1. Cor. 7. 
               he that ioynethe his virgine in mariage dothe vvell, and hee that ioynethe her not, dothe better. VVhiche woordes being alleaged against Martyn Luther, Lib. de votis Monast. in initio. whoe preferred mariage (yea though it were of a vowed Nunne) before virgnitie: he answered it thus: that Christ by his woordes terrified men from virginitie and continence, and S. Paul by this speche dyd diswade them from the same. Now what could be replied in this case trow you?
            An other exāple may be towching S. Iohn Baptist: 
                  Of S. Iohn Baptist. Lu. 1. & 3. Math. 3. Marc. 1. of whome the scripture sayth, first, concerning his place of liuinge, that he vvas in the vvildernesse vntill the day of his appearing to Israel. Secōdlie, touching his apparell: Iohn vvas appareled vvith the heares of Camels. Thyrdlie, touching his diet: his meate vvas locustes and vvilde honie. Of whiche three things, the olde fathers of the primatiue Church dyd gather a great and singular austeritie of S. Iohns lyfe, and doe affirme with all, that Eremits and Monkes, and other religious people did take their paterne of straite lyuing from hym. Cent. 5 c. 6. pag. 711. For whiche cause S. Chrisostome dothe often call S. Iohn Baptist Monachum, & principem vitae monastice: a monke, and prince of Monasticall lyfe: whiche protestants being not able to abyde, doe rage maruailouslie against S. Chrisostome: condemning hym of rashenes and falsehode, for vsinge those termes, wherefore they fall to interpret the alleaged woordes of scripture farre otherwise, sayeinge: that by the desert wherein he liued vntill he began to preache, is vnderstoode nothing els,  Sarcer. in ca. 1. Lu. & mag. Cent. 1 li. 1. ca. 20., but his priuate lyfe at home in his fathers ovvne hovvse. And for his apparell (say they) of Camels heare, it was not straunge apparell, but vsual to Mountain men, 
                  Mariorat. in ca. 3. Math.
                  Cytraeits in ca. 3. Math. COSMIOS. EVPORISTOS.

                sayeth another:) VVater chamblet, hansome, and decent, albeit somvvhat plentifull in that countrie. And lastlie, touchinge his dyet of locusts and wilde hony: it was no hard fare, (say they) for the locustes were creuises, Ma. C
                     •
                  
                  ̄. 1. l. 1. c. 4. et 6 cast awaye by the fishers of Iordan, as vncleane by the lawe, but eaten of



Iohn, by the libertie of the Gospell. And the wilde hony was no vnpleasant thing as the fathers doe imagin: In cap. 1. Math. but it was (say Cossius and Strigelius) that pleasant Manna whiche Apothecaires vse to kepe in their shoppes: In cap. 1. Marc. So that, accordinge to these men, all that austeritie of lyfe, whiche the scriptures so particularlie doe recounte, & all antiquitie doeth wounder at, in S. Iohn Baptist, cometh but to this: that he was brought vp priuatelie in his fathers house, cladde in chāblette, & fedde with creuisses & swete Manna. VVhat great hardnesse was this?
            A thyrd example may be aboute the controuersie of reall presence in the sacrament: for whiche we bring plaine woordes of scripture, oute of fower diuerse places of the new testament, Mat. 26. Marc. 14. Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 11. where the same woordes are repeated withoute exposition or alteration: to witt, hoc est corpus meum: this is my bodie: VVhiche woordes dyd seme so playne and cleare for the reall presence of Christe in the sacrament, to all antiquitie: as no man might without great offence, doubt thereof, as the woords of S. Ambro. Lib. 4. de sacram. c. 5, & S. Ciril. Catach. 4, are. And (as the same Ciril. Li. 4. in Io. cap. 13. In Ancorano., in an other place proueth at large) to aske onelye quomodo how it may be, is the parte of an vnbeleuinge Iewe: seinge God was able (as he sayeth) as well to doe this, as to turne the rodde of Moyses into a serpent. To whiche purpose allso holy Epiphanius sayeth, that albeit the hoost seme to vs of a rounde forme & insēsible: yet who soeuer beleeueth it not to be the verie true bodie of Christe, seing he hathe sayd it is: excidit a gratia & salute. 
               Ho. 83. in Math. & 60. ad pop. Antioch. Suche a one is fallen from grace, and saluation. And S. Chrisostom sayeth, we must not beleeue sense and reason in this matter. Sed quoniam ille dixit, hoc est corpus meum, credamus, etiamsi sensui absurdum esse videatur. But because Christ hathe sayed this is my bodye, we must bele
                  •
               ue it, although it seme absurd to our sense: Hom. 24. in epist. ad Cor. 
               Hoc idem corpus cruentatum, lancea vulneratum, & quod in caelum extulit. This is the very same bodie, vvhose bloode vvas shed, and vvhiche vvas vvounded vvith the speare, and vvhiche he caried vpp vvith hym to heauen. All whiche notwithstandinge, oure aduersaries haue founde out a



new exposition of these woordes, thys is my bodye, affirming, that it must be construed, this is onelie the signe of my bodie. For the whiche construction, as they haue neither scripture, nor auncient father for theyr warrāt or example: so agree they not amongest them selues of this exposition. For Luther in his tyme, numbreth vpp eight dyuerse and contrarie expositions of Sacramentaries vppon these woordes, 
                  
                     In confess breui. tom. 2. germ. fol. 257.
                  
                     Claud de San. l. 1. rep. 1. de Euch.
                  
                cōming from eight diuerse spirits of the deuyll, as he affirmeth. And a learned byshop of our time hathe gathered 84. gyuen by diuerse sacramentaries vppon the same: So that, once goe oute of the highe waye, and there is no ende of erringe.
            And because I haue here made mention of Doctor Luther, a man by M. Charks opinion, illuminated singularlie by the holye ghost, and compared to Elias by the common phrase of all protestants: I will repeate here what he had reuealed to hym by hys holy spirit touchinge this interpretation of M. Charke and his felowes.
            First, he writteth thus to the protestants: 
                  The letter beginneth thus: Charissimis in Christo ami cis & Christianis Argentinae.
                that is, to the true Christians, as he calleth them, of Argentina: 
                  
                     This vvas an honest man in the meane space, vvhiche laboured to peruert this sacrament, thereby to hurt the pope.
                  
                  
                     Luthers latin vvoords are, ex capi 
                           •
                        e vertiginoso confictis.
                  
               
               Hoc diffiteri nec possum, nec volo, si Corolostadius &c. This can I not, nor vvill deny, but yf Corolostadius, or anie man els could for this fyue yeres, haue persuaded me, that there had bene nothinge in the sacrament but bread and vvine: he should haue bound me to hym by a great good turne. For I haue takē great care and anxietie in discussinge this matter, and haue endeuoured vvith all my povver, & sinovves stretched ovvte, to rydde my selfe of the same. For I dyd vvell see, that by this thing I might hurt the pope more than in anie other matter. But I do see my selfe captiue, no vvay being left to escape. For the text of the gospel is too plaine and stronge, and suche as can not easelie be ouerthrovvne by any man, and muche lesse by vvoordes and gloses deuised by a phātasticall heade. For I my selfe (God forgyue me for it) am too prone to that par

                  e, so farre foorthe as I can perceyue the nature of my ovvne Adam.
            
            Agayne, the same prophet in an other place, after many most detestable woords vttered against M. Chark



and his parteners, sayeth thus: 
                  
                     Epis. a. I0. har
                           •

               his spiritibus credat doceri veritatem: si quem perire delectat &c. Lett hym beleue that these spirites doe teache the trueth, vvho deliteth to damne him selfe, vvhereas in dede they began not theyr doctrine, but by manifest lyes, and novv doe defend the same onelye by lyes, diuulging the same by corrupting other mens bookes, not vouchsafing to heare the anguishes of our consciences, vuhich crie, & saye, the vvoordes of Christ are cleare and manifest: Mat. 26. 
               eate, this is my bodye. And againe, in a certayne treatise intituled 
                  Tom. 7. vvittemb. page 380. 
               against the phanaticall Spirits of sacramētaries: He sayeth, talking of this interpretation of the woords: This is my bodye: Age ergo quando adeo sunt impudentes &c. Goe to then, seing they are so impudent, therfore I vvill geue them a Lutheran exhortation: accursed 
               
                  
                     A Lutheran exhortation.
                  
                  
                     O pleasant Martin.
                  
               
               be their charitie and concorde for euer and euer. And after cōming to the expositiō of the sayde woordes he sayeth thus. Doctor Carolostad vvresteth miserablie this pronoune (this:) Svvinglius maketh leane this verbe (is:) Oecolampadius tormenteth this vvorde (bodye:) other doe boucher the vvhole text: and some doe crucifie but the halfe thereof: so manifestlie doeth the deuyll holde vs by the noses. And agayne in the same worke: he hathe these wordes. To expound the vvordes of Christ as the sacramentaries doe, (this is the signe of my bodie:) is as absurd an exposition, as if a man shoulde interprete the scripture thus. In the beginning God made heauē & earthe, 
               
                  Gen. 1.
                  
                     Currucam cū ossibus.
                  
               
that is, the Cuckovve dyd eate vp the Titling or hedge Sparrovv, together vvith her bones Again, in S. Iohn: Iohn. 1. 
               And the vvoorde vvas made fleshe that is, a croked staffe vvas made a kyte. This was the opinion of holy Luther towching our aduersaries interpretatiō, or rather euasion, and shift: whiche I haue alleaged somewhat more at large against M. Chark, for that he esteemeth and defendeth the man, as a rare instrument of the holy ghoste. VVhich yf it be true: then woe to M Charke and his comparteners, whose spirit is so contrarye to this mans holy illumination.
            By this now it appeareth, that the controuersie is not betwene vs, whiche part prouoketh to scripture, & which doeth not: but (as it hathe allwayes bene betwixt heretiques and Catholiques) which part alleageth true



meaning of Scripture: whiche thing accordinge to the councell of wise Sisinius to Theodosius the Emperour, 
                  Socrat. li. 5. hist. ca. 10. we desire to be tried by the Iudgement of auncient fathers, indifferent in this matter, for that they lyued before our cōtrouersies came in question. But our aduersaries will allow no exposition but theyr owne: whereby it is easie to defeate what soeuer is brought against them ether scripture or doctour.
            For examples sake, 
                  Examples of shifting scriptures and doctours.
                to proue that we may lawfullie make vowes, & are boūd also to perform the same being made: we alleage the plaine woordes of the prophet: vouete & reddite domino: vowe ye and rēder your vowes to god: how will the aduersarie auoyde this, think you? M. Fulke answereth: Psal. 75. Against the rocke. pag. 153. 
               this text belongeth onelye to the olde testament. But what may not be wiped awaye from vs that lyue vnder the new testament by suche interpretations? Again, to proue that there is some state of lyfe of more perfectiō in Christianitie than other, we alleage the cleare saying of Christe: Math. 19. 
               Si vis perfectus esse, vade, vende quae habes, & da pauperibus, & habebis thesaurum in caelo, & veni, sequere me: Yf thow wilt be perfect, goe, sell all thow hast, and gyue to the poore, and thow shalt haue a treasure in heauen, and come, folowe me. VVhat answer haue they trow you to this? M. Fulke answereth: 
                  Against the rock. pag. 154. 
               this vvas spoken onelie as a singular triall to that yong man alone, and not to others beside hym. VVhat a deuise is this? May not he as well say also, that the other woordes immediatelie going before, were onlie spokē to this yong man: to witt, Si vis ad vitam ingredi serua mandata: yf thow wilt be saued, kepe the cōmaundements: and so deliuer all his gospellers from the burden thereof? what differēce is there in these two speches of Christe, seing they are bothe spoken to that yong man, and bothe in the singular number, as infinite other things of the Gospell are to other particular persones, as to the Cananaea, to the Adulteresse, to Nichodemus, to the Cēturio, to Zachaeus, to the blynde, deafe and others, which notwithstanding are common to all, in that they touche eyther lyfe or doctrine?
            
               The like absurd shiftes I might repeate in a hundred other points. VVhat can be more plaine than the woordes of scripture: Iacob. 2. 
               videtis quoniam ex operibus iustificatur homo, & non ex fide tantum? Doe you see how that a man is iustified by woorks and not by fayth onelie? But yet it auayleth nothing. VVhy so? they auoyde it by interpretation. S. Iames (say they) vnderstandeth of Iustification before men, and not before God. 
               D. Fulke loco citato.
                O poore deuise: S. Iames hathe in the same place, (talking of fayth without woorkes:) Nunquid poterit fides saluare eum? Can faythe without woorks saue him? doeth S. Iames meane here of saluation before men, or before God? Again, whē S Paul sayeth, Rom. 2. 
               factores legis iustificabuntur: the doers of the lawe shall be iustyfied: whiche is the verie same thing that S. Iames in other woordes sayeth, that mē shalbe iustified allso by woorks: Doeth S. Paul mean before men or before God? Yf you say, before mē: the text is against you, which hath expressely, apud deum, before God. The like euasiō they haue whē we alleage the woords of S. Paul: 1. Cor. 7. 
               qui matrimonio iungit virginem suam, benè facit: & qui non iungit, melius facit: he that ioyneth his virgin in mariage doeth well: and he that ioyneth her not doethe better. VVhereof vve inferre, that virginitie is more acceptable, & meritoriouse before God, than mariage, allthough mariage be holie. No (say our aduersaries) S. Paul meaneth onelye, that he doeth better before men, and in respect of vvorldlie commodities, but not before God. But this is absurd: for they graunt the former parte of the sentence (he that ioyneth his virgin doeth vvel) to be vnderstoode before God: for that it is sayde also in other vvoordes, non peccat, he doeth not sinne: whiche must nedes be vnderstoode in respect of God. How thē can they denie the second clause, (and he that ioyneth her not, doeth better) not to be vnderstoode in respect of God also, and in respect of merit and rewarde in the lyfe to come, especiallie whereas Christ promiseth the same rewarde to virginitie in an other place, where he sayeth, Math. 19. 
               there be Eunuches vvhich haue gelded them selues for the kingdome of heauen, he that can take it, lett hym take it?
            
            
               You maye see now by this litle (and I might shew by many mo examples) howe bootelesse it is to bring scripture, when we agree not vpon the interpretation. 
                  Hovv protestantes deny all fathers.
                VVhat then? shall we bring the auncient fathers and doctors of the primatiue church, for the vnderstanding of scripture? shall we interpret it as they doe? vnderstad it as they vnderstoode it? No, that our aduersaries will not agree vnto, but onelie in matters indifferent & owte of controuersie. VVhere soeuer in matters of controuersie betwene vs and them, the olde fathers doe make against them (as in all points they doe:) there will they denie their exposition. For example: The consent of auncient fathers (is alleaged against M. Fulke) attributing superioritie to Peter, vpon the woordes of Christ: Thovv art Peter, & vpon this rocke vvill I buyld my Church: Math: 16. but he auoydeth it verie lightlie, thus: It can not be denied but diuerse of the auncient fathers (othervvyse godlye and learned) vvere deceyued in opiniō of Peters prerogatiue. 
               
                  Against the rocke. pag. 242. S. Ambrose, Ierome, Chrisostom, Cyrill, and Theodoret are alleaged for expounding a pece of scripture against M. Fulk, Ioh. 5. abowt Antichrist. How doeth he shift it? thus: 
                  Against the roke. pag. 291. 
               I ansvver, they haue no ground of this exposition. S. Ierome with all the ecclesiasticall writers are alleaged for interpreting of the woords of Daniel cap. 7. against the protestants: Ibidem. M. Fulke, I ansvver, that neyther Ierome, nor anie ecclesiasticall vvriter vvhome he folovveth, hathe any direction out of the scripture for this interpretation. S. Austen is alleaged for interpreting Dauids woordes: he hathe placed his tabernacle in the Sunne: of the visibilitie of the churche: Fulke: Psal. 14. Against the fortresse pa. 52. Against purg. pag. 262. 
               Austen doeth vvrongfullie interpret this place. S. Ambrose, Ephraim, and Bede are alleaged for interpretatiō of certaine scriptures. Fulke: Gods vvoorde is so pitifullie vvrested by them, as euery man may see the holie ghoste neuer meant any suche thing. S. Chrisostome is alleaged for certaine interpretations of scripture: Fulke: 
                  Against purg. pag. 237. 
               he alleageth in dede scripture, but he applieth it madlie: and yet he often applieth it to the same purpose
                     •
                   alas good man. The consent of fathers is alleaged for interpretatiō of certaine places of scripture, of the prefiguration of the



crosse of Christ. Fulke: 
                  Against the crosse, pag. 146. 
               The fathers do rather dallie in trifeling allegories, than sovvndlie proue that the crosse vvas presigured in those places.
            
            I might here make vp a greate volume, yf I wolde prosecute this argumēt, to shew how these new doctors doe contemne & reiecte all authoritie, antiquitie, witt, learning, sanctitie of oure forefathers, 
                  Hovv protestantes reiect the interpretatiō of their ovvne vvriters
                & of all men (in effect) that euer liued beside them selues: yea, of their owne new doctors and maisters also, when they come to be cōtrarie to anie new deuise, or later fansie of theirs. This is euidēt in Luther reiected by his ofspring about the reall presence, number of sacraments, images, bookes of the Bible, order of seruice, and the like: LVTHER CALVINE Also in Caluine reiected about the head of the churche in England, and about all the gouernmēt thereof in Geneua. And I coulde alleage here diuerse examples where he and Beza bothe are reiected by name in diuerse points, bothe of puritanes and protestants in England, when they differ from them: but that this preface wold growe to be too long. VVherefore I maye perhaps (yf this booke come not otherwyse to be too greate) adde a short table or appendix in the end, to shew by examples the vnconstant dealings of our aduersaries herein, and that in verie dede, when all is done and sayd that may be, 
                  The final conclusion of protetestants for triall.
                and all excuses made that can be deuised: the verye conclusion is that, onelye that must be taken for truthe whiche pleaseth them last of all to agree vppon: and theyr bare woordes must be the proofe thereof. For those bookes onelie be scripture in the bible whiche they appoint: & in those bookes, that onelie is the true sense whiche they gyue out: the fathers erred in all things where they differ from them: the new doctors, (as Luther, Caluin, and the rest) sawe so much onelie, of the truthe, as they agree with them, and no further. This is the sayeing of our aduersaries: this is the saying of all the other sectaries of our time: this hathe bene the sayeinge of all heretiques from the beginninge: and this muste needes be the sayeinge of all heretiques for the time to come. For, except they take this waye: it is



vnpossible to stand or encrease against the Church. And by this way a man may beginne what heresie he will to morow next, and defend it against all the learning, witt, and trueth of Christendome. Adioyne now to this, that our aduersaries (notwithstanding all request sute, offer, or humble petition that we ca
                  •
                make) will come to no publique disputation, or other indifferent and lawfull iudgement: but doe persecute, imprison, torment, and slaughter them which offer the same: and then lett the reader iudge whether they desire & offer iust triall or no, 
                  •
                M. Charke affirmeth.
            Now for our partes (as I haue sayd) we offer vnto them, 
                  The varietie of triall. that Catholiques doe offer.
                all the best, surest, and easiest means that possiblie can be deuised, or that euer were vsed in Gods Church for triall of trueth, or discouering of heresie. For, as for the bookes of scripture, seing we must receyue them vpō the credit and authoritie of the auncient Church: 
                  Books of scripture.
                we are cōtent to accept for canonicall, and allow those, & none other, which antiquitie in Christendome hathe agreed vpon. Next, for the contents of scripture: 
                  Expresse-vvoordes.
                yf our aduersaries will stand vpon expresse and plaine woords hereof, we are content to agree therevnto, and we must needes be farre superiours therein. For what one expresse plaine text haue they in any one point or article against vs, which we doe not acknowleige literallie as they doe, & as the woordes doe lie? but we haue against them infinit, whiche they can not admit without gloses, and fond interpretations of their owne. For example sake, we haue it expreslie sayd to Pete

They haue no where, that the law required at Christiās hands is impossible, or, that the doing therof iustifieth not Christians. VVe haue expresselie, Vovv yee, and render your vovves, Psal. 75. 
                  Vovves.

VVe haue expresselie, doe ye the vvoorthie fruits of penaunce. Luc. 3.

                They haue no where, that faithe onelie is sufficient with out all satisfactiō, and all other woorkes of penaunce on our parts. VVe haue expresselie, that euerye man shalbe saued according, to his vvoorks, Apoc. 20. They haue no where that men shalbe Iudged onelie according to their faith. VVe haue expresselie, that there remaineth a retribution, stipend, and paye to euerie good vvoorke in heauen. Marc. 9. 1. Cor. 3. Apo. 22. Psal. 118. They haue no where that good woorkes done in Christ, doe merit nothinge. VVe haue expresselie,



               it is a holie cogitatiō to praye for the deade. 2. Machab. 12. 
                  Prayer for the deade.
                They haue no where, it is superstition or vnlawfull to doe the same. VVe haue an expresse example of a holy man that offered sacrifice for the dead. 2. Machab. 12. 
                  Sacrifice for the dead.
                They haue no example of any good man that euer reprehended it. VVe haue expresselie, that the affliction, whiche Daniel vsed vppon his bodie, was acceptable in the sight of God. Dan. 10. They haue no where, 
                  Voluntarie corporall afflictions.
                that suche voluntarie corporall afflictions are in vaine. VVe haue expresselie, that an Angel dyd presēt Tobias good woorkes, and almes deedes before God. Tob. 12. 
                  Almes.
                They haue no were, that Angels can not, or doe not the same. VVe reade expresselie, that Ieremias the p

                  rael. 2. Mach. 15. 
                  Prayer of sainctes.
                they haue no where the contrarye to this. I leaue manie thinges more that I might repeate. But this is enoughe (for example sake) to proue, that albeit our aduersaries doe vaunt of scripture: yet when it cometh to expresse woordes: they haue no text against vs in lieu of so manie as I haue here repeated against them: nor can they shew, that we are driuen to denie anie one booke of the Bible, nor to glose vppon the plaine woordes of anye one plaine place of scripture, as they are enforced to doe.
            But now yf they will not stand onelie to plaine and expresse woordes of scripture, 
                  Necessarie collections vpon scrippture.
                but also (as in dede they must) to necessarie collections made, and inferred of scripture: then muste we referre onr selues to the auncient primatiue church, for this meaning of Gods woord. For it is like they knew it best: for that they lyued nearer to the writers thereof (than we doe) whoe could well declare vnto them, what was the meaning of the same. And then our aduersaries well know, how the aunciēt fathers do ground purgatorie, prayer to saints, sacrifice of the Aultar, vse of the crosse, and other like points of our religion, (besides tradition) vpon the authoritie of scriptures, also expounded accordinge to their meaning: albeit oure aduersaries denie the same to be well expounded.
            
               If our aduersaries will yet goe further for the triall of our Spirits: we are well content, and we refuse none that euer antiquitie vsed for the triall of a Catholique and hereticall spirit. The olde heretiques Samosatenus, Arrius, Macedonius, Nestorius & Eutiches were tried and condēned by the councells of Antioche, Nice, Constantinople, and Chalcedon: 
                  Councells
                and other heretiques by other councelles since. VVe are content to referre our selues to all the Christian councells that euer haue bene sence Christ dyed. And all men knowe that the last moste learned godlie and generall councell of Trent was gathered for that purpose, & offered all safeconduct to our aduersaries to come thither to triall: but they refused it.

                     Li. 1. contra Iulian. c. 2.
               Besides this, the auncient fathers haue vsed diuerse times, diuerse other means of triall: As first, by referring the matter to the triall of olde doctors, which lyued before the cōtrouersies begāne. This meane vsed S. Austen against Iulian the pelagian, and produceth the consent of fathers, bothe of the east, and of the west Churche vntill his tyme: and there asketh hym, whoe he is that dareth to oppose hym selfe to the credit of these men: to call them blynde: to saye they were deceyued: where as they were the verie lights of the citie of God? The like waye dyd Theodosius the Emperour take by the counsaile of Sisinius, and suggestion of Nectarius, to bring the Arriās heresie to some ende, as Socrates writeth.

                     Li. 2. contra here.
                  
                And Epiphanius I sayethe, this is enough to say against all heresies: Ecclesia Catholica haec non doeuit: Sancti pa
                     •
                  res haec minimè receperunt. The Catholique Churche hathe not taught this, the holie fathers haue not admitted this. Now, how our aduersaries doe flie this means of triall, they are not ashamed to confesse it openlie.

               An other waie is to consider whiche is the Catholique or vniuersall Church, or great multitude of Christians, out of whiche the one part first departed. This way vsed S. Austen against diuerse heretiques, as namelie against the Manacheis, whē he sayeth: Multa sunt

                   that whiche hathe bene beleued in euerie place, allwayes, & of all Christiās &c. And this we shall doe, yf in oure beleefe we folow vniuersalitie, antiquitie, and cō
                  sent. VVe shall folow vniuersalitie, 
                     Vniuersalitie.
                   yf we confesse that onelie faith to be true, whiche the Churche spred ouer all the worlde doeth cōfesse: we shall folowe antiquitie, 
                     Antiquitie.
                   yf we depart not from that meaning and sense of scripture which is euident that our forefathers and auncestours haue held: we shall folow consent, 
                     Consent.
                   yf we embrace the definitions and opinions eyther of all, or of the moste parte of preestes and teachers in antiquitie. The like way doeth S. Ierome take against the Luciferians:
and other fathers against other heretiques. And howe quicquelie our aduersaries spirit were tried by this way of Antiquitie, vniuersalitie and consent, all men that haue vnderstanding may Iudge.
            An other way there is also, and muche vsed by the fathers against heretiques: and that is, 
                  Succession of Popes.
                to proue theyr religiō by the successiō of bishops in the See of Rome: wherein the successour alwayes, teaching the doctrine



of his predecessour, it must nedes be a strong argument to proue the descent and continuance of one and the same faithe from the Apostles time. 
                  
                     Contr. ep. fundam. cap. 4.
                  Iohn. 21.
                This argumēt vseth S. Austen in the place before alleaged:

                  Tenet ab ipsa sede Petri Apostoli, (cui pascendas oues post resurrectionem dominus commendauit) vsque ad praesentem episcopa
                        •
                     um successio sacerdotum. The succession of preests in the Churche of Rome euē from the chair of Peter (vnto whome our lorde after his resurrection commended his sheepe to be fedde) vnto this byshoprik that now is, doeth holde me in the Catholique Churche.
The same waye of triall he vseth, and muche more at large, in hys hundred three skore and fyueth epistle, where he reckoneth vpp all the byshopps of Rome from Peter vnto Anastasius (whiche was byshop in his tyme,) and thinketh this a good proofe against the donatists, that none of those held or fauoured theyr opinion. The lyke waye of triall vsed Optatus Mileuitanus against the same donatists before S. Austen, 
                  Li. 2. cont. Donatist.
                reckoning vp all the byshopps of Rome vntill SIRICIVS, that satte in his time. The same waye of triall vsed holy Irenaeus, 
                  Li. 3. cont. haer. cap. 3. before eyther of bothe these men, against the heretiques of his time, reckoninge vpp all the byshops of Rome, vntill Eleutherius that held the See in his time, addinge that by this succession, he dyd confovvnd the pride of all heretiques that durst to teache othervvise than this See had held.
And after, concluding thus: est plenissima haec ostensio, vnam & eandem viuificatricem fidem esse, quae in ecclesia ab Apostolis vsque nunc sit conseruata & tradita in veritate. 
               This ys a moste full proofe, that one & the selfe same quickninge faithe hathe bene deliuered in truthe, and commended from the Apostles vnto this day.
But now this way of triall I know oure aduersaries will not admitt.
            
               
                  Infection
                        •
                      vvith olde heresies.
               An other waye of triall is to examine what parte doeth holde anye olde cōdemned heresie. For as an heretique hauing once lost the habit of fayth gyuen hym in baptisme, is easily moued to cope with anye heresie new or olde that commeth in his waye, and serueth his turne: so moste certaine it is, that the true Catholique



churche can neuer admitt or defend any heresie. 1. Tim. 3. For otherwyse she coulde not be the pillar of trueth. And we beleeue with holie Athanasius in his creed: that he vvhich holdeth not the faythe vvholye in all points shall perish eternallie, howe soeuer our aduersaries doe salue the matter in theyr prophets Berengarius, Husse, VVikliffe, and Luther, whome they say to haue bene holie men, & yet to haue erred in diuers points of faithe, 
                  Marke this gentle reader.
                and to haue held theyr erreurs obstinatelie to the daye of theyr deathe. But wee beleue the contrarye, as I haue sayed. And therefore who soeuer could shew but one cōfessed heresie to be defended by our churche, there neded no more disputation about the matter.
            But now for the right vse of this way of triall, 
                  Tvvo conditions.
                there be two conditions to be obserued of his part whiche will obiect an olde heresie to an other. The first is, that the partie doe in dede holde that thinge whiche he obiecteth, and not a certaine likeliehoode of it. For that were to slaunder, and not to obiect. 
                  Iniurious dealinge of our aduersaries.
                As when oure aduersaries doe obiect to vs the heresie of Pelagius abowt free will, it is a mere slaunder. For we holde that mans will beinge preuented and holpen with the grace of God may woorke well: but he helde that it could do the same by the power and force of nature, without the helpe of gods grace, as S Augustin proueth at large in his booke of free will. The like iniurie they doe vs, in many other things, which they obiect against vs: as the heresie of those whiche dyd sacrifice to our ladie, and the like, whiche we doe not. The second condition is that the heresie obiected be in dede suche as was accompted and condemned for an heresie, in the primatiue churche, and not onelie that an heretique held it. For heretiques doe holde diuerse truethes alwayes together withe falsehode: And for lack of this condition doe our aduersaries often abuse the simple people. As M. Fulke oftentimes sayeth: prayer for the deade is an heresie, because the Montanists (which were heretiques) helde it. But lett hym proue that euer this was accompted one of Mōtanus hys heresies, & thē he proueth somewhat. But



that he can neuer doe: for he graūteth, Austen, Ambrose, Chrisostom, Ierom, and others 
                  •
               o haue vsed prayers for the deade, whoe notwitstanding were great enemies to Montanus, and all his errors. VVherefore this is a verie malitiouse kynde of abusing people. And I heere saye again, that lett hym and all the protestants in the worlde proue, that we doe holde in dede, but anie one thing, which was accōpted an heresie in the primatiue church, & we will graunt that we are not the Catholique Churche, but that in all other things we erre besides.
            
               
                  Protestantes doe holde olde heresies.
               But we in charging them vvithe heresies doe obserue allvvayes the foresayd tvvo conditions. As for example, vve charge them vvith the opinion of Aerius, vvhiche denied prayer for the dead: And that they holde this verie same opinion, they vvill not denie: And that it vvas accompted an heresie in the primatiue churche:

                     Against Brystoes motiues pa. 15.
               
vve alleage for vvitnesses S. Augustin and Epiphanius. Hovv doe they auoyde this? No vvaye, but by sayeinge that Augustin and Epiphanius vvere deceyued, in recording that for an heresie vvhiche vvas none: for that is M. Fulks answere: whiche is to condemne all that age: for that those holie fathers wrote downe heresies as they were taken in those dayes by the church. The lyke we doe about vigilantius: whose opinions were (among others) that Saints were not to be prayed to, nor their reliques to be honored: Now that the protestants hold this, no man dowteth: And that this was accompted heresie in the primatiue churche, 
                  Li. cont. vigilantium.
                we cite S. Ierome for a wittnesse which wrote against hym. VVhat shift is there here? None, but to deface S. Ierome and commend vigilantius, and to denie it to be an heresie: for so doeth, M. Fulke, 
                  Against the motiues. pa. 54. sayeing further, that Ierome rather raileth than reasoneth, and that vigilantius vvas a good man, and his opinion sovvnd. The like order we take in a nūber of other olde hereticall points, whiche we charge them withall: as may be sene in the tables and books sett owt of this matter. Now yf our aduersaries could bringe vs to anie suche confession of heresie, the matter were ended. But they can not: and therefore I know they will neuer admitt



this way of triall.
            The last way of triall (whereof I will speake at this time) is to consider the maners of olde heretiques, 
                  The manners of olde heretiques.
                & to compare the same with oures. And here I wolde haue also the former two conditions obserued: To witt, that we consider suche qualities onelie as were accompted hereticall in them: that is, proper to heretiques: and to examine them trulie withoute partiall affection in our selues. For example: 
                  Lib. 2. cont. lit. Petil. cap. 51. S. Augustin doeth note it as an hereticall propertie in the donatists to hate the See of Rome, and to call it cathedram pestilentiae, the chair of pestilence. Doeth this agree to protestants, or to vs? As also the defaming of the said See, sor the euell pretended lyfe of some particular men?

                As likewise he noteth it as an hereticall tricke in them, to persuade the people that the visible churche had erred, and oppressed the true churche, banishinge her from the sight of the worlde. Doe not our aduersaries say the verie same? Also he noteth the same heretiques for hatinge and condemninge the lyfe of monkes, as also for dravving Nonnes out of theyr cloysters, and ioyninge them selues vvith the same in pretended vvedlocke. Finallie he noteth it as hereticall in the Arriās, to appeale from traditions to onelie scripture. Now before S. Augustin, Optatus noted it as hereticall in the donatists to breake aultars vvherevpon the bodie and blood of Christ vvere kept, as the woordes of Optatus are. And about the same time Victor Vticensis wrote his storie against the vandall heretiques: where he setteth furthe moste liuelie the state of our time, by the maners and behauiours of those heretiques, in breakinge chalices: prophaning of holie Chrisme, spoylinge of churche vestimēts, throweing the blessed sacramēt of the aultar on the ground, with other moste horrible abuses to the same, not to be repeated: in prohibiting masse to be sayd by edicts and proclamation, and a hundred things moe: whiche are the verie exercises of our aduersaries now. The like things in many points doeth S. Basil obiect as sacrilegious against Iulian the Apostata and his folowers:

            A DEFENCE OF THE CENSVRE AGAYNST VVILLYAM Charke, minister.
            
               THE CENSVRE.
               
               
                  
                     THE PREFACE.
                   THERE came to my hands tvvo bookes of late, in ansvvere of M. Edmund Cā
                  piane his offer of disputation: the one vvryten by M. Hanmer, the other by M. Charke: of bothe vvhiche, (vnder correction,) I meane to gyue my shorte Censure, vntill such tyme as eyther he, to vvhome the matter appertayneth, or some other doe make more large and leardned replie: Aduertising notvvithstandinge the reader, that in myne opiniō, this offer of M. Campian, and so many other as haue bene made, required not so muche ansvvering in vvriting, but shorter triall in  disputation. But yet seinge there can be had nothinge from thē but vvoordes: I vvill examine a litle, vvhat they say at least to the matter.
            
            
               THE DEFENCE.
               HEERE, euen at the verie entrance, the replyer leeseth his patience, for that we require short triall in disputation. VVhoe is Campian (sayeth he) or vvhoe are  the rest of these seedmen, that they should presume to auovv
                        •
                     


                     
popishe religion, that hathe nothing to vpholde it but tyranie, nothing to defend it but lies, nothing to restore it but hipocrisie and rebellion? O M. Charke, remember your selfe. VVe now but begynne: you will be farre out ere we ende, yf you tread the first step with so much choler. Yf the verie naming of disputations make you sweate: what will the thing it selfe doe, yf it should be graunted? yow beganne verie hoote with M. Campian in the Tower, but his quiet behauyour cooled you with shame. He tooke at your hands reproches and iniuries, yea torments also, and death it selfe, with more patiēce, thā you can beare a moste reasonable and iust request But (say you) vvhat can they gett by renevveing the battaille, so often and so latelie refused by their fathers and captaines? and you note in the margent D. VVatson, & M. Fecknam. 
                     Intituled: a conference betvvene M. D. fulk, and the papists ī vvesoiche castell.
                   VVe know (M. Charke,) the foolish vaine pamphlet set fourth by D. Fulke in his owne commēdation, touching his being at wesbiche castle, and cōference with the learned & reuerend fathers, imprisoned there. But as they dyd wiselie in contemning his pride, cōming thither vpon vanitie, without warrant for that he offered: so beside the falsehode of that scrolle, discouered sence by letters from the parties thē selues, there is nothing in the same, that turneth not to your owne discredit: being confessed therein, that after you had depriued thē of all bookes, yea their verie writen note bookes, 
                     The maner of protestā
                        tes disputations.
                   (which to learned men are the store house of memorie:) you asked them whether they wold come to Camebrige to dispute or no, yf leaue peraduenture might be procured? And because they cōtēned so peart & cockishe a marchant, that for matter of glory, cam
                     •
                   to pose them without authoritie: therfore you publishe bothe in bookes and sermons, that these learned men refused disputatiō, where as, at the verie same tyme, and bothe before and sence, hothe we and they haue sued by all meanes possible, to be admitted to a lawfull, equall and free disputation, eyther in Cambrige or anie place els, that shall be appointed.
               VVhat dealing is this? what proceding M. Charke?



where are nowe the lies and hipocrisie you talked of? on which parte doe they appeare? As for tyrānie (being an odious woorde) I will saye nothing, nor will not turne it to you againe: let racking and quartering of those that offered disputation be accompted scholasticall reasonning with you. But this I must saye to yow ministers, for your good: that it were farre better, you confessed your feare in playne woordes, than so much to manifest it in dedes, and thereby to discredit the rest of your sayeings.
               
                   Next after the matter of disputation, M. Charke taketh an other thing in greefe, and that is, that the Censure should saye: seing there can be had nothing from them but vvoordes &c. And for hym selfe, he referreth men to his answer. But for M. Hanmer he answereth, that he hathe brought more reason with his woords, than may well be answered by me. But suppose all this were true, and that bothe his woordes and M. Hanmers also were reasonable woordes: yet are they but woordes in respect of the desired disputation, whiche is a deede. And so me thinke the Censure doeth offer them no iniurie. But how reasonable M. Charks woordes are, it appeared partlie by the Censure, and shall doe better by this defence. For M. Hanmer, of M. HANMER. as I thought hym then, not woorthie of particular answere: so much lesse doe I now, remayning worse satisfyed by his second booke than by his first. But yet, as I omitted hym not in the Censure when occasion was offered: so will I not in this defence: allthough finallie I must confesse, that albeit I am not willing to increase a proude humour where alredie it doeth abounde: yet doe I attribute more to M. Chark, than to hym, for some discretion in answering to the purpose.
               But, for that M. Charke will needes so frendelie take vpon hym the avouchement of M. Hanmers doeinges, as thoughe he had not enoughe to defend his owne: I will oute of a heape of foolerie & falsehoode, (pached together by M. Hanmer, after the fashion of their sermōs) alleage a few things: requiring M. Charke



in his next wryting, to answere for the same. And yf he fynde it somewhat hard: Lett hym blame his owne tongue, for medling in matters whiche he might haue auoyded. Nether will I touche any thing now, mentioned before in the Censure, for that these thinges shall haue their owne place to be discussed after. Now purpose I onelie to note a fewe pointes of many, 
                     
                        Intituled an ansvvere to a Iesuites chalenge.
                     
                     In 2. thes. 2
                   which shall declare sufficientlie the mans constitution. He hathe in his first book fol. 12. That lyra sayeth: Ab ecclesia romana, iam diu est quòd recessit gratia: VVhiche he interpreteth thus: It is long sythence the grace of God is departed from the churche of Rome. VVhereas the woordes are Graecia, Greece, and not grace, signifyeinge, that the Greeke churche was long since departed from obedience of the churche of Rome. How will you excuse this M. Charke? For suppose there were anie corrupte booke that had (by error) Gratia, for Graecia (whiche I may scarse imagin:) But yet to help hym to an excuse, suppose it should be so:
yet lyra his whole discourse vppon S. Pauls woordes, 2. Thes. 2. 
                     nisi venerit discessio primum: Except a reuolte be first made, the ende of the worlde shall not come:
with all the circumstances, and other examples there alleaged of the Romans empire, must nedes haue shewed hym (yf he haue sense,) that he talked onelie of the countrie of Grece, and not of the grace of God.
               
                  
                     Intituled the Iesuites Banner. A fovvle lye.
                  In this second assertion of his second booke, he attributeth this sentence to the Iesuites: All and euery the things contained in holie scripture are so vvrapped in obscurities, that the best learned can gather thence no certain knovvleige. This is impudent. For they haue the plaine contrarie in the verye places by hym cited to witt, that not all, but some places, are hard in scripture: as is to be seene in Payuas Andrad. li. 2. pag. 12. 
                     Diego Payuas Andradius de orthodoxis explicationibus.
                   whiche woordes also M. Hanmer without shame alleageth.
               In his eleuenth assertion he sayeth thus: The Iesuites hold, that there be many thinges more grieuouse and more damnable, than those that repugne the lavve of God, and yet the lavve condemneth them not, namelie, traditions, mans



lavves, & preceptes of the church. But this is shamelesse also: for the Iesuites doe teache the cleane contrarie: to witt, that what soeuer is sinnne, is 
                     〈◊〉
                   condemned by the lawe of God, and what so euer offendeth the lawe of God, yf it be donne wittingely and withe consent of harte (for otherwise it offendethe not the lawe,) is sinne: 
                     In opere catechistico. pag. 350. and this may be seene in the definition of sinne extant in Canisius, a Iesuite. And for traditions, they holde that yf they be suche traditions as came from Christ and his Apostles: then is the wilfull breakinge of suche traditions, sinne directlye against God hym selfe. But yf they be but traditions or precepts of the churche: then the breache therof (as also of all other our superiours commandementes) are offences against men: but yet consequentely also against God: for that he hath commaunded men to obey theyr superiours, whiche rule them, and that in conscience as S. Paul proueth. Rom. 13.
               In his fiftenthe assertion he saith: 
                     Moste false.
                   
                  The Iesuites saye, that iustification is none other, than the seeking or searchinge of rightuousnes or (to speake philosophicallie) a motion vnto rightuousnes. But this is folie, besides malice, shewinge that he knoweth not what he speaketh him selfe. For the Iesuites haue no suche woorde: but do gyue a more learned description of our iustification, than (I thinke) he can conceyue: whiche is this: 
                     
                        The description of our iustification.
                     
                     Gal. 4.
                     Tit. 3.
                   
                  Iustfiication is the translation of a man from that state vvherein he vvas borne the sonne of the first Adam, into the state of grace and adoption of the children of God, through the second Adam Iesus Christ our Sauyour: Canis. pag. 748. VVhat shall we now say of this man?
               In his Nyententhe and Twentith assertions, he sayeth that the Iesuites holde a tvvofolde Iustification, a first and a second: This is true: but what more? And that our vvorkes are necessarilie required for the first iustification, & doe merit the amplification of the second: This is clearlie false: and except this man be besides hym selfe, I maruaile what he meaneth by this shamelesse behauyour. For the Iesuits doe teache the quite contrarie: to witt, Iustificari



nos gratis, quiae nihil eorum quae iustificationem praecedunt, siue fides, siue opera, ipsam iustificationis gratiam promeretur: 
                     Canis: in op

                  These are their very woordes, whiche are englished thus: we are iustified freelie with out woorkes: for that nothinge goinge before our iustification, whether it be faith, or woorkes, doeth merit vs the grace of our iustification.
VVhiche woordes allso of thes fathers, doe conuince M. Hanmers other slaunder in the 21. assertion, where he sayeth. The Iesuites, holde that the vvorks that are before iustification, are meritorious: VVhich is moste false: for besides the place alleaged, they teache the plaine contradictorie therof: to witt, that merit procedeth onelie of grace in them, that are novv iustified. Canis. pag, 786. So that yow see this man hathe no conscience what, or how, or wherein he lyeth. I omitt many exāples more of his malice: Assert. 26. & 27. as where he sayeth, that Iesuites holde, that the lords prayer may be sayde to saintes, and that their reliques may be honoured cultu latriae, vvith the honour due to God hym selfe. 
                  Assert. 2. Also where he falsyfyeth manifestlie the Councel of Trent, sess. 4. cap. 1. By puttinge (51) to their woordes, about traditions, and so peruerting the whole meaning. But I will adde onelie an exāple or two of his ignorance, and then lett the reader iudge whether folye or malice be greater in this minister.

                  In his fiueth assertion agaynst the Iesuites he citeth as blasphemous this sentence of theirs. Synne is so voluntarie, as yf vvill vvere not, it vvere no sinne: VVhere as this sentence is not theirs, but S. Austens, and that twise repeated in two seuerall bookes of his: Vsque adeò peccatum voluntarium est malum, vt nullo modo sit peccatum, si non sit voluntarium. Agayne, in his eigth assertion he citeth this sentence (as blasphemous) of the councell of Trent: VVe accurse them that say, the commaundementes of God to be impossible to a man iustifyed, and in state of grace. VVhere as the verie same is bothe in S. Ierome, and S. Augusten: whose woords are: Execramur blasphemiam eorum, qui dicunt impossible aliquid homini a deo esse praeceptū. Againe, in his seuenth assertion he reprehendeth the councell of Trent, for affirming, that, all sinnes are



quite taken awaye by baptisme, and not rased onelie: Sess. 5. where as the verie same is, woord for woorde, in S. Augusten: Dicimus baptisma auferre crimina, non radere. 
                  Li. 1. cont. 2. ep. pelag. c. 13. By which is euident, that this man hathe eyther redd litle, or borne litle away, besides certaine notes of raylinge, as appearethe: And therefore I thought it nedelesse to answer hym any further. Now therfore will I returne to the Censure, which breeflie gyueth the effect of bothe M. Hanmer and M. Charke his booke as foloweth.

But yet, that I may not seeme to haue gyuen this censure of his booke, without all cause: I will breefelie runne ouer the principall pointes  thereof. I sayd therefore that he answered more quietlie and plainlie: for that he rayled in his first booke lesse than william Charke dyd, as may appeare in that which foloweth, where bothe their woordes against the Iesuites are put downe: also, more good felovv like: For that he draweth not all things to treason as the other doeth, but ioyneth familiarlie with M. Campian, calling hym hys felovv student in Oxforde, 
                  Fol. 2. thoughe hym selfe were but a poore ladd, when M. Campian was of credit and woorshipp in that place. And finallie he persuadeth: M. Campian to take parte of felicitie with hym and his felow ministers, Fo. 5. & 26 
                  to leaue his vovves to be performed by other Iesuites beyond the seas, and ioyning vvith them, to abādonne this austeritie of lyfe, and to taste, hovv svveete the lord i

                   As for, the fovvle lye or tvvo, that I charged hym withall, they are to haue theyr place of examynatyon after. That, he vvas not like to be one of the disputers, yf the  matter came to disputation: was hut onelie my coniecture.

Also, fol. 9. vvhere he bestirreth hym selfe vehementlie, to shew by scripture & doctors, that we must obey superiors and temporall magistrates: who dowbteth of this? And yet this course he holdeth throughout that litle booke, whiche were to longe to repeat in particular. And therfore I might well conclude, that, this booke vvas to small purpose, other than to  spread abrode the copies of M. Campians equall offer, to their hands whiche either could not, or durst not haue it in writing before. VVhereof I dare say many gentlemē in Englād will beare me witnesse: who tooke securitie of getting or retayning the same by countenance of this booke, whiche before they could not safelie doe. And this shall suffice for iustifyeing of this first Censure. Now to M. Charke.
            
            
               THE CENSVRE
               VVilliam Charke dealeth more subtilie: 
                     The effect of M. Charks booke.
                   for he reporteth the Chalenge onelie for his purpose, and that also sometimes falsified, except it came corruptlie to his handes. He vtereth also muche more malice, by dravving euery thing to disloiltie & rebelliō, vvhich is done by the Catholiques for conscience & religiō. He flattereth the higher states, vvhiche can pleasure hym, palpably. He vvearieth his hearer vvith the infinite repition of the vvorne out tearmes, of pope and poperie. He exceedeth in inuention of rayletiue speache. He vndertaketh all maner of lyes vvithout blushing, and ventureth vpon anye assertiō vvhat soeuer, for the bringinge of the Iesuites in discredit vvith the reader.
               Vpon this ansvvere therfore of M. Charke, I meane to enlarge my selfe a litle, ī brotherlie charitie,



not omitting to remember also the other, vvhere occasion  shall be gyuen. And for the restrayning of M. Charks rouing, to some certain points, I meane to consider first of that vvhiche he vttereth touchinge the Societie of Iesuites. 
                     The order & diuisiō of this booke.
                   Secondly, touching the man vvhome he ansvvereth. Thirdlie, touching the matter or demaunde propounded. Lastlie, touching the Apostata brought in, for the defacing of Iesuites and the Catholique religion.
            
            
               THE DEFENCE.
               All those thinges appertaining to the Censure of M. Charks booke, though misliked and denied by hym, yet for that they come after to be verified, in their particular places: I passe ouer now without examination: onelie aduertising the reader, that thexceptiō he taketh  against my order and diuisiō of partes in the Censure, as diuised for myne owne ease, thereby, to be large or short, touche or passe by, ansvvere or omitt at my pleasure, is a causelesse quarell. For that I chose this methode of necessitie, as well for M. Charks ease in replyeing, as for myne owne in answering: & especiallie for the readers commoditie, in vnderstanding the whole matter, when the pithe of all that, whiche laye dissolutelie before in his booke, enuironed with long and bitter inuectiues, embreued with spitefull and contumelious speaches, and euerie waye cast about with odious accusations, light suspitions, insufficient collections, and vaine surmises of treasons, rebellions, dissimulations, practises, & what soeuer els a fond malitiouse head could deuise to obiect, should be drawen out clearlie and orderlie to fowre generall points, and therein, indifferentlie and without cholar be examined to the reader. The which thing yf I haue not performed my desire was at least to performe, and my endeauour shall be now to supplie any thing that wanted then. Albeit I persuade my selfe, that nothing was omitted then of any weight or importance



in M. Charks booke, as may well appeare both by his and M. Hanmers replies. Now then let vs enter vpon the first part of the diuision sett downe by the Censure.
            
            
               THE FIRST PART OF THE CENSVRE, touching the Societie of Iesuites.
               
                  THE CENSVRE
                  Maister Charke imployeth all his povver, and laboureth painfullie, to bring in defiance the oder of Iesuits, containyng most notable, learned & vertuous, men. For the vvhich purpose he vseth diuerse means: and first his ordinarie vvaye of railing, by calling them. 
                        Nickenames against Iesuites.
                      
                     A blasphemouse sect, new and detestable Iesuits, a weake and shamefull order, Scorpions, heretiques, Iebusites, poisoned spyders, wicked monkish friers, and frierlie monkes, scoutes to rebellion, frogges and caterpillers of Aegipt, absurd and blasphemous doctors, bellowes to kindle persecution: of Beggerly estate, traitours, swarmes of grashoppers, noysome beasts. To vvhome M. Hanmer addethe, That theye are the broode of a cryppled souldiour, and of the lowsiest order of all. All vvhiche, I lett passe vvithout aunsvvering, for that it proueth nothing but one, vvhich is, that they lack all Christian and honest modestie, vvhiche abuse so muche so many good men, vvhose vvisdome, learning, and honestye of lyfe is better knovvne to the vvorld, than anie such railers can be credited to the contrarie.
               
               
                  THE DEFENCE.
                  To all this M. Charke ansvvereth by this cōfessiō,  
                     I acknouleige my labour imployed to bring in discredit the Iesuits, And agayne, also, I grannt the speaches vvhich in all hatred of popish practises I vtered: And yet he complaineth grieuouslie in his preface that the papists, fashion is, to discredit the men for their doctrines sake. But let vs pardon hym this, for that he confesseth hatred to haue



bene the cause, Yet notwithstanding I doe not see, how anie learned or common honest man, and muche lesse a pretended preacher of gods woord, can iustifie such vnciuile and outragious tearmes against his brother, by any pretence of Christianlike or tolerable hatred: such as M. Charke (I suppose) wold here insinuate: And that which he wolde seeme to alleage for his excuse in the replie, that, for tenne lines of railing, gathered against hym, he might haue gathered tenne leaues against me: is neither to the purpose, nor trew. Not to the purpose: for that yf I had answered him with bitter speache again, being prouoked by his example and iniurie: what excuse had this bene for him which begāne without exāple? Secōdlye, it is apparentlie false, that he sayeth of me, & excusable by no other figure, than by the license of a lie. For yf we talk, of leaues as printers accompt them: there are but halfe tenne in the whole Censure. But yf he take leaues, as they are folded in that booke: yet tenne leaues, doe take vp a good parte therof. VVhiche yf I filled vpp with railing tearmes onelie, suche as now I haue repeated out of M. Charke: I doe confesse my selfe to haue bene ouerseene, and fault woorthie in writing. But yf it be not so
                        •
                      as the reader may see: thē M. Charks tōgue hathe ouerslipped in foloweing rather the Rhetoricall phrase of line and leaues, than the fathefull report of a true accusation.
                  I may not passe ouer this matter so soone. For that I thinke it of importance to discrye the spirites of vs that are aduersaries in this cause. You know the sayeing of Christ, ex abundātia cordis os loquitur. 
                     Mat. 12. Luc. 6. Our mouth speaketh accordinge to the abundance of our hart. I meane, a man may be knowen by hys speeche, as S. Peter sayd to Simon Magus, vpon his onelie speeche, In felle amaritudinis, & obligatione iniquitatis video te esse. 
                     Act. 6.
                     I see thee to be in the verie gaule of bitternesse, and in the bondage of iniquitie.
And the scripture is plaine in this point. Qui spiritum Christi non habet, hic non est Christi. 
                     Rom. 8. He that hathe not the spirit of Christ appertayneth not to Christ. Now then, yf we consider the quiet, calme,



and sober spirit of Christ, and of all godlie Christiās from the beginning, and the furiouse, reprochefull, & vncleane spirit of Satan, and all heretiques, from time to time: and doe compare them bothe with the writings of Catholiques & gospellers at thys daye: we may easilie take a skantlinne of the diuersitie of theyr spirits. I will not talke heere of euery hoote woorde vttered in Catholique bookes by occasion of the matter, (neither is this in question) for bothe Christ and his Apostles, and many holie fathers after them, vsed the same, some tymes vpon iust zeale, especiallie against heretiques, with whome olde S. Anthonie (as Athanasius writeth beinge otherwise a milde
                        •
                      Saint) could neuer beare to speake a peaceable woorde.  
                        Athan. in vita S. Anthonii Eremitae.
                      But for rayling, and fowle scurrilitie, suche as protestantes vse ordinarilie against vs, & among them selues, when they dissent, I dare auowe to be proper to them, and theyr auncestours onelie.
                  VVhat more venemous woordes can be ymagined thā those of,

                     Scorpions, poysoned spyders, and the like, vsed by M. Charke against reuerend men? M. Hanmers tearmes of lovvsie & crippled, are but Ieastes. For I passed ouer hys scurrilitie, where he sayd in his first booke: The first of your gentrie vvas Ignatius the creeple, standinge vnder Pompeiopelis tovver, and geeuinge the pellet ovvt of his taile. VVhat a shamelesse slouuen ys this, to write? Shevv me Allen (if thovv cannest) for thy guttes (sayeth D. Fulk:

Against. M. Bristow he hathe these woordes, with many more. Levvde losell, vnlearned dogbolt, traiterous papist, shameles beast, of blockish vvitt, impudent Asse, vauntparler, barkinge dogge, and moste impudent yolpinge curre, leaden blockish and doltish papist, proude hypocrite, of stinking, greasie, antichristian, and execrable orders, blunderinge, blynde, boosting bayard, blasphemouse heretique, blockheaded Asse. And in his two bookes against. M. D. Allen, besides the former speeches, and other infynitelye repeated, he hathe these: 
                        In his ansvver to the booke of purgatorie & prayer for the dead.
                      
                     Brasen face, and yron forehead.



O impudent blasphemer, brainlesse brablyng Sycophant, rechelesse Ruffian, vnlearned Asse, skornefull caytise, desperat dicke. O horrible blasphemer. O blasphemouse, barkinge, horrible hellhounde. In his booke that beareth a shewe of answere to M. D. Stapleton, he vseth these tearmes amongest other: Intituled AN OVERTHROVVE of Stapletōs for

                  Thus muche he hathe against thes learned and reuerend men, wherof eche one, for many respectes maye be counted his equall, to say the least, & therfore in common ciuilitie, setting a side all consideration of godes spirite (wherof these good felowes make vaunte aboue other men,) thes tearmes or the lyke were not to be vsed, as in deed amongest the gentiles they were not, nor of any honest or Christian wryter since. I might repeate a greate deale more of this ministers scurrilitie, against many men, whome (forsoothe) he answerethe: (for as one sayd well of hym, he is the protestantes cō

                      and by that, iudge of his style against the rest. He callethe him by one vile name or other in euery page of his booke, as, dogbolt lavvyer: vvranglinge petifoggar: egregious ignorant vsher: goose: asse: prating proctor, meete for a bōme courte: arrogāte hipocrite: impudant asse: blockhedded and shameles asse: blasphemous beast: fylthie hogge, beastely grunter, shameles dogge, & blasphemous idolatour, raylinge Ruffian, & slanderous deuill. And is ther any iote of Christian modestie or godes spirite in this man? is he (to speake indifferentely) more fytt for a pulpitt, or for an ale benche? surely, if the pott were not at hand, when he wrote this: he discouerethe a fowle spirite within his breaste, but yet not vnmeete for a man of his



occupation.
                  And this now of the scollars: but thinke you that the maisters were not of the same spirite? reade Iohn Caluine and you shall see that his ordinarie tearme against his aduersaries in euery chapter almost,

                      especially whē he speaketh against his superiours, as bishopes and the lyke, is to call them Nebulones knaues: which woorde beside the foule gaule whereof it procedeth, is an vnseemelie tearme, euen as that of M. Fulke, when he calleth a counceller to an emperour Raskall Staphylus: 
                        Against Stapletons fortresse pag. 75. It is vnsitting, and argueth excesse of fond and foolishe malice. For yf an enemie of mean conditiō should call an Englishe counceller raskall: should he not discouer therby his owne raskalitie, and lacke of witt?

Hitherto are the woordes of the Tigurine Caluinistes, whiche may easilie refute M. Charks shamelesse lyes in defence of Luther, as after shall be shewed. And heere would I haue the reader to consider withe what conscience Charke dothe call Luther a holy and deuyne man a litle after, and whittaker in his booke against M. Campian callethe hym, a man of holy memorye, seinge the Tigurine Caluinistes, whoe saye their maisters doe call hym an archeheretique and a furious deuyll: is not this open disimulation and blinding of the people? but heerof you shall see more after, when we come to speake of theyr dissention. And this shall be enough of this matter for this time. Now we come to examine whether the Iesuites be a blasphemous sect or no, as M. Charke calleth them, and the Censure denieth: for thus it foloweth vpon that whiche went before.

                  THE DEFENCE.
                  The answer to this is somewhat confuse and vnorderlie. But I will reduce it to the order heere set downe. To the examples alleaged he sayeth: As for the exā
                        ples of Elias, Elizeus, Daniel, and Iohn Baptist, they are no lesse vvickedlie than vnlearnedlye alleaged to auovve the Iesuites order. This is a hoote entrance (as you see) ioyned with a manifest cauille. For these examples are not alleaged to auow the Iesuites order absolutelie, but in one point onelie of different lyfe from the common sorte: whiche point notwithstanding is fownd also in other besides Iesuites. But marke his reason. 
                        OF ELIAS and vvhether he be a paterne of monkes. 
                     VVhat are you able (sayeth he) to bringe out of the vvorde of God, vvhie Elias should, after more thā tvvo thovvsand yeres, be brought in for a patrone of friers? I answer, first, as before, that these examples are onelye brought to proue, that differēt



apparell, dyet, or straite order of lyfe, doe not make sectaries, as you haue affirmed, and now can not defend: and therfore hauing nothing else to say, you make these vaine and idle interrogatiōs, in steade of proofes. For you aske agayne, vvhat vvas there in Elias, Elizeus or Daniel, that may liken them to Iesuits? I answere, there was (to our purpose now in hand) different maner of lyfe from the common sort of men, whiche notwithstanding made them no sectaries, as you wold haue the Iesuits to bee, for that cause. To this I add (which is more than I nede) that S. Ierom. proueth plainlie that Elias and Elizeus were the beginners, 
                        Ep. 13. ad paulinum & ep. 4. ad rusticum.

And as for the number of two thowsand yeres, whiche you cite so preciselie, as though antiquitie should lett these prophetes to be examples of monasticall lyfe: It is an argument woorthie suche a diuine as you are: for by that reason, nether Adam could be a patrone of maried men, nor Abell of Shepheardes, nor Cain of husbandmēne, nor Enoch of citizens, nor Iabell of dwellers in Tents, nor Iubal of Musicians, nor Tubalcain of smithes: for that they liued twise as long a goe as Elias dyd. And yet the scripture sayth they were begynners and patrones of all these things: Genes. 2.3.4.

Iohn he answereth: Iohn Baptist that may seeme to make moste, maketh nothing at all for you: for that it is to be thought he vvas an extraordinarie & a perpetuall Nazarete, & therfore his calling vvarranted hym for hys austere & extraordinarye attyre, & die

For we affirme not that extraordinarie austeritie of lyfe, is layd vpon any man of necessitie, but onelie that it is, lawfull, and maketh no sect, when it is voluntarie taken and vsed. Moreouer yf we



graunt S. Iohn were a Nazaret, yet that proueth not, that all his austeritie of lyfe was layd vpon hym by necessitie of that vocation, as may appeare in the booke of Nu

Iohn Baptist. Ioseph. li. 2. ca. 7. de bello Iudaico. VVherfore though he were a Nazaret, yet moste of his austeritie was voluntarie, and so might be an example, & platforme to Monks, especially seing Nazaretes also dyd make a religious vowe, for theyr dedication to God (as our religious people also doe vse) as appeareth in the booke of Numbers.

                  Next after these examples he reprehendeth my description of a sectarie, 
                        THOVCHINGE the true definition of a sectarie. sayeing: that it bevvrayeth great vvant of learning, for that it confoundeth heretiques vvith sectaries, and maketh no distinction betvvene the generall and the speciall: for all heretiques are sectaries (sayeth he,) but all sectaries are not heretiques. For learning heere I striue not: lett the opinion therof fall where it best lyketh the reader to place it. But in matter of truthe M. Chark is greatlie ouer seene in this place, and doeth vnwoorthelie chalenge the credit of a learned man for this answere: hauing incurred two grosse errors in the same. For first among diuines & Ecclesiasticall writers, 
                        The difference betvvyxt heresie and a sect.
                      an heretique and a sectarie is all one, & there is no generall and speciall betwene thē, as he imagineth. VVhich appeareth also by the scripture it selfe. For act. 28. where bothe the latin translation and their English hathe a secte, the greek hath heresie, So likewise gal. 5. the same



you may reade act. 24.26. & 2. pet. 2. And if in olde time there were anie differēce betwene these woordes amōg the gentiles: heresie was the more generall: cleane contrarie to that M. Charke imagineth. 
                        The signification of heresie more generall then of a secte.
                      For that heresie (signifyeing an election of some priuate opinion) was the generall name to all the particular sectes of philosophers. As to the secte of Stoikes, platonikes, peripatikes and the like: as moste learnedlie doe note S. Ierom: in cap. 3. ep. ad Tit. And Isodorus l. 8. etym. cap. 3. Theophilact, in ca. 2. ep. ad col. And Tertulian. l. de prescript: So that this was a great ouer sight in M. Charke.
                  The second argument whiche M. Charke vseth to proue a difference betwene a sect and an heresie, and so to ouerthrowe the definition, is, 
                        A fond argument.
                      for that yf one man (sayeth he) cutt hym selfe of in opinion, he shall not be called a sect except there be manie. But he shalbe called a sectarie M. Charke: as also for the same cause, he shall be called, not an heresie, but an heretique. I maruaile where your witt was, when you deuised this differēce without a diuersitie. But you adioyne to this, two examples of scripture: the one of the Corinthians sharplie rebuked of Schisme by S. Paul, for that, one sayd he was of Paul, an other of Apollo, an other of Cephas, an other of Christ: 1. Cor. 1. who notwithstanding dyd not differ in matters of faith (saye you:) but therein by your leaue, you are greatlie deceyued. For albeit S. Paul doeth vse the greeke woord Shisme in that place, 
                        Schisme.
                      which (in his proper significatiō) is but a degree to heresie, (as S. Augustine proueth by example of the donatists, 
                        Ad quod vult. hae. 69. first shismatikes & after heretiques:) yet schism in his large & ample significatiō (whereby it signifiethe all diuision) cōprehēdeth not onelie, heresie, but also all error of faith, whereby men are deuided in beleefe, 
                        Heresie. Error.
                      which is not alwayes heresie, except it be defended against the churche with obstinacie. And such schisme o
                        •
                      diuisiō in beleefe was the schisme of the Corinthiás, (as S. Austen well noteth) for that they erred in a point of faith, 
                        Tract. 5. in Ioh.
                      esteming the vertue & power of Baptisme, not to depend onelie of Christ, but of the dignitie of the Baptiser. 
                        The erroneous schisme of the Corinthians. 1. Cor. 1. And therfore, one



bragged, as baptized of Paul, an other of Apollo, an other of Cephas: & some (folowing the trueth in deede) sayd, that by what minister soeuer they were baptized, yet held they onelye their Iustification & sanctificatiō of Christ, as cōcurring equallie with all his ministers in Baptisme. This is S. Augustens Catholique exposition, & besides this, 
                        The exposition of S. Pauls vvoords. 1. Cor. 1. the woordes of the text doe manifestlie proue the same. Is Christ deuided (sayeth S. Paul?) that is, doeth he impart hym selfe more in one mans baptisme than in an others! or doeth he not equallie and whollie concurre in euerie of his ministers baptisme? Agayne: vvas Paul crucified for you? to witt, thereby to be able to sanctifie you of hym selfe, by his baptisme? Or vvere you baptized in the name of Paul? No: but in the name, power, and vertue of Christ, who onelie sanctifieth in euerie baptisme. I thank God that I haue baptized none among you, but Chrispus, and Caius, and the house of Steuen, lesse anie man might say that you vvere baptized in my name. By this it appeareth plainlie that the Corinthiās were deuided in matter of faythe, about baptism. VVherfore, as this example maketh nothing to the purpose, for whiche it was brought: so is it fondlie and malitiouslie applied by you against Catholiques, whoe say, I folovv the rule or order of lyfe of Benedict, I of Augusten, I of Basil, I of Francis: wherein there is no difference of faith at all: 
                        An exāple
                      No more to this purpose (thoghe the matters be vnlyke) than yf yow ministers should saye among your selues in the contrarie sense of libertie, I will liue vnmaried after the order of my Lorde of Canterburie: I will take a wyfe after the platforme of my Lord of London. I will haue two wiues together, after the fashiō of M. Archedeacon of Salesburie: I will haue a wyfe and a wenche besides, after the custome of some other archedeacon and preacher in England.
                  Your second example is of the phariseys, vvho vvere a notorious sect (saye you) and yet dyd not cut of them selues by heresie from the churche. 
                     
                        Heresies of the pharises
                      VVherein agayne you ouerslipp fowlie. For in that they were a notoriouse sect, they held particular heresies, as the passing of soules



from bodie to bodie, & the like, whereof you may read in Ioseph: L. 2. de bello Iudaico, cap. 7. & in philastrius in his catologe of heresies vpon the woord phariseus. 
                        HOVV THE PHARISES vvere a sect in tvvo senses. And this is to be vnderstoode of some of the pharises. For other wyse I confesse that the pharises were sometime called a sect or heresie, in good parte, for that they defended the immortalitie of the soule, and were deuided therby from the Saduces, 
                        A sect or heresie may sometimes be taken in good parte. Act. 26. who denyed the same: act. 23. And in this sense spake S. Paul, when he sayd before the Iudgement seat (towching his lyfe past before his conuersion) I lyued a pharisey, according to the moste certaine sect of our religion. VVhere is to be noted, against M. Charke againe: that S. Paul in greeke vseth the woord heresie, whiche in his generall signification, importinge onelie a choyse of any opinion (as I haue noted before) might be taken in good sense, euen as this woorde Tyrannie, 
                     
                        Tyrannis.
                      might, and was taken of the olde writers, though now by vse and appropriation, bothe the one and the other be taken in euell part. And (to the ende M. Charke may confesse his ouersight in this matter) I will alleage hym the woordes of one of his owne doctors, M. Fulke by name: who of this matter sayeth thus. 
                        Against Bristovvs Motiues. pag. 14. 
                     S Paul hym selfe openlie acknouleged that he vvas a pharisey, vvhen nothing vvas vnderstoode by the name, but one that beleeued the resurrection of the dead, although the tearme of pharisey vvas othervvyse the name of a sect of heretiques, vvhiche maintained many damnable errors, from vvhiche the Apostles vvere moste free.
                  
                  By this nowe is defended the definition of sectaries geuen by the Censure: and ouerthrowne that fond new definition deuised by M. Charke, and called by hym a truer definition, according to the true etymologie of the vvord: 
                        M. Charks definition of a sect.
                      to witt, A sect is a cōpagnie of men that differ from the rest of their religion, in matter or forme of their profession. Touching the true etymologie, whiche he speaketh of, I can not tell what he meaneth, nor (I think) hym selfe. For in greke the scripture vseth the woorde heresie for i
                        •
                      (as hathe bene shewed) whiche can yelde no etymologie, to maintaine this definition. And in



Latin, Secta muste nedes come, ether a secando or a sectando: bothe whiche being referred to matters of the mynde (as necessarilie they must) doe include alwaye a diuersitie of opiniō, as hath bene shewed: & M. Charke can not geue one example to the cōtrarie, for the maintenance of this absurde definition of different forme in profession &c. VVhereby he wold make all them sectaries, whiche differ in anye externall forme. By whiche reasō, all their owne byshops, ministers, Iudges, lawyers, and the like, are sectaries: and all diuersities of states are sects.

                      For is there not a different forme in making of a byshope and of a minister? is not there diuersitie in their authorities? in their apparell? in their state, and forme of lyfe? notwithstanding that bothe doe professe ministerie of the woorde? The laye man and the preacher, doe professe one religion, and yet is there no difference in the forme of their profession? is the ministers forme of apparell, of preaching, of ministring the sacraments, of obedience to his byshope, of obseruing the statuts of college or church wherein he is, nothing different from any other laye man? or is he a sectarie for this? who wold say this, and much lesse print yt, but onelie william Charke?
                  I leaue the begynning of his definition as too too childish & ridiculous for hym, 
                        M. Charcks fond ouersight.
                      that professeth learning, where he sayeth: a sect is a companie of men: as yf a man should say, an heresie is a compauie of men: or an opinion is a companie of men: or a frencie is a companie of frentike men. VVhen S. Paul saieth: I liued a pharisey according to the most certaine sect of our religion: Act. 26. will ye say, he meant, according to the moste certaine number of men of his religion? or rather according to the moste certaine deuided opinion of his religion? for the number of phariseys were not certaine. Againe, when S. Paul sayeth: Gal 5. 
                     the vvoorks of the flesh are manifest, as sects &c. VVill you saye here multitudes of men are workes of the fleshe? where as the greek hath heresies? So like wyse, 2. Pet. 2. when S. Peter sayeth) of false prophets) they bryng in sectes of perdition, in greeke heresies of perdition: will you saye,



multitudes of men of perdition? I omitt many other examples in scripture, which doe conuince your absurditie, and besides that, doe proue our principall point, that sects and heresies are all one. Although I am not ignorant, that in common speeche, this woorde sect, may improperlie signifie the men also whiche professe the same, but not in a definition, where the proper nature of eche woorde is declared.

                     After this new definition set downe, M. Charke proueth the Iesuites to be a sect, by the same, for whose disgrace onelie he deuised it. His collection or argument, is this: Seing therefore the Iesuits receyue a peculiar vovve to preache, as the Apostles dyd, euery vvhere: to doe it of free cost: to vvhipp and torment them selues after the example of a sect called by the name of vvhippers, and condemned longe a goe: seing thy are deuided from all others, and doe folovv the rule of Loyolas: it appeareth plainlie they are a sect. A substātial conclusion, for a man of your making, These be like the conclusions ye made in the tower against M. Campian. I meane not of your last conclusion, to dispache hym at Tiburn, for that was vnanswerable, although nothing foloweing of the premisses: I meane of your pretended dysputations wyth hym. But to our matter: what is there in this illation that can make the Iesuits a sect, if it were all graunted to be true? that they vovv to preache as the Apostle dyd? Yow know, the scripture doeth allow and commende the dedication of a mans lyfe by vow to gods seruice: Num. 6. Psalm. 131. VVhat then? To preache euery vvhere and at free cost? This you should be a shamed to say, seinge Christ hym selfe commaundeth it to his Apostles: Nath. 28. Mark. 16. Math. 10. 
                     Teache all nations: preache the gospell to all creatures: yovv haue receyued it freelie, geue it freelie And S. Paul gloryeth muche that he had taught the gospell of free cost. 2. Cor. 11. VVhat then maketh them sectaries? To vvhipp and torment them selues, yf it were true? why? for what reason? It is writen of S. Paul by hym selfe, that he chasteyned his owne bodie. 1. Cor. 9. yea and that he caried the brāds of Christe in his flesh. 2. Cor. 4. And the scriptures do talke muche of mortyfyeing



our members: of crucifyenge our flesh, 
                        Coloss. 3. Gal. 5. & 6. Rom. 12.

                        Mat. 3. Marc. 1. Heb. 11.
                      and the like: and neuer a woord of pamperinge the same. And ecclesiasticall stories doe make large mention of great seueritie of the auncient fathers and Saints heerein. As of the seueritie in lyfe of S. Iohn Baptist and other Saints Also of the Saints of the olde testament: who went about (as S. Paul sayeth) in camels hears, in goats skinnes, and the like. And he that will see great store of examples gathered together out of all antiquitie about this matter: lett him reade but one chapiter of Marcus Marulus de castigatione corporis per flagella, 
                     Ca. 10. li. 3. of chasteyning the bodie with whippes.
                  S. Ierom. testifyeth of hym selfe (by an occasion gyuen) to a secret frende, Ep. 22. ad Eustoch of his:  But you vvill saye S. Ierom. vvas no protestant. 
                     That his skynne, vvas novv become as blacke vvith punishement, as the skinne of an Ethiopian. And Ioannes Cassianus that liued about the same time, hathe infinite examples of the practises of holy fathers in this point. And albeit Peter Martyr a renegate friar, after he had now coped with a wenche, doeth ieast at S. Basil and S. Gregorie Nazianzen, for the hard handling of their owne bodies: 
                        In ca. 16. li. 3. Reg.
                        An offer of coolinge physicke to the ministers of England.
                        In Londō. In Banberie.
                      yet there is reason to think, that they knew what they did as well as he. And yf you ministers of England wold vse a litle of this salue sometimes also: possible, the worlde wold goe better with you, & fewer Eatons should neede to stand on the pillorie, for lyeing with their owne daughters: & fewer hynches flye the countrie for rauishing of yong gyrles, especiallie being preachers, and hauing wiues of their owne besides: And manie other foule enormities (in this kynde) wolde easier be auoyded. But yf you will not practise this remedie your selues, for contristing or making sadde the holie ghoste within you, as your phrase is: yet impute it not as Schisme and heresie to them which vse it moderatelie, as you may imagin the Iesuites will, being not fooles, nor hauing yron bodies, but sensible, as yours are.
                  And as for the last reason you add, of their folowing Loyolas his rule of lyfe, and that they are deuided from others: & made schismatikes therby: I haue



shewed before, that being but a particular direction of lyfe and maners, grounded on the scripture and practise of auncient fathers, and allowed by the superours of the Churche: it can be no matter of sect or heresie, nether are Iesuites seperated frome others by this, but rather nearer ioined with all the godlie: for that vertue is but one, and he that leadeth the most vertuouse lyfe, is ioyned nearest to Christ, and to all good Christians.
                  
                     Charks belyeing of the Iesuites.And this now may be answered, supposing that all were true that you report in this place of the Iesuites lyfe and vocation, which is not so. But as well heere, as commonlie in all other places, you lay downe some inuention or addition of your owne malice
                        •
                      against thē. As for example: In this place, it is moste false that you affirme of thē: that they take a peculiar vowe to whippe and torment them selues. There was neuer any such vowe eyther taken or talked of, muche lesse is it true, that they take that vovve to doe it (as you saye) after the example of a sect called by the name of vvhippers, condemned long agoe. You are a greate enemye to whippers (M. Charke) and you think yt good sleepinge in a whole skynne. I doe not blame you for it. Nether are you a greater mislyker of all whippers in generall, then I am in particular, of those whome you heere name:

                      for they were heretiks, (as you may reade in prateolus and Gerson) teaching that the baptisme of water had nowe ceased, & the baptisme of voluntarie bloode, by whipping, was ordeined in place therof: without which none coulde be saued: and therfore they whipped themselues opēlie: teaching also many other heresies beside: for whiche they were cōdemned. And what doeth this make against the sober & moderate chastisemēt, which good men vse in secret, vpon their owne bodies, at such time as they esteeme them selues (for mortification) to neede the same? was there euer honest man but your selfe, wolde haue obiected so impertiment a thing in print? but you make me laugh when you say a sect condēned long agoe. How long agoe I praye you (M. Charke) or by whome were they condēned? the storye is euidēt:

And is this condemnation authentical with you? yf it be: you know Luther & Caluin were condemned by lyke authoritie. And thus for lack of matter, you lay holde on any thing though it make neuer so muche against your selfe.
                  The last point is about the name of Iesuits, THE NAME of Iesuites.
                      against whiche, for that you quarelled muche, the Censure did shew that the name was not taken to them selues of arrogancie (as you obiected) but geuen them by common speeche for breuities sake, where as theyr true name in deede, by foundatiō of theyr order, was, societas nominis Iesu: a societie dedicated to the name of Iesus. Now against this you replie, that I doe call them Iesuits in" my booke. But what is this to the purpose? is it not lawfull for me to folow the common phrase of speeche? or because I call them soo, doeth that proue that they chalenge that name to them selues? Secondlie you say that Turrian a Iesuit calleth them soo: and what yf he dyd, foloweing the common maner of speeche? doeth that conuince that they appoint that name vnto them selues? but yet you are too too impudent to attribut this to Turrian, especiallie with suche vehement asseueration as you doe. 
                        Impudēcie.

                      Secondlie you seeke to deface the Societie by cō
                     temptuouse deprauing of all (1.) religiouse men: calling them, Base & beggerlie monkes & fryars, popish orders, 
                     Monks and friars. and the like: vvherein you folovv the (2.) olde heretiques  of the primatiue Churche, vvhose propertie hath bene from time to time, to hate and depraue those kynde of men aboue all others, as S. Austen testifieth of the Manachies, In psa. 132 Li: 11. hist. cap. 3. and Rufinus of the Arians. And petilian the donatist, folovving the same spirit, scoffed at S. Austen for being a fryar, as S. Austen hym selfe vvriteth in these vvordes. Li. 3. cont. li. Petil. ca. 40. 
                     After this, Petilian proceded on with his slaūderouse mouth, to speake euill of monasteries, and of monkes, blaming me also for that I had set foorth this kynde of lyfe, the which lyfe ether he knoweth not, what it meaneth, or else feigneth him selfe not to know it, though it be notorious to all the world. S. Austen saythe this kynde of lyfe (of monkes and fryers and other religiouse men) vvas notoriouse and



knovvne to the vvorlde in his time, both in respect of the famous men, that had liued in the same, as Anthonie, Paule, hilarion, Basill, Nazianzen, Martin, Austen hym selfe, and others: as also of the infinit bookes and treatises vvhich holie fathers of the primatiue Churche had vvritten in defence and commē

Basill also vvrote a great volume intituled, Cōstitutions or lawes for monkes: beside diuers other treatises of that argument, vvritten both by hym selfe, and by Gregorie Nazianzen. S: Chrisostom hathe fouer homilies extant in commendation of the lyfe of monkes: and tvvo vvhole bookes, of the comparison betwene the Mounke & the king, vvherin he preferreth the lyfe of the monke, before that of the king. Also he vvrote a booke against you (M. Charke) intituled: Against the blamers of Monkes and Monasticall lyfe. Iohannes Cassianus a litle after, vvrote 12. bookes intituled, Of the lawes and ordinances of Monkes. Seuerus Sulpitius vvrote a dialogue contaynyng the notable conuersation of the Esterlie monkes, vvith S. Martin Abbot of eyghtie monkes. And finallie, S. Austen (for I vvill come no lovver) hath vvritten manie treatises of Monkes, commending highly that excellent kinde of lyfe, and defending it against the detractions of heretiques of his tyme.
                  Let any man reade his hundred thyrtie seuen epistle, vvherof the title is, That for a few euill monkes we should not infame all monkes. In vvhich epistle hee shall see all the slaunderous argumentes of all heretiques,

                           dae. q. 18. art. 1.To this in effect is replyed verie litle, beside a vayne cauyll or two, and certaine ordinarie euasions. for first, he misliketh greatly, that Monkes, Nounes, and the like, are called religiouse people, as though they onelie (sayeth he) had religion in them. But this is a meere cauyll. For these vvere not called religiouse by antiquitie, for that they onelye hadde religion in them, but for that they made profession of more perfect folovveing of Christian religion, than others, by remouing vvorldlie impedimentes, according to the counsayle of Christ touching perfectiō: Marc. 10. 1. Cor. 7. Mat. 19. & 16. & Esa. 56. where chastitie, voluntarie pouertie, and abnegation of our owne vvill, are commēded and counsailed to perfectiō, and the countraries thereof in other places of scripture shevved to be great impedimentes. Novv the vanitie of this olde hereticall quarell against religiouse, may be shevved by a thovvsand examples. VVhen vve say, learned men, vve meane onelie such as make profession of more excellent and deepe learning, than the rest: and yet, vve mynde not thereby to exclude all other men from all learning and knovvlege, besides them. VVhen vve call ecclesiasticall persons, the clergie, that is, (accordinge to the signification of the vvorde) the lott or inheritance of God,

                        EROS. as all antiquitie hathe called them, namelie



the first councell of Nice, almost in euerie Canon: And Origen and S. Ierom. proue the vse thereof out of the tvvelueth chapiter of Ieremie: Orig. ho. 7. in Iere. Hier. in 12 Ierem. vve meane not hereby, to exclude other Christians from all inheritance of Christ (as suche a vvrangler as Sir vvilliam, might cauyll:) but that these men are more peculiarlie, dedicated to gods seruice than other. The like, when vve call onelie tvvelue Apostles: (vvhiche signifieth sent) vve meane not that none were sēt by Christ but they onelie: For we read of diuerse others sent by him also Math 6. & Luc. 10. vvhich in that sense are trulie also Apostles: but vve meane that those tvvelue vvere principallie sent, and therfore by a certayne excellencie, onelie called Apostles. By vvhiche examples and infinite more it appeareth, that this man vveygheth not vvhat he sayeth, so he say somevvhat.

VVhich I cōfesse: and yf M. Charke wold stand to this his sayeing: we should quicklie be at an ende for this controuersie: For we all speake against, and cōdemne euell monkes, as we doe also euell pryests, euell byshops, euell princes: And we say that their damnation shalbe farre greater than the rest.

Charke and his felowes: who bothe condemne all religiouse people, of our time to be lewde, (which is wicked presumption cleane contrarie to the scripture forbydding to iudge, Rom. 2. & 1. cor. 4.) and for their supposed euell life, doe also cō

                           es be the same as vvas in the primatiue church
                     Heere are in effect, fowre or fyue differences gyuen betwene our monkes and those of the primatiue churche, to proue that their states of lyfe are not the same. All whiche (except onelie the first) yf they were proued or graunted as they lye, doe not proue one iote of diuersitie in their state of lyfe, thoughe somewhat in their manners. As we may easilie graunt, that the men of no state doe liue so perfectlie now, in their vocation, as they dyd in the primatiue churche: and yett this doeth not alter their state or vocation. For example: Yf I should reason against the byshops of England, as M. Charke doeth against Monkes: 1. Cor. 4. our byshops are not so learned painefull and holie as they of the primatiue churche were: 
                        •
                     hey doe not labour with their hands, as the first byshops dyd, they doe not goe a foote, preache of free-cost, watche, praye, & fast, as they dyd: therfore they are no byshops, or their vocations is not the same that the others was: is this a good argument? no surelie, nor you shall neuer fynde it vsed by a Catholique man. For by this means we might ouerthrow all states, seing that they lyue not so well as man of their calling in the primatiue churche dyd. VVe can distinguish betwene



the lyfe of men and their vocation or state of lyfe. And though we mislike the one, yet we can permit the other. Onelie troublesome heretiques from the begynnyng (to engarboyle common wealthes) haue impugned the states of lyfe, 
                        Hereticall consequences.
                      for the vitiouse manners (ether true or supposed) of some priuate men: as for that some pope lyued euell, therfore no popedome, no authoritie to be graunted hym. For that some monks or Nonnes haue liued wickedlie, and contrarie to their vocation: therefore no monks or Nonnes are to be permitted.
                  And this is now vpon supposall, that all were true which M. Charke sayth of these differences:

                      whiche is nothing so. For with what modestie, or conscience can he, sitting in England, gyue sentence of all the monkes and friars in Christendome abroade, that they are vnlearned, vnpainfull, and vnholye, hauing neuer had experience of all theyr lyues hym selfe, and seeinge so many learned woorks writen by them daylie? he might heare (yf he were in these places) infinite preachers of them (throughe out Europ and further) with great example of vertue, to labour painfullie in gods churche: argueth not this an intollerable and indiscrete malice then, to condemne them all so peremptorilie as he dothe? And as for labouring with their hands, though it be not necessarie 
                        •
                     o any, yf they be occupied in greater matters: yet there is no monasterie where in some doe not exercise that function also: those I meane, whiche are not otherwise employed in seruice of the churche, preaching, or ministringe of the sacramentes. And for the last point, of not yeelding ministers to serue the churche: It is too open and apparent a slaunder. For as I haue said of preachers: so may I saye of byshops, chosen euerye where out of monasteries to gouerne in gods churche. And Pius Quintus within the space of fiue yeres, chose 70. learned men for byshops, out of one onelie order of religious men, besides all other. VVherfore this man (as you see) talketh of all Christendome, from his poore benefice by London, as barbers are wont to doe, of cō

                     TOVCHING RELIGIOVS VOVVES.But in deede the first difference whiche he putteth is to the purpose, and of great importance: (I mean touching vowes) yf yt were true, that is, yf he were able to proue that the monkes of the primatiue churche, made no vowes as he affirmeth. For I doe confesse, that the making of those thre vowes, of pouertie, obedience, and chastitie, are the essentiall points of a religiouse lyfe. And therfore yf olde monks dyd not vow: I confesse theyr state of lyfe, was not the same with that of our religious people at this daye, And therfore M. Chark should haue proued this point substantiallie: and then in deede he had done some what. But he bringeth not so muche as one syllable for the proofe thereof besides his owne credit, which is not woorthe halfe a sillable in this matter against monkes, whome he hateth so insatiablie. But yet marke his subtilitie. S. Augustin doeth make mention of some things by him named,

For S. Augustin hath no one woorde against the voweinge of Monkes in his time: but cleene contrariewise he testifieth the same moste plainlie. As for example, 
                        In Psal. 75. circa finē.
                      where he sheweth a reason to a monke whie he could not lyue out of his monasterie, as other doe, without damnation, he sayeth to hym:

Augustin the doctor confesse it of him selfe here in the Censure alleaged? yf that doe not suffice: reade the same confession of hym selfe in diuerse other parts of his workes, as in ep. 89. and tract. 1. de com: vita clericorum: and read Possidius in his lyfe, whoe liued 40. yeres with hym, and addeth, that diuerse of S. Augustins Monkes, instituted many monasteries in his lyfe time. 
                        VVhether S. Augustine vvere a friar or no.
                      But (say you) he vvas no friar. In deede the englishe names of friar or Monke were not then extant, for that we were not yet Christians. But the Latin names frater and monachus were attributed to hym, as may appeare in the places alleaged. VVhiche, ioyned with the vowes, whereof I spake before, doe proue the thinge, what soeuer you may wrangle of the Englishe name. But what require you more to make hym a friar after the englishe fashion? yf you will haue me gesse at his apparell, it were hard; and nothinge pertinent, for that onelie the vowes make the vocation, as hathe bene shewed. yet S.

                        Of the voluntarie pouertie of Christ.
                      offēdith greatlie our replyer. The example of Christ (sayeth he) is alleaged moste blasphemouslie against his Maiestie. Still the woorde blasphemie, must be one. But what is the reason? vvhen dyd Christ euer vvhipp hym selfe sayth M. Charke? Yet the choler of whipping is not past from M. Charks stomacke. But I answer: he had no rebellion in his fleshe as we haue, by reason of the conflict of concupiscence left vs: for resisting whereof we vse mortification of our bodie, according to S. Pauls counsaile, coloss. 3. Neyther is it necessarie that we should doe nothing in this kynde, but what we reade expresselie Christ to haue done: Albeit, to geue vs also example herein, Marc. 6. & 9. Luc. 6. we reade of his great fasting, and long prayeing, with lyeing all nyght on the ground, which not withstanding I think you ministers will not imitate. But you adde: Christ frequented publike assembleys, & vvas sometimes entertained at great feasts. Yea marie, this is for good cheer: this is more pleasant than the doctrine of the whippe. And dyd you neuer heare (Syr) of religiouse men inuited also to a feast or assemblie? You are wont to call thē bellie gods for that cause: and how is this

Luc 8. was not this voluntarie pouertie in hym selfe? And he that counsailed men to renounce all they possessed, for his seruice, and to gyue all to the poore, that would be perfect: dyd not he recommende voluntarie pouertie to other, thoughe he comaunded it not? Yf the Apostles left all proprietie, and dyd lyue in common, Act. 2. Act. 4. & 5. as the scripture noteth: and many good Christians chose to sell all they had, and to offer it to that communitie (though not vpon constraint as S. Luke testifieth:) And yf Ananias and Saphira for breakinge their vowe of pouertie,



made with the Apostles (as S. Basil and S. Ierom,

                     1. Cor. 6. & 10. The carnall Iewes were much entysed by those blessings in the olde testament: but in the new testamēt, you shall neuer fynde Christians eyther allured to thē, or dandled and smothed in them, as you doe your folowers: but rather to the contrarie, many threates and hard sayeings are vttered against richemen, Mat. 19. Marc. 10. Lu. 6. & 18 1. Tim. 6. Apo. 18. Rom. 16. and such as liue in pleasures and ease of this woorlde. And therfore your often repeating, and tickling fleshlie harts with naming carnall and worldlie blessings, proueth you (yf I be not deceiued) to be one of them, whereof the Apostle sayeth: they serue not Christ, but their ovvne bellye, and doe seduce innocent hartes by svvete vvoordes and blessings.
                  
               
               
                  THE CENSVRE.
                  Thirdlie, you endeuour to bring the Iesuites in cōtempt by their obscure conception (as you tearm it) from one Loyal as a Spanyard, and had not their fulll creatiō and commission vntill about thirtie yeres past,



from pope paulus quartus. VVherein you erre: for it vvas frō Paulus (1.) 1. tertiꝰ, the third pope before Paulus quartus, and the third pope after leo decimus, in vvhose time Luther began. Soe that there is not muche difference, betvvene Iesuits and protestants, in their antiquitie of name, marie in matter verie greate: for the protestants faythe and beleefe began at that time: but the Iesuites, folovving vvith humilitie the fayth vvhich they fovvnd in the Catholique Churche, onelie beganne a strayter kinde of lyfe in maners and behauiour, 
                        The true lyfe of Iesuits.
                      than the common sorte of people vsed: for reformyng of vvhose vices, they dedicated them selues to God, and to all kinde of labour, paines, trauaile, and perill, vvith abandonyng all vvorldlie pleasures, and all possibilitie of prefermēt in the same, so farre furth, as none of that Societie hath, or may take any spirituall or temporall liuings, or cōmodities vvhat soeuer, though diuers greate princes haue pressed them often times vvith the same, but of free cost they preache & teache in all places vvhere they are sent, vvith all humilitie of spirit, and vvithout intermedling vvith matters of estate, as shalbe shevved more hereafter. VVherefore M. Charke offereth them the greater vvrong in charging them vvith the contrarie. 
                        M. Hanmers notoriouse lye.
                      And M. Hanmers impudencie is the more to be vvondered at, vvho blusheth not to put in print so notoriouse an vntrueth in the sight of all the vvorld, and to repeat, vrge and amplifye the same so often in his booke, sayeing, that one (2) 2. Theatinus a Iesuit hypocriticallie got to be Cardinall and pope,

                  THE DEFENCE.
                  Litle defence needeth heere, for that the replyer hathe nothing in effect to say, beside a rayling sentence or two against the Iesuits: saieing, that they eate the sinnes of the people.

His error of taking Paulus quartus for Paulus tertius, he excuseth by sayeing, that kemnitius writeth so. But this rather accuseth thā excuseth the fact, adioyning also wilfull malice to the error, whiche might haue seemed before of ignorance onelie. For he had read kēnitius reproued for the same by Andradiꝰ,

Hanmer, HANMERS LYE. for sauing his honestye, answereth it, mary with such successe, as men that take in hand to amende olde tubbes by knockinge, wherein often in steade of stoppinge one hole, they make manye. For first he sayeth, that in denyeinge Paulus quar

Secondlie he sayeth, that I vvill haue onelie Andradius payua a Iesuit and a partiall vvriter, to be of more credit in this matter, than many other learned men. Beholde an other breache & that a great one. For payua was no Iesuit, nor coulde write partiallie in this matter,



being a matter onelie of fact, and that publike to all the worlde. For it is as euident and well knowne that Paulus quartus was neuer Iesuit, as it is, that the king of Fraunce was neuer franciscan frier. And although diuerse Lutherans of germanie foloweing kemnitius his error, and theyr owne blynde hatred against Popes, haue writen the contrarie: yet (the matter being so apparent) it litle importeth, seing there may be alleaged tenne sor one, to the cōtrarie, yf the thing were doubtfull, or woorthie dicussing.

After this, vpon a certaine emulation and contention, betvvene hym & the fryers of S.

                  THE DEFENCE.
                  M. Charke, as wantinge matter of iust replie i
                        •
                      this place, wriggleth at the begīning to & fro, to auoyde the force of this comparison betwene Ignatius and Luther, sayeing: That it is impertinent: But the reason thereof is layed downe, in the Censure: And as for the fond argumentes whiche he wolde enforce out of my meaninge, to proue, that Ignatius might beginne a societie, and Luther distayne their gospell. (VVhich notwitstanding he graunteth not to be sett downe expresselie in the Censure,) I leaue to M. Chark, as poore deuises to solace his owne miseries with all in this his distresse, when taking vppon hym to make a booke, and his promise being past to his frendes of the same, he now fyndeth nothing to fyll vpp pages, except he wander out, to suche Idle imaginations, as neuer came in the Censurers heade to thinke vpon. But at lēgthe, yet, let vs hale hym to the matter, and see what he sayeth. For Ignatius, (he saythe) I vvill passe ouer. For Martin Luther (before he cometh to the matters obiected) he exclameth greatlie against me for alleaging Coclaeus, Hosius, Lyndanus, and Sainctes, as witnesses in my reportes, beinge (as he sayeth) of our religion, and enemies to Luther. But consider (I beseeche you) the equitie of this complaint. Yf I did alleage these mens Iudgements against Luther in matters of controuersie: his exception might seme to haue some reason, but seinge I alleage them onelie in matter of fact, knowne to other men aswell as to them selues: why should M. Chark take the matter so greuouslye? by this reason no storie should be credited, yf the reporter were of a contrarie religion. I saye not this to Iustifie all histories. 
                        Iohn Sleidan a famouse lyar.
                      For it is well knowne of the eleuen thousand lyes writen by Sleidan in fauour of the protestants, and refuted by Bartholomeus Latomus, euen by the testimonie of them, whiche were present at the doinges, as shall be shewed after. But when there is no reason, nor proofe, to denie a fact reported by suche men, as now I haue named, whereof the moste were Germans, and knew Luther well, and the first of them



lyued with hym, 
                        Cocleus.
                      and tooke vppon hym selfe to write the particular storie of his lyfe, while Luther lyued, & to sett it furth, when all Germanie coulde reprehend hym, yf it had not bene true: And the other being reuerend and learned byshops, and had great meanes and occasions to know the truthe of the factes they write: why should M. Charke take it so impatientlie, and think it suche vniust dealing, to alleage theyr authorities, not in matters of iudgement and doctrine (as I haue sayed) but onelie in report of facts, which they coulde not deuise of them selues, without dānable wickednesse, nor report to the worlde without open shame, and reproofe, yf the thinges had bene false?
                  But let vs examine the reportes them selues, perhappes they will yealde some occasion of Iustyfieinge their reporters. And first (to discredit myne Authors with all) M. Charke beginneth with a report of his owne, and not of myne: 
                        VVhether Luther vvere begotten of a deuill.
                      sayeinge, that I left out for shame the report of Prateolus, that Luther vvas begoten of a deuill. But yet this is nothinge to the discredit of the other fower Authors named before, yf Prateolus had reported amisse of Luther, and I concealed or passed ouer the same. For nether could I in that litle booke, nor was it necessarie for me to recite what soeuer I found writen of Luther. Secondlie, M. Charke greatlie bewrayeth his falseholde in this point, and iustifieth our true dealing. For Prateolus foloweth not the fashion of protestantes in affirminge absolutelye, The differēce of protestants & Catholikes in reportinge. what so euer they heare, or can imagin against vs: but rather the good conscience of a Catholique man, whiche ys to lay downe things as in deede they are, without adding or amplifieing the same. He sayeth then, that diuerse men had writen this thinge of Luther, and a matrone of Lipsia in Germanye dyd affirme yt. 
                        Gab. prateol. lib. 10. de haeres. pag. 27. But he hym selfe neyther affirmeth nor denyeth it. His woordes are these:
Sūt qui Lutherum scribūt ex incubo natum, qui eius ma
                           •
                        rem balnei publici seruulam oppressit
                           •
                        sed nescio cuius sit fidei: fides sit penes lipsicam illam Matronam, cui mater eius fuit notissima:
                     There are, that write Luther to haue bene borne of an Incubus (that is



of a filthie spirit abusing women in place of man) whiche oppressed his mother, when she was a seruant in a common bathe in Germanie: but I know not of what credit it is: the credit dependeth of that matrone of lypsia, which reported yt, and knew well his mother.
                  
                  Here now yow see the modestie of Prateolus his report, and the bolde impudencie of w: Chark; in sayeing that he auoucheth that, whiche (as yow see) he auoucheth not. But yet, whether M. Charkes impudē
                     cie or folye were greater, I can not tell, in making mention of this thing, being so fowle a matter against their first prophet. For what will he saye? that it is false? yet at least there remayneth a shamefull suspition, vpon the reporte of diuerse writers, and the asseueration of a Matrone, which belike had it of the cōfessiō of Luthers mother her selfe. And the probabilitie of the thing seemeth not haue bene so great in those dayes, as Erasmus beleeued yt, whiche yet, by M. Charkes Iudgement, was no papist. For in his purgation ad epistolam Lutheri non sobriani. That is, to Luthers dronken epistle, he alludeth to the same, sayeinge, Mirum est impio & blasphemo sermoni non addidisse de ineubonibus &c. It is maruayle that Luther had not added somevvhat of Incubons, or filthie spirites that abuse vvomē, to the rest of his vvicked and blasphemouse speeche.
                  
                  But now yf M. Charke will stand vppon the deniall, not so muche of the fact, as of the nature of the thing it selfe, as impossible, that spirits can so abuse lewde women that will consent to theyr lusts: I will oppose S. Augustine against hym, 
                        Li. 15. de ci ui. dei. c. 23. who sayeth, it vvere impudencie to denie yt, and proueth it by many wayes, as also Ludouicus viues doeth vppon the same place of S. Augustine. VVhat then hathe M. Charke gayned by mentioning of this whiche I left out?
                  
                     
                        VVhether Luther vvere stroken vvith a thū
                           der. bolt.
                     Touching the matter of the Thunder bolt, though M. Charke denieth it stowtely, and (as Lyndans reporte onelye) wolde seeke to discredit the same by obiecting certaine things against Lindā, which are not true: yet is it not B. Lyndan onelie that doth report it (as he well



knoweth) but the consent of other writers besides. 
                        Prateol. cō
                           haer. li. 10. an. 1517. Prateolus his woordes are these. Martin Luther after the studie of lavve, vvhen he had bene strycken dovvne in the feeld vvith a blovve of lightnyng, and terrified by the deathe of his companion, professed hym selfe an Austen fryer. Heere are touched two things: his stryking downe, and the deathe of his companion: whiche could be no ieste. And albeit there appeared in his bodie no wounde of the thunder bolt (as M. Chark cauyleth:) yet might he be stryckē downe with the feare thereof. And Melācthon him selfe, who otherwyse dissembleth moste diligentlye all matters turninge to the dishonour of his Maister: yet maketh he mention bothe of this feare, and also of the deathe of his companion, and graunteth it to haue bene one principal motiue of his entraunce into religion. 
                        In praefat. tom. 5. operum Lutheri, vvittēb. anno. 1562 His wordes are these:
Hos terrores seu primum, seu accerrime sensit eo anno, cum sodalem nescio quo casu interfectum amisisset:
Luther felt thes terrors & feares, eyther first, or moste sharplie that yeare, wherein he lost his companion, slayne, I know not by what chaunce.
                  Nay, Martin Luther cōfesseth the matter him selfe, 
                        This epistle vvas vvriten 21. of Nouemb. 1521. & is prefixed before his booke. De votis monasti cis. tom. 5. in an epistle to his father Iohn Luther, to whome he yeeldeth a reason of hys runninge owt of religion, by his vnlawfull entrance thervnto:
Memini nimis (sayeth he) praesente cum iam placatus mecum loquereris, & ego de coelo terroribus me vocatum assererē. Neque enim libens & cupiens fiebam monachus, sed terrore & agone mortis subitae circumuallatus voui coactum & necessarium votum.
I doe remember too well when yow beinge pacified, talked with me present, & I affirmed that I was called by terrours from heauen to enter into religion.
For I was not made a friar willinglie, and of my owne desire, but beinge enuironed with terrour, and with the agonie of suddain deathe, I made a vow vpon necessitie and enforcement. Heere the matter is euident by Luther hym selfe, whiche M. Charke so confidentlie denieth, and cryeth out against bishope Lindan for reporting the same: 
                           Belyinge of Lyndan.
                        
                     
sayeing:
That he vvill not beleeue Lyndan in this, no more than he vvill beleeue his reporte that the Caluinistes doe



vvorship the Image of the deuyll. 
                           De fugiendis Idolis.
                        
                     
In deede he sayeth that Caluinists doe adore theyr owne imaginations suggested by the deuyll, aboue all authoritie or proofe besides, (as all other heretiques doe) and in that sense doe honour the deuyll. Againe, he sayeth that in the yeere of our lorde 1572. when Caluinistes went to ouerthrow a monasterie at a towne called Leyden in flaūders: they erected the signe of the deuyll in theyr publique banner, whiche neuer Christians dyd before. Yf M. Chark could haue refuted any of these particulars: he should haue done well. But by his generall reporte, though he seeke to bring Lyndan in hatred: yet it turnethe to his owne discredit, & releeueth nothing his cause in hāde. 
                        The deuyll cryeyng out of Luthers mouthe.
                     
                  
                  For the deuyll crieing out of Luthers mouthe, thoughe M. Chark woolde seme to denye yt: yet bringeth he not one syllable in disprofe thereof: & so many particulars are put downe by Coclaeus, whoe liued with hym: as euerye man may see that the matter was euidēt. And no protestant in Germanie (where the matter was done, as where also (being Lutherans) they doe esteeme Luthers honour more than Caluinistes doe) neuer yet hathe bene able to reproue the same. But now come we to the doctrines of libertie and carnalitie, whiche the Censure affirmeth Luther to haue taught, after he had once coped with a Nonne. 
                        Luthers lyeinge vvith a Nonne in the lorde.
                      VVhiche M. Charke after his ministeriall phrase expresseth in these woordes. VVhen the lorde had opened hys eyes, thinkinge hym selfe no longer tyed to hys vnaduised and superstitiouse vovv, he maryed in the lorde, and all this vvas laufull. But how soeuer you name the lorde (M. Chark) to couer this lasciuiouse lecherie of a renegate frier with his vowed ladie: yet I haue shewed before, out of the auncient fathers, that this pretended mariage, on bothe partes was esteemed worse than adulterie in the primatiue churche: whereof he that will see more, lett hym read.

                     But now to the doctrines them selues, 
                        Of Luther carnall doctrines.
                      in whiche I will be as short as I may in defence of my reportes, being moste true, as shall appeare by luthers owne wordes, and that in those books of his, and editions whiche are to be had in England publiquelie: So that the aduersarie shall haue no more refuge to saye he can not finde the booke. And as M. Charks vntrue dealing hathe bene indifferentlie discryed by that which went before: so shall it be muche more by these doctrines of Luther. And because bothe M. Hanmer and M. Charke haue taken vppon them seuerallye to answer the same: I will couple them together, where soeuer they haue any thing woorthe the notinge, aduertising the reader by the waie, that whereas Luther hathe diuerse editiōs of his woorks, and diuerse of them diuerslie trāslated, 
                        VVhy the same booke in Luther sometim

                      out of duche into latin: he must not maruayle yf the same booke some tymes haue diuerse titles, though I meane now to cyte them vnder such names (as nighe as I can) as they are to be sene, in the editiō of wittenberge sett furthe, and as I haue seene them my selfe in England by melancthon Anno 1562.
                  
                     The first doctrine.
                     Fyrst then,

                         I affirmed Luther to teache, that there is no synne but incredulytie: neyther can a man damne hym selfe, (do vvhat mischefe he can) except he vvill refuse to beleue. M. Hanmer denieth not this doctrine: but defendeth it: M.

                        I may plainlie pronounce that in this place you doe in vvoords and matter reporte an open vntruthe: For M. Luther hathe no suche doctrine. Heere is no agreemēt in the deffēders, the one graūtinge it, & the other so flatly denyeynge the same. But who wolde think M. Charke could answer thus without blushing?

                           Nulla enim peccata eum possunt damnare nisi sola incredulitas: So thou seest how riche a Christian man is, who can not leese his saluation (though he wolde) with neuer so great sinnes, except he will not beleeue. For no synnes can damne hym but onelie incredulitie.
Again, in the same tome he sayeth: Pag. 73. 
                        Infidelitas sola turbatio est conscientiae: onelie infidelitie is a trouble of conscience. Is not heere now as muche as I haue sayed? If nothing must trouble a mans conscience, but onelie vnbeleefe: then nothing is sinne but onelye vnbeleefe. Again, yf a man can not leese his saluation yf he wolde, neuer so fayne, (by committing neuer so greate sinnes) except he will not beleeue: then may a man doe what he will, so he fall not into incredulitie. But yet to shame these shamelesse men; a litle further, and to shew the wicked licentiouse doctrine of this loose apostata: heare more what he sayeth in an other place. Nihil prauum facit praeter infidelitatem. Nothing maketh a man euell besides infidelitie. 
                           Concione. prima super dom. post trini.
                         And a litle after he concludeth thus: Ex hiis omnibus sequitur, ꝙ nullum vs

Chark be a true mā, in denyeinge the matter so absolutely & with suche vehemencie as he dothe, affirming that Luther nether in woordes or matter hath anye such thing. VVill you beleeue hym in other things which faceth a lye so openly in this. But a lacke the poore man must saye somwhat, for credites sake in their broken cause.

                        Secondlie I reported Luther to say, the tenne commaundemēts appertaine nothing to vs: VVhich verie woordes bothe M. Hanmer and M. Charke doe graunt to be in Luther. Marie they make long discourses vpon his meanyng, whereby it is easie to putt on a colourable defence or excuse vpon any thing. But lett the reader consider

                         how these woordes doe sownd in the eares of the people, especiallie being ioyned with the doctrine



goeing before, of onelie vnbeleefe to be sinne. And albeyt it be true which M. Chark sheweth out of S. Paul that we are not vnder the ceremoniall lawe of the Iewes any longer: Yet this can not verifye luthers woords that the tenne commaundements appertayne nothing to vs. No, nor that which M. Hanmer alleageth out of Luther as interpreting hym selfe, sayeing, that the tēne cōmandementes appertaine to all, but not for that they vvere commaunded by Moyses: but for that they are vvriten in the nature of euery man: For that by this means they should no more appertaine to vs than vnto g

                     Thirdlie, 
                           One onelie true gospell by Luther.
                         I reported of Luther that he sayd: It is a false opinion & to be abolished, that there are fovver gospells. For the gospell of Iohn is the onelie fayre, true, and principall gospell. This report M. Hanmer graunteth wholie. M. Chark graunteth the effect of the first and cheefe vvoordes, but the latter, concerning S. Iohns gospell he findeth not: And therevpon thinketh that Luther neuer wrote any suche preface to the new testament as I cyte, and therewithall inueigheth against me, as citing at large, and often times bookes vvhiche are not found: as that de missa angulari: Also as layeing downe one title for an other, and the like.

whiche M.

Mary yet Gesnerus a Caluinist maketh mention of fyue treatises de Missa priuata, whiche are not to be gotten in England, as I imagin: and yet it were no reason to say therfore, that no suche treatises were euer writen by Luther, as M. Charke dothe. Further more, Luther hym selfe often chaunged his owne woorkes: as the same Gesner testifieth that the book whiche he wrote against kyng henrye in latin, was nothinge lyke that he wrote before against the same in duche. Besyde this, dyuerse other did alter Luthers woorkes, bothe Suinglians and lutherans euen in Luthers owne tyme, therby to draw hym to theyr deuises, and partes.

                         And of Suinglians, Luther hym selfe complaineth greuouslie, against Martin Bucer. And of Lutherans, it appeareth not onelie by the contention aboue named, abovvt the corrupt edition of Luthers vvoorkes: But also by the often altering of the confession of Augusta, writen by Luther and Melancthon, and accounted as a Gospell amonge the Germane protestantes, yea preferred before the Epistles of S. Paul,

                         as Alasco a Caluiniste dothe write, but yet many tymes altered, as ye may see in Andrevv fabritius, which hath putt furthe all the editions from the beginning, muche differing & repugning one from an other: by all which appeareth, that heretiques doe prepare them selues starting holes for all needes.
                     But now to the matter: Albeit M. Charke and M. Hanmer doe glose vpon the woordes of Luther, & wolde haue hym say onelie, that the fower gospels



were but one gospell, and the lyke: yet the matter is playne to hym that is not partiall, that Luther speaketh in detraction of the three former gospells: for whiche cause he sayeth in the place by M. Charke alleaged, 
                           In enarrat in epist. pet. Tom. 3. vvitenb.
                         
                        you may more rightlie call the epistles of Paul a gospell, than those things vvhich Mathevv, Marke, & Luke haue vvritten. VVhiche signifieth some toothe against these three gospells. Now for the last point touching S. Iohns Gospell, it is to be seene ī the preface by me alleaged: which yf you can not finde: it is not my fault. 
                           It vvas ouersight then for M. Chark to say that no suche preface vvas euer vvriten.
                         For that such a preface is extant, & that in latin: yf you will not beleeue me: reade but the Index of Luthers latin woorkes in Coclaeus, where you shall finde it named: As also in Gesnerus (one of your owne religion) in the Cataloge of Luthers woorks, fo. 504. suae bibliothecae. And in that preface you shall reade, not onelie so muche as I haue affirmed: but also these woordes: The epistles of Paul and Peter doe farre passe the three gospells of Mathevv, Mark, and Luke: 
                           The greate impudencie of our aduersaries.
                         VVhich yet more proueth Luthers euell opinion of those three gospells. And immediatlie it foloweth: Iacobi autem epistola, prae illis straminea est: The epistle of Iames is of straw, in respect of those of Paul and Peter: which I haue added, 
                           In his ansvver to M. Campians first reasō.
                         to shew the intollerable impudēcie of you & your felowes in the Tower against M. Campian: for that he could not presentlie shew out of your bookes, where these woordes were written by Luther: especiallye of M. VVhitaker: who (to the admiration & laughter of all other natiōs) hathe set foorthe in latyn, that Luther neuer called the Epistle of S. Iames Stramineam, a stravven epistle: this is that (I say) that maketh men to think, that you are gyuen ouer to a desperate resolutiō, to mayntaine an euell cause, euen against your owne consciences, when you blush not to auow suche open vntruthes. 
                           The same also hathe Luther in his preface to S. Iames epistle in the duche testament, as more at large is shevved in the ansvver to vvhitaker.
                         For I am sure that whitaker being a reader in diuinitie could not chuse but haue redde those woordes alleaged by learned men, aboue an hundred times against Luther: and yet he denieth them as confidentlie, as yf he had neuer heard of the matter. VVhat may be sayd to suche men?

Iohn expresselie: as of the necessitie of the commaundements, and lyfe euerlasting, gyuen for keping the same Math. 19. Of the paye due vnto good woorks Math 20.

peece of a sentence against the manifest purpose of the vvriter? 
                           Extreme impudencie of a lyeing mynister.
                         You haue reason M. Chark: and yf the matter goe so cleare against me, as you make yt: I ask no perdone, but let me be discredited for euer. But yf you haue shewed here suche a peece of willfull and shamelesse dishonestie, as can not be excused: how will yow looke your owne freends in the face hereafter? Let vs then examyne the matter. First I graunt that Luther sayeth, that he vvrote this counsaile for confessors, or such as heard confessions, vvhen he vvas yet in feare of the pope. For so are his wordes. But yet that this was after his Apostacie frō the Catholique Religion, or (as you terme it) after his conuersion to your Gospell, (for many yeres after he stoode in feare of the pope, and sayd nothing against confession): 
                           
                              Ser. de Matrim. tom. 5. vvittem. fo. 120.
                           
                              Ergo he vvas no papist vvhan he vvrote this.
                           
                        
yt appeareth euidentlie by his whole discourse in the place alleaged: where he sayeth plainlie (beside other things) that the papists dyd seeke aduauntage against hym for this opinion of his, and to that ende dyd misreporte his woordes (as he sayeth:) besides, you knowe that papists teache no suche doctrine, but the plain cōtrarie, & therfore he coulde not mādare literis as his woordes are that he did: that is, he coulde not put in vvriting & publishe suche a doctrine among vs, but he wolde haue bene resisted presentlie, yf he had bene of our churche at that tyme. So that this shyft of youres is euidentlie false: that he wrote it when he was a papist, For albeit, he being not yet sufficientely fortified with fryndes to defend hym stood in feare of Antichrist, as he tearmeth him, and consequentely durst not breake any further to the open execution of this beastely doctrine, as afterward he dyd: yet had he left papistrie, as you call it, a good whyle before, as appeareth by his owne wordes; and by computation of the tyme wherin he wrote this booke.
                     But now to the second point, whiche is the cheefest. Yow affirm (and I confesse) that Luther sayeth: But novv I vvould gyue other counsaile: But what? wold he reuoke that he had sayde? speake M. Chark, or else you are shamed. VVolde he reuoke his sentēce (I say) being



now out of the feare of the pope

                         but he will doe muche worse. For whereas before he dyd but counsaile the husbād to permitt his wyfe to lye with an other: Now being pope hym selfe of Germany, & owt of feare of the pope of Rome, he will compell hym to yt. And how, trow yow? as the pope of Rome doeth compell mē, by excommunication? No, but by taking hym by the locks (for those are his ruffianlie woordes) he wolde towze hym except he dyd yt. I will recite luthers owne stile, that you may see where true and false dealinge ys.
                     Thus then he gyueth the wyfe counsayle and authoritie to speake to her husband. 
                           
                              Ser. de matrim. vt supra.
                           
                           
                              Marke Luthers counsail to a mās vvise.
                           
                        
                        Ecce marite, debitam mihi beneuolentiam praestare nō potes, meque & iuuenile corpus decepisti &c. Faue quaeso vt cum fratre tuo, aut proxime tibi sanguine iuncto, occultum matrimonium paciscar, sic vt tu nomen habeas, ne res tuae in alienos haeredes perueniant: ac sine vt spōte tua a me decipiare, quemadmodum & tu praeter voluntatem meam imposuisti mihi. Perrexi porro, maritum debere in ea re assentiri vxori: quod si renuat, ipsa clandestina fuga saluti suae consulat, & in aliam profecta terrā, alii etiā nubat. Consilium tale iam tum impertii, cum adhuc me detineret pauor antechristi: nunc verò secus longè consulere animus esset, talique marito, qui adeo mulierem deludat dolis, vehementius lanificium (immissa manu) conuellerem, vt vulgo dici solet.
                        
                           Idem de muliere iudico, quàmquàm id rarius sit quâm in viris. In english thus: Beholde husband, you cā not performe the frendshipp you owe me, and you haue deceiued bothe me and my youthfull bodie: be cō
                           tent (I pray you) that I bargaine a secret mariage with your brother, or with some next of your kynne, in suche sorte as you may still beare the name, to the ende your goods may not passe to straunge heyres: And permit your selfe to be deceyued willinglye of me, as you haue deceyued me against my will. And I went yet further (sayeth Luther) and affirmed that the husband ought to geue consent to his wife in this matter: and that yf he refused: then shee might prouide for her healthe by secret flyeing from him: and goeinge into an



other countrie, might marie an other.
This counsaile I gaue when I was yet in feare of Antichrist. But now my mynde should be to geue farre other counsaile, 
                           Here M. Chark breaketh of the sentence as thoughe no thinge folovved.
                         that is, layeing my hands vppon the locks of suche a husbād that should so craftelie deceyue a woman, I wold shake hym (as the prouerbe is) and that vehementlie: and the same is my Iudgement of the woman also: albeit it falleth out more seldome in women than in men to neede this counsaile.
                     Now let the reader Iudge, whether M. Charke be a true man or no, in cutting of the woordes that folowed immediatlie in Luther, after the sentence by hym alleaged: Consider-also vvhat a face MEREDITHE HANMER. hathe, in denieing the vvhole matter, and sayeinge that Luther hathe no suche thing. and notwithstandinge, with a moste impudent face to crye out, and insult against me, as reading a peece of Luthers sentēce, against the manifest purpose of the vvriter? can this be excused from extreme impudencie, and moste willfull falsehoode against his owne cōscience? Lett hym defend this yf he can with all the helpes and deuises of his felowes: or else lett the reader by this one point of open dishonestie discouered, Iudge of the rest of their dealings with vs, & of their slaundering of vs without all cōsciēce, in their sermons, where they are sure not to be controlled.

VVhereupon Alberus (one of your owne religion) noteth, that IOHANNES Leidensis tooke many wyues, and one KNIPPERDOLLINGE tooke thirtene for his parte. So that this doctrine was not onelie taught, but also practized vpon Luthers authoritie.

being not in deede his ovvne vvordes, but alleaged by hym as spoken by an other. M. Charke graunteth them absolutelye, to be Luthers owne woordes, but seeketh an interpretation for Luthers meanyng: sayeing, In this place Luther speaketh of a thyrd cause of diuorse, vvhen the vvomā shall obstinatlye refuse her husbands companie. So that these men doe litle care what they answer, so they say somewhat: and we may see how trymlye they doe agree. But the truthe is, they are Luthers owne wordes deliuered to the husband to vse to his wyfe: as the woordes before were for the wyfe to vse against her husband: and they can not be excused eyther by M. Hanmers shamelesse deniall, or by M. Charks impartinent interpretation: thus they stand in Luther: 
                           Serm. de Mat. tom. 5. vvittemb: 
                        Hic nunc oportunum est, vt maritus dicat: si tu nolueris, alia volet: si domina nolit, adueniat ancilla.
                        Here now is oportunitie, for the husbande to say to the wyfe: yf you will not, an other will: yf the mistresse will not, lett the handmayde come.
And that this was practized in Germanie, 
                           In profess. Cathal. impressa Colon. 1580. (to all kynde of lasciuiousenesse) yea among the ministers them selues Sebastian flaske (a preacher once of Luthers owne familie) doeth testifie. And when you are not a shamed to defend the doctrine: you are more bolde than the Lutherans them selues, who for verie shame doe suppresse the Germane booke,

Now whereas you seeke to couer this dishonest doctrine of your prophet, by alleaging two positions of the Catholiques about deuorse in mariage, as absurd in your sight as this: the one, that a man may deuorce hym selfe from his vvyfe, for being a bondvvoman, yf he kuevv it not before the mariage: the other, that he may do the same for couetousnes in her, by Peter lombards: opinion the first is true: & allowed by all lawes of nature, Ciuill, and Canon, & that vpon great reason: for that he which marieth a bondwoman vnwittinglie, leeseth his free



choyse by ignorance, 
                           Can. si quis ingenius: 20. q. 2. & Cā si foemina. 29. q. 2. nor can not haue power ouer her bodie (as mariage requireth,) she beyng in bondage to other. Also he can not beget childeren but bonde, cum partus sequatur ventrem: And cōsequentlie can not bring them vpp, at his pleasure, nor instruct them necessarilie: which things doe repugne to the state of mariage. The second, albeit it be but the sayeing of one man, yet his meanyng is, that yf this couetousnes, or other notoriouse vice of the wyfe, should break out to the husbands notable dammage, or daunger, (as yf she should fall to stealing, or the like:) then he might dimittere eam (as lombards woordes are:) that is, dimisse her from his companie: but not dissolue the knott of wedlock: as bothe S. Thomas doeth expounde it 3. p. q. 59. art. 6. and Dominicus Sotus in 4. sent. dist. 39. art 4.

                           Matrimonie before virginitie.
                         yt may be noted of the reader for examples sake, how farre you differ from the spirit of the primatiue churche, whiche condemned this position, as an intolerable heresie, in IOVINIAN and others, onelye to make equall matrimonie with virginitie: as appeareth by S. Ierome in his two moste learned and vehement bookes against Iouinian: and by S. Augustin, recounting the 82. heresie of his time.Ep. 81. And by S. Ambrose also in his epistle to Syricius the pope, and by other fathers. And yf this auncient churche, (whiche our aduersaries in woordes will graunt to be the true and pure churche) dyd detest this heresie in IOVINIAN, HELVIDIVS, & BASILIDES:
I mean, to affirme matrimonie paris esse meriti cum virginitate, as their woordes are: that is, to be of equall meritt with virginitie: what



wolde the same churche doe to M. Luther, & M Chark, for preferringe mariage before virginitie?

                         did write whole books in commendation and preferment of virginitie aboue all other states of lyfe, comparing it to the lyfe of Angels, and affirming the dignitie thereof, to be incomparable: what wolde they haue sayd, yf they had heard the base scurrill, & impiouse woordes of M. Luther de natura statuum in sese, 
                        
                           Luther exeges: ad c. 7. ep. 1. ad cor. vvitten. fo. 107. as his owne explication ys: that is, of the verie nature of these tvvo states in them selues, with out respect of abuse or good vse: to affirme (I saye) matrimonium esse velut aurum, the state of matrimonie to be as golde: and the other state of virginitie and continencie to be vti Stercus ad impietatem promouens. Like stinkinge dung promoting to impietie. Esa. 56. v. 4. Math. 19. v. 12. 1. Cor. 7. v. 38. Can any thing be spoken more abiect, or more cōtradictorie to the scriptures, & fathers than this? can hell be more opposit to heauē, thā the carnalitie of this apostata to the spirit of all saincts?
                     Againe in your second doctrine, where you affirme that Christ & S. Paul dyd not counsayle but dissuade virginitie to Christians: VVhether Christ & S. Paul dyd dissuade virginitie. 1. Cor. 7. Matt. 19.
                         can any thing be more contrary to Christ and S. Paules sayeinges, or the auncient fathers interpretation of their woordes? I haue no precept from Christ, but I geue counsaile (sayeth S. Paul:) he that marieth his virgin doeth vvell, but he that marieth her not, doeth better: Is this to dissuade or to counsail, M. Chark? There be Eunuches vvhiche haue gelded them selues for the kyngdome of heauen: he that can take yt: Lett hym take yt, sayeth Christ: doeth this dissuade or rather prouoke to virginitie & cōtinencie?

                           Quasi hortantis vox domini est (sayeth S. Ierom) & milites suos ad pudicitiae praemium concitantis, qui potest capere capiat, qui potest pugnare pugnet, superet ac triumphet.

VVith S. Ierome do agree all the holy fathers in this exposition: And william Charck can not bringe me one in this case to



the contrarye: that is, to speake for preferment of hym and his wyfe before virgins.

                           Serm. de matri. edi. vvitenb. fo. 126. 
                        verum est profectò eum lenonem esse oportere qui matrimonium fugiat, post

                        It is true verilie, that he must nedes be a bawde that flyeth matrimony, seing God hath created man and woman for copulation and multiplications sake. A wyse reason of a lecherouse apostata: for by this, euery man must eyther couple and multiplie, or else be a bawde.
How say you then of your present superintendētes of Canterburie & Salesburie? will you saye they are bawdes? Nay, how saye you to all those true holye byshops named before, of the primatiue churche, as Athanasius, Cyprian, Ambrose, Chrisostom, Basil, and Austen, whoe, bothe lyued without womē them selues, and wrote seuerall bookes in the prayse and commendation of that lyfe, were they all bawdes without exception?

                         as vnder hand for a mollifycation you would seeme to graunt: but yet in deede you may not, in this our case. For we talke of the measure of those thinges onelie, whiche make men more iust and holie: that is, of grace and merit: The whiche yf you graunt to be more in measure in the saincts, than in your selues: then graunt you them to be more holie, and so, flatt against your owne position here defended. Yf you denie yt: & make them no more holy thē your selues, or any other Christians (as in deed you doe:) then (besides the apparent absurditie of the thinge,) haue you against you S. Ciprian de disciplina virg. S. Ierom. li. 2. cont. Iouin. S. Augustin de S. virg. cap. 26. And Theodoret in c. 15. ep. 1. ad cor. whiche proue of purpose bothe by scriptures, examples, and theological reasons, that the merites of men and revvardes are vnequal. Also S. Ambrose in ca. 6.

Also you haue against you all the primatiue churche, whiche condemned your opinion for a flatt heresie in Iouinian as S. Augustin testifieth in heresi 82. and S.

Ambrose in an epistle of his to Siricius the pope: Am. ep. 81. where also he addeth: agrestis vlulatus est diuersorū gradus abrogare meritorum: yt is a barbarouse howling to abrogate the degrees of diuersitie of merits. And the same Ambrose answereth your friuolouse obiection, that God is no acceptour of persons,

Finallie, albeit you rayle at Dionysius Areopagita for this matter, calling hym, bastard Denice, whose legitimation (besides infinite other testimonies) was acknowleged in two generall councels: not muche lesse than a thousand yeres gone: 
                           Concil. cōst. act. 4. cā. 2. yet the matter is playne by

Io. 3. that workethe rightuousnes: (which comprehendeth all maner of vertues and iust lyfe:) then your neighbours (I wene) will beare witnesse, that you ministers are somewhat behinde S. Peter and S. Paul, and the mother of God, in holynesse and rigtuousnesse of lyfe, what soeuer you say in your owne commendation, to the contrarye.

For clearenesse I will not stryue: for you see yt is vttered with full mouth (according to his fashion) from Martin Luther: but surelie for diuinesse I see lytle therein, except M. Chark meane black diuinitie, suche as Martins familiar could teache hym: whereof we shall haue presentlie more occasion to entreate.

                         For yf a Christian man can not damne him selfe with any sinne except he will refuse to beleue: And yf the ten commaundementes appertaine nothing to hym: Again, yf to kepe virginitie & resist the pleasures of the flesh be neyther commendable (for that mariage is far better:) nor possible, seing a wyfe is as necessarie as meat drinke or sleepe: beside this, yf when he hathe tasted one wyfe, he may vpon causes, lye with her sister, or the next of her kynne: and yf these wold be obstinate, he may take the mayde in steade of the mistresse: and



with all this, may be (notwithstandinge) as holie, and as iust as euer was Peter, or Paul, or the mother of God her selfe: yf all this (I say) be true, as Martin Luther warranteth vs, Math. 7. Luc. 13. & william Chark defendeth: who can complayne of the hard waye to heauē? who can saye iustelie, the gate is straite, seing this good frier, and his frende haue eased yt so fauorablie? but now lett vs heare the rest of the Censure.

And Luther hym selfe cōfesseth in his vvorkes, that he had often and familiar speeche vvith hym, and that he vvas first moued by hym to vvrite against the Masse, in the yere 1534. He also describeth his voyce, sayeing, that it vvas so terrible, huge, and dreedefull, that he vvas lyke to dye diuers times, after the nightes conference vvith hym. And that diuers men vvere slayne by such conferēce. Notvvithstanding it vvas his chaunce to escape, albeit (as he sayeth) he dyd eate more than a bushell of salte together vvith this deuill. But yet neuerthelesse he vvas deceyued in the end, as all men are that deale vvith suche Marchantes (3.) 3.

After this, Luther putteth hys owne answers to the deuyll, and the deuilles replies: to whiche in processe, his being not able to answer, finallie yeelded, to banishe the masse vpon the deuils appointement. And this was the honorable beginning of Luthers conuersion, 
                        The beginning of protestancye from Sathā
                        
                      and of all protestancie, by the expresse woordes and confession of the first beginner hym selfe.
                  But heere william Charke hathe a shyft for this fowle matter, sayeing, that this conference of Luther vvith the deuyll, vvas no other than suche a temptation or conflict, as Christ and Saint Paul had vvith Sathan: that is, it vvas no bodilie conference, but a spirituall fight in mynde, sayeth this minister. O fond and blasphemous euasion. Suppose it had bene onelie a spirituall temptation in mynde, suche as the conflictes of Christ and S. Paul were: yet the cō
                     parison is impious: for nether Christ, nor S. Paul dyd euer yeelde to the persuasions of the deuill, as Martin Luther dyd in banishing the masse. And this is the difference betwene euill and good men in this lyfe: that bothe beinge assaulted with persuasions from the deuill: the one yeeldeth to them,

                      and the other resistethe.
                  Secōdlie, it is euidēt, that this cōferēce of Martin Luther was more than spirituall: as appeareth by the deuilles preface, wherein he calleth the fryar, right learned doctor, according to the veine of pryde wherwith he saw hym puffed vpp, and therby redye to receyue his impressions. The same appeareth also, by the sound of Sathans voyce described in the place alleaged in the Cē

Finallie, 
                        See before in the Cēsure the place quoted.
                      the bushell of salt, whiche Luther confessethe hym selfe to haue eaten together with this deuill, proueth that he had bodilie conference with hym: And that this Sathan was become now verie gentle and familiar to Luther, albeit he was churlish and kylled other hys companions.

So that Sleidan alone is not sufficient to ouer-beare so many witnesses in this case, wherein he was moste partiall, that is, touching Luther: he beinge luthers scholar, and writing purposelie bothe at his appointement, and in his commendation.
                  But yet because you shall not want a sounde testimonie also in this matter: I will alleage you IVSTVS IONAS, Luthers deare freend and cooke, as partiall towards hym as Sleydan hym selfe, but onelie that being at his deathe, and writinge a booke of the same, by the prouidence of God, he vttered this point among other.

So that in verie deede, this one marke of disagreement is sufficient to shew what spirit they are of.
                  After this synode of Marpurge they mett together at Swabache, and after that againe at Smalcald, the 12. of December,

                      but without any effect of vnion or agreement, as bothe Sleidan and lauatherus doe testifie. After that, they had diuers meetings, talkes, conferences, disputations, synodes, conuenticles, at diuers places and times, but alwayes departed more enemies than before,

                      appointed by the former Councell or dieta of Ratisbone, to treate of certaine conditions to be obserued on both parties, in practise of theyr religion. And when the



first question was proposed, what articles of faithe eche parte wolde haue allowed by publique authoritie: the Catholiques agreed presentlie: marie the ministers fell out, and therupon a daye or two was allowed them to agree, but they grew further and further in dissention for sixtene dayes together,

                      and the seuententh daye, they were further of than at the beginninge. For then had seuē of the twelue excommunicated the other fyue for heretiques, and as vtterlie disagreing from the Confession of Angusta.

                      Mary yet those seuen could in no wyse agree among them selues, what articles onelie were to be receyued, and what to be excluded, and so, that meeting was brocken of, without effect. This storie doe write bothe Amsfordius, and Gallus, Lutherans: & Lauatherus a Zuinglian. And Surius a Catholique.
                  After this agayne in the yere 1564. in the moneth of April, there was a solemne meetinge or sinode betweene the Lutheranes and Caluinists, at Mulbrune in Germanie.

                      And on the Lutheranes parte the duke of wittenberge was president for the temporaltie, & Smidelyne prolocutor for the cleargie. For the Caluinistes was president the Countie palatine of Rheine, & Boquinus was speaker. But after diuers dayes spent in disputing, chafing, & chiding, they departed lesse agreed than before, one parte calling the other sectaries, and heretiques, as you may reade in the actes of that meeting set furth in print,

                      aswell by the one partie, as by the other, but eche side notwithstandinge reportinge the thinge for theyr owne vantage, and blaminge the other. And thus muche for solemne meetings and publique actes of concorde, declaring the singular vnitie of protestants in the gospell.
                  
                  Now for the intercourse of louing letters and godlye vvritings betvvene lutheranes and Caluinists, (whiche M. Charke nameth, but citeth none) for proofe of their singular vnitie. Yt shall appeare how trewe it is, by that whiche I will heere alleage out of their owne writings one against an other. And first, I haue alleaged before the louing woordes of Luther towardes Caluinists by

                        urious deuyll, vvhiche hathe no communion vvith the saincts of God. Luther againe calleth Bucer, a blasphemouse monster of the sacramentarie spirit: and all sacramentaries miserable and blasphemouse heretiques: adding further: I doe protest before God and the vvorlde, that I doe not agree vvith them, nor euer vvill, vvhile the vvorld standeth, but vvill haue my hāds cleare from the bloode of those sheepe, vvhich these heretiques doe dryue from Christe, deceyue, and kill. And againe in the same place, cursed be the charitie and concorde of sacramentaries, for euer and euer, to all eternities. Againe, in an other place he pronounceth of them: H

                        semus, we censure them in earnest for heretiques. And after that, he pronounceth them as moste certainlie to be damned, hovv soeuer they beleeue some articles a-right, and doe pronounce them truelie, vvith their lyeing and blasphemouse mouthe, as his woordes are. And finallie, two yeres before his deathe, he denounced an open excommunication against them all, sayeing, 
                        Luth. in respon. ad maledic. scri. regis Angliae.
                      
                     vvho soeuer vvill not beleeue the breade to be the true and naturall bodie of our lorde, lett hym abstayne from me, bothe by letter, vvriting, and speeche, neyther let hym expect anie communion vvith me, for he shall but leese his labour. And this was the agrement of this holie and learned man Martin Luther (as M. Charke calleth hym.) And this was his entercourse of louynge and godlie speeche and vvritings towardes the Zuinglians: that is, towardes M. Charke and his felowes in England.
                  
                     
                        Of the agreement of Lutheranes & Zuinglians.
                     But now yf a man wolde speake of the entercourse of louinge letters betwene the Lutheranes and Zuinglianes after Luthers deathe: it were infinite. But yet he that desireth to know somewhat thereof: let hym reade but Brentius against Bullinger: westfalus against Caluine: Caluin against Stankarus: Heshutius against Beza. Also the seuerall bookes of Sneppius, Alberus, Timannus, Stolzius, Kemnitius, Marbachius, Vigandus against the Zuinglians. And the vehemēt treatises of Ochinus,



Alasco, Boquinus, Clebitius, Bullinger, and Peter Martyr against the Lutheranes. 
                        This Brentius him selfe testifieth, in recog. proph. & apostol. doctrin. pa. 4. & 64. Caluin. cōt. Iac. vvestfalum.
                      Bullinger calleth Brentius puffed spirit, slaunderer, scurril, iester, Mome, impure, impudent and furiouse Eutychian, light and brainelesse sophist. Caluine writing to the ministers of Germanye, and hoping to gaine them to his parte against westfalus, called them, honorable brothers, & most faithfull seruants of Christ. But when he sawe they tooke part against hym: he calleth them, Knaues, Gyants, Monsters, Beastes, Asses, Deuylls. Heshutius writing against Caluine, calleth hym cruel tyrant, crastie, perfidiouse, and contemptuouse Epicure, rechelesse lyar, vvanton and impudent sycophant, one that handled the scriptures as other men doe Ouids metamorphosis.

                      The same heshutius called Beza, a Beast, a Cyclops, a Harlot set to sale: and generallie all Caluinists, impudent knaues. Stankerus of a thyrde sect, wryteth thus: I doe set more by one Peter Lombard, (whiche notwithstanding he contemneth) than by a hundred Luthers, tvvo hundred Melanctons, three hundred Bullingers: fovver hundred Peter Martyrs, and fyue hundred Caluines: All vvhiche yf they vvere pound together in a morter, and aftervvard prest neuer so hard, you coulde not vvringe ovvt one ovvnce of true diuinitie from them all.
                  
                  It were infinite (as I sayd) to prosecute this matter of the protestants singular vnitie in the gospell: 
                        The praectise of protetestantes loue and vnitie, one tovvardes the other.
                      and of their louing and godly speeches one to an other. But the practise doeth better declare it than woordes can. Looke therfore into the states where they beare rule: and see how one doeth imbrace the other: or rather how one doeth persecute the other. In Germanie where one is superior, the other maye not liue 
                        •
                     ferior. VVithin these eight yeres all were Caluinists in the Countie Palantins Dominions, while he was so hym selfe: and a Lutheran could not be suffered to lyue quietlie there. As appeareth by the example of doctor Heshutius, a Lutherane, who after his disputation in the vniuersitie of Hidelberge, was thrust owt by head and shoulders, and the Catechismes of Luther & Brentius floung out of the Church, 
                        In hist. sacram.
                      as Lauatherus a Zuingliā dothe reporte.



But now this prince beinge come backe to Lutherisme again: out are thrust the Caluinists, aswell there, as also in other places of Germanie, where the Lutheranes are gouernours. The yonger princes of Saxonie and Earles of Mansfeild (being Lutheranes) made a publique decree against all Zuinglians, the yere 1559, condemning them by the name of execrable heretiques, as lauatherus also writeth. And it is well knowen that the duke of Saxonie, that now is (named Augustus) about eight yeres gone dyd cutt of the head of his cheefe counsailer called Cracouie, for that he was conuicted secretlie to fauour the Caluinists, and to practize their brynging into Saxonie. Also the banished Caluinists of fraunce being retyred to frankeforde in Germanie (a free Citie, and of Lutheran religion) hoped to haue license to liue, according to their cōscience, in that place. But they could not, (with all the entreatie and frendshipp they might vse) obtaine the same: but were by bublike edict (bearing date the two & twentith of Aprill, in the yere 1561) cōmaunded to depart the Citie, or els to abstaine wholie from all exercise of their religion, seing it was heresie, and differing from the confession of Augusta. This whole storie is set furth by one Franciscus Philippus, where you may reade it at large.
                  And to gyue you yet an exāple more neare home, our Englishe Marchant venturers had great traffik at Hāborough, & profited (no doubt) the citie much, whereof VVestfalus was superintendent. But yet by all the meanes and fauour that euer they could procure, they could neuer obtaine of the Lutheranes, free exercise of Caluines religion in that citie: No, nor so muche as to keepe a

                      minister of their owne sect at home in their house priuatlie. And (that which is more) the prelates of Saxonie, dyd so muche detest our mens religion, as whē any English men were sick, they wolde not come at them, beynge requested: nor (beinge deade) wolde allowe them anie Christian buriall, in their churches or churche yeardes, but caused them to be 
                        So vvere buried (amōg other) the foresaid Secretarie of the companie, & also the deputie, named Cloughe, vvhich dyed

                            there: At vvhat time the preachers of Hamborough inueighed moste eagerlie against all English men for their religion.
                      cast owt in other places and hydde vnder grounde, without the



presence of any one Lutherane, that wolde come at yt. And finallie our English men haue lost their pryuileiges there, and haue abandoned the citie, and are changed now to Emden. This is euident and true: and all Marchants in England (of that companye) can tell thereof. And therfore what soeuer M. Charke writeth of their singular vnitie in the gospell: the reader may see how he is to be credited.
                  Touching the lyfe of Caluine (whome M. Charke calleth a holie Sainct, and aduaunceth with a long, large,  and copiouse commendation) he sayeth, 
                        Of the lyfe of Iohn Caluine.
                      
                     it vvas the lordes good vvill, that the translation of his lyfe shoulde fall into my Lorde of Londons hands, and so be supressed. But (M. Charke) it maye come yet in time: not as a libell (as you terme it) but as a true testimonie from hym which knew the man, and lyued with hym, bothe in Geneua, Berna, and Lausanna thirtie yeres gone and more, whose name is M. Ierome hermes Bolseke, doctor of phisik: whiche science he practized in Caluines time, 
                        The vvriter of Caluins lyfe.
                      at Geneua and other places there aboute, and of late yeres in lyons, fowre and twentie myles of Geneua, where he yet liueth in great credit of wisdome, learning, and honestie, and is most readie to iustifye any thing that he hathe written to the woorlde. 
                        This booke is intituled A Storie of the Life Manners, Doctrine, and Deathe of. Io. Caluin. His booke of Caluines lyfe was written in the yere of our Lorde 1577, and dedicated to Monsieur of Epinac, archebyshop and Earle of lyons: And in the begynnyng he hathe this protestatiō. I am heere for loue of the trueth to refute Theodore Beza his false and shamefull lyes in the prayse of Caluine, his Maister, protesting before God and all the holie court of heauen, before all the vvolde, and the holie ghoste it selfe: that neyther angre, nor enuie, nor euell vvill, hathe made me speake, or vvrite any one thing against the truthe and my conscience.
                  
                  First therefore this reuerend man sheweth how Iohn Caluine was borne at Nouiodunum, 
                        Iohn Caluins birth.
                      or Noion in Picardie, the yeere of our Lorde 1509. In his youth he was an execrable blasphemour of God: and cōmyng at length by shyftes to be a preest, and to haue the cure of a certaine chappell in Noyon, he was taken and conuicted



of the horrible sinne of Sodomie: and vvas in great daunger to haue bene burnt a lyue for the same,

                      but that the Byshope of Noyon, taking compassion of the man, procured the punishement to be moderated: and so in steade of deathe, he was burnt with a hoote Iron in the showlder, whiche yron had in it the prynt of a lylly, which is the marcke of the crowne of france.

                      shame, (hauing solde awaye his benefice) he departed from Noyon into Germanie and Italie, chaunging his name from Cauuin to Caluin, as Luther dyd from Luder to Luther. Thus muche the whole citie of Noyon, dyd testifye vnto M. Bertilier, Secretarie of the Councel of Geneua, vnder the hand of a publique and sworne Notarie. And the testimonie is yet extant to be sene, as the author sayeth, whoe hathe read it, with many others.
                  After he had wandered a while in Italie, being assisted with some almes of the duches of ferrara, he returned back to Basil, Strausburge, and Lausanna, and beganne to play the minister and preacher: And from thence, he came to Geneua: and there ioyning with two moste seditious ministers, named 
                        Caluins firste assistants in Geneua.
                      FAREL & CAVRALD, beganne by a thowsand deuises, to woorke great tumults, and innouations in the citie. And albeit, not onelie the magistrates of Geneua, but also the Lordes of Berna (who haue some superioritie ouer Geneua) were greatlie against hym at the begynning, (though Zuinglians them selues) yet Caluin ceased not to vse suche excitation of the people against thē, as they were fayne to banish hym oute of their terretorie: And so they dyd and pronunced the same sentence of banishement, bothe in theyr priue coouncell of two hundred, & also in their generall councell: and caused it to be registred in their recordes called the Rouge, with the true causes of the same, the yere of our Lorde a thousand, fyue hundred thertie seuen, the two and twentith of April, being Easter monday. 
                        Caluin banished frō Geneua.

same daye from Geneua to Strawsburge. And this is extant vnder the publique recordes of the citie (as I haue sayed) though Beza hath not bene a shamed to publish the contrarie.
                  But in processe of tyme, by infinite practyzes that the vsed, and by the earnest sute of some noble men, bothe duche and frenshe, whome he had made Caluinists: he was recalled to Geneua againe. And thē, layeing a surer plott than before, (by bringing in many straungers into Geneua,) he made his partie so strong, as he became as absolute lorde of the towne, while he lyued, cutting of all his enemies by deuises & sleights:

                      as Castellio, Caroly, Bernardin Ochin, and Peter Morand, Ministers, whome he caused to be banished: as also diuerse of the nobilitie: and among them, Perrinus, chefe gouernour of the citie with Petrus VVandalus, the Balthasars, and others, whome he made to flye for safegarde of their lyues: for that he (by forged letters & infinite other inuentions) had brought them in suspitiō of betrayeing the citie, first to the king of fraunce, then to the duke of Alvay, gouuernour of Millan. But the noble men goeing to Berna cleared them selues before the Councell there: 
                        Caluins brood haue not forgotten this tricke.
                      and by good happe got the Italian, which, suborned by Caluin, had accused them of treasō in Geneua, affirming that he was sēt as a spie frō the Duke of Alvay, to vewe the citie, & to treate with those noble men, for the takyng therof: and hauing affirmed thus muche, he was sent awaye pryuilie into Italie againe, disguised in apparell, and his rewarde payde hym in his purse. VVhereof these noble men hauing intelligence by their secret frendes of Geneua, caused the way to be layd for hym, and (by gods prouidence 
                        •

VVherevpon the Lordes of Berna gaue furthe a publique testimonie, (vnder their common notaries hand) of the whole matter, and of the innocencie of these men.



But yet Caluins faction of straungers was so strong in Geneua, as they could neuer be restored during his life.

As against Montouset a Lutheran, (Almner to the Queene of Nauarra,) Caluines cheefe benefactrix,) whome he made to flye Geneua, for speaking a woord or two against his partiall distribution of the Queens almes,

Also against one Peter Ameau, whome he made to walke throroughe the citie naked in his shirt, with a torche in his hand, and to aske hym openlie forgiuenesse, for that he had spoken at a supper certaine woordes in his dishonour, sayeing, that he dyd not see why Caluin should be so muche estemed in Geneua, as he was, and preferred before all other that euer wrote. Also against Seruetus, otherwise called Michaell villanouanus, doctor of phisik in Vienna of dolphinie, an heretique, but yet enuious of Caluins glorie: vvherevpon he wrote from vienna to Geneua, thirtie epistles directed to Caluin, together with a litle booke in written hand, the yere of our Lorde 1546: wherein he had gathered together certaine faultes escaped Caluin in his institutions.

But Seruetus not trusting his woordes, kept hym selfe thence, vntill the yere of our Lord, 1553: at what tyme, meanyng to goe into Italie, he thought to passe secretlie throrough Geneua, & to staye there but one night, which was Saturday. But yet being wearie, and knoweing the lawes of Geneua to be, that no passingers may be molested for three dayes, resolued to stay there Sonday. VVhereof Caluin by chaunce hauing



secret intelligence, presentlie sent his man Nicholas to arrest hym: & the next daye, he sent his brother Anthonie Cauuin to enter an action of deathe against hym: 
                        Heretiks doe holde one doctrine no longer then it seruethe theyr turnes.
                      which action Iohn Caluin folowed bothe by hym selfe and by his frendes so vehementlye, as within few dayes after, he caused Seruetus to be burnt alyue in the marquet place, with a soft fyar for his greater torment. VVhereat many protestants were offended and greuouslie skandallized: for that Caluin had set furthe a booke a litle before, to proue that no heretique ought to be put to deathe for his religion.
                  Now for other behauiour of Caluin, 
                        Caluins ambition and vayne glorye.
                      as for his intolerable ambition and pryde, there are many examples geuen: as that, to make hym selfe famouse he deuised diuerse letters, and other woorkes in prayse of hym selfe, and published them vnder the name of one Galasius & others: and sending them to PETRVS VIRETVS minister of Lausanna to be spread abrode by hym: he being well acquainted with Caluins style, espied the deuise, and was greatly offended therwith, and wrote to Caluin, that he wolde discredit hym selfe by suche doeings. But Caluin answered, that it was expedient it should be so done, for-the credit of theyre cause: and that he meant to vvrite shortlie as muche in the commendation of VIRETVS hym selfe, and FARELVS also, VVherwith VIRETVS was pacifyed. These letters with one and fowertie more were found in the studdie of viretus (after his runnyng away from Lausanna) and shewed to the Lords of Berna: who coulde neuer abyde Caluin after warde, for this manifest declaration of his vainglorie and pryde. The same Caluin, after he had brokē downe the images, & rased the pictures of Christ and all Saints in Geneua: he caused his owne picture to be drawne, and set vp in diuerse places of the citie: and vsed also to gyue litle pictures and images of hym selfe to gentlewomen, and gentlemen to carrie about their necks. And when one tolde hym, that some thought muche of this: 
                        A holye ansvvere,
                      he answered: he that can not abyde yt, let hym brust for enuye.

                           Caluins raysing of a deade man.
                        
                     An other example of his intolerable pryde & vain-glorie is this that foloweth. One called Brulle of the towne of Ostune, being made a protestant, came with his wyfe to dwell at Geneua, and for that he was but poore, he procured many letters in his commendation to Caluin, for his releefe of the common purse, which he obtained. And being therby, made a fast frende vnto hym, and verie familiar: Caluin on a time bracke with hym and his wyfe, in a matter of great secrecie, whiche might turne the gospell to great credit, and them selues to great gaine, if they wolde doe it faythfullie. And this was, that the husband shoulde feyne hym selfe sicke, & so to dye, and that he wolde seeme (by the woord of the Lord) to rayse hym agayne. VVhiche they were cōtent to doe And so all circunstances being agreed vpon, and the daye appoynted for his death, yea and the verie howre: Iohn Caluin that day inuited of purpose, many gentlemen to dynner, & after dynner walked owt with them, and kept hym selfe alwayes neare the doore of that feined sick man, 
                        Intollerable hypocrisie.
                      for whome he had caused muche prayer to be made in the citie. At last when the hower was come, the good wyfe came owt cryeing, that her husband was deade. VVhervpon Caluin requested the gentlemen to goe in and see hym. And there, he falling downe on his knees, as rapt with zeal, begāne to praye vehemently, and to trouble hym selfe in spirit, after the imitatiō of Christ, 
                        Ioh. 11. & 13. desiring the rest to praye with hym, whiche they dyd. And then Caluin breaking owt in great feruour, desired the Lord for more manifestation of his gospell, to restore that man to lyfe againe, & therwith in great vehemencye tooke the man by the hand, and willed hym agayne, & agayne, in the Lords behalfe to ryse. But he moued not, vvherat the good wyfe maruailing, remoued quickely the clothe from his face, and fownd hym bothe deade and colde: at which sight she beyng greuouslie astonished, cryed owt, that her husband was murdred, and falling into a rage, ranne vpon Caluin, exclaming that he was a deceyuer, & so opened the whole matter to the standers by: whoe remayned



muche amazed to heare her tell suche particulars, as she dyd, but yet for not discrediting the cause, they rebuked her: but shee continued cryeinge owt still. Caluin sayde, she was madde, or else the deuyll was entred vpon her, and so left bothe her and the house. But yet soone after, he caused her to be banished the citie, and to stoppe her tongue the sooner, she was maryed to a minister, named Cowldrye, abowt Ostune. But yet all that sufficed not to staye her speeche, but that euer more she continued in the same tale.

Ex cap. 14.Touching the lasciuiouse dealing of this prophet, there be many examples put downe in the booke, gyuing open signes of his loose behaueour, and importing great suspitiō of fowle dishonestie, bothe with man and woman kynde, thoghe he had alwayes a wenche of his owne. His dyet was verie dayntie, bothe for rare meates, choyse wynes, varietie of dishes, and furniture of seruice.

                      And when he wolde shew so muche fauour to any man, as to goe furth and dyne or suppe with hym a brode, alwayes a siluer pott of his owne wyne must be caryed with hym, for his owne mouth. He had also a baker that made breade of purpose for hym onelye, of fine flower wette in rose water, & myngled with sugar, Cynomome, and Aniseseeds, beside a singular kynde of Biskette made for hym selfe alone. And this was so knowne ower all Geneua, that, all excellent bread was cōmonlye compared to the bread of Monsieur Caluin. VVhereof the Lordes of Berna hauing good information,

                      were greatlie scandalized and offended, thinking that neuer any of the olde prophets tooke such care of their bodies as this new prophet dyd. By which means he came to be so wanton with woman kynde, as many scādalouse things fell owt,

This man being verie sicklie in Geneua, and muche in the Phisitians handes, wolde haue Monsieur Caluin come and visit hym often, which he willinglie dyd, but more for the wyues sake than for the mans, as appeared after: for



besides many significations of his good will towardes her: in the ende he opened hym selfe fullie vnto her, telling her in great secrecie, that this man vvas but a burden vnto her novv, and coulde doe her no more seruice, being rather as a dead man than alyue. VVherfore (sayeth he) yf you vvill folovv my counsail, lett hym goe (ladye Iolland,) and he beyng dead, vve tvvo, vve tvvo, vvill marry together. VVhiche the ladye tooke in great disdayne, and for auoyding of further inconueniēce persuaded her husband to forsake Geneua presentlie, and to goe to Lausanna: where they being arriued, she opened the whole cause and matter vnto hym, & to many other her frendes besides.

And he sayeth, that he hathe done it in the time of Beza yet lyuing, to the ende he may refute it, yf any thing be sayd amysse. 
                        Ierome her mes Bolsec. in his book of the lyfe and manners of Theodore Beza.
                      First therfore, to lett passe other insinite things: he sheweth how Beza was borne at vezels in fraunce, whose father was lyeuetenant for the king in that citie, and when he came to dye, seyng the moste wicked disposition of his sonne, gaue to hym his curse, and vnder the hand of a publique notarie, and in presence of many witnesses, dyd disinherit hym, and disclame hym for his sonne. Yet had he brought hym vp in studye of learning, bothe at Paris and Orleans, & had procured hym to be made prior of Lōgiumey. But he sawe that he turned all to wickednesse, without hope of amendement. 
                        He begāne as his mayster Caluine dyd.
                      And albeit he abounded in all kynde of vice: Yet the excesse of carnall synnes dyd passe all other in hym, wherwith he dyd not onely offend God hym selfe, but infected also all other whose company he vsed. This appeareth (beside other testimonyes) by an infamouse Epigrame reade in comparison of the two sinnes, of adulterie and Sodomie, and betwene a boye which he abused, and a mans wyfe of Paris that he kept in dishonestie: the boye he calleth AVDEBERTVS, & the harlot CANDIDA, 
                        Beza his dishonest Epigram.
                      though her true name were Claudia. The Epigram begynneth thus: Abest Candida, Beza quid moraris? Audebertus abest, quid hic moraris? And then he goeth on, examinyng which sinne he may loue best, & in the ende preferreth the horrible sinne of Sodomie with his boye, before the pleasure of his harlot Cādida. And he dyd not onelie make these fylthie verses, but also dyd put thē in print, the yere 1548 vnder his owne



name, and Robert Stephanus of Paris dyd prynte them.
                  VVhereat the Councell of Paris was so much offended, that an arrest was graunted furthe to apprehend Beza. 
                        The manner of Beza his vocation to the ghospel.
                      VVhich he vnderstanding of, fyrst of all, solde his Priorie for redye money in hand: and then presentlie (before the matter was knowen,) dyd lett out the same to other fermers for fyue yeres, taking also money before hand. VVhen he had done this: he stole awaye, and came secretlie from vezels to Paris, & there agreed with Cādida (which was a Taylers wyfe, dwelling in Calēder streete) & she stealing what she coulde from her husbād ranne with hym to Geneua: where they were receyued by Caluin, and much made of, and Beza soone after placed by hym, as cheefe minister and publique reader of diuinitie in Lausanna.
                  VVhen this was knowen, the parties to whome Beza had solde and leased his priory, fell together by the eares, who shoulde haue it, and muche money was spent about the sute, in the court of Paris. The poore Tailer, whoe had lost his wyfe, (and some goodes besides) coulde not tell which waye to looke, nor where to complaine. Afterward, in the yere 1561, when the kyng of Fraunce had graunted a free disputation to the protestants at Poysie,

But the fermers making more freendes, thē the tayler could, got a hundred crounes delyuered them, by the handes of one MATHEVV LAVNOY a minister, & one of their cheefest disputers at that tyme, but sence returned to the Catholique faithe, hath opened their dealinges, in many bookes.
                  Monsieur Beza beyng now in credit in Geneua, and reader of diuinitie in Lausanna, folowed his olde

And then he caused a poore yong man that was a barboure to come vnto hym, and persuaded hym to take a grosse quantitie of bloode from Claudia the mayde, and moreouer to gyue her a strong purgation, whiche he dyd: and therevpon she was soone after delyuered of her childe deade, whiche they buryed in that gardyne, as the same barbour afterward confessed,

                      and the authour hearde it from his owne mouthe. But in this meane space, whilest those, things were in doeinge, Beza (to couer matters, and to deceyue the people the more,) made certayne spiritual songs of the great paynes, whiche he suffered by vehemencie of the plague, and sent them to be printed at Geneua, where as in deede he was not syck at all.
                  After this trouble of Child byrth vvas past, Beza with his maister Caluin, as long as he lyued, and after his death, he alone, imployed hym selfe to all kynde of wickednesse, not onelie at home, but also abrode. And first the conspiracie, for taking the yong king of Frāce at Amboise was contriued from Geneua, and one Villemongis a noble man (fledde from digieon in France a litle before, for counterfaiting the kings brode seale) was sent from Geneua, as cheefe in this matter. And after that, infinite treasōs appeared from Geneua: as for the taking of Lions, Orleās, Poytiers, and other Cities: 
                        The Duke of Gu

                      whiche all, or the moste part, came from Beza his heade, as diuerse parties executed haue confessed. Also sone after, he deuised the death of the noble Duke of Guise, and committed the execution thereof to one Pultrot, whoe dyd it in deede, at the onelie motion and persuasion



of Beza, as he openlie protested at his deathe. And at the verie same tyme, to styrre men vp the more to sedition, he putt furth diuerse moste poysoned bookes, intituled by diuerse names as for example, one called the frensh furies: 
                        Seditious bookes sett foorthe by Beza.

Also, the lyfe of S. Katheryne of Florence, whiche in shew, is onelye an infamouse Libell against the Queens mother of fraunce, but in deede is a defacing, and most opprobriouse infaming of the king, and all the nobilitie, that are not Caluinists.
                  And as this man was busie a brode, so was he not Idle at home, in establyshing his owne dominion, in Geneua. For which respect, he caused Merlyn, the cheefest learned minister of that citie, and in deede farre better learned than hym selfe, 
                        Beza his tyrannye. in Geneua.
                      namely in the tongues, to be deposed from his ministerie, & to voyde the citie. The like he dyd by an other called Gaigneur, and for the same purpose, he caused the Lord of Pacye (though a protestant) to leese his head, without all cause, foloweing herein his Maister Caluin, whoe had a facilitie in cutting of all them which any way resisted hym. For this ende also he ioyned gladlie with all straungers, that fledd to that citie, for the same or lyke causes as he had done him selfe: that is, for horrible wickednesse. For that he was sure, that suche men durst neuer goe home againe, and therfore must nedes be fast freendes vnto hym: that is, as he calleth them Zelous folowers of the ghospell. So the fore named Ville-mongis flyeing to Geneua for hauing counterfayted the kyngs seale (as I haue sayd) became most Zelous vpon the sodaine: 
                        The furniture of Geneua for the gospell.
                      So one Nicholas hanuoyre, marchant in Anwerp, runninge away with three thowsād poundes of other mēs goods, fledd to Geneua, and was receiued ioyfuly, and assoyled from restitution, and his daughter maried to Anthonie Cauuin, Iohn Caluins brother. So the Ladye of Clells in Dolphinie runnyng awaye in her husbands absence, with one countie Iulio of Atien, an Italian, whoe had



bene naught with her before: she came to Geneua bringyng with her as muche goodes of her husbands as she coulde gett, and although her husband, the Lorde of Clells, pursued her and claymed iustice at Geneua, both against her, and the adulterer: yet coulde he gett none, but onelie the consistorie of ministers, vpon deliberation determined that he might marye againe, when he coulde gett an other wyfe, for that he was neuer like to haue this, being now more fytt for Countie Iulio than for hym.
                  The like happened in one Contour, a notable adulterer, whoe toke awaye the wyfe of one Pise, a Citizen of Mascon, and brought her to Geneua, and nether the Citizen nor anye freends that euer he coulde make, could gett anye iustice or restitution of that wyfe: but that vnder pretence of zeale to the gospell, bothe were maintayned in Geneua, against all reason, conscience, & honestie, she hauing left many childrē with her former husband, desolate by her departure. And all this is done by the counsaile, doctrine, and authoritie of Monsieur Beza now in Geneua: whoe hauing entered there with his maister Caluin for refuge of their fylthe, (as hath bene declared) haue reformed the Citie to their owne humours, & haue made yt a receptacle for all desperat and monstruouse malefactors in the worlde.

And surelie they ought to haue bene so. For we neuer reade synce God had first a churche, that he made reformation in the same, (such as you pretend,) but by rare & singular vertuouse men.

                      increasers, and perfecters of all the reformation whiche now you haue in England. The first of all, was Luther: whose vocatiō lyfe and doctrine hathe in part bene touched before: and he cōfesseth expresselye hym selfe,

                  The first of these three beinge archedeacon of wittenberge was thought so euell a man by Luther hym selfe, COROLOSTADIVS. as was vnworthie to lyue amongest Christians, and so by his procurement, he was banished out of all the dominions of the Duke of Saxonie, An. 1525. and so ended his lyfe miserablie in labouring the grounde, OECOLAMPADIVS. as your owne historiographer Sleidan writeth lib. 5.

Charke) aboue others haue greatlie to reioyse, for that you shew your selfe in your replie a moste zealous Puritane.
                  But now after all these matters discussed, M. Charke, to discredit all that hitherto had bene sayde, bringeth in a false reporte of Lyndan (as he sayeth) touching the fowle deathe of Martin Bucer,

                  VVhat soeuer his deathe was, Martin Luther writeth that he was a verie vntrue and wicked man:

yea, (more then that) that he was a verie Monster. And for his constancie in doctrine, you haue litle cause to bragge so of hym. For first, of a Dominican fryar he became a Lutheran. After that, he bacame a Zuinglian, as appeareth ep. ad Norimb. ep. ad Essingenses: And thirdlie, in the Sinod Holden at Luthers house in wittenberge the yere 1536, he came backe agayne to be a Lutheran, recantinge openlie bothe the article of baptisme of infants to be vnnecessarie: (as he had written before vppon the third chapiter of S. Mathewes gospell) and also the article of the supper, as he testifieth of hym selfe, vpon the sixt of Iohn: and 26. of Mathew, VVhere he asketh pardon also of God and of the Churche, for that he deceyued so manye with the heresie of Zuinglius, as he calleth yt: and yet notwitstanding, a litle before in his epistle to them of Norimberge, he affirmeth the doctrine of Zuinglius to be moste diuine, and deliuered immediatlye by Christ from heauen:

                      and Luthers doctrine to be new, and repugnant to the scriptures. Also in his epistle ad Essingenses he calleth the Lutheranes, fanatical and furiouse teachers. But dyd this thyrd or fowerth recantation holde, thinke you? no surelie. For cōming into England, he bacame a Zuinglian agayne, (as you will not denye) and in that opinion dyed, as you saye: but I thinke he might dye a Iewe well enough, as pontacus writeth, for any reason I see to the contrarie. For he, whiche had so many times chaunged his faythe, seemeth to haue had no religion at all (by lykelyhode) in his harte, and therfore might easilie bothe dowt and wauer, not on

                      adding notwithstanding for preuenting of after clappes, that he promised not to myngle no sillables of his owne: nor to delyuer the scripture, in precise wordes as it lyethe, but rather as he sayeth, in full weight of true sense and matter. And thervpon he maketh a solemne protestation of his true dealing. But I will shew and proue, (notwithstanding this hypocrisie,) that, admitting this libertie whiche M. Charke requireth, of chopping and chaunging in his reportes: yet, that he is a false man, and malitiouslie meant to deceyue in the same: And yf I proue not this, let me be taken for false my selfe. And I doe moste willinglie stand to my offer made before, which M. Charke taketh holde of, that yf these reportes, as they are here layde downe, and denyed by vs, can be verified, eyther in woordes or true sense against the Iesuits: lett all be beleued which they speake dayly against vs.
                  And that you may take some foresight of M. Charks vntrue meanyng euen now at the begynning: his falshoode appeareth first in that, 
                        Diuers vvayes vvherby M Charkes falshode appeareth.
                      he citing his reports owt of an other mā, against the Iesuits, without seing their book, (as he sayeth,) dyd not in all the whole discourse so muche as once name, or quote his author Gotvisus, eyther in text or Margent: the cause whereof shall appeare after. And albeit he now sayeth, that Gotvisus



was quoted in most of his bookes: yet I dare scarse beleeue hym, for that I coulde neuer yet happen vpō any that had hym quoted: And yf some had it, whye not all? Secondlie,

                      he had seene the most of these reportes set downe by kēnitius against the Iesuits, (from whome it seemeth that Gotuisus borowed them) and refuted by Payuas a learned Portugall, and conuinced of so manyfest forgerie & falshoode, as kemnitius to my knoulege durst neuer to defend them agayne, nor anie other for hym. How then coulde M. Charke without shameles false meanyng, laye downe the verye same reportes againe without namyng his authour, or seing the booke whēce they were cited, especially hauing (besides many other) Canisius a Iesuit before his eyes in England:

                      whiche teacheth the verie contrarie, as after shall be shewed? Thyrdlie, his author Gotuisus in the moste of these reportes citeth not onelye the Censure of Colen, but also the large Catechisme of Canisius for his proofe, whiche was common in England to be seene, and wherby M. Charke muste nedes know that Gotuisus slaundered the Iesuits most impudentlie. For couering whereof M. Chark not onelie suppressed the quotation of Canisius, and cited onelye the Censure of Colen (whiche he knewe was not to be had in England) but also supressed his cheefe Author Gotuisus hym selfe (which no writer vseth in suche matters of importāce) to the end the reader might not by hym learne out the quotations of Canisius, and thereby discouer the falshoode. And this was the true cause of the omission of Gotuisus his name. And is not this moste willfull treacherie? Lastely, M. Charke, as not contented with this, doeth help out often tymes the reportes of Gotuisus (being but short and breef sentences) with new falsifications, of his owne, or with fraudulent recitall, when they seeme not of them selues to sounde absurdlie enough against the Iesuits. And can this be excused frō malitiouse and false meanyng? Now thē let vs see whether these things be so in deede or no.
               
            
            
               
               Of the nature and definition of sinne. The first Article.
               
               
                  THE CENSVRE.
                  First therfore, you report the Iesuits to saye: It is not sinne what soeuer is against the woord

                         of God. Censura Colon. leafe 44. (1.) These voordes are guylefullie  reported, peeced and culled out for your purpose of a large discourse, and yet most true in their sense. The occasion vvhereof vvas this. One Monhemius a Lutheran, against vvhose Catechisme this Censure of Colen vvas made, vvolde nedes proue Concupiscence, remayning after baptisme, to be a mortall sinne, albeit no consent of hart vvere gyuen vnto the same: & for proofe therof, he brought in this definition of sinne: A faultie definition. of sinne. 
                     Sinne is what soeuer repugneth to the lawe of God, The vvhich definitiō, the Censure of Colen affirmeth uot to be in all respectes perfecte, but that diuerse vvordes should be added to the same: as for exāple, in steade of that he sayeth (Sinne is vvhat soeuer &c.) (2.) He should haue sayd, Sinne is an action: for that  there be diuerse things vvhiche repugne against the lavv of God, as euill men, euill lavves, the deuills, and the like, vvhiche not vvithstanding are not properlie sinnes: for that they are not actions. (3.) Secondlie he  s

For yf a mad man, a foole, or a beaste, should committ an acte prohibited by gods lavve (as for example kill a mā:) it vvere properlie no sinne (4.) Thirdlie he should  haue added (voluntarie:) for yf a man should doe a naughtie acte against his vvill, as the virgins vvhiche vvere rauished by violence in the primatiue Churche dyd, it vvere not synne. Lastlie, he s

                     That these wordes are guilefullie reported out of the Iesuits doctrine, maye appeare by this example. A learned counsailer hauing discoursed vpon the lawes of our lande, and shewed that albeit, all breache of publique lawes doeth tende against the Prince and cō
                     mon wealth (as in dede it doeth:) Yet euery suche trāsgression is not treason, but some felonie, some trespasse, some no offence at all, being done without malice, will, or knoulege: wolde you not think hym a maliciouse wrangler, that should come and frame this odious proposition vpon the others large discourse, it is not treason, vvhat so euer is against the Prince and common vvealthe? For, albeit these woords may be verifyed in a good sense (as the Censure sayeth of M. Charkes report) yet, being layd downe barelie without sheweing the occasion and discourse, they sownde odiouslie, as though what soeuer were done against the Prince and common wealthe were no treason. In like sorte deale these heretiques with the Iesuits, who doe shew, that albeyt euery synne doeth repugne the lawe of God: yet euery thing that so repugneth is not equally synne, but some veniall, some mortall synne, and some no synne at all, yf it be without will or consent: as the first motions of concupiscende are. VVherevpon our aduersaries come and frame this odiouse proposition,



before sett downe: to witt, it is not synne vvhat soeuer is against the vvord of God: without expoundinge how and in what sense it was spoken.
                  And to lett you see M. Charks nypping and shufling in this one litle line to make it sownd more odious,

                           uis. pa. 245. thā ether kemnitius or Gotvisus (frō whome he tooke it,) doe delyuer the same: The Iesuites wordes are reported by them thus: the Iesuits (say they) in their definition of synne, do saye, Peccatum est, non quicquid legi dei repugnat, Sed &c. Synne is, not what soeuer repugneth the lawe of God, but &c. And then foloweth the rest of the Iesuits definition, towched in the Censure. And thus is it reported by M. Charks Maisters. But he, to make it seme more absurde in ignorant mens eares, layeth it downe absolutelie thus: yt is not sinne vvhat soeuer is against the vvorde of God. As thoughe the sentence ended there. Also as though it were no parte of a definition. Againe, he chaungeth the place of the negation, whiche in framing of propositions altereth often the sense. 
                        Arist. lib. peri herminias.
                      So: for peccatum est, non quicquid &c. he sayethe non est peccatum quiquid &c. And lastely, for repugneth the lavve of God: he putteth, It is against the vvoorde of God. And all this to helpe out a litle suspition of absurde doctrine in the Iesuits: whiche argueth in hym a dishonest intention: thoughe for the doctrine it selfe in the Iesuits meaning, I thinke the Censure hathe sufficientlie defended it: and what soeuer M. Charke hath therto replied, shall now be examined: notinge by the waye, that M. Charkes common, and onelie refuge of credit, to saye, vve muste eyther absolutelie graunt, or absolutelie deny all these propositions (fathered on the Iesuites) is ridiculous and moste vayne. For we admitt so muche of them, as ether in woorde or sense the Iesuits euer vttered: and the rest eyther coyned, falsified, wrested, or otherwise abused by you, we turne home agayne with shame vpon your selues.
                  But now to the defence of the Iesuits definition of sinne, against whiche M. Charke hathe dyuers impertinent obiections, whiche serue to spend tyme, but yet



they must be answered (
                        VVhether sinne be an acte or no.
                     ) First then, to proue that sinne is no acte, he obiecteth, that iniustice is a sinne, and yet no acte To whiche I answer, that iniustice maye betaken for an acte, and so properly a sinne, as yf a man wolde saye yt was great iniustice to putt to deathe so innocent and learned men, as M. Campian was, & those that dyed with hym: heere iniustice signifieth an iniust acte. But yf you take iniustice for an habite onelye: that is, onelie for a procliuitie, or facilicie to an iniust acte:

Iul. pelag. cap. 18. then you must learne, that aswell this, as all other euell habits are called by diuines vitia, non peccata, vices and not sinnes. For that an euell habit may be in a man without sinne, except by consent to yt he bringe furth an euell acte: as S Augustin proueth in the habit or procliuitie to dronkennes, contracted before a mans conue
                        •
                     sition, and remaining after the same, it is no sinne except it bring furthe some acte of dronkennes, ethe
                        •
                      in consent or operation. And the lyke is to be sayde of all other euyll habites or inclinations, whiche may remayne in the mynde, without any acte: and consequ

                        Cap. 14. de trin. cap. 7. as experience teacheth: and as S. Austen also proueth in an other place. For in a good man after his conuersion, there may remayne euyll habites, called vitia, as procliuitie to lye, to steale, to carnall sinne, or the lyke: and yet are they no sinnes, except they bring furthe some acte, ether of consent in harte, or of operation in worke. So that you see, how iniustice (as it is an habit, that is, onelye an inclination or procliuitie to doe vniustlie) may be in a man withoute sinne. For that it is no sinne of it selfe, withoute an acte, as hathe bene shewed. And this point perhappes you learned not before.

Secondlie, you obiect agaynst this first member, that the synne of omission is a synne: as where Hely was punished for not chastising his children, and the watchemen condemned for omitting to sounde the trompette, whiche notwitstanding was no action, saye you. This is a common obiection, borowed of our owne schoolemen, and answered by the same. Euery omission



that is a sinne (M. Charke) implyeth some action, that is cause, ether directlie or indirectlie of that omission,

                           Euery omission includethe an acte.
                        
                      and so is principall part of the sinne: as S. Chrisostome, Ambrose, and Basil doe proue. I saye directlie or indirectlie: and I wyll gyue examples of bothe. First then I saye, that I beynge bounde (for example sake) to goe to churche at a certaine hower, I maye make a resolution with my selfe, that I will not goe: and then this acte of resolution in my mynd, called no litio, is the direct cause of this omission, and the ground of the sinne. And this was the sinne of Hely, and of the watchemen before mentioned: whereof: the one determined not to punishe his childeren, and the other not to sounde the trompet, though they sawe the enemie comming, as the text sheweth. Secondlie, I may omitt this goeing to the churche at the hower appointed, not vpon any resolution made to the contrarie: but for that I doe sett my selfe to doe some other action at that time, (as to write, or the lyke) whereby I doe occupie vp the time wherein I should goe to churche, and so doe committ that omission without any particular resolution, that I will not goe: and in this case the action of writing, cōmitted in the tyme when I should haue gone to churche, is the indirect cause of this omission, and the grounde of the same, being done wittinglie at suche time as it should not. And so we see that euery omission includeth an act, ether directly or indirectly, goeing before, and causing the sayd omission. As also appeareth playnlye by the

                  And that whiche M. Charke addeth for ouer throw of my instances, sayeing: that not deuills, but the euill in deuills not euill men but the euill in men doeth repugne against the lavve of god, ys too too chyldysh and absurd to come from hym that professe the Learnyng For I am sure there is no yong scholler, whiche hathe studyed Logik in Cambrige, but knoweth that, actio tribuitur toti concreto, & non ac
                           •
                        identi inhaerenti: that action is attributed



to the whole cōcret, and not to the accident inherēt. Althoughe the accident inherent be ratio formalis of the action. As for example: the phisitian is sayd to cure his patient, and not the Phisick in the phisitian, though he doe it by his phisick. The vniust iudge synneth in gyuing wronge sentence, and not the iniustice in the iudge, & for proofe wherof, the iudge shalbe damned, and suffer tormentes for it, and not the qualitie of iniustice in hym. The lyke is in deuills, and in all euyll men, whoe doe properlie repugne against gods lawes, and doe sinne properlie, and not the euill within them. And the contrarie thereof is olde heresie, as may appeare by S. Augustin writing against some that sayd,

Charke imagineth) that all things were created good by God. For God created not lucifer a deuyll, but a good Angell: nether Herod an euill man, but a good. Theyre owne lewdnesse made them euyll. Therfore, albeit wicked men and deuylls be euill, and doe repugne the lawe of God: yet the creatures of God are not euill, at leastwise as they are creatures of God: for that, God (as I haue sayde) created them not euill.

                     Secondlie you reprehend, that I call sinne an humane or reasonable action: and you wolde rather call yt (as you saye) an vnreasonable action, whiche argueth in you some lack of reason. For what? doeth not all electiō bothe good and badde procede of reason? doeth it not procede ab intellectu practico, whiche is the seate of discourse and reason, as the philosopher proueth? is M. Charke so vnlearned in all foundation of philosophie? Doeth not S. Augustin proue of purpose, that peccatum fit ab anima rationali, that sinne procedeth frō the minde endewed with reason? againe, that consentio ad peccatum fit in ratione? that consent to sinne is made in reasō? what saye you by the good morall woorkes of the gentils, as their iustice, theyr temperance, and the like, whiche you (though falsely) doe Iudge to be sinnes, for that they proceded not of faith? were they all vnreasonable



actions? But you obiect against this owt of S. Paul vvhat so euer is not of faithe is sinne: therfore, (saye you) vvhether it be reasonable or vnreasonable it is sinne.

                      that he meaneth, who soeuer doeth a thing against that whiche faith prescribeth, that is, against a mans owne conscience and iudgement, he sinneth. But yet, that all morall good woorkes of infideles (as iustice, liberalitie, & the like) were not sinnes, S. Augustin proueth at large against M. Charke lib. de spir. & lit. ca. 26.27. and 28. And S. Ierom. in cap. 29. Ezechielis. Finallie, to returne and conclude our purpose, S. Aug. proueth against the Manaches, 
                        Cont. secūd. Manach. c. 15. & 16. that, peccatum est defectus voluntarius animae rationalis. Synne is a voluntarie defect of a reasonable mynde, and therfore is it a resonable action.
                  But what doe I talke of voluntarie? 
                        VVhether sinne be voluntarie.
                      M. Charke denyeth synne to be voluntarie. VVhat shall I saye? It were infinit to stand and proue euery principle of diuinitie against so peruerse and obstinate a man. And thē prouerbe is common: a long eared creature maye denie more in an hower, than the best learned in the worlde can proue in a yere.

                     Sinne is an euill so voluntarie, as it can be by no meanes sinne, except it be voluntarie. And Christ hym selfe proueth the matter euidentlie, when he sayeth: that those thinges vvhiche doe defile a man doe come from the hart. Matth. 15. v. 18. But yet heere M. Charke hath two obiections. First, originall sinne is not voluntarie, (sayth he) ergo all sinne is not voluntarie. This albeit (it be not to the purpose: the Cēsure talking onelie of actuall sinne, as it professeth:) yet is it moste false, and neuer diuine sayde so before VVilliam Charke, but onelie the pelagians, whoe therby



wolde haue taken awaye originall sinne from infants (as hauing no will) as S. Augustin testifieth: 
                        Li. 3. cont. Iulian. c. 5. whiche (as well in that place, as in the first booke of his retractations. c. 13.) he proueth moste leardnedlie, that originall sinne is voluntarie in vs, by the first voluntarie acte of our first father, 
                        Hovv originall sinne is voluntarie
                      in whiche acte we all dyd sinne voluntarilie, (that beinge an vniuersall acte of all mankynde contained in Adam) as also the Apostle confirmeth, sayeing of Adam, In quo omnes peccauerunt: Rom. 5. In whome all haue sinned.
                  
                     Numb. 35.His second obiection is of the citie of refuge, appointed by God among the Israelites, for them that had killed a man vnwillinglie, whereof he wolde inferre, that vnwilling manslaughter is a sinne. But I am ashamed of M. Charke, that professinge skill in scriptures, doeth so ignorantlie alleage them, against theyr playne meaninge, and against hym selfe. For that chapiter sheweth at large, how these cities of refuge were appointed amonge the leuits, 
                        The causes of the cities of refuge.
                      for indifferent triall of manslaughter, leaste the next of kynne to hym whiche was slayne, (called there the reuenger of bloode) shoulde reuenge the acte vppon the kyller, before the matter were tried. But when the thing was now examined in the citie of refuge, by sufficient witnesses, as the scripture appointeth: then yf it were fownd that the slaughter was committed willinglie, and of hatred: then the murderer was delyuered into the hands of the reuenger of bloode, to be slayne for the same. 
                        Slaughter done vvith out consent of vvill is innocentie.
                      But of vnwillinglie and without malice: liberabitur innocens de vltoris manu sayeth the text: the innocent shalbe deliuered frō the hand of the reuenger. But yet he shall not departe from that citie vntill the deathe of the high pryest. For that, 
                        In Isaaco colligato. Rab. Moys. in Morech. Neuo çh. li. 3. ca. 40. Rab. Leui. ī ca. 20. Nu.
                      (as Rabby Isaac Arameus writeth) the highe pryest (whose cities these of refuge amonge the Leuits were) had interest and dominion vppon this man, by the lawe of Leuits, during his lyfe, for the benefit whiche he had receaued by the place of refuge. To whiche also Rabbi Moyses, and Rabbi Leui Ierson doe add an other reason: for that yf he should haue returned presentlie



amōg the kinred of the mā killed: his verie sight might haue styrred thē vp to reuengement vppon hym agayne after the triall passed. But in the deathe of the high pryest, the publique sorowe was so great, as all men forgate theyr priuate iniuries. and dyd vse commonlie to forgeue one an other all offences, saye these learned Iewes. And now I aske againe, whie M. Charke brought in this exāple? Doeth not this make cleare against hym, prouinge that manslaughter vnwillinglie done is no sinne: but innocencie? yf not manslaugter: how muche lesse other smaller actions are cleare from sinne, when no consent of will is yeelded?
                  Against the clause of the definition, which sayeth,  that sinne must wittinglie be committed, he obiecteth, that M. Howlet in his reasons of refusall doeth acknowlege a sinne of ignorance: 
                        Tvvo kyndes of ignorance.
                      which I graunt, but he speaketh of culpable ignorance, whereof a man hym selfe is the cause: as his example of persecuting Saul doeth shew, whose ignorance (although it were not so willfull as of many persecuting protestants at this daye, whoe of purpose refuse to know the truthe) yet, 
                        
                           Ep. 77. ad hugo. de S. vict.
                        
                        1. Cor. 15.
                      as S. Bernard well noteth, it could not be but culpable in hym: as also hym selfe doeth confesse. For that he being learned: in the olde testament, yf he wolde haue conferred patientlie with the Apostles, he might haue seene that they taught nothing but correspondent to the aunciēt scriptures of God. But we speake heere of inculpable ignorance, called inuincible, by the tearme of schoolemen: for that it was not in the doers power to auoyd it, nor he fell into it by his owne default. As yf an English man, being in India in seruice of the Prince, 
                        
                           An example of īuincible ignorance.

                      should be commaunded by proclamation made in westminster hall to appeare there at a certaine daye, and he (as not hearyng of the same) should not appeare this man is excused by inuincible ignorance. And so in all other cases. S. Augustin and Chrisostome proue of purpose, & moste learnedlie, that this kynde of ignorance (which in deede is onelie proper and true ignorance) doeth excuse from sinne. Yea God hym selfe proueth it by the



example of Abimelech king of Gerare, whome he excuseth from sinne, Gen. 20. for that he had taken awaye Sara Abrahams wyfe, vpon ignorance, & in simplicitie of hart, thinking her to be Abrahams sister, as the text sayeth. The like simplicitie of hart and inculpable ignorance, was in Iacob, lieing with Lia, in stead of Rachell, as the Censure sheweth. Gen. 29. Iacob sinned not in lyeīg vvith Lia.
                      And albeit M. Charke most impiously Ioynynge heerein with Faustus the Manachie, dareth condemne the holie Patriarche in a double sinne, as Faustus dyd: yet S. Austen defendeth notablie this holy mans innocencie, bothe against that and this heretique, in his two and twentith booke against Faustus, Ca. 47.49. 50.51.52. Lib. 16. de ciui. c. 38. through many chapiters together: as also in his booke of the Citie of God. And with S. Augustin doe take parte S. Iustin the martyr l. de verit. Christi religionis: and Theodoret q. 84. in generat. and lyranus vpon the verie same place of genesis. 
                        In cap. 29. Gen
                      And what one woorde can M. Charke now peepe against all this?
                  To conclude therfore, though M. Charke hathe picked out certaine obiectiōs of our owne bookes, made and answered by our selues against the learned definition of the Iesuits, (as in deed thay haue no other argumētes, but suche as we lende them our selues): yet hathe he (as you see) not infringed, but establyshed that definition thereby, and hathe bewrayed in hym selfe greate wantes, in holdinge, 
                        M. Charks positions about sinne.
                      
                     that sinne is no acte: that no euill men doe sinne, but the euill in men: that sinne is not voluntarie: that it is no humane or reasonable action: that it requireth nether vvill nor knovvlege in the doer: that fooles & madde men may as properlie committ sinne, as others, (for all these are his positions) by whiche he may as well defend, that beasts and vnreasonable creatures may committ sinne, and be sinners: 
                        Au. tom.

                         5. fo. 137. aedit. paris.
                      which S. Augustine thinketh to be so absurd as no man of common sense will affirme the same. But what doe I alleage S. Augustin, whome M. Charke reiecteth heere by name about the definition of sinne? Let vs returne therfore to the Censure. And see what is further brought about this matter.
               
               
                  
                  THE CENSVRE.
                  But novv hovv doeth M. Charke ouerthrovv this doctrine? forsoothe thus. Contrarie to this (sayeth he) is the woordes of God. 1. Ioh. 3. the transgression of the lawe is sinne. You seme to haue made a vovve (M. Charke) not to deale plainlie in anie one thing. Can you not alleage one litle sentence vvithout falsifyeing? The vvoordes of S. Iohn are these. Euerie one that sinneth committeth iniquitie, and sinne is iniquitie. Or (as you vvill perhappes seeme to enforce it out of the greeke vvoorde ANOMIA) Sinne is transgression of the lawe. But vvhy haue you fraudulentlie turned it backevvard? you knevv vvell the force of transposition out of Sophistrie, Transposition in alledginge of scripture. that it changeth all the meaning of the sentence. For yf I say, Euerie man is a liuing creature, it is true: but yf I turne it backevvard and saye: Euerye liuing creature is a man, it is false. Soe these vvoordes, as S. Iohn vttereth them, are moste true: Euerie sinne is iniquitie, or transgression of the lawe: but as you vtter them, they are false: to vvitt, that euery iniquitie or transgression of the lawe, be it neuer so litle, or done vvithout eyther consent or knoulege, or by a madde man, or brute beast, should be properlie a mortall sinne. Soe that this first blashemie of the Iesuits cōmeth not to be so haynouse, as you vvolde make it: but rather to confound your ignorance, vvhich vnderstand not so cleare doctrine, but hudle vp matters as M. Campian telleth you: also to note your vntruthe in misreporting their vvords, and the scriptures against them. And of this first depend the other tvvo that folovve.
               
               
                  THE DEFENCE.
                  For couering of falshoode in this place M. Charke



is constrayned to vse a falshoode or two more, according to the sayeing: that one lye is not maintayned, but by an other: things aequiualent (sayeth he,) as for example, the definition and the thing defined) may be conuerted, & one mutuallie maye be affirmed of the other: as the gospell is the povver of God to saluation: Ro. 1. v. 16 And the povver of God to saluation is the gospell: And therefore these two woordes also, si
                           •
                        ne & transgression of the lavve. But I denie this consequence: for transgression of the lawe is not the definition of sinne, as hath bene proued, nor is it equall in signification with the same, but reacheth further than sinne, as the former discourse sheweth: And thefore it is but absurdlie brought in againe heere, as a thing graunted, seing thereof is all the contention. Secondlie, let M. Charke looke, leste he be deceyued, whē he sayeth the power of God to saluation is the proper definition of the gospell: seing, Christ hym selfe (whiche notwistandinge is not the gospell, but author of the gospell) is called by the same woordes in an other place DVNAMIS THEOV: that is The povver of god, 
                     1. Cor. 1. v. 24. and no doubt but to saluation, as M. Charke will not denie. VVherfore, though it import not our matter at all, yet I thinke M. Charke was somewhat grosselie ouerseene in choyse of this example.
                  After this, for some countenance of his fraudulent transposition, he sayeth: Io. 4. v. 24
                     as for the transposition, lett the Apostles vvoordes be marked, sayeing, (God is a spirit:) Yet the vvoordes lye thus in the greeke text, (a spirit is God.) VVherfore let not transposition seeme straunge to you.
No more it doeth (M. Charke) in common speeche, and in a tongue that will beare it, as the latin and greek doeth. But when we measure the weight of woordes or propositions, and that in oure English tongue (as in our matter it falleth out) 
                        In Latin vve saye Princeps est Pompeius. vvhich vve can not interpret in Englishe, vvorde for vvorde, a PRINCE IS POMPEY: But Pōpey is a prince. For that oure tongue admi
                              ••
                           eth not the praedicatiō before the copula properlie, as other tōgues doe. 1. Io. 5. v. 7. trāspositions are fraudulēt, as in the verie example whiche you alleage, a spirit is God: if you wolde inferre therof, ergo euerie spirit is God, as you inferre that euery transgression of the lavve is synne: you should easilie see your owne falsehood. For Angels also are spirits (as the scripture sayeth), and yet not Goddes.



And heere for my learning I wolde know of you Sir, in what tongue the Apostle sayeth God is a spirit, different from which you say the greek hath a spirit is God? surelye (M. Chark) you are ouer bolde in your auouchements of the script
                        •
                     re. For not onelie the greeke, but also the latin and Syriak hathe Spiritus est deus: and therfore, bothe fondlie and falsely doe you attribute it, as peculiar onelie to the greeke.
                  But M. Charke reserueth a sure carde for the end, therewith to dashe all that hath bene sayd before, and that is the sentence of S. Iohn afterward, omnis iniquitas est peccatum, all iniquitie, (or 
                        He fraudulentlie translateth transgression in this place, the greekvvoorde beinge chaunged. 1. Io. 3. v. 4. transgression (sayeth he) is sinne. VVhich seemeth so plaine against me, as he greatlie insulteth and triumpheth, affirming that the victorie by this one sentēce is gotten: but beleeue hym not (good reader) for he thinketh not so in his owne cōscience, but well knoweth that this sentence maketh greatlie against hym, thoughe he wolde deceyue thee, with the bare sound and equiuocation of woordes. For in the former sentence, where is sayd, sinne is iniquitie, S. Iohn vseth for the woord iniquitie, ANOMIA, in greeke, which signifieth any transgression or variance from the law
                        •
                     , be it great or litle, as hath bene proued, and as the nature of the greeke woord importeth, in which sense it is most true, that euerie iniquitie is not sinne, as I haue shewed, & as S. Augustin proueth, of verie purpose. l. 2. cont. Iul. pela. c. 5. And alleageth also S. Ambrose in the same opinion: 
                        Aug. li. 5. cont. Iul. c. 3. & li. 6. c. 8.12. & 13. as also Methodius apud Epiphanium her: 64. quae est Origenis. And S. Augustin proueth it in many other places besides: shewing in our verie case, how concupiscence is iniquitie, in the regenerat, but yet no sinne. And this for the first place. Now in the second place, where the same Apostle sayeth euerye iniquitie is sinne: he vseth not the same generall woorde ANOMIA. ANOMIA. VVhiche he vsed before, but ADICIA, 
                        ADITIA.
                        
                           Arist. in praedicam. qualittias.
                        
                      which is a more speciall woorde, and signifieth an iniustice or iniurie: as the philosopher sheweth, assigning it as the contrarie to Iustice: and therfore no maruaile though this kinde of iniquitie be sinne as S. Iohn sayth, yea



great sinne also, for of such onelie S. Iohn talketh in that place, 1. Io. 5. sayeing, there is a sinne to death, I doe not saye that any man should aske for that all iniquitie is synne &c. whereby is euydent, that the Apostle taketh not iniquitie in this place (expressed by the woord ADICIA) in the same sense, wherein he tooke it before, vsing the woord ANOMIA. VVhiche M. Charke well knoweing, sheweth hym selfe a willfull deceyuer, in that he wolde delude his reader, with the equiuocation of the latin translation, which at other times he reiecteth withoute cause or reason.
                  
                     
                        Small game.
                     Lastlie, he chargeth me with alteration of the text of scripture, for translating omnis qui facit peccatum euerie one that sinneth, where I should haue translated (sayth he) euery one that doeth sinne. This is a charge woorthie of M. Charke, that will playe small game rather than sytt owt. I praye you sir, what difference is there in the two phrases, your vvyfe spinneth, and your vvyfe doeth spinne? But you cōfesse in deede there is litle holde in this, and therefore freendlie you doe pardon me, for it, and doe conclude, sayeing: you think perhaps to serue the Lorde in your opinion, and I knovv I serue the Lorde. You are happie that haue so certaine knowlege of your good estate M. Charke, 
                        M. Charks knoulege of his seruing the lorde.
                      though to vtter it in this place I doe not see what occasion you had. But I praye you let me learne how you came to this knowlege: Not by Aristotles demōstrations (I am sure) which yett are the onelie means of certaine science properlie. How then? by fayth? but you know, that faith can assure nothing, whiche is not reuealed by the woorde of God. VVhat parte of gods woorde then, teacheth vs that william Charke in particular serueth the Lorde a-right? but yow will saye perhappes. Your spirit within you telleth you soe. And my spirit (M. Charke) telleth me the contrarie. One of them must needes be a lyeing spirit: and whie not yours as well as myne? These are fansies (gentle syr william) proper to hereticall braynes, to assure them selues such knowlege aboue other men. Luther sayde many yeres after he was a protestant.

And againe returninge to be a Zuinglian: he knew it was true againe, and the other false: and yet all this while certaine knowlege can not be false. Yf a man should aske all the sectaries now lyuing, they wold say the same that you doe of theyr certaine knowlege.

declareth euidentlie, that yow haue no playne meanyng, but a secret intention to deceyue. As also when you assure your reader, that I denyeing concupiscence to be a mortall sinne (according to the question betwene Monhemius and the Iesuits) doe thereby graunt vnder-hand that it is some kinde of sinne. VVhich was no more meant by me, than you (denyeing before Martin Luthers mariage to be sacrilege) dyd meane thereby to graunt vnder-hand that it was adulterie, fornication, or any other lesser sinne of the fleshe.
                  The exposition of S. Pauls woordes callinge concupiscence improperlie sinne, 
                        Li. 6. c. 11. cont. Iuliā.
                      
                     quia peccato facta est, because it was wrought in vs by originall sinne: as S. Augustin sayeth: M. Charke reiecteth, calling it a wrāgling exposition, though it be the exposition of the primatiue churche, and so recorded by S. Augustin in many places of his woorkes: as lib. 1. de nuptio & concup. ca. 23. li. 1. contr. 2. ep. pelag c. 13 lib. 1. retract. c. 15. li. 2. cont. Iul. c. 13. and li. 6. c. 11. All whiche M. Charke (as better learned in S. Paul than Austen & all the fathers of that time contemneth as easilie as yf it were the exposition of some vnlearned boye, 
                        Charkes malepertenes vvith S. Austen.
                      and beginneth hym selfe like a doctor to discourse a-new, vpon S. Pauls meaning: mary (as it commonlie falleth out to suche malapert marchants) he is no sooner in, but he is ouer the eares in absurdities. For his discourse is this.
                  S. Paul proueth, (sayethe he) that though the lavve sturreth vs to synne, yet is it no synne. 
                     Rom. 7. Ver. 12.14 VVell: this maketh for vs. For soe we may reason: that though concupiscence doe sturre vs to sinne; yet is it no sinne. But what inferreth he? 
                        VVeake resonynge.
                      therfore (sayeth he) yf the lavve vvh

                        che is holie, doe come in question notvvithstanding of synne, for that it prouoketh our corrupt nature to synne: hovv muche more concupiscence: vvhich is vncleane in it selfe? This proueth nothing M. Charke but from the place, a disparatis, where commonlie children and distracted men take their arguments. For how holdeth this: yf the lawe, for sturring to sinne: be called in question of sinne, and be no sinne: then concupiscence for sturring to sinne, must be called



in question of sinne, and be sinne in deede? but he will saye (perhappes,) the force of the argument standeth in the woordes holie, & vncleane, in this order: yf the lawe, being holie, be called in question of sinne: what shall we saye of concupiscence, which is vncleane? and what more can you say (M. Charke) than to call it in questiō of sinne, & that somewhat more than the lawe is called in question, which is bothe pure and holie, and no wayes ether vncleane or euill, or the effect of sinne, as we graunt concupiscence is? and yet for all this not properlie sinne, without consent of hart, as S. Augustin in the places alleaged proueth.
                  And this now of consequent, supposinge the Antecedent were true, as it is moste false. For who will graunt those absurd impious propositions: The lavve sturreth vs to sinne: the lavve prouoketh our corrupt nature to sinne? Rom. 7. S. Paul sayeth, I had not knowne sinne but by the lawe: but he neuer sayeth, that the lawe sturred hym vpp to sinne: but onelie, that it discouereth sinne vnto hym, euen as the looking glasse discouereth the spotte in a-mans face, and maketh vs to see it, whiche we did not before, but yet procureth not that spotte. And S. Paul gyueth an example, sayeing, Exo. 20. 
                     I had not knovvne concupiscence, yf the lavve had not sayd, thovv shalt not couet. In whiche woordes, that he meaneth of voluntarie cō

Augustin besides the places alleaged testifieth. li. 1. de nup. & concup. c. 29. li. de spiritu & litera cap. vlt. li. 19. con: Faustum c. 7. & cont. 2. ep. petil. li. 3. c. 7.

                  S. Augustins example of the latin tongue M. Chark reiecteth, Au. li 1. de nup. & cō cup. c. 23. for that the tongue is not suche a cause of the speche, as originall sinne is of concupiscence. But what a reason is this to reproue so learned a man as S. Augustin was? for vvhoe knovveth not, (as I haue shewed before) that comparisōs or similitudes are not of necessitie, to holde in euerye pointe, but in that onelie wherein they are compared. Though then the tongue be onelie the instrumētall cause of speeche: & originall sinne, the formall cause of concupiscence: yet is it sufficiēt to shevve that effects may take vppon them oftentimes the name of their causes: and consequentlie, asvvell concupiscence the name of sinne, as the tongue the name of speeche.

Chark reasoneth) that euery effect of originall synne should be synne in the regenerate: For that all our penalties (as hungar, thirst, sicknesse & the like) are effectes of originall sinne in vs, but yet not sinnes in them selues: as nether cō

Paul calleth him sinne:) No mā can denie, but Christ so considered, vvas a certayne effect of our sinnes also: that is, Christ crucified, or the crucifieinge of Christ vvas a certayne effect of our sinnes: for that our sinne vvas the cause of that deathe and sacrifice.

Ambrose and Clemens Alexādrinus, he answereth, that they haue no suche thynges in the places alleaged: whiche is somewhat worse than passing ouer: for it is a flatt vntruethe: seing in those places (as the reader may see by conference) they proue all sinne to be taken awaye in the regenerate by baptisme, and the sowle left pure & cleane, as the light it selfe: whiche can not stande, yf concupiscence remayning be a fowle sinne, as M. Charke affirmeth: but he addeth, that Clemens in an other place hathe some what against vs:

But the first motions onelie, without any consent or delectation in them, I maruaile M. Charke is not ashamed to call adulterie: seing Clemens in the same place exhorteth the gentiles to resist these motions of concupiscence, and not to yeelde vnto them, and so to auoyde adulterie: whiche he wolde not haue done, yf these very first motions thē selues (which are inauoydable) were adulterie without yeelding any consent vnto them.
                  To Gregorie Nazianzen alleaged in orat. de S. Iauacro, he answereth, that Nazianzen neuer vvrote any such oratiō as I dreame of. But if he dreamed not, yet I thinke at least he was halfe a sleepe, whē he wrote this: & ether vnderstoode not the books name, being writtē somewhat short (whiche were too badde in so greate

diuine:) or else neuer sawe Nazianzēs woorkes (which were worse:) or else not able to answere the place, wold shyft it of with suche a sleyght, which were worst of all. That which he hathe for shyfting of S. Austen, I vnderstande not: his woordes are these: lett the reader skanne them: you vvere deceyued (sayeth he) in citing Augustin tvvyse, as hauyng vvriten but one booke de nuptiis & concupiscentia. Heere, yf he meane that S. Austen hathe written but one booke de nupt. & concup: and that I was deceyued in citing hym twyse, as hauing written two bookes: then is S. Austen hym selfe against hym: whoe sayeth in his second booke of Retractations, Cap. 53. that he had written two bookes de nuptiis & concupiscentia. But yf M. Chark meane that I thynke S. Austen to haue wrytten but one booke de nupt. & concup. and so doe erre in citing hym: he is deceyued. For I cite hym thus in the Censure: li. 1. de nupt. & concup: whiche signifieth the first booke: and no man citeth a first booke, which thynketh not that there is a secōd. Vherfore this fond charge eyther tasteth of ignorance, or of greate desire to quarrell. VVill you stand to it that S. Augustin hath written but one booke of this matter? I wolde gyue a good thing, that I were by you whyle you reade this, to see whether you can blushe or no. But yet I call backe my wishe agayne. For I thinke you wolde make me more a fearde, than I you a shamed: for that your Purseuantes are stronger than our argumentes.
                  And this is but concerning the quotation of S. Augustin: for about the text it selfe M.

                     redit, falsifieth so learned a fathers writinges against his plaine and euident woordes and meaning. For whereas S. Augustin alleaged by the Censure, & in many places else of his woorkes sayeth,

                        lli ad illicita opera non consentitur: concupiscens nowe in



the regenerate is not sinne when consent of mynde is not yeelded to vnlaufull woorks. M. Chark answereth: S. Augustins place is expounded by him selfe afterward, sayeing Cōcupiscence is not so for gyuen in baptisme, that it is not synne, but that it is not imputed as synne: 
                        Li. 1. de nu. & co
                              •
                           cup. c. 23. & 25. this seemeth plaine, and Augustin appeareth contrarie to hym selfe. But what is the principall woorde in this sentence, that maketh moste for M. Charke? The word, Synne, you will say: for that being taken away in the former clause, the sentence maketh quite against hym. VVell then, that woorde hathe he added of hym selfe, and yet hathe corrupted the whole sentēce besides. For S. Augustines woordes are these: Cap. 25.
                     
                        quaeritur &c. si in parente baptizato potest esse (concupiscentia) & peccatum non esse: cur eadem ipsae in prole peccatum sit? The question is (sayth S. Augustin whie this concupiscence is sinne in the childe (before it be baptized:) yf it be no sinne in the parent nowe baptized? heere you see by the way, that it is holden as a matter out of doubt, that concupiscence is no sinne in the parent whiche is baptized:
and the reason S. Augustin yeedelth immediatlie in the answer: sayeing,
Ad haec respondetur dimitti concupiscentiam carnis in baptismo, non vt non si
                           •
                        , sed vt in peccatum nō impute
                           •
                        ur, quamuis reatu suo iam soluto, manet tamē &c.
To this is answered that the cōcupiscence of the fleshe is forgeuen in baptisme, not that it is not, (or remayneth not,) but that it is not imputed into sinne. Yt remaneth still, though the guylt be taken awaye.
                  Heere now we see that S. Augustin affirmeth onelie that concupiscence is not quite taken awaye by baptisme, but yet the guilt thereof, is so that it is no more imputed into the nature of a sinne. The cause whie it is left he vttereth in diuers places, as when he sayeth: 
                        Li. 11. de peccat. meri
                              •

                     ad agonem manet, non sibi ad illicita consentientibus nihil omnino nocitura. Concupiscence remaneth to fight withall, but yet in such sort, as it can hurt vs nothing at all, yf we cōsent not to her vnlaufull suggestiōs. Secondlie we see that S. Augustin in this verie place proueth directlie our verie position, that concupiscence in the baptized



is not sinne: also that it hath no guilt: and that it doeth hurt nothing vvithout consent: vvherby M. Charkes lacke of Iudgement and shame may be noted in bringing this place of all others against vs, & adding, that hovv soeuer the Iesuits distinguish, yet these sinnes (the first motions of concupiscence) 
                           •
                        vhich by the Iesuits doctrine are so called figuratiuelie (except vve fynde mercie) vvill fynde no figuratiue condemnation.
                  
                  Thyrdlie vve may beholde and lament the pityfull desperate resolutiō of our aduersaries, whoe seing and knoweing their owne vveaknes, 
                        Great impudencie.
                      yet to couer their miserie dare abuse, forge, and falsifie playne authorities, as in this place this shamelesse creature hath done in so many points For first, vvhere as S. Augustin sayeth Concupiscence is forgyuen in baptisme: he translateth, concupiscence is not so forgyuen in baptisme. Secondlie vvhere as S. Augustine saythe: it is forgyuen, not that it be not, or remaine not: he trāslateth: not that it is not sinne. Thirdlie for imputed into synne: he trāslateth imputed as sinne. Fowerthlie he cutteth of the woordes immediatlie goeing before, where S. Augustin sayeth concupiscence in the paren
                           •
                         baptized is no synne, as also the voordes immediatlie foloweing, and affirming, that concupiscence remayneth, but vvithout guilt, and consequentlie can not be sinne. Hathe this man anye conscience, any trueth? any good meaning? any sparke of grace? seeketh he to instruct or to deceyue? to proue and defend, or to couer & dissemble? Is this he whiche protested suche sinceritie in his dealing, as before God and Angels? is this the credit of a puritane protestant? O how miserable are those people whiche hange their soules vpon the trust of such dissē
                     bling and deceyuing men?
                  And this for the fyrst place cited by M. Charke, for his sentence of S. Augustin, for he citeth two chapiters in one booke: the first thereof hath as you haue seene: the other hath no one woorde tendinge that waye, but cleane to the contrarie. For S. Augustin layeth downe & proueth our position of purpose, in muche more ample and vehement maner than I can against M Charke, and



sheweth it also by examples, how the Apostle called concupiscence sinne improperlie: Rom. 7. ca. 23. li. 1. de nup. & concup.
                      
                     vocatur peccatum quia peccato facta est, cum iam in regeneratis non sit ipsa peccatum: Si autem vocatur lingua locutio, quam facit lingua, & manus vocatur scriptura quam facit manus. Concupiscence is called sinne: because it is made in vs by (originall) sinne, whereas it selfe is not sinne now in the regenerate: 
                        Hovv S. Paul called concupiscē
                           ce synne improperlye.
                      euen as the speeche whiche the tongue maketh is called the tongue, and the writinge whiche the hand maketh is called the hand. The verie same hath S. Augustin against Iulian the pelagian towching S. Pauls calling of concupiscence sinne, 
                        Li. 6. c. 11. whiche in deede properlie is no sinne, except consent be yeelded thervnto, as there S. Augustin proueth by the woordes of Paul hym selfe. VVherfore M. Charke doeth fraudulentlie alleage his woords against the same Iulian, to proue that all concupiscence is sinne. For S. Augustin sayeth onelie of concupiscence in generall, 
                        Li. 5. c. 3. that it is synne, and the punishement of synne, and the cause of synne, whiche is true of concupiscence in generall, as it comprehendeth all her braunches, and all estates of men: for concupiscence is the punishement of sinne in all men: In them that gyue consent it is the cause of sinne: in them that are not baptized it is sinne it selfe, whether they gyue consent or no. But yet is it not nedefull that all these points should be verified in euerye particular braunche of concupiscence: 
                        An example.
                      as for example: Manslaughter in generall comprehendeth murder, chaunce medley, execution by Iustice, and the like: and in respect of these braunches a man may say truelie, manslaughter is vvicked and prohibited by god

                         lavve. And againe, manslaughter is good and commended by gods lavve, for bothe these are verified in some of her braunches. So in respect of diuerse braunches of concupiscence S. Augustin might saye concupiscence is synne, the punishement of synne, and the cause of synne. But yet this is not true in euerie particular braunche of concupifcence, and namelie of that braunche we now dispute of: that is, of concupiscence in the regenerat without consent: as a man can not saye, that euerye



manslaughter is good, nor that euerie manslaughter is euill.
                  And the cause why S. Augustin vsed this sentence against Iulian was, for that Iulian dyd prayse concupiscence, as a thing commendable, for that it was a punishement of God sor sinne: But S Augustin refuteth that, sheweing, that concupiscence in generall, is not onelie a punishement for synne, but sometimes also, and in some

Thyrdlie, that accordinge to the mesure or degree of cōsent yeelded, it may be ether veniall or mortall sinne against, M. Charke, a litle before obstinatlie denyeinge this distinction of sinnes.

Ambrose, Nazianzen and others. VVhat then shall we say but onelye pittie william Charke, whiche fyndeth Augustin the doctor as hard against hym in all pointes, as Augustin the monke.
                  The woordes of Christ alleaged by you to ouerthrow



our position: to witt, Math. 5. 
                     euerie one that shall see a vvoman, to lust after her, hathe novv committed adulterie vvith her in his hart: are truelie sayd of the Censure, to be alleaged by you, bothe ignorantlie, & against your selfe. Fyrst, for that the woorde hart there expressed, importeth a consent, without whiche nothing defileth a man, as may be gathered by Christ his owne woordes, Math. 15. Marck. 7. in an other place, sayeing, that the things which defile a man doe procede frō the hart. Secondlie, for that, the woordes import a voluntarie looking vppon vvomen, PROS TO EPIDVMESAI AVTEN. to that ende to be inflamed with lust, as bothe the latin, & muche more the greeke and Syriake textes insinuate: and S. Chrisostom interpreteth hom. 8. de poenitentia, as S. Augustin also expoundeth them, sayeinge, 
                        Au. li. 1. de serm. domi. in monte ca. 23. 
                     qui viderit mulierem ad concupiscendam eam: id est, hoc fine & hoc animo attenderit, vt eam concupiscat, quod est plene consentire libidini.
                     He that shall see a woman to lust after her: that is, shall looke vpon her to this end, and with this mynde to lust after her, which is in deede fullie to consent vnto the lust.
Now what replieth Sir william to all this? surelie nothing, but maketh along idle speake of praedicatum & subiectum, as pertinent to the matter, as charing crosse to byllingsgate. And in the end to quite the Lorde (as he saythe) moste carefullie from synne, he alleageth S. Iames, sayeing, 
                        Iacob. 1. v. 14. & 15. 
                     that God tempteth no man, but euerie man is tempted, dravven, and allured by his ovvne concupiscence: and then concupiscence vvhen it hathe conceyued, bringeth furth synne. But what is this against vs? Doe we charge God with this sinne of cōcupiscence, when we denie it to be sinne at all, except onelie when a man consenteth to it? or rather doe you charge God withe it, when you affirme it to be sinne, as it is of nature, without consent? are we or you they, that make God author of sinne? is not Caluin condemned of our churche for this impretie?

Pariens enim est concupiscentia, partus peccatum. Sed concupiscentia non parit nisi conceperit: non concipit nisi illexerit, hoc est ad malum perpetrandum obtinuerit volentis assensum.
                     VVhen the apostle Iames sayeth: euery one is tempted, drawen awaye, and Intised by his owne concupiscence: afterward concupiscence, when it hathe conceyued, bringeth furthe sinne: surelie in these woordes the childe is distinguished from the mother: the mother that beareth is concupiscence: the childe borne is sinne. But concupiscence beareth not except she conceyue: and she conceyueth not except she obtaine the consent of hym which is willing to doe euill.
Now goe (M. Charke) and acquite your selfe of grosse follie and ignorance, whereof you are conuicted, which wolde so carefullie quitte the Lorde of that, wherewith we neuer meant to charge hym.
               
            
            
               Of the first motions of concupiscence.
               
                  THE CENSVRE.
                  Thyrdlie, you reporte the Iesuits to saye, 
                        The third Article.
                      
                     That the first motiōs of lust are without hurt of sinne Cēs. 54. 89. It is moste true and playne, as they delyuer it, but you, by clipping their vvoords, make euerie thing to seeme a paradoxe. They say, the first motions of lust, yf they come of naturall instinct only, vvithout any cause gyuen by vs, are no sinnes, so long as vve geue no consen
                        •
                      of hart vnto them. And the reason is because it lyeth not in vs, (they being naturall) to prohibit them to come,



no more than it dothe, to prohibit our pulse from beating. And therfore seing no sinne can be cōmitted, vvithout our vvill & consent of har
                        •
                     : (as I haue shevved before:) the first motions can be no more sinnes in vs, than they are in beastes, for the lyke reason. Nether is the tenthe cōmaundement, (alleaged by you for the contrary doctrine, to vvitt, Exo. 20. 
                     thow shalt not couet) any vvaye repugnant to this. For this commaundemēt forbyddeth consent to these motions, & not the verie motions, vvhiche are not in our povver, as the Scripture it selfe signifieth, vvhen it sayeth. Deut. 30. Li. 1. de nu. & concup. ca. 23. Ecc. 18. 
                     This cōmaundement which I doe gyue thee this daye, is not aboue thee. And as S. Austen learnedlie proueth out of an other place of scripture, vvhere this commaundement is expounded, to vvit. Goe not after thy concupiscence: That is, consent not vnto them, or folovve them not.
               
               
                  THE DEFENCE.
                  The vnderstanding of this article dependeth wholie of that whiche goeth before. For yf no sinne be cō
                     mitted, where no consent of will is, as hath bene proued abundātlie in the two former articles: then can not the first motions of lust or concupiscence, that come by naturall instinct onelye, without any cause gyuē by vs, be sinne: yf we yeeld no cōsent of hart to the same. And this is so euident, bothe in reason, common sense, philosophie, diuinitie, and authoritie of auncient fathers: as no man wolde haue the face to stand against it, but a man enforced therunto, as M. Charke is
                        •
                      S. Austen dothe proue the matter purposelie in diuers places, whoe was not behynde M. Charke in iudgement. You remember how many places I haue alleaged of his before: as that amōg the rest: 
                        Li. 2. cont. Iul. circa finem. Li. 2. de gra. & pec. orig. c. 40. 
                     VVe myght be allvvayes vvithout synne
                           •
                         yf vve neuer dyd yealde consent to our concup
                           •
                        scēce to sinne. And in an other place, talking purposelie of these first motions, he sayeth:
Quibus si non consentitur, nullius peccati reatus comrahitur:
vnto whiche motions, yf



we gyue no consent of hart: no guylt of sinne is contracted by them. VVhat can be sayde more effectuallie? Agayne he sayeth in an other place, that these first motions of lust are so fare of from beyng sinnes, 
                        Ep. 200. ad Asell.
                      of their owne nature, as Christians vse not to aske God forgiuenes for them, except they be eyther negligent in repellinge them, or doe yealde some consent vnto them. The verie same he hathe in diuers other places: as concione 3. in psa. 118 And Lib
                           •
                         de perfect. iustitiae. cap. vlt. and yet more largelie Li. 1. cont. duas ep. Pelag: cap. 13. and in dyuers other places: affirming that wee neede not saye for thes sirst motions, dimitte nobis debita nostra: Forgeue vs our trespasses. So that you see with what witt, or reasō, this doctrine is called blasphemous in the Iesuites, by VV. Charke.
                  But yet, though this matter be moste euident in it selfe: Lett vs examine what cauilles he seeketh to frame some shewe or semblance of a replie. He reprehendeth first, as superfluous, my addition of woordes, vsed for explication sake, when I sayde, that the first motiōs were no sinne without consent: Yf they come of naturall instinct onelye, vvithout any cause gyuen by vs. This explicatiō (I saye) he greatlie reprehendeth: sayeing,  This kinde of speeche is called implicatio in adiecto.
                      
                     I pray you, are not all the fyrst motions of lust merelye naturall, and euermore of some cause gyuen by vs &c? In which fond interrogation, first he includeth two contraries. For if they be meerlie naturall: then are they not of any cause gyuen by vs. And yf they be of causes gyuen by vs: then are they not meerlie naturall. For that, natura & voluntas are distinct agents: as he ought to haue learned in philosophie. Secondlie, it is false, that all fyrst motions of lust are meerlie naturall. For in lewed men they are often voluntarie: 
                        Fyrst motions voluntarie sometimes.
                      as when a man applieth his imaginanation purposelie to thinke of dishonest things, and so sturreth the motions of concupiscence: also when a mā voluntarilie doeth beholde lasciuious sightes, or readeth wanton bookes, or the lyke. In all whiche cases, though the motions of lust that ryse, be naturall in the roote, as diuines tearme it: yet is their nearest and immediat



cause voluntarie: 
                        An euidēt example.
                      and therfore are they not meerlie naturall. A playne example heerof may be this: that, if a furious dogge should lye a sleep, & one should a-wake hym purposelye, knoweing the daunger, and so should be bytten of hym: this hurt might be sayde to proceed from the dogges nature, as from the roote or fyrst cause: But the immediate cause therof was the mans voluntarie awaking of hym, and not the dogges nature. So in the first motions of lust, though all be naturall in the roote, or first cause of concupiscence, and many times they doe rise of thē selues in the most godlie that are, without any cause gyuē by thē (& therfore sayeth M. Charke most falselie, that all come of causes gyuen by vs:) yet sometimes they are a-wakened and sturred vpp in vs by those meanes, whiche I haue named. And then are they bothe voluntarie and sinfull, and not otherwyse. And for this distinction dyd I make that addition of vvaste vvoordes, as M. Charke calleth yt: but you haue seene with what cause or wisdome.
                  After this, he reprehendeth my comparison of first motions to the pulse, Deceytful auoydinge of similitudes. 
                     as a comparison vvithout iudgement
                     
                        •
                      And his cheefest reason is, for that they are not lyke to the pulse in all things: & this is his ordinaire answering of all comparisons alleaged in the Censure. VVhiche is as substantiall a waye of answering, as yf a man should saye, a cowe and her cal
                        •
                     e are not lyke in heire, for that they are not lyke in hornes. VVhat Gramarian almost knoweth not, that similitudes are not of necessitie to holde in all poyntes, but onelie in that, wherein the cō
                     parison is made? I compared therfore the first motions of lust vnto the pulse, in one onelie point: (as appeareth in the Censure) And that is, that they bothe, as well the one as the other, are often tymes meere naturall: and the lust many tymes no more voluntarie than the pulse: And is not this true? or dothe M. Charke saye one woord against this? no surelie: but goeth and proueth at large, that in other thyngs they are not lyke: whiche I neuer denyed.
                  His second reason against my example of the pulse



standeth thus in his booke: 
                        Great
                              •
                            surdities.
                      
                     You can not conclude from that parte of our naturall sovvle, vvherby vve haue lyfe and sens
                           •
                         onelie, to the parte vvherein our reason & affections are placed, because the former is not in the same sorte corrupted as the second. Nether dothe synne so vvoorke in naturall lyfe and sense, as it dothe in the hart by the corruptions and guyltines of the sovvle. The necessarie actions of lyfe, (as eating, drinkyng, sleepe, breathe) also the necessarie actions of sense, (as smellyng, seeyng, hearing, feelyng, & the rest,) they are of thē selues all free from synne, remaynyng as they vvere in man before his fall. By this long discourse he wolde proue that the pulse; and the first motions of concupiscence are not lyke in all pointes. VVhiche I graunt without proofe. But yet in this one reason he vttereth three fowle absurdities, and most grosse errours.
                  The first is that he placeth concupiscence of the fleshe (wherof we talke) in the reasonable parte of the mynde, 
                        Concupiscē
                           ce in vvhat place it is.
                      and not in the sensityue parte: which is as much, as yf a man should appoint seeyng to be in the nose, & smellyng to be in the eyes. For the motiōs of cōcupiscē
                     ce are nothing els but the rebelliōs of our sēsitiue partes, against the parte wherein reason is: and how then are not they in the parte sensityue? are they not called the concupiscence of the fleshe? Dothe not S. Paul saye the fleshe coueteth (or hathe concupiscence) agaynst the spirit? Dothe not he saye playnlie: Gal. 5. Rom. 7, 
                     I feele an other lavve in my members repugnyng to the lavve of my mynde? Is not heere concupiscence placed in the members; and reason in the mynde? what intollerable ignorāce is this in a preacher, yea in a conquerour of learned M. Campian, eauen vnto Tyborne?
                  But his second absurditie is yet greater than this; in affirmyng that the sensuall parte of man is not so muche corrupted by originall synne, 
                        The sensatiue parte
                              •
                            of mā more corrupted than the reasonable.
                      as is the reasonable part: whiche is cleane false and the contradictorie therof is true. For albeit all partes be corrupted: yet the s
                        ••
                     sible parte more, by reason of the rebellyon of the sensityue parte against the reasonable: whiche I haue named before, and euerie man by experience dothe



fynde more temptation in his sensitiue partes: to witt, in his senses, imagination, and other like partes, and members of his bodie: than he dothe in his reasonable partes, to wytt, in his iudgement, and wyll: especiallie good men, who fynde greate rebellyon often tymes in their sensuall partes, thoughe their iudgement be ryght, and their wyll most holye and firme. S. Paul felt this, when he sayd, Rom. 7. 
                     O vnhappie man that I am, vvho shall delyuer me from the bodie of this deathe? And agayne: I my selfe doe serue the lavve of God in my mynde, but in my fleshe I serue the lav
                           •
                        e of synne: signifyinge therby the violent rebellion of the fleshe. In whiche sense also it is sayd by the wyse man: Sap. 9. Rom. 7. 
                     the bodye that is corrupted aggreueth the mynde. And S. Paul sayethe, I doe not that uuhiche I vvolde, but that vvhiche I hate. By all which is shewed that the inferiour parte of man (called the sensatyue parte) is more corrupted, by the fall of Adam, than the reasonable: 
                        Vide Au. in psa. 145 & li. 14. de ciuit. c. 19. for that by the force of concupiscence placed principallie in it, it maketh warre, and offerreth violence to the other. So that heerin also M. Charke was fowlie ouerseene.
                  
                     
                        Necessarie actions of lyfe and sēse corrupted by originall synne.
                     His third absurditie is ioyned with flatt pelagianisme, where he sayeth, that the necessarie actions of lyfe and sense remayne novv in man, as they vvere before hys fall. Heerof S. Austen shalbe witnesse, whose woordes are these: Yf any man shall affirme that by the offence of preuarication in Adam, the vuhole man, that is, man bothe in bodie and sovvle is not chaunged into vvorse &c: he is deceyued vvith the errour of pelagians, and is contrarie to the scriptures. 
                     
                        De eccles. dogm. c. 38. The lyke teacheth Prosper. lib. 1. de vocat. gent. ca. 7. Into these errours and heresies falleth M. Charke, whiles leauing the sure doctrine of the Catholique Churche, he deuiseth owt newe wayes, (after the fashion of all heretiques) wherby to excuse naturall actions from sinne. VVe excuse them from sinne, and doe saye the cause to be, for that they are not voluntarie: whiche is one principall point required, aswell in sinne as in vertue, as hathe beene shewed. M. Charke deuiseth, he can not tell what him selfe, in this pointe: but onelie that he wolde not saye willinglie as we doe, thoughe he haue



nothing to saye besides.
                  But yet against this poynte of voluntarie he obiecteth (once more,) originall sinne: whiche (as he sayeth) is not voluntarie. But it hathe bene answered before; & shewed, how it is voluntarie, not onelie in men of discretion, but also in infantes. Secōdlie, he alleageth owt of Genesis; Ge. 6. & 8. 
                     that the cogitation of mans hart is euill euer more. To whiche I answere, that it inclineth to euill by reason of concupiscence left in vs: but yet is not that inclination synne, without consent: as hathe bene proued before. Thirdlie, he obiecteth the commaundemēt; Deut. 6. Matth. 22. 
                     thovv shalt loue thy God, vvith all thy hart, vvith all thy sovvle, and vvith all thy strength. By whiche commaundement, he imagineth the first motions of concupiscence to be also forbydden, 
                        Au. de spi. & lit. c. v
                              •

Austen well writeth in dyuers places) thoughe we be sturred by this commaundement to all perfection that we can in this lyfe: yet no more is inioyned vs therby vnder payne of synne and damnation, but onlie that we doe not yeeld consent to sinne; as hathe bene shewed before, in the Censure, and is now presentlie to be examined more at large, in explication of the tenthe commaundement: whiche contayneth the verye same meaninge that this commaundement dothe.
                  Vpon all this that goeth before, 
                        Catholikes doe represse lustes, an
                              •
                            not the protestants.
                      VV. Chark maketh this conclusion agaynst vs. Therfore to saye vve must not; or can not pull in the raynes of our first lustes &c, is in deede to teache a beastlie libertie, and to laye open the vvaye to all vncleannesse, vvithout controllement. Heere now is shewed the ordinarie practise of all lyeing heretikes, and speciallie of protestantes: whose fashion is to charge the Catholique Church with odious conclusions, deduced of false principles deuised by them selues. For, which parte doeth enlarge or pull in the raynes of our lustes? the protestant, or the Catholique doctrine? surelie, yf to pull in or enlarge the raynes of our lustes, be to gyue them scope, or to represse the motions, as all men (I thinke) will confesse: then consider, I pray you, who
                        •
                     


                     
doe this, ether VV. Chark and hys felowes, or we. Protestants doctrine. They teache that these first motions of lust are naturall, and doe present them selues vnto vs without our wyll: and when they doe so come, we can not lett their effect, but that they woorke sinne in vs, whether we consent, or not consent. So that by this doctrine, protestantes doe not onelie lett owt the raynes, but doe qwyte take awaye bothe raynes, and brydle owt of our handes. For yf lustes come without our will, and woorke sinne in vs without our consent: what raynes are there left in our handes to pull in? Yf they be sinne in me whether I consent, or not consent: shall I stryue agaynst a thyng that is impossible? whoe will not rather execute his lustes with pleasure, than resist them with payne, yf whether he consent, or not, they are sinne? So that (in deede) this is that libertine doctrine of protestantes, which looseth the raynes, and layeth open the waye to all vncleannesse: Catholique doctrine of lustes. as bothe by experience nowe appeareth in the worlde, and by reason is euident. And our contrarie doctrine is that, whiche pulleth in the raynes of lust, and layeth the foundation of all vertue among Christians, yf it be executed accordinglie. To witt, the doctrine vvherby vve teache, that albeit these first motions be naturall, and doe present them selues vnto vs many tymes, without all fault of ours: yet allwayes (by the help of gods grace that neuer wanteth) it standeth in vs to admitt, or reiect them: to gyue consent or to resist to their motions. And yf we consent, they are sinnes: but yf we consent not, but vanquishe them: they are cause of merit and rewarde in heauen: though the motions them selues, be infirmities and spottes left in vs by originall sinne. And this maketh men to stryue and resist them, and to keepe their myndes cleare from consent, and finallie to stand stronglie in the spirituall battaill betwene the fleshe tempting, and the spirit resisting: wherin the protestant fighteth not at all, for that he hath no hope of victorie
                        •
                      And yet (gentle reader) cō
                     sider their impudencie in chargyng vs with that beastlie libertie which they teache onelie them selues.
                  
                     There foloweth now the tenth commaundement: Exo. 20. 
                     thou shalt not couet: alleaged by M. Charke, for condemnyng of the first motions of lust. VVhiche commaundement the Censure expoundeth owt of S. Austen, 
                        
                           Li. de nup. & concup. cap. 23.
                        Eccle. 18.
                      and by an other place of scripture, (which is the best manner of exposition that may be) that it is meant onelie of consent: to wytt, that we must not gyue cōsent to our lustes of concupiscence, nor folow them. So that this tenth cōmaundemēt, (by S. Austens expositiō) maketh nothing against the first motions, whiche are without consent, but onelye against the lustes wherto we yeeld assent. To this Syr VVilliam replyeth nothing, but onelie sayeth Austens opinion appeareth by the places alleaged before. VVhich is true: for it appeareth that S. Austen is moste euident and flatt against M. Charke, and more earnest, than I can be: And that M. Chark hath no shewe owt of hym for one syllable on his syde, but onelie a place forged by hym selfe, as hath bene declared.
                  Next to this it pleaseth M. Charke to put downe fower manifest lyes for helpyng hym selfe owt with some shew of matter: Abovvt the number and order of the commaundemē
                        tes. sayeing, As the papistes make of the tenth commaundement tvvo commaundementes: so this felovve maketh of tvvo seuerall breaches of tvvo diuers commaundementes, but one synne. Bothe these (I saye) are slaunders. For first, the Catholiques make but one cōmaundement of the tenth cōmaundement. But the question is, which is properlie and distinctlie the tenth commaundement. For the protestātes (for mayntaynyng of a cauill against the Catholiques) will haue these two braunches, thou shalt not couet thy neyghbours vvyfe. And: Deut. 5. 
                     thou shalt not couet thy neyghbours hovvse, fyeld, &c. to be but one onelye cōmaundement: that is, the tenth. And cōsequentlie, they will haue these two other braunches: thou shalt not haue straunge gods before me, And: thou shalt not make vnto thy sel
                           •
                        e any grauen Idole &c. to be two distinct cōmaundementes. But S. Austen contendeth in dyuers places, 
                        Quaest. 71. in exod. & concione. 1. in psa. 32. that these latter two braunches make but one onelie commaundement: that is, the first commaundemēt: and that the second clause therof, prohibiting the makyng



of Idoles, is but an explication of the first clause, that prohibiteth false goddes. And therfore, that these other two braūches, of coueting our neyghbours vvyfe, And: of coueting his goods: doe make two distinct cōmaundemētes: to witt, the nyenthe and tenthe: the nyenth prohibiting all internall consent of hart to carnall sinne: the externall complishement and woorke wherof is prohibited by the sixt commaundement (after this account:) whiche is, thovv shalt not committ adul
                           •
                        erie. And the tenth, prohibiting all internall consent of hart vnto couetousnes: the externall accomplishement wherof is prohibited by the seuenth commaundement: whiche is, thovv shalt not steale. So that by this account of S. Austen, and other learned men foloweing his opinion, these two braunches, thovv shalt not couet thy neighbours vvyfe, and thovv shalt not couet thy neighbours hovvse or field &c. doe make two distinct commaundemētes, answering to the sixth and seuenth, as hathe beene sayde.
                  
                     The reasōs vvhy cōcupiscence of the fleshe, and concupiscence of temporall goods make tvvo commaundementes.And the reason of this opinion is, first, for that those two braunches: thovv shalt not haue straunge goddes before me: and thovv shalt not make vnto thee any grauen thing, or likenes to adore it &c, contayne in deed but one thyng, and therfore can not make two distinct commaundementes, as the protestantes teache, but one onelie commaundement. And consequentlie, these latter two must needes make two sundrie commaundemētes: or elles there could not be tēne. Secondlie, for that the septuagint or 70. interpreters, doe recite them distinctlie as two commaundementes, in their greke translation, repeating the verbe twyse, as I before haue alleaged them. Thyrdlie, because it was most couenient that the two generall internall consents vnto the two lustes of Carnalitie, 
                     1. Iohn. 2. and Couetousnes called by S. Iohn and distinguished by the names of Concupiscence of the fles
                           •
                        e: and concupiscence of the eyes: should be expresselye & particularlie forbydden by two distinct commaundementes. For that in these two fountaynes of poyson, doe lye the greatest and most daungerous baytes of synne in this lyfe. If you aske why the woorkes forbidden



in the other commaundementes, A doubt resolued. had not (for lyke reason also) theyr internall concupiscēces of lustes forbydden by distinct and seuerall commaundementes? it is answered, that the internall temptations against the other commaundementes, are nether so frequent, nor so daungerous, as these are: and consequentely they are sufficientlye prohibited, by the woordes sett downe in these commaundementes them selues that prohibet the woorks: partlie also their prohibitiō may be vnderstoode by the prohibition of these two internall concupiscences or lustes: 1. Ioh. 2. for whiche causes is problable that S. Iohn made mention of these two concupiscences onely, and not of any other, as in his sentence be
                        •
                     ore alleaged apearethe.
                  And now albeit these reasons and the lyke dyd moue S. Austen in his time, and many learned men sence, to deuyde the tenne commaundemēts in this order: yet is not the matter, a matter of faythe, nor so defined by the churche, as a man may not folowe an other opinion, yf yt seeme more reasonable vnto hym. For the auncient fathers had alwayes dyuers opinions abowt the diuision of the decaloge, or tenne commaundementes, without any difference of beleefe. For the Hebrewes (as 
                        Li. 3. ant. ca. 6. & 8. Iosephus, and Li. de decalog. Philo with whome also agreeth 
                        Li. 2. cont. haereses. ca. 42. Irenaeus) doe appoynt owt fyue commaundementes to the first table, concerninge the honour of God: & fyue to the second table, concerninge the loue of our neyghbour. But the Greekes, (as 
                        Ho. 8. in Exod.
                      Origen,

                        in ca. 26. Leuit.
                      Hesychius, with whome agree also S.

                      Ierome,) doe assigne fower to the fyrst table, and six to the second table. But S. Austen, and the most part of the latines foloweing hym, doe appoint onelie three preceptes to the first table, and seuen to the second. And yet all doe agree vppon tenne commaundementes. By all which may be seene the shameles dealing of M. Chark heere,

all hys felowes, in affirming euerye where in all theyr bookes and sermons to the people, that Catholiques leaue owt the second commaundement, 
                        VVhether Catholikes leaue ovvt the second commaundement against Idoles.
                      against grauen Idoles: where as they leaue it not owt, but doe include it in the first commaundement, and that for the same reasons whiche moued S. Austen to doe the same, as hath bene sayde. These earnest, odious, & slaunderous accusations, whiche our aduersaries in theyr owne cō
                     sciences doe know to be meere false, doe argue nothing for them, but onelie great malice in theyr hartes, singular lacke of modestie, and great shame in theyr behauyour, and extreeme pouertie, and necessitie in theyr cause.
                  
                     
                        Hovv one generall sinne may belong to tvvo commaundemē

                           es: that is, the consent of hart to one, & the ex

                           ernall vvoorke to an other.
                     M. Charkes second charge, that I make the seuerall breaches of tvvo diuers commaundementes but one synne, is also false. For I make them two distinct synnes, though they haue one generall name gyuen them by Christ: that is, I make the breache of the nyenth commaundement (after our account,) whiche is, thou shalt not couer thy neyghbours vvyfe, to be mentall adulterie, yf it goe no further, but onelie to cōsent of mynde. And the breache of the sixt cōmaundemēt, thou shalt not commit adulterie, I make to be the sinne of actuall adulterie, when it breaketh owt to the woorke it selfe: which two sinnes, thoughe they agree in the name of aldulterie: yet are they distinct sinnes often tymes, and one seperated from the other, and cōsequentely may be prohibited by distinst commaundementes
                        •
                      And so in lyke wyse I make actuall theft to belong to the seuenth commaundement, and mentall theft vnto the tenth. This is my meanyng (M. Charke): whiche you myght haue vnderstoode yf you wolde, and consequentlie haue forborne so malitiouse falshode in misreporting the same.
                  There remayneth onelie to be examined abowt this article, the reason touched by the Censure, and fownded on the scripture, for the cōfirmation of S. Austens Catholique exposition of the commaundement, Exod. 20. 
                     thou shalt not couet. VVhiche lawe (sayeth the Censure, forbyddeth onelye consent of hart to the motions of



lust, and not the verye first motions them selues, which are not in our power: & consequentlie, not comprehended vnder that prohibition of the lawe: as the scripture signifieth, when it sayeth, Deut. 30. 
                     this commaundement vvhiche I gyue thee this daye is not aboue thee. To this M. Charke answereth, first, that our first motions are not altogether ovvt of our povver. For that the guyft of continēcie dothe more and more subdue them. 
                     
                        VVhether all motiōs of lust may be extinguished by mortification:
                      VVhiche is true, if wee vnderstand of yeelding consent vnto them. But yf we vnderstand of vtter suppressing and extinguishinge of all first motions of lust and concupiscence: (as M. Charke must needes meane, our question beinge onelie therof) then must we know, that, albeit good mē doe cutt of by mortification, infinite occasions and causes of motions and temptations, whiche wicked men haue: yet can they neuer (during this lyfe) so subdue all motions them selues of theyr concupiscence, but that they will ryse often against theyr willes: as S. Paul complayneth of hym selfe in many places, and all other Saints after hym haue experienced in their fleshe: whoe notwithstanding, had the gyft & diligence of mortifieing theyr fleshe, asmuche (I weene) as our ministers of England haue, whoe talke of continencie & mortification (eche one hauinge hys yoke mate redye for hys turne) as those good felowes doe of fastynge, whiche sitt at a full table, according to the prouerbe.
                  To the place of Moyses, 
                        VVhether the cōmaundemētes, of God be impossible or no.
                      he hathe no other shyft but to saye: that the translation is false and corrupt, for that Moyses meant onelye, the lavve is not hydden from vs, and not, that it is not aboue our povver, as yt is euidentlye declared (saythe he) by the playne text, & by explication therof in the Epistle to the Romans. This sayeth M. Charke: mary he proueth yt nether by the woordes of the text, nor by S. Pauls application. But yf I be not deceyued, S. Ierome (whose trāslatiō this is esteemed to be, or els before him
                        •
                      & corrected by him) knew as well what the Hebrew woords of Moyses imported in the text, & also how S. Paul applyed thē, as williā Chark dothe. S. Pauls application of that parte of this sentēce which he towcheth,



maketh wholie for vs as after shalbe shewed. 
                        The lavve and commaundemē
                           tes are not aboue vs.
                      The Hebrew woord of the text is NIPHLET cōming of the verb PHALA: which, as I denie not, but it signifieth to be hidden: so signifieth it also, to be maruailous: to be hard & difficult: As appeareth psa. 139. & 2. Sam. 1. where the same woord is vsed. The same signifieth the Chaldie woorde M
                        •
                     PHARESA cōming of the verbe PHARAS, that besides the significations signifieth also to seperate. The greke woord HYPERONGOS signifieth (as all men knowe) exceeding, immesurable greate: passing all meane: &c Howe then doe not these three woordes vsed in the three aunciēt tongues, hauinge a negation putt before them (as they haue in the text) expresse so muche as S. Ierom hathe expressed, by sayeing, the lavve is not aboue thee? Doe not all these woordes putt together importe, that the lawe is not more hard, or difficult than thy abilitie may reache to perfourme? or that, it is not seperated from our power? that it is not exceedinge our strengthe? wolde any horse but bayard, haue beene so bolde with S. Ierō, and withe all the primatiue churche, whiche vsed this our common latine translation, to deface them all (I saye) vppon so lyght occasion? VVolde any impudencie haue durst it, besides the pryde of an heretique? If S. Ierom will not satisfie you:

Paul of parte of the sentence: and proueth owt of bothe, the verie same conclusion that we doe: to wytt, that the lawe is not aboue our abilitie to kepe it: and for confirmation therof, he addeth many other textes of scripture, Math. 11. 1. Ioh. 5. Li. de nat. & gr. c. 69 as, my yoke is svvete and my burden is lyght: also, his commaundementes are not heauye, and the lyke: concluding in these woordes, vve must beleeue moste firmelye, that God being iust and good, could not commaunde impossible things vnto man.

                  THE CENSVRE.
                  You report the Iesuites to saye: All things not expressed in scriptures. 
                     The holie scripture is a doctrine vnperfect, maymed, lame, not cōtaynyng all things necessarie to saith and saluatiō: Cen. fol. 220. you are too shameles (M. Charke) in setting forth these, for the Iesuites vvoordes. Lett anye man reade the place, and he shall finde noe such thing, but rather in contrarie maner the holie scripture vvith reuerent vvordes, most highlye commended. Notvvithstanding, they reprehend in that place Monhemius, for sayeing that nothing is to be receyued or beleued, but that vvhiche is expreslie found in the Scripture. Things beleeued vvhiche are not in scripture. For reproofe of vvhich heresie, they gyue examples of many things, vvhiche bothe vve, and our aduersaries also doe beleeue, vvhich neuerthelesse are not sett dovvne expreslye in the Scriptures, although perhaps deduced therof. As the perpetuall virginitie of our ladie after  her childebyrth: Tvvo natures and tvvo vvilles in  Christ: The proceeding of the holye Ghost equallie frō

Paul neuer mentioneth any epistle vvritten by hym selfe to the Romanes, but yet sayeth, that he vvrote one to the Laodicenses. Colos. 4. All these things (I saye) and many more, are beleeued by vs generallye, and yett none of them expreslie to be found in scripture.
               
               
                  THE DEFENCE.
                  To the charge of shameles belyeing the Iesuites, M. Chark answereth nothing but thus: 
                        A simple euasion.

And yet must not this shame lyght onelie on Gotuisus, as you wolde haue it: (though you neuer named hym in your other bookes) but vpon your selfe principallie. First, for that you had read this infamous lie refuted to kemnitius (of whome Gotuisus, woorde, for woorde hath borowed it) by payuas Andradius,

                      and proued to be (as it is) a moste shameles slaunder of his owne, and no one woorde of the Iesuites. Secondlie, you must needs haue seene (as no dowt but you had) that Gotuisus reported an open vntruthe, by the fower other places of Canisius, whiche he alleageth for the same, as well as the Censure of Colen: All which fower places any man that will reade, (for the booke is cōmonlie to be solde in England) shall see that Gotuisus is a shameles felow, and you a playne deceyuer, in that you cited onelie the Censure of Colen, (whiche you knew was not to be had,) & suppressed Canisius, which is extant to confound your vntruethe. These tryckes may admonish men that are not vtterlie willfull, how you are to be trusted in other matters of greater importance, wherin your falshoode can not be so easylie conuicted to the sight of all men, as in this, it is. Seeke all the bookes that euer the Iesuites wrote (whiche are manye) and yf you fynde in any one of them, any one



of these three odious woordes, wherwith you charge them: that is, imperfect, mamed, or lame, attributed to the scriptures: I will yeeld in all the rest that you affirme of them.
                  But you haue a shyft to couer your dealing heerin: and that is, that seing we holde, that all thinges necessarie to saluation are not written in the scripture: Therfore, we holde in effect (saye you, though not in woordes) that the scripture is imperfect, mamed, & lame. VVhiche reason yf yt were true: yet were your dishonestie great in settinge foorthe so odious woordes of your owne fayning, for the wordes of the Iesuites. But mark how voyde of reasō this argumēt of yours is. 
                        An euidēt example.
                      If a marchāt departing into an other countrie, shoulde leaue his cōmaundementes with hys seruantes, partlie in writing, partlie by woorde of mouth: might the seruantes saye, that he had left them a broken commaundement writen? but yf he should yet add further vnto them: that yf they dowted of any thing, they should repayre to hys wyfe, and she should fullie resolue them therin: might not he iustlie account hym selfe iniuried by thē, yf they notwithstanding should accuse hym for leauing them an imperfect, maymed, and lame commaundement? No more is it any defect to scripture, or gods cō
                     maundement, (as S. Austen proueth at large li. 1. contra Cresc. c. 32.) that God hathe lefte certayne things vnwriten: for that we may receyue the same by tradition in the churche, as that doctor proueth: Luc. 10. Ioh. 14. Math. 18. 1. Tim. 3. whiche Churche Christ hathe commended vnto vs, as his espouse in earthe, to be heard and obeyed by vs in all dowtes. The verie same doctrine teacheth the sayd father li. de fide, & oper. ca. 9. and also ep. 66. ad Don.
                  To the twelue particular poyntes sett downe by the Censure, as not contayned expresselie in scripture, and yet to be beleeued: M. Charke answereth, that seauen of them are in scripture, & the other fyue, for that they are not in scripture, 
                        The true state of the question.
                      they are not of necessitie to be beleeued. But heere is first to be noted, that the questiō betweene vs, and the protestātes is of expresse



scripture onelie and not of any farre fett place, 
                        Of thinges not expressed in scripture.
                      whiche by interpretation may be applyed to a cōtrouersie. For this contention beganne betwene vs vpō this occasion: that whē we alleaged diuerse weightie places and reasons owt of scripture for proofe of inuocatiō of Saints, prayer for the deade, purgatorie, and from other controuersies: our aduersaries reiected them, for that they dyd not playnelie and expresselie decide the matter. VVherupon came this question, whether all matters of beleef are playnelie and expresselie in scripture, or no? wh
                        •
                     che they affirme, and we denye. And for proofe of our part, we alleage all these twelue particulars, and many more, which are poyntes necessarilie to be beleeued, and yet not expresselie in scripture. For answere wherof you shall see how this man is distressed.
                  First he sayeth that seauen of them are contayned in scripture: Marie he flyeth from the question of expre
                        •
                     se scripture, and alleageth places a farre of, wherof the question is not. For the Censure graunteth that many of them myght be deduced from scripture, but not so expresselie, as they are to be beleued. Tvvo natures & tvvo vvilles in Christ. Rom 1. 34 Math. 26.
                      But lett vs runne ouer these seuen pointes, cōtayned (as he sayeth) manifestely in scripture. The first is of two 
                        ••
                     tures and two willes in Christ: for which he citeth these woords: Of his sonne vvhiche vvas made vnto hym of the seed of Dauid according to the fleshe. Also: not as I vvill, but as thou vvilt. But how doe theese woordes proue euidentlie the matter in question? That deductions heerof may be made from scripture (admitting the interpretation of the Churche vpon the places alleaged) I graunt: but that interpretation of the churche beinge sett asyde, & the bare text onelie admitted: these places can not conuicte an heretique, that wolde denye, ether the distinct natures, or distinct willes in Christ: as appeareth by the councell of Constantinople: where, after long stryuing in vayne with the Monothelit
                        •
                     s abowt this matter owt of scripture, Syn. 6. Act. 4. in the end they concluded in these woordes, vve beleeue this, for that, Apostolical and Euāgelical traditiō, & the doctrine of fathers haue taught it.
                  
                  
                     The second point is the proceeding of the holy ghost from the father & the sonne equallie. Proceeding of the holy ghost. Ioh. 15.26.
                      For this, M. Charke quoteth, vvhen the holye ghost shall come vvhiche I vvill send you from my father, the spirit of trueth, vvhiche proceedeth from the father. But this proueth not expresselie that the holie ghost proceedeth equallie from the father and the sonne together: but rather seemeth to inclyne to the heresie of the Greekes, that it proceedeth onelie from the father: And therfore the heretiques which denyed this equallye buylded their heresie especiallie vpon this place, as S. Cyrill noteth. Ciril. in ca. 15. Ioh. Athan. in symb. Agayne, this place telleth not whether it proceedeth by generation, or without generation from the father, and yet we must beleeue it to be without generation.
                  The third poynt is, 
                        The vnion of the vvoorde. Ioh. 1. v. 14 
                     the vnion of the vvoorde vnto the nature of man, & not vnto the persone. For which M. Chark citeth: And the vvorde vvas made fleshe. But what is this to the point? thys proueth, that the woorde tooke our fleshe, but whether he tooke the nature of man onelye, or the persone onelye, or bothe together, it expresseth not. And heere is to be noted by the waye M. Charks lacke of iudgemēt, not onelie in the matter, but euen in the verie termes of diuinitie. For he reprehendinge my woords as vnsounde, in that he vnderstoode thē not, he chaungeth thē thus. That the vvoorde dyd take the nature of man to be one persone, and not the persone. VVhiche are bothe fond and erroneous. For the woorde tooke not the nature of man to be one persone, seeing the woorde was one persone before he tooke that nature of man vnto it selfe. Nether could the nature of mā be that one persone, as M. Charke semeth to weene: for so should nature & persone be cōfounded in Christ. But I thinke M. Chark neuer studied yet these matters: and therfore he myght haue bene lesse malepert in reprehendinge, yf he wolde.
                  The fowerth doctrine is of baptizinge of infantes. Baptizinge of infantes Ge. 17. 12.
                      For which, M Charke quoteth these woordes of Genesis: The infant of eight years olde shalbe circumcised in mankynde. This hathe nothyng expresselye (as yow see)



for baptisme. And yf we had nothing but this lawe, for our warrant in baptizing of infantes: how chaunceth it, that wee baptize infantes, before or after the eight daye? also why baptize we infantes of woman kynde also, whiche were not circumcysed in the lawe?

                      as the byshope Claudius de Saynctes reporteth: whoe was present. VVherfore I had rather folow S. Austen, who contendeth, and proueth that baptizinge of infantes is onelye a tradition of the Apostles, and not left vs by anye written scripture. li. 10. c. 23. super Gen. ad lit. And the same teacheth Origen. ho. 8. in leuit.
                  
                     
                        Chaunge of the Sabbothe day.
                     The fyueth doctrine whiche M. Charke auoweth to be in scripture is the chaunge of the Sabboth daye into Sundaye. For which he citeth these woords owt of the reuelations. Apo. 1. 10. 
                     I vvas in spirit in our Lordes daye. But heere is no mention of Sundaye or Saturdaye; & muche lesse of celebratiō of ether of them, & leaste of all, of the chaunge of the Sabbothe (appointed by God) into any other daye. Is not this chaunge then of the Sabboth daye appointed by the law, substantiallie proued from this place of scriprure trow yowe?
                  
                     
                        Of the knovveinge of scripture.
                     The sixt poynt is abowt the fower Gospels and epistle to the Romanes: whiche he sayeth to be proued scripture, owt of scriptute. But yet he quoteth no place of scripture, where they are proued to be scripture: but onely sayeth, they are proued ovvt of the vuoords, by the inscription, there expressing the names of the vvryters therof. But what a mockerie is this? is the bare names of the Apostles, sufficient to proue that they were written in deed by the Apostles? whoe can proue owt of scripture that these names were not counterfayted? The fayned epistle to the Laodicenses, hathe it not the name of S. Paul, in it? and begynneth it not with the verie same style as his other epistles doe? and yet is it reiected as counterfaite, and that onelye by tradition. The fayned gospell of S. Bartholomew, had it not his name in it? and yet was it not reiected? 
                        Ho. in Luc.
                      The fayned Gospell of S. Thomas,



had it not his name? 
                        Orig. ho. 1. in Luc.
                      and yet Origen sayeth, he reiected it onelie, for that the tradition of the churche receyued it not. 
                        Epiph. li. 1. cont. heres. hebion. & li. 1. hae. 46. Au. li. 28. cont. faust. cap. 2. The three counterfait Gospells among the hebrewes, had they not as holy titles as the rest? and yet they were reiected by tradition of the churche as Epiphanius sheweth. VVhen Faustus the Manachie denyed the Gospell of S. Mathew, sayeth not S. Austen: Mathaei euangelium prolatū aduersus faustum Manachaeum per traditionem? The Gospell of Mathew was alleaged against Faustus the Manachie by traditiō. VVhat can be more euident than all this to proue our opinion of the necessitie of tradition, and to confound the fond madnes of this poore minister, that will haue the bare titles of bookes sufficient to proue their authoritie, and so certainlie, as the true scripture it selfe (once knowen) is to be beleeued?
                  The seuenth doctrine whiche he holdeth to be expresselie in scripture is, that God the father begatt his sonne onelie by vnderstanding hym selfe. 
                        The maner hovv God the father begat hys sonne.
                      Marye he citeth no place fort it: but reprehending the darkenes of the woordes, (which notwithstanding are most playne, and vsuall to those whiche haue studyed any thing i
                        •
                      diuinitie:) he flyeth to an other matter: sayeing, Ioh. 1. 1. Rom. 9. 5. 
                     vve beleeue by testimonie of the vvoorde, that Iesus Christ is the onelie begotten sonne of the father: And for this he quoteth a place or two of scripture: whiche needed not For we holde this to be expresselie in scripture, more than in fortye places,

                      But the question is of the manner howe this generation may be: whiche though it appertaine not to the simple to trouble them selues with all: yet the Church must defend it agaynst aduersaryes, whoe will obiect (as often they haue done) hovve can God (beyng a spirit) begett a sonne, and yet the sonne not to be after his father in tyme, or nature, but equall vvith hym in them bothe? vvhat mean you (saye they) to holde that the holye ghost proceedeth from the father, & that the sonne proceedeth not, but is begotten? vvhye is it heresie to saye, that the sonne proceedet

Charke seemeth ignorāt in them all, & not to vnderstand so much as the verie termes them selues, moste playnlie sett downe: yet Catholique diuines kuowe what the Churche hath determined heerin, against heretiques and infideles.

Remember you not that Heluidius was condemned of heresie, for denieing the same, in the primatiue Churche? Remember you not the solemne curse for this matter, of so many holie Byshopes recorded and confirmed by S. Ambrose of Millan? I will conclude and stoppe your mouth (yf I can) with these woordes of S. Austen: Integra fide credendum est &c. vve must beleeue vvith a sounde faith, blessed Marie the mother of Christ to haue conceiued in virginitie: to haue brought foorthe her sonne in virginitie, and to haue remayned a virgin after her childbyrth, nether must vve yeeld to the blasphemie of Heluidius. Loe (M. Charke) S. Austen maketh it bothe a matter of faith, & the dowting therof to be blasphemie: how will you auoyde thys?
                  For the mention which S. Paul is thought to make to the Colossians of an epistle written by hym to the Laodicenses, 
                        Col. 4.16. M. Charke denyeth it, and condemneth both me and S. Ieroms translation of ignorance: for reporting



the same for that (as he sayeth) the greeke text hath onelie of an epistle written by S. Paul from Laodicea, and not to Laodicea. But me thynketh M. Charke should not obiect ignorance so perēptorilye to others, except he were sure of his owne opiniō. If I had had no other vvarrantize for my allegation, but onelye the olde latin translation, being of suche antiquitie as it is, and the matter of no importance to our purpose: yet ought I not so rigourouslie to haue bene reprehended for the same. But besides this, I haue two editions in greeke: the one of learned Paguine in folio, the other of Plantyne in octauo: both whiche make playnlie for me. Then haue I the iudgement of S.

               Of the scriptures misalleaged for the contrarye, by M. Charke.
               
                  THE CENSVRE.
                  But hovv doe you novv ouerthrovve this doctrine, and prooue it blasphemie, M. Charke? By a place of S. Paule: 
                        Obiectiō. 2. Tim. 3.
                      All (the) scripture (is) geuen, by inspiration of God, (and) is profitable, to teach, to confute, to correcte, and to instructe in iustice, that the man of God maye be perfect, (and throughly) instructed to euery good worke. VVherof you inferre, that the Scripture is sufficient to perfection, but hovv vvrongefullye, it shall novv appeare. And first I let passe your ordinarie misusinge of scripture, by adding fiue vvordes of your ovvne, in this litle sentence, to vvit, (the, is, and, and, through
                        •
                     lie) vvhich audacitie, if it vvere in translating of Aesops fables, it vvere tollerable: but in the holie Scriptures, vvhere euerie vvorde must be taken as from the holie Ghoste, it is impious. Secondlie,



this place maketh nothinge for your purpose: vvhich I proue by tvvo reasons. The first is, because. S. Paule saieth not here, that the Scripture is sufficient to perfection, but onelie, that it is profitable. 
                        Profitable
                      Novv you knovv, that a thinge maie be verie profitable, yea nec
                        •
                     ssarie to an effecte, 
                        Neces

                           arie.
                      and yet not sufficiēt to doe the same vvithout all helpe: As meate is profitable and necessarie to maintaine lyfe, and yet not sufficient, vvithout naturall heate, clothes, and the like. The second reason is, for that S. Paule signifieth in this place, that euerie parte, or canonicall booke of Scripture, is profitable to make a man perfecte: but yet vve can not say, that euerie part or booke is sufficient: for then, all other bookes of scripture besides that, vvere superfluous. And that S. Paule meaneth in this place, euerie seuerall canonicall booke or parte of Scripture, by the vvordes (Omnis scriptura:) it is euident by that he vseth the vvorde, Omnis, and not Tota, vvich tvvo vvords hovv much they differ both in Greeke and Latine, all Logisioners knovv. For omins homo signifieth, euerie man. And M. Charke him selfe, in this verie same sentence, hath translated, Omne o
                           •
                        us bonum, Euerye good worke: And yet deceatefullye, hath he trā

                     lated Omnis scriptura, All the scripture. As though S. Paule had meante onelie, that all the Scripture put together is sufficient to perfection: vvhich sense can not stand. First, for that all the Scripture, at such time as. S. Paul vvrote this, vvanted diuers important partes, as the Ghospel of S. Iohn, the Apocalips, and some other, vvhich vvere vvritē after, & cōsequē

                     ufficient.. Secondly, Part of scripture loste. because vve lacke at this daye many parts of scripture, vvhich of likelyhoode vvere in S.

Charkes ovvne, sēse, that if all the scripture put together, is onely sufficient to perfection: then our scripture, novv lacking dyuers partes of the same, is not sufficient. And so me thinkethe, M. Charke vvrestethe this place againste hym selfe.
               
               
                  THE DEFENCE.
                  After a long apologie in defence of loose translatyng of scripture, (wherin M. Charke will perforce retaine opinion of honest dealing) he cōmeth to refute the first reason, about profitable and sufficient, & sayethe that sometimes profitable may stand for sufficient. 
                     1. Tim. 4. As where the Apostle sayeth to Timothie: Exercise thy selfe to god
                           •
                        ynes. For bodilye exercise is profitable but to a litle: but godlynes is profitable

                        ciēt. VVhich suppose were true: yet were it but a slender argumēt, of one particular to inferre an other. But (in myne opiniō) M. Charke is vtterlie deceyued in this matter. For as S.  
                        Com. in hunc locū.

                           Pietie. meriteth in all actions.
                        
                     
Austen doe expound this place: S. Paules meanyng is to putt an antithesis or differēce betwene corporall exercise & pietie: sayeing, that the one is but litle profitable, but the other (that is godlynes) hath her promysse of rewarde in all actions, taken ether for this lyfe, or for the lyfe to come: Out of all (I say) she reapeth cōmoditie, and is profitable. For in all actions, whiche are taken in hand for charitie and loue of God (whiche is true pietie:) therin is merit and rewarde, whether the actions be about matters of this



lyfe, or of the lyfe to come. And whoe wolde say heere that profitable signifieth sufficient?
                  His second reason he frameth in these woordes, vpon the place of S. Paul before alleaged: that vvhiche is profitable to all the partes that may be required to perfectiō, can not be but sufficient for the perfection of the vvhole: but that the scripture is profitable in suche maner, the Apostle doeth fullie declare, in rehearsing all the particular partes vvhiche are necessarie: as to confute, to correct, and instruct in iustice: ergo the scripture is sufficient. God help you (M. Charke:) I assure you: you are a simple one to take controuersies in hand. VVhat boye in Cambrige wold euer haue reasoned thus? If you had sayed, that whiche is sufficient to all the partes in particular, is sufficient to the whole: you had sayed somewhat. But how foloweth it, that what soeuer is profitable to all particular partes, should be sufficient to all? haue you not Learned that there is causa sine qua non, whiche is not one he profitable, but also necessarie to all partes, wherof it is such a cause: and yet is not sufficient alone, ether to the partes or to the whole? As (for example,) the heade is profitable, yea necessarie to all the actions of this lyfe, as to sing, weepe, dispute, and the lyke: for without a heade none can be done: and yet is not the head sufficient alone to performe these actions: as we see by experience. For that euery one whiche hath a heade is not able to doe these thinges.
                  Hys thyrd reason and argument is taken from the woordes of S. Paul immediatlie goeinge before in the place now alleaged to Timothie: whiche are these, 2. Tim. 3. 
                     for that thou hast learned the holye scrip
                           •
                        ures from thy infancie, vvhiche can instruct thee to saluation, throughe the faythe vvhich is in Iesus Christ. Loe (sayeth M. Charke) heer the scriptures are sayed to be sufficient to saluation. But I denye this. For the Apostle sayeth they can instruct Timothie, and shew him the waye to saluation, and can bryng hym also to it, yf he will folow them. But doeth it folowe heerby that they are sufficient for the whole churche? and in such sort as all doctrine by tradition is



superfluous? Euerie epistle of S. Paul instructeth a mā to saluation, & wolde also bryng any man to heauen, that shoulde folow the same exactlie. But is therfore euerie epistle of S. Paul sufficiēt for the whole Church? (wherof onelie our question is) and are all other supe
                        •
                     fluous? Againe, it is to be noted, that S. Paul speaketh heere principallie of the olde testament. For he speaketh of the scriptures which Timothie (beyng nowe a byshope) had learned from his infancie: whiche was before the newe testament was wryten. And will M. Charke saye, that the olde testament is sufficient to Christian men (such as Timothie now was) for their saluation, without any other write? You see this man lyke the hare in the nett: the more he struggleth, the more he encombreth and intangleth hym selfe.
                  To my two reasons in the Censure, to proue that S. Paul in the place alleaged spoke not onelye of all the whole scripture together, but also of euery particular booke therof, (whiche notwitstandinge can not be sayed to be sufficient of it selfe without other) he answereth in effect nothinge: but for excuse of his fraudulent translating Omnis scriptura: all scripture: where as he translated omne opus bonum, euerie good vvoorke, euen in the same sent
                        •
                     nce: he alleageth a place or two owt of the scripture, where this woord omnis signifieth all, aswell as euerie one.

                           •
                        . 21. VVhiche I denye not, but some times it may be: (especiallie in greek) but yet that there is ordinarilie a difference betwene these two propositions omnis homo

                        est corpus: and totus homo est corpus: I 
                        •
                     row your logicians of Cambrige (wherof you talke,) will affirme with me. And yf there be ordinarilie such a differēce, and your selfe obseruing the same in the former parte of the same sentence: why you showld alter your translation in the second part therof, I can not imagine, except you mente fraude.
                  But now to my two reasons. In the first, I saye that S. Paul coulde not meane to Timothie of all the scriptures together which we now vse. For that, all was not then written: as the Gospell of S. Iohn, and some



other partes. To this he answereth, that there was enough written then, for the sufficient saluation of men of that tyme, and that the other partes added afterwarde were not superfluous. But this is from the purpose. For I graunt, that in all tymes when there was least writen vvord, yet was there sufficient for the peoples saluatiō of that tyme. For God supplied it otherwyse: that is, by woorde of mouthe vnwritten. And this maketh for vs: for in suche tymes the written woord was not sufficiēt without all other helpes as you affirme it is: as (for exā
                     ple) when onelie S. Mathewes Gospell was written, and nothing els of the new testament: yet graunt I, that this scripture was sufficiēt for that tyme. For that, God supplied yt otherwyse, by the woordes and speeches of his apostles. So before Moyses wrote the lawe, the patriarches had sufficient for theyr saluation: thoughe they had ether nothinge, or verie litle writen woorde. And yet you can not saye, that the written woorde of that tyme was sufficient of it selfe, without all tradition by mouth. VVerfore this answere is against your selfe, as also that is, whiche you frame to the secōd reason: affirming that albeit dyuers partes of scripture be wanting now, whiche was in S. Pauls tyme: yet still it is sufficiēt whiche I denye not, being ioyned to the other supplies that God vseth. For God supplieth by tradition and woorde of mouthe. 
                        The true state of the controuersie abovvt the sufficiencie of scripture. Epiph in haer. 61. But whether in all tymes the onelie written woord, that is extant, be sufficient of it selfe to the whole Churche, without all other helpes deliuered by tradition: that is our question. And of times past, when the law was not written, no man without impudencie can affirme, that the written woorde was then sufficient. And of our tyme, that is, after the writinge of the new testament, Epiphanius sayeth:
Non omnia a diuina scriptura accipt possunt, quapropter aliqua in scripturis, aliqua in traditione sancti. Apostoli tradiderunt.
                     All things necessarie, can not be had from the scripture: And therfore the holie Apostles left vnto vs some thinges writtē and some thinges by tradition. VVhich signisieth sufficientlie what Iudgement the primatiue Church had of



this matter: as more at large shalbe shewed in the article foloweing: whiche is also of this same argument.

But let all thinges be lavvfull vnto you: vvhat maketh this lavv for your pourpose? By your meaning the Apostles and Euāgelistes did offend, in adding any thing besides the lavve of Moyses, vvhiche is absourd. Nether did Moyses in this place (forbiddinge to adde or take avvaye) speake of his vvrytten lavve (for he had not yet vvritten it) but of those thinges vvhich he deliuered thē by vvorde of mouthe at that time, the vvhich he vvilled them to keepe and obserue vvhollye and perfectly, vvithout chaunginge it by addition, or diminution, or by their ovvne corrupte gloses, as naughtie men are vvonte to doe: And this is the true meaninge of that place, and not as you vvould haue it, that nothinge should be beleeued besides that vvhiche

                  THE DEFENCE.
                  Heere agayne M. Charke disburdeneth hym selfe vpon Gotuisus: sayeing, If the Censure of Colen hathe no suche vvordes: Gotuisus fayled in vvriting their booke. 
                     
                        Gotuis. ca. 1. antith. 2. But gentle sir wiliam: this matter is not so shyfted of. You knew that Gotuisus: tooke these woordes from kemnitius, against whome they were proued false by Payuas, before you wrote your booke, as the most of his other reportes were. How chaunceth it then you wolde vtter thē agayne without seeing the originall, whether they were true or no? Besyde this, Gotuisus citeth Canisius for the same woordes, 
                        Canis. in opere Cate. fol. 162. where no one suche woorde is to be fownd: whye looked you not in Canisius to see yt? or whye had you not cited Canisius in your Margent, as well as the Censure of Colen, which you well knew was not to be had? whye dyd you conceale Canisius, I saye? can you be excused from willfull dishonest dealyng in this matter? No, no, your desperate resolution is to-too euident.
                  But (saye you) we holde the doctrine, thoughe the Iesuites haue not the woordes. VVhat doctrine M. Chark? that the want of holie scripture must be peeced owt by traditiōs? It is false. VVe speake not so vnreuerētlie of the scripture, as shall better appeare by the article foloweyng. VVe doe not teach that the scriptures are wanting, or neede to be peeced. It is your hereticall malice which deuiseth these woordes. Though bothe partes of gods woord, that is, both written & vnwrittē, be necessarie vnto gods Church: yet both of thē do stād in their full perfection assigned them by God: nether is the one a mayme, or impeachement to the other: no more than is S. Lukes Gospell to that of S. Mathew: or S. Pauls epistles to any of them bothe. For as you may not saye that S. Mathewes Cospell is maymed, for that



S. Lukes is also admitted: or that S. Pauls epistles are a peecing vp of the former Gospells: no more can we saye that gods woorde left vs by mouthe in tradition is a

                     ayme, or detraction to that, whiche he hath left vs in writing: or that in writing to be a disanullyng of that whiche we had by tradition: for that, bothe are partes of gods woord, & of equall authoritie: as shalbe shewed more largelie in the twelueth article, together with certaine meanes how to knovv and discerne the same. VVherfore these odious speeches against the dignitie of holie scripture doe procede onelie from the malice of you our aduersaries, and of no cause or matter ministred by vs.
                  After certaine tryflyng speeche to litle purpose M. Charke concludeth peremptorilie this article in these vvoordes. To conclude, it is a great iniquitie to adde traditions, or your vnvvritten  
                     
                        Greate iniquitie to adde one veritie to an other, or to beleeue tvvo verities together.
                      
                     verities to the vvrytten vvoord of God, vvherunto no man may adde: because nothing is vvantynge: and to hym that addeth shall the curses vvritten in the booke be added for euer, cityng in the Margēt, the place of the Apocalips, vvhiche sayeth, that vvho soeuer addeth or taketh avvaye from that booke of prophecie, shall incurre the plagues vvritten in that booke. 
                     Apoc. 22. But good Lorde: when vvill these men leaue to abuse the scriptures, & learne to speake to the purpose? yf vvee beleeue all that is vvritten in that booke of reuelations, and other things besides reuealed vnto vs els vvhere by God: doe vve incurre this curse of S. Iohn therby? S. Iohn sayeth nothing may be added or taken awaye from the perfectiō of that most excellēt & mysticall booke of reuelations: but dyd he meane heerby that nothing should be credited besides that vvhiche is there vvritten? S. Iohn hym selfe vvrote diuerse things vvhich are not in the Apocalips:

And yet (I thynke) by this additiō of his Gospell, he did not runne into the curses of that booke. How thē is this place alleaged agaynst vs for beleeuyng those thynges whiche our auncetours haue delyuered vnto



vs, as receyued from the mouth of Christ and his Apostles? how holdeth this argument, no man may adde to the booke of Apocalips: ergo, no man may beleeue a traditiō of Christ, or his Apostles? May not a man aswell inferre, ergo we may not beleeue the actes of the Apostles? But this is their common alleaging of Scriptures.
                  It is Lamentable to see the sleight dealings of these men in matters of suche importance. It is a great iniquitie (sayeth Charke) to add traditions, or your vnvvritten verities to the vvritten vvorde of God. VVhat meane you (Sir) by adding? whoe doeth add? or in what sense? If God left any doctrine by tradition vnto the Churche, and our auncetours haue deliuered the same vnto vs, especiallie those of the primatiue Churche: what shall we doe in this case? shall we refuse yt? It seemeth daungerous: and I see no reason. For the same men that delyuered vnto vs the scriptures, and sayed, this is gods written woorde, and sayd of other forged scriptures, this is not gods written woorde: the same delyuered vnto vs these doctrines, sayeinge, this is Gods woorde vnwritten. As for example,

                     ation for the dead are traditions of the Apostles. 
                        Li. de spi. S. cap. 27. S. Basil teacheth, that the consecration of the font before baptisme, the exorcisme vppon those that are to be baptized, theyr anointing with holie Chrisme, and diuers lyke thinges are delyuered vnto vs by prescript of Christ and his Apostles. Thus testifie these men, and no man in the Churche controlled theyr testimonie at that tyme: wherby it is euident that all that Churche beleeued it. Nowe, what shall we doe, when these and many other lyke things are delyuered vs by our fore-fathers, the doctors, and cheefe pyllers of Christ his Churche? shall we reiect, and discredit them? wherfore? or vppon what ground! these men were nearer to the



Apostles tymes than we are by many hundred yeeres: and therfore could better tell than we can, what the Apostles left by tradition, or left not. Agayne, they were no dishonest men, and consequentlie wolde not write a lye or deceyue vs wittinglie. And yf they wolde: yet other men wolde haue controlled them. VVhye then should it be suche iniquitie in vs to receyue and beleeue the traditions which they deliuer vs, as M. Chark sayeth it is? If they come from the mouthe of Christ & his Apostles, as thes fathers doe affirme: then are they parte of Gods woorde also, as well as the other whiche are written.
                  But you will saye (I knowe) they come not from Christ and his Apostles. And how (I praye you) can you proue that to me? whye should I beleeue you rather than these holye fathers, whiche lyued so long agoe? I doe not see (fot example sake) why I should beleeue a CHARKE, or a FVLKE commyng but yesterdaye from the Grammer Schoole, before a Cyprian, a Tertulian, a Basil, a Ierome, a Chrysostome, an Ambrose, or an Austen, especiallie in a matter of fact (as our case is:) seyng they lyued more than twelue or thyrtene hundred yeeres nearer to the deed doeing, than these ministers doe: and yet to this extremitie am I driuen. For hearken a litle how D. Fulck handleth these men about traditions. S. Cyprian is alleaged agaynst hym, sayeing, that the mynglyng of wyne and water in the Chalice is the tradition of Christ hym selfe Fulke: 
                        Against Martiall pag. 170. 
                     but yf Cyprian had bene vell vrged, he vvolde haue better considered of the matter. Tertulian is alleaged, sayeing, that the blessing with the signe of the crosse is a tradition of the Apostles: Fulke: 
                        Ibidem. pa. 178. 
                     Tertulians iudgement of tradition vvithout scripture in that place is corrupt. S. Basil is alleaged for the same matter, affirmyng the custome of blessing with the signe of the crosse to be an Apostolicall tradition: Fulke: 
                        Ibidem. pa. 178. 
                     Basil is an insufficient vvarrant for so vvoorthie a matter. S. Ierome is alleaged, sayeing, that Lent fast is the tradition of the Apostles: Fulke: 
                        Against Bristoes motiues. pa. 35 
                     Ierome vntruelye ascribeth that tradition to the Apostles. S. Chrisostom is alleaged, sayeing, 
                        •
                     hat the



Apostles decreed that ī the sacrifice of the Aultar, there should be made prayer for the departed: Fulke: vvhere he sayeth, it vvas decreed by the Apostles &c, he muste pardon vs for crediting hym, because he can not shevv it ovvt of the Actes and vvritings of the Apostles.

                     vvhoe is vvytnesse that this is the tradition of the Apostles? you vvill saye, Tertulian, Cyprian, Austen, Ierome, and a great many moe. But I vvolde learne vvhye the Lord vvould not haue this setforth by Mathevv. Marke, Luke, or Paul? vvhy they vvere not chosen scribes heerof, rather than Tertulian, Cyprian, Ierome, Austen, and other suche as you name? But this is a counterfait institutiō, & fained traditiō. And in other place beyng vrged by the lyke, he discrediteth all antiquitie: sayeing,

                  Heere now are sett before me a payre of balances, with fulke and Charke in one ende: and Cyprian, Origen, Tertulian, Basil, Ierome, Chrisostome, Epiphanius, and Austen, in the other ende: for all these fathers (as you see) affirme constanlie traditions of Christ and his Apostle, besides the written woord: Fulke and Charke denye the same. They alleage particular examples: Fulk opposeth hym selfe to them all. But whiche in reason should I rather beleeue? You shall heare some of them speake. S. Basil the great was a mā (I trow) to be matched in credit with Charke the minister. His woords are these:

                  Heere now are S. Basil and VV. Charke at an open combate abowt traditions, The one sayeth, it is iniquitie to admitt them: The other sayeth, it is ignorance to reiect them. The one sayeth, they are of no authoritie or credit at all: The other sayeth, they are of equall force and authoritie vvith the vvritten vvoord of Christ and his Apostles. VVhome will you rather beleeue in this case?

                     VVith S. Basil taketh parte Eusebius, sayeinge, Christi discipuli ad magistri sui nutum, illius praecepta partim literis, partim sine literis quasi iure quodam non scripto, seruanda commendarunt. The disciples of Christ at theyr Maisters beck, dyd commend his precepts to posteritie, partlie in writing; partlie without writing, as it were by a certaine vnwriten lawe.
Marke heere, that traditiō is called an vnvvritē lavve: & the things delyuered therby are the precepts of Christ: and that they were left vnwryten by the becke or appointment of Christ hym selfe.
                  
                     
                        Heresi. 61.Epiphanius is yet more earnest than Eusebius. For writing against certaine heretiques named Apostolici, whiche denyed traditions, as our protestants doe: he proueth it thus: 1. Cor. 11. 14.15.
                     Oportet autem & traditione vti: Non enim omnia a diuina scriptura accipi possunt. Quapropter aliqua in scripturis, aliqua in traditione sancti Apostoli tradiderunt, quemadmodum dicit Sanctus Paulus: Sicut tradidi 
                           •
                        obis: & alibi, sic doceo, & sic tradidi in ecclesiis:
                     we muste vse traditiō also. For that, all thyngs can not be had owt of Scripture. For which cause, the holye Apostles haue delyuered some things to vs in scriptures, and some thyngs by traditions, according as S. Paul sayeth: euen as I haue left vnto you by tradition: And in an other place: This doe I teache, & this haue I left by traditiō in Churches.
                     
Heere you see Epiphanius doeth not onelye affirme so much as we holde, but also proueth it out of Scripture.

                     VVith Epiphanius ioyneth fully and earnestlye S. Chrisostome, writyng vpon these woordes of S. Paul to the purpose: State & tenete traditiones: Stand fast, and holde traditions. Out of which cleere woordes S. Chrisostome maketh this illation. Hinc patet quod non omniae



per epistolam tradiderint, sed multa etiam sine literis. Eadem verò fide digna sunt tam illa quám ista. Ita

                     By these woordes of S. Paul it is euident, that the Apostles delyuered not all by epistle (or writing) vnto vs: but many things also whiche are not wrytten: And yet those are as woorthie fayth as the other. For whiche cause, we esteeme the tradition of the Church woorthie of faythe. It is a tradition: seeke no more abowt it.
VVhat can be spoken more effectualie against VV. Charke than this? Is it now greate iniquitie to receyue traditiōs, or no? how will he auoyde this vniforme cōsent of antiquitie against his fond malepeartnes, condemning all traditions for iniquitie? Heere you see are the verie woordes auowed (as also in S. Basil alleaged before) which these new maisters doe so odiouslye exaggerate to the people dailie, that we matche traditiōs with the written woord of God. These woordes (I saye) are heere maintained bothe in Chrisostome and Basil, affirming the vnwrytten traditions of Christ and his Apostles to be of equall force, and authoritie with the written woorde of the same: And yet I trowe, were they not blasphemous for sayeing so, as these yonge gentlemen are accustomed to call vs.
                  And this now in generall, that traditions are: that is, that diuers things belonging to faythe are left vs vnwriten, by Christ and his Apostles: Also, that this sort of traditions are of equall authoritie with the wrytten woord: because they are the vnwritē or deliuered woorde. But now yf any man wolde aske me, 
                        Diuers apostolical traditions in particular.
                      what, or which are these Apostolicall traditions in particular: I could alleage hym testimonies owt of the auncient fathers, for a great number: wherof some examples haue bene gyuen in the former article. But lett any man reade S. Cyprian, Serm: de ablut: pedum: Tertullian de coron: miiltis: and S. Ierom. Dialog. cont. luciferianos: and he shall finde store. And albeit, some thing hathe bene sayd of S. Austen before: yet will I adde these few examples owt of hym, for endinge of this article. He proueth the



baptisme of infants by tradition of the Churche:

                  I omitt many other suche thinges, whiche aswell this learned doctor, as other most holye fathers of the primatiue Churche, doe auouche, by onelye tradition of Christ and his Apostles, without writing: whiche to beleeue or credit, if it be such great iniquitie and blasphemie, as VV. Charke will haue vs to esteeme: then were these auncient fathers in a miserable case, and this new minister in a fortunate lot. But yf the countenance of this new Sir doe not surpasse the credit of those olde Saints: I weene it will not be hard to iudge how fond and foolishe hys raylinge speeche ys against a doctrine so vniformlie receyued in Christ his Churche, as the doctrine of traditions hath bene from the beginning.

yf you may haue your desire.

                      and yet is no serpent: Also to a couetous Vsurer, and yet is none: Nether doth the Scripture committ blasphemie in vsing such similitudes. But hovv proue you (M. Charke) that the scripture maye not be vvrested into manye senses before the rude people, as a nose of vvaxe maye be into manye formes? Because it is cōtrarye (saye you) vnto the vvordes of Dauid:

Doe you translate, Lex domini immaculata: The Lavve of the Lorde is perfecte in sense, soe that it maye not be vvrested to a vvrōg interpretation? This is maruelous. Immaculata signifieth in these countries, vnspotted, voyde of filthe, or dishonestie, vvherevvith prophane vvritinges are often times defiled: But the lavv of God is deuoyde of all suche thinges, and therefore conuerteth soules, vvhereas other vvritinges doe often tymes corrupt them: But that Immaculata can not be translated, perfecte in sense, it is euidente by this, that euerye sillable and vvorde in Gods Lavve is vnspotted, but yet not perfecte in sense, & muche lesse so cleare, as it may



not be peruerted to an euill meaninge: vvherby your fraudulente translation is discouered.

But that you are the same man, which you were before (that is, most false and shameles in your avouchementes) it shall nowe appeare. You saye heere of Andradius twoo things: First, that he playnlye confesseth, and acknowlegeth the matter: Secondlye, that he cryeth not owt agaynst kemnitius for this report. And for bothe these things, you quote Andradius in the hundred & fowertie page of his second booke. As for the first, lett anye man see the place by you quoted, and yf Andradius confesse any more of the matter, than is sett downe in the Censure it selfe: lett hym beleeue you an other tyme vppon your woorde. For the second, it is to-too impudent. For albeit Andradius had not altogether so much cause to take stomach against kemnitius as I haue against you, for makyng a greater lye than he dyd, as shalbe shewed: yet lett the reader vewe ouer but the two pages, 
                        pag. 102. & 103. whiche goe immediatlie before that whiche you cite, & he shall see nothing els in them but a moste earnest & sharpe inuectiue against kemnitius, and all other protestāts, for malitious slaundering, and misreporting the

                     esuites. And among other things Andradius sayeth there, that for a great

                  But (as I sayed before) Andradius had not so much cause of Choler against kemnitius, as I haue against M. Charke: for that he doeth not onelie report againe an open vntrueth, whiche he knewe to be a lye before he repo

                     ted it: but also hath corrupted, and falsified that lye, to make yet a greater lye. VVhiche thyng that you may see, I will heere laye downe the verie woordes bothe of kemnitius, & of Gotuisus M. Charkes author: 
                        Shameles dealing of M. Charke: Gotuisus in Antithetis: pag. 216. for that their woordes are the selfe same: and Gotuisus tooke them syllable for syllahle from kemnitius. Gotuisus woordes then are these: The Iesuites saye, that the holye scripture in those thyngs vvhiche it contayneth and settetb forth, is, as it vvere, a nose of vvaxe, not yeelding any certaine and immouable sentence, but such as may be vvrested into any interpretation. Censura Colon. fol. 117. & in opere catechestico Canisij fol. 44. For this false report of kemnitius against the Iesuites, Andradius falleth into the lōg and vehement inuectiue wherof I spake before. But what should I doe heere with VV. Charke? or rather what should the reader think of hym, for so great a falshoode, as in this place he vseth? for first he concealeth the quotatiō of Canisius fol 44, as well in his first book, as also in his second replye. And the cause heerof is (as often hath beene noted before) for that the quoting of Canisius, according as he found hym quoted in his author, wolde haue discouered the lye, which M. Chark hoped to conceale by passing ouer Canisius, and cyting onelye the Censure of Colen, whiche he was sure no man coulde fynde in England. And is this dealing excusable?
                  Secondlie, owt of the large sentence of Gotuisus nowe repeated, M. Charke tooke onelie three or fower woordes, that seemed most odious, and yet falsified too,



therby to make them more odious. For wher as Gotuisus sayeth, the Iesuits holde the scriptures to be as it vvere a nose of vvaxe: M. Cha

VVhat shall a man say of this ministers falshood? shall we beleeue any longer this puritane protestation of playne and simple dealing in the lord? what hypocriticall deceyuing of the reader is this?
                  And thus muche for the slaunder and falshoode in reportinge. But now to come to the matter it selfe: the Censure graunteth, that vppon certayne circumstances the Iesuites doe compare the hereticall wre

                     ng of a nose of waxe into many formes. Mary the circumstances of this comparison are these. Fyrst, that they speake not in respect of the scripture in it selfe: but in respect of heretiques and other wicked men, which abuse scripture. Secondlye, they add, apud rudem populum, qui iudicare non potest. This abuse and wrestinge of scripture happeneth commonlie before the rude and ignorant people, whiche can not iudge of the deceyt. Thirdlye, they adioyne, vt palpentur vitia principum aut vulgi. Heretiques doe it to flatter the princes or people present, in theyr vices. By whiche woordes they signifie the fauour of the hearers. All these circumstances the Iesuits laye downe, when they compare the scripture abused to a nose of waxe wrested. And who is so foolishe but will cōfesse, that a lewd and wicked man in an ignorant audience, & where all men fauour his doctrine (for that he flattereth them in theyr sinnes:) maye wrest & abuse the holye scripture (as men are wonte to bend a nose of wax) to what plausible sense it lyketh hym best? No mary (sayeth M. Chark) it can not be.

                        It is no fault of scripture that heretiques abuse it.
                      It is no fault of holye scripture, that wicked men may abuse it. For the more excellēt a thing is, the more easie and pernicious is the abuse therof. Christ was the excellētest benefit that euer God gaue vnto this worlde: and yet is he called notwithstanding, Rom. 9.

VVherfore it is true (vvhiche is sayde) that the holye scripture is an hereticall booke: that is, suche a booke as heretiques most of all leane vnto.
And a litle after: Haereseon liber biblia sunt: The bible is a booke of heresies. Oh that the Iesuites had vsed suche vvoordes: hovv vvold VV. Chark and his felovves haue triumphed against them for the same? And yet (thoughe Martin Luthers fashion vvas to runne ouer the shooes, in what soeuer he tooke in hād) I thinke he meant nothing in these vvoordes, against the dignitie of scripture. For he addeth in the verie place alleaged,

                        Scriptura sancta haereseon liber est, non sui causa, sed istorum nebulonum qui eam deprauant. The holie scripture is a booke of heresies, not of it selfe, but by the meanes of those knaues, vvhiche doe peruert yt.
This is father Luthers swete benediction vppon sacramentaries: vvherof (I trowe) M. Charke will not deny hym selfe to be one.
                  And thus you see that the Iesuites haue not onelie trueth and reason on their syde, to vse that comparison: but also haue examples in this kynde: both of auncient fathers, and of our aduersaries them selues. VVhat intemperat malice then is this of william Charke, so to raue against them, for this one cōparison, vsed without all derogation of Scripture? yf they had spoken euill of



any scripture in it selfe: yf they had reiected any one booke therof, as protestants doe many: yf they had discredited or defaced any one sentence therof, as Luther dothe most odiouslie the whole epistle of S. Iames: 
                        Vide sixt. sent. li. 7. biblio.
                      yf they should saye any booke of the scripture to be written with a profane and ambitious spirit, as your D. Fulk doeth of the Machabies: 
                        Against purg. pag. 209. yf they should ieste at the Angell Raphaell in the booke of Tobie, as M. VVhittaker doeth: or fall to that extreme impudencie, as to reuyle in open audience any holie person cōmended in sacred wryte, 
                        Against M. Campiā pa. 18. as you dyd (M. Chark) without shame, when you called that blessed womā of God, Iudith, vnchaste Iudith, in your disputations with M. Campian: yf the Iesuites (I saye) should saye, or doe any of these thynges, as you are driuen to doe: then myght you iustlie accuse thē, & drawe thē into hatred, for deprauing of gods woorde. But seing they doe not soe, but alltogether the cōtrarie: seyng they defend gods whole woord agaynst you, that offerre violence to the same: seyng they maintayne the number of bookes, which antiquitie hath left thē: the vnwrittē traditiōs that the Apostles haue delyuered them: the Catholiques expositiōs which auncient fathers haue assigned them: seyng they nether choppe nor chaunge, nor corrupt nor put owt, nor cōtēptuouslie reiecte anie one thing, as you doe infinite, for maintainyng of your ruynous, and most impious cause: you endeuour in vayne to discredit them, by exaggerating one poore comparison or similitude, whiche they vpon occasion vsed, to expresse the wickednes of you heretiques that abuse scripture: and not to attribute any imperfection to scripture it selfe.
                  No man in the world euer spake more reuerentlie of holye scripture, than Iesuites doe. 
                        The Iesuits most reuerent speeche of holie scripture.
                      And whether they seeke to execute it in lyfe, as muche as our ministers of England or no: let them be iudges that know bothe theyr conuersatiōs. I myght heere alleage infinite testimonies owt of theyr workes, how & with what reuerence they speak of scripture. But one place onelie of Canisius shall serue for this tyme. He hath wryten two large



and learned volumes of the corruptions of gods woorde,

These are Canisius a Iesuites woordes. And doe these men speak baselye of scriptures, as M. Chark heere accuseth them?
                  
                     Psal. 18. v. 7.But now we come to examine the text alleaged by M. Chark agaynst the Iesuites to wytt, Lex domini immaculata: "the law of our Lord is vnspotted, or vnd

                     filed: which M. Charke wolde haue to signifie: that the scripture is so perfect & playne in sense, as no wicked man may wrest or abuse the same. For whiche absurd reasoninge and wrestinge of scripture, he being now reproued by the Censure: heare what he answereth, and how he defendeth hym selfe. The Censure (sayeth he) supposeth me to haue but one Byble, and that of the olde translation onelie, vvhich hathe, [the lavve of the Lord is vndefiled] &c. but the original hath: [the lavve of the Lord is perfect.] And the best translations haue so translated it. your olde translation goeth alone. The 70. folovv the rest. Heere you see that M.  Charke bryngeth diuers reasons for his defense. First, that he hath diuers Bybles in his house, and that of  diuers translations. Secondlie, that the original or hebrew text of this verse in the Psalme, hath not immaculata: that is, vndefiled or vnspoted: but rather perfect, in  that sense as he defendeth it. Thirdlie, that all the best translations haue it so: and that our olde translation  differeth from them all. Fouerthlie, that the septuagint or seuentie greke interpretours are also against vs here in. This is all M. Charkes defense.
                  But here by the waye wolde I haue the reader to Marke, how muche M. Charke getteth to hys cause.



Yf I should graunt hym all that he hathe here sayd: surelie he should gayne onelie, that the law of God, is perfect. And is this against any thinge that we saye or holde? or is it against the signification of the woord immaculata in the olde latin translation, whiche he impugneth? Is not a thinge immaculate or vndefiled also, called perfect? euen as on the contrarie, a filthie or defiled thinge, is called imperfect? If then we should graunt that the hebrew and greeke textes had the woord perfect in them, in steed of the latin woord immaculata: yet this dothe not condemne the olde translation for vsing the woord immaculata, immaculate. For that immaculate (as hath bene shewed) signifieth also perfect from spot: mary not perfect in that sense, wherin M. Charke talketh: and for proofe wherof he alleaged this sentence: to witt, that because the law of the lorde is perfect, therfore the scripture can not be wrested: whiche is a most false and absurd illation vppon the worde perfect. For S. Paules epistles are persect together withe other scriptures: and yet S. Peter sayeth that many men dyd wrest and depraue them. 2. Pet. 3. But now lett vs consider the seuerall fower pointes of M. Charkes former answer, whiche (as yow see) if wee should graunt vnto him, without contradiction, yet had he gayned nothing therby. But lett vs examine them.
                  Touching the first whiche he answereth: that is, abowt the varietie of Bybles and translations, which he hath at home, I will not stand or cōtend with M. Chark. Let hym haue as many as he please: the matter is, howe well he vnderstandeth, or reporteth those Bybles, and not how many he hath. The second poynt is false, that the hebrew text disagreeth from the olde latin translation: as shalbe shewed after. The thyrd is fond, that all the best translations doe differe from the olde translation heerin. 
                        The olde latin trāslation.
                      For what best, or better, or other good latin translation hath he, than the olde, whiche was in vse in gods Churche aboue thirtene hundred yeeres past: as may be seene by the citations of the fathers, whiche lyued then? whiche was afterwarde also ouervewed



& corrected by S. Ierom?

                     mended by S. Augustin? what other better translation (I saye) hath william Charke than this auncient, which he so contemneth? except he will name some latter of our tyme, as of Erasmus, Luther, or the like: whiche Beza hym selfe notwithstandinge affirmeth to be nothing lyke the olde trāslatiō for exactnes. The fowerth poynt which he addeth is a shameles lye, that the septuagint in greeke doe dissent from the woorde immaculata in the latin. For their woorde is AMOMOS, AMOMOS. which their owne lexicon will expound vnto them to be immaculate, innocent, irreprehensible.
                  
                  
                     TAMAM or TAM.To returne therfore in a woorde or two to the originall text, the hebrew woorde is TAMAM, or TAM which the septuagint doe interpret (as you haue heard) AMOMOS: that is, irreprehensible: and the auncient latin translation immaculata, 
                     
                        Abouvt the trāslation of immaculata.
                      immaculate. And what refuge then can M. Charke fynde heere? I doe not denye, but that it signifieth also, perfect: for that, what soeuer is irreprehensible and without spott, may also be called perfect, as hath bene shewed. But how doeth this proue that it signifieth to be perfect in sense, in suche sorte, as it may not be wrested, or peruerted? In the 118. Psalme where our auncient translation hath beati immaculati in via: 
                        An. 1549 your owne englysh bible hath translated it (M. Charke) blessed are those that be vndefyled in the vvaye: and the Hebrew and greeke woordes are TAM, & AMOMOS, as in the other text. How then doe you rayle at our olde auncient translation for that wherein your new englishe byble doth the verye same? the lyke you may see in infinite other places: as leuit. 3. v. 1. & 6. Also Num. 6. v. 14. VVhere sacrifices are appointed to be immaculate, according to the auncient tranflation. And your englishe byble translateth it so too, sayeinge they must be without blemishe: where the hebrew and greeke woordes are TAM and AMOMOS, as before.
                  By whiche is seene, that M. Charke careth not whether he runneth, what he forgeth, or whome he reprehendeth, so he maye seeme allwayes to saye somewhat:



And of all other shyftes, this is the last, and the easiest, and of most credit, and least able to be spyed of his reader, (as he thinketh) to inueighe against the olde latin translation, when he is pressed vnauoydablye with any place of scripture alleaged. For this shyft, besides the present couering of the difficultie, yeeldeth also some opinion of Learning to his Maister, gyuinge men to vnderstand, that he is skillfull in the learned tongues: whereas God knoweth, the refuge is vsed for bare miserie: as it alwayes appeareth, when it cōmethe to examination. And this shall suffice for this sixt article.
