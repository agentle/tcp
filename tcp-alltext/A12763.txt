READER.
            THis small Tract, now aboue two
yeeres past, was by mee printed for
that worthy Knight the Authour thereof,
with no intent to haue it published:
and being hitherto by me suppressed from
reprinting here at home; I find it to bee
of late time printed in Scotland (contrary
both to the Authours and my expectation)
and Dedicated by another man
to the Bishops and Cleargy there, and so
made more publike, being of it selfe priuate,
then was first intended: which (I
suppose) had the Author knowen,
or once misdoubted the sequell, instead
of De non temerandis Ecclesiis,
hee would haue studied another Title,
De non temerandis Scriptis
alienis: that his writings might

not be impropriated, when Benefices are
made proper. Wherefore finding many

                from his copie, I haue (as well
in the right of the Authour as of my
selfe to whom the right of the sole Printing
belonged) caused it to be reprinted.
And though at th

the Author, he being then in the Countrey,
yet hath it pleased him since his
comming home, to adde something more
vnto it, as his leasure would permit him;
which I haue annexed to the end therof.
And thus haue I attempted to make a
priuate worke publike, lest the faults of
other men, should vniustly he cast vpon
him, that deserued so well in so rare an
Argument.

               AL the vessels of the
Kings house, are not

vses of Honour. Some
be common stuffe, & for meane
seruices: yet profitable. Of the
first sort, I am sure this Tract is
not. Whether of the other or
no; I leaue that to thy iudgemēt.
To deale plainly; my selfe haue
no great opinion of it; as finding
mine owne imperfections and
writing it only vpon a priuat occasion

to a priuat friend, without
curious obseruation of matter
or method. But hauing also
written a greater worke (much of
the same Argument) and intending
to publish, or suppresse it, as
I see cause: I thought it not vnfit
(vpon some encouragement) to
send this forth (like a Pinnesse or
Post of Aduice) to make a discovery
of the Coast, before I aduenture
my greater Ship. If I receiue
good aduertisement, I shal grow
the bolder. Howsoeuer, take this
I pray thee, as it is: and let my
zeale to the cause, excuse mee in
medling with matters beyond
my strength.

vnckle, FR: SA. &c.
            
               MY good Vncle, the
speeches that past
casually betweene
vs at our last parting,
haue runne often since in
my minde; and so (perhaps)
haue they done in yours. You
complained (as God would
haue it) that you were much
crost in the building you were

in hand with, vpon a peece of
gleabe of your Appropriate
Parsonage at Congham. I
answered, that I thought God
was not pleased with it, insomuch
as it tended to the defrauding
of the Church, adding
(amongst some other
words) that I held it vtterly
vnlawfull to keepe Appropriate
Parsonages from
the Church, &c.
            
            But our talke proceeding, I
perceiued that as God had alwaies
his portion in your hart,
so in this, though it concerned
your profit, you seemed tractable.

It much reioyced mee, and
therefore apprehending the occasion,
I will be bold to adde a
continuance to that happy motion:
(so I trust, both you and
I, shall haue cause to terme it)
and besides, to giue you some
tribute of the loue and duty I
long haue ought you. Therefore
(good vncle) as your
heart hath happily conceiued
these blessed sparks, so in the
name and blessing of God, cherish
and enflame them. No
doubt they are kindled from
heauen, like the fire of the Altar,
and are sent vnto you

from God himselfe, to bee a
light to you in your old daies
(when your bodily eies faile
you) to guide your feete into
the way of peace, that is,
the way & place from whence
they came. So alwaies I pray
for you, and rest,
            
               Westmin.

            OF THE
Rights and respect
due vnto the Church.
            
               IN SOmuch
as
the rights
& Duties
that belong
to
our Churches are in effect
contained vnder the name

of a Rectory or Parsonage:
I wil first define, what I conceiue
a Rectory or Parsonage
to be, according to
the vsuall forme and manner
thereof.

his Church there, and for
the maintenance of the Gouernour
or Minister thereof,
to whose charge the same
is committed.
            By this definitiō
                it appears,
that the ordinary liuing or
reuenew of a Parsonage, is
of 3 sorts: the one in Land,
cōmonly called the Glebe:
another in Tithe, which is a
set and regular part of our
goods rendered to God.
the third, in other offrings
and oblations bestowed
vpon God and his Church,

by the people, either in
such arbitrable proportion
as their owne deuotion
moueth them, or as
the lawes or customes of
particular places doe require
them.
            2 Though I inuert order
a little,Tithes how due. I will first
speake of Tithes, because
it is Gods ancient demain,
and the nobler part of
this his inheritance, founded
primar
                  •
               ly, vpon the
Lawe of nature, (as the other
bee also after their
manner.) For the Lawe of

Nature teacheth vs that
God is to bee honoured:
and that the honour due
vnto him, cannot bee
performed without Ministers,
nor the Ministers attende
their function without
maintenance. And
therefore seeing God is the
supreame Lord and possessor
of all,Gen. 14. 19. and giueth
all things vnto vs that we
are maintained with, it is
our duty, both in point of
Iustice and Gratuity, to render
something backe againe
vnto him, as acknowledging

this his supremacie
and bounty; as
honouring him for his
goodnesse; as a testimony of
the worship, loue, and seruice
we owe him; and lastly,
as a meanes whereby
these duties and seruices
may be performed to him.
This, I say, the verie Lawe
of Nature teacheth vs to
doe: and this the Lawe of
GOD requireth also at
our hands: but what the
set portion of our goods
should bee, that thus wee
ought to render backe

vnto God, I cannot say
the Lawe ofYet there bee diuers naturall reasons that commend this number (for this purpose) aboue other. 
               Nature hath
determined that. But the
wisdome of all the Nations
of the World, the
practise of all Ages, the
example of the Patriarches
Gen. 14. 20. ABRAHAM and
Gen. 28. 22. IACOB, theLeuitticus 27. 30. and 32. Deut. 12. 6, & 11. Mallachy 3. 10. approbation
and commandement
of Almighty GOD himselfe,
and the constantDeclared by the Fathers and Counsels. resolution
of his CHVRCH
vniuersally, hath taught
& prescribed vs to render

vnto him the Tenth part:
and that this Tenth part or
Tithe, being thus assigned
vnto him, leaueth now
to be of the nature of the
other nine parts (which
are giuen vs for our worldly
necessities) and becommeth
as a thing dedicate
& appropriate vnto God.
For it is said, Leuit. 27. 30.
All the tythe of the land, both
of the seed of the ground, and of
the fruit of the trees, is the
Lords: yea more then so, It
is holy vnto the Lord. And againe
(verse 32.) Euerie

Tithe of Bullocke, and Sheep,
and of all that goeth vnder
the rodde, the tenth shall bee
holy vnto the Lord. He saith,
holy vnto the Lord; not that
they were like the sanctified
things of the Temple,
which none might touch
but the Annointed Priests)
but Holy and seperate from
the vse and iniurie of secular
persons, and to bee disposed
onely, to and for the
peculiar seruice and peculiar
Seruants of GOD.
And therefore in the 28.
verse, it is said, to be seperate

from the common vse, because
it is separate, and set
apart vnto the Lord.
            
            3 But some happily will
say,Tithes originally not Leuiticall. that this vse of Tithing
rises out of the Leuiticall
Lawe, and so ended with
it.
            I answere, that it was receiued
and practised by Abraham,
and
                  Iacob voweth to giue tithes Gen. 28. 22. And Ioseph sheweth he performeth his vow. Antiquit. lib. 1. cap. 27. 
               Iacob diuers
hundred yeeres before it
came to the Leuites. For it
is said that Abraham gaue
tithe to Melchisedeck, Gen.
14. 20. And that Leuy himselfe
paid tythe also in the

               loines of Abraham, Heb.
7. 9. Melchisedecke was
the image of CHRST, and
his Church; Abraham of
the congregation of the
Faithful. Therfore though
Leuy receiued tithes afterward,
by a particular grant
from GOD, for the time:
yet now hee paide them
generally with the congregation,
in the loines of Abram
vnto the Priesthood
of Christ, heere personated
by Melchisedeck: which being
perpetual, & an image
of this of the Gospell, may

well note vnto vs, that
this dutie of Tythe, ought
also to bee perpetuall. And
therforeHom. 35. in Gen. 
               Chrysostome saith:
that Abraham heerein was
OVR tutor: not the tutor
of the Iewes. And in somuch
as Abraham paid it
not to a Priest that offered
a Leuiticall Sacrifice of Bullocks
and Goates: but to
him that gaue the Elements
of the Sacrament of
the Gospell,The Scripture onely mentioneth Bread and wine to be giuen by Melchisedeck to Abraham: But Iosephus sheweth, that hee gaue him also diuers other rich gifts. Antiquit. lib. 1. cap. 18. 
               bread and

               wine: it may also well intimate
vnto vs, to what
kinde of Priest we are to
pay our tithes: namely,
to him that ministreth vnto
vs the Sacrament of
bread and wine, which are
onely those of the Gospell,
and not the Leuiricall
Priests. So that our tythe
paide in this kinde, cannot
bee said Leuiticall: as also
for that the Leuitical tythes,
were onely of thingsLeuit. 37. 30, & 3
                     •
                  . renewing
and increasing:
whereas Abraham and Iacob
paid them of all: as if

they had followed the cō
               mandement
of the Apostle;
Let him that is taught in the
Word, make him that hath
taught him part taker of

Gal▪
                6. 6.
            God also requireth this
dutie of tythe by his owne
mouth, as of olde belonging
vnto him, before the
Leuites were called to the
seruice of the Tabernacle:
and before they were
named in Scripture. For
they are not named till
Exodus. 38. 21. And it is
said in Exodus 22. 29. Thine

bundance of thy liquor shalt
thou not keepe backe: meaning
Tithes and first fruits,
and therfore Ierome doubteth
not so to translate
it; Thy Tithes and first
Fruits shalt thou not keepe
backe. And in this manner
of speech, the word
Keepe backe, sheweth that
it was a thing formerlie
due vnto GOD: for
wee cannot say, that any
thing is kept backe, or
with-holden that was not
due before. Therefore wee
finde no originall commondement

of giuing tithe vnto
GOD: but vpon the
first mentioning of them
in Leuiticus, they are positiuely
declared to bee His,
as a part of His Crowne,
and ancient demaine; for it
is there said, Cap. 27. 30.
All the tithe of the Land is
the Lords. And Moses commandeth
not the people a
new thing: but declareth
the Right that of olde belonged
to GOD: namely,
that All the tithes of the land
was his.
            
            Other phrases of Scripture

doe confirme this; for
afterward when tithes
came to be assigned to the
Leuites: God doth not say,
The children of Israel shal giue
their tithes to the Leuites▪
               
but he saith, Behold I haue
giuen them to the Leuites.
               Num. 18. 21, 24, & 26.
And continuing this his
claime vnto them, against
those that many hundred
yeeres after disseised him
of them: hee complaineth,
Malachy. 3. 8. That
they that withheld their tyths
from the Leuites, spoiled him
himselfe.
            
            
               
But hauing handled this
argument more largely in
a greater worke: I will
heare close it vp with opposing
against these kindes
of Aduersaries, not onely
the reuerend authority of
of those ancient and most
honourable Pillars of the

vnderVrban. Epist. circiter Anno. Christi 227. this name accounted
all things, that were giuē
or dedicated to the seruice
of God. And in the first
ages of Christiā
                religiō (after
the great persecutions)
the Church by this meanes
began so to abound in riches,

that the good Emperours

                  Constantine & Valentinian made lawes that rich men which were able to support the charges of the Common-wealth: should not be admitted into religious houses▪ because their poss

                  ssions and goods were thereby a mortized. themselues, were
constrained to make laws
(not vnlike our statutes
of Mortemaine) to restrain
the excesse thereof: for
feare of impouerishing
their temporall estate In
those daies, many Churches
had Treasuries for keeping
these oblations (as
the Storehouses at Hierusalem,
appointed by2 Chron. 31. 11. 
               Hezechias,
for the Temple) but
the succeeding Ages, contracted
them into Chests:
and in these later times,

the Parsons pocket may
well enough containe
them. I shall not neede.
therefore, to spend many
words in a small matter:
for all the Oblations now
in vse, are in effect the two-peny
Easter Offrings, and
a fewe other such like:
which because the owners
of Appropriate Parsonages
shall not ignorantly conuert
vnto their owne benefit:
I will shewe them
why they were paied, and
why they haue them.
            Saint Paul ordained in

the churches of Galatia &
Corinth, that euery one vpō
the Lords day should yeeld
somewhat to God for the
Saints. 1, Cor. 16.

                  •
                But this (being once a
weeek) came too thick &
too often about. Therfore
inTertullian in Apologetico. 
               Tertullians time the
vse was to doe it monthly,
and (at last) at pleasure.
But it was euer the ancient
vse of the Primitiue
Church (as appeareth by
Iustinius in Apol. 2. Hist. Ecles. 
               Justin & Cyprian) that al
                     •
                  
               
that come to the holy Communion,
did according to

their abilities, offer something
of their substance to
God, for charitable vses
and maintenance of the
Ministers. ThereforeSermone 1, de Eleemosymis. 
               Cyprian
sharply taxeth a rich
Matron, that receiued the
Communion, and offered
nothing. Locuples & diues

(saith hee) art thou able
and rich? and dost thou
thinke that thou celebratest
the Lords Supper, which bringest
nothing to the Treasurie?
               
So (Irenaeus saith)Noui Testamenti nouam docuit (filz. Christ
                     •
                  us) oblationem: quam Ecclesia ab Apostolis accipiens in vniuerso mundo offert Deo: ei qui alimenta nobis prestat. primitias suorum muncrum in nouo testamento. 
               That
it was the vse of the Church
through the world in his time,
and receiued from the Apostles;
to offer something of the

the first fruits thereof, to him

of offrings at the Communion:
giuen to holy vses, and
for reliefe of the poore of the
Church: commending it
for an excellent custome,
and complaining that it is

now discontinued. But to
this end, and in imitation
hereof, are our Easter and
Communion offrings (as
also those, at, & for Christnings,
Burials, &c. which
I will not now speake further
of) at this day made,
and therefore let Proprietaries
consider with what

               Of Glebe Land, and houses belonging to Parsonages
               glebe, and howses, belonging
to Parsonages (which I
would haue called Gods
fixt inheritance, but that I

see it is moueable:) I cannot
say that they are
Gods ancient demaines, in
the same forme that tithes
are, and as our Clergie
enioieth them, but the warrant
and ground thereof,
riseth out of the word of
God, who not onely gaue
vs a president thereof, whē
hee appointed Cities for
the Leuites to dwel in, with
a conuenient circuit of
fields for the maintenance
of their Cattell, Num. 35.
2, &c. but commanded also
the Children of Israel
               
(and in them all the Nations
of the world:) that in
diuision of their land, they
should offer an oblation
to the Lord, an holy portion
of the Land for the
Priest to dwell on, and to
build the house of GOD
vpon: Ezeck 45. 1, & 4. So
that the houses and lands
that our Ancestors haue
dedicated to God in this
manner, for the Churches
and Ministers of this time:
are now also his right
and iust inheritance, as
well as those which the

               Israelites assigned for the
house of God, and Leuites of
that time▪ and commeth
vpon the same reason and
in lieu thereof. But because
it is vncertain when and
how they were brought
into the Church, I will say
something touching that
point.
            In the time of the Apostles
the vse was (as appeareth
Acts 2. 45. & Acts 4.
34, & 35.) to sell their
lands,How lands came to the Churches. and bring the money
only, to the Apostles.
For the Church being then

in persecution, and the Apostles
not to remaine in
any particular place, but
to wander all ouer the
world, for preaching the
Gospell: they could not
possesse immoueable inheritances:
and therefore
receiued onely the money
they were sold for, distributing
it as occasion serued.
But after when the
church obtained a little rest,
& began to be settled:It appeareth by the Epistles of Pius and Vrban who liued about the yeere of Christ 230. that the Church of Rome had then begū to retain lands in this māner vpō this reason, & it may well be, for that Origen & Eusebius shew, that Churches had then possessions. it

found much casualty in
pecuniary contributions,
and chused therefore rather
to retaine the Lands
themselues, giuen for the
maintenance of Gods
Priests and Ministers: then
(by suffering the same to
be sold) to furnish the time
present with abundance,
and leaue the future time
to hazard and vncertainety.

               Vrban) as after: began to
accept & retaine the lands
thus giuen, and to leaue
them ouer to their successors
for a perpetual Dowry
of the Church. And this
vpon experiēce was found
to be so godly and worthy
a course, that it not onely
receiued the applause of
all succeeding ages: But
commendeth for euer vnto
vs their temperance, in
desiring no more then for

in prouiding for posterity,

that the Church for

               hall. Vpon this ensued
many godly prouisiōs for

endowment of Churches,
and for annexing their liuings
so vnto them, as neither
the variety of time, nor
the impiety of man (if it
were possible) should euer
haue diuorced them; as

Therefore whilest
the world burned so with
that sacred fire of deuotion,
towards the aduancement
of the glory of God:
that euery man desired to
sanctifie his hand, in the
building of Churches, lest
such holy monuments for
want of due maintenance,
should (in proces of time)
becom, either contēptible,
or vnprofitable. It was at
length ordained, inSi quis in agro suo, aut habet, aut postulat habore dioecefim primum & terras ei deputet sufficienter, & clericos: qui ibidem sua officia impleant, vt sacratis locis reuerentia condigna tribuatur.

By vertue of these Councels
(as I take it) were the Founders
of Churches in France
first compelled to assure
Liuings to those Churches.
And it was also prouided
by the third Councel of
Concil. Tolet. 3. cap. 15. 
               Tolledo in Spaine, that no
Bishop might consecrate

Lawes of our Church began

then first (as farre as I
yet can finde) to constrain
our Country-men to giue
Endowments to the Churches
that they builded; yet
we were taught before (by
the Custome and Example
of our precedent Auncestors,
as well, as by our dutie,
out of the word of God,
to do the same▪ as appeareth
by many Presidents,

Kings haue also
abounded: so haue they

fromAs appeareth in their seuerall lawes, and namely 15 times in Edw. 3. raigne. time to time, as well
by Parliament Lawes, as

Therefore if these things
had not bin primarily due
vnto God by the rule of his
word, yet are they now
His, and seperate from vs,
by the voluntary gift and
dedication of our ancient
Kings and Predecessours:

as was theNelis. 10. 32.

third part of a shekell,
which Nehemiah and the
Iews, out of their free bountie,
couenanted yeerely to

of his house. For, as Saint
Peter
               Acts. 5. 4. saith to Ananias:
Whilest these things remained,
they appertained vnto vs,
and were in our owne power▪

not onely vowed them, but
deliuered them ouer into

imployments, not
onely ratified the vow and

also the Church it self:

works of charity, and
some Ceremony, for sanctifying
the same to diuine

to be so notorious and generall

and to haue such vniuersal
approbation; as it could
not, but haue a roote also
from elder ages, though
there cannot be many presidents
found thereof, for
that the Christians being
then in persecution, might
hardly build, or dedicate
any Churches, but were
constrained to vse priuat
houses, and solitary places
for their assemblies.
Yet, euen those houses,
hadde (as it seemeth)
some consecration, for they
were most commonly called

(to this day) amongst vs,
for our Churches, as a testimony
of their sanctification,
whereof I shal speake
more anon.Ibideus. *Eusebius also
saith: that insomuch as the
Holy houses and Temples of
that time, were thus Dedicated
and Consecrated vnto
God, the vniuersall Lord of
all: therefore they receiued his
name, & were called in Greek
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , (in Lattin, Dominica)
the Lords houses: Which
name, saith he, was not imporsed.

vpon them by man: but by
himselfe onely, that is Lord of
all. Of this word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , commeth
the Saxon word Cyric
or Kyrk: and (by adding
a double aspiration to it)
our vsuall word Chyrch or
Church, as it were to put vs
euer in mind, whose these
Houses are: namely, the
Lords houses: like that,
which IACOB dedicating
vnto GOD, called (Bethel:)
that is,Gen. 28. 22. 
               the house of
God.
            
            But both Church and
Church-liuings were thus

solemnely deliuered into
Gods possession; and therefore
all ages, Councels
and Fathers (that euer I
yet haue met with) account
them holy and inuiolable
things. And hereupon
they are termed,Chrys. hom. 18. in Act. Concil. Mogunt. ca. 7. 
               Patrimonium
Christi, Dos Ecclesiae,
Dos sponsae Christi, and
Sacrata possessio, or Praedium
sanctum. For, Euery thing
that a man doth separate vnto
the Lord from the common
vse, whether it be man, or
beast, or Land of his Inheritance,
it is Holy to

the Lord: Leuit. 27. 28. And
in what sort I vnderstand
the word Holy, I haue before
declared.
            7 As then the Law of
Nature,
               Holy rights and Temples how respected by Heathens. primarily taught
all Nations in the world to
giue these things vnto God▪
so the very same Law, also
taught them that it was sacriledge
and impiety to
pull them backe againe:
yea, the very heathē, counted
the things thus seuered
vnto their gods: to be Sancta
& inuiolanda. And Saint
Augustine expoundeth, Sanctum

illud esse, quod violare
nefas est. It is execrable
wickednes, to violate that
that is holy.Gen. 47. 22. 
               Pharo would
not abridge the Priests of
thei
                  •
                diet, or land: no not
in the great famin. The very
Barbarous Nations of
the world, euen by the instinct
of nature, abhorred
this impietie Diodorus Siculus
noteth of the Gaules,
               Biblioth. hist. lib. 5.
that though they were a
people, aboue all others
most couetous of gold:
yet hauing aboundance
thereof, scattered in all

parts of their Temples,
to the honour of their
gods: none was found so
wicked amongst them, as
to meddle with any of it.
I could alledge a multitude
of Heathen stories
to this purpose. But I
will not weaue the wollen
yearne of the Gentiles,
into the fine linnen garments
of the Christians; I
meane, I will not mingle
profane arguments, in a
discourse of Christian piety
For the sheep that are of
the fold of Christ, are tied

onely to heare his voice,
and to follow that,Iohn 10. 3. which
if they doe not, they are
thereby knowne to bee
Goats, and not of his fold.
            8 The cause why I touched
vppon this one heathen
Example,How fearefull a thing it is to violate the Church. is to aggrauate
the manifold sins of
vs Christians, in this point.
For if they that knew not
God, were so zealous of
the glory of their Idols:
how much more is it to
our condemnation, if wee
that know him, doe lesse regard
him? If it goe hard

with Tyrus and Sydon in the
day of iudgement that sinned
ignorantly; how much
harder will it bee with
Corasin and Bethsaida that
sin presumptuously: Especially
with Capernaum that
despiseth her Lord God
and Master, Iesus Christ him.
selfe? What is to despise
him; if to robbe him of his
honor, be not despise him?
Or what is to rob him of
honour, if to take from him
the things giuen him for
maintenance thereof, bee
not to rob him? Therefore

when the children of Israel
withheld their tithes & offerings
from the Leuites, hee
crieth out in Malachy 3. 8.
That himselfe was robbed and
spoiled: and was so highly
offended therewith, that
hee cursed the whole Nation
for it. And to make
this sin appeare the more
monstrous, he conuinceth
the offenders therein: not
onely to bee violaters of
his Legall ordinances, but
euen of the very lawe of
Nature, written in the heart
of euery man. For, saith he,

               Will any man spoile his gods?
As if hee should say: Can
such a man bee found as
will, or dares commit that
sinne, that all the Nations
of the world, euen by the
instinct of nature, account
to bee so horrible and impious?
To spoile his gods:
what his owne gods? Some
were found, that now and
then aduentured to spoile
the gods of other Nations
(yet not without punishment)
but fewe or
none that I reade of (till
these latter daies) that

spoiled their owne gods,
in apparent and ouert manner,
as the Lawyers terme
it. I count it not ouert and
apparant, when we doe as
Ananias and Saphira did:
pinch & detract from God,
somewhat of that we vowed
to giue: Nor, when we
doe as the children of Israel
heere did; withhold
that which wee ought to
pay out of our own goods
(yet both these were heinous
sinners, and dreadfully
punished.) But I call
it ouert & apparant, when

we throw our selues into a
more dangerous sinne, by
inuading openly the deuotions
of other men, and taking
that from God and
from his Church,2. Chron. 24. vers. 7. (as Athalia
did) which wee neuer
gaue vnto it, euen the lands
and liuings thereof: yea,
the Churches themselues.
            8 Doubtlesse we haue
much to feare in this point:
                  Dauids zeal for the house of God.
For as it is a transcendent
sinne; so Dauid labouring
to match it with a transcendent
punishment, bestoweth
a whole Psalme, (viz.
               
theThis Psalme is alledged to this purpose by Lucius (who was martyred about An. Chr. 255.) in his epistle to the Bishops of Gallia and Spaine. Tom. Concil. 1. 83.) in inueying particularly
against these kind
of sinners▪ such (expresly)
as would take to themselues
the houses of God in possession;
for that onely is the very
center of the Psalme, and
therein do all the lines and
proiections of the Prophets
inuectiues, incurre.
First hee maketh a flat opposition
between God and
them: and therefore calleth
them his enemies. Then he
describeth the nature of
these kinde of enemies:
namely, that they are murmuring
               
enemies, as grudging,
and enuying at the
prosperity of the Church:
Malicious enemies: as hating,
or hurting the seruice
of God. Proud enemies, as
lifting vp their heads against
God: ver. 2. Craftie enemies;
as imagining how to beguile
the Church. Conspiring
enemies; as taking
Counsell together against
Gods secret ones (as the Prophet
calleth them) that is,
Gods seruants & Ministers:
ver. 3. And lastly, Confederate
enemies: as cōbining them

selues one by example of
another, to perseuere in
their course of wronging
and violating the Church:
vers. 5. Yet for all this,
those against whom the
Prophet thus enueigheth,
did not that they desired▪
They discouered their malitious
purpose by word of
mouth, saying: Let vs take
to our selues the houses of God
in possession. But they onely
said it, they did it not. Their
will was good, but their
power failed. Our will and
power haue both preuailed:

for wee haue got the
houses of God into our possession:
His Churches, his
lands, his offerings, his holy
rights. We haue gotten
them, and led them away
captiue, bound in cheines
of yron: that is, so conueied
and assured vnto vs, by
Deed, by Fine, by Act of
Parliament, as if they neuer
should returne again vnto
the Church. But heare what
Dauid saith to those of his
time. Mark how he praieth
for them. Marke what
strange and exquisite punishments

he designeth to
them: and that in as many
seuerall all sorts, as there are
seuerall branches in this
kind of sinne.
            First, hee praieth, that
God would deale with
them, as hee did with the
Madianites: vers. 9. That is,
that as Geaeon by Trumpets
and Lampes, strooke
such a terrour in the night
time, into the hearts of the
Madianites, that the whole
army fell into confusion,
drew their swords one vpon
another, were discomfited

and 120 thousand of
them slaine. So that God
by his trumpets, the Preachers
of his word, by his
Lamps, which is, the light
of the Gospell, would confound
in like manner, the
enemies and spoilers of
his Church, that sleepe
in the night of their sinne:
And that hee would make
them like Oreb, and Zeb,
like Zeba and Salmana:
verse 11. All which were
strangely ouerthrowne,
died violent deaths, and
beeing glorious Princes

of their nations, became
like the filthy & lothsome
Dung of the earth: vers. 10.
And Iudges 
                     •
                  . 25. and 8. 21.
            But doth the Prophet

he, make them like a wheele.

and vnstable in their actions:
so as they may neuer
bring their purposes to an
end. Yea, make them abiect
and contemptible; like
the chaffe that the wind scattereth
from the face of the
earth: vers. 13. Well, is hee

now satisfied? no. All this
doth but whet his spirits to
sharper imprecations. He
now desireth that the very
floudgates of Gods wrath
may be broken open vpon
them; and that the tempest
of his indignation may
rage at full against them:
now he crieth out to God
to consume them without
mercy, yea and that in two
terrible manners. One naturally,
As the fire burneth
vp the wood. The other miraculously,
As the flame
censumeth the mountaines:

vers. 14. Persecute them euen
so, (saith hee) with thy tempest,
and make them afraid
with thy storme. Make their
faces ashamed, O Lord, that
they may seeke thy name. Let
them be confounded and vexed
euer more and more, let
them bee put to shame and perish:

should the wit of man discouer
and prosecute a sin
in more vehement and horrible
manner? Or, what
shall make vs to abstaine
from such haughty sinnes?
if all this preuaile not.

Well, if to take the houses
of God into possession, bee
thus? take them that will
for mee.
            9 You see how Dauid in
this his sacred fury,The zeale of our Sauiour to the house of God. was
admirably caried against
this sinne. Well therefore
might hee say:And of the parts of the Temple. 
               The zeale
of thine house hath eaten me
vp: Psal. 69. 9. Yet, he spake
it not of himselfe alone:
but in the person also of
our Sauiour Iesus Christ;
who in prosecution of
Dauids zeale, did that in
this case; that hee neuer

did at any time else in all
his life. In all other cases
he shewed himselfe like the
Pascall Lambe, that euery
body did eat and deuour
                  •
               
at pleasure; and like the
sheep that was dumbe before
the shearer, euen when
his very life was taken
from him. But when he saw
the golden fleece to be taken
from the house of God:
that is, when hee saw the
Church his beloued spouse,
depriued and spoiled of
the honour, reuerence, dutie
and ornament, that belonged

to her: Then, as
Dauid did, he groweth into
a sacred fury; hee leaueth
the mildnesse of the Pascall
Lambe, and taketh vppon
him the fiercenesse of the
Lion of Iuda. Then he beginneth
to bestir him, and
to lay about him. He whippeth
out them that prophaned
it; driueth out their
sheep & their oxen, though
they were for the sacrifice:
and ouerthroweth the table
of the mony changers:Mat. 21. 12
               Iohn 2. 14.Mar. 11. 17. He would by no
meanes indure such trumtrumperyLuke. 19. 45.
               
to bee in his Fathers
house, nor his Fathers
house to made an house of
Merchandise: but, much
lesse then, that merchandise
should be made of his
Fathers house it selfe. O
fearefull and most inhumane
sinne, horresco referrens.
            
            But ere I depart from
this place of Scripture; let
me note one thing more
out of it, for the greater reuerence
of Churches: that
although our Lord bee
heer said, to haue cast these

things out of the Temple;
yet, in truth, they were not
in the Temple it selfe, but
in the outward court or
yard thereof. For within
the inward parts of the
Temple, (namely, the
first, and second Tabernacles)
did no man enter,
but the Leuite Priests:
               Num. 18. 5. and
of them also,Ebr. 9. 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. none into the
second Tabernacle, but the
High Priest. Therefore,
although our Sauiour
Christ, were a Priest for
euer after the order of Melchisedeck:
yet because hee

was not a Priest of Leuy: but
of the Tribe of Juda (of
which Tribe Moses spake
nothing touching the Priesthood:
Heb. 7. 14.) I take it,
thatChrist came to fulfill the Law, & not to break it. Therefore (doubtles) he obserued the rules thereof, and the quality of his Tribe. he neuer came within
these parts of the Temple:
nor where the sacrifice was,
but frequēted onlySee the forme of the Temple in Arias Montaiu: Antiquitat. Iudaic. lib. Aricl. and in the Geneua Bible, 1.

heare the word of God expounded,
not pressing further
towards the Temple:
and in the middest whereof
(the2. Chron. 6. 13. brasen stage which
Salomon praied vpon) was
erected. Yet, this very
place, this court, or outward
yard, would not our
Sauiour permit to be prophaned;
neither with market
matters, nor with carrying
so much as a burthen

or vessell through it: Mark.
11. 16: For though it were
not so Leuetically holy, as
the Temple: yet it was dedicated
to God, with the
Temple: And taken often
in the new Testament, for
the Temple: as in the places
before alledged: And
Acts 3. 2, 3. By which reason
the very Church-yards
themselues (being Dedicated
with the Churches,
and the principall soile
thereof:Stat. Ne Rectores prosternant arbores in Cimiterio. as an old Statute
witnesseth) seeme also to
haue in them a certaine

kind of Sanctification: and
are not therefore to bee
abused to secular and base
imployments: as not onely
the Ancient Fathers, by
the Canons of the Church:
but the present Lawes of
the Land, haue well prouided
for them.
            10 But some will say,
that the sanctification of
the Temple was Leuiticall,
               More of that matter: and how farre the sanctification of the Temple is abo.
and therefore abolished,
and not to bee applied to
our Churches. I answere,

vnto three functions; which
also had three seuerall places
assigned to them. The
first, belonged to the Diuine
presence; & had the custody
of y• 
               Holiest types thereof; the
Oracle, the Arke, the Mercy-seat,
&c. and was therefore
called Sanctum Sanctorum,
or the Holiest of all. The second,
was for ceremoniall
worship & attonement: namely,
by sacrifice, oblations,
and other Leuiticall rites:
the place thereof being the
the Sanctuary, (wherein
were the Holy vessels) and

the Court of Priests, wherein
the Altar of burnt sacrifice
did stand. The third,
was for simple worshippe,
praier, and doctrine (without
any pompe or ceremony:)
and the place of
this, was the outward Court,
(called,1. Chr. 4. 9. & 6. 12. 
               Atrium populi, and
Acts 31. 1. 
               Salomons porich;) which
therefore had in it no Ceremoniall
implement at
all.
            The two first of these
functions, with the places
belonging to them; were
indeed particularly appropriate

to the Law. For, they
were Ceremoniall, Mysticall,
Secret, Leuiticall, Iudaicall,
and Temporall-Ceremoniall,
as celebrated with much
worldly pompe. Mysticall,
as figurating some spirituall
things. Secret; as either
performed behinde the
Veile or Curtaine: or else
sequestred & romote from
the people. Leuiticall; as
committed only to the administration;
of that Tribe▪
Iudaicall; as ordained onely
for the saluation of that
people. And Temporall; as

instituted onely for a season,
and not to continue.
But the Sanctification, of the
third function, and of the
place thereto appointed,
was directly contrary in al
the points alledged to the
former two. First (as I said
before) it was for simple
worship, Praier, and Doctrine
which were there to
be performed and deliuered
in all sinceritie, without
any ceremony or ceremoniall
implement vsed therein.
Secondly, there was no matter
of mystery therein to be

seene▪ but whatsoeuer was
mysticall in the Law, or the
Prophets, was there expounded.
Thirdly, nothing
there, was hidden or secret
from the people, but acted
wholly without the Veile,
and publikely for euery
man. Fourthly, it was not
appropriate to the Leuites,
but common alike to all
the Tribes. Fifthly, not ordained
for the Iewes particularly,
but for all Nations
in generall. And lastly,
not to endure for a time,
(as those other two of the

Law) but to continue for
euer: euen after the Gentiles
were called as well as
the Iewes: that is, during the
time of the Gospell, as well
as the Law. Therefore,
saith God, by Isaias the
Prophet, cap. 56. 7. My house
shall bee called an house of
Praier, to all Nations. Hee
said not, an House of Sacrifice
to all Nations: for the
Sacrifice ended, before the
calling of the Gentiles, and
so they could haue no part
thereof. Nor an House of
praier for the Jewes onely,

for then had the Gentiles
(when they were called)
been likewise excluded.
But an House of praier to all
Nations, that is, Iewes and
Gentiles indifferētly: which
therefore, must haue relation
to the times of the Gospel.
And consequently, the
sanctification of that house,
and of that function, is also
a sanctification of the Churches
of the Gospel.
            We read not therefore,
that Christ reformed any
thing in the other two functions
of the Temple; for

they were now, as at an
end. But because this third
function was for euer to
continue to his Church:
therefore hee purgeth it of
that that prophaned it; restoreth
it (as hee did mariage)
to the originall sanctitie:
And that the future
world (which was the time
of the Gospell) might better
obserue it, then the precedent,
and time of the
Law had done; hee reporteth,
and confirmeth the
decree, whereby it was sanctified:
It is written, saith

he, (as producing the record
and wordes of the
foundation) My house shall
bee called an house of praier to
all people. Hee saith, My
House, as excluding all other,
from hauing any property
therein; for, God will
bee Ioynt-tenant with no
man. And it shall bee,
An house of praier for all people:
that is, publike foreuer;
not priuate, nor appropriate
to any▪ nor a denne of
theeues; that is, no place of
Merchandise, or secular
businesse, as Saint I
                     •
                  rome
               
expoundeth it. It must not
be an Impropriation; no
man can, or may hold it in
that kind.
            The time also when our
Sauiour pronounced these
words is much to the purpose
as it seemeth to mee.
For it was after he had turned
out the oxen & doues;
that is, the things for the
Sacrifice. As though, hee
thereby taught vs, that
when the Sacrificall function
of the Temple was ended:
yet the sanctification
thereof, to bee an house

of prayer, for euer remained.
            11 This doctrine of our
Sauiour,Saint Paul maintaineth the reuerence of the Church. is continued vnto
vs by Saint Paul: who, seeing
the Corinthians to profane
the Church with eating
and drinking in it▪
though much good might
follow thereby, (being orderly
done) as the encreasing
of amity, and the reliefe
of the poore; yet because
it was against the reuerence
of the place: hee
not onely reproueth them
for it, demanding if they

had not houses to eat and
drinke in at home, but skaring
them also (by shewing
the daunger they were falling
into) hee speaketh to
them as with admiration:
Despise ye the Church of God?
               1 Cor. 11. 12.
As if hee should say, is
your religion now come
vnto that? or is that your
Religion, To despise the place
that God hath sanctified vnto
himselfe; by making it,
as Saint Ierome saith, Triclineum
epularum,
               Coment. in 1. Cor. 11. a banqueting
house. God wondered
in Malachy, that

any should spoile their gods.
And the holy Ghost heere
wondereth, that any should
despise the materiall Church:
for so Saint Ierome expoundeth
it. Thus both of them
wonder at one & the same
thing: that any man should
be so irreligious, as to profane
the reuerence due vnto
God, and that that is
his.
            12 So precise therefore
were the Ancient Fathers
in this point,The zeale of some of the Fathers to the Church. Serm. de temp. tom. 10. 21
                        •
                     
                  
                that, that
meeke Saint of God, Saint
Augustine, would by no

meanes endure that any
should vse clamors, or dā
               cing
within the vi
                  ••
                of the
Church. Yea, hee termeth
them, Miserable and wretched
men that did it And denounceth
against them,
that If such came Christians
to the Church, they went Pagans
home. But when the
Church it selfe came to be
abused! Oh, how Saint
Ambrose taketh it, euen against
the Emperour himselfe,
great Valentinian that
required it for an Arian: O
(saith hee) let him aske that

is mine,
               Ad Marcellinam sororem: Epist. 33. 
               my lands, my goods,
and whatsoeuer I possesse, I
will not deny them; yet are
they not mine, but belong to
the poore. Verum ea quae diuina
sunt, &c. saith hee, but
those things that are Gods,
are not subiect to the authoritie
of the Emperour. If my
lands (I say) be desired, enter
them a Gods name; if my body,
I will carry it him; if hee will
haue mee to prison, yea, vnto
death, it pleaseth mee well, I
will not defend my selfe with
multitude of people, neither
will I flie to the Altar, desiring

my life, but with all my
heart will die for the Altars.
And after, in speaking of
the impious Souldiers:In fine eiusdem Epist. 
               O
that God (saith hee) would
turne their hands from violating
the Church, and then
let them turne all their weapons
vpon mee, and take their
fill of my bloud. And many
such excellent speeches he
hath for the sanctity of the
Church, and of the reuerēce
due vnto it, in his Oration,
De Basilicis tradendis.
            
            My purpose is to bee
short; I will not therefore

now enter any further into
the authorities of the Fathers:
or meddle with the
Councels and ancient Canons
of the Church which
abound so in this kind of
zeale, and haue established
it (against the Eustathians,
M
                     •
                  ssalians, and Fraticelli,
               Heretikes which contemned Churches. heretikes: and all other
the enemies thereof) with
so many examples, admonitions,
exhortations, precepts,
threatnings, curses,
and excommunications:
as it requireth a booke alone
to repeat them.
            
               
13 It seemeth a small
thing to daunce in the
Church-yard,Sacriledge not to be suffered in the least things. or to eate
and drinke in the Church.
But sanctification (saith Ierome
speaking on this matter)
consisteth also euen in the
small things.
               Coment. in 2. Cor. 11. 22. tom. 9. Therefore Ecclesiasticus
aduiseth vs,Eccles. 25. 27. that
we giue not the water passage,
no not in a little. For he that
oponeth the waters but a
little, knoweth not how
great a breach they will
make at length. So is it to
make an entrance into sin,
or to breake the reuerence

of holy things in trifles.
            Therefore God punished
seuerely the petty offenders
in this kind: not
Corah onely and his company,
that inuaded the
high function of the Priesthood:
but euen him that
gathered the stickes on the
Sabath day: Numb. 15. 34.
And poore Vzzah himselfe
(whom Dauid so much
lamented) that did, as it
were, but stay the Arke from
shaking, (2. Sam. 6. 6. and
1. Chron. 13. 9.) and yet died
for it, because his hand was

not sanctified to that purpose.
            14 I conclude this point
with the saying of Salomon,
               An admonition to them that meddle with holy things.
               Pro. 20. 25. (and let al men
consider it:) It is a snare for
a man to deuoure that which
is sanctified, and after the
Vowes, to enquire. A Snare
hath three properties. First,
to catch suddenly. Secondly,
to hold surely. Thirdly,
to destroy certainly. So
was Vzza taken ere hee
was aware: hee did but
touch the Arke, and presently
hee was catcht.

King Vzziah did but meddle
with the incense, and
presently the Leprosie was
on his face: 2. Chron. 26. 19.
Jeroboam did but stretch
out his hand against the
Prophet, and presently it
withered: 1. King. 13. 4. And
as a man falleth suddenly
into it: so is it as hard to get
out. Vzza died in it presently.
Vzziah languished
in it all his life, and then died
in it also, Corah, Dathan,
and Abiram, were no sooner
caught in this snare, but
it held them so surely, as

when all Israel else fled and
escaped; they, & their companions
(most miserable
men) were detained in it,
to their notorious destruction.
            I might heere take iust
occasion to remember
what hath happened to
many in this Kingdom, that
became vnfortunate after
they medled with Churches,
and Church-liuings.
But I will run into no particularities.
Let those men,
and those families, which
are vnfortunate (as wee

terme them) consider, whether
themselues, their Fathers,
or some of their Ancestors,
haue not been fettered
in this snare.
            And let the Proprietaries
of Parsonages also well
consider these things. For,
if Vzza died, that did but
touch the Arke to saue it:
what shal become of them
that stretch out their hands
against Churches to destroy
them? If the stickegatherer
was stoned, for so
small a prophanation of
the Sabbath; what shall

they looke for, that by destroying
the Churches, destroy
also the Sabbath it
selfe, (in a manner) as taking
away the place appointed
to the publike
sanctification thereof. And
if Corah, Dathan and Abiram,
offended so hainously,
in medling with the
things of the Leuiticall
Priesthood, though they
imployed them to the seruice
of God: what haue
they to feare, that vsurpe
the things of the Gospel, &
peruert thē wholly to their

owne vse, from the seruice
of God? Yea, that pollute
his Churches and houses
of prayer to seruile & base
offices: leauing the Parishioners
vncertenly prouided
of diuine seruice, to the destructiō
both of the Priesthood
it selfe, and of the seruice
of God in generall.
            15 But they will comfort
themselues with this:A surmise answered.
that though the Churches
bee sanctified to some purpose,
yet the sanctity thereof
differeth from Leuiticall
sanctification: and that God

doth not now kil any from
heauen, for prophaning
the things of the Gospel,
as he did then, for prophaning
the things of the law▪
I answer: The sanctity in
deed of the one, differeth
from the sanctity of the
other. For the Leuiticall
things were sanctified by
the hand of man, to be matter
of Ceremony; but the
churches of the Gospel,
are sanctified by our Sauiour
himselfe, to be houses
of prayer. Not that prayer
is to be vsed onely in these

places but that these places
are onely to be vsed for
prayer. And wee must not
presume that God sleepeth
because hee punisheth not
(now as he did of old) the
cōtemners of his worship▪
For as the law consisted in
visible & temporal things,
so the punishments therin,
were for the most part visible
and temporal. But the
Gospel concerneth things
inuisible and eternall, and
therefore the punishments
assigned therein, are for the
most part, inuisible & eternall.
            
               
16 They haue also another
comfort,Another surmise answered. and that is,
that though these things
were once Spirituall, now
they are made temporall
by the Lawes of Dissolution;
and especially, by the
Stat. of 32. H. 8. cap. 7. It is
true that those Statutes apply
diuers Law-termes vnto
these things that properly
belong to temporall
inheritances: and that the
Statute of 32. H. 8. hath
made them demandable by
originall Writs, & hath giuen
certain real actions, &

other courses for recouering
& conueying of them
in Temporall Courts: because
Lay-men could not
in former times haue sued
for things of this nature in
any Court of the Kingdom.
But this prooueth not the
things themselues to bee
therefore temporall,Dissero non assero. (no
more then that an English
man is a Frenchman, because
he saileth in a French
bottome.) For vpon the
same reason; the Statute giueth
also other actions (for
recouering of tithes and

               offerings withholden, &c.)
in the Courts spiritual. They
then that out of the one
part of the Statute wil haue
them temporall, are by the
other part in forced to confesse
them still Spirituall,
and so to make them like
a Centaure: prolem biformem.
It were very hard (in
my vnderstanding) to
ground a point of so great
consequence, vpon subtiltie
of words, and ambiguous
implications, without
any expresse letter of Law
to that purpose, especially,

to make the Houses and
offerings of God, temporall
Inheritances. But I see it
is a Law question in my
LordTerm. Pas. An. 7. Edw. 6. Assise fol. 83. b. 
               Dier, whether tithes
be made Lay or Temporal
by any words in those Statutes.
And therefore I must
leaue this point to my Masters
of the Law, who haue
the key of this knowledge
onely in their owne custody.
Yet I thinke I may bee
so bold, as to say thus
much out of their owne
Doct. & Stud. cap. 6. bookes, that a Statute, directly
against the Law of

God, is void. If then Tithes
be things spirituall, and due
de iure diuino, as many great

Before I speake to this
point, I take it by protestation,
that I haue no heart
to make an Apology for
it. For I wish that euery
man might drinke the water
of his owne well, eate
the milke of his own flock,
and liue by the fruit of his
owne vineyard. I meane,

that euery member might
attract no other nutriment,
but that which is
proper to it selfe. Yet are
they greatly deceiued, that
draw any iuce of encouragement
from these examples.
For all these are either
the Seminaries of the
Church, or the Husbandmen
of the Church, or the
Fathers and Nurses of the
Church: all de familia Ecclesiae,
and consequently, belonging
to the care of the
Church, and ought therfore
to be susteined by it: for

Saint Paul saith. Hee that
prouideth not for his owne, and
namely for them of his household,
he denieth the faith, and
is worse then an Infidell:

            18 I grow too tedious,
yet before I close vp this
discourse,The danger that Proprietaries of Parsonages stand in. let mee say one
thing more to the Aproprietaries
of Churches, that
happily, they hitherto

haue not dreamed of. And
that is, that by hauing these
Parsonages, they are charged
with Cure of soules,
and make themselues subiect
to the burthen that
lieth so heauily vpon the
head of euery Minister: to
see the seruice of God performed,
the people instructed,
and the poore relieued.
For to these three ends
and the maintenance of
Ministers, were Parsonages
instituted, as not onely the
Canons of the Church, but
the bookes of the Law,

and particularly the Statutes
of 15. R. 2. cap. 6. And
4. H. 4. ca. 12. doe manifestly
testifie. And no man may
haue them but to these
purposes, neither were

the bodies of the Monasteries▪ not of Parsonage tithes. ideo quare how the King had them before the Statute of 31. Regni sui.

For, Nemo potest plus iuris in
aliam transferre, quam ipse
habet: No man may grant a
greater right vnto another,
then hee hath himselfe. And
therefore, goe where they
will, transeunt cum onere,
they carry their charge
with them. Vpon these
reasons Proprietaries are
still saide to beeParson impersonee. Parsons
of their Churches,
and vppon the matter,
are as the Incumbents

               For the monastical persons and Prioresses themselues that could not performe the diuine seruice, were notwithstanding the Incumbents of their Churches: and lay Approptietaries claiming vnder their right, ought also to bee subject to the same burthens. thereof, and the Churches

and ought not to be
conferred vppon any but
spirituall persons, and such
as may themselues doe the

Dier, L. Chiefe Iustice
of the Common Pleas,
there said, that it was an horrible
thing, when these Appropriations
were made to
Prioresses and houses of
Nunnes, because that (although
they were religious
persons, yet they could

not minister the Sacraments
and diuine Seruice.

            My Lord Coke also in the
second part of his Reports,
               Leuesque de Winchesters case, fol. 44 b.
saith, that it is recorded in
History, that there were
(amongst other) two grieuous
persecutions, the
one, vnder Dioclesian; the
other vnder Julian, named
the Apostata: for it is recorded,
that theDiocles. vide Euseb. hist. ecclis. lib 7. cap. 3. Niceph. l. 7. cap. 3. one of them
intending to haue rooted
out all the Professors and
Preachers of the word of
God, Occidit omnes Presbyteros.
               
But this notwithstanding,
Religion flourished
for Sanguis Martyrum est
semen Ecclesiae: The bloud of
the Martyrs is the seed of the
Church; and this was a cruel
and grieuous persecution:
but the persecution vnder
theIuli. vide Theod. hist. lib. 3. cap. 6. & Niceph. lib. 10 cap. 5 other, was more grieuous
and dangerous, Quia
(as the History saith) ipse
occidit presbyrerium. He destroied
the very order of Priesthood.
For hee robbed the
Church, and spoiled spirituall
persons of their reuenues,
and tooke all things

from them whereof they
should liue. And vpon this,
in short time, insued great
ignorance of true religion,
and the seruice of God, and
thereby great decay of
Christian profession. For
none wil apply themselues
or their sons, or any other
that they haue in charge,
to the study of Diuinitie,
when after long and painfull
study, they shall haue
nothing whereupon to
liue. Thus farre my Lord
Coke.
            
            I alledge these Legall

authorities, and leaue Diuinity,
because the Approprietaries
of Parsonages
(which shield themselues
vnder the target of the
Law) may see the opinion
of the great Lawyers of
our owne time and Religion,
and what the bookes
of the Lawe haue of this
matter, to the end, that we
should not hang our consciences
vpon so dangerous
a pinne, nor put too
great confidence in the
equity of Lawes, which we
daily see, are full of imperfection,

often amended, often
altered, and often repealed.
O how lamentable
then is the case of a poore
Proprietary, that dying,
thinketh of no other account,
but of that touching
his Lay vocation, and then
comming before the iudgment

God, must answer also for
thisIt is said in my L. Dier in the case of a common person, that the seruice or a cure is a spirituall administration, and cannot be leased, and that the seruice is not issuing ou

               spirituall function. First
why he medled with it, not

being called vnto it. Then,
why (Proprietaries which haue Vicars endowed, thinke themselues thereby discharged: but though the Vicar be the Parsons deputy to doe the diuine Seruice, yet a superiour care thereof resteth still vpon the Parson himsel
                     •
                  e, and the surplusage of the profits belongeth to the poore, as appeareth by the whole body of Fathers, Doctors, Counsels, &c. medling with it) he
did not the duety that belonged
vnto it, in seeing
the Church carefully serued,
the Minister thereof
sufficientlie mainetained,
and the poore of the
Parish faithfully releeued.
This I say, is the
vse whereto Parsonages
were giuen, and of this
vse wee had notice before

we purchased them: and
therefore, (not onely by
the lawes of God and the
Church, but by the Lawe
of the Land, and the rules
of the Chancery, at this
day obserued in other cases)
wee ought onely to
hold them to this vse, and
no other.
            19 It is not then a work
of bounty and beneuolence
to restore these
appropriations to the
Church,That it is not beneuolence but duety to restore Church. liuings. but of duety and
necessity so to doe. It is a
worke of duty to giue that

               vnto God that is Gods, Mat.
22. 2. And it is a worke of
necessity towards the obtaining
remission of these
sinnes.Ad Mace donium Epist. 54. tom. 2. For Saint Augustine
saith, Non remittetur peccatum,
nisi restituatur ablatum
cum restitut potest: The sinne
shall not be forgiuen, without
restoring of that which is taken
away, if it may be restored.
            
            It is duety, iustice, and
necessity, to giue them
backe vnto God. For if Judas
(who was the first president
of this sinne) were a
thiefe,Iob. 12. 6. as the Holy Ghost

termeth him, for imbeasiling
that which was committed
vnto him for the
maintenance of Christ and
his Disciples, that is of the
Church: by the same reason,
must it also be the euery
to withhold these things
which were giuen for the
maintenāce of the Church
and Ministers of Christ.
And herein it is a degree aboue
that sinne of Iudas, as
robbery is aboue theft: for
Iudas onely detained the
money (deliuered vnto
him) closely and secretly;

but wee and our fathers,
haue inuaded Church-liuings,
and taken them
(as it were by assault) euen
from the sacred body and
person of the Church.
            It is a great sinne to
steale from our Neighbour;
much greater (euer
                  •
               
sacriledge) to steale from
God. If it were so hainous
a fact in Ananias to withholde
part of his owne
goods, which he pretended
hee would giue vnto
God, how much more is
it in vs, presumptuously

to reaue that from God,
that others haue alreadie
dedicated and deliuered
vnto him.Pro. 28. 24. 
               Salomon
saith; Hee that robbeth
his Father and his Mother,
and saith, it is no
sinne, is the companion of
[a murtherer, or] him that
destroieth. But he that purloineth
the things of God,
robbeth his Father, and he
that purloineth the things
of the Church, robbeth
his mother. And therefore
that man is a companion
of the destroier.

               PArdon mee good
Reader, though I
haue neither satisfied
thee, nor my
selfe, in this little discourse. It
is hard to bring a great vessell
into a small creeke, an
argument of many heads and
branches, of much weight,
variety and difficulty, into
a fewe pages. It may bee
thou thinkest the volume
bigge enough for the successe

that Bookes of this nature are
like to haue. I reiect not thy
iudgement, yet would I not
haue others thereby discouraged
from pursuing this cause:
for though Peter fished all
night and got nothing,10. vlt. vers. 3. yet hee
made a great draught vnlooked
for) in the morning. Hee
that directed that net, giue a
blessing to all our labours. For
my owne part (if I catch but
one fish) I shall thinke mine
well bestowed. Howsoeuer, it
shall content me, and I thanke
God for it, that he hath girded
mee with so much strength as

to strike one stroke (though a
weake one) in his battell, and
to cast one stone (though a
small one) against the aduersaries
of his Church.
            Some will say, I haue vsed
too much salt and vineger in
this discourse; and that I haue
bent the great Altillery of
Gods iudgements and threatnings,
vpon a piece of too
light importance. I would the
consciences of men were such,
as oyle and butter might supply
them. But I see they are for
the most part ouergrowne
with so hard a carnosity, as

it requireth strong and potent
corasiues to make an entrance
into them. A Preacher may
shake them now and then with
a Sermon,Act. 24. 26. as Paul did Faelix:
but when the thunder and
lightning are ceased, they are
(like Pharaoh) still where
they were. Yea some haue conscientas

of the hard rocke; therefore
though I haue spoken

cause,) yet in charity I will

man thinke it a light sinne,

may be thou desirest to know

(and many thought not fit to

notes and alterations, as the
difference betweene priuate
and publike things requireth:

but still desiring that I might
further haue shewed my mind
in many passages hereof, (and
particularly touching tithes
in quoto, and such Parsonages
as haue Vicarage
                  •
                well endowed)
which without making
it almost a new worke, I
could not doe; and therefore
resting vpon thy curieous interpretation,
I leaue it to
thee, (for this time)
as it is.
         
         
            
            A SERMON OF
St. Augustines touching
rendring of Tithes.
            
               The occasion of this Sermon or Homily,
was ministred vnto him by
the time of the yeere, it being the
12. Sunday after Trinity, that is
about the beginning of Haruest.
The Scripture that he sitteth vnto
it, is the 18. of Luke. Where
the Pharesie boasteth of his precise
iustice in payment of Tithes.
It is the 219. Sermon de Tenipore:
extant in the tenth Tome
of his works, and there extituled: De reddendis decimis.
            
            
               BY the mercy of
Christ (most beloued
brethren:) the daies
are now at hand, wherein

we are to reape the f
                  •
               uits
of the earth▪ and therefore
giuing thanks to God that
bestoweth them, let vs bee
mindfull to offer, or rather
to render backe vnto him
the tithes thereof.Decret 16. Quae. 1. cap. Decima. For God,
that vouchsafeth to giue
vs the whole,Where you may see a great part of this Sermon cited for Augustines.
                vouchsafeth
also to require backe
againe the tenth, not for
his owne, but for our benefit
doubtlesse. For so
hath hee promised by his
Prophet, saying:Mala. 3. 10. 
               Bring
all the Tithe into my Barnes,
that there may bee meate in

my house; and trie mee, saith
the Lord, in this point, if I open
not the windowes of heauen
vnto you, and giue you fruit
without measure. Lo, wee
haue proued how Tithes
are more profitable vnto
vs, then to God. O foolish
men! What hurt doth God
command, that he should
not deserue to bee heard?
For he saith thus:Exod. 2
                     •
                  . 
                     •
                  9. 
               The first
fruits of thy treshing floore,
and of thy Wine-presse thou
shalt not delay to offer vnto
mee. If it be a sinne, to delay
the giuing: how much

worse is it,16 Quae. 1. ca. decima. Prou. 3. 9. not to giue at
all? And againe, he saith,
Honour thy Lord thy God
with thy iust labours, and offer
vnto him of the fruits of
thy righteousnesse, that thy
barnes may bee filled with
wheat, and thy presses abound
with wine. Thou doest not
this, for God a mercy, that
by and by shalt receiue it
againe with manifold increase.
Perhaps thou wilt
aske, who shall haue profit
by that, which God receiueth,
to giue presently
backe againe? And also

thou wilt aske, who shall
haue profit by that which
is giuen to the poore? If
thou beleeuest, thy selfe
shall haue profit by it, but
if thou doubtest, then thou
hast lost it.
            Tithes (deare Brethren)
are a tribute due vnto the
needy s
                     •
                  ules. Giue therefore
this tribute vnto the poore,
offer this sacrifice vnto
the Priests. If thou hast no
Tithes of earthly fruits: yet
whatsoeuer the Husbandman
hath, whatsoeuer Ar
                  •
               
sustaineth thee, it is Gods,

and he requires Tithe, out
of whatsoeuer thou liuest
by: whether it be Warfare,
or Traffike, or any other
Trade, giue him the tithe.
Some things we must pay
for the ground we liue on,
and something for the vse
of our life it selfe. Yeeld it
therefore vnto him (O man)
in regard of that which
thou possessest: yeeld it (I
say) vnto him, because he
hath giuen thee thy birth:
for thus saith the Lord:Exo. 30. 12 
               Euery
man shall giue the redemption
of his soule, & there shal not

bee amongst them any diseases
or mishaps. Behold, thou
hast in the holy Scriptures
the cautions of the Lord,
vpon which hee hath promised
thee, that if thou
giue him thy Tith, thou
shalt not onely receiue aboundance
of fruites, but
health also of body. Thy
barnes (saith he) shall be filled
with wheate,
               Pro. 3. 10. 
               and thy presses
shall abound with wine,
and there shall bee in them,
neither diseases nor mishaps.
Seeing then, by payment
of Tithes, thou maiest gaine

to thy selfe, both earthly
and heauenly rewards:
why doest thou defraude
thy selfe of both these blessings
together? Heare
therefore,16. Quae. 1
                     •
                   ca. Decima. (O thou zeale-lesse
mortality) Thou knowest,
that all things that thou
vsest are the Lords, and
canst thou finde in thy
heart, to lend him (that
made all things) nothing
backe of his owne? The
Lord God needeth not any
thing, neither demandeth
he a reward of thee, but
honour; he vrgeth thee not

to render any thing that is
thine, and not his. It pleaseth
him to require the first
fruits, and the Tithes of thy
goods, & canst thou denie
them, (O couetous wretch?)
What wouldst thou doe, if
he tooke all the nine parts
to himselfe, and left thee
the tenth onely? And this in
trueth hee doth, when by
with-holding his blessing
of raine, the drought maketh
thy thirsty Haruest
to wither away: and when
thy fruit, and thy vineyard,
are strucken with

haile, or blasted with frost,
where now is the plenty
that thou so couetously
didst reckon vpon? The
nine parts are taken from
thee, because thou wouldst
not giue him the Tenth.
That remaines onely, that
thou refusest to giue,
though the Lord required
it. For this is a most iust
course, that the Lord holdeth,
16. Quae. 1. ca. decimae. 
               If thou wilt not giue him
the tenth, he will turne thee to
the tenth. For it is written,
saith the Lord, Insomuch
as the Tithe of your ground,

the first fruits of your Land;
are with you: I haue seene it,
but you thought to deceiue me:
hauocke and spoile shall bee in
your Treasurie, and in your
houses. Thus thou shalt
giue that to the vnmercifull
Souldier, which thou
wouldest not giue to the
Priest.
            The Lord almighty also
saith: Turne vnto me, that I
may open vnto you the windowes
of Heauen,
               Mal. 3. 10. 
               and that I
may poure downe my blessing
vpon you; and I will not destory
the fruit of your Land,

neither shall the vines of your
field [or the trees of your
orchards] wither away, [or
be blasted] and all nations
shall say, that you are a blessed
people. God is alwaies
ready to giue his blessings.
But the peruersenesse
of man alwaies hindreth
him. For hee would haue
God giue him all things,
and he will offer vnto God
nothing, of that whereof
himselfe seemeth to bee
the owner.
                  This place is cited as out of Augustine Cons. Triburies. ca. 13. An. 895 & before that in concil. Mogunt. pri. c. 8 An. 874. What if God

should say? The man that
I made, is mine; the ground
that thou tillest, is mine;
the seed that thou sowest,
is mine; the cattell that
thou weariest in thy worke
are mine; the showers, the
raine, and the gentle winds
are mine; the heat of the
Sunne, is mine; and since all
the Elements whereby
thou liuest, are mine; thou
that lendest onely thy
hand, deseruest onely the
tithe, or tenth part. Yet because
Almighty God doth
mercifully feede vs, hee

bestoweth vpon the labourer
a most liberall reward
for his paines, and
reseruing onely the Tenth
part vnto himselfe, hath
forgiuen vs all the rest.
            
               Ingratefull and perfidious
deceiuer, I speake to thee
in the word of the Lord.
Behold the yeere is now
ended: giue vnto the
Lord (that giueth the
raine) his reward. Redeeme
thy selfe, O Man,
whilest thou liuest. Redeeme
thou thy selfe whilst
thou maiest. Redeeme thy

selfe (I say) whilest thou
hast wherewith in thy
hands. Redeeme thy selfe,
lest it greedy death preuent
thee, thou then lose
both life and reward together.
Thou hast no reason,
to commit this matter ouer
to thy wife, who happily
will haue another husband.
Neither hast thou
(O woman) any reason to
leaue this to thy husband,
for his minde is on another
wife. It is in vaine, to
tie thy Parents, or thy kinsfolke,
to haue care hereof:

no man after thy death,
surely shall redeeme thee,
because in thy life, thou
wouldest not redeeme thy
selfe. Now then, cast the
burthen of couetousnesse
from thy shoulders, despise
that cruell Lady, who pressing
thee downe with her
intollerable yoake, suffereth
thee not to receiue the
yoake of Christ For as the
yoake of couetousnesse, presseth
men downe vnto hell,
so the yoake of Christ raiseth
men vp vnto heauen.16. Quae 1. ca. decimae.
For tithes are required as a

debt, and hee that will
not giue them, inuadeth an
other mans goods. And
let him locke to it, for
how many men soeuer die
for hunger in the place
where he liueth (not paying
his tithes) of the murthering
of so many men,
shall he appeare guilty before
the tribunall seate of
the eternal Iudge, because
he kept that backe to his
owne vse, that was committed
to him by the Lord
for the Poore.
            
            He therefore that either

desireth to gaine a reward,
or toPr
                     •
                  mereri. obtaine a remission
of his sins, let him pay his
tithe, and bee carefull to
giue almes to the poore, out
of the other nine parts: but
so notwithstanding, that
whatsoeuer remaineth ouer
and aboue moderate
diet, and conuenient apparrell,
bee not bestowed
in riot and carnall pleasure,
but laied vp in the
treasurie of Heauen, by
way of Almes to the poore.
For whatsoeuer God hath
giuen vs more then wee

haue neede of, he hath not
giuen it vnto vs particularly,
but hath committed it
ouer vnto vs to bee distributed
vnto others: which
if wee dispose not accordingly,
wee spoile and rob
them thereof. Thus farre S.
Augustine.
            
            
               ERasmus in a generall
censure of these Sermons
de Tempore, noteth
many of them not to bee
Saint Augustines: so also
doth Master Perkins, and
diuers other learned men,

who hauing examined
them all all particularly,
and with great aduisement,
reiecting those that
appeared to bee adulterat
or suspected, admit this
notwithstanding as vndoubted.
And although
Bellarmine seemeth to
make a little question of
it, yet hee concludeth it
to bee, without doubt,
an excellent worke: and
eitherForte non est Augustini iste sermo tamen insignis est sine dubio & antiqui alicuius atris, nam inde tanquam ex Augustino multa sunt adscripta in Decret. 16. q 1. Bellarm lib. de clericis cap. 25. Saint Augustines
owne, or some other ancient
Fathers. But hee
saith, that many things

               are cited out of it as out of
Augustine in Decret. 16. qo
1. And to cleare the matter
further, I finde that
some parts heereof are alleadged
vnder the name
of Augustine, in Concil. Triburiens.
(which was in the
yeere of our Lord 895)
cap. 13. And twenty yeere
before that also, in Concil.
Moguntin. 1. cap. 8. So that
Antiquitie it selfe, and diuers
Councels, accept it
for Augustines.
            
            I will not recite a great
discourse to the effect of

this Sermon amongst the
workes of Augustine in the
Treatise De rectitudine
Christiane religionis; because
Erasmus iudgeth that
Treatise not to bee Augustines.
Yet seemeth it
likewise to be some excellent
mans, and of great
antiquity. But if thou
wouldst heare more what
Augustine saith vnto thee
of this matter, take this
for a farewell;Homil 48. ex lib. 50. Ham▪ com. 10.

            An Appendix by the Author.
            
               I Haue beene often sollicited within these
two yeeres, both to reimprint this little
Treatise, and also to publish a greater
worke much of the same Argument.
Some especiall reasons haue made mee vnwilling
to doe either. Not that I doe, aut
clypeum abijcere, aut causam deserere:
But I finde my arme too feeble for so great
an attempt▪ and in matters of such weight
and consequence, a better opportunity is to
be expected, then is yet afforded. I desire
therefore not to be hastned herein, though
hee that published my Booke in Scotland
(out of his zeale to the cause) taketh that
for one of his Motiues.
               In his Epist. Dodicat
                     •
                  ry. When I did first
let it goe forth: I did it only in couert manner:
not thinking it worthy of the broad eye

of the World, nor holding it fit to haue that
which was done in a corner, preached vppon
the house top: or that which passed
priuatly betweene me and my friend, to flie
(in this sort, at once) to both the Poles of
the Monarchy. Hereupon I hitherto by
entreaty with held it from a reimpression:
But I being in the Countrey: and It being
now to me as 
                  
                     •
                  lius emancipatus, and out
of my power: the Printer hath taken aduantage
of his liberty, and in my absence
printed it againe with the former infirmities
            I wish, since it must needes be thus: that
I had ouer run it with a new hand: aswell
to explane it in some things, as to helpe and
fortifie it in other. For the Argument hath
many aduersaries, not of the Laity onely:
but amongst the Church-men themselues.
All are not pleased with this forme of
Tithes 
               Maintenance: other are not satisfied
how it is due. Some also conceiue Scriptures
in this manner, some in that: and

where one is best pleased, there another
findeth most exception. Thus he that commeth
vpon the Stage, is the Obiect and
Subiect of euery mans opinion. Yet must I
herein confesse my selfe beholden vnto many:
for I vnderstand this small Essay hath
giuen them good liking▪
            
            To satisfie all I labour not: but to the
worthier sort I would performe what I
could. Being therefore enformed (about a
yeare almost since) that some particular
Diuines of learning and iudgement,
(conceiuing well of my Booke,) supposed
that I had departed from the ancient
and moderne interpreters in applying
the 12. verse of the 83. Psalme. Onely to
the sanctified things of the Iewes which
(they said) was spoken of all their houses
and Cities in generall. I did then vnto
them (as I thought it fit) reddere rationem
& fidei & facti. And in like manner
(because the booke goeth forth againe vpon
a new aduenture, and may encounter

with the like obiections,) I held it now
as necessary to adde something vnto it in
that point being so materiall Yet must
I signifie vnto you, that they which
tooke that exception, accounted both my
argument and whole discourse the stronger
(notwithstanding) Ex consequente:
as namely, that if it were so heinous a
sinne to inuade the temporall things of
the Iewes, much more must it needes bee
to inuade the spirituall. So that no man
is either freed or cased by this suggestion,
but rather the more ensnared and ouerwhelmed.
Neuerthelesse (I vnderstand)
that which followeth, hath cleared this
point vnto them: and I hope so shall it also
do
                  •
                vnto others (which separate not themselues
from our Church) if cause require.
            
               
               I Am not ignorant that many
moderne and some Ancient
Interpreters vnderstand the
body of the 83 Psalme, of the taking
of the houses and cites of the Iewes in
generall, not onely of the Temple and
Synagogues, nor onely of the Cities of
the Leuites: for the very historicall
texture of the Psalme discouers as
much. But that branch of it, where
on 
                  〈◊〉
                I fastened my anchor, and
where I chiefly insisted, namely the
12 verse, touching the taking of the
houses of God in possession, (which indeed
is the center of the Psalme: what
interpretation soeuer it receiueth)
most of them interpret it primarily
and positiuely for the Temple
               
                  〈◊〉
               . Holy things, then per translationem
for Hierusalem, and by consequence,

for all Iudea, (and the people
of God) in respect that they were
there planted.
            For though wee following Genebr
                     •
                  d,
Caluin and Arias Montanus,
translate it litterally, Take the houses
of God in possession; yet the Septuagints
& Greekes interpret it 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               :
And Hierome in the Latin Vulgar accordingly▪
               Sanctuarium Dei: in his
other translation called Haebraeica veritas,
(which also agreeth with that
elder, cited by Lucius in the primer
ages of the Church) Pulchritudine
                     ••
                  
Dei: Pellican, electissima: all of them
by such denominations, as are most
proper to the Temple & holy things.
And therefore the Church in all former
ages and for the most part yet
also beyond the Seas, euen in the reformed
parts of Germany, retaineth
that interpretation of Sanctuarium

Dei, as best agreeing with the intent
of the Hebrew, which Hierome
in the Preface to his translation professeth
confidently (by many witnesses)
that he hath changed in nothing.
            I alleage all this, but to 
                  〈◊〉
               , that
by what variety of words soeuer, the
translators expresse the originall
Hebrew, yet they all concu

caried vnto temporall.
            Our selues also in our owne English
translation, vnderstand the houses
of God, for places dedicated to the seruice
of God. And therefore in the 9.
verse of the 74. Psalme, where our
Church-Psalter saith, burnt vp all the
houses of God in the land: the Geneua
and the Kings addition report it,
burnt vp al the Synagogues of God in the

Land. So likewise in the 1. verse of
the 84. Psal. The dwellings of God are
expresly spoken of his Tabernacles,
and holy habitations, not of his Temporall.
            
            Yet doe I not deny; but (as I say)
Secunda intentione, the words Sanctuarium,
or Houses of God, in the 83.
Psalme are truely carried to all Iudea
and the people of God, howbeit Hierome
noteth expresly no such matter
vpon it: neither could Augustine find
it in the litterall or historicall sence of
the text: and therefore he deduceth
it to the people of God by way of
Tropology, vsing the metaphor of Saint
Paul. 1. Cor. 3. Sanctuarium: (saith he)
Templum dei sanctum est: quod estis vos.
And Lyra accordingly, Sanctuarium:
id est (saith he) Hierusalem, in qua erat
templum dei: & per consequens: terram
Iudea, cuius metropolis erat Hierusalem.
            
            
               
               Arnobius likewise of the Ancient,
taketh it first for the Temple & holy
vessell: then extensiuely, for the people
and Land of Israel. As for Cyprian,
Origen, Tertullian, Ambrose, Chrysostome,
Gregory, they meddle not
with it, that I can finde, nor Hierome
otherwise then as I haue mentioned.
            But admit that at this day most
doe expound it for the Temporalties
of the Iews, aswell as for their Leuiticall
and Sanctified things: What doth
this contradict my application of
this Psalme against Spoilers of Churches?
or wherein is my errour? I affirme
the Genus vpon one of the membra
diuidentia, and they vpon both. I
vpon one not exclusiue, and they vppon
both copulatiue. Doe not they
then themselues affirme my assertion?
Let Schoolemen be Iudges. Yea
doe they not iustifie and enforce it?

For if God loueth the gates of Syon, more
then all the dwellings of Iacob, Psal. 87.
2. that is, the outward and petty things
of his Church, more then a
                  •
               l the stately
temporalties of his Lay people, yea, if he
loueth Iacob but for Sion, that is, the
People but for the Church: then Ex necessario
to consequente, when the Prophet
denounceth such heauy things against
them, that menaced Gods, Lay
people, and their possessions, how much
the rather, doth hee it against such as
with greater fury and impiety afflict
his more peculiar and chosen seruants,
his Cleargy, his Leuites, his
first borne? Against these I say, that
forbeare not to violate the things
more deare vnto him: His Temple,
his Oracle, his holy mysteries,
that is, things belonging to his
honour and diuine seruice, things

and meanes, ordained to the propagation
of his blessed word? For this
is the consequence of destroying our
Churches: this killeth the bird in the
shel: and to a person offending in this
nature, wrote I my Booke.
            By like reason, it may also be said;
that this Psalme was framed against
Heathens and Infidels, (which in open
hostility assailed the Church &
people of God with fire and sword)
not against such as be our owne brethren,
& of the family of the Church,
though (in some sort) they doe iniury
vnto it. I answere that the Ammonites
and Moabites were also of the
kindred of Israel: yea, the Edomites,
and Ismalites, of the linage of Abraham,
aswell as the Israelites themselues:
yet when they ioined with
them that sought the destruction of
the Church; the curses of the Pr
                     •
                  
                  prophet
               
went as freely and as fiercely
against them as the rest. So if our
Church be spoiled by her brethren,
her children, or kindred, the sentence
is all one against them, as against
Heathen and Infidels, yea, and that
also more iustly and deseruedly by
the iudgement of the Prophet, who
accounteth the treachery of a familiar
friend much more intollerable then
the violence of an open Enemy. Psalm.
55. 12.
            But say I haue erred (which indeed
is too common with mee though it
be humanum) and doth the more easily
befall mee, hauing saluted the
Schoole of Diuinity, onely a longe
and a limine: I am therefore readie
with Augustine to put it amongst
my retractations, if there be
cause why? yet (as he said of Romulus)
            
               Sed tamen errorē quo tu
                     •
                  atur habet.
               
For I am not the Author of this expositiō,
neither is it my own weapon
but borrowed, and put into my hand
by others of elder time. I confesse
that as they which go to battell, whet
their swordes, and bend their bowes: so
I sharpened both the edge and the
point of it to my purpose. For all spirits
are not cast out by ordinarie
power, nor all humors perswaded by
ordinary reason. Knowing therefore
what was necessary in particular for
the party to whom I wrot, I applied
my selfe, and my pen to that particular
necessity: yet, not with Zidkiah to
seduce him by vntruthes,1 R. 2
                     •
                   17. but as a
faithfull Michaiah to leaue nothing
vntold that belonged to his danger.
            See then what I haue to defend my
selfe withall, both of ancient & later
fathers & Doctrs•
                of the church: the first
application (as I take it) that euer was

made of this Psalme, was (only to the
purpose I alleadge it) by 
                  
                     •
                  ucius a deuout
Bishop of Rome, in the bloody
age of the primitiue Church, about
225. yeeres after Christ: of whom (to
let passe Cyprian) Bale,
               Epist. l. 3. a man of our
owne,Epist. 1
                     •
                  . giueth this testimony; That hee
was a faithfull seruant in the Lords
house,—and enriched his Church with
healthfull doctrine, and afterward being
purified in the Lambes blood, hee pierced
the heauenly Paradice, being put to death
at Valentinians commandement, Anno
255. This Lucius (as I noted in the
margent of my Booke,See 
                     〈◊〉
                   page 60. 
               pag. 39.) in
an Epistle of his to the Bishops of Gallia
and Spaine: hauing determined many
things touching the Church, & somewhat
also against spoilers and defrauders
thereof (concluding them by the
example of Iudas to bee thieues and
sacrilegious persons) hee proceedeth

with them in this manner: De talibus,
id est (saith hee) qui facultates Ecclesiae
rapiunt, fraudant, & auferunt: Dominus
comminans omnibus per prophetam
loquitur dicens: Deus ne taceas tibi: ne
sileas, &c. Reciting the whole 83.

            I tooke this reuerend Father and
great Doctor of the Church, liuing
in the purity of religion, in the times
of persecution, and so neere the ages
of the Apostles, to be a faithfull

               Petrus Damianus a Cardinall,
whilest that title was rather a name
of Ministry then of Dignity, and

long before it became mounted and
purpurate, a starre of his time, now
almost 600. yeers old, vnderstandeth
this Psalm also of Church possessions,
& dignities, & out of it doth vehemētly
confute the Chaplains of Duke Gothi

               mony to
buy Bishoprickes and Priests places,
so they paid nothing for the imposition
of hands (an opinion too common
at this day) and hee applieth against
them the interpretation of the
names of the Heathen Princes there
mentioned, and concludeth them to
be haereditario quodam iure Sanctuarij

                  , the first Postillator
               
of the Bible, (who flourished
Anno 1240. a little also, before
that order was distinguished with
the Horse and Red Hat, and a man
to whom all the Preachers of Christendome
are more beholden,
then many of them are aware: for
much of that good iuce that sweetneth
the expositions they read, dropt
from his penne, though now like riuers
falling into other channels, it
hath lost his name) in his worthy
Comment vpon the Psalter, applieth
the wordes, haereditate possideamus
sanctuarium dei, against
those that ambitiously seeke Church-liuings
and dignities, dispiersing
the curses of this Psalme, as well
among the great men of the Cleargy
as them of the Laity, which by threatning
or fauour obtaine Ecclesiastical
promotions: and particularly against

such men of the Church, as conferre
Prebends and dignities vpon their
Nephewes and kindred, building (as
he saith) Sion in (their) bloud, and Ierusalem
in in
                     •
                  quity. Neither spareth hee
the Popes themselues, but chargeth
them also that they possesse Gods Sanctuary,
by way of inheritance, in that
they keepe the succession of the Papacy
among such as bee onely of the
Romane nation. And much more to
this purpose, which were here too
long to recite: but (concluding that
the Prophet hath leuelled at them all
in this Psalme) he saith, De omnibus
istis sequitur: Deus meus pone eos vt retam,
&c.
            
            
               Ioannes Vitalis, who liued aboue
300. yeeres since, (and for his fame,
and learning, was also called to bee a
Cardinal, ere that this dignity was yet
at the highest pitch) vehemently enceth

this Psalme against the Great
men that prey vpon the Church, applying
the interpretation of the
names therein mentioned very bitterly
vnto them. And saith further,
that they possesse the Sanctuary of
God by inheritance, which enter into it
vnworthily, or in succession to their
vnckles, nephewes, and parents, and
they also which giue Benefices in
that manner, wasting thereby as it
were Christs hereditary patrimony;

               Nicolaus de Lyra, who flourished
about the same time; our owne country-man,
(though of Iewish Parents)
a starre also in that age, of the first
magnitude, for his learning; and exquisit
aboue all in the Hebrew, (it being
his mother tongue, and eleborate
by him) whose iudgemēt I the rather

esteeme, for that Luther loued him,
and preferred him aboue all Interpreters,
as Luther himselfe testifieth
in the 2. and 9. chap. of Genesis. He (I
say, as before I haue noted) expoundeth
it: first, and properly for the
Temple (vnder which I vnderstand all
things dedicated vnto God) then for
Ierusalem, because (saith he) the Temple
was there: and lastly by consequence
(for that is his owne word) for the
Land of Iudea, whose chiefe City Ierusalem
was. So that he maketh the Temple
and things belonging to God, to
be the maine part whereat the Prophet
aimeth, and the City and Countrey
to follow, but by inference and
implication.
            Come to the later Writers, Genebrard
noteth vpon Sanctuarium dei;
that the Hebrew word is, Habitacula,
and for the postill, faith; Generaliter de

diuinis omnibus templis, vrbibus locis & oppidis
populi dei. So that if hee had been questioned
further; how he vnderstood Habitacula,
specialiter, it is then like hee would
haue answered, de diuinis omnibus templis
tantum: that is, onely of Churches. But be
it as it is, he setteth them in the first place,
as the proper signification, and the rest in
cons
                  •
               quence, as analogicall, according to
Augustine & our Countrey-man Ly

                  anus.
            
            As for Luther, he expoundeth not this
Psalme himselfe, that I can finde; but you
see what hee attributeth to Lyras iudgement.
            
               Pellican a great Hebritian, translateth it
Possideamus nobis alectissima dei, and expoundeth
it in like manner as before,
Templum ciuitatem vasa populum dei.
            
            
               Pomeranus interpreteth it of them that
did seeke to make themselues Lords and
heires of the Temple.
            To conclude, because the newest thing
                  •
               
are most acceptable with many. The last

man that hath written vpon the Psalter,
Lorinus a Iesuit, (and therefore I will not
presse his authority) yet to doe him right,
very well esteemed amongst great Clarks
of our owne Church for much good learning
(though in matters of controuersie,
full enough of Romish leuin) reciteth
some-what more briefly the former interpretations
of Petrus Damianus, Hugo
Cardinalis and Iohn Vitalis, and approuing
those their applications, putteth them still
on into the world, as truly consonant to
the tenor of the Psalme, which notwithstanding
I doubt not hath also many other
expositions, as herbes haue vsually diuers
vertues and operations. But thus the eldest
and newest expositors are wholly for mee,
many also (& of the best of thē) of the middle
ages, none that I know against me. For
although Musculus, Bucer, Caluin, Marlorat,
Mollerus, expound this Psalme historically
of the Countrey and Nation of the Iewes,
yet when then apply it to the Church of

Christ (as otherwise there were no vse of it)
they make that application by way of figure
& analogy; And then is there no cause
to raise an antithesis, or contrariety betweene
them and me. For to reconcile the
matter, S. Ierome in his entrance into the
exposition of this Psalme, telleth vs, that
wee may expound it figuratiuely of the
Church (which I vnderstand in matters of
action, gouernement, doctrine) or historically
of the people of the Iewes and nations about
them. And though Caluin himselfe
pursueth for the most part the historicall
interpretation, yet when he commeth to
the 12. verse, he faith; I terum accusat profanos
homines sacrilegij, quod praedateria licentia
inuolant in ipsam dei haereditatem.
            
            
               Thus much, and too much touching
this point. As it is saide in the end of the
Machabees: If I haue done well and as the story
required, it is the thing that I desired: but if
I haue spoken slenderly and barely, it is that I
could. Let no man therefore rely vpon me,

but learn of them that are bound to teach;
For the Priest slips should preserue knowledge,
and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he
is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts. Mal. 2. 
                  •
               
            
            Other things there be, wherein I would
willingly haue enlarged my self a little: but
as Popilius in Liuy discribing a circle about
Antiochus enforced him to answere before
hee stept out of it. So the Printer (hauing
printed al to the last sheet before I knew it)
restraineth me, ad articulum temporis, within
which accordingly I must needs end.
