            What might induce this great Doctor to come vnto Christ is as full of supposes, as farre from certaintie. Some thinke Nicodemus came to tempt Christ, and therefore cunningly extolles him, as the Wrestler liftes vp his aduersarie, that he may cast him downe: or as the Hyaena, who counterfayting a Mans voyce, seekes to destroy him. Some thinke it was a sinister influence of vaine-glory that drew this fantasticke to Christ, as the Athenians into their exchange onely to heare newes. Some thinke Derision came to catch our Sauiour in a trap, that so Rash-iudgment might condemne him. Others presume, that being affected with Christes doctrine, he came to gratulate our Sauiour, as the best sort of our bad hearers, turne their owne profiting into the prayse of the Teacher: But I thinke this lukewarme louer comming so by night, was more afrayd of ye world, then affected with

            O Nicodemus, art thou a Doctor in Israel, and knowest not these thinges? Art thou a Teacher is Christ his schoole, and hast not yet learned Christs-crosse? How art thou accounted a wyse man in Israel, being a foole in Religion? There is no Wisedome but the Trueth, in qua

If this was his prayer, much more should it be thy wish, since he was but King of their bodyes, but thou art a Corrector of soules. How canst thou teach men to shun the second death, which art so ignorant of the seconde Birth? A Teacher should be Organon veritatis, the right hand of Trueth,
                to minister to euery one their food in due season. Thou art an ouerseer in Israel, and art shamefully ouerseene thy selfe. Now Age hath snowne downe Winter on thy head, those haires which should be Heraulds of Wisedome,

I woulde haue my Disciples to shine as lightes: but thou art a counterfeite Diamond, made pretious by y• foyle of Moses Chaire, where thou art falsely set.

Where the Ship-maister sleepeth, who feares not sinking? And where the Shepheard watcheth not the Sheepe goe round to the shambles.

                   A benefite or guift is a work of good wil, that pleasures as much in the giuing, as the receauer doth in the Guift. So then, if Gods Guift be a worke of good-will towardes man, we may m

                  the Cittie, which I haue not created: If God create Euill for a correction, much more doth he create Good for our comfort. He is like the good Father, that spendes himselfe in prouiding for his sonne: or the kinde Mother, which no sooner hath a sweete thing, but she giues it her childe: or the cunning Artificer, who cares not what cost he bestowes on his worke, to make it more beautifull. So God is affected towardes his creature: as he made all exceeding good, so he desires the good of all, especially Man, whom he made for the Glasse of his glory, and the Image of himselfe, to be his Sonne on earth, and his Heire in heauen: and though heere Man is but Tennant at will, yet he sittes at an easie rent, the bare debt of Thankfulnes.
               The summe of this discourse is, seeing God is the giuer of all Good, we must looke for all good thinges at his handes: and desire nothing that is good, farther then it is Gods Guift: For that which is Snatcht from others, is the Diuels bayte, not Gods blessing. The world is full of such snatching Nimrods, mightie hunters:
                   for some hunt after Honour, some after

Pleasure▪ and some after Profite: And these thre Hunters haue almost hunted all Religion and Uertue out of our borders. But let them know that, Quaedam dat Deus misericorditer, quaedam sinit habere iratus: Whatsoeuer comes by Oppression, Tyrannie, Bryberie, Simmonie, Vsurie, is not Gods guift, and therefore no good guift, but a pledge of his anger.
                   Therefore whatsoeuer thou possessest or desirest, let Conscience be thy Cater, and the Word thy Warrant: so shall the Transitorities of this lyfe, be vnto thee a Handsell of Heauen and an earnest penny of that Blisse, which the Worlde neuer dreames of.

               But this our Loue is but a shadow of

Gods Loue, an Arme of his Sea, a Drop of his Fountaine, a little Flame of his lyuing Fire: neither in qualitie so pretious, nor in quantitie so spacious by infinite degrees. God loues without cause, our loue is our duetie: God loues vs his enemies, we loue him our friend: God loues without reward, our loue inherites heauen: God loues vs first, our loue payes him backe his owne: Gods loue is feruent, our loue is luke-warme: Gods loue is infinite, our loue is little, like our knowledge, and low of stature like Zacheus: Christ must dine in our house, his loue must shine in our hartes before we can reflect our borrowed beames, and loue him againe. The excellencie of this Gods loue can neither be expressed by our tongue, nor impressed in our hartes: as it made the World of nothing, so the World is nothing to it: for it comprehendeth all & is not comprehended of any.

This teacheth our Fayth to stand, and our Hope to climbe, and our loue to burne: This cheereth our labours, & beareth our losses, and teacheth our sorrow to smile. In a word, to this exceeding Loue, alone we owe our saluation: Therefore damnable is the Doctrine of the Church of Roome, that teacheth vs to erre both in the manner and matter of our Fayth: First, in the manner they teach vs to doubt of our saluation. O iniurie intollerable, to doubt of the Promise, where such a Loue is our warrant: what more free then guift, or who

more faythfull then God the giuer▪ shall his Loue giue Christ vnto me, and my vnbeliefe thrust him from me▪ Is the Trueth like vnto man, that he should lie▪ or is his Arme shortened, that he can not saue▪ God forbid. This Guift is sealed with the blood of his Sonne, registred in the sight of heauen, witnessed by the holy Angels, passed with an oath to the World. O Incredulitie, the wit of fooles, how many Blessinges dost thou barre vs from▪

                     •
                  s trust in our Merites. Pauls whole Epistle to the Romans shootes onely at this marke, to beate downe the pride of Man, who would faine be his owne sauiour, to depresse Nature, and extoll Grace: therefore in the end he addes this vpshot,

                  So then we are saued not of Workes, but by Grace. And Augustine sayth, Gratia est nullo modo, quae non est gratuita omni modo, Grace is all Grace, or no Grace at all.
                   Againe he sayth, Quisqui

                   so I say to all, Gods Loue is sufficient for you: this Loue made you, when you were nothing: and this Loue must saue you, now you are worse then nothing. Let the Papistes cloath themselues in the rags of their owne Righteousnes, and the lewes trust to the

                  Thus hauing discouered the rech treasure of Gods Loue, let vs know our duty, that we may be accounted worthy to winne and to weare it. S. Aug. Lib. de Anima et Spiritu,
                   seemes to studie for this dutie, saying: Miser ego, quantum deberem diligere Deum meum qui me fecit cúm non er

                   The World cryes shame vpon an vngratfull person. If thou shouldest trauayle into a strange Countrey, and there fall into the handes of the

We are all Strangers in the world, and Passengers from earth to heauen: now in our Iourney we meete with the Worlde and the Diuell, and these robbe vs of all grace, these wound vs & leaue vs for dead: now God of his exceeding mercie findes vs out, and sendes his Sonne that good Sama

O Loue, beyonde all loue, how much thou art? O blessed God, teach vs the depth of thy Loue, that we may know the debt of our thankfulnesse. Thine endlesse Blessing hath made vs bankruptes, for we are not able to repay the interest of thy Loue. If we proffer our goodes, alas we receiued them of thee: if we offer our lyues, they are redeemed by thee: Surely this shalbe our thankes, the Remembraunce of thy Mercie: And since thy blessed Sonne hath taught vs, That the louing of thee, is the keeping of thy Commandements, we will labour to be all keepers: as we haue spent our time in the seruice of the Worlde, the Flesh, and the Diuell, so will we spende

               NOw are we come to the Guift it selfe, the greatest that euer was, whether we respect the bountie of God, or the blessing of Man: for what could God giue greater then himsefe? or what could Man

                  (He hath giuen.) God did not lende his Sonne, nor sell him, but he gaue him to vs: Herein appeares the riches of his

Mercie, and the greatnes of our pouertie: he did not sell him, we were not able to buy him, but he gaue him: which shewes vs to be Beggers & Bankrupts, and that God must for pittie giue vs a Sauiour franke and free, when we had neither meanes to deserue him, nor grace to desire him. (His onely begotten Sonne.) He gaue vs not an Angel, nor a Seruant, nor a Creature, but his Sonne. The name of a Sonne is musicke in the eare of a Father: and the life of a Child is more precious in yt Parents eye, then their owne safetie: Many Parents to saue their Sonnes life, haue willingly spilt their owne: examples hereof we haue in prophane, & sacred Scriptures, we will take a handful from a heape. In Gene. 37. whē good father Iacob heard of the supposed death of his sonne, (his wicked childrē giuing a false fire to his feare) he was smitten with sorrow, riuers of teares gushed out, and his hart bled at his eyes, for the supposed slaughter of Ioseph: his affection to his sonne was too hot to admit the cold comfort of his other children: he that had wrestled with an Angell, could not wrestle with this affection, and therefore in the

griefe of a father, he sets downe this resolution: Ioseph my sonne, is surely to

               This was much to giue a Sonne yet as if this were not enough to expresse God loue, the holy Ghost addeth his onely begotten
                  
                  Sonne, he gaue not an adopted Sonne, as Abraham offred a Ramme in stead of Isaac. But his owne Sonne: And herein appeares his perfect Iustice, a blessed president to al Iusticiaries. In all Gods actions this vertue swayes: though his mercy be about all his workes, yet Mercy and Iustice must kisse togither. The dearest droppe of Christes blood must be shed, before Gods Iustice be left vnsatisfied.
               Nay this was not enough to satisfie Gods Mercie, his Loue mountes a degree higher, and further it cannot ascende. He gaue his onely begotten Sonne. When the world could not yeelde the price of our Redemption, he searched his owne boosome for a Sauiour, and gaue vs his onely Sonne. If God had many Sonnes his mercy had been meaner, and his Loue had seemed lesse, but he gaue vs not one Sonne of manie, but one and all, his onely Sonne: for whose sake he spared not his Angels, his delight, his boosome friend, the Image of himselfe, for the ransome of the world.

               The instruction that we must learne from the consideration of this vnspeakable Guift Christ, is two folde: First, we are taught to returne our Loue againe, as Aug. sayes, Sinon amare, saltem redamare debemus: As God hath giuen vs his onely Sonne, so we must shew our reciprocall Loue to God, and for his Sonne, giue him our selues: as he hath giuen vs wealth, we must bestow our wealth on him againe: as he hath giuen vs libertie, honour, children, long life, knowledge, wisedome, courage, &c. these must all waight on him, and doe him honour and seruice: Thus we must giue him Loue for Loue, againe.
               Second vse of Gods vnspeakabe Bountie, is to teach vs to loue our Brethren. Christ teacheth vs this lesson for his Loue,
                  
saying: I haue giuen you an example how to loue one an other. Brethren must be vnited in the bonde of mutuall Loue, like S
