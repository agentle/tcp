                        WEll done my lusty bloods, Well done. Fit, fit obseruance for this May-morning; Not the May-Moneth alone, they take when it comes; Nor the first weeke of that Moneth; Nor the first day; but the first minute of the first houre, of the first day. Loose no time bloods, loose no time; though the Sunne goe to bedde neuer so much before you, yet be you vp before him; call the golden sluggard from the siluer armes of his Lady, to light you into yours, when your old father Ianuary here in one of his last dayes, thrusts his fore-head into the depth of Mayes fragrant bosome: What may you Aprilles performe then? O what may you doe? Well yet will I say thus much for my selfe, wheresoeuer the affections of youth are, there must needs be the instruments, and where the instruments are, there must of necessity be the faculties; What am I short of them then? A sound old man, ably constituted, holsomly dyeted, that tooke his May

By the Masse I feele nothing that stands against it, and therefore sweet May I salute thee with the yongest: I haue loue to employ thee in, as well as the prowdest yong princock, and so haue at you Mistris Frances China: haue at you Mistris Franke: I'

                     How now? Gods my life, I wonder what made this May-morning so cold, and now I see 'tis this Ianuary that intrudes into it; what paper is that he holds in hand trow we?

                     Here haue I put her face in rime, but I feare my old vaine will not stretch to her contentment. O haire, no haire but beames stolne from the Sunne.

                     This could I send, but person, person does it: A good presence, to beare out a good wit; a good face, a prety Court legge, and a deft dapper personage, no superfluous dimensions, but fluent in competence; for it is not Hector but Paris, not the full armefull, but the sweet handfull that Ladies delight in.

                     To sweet Mistris Franciscina: with whom I heare thou art ready to lye downe, thou art so great with her.

                     Neuer examine that man; I would not trouble you with carrying too much at once to her, only tell her, such a man will resolue her, naming me: and I doe not greatly care, if I take the paines to come to her, so I stay not long, and be let in priuily: and so without making many wordes: here they be▪ put them vp closely I beseech thee, and deliuer them as closely.

                     Neuer saw'st him in thy life, at least neuer knew'st him; but for his bounty sake to all his well willers, if this message be friendly discharged, I may chance put a deare friend of him into your bosome: Sir, and make you profitably acquainted.

                     But yfaith Sir: doe you euer hope to winne your purpose at my losing hands, knowing her (as all the world does) a woman of that approued lowlynesse of life, and so generally tryed?

                     As for that take thou no care, shee's a woman, is shee not?

                     Sure I doe take her to haue the flesh and blood of a woman.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     Then good enough, or then bad enough, this token shall be my Gentleman Vsher to prepare my accesse, and then let me alone with her.

                     I marry Sir, I thinke you would be alone with her; Well Sir, I will doe my best, but if your Gentleman Vsher should not get entrance for you now, it would be a griefe

to me.

                     Tush man, you must not doe so, if you haue good clothes and will be noted let am all come in afore you, and then as I said shall you see a lusty crew of Gallants, some Gentlemen, some none; but thats all one: he that beares himselfe like a Gentleman, is worthy to haue beene borne a Gentleman: some aged haue beards, and some haue none, some haue money, and some haue none, yet all must haue meate: Now wil

Doe you then ath' tother side seeme to neglect their obseruance as fast, let your countenance be proofe against all eyes, not yeelding or confessing in it any inward defect. In a word be impudent enough, for thats your chiefe vertue of society.

no man honour, but vpon equall termes; for looke how much thou giu'st any man aboue that, so much thou tak'st from thy selfe: he that will once giue the wall, shall quickly be thrust into the kennell: measure not thy carriage by any mans eye, thy speech by no mans eare, but be resolute and confident in doing and saying, and this is the grace of a right Gentleman as thou art.

Talke any thing, thou car'st not what, so it be without offence, and as neere as thou canst without sence.

                     Well Sir, one point more I must remember you of. After dinner there will be play, and if you would be counted compleate, you must venture amongst them; for otherwise, theill take you for a Scholler or a Poet, and so fall into contempt of you: for there is no vertue can scape the accompt of basenesse if it get money, but gaming and law; yet must you not loose much money at once, for that argues little wit at all times.

                     The best that may be, for shee sleepes like a sucking P

                     Leo.
                     And could you put a friend in your place thinke you?
                  
                  
                     Tem.
                     Nay birlady Sir, backe with that legge, for if any thing come on't but well, all the burthen will lye vpon me.
                  
                  
                     Leo.
                     Why what can come of it? only that by this meanes I may solicite her loue my selfe.
                  
                  
                     Tem.
                     I but who knowes if the Deuill (God blesse vs) should be great wee', how you would vse her?
                  
                  
                     Leo.
                     What do'st thou take me for a beast, to force her that I would make my wife?
                  
                  
                     
                     Tem.
                     Beast Sir; Nay ther's no beastlinesse in it neither, for a man will shew like a man in those cases: and besides, you may marre the bedde, which euery body will see that comes in; and that I would not for the best gowne I shall weare this twelue Moneth.
                  
                  
                     Leo.
                     Well, to put thee out of that feare, it shall be worth such a gowne to thee.

                     I thanke you for that Sir, but thats all one, and thus Sir, my old Master Honorio, at two a clocke will be at Tilting, and then will his sonne Signior Aurelio, and his man Augelo, be abroad; at which houre if you will be at the backe gate, and muffle your selfe handsomely, you may linger there till I call you.

                     I marry Sir, so I may be there long enough.

                     But when is the happy houre of our meeting?
                  
                  
                     Lod.
                     Marry Sir, thats something vncertaine, for it depends wholly vpon her fathers absence, and when that will be God knowes: but I doubt not it will happen once within this twelue-Moneth.
                  
                  
                     Aur.

                     Lod.
                     Nay harke you, you are all vpon the spurre now, but how many louers haue seru'd seauen twelue-Moneths prenticeships, for the freedome of their Mistris fauours? notwithstanding to shorten your torments, your man Angelo
                        
must be the meane, to draw the lap wing her father from his nest, by this deuice that I tell you.
Enter Angelo.
                     
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     I did euer dreame that once in my life good fortune would warme her cold hand in my naked bosome. And that once is now come, Ile lay hold vpon't, yfaith; I haue you my little squire, I haue you vpon mine Anueill, vpon which I will mallet you and worke you; coyning crownes, chickins, bracelets, and what not out of you; for procuring you the deere gullage of my sweete heart mistresse Francischina.
                     
                  
                  
                     Aure.
                     I am glad it rests in my kinde seruant Angelo. Angelo, well met, it lies in thee now, make me no more thy master, but thy friend, and for euer happy in thy friendship.
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     In what part of me does that lie Sir, that I may pull it out, for you presently?
                  
                  
                     Aure.
                     My friend Lodouico heere hath told me, what thou reuealedst to him to day, touching his vncle Lorenzo, and his louesute to Francischina.
                     
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Slight I told it him in secret sir.
                  
                  
                     Lod.
                     And so did I tell it him Angelo, I am a Iew else.
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     It may well be sir, but what of that?
                  
                  
                     Lod.
                     This Angelo, he would haue thee procure my olde vnckles absence from home this afternoone, by making him meete or pretending his meeting with his mistresse, and thy sweete heart Francischina.
                     
                  
                  
                     Aure.
                     Which if thou do'st Angelo, be sure of reward to thy wishes.
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     What talke you of reward sir? to the louing and dutifull seruant, 'tis a greater encouragement to his seruice to heare his master say, God a mercy Angelo, spie out Angelo, Ile thinke of thy paines one day Angelo, then all your base rewards and preferments: yet not to hinder your hand sir, I will extend mine to his seruice presently, and get your old vncle (Signior Lorenzo) out of the waies long enough I warrant you.
                  
                  
                     Lod.
                     Tis honestly said, which when thou hast performed, enforce vs

                     I will not faile sir, I was resolu'd to make him away afore they spake to me, in procuring his accesse to Francischina, for what is his presence at her house, but his absence at his ownes? and thus shall I with one trewell daube two walles,
(Enter Francisc.)
see how fitly shee meetes me. I will stand close heere as if it were in my shop of good fortune, & in respect of all ornamēts I can help her to, I will out of the fulnesse of my ioy, put her out of her studie and encounter her thus;
                           Hold vp the bracelets.
                         D'ee lacke gentlewoman, d'ee lacke: very fayre new gownes, kirtles, petticots, wrought smocks, bracelets, d'ee lacke gentlewoman, d'ee lacke?
                  
                  
                     Fran.
                     What means my loue by these strange salutations?
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Pre thee aske me no questions; hold take these bracelets, put vp this purse of gold quickly, and if thou wilt haue any of these things, I haue cried to thee, speake and tis performed.
                  
                  
                     Fran.
                     From whose treasury comes all this, I pre thee?
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     
                        Lorenzo, Lorenzo, a gentleman of much antiquitie, and one that for his loue hath burn'd hundreds of hearts to powder; yet now it fals out, that his tree of life is scorch't and blasted with the flames of thy beauty, readie to wither eternally, vnlesse it be speedily comforted with the sweete drops of thy nose.
                  
                  
                     Fran.
                     Gods my life, is that old squire so amorous?
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     You wrong him to terme him old, he can draw his bow, ride his horse, vse his sword, and traile his pike vnder Loues colours, as well as euer he did.
                  
                  
                     Fran.
                     I beleeue that easily.
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Well, go thy waies in and prepare to entertaine him now thy husband is from home, only with good words, and best kindnesses, making him put all into deeds till his treasury be deedlesse.
                  
                  
                     Fran.
                     You speake as if I had nothing to respect but his entertainment, when you know how close and timely it must be put in execution, considering with what enuious eyes my neighbours suruey mee.
                  
                  
                     
                     Ang.
                     Think'st thou, I consider not all this? he shall come in disguis'd, wench, and do thou deuise for our mirth, what ridiculous disguise he shall come in, and he shall assume it.
                  
                  
                     Fran.
                     What a magnifico of the Citie, and one of the Senate, thinkest thou he will not see into that inconuenience?
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     No more then no Senator, for in this case, my assurance is that Cupid will take the scarfe from his owne eyes, and hoodwinke the old buzzard, while two other true turtles enioy their happinesse: get thee in I beseech thee loue, tell thy gold, and say thy prayers.

Now for a farre fetch't deuice to fetch ouer my loue-squire.

                     Fran.
                     I see him within eare-shot; well may beauty inflame others, riches may tempt others; but for mee, mine eares and mine eyes, are proofe against all the Syrens, and Venusses, in all the seas of the world; beauty is a whore, riches a baud, and Ile trust none an you.

                     What ailes poore Angelo?
                     
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Nay mistresse Franke, if you proue disloyall once, farewell all constancy in women.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     How now man? what's the matter?
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     O Sir are you so neare? I shall trust your experience in women the better while I liue.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     I pre thee why so?
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Say true Sir, did you neuer sollicite your loue-sute to fayre mistresse Francischina?
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     Neuer I protest Angelo.
                     
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Vpon my life 'tis a strange thing; I would haue sworne all Italy, could not so sodainly haue fastned a fauour vpon her, I look't for a siege of Troy at least, to surprize the turrets of her continence; but to yeeld at the first sight of her assaylants colours, and before any Cannon was mounted afore her, 'tis one of the loosest parts of a modest woman that euer I heard of.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     How saist thou? did not I tell thee as much? beware of an old colt while you liue, he can tell when to strike I warrant you.
                  
                  
                     
                     Ang.
                     Women and fethers? now fie on that affinity.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     Alas Angelo, a feeble generation, soone ouercome God knowes, the honester minde, the sooner ouercome.
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Gods my life, what light huswife would yeeld at first to a stranger, and yet does this whirligig stand vpon termes of honour forsooth? tenders her reputation as the Apple of her eye; she has a ielous and a cutting husband, enuious neighbours, and will die many deathes rather then by any friends open accesse to her, be whip't naked with the tongues of scandall and slander; and a whole sanctuary of such ceremonies.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     O she does worthily in that Angelo, and like a woman of honour, thou hast painted her perfection in her faults thou find'st, and tickil'st me with her appetite.
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     And to auoid all sight of your entrance, you must needs come in some disguise she sayes; so much she tenders your high credit in the Citie, and her owne reputation, forsooth.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     How, come in some disguise?
                  
                  
                     Ang
                     A toy, a very toy which runnes in her head with such curious feete Sir, because if there be any resemblances of your person seene to enter her house, your whole substantiall selfe will be called in question; any other man she saies, might better aduenture with the least thing chang'd about 'em then you with all; as if you were the onely noted mutton-monger in all the Citie.
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Well Angelo, heauen forgiue vs the sinnes of our youth.
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     That's true Sir, but for a paltry disguise, being a magnifico, she shall goe snicke vp.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     Soft good Angelo, soft, let's think on't a little: what disguise would serue the turne saies shee?
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Faith, I know not what disguise shee would haue for you: shee would haue you come like a Calfe with a white face, I thinke, shee talkes of Tinkers,

pedlers, porters, chimney-sweepers, fooles and Physitians, such as haue free egresse and regresse into mens houses without suspicion.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     Out vpon 'em, would she haue me vndergoe the shame and hazard of one of those abiects?
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Yfaith I told her so, a squire of that worship, one of the Senate, a graue Iusticer, a man of wealth, a magnifico?
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     And yet by my troth, for the safegard of her honour, I would doe much; me thinks a Friers weede were nothing.
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Out vppon't, that disguise is worne thread bare vpon euery stage, and so much villany committed vnder that habit; that 'tis growne as supicious as the vilest. If you will hearken to any, take such a transformance, as you may be sure will keepe you from discouery: for though it be the stale refuge of miserable Poets, by change of a hat or a cloake, to alter the whole state of a Comedie, so as the father must not know his owne child forsooth, nor the wife her husband, yet you must not thinke they doe it earnest to carry it away so: for say you were stuffed into a motley coate, crowded in the case of a base Violl, or buttond vp in a cloakbag, euen to your chinne, yet if I see your face, I am able to say this is signior Lorenzo, and therefore vnlesse your disguise be such that your face may beare as great a part in it as the rest, the rest is nothing.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     Good reason, in faith Angelo; and what, shall I then smurch my face like a chimney sweeper, & weare the rest of his smokinesse?
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Ile tell you sir, if you be so mad to condescend to the humour of a foolish woman, by consideration that Ioue for his loue tooke on him the shape of a Bull, which is farre worse then a chimney sweeper, I can fit you rarely.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     As how I pre thee?
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     There is one little snaile you know, an old chimney sweeper.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     What, hee that sings, Maids in your smocks, hold

open your locks, fluds.
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     The very same sir, whose person (I borrowing his words) you will so liuely resemble, that himselfe in person cannot detect you.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     But is that a fit resemblance to please a louer Angelo?
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     For that sir, she is prouided: for you shall no sooner enter but off goes your rustie skabberd, sweete water is readie to scoure your filthy face, milk, & a bath of fernebraks for your fustie bodie, a chamber perfum'd, a wrought shirt, night cap, and her husbands gowne, a banquet of Oysters pyes, Potatoes, Skirret rootes, Eringes, and diuers other whetstones of venery.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     O let me hugge thee Angelo.
                     
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     A bed as sost as her hayre, sheets as delicate as her skinne, and as sweete as her breath, pillowes imitating her breasts, and her breasts to boote, Hypocras in her cups, and Nectar in her lips, Ah, the gods haue bene beasts for lesse felicitie.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     No more good Angelo, no more, how shall I requite the happinesse thou wilt bring me too? haste any mind of marriage?
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Not much sir, but an extraordinary wife might tempt me.
                  
                  
                     Lor.
                     By my troth and she were not promist, thou shouldest haue my daughter: but come lets to our disguise, in which I long to be singing.
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Ile folow you presently.

                     Ang.
                     Why sir, I am prouiding meanes to leade your old vncle out ath'way, as you will'd me, by drawing him into the way of Quintilianoes wife, my sweet heart, and so make roome for him by Quintilianoes roome: you that lead him any way, must needes seeke him out and employ him to some tauerne.

                     He will be with me presently Angelo, and here's a freshman come from Padua, whom I will powder with his acquaintance, and so make him an excellent morsell to rellish his carouses.

                     Goe to Sir, by this light you'll be complain'd on, there cannot be a foole within twenty mile of your head, but you engrosse him for your owne mirth: Noble-mens tables cannot be seru'd for you.

                     Alas Sir, pray let this be the day: consider my charge. I haue many children, and this my poore child here whom I haue brought vp at schoole, must loose all I haue bestowed on him hitherto, if I pay not his Master presen

                     Marry sir, as bona Mulier is said to be false Latin, because though bona be good, Mulier is naught; so to say my father is an honest Taylor, is false English; for though my father be honest, yet the Taylor is a theefe.
                  
                  
                     Quint.

I am still of as good credit in my Parish as he too.

                     S'blood Rascall, as good credit as I?

                     Quint.
                     Let me alone; Ile not strike him by this hand, why hearke yee Rogue: put your credit in ballance with mine? do'st thou keepe this company? here's Signior Lodouico, one of the Clarissimi, a man of worship: here's a Gentleman of Padua, a man of rare parts, 
                           •
                        n excellent scholler, a fine Ciceronian.

                     And here's my Lieftenant, I hope thou know'st the Worshipfull man his father with the blew beard, and all these are my companions; and dare you a barbarous slaue, a squirting companion, compare with me? but here's the point; now behold and see: Signior Giouenelle, lend me foure or fiue pounds, let it be fiue pounds, if you haue so much about you.

                     Quint.
                     Very good, now Cutbeard, are you a slanderous cut-throat or no? will thy credit doe this now? without scrip or scrowle. But thou wilt thinke this is done for a colour now; doe you not lend it me simply?
                  
                  
                     Giou.
                     What a question's that?
                  
                  
                     Quint.
                     For how long?
                  
                  
                     Giou.
                     At your pleasure Captaine.
                  
                  
                     Quint.
                     Why so, here you poling Rascall, here's two crownes out of this money: now I hope wilt beleeue 'tis mine, now the property is altered.
                  
                  
                     Cut.
                     Why you might a done this before then.
                  
                  
                     Quint.
                     No Cutbeard, I haue beene burnd ith' hand for that, Ile pay n'ere a knaue an yee all money, but in the presence of such honest Gentleman that can witnesse it; of my conscience I haue paid it thee halfe a dozen times; goe to sir be gone.

                     Fare yee well sir.
                  
                  
                     Quint.
                     Thanke you Signior Giouenelle; though y'are sure of this money againe at my hands, yet take heede how this same Lodouico get it from you, he's a great sharker; but th'ast no more money about thee hast thou?
                  
                  
                     Giou.
                     Not a doit, by this candle.
                  
                  
                     Quint.
                     All the better, for hee'd cheat thee on't, if thou had'st euer so much, therefore when thou com'st to Padua, ply thy booke and take good courses, and 'tis not this againe shall serue thy turne at my handes, I sweare to thee.

                     Signior Lodouico, adiew.
                  
                  
                     Lod.
                     Not so sir, we will not part yet, a carouse or two me thinks is very necessary betwixt vs.
                  
                  
                     Quint.
                     With all my heart Boy, into the Emperours head here.
                  
                  
                     Lod.
                     Content.
                  
                  Exeunt,
               
               Actus secundi Finis.
            
            
               Actus Tertius.
               Lodouico, Angelo.
               
                  Ang.
                  
                     SAy Sir, haue you plaid the man and hous'd the Captaine?
               
               
                  Lod.
                  I haue hous'd and lodg'd him in the Emperours head Tauerne, and there I haue left him glorified with his two guls, so that presume of what thou wilt at his house, for he is out of the way by this time both waies.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  T'is very well handled sir, and presume you & your friend my master Aurelio of what may satisfie you at your

vncles, for he is now going out of the way, and out of himselfe also: I haue so besmeard him with a chimney sweepers resemblance, as neuer was poore Snaile, whose counterfaite he triumphes in, neuer thinking I haue daubd his face sufficient, but is at his glasse as curiously busied to beautifie his face (for as of Moo'rs so of chimney sweepers) the blackest is most beautifull as any Lady to paint her lips.
               
               
                  Lod.
                  Thou art a notable villaine.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  I am the fitter for your imployment Sir: stand close I beseech you, & when I bring him into the streets, encounter and bayte him in stead of Snayle, but in any case let none else know it.
               
               
                  Lod.
                  Not for the world.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  If you should tell it to one, so you charge him to say nothing, 'twere nothing, and so if one by one to it play holy water frog with twentie, you know any secret is kept sufficiently; and in this, we shall haue the better sport at a Beare baiting, fare ye well Sir.
               
               Enter Honorio and Gasparo.
               
                  Hon.
                  SIgnior Lodonico good euen to you.
               
               
                  Lod.
                  The like to Signior Honorio, and harke you Sir, I must be bound with my vncle Lorenzo, and tell you a pleasant secrete of him, so in no sort you will vtter it.
               
               
                  Hon.
                  In no sort as I am a Gentleman.
               
               
                  Lod.
                  Why Sir hee is to walke the streets presently in the likenesse of Snayle the chimney sweeper, and with his crie.
               
               
                  Hon.
                  What is hee Sir? to what end I beseech you Sir wil hee disfigure himselfe so?
               
               
                  Lod.
                  Yfaith Sir I take it for some matter of pollicy, that concernes towne gouernment.
               
               
                  Hon.
                  Towne-bull gouernment, do you not meane so Sir?
               
               
                  Lon.
                  O no Sir, but for the generall businesse of the Citie I take it.
               
               
                  
                  Hon.
                  Well sir well we will not examine it too farre, but gesse at it.
               
               
                  Lod.
                  So sir when he comes forth do you take one corner to encounter him as I will doe another, and taking him for Snayle, imagine hee went about stealing of Citie venison, (though he do not,) and make what sport you thinke good with him, alwaies prouided it be cleanly, and that he may still thinke he goes inuisible.
               
               
                  Hon.
                  I warraut yee Signior Lodouico, and thanke you hartily for this good cause of our honest recreation.
               
               
                  Lod.
                  Scarce honest neither sir, but much good do it you, as it is,
               
               
                  Hon.
                  O that my sonne, your friend Aurelio, were heere to helpe to candy this ieast a little.
               
               
                  Lod.
                  Alas sir, his sicke stomacke can abide no sweete meates, hee's all for aye me, wee'll make the Ieast rellish well enough I warrant you: Lorenzo my vncle an old Senator, one that has read Marcus Aurelius, Gesta Romanorum, the Mirror of Magistrates, &c. to be led by the nose like a blind Beare that has read nothing. Let my man reade how hee deserues to be bayted.
               
               
                  Hon.
                  'Tis a pretty wonder yfaith Signior Lodouico.
                  
               
               
                  Lod.
                  Slife, 'twere a good deed, to get boyes to pinne cards at his backe, hang squibs at his tayle, ring him through the towne with basons, besnowball him with rotten egges, and make him asham'de of the Commission before hee scale it.
               
               
                  Gasp.
                  What saies Signior Lodouico, I beseech you sir? me thinkes his pleasant disposition should intend some waggerie.
               
               
                  Hon.
                  I will tell you Signior Gasparo, but in any case you must say nothing.
               
               
                  Gasp.
                  In no case will I say any thing sir.
               
               
                  Hon.
                  Then this is the case: Signior Lorenzo (your probable father in law) in the case of Snayle the chimney sweeper, will straight tread the streets for his pleasure.

This is the backe gate to Honorios house, which shall be Aurelios, if God giue him grace to weepe for his fathers death in time. And in this garden, if I could see the chaste Lucresse, or the affable mistresse Temperance, I might (thus wrapt in my cloake) steale a little courtship through the chinke of a pale. But indeed I thinke it safer to sit closer, and so to cloud the summe of my visnomy, that no eye discerne it.

So be it, thats my resolution. Now to my contemplation, this is no Pandarisme, is it?

No, for there is neither money nor credit propos'd or expected, and besides there is no vnlawfull act intended, no not this same lasciua actio animi: I thinke for his part, much lesse hers: go to, let me do my kinswoman, and her sex right, sit at rest with me then reputation, and conscience, fall asleepe with the world, but this same idle attendance is the spite of it, Idlenesse is accounted with other men a sinne, to me 'tis a penance, I was begot in a stirring season, for now hath my soule a thousand fancies in an instant, as what wench dreams on when she lies on her backe, when one hen layes an egge and another sits it, whether that hen shall mother that chicken? If my bull leape your cow, is not the calfe yours? yes no doubt, for Aedificium cedit solo saies the Lawyer: and then to close all comes in a sentence, Non omnia possumus omnes: for some are borne to riches, others to verses, some to be bachelers, others to be cuckolds, some to get crownes, and others to spend'm, some to get children, and others to keepe'em: and all this is but idlenesse, would to God I had some scuruy poeme about me to laugh at,

And Pythagoras holds opinion, that a witch turnes to a wild Cat, as an old Ostler turnes to an ambling nagge.

together, and so I cashier him; let the scholler report at Padua, that Venice has other manner of learning belongs to it: what does his Continuum & Contiguum here? let'em goe to the Inke pot and beware of the wine pot.

                  He tooke her by (strike vp fidlers) the lilly white hand and he laid her vpon the bedde. Oh what a spirit haue I now? I long to meete a Sergeant in this humor, I would but haue one whiffe at one of these same peuter button'd shoulder-clappers, to trie whether this chopping knife or their pestels were the better weapons. Here's a blade Boy, it was the old Dukes first predecessors; Ile tell thee what Lieftenant, this sword has dubd more Knights then thy knife has opened Oysters.

                  S'fut she's an Asse, honour wooes me, preferment cals me, and I must lye pampred in a wenches lap, because shee dotes on me. Honour saies no, Lieftenant, Pugna pro patria, we must too't yfaith and seeke our portion amongst the scratcht faces.

                  Good Captaine pardon him, since he has done nothing but swept your chimney worse then my Mistris would haue it swept, he will doe it better another time.
               
               
                  Quint.
                  Well Snaile, at this Gentlemans request, (to whom I can denie nothing) I release you for this once, but let me take you no more thus I aduise you.

                  Depresse the equall comforts it retaines;
                  For since it finds a firme consent in both,
                  And both our births and yeares agree so well,
                  If both our aged parents should refuse,
                  For any common obiect of the world,
                  To giue their hands to ours, let vs resolue
                  To liue together like our liues and soules.

                  I am resolu'd my loue; and yet alas,

                     Preferre the motion to them; we may loue
                  Without their knowledge and the skill of any,
                  Saue only of my true friend Lodowicke.

                  What reason haue you to curse them? has not one of them kept you safe from the shame of the world, as much as a poore disguise might doe; but when your ridiculous feares will cast it off, euen while it is on, so running through the streets, that they rise all in an vprore after you▪ alas what is the poore disguise to blame sir?

                  How now? whom doe I see? my daughter and a yonker together? passion of death, hell and damnation, what lecherous capricorne raignes this vnhappy day? old and yong in a predicament? O fie of filthy sinne and concupiscence, I will conceale my rage a while that it may breake forth in fury; Ile shift me presently Angelo, and goe fetch the Prouost.

                  Talke not to me, out vpon this abhominable concupiscence, the pride of the flesh, this witchcraft of the Diuell: talke not to me, iustice cries out an't in the streets, and I will see it punish't, come good Angelo to helpe to shift me.

                  Inno.
                  Shall we Captaine, bith masse then lets neuer haue other company in deed.
               
               
                  Quint.
                  Why now th'art wise, and hast a minde transform'd with maine right, and to confirme thee, I will compare the noble seruice of a feast with the honourable seruice of the field, and then put on thy hand to which thou wilt.
               
               
                  Inno.
                  Thanke you good Captaine, but do you thinke that warre is naught sir?
               
               
                  Quint.
                  Exceeding naught.
               
               
                  Inno.
                  Why then sir take heede what you say, for 'tis dangerous speaking against any thing that is naught, I can tell you.
               
               
                  Quint.
                  Thou saist wisely Lieutenant, I will not then vse the word naught, nor speake ill of eyther, but compare them both, and choose the better.
               
               
                  Inno.
                  Take heede then good Captaine, there be some prickecar'd in elligencers conuaid into some wall or other about vs.
               
               
                  Quint.
                  If there were I care not, for to say true, the first modell of a battell was taken from a banquet. And first touching the offices of both: for the generall of the field, there is the master of the feast, for the Lieutenant Generall, the mistresse, for the Sergeant Maior, the Steward, for the Gentleman vsher, the Marshall, for master oth' Ordinance the Sewer, and all other officers.
               
               
                  Inno.
                  Yet y'are reasonable well Captaine.
               
               
                  Quint.
                  Then for the preparation, as in a field is all kinde of artillery, your Cannon, your Demicannon, Culuerings, falkons, Sacres, minions, & such goodly ornaments of a field, I speake no hurt of em thou seest, Ile haue nothing to do do with 'am.
               
               
                  Inno.
                  Hold you still there Captaine.
               
               
                  Quint.
                  Besides other munition of powder and shot, and so for

the feast, you haue your Court, cubbords planted with flagons, cannes, cups, beakers, bowles, goblets, basens and ewers: And more glorious shew I wisse then the tother, and yet I speake no hurt of the other.
               
               
                  Inno.
                  No Ile be sworne Captaine.
               
               
                  Quint.
                  Besides your munition of manchet, napery plats, spoons, glasses and so forth; Then for your kitchen artilieri
                        •
                     , there shall you see all your brasse peeces mounted in order, as your beefe-pots, your chaldrons, your kettles, chafingdishes, ladies, spits, a more edifying spectacle then your Cannon & Culuering, and yet I speake no hurt of them neither.
               
               
                  Inno.
                  No Captaine, thus farre, I goe wee.
               
               
                  Quint.
                  Then sir, as in the field the drumme, so to the feast the dresser giues the Alarme, Ran tan tara, tan tan tantara tan.
               
               
                  Inno.
                  O how it stirres my stomacke?
               
               
                  Quint.
                  First then sets forward a wing of light horse, as sallads, brothes, sauces, flew'd meats, and other kickshores▪ and they giue a charge, then do the battell ioyne Captaine Capon in white-brith, Lieutenant calues head.
               
               
                  Inno.
                  Thats my place.
               
               
                  Quint.
                  Ancient Surloigne, a man of a goodly presence, and full of expectation, as you ancient ought to bee, then haue you Sergeant Piemeat, Corporall Conny, Lanceprizado Larke, Gentlemen, Panbakex, & all the species of a company.
               
               
                  Inno.
                  Would we might fall to the fight once.
               
               
                  Quint.
                  Why now growes the fight hot man, now shall you see many a tall piece of beefe, many a tough capon go downe, and hee'rs the triall of a mans stomacke, all the while the Artillery playes on both hands, the Canons lay about them, the flagons go off, thicke and threefold, and many a tall man goes halting off, some quite ouerthrowne both horse and foote.
               
               
                  Inno.
                  O my heart bleeds.
               
               
                  Quint.
                  That is, thy teeth water. In conclusion, as the remnant of the feast, (I meane such dishes as scap't the fury of the fight) if they be seruiceable, are reseru'd to furnish out another day if they be maim'd or spoyld, they are sent abroad to relieue prisons and hospitals. So the remainder of the fight, if they be seruiceable, they are reseru'd to supply a second field, for the

fragments of the fight, viz. the maimd soldiers, they are sent likewise to furnish prisons and hospitals, how sayest thou now Lieutenant, shall we to the feast, or to the fight?
               
               
                  Inn.
                  No fighting good Captain, to the feast for Gods sake.
               
               
                  Quint.
                  Tha'rt a my mind right, and so will we presently march on to the sacke of the Emperours head, then to the May-night feast, and shew at Signior Honorios, and there will be a wench there boy, a delicate yong morsell, a kinswoman of Signior Honorios, and her fathers only child, he a mighty rich Clarissimo, and her shalt thou court, winne her and weare her, thou hast wit at will.
               
               
                  Inno.
                  But shall that wench be her fathers sonne and heire Captaine?
               
               
                  Quint.
                  Shee shall be his heire, a mine honesty.
               
               
                  Innoc.
                  But shall not my Mistris your wife bee at that show?
               
               
                  Quint.
                  Shee shall, and we could finde her; Fannio has beene abroade this houre to seeke her: the Asse is stept into some corner or other mourning for my absence.

                  S'life, the hungry knaue her squire, could not hold in the open streets.

                  The Doxie was muffeld in her cloake, I had but a glimpse of her; but s'light I will know her, shee passes not so, come wee'll follow. Ile beate the Rogue and take away's whore from him.

                  How vnhappily did we misse 'em? they slipt into some vaulting house, I hold my life.

                  Quint.
                  Twenty to one shee is some honest mans wife of the Parish that steales abroade for a trimming, while he sits secure at home, little knowing, God knowes, what hangs ouer his head; the poore Cuckold esteeming her the most vertuous wife in the world. And shoude one tell him, he had seene her drest like a Page following a knaue thus, Ile lay my life he would not beleeue it.
               
               
                  Innoc.
                  Why no Captaine, wiues take all the faith from their husbands. And that makes 'em doe so many good workes as they doe.

                  Full butt into Lorenzoes house, and if thou knewst him, thou know'st wherefore, an ill-fauourd trimming is her errand.
               
               
                  Fann.
                  'Tis very well, shee trims my Captaine prettily, in the

meane time his head paies for all, and yet alas poore hornestocke, he thinks her to haue no fault, but her too much dotage vpon him, well my conscience will not let me keepe her counsaile, he shall know on't.
               
               
                  Giac.
                  Why man if both of vs should tell him her fault he will not beleeue vs.
               
               
                  Fann.
                  No, nor if he had seene it with his owne owne eyes I thinke, I shal neuer forget how the profound Cockatrice hung on his sleeue to day, and he shoude not from her sight, shee'd follow him into the warres, one day should make an end of both their loues and liues, and then to see him the wittall, my Captaine began to stroote, and batle the pride of his merits that so heightned her affection.
               
               
                  Giac.
                  True, and how the foppasty his Lieftenant, stept in to perswade with her, to take it patiently, for friends must part, we came not all together, and we must not goe all together.
               
               
                  Fann.
                  Well, 'twill not be for any man to follow him, if this were knowne once.
               
               
                  Giac.
                  Lord how all the boyes in the towne would flocke about him as he walks the streets, as 'twere about a bagge-pipe, and hoote the poore Cuckold out of his hornecase.
               
               
                  Fann.
                  Well, and I were worthy to giue him counsaile, he should e'ne faire and well hang himselfe.
               
               
                  Giac.
                  No, no, keepe it from him, and say thou found'st her at a womans labour.
               
               
                  Fann.
                  A plague of her labour, the Captaines browes sweate while shee labours.

(A plague vpon her gingerly) till shee lockt me into Lucretias chamber, where Lucretia lying asleepe on her bed, I thought it rudenesse to wake her; and (imagining when shee wak't shee had something to say to me) attended her leasure at my ease, and lay downe softly by her; when (hauing chaster and simpler thoughts then Leonoro imagines) because he measures my wast by his owne) in the very coldnesse and dulnesse of my spirit, I fell sodainly a-sleepe. In which my fancy presented me with the strangest dreame, that euer yet possest me.
