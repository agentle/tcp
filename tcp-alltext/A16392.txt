And how Noe dyuyded the worlde in thre partyes to his thre ſones. Alſo there ben ſhewed the .ix. colours in armes figuryd by the .ix. orders of angels. And it is ſhewed by the forſayde colours whyche ben worthy and whyche ben ryall, And of rigalytees whyche be noble and whyche ben excellent. Alſo ben ſhewed here the vertues of chyualry and many other notable and famous thynges to ye playſure of noble perſones ſhall be ſhewed as the werkes folowynge wytneſſen who ſome euer lyketh to ſe theym and rede theym: whyche were to longe now to reherce. And after thyſe notable thynges aforſayd foloweth the blaſynge of all manere armys in latyn: frenſſhe: and englyſſhe.
            
            ¶Incipit liber armorum.
            
               BEynge in worthyneſſe armes for to beere by the ryall blood in ordynaunce all noble & gentylmen from the hygheſt degree to the loweſt in this boke ſhall be ſhewed / & to deſeuere gentylneſſe from vngentylneſſe / In ſoo moche that all gentylneſſe comyth of god of heuen. At heuen I woll begyn̄e where were .x. orders of angelles: and now ſtonde but .ix. in cote armures of knowlege encrowned full hye wyth precyous ſtones: where Lucyfer wyth myllyons of angels out of heuen fell vnto hell & other places / & ben holde there in bondage. And all were creatyd in heuen of gentill nature. A bonde man or a churle woll ſaye all we ben comen of Adam / Soo Lucyfer wyth his company maye ſaye all we ben comen of heuen. ¶Adam the begynnynge of mankynde was as a ſtocke vnſprayed & vnfloriſſhyd. & in the braunches is knowlege whiche is totyn & whiche is grene.
            
               ¶How gentylmen ſhall be knowen from churles: & how they fyrſte began. And how Noe dyuyded the worde in thre partyes to his thre ſones.
               
                  ¶Now for to dyuyde gentylmen fro churles in haſte it ſhall be preuyd. ¶There was neuer gentylman nor churle ordenyd bikinde but he had fader & moder. Adam & Eue had nother fader nor moder. And in the ſones of Adam & Eue were founde both gentylman and churle. By the ſones of Adam and Eue: Seth Abell and Cayn dyuyded was the ryall blode fro the vngentyl A brother to ſlee his brother contrari to the lawe: where myghte be more vngentylneſſe. By that dyde Cayn̄ become a churle and alle his ofſprynge after hym by the curſynge of god and his owne fader Adam. And Seth was made a gentylman thorugh his fader and moders bleſſynge. And of the ofſprynge of Seth Noe came a gentylman by kynde.
               ¶Noe had thre ſones begoten by kynde. Bi the moder tweyne were namyd Cham and Sem. And by the fader the thirde was namyd Iafeth. Yet in thyſe thre ſones gentylneſſe & vngentylneſſe was founde. ¶In Cham vngentylneſſe was founde to his owne fader doon̄ to dyſcouer his preuytees and laughyng his fader to ſcorne. ¶Iafeth was the yongeſt and repreuid his broder. Thenne lyke a gentylman take mynde of Cham: For his vngentylnes he was become a churle: and had the curſyng of god and his fader Noe. And whan Noe awoke he ſayde to Cham his ſone: Knoweſt not yu how it became of Cayn Adams ſone: and of his churlyſſhe blood. All the worlde is drowned ſaue we eyghte / And now of the to begyn vngentylneſſe & a cauſe to dyſtroye vs all: vpon the it ſhall be. and ſo I praye to god that it ſhall falle / Now to the I geue my curſe wyckyd caytyf for euer. & I gyue to the ye Northe parte of the worlde to draw thyn Inhabytacōn / For there ſhall it be: where ſorowe and care colde & myſcheyf as a churle thou ſhalt haue in the thyrde parte of the worlde: Vhiche ſhall be callyd Europa. That is to ſay the countree of churles.
               ¶Iafeth come hyther my ſone thou ſhalt haue my bleſſynge dere in ſtede of Seth Adams ſone I make the a gentylman. to the weſte parte of the worlde: and to the Occydent ende where as welthe & grace ſhall be: there thyn habitacōn ſhall be: to take that other thyrde parte of the worlde whiche ſhalbe callyd Alia That is to ſaye: the countree of gentylmen.
               ¶And Sem my ſone alſo a gentylman I ye make to multyplye

Abellys blood that ſo wickydly was ſlayn. Thorient thou ſhalt take that other thyrde parte of the worlde: whyche ſhall be callyd Affrica: That is to ſaye the countree of temperaunce.
               ¶Of the ofſpringe of the gentyll Iafeth came Abraham: Moyſes: Aaron: & the prophetes. and alſo the kynge of the ryght lyne of Mary / of whom that gentyll Iheſus was born̄ very god & man after his manhede kynge of the londe of Iude & of Iewes gentylman by his moder Mary prynce of Cote armure.
            
            
               ¶How longe cote armures were begonne afore the Incarnacōn of our lorde Iheſu Cryſte.

            SAlamon in his parablys ſayth that a good ſpyryte makyth a flourynge aege / that is a fayre aege & a longe. And ſyth it is ſoo: I aſke this queſtyon / . whiche ben the meanes & the cauſes that enduce a man in to a mery ſpyryte: Truly to my beſte dyſcrecōn it ſemeth good dyſportes & honeſt gamys in whom a man Ioyeth wythout ony repentaunce after. Thenne folowyth it yt gode dyſportes & honeſt games ben cauſe of mannys fayr aege & longe life. And therfore now woll I choſe of foure good diſportes & honeſte gamys / that is to wyte: of huntynge: hawkynge: fyſſhynge: & foulynge. The beſte to my ſymple dyſcrecōn whyche is fyſſhynge: callyd Anglynge wyth a rodde: and a lyne

and an hoke / And therof to treate as my ſymple wytte may ſuffyce: both for the ſayd reaſon of Salamon and alſo for the reaſon that phiſyk makyth in this wyſe (¶Si tibi deficiant medici medici tibi fiant: Hec tria mens leta labor & moderata dieta.
            ¶Ye ſhall vnderſtonde that this is for to ſaye / Yf a man lacke leche or medicyne he ſhall make thre thynges his leche & medycyne: and he ſhall nede neuer no moo. The fyrſte of theym is a mery thought. The ſeconde is labour not outrageoꝰ. The thyrde is dyete meſurable. Fyrſte that yf a man wyll euer more be in mery thoughtes and haue a gladde ſpyryte: he muſt eſchewe all contraryous company & all places of debate where he myghte haue ony occaſyons of malencoly. And yf he woll haue a labour not outrageous he muſt thenne ordeyne him to his her tys eaſe and pleaſaunce wythout ſtudye penſyfneſſe or traueyle a mery occupacyon whyche maye reioyce his herte: & in whyche his ſpyrytes may haue a mery delyte. And yf he woll be dyetyd meſurably he muſt eſchewe all places of ryotte whyche is cauſe of ſurfette and of ſykneſſe / And he muſt drawe him to places of ſwete ayre and hungry: And ete nouriſhable meetes and dyffyable alſo.
            
               NOw thenne woll I dyſcryue the ſayd dyſportes and gamys to fynde the beſte of theym as veryly as I can̄ / alle be it that the ryght noble and full worthy prynce the duke of Yorke late callid mayſter of game hath diſcryued the myrthes of huntynge lyke as I thynke to dyſcryue of it and of alle the other. For huntynge as to mynentent is to laboryous / For the hunter muſt alwaye renne & folowe his houndes: traueyllynge & ſwetynge full ſore. He blowyth tyll his lyppes blyſter And whan he wenyth it be an hare full oft it is an hegge hogge Thus he chaſyth and wote not what. He comyth home at euyn rayn beten pryckyd: and his clothes torne wete ſhode all myry Some hounde loſte: ſome ſurbat. Suche greues & many other hapyth vnto the hunter / whyche for dyſpleyſaunce of theym yt loue it I dare not reporte. Thus truly me ſemyth that this is not the beſte dyſporte and game of the ſayd foure. The dyſporte and game of hawkynge is laboryous & noyouſe alſo as me ſemyth. For often the fawkener leſeth his hawkes as the hunter

his hoūdes. Thenne is his game & his dyſporte goon. Full often cryeth he & whyſtelyth tyll that he be ryght euyll a thurſte. His hawke taketh a bowe and lyſte not ones on hym rewarde. whan he wolde haue her for to flee: thenne woll ſhe bathe. with mys fedynge ſhe ſhall haue the Fronſe: the Rye: the Cray and many other ſykneſſes that brynge theym to the Sowſe. Thus by prouff this is not the beſte dyſporte & game of the ſayd foure. The dyſporte & game of fowlynge me ſemyth mooſt ſymple For in the wynter ſeaſon the fowler ſpedyth not but in the mooſt hardeſt and coldeſt weder: whyche is greuous. For whan he wolde goo to his gynnes he maye not for colde. Many a gynne & many a ſnare he makyth. Yet ſoryly dooth he fare. At morn tyde in the dewe he is weete ſhode vnto his taylle. Many other ſuche I cowde tell: but drede of magre makith me for to leue. Thus me ſemyth that huntynge & hawkynge & alſo fowlynge ben ſo laborous and greuous that none of theym maye perfourme nor bi very meane that enduce a man to a mery ſp

                  be of Salamon. ¶Dowteles then̄e folowyth it that it muſt nedes be the dyſporte of fyſſhynge wyth an angle. For all other manere of fyſſhyng is alſo laborous & greuous: often makynge folkes ful wete & colde / whyche many tymes hath be ſeen cauſe of grece Infirmytees. But the angler maye haue no colde nor no dyſeaſe nor angre / but yf he be cauſer hymſelf. For he maye not leſe at the mooſt but a lyne or an hoke: of whyche he maye haue ſtore plentee of his owne makynge / as this ſymple treatyſe ſhall teche hym. Soo thenne his loſſe is not greuous. and other greyffes maye he not haue / ſauynge but yf ony fiſſhe breke away after that he is take on the hoke / or elles that he catche nought: whyche ben not greuous. For yf he faylle of one he maye not faylle of a nother / yf he dooth as this treatyſe techyth: but yf there be nought in the water. And yet atte the leeſt he hath his holſom walke and mery at his eaſe. a ſwete ayre of the ſwete ſauoure of the meede floures: that makyth hym hungry. He hereth the melodyous armony of fowles. He ſeeth the yonge ſwannes: heerons: duckes: cotes and many other foules wyth theyr brodes. / whyche me ſemyth better than alle the

noyſe of houndys: the blaſtes of hornys and the ſcrye of foulis that hunters: fawkeners & foulers can make. And yf the angler take fyſſhe: ſurely thenne is there noo man merier than he is in his ſpyryte. ¶Alſo who ſoo woll vſe the game of anglynge: he muſt ryſe erly. whiche thyng is prouffytable to man in this wyte / That is to wyte: mooſt to the heele of his ſoule. For it ſhall cauſe hym to be holy. and to the heele of his body / For it ſhall cauſe hym to be hole. Alſo to the encreaſe of his goodys. For it ſhall make hym ryche. As the olde englyſſhe prouerbe ſayth in this wyſe. ¶who ſoo woll ryſe erly ſhall be holy helthy & zely.
               ¶Thus haue I prouyd in myn entent that the dyſporte & game of anglynge is the very meane & cauſe that enducith a man in to a mery ſpyryte: Whyche after the ſayde parable of Salomon & the ſayd doctryne of phiſyk makyth a flourynge aege & a longe. And therfore to al you that ben vertuous: gentyll: and free borne I wryte & make this ſymple treatyſe folowynge: by whyche ye may haue the full crafte of anglynge to dyſport you at your luſte: to the entent that your aege maye the more floure and the more lenger to endure.

And hete the ſharpe ende in a charcole fyre tyll it be whyte: and brenne the ſtaffe therwyth thorugh: euer ſtreyte in the pythe at bothe endes tyll they mete. And after that brenne hym in the nether ende wyth a byrde broche / & wyth other broches eche gretter than other. & euer the gretteſt the laſte: ſo that ye make your hole aye tapre wexe. Thenne lete hym lye ſtyll and kele two dayes. Vnfrette hym then̄e and lete hym drye in an hous roof in the ſmoke tyll he be thrugh drye ¶In the ſame ſeaſon take a fayr yerde of grene haſyll & beth hym euyn & ſtreyghte. and lete it drye with the ſtaffe. And whan they ben drye make the yerde mete vnto the hole in the ſtaffe: vnto halfe the length of the ſtaffe. And to perfourme that other halfe of the croppe. Take a fayr ſhote of blacke thorn̄: crabbe tree: medeler. or of Ienypre kytte in the ſame ſeaſon: and well bethyd & ſtreyghte. And frette theym togyder fetely: ſoo that the croppe maye iuſtly entre all in to the ſayd hole. Thenne ſhaue your ſtaffe & make hym tapre wexe. Thenne vyrell the ſtaffe at bothe endes wyth longe hopis of yren or laton in the clenneſt wiſe wyth a pyke in the nether ende faſtnyd wyth a rennynge vyce: to take in & oute youre croppe. Thenne ſet your croppe an handfull within the ouer ende of your ſtaffe in ſuche wiſe that it be as bigge there as in ony other place aboue. Then̄e arme your croppe at thouer ende downe to ye frette wyth a lyne of .vj. heeres. And dubbe the lyne and frette it faſt in ye toppe wyth a bowe to faſten on your lyne. And thus ſhall ye make you a rodde ſoo preuy that ye maye walke therwyth: and there ſhall noo man wyte where abowte ye goo. It woll be lyghte & full nymbyll to fyſſhe wyth at your luſte.

               NOw I haue lernyd you to make all your harnays. Here I woll tell you how ye ſhall angle. ¶Ye ſhall angle: vnderſtonde that there is .vj. manere of anglyng. That one is at the grounde for the troughte and other fiſſhe. A nother is at ye grounde at an arche / or at a ſtange where it ebbyth and flowyth: for bleke: roche. and darſe. The thyrde is wyth a flote for all manere of fyſſhe. The fourth wyth a menow for ye troughte wythout plumbe or flote. The fyfth is rennynge in ye ſame wyſe for roche and darſe wyth one or two heeres & a flye. The ſyxte is wyth a dubbyd hoke for the troughte & graylyng ¶And for the fyrſte and pryncypall poynt in anglynge: kepe ye euer fro the water fro the ſighte of the fyſſhe: other ferre on the londe: or ellys behynde a buſſhe that the fyſſhe ſe you not. For yf they doo they wol not byte. ¶Alſo loke that ye ſhadow not the water as moche as ye may. For it is that thynge that woll ſoone fraye the fyſſhe. And yf a fyſſhe be afrayed he woll not bite longe after. For alle manere fyſſhe that fede by the grounde ye ſhall angle for theim to the botom. ſoo that your hokys ſhall renne or lye on the grounde. And for alle other fyſſhe that fede

aboue ye ſhall angle to theym in the myddes of the water or ſomdeale byneth or ſomdeale aboue. For euer the gretter fiſſhe the nerer he lyeth the botom of the water. And euer the ſmaller fyſſhe the more he ſmymmyth aboue. ¶The thyrde good poynt is whan the fyſſhe bytyth that ye be not to haſty to ſmyte nor to late / For ye muſt abide tyll ye ſuppoſe that the bayte be ferre in the mouth of the fyſſhe / and thenne abyde noo longer. And this is for the groūde. ¶And for the flote whan ye ſe it pullyd ſoftly vnder the water: or elles caryed vpon the water ſoftly: thenne ſmyte. And loke that ye neuer ouerſmyte the ſtrengthe of your lyne for brekynge. ¶And yf it fortune you to ſmyte a grete fyſſhe wyth a ſmalle harnays: thenne ye muſt lede hym in the water and labour him there tyll he be drownyd and ouercome. Thenne take hym as well as ye can or maye. and euer bewaar that ye holde not ouer the ſtrengthe of your lyne. And as moche as ye may lete hym not come out of your lynes ende ſtreyghte from you: But kepe hym euer vnder the rodde / and euermore holde hym ſtreyghte: ſoo that your lyne may ſuſteyne and beere his lepys and his plungys wyth the helpe of your croppe & of your honde.
            
            
               HEre I woll declare vnto you in what place of the water ye ſhall angle. Ye ſhall angle in a pole or in a ſtondinge water in euery place where it is ony thynge depe. There is not grete choyſe of ony places where it is ony thynge depe in a pole. For it is but a pryſon to fyſſhe. and they lyue for ye more parte in hungre lyke priſoners: and therfore it is the leſſe mayſtry to take theym. But in a ryuer ye ſhall angle in euery place where it is depe and clere by the grounde: as grauell or claye wythout mudde or wedys. And in eſpecyall yf that there be a manere whyrlynge of water or a couert. As an holow banke: or grete rotys of trees: or longe wedes fletyng aboue in the water where the fyſſhe maye couere and hyde theymſelf at certayn tymes whan they lyſte Alſo it is good for to angle in depe ſtyffe ſtremys and alſo in fallys of waters and weares: and in floode gatys and mylle pyttes. And it is good for to angle where as the water reſtyth by the banke: and where the ſtreme rennyth nyghe there by: and is depe and clere by the grounde

and inony other placys where ye may ſe ony fyſſh houe or haue ony fedynge.
               NOw ye ſhall wyte what tyme of the daye ye ſhall angle ¶From the begynnynge of May vntyll it be Septembre the bytynge tyme is erly by the morowe from foure of ye clocke vnto eyghte of the clocke. And at after none from foure of the clocke vnto eyghte of the clocke: but not ſoo good as is in the mornynge. And yf it be a colde whyſtelyng wynde and a derke lowrynge daye. For a derke daye is moche better to angle in than a clere daye. ¶From the begynnynge of Septembre vnto the ende of Apryll ſpare noo tyme of the daye: ¶Alſo many pole fyſſhes woll byte beſte in the none tyde.
               ¶And yf ye ſe ony tyme of the daye the trought or graylynge lepe: angle to hym wyth a dubbe acordynge to the ſame month And where the water ebbyth and flowyth the fyſſhe woll byte in ſome place at the ebbe: and in ſome place at the flood. After yt they haue reſtynge behynde ſtangnys and archys of brydgys and other ſuche manere places.
               HEre ye ſhall wyte in what weder ye ſhall angle. as I ſayd before in a derke lowrynge daye whanne the wynde blowyth ſoftly. And in ſomer ſeaſon whan it is brennynge hote thenne it is nought. ¶From Septembre vnto Apryll in a fayr ſonny daye is ryght good to angle. And yf the wynde in that ſeaſon haue ony parte of the Oryent: the wedyr thenne is nought. And whan it is a grete wynde. And whan it ſnowith reynyth or hayllyth. or is a grete tempeſte / as thondyr or lightenynge: or a ſwoly hote weder: thenne it is noughte for to angle.
               NOw ſhall ye wyte that there ben twelue manere of ympedymentes whyche cauſe a man to take noo fyſſhe. wt out other comyn that maye caſuelly happe. ¶The fyrſt is yf your harnays be not mete nor fetly made. The ſeconde is yf your bayees be not good nor fyne. The thyrde is yf that ye angle not in bytynge tyme. The fourth is yf that the fyſſhe be frayed wt the ſyghte of a man. The fyfth yf the water be very thycke: whyte or redde of ony floode late fallen. The ſyxte yf the fyſſhe ſtyre not for colde. The ſeuenth yf that the wedyr

be hote. The eyght yf it rayne. The nynthe yf it hayll or ſnow falle. The tenth is yf it be a tempeſte. The enleuenth is yf it be a grete wynde. The twelfyfth yf the wynde be in the Eeſt / and that is worſte For comynly neyther wynter nor ſomer ye fyſſhe woll not byte thenne. The weſte and northe wyndes ben good but the ſouth is beſte.
            
            
               ANd now I haue tolde you how to make your harnays: and how ye ſhall fyſſhe therwyth in al poyntes. Reaſon woll that ye knowe wyth what baytes ye ſhall angle to euery manere of fyſſhe in euery moneth of the yere / whyche is all the effecte of the crafte. And wythout whyche baytes knowen well by you all your other crafte here toforn auayllyth you not to purpoſe. For ye can not brynge an hoke in to a fyſſh mouth wythout a bayte. Whiche baytes for euery manere of fyſſh and for euery moneth here folowyth in this wyſe.
               FOr by cauſe that the Samon is the mooſt ſtately fyſſh that ony man maye angle to in freſſhe water. Therfore I purpoſe to begyn̄ at hym. ¶The ſamon is a gentyll fyſſhe: but he is comborous for to take. For comynly he is but in depe places of grete ryuers. And for the more parte he holdyth the myddys of it: that a man maye not come at hym. And he is in ſeaſon from Marche vnto Myghelmas. ¶In whyche ſeaſon ye ſhall angle to hym wyth thyſe baytes whan ye maye gete theym. Fyrſte wyth a redde worme in the begynnynge & endynge of the ſeaſon. And alſo wyth a bobbe that bredyth in a dunghyll. And ſpecyally wyth a ſouerayn bayte that bredyth on a water docke. ¶And he bytith not at the grounde: but at ye flote. Alſo ye may take hym: but it is ſeldom ſeen with a dubbe at ſuche tyme as whan he lepith in lyke fourme & manere as ye doo take a troughte or a gryalynge. And thyſe baytes ben well prouyd baytes for the ſamon.
               THe Troughte for by cauſe he is a right deyntous fyſſh and alſo a ryght feruente-byter we ſhall ſpeke nexte of hym. He is in ſeaſon fro Marche vnto Myghelmas. He is on clene grauely groūde & in a ſtreme. Ye may angle to hym

all tymes wyth a grounde lyne lyenge or rennynge: ſauyng in lepynge tyme. and thenne wyth a dubbe. And erly wyth a rennynge grounde lyne. and forth in the daye wyth a flote lyne. ¶Ye ſhall angle to hym in Marche wyth a menew hangyd on your hoke by the nether neſſe wythout flote or plumbe: drawynge vp & downe in the ſtreme tyll ye fele hym faſte. ¶In the ſame tyme angle to hym wyth a groūde lyne with a redde worme for the mooſt ſure. ¶In Aprill take the ſame baytes: & alſo Inneba other wyſe namyd .vij. eyes. Alſo the canker that bredyth in a grete tree and the redde ſnayll. ¶In May take ye ſtone flye and the bobbe vnder the cowe torde and the ſylke worme: and the bayte that bredyth on a fern̄ leyf. ¶In Iuyn take a redde worme & nyppe of the heed: and put on thyn hoke a codworme byforn. ¶In Iuyll take the grete redde worme and the codworme togyder. ¶In Auguſt take a fleſſhe flye & the grete redde worme and the fatte of the bakon: and bynde abowte thy hoke. ¶In Septembre take the redde worme and the menew. ¶In Octobre take the ſame: for they ben ſpecyall for the trought all tymes of the yere. From Aprill tyll Septembre ye trough lepyth. thenne angle to hym wyth a dubbyd hoke acordynge to the monethꝭ whyche dubbyd hokys ye ſhall fynde in thende of this treatyſe: and the monethys wyth theym.:
               THe grayllynge by a nother name callyd vmbre ia a delycyous fyſſhe to mannys mouthe. And ye maye take hym lyke as ye doo the trought. And thyſe ben his baytes. ¶In Marche & in Apryll the redde worme. ¶In May the grene worme: a lytyll breyled worme: the docke canker. and the hawthorn worme. ¶In Iune the bayte that bredyth betwene the tree & the barke of an oke. ¶In Iuyll a bayte that bredyth on a fern̄ leyf: and the grete redde worme. And nyppe of the hede: and put on your hoke a codworme before. ¶In Auguſt the redde worme: and a docke worme. And al the yere after a redde worme.
               THe barbyll is a ſwete fyſſhe / but it is a quaſy meete & a peryllous for mannys body. For comynly he yeuyth an introduxion to ye Febres. And yf he be eten rawe: he maye be cauſe of mannys dethe: whyche hath oft be ſeen. Thyſe

be his baytes. ¶In Marche & in Apryll take fayr freſſhe cheſe: and laye it on a borde & kytte it in ſmall ſquare pecys of the lengthe of your hoke. Take thenne a candyl & brenne it on the ende at the poynt of your hoke tyll it be yelow. And then̄e bynde it on your hoke with fletchers ſylke: and make it rough lyke a welbede. This bayte is good all the ſomer ſeaſon. ¶In May & Iune take ye hawthorn̄ worme & the grete redde worme. and nyppe of the heed. And put on your hoke a codworme before. & that is a good bayte.
