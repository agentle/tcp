            THE AVTHOVRS
Preface to the
Reader,
            
               IT falls out often, that the effects of mens
actions comes cleane contrary to the intent
of the Authour. The ſame find I by
experiēce (beloued Reader) in my Poeme
of Lepanto: For although till now, it
haue not bene imprinted, yet being ſet out to the publike
view of many, by a great ſort of ſtoln copies, purchaſt (in
truth) without my knowledge or conſent, it hath for lack
of a Preface, bene in ſome things miſconstrued by ſundry,
which I of very purpoſe thinking to haue omitted,
for that the writing thereof might haue tended, in my
opinion, to ſome reproch of the skilful learnednes of the
Reader, as if his braynes could not haue conceyued ſo
vncurious a work, without ſome maner of commentary,
& ſo haue made the worke more diſpleaſant vnto him:
it hath by the contrary falne out, that the lack thereof
hath made it the more diſpleaſāt to ſome, through their
miſtaking a part of the meaning thereof. And for that I
know the ſpecial thing miſliked in it, is, that I ſhould
ſeeme far contrary to my degree & Religion, like a mercenarie
Poet, to pen a worke, ex profeſſo, in praiſe of a
forraine Papiſt haſtard; I will, by ſetting downe the

nature and order of the Poeme, reſclue the ignorant of
their error, and make the other ſort inexcuſable of their
captiouſnes. The nature then of this Poeme, is an argument,
a minore ad maius, largely intreated by a Poetike
compariſon, being to the writing hereof moued, by
the ſtirring vp of the league & cruell perſecution of the
Proteſtants in al coūtries, at the very firſt raging wherof,
I compiled this Poeme, as the exhortation to the perſecuted
in the hinmoſt eight lines thereof doth plainely
teſtify, being both begun and ended in the ſame Summer,
wherin the league was publiſhed in Fraunce. The
order of the Cantique is this: Firſt, a Poetike preface,
declaring the matter I treat of, wherein, I▪ name not
Don-Iohn, neither literally nor any wayes by deſcription,
which I behoued to haue done, if I had penned the
whole Poeme in his praiſe, as Virgil, Arma virum
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                  
cano: & Homer, Dic mihi muſa virum: of whoſe
imitation I had not bene aſhamed, if ſo my purpoſe had
bene framed. Next followes my inuocation to the true
God onely, and not to all the Hee and Shee Saints, for
whoſe vaine honors, Don-Iohn fought in al his wars.
Next after my inuocation, followes the poetike Hiſtory
of my compariſon, wherein following forth the ground
of a true hiſtory, (as Virgil or Homer did) like a painter
ſhadowing with vmbers a portrait els drawne in
groſſe, for giuing it greater viuenes, ſo I eike or paire to
the circumſtances of the actions, as the rules of the poetike
arte will permit: which hiſtorike compariſon continues
till the ſong of the Angels: in the which I
compare and apply the former compariſon to our preſent
eſtate, taking occaſion thereupon to ſpeak ſomewhat

of our religion. Laſtly, the Epilogue of the whole, in the
laſt eight lines, declares fully my intention in the whole,
and explaines ſo fully my compariſon and argument,
from the more to the leſse, as I cannot without ſhameful
repetition ſpeak any more thereof. And in a word, what
ſoeuer praiſe I haue giuen to Don-Iohn in this Poem,
it is neither in accounting him as firſt or ſecond cauſe of
that victorie, but onely as a particular man, when hee
falles in my way, to ſpeake the truth of him. For as it
becomes not the honour of my estate, like an hireling,
to pen the praiſe of any man: So becomes it far leſse the
highneſſe of my ranke and calling, to ſpare for the feare
or fauour of whomſoeuer liuing, to ſpeake or write the
truth of any. And thus crauing pardon, beloued Reader,
for this long ſome Apologie (being driuen thereto,
not by nature, but by neceſsitie) I bid you hartily farewell.
         
         
            
            THE SONNET.
            THe azur'd vault, the cristall circles bright,
            The gleaming fiery torches powdred there,
            The changing round, the ſhining beamy light,
            The ſad and bearded fyres, the monſters fayre:
            The prodigies appearing in the ayre,
            The rearding thunders, and the bluſtering winds,
            The fowles, in hew, in ſhape, and nature rayre,
            The pretty notes that wing'd muſicians finds:
            In earth the ſau'ry flowres, the mettal'd minds,
            The holeſome hearbes, the haughty pleaſant trees,
            The ſiluer ſtreames, the beaſtes of ſundry kinds,
            The bounded roares, and fiſhes of the ſeas:
            All theſe for teaching man, the LORD did frame,
            To doe his will, whoſe glory ſhines in thame.

            HIS MAIESTIES
LEPANTO:
OR,
HEROICALL SONG.
            
               I Sing a wondrous worke of God,
            I ſing his mercies great,
            I ſing his iuſtice heere—withall
            Powr'd from his holy ſeat:
            To wit, a cruell Martiall warre,
            A bloudy battell bold,
            Long doubtſome fight, with ſlaughter huge,
            And wounded manifold.
            Which fought was in LEPANTOES gulfe,
            Betwixt the baptiz'd race,
            And circumciſed Turband Turkes
            Rencountring in that place.
            O onely God, I pray thee thrice,
            Thrice one in perſons three,
            Alike Eternall, like of might,
            Although diſtinct ye be.
            I pray thee Father, through thy Sonne,
            Thy word immortall ſtill,
            The great ARCHANGELL of records,
            And worker of thy will,
            To make thy holy Spreit my Muſe,
            And eik my pen inflame,
            Aboue my ſkill to write this worke,
            To magnify thy name.
            
               
Into the turning ſtill of times,
            I erre, no time can be,
            Where was and is, and times to come,
            Confounded are all three:
            I meane, before great God in Heauen,
            (For Sunne and Moone deuides
            The times in earth by houres and dayes,
            And ſeaſons ſtill that ſlides.)
            Yet Man, whome Man muſt vnderſtand,
            Muſt ſpeake into this caſe,
            As man; our fleſh will not permit,
            Wee heauenly things imbrace.
            Then, as I els began to ſay,
            One day it did fall out,
            As glorious God in gliſtering throne,
            With Angels round about
            Did ſit, and Chriſt at his right hand,
            That crafty Satan came,
            Deceyuer, Lyar, hating man,
            And Gods moſt ſacred Name.
            This olde abuſer ſtood into
            The preſence of the Lord:
            Then in this maner Chriſt accuſ'de
            The ſower of diſcord:
            I know, thou from that Citie comeſt,
            CONSTANTINOPLE great,
            Where thou haſt by thy malice made
            The faythleſſe Turkes to freat:
            Thou haſt inflamde their maddeſt mindes
            With raging fire of wraith,
            Againſt them all that doe profeſſe
            My Name with feruent fayth.
            How long, O Father, ſhall they thus,
            Quite vnder foote be tred,
            By faythleſſe folkes, who executes
            What in this Snake is bred!
            
               
Then Satan anſwered, Fayth? Quoth he,
            Their Fayth is too too ſmall;
            They ſtriue, me thinke, on eyther part,
            Who fartheſt backe can fall:
            Haſt thou not giuen them in my hands,
            Euen both the ſides, I ſay,
            That I, as beſt doth ſeeme to me,
            May vſe them euery way?
            Then IEHOVA, whoſe nod doth make
            The heauens and mountaynes quake,
            Whoſe ſmalleſt wrath the Centers makes
            Of all the Earth to ſhake;
            Whoſe word did make the world of nought,
            And whoſe approouing ſyne
            Did ſtabliſh all, euen as we ſee,
            By force of voyce diuine:
            This God began from thundering throate
            Graue words of wayght to bring:
            All Chriſtians ſerue my ſonne, though not
            Aright in euery thing.
            No more ſhall now theſe Chriſtians be
            With Infidels oppreſt,
            So of my holy hallowed Name
            The force is great and bleſt
            Deſiſt ô Tempter. Gabriel, come,
            O thou ARCHANGEL true,
            Whome I haue oft in meſſage ſent
            To Realmes and Townes anew.
            Go quickly hence to Venice Towne,
            And put into their mindes,
            To take reuenge of wrongs the Turkes
            Haue done in ſundry kindes.
            No whiſling winde with ſuch a ſpeed,
            From hilles can hurle ore heugh,
            As he whoſe thought doth furniſh ſpeed,
            His thought was ſpeed aneugh.
            
               
This Towne it ſtands within the Sea,
            Fiue miles or thereabout,
            Vpon no Ile nor ground, the Sea
            Runnes all the ſtreetes throughout,
            Who ſtood vpon the ſteeple head,
            Should ſee a wondrous ſight,
            A Towne to ſtand without a ground,
            Her ground is made by ſlight:
            Strong Timber props dung in the Sea
            Do beare her vp by art,
            An Ile is all her market-place,
            A large and ſpacious part.
            A Duke with Senate ioynd doth rule,
            Saint MARKE is patron chiefe,
            Ilk yeare they wedde the Sea with rings
            To be their ſure reliefe.
            The Angell then arriu'd into
            This artificiall Towne,
            And chang'd in likenes of a man,
            He walkes both vp and downe,
            While time he met ſome man of ſpreit,
            And then began to ſay,
            What do we all? me thinke we ſleepe:
            Are we not day by day▪
            
            By cruell Turkes and Infidels
            Moſt ſpitefully oppreſt?
            They kill our Knights, they braſh our forts.
            They let vs neuer reſt.
            Go too, go too, once make a proofe:
            No more let vs deſiſt:
            To bold attempts God giues ſucceſſe,
            If once aſſay we liſt.
            With this he goes away. This man
            Vnto an other tells
            The purpoſe, whereunto they both
            Agree among themſels.
            
               
This other to an other tels,
            And ſo from hand to hand
            It ſpreads and goes, and all that heard
            It, neceſſare it fand.
            And laſt of all it comes vnto
            The Duke and Senates care,
            Who found it good, and followed furth
            The ſame as ye ſhall heare.
            The Towne was driuen into this time,
            In ſuch a pitteous ſtrait
            By Mahometiſts, that they had els
            Giuen ouer all debait.
            The Turke had conqueſt Cyprus Ile,
            And all their lands that lay
            Without the bounds of Italie,
            Almoſt the whole, I ſay:
            And they for laſt refuge of all,
            Had moou'd each Chriſtian King,
            To make their Churches pray for their
            Reliefe in euery thing.
            The Towne with pitteous plaints did call
            Vpon the Lord of might,
            With praying ſtill and faſting oft,
            And groning all the night:
            Was nothing heard but ſobs and ſighs,
            Was nothing ſeene but teares,
            Yea ſorrow draue the braueſt men
            With mourning to their beares.
            The women ſwound for ſorrow oft,
            The babe for woe did weepe,
            To ſee the mother giuing milke,
            Such dolefull geſture keepe.
            Young men and maides within the Towne
            Were ay arraid in blacke,
            Each Eau'n the Sunne was ſooner hid
            Then earſt, the night to macke.
            
               
No Venus then, nor Cupid falſe,
            Durſt kyth or once appeare,
            For pale diſtreſſe had baniſht them,
            By ſadde and ſory cheare.
            As ſeas did compaſſe them about,
            As Seas the ſtreets did rin,
            So Seas of teares did euer flow
            The houſes all within.
            As Seas within were ioynd with howles,
            So Seas without did rayre,
            Their carefull cries to Heauen did mount,
            Reſounding in the ayre.
            O ſtay, my Muſe, thou goeſt too farre:
            Shew where we left before,
            Leſt trickling teares ſo fill my pen,
            That it will write no more.
            Then VENICE being in this ſtate,
            When Gabriel there was ſent,
            His ſpeaches ſpread abroad, made Towne
            And Senate both ſo bent
            To take reuenge, as they implorde
            The Chriſtian Princes ayd,
            Of forces ſuch, as eaſily,
            They might haue ſpar'd and may'd.
            At laſt, ſupport was graunted them,
            The holy league was paſt,
            Als long to ſtand, as twixt the Turkes
            And Chriſtians warre ſhould laſt.
            It was agreed, that into March,
            Or Aprill euery yeare,
            The army ſhould on Eaſterne Seas,
            Conuene from farre and neare.
            Thus bent vpon their enterpriſe,
            The principals did conueene,
            Into Meſſena to conſult,
            What order ſhould haue beene
            
               
Obſeru'd in all their army great:
            There Don Iohn d' Auſtria came,
            Their Generall great, and Venier als
            Came there in Venice name▪
            
            From Genes Andrea Dor
                     ••
                  
                came,
            And Rome Colonne ſent,
            When they with others many dayes
            Had into counſayle ſpent.
            In end Aſcagnio Dela Corne,
            
            A martiall man and wiſe,
            His counſayle gaue, as ye ſhall heare
            Vpon their enterpriſe.
            Three cauſes be (ô chieftaynes braue)
            That ſhould a Generall let,
            On Fortunes light vncertayne wheele
            The victory to ſet:
            Firſt, if the loſſe may harme him more,
            Then winning can auayle,
            As if his Realme he doe defend
            From them that it aſſayle.
            The next, is when the contrare Hoſt
            Is able to deuide,
            For ſickneſſe ſore, or famine great,
            Then beſt is to abide.
            The third and laſt, it is in caſe
            His forces be too ſmall,
            Then better farre is to delay,
            Then for to per

                all.
            But ſince of theſe two former poynts
            We need not ſtand in doubt,
            Then though we leeſe, we may defend
            Our Countries round about.
            As to the laſt, this armie is
            So awfull, ſtrong and fayre,
            And furniſht ſo with neceſſares
            Through your foreſeeing care,
            
               
That nought doth reſt but courage bolde.
            Then ſince your ſtate is ſuch,
            With truſt in God aſſay your chaunce.
            Good cauſe auayleth much.
            But ſpecially take heed to this,
            That ere ye make away,
            Ye order all concerning watre,
            Into their due array:
            For if while that ye ſee your foes,
            Ye ſhall continue all,
            Then ſhall their ſudden ſight with feare
            Your braueſt Spreits appall.
            Each one commaund a ſundry thing,
            Aſtoniſht of the caſe,
            And euery ſimple Soldat ſhall
            Vſurpe his Captaynes place.
            This counſall ſo contents them all,
            That euery man departs,
            With whiſpering much, and ſo reſolues
            With bold magnanime hearts.
            THEIR preparations being made,
            They all vpon a day,
            Their biting Ankers gladly wayde,
            And made them for the way.
            The Grecian Fleet, for Helens cauſe
            That Neptunes towne did ſacke,
            In braue array, or gliſtring armes,
            No match to them could macke.
            There came eight thouſand Spaniards braue
            From hote and barren Spayne,
            Good ordour-keepars, cold in fight,
            With proud diſdaynfull brayne,
            From pleaſant fertill Italie,
            There came twelue thouſand als,
            With ſubtill ſpreits bent to reuenge,
            By crafty meanes and fals.
            
               
Three thouſand Almans alſo came,
            From Countries cold and wide,
            Theſe money men with awfull cheare
            The chock will dourely bide.
            From diuers parts did alſo come,
            Three thouſand venturers braue,
            All voluntaires of conſcience mou'd,
            And would no wages haue.
            Armde Galleyes twice a hundr'and eight,
            Six ſhippes all wondrous great,
            And fiue and twenty loadned ſhippes,
            With baggage, and with meat;
            With fourty other little barkes,
            And prettie Galeots ſmall.
            Of theſe aforeſayd was compound
            The Chriſtian Nauie all.
            THIS cloud of Gallies thus began
            On Neptunes backe to rowe:
            And in the ſhips the Marriners
            Did skippe from towe to towe.
            With willing minds they hayld the Tyes,
            And hoyſt the flaffing Sayles,
            And ſtrongeſt towes, from higheſt maſtes,
            With force and practique hayles.
            The Forceats lothſomly did rowe,
            In Gallies 'gainſt their will,
            Whom Galley-maſters oft did beat,
            And threaten euer ſtill.
            The foming Seas did bullor vp,
            The risking Oares did raſh,
            The Souldats pieces for to clenge
            Did ſhowres of ſhots delaſh.
            But as the Deuill is ready bent,
            Good workes to hinder ay,
            So ſowd he in this Nauy ſtrife,
            Their good ſucceſſe to ſtay.
            
               
Yet did the wiſdomes of the Chiefes,
            And of the generall moſt,
            Compound all quarrels and debates
            That were, into that Hoſt,
            Preferring wiſely as they ought,
            The honour of the Lord,
            Vnto their owne, the publike cauſe,
            To priuate mens diſcord.
            The feathered fame of wondrous ſpeed.
            That doth delight to flee
            On tops of houſes pratling all
            That ſhe can heare or ſee,
            Part true, part falſe: this monſter ſtrange
            Among the Turkes did tell,
            That diuers Chriſtian Princes ioynd,
            Reſolu'd with them to mel.
            Then ſpyes were ſent abroad, who told
            The matter as it ſtood.
            Except in Arythmetique (as
            It ſeemd) they were not good:
            For they did count their number, to
            Be leſſe then was indeed,
            Which did into the great Turkes mind
            A great diſdayning breed.
            A perrilous thing, as euer came
            Into a Chieftaynes brayne,
            To ſet at nought his foes (though ſmall)
            By lighleing diſdayne.
            Then Selym ſent a Nauy out,
            Who wandred without reſt,
            Whill time into LEPANTOES gulfe,
            They all their Ankers keſt.
            In ſeaſon when with ſharpeſt hooks
            The buſie ſhearers cowe
            The fruitfull yellow locks of gold,
            That doe on Ceres growe,
            
               
And when the ſtrongeſt Trees for weight
            Of birth doe downeward bow
            Their heauy heads, whoſe colourd knops
            In ſhowres rayne ripely now,
            And husband men with Woodbind crownes,
            To twice borne Bacchus dance,
            Whoſe pleaſant poyſon ſweet in taſte,
            Doth caſt them in a trance:
            Into this riping ſeaſon ſure,
            The Chriſtian Hoſt, I ſay,
            Were all aſſembled for to make
            Them readie for the way.
            But or they from Meſſena came,
            The Vines were ſtanding bayre,
            Trees voyd of fruite, and Ceres polde,
            And lacking all her hayre:
            But when that leaues, with ratling falles
            In banks of withered boughes,
            And carefull labourers doe begin
            To yoke the paynefull ploughes,
            The Nauies neere to other drew,
            And Venier (ſent before)
            Gaue falſe Alarum, ſending word,
            The Turkes had skowp'd the ſcore,
            That fifty Gallyes quite were fled.
            This word he ſent expreſſe,
            To make the Chriſtians willingly
            To battell them addreſſe.
            As ſo they did, and entred all,
            (Moou'd by that ſamin flight)
            Into LEPANTOES gulfe, and there
            Preparde them for the fight.
            Whill this was doing here on earth,
            Great God, who creates all,
            (With wakrife eye preordoning
            What euer doth befall)
            
               
Was ſitting in his pompous throne,
            In higheſt heauen aboue,
            And gloriouſly accompanide
            With Iuſtice and with Loue:
            The one hath ſmiling countenance,
            The other frowning cheare:
            The one to mercy ſtill perſwades
            Him as a Father deare:
            The other for to powre his plagues
            Vpon repining ſinne,
            And fill the fields with wofull cryes,
            The houſes all with dinne.
            But yet the Lord ſo temperates them,
            That both doe brooke their place,
            For Iuſtice whiles obtaynes her will,
            But euermore doth grace:
            IEHOVA als hath balances,
            Wherewith hee weighes aright
            The greateſt and the heauieſt ſinnes
            With ſmaller faults and light:
            Theſe grace did moue him for to take:
            And ſo he weighed in heauen
            The Chriſtian faults, with faithleſſe Turkes.
            The ballance ſtood not eauen,
            But ſweyd vpon the faythleſſe ſide.
            And then with awfull face,
            Frownd God of Hoſts, the whirling heau'ns
            For feare did tremble space.
            The ſtayeſt mountaynes ſhuddred all,
            The grounds of earth did ſhake,
            The Seas did bray, and Plutoes Realm▪
            
            For horrour cold did quake.
            HOW ſoone Aur
                     •
                  raes ioyfull face
            Had ſhead the ſhady night,
            And made the chiuering Larks to ſing
            For gladneſſe of the light,
            
               
And Phoebe with inconſtant face,
            In Seas had gone to reſt,
            And Phoebus chaſing vapours moyſt,
            The Skye made blew celeſt;
            The Generall of the Chriſtian Hoſt,
            Vpon his Galley Maſt,
            The bloudy ſigne of furious Mars,
            
            Made to be fixed faſt.
            Then, as into a ſpacious towne,
            At breaking of the day,
            The buſie worke-men doe prepare
            Their Worklumes euery way.
            The Wright doth ſharpe his hacking Axe,
            The Smith his grinding File,
            Glaſſe-makers beets their fire that burnes
            Continuall, not a while:
            The Paynter mixes colours viue,
            The Printer Letters ſets,
            The Maſon clinks on Marble ſtones,
            Which hardly dreſt he gets:
            Euen ſo, how ſoone this Warriour world
            With earneſt eyes did ſee
            Yon ſigne of warre, they all preparde
            To winne or elſe to dye:
            Here Hagbutters prepar'd with ſpeed
            A number of Bullets round;
            There Cannoners, their Cannons ſteild,
            To make deſtroying ſound;
            Here Knights did dight their burniſht brands,
            Their Archers bowes did bend,
            The Armorers on Corſlets knockt,
            And Harneſſe hard did mend,
            The fiery Marriners at once
            Made all their tackling claire
            With whiſpering dinne, and cryes confuſ'd,
            Preparing here and there:
            
               
As buſie Bees within their Hiues
            With murmuring euer ſtill,
            Are earn'ſt vpon their fruitfull worke,
            Their empty holes to fill.
            The Flags and Enſignes were diſplayd,
            At Zephyrs will to waue,
            Each paynted in the colours cleare
            Of euery owner braue.
            But all this time, in carefull minde
            The Generall euer rolde,
            What maner of aray would beſt
            Fit ſuch an army bolde.
            To pance on this it paynd him more,
            This more did trouble his breſt,
            Then Cannons, Cor
                  •
               e-lets, Bullets, Tackle,
            And Swords, and Bowes, the reſt.
            And at the laſt with ripe aduice,
            Of Chieftaynes ſage and graue,
            He ſhead in three, in Creſſents forme,
            This martiall army braue:
            The Generall in the battayle was,
            And Colonell vndertooke
            The right wing with the force of Genes,
            
            The left did Venier brooke.
            WHEN this was done, the Spaniſh Prince
            Did rowe about them all,
            And on the names of ſpeciall men,
            With louing ſpeach did call,
            Remembring them how righteous was
            Their quarrell, and how good,
            Immortall praiſe, and infinit gaynes,
            To conquere with their blood;
            And that the glory of God in earth,
            Into their manhead ſtands,
            Through iuſt reliefe of Chriſtian ſoules
            From cruell Pagans hands.
            
               
But if the Enemie triumphed
            Of them and of their fame,
            In millions men to bondage would,
            Profeſsing IESVS name,
            The Spaniol Prince exhorting thus
            With glad and ſmiling cheare,
            With ſugred words and geſture good,
            So pleaſ'd both eye and eare,
            That euerie man cryed victorie.
            This word abroad they blew,
            A good preſage that victorie
            Thereafter ſhould enſew.
            The Turquiſh Hoſt in manner like
            Themſelues they did aray,
            The which two Baſhas did commaund
            And order euery way.
            For Portan Baſha had in charge,
            To gouerne all by land,
            And Ali-Baſha had by Sea
            The onely chiefe command,
            Theſe Baſhas in the battaile were,
            With mo then I can tell,
            And Mahomet Bey the right wing had,
            The left Ochiali fell.
            Then Ali-Baſha viſied all
            With bold and manly face,
            Whoſe tongue did vtter courage more
            Then had alluring grace:
            He did recount amongſt the reſt,
            What victorie Turkes obtaind
            On caytife Chriſtians, and how long
            The Ottomans race had raignd:
            He told them als, how long themſelues
            Had victours euer bene,
            Euen of theſe ſame three Princes ſmall,
            That now durſt ſo conuene.
            
               
And would ye then giue ſuch a lye
            Vnto your glories paſt,
            As let your ſelues be ouerthrowne
            By looſers at the laſt?
            This victory ſhall Europe make
            To be your conqueſt pray,
            And all the rare things therein till,
            Ye carry ſhall away:
            But if ye leeſe, remember well
            How ye haue made them thrall,
            This ſamin way, or worſe ſhall they
            Demayne you one and all,
            And then ſhall all your honours paſt,
            In ſmoake euaniſh quite,
            And all your pleaſures turne in payne,
            In dolour your delite:
            Take courage then, and boldly to it,
            Our Mahomet will ayd,
            Conducting all your ſhots and ſtroakes
            Of arrowe, dart, and blayd:
            For nothing care, but onely one,
            Which onely doth me fray,
            That ere with them we euer meet,
            For feare they flee away.
            This ſpeach did ſo the Army pleaſe,
            And ſo their mindes did moue,
            That clinks of Swords, and rattle of Pikes,
            His ſpeaches did approue.
            THE gliſtring cleare of ſhining Sunne
            Made both the Hoſts ſo glaunce,
            As fiſhes eyes did reele to ſee.
            Such hewes on Seas to daunce:
            But Titan ſhinde on eyes of Turkes,
            And on the Chriſtians backs,
            Although the wauering wind, the which
            But ſeldome ſetling tacks,
            
               
The Turks did ſecond euer ſtill,
            Whill but a little ſpace
            Before the chocke, ô miracle!
            It turnd into their face:
            Which Chriſtians ioyfull as a ſ
                  •
               ale
            And token did receaue,
            That God of Hoſts had promis'd them,
            They victory ſhould haue.
            HOW ſoone a Cannons ſmoaky throat
            The Seas did dindle all,
            And on Bellona bold and wiſe,
            And bloudy Mars did call,
            And that the ſounding cleare of braſſe,
            Did als approue the ſame,
            And kindled courage into men,
            To winne immortall fame.
            But what? Me thinke I doe intend
            This battayle to recite,
            And what by Martiall force was done,
            My pen preſumes to write,
            As if I had yon bloody God,
            And all his power ſeene,
            Yea to deſcriue the God of Hoſts,
            My pen had able bene:
            No, no: no man that witneſſe was,
            Can ſet it out aright.
            Then how can I by heare-ſay doe,
            Which none could doe by ſight?
            But ſince I raſhly tooke in hand,
            I muſt aſſay it now,
            With hope that this my good intent
            Ye Readers will allow:
            I alſo truſt, that euen as he
            Who in the Sunne doth walke,
            Is colourd by the ſamin Sunne,
            So ſhall my following talke,
            
               
Some ſauour keepe of Martial actes,
            Since I would paint them out,
            And God ſhall to his honour als
            My pen guide out of doubt.
            This warning giuen to Chriſtians, they
            With Turkes yoake here and there,
            And firſt the ſixe aforeſayd ſhippes,
            That were ſo large and fayre,
            And placed were in former ranks,
            Did firſt of all purſew
            With Bullets, Raiſers, Chaynes, & nayles,
            That from their pieces flew:
            Their Cannons rummiſht all at once,
            Whoſe mortall thudding draue
            The fatall Turkes, to be content
            With Thetis for their graue.
            The Fiſhes were aſtoniſht all,
            To heare ſuch hideous ſound,
            The Azure skye was dim'd with ſmoke:
            The dinne that did abound,
            Like thunder rearding rumling raue
            With roares the higheſt Heauen,
            And pearſt with pith the gliſtring vaults
            Of all the Plannets ſeauen:
            The piteous plaints, the hideous howles,
            The grieuous cryes and mones,
            Of millions wounded ſundry wayes,
            But dying all at ones,
            Conioynd with former horrible ſound,
            Diſtemperd all the ayre,
            And made the Seas for terrour ſhake
            With braying euer where:
            Yet all theſe vnacquainted roares,
            The fearefull threatning ſound,
            Ioynd with the groning murmuring howles,
            The courage could not wound
            
               
So farre of Turkiſh Chieftaynes braue,
            As them to let or fray,
            With boldeſt ſpeed their grieuous harmes
            With like for to repay,
            Who made their Cannons bray ſo faſt,
            And Hagbuts crack ſo thicke,
            As Chriſtians dead in number almoſt
            Did counteruayle the quicke,
            And ſent full many carcages
            Of Seas to loweſt ground,
            The Cannons thuds and cries of men
            Did in the sky reſound,
            But Turkes remaynd not long vnpayd
            Euen with their proper coyne,
            By bitter ſhots, which Chriſtians did
            To former thundring ioyne:
            Dead dropt they downe on euery ſide,
            Their ſighing Spreits eſchewes,
            And croſſes Sty
                  •
                into diſdayne,
            To heare infernall newes:
            Yea ſcarcely could the ancient boate
            Such number of ſoules contayne,
            But ſobbed vnderneath the weight
            Of Paſſengers prophane.
            While here the Father ſtood with Sonne,
            A whirling round doth beare
            The lead that dings the Father in droſſe,
            And fils the Sonne with feare;
            Whill there a Chieftayne ſhrilly cryes,
            And Soldats doth command,
            A ſpeedy Pellet ſtops his ſpeach,
            And ſtayes his poynting hand▪
            
            Whill time a cluſtered troupe doth ſtand
            Amaz'd together all,
            A fatall Bullet them among,
            Makes ſome ſelected fall:
            
               
The hideous noyſe ſo deaf'd them all,
            Increaſing euer ſtill,
            That ready Soldats could not heare
            Their wiſe Commaunders will;
            But euery man as Mars him moou'd,
            And as occaſion ſeru'd,
            His duty did, the beſt he might,
            And for no perill ſweru'd:
            Their old Commaunders precepts paſt
            They put in practiſe then,
            And onely memory did commaund
            That multitude of men.
            THVS after they with Cannons had
            Their duty done afarre,
            And time in end had wearied them
            Of ſuch embaſſad warre,
            A rude recounter then they made,
            Together Galleys clipt,
            And eche one other raſht her noſe,
            That in the Sea was dipt:
            No maner of man was idle then,
            Each man his armes did vſe:
            No ſcaping place is in the Seas,
            Though men would Mars refuſe:
            The valiant Knight with Coutlaſſe ſharpe,
            Of fighting foe doth part
            The bloody head from body pale,
            Whill one with deadly dart
            Doth pearce his enemies heart in twayne,
            Another fearce doth ſtrike
            Quite through his fellowes arme or leg,
            With poynted brangling Pike.
            The Cannons leaue not thundering of,
            Nor Hagbuts ſhooting ſtill,
            And ſeldome Powder waſtes in vayne,
            But eyther wound or kill:
            
               
Yea euen the ſimple forceats fought
            With beggers bolts anew,
            Wherewith full many principall men,
            They wounded ſore and ſlew;
            Whill time a Chriſtian with a ſword,
            Lets out a faythleſſe breath,
            A Turke on him doth with a dart
            Reuenge his fellowes death,
            Whill time a Turke with arrow doth
            Shoot thorow a Chriſtians arme,
            A Chriſtian with a Pike dooth pearce
            The hand that did the harme:
            Whill time a Chriſtian Cannon killes
            A Turke with threatning ſound,
            A Hagbut hits the Cannoner,
            Who dead, falls to the ground:
            The beggers bolts by forceats caſten,
            On all hands made to flye,
            Iaw-bones and braynes of kild and hurt,
            Who wiſht (for payne) to dye.
            The clinks of ſwords, the rattle of Pikes,
            The whirre of arrowes light,
            The howles of hurt, the Captaynes cryes
            In vayne, doe what they might:
            The cracks of Galleyes broken and bruz'd,
            Of Gunnes the rumbling beare
            Reſounded ſo, that though the Lord
            Had thundred, none could heare.
            The Sea was verniſh'd red with blood,
            And fiſhes poyſon'd all,
            As Iehoua by Moſes rodde,
            In Aegypt made befall.
            THIS cruell fight continued thus
            Vncertayne all the while:
            For Fortune oft on either ſide
            Did frowne, and after ſmile.
            
               
It ſeem'd that Mars and Pallas both
            Did thinke the day too ſhort,
            With bloody practiſe thus to vſe
            Their olde acquainted ſport:
            For as the ſlaughter ay increaſt,
            So did the courage ſtill
            Of martiall men, whome loſſe of friends
            Enarm'd with eigre will;
            The more their number did decreaſe,
            The more that they were harmd,
            The more with Mars then were they fild
            With boldning ſpite inarm'd:
            Now vp, now downe on either ſide,
            Now Chriſtians ſeemd to winne,
            Now ouerthrowne, and now agayne,
            They ſeemd but to beginne.
            My pen for pitty cannot write,
            My hayre for horrour ſtands,
            To thinke how many Chriſtians there
            Were kild by Pagane hands.
            O Lord, throughout this Labyrinth
            Make me the way to view,
            And let thy holy threefold Sprcit
            Be my conducting clew.
            O now I ſpy a bleſſed Heauen,
            Our landing is not farre:
            Loe, good victorious tydings comes,
            To end this cruell warre.
            IN all the time that thus they fought,
            The Spaniſh Prince was clipt
            With Ali-Baſha, whome to meet,
            The reſt he had oreſlipt,
            And euen as throughout both the Hoſts,
            Dame Fortune varied ſtill,
            So kythde ſhe twixt thoſe Champions two,
            Her fond inconſtant win:
            
               
For after that the Caſtles foure
            Of Gallies both, with found,
            And ſlaughter huge, their Bullets had
            In other made rebound,
            And all the ſmall Artillery,
            Conſumde their ſhots below,
            In killing men, or elſe to cut
            Some Cable ſtrong, or Towe:
            Yet victory ſtill vncertayne was,
            And Soldats neuer ceaſt
            (With interchange of Pikes and Darts,)
            To kill or wound at leaſt.
            In end, when they with bloud abroad,
            Had bought their meeting deare,
            The victory firſt on Spaniſh ſide
            Began for to appeare:
            For euen the Spaniſh Prince himſelfe
            Did hazard at the laſt,
            Accompanied with boldeſt men,
            Who followd on him faſt,
            By force to winne the Turkiſh decke,
            The which he did obtayne,
            And entered in their Galley ſyne,
            But did not long remayne:
            For Ali-Baſha prou'd ſo well,
            With his aſſiſters braue,
            That backward faſter then they came
            Their valiant foes they draue,
            That glad they were to ſcape themſelues,
            And leaue behind anew
            Of valiant fellowes carcaſes,
            Whom thus their enemies ſlew.
            The Generall boldned then with ſpight,
            And verniſht red with ſhame,
            Did rather chuſe to leeſe his life,
            Then time his ſpreading fame:
            
               
And ſo of new encouraged
            His Souldiers true and bolde,
            As now for eigreneſſe they burne,
            Who earſt were waxed cold:
            And thus they entred in agayne,
            More fiercely then before,
            Whoſe rude aſſault could Ali then
            Reſiſt not any more,
            But fled vnto the Fort at STEVIN,
            For laſt refuge of all,
            Abiding in a doubtſome feare,
            The chance he did befall.
            A Macedonian Souldier then,
            Great honour for to win,
            Before the reſt in earneſt hope,
            To Baſha bold did rin,
            And with a Cutlace ſharpe and fine,
            Did whip me off his head,
            Who lackt not his reward of him
            That did the Nauy lead:
            The Generall ſyne caus'd fixe the head
            Vpon his Galley Maſt.
            At ſight whereof, the faythleſſe Hoſt▪
            
            Were all ſo ſore agaſt,
            That all amaz'd gaue backe at once,
            But yet were ſtayd agayne,
            And neuer one at all did ſcape,
            But taken were or ſlayne,
            
               Ochiali except, with three times ten
            Great Galleyes of his owne,
            And many of the Knights of MALT,
            Whome he had ouerthrowne:
            But if that he with his conuoy
            Had miſt a ſafe retreat,
            No newes had SELYM but by brute,
            Heard euer of this defeat.
            
               
WHEN thus the victory was obtaynd,
            And thanks were giuen to God,
            Twelue thouſand Chriſtians counted were,
            Releeu'd from Turquiſh rod.
            O Spaniſh Prince, whome of a glance
            And ſuddenly away
            The cruel fates gaue to the world,
            Not ſuffering thee to ſtay!
            With this the ſtill night ſad and blacke
            The earth oreſhadowed then,
            Who Morpheus brought with her and reſt,
            To ſteale on beaſts and men.
            BVT all this time was Venice Towne
            Reuoluing what euent
            Might come of this prepared fight,
            With doubtſome mindes and bent:
            They long'd, and yet they durſt not long,
            To heare the newes of all:
            They hoped good, they fear'd the euill,
            And keſt what might befall.
            At laſt the ioyfull tydings came,
            Which ſuch a gladneſſe bred,
            That Matrons graue, and Mayds modeſt,
            The market place beſpred:
            Anone with cheerefull countenance
            They dreſſe them in a ring,
            And thus the formoſt did begin
            Syne all the reſt to ſing.

                  As ſpecially this ſamin time
                  Moſt playnely may appeare,
                  In giuing them ſuch victory
                  That not aright him feare:
                  
                     
For ſince he ſhewes ſuch grace to them
                  That thinke themſelues are iuſt,
                  What will he more to them that in
                  His mercies onely truſt?
                  And ſith that ſo he vſes them
                  That doubt for to be ſau'd,
                  How much more them that in their hearts
                  His promiſe haue engrau'd?
                  And ſince he doth ſuch fauour ſhew
                  To them that fondly pray
                  To other Mediatours, then
                  Can helpe them any way:
                  O how then will he fauour them,
                  Who prayers doe direct
                  Vnto the Lambe, whom onely he
                  Ordaynd for that effect?
                  And ſince he doth reuenge their cauſe,
                  That worſhip God of bread,
                  (An errour vayne the which is bred
                  But in a mortall head)
                  Then how will he reuenge their cauſe
                  That onely feare and ſerue
                  His deareſt Sonne, and for his ſake
                  Will for no perils ſwerue?
                  And ſince that ſo he pities them
                  That beare vpon their brow
                  The marke of Antichriſt the Whoore,
                  That great abuſer now,
                  Who does the trueſt Chriſtians
                  With fire and ſword inuade,
                  And make them holy Martyrs, that
                  Their truſt in God haue layd,
                  How will he them that thus are vſde,
                  And beare vpon their face
                  His ſpeciall marke, a certayne ſigne
                  Of euerlaſting grace?
                  
                     
Put end vnto the trauels (Lord)
                  And miſeries of thy Saynts,
                  Remouing quite this blindneſſe groſſe,
                  That now the world ſo dants▪
                  
                  Sing prayſes of his mercy then
                  His ſuperexcellence great,
                  Which doth exceed euen all his works
                  That lye before his ſeat:
                  And let vs ſing both now and ay
                  To him with one accord,
                  O holy, holy, God of Hoſts,
                  Thou euerliuing Lord.
               
               
                  THus ended was the Angels ſong:
                  And alſo here I end,
                  Exhorting all you Chriſtians true
                  Your courage vp to bend.
                  And ſince by this defeat ye ſee,
                  That God doth loue his name
                  So well, that ſo he did them ayd
                  That ſeru'd not right the ſame:
                  Then though the Antichriſtian fect
                  Againſt you doe coniure,
                  He doth the body better loue
                  Then ſhaddow, be ye ſure:
                  Doe ye reſiſt with confidence,
                  That God ſhall be your ſtay,
                  And turne it to your comfort, and
                  His glory now and ay.
               
            
            FINIS.
