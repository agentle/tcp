But at length & in processe of time, mē vvaxing vvery to indure and continue such, so many, and so great inconueniences, vvere very desirous of some better kinde of stay & assurednesse of life: and therfore began to deuise and to consult, hovv to prouide a remedy for this disease, & salue for this sore: but yet could finde no vvay so redy, nor helpe so good, as to be reduced to some kinde of gouernment, for as Patricius vvriteth.

And therfore they made choise of such as vvere moste vvise, discreet and valiant among them selues, vvhome they appointed to be their Rulers to go before them, and vnto vvhome they yeelded and submitted themselues, to be directed and ruled after their vvisdomes.

Gouernours and rulers thus beeing constituted, they did foorthvvith indeuoure themselues to satisfie the trust, and to performe the charge committed vnto them, and first therfore they seek out to prouide meet and conuenient places vvhere to seate and settle themselues in, for their safe dvvelling togither, and from the communion of the beasts of the feeld, vnto vvhiche before they vvere accustomed: for as Vegetius sayeth.

But heer by the vvay I cannot a little muse at them vvhich vvould and needs vvil haue that a Citie should take his name of a Bishops seat or Sea, and that all Cities had their beeing and beginning from and of Bishops, and therfore there is no Citye but vvhere is a Bishop: but hovv far this is fetched and hovv vnlike: I may refer it to the Readers ovvne consideration, for long before any Bishoppes vvere had or knovven, there vvere Cityes, as Troia, Roome, Carthage, Athenes and many others, and also this Citie of EXCESTER, vvhich vvas beseeged by Vespasian the Romain capitain anno .49. almost xxiiij. yeeres before the destruction of Hierusalem,

                and after in the time of king Kingilphus anno .636. at Dorchester, and from thence anno .705. remooued vnto Shireborn. And in processe of time vvhen euery particuler Prouince, had his particuler Bishop, then VVerstanus beeing Bishop of Deuon had his Sea at Bishops Tavvton, and after at Crediton.
            And Herstanus Bishop of Cornvvall, had his Sea first

                  Plutarch. de Theseo,
                asvvel for their directions in Religion, as for policyes and morall life. Theseus vvhē he had gathered and assembled into Athenes, his people to reside vvithin the vvalles therof, vvho before, lay scattered abrode in the feelds, he first instituted orders for Religion. Ab dijs auspicatus remp, digessit. And then established such orders and ordinaunces as vvere necessaray for common order of life, and by those meanes, that Citie in processe of time, vvas so fraughted vvith vvise mē, & did so florish vvith good letters: that for learning and knovvledge it became and vvas the Treasury of the vvhole vvorld, and from vvhence the Citie of Roome, and all other vvel gouerned common vvelths took a patern of good gouernment.
            Romulus vvas at the first a ruler and captain of all the Pirates and ruffians in those partes of Italy vvhere he first resided,

                and of such (as some say) as came from out of Greece after the destruction of Troia, vvho hauing reduced them into one societie, and placed them vvithin the Citie of Roome (vvhich he had of purpose builded for them) he made and instituted lavves first for Religiō and then for pollycies: and by the meanes of the straight & due keeping therof, it did so increace, prosper and florish: that it became the Monarchy of the vvhole vvorld, and therfore sayeth Salust.

For all Greece stood at their deuotiō, they for their valiantnesse beeing much feared, and for their iust and vpright dealing moste belooued: in them it lay vvhether it should be vvar or peace. Such commodityes they receiued and such frutes they reaped by the due keeping and obseruing of Licurgus lavves, according to the ansvvere of Apollo. For Licurgus after that he had established and made those his lavves: he vvent vnto the Temple of Apollo in Delphos, and there asked (as the maner vvas then in all doutful matters) vvhether the lavves vvhich he had made vvere sufficient to maintain & keep the common state and Citie of Sparta: vvho vvas aunsvvered that the lavves vvere very good & excellent.

            By these and sundry other like examples it is apparant that as Cities and cōmon vvelths vvere first foūded vpon good gouernment and common societie, for as long as they yeelded to the one, and maintained th'other, they prospered, and men became then not onely valiant and strong, beeing able to vvithstand the enemie: but also vvise, politike and vvelthy, able to maintain the common societie, and the priuat family. Such are the frutes of good gouernmēt, in the magistrate, and of dutiful obedience in the Subiect, and of the maintainance of the common societie in all men. For as the soule giueth life to the body: so dooth lavv dirict the Magistrate and Subiect and keep all things in due order, and therby giue life to a Citie or cōmon vvelth, all vvhich doo perish vvithout it, as the body dyeth beeing depriued of the soule. And therfore vvhen soeuer any Citie dooth decline from the rule of good gouernment in the Magistrate, of dutiful obedience in the Subiect and of contempt of lavves: then be assured, that ruin and destruction of the state ensueth. The moste famouse Citie in all the vvorld, Hierusalem by name, vvhere God as the Prophet

                and in the end the Citie vtterly destroyed, and according to the prophecy not one stone left standing vpō an other.

But forasmuch as it hath pleased God to prosper the state and common vvelth of this Citie (vvhich is novv vnder your gouernment) albeit it haue in times past abiden many stormes, endured great calamities, sustained sundry iniuryes, and beeing subiect to many enemyes hath been sometime in peril and daunger of vtter destruction: yet it hath pleased God of his good vvil to deliuer and rid the same from out of all those perils and in mavvgre of all their enemyes, hath preserued the same from the time of Brutus euen to these our dayes, the same beeing the course of ij. thousand and almoste vij. hundred yeeres.

                As you haue good cause to be thankful to God for the same, vvho vnlesse he doo keep the Citie, Frustra vigilat, Qui custodit eam: So are you to indeuor your selues to continue & folovve in the steps & pathes of your so vvorthy predecessors and prudent ancestors, and to be careful and vigilant that your gouernment may be as vvas theirs in trevv Iudgement and Iustice, free from all couetousnes and void of corruptiō, for vvhy? you are not only the fathers of this common vvelth: but you are Patres conscripti, et Patres iurati, fathers for your vvisdome, trueth & diligence, appointed, called and chosen to this estate, before the rest of all your Citizēs: you haue obliged your self vvith a solemne othe, and bound your selues vvith an open vovv to satisfie your charge and calling.
            Therfore on your partes nothing is to be omitted nor

left vndoon, vvhich in any respect may tend to the maintainaunce of your Citie or preseruation of your cōmon vvelth. And surely I beeing many times priuy of your dooings and present in your coūcels, must needs testifie & vvitnesse your continuall cares and dayly studyes in this behalf: vvhich as they are knovvē in many things: so in no one thing doth the same more appeere, then in the care vvhich you haue for the Orphans and Fatherlesse children, for vvhose preseruation and good education, you of late haue procured a speciall lavv and statute for the same, binding your selues novv by an othe and of devvtie to performe tbat vvhich before vvas but voluntary and of curtesie.

                He caused tvvo yung vvhelpes to be taken from their dam at one time, and instant. The one of them he commaunded to be deliuered to his huntsman, and to be trained vp in hunting. The other vvas deliuered to the Cook to be brought vp in the Kitchin. At length these tvvo vvhelpes beeing brought vp and grovven to be Dogges, and trayned vp as vvas appointed: Licurgus commaunded them bothe to be brought out into an open and a large roume, vvhere he had caused a bush of thornes to be set, and a Hare in the same, as also fast by a pot of

Potage and scraps of meat. And then assemhling his people togither: he commaunded the tvvo Dogges there tied in one line to be let lose and slipped, the one of them vsed to hunting, assoone as he had espyed the Hare: he coursed and follovved him. But the other hauing smelled and seen the potage pot: to that ran he. Then said Licurgus, lo, you see heer tvvo dogges bothe of one age, borne of one dam, and in nature one, and yet by meanes of their vnlike education: they are vnlike in conditions and diuerse in qualities, for according as they vvere brought vp in their youth and beeing vvhelps: so they be disposed and inclyned beeing Dogges.

                namely hovv Vnratislaus King of Bohemia, beeing a godly and a vertuouse Prince, maryed one Dragomira, a vvoman vvicked and heathenish, and not so void of true Religion: as replenished vvith all impudency and vvickednesse. Vnratislaus had by her tvvo sonnes, Venceslaus and Boleslaus, the elder of them vvas brought vp vnder his grnndmother Ludimila (vvho vvas mother to the King, and she a very good and a godly vvoman) vvho careful of the yung Prince, caused him to be nurished and instructed in good letters, vertue and knovvledge. Th'other vvas hrought vp by his mother, and by her instructed and taught in such qualities and conditions as she listed & after her naughtie disposicion. These tvvo yung Gentlemen though borne of the same parents, vvere in nature like, yet in disposicion contrary, for the King their father beeing dead, and the kingdōe deuided betvveen thē: Venceslaus as he vvas educated and instructed in learning, vertue & knovvledge: so did he rule and administer his Realme vprightly in all Iustice, equitie & iudgement. Boleslaus beeing imbrevved at the first vnder his mother in all libertie, losenesse and levvdnesse: became

and vvas a cruel tirant, an oppressor of his Subiects, & void of all vertues and good qualities, appertaining to a King, or a priuate man, and in the end vvas a moste cruel fratricide and a bloody murderer of his naturall brother, vvhome he bereft bothe of life and kingdome.
            And thus it appeereth vvhat education doth, and hovv much it auaileth, vvhich beeing good and vertuouse, if it doo not alltogither alter and chaunge: yet it amendeth the euill dispositions and inclinatiōs in a man: vvhat manner of children and in vvhat sorte they shalbe borne; it lyeth out of mannes povver. Sed vt recta institutione boni euadant, nostrae est potestatis. But in vs it lyeth by good education to make them honest. VVherof Clemens Alexandrinus thus vvriteth.

a lecheror, a drunkard and a foole, and a moste disordered man. Socrates freends standing by and knovving all this to be vntrue, vvere offended and began to threaten him for his sayings, but Socrates stayed them and vvilled them to be contented, saying, he hath spoken nothing but the trueth, for such a one had I been as he sayeth: Nisi me Philosophiae gubernandum tradidissem, and vnlesse learning and vnderstanding had altered my vvicked and levvd disposition. For as it is said, Socrates vvas but a deformed man, his eares and nose like to an Ape,

As Socrates beeing instructed and brought vp in good learning notvvithstanding his corrupt nature and euil disposition, he became and vvas a vertuouse and vvise man: euen so vvho so vvil doo the like shall prooue & be the like.

It is not inough to prouide for the rich and vvelthy, for if you did it not, others inough there be that vvil take that care, but you ar to ꝓuide also for the poor Orphans: vvho vvanting all helpes, frendships and succors, are for vvant of your fatherly and careful prouision in perill either to perish, or to become noysome and vnprofitable members to the common vvelth, for Children left to their ovvne vvilles & disposiciōs, they be as earth vvhich of it self bringeth foorth nothing but bryers and brambles, and in the end,

not onely improfitable to themselues: but also moste noyfull to the common state, they beeing thornes in the sides and pricks in the eyes of the good and honest. God therfore, vvhen hee had giuen the land of promise vnto the Israelites, he gaue them in commaūdement to destroy all thē vvhich they should finde dvvelling in the land vvithout remorse,

                pitie or compassion, because they vvere vvicked, idle and lose people. For sayeth he, they shalbe vvhips in your sides, and thornes in your eyes, vntil you ꝑish out of the lād, vvhich the Lord god hath giuen you. For Idellers and floisterers are but thornes and thistles in a good Citie, and a vvell gouerned cōmon vvelth.
            It is lamentable to see vvhat troupes and clusters of children, boyes and elder persons, lye loytering and floistering in euery corner of the Citie, but more lamentable it is that no care, no order nor redresse is had therof, vvhich if it be not loked vnto in time: it vvil rebound to the peril of the publique state of your Citie. Great shevves haue been made and attempts pretended for erecting of an Hospitall, and for employing of such idle childrē in some honest artes, but of these great blothes commeth small frutes, and of this shaking Hil, GOD graunt their come not forth but a ridiculus Mus. But if you do in deed tender the preseruation of the common state of your Citie and the continuaunce of so honourable and ancient a common vvelth:

                you may not onely acording to the councell of Moyses, rid your Citie of such idelers as vvhervith the same is novv replenished: but you must also remooue and take avvay the cause therof. For the Romains did not onely put to death the vvoman taken in adultery: but also if she did immoderately drinck vvine, because drinking of vvine is a meane to dispose and make the body apt and prone to lust and vvantonnes. Venter maero astuans facile dispumat in libidinem.
               
For vvine as the Phisicions say beeing not moderately taken: hurteth bothe the body & the minde. Ad iram et libidinem precipites facit, et partem animae rationalem hebetem atque turbidam reddit. And it is a cōmon practise of the Phisition, that vvhen the sick patiēt is to be restored to helth, he doth not only purge the corrupt humor or sicknes: but also the humor, vvhich is the origine and cause therof, for othervvise the body cannot recouer his helth. And so in a cōmon vvelth not only Idlers and loyterers are to be exiled and driuen out thereof: but also the occasion and breeding of thē is to be cut of vvhiche is that yung children may be brought vp & be instructed in honest arts, for as of a good plant cometh a good tree, & of good seed cōmeth a good hearb: so of euil plants come bad trees, and of naughtie seedes euil herbes, & these hauing once taken root doo cōmonly so prosper that if they be not vveeded and pulled vp by the rootes: they vvill clene ouergrovv and choke vp the good. Experiēce teacheth that vvher the nettle prospereth: no good herb there grovveth, and vvhere the vveeds ouergrovve: the Garden is destroyed.

            The Romaines had not onely schooles for learning: but also their campos, martios, and common places, vvherin the yung Children and people vvere exercised and inctructed in such honest exercises and disciplines. In quibus nulla erat turpitudo. For it is the speciallest point and the cheefest parte of a good gouernour and a prudent Magistrate to prouide that Children and yung men be by their meanes instructed and brought vp in honest artes, knovvledge & discipline. Ineuntis aetatis inscitia, senum constituenda et regneda est prudentia. And surely the magistrate is no more bounden, but he vvould be as redy to performe the same, if he did or vvould consider, hovv that he is not in this respect a simple and priuat man: but is the father of the common vvelth, Ac personam totius Ciuitatis gerit. And therfore vvel considering his charge: he is to tender the same, and to regarde all sortes of people,
                  Idem ibid.
                vvith a fatherly respect and affection. Ac summos cum infimis pari iuri tenere.
            
            Cicero noteth out of Plato, tvvo speciall precepts incident and moste necessary in a Magistrate and gouernour, th'one is, that vvithout respect, he doo cheefly tender the vtilitie and profit of all and euery of his Citizens: the other is, that he doo also consider the saftie of the body of the Citie, for the gouernment

of a common vvelth is moste like to the Tutorship of a yung pupil, vvhose gouernour and Tutor is to doo, such and all maner of things vvhich may tend & be for the best behoof and ꝓfit of the pupil: & for that cause is he called a tutor,
                  Institutis de tutelis & tutores.
                
               quasi tuitor, that is to say a careful defendor and a diligent preseruer, bothe for the good educatiō of their personages and of vvhat so euer to them appertaineth, & so ought the magistrate vvho beeing the generall Tutor is the eye of the vvhole Citie, and therfore must beholde and see euery particuler mans cause, he is the eare and mouth of the vvhole body, and therfore is to hear all and to speake for all, he is the head of the vvhole common vvelth: and therfore must vnderstand and direct euery man in his estate and calling. Sic enim remp. tueri debet, vt omnibus consulat.
            
            Many good orders I confesse haue been deuised by the prudent Magistrates and gouernours of this Citie for the good gouernment bothe of the elder sorte and of such yung Orphans, as vnto vvhome any vvelth is left, and vvho are to inioy the benefit of their parents trauels: but suche Orphanes, vvho hauing nothing left vnto thē, & beeing destitute of all releef and help: ar left to their ovvne dispositiōs, these as I said, I say again, svvarme in clusters in euery corner and quarter of your Citie, and for vvant of good education and nurturing, doo grovve to be thornes and thistles: and vvho as the Caterpillers, Frogs, grashoppers and lice of Egipt,

And for these there is no care, no regarde nor account made▪ but you beeing the fathers of this common vvelth: it is your parte and bounden dutie to prouide also for the education, instruction, & vvhat soeuer is necessary for such, not onely in respect of the safetie and

preseruation of this Citie: but also because God him self, vvho is the father of the Fatherlesse,
                  Psalme. 68.
                hath giuen vnto you beeing his ministers the charge ouer them, and beeing a percel of your talent, and a portion of your office: you are and shall render for them an account before the high God at the latter day,

                  Gaufrede. Grafton.
                a man very vvel learned, yet beeing of Dedalus climing minde, vvould needs flee vp in to Heauen, and haue his seate there, and therfore framed vnto himselfe vvings to flee, but he vvas no sooner mounted vp tovvards his iourney: but that he fel dovvne and brake his neck. Ambicion brought Antichriste in to the Church of God,
                  2. Thessal. 2.
                and exalted the sonne of perdicion aboue God. Ambicion raised vp the vnpreaching Pashur, against the preaching Ieremy, & the vvicked Amaziah,
                  Ierem. 2. Amos. 7. 1. Esdras. 6.
                against the godly Amos, and the enuious Sisennes, against good Esdras. Ambicion hath been the only cause of so many & of the infinit tragedies, vvhich from age to age, and from time to time, haue been vvithin this realme of England, vvher of the

histories and Chronicles of the same, are ful fraughted and replenished. And therfore to cōclude: Insolens res plenaque intemperantiae,
               
                  Omphalius de propugreip.

                   libido, quae nullis legibus constringi nullaque virtute potest retineri. Then if ambicion be so dangerous and fovvle a vice, beeing not to be brideled by any lavve, nor ruled by any vertue: it is the parte of euery priuate man, much more of him vvhich bereth rule and is in authoritie, that although he do excel in vvisedome, knoledge, learning, and other the good gifts of the minde, or doo exceed in riches, substance, and possessions, and other the giftes of Fortune, vvhich as the Prophet saieth, doo make men to svvel, Diuitiae si affluant apponunt cor, yet that they doo not exalte them selues, nor be high minded, nor yet disdaining all others ambiciously, to seek dominion and to rule the roste, for such men being very vnmeet to rule, and vnfit to gouerne, shall & vvilbe Remorae, & hinderaunces to good gouernment. There is another kinde of Remora, vvhich is named Auarice or couetousnes,
                  Auarice.
                & this is an infaciable desire of the minde, to gather and heap vp riches, vvelth, and possessions, making no conscience hovv, or by vvhat meanes, the same is gotten,
                  Cicero. 3. Paradox.
                but alvvaies careful to get, and fereful to loose. And in this auarice, there be three things cōcurrant, an insaciable desire of filthie lucre and gain, vsing and seeking all the meanes and vvaies they can, be it by right or by vvrong, they passe not so they haue it. The second is tenacitie, and a greedy minde, to keep, hoord, and lay vp in store that vvhich is gotten, making it as it vvere a GOD, and vvherupon the vvhole mīde is fixed and set,
                  Math. 6. Ephe. 5. 1. Timoth. 6.
                as the Scripture saith, vbi thesaurus ibi et cor. and this man beeing in the vvickednes of his greedy affection, a plain Idolater, maketh

shipvvrack of his faith, and is drovvned in vtter destruction. The third is, illiberalitie, vvhich is a pinching & a spare spending, pretending allvvaies a vvant and scarsitie, vnles it be in an evel cause, or to an euel end. The man possessed vvith this vvicked spirit or affection, is named avarus. Quasi auium aven

This Echinus, vvas contented to yeld to all conditions, and promised to parfourme all couenaunts, but being once entred in to the hovvse: it vvas not long before he had forgotten all promises, and practiseth all the vvaies he may: hovv to obtaine his purpose, vvherfore he buskleth vp himself, and by litle and litle goeth about the house, & at length ful boldely seeketh euery place, and sercheth euery corner, but the Serpent, vvhose dainty and soft skin could not abide the sharp prickles of this churlish hedge hog: is driuē to leap from corner to corner and notvvithstanding she hisseth at him, and challenging her promises: dooth burden hī vvith vnkīdnes, yet it auaileth not, for she is so long driuen from corner, to corner: and from place to place, that at length she is clene shifted out of the doores & sent packīg to seek a nevv lodging.
            And so fareth it vvith all such as doo or shall deale vvith a greedy couetous man, and a churlish hedgehog, for be a man neuer so prudent poletique and vvel adourned vvith vertues and honestie, let him deale neuer so frendly courteously and liberally, yet if the couetouse man do ones season & take holde of hī he vvil as sure as the hedgehog by one meanes or

other vnder minde him of his possessions, bereft him of his thrift, and in the end driue him out of his house and home, for he is like vnto the Ivie, vvhose nature is to begin and to take roote first vnder the root of a tree, vvhich at the first being but litle, and the leaues gentle and small: springeth vp vvithout any harme felt therby and girdeth the tree round about, neuer ceassing vntil he cōe vp to the top, & thē hauing thus entred vnder the root, guirded the body & seased vpon the top, be the tree neuer so great & mightie: the Iuie ouercometh him, & he dieth. And so this couetous Iuie begīneth as it vvere hūbly & lovvly, vvith smooth vvoords, & offereth all curtesies, but by litle & litle, he so bevvrappeth the yung gentleman vvith his money, & girdeth him vvith his bōds: that in the end he hath the mastery, and the yung gentle man of a tree is become a small stick, to raunge the feeld and to tip daysies beeing novv in his doublet & his hose, redy to trip a pauian in Hamons court, and to daunce a galliard in Tibornes bovver. This is the nature of this churlish Echinus, of this creeping Iuie, and of this pernicius Echineis vvhose delight & only felicitie is set vpon heaping vp of the vvicked māmona euē to th'uter ruin of so many as shall deale vvith hī. And stil as a vvicked Echineis is stickīg to the keel of filthy lucre & gaine.

            And such mē may be compared to a certein kinde of Svvallovves, named Apodes, or Depodes, as vvho saith, birds vvithout legges, not because they vvāt legges: but because they vse them not, and theise in english are called the bank martinet, or svvallovve, but the harroldes, as also Sir Thomas Eliot name theim Martlets. The nature of theise is to be alvvaies fleeing vpon the vvaters, 
                  •
               nd commonly no ship saileth so far at the seas, but that theis Apodes, or Martinet, is also there fleeing. Nunquam enim tam longe tā

capit, of all birds he is indocilis as Plinie saith, and not to be framed or to be taught to any thing. They doo flee meeting one th'other, as it vvere enccountrīg to fight, but indeed nothing else thē to hunt for flies, vvhich is their onely meate and food. Insidiantur mus

                  is atque culicibus quarum venationem sibi proponunt et quibus volando pascuntur, They are seen onely in the somer season, for in the vvinter they are gone. they doo breed in such holes as they cā finde alredy made, in the bancks, for nestes they build not.
            And such an Apodes is the couetous rich man, vvho though he haue legges: yet for to doo good vvanteth thē, for to visit the sick, to releeue the poore, to contribute to the oppressed, to redeem the captiue, or to doo any good thing: he is lame and he cannot go. But for gaine and proffit, hath vvings to flee as far as any ship can saile. He cannot sleep nor quietly take his rest, because his minde is so pensiue and careful for his muck, and from the greedy looue vvherof, he by no parsuasion or reasons to be dissuaded: nor yet framed to do any good thīg, for he is indocil & not to be framed thervnto. He is vvelpleased to be harbored in euery other mans house, & to be fed at other mennes tables, but to harbour others he hath no skil, and to keep hospitaltie, is against his vvil: & notvvithstanding, his toyling, and turmoyling: he fleeth but after flies, and that vvhich in the day of the Lord shall litle auaile him.

                But as Saint Iames saith: theire golde and siluer shalbe cankred: and the rust of them shall be a vvitnes against them, & shall eate their flesh, as it vvere fire.
            Then if this be so foule a vice, so hainous a faulte, and so horrible a sin, in a priuat man: hovv much more intollerable is it in a magistrate & a gouenour. For the higher a man

is in authoritie: the greater is the offence vvhich he committeth. Quanto quis conspectior. tāto maius in se

                  Esay. 5 Deutro. 16.
                because (as saith the Prophet) he iustifieth the vvicked, and giueth sentence for revvards.
            God, therfore commaundeth that none should be a ruler in Israel, but such as should iudge the people rightuously, and not vvrest the lavve, nor respect any person, nor take any revardes. For revvards blinde the eyes of the iust and peruert the vvords of the rightuous. VVo vvorth then to that vvarren, vvhere the Polcat is the vvarriner, to that flock vvherof the VVolf is the Sheepheard, & that common vvelth vvhere the carmorose and insaciable couetous man, is the ruler and gouernour. For such men be the Remorae vvhich sticking and cleuing to the keele of the ship: vvil not permit or suffer the common vvelth to proceed and prosper in good gouernement. These be the Adamant stones vvhich can doo nothing but dravv vnto them the cancred mettalle of filthy lucre and gain, vvhich shall in the end as much auaile them: as did the great store vnto Midas, and the great plenty vnto Tantalus. The one of them hauing infinit treasure, vvas yet so insaciable: that he prayed GOD that vvhatsoeuer he touched, might be Golde. And hauing his request: the meat & drink vvhervvith he shoulde be fed, the apparel vvhervvith he should be clothed, and finally, vvhatsoeuer he touched: vvas turned to Golde, and so miserably thirsting for Golde, and hungring for riches: he vvas

famished in abundance, and perished in plenteousnes. The other likevvise abounding in vvelth and riches, and yet neuer satisfied: is fained by the Poets, to stand in a goodly Riuer in hel, vp to the hard chin, and ouer his hed, a treeful of all delectable frutes, euen falling in to his mouth. And yet reaching to take an apple, the tree riseth vp and goeth from him. And likevvse, vvhen he putteth dovvn his mouth to drink: the riuer shrinketh and fleeteth from him, according as it is vvritten by the Poet.

And therfore as that vvater, vvhich issueth out of a venimous spring or fountaine, cannot be holsome: no more can that gouernment be good and prosperous, vvhich is directed and cometh from a couetous magistrate, and a gteedy governor.
            If therfore, you vvil haue your gouernment to be assured, your Citie to prosper, & your good deuices to take effect and good successe: take heed and bevvare of this Remora and let him not be suffered to stick & cleue to your ship, nor haue place in your counsells.
            There is also a third kinde of Remora, and is named anger malice, or displeasure,
                  Anger.
                vvhich is a malicious disposicion of the minde, not liking nor pleased: but greeued, and offended either for some iniury and offence doone or supposed to be doon: and therfore is altogether set to be reuenged seeking

by all meanes hovv to compas the same, by deuice or by vvord, or by act or by all. VVhich beeing so euel an affection, and so far from right reason: Plato defineth to be a violent force of an vnresonable minde, vvith out all order or reason.

                This affection as the Philosophers say: hath his seat & being in the hart, for vnto the soule, they doo attribute three faculties. The first is reason, vvhich is placed in the hed. The second is that vvhich vvanteth, & is vvithout reason: and is named anger,

others be vvise, sober, gentle, and pacient, and free from those angry and furious dispositions: that the cōmon vvelth be not by him hindered, and that he himselfe non incidat in morositatem inutilem et odiosam: & so alltogether vnable to doo any good, for the man fretized vvith anger, and choked vvith choler: dooth nothing vvel, & therfore saith Cicero absit ira procul, cum qua nihil recte, nihil considerate fieri potest.

                  Nos autem tenores dicti actus Parliamēti nostri ac omnia et singula in eodem contenta ad requisitionem Maioris, Balliuorum et Gomitatis Ciuitatis Exon duximus exemplificandum per presentes. In cuius rei testimonium has literas nostras fierifecimus Patentes teste meipsa apud Westmonasterium tertio die Maij, anno regni nostri, quinto.
               
            
         
         
            
            The Statutes, decrees and ordinaunces, made decreed and established by the Mayor and the xxiiij. of the common councel of the Citie of Excester, for and concerning the ordering of Orphans and of all such goods and Cattels as to them appertaineth, within the Citie of Excester and libertyes of the same.
            
               
                  FIrst it is ordayned that what soeuer benefit dooth growe to the Childe of any frée man of the Citie of Excester, whether it be by lands,
                  All the goods and lands appertaining vnto any are wholy in the gouernance of the Mayor & xxiiij.
                or goods, or legacyes, or whether it be from father or mother, or straungers, or whether the Parents liuing or dead, the same shalbe wholly in the order and gouernaunce of the Mayor and xxiiij. of the common councel.
            ¶Also within one Moneth after the death of any frée man the Executor or Administrator shalbe warned by an Officer therfore appointed (called the common Cryer) to appéere before the Mayor and xxiiij. at the next Court day to be holden,
                  The Executor or Administrator to be warned to bring in the Testament by a day.
                and then and there shalbe boūden by Recognisance to bring into the Court at a certain day by them, then to be appointed, the last wil or Testament and Inuentory of the Testator and that before the Executrix (if she be a Widow) doo mary.
            ¶Also if the Executor so warned by the common Cryer to appéere at a certain day appointed before the Mayor and xxiiij. doo it not, or refuse to doo it,
                  The Executor refusing to appeer to be committed to prisō
                  
                that then he or they so refusing and not appéering, to be committed to Prison and there to remaine vntil he doo enter in bond or Recognisance with sufficient suretyes to bring in the Wil or Testament and Inuentory in maner as is before declared.
            ¶Also it is ordred that when any Inuentory is to be made
                  Praisers to be appointed and sworne by the Aldermen of the warde.
                the Praysers of the goods of euery such Testator shalbe appointed

by the Alderman or his Deputie of that warde in whiche the Testator dyed and dwelled, and which Praysers shall dwell also in thesame warde and before they doo make any praisemēt, they shalbe sworne to value and praise the goods indifferently.
            
               
                  The Executor is to be sworne that the Inuentory is true.
               ¶Also the Inuentory béeing brought in by the Executor or Administrator at the day and time prescribed the said Executor or Administrator shalbe sworne that the Inuentory is iust and true which othe is to be ministred by the common Sergeant.
            ¶The maner of the othe to be exhibited to the said Executor or Administrator is this.
                  The othe of the Executor.
                You shall sweare that you haue truely presented and shewed foorth to the Praysers by the Alderman or his Deputy of the warde appointed, all such goods, cattels, money, plate, Iewels, houshold stuf, wares, merchandise, Leases and what so euer other goods as were your last Testators, you haue left out no money, you haue charged him with no dets to be 
                  〈◊〉
                or desperate, which you doo think in your conscience to be good dets, but you haue doon all things vprightly and truely, as an Executor ought to doo. So God help you and by the contents of this booke. And if he, she or they doo refuse to be thus sworne, that they by the Mayor be committed to warde.
            ¶Also when the Inuentory is receiued togither with the wil or Testament,
                  The common Sergeant is to deduct all the dets and funerals out of the whole goods.
                which is also to be brought in and exhibited. The common Sergeāt shall deduct out of the whole Inuentory, the dets, and so much funerals as according to the substance is allowed, and that doon: shall deuide the whole residue into thrée partes, wherof th'one third to be to the wife, one other third to the Children, and the last third reserued for the performance of the wil of the Testator.
            
               The Testator hauing no wife the goodꝭ must be deuided in to two partes.¶Also if the Testator had no wife at the time of his death, then the goods shalbe deuided but into two partes, wherof th'one moitie shalbe reserued to the Children, and th'other moitie to be reserued to the Testator. The like is if the testator be a widow.
            ¶Also when the common Sergeant hath thus deuided the

third parte or the one moitie for the Children,
                  The common Seargeant is to examin the wil for the legacyes / if any be giuen to any Orphan.
                then he hath also to examine and peruse the Wil and Testament for Legacyes, and if he finde any to be giuen to the Children or to any of them ouer and abooue the third parte due vnto them, then shal he giue that in charge, and shall demaund and require suretyes aswell for the legacy as for the Orphanage.
            ¶Also in taking of Suretyes there may be no fewer then foure to be taken in euery Recognisance for euery Orphanage or Legacy if the summe therof doo amount and be one hundred pounds.
                  Foure suretyes to be taken in euery Recognisance of an hundred poūd.
               
            
            And there shall not be abooue one hundreth pounds in any 
                  •
               ne Recognisance,
                  Euery suretie must be worth the principall.
                and euery Suretie taken shalbe by the consideration of the Court worth the principall.
            ¶Also euery Recognisance to be taken and acknowledged must be taken to the Chamberlain for the time béeing,
                  Euery Recognisance must be taken to the Chamberlain but before the Mayor & xxiiij.
                but before the Mayor and Common councell, who must be aduised of the state and abilitie of euery Suretie.
            ¶Also if the funeralls doo passe and surmoūt the portion appointed for a man of that substance,
                  Funerals more then ordinary 
                        〈◊〉
                      they be to be 
                        〈◊〉
                     .
                then the ouerplus whiche was not deducted of the whole Inuentory: shalbe deducted out of the Testators parte as the Legacyes be. And if such ouerplus of the funeralls doo surmount the Testators third parte, then euery one which is to receiue and haue any Legacy, shall beare his parte and portion after the rate.
            ¶Prouided neuerthelesse that the funeralls doo not excéed nor surmount the ordinary appointed.
            ¶Also euery yéere on the Munday next after Midlent Sunday there shalbe kept before the Mayor and Common councell of the Citie, the generall court of Orphans,
                  A generall Court of Orphans to be kept yeerly on the monday in mid Lent.
                at which all sureties vpon any Recognisance shalbe called and if they make any defaulte so that no one suretie doo appéere, for euery one Recognisance, that thē the surties to pay ij d. for euery pound of so much as they stand bounden for. And then the Mayor and common

councel, or the more parte of them may at their pleasure vpon reasonable causes of default of abilitie to cause them to put in further Suretyes.
            ¶Also if any Orphane doo mary before full age without lycense of the Court,
                  Euery Orphan maryed with out licence is to be deducted of some part of the portion for a fine.
                then there shalbe deducted out of euery pound due by Recognisance, or of so muche money as shall remain in the custody of the Citie xij.d. and the same to be forfaited to the vse of the Chamber, and if any womā childe beeing an Orphan and vnder the age of xxj. yéeres, after the death of her father, doo either contract and insure her self in mariage, or doo perfectly consumate and solemnise the same with any frée man without consent of the Mayor and Court, that then for euery suche default so committed béeing sufficiently prooued by two witnesses or confessed by the parties, or otherwise wel knowē to the Mayor and Court, shall forfait, forgo and lose of euery pound due to her for her Orphanage the sum of xij.d. to the vse of the Chamber of the said Citie. And if any such contract or Mariage be had and made with any forrain, and not béeing frée of said Citie at the time of the said contract or mariage, that then the Orphan to forfait and forgo of euery pound of her portion iij.s. of which one xij.d. of euery pound to be to the vse of the Chamber, and the other ij.s. of euery pound to be to the vse of such other Orphan or Orphans as shall then remain vnmaryed, béeing the brothers sisters or compartenes with the 
                  •
               aid so maryed or contracted Orphan, and for such default to the next of the kindred.
            
               
                  Children maried and hauing been aduaūced are not to haue any childes parte.
               ¶Also all suche Children as are maryed in the lifetime of the Father and haue accepted any aduaūcement, shall not be partakers of any portion after the death of his father, except he, she or they, haue the fathers hand or mark in writing to the contrary. And in that case, he, she or they, shall haue so much to that which they had already receiued as to make vp therewith a whole parte, which they are to recouer of the Executors, by bill or plaint before the Mayor and common councel wherin no wager of Law, protection. &c. Prouided that what soeuer the Testator giueth to his wife in Iointer or to his Childe vnmaryed is not to be accounted for any aduauncement, vnlesse the father

doo by expresse woords giue it to his Childe as for his ful Childes parte and portion.
