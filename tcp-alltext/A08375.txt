            To the Right Worshipfull, Sir Iohn Harper, Knight, all true prosperity.
            
               RIght worshipfull, I may not bee forgetful of the loue which you haue shewed towardes the furtherance of my indeuours, for the Grammar-schoole. Accept therfore this small pledge of my thankefull acknowledgement. Though it be little in valew and in the esteem of the most, yet the b

wisdome, yea such, as whereof they may haue worthie vse, all their dayes, in what place soeuer they shall be imployed; And may moreouer haue euery point & part of the learning in it, so imprinted in their memories as they shall neuer forget them, but haue them, as it were liuely before their faces: That so they may learne to embrace the vertues therein taught and to flee the vices, to foresee dangers and how to auoid them, to behaue themselues wisely and discreetly in the whole course of their life. As for example, to giue a taste hereof; in the first fable of the cock esteeming a barley corne aboue a precious stone, to see the foolishof men, especially of children preferring play before learning, a little pleasure and folly, before the most exellent and diuine wisdome:

to teach them to followe after and to embrace learning and wisedome, euen from their tender yeares, and to be ashamed of misspending their precious time in play and idle vanities. So in the second fable of the wolfe and the lambe, to teach them to take heede all their life long how they haue to deale with or any way prouoke cruell men, that are too hard for them: Because they, when they list, can take any occasion to prey vpon them, or to doe them a mischiefe, and that this is matter enough, If they bee not able to resist them. Thus likewise in the third fable of the mouse and the frog, being at war together, about the regiment of the marish ground, vntill the kite snatch them both away and deuoure them, to teach children in all their time to beware

of discord and dissension with others, especially contention for superiority & preferment: Because such vsually as will goe to wa

And but onely to name the fourth, In the Apologue of the dogge swimming ouer the riuer, which through ouer much greediness, chopping at the shadowe of the flesh which he sawe in the water, lost the flesh it selfe which hee carried in his chops, to teach children alwaies to take heed of too much greedinesse, and euer to keep a measure in their desi

For the manner of effecting hereof, I haue set it downe shortly in the Epistle to the Reader, and more fully in my Grammar-schoole.

Which you accepting accordingly I shal be more incouraged to striue forward for perfecting of the whole, and to spend my last thoughts for the commō good. And thus with all thankefull acknowledgement vnto your self with your worthy Lady and all yours I humbly take my leaue, and rest

            To the painefull Schoolemaster.
            FIrst, cause your scholar, by reading this translation, to tell you in euery fable what the matter of the fable is. Secondly, to what ende and purpose it was inuented, what it is to teach, and what wisedome hee can learne out of it. Thirdly, how to make a good report of the fable, both in English and Latine, especially in English. Fourthly and lastly, to make right vse of it, for all matters concerning Grammar, as for construing, parsing, making and proouing the Latine; and so for reading forth of English into Latine, according to the directions in my former translations, as namely▪ in Sententiae▪ Ca

the Latine phrase, I haue referred to the margent, with an Asteriske or little Star: and variety of English phrase, I haue set also in the margent, noted with a little r. But for these I referre you to that which I haue written in my former translations, and in my Grammarschole. Vouchsafe mee your better derection, in loue; and what is defectiue, I shall (God willing) labour to supply in the next edition.
