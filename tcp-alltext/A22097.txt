            ¶A Proclamation conteyning his Maiesties
Royall pleasure, concerning the proiect of Dying and Dressing of Broad
Cloathes within the Kingdome, before they be exported.
            
               
                  IT was the worke of one of Our noble Progenitors
King Edward the third, to conuert the Woolls of this Kingdome
formerly vented raw, into Cloath, thereby to purchase vnto
Our louing Subiects the profite, arising aswell vpon the Manufacture,
as vpon the Materiall, and to set Our owne people on worke
for their better sustentation and comfort; And it is likewise Our
desire, That it should be the worke of Our times, to ordaine and prouide, that all Broad
Cloathes may bee Died and Dressed within Our Kingdome before they bee Exported;
whereby aswell the second gaine of Manufacture, as the first, with all the incidents thereof,
may come wholly to the benefit of Our louing Subiects, in whose riches and good estate
Wee shall alwayes thinke Ourselues rich and happy. Neither is the increase of profite
vpon this great Staple commoditie onely in Our Princely eye and cogitation; But Wee
foresee likewise, that when Our Cloathes shalbe Transported and dispersed by Our Subiects
immediatly into all the Markets of the world, where they are worne and vsed, it must
encrease exceedingly Our Nauigation and Nauie, so that not onely wealth, but honour,
strength and industrie will euidently follow vpon that which We propound to Our selues;
That as the Kings Our Progenitors, haue had the wisedome and Iudgement to see and
discerne the good that might come thereof; So neuerthelesse, either through difficultie or
misinformation, they haue not perfected, nor throughly pursued the worke intended, as may
appeare by the good and politique Lawes that haue bene Enacted concerning the same on
the one part, and the ancient and Inueterate Toleration and Dispensation with the saide
Lawes, which haue bene from time to time put in vre on the other part: Wee therefore
being desirous to aduance and perfect so excellent a worke, haue resolued to leaue no meanes

vnperformed, either by aduise of Parliament or otherwise of Our selues, which may conduce
thereunto, by those safe degrees which in so great a worke are requisite; Wherein
though We finde no small difficulties, as it vseth to come to passe in the best workes, specially
in their beginnings, yet We doubt not but to ouercome the same without hazard or inconuenience
vnto the present, for hope or desire of the future.
            And because opinion is sometime more harmefull then trueth, and that it may bee doubted
by some, that there may ensue some stand of Cloathes, whereby so many families of
Our louing Subiects are maintained, or at least, some fall of Prices, to the preiudice, both of
the Cloathier, and owner of Woolles in the meane time, betweene the diuerting of the old
course, and setling of the new: Wee doe therefore publish vnto all Our louing Subiects, by
these presents, that they shall not need to feare any such consequence, either in such stand of
Cloath, or abatement of Prices, as may be to their preiudice. And therefore, they may

                  〈◊〉
                on in the courses of their former Trading, leauing it to Our care and prouidence to int
                  •••
               uce
this great and happy alteration to the better, without any interruption of Trade,
or pulling downe of Price in the meane time. Furthermore although we are setled in Our
resolution to effect this worke, yet would Wee not haue it construed that Wee haue any other
opinion of the Company of Merchants Aduenturers, which haue long managed
the Trade of Cloathes vndressed, then as of those that haue wel deserued of Our state; neither
of any Our neighbours, who haue had correspondencie with them, and bought the
Cloath from them to serue the Markets abroad, then as of men, that were affected vnto the
good of their owne people, as it is naturall for men to be. Neither are Wee ignorant that
the state of Cloathing is at this time as flourishing and valuable as hath beene knowen;
but onely Wee are willing to aduance the Dowrie and Stocke of Our Kingdome: And
where Wee see apparent meanes of doing Our people further good, not to tie Our selues
to the simple and positiue degree of their welfare, but to proceed from good to better, and to
make posteritie beholding to Our times, for going through with that, whereof Our Auncestours
haue onely sowen the seedes, and not hitherto reaped the fruits.
            
               Giuen at Our Palace of Westminster the fiue and twentieth day of May in the
twelfth yeere of Our Reigne of Great Britaine, France, and Ireland.
               
God saue the King.
