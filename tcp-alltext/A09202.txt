               eretofore of your gratious favour: and evidently knowen your Princely and Generous inclination, to all good Learning and excellencie. I am emboldened once againe, to offer vp at the Altar of your gratious acceptance these mine Emblemes: a weake (I confesse,) and a worthlesse Sacrifice, though an assured pledge, of that Zeale and Duetie, I shall for ever most Religiouslie owe vnto your Highnes: shewing herein rather a will to desire, then worth to deserue, so peerelesse a patronage. Howsoever the world shall esteeme them in regard of their rude and homely attire, for the most part they are Roially discended, and repaire into your owne bosome (farre from the reach of Envie) for their protection. For in truth they are of right your owne, and no other then the substance of those Divine Instructions, his Maiestie your Royall Father praescribed vnto you, your guide (as that golden branch to AENEAS,

It is now two yeares since I presēted vnto your Highnes some of them, then done by me into Latine verse, with their pictures drawen and limned by mine owne hand in their liuely coulours; wherein, as neere as I could, I obserued the Method of his Maiesties BASILICON DORON, but by reason of the great number I had since that, newly invented: with some others collected, (tieng my inven

I dare not discourse at large vnto your Highnes, of the manifold Vse, Nature, Libertie, and ever esteemed exellencie of this kind of Poesie: it being the rarest, and of all others the most ingenious, and wherein, the greatest Princes of the world, many times haue most happily exercised their Invention: because I doubt not, but your Highnes already knoweth whatsoever I might speak herein. Onely what I haue done, I most humbly offer vp the same vnto your gratious view, and protection. Desiring of GOD to beautifie and enrich your most hopefull & Heroique minde, with the divinest giftes of his grace, and knowledge, heartily wishing, there were any thing in me, worthy of the least favour, and respect of so excellent a Prince.

            To the Reader.
            
               I haue heere (kind Reader) sent abroad vnto thy view, this volume of Emblemes, whether for greatnes of the chardge, or that the Invention is not ordinarie: a Subiect very rare. For except the collections of Master Whitney, and the translations of some one or two else beside, I know not an Englishman in our age, that hath published any worke of this kind: they being (I doubt not) as ingenious, and happy in their invention, as the best French or Italian of them all. Hence perhaps they terme vs Tramontani Sempii, Simple and of dull conceipt, when the fault is neither in the Climate, nor as they would haue it, in the constitution of our bodies, but truely in the cold & frozen respect of Learning, and artes, generally amongst vs: comming far shorte of them in the iust valewing of well deseruing qualities. To begin at the foote of their Alpes, and so discend by Germanie (which Bodine truly termeth officinam hominum, a shoppe of absolute men for all Artes) how she hath excelled in this, as in all other rare Invention, witnesse the many volumes she hath sent vs over of this Subiect. With what excellent Bodies, and Motto's, haue the Netherlandes especially Holland, and Zealand, vpon sundry occasions (as the recoverie of their Libertie, the overthrow in eighty eight, and the like) commended their Invention to the world? as we finde in Meteranus, and others. I should seeme partiall, if I should lay to your view, the many and almost vnimitable Impresa's of our owne Countrie: as those of Edward the black Prince, Henry the fourth, Henry the seuenth, Henry the eight, Sir Thomas Moore, the Lord Cromwell, & of later times, those done by Sir Phillip Sydney, and others. Nor were it needefull since their Memory is fresh, and many of their sheildes yet scarce drie in the world. Who hath ever seene more wittie, proper, & significant devises, then those of Scotland? (to omit more auntient times) as that of King Iames the third, devising for himselfe (to expresse the care he had of his country and People) a Hen sitting over her Chickens, with the word Non dormit qui custodit: as also of Iames the fowrth, taking to himselfe a bifront, or double face, plac't vpon the top of a Columne: the heades crowned with Laurell, the word Vtrumque: meaning (as

it is thought) he would constantly, and advisedly like Ianus, obserue the proceedings aswell of the French as the English, holding them both at that time in Ielousie. Many and very excellent haue I seene of his Maiesties owne Invention, who hath taken herein in his yonger years great delight, and pleasure, by which thou maiest see, that we are not so dull as they would imagine vs, nor our Soile so barren as that we neede to borrow from their Sunne-burnt braines, our best Invention. Whereas I haue heere dedicated many Emblemes to sundry and great Personages, (yea some to Forraigne Princes,) I haue heerein but imitated the best approued Authours in this kind: as Alciat, Sambucus, Iunius, Reusnerus, and others: they being such, as either in regard of their transcendent dignitie, and vertues, deserue of all to be honoured: or others whome for their excellent parts and qualities, I haue ever loued, and esteemed: or lastly some of my private friendes, to whome I haue in particular beene most beholden some way or other. Wherein I trust thou wilt not condemne me, since I haue no other meane then by word to shew a thankfull minde towards them.
            It is not my intent here (which I might well doe) to diseourse at large of the Nature and Libertie of Embleme, wherein it differeth from the Impresa; because heerein I haue beene alreadie prevented by Paulns Iovius. Sambucus. Mr. Sam. Daniell. others. The true vse heereof from time to time onely hath beene, Vtile dulci miscere, to feede at once both the minde, and eie, by expressing mistically and doubtfully, our disposition, either to Loue, Hatred, Clemencie, Iustice, Pietie, our Victories, Misfortunes, Griefes, and the like
                  •
                which perhaps could not haue beene openly, but to our praeiudice revealed. And in truth the bearer heerein doth but as the Travailer, that changeth his Silver into Gold, carry about his affection in a narrow roome, and more safely; the valew rather bettered then abated.
            Accept I pray thee in good worth, what I haue heere done, not for any hope of reward, or gaine, but onely for thy pleasure, and recreation, Imagining thou art delighted (as I haue ever beene my selfe) with these ever esteemed, honest, and most commendable Devises.
            
               Thine assuredly, HENRY PEACHAM.

               On cognoit des grands Dieux ou l' aise ou la doleur,
               A ces pourtraicts astres, que le Ciel nous figure:
               Et leurs fils, ces Herôs de leur noble valeur,
               En leurs riches blasons tousiours ont quelque Augure.
               Tel fust l' ancien devis, qui premier fust parleur
               Des Misteres plus beaux, la voix et l' escriture,
               Luy servoient cōme aux Dieux, d' un servile MERCVRE
               Truchemens à qui manque et le vray sens et l' heur.
               PEACHAM, ce beau devis est ton choix, et ta Muse;
               Les points Hebreux, le traicts dont le MEMPHITIQVE vse,
               Ains Diue mesme, et le Ciel, t' apprend ce stile vieux
               Que tu peux bien nommer, la MINERVE BRETONNE;
               Car par dessus la Grecque, on luy doibt Couronne;
               Si le filer n' est plus, que le scavoir de. Dieux.

               PALLAS thou hast a second champion bred,
               As great in Artes, as was stout DIOMED
               In Armes; that gainst enraged MARS could stand,
               And dar'd to wound faire VENVS in the hand:
               The ARGIVE fleete his sole Arme could defend,
               And with the Gods he durst alone contend;
               All this thy influence gaue, and more desired,
               Like power thou hast into this braine inspired:
               Thy champion too, whose Artes are fam'd as farre,
               As was TYDIDES for his deedes of warre.
               We know thou art MINERVA that alike
               Hold'st Artes and Armes, canst speake as well as strike.

                  And most perspicuous through intelligence.
                  Foresight, foreseeth harmes, that may ensue:
                  Insight, doth yeild to reason what is due.
               
               
                  
                  Then let not men deeme all with corp'rall ei'ne,
                  Eies may deluded be by false illusions:
                  Eies may be partiall, eiesight may decline
                  By weakenes, age, or by abusions.
                  Pride, envie, folly, may the sight pervert,
                  And make the eie transgresse against the heart.

                  Me thought I saw in dead of silent night
                  A goodly Citie all to cinders turned,
                  Vpon whose ruines sate a Nymphe in white,
                  Rending her haire of wiery gold, who mourned
                  Or for the fall of that faire Citie burned,
                  Or some deare Loue, whose death so made her sad:
                  That since no ioye in worldly thing she had.
               
               
                  This was that GENIVS of that auntient TROY,
                  
                  In her owne ashes buried long agoe:
                  So grieu'd to see that BRITAINE should enioy
                  Her PALLAS, whom she held and honour'd so:
                  And now no litle memorie could show
                  To eternize her, since she did infuse,
                  Her Enthean soule, into this English Muse.

                  We dar'd to touch, and yet did saue our selues.
               
               
                  HENRY, who art both Load-stone, and the starre,
                  Of Heartes and Eies, our wished Loue and Light:
                  By thee conducted, we arriue thus farre;
                  That now OPINIONS vttermost despight,
                  Nor ENVIE, that the iustest one doth bite,
                  We doubt at all; but forth into the maine,
                  With doubled courage, put our selues againe.
               
               
                  And you great PRINCESSE, through whose Christall brest,
                  ELIZAS Zeale, and Pietie doe shine,
                  Heire of her Name, and Virtues, that invest
                  You in our Heartes, and Loues immortall shrine:
                  Oh send from that pure Maiestie of thine,
                  Those beames againe, from whence (as PHOEBVS bright)
                  Our feeble Muse, deriues her life and light.
               
               
                  Eeke pardon (PEERES,) that heere my ruder verse,
                  Vnto your worthes, and greatnes dares aspire;
                  Or out of course, if I your rankes reherse:
