Christian reader, a second
and third blast of
retrait from plaies and
Theaters. The first blast in my compt
is The Schoole of abuse:
               Schoole of abuse. a title not
vnfitlie ascribed vnto plaies. For
what is there which is not abused
thereby? Our hartes with idle cogitations;
our eies with vaine aspects,
gestures, and toies; our eares with
filthie speach, vnhonest mirth, and rebaldrie;
our mouths with cursed speaking;
our heads with wicked imaginations;
our whole bodies to vncleanes;
our bodies and mindes to the
seruice of the Diuel; our holie daies
with prophanes; our time with idlenes;

al our blessings, health, wealth,
and prosperitie to the increase of Satans
kingdome, are there abused: that
not vnfitlie they are tearmed, as of
late The schoole of abuse, by one

though there were no moe blastes, or
dehortations frō them, or inuectiues
against them beside. For in al ages
the most excellent men for learning
haue condemned them by the force of
eloquence, and power of Gods worde
(as I am to proue vpon anie good
occasion offered). But so do I tear
                  ••
               
               
them in respect of the time present
wherein none, that I knowe, besides
these Autors haue written, though
manie, thanked be God, in the principal
places of this land haue,Author of ye second blast. and dailie,
yea and openlie do speake against
plaies and Theaters.
            The former of these two was written
in the Latine tong by that reuerend
man Saluianus
               Saluianus 
                     〈◊〉
                   Episcopus lib. 6. de gubernat. Dei. Bishop of
Massilia, who for his wonderful eloquence
and zeale is called, Magister
Episcoporum, The maister of Byshops,
by Gennadius
               Gennadius de illustribus viris.; and that
1100▪ yeeres sithence. VVherebie
thou maist gather, first, that it is a
most odious, & intolerable thing in
a Christian Common-weale, which
so learned a Byshop would stand to
confute; & secondlie, that to dehort
from plaies is no newe thing, being
condemned so long ago.
            The Lord of his infinite mercie

grant, that his blast maie do more
good with Englishmen, than it did
with the Romans, to which he sounded
the same. Otherwise I know right
wel, that must needs betide vs which
happened vnto them. For they contemned
his saiengs, and the warnings
of such like good men. Therfore
first came the foraine enimies, the
Gothes and Vandales who ouercame
them, and oppressed them with
most grieuous bondage; and afterward
they fel into the handes of Satan,
who caried them headlong into
al impuritie of life, & abomination,
vnder which curse of God they as yet
continue. So we, assuredlie, vnles
we listen vnto the dehortations of
these good men, and shun plaies, with
such like pompes of Satan, the which
once we, when it was, before God &
his congregation, renounced, shal fal
into some one intolerable plague of

God or other, into the handes if not
of foraine enimies, which I feare; yet
of our spiritual aduersarie, the Pope
or Diuel, which I am sure of.
            Touching the Autor of the latter
blast, thou maist coniecture who he
was, but I maie not name him at
this time for my promise sake: yet this
do I saie of him, that he hath bine, to
vse his verie wordes, A great affecter
of that vaine Art of plaie making,
&c. Yea, which I ad, as excellent
an Autor of those vanities, as
who was best. But the Lord of his
goodnes hath called him home; so
that he did not so much delight in
plaies in times past, but he doth as
much detest them now, and is hartilie
sorie that euer he was such an instrument
to set vice afloate: as more
at large in his discourse, thou maist
perceaue. VVhereby first, note with
me, the goodnes of our God toward

vs, who seeing that we wil not shun
plaies for anie dehortations of his
godlie Preachers, who daie by daie
in al places of greatest resort denounce
the vengeance of GOD to
them, be they hie or lowe, that fauor
plaies, Theaters, or plaiers, stirreth
vp the verie Autors themselues to
inueigh against them, that we maie
be ashamed any waie to allowe that,
which the verie Autors do vtterlie
condemne. Secondlie praise God, I
beseech you, for bringing this Autor,
and Maister Gosson, who made the
Schoole of abuse out of Babylon. And
thirdlie praie vnto him, that al

exercise, for lacke either of
Autors, or of auditors.
            Loth was the Autor, I must needs
confesse, to haue his worke published,
not because he would not haue plaies
openlie reproued, which from his hart
he wisheth were most straightlie forbidden,
but through a too too base
conceipt of his owne worke, thinking
that some grounded Diuine were
more fit to dehort from so prophane
an exercise, than he, whose profession
(if so I maie saie) is otherwise. But
hearing partlie by me, and partlie by
others, what a ioie to the children of
God, and griefe to the seruants of 
                  〈◊〉
               
would be to heare, that he, who

                  〈◊〉
                so famous an Autor, was now

                  〈◊〉
                a religious dehorter from

                  〈◊〉
               ; yea, thinking how the one
sort would with more Zeale auoide
them, & the other with more shame

appeare on stage, when they should
vnderstand that al the world knoweth
that their exercise is neither
warranted by Gods worde, nor liked
of Christians, but disalowed vtterly
by Scripture, by reason, by Doctors,
by Byshops, by their verie Autors
themselues, yea and by al other good
men, as the enimie to godlines, and
the corruption of the wel disposed,
and so consequentlie a special engine
both to subuert al Religion, and to
ouerthrowe the good state of that
Common-weale where it is maintained,
he altered his minde, and
gaue me his booke, wishing me to do
therewithal as I thought best for the
glorie of God, and thy commoditie.
            VVhich I haue now, together with
the inuectiue of that reuerend Bishop
Saluianus, published, that one
of them might showe the abomination
of Theaters in the time present,

and the other how odious they haue
seemed to the godlie in time past,
and both allure thee vtterlie to forbid
them, if thou be a Magistrate of
power, and to auoide them more
than anie pestilence, be thou
whosoeuer. VVhich
God grant.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            A Second blast of retrait
from plaies and Theaters,
sounded by that reuerend, godlie,
and learned Byshop Saluianus,
sometime Byshop of Massilia, in his
sixt booke De gubernatione
Dei.
            
            
               SVch thinges are
committed at plaies
and Theaters, as cannot
be thought vpon,
much lesse vttered without
sinne. For other vices chalenge
their seueral portions within vs,
as filthie cogitations the minde;
vnchaste aspects the eies; wicked
speech the eares: so that when one
of these doth offend, the rest may
be without fault. But at Theaters
none of these but sinneth, for both
the mind there with lust; and the

                  〈◊〉
                with showes; and the eares
with hearing be polluted: al which

                  〈◊〉
                so bad, that no man can wel

report or declare them with honestie.
            For who, without passing the
boundes of shamefastnes, can vtter
those imitations of vnhonest
things; that filthie speech; that
vile motion, the beastlie gestures,
vsed there? The vilenes whereof
may be gathered euen by the vnlawfulues
to name them. For som
sinnes, though most hainous, may
wel and honestlie both be named,
& blamed too, as murder, theft, adulterie,
sacriledge, and such like:
onlie the filthines of Theaters are
such as may not honestlie be no
not so much as blamed. Such new
matter ariseth against the reproouer
for finding falt with this most
horrible filthines; that albeit he be
a most perfect honest man that
would speake against it, yet can he
not so doe and keepe his honestie.
            
               
Againe, al other euils pollute the
doers onlie, not the beholders, or
the hearers. For a man may heare
a blasphemer, and not be partaker
of his sacriledge, inasmuch as in
minde he dissenteth. And if one
come while a roberie is a doing, he
is cleere, because he abhors the
fact. Onlie the filthines of plaies,
and spectacles is such, as maketh
both the actors & beholders giltie
alike. For while they saie nought,
but gladlie looke on, they al by
sight and assent be actors, that trulie
may be applied vnto them that
saieng of the apostle,Rom. 1, 31. 
               How that not
onlie they which commit such things
are worthie death, but also which fauor
them that do them.
            
            So that in that representation of
whoredome, al the people in mind
plaie the whores. And such as happilie
came chaste vnto showes, returne

adulterers from plaies. For
they plaie the harlots, not then
onlie when they go awaie, but also
when they come. For as soone
as one lusteth after a filthie thing,
whiles he hasteneth to that which
is vncleane, he becōmeth vncleane.
            Now this being so, behold I
praie you, what partes either al or
almost al Romans, doe plaie. And
yet, we doing thus, saie we are not
regarded of God; we saie GOD
hath forsaken vs, when in verie
deede we forsake God.
            For,God cannot fauor such as haunt plaies. suppose we, that our Lord
wil respect vs, not deseruing his
fauor? let vs see if he can. Lo, infinite
thousandes of Christians 
                  〈◊〉
               
dailie abide at the showes of 
                  〈…〉
               seemelie things. Can God the 
                  〈…〉
                such kinde of persons? 
                  〈◊〉
               
God cast his gratious counten
                  ••••
               
vpon such as rage in circles, 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
plaie the harlots in Theaters? Or
is this our meaning, and doe we
thinke it meete, that forsomuch as
God seeth vs in circles, and Theaters,
that what things we see, he beholdeth;
and what filthines we
looke on, he seeth it also for companie?
For one of these must
needes be: for if he vouchsafe to
looke vpon vs, it foloweth, that he
must beholde al those thinges,
where we are: or if, which is most
true, he turne awaie his eies from
those thinges, he must likewise
turne his countenance frō vs who
are there. And the case standing
thus, yet naie-theles we doe these
things which I haue said, and that
without cessing.
            Or thinke we that God hath his
Theaters, and circles, as had the
gods of the Gentils? For thus did
they in old time, because they

were persuaded their idols delighted
in them.The Diuel delighteth in plaies; God detesteth them. But how is it that we
doe so, who are certaine that our
God detesteth them? Or if wee
knowe that this abominatiō doth
please God, I wil not gaine-saie,
but wee maie frequent it daie by
daie. But if it be in our conscience,
that God abhorreth, that he detesteth,
that God is offended as the
Diuel is fed by Theaters; how saie
we that wee worship God in his
Church, which serue the Diuel alwaies
at plaies, and that wittinglie,
and willinglie? And what hope
shal we haue with God, who not
ignorantlie, or by chance wound
him, but after the example of
those gigants whome we reade, ful
madlie bent themselues against
God, and against the cloudes. So
we through the iniuries which al
the world ouer continualie we infer,

doe beate the heauens, as it
were, with a common consent.
            To Christ therfore, O monsterous
madnes! euen to Christ doe
we offer plaies and tomblers; yea
and that especialie then when we
receiue goodnes at his hands, whē
we enioie prosperitie through his
blessing, or God hath giuen vs victorie
ouer the enimies, whereby
what else do we show our selues,
but euen iniurious to him which
hath done vs good; to raile vpon
him, who blesseth vs; to strike
him ouer the face with a sworde,
who louinglie doth kisse vs.
            For I aske the mightie and rich
men of this world, of what offence
is that seruant guiltie, which wisheth
il to a good and gratious
maister; which raileth on him that
deserueth wel; and rendereth despiteful
wordes for benefits receiued?

without controuersie al men
wil iudge him a most hainous offender,
which for good rendreth il
to him, to whom indeed he might
not yeeld il for euil: euen thus do
we, which are called Christians;
we stir vp against vs a merciful
God by our vncleannes; we strike
a gratious God by our filthines;
we wound a louing God by our
wickednes.
            To Christ therefore, ô monsterous
madnes! euen to Christ doe
we offer plaiers and tomblers; to
Christ we do render for his benefites
the filthines of theaters; euen
to Christ do we sacrifice the oblations
of most beastlie sport. As
though our Sauior, who for vs became
man, taught vs to doe so, and
had preached the same either by
himselfe, or by his Apostles; as
though that to this end he tooke

vpon him the shame of mans natiuitie,
and the contumelious beginnings
of an earthlieLuk. 2, 12. 13. generation;
to that end he laie in a cratch,
at what time notwithstanding
the verie Angels ministred vnto
him; to that ende he would be
swadled with rags of cloth, who
gouerned the heauens in simple
cloth; to that end he hong on the
crosse, at whose hanging the verie
world was astonished.2. Cor. 8, 9. 
               VVho being
rich, saith the Apostle, for your sakes
became poore, that yee thorough his
pouertie might be made rich.
               Phil. 2, 6. 
               And
being in the forme of GOD, he humbled
himselfe vnto the death, euen
the death of the crosse: Euen this
did Christ teach vs when he suffered
these things for our sakes.
            
               Wel do we requite his passion,
who, receiuing through his death
redemption, leade a most filthie

life.
               Tit. 2, 11. For the grace of God that bringeth
saluation vnto al men hath appeared,12.
               saith blessed Paule, and
teacheth vs that wee should denie
vngodlines, and worldlie lustes, and
that wee should liue soberlie, and
righteouslie, and godlie in this present
world,13. looking for the blessed
hope, and appearing of the glorie of
the mightie God,14. and of our Sauior
Iesus Christ, who gaue himselfe for
vs, that he might redeeme vs from
al iniquitie, and purge vs a peculiar
people vnto himselfe, Zealous of good
workes.
            Where be they which doe these
things, for which the Apostle saith
Christ came? where be they which
flie thedesires of this world? where
be they which liue godlie & righteouslie,
that looke for the blessed
hope by wel doing, and leading a
pure life, show thereby that they

looke and long for the kingdome
of God; where be such?
            
               Our Lord Iesus Christ came,
               Tit. 2, 14. saith
he, that he might purge vs a peculiar
people vnto himselfe, zealous of good
workes. Where is that pure people?
that peculiar people; that good
people, that people of holines?
            
               Christ, saith the Scripture,1. Pet. 2, 21 
               suffered
for vs, leauing vs an ensample,
that we should folow his steps.
And we folow the steps of our Sauior
in circles, and in Theaters, we
folow the steps of our Sauior: as
though our Sauior left vs such an
ensample, whome wee read did
weepe, but that he laughed, we neuer
read. And both these for our
sakes, because weeping is a pricking
of the hart, laughter the corruption
of maners. Therefore said
he, VVoe to you that laugh,
               Luke. 6, 25. 
               for yee
shal waile and weepe: and,21▪
                
               Blessed

are ye that weepe now, for yee that laugh. But it is not enough for vs
to laugh and be merrie, vnles we
reioice with sin and madnes; vnles
our laughter be tempered with
filthines, & mixed with impietie.
            What error, I saie, is this, naie
what foolishnes? Can we not dailie
be merrie, and laugh, vnles we
make our laughter & mirth to be
wickednes? Or els thinke we simple
mirth to be nothing worth?
and can wee not laugh except wee
sinne? what a mischiefe is this, naie
what furie? Let vs laugh, I praie
you, yea vnmeasurablie; and let vs
be merrie, yea continualie, so we
sinne not. What foolishnes, naie
madnes is it, to thinke mirth and
ioie nothing worth, vnles God be
iniuried therebie? yea iniuried, &
that most hainouslie?
            For in showes there is a certaine

Apostasie from the faith;To see plaies a kind of Apostasie. and a
deadlie declining from our beliefe,
and the heauenlie sacraments. For
what is the first professiō of Christians
at their baptisme? They protest
they wil renounce the Diuel,
and al his workes, his pompes, and
vanities. Therefore by our owne
confession, showes & pompes are
the workes of the Diuel.
            How then, ô Christian, dost
thou haunt plaies and Theaters after
baptisme, which thy selfe confessest
are the works of the Diuel!
Once thou didst renounce the Diuel
and al his showes, wherebie it
foloweth, that whiles thou goest
witting and willinglie vnto common
spectacles, thou must thinke
thou returnest again vnto the Diuel.
For thou hast renoūced both,
and didst confesse one of them to
be both. So that returning vnto

one, thou wentest back vnto both.
For, thou saiest, I renounce the
Diuel, his pompes, showes, and
workes. And what afterward? I
beleeue, thou saiest, in God the
Father almightie, and in Iesus
Christ his sonne. Therefore before
we can beleeue in God, the Diuel
must be renounced. For he beleeueth
not in God, who renounceth
not the Diuel. So then he forsaketh
God, who returnes to the
Diuel. But the Diuel is in his
pompes & showes, then it foloweth
that by returning vnto his
pompes wee forsake the faith of
Christ. Then hereby al the mysteries
of the Beliefe are vnlosed; and
al which foloweth in the Creede,
is weakened, and tottereth. For
the building cannot stand, if the
principal be downe.
            Then tel me, ô Christian, how

canst thou think thy selfe to keepe
that which folowes in the Creed,
when thou hast lost the beginning
of the same? The members without
an head be nothing worth; &
to their beginning al things haue
respect; which once being decaied
euerie thing goes to wracke. For
the roote being gone, either nothing
remaines; or if there do, it
serues to smal profit, for without
an head nothing can stand.
            He therefore that thinkes it a
light offence to see plaies, let him
consider al what we haue said, and
he shal see that in plaies there is
destruction, and no pleasure. And
what els is it, but to fal into destruction,
to forgo the beginning
of life? For where the fundacion
of the Beliefe is ouerthrown, life it
selfe is destroied.
            Then againe we must needs returne

vnto that which we haue
often said: what such thing among
the barbarous? where be anie
stages among them, or Theaters?
where is the sinne of manie
sinnes, that is the destruction of
our hope,Pagans might better erect & frequent Theaters than Christians. and saluation? which
notwithstāding if they, being Pagans
did vse, they should erre with
lesse offence of God: because albe
such doing were a defiling of the
sight, yet were it not a breaking of
the sacrament.
            But now, what can we saie for
our selues? we hold the beleefe, &
we ouerthrowe the beleefe; wee
confesse the dutie of saluation, and
also denie the same. And therefore
where is our Christianitie? who,
as it seemeth, hereunto are baptized,
that afterward more hainously
we might offend? we prefer pastimes
before the Church; we despise

the Lordes table, and honor
Theaters; at a worde, we loue al
things, reuerence al things, God
alone seemeth vile to vs in comparison
of other things.
            Finalie among the rest which
proue the same, this which I now
saie, doth showe it to be true. For if
it fal out, as often it doth, that at
one & the same time an holie daie
be kept, and common plaies proclamed,
I demaund, whether do men
flock most, to the court of God, or
to the den of plaies; to the temple,
or to Theaters? And what do men
heare most willinglie, the saiengs
of the Euangelists, or the toies of
plaiers; the wordes of life, or the
wordes of death; the wordes of
Christ, or the words of a foole in a
plaie? doubtles we loue that best,
which we prefer. For if the Church
keepe anie feast on that daie when

deadlie pastime is showen, men,
such as say they are Christians, either
come not at al vnto Church;
or, if not thinking of plaies they
come and heare in the same plaies
to bee abroad, they leaue the
Church. The temple is despised, to
run vnto Theaters; the Church is
emptied, the yeard is filled; wee
leaue the sacrament, to feede our
adulterous eies with the impure, &
whorish sight of most filthie pastime.
But forsooth we, whom prosperitie
doth mar, must do something
in the beginning. And therfore
ful rightlie saith the Lord
God vnto vs; For your vncle annes,
are yee with destruction abolished.
And againe, The altars of this mirth
shalbe rooted out.
            
            But now it maie be answered,
that in al the townes of the Romans
plaies be not vsed. True it is,

and I ad moreouer, that neither be
Theaters where in times past they
were. For they are not vsed neither
at Magontia, norat Massilia,
because those townes be ouerthrowen,
and destroied; They are
not vsed at Agrippina, for the enimie
hath subdued the same; not
in Treuers that famous towne, because
being foure-times subdued,
it is now brought to ground; to
conclude they are not vsed in most
townes both of France, and Spaine;
and therefore wo to vs men, and to
our vncleannes; wo to vs, and to
our wickednes. What hope is there
for Christian people before God?
inasmuch as those euils haue neuer
ben in Roman cities, since they
came into the hands of Barbarians.
Wherby it appeareth that wickednes
and impuritie,Romans singular wicked. is proper & peculiar
vnto the Romans, and their

verie nature as it were.A goodlie praise of the Romans. For there
wickednes doth chieflie raigne,
where the Romans be.
            But haplie this maie seeme a
grieuous, and vniust complaint▪
grieuous indeede, if it be false. But
how, thou wilt saie, how can it be
otherwise, sithence what we haue
said, are done in a few cities of the
Romans? And most of them are
not polluted with this spot of filthines,
where although the place
and dwelling of ancient error do
abide, yet are not those things now
done which were in times passed.
            It wil be good therefore to consider
both these things, that is, both
why the places & houses of plaies
are yet vp; and yet no plaies vsed.
The places and houses of filthines
are therefore yet standing, because
in them all impure things were
wont to be showen: and now the

vaine pastime is not vsed, for that
the miserie of the time, and mens
pouertie will not permit. So that it
was of their impietie, why in time
past plaies were frequented, & necessitie
is the cause that they are
not now. For the miserable case of
the exchequer, & the emptines of
the Romane treasurie wil suffer no
monie to be wasted commonlie
vpō trifling things. And although
much is lost, and cast as it were vpon
the dunghil: yet nothing so
much can be consumed, because
they haue not wherewithal to do
so. For such is our insatiable desire
of filthie plesure, that we could
wish to haue more, onlie to laie it
vpon this dirte of abhomination.
And the thing showes what we
would prodigalie consume, if we
were rich, when we wast so much
being in so poore a state. For this

is the spot, and miserie of the present
time, that although through
pouertie we cannot, yet through
our impietie we would consume
much.
            There is no cause then why we
should deceaue our selues, in saieng
that in al cities those things
are not, which were before done.
For therefore they are not in this
time vsed, because the townes
where they were vsed, are not to
be seene: and where they haue a
long time bene vsed, there is not
to bring it to passe: as God himselfe
speaketh vnto sinners by the
prophet, And it ascended vpon his
harte, and the Lord could beare it
no longer: for the wickednes of
your studies, and for the abhominations
which you haue committed,
and your land is brought into desolation,
into barrennes, and accursed.
               
This is the cause then whie
the maior part of the Romane empire
is brought into desolation, into
barrennes, and accursed.
            And would to God they were
onlie done in times past, and not
now in these daies, happelie then,
as it is written, God would be merciful
to our sinnes. But we take
not the waie to haue Gods fauor.
For vncessantlie we ad sinne to sin,
& heape wickednes vpon wickednes,
that as the better part of vs are
destroied, so we maie al come to
nought.
            For, I demand, who seeth another
slaine before his face, and is
not afraide? who beholdeth his
neighbors house on fire, and wil
not by al meanes prouide for the
salfetie of his owne? wee do not
onlie see our neighbors to burne,
but also are set on fire our selues

from the chiefest part of our bodies.
And, ô abomination! what a
mischiefe is this? we burne, we
burne, yet dread we not the fire
wherwith we burne. For, as I said,
the cause why those things which
before time were vsed, are not
now done, is to be ascribed to the
miserie we are in, not to anie discipline
or good order which we
haue.
            Finalie, I doe easilie prooue the
same. For make the time as it was,
and forthwith al things shalbe as
they were in those daies. Yea
moreouer, as touching the desire
of men, though those things are
not euerie where, yet in respect of
their minds euerie where they be.
For the Romans would haue them
vsed euerie where. For when necessitie
onlie makes an euil thing
to be left vndone, the verie desire

of a filthie thing is condemned in
such sort as if it were done. For, as
I saie, according to the wordes of
our Sauior,Matt. 5, 28. 
               VVhosoeuer looketh on
a woman to lust after her, hath committed
adulterie with her alreadie
in his harte: whereby we maie gather,
that albe we leaue things filthie
& damnable vndone, and that
onelie through necessitie; yet because
our wil is good to haue
them, wee are guiltie of condemnation.
            And what speake I of wil?
when almost euerie where those
things are committed. For what
stranger soeuer commeth either to
Rauenna, or to Rome, shal finde a
part of the Romans at showes; and
a part of the Rauenians at Theaters.
And although anie be either
absent, or distant by place, yet is he
not excused thereby. For as manie

as are ioined togither in likenes of
affection, are guiltie alike of the
same wickednes which either do
commit.
            Yet for al this wee flatter our
selues of our good behauior; wee
flatter our selues of the rarenes of
impuritie. But I say yet more, that
not onelie those foule spots of infamous
plaies are yet to be seene
as afore time; but also be more abominablie
set forth, than euer
they were. For in those daies euerie
part of the Romane empire was
in health and sound; the riches of
other townes made the common
barnes to be large & big; citizens
did abound in wealth and pleasure,
so that it was verie hard in
such aboundance of al things, for
religion to continue pure, and
manners vncorrupt. Then euerie
where Autors of filthie pleasure

were cherished; for in al places
men were fat. No man waide the
charge of the Common-weale, no
man feared to come behind hand;
for expenses was not perceaued.
The Common-weale after a sort
did seeke where, and how to wast
wealth, hauing almost no place to
keepe it. And therefore heapes of
wealth, euen wel nigh aboue measure,
were consumed vpon vaine
things.
            But now what maie be said? old
aboundance is gone, gone is the
wealth which once we had. Poore
wee are, yet cease wee not to be
vaine. And whereas pouertie doth
reclaime prodigal and prodigious
pupils, so that when their wealth
is gone, they leaue wickednes: we
showe our selues a newe kind of
pupils and vnthriftes, who lacking
wealth wil not leaue wickednes.

Whereby it appeareth, that the
cause of our wickednes, is not in
the inticements, as of other men,
but in our hartes: and that our
mindes, is our wickednes; that in
deede not by the taking awaie of
riches, but through the desire of euil
things we sinne.
            And although we haue hitherto
recited manie vices of the Romans,
which the barbarous people
are not polluted withal: yet are
there manie mo, which I will now
ad. But first this I warne you by
the waie, that you account no kind
of sinne light, which tendeth vnto
the dishonor of God. For if no
man maie dishonor him that is
noble and mightie; but if he do so
he is made to answere it where he
would not, and condemned by
lawe: how much more hainous
is that offence, whereby the glorie

of God is defaced? For alwaies the
fault doth increase, according to
the worthines of him that is iniuried.
Because by how much the
person is greater that suffereth reproch,
by so much is he faultie
that doth the same.Exod. 31, verse. 13. 14. Whereof it is
which wee read in the lawe, that
they which to mans thinking did
but lightlie offend,Nomb. 20, verse. 25. 26, &c. were most seuerelie
for al that punished: which
was to giue vs to vnderstand that
nothing,Nomb. 25, verse. 4. 9. which concerneth God,
should be lightlie accounted of:
& that that which man esteemed
a smal offence, because it was committed
against the glorie of God,1. Chr. 13, verse. 9. 10.
was a most grieuous crime.
            To be short, Vzza
               Vzza. that Leuite
of the Lord, what did he contrarie
vnto the commandement of God,
when he assaied to keepe vp the
Arke of God from falling? no precept

was there by lawe to forbid
him; yet while he held vp the
same, presently through the wrath
of God he died: not because he
had done anie thing rebelliouslie,
or at leastwise not dutifullie, but
by showing dutie he prooued vndutiful,
for taking more vpon him
than he was commanded.
            That man among the people of
Israel,
                  Gathering of stickes. Nomb. 15, verse. 32. 35. 36. that had gathered stickes
vpon the Sabboth daie, died the
death, and that by the iudgement,
and commandement of God, euen
the most gratious and mercifull
iudge, who out of doubt had rather
pardon than kil, had not the
consideration of seueritie preuailed
ouer his mercie. For one rash
felowe perished, that manie afterward
through rashnes might not
perish.
            And what should I speake of

each particular man?Nomb. 11, verse. 4. 31. 32. 33. The whole
nation of the Iewes traueling thorough
the wildernes, because they
lusted after their wonted meate,
lost a part of their people.Psa. 78, 30. 31. Yet was
there no cōmandement that they
should not lust, but God, as I suppose,
would prouide afore hand
for the due obseruation of the
moral law, by restraining their rebellious
concupiscence: euen that
al the people might the more easilie
confesse, how earnestlie they
should auoid those things, which
God in his holie Scripture should
forbid, when they were punished
for that, which as yet they were
not forbidden.
            The same people also complained
that they tooke such paines,
for which cause the Lord plagued
them from heauen: not because a
man oppressed with labor might

not complaine; but for that therebie
they showed themselues vnthankful
towards GOD, making
God, as it were, the Autor of their
immoderate busines. Wherby we
maie gather, how zelouslie hee
ought to serue God, which enioieth
prosperitie, when as he maie
not complaine being in aduersitie.
            But perchance, some wil saie,
whereto serues al this? whether
to? doubtles, that we should count
nothing a smal thing, which hurteth
the glorie of God.Plaies the mockerie of religion. We speake
of common plaies, the verie mockerie
of religion, and the toies of
our life. For while wee plaie at
Theaters and stages, we are rauished
with the loue therof, according
to that in the holie Scripture,Prou. 10, verse. 23. 
               It is
a pastime for a foole to do wickedlie.
And so, in laughing at filthie and
abhominable thinges, we commit

wickednes: & those no smal sins,
but therefore the more damnable:
because though they seeme smal
at the first sight, yet are they most
pestilent in the end. For inasmuch
as there be two most notorious euils,Two most notorious offences cō
                  mitted by frequenting plaies.
as when a man either slaieth
himselfe, or defaceth the glorie of
God, both they are done in common
plaies. For at plaies both the
euerlasting saluation of Christian
people is quite extinguished thorough
wicked filthines, & the maiestie
of God violated, through sacrilegious
superstition. For it is
certaine that it offendeth God, being
consecrated to idols.
            For Minerua in schooles of exercise, Venus at Theaters, Neptune
at circles, in the field Mars, Mercurie
at wrestling places is adored, &
had in honor: and so, according to
the qualitie of the Autors, superstition

doth encrease.
            Al vncleanes is showed at plaieng;
al luxuriousnes at wrestling;
at tumbling al vnshamefastnes;
al madnes in caues. Vncleannes is
one where; wantonnes anotherwhere;
anotherwhere intemperancie;
and madnes anotherwhere: but
the Diuel is eueriewhere; yea in euerie
particular place where plaies
be, are al the sortes of Diuels. For
they gouerne those places which
are dedicated vnto them. And
therefore the onelie inticement is
not there, nor wickednes onelie in
such spectacles, or showes. For it
is a kind of sacriledge beside for a
Christian to be at such superstition;
because he taketh part with
their idolatrie, whose feasts he is
delighted withal.
            The which albeit alwaies it hath
bene a lamentable thing: yet then

is it most intollerable, when as besides
the customable vse of life, either
our aduersitie, or prosperitie
doth make it the more hainous.
And that because God in aduersitie
should be the more pacified, &
lesse offended in prosperitie. For
Gods fauor should be sought for
when he is angrie; and when he is
merciful, he should not be dishonored.
For we fall into aduersitie
through the displeasure of God;
and by his fauor, we enioie prosperitie.
            But we doe al things cleane otherwise.Prosperitie abused. How so? doe you aske?
marke what I saie. And first when
God being intreated of his owne
mercie (for wee do neuer so liue,
that we can deserue to haue him
entreated) but, as I saie, when God
hath entreated himselfe, and giuen
vs a peaceable time, great encrease,

a rich tranquillitie, and store of al
thinges more than we can desire;
then we so corrupt our selues with
such prosperitie, and so defile our
liues with wickednes, that we vtterlie
forget both GOD and our
selues. And whereas the Apostle
saith,1. Tim. 2, verse. 2. that The frute of peace which
God doth send, consisteth in this, that
we should lead a peaceable and quiet
life in al godlines, and honestie: we
vse the same as though God gaue
it to the end, that we should liue
in al drōkennes, in al riotousnes, in
naughtines, in theft, and in al wickednes
and dishonestie: as though
the benefite of peace giuen, were
leasure to do wickedlie; and wee
should take the truce of tranquillitie
at Gods hand the more licentiouslie,
and securelie to sinne.
            Therefore wee are vnworthie
Gods gifts, which vse the benefits

of God so wickedly. We make the
occasion of good workes, to be
onlie the matter of wickednes.
Wherebie commeth to passe, that
peace it selfe is against vs. For so
we deale, that better it were for vs
to be without that thing whereby
we proue the worse.
            Who would thinke it? we change
the course of things by our wickednes; and what God of his mercie
made good, we make the same
il for vs, through our vile behauior, &c.
            It remaineth that we now proue
that neither the giftes nor alluremēts
of God do better vs one iote.
And what are they? what, but euen
our peace, quietnes, & tranquillitie
which we enioie according to our
wish and desire. Wherfore because
the matter doth so require, let vs
vtter some special thing.
            
               
Then, as often as we are in feare,
in affliction, in perils; when either
citties with enimies are besieged,
or countries by inuasion or anie
other aduersitie are wasted: then
we beate the members of a Common-weale,
and by praier cal for
the assistance of God: If by the
aide of God either townes by saued,
or spoile and pilling hath an
end; or the host of enimies foiled;
& al feare through the blessing of
God is taken awaie, what do wee
straight after al these ehings? I beleeue
we endeuor to requite the
benefits that we haue receiued frō
our Lord God with seruing, honoring,
and reuerencing his holie
Name. (For this followeth, & experience
doth prooue, that they
who are thankefull get moe benefits,
and they are blessed with most
ample and fresh rewardes that requite

good turnes.
            So happelie we do, & requiting
our GOD at leastwise after the
māner of men, we render good for
his benefites, that is, we forthwith
make recourse vnto the house of
the Lord, throwe our selues vpon
the ground, praie vnto him with
ioie and teares together, set forth
the temple with our gifts, and bestow
rewards. And because thorough
his gift we are made merrie,
we showe the signes of our ioie in
his temples, or least wise, which he
likes as wel, we renounce the former
wickednes of our life, slaie the
sacrifices of good workes, and for
newe consolations we offer the sacrifice
of a new conuersation, finalie
we proclaime an holie warre against
al vncleannes, shun the
madnes of stages, abhor the filthines
of plaies, promise a new life to

the Lord, and finalie for the attainement
of his perpetual protection
we offer vp our selues wholie
vnto God.
            Now, forasmuch as these things
which we haue mētioned, should
be done for Gods benefites newlie
extended vpon vs, let vs consider
what is done. Wee run forthwith
vnto plaies, we flie vnto madnes,
the people disperse themselues in
Theaters, the whole multitude reuel
it out at stages. He bestoweth
good thinges vpon vs, that wee
should be good; we contrariewise
when we haue receaued good, encrease
our wickednes; He by his
benefites calleth vs vnto godlines,
we therby fal to sin; He by his gifts
allureth to repentāce, we rush vnto
vncleannes; He calleth vnto puritie
of life, we folowe filthines.
            Thus we wel requite him for his

liberalitie, we do wel either acknowledge,
or honor him for his
giftes, who as greatlie do recompense
him with iniuries, as he
hath mercifullie blest vs
with benefits.
            FINIS.
         
         
            A third blast of retrait
from plaies and Theaters,
showing the abhomination
of them in the time present.
            
               KNowledge makes
her seate & abode in
the mindes of those
men, who are neither
addicted to their owne opinion;

nor yet carried awaie with euerie
likelihood of troth. For as he that
is vnwilling to heare, is farthest
from knowledge: so he that is carried
awaie with euerie likelihood,
before he haue waded far & deeplie
in the cause, shal prooue but
slender of iudgement. But he who
wil neuer be satisfied with reason
maie rightlie be counted obstinate
and peruerse; and without reason
to be persuaded commeth either
of simplicitie, or compulsion.
            I write this to none other end
but to showe, that as I ought not,
being wedded too much to mine
owne opinion, to be caried to the
defence of a wrong cause: so it beseemeth
me not to be ouerlightlie
misled vnto error through the censure
of those, whose bare affirming
or denial serue onelie to
maintaine, but not to prooue; for

that men are not to be satisfied
with wordes, but with reason.
Which if I maie be, I wil not be
counted a peruerse wrangler, but
francklie wil condescend into the
opinion of the wise: otherwise am
to be pardoned though I stand ernest
and stiffe against that which
is contrarie to virtue; disagreing
from good religion; furthest from
ciuilitie, and maie neither by argument
of reason, nor power of
learning be defended.
            Such doubtles is mine opinion
of common plaies, vsual iesting,
and riming extempore, that in a
Christian-weale they are not sufferable.
My reason is, because
they are publike enimies to virtue
& religion; allurements vnto
sinne; corrupters of good manners;
the cause of securitie and carelesnes;
meere brothel houses of Bauderie;

and bring both the Gospel
into slander; the Sabboth into contempt;
mens soules into danger;
and finalie the whole Commonweale
into disorder.
            Great and hainous speeches, no
doubt: yet not so hainous, as the
exercise of them is odious; biting
wordes, yet not so bitter as the
cause requireth.
            It were il painting the Diuel
like an Angel, he must be portraied
forth as he is, that he maie the better
be knowen. Sinne hath alwaies
a faire cloake to couer his filthie
bodie. And therefore he is to be
turned out of his case into his naked
skin, that his nastie filthie bodie,
and stinking corruption being
perceaued, he might come into the
hatred and horror of men. For as
we are naturalie of our selues euil
and corrupt: so are we naturalie

giuen to loue our selues, and to be
blinded with our owne affections,
insomuch that, what we knowe
to be euil, we are not ashamed either
openlie to defend, or slilie to
cloake.
            The excuse of wickednes is but
the increase of punishment; & an
il cause defended by auctoritie, &
maintained by learning, bringes
Magistrates into slander, and learning
into contempt.
            This I speake, for that I knowe
those afore-said do want neither
countenance to vphold, nor yet
skil to defend them. But yet, vnder
correction, an euil cause maintained
is nearetheles euil; &, as pitch
defiles the toucher thereof, be he
neuer so cleane: so the virtuous
bring their life into question either
by sufferāce, or maintenance
of euil. For who wil not iudge but

what a mans allowes in another,
he commendes in himselfe?
            I therefore with reuerence not
as a teacher, but as a wel-willer
both to the noble and learned,
would wishe them with Adrian
the Emperor to suffer no pastime,
that maie bring them to vanitie;
nor to frequent that recreation▪
which tendes either to the hurt of
a Common-weale, or to the ouerthrowe
of religion.
            It is true that one opinion maie
be contrarie to another; and that
for the disliking of one, or two the
qualitie of plaieng were not to be
laide of, being so highlie esteemed
of al sortes of men, for that euerie
man conceaueth of the goodnes
or badnes of a thing according as it
seemeth in his owne opiniō. And
therefore the thing which they
discommend, maie be both liked,

and allowed.
            I confesse the iudgement of one
or two is not to be allowed in such
cases: neuertheles the opinions of
the rude multitude are not alwais
the soundest, which are mooued
with vnconstant motions, whereby
manietimes they like of that
which is most hurtful; and dislike
that which is most profitable: because
the one pleaseth their humors
and the other restraineth
their affections. The censure therfore
of them who carie best groūd
from Gods worde; and is most agreeable
to reason, most profitable
for the Cōmon-weale; least hurtful
to our brethren; and tending
alwaie to the reformation of abuse,
is soonest to be allowed, and
followed.
            Then whether this my iudgement
to be admitted or no, as being

the soundest, & respecting the
benefit of this our countrie, I leaue
it to the iudgement of the godlie
wise, and learned. And that I maie
seeme to write nothing without
ground, or to finde fault without
cause, I wil, GOD to freend, set
downe nothing to prooue mine
assertion good, but what Scripture
shal warrant, examples confirme,
reason allowe, and present experience
ratifie.
            Which mine arguments, if anie
by more colour of truth can ouerthrowe,
I am readie to recant, and
to allowe that for good, which I
can yet but condemne as wicked,
and thinke of al other to be the
most intolerable abuse in our Cō
               mon-weale.
For otherwise I cannot
thinke, vnles I be constrained,
as Petrarch saith, to iudge by other
mens iudgements; which who so

doth, iudgeth not of himselfe, but
reporters the opinion of others.
            Manie run on their courses verie
vainelie til it please God to cal
them home by the Spirit of his
grace vnto amendment of life. For
when it shal please him to touch
the conscience of the wicked with
repentance, the whole state of their
life doth alter from that it was before
as maie appeare in S. Paule
at his conuersion. And assuredlie
the Lord doth suffer vs manietimes
to run past our selues, that
when he hath called vs home, we
maie become examples of virtue
and godlines vnto others.
            I confesse that ere this I haue
bene a great affecter of that vaine
art of Plaie-making,The Autors former studie; and life. insomuch
that I haue thought no time so
wel bestowed, as when my wits
were exercised in the inuention of

those follies; I might scarselie with
patience heare anie man speake,
weare he neuer so learned & godlie,
that thought to persuade me
from them. So far was I from receiuing
of their good and godlie
admonitions, that I stopped mine
eares, and hardened mine harte against
their counsaile. Such is our
peeuish nature; we can like of nothing
which doth dislike vs, or seemeth
contrarie to our vaine opinions.
And therefore it is God onlie,
that must turne our mindes, otherwise
wee shal neuer discerne
profitable from hurtful things. For
able we have some about vs who
counsaile vs the best,& seeke our
profit: yet for al that our nature is
so peruerse & froward, that what
is wel said wil take no place. This
found I by my selfe, & this I now
perceaue to be in others: but the

Lordes purpose is good in al his
dealings.
            It might haue bene said
of me then,Hereby learne thou, good Reader, how to shun not onelie the vanitie of plaies, but al other vanities, after the example of the Author, who by diligent reading the holie Scriptures, and repentance fel into an vtter detestation of plaies. as it was written
of the wicked, that they considered
not the waies of the
Lord, but after when it pleased
God of his mercie to cal
mee to the reading of his
worde, and diligent studie of
the Scriptures, I began to
loath my former life, and to mislike
my owne doings; and I was
no sooner drawen with an hartie
desire to returne vnto the Lorde,
but I found my selfe strengthened
with his grace vnto good desires.
For the Lord neuer faileth them
that seeke him. Assuredlie his promise
can neuer deceaue men,Luke. 11, 9. but
when they knock, the gate shalbe
opened vnto them; and when thy
seeke, they shal find. There is nothing

more required in vs,What God requireth at our hands. than a
readie desire of wel doing, who no
doubt, being trulie ingraffed in our
minds, shalbe so watered with the
dewe of Gods holie spirit, that it
wil increase and growe vp in vs to
a more ful grouth and perfection.
            When I came to a streit examination
of my life, which I had
vainelie consumed in those exercises;Plaies cannot abide the truth of Gods word; and that I began to cal mine
old doings into question, and to
trie them by the true tuch of Gods
word, I found what I counted for
gold to be but drosse, vile, and of
none account,Vaine plaies make vaine folkes. hauing the propertie
to make their fauorers of their
owne nature.
            Then to the end that others
should not be deceaued with that
wherewith my selfe was ouertaken,The ende why this booke was made. I thought it my part to laie
open to al mens eies the horrible

abuse aswel of plaies as of the Inactors,
& the disorder of their Auditorie;
that the abuse being perceaued,
euerie man might reforme
himselfe, & be weaned from their
wickednes; or otherwise, that the
Magistrats being informed might
take such good waies, that the intolerable
exercise of plaies might
be vtterlie put downe. For I am
verilie persuaded, that if they may
be permitted stil to make sale of
sinne, we shal pul on our heads
Gods vengeance, & to our realme
bring an vtter confusion.
            What I shal speake of the abuse
by plaies of my owne knowledge,
I know maie be affirmed by hundreds,
to whome those matters are
as wel knowen as to my selfe.
Some citizens wiues,Frutes of plaies for the Diuels owne mouth vpon whom
the Lord for ensample to others
hath laide his hands, haue euen on

their death beds with teares confessed,
that they haue receiued at
those spectacles such filthie infections,
as haue turned their minds
from chast cogitations,1. Cor. 6, verse. 19. 20. and made
them of honest women light huswiues;
by them they haue dishonored
the vessels of holines; and
brought their husbandes into contempt,
their children into questiō,
their bodies into sicknes, and their
soules to the state of euerlasting
damnation.
            Such is the nature and inclinationHe that toucheth pitch wilbe defiled. that we run whether
affection leades vs, and are withdrawen
by companie. And therefore,2. Sam. 22, verse. 26. 27.
as Dauid saith, VVith the godlie
thou wilt showe thy selfe godlie;
with the vpright man thou wilt
showe thy selfe vpright.
               Psa. 18, 25. 26. 
               VVith the
pure thou wilt shewe thy selfe pure,
and with the froward, thou wilt

showe thy selfe froward.
            
            The repaire of them that are honest
to those places of euil resort,Auoid suspected places. makes their owne good life to be
doubted of; for that the place
breedes suspicion aswel of good, as
of bad. For who can see man or
woman resort to an house which
is notoriouslie wicked, but wil
iudge them to be of the crewe of
the wicked and vngodlie?
            The most honest wife,The best soonest tempted. is the
soonest assalted, and hath such
snares laid to entrap her, as, if God
assist her not, she must needes be
taken.
            When I gaue my selfe first to
note the abuse of common plaies,
I found mine harte sore smitten
with sorowe (sinne did there so abound
& was so openlie committed,Horrible sinnes openlie committed at Theaters. that I looked when God in
iustice would haue presentlie in

his wrath haue cōfounded the beholders.)
The Theatre I found to
be an appointed place of Bauderie;Marke this, ô yee fauorers, frequēters, & vpholders of plaies.
mine owne eares haue heard honest
women allured with abhominable
speeches. Sometime I haue
seene two knaues at once importunate
vpon one light huswife,
whereby much quarel hath growen
to the disquieting of manie.
There seruants, as it is manifestlie
to be prooued, haue consented to
rob their maisters, to supplie the
want of their harlots; there is the
practising with married wiues to
traine them from their husbands,
and places appointed for meeting
and conference.
            When I had taken a note of al
these abuses,Who can fauor plaies when the Autors thē
                  selues abhor them. & sawe that the Theater
was become a consultorie
house of Satan, I concluded with
my selfe, neuer to imploie my pen

to so vile a purpose, nor to be an
instrument of gathering the wicked
togither.
            It maie seeme I am ouer lauish
of speech; and that which I haue
publiqulie expressed ofothers by
mine owne knowledge might haue
bene dissembled. But I haue learned
that he who dissembles the euil
which he knowes in other
men, is as giltie before God ofthe
offence as the offenders the selues.
And the Lord hath expreslie commanded
in Exodus,
               Exod. 23, verse. 2. 
               that we should
not folowe a multitude to do evil,
neither agree in a controuersie to
decline after many, and overthrowe
the truth. I cannot therefore but
resist such wickedness, least I might
seeme to maintaine them, For he
that dissembles vngodlines is a
traitor to God.
            Since therefore that the cause is

Gods, I dare presse forth my selfe
to be an Advocate against Satan
unto the rooting out of sinne. For
I am fully resolued in Gods truth,
to build so strong and fure a fundation
against these sellers, & setters
forth of sinne, as neither they,
nor their adherents shal euer be
able to ouerthrowe. And my trust
is that the godile wil ionie with
me to the suppressing of those
which fight against his worde, waging
their battel on the Sabboth
daie the more conuenientile to destroie
the soules of the children of
God.
            The cause is generalie to be defended,
for that the contention of
the Aduersaries is about religion,
and therefore none can be discharged
for bare saieng they consent
not to the wicked. For it is the
part of euerie true soldier of lesus

Christ with al power to withstand,
& resist such as offer wrong
to the maiestie of GOD, by hindering
the service which we owe
unto him. We are to be enimies
unto the death against those uphiolders
of wickedness; and neuer to
giue ouer the battel in so holie, &
iust a quarel.
            We see the wicked are alwaies
readie to maintaine euil causes, &
in these daies the worst men shal
find bearers, and bolsterers, and be
supported by those, who by iustice
are to supress them, or at least to
reforme their abuses, which are intolerable.
If the wicked lurke together
to vphold their lewdenes,
how much more ought the faithful
to ioine themselues together
to plucke downe vanitie!
            I knowe my selfe a worme of
al other the weakest to medle in

these cases: yet such is my desire
to ouerthrowe their wickednes,
that I dare, inflamed with the holie
zeale of Dauid in the quarel of
God, unprouided both of armor
and weapon, with one poore sling
resist the strength of their hugest
Champion, and endure the brunt
of his fierce assalts; doubting not
but to finde some that wil stande
with me to ouerthrowe the enimies
of GOD, and to pul downe
those flags of defiāce, which Satan
hath set vp against the preaching
of the Gospel to the decaie of the
Church.
            Let vs delaie no time, deere brethren,
their doings are abhominable
in the sight and eares of God,
and condemned of the righteous:
if therefore sentence against their
euil workes be not executed speedelie,
The hartes of the children of

men, as Ecclesiastes saith, wilbe fullie
set in them to do euil.
               Eccl. 8, 11.
            
            If there were nothing to moue
you,Plaies do not onelie hinder the Gospel, but hurte the Common-weale. it were great cause to
stir vp your godlie furie, and zeale
to discommend plaies vtterlie: but
their abuses stretching further into
the Common-wealth, are by
sufferance growen so huge, that it
is hard dealing with them as against
foes; for they are become
priuate freends.Waies how to suppresse plaies. They are therfore
to be delt withal by degrees. For
it is verie hard to roote out that
frō our hartes, be it neuer so great
an abuse, wherof we haue conceaued
a good opinion.
            Let therefore the Magistrate but
repel them from the libertie of
plaieng on the Sabboth daie.The Magistrates dutie in suppressing plaies. For
that is abuse which is generalie
found fault withal, & allowed

of none but those who are altogether
destitute of the feare of God,
and without conscience. To plaie
on the Sabboth is but a priuiledge
of sufferance, and might with ease
be repelled, were it throughlie folowed.
The warrant which Magistrates
haue to forbid plaies is great,
and passed vnto them by such a
Prince, whose auctoritie is aboue
al auctories of earthlie gouernors.
            God hath giuen vs an expresse
commandement that wee should
not violate the Sabboth daie;Exo. 20, 8. 9. 10. 11. and
prescribed an order how it should
be sanctified, namelie in holines,
by calling into minde the spiritual
rest;Workes which God requireth on the Sabboth. hearing the worde of GOD;
and cessing from worldlie busines.
Wherevpon Isaiah the Prophet
showing how the sabboth should
be obserued,Esaie. 58, verse. 13. saith, If thou turne away
thy foote from the Sabboth, from

doing thy wil on mine holie daie, &
cal the Sabboth a delite, to consecrate
it, as glorious to the Lord, and shalt
honor him, not doing thine owne
waies, nor seeking thine owne wil,
nor speaking a vaine worde,
               Esa. 58, 14. 
               then
shalt thou delite in the Lord, and I
wil cause thee to mount vpon the hie
places of the earth, and feede thee
with the heritage of Iaakob thy father:
for the mouth of the Lord hath
spoken it.
            
            Here we see how the Lord requireth
that this daie should be
obserued;How the Sabboth daie is consumed. and what rest he looketh
for at our hands. But, alas, how do
we followe the order which the
Lord hath set downe! Is not the
Sabboth of al other daies the most
abused? which of vs on that daie
is not carried whether his affection
leades him vnto al dissolutenes
of life? How often do wee vse on

that daie vnreuerend speeches!
which of vs hath his hart occupied
in the feare of God? who is not
led awaie to the beholding of
those spectacles, the sight whereof
can bring but confusion both to
our bodies and soules?
            Are not our eies (thereAt plaies.) carried
awaie with the pride of vanitie?Euerie mē
                  ber of man defiled at plaies.
our eares abused with amorous,
that is lecherous, filthie, and abhominable
speech? Is not our tong,
which was giuen vs onelie to glorifie
God withal, is not our tong
there imploied to the blaspheming
of Gods holie Name, or the
commendation of that is wicked?
Are not our hartes through the
pleasure of the flesh; the delight of
the eie; and the fond motions of
the mind, withdrawn from the
seruice of the Lord, & meditation
of his goodnes?
            
               
So that albe it is a shame to saie
it, yet doubtles whosoeuer wil
mark with what multitudes those
idle places are replenished, & how
emptie the Lordes sanctuarie is of
his people, may wel perceaue what
deuotion we haue. We maie wel
saie, wee are the seruants of the
Lord: but the slender seruice wee
do him, and the smal regard we
haue of his commandements, declares
our want of loue towardes
him. For, If yee loue me,
               Iohn. 14, verse. 15. saith
Christ, keepe my commandements.
We maie wel be hirelings, but we
are none of his houshold.
            Wherfore abuse not so the Sabboth
daie, my brethren, leaue not
the temple of the Lord; sit not stil
in the quagmire of your owne
lustes: but put to your strength
to helpe your selues, before your
owne waight sinke you downe to

hel.Eph. 5, 16. 
               Redeeme the time, for the daies
are euil.
            
            Alas, what folie is in you, to
purchase with a penic damnation
to your selues? why seeke yee after
sinne,None delight in cō
                  mon spectacles, but such as would be spectacles. as after a banket? None
delight in those spectacles, but
such as would be made spectacles.
Account not of their drosse; their
tresures are too base to be laied vp
in the rich coafers of your minde.
Repentance is furthest from you,
when you are nearest such maiegames.
Al of you, for the most
part, do leese the time, or rather
wilfulie cast the same awaie; contemning
that as nothing, which
is so pretious as your liues cannot
redeeme.
            I would to God you would bestowe
the time you consume in
those vanities in seeking after virtue,Time would not be lost.
& glorie. For to speake trulie,

whatsoeuer is not conuerted to
the vse wherefore it was ordained,
maie be said to be lost. For to this
end was man borne,End of mās creation. and had the
benefit of time giuen him, that he
might honor, serue, and loue his
Creator, & thinke vpon his goodnes.
For whatsoeuer is done without
this is, doubtles cast awaie.
            Oh, how can yee then excuse
your selues for the losse of time!
do ye imagine that your carelesse
life shal neuer bee brought into
question. Thinke yee the wordes
of S. Paule the Apostle are spoken
in vaine, when he saith,2. Cor. 5, verse. 10. 
               VVe must
al appeare before the iudgment seate
of Christ, that euerie man maie receiue
the things which are done in
his bodie, according to that he hath
done, whether it be good or euil.
When that account shalbe taken, I
feare me your reckoning wilbe to

seeke.
            But you saie, tush al is wel, can
the Lord see this? wel, folowe the
thoughtes of your owne harts, &
see what shal come vpon you? yee
shal find al your imaginations to
be wicked; and though you flatter
your selues in your sinnes, tempt
the Lord in his mercie, and pricke
forward his slownes of wrath by
your presumption: yet he will
strike in the end to your vtter cō
               fusion.
Be thou not wicked ouermuch,
               Eccl. 7, 19.
               neither be thou foolish; wherefore
shouldest thou perish not in thy
time, saith Ecclesiastes godlie. And
Salomon,Prou. 30, verse. 32. 
               If thou hast bene foolish
in lifting vp thy selfe, and if thou hast
thought wickedlie, laie thine hande
vpon thy mouth.
               Cesse from il doing. Againe,Prou. 28, verse. 14. 
               Blessed
is the man that feareth alwaie, but
he that hardeneth his harte shal fal
into euil.
            
            
               
What shal I saie? None but the
wicked fauor iniquitie. The despisers
of GOD, looke where they
take anie pleasure, and find sweetnes,
there they hold them-selues,
and feede their greedie humors; &
it falleth out, as Salomon saith,
that he who is throughlie an hungred,
thinkes the meate which he
eateth to be sweete, although it be
as bitter as wormewood.
            Those vnsauerie morsels of vnseemelie
sentences passing out of
the mouth of a ruffenlie plaier
doth more content the hungrie
humors of the rude multitude,
and carieth better rellish in their
mouthes, than the bread of the
worde, which is the foode of the
soule.
            They are alwaies eating, & neuer
satisfied; euer seeing, and neuer
contented; continualie hearing, &

neuer wearied; they are greedie of
wickednes, and wil let no time, nor
spare for anie weather (so great is
their deuotion to make their pilgrimage)
to offer their penie to the
Diuel.
            It is the nature of the wicked
to finde alwaie such sweetenes in
their misdoings,The nature of sinne. as they wil neuer
giue ouer, til they be ouerthrowen
by Gods righteous iudgement, or
reclamed by the secret working of
his holie spirit.
            Looke vpon an whore-master,Caluin vpon Iob, chap. 74.
if he be once chased with his owne
lust, the Diuel blindes him, and
makes him take such pleasure in
his wickednes, that al his delight
is therein. If a mā be giuen to drō
               kennes,
or to other wickednes, he
wil hardlie be reclamed, or giue it
ouer, so great sweetenes doth he
tast in those vnseemelie pleasures,

if so I maie saie. Thus you maie
see the despisers of God do finde
sweetenes in al their misdoings.
            O my deere brethren, let not
your affections carie you to wickednes;
it behooueth you to be
verie warie, and circumspect how
you thrust your selues into publique
assemblies of prophane
plaies, since there be so manie inticements
vnto loosenes, & so manie
meanes to traine you to vnthriftines
there, as wonder it is, if
you haunt them but your soules
wilbe grieuouslie hurt.
            Pleasure their capitaine is so politique
an enimie, that he knowes
how to traine you into danger.
But when ye are once within his
lap, hard wil it be for you to escape.
because he can vse you so
freendlie, and so fitlie applie himselfe
to your appetites, that yee wil

rather wish to be in bondage with
him, than at libertie without him.
So that yee are warelie to shun his
ambushes, and so to retire, that Satan
be not able to endamage you
anie kind of waie. And that you
maie do it the better, it is meete
that yee be made priuie to his subtile
pollicies.
            It was trulie said of Chrysostome,
that none is hurt but of himselfe;
no man hath so dangerous a foe,
as that he caries about him. The
snake in our bosome, which wee
nurish with such care, wil soonest
annoie vs. Let vs throwe awaie
our fleshlie minds, and bridle our
affections. For if they maie haue
the hed, they wil neuer leaue running
til they haue ouerthrowen
vs, and brought vs to a wretched
state.
            In the beginning cuerie disease

is to be stopped, and cured; but if a
sore run ouer-long it wil growe
past the cure of the Physition.
            The Magistrate is therefore to
prouide in time a remedie to redresse
the mischiefes that are like
to ensue by this common plague.Dutie of a Magistrate.
They which gouerne the state are
to trie, and decerne each cause, that
they appeare not to deale vnaduisedlie.
They are to be diligent to
finde out the truth of things; and
when a matter is knowen of them
to be euil, it is their part to reforme
it; otherwise by negligence
they shal run into the displeasure
of God.
            The Magistrates hart must be as
the hart of a Lion.Virtues of a Magistrate. He is not to
shrinke in the Lordes cause, or to
stand in feare to reforme abuses of
the Common-weale, because of
some particular men of auctoritie.

He must haue both stoutnes, and
constancie to represse euil. And
then doubtles the Lord wil blesse
them in their enterprises. Let not
therefore the intercession of the
mightie mooue the Magistrate to
staic his sworde from doing iustice
on the wicked.
            The parcialitie which is vsed in
these daies for fauor, makes these
yonkers to become bolder by reason
of those liberties which are
granted them. They vphold themselues
by the countenance of their
maisters: as if their auctoritie were
a warrant sufficient for them to do
euil, and to beare them out against
good orders.
            Let not the abuse of the Sabboth
proceede further and further,
and in the meane while the iudge
be a looker on, daring not for feare
to reforme their disorder til al be

out of order.A note for Noble-men. Alas, that priuate affection
should so raigne in the
Nobilitie, that to pleasure, as they
thinke, their seruants, and to vphold
them in their vanitie, they
should restraine the Magistrates
from executing their office! what
credite can returne to the Noble,
to coūtenance his men to exercise
that qualitie which is not sufferable
in anie Cōmon-weale? wheras
it was an ancient custome, that
no man of Honor should reteine
anie man, but such as was excellent
in some one good qualitie or
other, whereby if occasion so serued,
he might get his owneliuing?
Then was euerie noble mās house
a Common-weale in it selfe: but
since the reteining of these Caterpillers,
the credite of Noble men
hath decaied, & they are thought
to be couetous by permitting their

seruants,Plaiers bold beggers. which cannot liue of thē
               selues,
and whome for neerenes
they wil not maintaine, to liue at
the deuotion or almes of other
men, passing from countrie to
countrie, from one Gentlemans
house to another, offering their
seruice, which is a kind of beggerie.
Who in deede, to speake more
trulie, are become beggers for their
seruants. For cōmonlie the goodwil
men beare to their Lordes,
makes them drawe the stringes of
their purses to extend their liberalitie
to them; where otherwise they
would not.
            By such infamous persons much
time is lost; and manie daies of honest
trauel are turned into vaine
exercises. Wherein is learned nothing
but abuse; poore men liuing
on their handie labor, are by them
trained vnto vnthriftines; scholers

by their gaudes are allured from
their studies.
            Thus the people are robbed;
youth corrupted; the Sabboth prophaned;
and of al these euils, who
are counted the vpholders but the
Noble, who of right should establish
the lawe of the Roman Traiane,
               Traiane the Emperor.
who commanded that no
plaier, iester, nor iugler should be
admitted in his Common-weale
to pick the purses of his subiects,
but that they should either learne
some occupation to mainteine
themselues in their owne houses,
or otherwise be banished out of
Rome. But now such like men, vnder
the title of their maisters or as
reteiners, are priuiledged to roaue
abroad, and permitted to publish
their mametree in euerie Temple
of God,Temples prophaned with plaies. and that throughout England,
vnto the horrible contempt

of praier. So that now the Sanctuarie
is become a plaiers stage,
and a den of theeues and adulterers.
            It was ordained in Rome by that
aforesaid Emperor,Why the Emp. Traiane ordained but 22. holie-daies throughout the yeere. that the Romans
should obserue but 22. holie
daies throughout the whole
yeere. For he thought without al
doubting, that the gods were more
serued on such daies as the Romans
did labor, than on such daies
as they rested: because the vices
were moe then which they did
commit, than the sacrifices they
did offer.
            And trust me I am of that opinion,God worst serued on the Sabboth daies. that the Lord is neuer so
                  •
               l
serued as on the holie-daies. For
then hel breakes loase. Then wee
permit our youth to haue their
swinge; and when they are out of
the sight of their maisters, such

gouernment haue they of themselues,
that what by il companie
they meete withal, & il examples
they learne at plaies, I feare me, I
feare me their harts are more alienated
in two houres from virtue,
than againe maie wel be amended
in a whole yeare.
            But let vs leaue to speake hereof,
and returne we to the further
abuse of these plaies, which is in
breach of the first Table of the cō
               mandements.
Is it not expreslie
commanded of God in Deuteronomie,Deu. 11, 5.
               That we should not take his
Name in vaine, either by swearing
rashlie, or falslie? Are we not flatlie
warned, if wee doe infringe the
same, that he wil not hold vs giltles?
yet how wel this commandement
is kept at plaies, no man
which resortes to heare them, but
can report.
            
               
How often is the sacred,The blasphemous speaches vsed at plaies. and reuerend
Name of God blasphemed
on the stages, without regard of
his iudgements! Is not he held the
gallantest rufler, that can rap out
the most disguised othes, to tempt
the Lord withal! As who should
saie, it were allowable to sweare, so
it were done couertlie. As if it were
none offence to resemble the wicked;
and that to dissemble were
commendable.
            Christ hath willed vs not to
sweare at al,Matth. 5, verse. 34. but these felowes
thinke they maie iugle with God,
as they do with the world. Therefore
to verefie their false-hoodes
they take the names of Iupiter, Saturne,
Iuno, & such like prophane
Gods, as they are called, and Goddesses
of the Gentils, and that they
thinke they maie doe lawfulie.
But, if that be not lawful which by

the Scripture is not warranted, I
dare auar that that swearing is as
odious as the other; and as plainlie
forbidden by the worde of God.
As we maie read in Exodus;
               Exod. 23, verse. 13. where
among other things that God setteth
downe for the Israelits to do,
he giueth this vnto them as a principal
charge, that they make no
mention of the names of other
Gods; that they open not their lips
to speake of them; or to sweare by
them, or otherwise. And herevpon
Dauid saith,Psal. 16, 4. 
               That the sorowes of
them which offer to another GOD
shalbe multiplied, their offerings of
bloud, saith he, wil I not offer, neither
make mention of their names
with my lips.
            
            How then can these men excuse
them-selues,Plaiers open idolaters. that they haue not
offered this sacrifice of bloud!
when they not onelie name those

prophane gods in their mouthes,
and take them as witnesses of their
falshood, shal wee not saie they
haue confented to idolatrie? I refer
their cause to be considered of
the learned, my self maie not passe
beyond my latchet: but this much
I dare affirme, that these men
which dallie with God with their
blasphemous swearings, are not
out of the danger of his indignation,
and without repentance shalbe
no partakers of Christ, nor of
his merites.
            For al their othes what are they
but open reproches against the
Name of God? When these men
sweare, as they sweare at aduenture,
doth it not declare that they
regard not the Name of GOD,
which ought to be holden holie in
our sight VVho so sweareth vainlie
by the Name of the Lord,
               Leuit. 19, verse. 12. 
               defileth it.
               
The Israelitish womans sonne for
blaspheming the Name of the
Lord,Leuit. 24, verse. 10. 11, &c. was stoned to death.
            How is it,Who can heare plaies and not abhor them. my deere brethren,
that we can heare the Name of the
Lord vttered from the mouth of
these blasphemers, without casting
downe our heads, and acknowleging
his infinite maiestie!
How is it that we can heare, without
stopping our eares, so manie
counterfet othes vttered of plaiers!
which,Hearers of plaies are accessarie to the wickednes of plaiers. as light as they seeme in
our eies, are great reproches, and
iniuries to the Maiestie of GOD.
Wherevnto yee are accessarie, inasmuch
as yee can vouchsafe to
heare them without scruple of cō
               science.
But it appeareth yee haue
litle conscience, and therefore be
so litle moued.
            Others there be which flatter
themselues in euil,Defenders of plaies. accōpting that

pretious which is most prophane.
They wil stand in contention, and
defend the cause of the wicked,
yea they haue prepared argumēts
against Gods children; so smal
power haue they to withstand the
fancies which the diuel putteth into
their heads. Wel, let these men
make their arguments, as sure as
they can, though they haue an
hundred replies in the defence of
the wicked, yea, and such as maie
seeme to carie good likelihood for
the maintenance of their cause:
yet shal they be as nothing, but fal
to the earth, when the iudge of the
cause shal argue against them.
What shal I saie? wickednes so encreaseth,
and groweth more and
more to ripenes, when men giue it
scope, & seeke not to redresse it in
conuenient time.A note of Magistrats. When the wicked
are suffered and not repressed,

we must needs saie the Magistrate
is a cause of such misbehauior.
Sixe score yeeres before the floud,
the world did so exceede in voluptuousnes
and pleasure, as if the
Lord had left to take the charge of
men: but whilest they liued so at
pleasure & ease, their arrainement
was preparing in heauen; & when
their sinne was ripe, the Lord pronounced
iudgement against those
wicked liuers; rained from heauen,
& made a general submersion
of the whole worlde. I cannot otherwise
think, but that the wrath
of God hanges ouer vs, and that
our arrainment is alredie drawen:
we lacke but our iudgment, which
can pronounce nothing but death
and damnation, the sinnes of al
men are so greeuous.
            If we would consider the shortnes
of our life, which with the turning

of an hande maie be cut off,
we could not be so careles of our
selues. But the pleasures of this
life so beguile vs, & drawe vs from
the cōsideration of our estate, that
we are vtterlie vnmindful of our
duties, and forgetful of God, and
his worde. But let vs not thinke
that God in sparing vs of his mercie,
doth giue libertie for to sinne;
as though we might do wickedlie
because we are vnpunished. Oh let
vs not delaie our amendment til
he smite, but rather with the repenting
Niniuites aduisedlie preuent
his iudgements: otherwise,
when we shal saie like reprobates,
Peace,
               1. Thess. 5, verse. 3. 
               and salfetie, then shal come
vpon vs sudden destruction.
            
            Alas that we should so vnmeasurablie folowe those vanities,
which God condemneth. Those
pleasures of the stage, what are

they, but the drifts of Satan, which
he vseth to blind our eies withal,
the more easilie to carie vs from
the obedience of GOD! Such
knacks from time to time he hath
set vp, and men haue willinglie folowed
that which they haue liked
of, and which the pleasure of the
flesh hath drawen them vnto. Yea
now adaies we see manie that onlie
seeke after those vaine delights,
counting no time wel spent, but
that they consume in beholding
of gaudes.
            And albe these pastimes were
not (as they are) to be condemned
simplie of their owne nature: yet
because they are so abused they
are abhominable. For the foole no
sooner showeth himselfe in his
colors to make men merrie, but
straight-waie lightlie there foloweth
some vanitie, not onlie superfluous,

but beastlie and wicked.
            Yet are we so caried awaie with
his vnseemelie gesture, and vnreuerend
scorning, that wee seeme
onelie to be delighted in him; and
are not content to sport our selues
with modest mirth, as the matter
giues occasion, vnles it be intermixed
with knauerie, dronken
merie-ments, craftie coosenings,
vndecent iuglings, clownish conceites,
& such other cursed mirth,
as is both odious in the sight of
God, & offensiue to honest eares,
being forbidden by S. Paule in his
epistle vnto the Ephesians, where
he willeth vs expreslie, that Neither
filthines,
               Ephes. 5, 3. 4. 
               neither foolish talking,
nor iesting, which are things
not comelie, should be once named
among vs. Al which things wee
now count but light sinnes (so
blinde we are, and so far past our

selues, & the knowledge of God.)
            No zelous hart but must needs
bleed, to see how manie Christian
soules are there swalowed vp in
the whirle-poole of diuelish impudencie.
Whosoeuer shal visit
the chappel of Satan,Theaters the chappels of Satan. I meane the
Theater, shal finde there no want
of yong ruffins, nor lacke of harlots,
vtterlie past al shame: who
presse to the fore-frunt of the scaffoldes,
to the end to showe their
impudencie, and to be as an obiect
to al mens eies. Yea, such is their
open shameles behauior, as euerie
man maie perceaue by their wanton
gestures, wherevnto they are
giuen: yea, they seeme there to be
like brothels of the stewes.The open wickednes of harlots at plaies. For
often without respect of the place,
and companie which behold them
they commit that filthines openlie,
which is horrible to be done in

secret; as if whatsoeuer they did,
were warranted. For neither reuerence,
iustice, nor anie thing beside
can gouerne them.
            Alas,An admonition to Magistrats. that youth should become
so diuelish, and voide of the feare
of God. Let Magistrates assure
themselues, that without speedie
redresse al things wil growe so far
out of order, as they wilbe past remedie.
Shamefastnes, & modestie
is quite banished from yong men:
they are vtterlie shameles, stubborne,
and impudent.
            It was wel said of Caluine, that
a man setled in euil, wil make but
a scofof religion. He preacheth in
vaine, that preacheth vnto the
deafe. Tel manie of these men of
the Scripture, they wil scof, and
turne it vnto a iest. Rebuke them
for breaking the Sabboth day, they
wil saie, you are a man of the Sabboth,

you are verie precise; you wil
allowe vs nothing; you wil haue
nothing but the worde of God;
you wil permit vs no recreation,
but haue men like Asses, who neuer
rest but when they are eating.
            Seeke to withdrawe these felowes
from the Theater vnto the
sermon, they wil saie, By the preacher
they maie be edified, but by
the plaier both edified and delighted.
So that in them the saieng of
S. Paule is verified, where he saith,
that The wisedome of the flesh is nothing
but enimitie against GOD.
               Rom. 8, 7.
How smal heede take they of thē
               felues,
which suffer their owne
wicked affections to withdrawe
them from God, and his worde.
We neede not voluntarilie seeke
our owne destruction. For he that
is virtuouslie disposed, shal finde
lewde persons enough to withdrawe

him from wel doing by the
promise of pleasure, and delightful
pastime,Theaters the schoolehouse of Satan, and chappels of il counsel. wherevnto we are naturalie
inclined, vnto the Schoolehouse
of Satan, and chappel of il
counsel, where he shal see so much
iniquitie, & loasenes; and so great
outrage and scope of sinne, that it
is a wonder, if he returne not either
wounded in conscience, or
changed in life.
            I would wish therefore al maisters,
Counsel to maisters. not onlie to withdraw themselues,
but their seruants also frō
such wicked assemblies. For it is
alwaies wisedome to shun the occasions
of euil.
            Youth wilbe withdrawen by
companie, if they be not restrained
of their libertie. They neede
not to seeke out for schoole-masters,
they can learne euil too fastof
them-selues, and are pregnant

enough at home to learne vnhappines.
Manie of nature honest, and
tractable, haue bene altered by
those showes and spectacles, and
become monsterous. Mans minde,
which of it selfe is proane vnto
vice, is not to be pricked forward
vnto wantonnes, but bridled: if it
be left vnto it selfe, it hardlie standeth;
if it be driuen forth, it runneth
headlong.
            Flee far from Baby lon, yee that
carrie the Lordes vessels.Rom. 6, 3. Forsomuch
as yee are baptized into
Christ, it standeth you vpō to be
holie both of bodie and minde, &
to dedicate your felues to his seruice,
which yee shal neuer do, vnles
ye withdraw your selues from
the inticements of vanitie, and eschue
the occasions of euil, which
that yee maie the better do, yee are
to fasten your eies vpon God, by

whome we are sanctified.
            Let not the examples of the wicked
be a president vnto vs;Ilexamples to be shunned. neither
let vs be drawen away to euil with
the multitude. Custome shal but
make vs bold in sin, and the companie
of scorners make vs more
impudent, and disordered of life.
            It is not enough for vs to excuse
our selues by the doings of other
men; it wil not be taken for an
excuse, although we could alleage
that euerie man doth as wee doe.
For it is no meanes to acquite vs
before God, to saie that other be
no better than our selues. I would
rather wish that the euil conuersation
of others might be an occasion
to drawe vs backe; least perhaps
we be wrapped in the vices that
raigne in al the wicked, and so be
partakers of the punishment due
to them. For we are not to walke

as men that looke but onlie vpon
the creatures, but our part is to set
God before our eies, whose presence
we cannot possiblie escape.
            It is maruelous to consider how
the gesturing of a plaier,Motion of the bodie. which
Tullie termeth the eloquence of
the bodie, is of force to moue, and
prepare a man to that which is il.
For such thinges be disclosed to
the eie, and to the eare, as might a
great deale better be kept close.
Whereby a double offence is committed;
first by those dissolute
plaiers, which without regard of
honestie, are not ashamed to exhibite
the filthiest matters they can
deuise to the sight of men: secondly
by the beholders, which vouchsalfe
to heare and behold such filthie
things, to the great losse both
of themselues and the time. There
cōmeth much euil in at the eares,

but more at the eies, by these two
open windowes death breaketh
into the soule. Nothing entereth
in more effectualie into the memorie,
than that which commeth
by seeing, things heard do lightlie
passe awaie, but the tokens of that
which wee haue seene, saith Petrarch,
sticke fast in vs whether we
wil or no: and yet they enter not
into vs, vnles we be willing, except
verie seldome.
            Alack what violence carieth vs
awaie, to be merie an hower, and
alwaies after to be sad; to see that
at one time, which a thousande
times after wee shal rue that euer
we sawe it!
            Manie haue ben intangled with
the webs of these Spiders, who
would gladlie haue bene at libertie
when they could not. The
webs are so subtillie spun, that

there is no man that is once with
in them, that can auoide them
without danger. None can come
within those snares that maie escape
vntaken, be she maide, matrone,
or whatsoeuer; such force
haue their inchantements of pleasure
to drawe the affections of the
mind.Snares of plaies.
            
            This inward fight hath vanquished
the chastitie of manie women;
some by taking pittie on the
deceitful teares of the stagelouers,
haue bene mooued by their complaint
to rue on their secret frends,
whome they haue thought to
haue tasted like torment; some hauing
noted the ensamples how
maidens restrained from the marriage
of those whome their frends
haue misliked, haue there learned
a policie to preuent their parents,
by stealing them awaie; some seeing

by ensample of the stage plaier
one carried with too much liking
of an other mans wife, hauing noted
by what practise she hath bene
assailed and ouertaken, haue not
failed to put the like in effect in
earnest, that was afore showen in
iest.
            The wilines & craft of the stage
is not yet so great, as is without
on the scaffoldes. For that they
which are euil disposed, no sooner
heare anie thing spoken that maie
serue their turne, but they applie it
vnto themselues. Alas, saie they to
their familiar by them, Gentlewoman,
is it not pittie this passioned
louer should be so martyred.
And if he finde her inclining to
foolish pittie, as commonlie such
women are, then he applies the
matter to himselfe, and saies that
he is likewise caried awaie with

the liking of her; crauing that pittie
to be extended vpō him, as she
seemed to showe toward the afflicted
amorous stager.
            These running headed louers
are growen so perfect scholers by
long continuance at this schoole,
that there is almost no worde spoken,
but they can make matter of
it to serue their turne. They can so
surelie discouer the conceits of the
minde, and so cunninglie handle
themselues; & are growen so subtile
in working their matters, that
neither the ielosie of Iuno, who suspecteth
al things; nor the streight
keeping of Danaes maie debar; nor
the watchfulnes of Argoes with
his hundred eies espie.
            Credite me,Flie Theaters you that would be honest. there can be found
out no stronger engine to batter
the honestie as wel of wedded
wiues, as the chastitie of vnmarried

maides and widowes, than are
the hearing of common plaies.
There wanton wiues fables, and
pastorical songes of loue, which
they vse in their comical discourses
(al which are taken out of the
secret armorie of Venus, & practising
bawderie) turne al chastitie
vpside downe, & corrupt the good
disposition & manners of youth,
insomuch that it is a miracle, if
there be foūd anie either woman,
or maide, which with these spectacles
of strange lust, is not oftentimes
inflamed euen vnto furie.
            The nature of their Comedies
are, for the most part, after one
manner of nature, like the tragical
Comedie of Calistus; where the
bawdresse Scelestina inflamed the
maiden Melibeia with her forceries.
Do wee not vse in these discourses
to counterfet witchcraft,

charmed drinkes, & amorous potions,
thereby to drawe the affections
of men, & to stir them vp vnto
lust, to like euen those whome
of them-selues they abhor. The
ensamples whereof stirre vp the
ignorant multitude to seeke by
such vnlawful meanes the loue, &
goodwil of others.
            I can tel you a storie of like
practise vsed of late by a ielous
wife to her husband,A strange example. whose hart
being, as she thought, estranged otherwise
than of custome, did practise
with a sorceresse to haue some
powder, which might haue force
to renew her husbandes wonted
goodwil towardes her: but it had
such a virtue in the operation, as it
wel nigh brought him his bane:
for his memorie therby was gone:
so that if God had not dealt miraculouslie
with him, by reuealing

it, it had cost him his life. The like
we read of Lucullus and Lucretius,
who by drinking such amorous
confections lost first their wits, &
afterward their liues.
            The deuise of carrieng and recarrieng
letters by landresses, practising
with pedlers to transport
their tokens by colorable meanes,
to sel their marchandise, and other
kind of policies to beguile fathers
of their children, husbands of their
wiues, gardens of their wardes,
and maisters of their seruants,
is it not aptlie taught in the
Schoole of abuseHe meaneth plaies, who are not vnfitlie so called.? But hush no
more.
            I am sorie this schoole is not
pluckt downe by the Magistrate;
and the schoole-masters banished
this citie.London. Thus much I wil tel
them, if they suffer these brothel
houses to continue, or do in anie

wise allowe them, the Lord wil
saie vnto them, as the Psalmist
saith, If thou sawest a theefe thou
wentest with him, and haddest thy
part with adulterers; thou hast done
these things, and because I haue held
my peace, thou hast beleeued, wicked
man, that I am like vnto thee, but I
wil accuse thee, &c.
            
            The reuerend word of God, &
histories of the Bible set forth on
the stage by these blasphemous
plaiers, are so corrupted with their
gestures of scurrilitie, and so interlaced
with vncleane, and whorish
speeches, that it is not possible to
drawe anie profite out of the doctrine
of their spiritual moralities.
For that they exhibite vnder
laughing that which ought to be
taught and receiued reuerendlie.
So that their auditorie maie returne
madde merie in minde, but

none comes awaie reformed in
manners. And of al abuses this is
most vndecent and intollerable, to
suffer holie things to be handled
by men so prophane, and defiled
by interpositiō of dissolute words.
            The writers of our time are so
led awaie with vaineglorie,Against Auctors of plaies. that
their onlie endeuor is to pleasure
the humor of men; & rather with
vanitie to content their mindes,
than to profit them with good ensample.
The notablest lier is become
the best Poet; he that can
make the most notorious lie, and
disguise falshood in such sort, that
he maie passe vnperceaued, is held
the best writer. For the strangest
Comedie brings greatest delectation,
and pleasure. Our nature is
led awaie with vanitie, which the
auctor perceauing frames himself
with nouelties and strange trifles

to content the vaine humors of
his rude auditors, faining countries
neuer heard of; monsters and
prodigious creatures that are not:
as of the Arimaspie, of the Grips,
the Pigmeies, the Cranes, & other
such notorious lies. And if they
write of histories that are knowen,
as the life of Pompeie; the martial
affaires of Caesar, and other worthies,
they giue them a newe face,
and turne them out like counterfeites
to showe themselues on the
stage. It was therefore aptlie applied
of him,Writers of these daies. who likened the writers
of our daies vnto Tailors, who
hauing their sheers in their hand,
can alter the facion of anie thing
into another forme, & with a new
face make that seeme new which
is old. The shreds of whose curiositie
our Historians haue now stolen
from them, being by practise

become as cunning as the Tailor
to set a new vpper bodie to an old
coate; and a patch of their owne
to a peece of anothers.
            So that yee shal find in al their
writings three differences,The best thing at plaies is starke naught. manie
things good, manie things indifferent,
and manie strake naught:
but by reason that thing which is
good is applied vnto il purpose, &
mixed with euil, the good hath
changed propertie, and is become
of the nature of the bad. Otherwise
goodnes & badnes, being two
cōtraries, cannot be made to agree
together. And therefore there can
be no difference of choice, but al
must be euil: because it is generallie
il applied, and by altering propertie,
hath changed his nature.
Yet neuertheles that it keepeth his
virtue, of being good, and reduced
to his proper substance.
            
               
I do not denie, but that writers
inal their workes maie be pleasant,
so far forth as they be profitable,
and swarue not from honestie,
and therein deserue commendation.
But what praise maie they
deserue who set forth those works
which are vaine and naught, and
conteine in them no matter of
good example, who write of those
things, which may corrupt the life
of men, thereby making them
worse by ten to one, than they
were before they heard them?
            What doe they leaue behind
them? monumentes of wanton
wicked life, and doting things for
men of these latter daies. O Lord,
how do those▪ wanton wordes of
theirs intice vnto wicked life, and
with a poisoned baite allure men
to sinne! Their wanton speeches
do pearse our secret thoughts, and

moue vs thereby vnto mischiefe,
and prouoke our members to vncleannes.
            But some perhaps wil saie,An Obiection. The
Noble man delighteth in such
things, whose humors must be
contented, partlie for feare, & partlie
for commoditie: and if they
write matters pleasant, they are
best preferred in court among the
cunning heads.
            Cunning heads, whose wits are
neuer wel exercised, but in the practise
of such exploits! But are those
things to be suffered and praised,Answere.
because they please the rich, and
content the Noble man, that alwaies
liues in ease? not so. A two
legged Asse maie be clothed in
gold, a man of honor maie be corrupt
of iudgement, though by his
auctoritie he maie seeme wiser
than Socrates, whome Phoebus for

wisedome iudged to beare the bel.
Those goodlie persons, if they be
voide of virtue, maie wel be counted
like faire clothes ouer a foule
wal; big bladers ful of wind, yet of
no waight. Where wealth is abundant,
pleasure is present: pleasure
bringeth folie into estimation; and
thereby the light of reason is vtterlie
extinguished.
            Who writeth for reward,Writers for reward. neither
regardeth virtue, nor truth;
but runs vnto falshood, because he
flattereth for commoditie. Neede
and flatterie are two brothers, and
the eldest seruitors in the Court:
they were both scholers vnto Aristippus,
and learned both of them
to applie themselues to the time,
& their matter to the disposition?
No maruel then though none can
please Dionysius but Aristippus, nor
anie the courtier but the flatterer.
            
               
The rich that followeth the pleasures
of this life,Conditions of the worldlie rich. maie not abide to
be reformed, or to be drawen away
from his desires, be they neuer so
wicked and vnseemelie. Talke to
him of amendement, he wil saie,
he is not dieng. He that reprehends
him, is a Preacher; he that
sooths him, is a Saint. Who meddels
with nettles cannot passe vnstinged:
and he that deales with
men of auctoritie otherwise than
maie like them, cannot scape from
his danger without hurt. I maie
not staie longer on this point.
            As I haue had a saieng to these
versi-fieng Plaie-makers:Against training vp of boies to plaies. so must
I likewise deale with shameles inactors.
When I see by them yong
boies, inclining of themselues vnto
wickednes, trained vp in filthie
speeches▪ vnnatural and vnseemelie
gestures, to be brought vp by

these Schoole-masters in bawderie,
and in idlenes, I cannot chuse
but with teares and griefe of hart
lament.
            O with what delight can the father
behold his sonne bereft of
shamefastnes,Plaiers, the schoolemaisters of sin, in the schoole of abuse. & trained vp to impudencie!
How proane are they
of themselues, and apt to receiue
instruction of their lewde teachers,
which are the Schoolemasters
of sinne in the schoole of abuse!
what do they teach them, I praie
you, but to foster mischiefe in their
youth, that it maie alwaies abide
in them, and in their age bring
them sooner vnto hel?
            And as for those stagers themselues,Disposition of plaiers for the most part.
are they not commonlie
such kind of men in their conuersation,
as they are in profession?
Are they not as variable in hart, as
they are in their partes? are they

not as good practisers of Bawderie,Plaiers can not better be compared than to the Camelion.
                as inactors? Liue they not in
such sort themselues, as they giue
precepts vnto others? doth not
their talke on the stage declare the
nature of their disposition? doth
not euerie one take that part which
is proper to his kind? doth not the
Plough-mans tong walke of his
plough; the Sea-faring man of his
mast, cable, and saile; the Soldier
of his harnes, speare, and shield; &
bawdie mates of bawdie matters?
Aske them, if in their laieng out
of their partes, they choose not
those partes which is most agreeing
to their inclination, and that
they can best discharge? And looke
what euerie of them doth most
delight in, that he can best handle
to the contentment of others. If it
be a roisting, bawdie, and lasciuious
part, wherein are vnseemelie

speeches, & that they make choise
of them as best answering, & proper
to their manner of plaie: maie
we not saie, by how much he exceedes
in his gesture, he delightes
himselfe in his part? & by so much
it is pleasing to his disposition and
nature? If (it be his nature) to be a
bawdie plaier, and he delight in
such filthie & cursed actions, shal
we not thinke him in his life to be
more disordered, and to abhor
virtue?
            But they perhaps wil saie,An Obiection. that
such abuses as are handled on the
stage, others by their examples,
are warned to beware of such euils,
to amendment.
            In deed if their auctoritie were
greater than the wordes of the
Scripture;Answere. or their zeale of more
force than of the preacher, I might
easilie be persuaded to thinke, that

men by them might be called vnto
good life. But when I see the word
of truth proceeding from the hart,
and vttered by the mouth of the
reuerend preachers, to be receaued
of the most part into the eare, and
but of a fewe rooted in the hart: I
cannot by anie means beleeue that
the wordes proceeding from a prophane
plaier, and vttered in scorning
sort, interlaced with filthie,
lewde, & vngodlie speeches, haue
greater force to mooue men vnto
virtue, than the wordes of truth
vttered by the godlie Preacher,
whose zeale is such as that of Moses,Exo. 32, 32
who was contented to be raced
out of the booke of life;Rom. 9, 3. and of
Paule, who wished to be separated
from Christ for the welfare of his
brethren. If the good life of a man
be a better instruction to repentāce
than the tong, or words, why

do not plaiers, I beseech you, leaue
examples of goodnes to their posteritie?
But which of them is so
zealous, or so tendereth his owne
saluatiō, that he doth amend himselfe
in those pointes, which, as
they saie, others should take heede
of? Are they not notoriouslie
knowen to be those men in their
life abroade, as they are on the
stage, roisters, brallers, il-dealers,
bosters, louers, loiterers, ruffins?
So that they are alwaies exercised
in plaieng their parts; and practising
wickednes; making that an
art, to the end they might the better
gesture it in their partes. For
who can better plaie the ruffin thā
a verie ruffin? who better the louer,
than they who make it a common
exercise? To conclude,Chiefe end, of plaies. the
principal end of all their interludes
is to feede the world with

sights, & fond pastimes; to iuggle
in good earnest the monie out of
other mens purses into their owne
hands.
            What shal I saie?Plaiers infamous persons. They are
infamous men; and in Rome were
thought worthie to be expelled,Plaiers banished out of Rome.
albe there was libertie enough to
take pleasure.
            In the primatiue Church they
were kept out from the Communion
of Christians,In the primatiue Church plaiers kept from the Communion. and neuer remitted
til they had perfourmed
publike penance. And thervpon S.
Cyprian in a certaine Epistle counseleth
a Bishop; not to receiue a
plaier into the pension of the
Church, by which they were norished,
til there was an expresse act
of penance with protestation to renounce
an art so infamous. And
thus much for those plaiers.
            Some haue obiected,Obiection. that by

these publique plaies manie forbeare
to do euil for feare to be
publiquelie reprehended. And
for that cause they wil saie it
was tolerated in Rome, wherein
Emperors were touched, though
they were present.
            But to such it maie be answered,Answere.
first that in disguised plaiers
giuen ouer to al sortes of dissolutenes,
is not found so much as
a wil to do good, seing they care
for nothing lesse than for virtue.
Secondlie, that is not a good
meanes to correct sinne. For that
if it be secret, it ought not to be
reuealed openlie, but by such
meanes to be reformed as Christ
himselfe alloweth in his Gospel.
If,
               Matth. 18, verse. 15. saith he, thy brother trespasse
against thee, speaking of those
secret & particular sinnes, which
are not open, and made knowen

to others, go and tel him his fault
betweene thee and him alone; if
he heare thee, thou hast wonne thy
brother. But if he heare thee not,
               Matth. 18, verse. 16.
               take yet with thee one or two, that
by the mouth of two or three witnesses
euerie worde maie be confirmed.
               17.
               And if he wil not vouchsafe
to heare them, tel it vnto the
Church: (which is, to those ancient
& expert men of the Iewes
which were appointed to reforme
manners, and execute discipline.
For those assemblies of
ancient Fathers did represent the
Church; because they had the
charge thereof appointed vnto
them) and if he refuse to he are the
Church also, let him be vnto thee
as an Heathen man, and a Publicane.
            
            You see then that euerie fault
being priuatelie knowen is to be

kept secret, and not to be openlie
vttered to the defamation of the
offender. And that on the otherside,
if it be a matter openlie
knowen, it is to be put to the reprehension
of the Magistrate,
and not of the plaier, whose reprehension
is as vnreuerend, and
odious, as the reprehension of a
Magistrate is decent, and commendable.
            The antiquitie of plaieng isAn obiection answered.
likewise often vsed for an argument
to proue it allowable. But
the custome of euil is not to be
maintained,Against the antiquitie of plaies. because of antiquitie.
Gods truth is not to be oppressed
vnder that color, what
examples of antiquitie soeuer do
serue to maintaine wickednes, I
am not bounde to allowe of
them, or to maintaine them. For
my part I disallowe al those antiquities

which are contrarie to
the Scriptures. Those spectacles
were vsed of the Gentils to the
setting vp of idolatrie, and to the
honor of their false gods: as
Pesa and Elis. Such games were
exercised in the honor of Iupiter
worshipped on the hil Olympus.
Theseus ordained in the
straightes of Corinth the Isthemian
games in the honor of Neptune.
There were also Pythij
ludi, Ludifunebres, Lupercalia,
Saturnalia, and Circenses ludi,
and manie other deuised as wel
by Romans as Greekes to the great
charges of their Cōmon-weales.
The exercise whereof was both
bloudie and beastlie, and yet among
them sufferable and allowed.
            Notwithstanding, these are
not examples vnto Christians to

allowe that for good, which was
sufferable among them. For
then one might slaie another;
one might wound another; then
should we encounter with wild
beastes; our hartes should then
delight in shedding bloud; and
be al giltie of the death of the
murdered.
            As for the plaiers in these daies
which exhibite their games for
lucre sake, as did those two Romans
Esopus,
               The accōpt which good men haue of our cōmon gamesters, and plaiers. and Arossus, who
showed their wonderful cunning
on the stage to gather welth
and substance; they are of the
most part of men either of auctoritie,
or learning held for vagabondes,
& infamous persons;
they maie aptlie be likened vnto
droanes, which wil not labor
to bring in, but liue of the labors
of the paineful gatherers. They

are therefore to be thrust out of
the Bee-hiue of a Christian
Common-weale.
            This vnhonest trade of gaine,
hath driuen manie from their
occupations, in hope of easier
thrift. What successe they haue
had, some of them haue reported,
finding the Prouerbe true,
that, Il gotten goodes are il spent.

                as Valerian
writeth, kept so great grauitie,
that it would receaue into it
no stage-plaiers: because their
arguments, for the most parte,
contained the actes and doinges
of harlots; to the end that the custome
of beholding such things
might not also cause a licence of
folowing them.Harke Magistrates of London. I would to God
the Magistrates of our citie of
London would haue the like
foresight. The permission of

corrupted this citie;London defamed thorough plaies there vsed. and

into slander: the examples
of Gods iudgement is at this present

The sinne of whoredome being
winked at by the children of
Beniamin, they were punished
by the destructiō of their whole

and giue our selues to
maintaine the wicked in their
lewdenes, wee are to looke for
none other than a general confusion.
For the Lord himselfe
wil take part against the wicked
to destroie them. They maie be
wel let alone for a time, but yet
that which is deferred wil one
daie come.

            Wherfore,The conclusion. my deere brethren,

               20. 
               For
the Lord is far from the wicked;

their house shalbe destroied, there
shalbe none end of their plagues,
their light shalbe put out. Yeelde
not your selues to them, lest ye
perish in their wickednes; yeeld
not your selues to those vaine
pleasures and delights. For yee
shal find nothing more hurtful,
nor preiudicial to your soules;
they depriue you of al good cogitations;
enimies they are vnto
virtue; increasers of wickednes;
the nurses of al vice; the corrupters
of manners; the subuerters
of religion; and so bring at
the end vnto euerlasting sorowes
and gnashing of teeth in the pit
of hel.
            The Lord of his infinite mercie
looke vpon vs, and direct vs
with his holie spirit; and so order
our liues, that wee maie be
holie and acceptable in his sight.

The Lord open our eies, that
we maie see our sinne, and loath
it in our selues, represse it in the
wicked, and condemne it in our
Common-weale. Lord increase
our deuotion, that our hartes
maie be made zelous to heare
the word of God, which is a lanterne
vnto our feete, and a light
vnto our pathes.
            
            Preserue this Church of England;
increase thy flocke vniuersal;
be a safegard vnto vs against
the force of our enimies,
for our trust is in thee.
            Blesse our worthie Princesse, &
renowmed soueraigne Queene

her state, as the seate of Dauid;
let thy spirit direct her doings in

zelous Iosias to vphold the state
of the true Church; to roote

out superstition and idolatrie;
that she maie be as a continual
enimie to the enimies of thy
truth. Be thou, ô Lord, her supporter,
that thou by her maist
defend thine owne cause.
            Merciful God, inspire her honorable
Counsel with the wisedome
of Salomon, that their
counsel maie be wise and good;
and their harts linked vnseparablie
together to the preseruation
of her state, and the welfare of

            Lord strengthen the hand of
Iustice against the wicked, that
our Magistrates maie roote out
the memorial of wickednes from
the earth, that our Realme maie
florish, & our liues be as a lampe
