            THE CONTENTS of this Dialogue.
            
            
               FIrſt, it ſheweth mans miſery in nature, with the meanes of recouery.
               Secondly, it ſharply inueigheth againſt the iniquity of the time, and common corruption of the world.
               Thirdly, it ſheweth the markes of the children of God, and of the Reprobates, with the apparant ſignes of ſaluation and damnation.
               Fourthly, it declareth how hard a thing it is to enter into life: and how few ſhall enter.
               Fiftly, it laieth open the ignorance of the world, with the obiections of the ſame.
               Laſt of all, it publiſheth and proclaimeth the ſweet promiſes of the Goſpel, with the abundant mercies of God, to all that repent, beleeue and truly turne vnto him.
            
         
         
            
            To the right Worſhipfull Sir IVLIVS CAESAR Knight, one of the Maſters of the Requeſts to the Kings Maieſtie, Iudge of the high Court of Admiraltie, and Maſter of S. Catherines: A. D. wiſheth all good things in Chriſt Ieſus.
            
               HAuing finiſhed (Right worſhipfull) and made ready for the Preſſe this little Dialogue: I bethought me (ſith the common maner of all, that write any bookes in this age, is to dedicát the ſame to one or to other of great place) to whom I might dedicate theſe my poore labours. At laſt I did reſolue with my ſelfe,

none to be more fit then your worſhip: both in regard of ſome affinity in the fleſh, as alſo becauſe of thoſe manifold good parts, wherewith the Almighty hath endued you. Hauing therefore none other thing to preſent your worſhip withall (in token of a thankfull heart for your curteſies ſhewed towards me) behold, I doe heere ſend vnto you this third fruite of my labours now publiſhed. Moſt humbly beſeeching you to take it in good worth: not weighing the value of the thing, which is of no value, but the ſimple and good minde and meaning of the giuer. This worke doth ſharply reproue and euict the world of ſinne, and therefore is like to find many deadly enemies, which with cruell hatred will moſt eagerly purſue it vnto death. Zoilus alſo and his fellowes, I know, will bitterly carpe at it. Therefore it flieth vnto your Worſhip for protection, and humbly deſireth to take Sanctuary vnder your wings. Wherefore I humbly intreat you to take vpon you the patronage and defence of it: that by your meanes it may be deliuered both from the calumnious obloquies of euill diſpoſed perſons, and alſo from

the worlds malignity; ſo as it may take no iniury. And concerning this little volume, the ſumme of the matter of it, you ſhall finde in the Epiſtle to the Reader. As concerning the manner, heere is no great matter in learning, wit, arte, eloquence, or ingenious inuention: (for I haue heerein ſpecially reſpected the ignorant and vulgar ſort, whoſe edification I doe chiefely aime at) yet ſomewhat there is, which may concern the learned, & giue them ſome contentment. Whatſoeuer it be, I leaue it with your Worſhip, beſeeching you to giue it entertainement. And ſo I doe moſt humbly take my leaue: commending both your ſelfe, your good wife, and your whole family to the mercifull protection of the euerliuing God. From South-Shoobery in Eſſex. April. 10. Anno Dom. 1601.
            
               Your Worſhips to command in the Lord, ARTHVR DENT.
            
         
         
            
            THE EPISTLE TO the Reader.
            
            
               GEntle Reader, ſeeing my little Sermon of Repentance, ſome few yeeres ſince publiſhed, hath beene ſo well accepted of: I haue, for thy further good publiſhed this Dialogue, being the third fruit of my labour: wiſhing to it the like ſucceſſe, that God thereby may haue the glory, and thou who art the Reader comfort. I haue, in one part of this Dialogue, produced ſome of the ancient writers, and ſome of the wiſe Heathen alſo, to teſtifie vpon their oath in their owne language, and to beare witneſſe of the vglineſſe of ſome vices, which we in this age make light of: which I wiſh may not be offenſiue to any. In other parts of this worke, I do in a manner relinquiſh them. But in this caſe I haue in my weake iudgement, thought them to be of ſome good vſe, to ſhew forth thus much: that if

we doe not in time repent, forſake our ſinnes, & ſeeke after God, both the auncient Chriſtian fathers (whoſe eies ſaw not that we ſee, nor their eares heard that we heare) yea the very Heathen alſo ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt vs. Let none therefore ſtumble at it. But if any doe, let them remember I am in a Dialogue, not in a Sermon. I write to all of all ſorts: I ſpeake not to ſome few of one ſort. But that which is done herein, is not much more then that of the Apoſtle (As ſome of your own Poets haue ſaid, Act. 17.) which is warrantable. One thing, deare Chriſtian, I pray thee let me beg of thee; to wit, that thou wouldeſt not reade two or three leaues of this Booke, and ſo caſt it from thee: but that thou wouldeſt reade it throughout euen to the end. For I do aſſure thee, if there be any thing in it worth the reading, it is beſtowed in the latter part thereof, and moſt of all towards the concluſion. Be not diſcouraged therefore at the harſhneſſe of the beginning: but looke for ſmoother matter in the middeſt, and moſt ſmooth in the percloſe and wind-vp of all. For this Dialogue hath in it, not the nature of a Tragedy, which is begunne with ioy, and ended with ſorrow: but of a Comedie, which is begun with ſorrow, and ended with ioy. This booke medleth not at all with any controuerfies in the Church, or any thing in the ſtate Eccleſiaſticall,

but onely entreth into a controuerſie with Sathan and ſinne. It is contriued into ſix principall heads. Firſt, it ſheweth mans miſery in nature, with the meanes of recouery. Secondly, it ſharpely inueigheth againſt the iniquity of the time, and common corruptions of the world. Thirdly, it ſheweth the markes of the children of God, and of the Reprobates; together with the apparant ſignes of ſaluation and damnation. Fourthly, it declareth how hard a thing it is to enter into life: and how few ſhall enter. Fiftly, it laieth open the ignorance of the world, with the obiections of the ſame. Laſt of all, it publiſheth and proclaimeth the ſweet promiſes of the Goſpell, with the abundant mercy of God, to all that repent, beleeue, and truely turne vnto him. The Authour of all bleſſing giue a bleſſing vnto it. The God of peace, which brought againe from the dead our Lord Ieſus, the great ſheepeheard of the ſheepe, through the blood of the euerlaſting couenant, make vs perfect in all good workes, ſanctifie vs throughout, amend all our imperfections, and keepe vs blameleſſe vntill the day of his moſt glorious appearing, Amen.

               Interlocutors:
               
                  Theologus, a Diuine.
               
                  Philagathus, an honeſt man.
               
                  Aſunetus, an ignorant man.
               
                  Antilegon, a cauiller.
            
            
               Philagathus.
               
                  WEll met, good Maſter Theologus.
               
            
            
               Theol.
               What mine old friend, Philagathus! I am glad to ſee you in good health.
            
            
               Phila.
               Are you walking, Sir, heere all alone in this pleaſant meadow?
            
            
               Theol.
               Yea: for I take ſome pleaſure at this time of the yeere to walke abroad in the fieldes for my recreation, both to take the freſh aire, and to heare the ſwéet ſinging of birds.
            
            
               Phila.
               Indeed, Sir, it is very comfortable, eſpecially now in this pleaſant moneth of

May: and thanks be to God, hitherto we haue had a very forward ſpring, and as kindly a ſeaſon as came this ſeuen yeeres.
            
            
               Theo.
               God doth abound towards vs in mercies: oh that we could abound towards him in thankſgiuing.
            
            
               Phil.
               I pray you ſir, what a clocke hold you it?
            
            
               Theol.
               I take it to be a little paſt one: for I came but euen now from dinner.
            
            
               Phila.
               But behold, yonder commeth two men towards vs: What be they I pray you?
            
            
               Theolog.
               They be a couple of neighbours of the next Pariſh: the one of them is called Aſunetus, who in very déed is a very ignorant man in Gods matters: and the other is called Antilegon, a notable Atheiſt, and cauiller againſt all goodneſſe.
            
            
               Phila.
               If they be ſuch, it were good for vs to take ſome occaſion to ſpeake of matters of religion; it may be we ſhall doe them ſome good.
            
            
               Theol.
               You haue made a good motion: I like it well. If therefore you will miniſter ſome matter, and mooue ſome queſtions, I will bée readie to anſwer in the beſt ſort I can.
            
            
               Phi.
               But ſtay ſir, lo heere they come vpon vs.
            
            
               Theol.
               Welcome neighbours, welcome. How do you Aſunetus, and you Antilegon?
               
            
            
               Aſune.
               Well, God be thanked; and we are glad to ſee your maſterſhip in good health.
            
            
               
               Theol.
               What make both of you héere at this time of the day? There is ſome occaſion I am ſure draweth you this way.
            
            
               Aſune.
               Indeed ſir, we haue ſome little buſines; for we came to talke with one of your pariſh, about a Cow we ſhould buy of him.
            
            
               Theol.
               Hath my neighbour a Cow to ſell?
            
            
               Antilegon.
               We are told he hath a very good one to ſell; but I am afrayd at this time of the yeare, we ſhall finde deare ware of her.
            
            
               Theol.
               How deare? What doe you thinke a very good Cow may be worth?
            
            
               Antile.
               A good Cow indeed, at this time of the yere, is worth very nere foure pound, which is a great price.
            
            
               Theol.
               It is a very great price indéed.
            
            
               Phila.
               I pray you M. Theologus, leaue off this talking of kine, and worldly matters; and let vs enter into ſome ſpeech of matters of religion, whereby we may doe good, and take good one of another.
            
            
               Theol.
               You ſay well: but it may be theſe mens buſineſſe requireth haſte, ſo as they can not ſtay.
            
            
               Aſune.
               No ſir, we are in no great haſte, we can ſtay two or three houres, for the dayes are long; if we diſpatch our buſineſſe by night it will ſerue our turne well enough.
            
            
               Theol.
               Then if it will pleaſe you to walke

to yonder Oke trée, there is a goodly Arbour, and handſome ſeats, where wée may all ſit in the ſhadow, and conferre of heauenly matters.
            
            
               Aſune.
               With a good will Sir.
            
            
               Phila.
               Come then let vs goe.
            
            
               Aſune.
               This is a goodly Arbour indeed, and heere be handſome ſeats.
            
            
               Theol.
               Sit you all downe, I pray you. Now friend Philagathus, if you haue any queſtions to moue of matters of Religion, we are all readie to heare you.
            
            
               Phila.
               It may be theſe men are ſomewhat ignorant of the very principles of Religion; and therefore I thinke it not amiſſe to begin there, and ſo to make way for further metters.
            
            
               Theol.
               I pray you do ſo then.
            
            
               Phila.
               Firſt, then I demand of you, in what ſtate all men are borne by nature?
            
            
               Theol.
               In the ſtate of condemnation, as appeareth, Ephe. 2. 3. We are by nature the children of wrath as well as others. And againe it is written: Behold I was borne in iniquitie,Pſal. 52. 5. and in ſin hath my mother conceiued me.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               Is it euery mans caſe? Are not Dukes and Nobles, Lords and Ladies, and the great Potentates of the earth exempted from it?
            
            
               Theol.
               No ſurely, it is the common caſe of all, both high and low, rich and poore, as it

is written: What is man that hee ſhould beeIob 15. 14▪
                      cleane, and he that is borne of a woman, that he ſhould be iuſt?
               
            
            
               Philaga.
               From whence commeth it, that all men are borne in ſo wofull a caſe?
            
            
               Theol.
               From the fall of Adam, who thereby hath not onely wrapt himſelfe, but all his poſterity, in extreame and vnſpeakeable miſery; as the Apoſtle ſaith: By one mans diſobedience, many were made ſinners: and by the offence of one, the fault came on all men to condemnation.
               
            
            
               Phi.
               What reaſon is there that we all ſhould thus be puniſhed for an other mans offence?
            
            
               Theol.
               Becauſe we were then all in him, and are now all of him: that is, we are ſo deſcended out of his loynes, that of him we haue not only receiued our naturall and corrupt bodies, but alſo by propagation haue inherited his foule corruptions, as it were by hereditary right.
            
            
               Phila.
               But foraſmuch as ſome haue dreamed that Adam by his fall hurt himſelfe only, and not his poſterity; and that we haue his corruption deriued vnto vs by imitation, and not by propagation: therefore I pray you ſhew this more plainely.
            
            
               Theol.
               Euen as great perſonages, by committing of treaſon, doe not onely hurt themſelues,

but alſo ſtaine their blood, and diſgrace their poſteritie: for the children of ſuch Nobles are diſinherited, whoſe blood is attainted; till they be reſtored againe by act of Parliament. Euen ſo our blood being attainted by Adams tranſgreſſion, we can inherit nothing of right, till wee be reſtored by Chriſt.
            
            
               Philaga.
               Doeth this hereditarie infection, and contagion, ouer-ſpread our whole nature?
            
            
               Theol.
               Yes truely, it is vniuerſall, extendingEpheſ. 2. 1. Col. 1. 21. Col. 2. 13. it ſelfe thorowout the whole man, both ſoule, and body, both reaſon, vnderſtanding, will and affections: for the Scriptures auouch, that wée are dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes.
            
            
               Phila.
               How vnderſtand you that?
            
            
               Theol.
               Not of the deadneſſe of the bodie, or the naturall faculties of the ſoule, but of the ſpirituall faculties.
            
            
               Phila.
               Did Adam then loſe his nature and deſtroy it by his fall? or is our nature taken away by his fall?
            
            
               Theol.
               Not ſo. Our nature was corrupted thereby, but not deſtroyed: for ſtill there remaineth in our nature, reaſon, vnderſtanding, will, and affections, and we are not as a block, or a ſtocke; but by Adams diſobedience wee are blemiſhed, maimed, and ſpoyled of all abilitie to vnderſtand aright, or to will and doe

aright. As it is written: Wee are not ſufficient of our ſelues, to thinke any thing as of our2. Cor. 3. 5. ſelues: but our ſufficiencie is of God. And againe: It is God which worketh in you bothPhil. 2. 13. the will and the deed; euen of his good pleaſure. And as concerning the other point, S. Iames ſaith: That all men are made after theIam. 3. 9. ſimilitude of God; meaning therby that there remaine ſome reliques and parts of Gods Image, euen in the moſt wicked men: as reaſon, vnderſtanding, &c. ſo that our nature was not wholly deſtroyed.
            
            
               Phila.
               Then you thinke there be ſome ſparks and remnants left in vs ſtill of that excellent Image of God, which was in our firſt creation.
            
            
               Theol.
               I thinke ſo indéed: and it may plainly appeare vnto vs in the wiſe ſpéeches and writings of Heathen Poets and Philoſophers: in all which wée may, as by certaine ruines, perceiue what was the excellent frame and building of mans creation.

               Can a man pleaſe God in any thing which he doth, ſo long as he continueth in the ſtate of nature?
            
            
               Theol.
               No, not in any thing: for till wée be in the ſtate of grace, euen our beſt actions are ſinfull: as preaching, prayer, almes déeds, &c. As it is written: Who can bring a cleane thing
                  Iob 14. 4.
                  
                  out of that which is vncleane. Iob.
                   14. 4. The Apoſtle alſo ſaith: They which are in the fleſhRom. 8. 8 cannot pleaſe God: that is, ſuch as are ſtill in their naturall corruption. And our Lord Jeſus himſelfe ſaith: Doe men gather Grapes ofMat. 7. 16. thornes, or Figges of thiſtles? Meaning thereby, that méere naturall men can bring foorth no fruites acceptable to God.

               This is a very harſh and hard ſaying; I pray you for my further inſtruction, make it more plaine.
            
            
               Theol.
               Men in the ſtate of nature may doe thoſe things which of themſelues are good, but they doe vtterly faile in the manner of doing them: they do them not as they ſhould be done: that is, in faith, loue, zeale, conſcience of obedience, &c. neither yet with any chéerefulneſſe, delight or feeling, but euen as it were, forcing themſelues to doe the outward actions. Thus did Cain ſacrifice; the Phariſies pray; Ananias and Sapphira giue almes; and the Jewes offer vp their oblations and burnt offerings.
            
            
               Phila.
               Haue men any true ſight, or liuely and ſound feeling of this miſery and wofull eſtate, ſo long as they be meerely naturall?
            
            
               Theol.
               No ſurely, but are altogether blinded and hardened in it, being nothing deſirous to come out of it, but doe greatly pleaſe themſelues in it, and can hardly bée perſwaded that

they are in any ſuch wofull caſe; as appeareth plainely in the example of that ruler, who being commanded or rather required of our Sauiour Chriſt to kéep the commandements, anſwered: All theſe haue I kept from my youth. And againe,Luke. 18. 21. although the Church of Laodicea was wretched, miſerable, poore, blind, and naked; yet ſhe thought her ſelfe rich, encreaſed with goods, and wanting nothing. It followeth then, that ſo long as men are in the ſtate of nature, they haue no true ſight and féeling of their miſery.
            
            
               Phila.
               Do you not thinke that all men being meerely naturall, are vnder the curſe of the Law?
            
            
               Theol.
               Yea certainly: and not only ſo, but alſo vnder the very tyranny and dominion of Satan, though they know it not, ſee it not, féele it not, or perceiue it not: for all that are not in Chriſt, are vnder the curſe of the law, and the power of darkneſſe and the diuel, as appeareth, Epheſ. 2. 2. where the diuell is called the prince that ruleth in the aire, euen the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience. In another2. Cor. 4. 4. 2. Tim. 2. 26. place, he is called the god of this world, who blindeth the eies of all vnbeléeuers. And againe, it is ſaid; that all men naturally are in his ſnare being taken captiue of him at his wil.
            
            
               Phila.
               Few will be perſwaded of that; they

will ſay, they defie the diuell, and thanke God they were neuer troubled with him.
            
            
               Theol.
               Their hot words do nothing amend the matter: for the diuell is no more driuen away with words, then with holy water; but he ſitteth in the tongues and mouthes: nay poſſeſſeth the very hearts and intrals of thouſands which ſay they defie him, and are not troubled with him, as appeareth manifeſtly by their particular acttions, and the whole courſe of their life.
            
            
               Phila.
               Me thinkes, if the diuell do ſo inwardly poſſeſle the hearts and conſciences of men, they ſhould haue ſome ſight and feeling of it.
            
            
               Theol.
               The working of the Diuell in mens ſoules (being an inuiſible ſpirit) is with ſuch vnconceiuable ſleight and crafty conueiance, that men in the eſtate of nature cannot poſſibly féele it, or perceiue it: for how can a blind man ſée, or a dead man féele?
            
            
               Phila.
               Shew this more plainely.
            
            
               Theol.
               Euen as a crafty Juggler doth ſo preſtigiate and blinde mens outward ſenſes by the deluſions of Sathan, that they thinke they ſée that which they ſée not, and féele that which they féele not: Euen ſo the diuell doth ſo delude and bewitch our inward ſenſes, & the naturall faculties of our ſoules, that we hauing a miſt caſt before our eies, thinke we are that which

wée are not, ſée that which wée ſée not, and féele that which wée féele not. For the déepe cunning of Sathan lieth in this; that hée can giue vs our deaths wound, and wée ſhall neuer know who hurt vs.
            
            
               Phila.
               Few will beleeue this to be true.
            
            
               Theol.
               True indéed: for few will beléeue the Scriptures: few will beléeue this, becauſe few féele it: where it is not felt, it can hardly be beléeued: only the elect do féele it, and therefore only the elect do beléeue it. As for all others, they are the very prentiſes and bond-ſlaues of the diuell, which is a thouſand times worſe then to be a galley-ſlaue.
            
            
               Phil.
               How long do men continue in this wofull ſtate of nature, being vnder the curſe of the law, and the very ſlauery of Sathan and ſinne?
            
            
               Theol.
               Till they be regenerate and borne againe, and ſo brought into the ſtate of grace: as our Lord Jeſus ſaith: Except a man be borneIohn 3 3. againe, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               Do not many die and depart this life, before they be borne againe, and conſequently before they be brought into the ſtate of grace?
            
            
               Theol.
               Yes no doubt, thouſands: for many liue fortie or thréeſcore yeares in this world, and in the end die, and goe out of this life, before they knowe wherefore they came into it: as it is written: My people periſh for want
                  
                  of knowledge.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               What may we thinke of ſuch?
            
            
               Theol.
               I quake to ſpeake what I thinke: for ſurely I doe not ſée how ſuch can be ſaued. I ſpeake not now of infants and children, whereof ſome no doubt are ſaued by vertue of the promiſe & couenant, through the election of grace.
            
            
               Phil.
               It ſeemeth then that you thinke none can be ſaued, but thoſe only which are borne againe.
            
            
               Theol.
               I thinke ſo indéed.
            
            
               Phil.
               I pray you tell me what that ſame regeneration and new birth is, whereof you ſpeake.
            
            
               Theol.
               It is a renewing and repairing of the corrupted and decayed eſtate of our ſoules. AsRom. 12. 2. Epheſ. 4. 13. it is written: Be ye changed by the renewing of your minde. And againe: Be renewed in the ſpirit of your minde.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               Explaine this more fully.
            
            
               Theol.
               Euen as the wild Oliue retaineth his old nature, till it be grafted into the ſwéet Oliue, but afterward is partaker of a new nature: ſo we til we be grafted into Chriſt, retain our old nature, but afterward are turned into a new nature, as it is written: If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature.
                  2. Cor. 5. 17.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               I vnderſtand not what you ſay.
            
            
               Theol.
               You muſt know this, that as there is a naturall birth of the whole man; ſo there

is alſo a ſpirituall birth of the whole man.
            
            
               Phila.
               How is that?
            
            
               Theol.
               When as the naturall faculties of the ſoule, as reaſon, vnderſtanding, will and affections, and the members of the body alſo, are ſo ſanctified, purged and rectified by grace, that we vnderſtand, wil, and deſire that which is good.
            
            
               Phila.
               Can not a man will and deſire that which is good, before he be borne againe?
            
            
               Theol.
               No more then a dead man can deſire the good things of this life. For mans will is not frée to conſent vnto good, till it be enlarged by grace: and an vnregenerate man doth ſinne neceſſarilie, though not by conſtraint. For mans will is frée from conſtraint (for it ſinneth of it ſelfe) but not from thraſdome vnto ſin.
            
            
               Phila.
               You ſpeake, as if a man could do no other thing but ſinne, till the new worke be wrought in him.
            
            
               Theol.
               That is mine opinion indéed: for a man & his fleſh are all one, til he be regenerate; they agrée together like man & wife, they ioine together in all euill, they liue and die together: for when the fleſh periſheth, the man periſheth.
            
            
               Phila.
               Is not this regeneration a changing or rather a deſtroying of humane nature?
            
            
               Theol.
               Nothing leſſe: It is neither an aboliſhing, nor changing of the ſubſtance of bodie or ſoule, or any of the faculties thereof: but

only a rectifying and repairing of them by remoouing the corruption.
            
            
               Phila.
               Is then our naturall corruption ſo purged and quite remoued by the power of grace, as that it remaineth not at all in vs, but that we are wholly freed of it?
            
            
               Theol.
               Not ſo. For the reliques and remnants of our old nature, which the Scripture calleth the old man, doe hang about vs, and dwell in vs, euen vntill our dying day: as it is plainly prooued in the ten laſt verſes of the ſeuenth to the Romanes.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               Then you affirme that this new man or new worke of grace and regeneration, is vnperfect in this life.
            
            
               Theol.
               Yea. For the new creature, or new worke of grace, can neuer be fullie faſhioned in this life: but is alwayes in faſhioning. And as our faith and knowledge in this life are vnperfect: ſo is our regeneration, and ſanctification.
            
            
               Phila.
               You ſaid before that the regeneration or new birth is of the whole man; which ſpeech ſeemeth to imply, that the new worke of grace is entire and perfect.
            
            
               Theol.
               You miſtake the matter. For although the new birth is vniuerſall, and of the whole man, yet it is not entire, perfect, pure and without mixture of corruption. For it is written: The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the
                  Gal. 5. 17.
                  
                  ſpirit againſt the fleſh. The Apoſtle alſo prayeth, that the Theſſalonians may be ſanctified thorowout, in ſpirit, ſoule, and bodie.
            
            
               Phila.
               This ſeemeth very obſcure, I pray you make it more plaine.
            
            
               Theol.
               You muſt note this, that the new worke and the old, fleſh and ſpirit, grace and corruption, are ſo intermingledly ioyned together in all the faculties of the ſoule and body, as that the one doth euer fight againſt the other.
            
            
               Phila.
               But tell me, I pray you, how you vnderſtand this intermingling of grace and corruption in the ſoule? Do you mean that grace is placed in one part of the ſoule, and corruption in another, ſo as they be ſundred in place?
            
            
               Theol.
               No, that is not my meaning: but this, that they be ioyned and mingled together (as I ſaid) in and thorowout the whole man. For the minde, or vnderſtanding part, is not one part fleſh, and another part ſpirit: but the whole minde is fleſh, and the whole minde is ſpirit, partly one, and partly another. The ſame is to be ſaid of the will and affection.
            
            
               Phila.
               I pray you expreſſe it more plainly.
            
            
               Theol.
               Euen as the ayre in the dawning of the day, is not wholly light, or whollie darke, as at midnight, or at noone day; neither is it in one part light, in another part darke: but the whole aire is partly light, and partly darke

thorowout: and as in a veſſell of luke-warme water, the water it ſelfe is not only hot, nor only colde, but heat and colde are mixed together in euery part of the water: ſo is the fleſh and the ſpirit mingled together in the ſoule of man. And this is the cauſe why theſe two contrarie qualities fight together.
            
            
               Phila.
               Out of doubt this doctrine of regeneration is a very great myſterie.
            
            
               Theol.
               Yes certainly: it is a ſecret of ſecrets, which the wiſe of this world cannot cōprehend.
            
            
               Phila.
               Some thinke that courteſie, kindneſſe, good nurture, good nature, and good education, are regeneration, and that courteous and good natured men muſt needs be ſaued.
            
            
               Theol.
               They are greatly deceiued; for theſe things doe not neceſſarily accompanie ſaluation, but are to be found in ſuch as are altogether prophane and irreligious: yet wée are to loue ſuch good outward qualities, and the men in whom wée finde them.
            
            
               Phila.
               What ſay you then to learning, wit, and policie; are not theſe things of the eſſence of religion, and prooue a regeneration?
            
            
               Theol.
               No, no: for they be externall gifts, which may be in the moſt wicked men, as in Papiſts, Heathen Poets, and Philoſophers: yet wée are greatly to reuerence learned and wiſe men, although the new and inward

worke be not as yet wrought: for that is onely of God, that is from aboue.
            
            
               Phila.
               The common people doe attribute much to learning and policy: for they will ſay, ſuch a man is learned and wiſe, and knoweth the Scripture as well as any of them all, and yet he doth not thus and thus.
            
            
               Theol.
               It is one thing to know the Hiſtory and Letter of the Scriptures, and another thing to beléeue and féele the power thereof in the heart, which is onely from the ſanctifying ſpirit, which none of the wiſe of this world can haue.
            
            
               Phila.
               It is a common opinion, that if a man hold the truth in iudgement, be no Papiſt, or heretike, but leadeth an honeſt ciuill life, then he muſt of neceſſity be ſaued.
            
            
               Theol.
               That followeth not: for many come ſo far, which yet notwithſtanding haue not the inward touch.
            
            
               Phila.
               That ſeemeth ſtrange. For many will ſay, As long as they be neither whore nor theefe, nor ſpotted with ſuch like groſſe ſinnes, they truſt in God they ſhall be ſaued.
            
            
               Theol.
               They erre not knowing the ſcriptures. For many thouſands are in great danger of loſing their ſoules for euer, which are frée from ſuch notorious and horrible vices may many which in the world are counted good honeſt

men, good true dealers, good neighbors, and good Towneſ-men.
            
            
               Aſune.
               I pray you Sir, giue me leaue a little. I haue heard all your ſpeech hitherto, and I like reaſonably well of it: but now I can forbeare no longer, my conſcience vrgeth me to ſpeake. For me thinkes you goe too far, you goe beyond your learning in this, that you condemne good neighbours, and good towneſmen. You ſay, many ſuch men are in danger of loſing their ſoules: but I will neuer beleeue it while I liue. For if ſuch men be not ſaued, I cannot tell who ſhall.
            
            
               Theol.
               But you muſt learne to know out of the Scriptures that all outward honeſty and righteouſnes, without the true knowledge and inward féeling of God, auaileth not to eternall life. As our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith: Except yourMath. 5. righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye cannot enter into the Kingdome of heauen. It is alſo written thatActs 17. 12. when Paul preacht at Berea, many honeſt men and honeſt women did beléeue: that is, ſuch as were outwardly honeſt, or honeſt to the world only; for they could not be truly and inwardly honeſt, before they did beléeue. Therefore you ſée that this outward honeſty & ciuility, without the inward regeneration of the ſpirit, auaileth not to eternall life; and then conſequently,

all your honeſt worldly men are in great danger of loſing their ſoules for euer.
            
            
               Aſune.
               What ſound reaſon can you yeeld, why ſuch honeſt men ſhould be condemned?

               Becauſe many ſuch are vtterly void of all true knowledge of God, and of his word. Nay which is more: many of them deſpiſe the word of God, and hate all the zealous profeſſors of it. They eſtéeme preachers but as pratlers; and Sermons as good tales; they eſtéeme a Preacher, no more than a ſhoomaker: they regard the Scriptures, no more then their old ſhooes. What hope is there then, I pray you, that ſuch men ſhould be ſaued? Doth not the holy Ghoſt ſay: How ſhall wee eſcape if weeHeb. 2. 3. neglect ſo great ſaluation?

               Theol.
               Not a whit. For all experience ſheweth, that they minde, dreame, and dote of nothing elſe day and night, but this world, this world, lands and leaſes, grounds and liuings, kine, and ſhéepe, and how to way rich. All their thoughts, words, and works, are of theſe and ſuch like things. All their actions doe moſt manifeſtly declare, that they are of the earth, and ſpeake of the earth: and that there is nothing in thē, but earth, earth. As for ſermons, they care not how few they heare. And for the ſcriptures

they regard them not, they read them not, they eſtéeme them not worth the while: there is nothing more irkeſome vnto them; they had rather pill ſtrawes, or do any thing, then heare, read, or conferre of the Scriptures. And as the Prophet ſaith; The word of the Lord is as a reprochIer. 6. 10. vnto them, that haue no delight in it.

               I maruell much, that ſuch men ſhould liue ſo honeſtly to the world-ward.
            
            
               Theol.
               No maruell at all; for many bad men whoſe hearts are worm-eaten within, yet for ſome outward and carnall reſpects, doe abſtaine from the groſſe act of ſinne; as ſome for credit, ſome for ſhame, ſome for feare of Law, ſome for feare of puniſhment; but none for loue of God, for zeale, or conſcience of obedience. For it is a ſure thing, that the wicked may haue that ſpirit which doth repreſſe; but not that which doth renew.

               It ſeemeth then by your ſpeeches, that ſome which are not regenerate, do in ſome things excell the children of God.

               Moſt certaine it is, that ſome of them in outward gifts, and the outward cariage of themſelues, doe goe beyond ſome of the elect.

               Shew me I pray you in what giftes.

               Theol.
               Yes truely. For ſome of Gods deare children, in whom no doubt the inward worke is truly and ſoundly wrought; yet are ſo troubled & encombred with a crabbed and crooked nature, and ſo clogged with ſome maſter ſin; as ſome with anger, ſome with pride, ſome with couetouſneſſe, ſome with luſts, ſome one way, and ſome another: all which breaking out in them, doe ſo blemiſh them and their profeſſion, that they cannot ſo ſhine forth vnto men, as otherwiſe no doubt they would; and this is their wound, their griefe, and their hart-ſmart, and that which coſteth them many a téere, and many a praier: and yet can they not get the full victorie ouer them, but ſtill they are left in them, as the pricke in the fleſh to humble them.
            
            
               Phila.
               Yet loue ſhould couer a multitude of ſuch infirmities in Gods children.
            
            
               Theol.
               It ſhould doe ſo indeed: but there is great want of loue, euen in the beſt: and the worſer ſort eſpying theſe infirmities in the godlie, run vpon them with open mouth and take vpon them to condemne them vtterly, and to iudge their hearts, ſaying; they be hypocrites, diſſemblers, and there is none worſe then they.
            
            
               Phila.
               But doe you not thinke that there be ſome counterfeits, euen amongſt the greateſt profeſſors?
            
            
               
               Theol.
               Yes, no doubt, there be, and alwaies haue béen ſome very hypocrites in the Church: but we muſt take héed of iudging and condemning all, for ſome. For it were very much to condemne Chriſt and his eleuen Diſciples, becauſe of one Iudas; or the whole Primitiue Church, for Ananias and Sapphira.

               But I hope you are of this minde, that ſome regenerate men euen in outward gifts, and their outward cariage, are comparable with any others.
            
            
               Theol.
               Queſtionleſſe, very many. For they being guided by Gods ſpirit, and vpheld by his grace, do walke very vprightly and vnblameably towards men.
            
            
               Phil.
               Yet there reſteth one ſcruple: for it ſeemeth verie ſtrange vnto me, that men of ſo diſcreet cariage as you ſpeake of, and of ſo many good parts, ſhould not be ſaued. It is great pitie ſuch men ſhould be damned.
            
            
               Theol.
               It ſéemeth ſo vnto vs indéed: but God is onely wiſe, and you muſt note, that as there be ſome infirmities in Gods children, which he correcteth with temporall chaſtiſements; and yet rewardeth their faith, loue, and inward ſeruice and obedience, with eternall life: ſo there be ſome good things in the wicked, and them that are without Chriſt, which God rewardeth with temporall bleſſings; and yet

puniſheth them eternally for their vnbeléefe and hardneſſe of heart.

               Now you haue reaſonably well ſatisfied me touching the doctrine of regeneration, and the manifold errours and deceits that are in it, and of it. I pray you let vs now proceed: and firſt of all tell me, by what meanes the new birth is wrought.
            
            
               Theol.
               By the preaching of the word, as the1. Pet. 1. 23. Ioh. 15. 3. Act. 10. 44. Epheſ. 4. 3. outward meanes; and the ſecret worke of the ſpirit, as the inward meanes.
            
            
               Phila.
               Many heare the word preached, and are nothing the better, but rather the worſe: what I pray you is the cauſe of that?
            
            
               Theol.
               Mens owne incredulity, and hardneſſe of heart: becauſe God in his wrath leaueth them to themſelues and depriueth them of his ſpirit, without the which, all preaching is in vaine. For except the ſpirit doe follow theAct. 16. 14. word into our hearts, we can find no ioy, taſte, nor comfort therein.
            
            
               Phila.
               Cannot a man attaine vnto regeneration and the new birth without the word and the ſpirit?
            
            
               Theol.
               No verily: for they are the inſtruments & meanes, whereby God doth worke it.
            
            
               Aſune.
               Why may not a man haue as good a faith to God-ward, that heareth no Sermons, as he that heareth all the Sermons in the world?
            
            
               
               Theol.
               Why may not he, which eateth no meat, be as fat and as well liking, as he that eateth all the meat in the world? For is not the preaching of the word, the food of our ſoules?
            
            
               Aſune.
               I like not ſo much hearing of Sermons, and reading of the Scriptures, except men could keepe them better.
            
            
               Theol.
               Faithfull and honeſt hearers doe therefore heare, that they may be more able to obſerue and do. For a man cannot do the will of God before he know it: and he cannot know it without hearing and reading.
            
            
               Antile.
               I maruell what good men doe get by gadding to Sermons, and poring ſo much in the ſcriptures; or what are they better then others? there are none more full of enuy, and malice then they. They will doe their neighbour a ſhrewd turne as ſoone as any body; and therefore in mine opinion, they be but a company of hypocrites, and preciſe fooles.
            
            
               Theol.
               You iudge vncharitably. Full little doe you know what they feele, or what good Gods people get by hearing of his word. For the worke of the Spirit in the hearts of the elect is very ſecret, and altogether hid from the world, as it is written: The winde blowethIohn. 3. 8. where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whither it goeth, or whence it commeth; So is euery man that is
                  
                  borne of the ſpirit. And againe: The things of God knoweth no man, but the ſpirit of God.
               
            
            
               Aſune.
               Tuſh, tuſh; what needs all this a doe? If a man ſay his Lords praier, his Ten Commandements, and his Beliefe, and keepe them, and ſay no body no harme, nor doe no body no harme, and doe as he would be done to, haue a good faith to God-ward, and be a man of Gods beliefe, no doubt he ſhall be ſaued, without all this running to Sermons, and pratling of the Scripture.
            
            
               Theol.
               Now you powre it out indéede. you thinke you haue ſpoken wiſely. But alas, you haue bewraied your great ignorance. For you imagine, a man may be ſaued, without the word: which is a groſſe errour.
            
            
               Aſune.
               It is no matter: ſay you what you will, and all the Preachers in the world beſides: as long as Iſerue God, and ſay my praiers duly, and truely, morning and euening, and haue a good faith in God, and put my whole truſt in him, and doe my true intent, and haue a good minde to God-ward, and a good meaning; although I am not learned, yet I hope it will ſerue the turne for my ſoules health. For that God, which made me, muſt ſaue me: It is not you that can ſaue me, for all your learning, and all your Scriptures.
            
            
               Theol.
               You may very fitly be compared to a

ſicke man, who hauing his braine diſtempered with heat, raueth, and ſpeaketh idlely, he cannot tell what. For the holy Ghoſt ſaith: HePro. 28. 9. that turneth away his eare from hearing the law, euen his praier ſhall be abhominable. And againe: he that deſpiſeth the word, he ſhall be deſtroied.
                  Pro. 13: 13 So long therefore as you deſpiſe Gods word, and turne away your eare from hearing his Goſpel preached, all your prayers, your fantaſticall ſoruing God, your good meanings, and your good intents, are to no purpoſe; but moſt loathſome and odious in the ſight of God: as it is written: My ſoule hateth your new moones, and your appointed feaſtes, they are a burthen vnto me, I am weary to beare them. When you ſtretch out your hands, I will hideEſa. 1. 14. mine eies from you: and though you make many praiers, I will not heare. For your hands are full of bloud. And againe the Lord ſaith by the ſame Prophet: He that killeth a bullocke, is as if he ſlew a man: hee that ſacrificeth aIſa. 66. 3. ſheepe, as if he cut off a dogs necke: he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered ſwines blood: he that remembreth incenſe, as if he bleſſed an idol. Where you ſée, the Lord telleth you his minde touching theſe matters: to wit, that all your praiers, ſeruices, good meanings, &c. are abhominable vnto him, ſo long as you walk in ignorance, prophanenes, diſobedience, and contempt

of the Goſpel. For he ſaith in the words immediately going before: To him wil I looke, euen to him that is poore and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my words.

               I grant indeed for them that are idle and haue little to do, it is not amiſle now and then to heare a Sermon, and read the Scriptures: but we haue no leaſure, we muſt follow our buſineſſe, we cannot liue by the ſcriptures: they are not for plaine folke, they are too high for vs, we will not meddle with them. They belong to Preachers and Miniſters.

                  CHRIST ſaith: My ſheepe heare myIohn 10. voice, and I giue vnto them eternal life. If therfore you refuſe to heare the voice of Chriſt, you are none of his ſheepe, neither can you haue eternall life. And in another place, our Lord Ieſus ſaith: He that is of God, heareth Gods word.Ioh. 8. 47. Ye therefore heare it not, becauſe ye are not of God. S. Paul writing to all ſorts of men, both rich and poore, high & low, men & women, yong and old, exhorteth, that the word of Chriſt may dwell plenteouſly in them all, in all wiſedome.
                  Col. 3. 16. You ſée therefore that the Apoſtle would haue al ſorts of people, that haue ſoules to ſaue, to be wel acquainted with the ſcriptures. Therefore you may as well ſay, you will not meddle with God, with Chriſt, nor with euerlaſting life, as to ſay, you wil not meddle with the ſcriptures.
            
            
               
               Aſune.
               Well, I cannot reade, and therefore I cannot tell, what Chriſt, or what S. Paul may ſay: but this I am ſure of, that God is a good man (worſhipped might he be) he is mercifull, and that wee muſt be ſaued by our good prayers, and good ſeruing of God.

               You ſpeake fooliſhly and ignorantly in al that you ſay: hauing no ground for any thing you ſpeake but your own fanſie, and your own conceit: and yet you will beléeue your own fanſie againſt all Preachers, & againſt all that can be ſpoken out of the Word. But I praie you giue me leaue a little. If a man dreame that he ſhall be a king, and in the morning when he is awake perſwadeth himſelfe it ſhall be ſo, may hée not be iuſtly laughed at, as hauing no ground for it? euen ſo may all they which beleeue their owne dreams and phantaſies touching ſaluation: But it is true which Salomon ſaith: A foole beleeueth euery thing: thatPro. 14. 15. copper is gold, and a counter an angel. And aſſuredly great reaſon there is, that he which will not beléeue God, ſhould be giuen ouer to beleeue the diuell, his dreame, and his fanſie.

               You had néed indéed to be better inſtructed: for the diuell hath ſlily deluded your ſoule, and caſt a miſt before your eies, making you beléeue the Crow is white, and that your

               This it is that deceiueth you, and many others: that you meaſure your ſelues by your ſelues and by others: which is a falſe metwand. For you ſéeme to lie ſtraight, ſo long as you are meaſured by your ſelues, and by others: but lay the rule of Gods word vnto you, and then you lie altogether crooked.

               An other thing that deceiueth you, is your owne heart: for you know not your owne heart, but are altogether deceiued therein. ForIer. 17. 9. the heart is deceiueable aboue all things. He is a wiſe man and greatly enlightned that knoweth his owne heart. But you are blind, and know not what is within you: but dimly imagin you ſhal be ſaued, and hope you know not what of eternal life. And becauſe blindnes maketh you bold, you wil ſéeme to be reſolute in words, and ſay: it is pitty he ſhould liue, which doth any whit doubt of his ſaluation. And aſſuredly you ſpeake as you think, & as you know. For ought that you know to the contrary, it ſéemeth ſo: though indéed, and in truth, it is not

ſo: for you are deluded with a falſe light. And ſometimes, no doubt, you haue pricks, gripes, terrors, and inward accuſations of conſcience, for all your bold and reſolute ſpéeches.

               No doubt, if a man be infected with theſe, they be ſhrewd ſignes that a man is extreamly ſoule-ſick, and in a very dangerous caſe. But are there not yet more euident and apparant ſignes of condemnation then theſe?

               They may not vnfitly be termed the nine Beelzebubs of the world: and he that hath theſe ſignes vpon him, is in a moſt wofull caſe.

               What if a man be infected with ſome two or three of theſe?
            
            
               Theol.
               Whoſoeuer is infected with thrée of them, is in great danger of loſing his ſoule. For all theſe be deadly venome, and ranke poiſon to the ſoule: and either the thrée firſt, or the thrée laſt, or the middle thrée, are enough to poiſon the ſoule, and ſting it to death. Nay, to ſay the truth, a man were as good gripe a toad, and handle a ſnake, as meddle with any one of theſe.
            
            
               Phila.

               Theol.
               Queſtionleſſe. For they be the very Plague-ſores of the ſoule. If any man haue a Plague-ſore vpon his body, we vſe to ſay Gods tokens are vpon him, Lord haue mercy on him. So we may truly ſay, if any man be thorowly and totally infected at the heart with any one of theſe, Gods tokens are vpon his ſoule, Lord haue mercy on him.
            
            
               Phila.
               Many do not thinke theſe to be ſuch dangerous matters as you make them, & many

there be which make light of them.
            
            
               Theol.
               True indéed: For the moſt part of men are altogether ſhut vp in blindneſſe, and hardneſſe of heart, hauing neither ſight nor féeling of their ſinnes; and therefore make light of them, thinking there is no ſuch danger.
            
            
               Phila.
               It is moſt certaine, that men are giuen to leſſen and extenuate their ſins; or elſe, to hide them, and dawbe them ouer with many cunning ſhifts, and vaine excuſes. For men are euer readie to take couert, and will writhe and wreath (like ſnakes) to hide their ſins: yea, if it were poſſible, to make ſinne no ſinne, to make vertue vice, and vice vertue. Therefore I pray you lay open vnto me out of the ſcriptures, the grieuouſneſſe, and vglineſſe of their ſinnes.
            
            
               Theol.
               The ſtinking filthines of theſe ſins is ſo great and horrible, that no tongue or pen of man is ſufficient fully to manifeſt and lay open the ſame, according to the proper nature and being thereof: yet notwithſtanding, I wil do my indeuour to lay them open in ſome meaſure, that all men may the more loath them.
            
            
               Phila.
               I pray you then, firſt of all beginne with Pride.

               You ſay well: For that indéed may well ſtand in the fore-front, ſith it is a maſterdiuell, and the maſter pocke of the ſoule.

               Shew mee out of the Scriptures, that

pride is ſo grieuous and loathſome.
            
            
               Theol.
               
                  SALOMON ſaith: Euery one that isPro. 16. 5. proud in heart, is abhomination to the Lord. Which plainely ſheweth, that God doth deteſt and abhorre proud men. And is it not a fearfull thing, think you, to be abhorred of God? And in the ſame Chapter, verſ. 18. he ſaith: Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an high mind before the fall. Wherein he ſheweth that pride is the forerunner of ſome deadly down-fall, either by diſgracing or diſplacing. For it is an old and true Prouerbe: Pride will haue a fall. And oftentimes when men are moſt lifted vp, then are they néereſt vnto it: as the examples of Haman, Nabuchadnezzar, and Herod, do plainely declare. When the Milt ſwelleth, the reſt of the body pineth away: Euen ſo, when the heart is puft vp with pride, the whole man is in danger of deſtruction. Moreouer the holy ghoſt ſaith: The Lord will deſtroy the houſe of the proud.Pro. 15. 24 Iob 11. 5 & 15. Iob 20. 26. Iob ſaith of ſuch kinde of men: The ſparke of his fire ſhall not ſhine: feare ſhall dwell in his houſe, and Brimſtone ſhall be ſcattered vpon his habitation. And in another place, he ſaith; The fire, which is not blown, ſhal deuoure him.
                  Iob 23. 13 Me thinketh therefore if there were any ſparke of grace in vs, theſe terrible ſpéeches of the holy ghoſt might ſerue to humble vs, and pull downe our pride; eſpecially ſith the Scriptures doe affirme

that God reſiſteth the proud, and ſetteth himſelfe, exprofeſſo, againſt them; & therfore wo vnto them: for if God take againſt a man, who can reclaim him? for he doth whatſoeuer he wil.

               But tell me, I pray you, when you ſpeake againſt pride, what pride it is that you meane?
            
            
               Theol.
               I meane all pride, both that which is inward in the heart, & that alſo which breaketh out in mēs forheads; I mean that which apparantly ſheweth it ſelf in mens words & works.
            
            
               Phila.
               Do you mean alſo pride of mens gifts?
            
            
               Theo.
               Yes ſurely; for there is no pride worſe or more dangerous then that. Beware, ſaith one, of ſpiritual pride; as to be proud of our lerning, wit, knowledge, reading, writings, ſermons, praiers, godlines, policy, valor, ſtrength, riches, honor, birth, beauty, authority. For God hath not giuen ſuch gifts vnto men, to the end they ſhould make ſale-ware of them, and ſet them a ſunſhining, to behold; ſeking only themſelues with their gifts, the vaine praiſe of the multitude, and applauſe of the people: ſo robbing God of his honor, and proudly arrogating to themſelues, that which is due vnto God; which is the praiſe of his gifts. But he hath giuen his gifts to an other end: namely, that we ſhould vſe them to his glory, and the good of others (either in church or common-wealth) eſpecially of thoſe which doe moſt concerne vs.
            
            
               
               Phila.
               Yet we ſee commonly, men of greateſt gifts are moſt proud.
            
            
               Theol.
               True indéed: For the fineſt cloth is ſooneſt ſtained. And as wormes ingender ſooner in ſoft and tender wood, than in that which is more hard and knotty: and as moths do bréed ſooner in fine wool, then in courſe flocks: Euen ſo pride, and vaine-glory, doe ſooner aſſault an excellent and rare man in all kinde of knowledge & vertue, then an other of meaner gifts. And therefore pride is ſaid to ſpring out of the aſhes of all vertues. For men will be proud, becauſe they are wiſe, learned, godly, patient, humble, &c. Pride therefore may very fitly be compared to the crab-ſtock ſpeins, which grow out of the root of the very beſt apple-trée. Therefore to ſay the truth, this is one of the laſt engines and weapons, which the diuell vſeth for the ouerthrowing of Gods owne children: euen to blow them vp with pride, as it were with gunpowder. For as we ſée it come to paſſe in the ſiedge of ſtrong holdes, when no battery or force of ſhot will preuaile, the laſt remedy and policy is to vndermine it, and blow it vp with traines of gun-powder: ſo when Sathan can no way preuaile, againſt ſome excellent ſeruants of God, his laſt deuice is, to blow them vp with pride, as it were with gunpowder.
            
            
               Phila.
               I ſee it is a ſpeciall grace of God,

for men of great gifts, to be humble minded; & he is an old man of a thouſand, which excelling in gifts, doth excel in humility; & the more gifts he hath, the more humbly he walketh: not contemning others; but eſteeming them better then himſelfe. For commonly we are the woorſe for Gods gifts; becauſe we haue not the right vſe of them; and againe, becauſe they ingender ſo much proud fleſh in vs, that we had need daily to be corzied. Therefore God ſheweth great fauour & mercy to that man, whom he humbleth and taketh downe by any afflictions, or infirmities whatſoeuer. For otherwiſe, it is ſure, proud fleſh would altogether ouergrow vs.
            
            
               Theol.
               You haue ſpoken the truth: for the Apoſtle2. Cor. 11. himſelfe confeſſeth, that he was tempted and troubled this way, & had like to haue béene puffed vp out of meaſure, with the abundance of his reuelations; but that God, in great mercy, ſent him a cooler, and a rebater; to wit, a pricke in the fleſh (which he calleth the meſſenger of ſathan) whereby the Lord cured him of his pride. And euen ſo doth he cure many of vs, of our pride, by throwing vs to ſathan, leauing vs to our ſelues, and giuing vs ouer, to commit ſome groſſe euill, euen to fal downe and breake our neckes; and all, to the end he may humble vs, tame vs, and pull down our pride, which he ſéeth we are heart-ſicke of. It is good for vs

therefore to be humble in the abundance of graces, that we be not proud of that which we haue, or that which we haue done. For humility in ſinne, is better then pride in well doing.
            
            
               Phila.
               Heerein ſurely appeareth the great wiſdome and mercy of God: that he ſo gratiouſly wringeth good out of euill, and turneth our afflictious, infirmities, fals and downe-fals, to his glory, and our good.
            
            
               Theo.
               It is moſt true. For euen as of the fleſh of a Uiper, is made a ſoueraigne medicine, to cure thoſe which are ſtung of a Uiper; and as Phyſitians expell poiſon with poiſon; ſo God, according to his maruellous wiſdome, doth of the infirmities which remaine in vs after regeneration cure other more dangerous diſeaſes; as pride, vaine-glory, and preſumption. Oh, bleſſed therefore be his name for euer, which thus mercifully cauſeth all things to worke together for the good of his owne people; of whom theſe things are ſpecially to be vnderſtood!
            
            
               Phila.
               Is there no cauſe, why men of great gifts ſhould glory in their gifts?
            
            
               Theo.
               No ſurely, none at all. For the Apoſtle ſaith; Who ſeparateth thee? And what haſt1 Cor. 4. thou, that thou haſt not receiued? If thou haſt receiued it, why boaſteſt thou, as though thou haddeſt not receiued it? Where the Apoſtle plainely ſheweth, that no man is to be proud

of his gifts; becauſe they are none of his own: he hath but receiued them to vſe. We count him worthy to be laughed at as a foole, who hauing borrowed braue apparell of others (as a ſilke gown, a ſatten doublet, a chaine of gold, veluet bréeches, &c.) ſhould proudly iet in the ſtréets in them, as if they were his owne: Euen ſo they are worthy to be Chronicled for fooles, which are proud of good gifts, which are none of their own. Therefore the Prophet Ieremy ſaith: Thus ſayth the Lord; Let not the wiſeIer. 9. 23. man glory in his wiſedome, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, neither the rich man in his riches: but let him that glorieth glorie in this, that he vnderſtandeth and knoweth me. To this point alſo wel ſaith the Heathen Poet: No manTheocritus. can eſcape the puniſhment of pride; therefore in greateſt proſperitie be not puſſed vp.
               
            
            
               Phil.
               Yet it is a world to ſee, how proud, ſurly, haughty, ſtately, inſolent, and thraſonicall ſome be, becauſe of their gifts: they thinke they touch the clouds with their heads, and that the earth doth not bear them; they take themſelues to be petty Angels, or ſome wonderful wights. They contemne and diſdame all others which haue not the like gifts. They do contemptuouſly ouerlooke them, as a lion ſhould ouerlooke a mouſe, a king a begger; or, as wee ſay in a prouerbe, As the diuel ouer-looked Lincolne.
            
            
               
               Theol.
               Oh proud duſt! Oh haughty worms meat! If they would bring their hearts before God, and their conſciences, thoughts, and affections to be iudged by this Law, it would ſoone coole them, and take them downe well enough: they ſhould ſée their wants and imperfections to be ſo great, that they indéed ſhould haue no more cauſe to boaſt of their gifts, then the black-more hath of his whiteneſſe, becauſe his téeth are white. The holy Ghoſt cuts al our combes, and pulleth downe all pride of fleſh, when he ſaith: How ſmall a thing doth manMat. 16. 14. vnderſtand of God!
               
            
            
               Phila.
               I pray you, let vs proceed to ſpeake of the outward and groſſe pride of the World: and firſt of all, tell me what you thinke of pride in apparrell.
            
            
               Theol.
               I thinke it to be a vanitie of all vanities, and a folly of all follies. For to be proud of apparrell, is, as if a théefe ſhould be proud of his halter, a begger of his clouts, a child of his gay, or a foole of his bable.
            
            
               Phila.
               Yet wee ſee how proud many (eſpecially women) be of ſuch bables. For when they haue ſpent a good part of the day in tricking and trimming, pricking and pinning, pranking and pouncing, girding and lacing, and brauing vp themſelues in moſt exquiſite manner, then out they come into the ſtreetes,

with their Pedlers ſhop vpon their backe, and cary their creſts very high, taking themſelues to be little Angels: or at leaſt ſomewhat more then other women. Whereupon they doe ſo exceedingly ſwell with pride, that it is to be feared they will burſt with it, as they walke in the ſtreetes. And truely we may thinke, the very ſtones in the ſtreet, & the beames in the houſes doe quake, and wonder at their monſtrous, intolerable, and exceſſiue pride. For it ſeemeth, that they are altogether a lumpe of pride, a maſſe of pride, euen altogether made of pride, and nothing elſe but pride, pride.
            
            
               The.
               You ſéeme to be very hot in the matter.
            
            
               Aſune.
               Marry, Sir, I like him the better: for the world was neuer ſo full of pride as it is now adayes.
            
            
               Theol.
               Alas, alas: indéed, who can hold his peace, at the pride of this age! What a thing is it, that fleſh and blood, wormes-meat, duſt and aſhes, durt and dung, ſhould ſo braue it out with their trim clouts, and that in the ſight of God, angels, and men? For the time wil come, when both they, and al their gay clouts ſhal be buried in a graue: yea, as Iob ſaith, The graueIob. 17. 14. ſhall be their houſe, and they ſhall make their bed in the darke. And then ſhall they ſay to corruption; Thou art my Father: and to the worme: Thou art my Mother and my ſiſter.
                  
What then ſhal it auaile thē, thus to haue ruffled it out in all their brauery, when as ſuddenly they ſhal go downe to deſtruction? What did it profit the rich man, to be ſumptuouſly cloathed, & fare deliciouſly euery day, when his body was buried in the duſt & his ſoule in hel fire?
            
            
               Aſune.
               I pray you, Sir, what ſay you to theſe great ruffes, which are borne vp with ſupporters, and rebatoes, as it were with poſt and raile?
            
            
               Theol.
               What ſhould I ſay? but God be mercifull vnto vs. For ſuch things do draw downe the wrath & vengeance of God vpon vs al: & as the Apoſtle ſaith: For ſuch things ſake, the wrathCol. 3. 6. of God cōmeth vpon the children of diſobedience. And truly, truly, we may wel feare that God wil plague vs for our abhominable pride.
            
            
               Aſune.
               What ſay you then to theſe doubled and redoubled ruffes, which are now in common vſe, ſtrouting fardingales, long locks, foretufts, ſhag-haire and al theſe new faſhions which are deuiſed and taken vp euery day?
            
            
               Theol.
               I ſay, they are farre from that plainneſſe, ſimplicitie, and modeſty, which hath béen in former ages, our fore-fathers knew no ſuch things. It is recorded of William Rufus, ſometimeGraftons Chron. King of this Land, that when his Chamberlaine on a time brought him a new paire of hoſe, he demaunded of him what they coſt: who

anſwered, thrée ſhillings. Whereat the King being ſomewhat mooued, commaunded him to prepare him a paire of a marke. If Kings were then thought to excéed, that beſtowed a Marke vpon a paire of hoſe, what is it to be thought of many meane men in theſe our daies, (yea ſuch as haue no liuing, and are ſearſe of any good calling) which beſtow as much vpon one paire, as the King did vpon two, when he was thought moſt of all to excéed? But alas, alas, we haue paſſed all bounds of modeſty and meaſure: there is no hoe with vs. Our land is too heauy of this ſinne. For the pride of all Nations, and the follies of all Countries are vpon vs; how ſhall we beare them? And as for theſe new faſhions, the more new they be, the more fooliſh and ridiculous are they. For with our new faſhions, we are growen cleane out of faſhion. If we had as many faſhions of our bodies, as we haue of our attire, we ſhould haue as many faſhions as fingers and toes. But vaine men and women, doe apparently ſhew their vaine minds, by following ſo greedily ſuch vain toies and faſhions.
            
            
               Aſune.
               It was neuer good world, ſince ſtarching and ſteeling, buskes, and whale-bones, ſupporters, and rebatoes, full moones, and hobby-horſes, painting and dying, with ſelling of fauour and complexion, came to be in vſe. For

ſince theſe came in, couetouſneſſe, oppreſſion and deceit haue increaſed. For how elſe ſhould pride be mainteined? And ſure it is, within theſe thirty yeeres, theſe things were not knowen, nor heard of. And what ſay you then to painting of faces, laying open of naked breaſts, dying of haire, wearing of periwigs, and other haire coronets and top-gallants? And what ſay you to our artificiall women, which will be better then God hath made them? They like not his handy worke, they will mend it, and haue other complexion, other faces, other haire, other bones, other breaſts, and other bellies, then God made them.
            
            
               Theol.
               This I ſay: that you and I, and all the Lords people, haue great and iuſt cauſe of mourning, wéeping, and lamentation, becauſe ſuch abhomination is committed in Iſrael. Dauids
                  Pſ. 11. 9. eies guſhed out with riuers of téeres, becauſe men kept not Gods lawes: and an horrible feare came vpon him, becauſe men forſookeIere. 9. 1. the law of God. Ieremy did ſigh in ſecret, wiſhing that his head were ful of water, & his eies a fountaine of téeres, becauſe of the ſins of theNeh. 13. people. Nehemiah mourned for the tranſgreſſiō of Gods people. Lots iuſt ſoule was vexed with the vncleane conuerſation of the Sodomites: & ſhall we mourn nothing at all for theſe things? ſhall we be no whit grieued for the pride of our

land? ſhall we ſhed no téeres for ſuch horrible & intolerable abhomination? They are odious in the ſight of God and men: the aire ſtinketh of them. It is Gods maruellous patience, that the diuel doth not carry them away quicke, and rid the earth of them: or that fire & brimſtone doth not come downe from heauen & conſume them.

               You are too hot in theſe matters of attire: you make more of them, then there is cauſe.
            
            
               Aſune.
               I conne him thanke; Gods bleſſing on his heart; I ſhall loue him the better, while I know him: becauſe he is ſo earneſt againſt ſuch ſhamefull and deteſtable pride. Is it not a ſhame, that women, profeſſing true Religion, ſhould make themſelues ſuch pictures, puppets, and peacockes, as they doe? And yet I heare few preachers in the pulpit ſpeake againſt it.
            
            
               Antil.
               I maruell you ſhould be ſo earneſt in matters of apparell. You know well enough, that apparell is an indifferent thing: and that Religion, and the kingdome of God doth not conſiſt in theſe things.
            
            
               Theol.
               I know right well, that apparell in it owne nature is a thing indifferent: but lewd, wanton, immodeſt, and offenſiue apparell is not indifferent. For all ſuch abuſe taketh away the indifferency of them, and maketh them ſinfull and euill, by circumſtance. For otherwiſe, why ſhould the Lord threaten by his Prophet,

that he would viſit the Princes, and the Kings children and all ſuch as were clothed with ſtrange apparell, that is, the faſhions of other countries: Zeph. chap. 1. 8. Againe; why ſhould the Lord ſo plague the proud dames, and minſing minions of Ieruſalem, for their pride and vanity in attire, if there were no euill in ſuch kinde of abuſe? the Lord ſaith thus, in the third of Eſay, againſt thoſe braue & gallant dames; Becauſe the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walke with ſtretched-out neckes and with wandring eies, walking and minſing as they go, and make a tinkling with their feet: therefore ſhall the Lord make the heads of the daughters of Zion bald, and the Lord ſhall diſcouer their ſecret parts. In that day ſhall the Lord take away the ornament of the ſlippers, and the calles, and the round tires, the ſweet bals, and the bracelets, and the bonnets, the tiers of the head, and the ſtops, the head-bands, and the tablets, the earrings, the rings, and the mufflers, the coſtly apparell, and the vailes, and the wimples, and the criſping pinnes, and the glaſſes, and the fine linnen, and the hoods, and the lawnes. And in ſtead of ſweete ſauour, there ſhall be ſtinke; and in ſtead of a girdle, a rent: and in ſtead of dreſſing of the haire, baldneſſe: and in ſtead of a Stomacher, a girding of Sacke-cloth, and burning in ſteade of beautie. Then
                  
                  ſhall her gates mourne and lament: and ſhee being deſolate, ſhall ſit vpon the ground.
               
               Thus we ſée how terrible the Lord threatneth the gallant dames of Ieruſalem for their exceſſiue and abhominable pride. And this may wel be a Mirrour for the proud minions of our age, which aſſuredly may well feare, the Lord will bring ſome ſuch iudgement vpon them, as hée did vpon the daughters of Ieruſalem. For their ſin is as great in this kinde, as was the daughters of Zion: and God is the ſame God now that he was then, to puniſh it.
            
            
               Antile.
               Tuſh: neuer ſpeake ſo much of theſe matters of apparell. For we muſt doe as others doe, and follow the faſhion: or elſe wee ſhall not be eſteemed.
            
            
               Theol.
               If you follow them not, you ſhall be more eſtéemed of God, of his Angels, Saints, and all good men. As for all others, if you eſtéeme them more then theſe, you ſhew what you are.
            
            
               Antil.
               Well, for all that, ſay you what you will, pride is in the heart, and not in the apparell. For one may be proud of plaine apparell, as well as of coſtly. And ſome are as proud of their falling bands, and little ſets, as others are of their great ruffes.
            
            
               Theol.
               You ſpeake fooliſhly. For how know you that? can you iudge mens hearts & inward

affections? Can you ſay, when mens and womens apparell is ſober, modeſt and Chriſtian-like, that they haue proud hearts, & are proud of that attire? You goe very farre indéed, to iudge the heart. You ought to iudge charitably of ſuch as goe ſoberly and modeſtly attired: euen that their heart is according to their attire. As for you, we may rather thinke your heart is vaine, light, and fooliſh: becauſe your attire doth ſtrongly argue it: And as the Prophet ſaith: The triall of your countenance teſtifiethEſay 3. 9. againſt you: you declare your ſinnes as SODOME, and hide them not.
               
            
            
               Antile.
               I pray you then ſet downe ſome rules for apparell out of the Scripture.
            
            
               Theol.
               I may well ſet downe what I will: but ſurely moſt men and women will do what they liſt. For verily it may be thought that many of this age haue forſworn God, & his word, & al goodneſſe. For they are come to this point, let God ſay what he will, they will do what they liſt. For as the Prophet ſaith; They haue made a couenant with Hell, and with death, and are growen to an agreement: Eſay
                   28. 15. And I doe verily thinke, if God himſelfe ſhould come downe from Heauen in his owne perſon, and diſſwade men and women from this vanitie of apparell, yet would they ſtill vſe it, as it were in deſpite of God, and as it were to anger him

the more. For they are ſo extraordinarily enamoured, and ſo immoderately delighted with it, and do ſo continually, and altogether dote on it, and are ſo wood mad of it, that they will haue it, though men and angels, and all the world ſay nay: nay, which is more, though they ſhould go to the diuel quicke with it. And therfore it is but loſt labour to ſpeake againſt it, preach againſt it, or write againſt it. It is but euen to plough the ſea, or knocke at a deafe mans doore: for there is no hope of any reformation. Onely this we gaine, that the world is reprooued and conuicted of ſinne: and theſe things ſhall ſtand in record againſt them, in the laſt day: ſo that they may ſay, they had a faire warning, and that there was a Prophet amongſt them.
            
            
               Philaga.
               Yet for all this I pray you ſet vs downe ſome directions and rules, out of Gods holy booke, concerning attire. For albeit ſome bee very bad and outragious in theſe things, yet there be ſome others which are well diſpoſed, and will (no doubt) make ſome conſcience to frame themſelues according to the rules of Gods word.
            
            
               Theol.
               Well then, for their ſakes which are well diſpoſed, I will ſet downe ſome few directions. Saint Paul in 1. Tim. 2. 9. willeth that women ſhould array themſelues in comely apparell, with ſhame faſtneſſe and modeſty, as tecommeth

women that profeſſe the feare of God: and not with broydered haire, or gold, or pearles or coſtly apparell. The Apoſtle Saint Peter giueth like rules alſo: for he ſaith, ſpeaking1. Pet. 3. 3. of Chriſtian matrones, and profeſſors of holy Religion, that their apparell muſt not be outward, that is, not conſiſt ſo much in outward brauery (as broydered haire, gold put about, &c.) as it muſt be inward; that the hid man of the hart may be clothed with a meeke & quiet ſpirit: which is a thing before God much ſet by. For after this manner, ſaith he, in times paſt, the holy women, which truſted in God, did attire themſelues: as Sara, Rebecca, Rachel; and ſuch like ancient and graue matrones.
            
            
               Phila.
               Wherein doth this inward cloathing ſpecially conſiſt?
            
            
               Theol.
               In foure things, which are ſet downe in the forenamed places: to wit, ſhamefaſtnes, modeſty, a quiet ſpirit, and a méeke ſpirit.
            
            
               Phila.
               Theſe be fine ſuites of apparell, indeed. I would all women would put them on, and neuer put them off, but weare them continually. For they are the better for wearing, though all other apparell be the worſe.
            
            
               Theol.
               If women would decke themſelues inwardly with theſe foreſayd vertues, they would be vnto them as ornaments of gold, and iewels of pearle. For the woman that feareth
                  Pro. 30. 1.
                  
                  the Lorde ſhall be praiſed.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               But nowe I pray you ſir, ſet downe your iudgement for outward attire.
            
            
               Theol.
               This is all that I can ſay, touching that point, that it muſt be as the Apoſtle ſaith; Comely, decent, handſome, neat and ſéemely; not light, nor wanton, not laſciuious, not immodeſt, not offenſiue.
            
            
               Phila.
               But who ſhall iudge what is comely, ſober, handſome modeſt, &c: For euery man and woman will ſay, their apparell is but decent and cleanly, how gallant, braue, and flaunting ſo euer they be.
            
            
               Theol.
               Herein the examples of the moſt godly, wiſe, graue, and modeſt men and women are to be followed: for who can better iudge what is comely, ſober and modeſt, then they?
            
            
               Phila.
               But we ſee ſome; euen of the better ſort, in this matter are a little infected, run out, and goe beyond their bounds.
            
            
               Theol.
               The more is the pity. But alas, we ſée the ſway of the time and the rage of the ſtreame is ſo violent, that it carrieth before it whatſoeuer is not ſetled, and very déepe rooted. And ſome godly and wel diſpoſed perſons, whoſe hearts are not with theſe things but with God, are notwithſtanding perforce earied away with the violence of the wind, and tide: whoſe caſe, though it cannot well be defended, or excuſed;

yet it is much to be pitied and lamented.
            
            
               Phil.
               Haue you any further directions, touching this point▪
               
            
            
               Theol.
               There is one thing yet more to be added: to wit, that attire be according to mens places, callings and degrées. For that is not ſéemely for one, that is ſéemely for another: that becomes not one mans place, that becommeth anothers: For that is not méet for poore men, which is méet for rich men: nor that méet for meane men, which is méet for men of note and great place.
            
            
               Phila.
               Then you thinke it lawfull for kings, princes, and great perſonages, to weare peerle, golde, ſiluer, veluet, &c.
            
            
               Theol.
               Queſtionleſſe, it is lawfull for ſuch in ſober manner and eaſure, to weare the moſt coſtly and precious things which the earth can affoord: and that, to ſet out the magnificence, pompe, and glory of their places. And therefore ſuch things are in them moſt comely and decent.
            
            
               Phils.
               But now adaies, few will keepe within compaſſe, few will know their places: but the moſt part run beyond their bounds, and leape quite out of their ſockets.
            
            
               Theol.
               True indéed. For now adaies, meane gentlewomen, yea ſome gentlewomen of their owne making, will ruffle it, and braue it out, in their attire, like Counteſſes and Ladies of

honour. Plaine folke alſo, in the Countrey, will flaunt it like Courtiers, and like good gentlemen, and gentlewomen: and they ſée me to ſay in their hearts, Fie of this plainneſſe, wée will no more of it, wée will not take it as wée haue done. So that now the old prouorbe is verified: Euery Iacke will be a gentleman, and Ione is as good as my Lady. For now we cannot, by their apparell, diſcerne the maide, from the Miſtres: nor the waiting gentlewoman, from her Lady. And thus we ſée, in this matter of apparell, how all is out of ioynt.

               Is there any more to be ſaid, in this eaſe?

               There is yet another thing to be reſpected, in this matter of attire.

               What is that?
            
            
               Theol.
               That it be according to mens abilities. For it is lamentable to conſider, how poore men and women, poore hyred ſeruants, milkemaides, and ſuch like, goe quite beyond their abilitie. And more lamentable, to ſée what wretched▪ and ill-fauoured ſhifts they make, to compaſſe theſe things: ſo ſharpe and ſo eagerly, are they ſet vpon them.

                  Salomon in his Prouerbs, ſaith: ThatPro 22. 14 the mouth of a ſtrange woman, or an harlot, is as a deepe pit: he, that is a dereſtation to the Lord, ſhall fall therein. Wherein he plainly ſheweth, that thoſe whom God deteſteth, and is excéeding angry with, are giuen ouer to this vice. And, in another place, he ſaith: An whorePro. 23. 17 is as a deepe dit oh, and as a narrow pit. Noting thereby, that if a man be once fallen in with an harlot, he ſhall as hardly get out againe, as a man that is plunged into a very déepe & narrow pit, where he can ſcant ſtir himſelfe. The ſame Salomon, in the booke of Eccleſiaſtes, yeeldethEccl. 7. 28. vs the reaſon héerof: namely, becauſe ſhée is as nets, ſnares & bands: wherein if a man be once taken he is faſt enough for getting out.

               You haue very well ſhewed, out of Gods booke, the great danger of whoredome and adultery. And it is greatly to be lamented, that men in this age, make ſo light of it as they doe, and that it is ſo common a vice: nay, that ſome (alas, with griefe I ſpeake it) doe profeſſe it, liue by it, and proſtitute themſelues wholly vnto it.

               Yet for all this, you ſhall not make me beleeue, that whoredome is ſo hainous a mattter. You make more of it then it is.
            
            
               Theol.
               True indéed. For you, and ſuch as you are, will beléeue nothing againſt your luſts, and fleſhly delights: and that is the cauſe why you are deafe on this eare. I will therfore adde a word or two more (out of the oracles of God) to that which hath vin ſpoken. The wiſe king ſaith: He that committeth Adulterie withPro. 6. 32. women, deſtroieth his owne ſoule: and ſo is acceſſarie to his owne death, which is no ſmall matter. For wée vſe to ſay, if a man hang himſelfe, drowne himſelfe, or any manner of way make away himſelfe: that he was curſed

of God, that Gods hand was heauie againſt him, that the diuell ought him a ſhame, and now he hath paid it him. And all the countrey rings of ſuch a ſtrange accident, when, and where it falleth out: and the Crowner of the Countrey doth ſit vpon it. How much more may all the world wonder at this, that a man ſhould deſtroy his owne ſoule, and wittingly and willingly caſt away himſelfe for euer! Now the holy Ghoſt ſaith: the Adulterer doth ſuch an act, giueth ſuch a venture, and willingly murthereth himſelfe. Oh, therefore woe vnto him, that euer he was borne. For ſure it is that great Crowner of heauen, that crownes whom hée will crowne, ſhal one day ſit vpon it, and giue iudgement. Moreouer, as the Adulterer ſinneth againſt his ſoule: ſo alſo he ſinneth againſt his bodie after a ſpeciall manner, as witneſſeth the1. Cor. 6. 18. Apoſtle. Alſo he ſinneth againſt his goods and outward eſtate: as the holy man Iob teſtifieth, ſaying: Adulterie is a fire, that deuoureth toIob 31. 12. deſtruction, and it will roote out all our encreaſe. Furthermore he ſinneth againſt his name. For the Adulterer ſhall finde a woundPro. 6. 33. and diſhonour: and his reproch ſhall neuer be put away.
               
               
                  Item, he ſinneth againſt his wife: who is his companion and the wife of his couenant. And God ſaith, in the ſame place: Let none
                  
                  treſpaſſe againſt the wife of his youth: keepe your ſelues in your ſpirit, and tranſgreſſe not. Laſt of all he ſinneth againſt his children and poſteritie: as the Lord ſaid to Dauid: Becauſe2. Sam. 12. 10. thou haſt deſpiſed me, and done this, therefore the ſword ſhall neuer depart from thy houſe. Beholde I will raiſe vp euill againſt thee, out of thine owne houſe. Now therefore, to conclude this point, we may ſée how many deadly wounds men make in themſelues, by committing of adultery. They wound themſelues in their ſoules. They wound themſelues in their bodies. They wound themſelues in their goods. They wound themſelues in their names. They wound themſelues in their wiues, and in their children. What man, except he were ſtark mad, would thruſt in himſelfe, in ſo many places, at once? The adulterer, with his owne ſin of adulterie, maketh all theſe deadly wounds in himſelfe. And it is a hundred to one he will neuer get them cured, but will die, and bléed to death of them. Lo, thus you ſée the dangerous quality and condition of this ſin. Shall we now therfore make light of it? Shall we ſay it is but a tricke of youth? Shal we ſmooth ouer the matter with ſwéet words, when the holy Ghoſt maketh it ſo hainous and capitall? Shal we make nothing of that, which draweth downe Gods wrath vpon the ſoule, body, goods, name, wife and children?

That were an intolerable blindneſſe, and moſt extreame hardneſſe of heart. An ancient writer hath long agoe paſſed ſentence vpon vs, who make ſo light of this ſin: for, (ſaith he) AdulteryBaſil in Epiſt. Gregor. is the very hooke of the diuell; whereby he draweth vs to deſtruction. And another godly Father ſaith: that Adulterie is like a furnace, whoſe mouth is gluttonie, the flame pride, the ſparkles filthy words, the ſmoke an euill name, the aſhes pouertie, and the end ſhame. And ſo wée plainly ſée, that howſoeuer wée regard not this ſinne, but flatter our ſelues in it, yet thoſe, whoſe eies the Lord hath opened, haue in all ages condemned it as moſt flagitious and horrible: yea the very Heathen will riſe vp in iudgment againſt vs; who haue ſpoken and written many things againſt this filthy & beaſtly vice.
            
            
               Phila.
               Now indeede you haue ſufficiently branded the vice of adulterie; and laid out the vglineſſe thereof, that all men may behold it ſtarke naked and abhorre it. If any man (notwithſtanding all this) will venture vpon it, hee may be ſaide to be a moſt deſperate monſter. For what doth he elſe, but (as it were) put his finger into the Lions mouth, and (as it were) take the beare by the tooth? and they may well know what will follow, and what they may looke for. Let all men therefore in time take heed to themſelues, and to their owne ſoules,

as they will anſwer it at their vttermoſt perill, at the dreadfull day of iudgement, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhalbe diſcloſed. But now one thing reſteth; to wit, that you ſhould ſhew vs the ſpeciall roots and cauſes of adulterie.
            
            
               Theol.
               There be fiue ſpeciall cauſes of it. The firſt is our naturall corruption: for the verie ſpawne and ſéed of all ſinne is in our corrupt nature: and this, of all other, is a moſt inherent ſinne, as witneſſeth the Apoſtle Iames, ſaying: When luſt hath conceiued, it bringethIam. 1. 15. foorth ſinne; and ſinne, when it is perfected, bringeth forth death.
               
               The ſecond is gluttonie and fulneſſe of Bread: for when men haue filled their bellies, and crammed their paunches, as full of good cheare, wine, and ſtrong drinke, as their ſkins can hold, what are they méet for, or what mind they elſe, but adulterie and vncleanneſſe? And therfore well ſaith one: Great nouriſhment, and groſſe feed, it is the ſhop of luſt. The HeathenEſt officina Terence. Poet could ſkill to ſay, Sine, Cicere & Baccho friget Venus. Without meat and drinke, luſt waxeth colde.
                   And to this effect the wiſe king ſaith, that their eies ſhall behold ſtrange women,Pro. 23. verſ. 3. & verſ. 33. whoſe hearts are ſet vpon wine and bellycheare. And therefore he aduiſeth all men, not to looke vpon the wine when it appeareth red, when it ſheweth his colour in the cup, or

ſtirreth very kindely: and that for feare of this after-clap. An ancient writer ſaith to the ſam purpoſe: Hee that delicately pampereth hisGregorius Nazianz. belly, and yet would ouercome the ſpirit of fornication, is like him that will quench a flame of fire with Oyle.
               
               Therefore, to cloſe vp this point, ſure it is, though men pray, heare, and read much, and be otherwiſe well diſpoſed: yet except they be abſteinous in diet, they will be much troubled with luſt.
               The third cauſe of adulterie, is Idleneſſe: For when men are lazie, luſkiſh, and idle, hauing nothing to do, they lie wide open to adulterie; and luſt créepeth into them. Some Hiſtoriographers write, the Crab-fiſh is very deſirous to eat Oyſters: but becauſe ſhe cannot perforee open them, ſhe watcheth her time when they open themſelues vnto the ſun after the tide, and then ſhe putteth in her claw, and pulleth out the Oyſter. Euen ſo ſathan watcheth his opportunity againſt vs, that he may infect and breath into vs all filthy luſts, and adulterous deſires, when wée lie open vnto him by idleneſſe. Wiſely therfore to this point ſaid the Gréeke Poet: Much reſt nouriſheth luſt. AndHeſiodus. another Poet ſaith: Quaritur agiſtus quare ſit factus adulter? In promtu cauſa eſt: deſidioſus erat.
               
               Slothfull lazineſſe is the cauſe of Adulterie,

And therefore another ſaith: Eſchew idleneſſe,Otia ſi tollas, periere cupidinis ar cus. and cut the ſinewes of luſt.
               
               The fourth cauſe of adultery, is wanton apparell: which is a miniſtrelſie, that pipes vp a daunce vnto whoredome. But of this enough before.
               The fift and laſt part of adultery, is the hope of impunitie, or eſcaping of puniſhment. For many being blinded and hardened by Sathan, thinke they ſhall neuer be called to an account for it: And becauſe they can bleare the eies of men, and carry this ſin ſo cloſely vnder a cloud, that it ſhall neuer come to light, they thinke all is ſafe, and that God ſéeth them not. And therefore Iob ſaith: The eie of the adulterer waitethIob 24. 15. for the twi-light, and ſaith; None eie ſhall ſee me. And in another place; How ſhall GodIob 23. 13▪
                      know? can he iudge thorow the darke cloud? But verily, verily, though the adulterer doe neuer ſo cloſely and cunningly conuey his ſin vnder a canopie, yet the time will come when it ſhall be diſcloſed, to his eternall ſhame. ForEccl. 12. 24. God will bring euery worke to iudgement, with euery ſecret thought; whether it be good or euill. For he hath ſet our moſt ſecret ſins in thePſal. 91. 8. light of his countenance. And hee will lighten1. Cor. 4. 5. the things that are hid in darkneſſe, and make the counſels of the heart manifeſt. For this cauſe Iob ſaith; When I ſinne, thou watcheſt
                  Iob 10.
                  
                  me, and wilt not purge me from my ſinne.

               Well ſir; now you haue waded deepe enough in the ſecond ſigne of damnation, I pray you let vs proceed to the third, which is couetouſneſſe. And as you haue laid naked the two former, ſo I pray you, ſtrip this ſtarke naked alſo, that all men may ſee what an vgly monſter it is, and therefore hate it, and abhorre it.
            
            
               Theol.
               I would willingly ſatiſfie your mind: but in this point I ſhall neuer do it ſufficiently. For no heart can conceiue, or tongue ſufficiently vtter the loathſomneſſe of this vice. For, Couetouſneſſe is the fouleſt fiend, & blackeſt diuell of all the reſt. It is euen great Beelzebub himſelfe. Therefore I ſhall neuer be able fully to deſcribe it vnto you: but yet I will do what I can

to ſtrip it, and whip it ſtarke naked. And howſoeuer that men of this earth, and blind worldlings, take it to be moſt ſwéet, beautifull and amiable, and therefore do embrace it, entertaine it, and welcome it, as though there were ſome happineſſe in it; yet I hope, when I haue ſhewed them the face thereof in a glaſſe (euen the true glaſſe of Gods word) they will be no more in ſuch loue, but quite out of conceit with it. I will therefore hold out this glaſſe to them.
               Saint Paul to Timothy brandeth this ſinne in the forehead, and boareth it in the eares, that all men may know it, and auoid it; when hée ſaith: Couetouſneſſe is the root of all euill.
                  1. Tim. 6. 10. Luke 12. 15. Our Lord Ieſus alſo giueth vs a watch-word to take héed of it▪ ſaying: Take heed, and beware of couetouſneſſe. As if he ſhould ſay; touch it not, come not neare it, it is the very breath of the diuell: it is preſent death and the very ratſbane of the ſoule. The Apoſtle laieth out the great danger of this ſinne, and doth excéedingly grime the face of it, when he ſaith: that the end of all ſuch as minde earthly things, is damnation.

               Theol.
               There be foure ſpeciall ſignes of the hearts infection.
            
            
               Phil.
               Which be they?
            
            
               Theo.
               The firſt is an eager and ſharp ſet deſire of getting. Therefore the holy Ghoſt ſaith:Pro. 28. Pro. 20. 21. 
                  He that haſteth to be rich, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed. And againe: An heritage is haſtily gotten at the beginning; but the end thereof ſhall not be bleſſed. The Heathen man alſo ſaith: NoDemoſthenesin Olinth 3. man can be both iuſtly, and haſtily rich.
               
               The ſecond is a pinching and niggardly kéeping of our owne, that is, when men (being able to giue) will hardly part with any thing, though it be to neuer ſo holy and good vſe. And when at laſt with much adoe, for ſhame they giue ſomthing, it commeth heauily from them (God wot) and ſcantly.
               The third is, the neglect of holy duties: that is, when mens minds are ſo taken vp with the loue of earthly things, that they begin to ſlacke and coole in matters of Gods worſhip.
               The fourth and laſt is, a truſting in riches, and ſtaying vpon them, as though our liues were maintained by them, or did conſiſt onely in them: which thing our Lord Jeſus flatly denieth, ſaying: Though a man haue abundance,
                  
                  yet his life conſiſteth not in the things that hee hath. Luke.
                   12. 15.
               Theſe then are foure euident ſignes and tokens, whereby we may certainly diſcerne, that meus harts and intrailes are infected with couetouſneſſe.
            
            
               Phila.
               You haue very well ſatisfied vs in this point. Now let vs vnderſtand the originall cauſesTwo cauſes of Couetouſneſſe. of Couetouſneſſe.
            
            
               Theol.
               There be two ſpeciall cauſes of Couetouſneſſe. The one is the ignorance and diſtruſt of Gods prouidence.
               The other is the want of taſting and féeling of heauenly things: For till men taſte better things, they will make much of theſe: till they feele heauen, they will loue earth: til they be religious, they will be couetous.
               Therfore the cauſe is ſoone eſpied, why men are ſo ſharpe ſet vpon theſe outward things, and doe ſo admire riches, worldly pompe, pleaſures, and treaſures: Becauſe they know no better, they neuer had taſte or feeling of thoſe things which are eternall.
            
            
               Phila.
               Now as you haue ſhewed vs the cauſes of Couetouſneſſe, ſo let vs alſo heare of the effects.
            
            
               Theol.
               If I once enter into this, I ſhall bée entar gled and wound vp in a maze, where I know not how to get out againe. For, the euill

effects of this vice are ſo many, and ſo great, that I know not almoſt where to begin, or where to end. Notwithſtanding, I will enter into it; get out how I can.
            
            
               Phila.
               If you doe but giue vs ſome taſte of them it ſhall ſuffice.
            
            
               Theol.
               Then will I briefly diſpatch things in order. And firſt of all, I reaſon from the wordes of the Apoſtle before alleadged, that if couetouſnes, and the loue of meny be the root of all euill, then it is the root of idelatry, the root of murther, the root of theft, the root of lying, the root of ſwearing, the root of ſymony, the root of bribery, the root of vſury, the root of lawing, the root of all contentions in the Church, and the root of all brabling and brawling in the Common weaith. Moreouer, it ſpreadeth far & néere, it dwelleth in euery houſe, in euery towne, in euery city; it prieth into euery corner, it creepeth into euery heart; it anoieth our Phyſitians, it infecteth our Diuines, it choaketh our Lawyers, it woundeth our Farmers, it baneth our Gentlemen, it murthereth our tradeſ-men, it be witcheth our Merchants, it ſtingeth our mariners. Oh couetouſnes, couetouſnes, it is the poiſon of al things, the wound of Chriſtianitie, the bane of all goodneſſe! For couetouſneſſe marres all: it marreth all, euery where, in all places, in all degrées, amongſt all

perſons. It marreth marriages: for it coupleth young to old, and old to young. It marreth hoſpitality, it marreth all good houſe-kéeping, it marreth almes déeds, it marreth Religion, it marreth Profeſſors, it marreth Miniſters, it marreth magiſtrats, it marreth all things. And therefore what ſinne ſo grieuous, what euill ſo odious, what vice ſo enormous as this? For this cauſe it was pretily ſaid of one: that all other vices are but Factors to Couetouſnes, and ſerue for Porters to fetch and bring in her liuing. She maketh ſymonie her drudge, bribery her drudge, vſury her drudge, deceit her drudge, ſwearing her drudge, lying her drudge. O what a diuell incarnate is this, that ſetteth ſo many vices a worke, and hath ſo many Factors and vnderlings to ſerue her turne! Are they not in a prety caſe, thinke you, that are infected with this ſin? Oh, they are in a moſt miſerable caſe. It had béene good they had neuer béene borne. For being aliue they are dead: dead I meane in their ſoules. For Couetouſnes is ſoules poyſon, and ſoules bane. Couetouſnes is the ſtrongeſt poiſon to the ſoule that is. It is a confection of all the Spiders. Toades, Snakes, Adders, Scorpions, Baſiliſkes, and all other the moſt venemous vermine of the whole world? If the diuell can get vs to take downe but one pennyweight of it, it is enough, he deſires no more.

For preſently we fal down ſtark dead. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith: They that will be rich (he meaneth in all haſte, by hooke or by crooke) fall into temptations, and ſnares, and into many1. Tim. 2. fooliſh and noiſome luſts, which drowne men in deſtruction and perdition. For, as Couetouſneſſe is ranke poiſon to the ſoule: ſo the Apoſtle compareth it to the déepe gulfe, wherein thouſands are drowned. And therefore he addeth in the ſame place: But thou O man of God flie theſe things. In which words he doth moſt grauely aduiſe all the Miniſters of the word of God, to take héed of it. For as it is dangerous to all men; ſo it is moſt dangerous and offenſiue in the preachers of the Goſpell.
            
            
               Phila.
               Indeede it muſt needs be graunted, that Couetouſneſſe is a very grieuous ſinne: yea euen a monſter with ſeuen heads. Yet for all that, wee ſee in this our iron age, how many of all ſorts are infected with it: and how few will giue any thing to any holy vſe. Moſt men now adayes haue nothing to ſpare for Chriſt, nothing for his Goſpell, nothing for his Church, nothing for the poore children of God, and needy members of Chriſt. Chriſt is a little beholden vnto them: for they will do nothing for him, no not ſo much as ſpeake a good word in his cauſe, or the cauſe of his poore Saints. Euery little thing with them,

is too much for God, and good men. For when they come to giuing vnto holy and neceſſary vſes, then they will ſticke at a penny, and ſcotch at a great, and euery thing is too much. But to beſtow vpon themſelues, nothing is too much. Nothing is too much for luſt, for pleaſure, for backe, bellie, and building; for cards and dice, for whores and harlots, for rioting and reuelling, for Tauernes and brothel-houſes. Hundreds and thouſands are little enough, and too little, for their expences this way. It is lamentable to conſider, what maſſes of mony are ſpent and beſtowed vpon theſe things. But, alas, alas, how heauie an account are they to make in the day of the Lord, which ſo ſpend their lands, liuings, and reuenues! I quake to thinke what ſhall become of them at laſt. It were well for them, if they might be in no worſe caſe then a Crocodile, or a curre dogge.
            
            
               Theol.
               It is moſt certaine that you ſay: and we all haue great cauſe to lament it, & to take vp the old complaint of the Prophet Ieremie, ſaying: From the leaſt of them, euen vnto the greateſt of them, euery one is giuen vnto Couetouſneſſe:Ier. 6. 16. and from the Prophet euen vnto the Prieſt they all deale falſly. And another Prophet ſaith: they build vp Zion with blood,Mic. 3. 10. and Ieruſalem with iniquitie. The heads thereof iudge for rewards, and the Prieſts thereof
                  
                  teach for hire, and the Prophets thereof prophecy for mony: yet will they leane vpon the Lord and ſay: Is not the Lord amongſt vs? no euill can come vnto vs. But theſe holy Prophets, and men of God, doe fully deſcribe vnto vs the ſtate of our time: wherein, though all be corrupted, yet we beare our ſelues ſtoutly vpon God, we preſume of his fauour, becauſe of our outward profeſſion, and ſay in our hearts: No euill can come vnto vs.
            
            
               Aſune.
               You ſay very true, Sir. The world was neuer ſo ſet vpon couetouſneſſe, and men were neuer ſo greedily giuen to the world, as now adaies. And yet (in truth) there is no cauſe why men ſhould be ſo ſharpe ſet vpon this world. For this world is but vanity: and all is but pelfe and traſh. Fie on this mucke.
            
            
               Phila.
               Many ſuch men as you are, can ſkill to giue good words, and ſay: Fie on this world: al is but vanity: and yet for all that in your daily practiſe, you are neuertheleſſe ſet vpon the world, nor neuer the more ſeeke after God. You heare the word of God no whit the more, you read no whit the more, you pray neuer the more; which euidently ſheweth, that all your faire ſpeeches, and proteſtations, are nought elſe but hypocriſie and leazing. Your heart is not with God, for all this. All is but words, there is no ſuch feeling in the heart.

And therefore I may iuſtly ſay to you, as God himſelfe ſaid to his people: This people haueDeut. 5. 28. ſaid well, all that they haue ſaid. Oh, that there were an heart in them to feare me, and keep my commandements!
            
            
               Theol.
               His wordes indéed are good; if his heart were according. For all things conſidered, there is no cauſe why men ſhould be ſo giuen to this world: For they muſt leaue it, when they haue done all that they can. As we ſay: To day a man, to morrow none. And as the Apoſtle1. Tim. 6. ſaith: We brought nothing into this world: and (it is certaine) we ſhall carry nothing out. We muſt all die, we know not how ſoone: why therfore ſhould men ſet their hearts vpon ſuch vncertaine and deceiuable thinges? for all things in this world are more light then a feather, more brittle then glaſſe, more fléeting then a ſhadow, more vaniſhing then ſmoke, more vnconſtant then the winde. Doubtleſſe ſaith the Prophet Dauid: Man walketh in a ſhadow, and diſquieteth himſelfe in vaine: he heapeth vp riches, and cannot tell who ſhall gather them: Pſalm.
                   39. 6. I wonder therefore that theſe Moules and Muck-wormes of this earth, ſhould ſo minde theſe ſhadowiſh things, and ſo dote on them as they doe. If they were not altogether hardned and blinded by the diuell, they would not be ſo néerely knit

to the clod and the peny as they are: thinking, and alwaies imagining, that there is no happineſſe but in theſe things, which are but dung and droſſe: and at laſt they will giue vs the ſlip, when we thinke our ſelues moſt ſure of them.
               The wiſe king, who had the greateſt experience of theſe things, that euer man had (for hée enioyed whatſoeuer this world could affoord, vpward and downeward, backward and forward) yet could find nothing in them, but vanity and vexation of ſpirit. Moreouer, he flatly auoucheth, that all theſe things, riches, wealth, honour, pleaſures, and treaſures, will moſt notably deceiue vs in the end, giue vs the ſlip and be gone. For he compareth riches, and all the glorie of this world, to an Eagle or Hawke, which a man holdeth vpon his fiſt, ſtroketh her, maketh of her, taketh great delight and pleaſure in her, and ſaith he wil not take ten pounds for her: yet al on the ſudden ſhe taketh her flight, and flieth vp into the ayre, and he neuer ſéeth her more, nor ſhée him. The wordes of the holy Ghoſt are theſe: Wilt thou cauſe thine eyes toPro. 23. 5. flie after them? (meaning riches) Thou mayſt: but they will not be found. For they will make themſelues wings like to the Eagle, which flieth vp to Heauen. From thence wée may learne, that though wée ſet our hearts neuer ſo much on any thing here below: yet at

the laſt it ſhall be taken from vs, or we from it.
               Therefore all worldly men doe but weaue the Spiders webbe, and may fitly be compared to the ſilly Spider, who toileth her ſelfe, and laboureth all the weeke long to finiſh vp her webbe; that ſhe may lodge her ſelfe in it, as in her owne houſe and frée▪hold. But alas, at the weeks end, a Maid in a moment with one bruſh of a broome, diſpeſſeſſeth her of her in heritance which ſhe had purchaſed with great labour and much adoe. Euen ſo, when the men of this world haue, with much care and trauell, purchaſed great lands and reuenewes, and gathered all that they can: yet on the ſudden, death (with one ſtroke of his direfull dart) will make them giue vp the ghoſt: and then where are they? It was pretily therefore ſaid of a man in the light of nature: No man hath euer liuedHerodotus Polym. ſo happily in this life, but in his life-time many things haue befallen him, for the which he hath wiſhed rather to die then to liue. And aſſuredly I thinke there was neuer any man liued any one day vpon the fare of this earth, but ſome griefe or other either did, or iuſtly might inuade his minde ere night; either in the temptations of the world, the fleſh, or the diuell▪ or in regard of ſoule, body, goods, or name: in regard of wife, children, friends, or neighbours: in regard of dangers to Prince, Eſtate, church,

or Common wealth: in regard of caſualties and loſſes by water by fire, by Sea or by land. What a life therefore is this, that hath not one good day in it? Who would deſire to dwell long in it? For it lieth open euery day to manifold miſeries, dangers, loſſes, caſualties, reproaches, ſhame, infamie, pouerty, ſickneſſe, diſeaſes, collickes, agues, tooth-ache, head-ache, backe-ache, bone-ache, and a thouſand calamities.
            
            
               Phila.
               You haue very well deſcribed vnto vs the vanitie of this life, and that no day is free from one ſorrow or other, one griefe or other. Which thing our Lord Ieſus ratifieth, in the reaſon which he bringeth, why men ſhould not diſtruſtfully care for to morow. For, ſaith he, Sufficient vnto the day is the euill thereof. Or, asMat. 6. ſome reade it. The day hath enough with his owne griefe. Where in hee doth plainely ſhew, that euery day hath his ſorrow, his euill, his griefe, and his thwart. But I pray you proceed further in this point.
            
            
               Theol.
               This I ſay further: that when men haue ſwinked and ſweat, carked & cared, moiled and turmoiled, drudged & droiled by night & by day, by ſea and by land, with much care and ſorrow, much labour and griefe, to rake together the things of this life; yet at laſt, all will away again, and we muſt end where we began.

                  For, as Iob ſaid; Naked wee came into the world: and naked we muſt goe out. Iob
                   1. For euen as a wind-mill beateth it ſelfe, maketh a great noiſe, whiſleth and whiſketh about from day to day, all the yéere long; yet at the yéeres end ſtandeth ſtill where it begun, being not mooued one foot backward or forward: ſo when men haue bluſtered and blowen all that they can, & haue euen run themſelues out of breath, to ſcrape vp the commodities of the earth, yet at laſt they muſt (ſpite of their beards) end where they began: end with nothing, as they began with nothing: end with a winding ſhéet, as they began with ſwadling clouts. For what is become of the greateſt Monarchs, Kings, Princes, Potentates, and Magnificoes, that euer the world had? Where is Cyrus, Darius, Xerxes, Alexander, Caeſar, Pompey, Scipio and Hanniball? Where are the valiant Henries, and noble Edwards of England? Are they not all gone downe to the houſe of obliuion? Are they not all returned to their duſt, and all their thoughts periſh? Though they were as Gods, yet haue they died as a man, are fallen like others.
               Who now careth for them? who talketh of them? who feareth them? who regardeth them? do not beggars tread vpon them? Yet while they liued, they were the Lords of the world:

they were as terrible as Lions: fearefull to all men: full of pompe and glorie, dignitie and maieſtie. They plowed vp all things, they bare all before them, and who but they? But now they haue giuen vp the ghoſt, and are (as Iob ſaith)Iob 30. 23. gone downe to the houſe appointed for all the liuing. Their pompe is deſcended with them, and all their glorie is buried in the aſhes. They are now couered vnder a cled, caſt out into a vault, made companions to toades, and the wormes do eat them: and what is become of their ſoules, is moſt of all to be feared.
               Thus wée ſée, how all fleſh doth but make a vaine ſhew for a while vpon this Theatre of miſery, fetcheth a compaſſe about, and is preſently gone. For as the Poet ſaith: Seriùs aut citiùs ſedem properamus ad vnam: Firſt, or laſt, we muſt all to the graue.
            
            
               Aſune.
               You haue made a very good ſpeech. It doth me good to heare it. I wonder, all theſe things conſidered, that men ſhould be ſo wholly giuen to this world, as they are. I thinke the diuell hath bewitched them. For they ſhall carry nothing with them when they die, but their good deeds and their ill.
            
            
               Theol.
               The drudges and ſnudges of this world, may very fitly be compared to a Kings lumpter-horſe, which goeth laden all the day long, with as much gold and treaſure, as hée

can beare; but at night his treaſure is taken from him, he is turned into a ſory durtie ſtable, and hath nothing left him, but his galled backe. Euen ſo the rich cormorants and caterpillers of the earth, which here haue treaſured and hoorded vp great heapes of gold and ſiluer (with the which they trauell loaden thorow this world) ſhall in the end be ſtript out of all, let downe into their graue, and haue nothing left them but their galled conſciences, with the which they ſhall be tumbled downe into the dungeon of eternall darkeneſſe.

               Wherein doth the ſting and ſtrength of the world eſpecially conſiſt?
            
            
               Theol.
               Euen as the great ſtrength of Sampſon lay in his haire; ſo the great ſtrength of the world lieth in her two breaſts: the one of pleaſure, the other of profit. For ſhe, like a notable ſtrumpet, by laying out theſe her breaſts, doth bewitch the ſonnes of men, and allureth thouſands to her luſt. For if ſhe cannot winne them with the one breaſt, yet ſhe gameth them with the other: if not with pleaſure, then with profit: if not with profit, then with pleaſure. Hée is an odde man of a thouſand, that ſucketh not of the one breaſt or the other. But ſure it is, which ſoeuer he ſucketh, he ſhall be poiſoned. For ſhée giueth none other milke, but ranke poyſen. The world therefore is like to an alluring Iael,
                  
which ſitteth at her doore, to entiſe vs to come in, and eat of the milke of her pleaſures: but when ſhe hath once got vs in, ſhe is ready (euenIud. 4. 21. while we are eating) with her hammer and her naile, to pearce thorow our braines.
            
            
               Phila.
               I ſee plainely, this world is a very ſtrumpet, a ſtrong bait, and a ſnarling net, wherein thouſands are taken. It is very birdlime, which doth ſo belime our affections, that they cannot aſcend vpward. It is like the waights of a clocke, hanged vpon our ſoules, which draweth them downe to the earth: it naileth vs faſt downe to the ground. It mortifieth vs into clay: it maketh vs abhominable vnto God. For I remember God made a law, that whatſoeuer goeth with his breaſt vpon the ground,Leuit. 11. ſhould be abhominable vnto vs. How much more theſe carnall world-lings, which are faſt ſodered to the earth!

               The Apoſtle S. Iames ſéeing into the déep wickedneſſe of this world, and knowing right wel how odious it maketh vs in the ſight of God, crieth out againſt it, terming it adultery, and all worldlings adulterers; becauſe they for ſake Chriſt their true huſband, & whoriſhly giue their hearts to this world. O yee adulterersIam. 4. & adultereſſes, ſaith he, know yee not that the amitie of this world, is the enmitie of God?
               
               
                  Whoſoeuer therefore will bee a friend of
                  
                  this world, maketh himſelfe the enemy of God. And who dare ſtand forth and ſay, I will be the enemy of God? Who therefore dare be a worldling? For euery worldling is the enemy of God. What then will become of you, O yée wicked worldlings?
            
            
               Phila.
               It appeareth then plainely by the Scriptures, that the exceſſiue loue of this world, and vnſatiable deſire of hauing, is a moſt dangerous thing; and men do they know not what, in ſeeking ſo greedily after it.
            
            
               Theol.
               The heathen man will riſe vp inSophocles. iudgement againſt vs: for he ſaith; Vnſatiableneſſe is the fouleſt euill amongſt mortal men. But many of our ſea-gulfs and whirle-pooles make no conſcience of it. They thinke it is no ſinne: they deuoure and ſwallow vp all; and yet are neuer ſatiſfied. They will haue all, and more then all, and the diuell and al. The whole world cannot ſatiſfie their mind: but God muſt create new worlds, to content them. Theſe men are ſicke of the Golden dropſie: the more they haue, the more they deſire. The loue of money increaſeth, as mony if ſelfe increaſeth. But the Scripture ſaith: He that loueth ſiluer, ſhall notEccl. 5. 9 be ſatisfied with filuer. Oh therefore, that wée would ſtriue earneſtly to get out of this gulfe of hell, and tread the moone, that is, all worldly things, vnder our féet: as it is ſpoken of theApo. 12 1.
                  
Church: and that we would ſet our affections on the things that are aboue, and not on the things that are beneath: that we would flie an high pitch, and ſo are aloft as the Eagles, looking downe at this world, and all things in it, as at our féet, contemning it, and treading the very glory of it vnder our féet, that it may neuer haue more power ouer vs!

ForCan. 6. 4. how happy a thing is it, to haue our conuerſation in heauen, that is, to haue an inward conuerſation with God, by much praier, reading, meditation, and heauenly affections! This indeed is, to clime vp aboue the world, and to conuerſe in the chambers of peace. Oh therefore, that we could ſeriouſly and thorowly conceiue and conſider of this world as it is, that we would well weigh the vanity of it, and the excellency of that which is to come, that we might loath the one, and loue the other: deſpiſe the one, and imbrace the other: loue God more than euer we did, and this world leſſe. For what is this world but vanity of vanities?

               You doe exceedingly abaſe that, which ſome make their god. You ſpeake contemptuously

               The world is a ſea of glaſſe, a pageant of fond delights, a Theatre of vanity, a labyrinth of errour, a gulfe of griefe, a ſtie of filthineſſe, a vale of miſery, a ſpectacle of wo, a riuer of téeres, a ſtage of deceipt, a cage full of Owles, a denne of Scorpions, a wilderneſſe of Wolues, a cabben of Beares, a whirl-wind of paſſions, a fained Comedie, a delectable phrenſie; where is falſe delight, aſſured griefe, certaine ſorrow, vncertaine pleaſure, laſting wo, fickle wealth, long heauineſſe, ſhort ioy.

               Now you haue indeed deſcribed it to the full, and laide it out (as it were) in orient colours. And a man would thinke, he were bewitched, or ſtarke mad, which heereafter ſhould ſet his minde on it. But yet I am deſirous to heare a little more of that, which I aſked you before; where in the ſtrength and poyſon of the world doth ſpecially conſiſt.

               In this lieth a great ſtrength of the world, that it draweth downe the ſtars of heauen and maketh them fall to the earth, as it is

ſaid of the Dragons taile. Apoc: 12. which is, ambition, conetouſnes, & the loue of this world. For we may wonder and lament, to ſée how the loue of theſe things hath wounded & ouerborne many excellent ſeruants of God, both Preachers and profeſſors of the Goſpell: which thing doth plainly argue the ſtrength of it. For it is the ſtrongeſt & the very laſt engine, that ſathan vſeth to impugne vs withall, when none other will preaaile. For when no temptation could faſten vpon Chriſt, he bringeth foorth this laſt weapō which neuer faileth: All theſe thingsMatth. 4. will I giue thee: ſhewing him the glory of the whole world. So then he (hauing experience of this, that it neuer faileth) thought to haue ouercome Chriſt himſelfe with it. Héere therefore, lieth the very ſting and ſtrength of the world & the diuel. For whom hath he not takē, with All theſe things will I giue thee? whom hath he not wounded? whom hath he not deceiued? whom hath he not ouerthrowen? with this he enticed Baalam: with this hée beguiled Achan: with this he ouerthrew Iudas: with this he be witched Demas; with this in theſe our daies, he deceiued many of excellent gifts. For aſſuredly, he is a Phoenix amongſt men, which is not ouercome with this. He is a wonderment in the world, that is not moued with mony.
            
            
               Phila.
               I am now fully ſatisfied for this matter.

But one thing commeth often into my minde; to wit, that theſe miſerable worldlings can haue no ſound comfort in their pleaſures and profits: becauſe they haue no comfort in God, nor peace in their owne conſciences.
            
            
               Theol.
               You ſay very true. It is vnpoſſible, that men, louing this world, ſhould haue anie ſound comfort in God. For no man can ſerue two maſters, both God and riches. Their caſe therefore is very dangerous & fearefull, though they neuer ſée it, nor féele it: as I will ſhew you by a plaine example. Put caſe, one of theſe great rich worldlings ſhould be clothed in veluet & cloth of gold, in moſt ſtately manner; and alſo ſhould be ſet at his table, furniſhed with al the dainties of the world; ſhould be attended and waited vpon by many, in moſt Lordly and pompous manner; ſhould ſit in his goodly dining-chamber, all glittering like golde; ſhould haue his firſt, ſecond, & third ſeruice ſerued in, with minſtrels and inſtruments of muſicke, in moſt royall ſort; he ſitteth in his chaire, like a King in his throne: yet for all this, if a dagger ſhould be held to his heart all this while, ready to ſtab him▪ what pleaſure, what ioy, what comfort can he haue in all the reſt? Euen ſo, whatſoeuer pompe or pleaſures wicked worldlings haue héere below, yet their guilty & helliſh conſcience is, as it were, a dagger, held alwayes

hard to their hart; ſo as they can haue no ſound cōfort in any thing. Or let me giue it you thus: Put caſe a man hath committed high treaſon, and were therfore apprehended, arraigned, and condemned to be hanged, drawen and quartered: what then can comfort him in ſuch a caſe? can mirth, can muſicke, can gold, can ſiluer, can lands, can liuings? No, no: none of all theſe can help him, or giue him any comfort. For the continuall thoughts of death do ſo gripe him at the heart, that none of all theſe can do him any good or any whit mitigate his griefe. What then is the thing that may comfort him in this caſe? Only a pardon, ſealed with the Kings broad ſeale, and ſubſcribed with his owne hand. For as ſoone as he hath got this, his heauy heart reuiueth, and leapes for ioy. This then aſſuredly is the very cauſe of all prophane Atheiſts and worldlings, who are not aſiured of the King of heauen his pardon for their ſinne: and then, what ioy can they haue either in their meat, drinke, goods, cattell, wiues, children, lands, reuenewes, or any thing whatſoeuer? For the dreadful thoughts of hel do eftſoones croſſe them inwardly, & quite dampe & daſh all their mirth. Their owne conſciences will not be ſtilled: but in moſt terrible manner, riſe vp & giue euidence againſt them, telling them flatly, they ſhall be damned, how merry and iocund ſoeuer they

ſéeme to be in this world; ſetting a good face on the matter. For ſure it is, that inwardly they haue many a cold pull, and many heart gripes. And all their mirth and iollity, is but a gigling from the téeth outward: they can haue no ſound comfort within. And therefore the wiſe KingPro. 14 13. ſaith; Euen in laughter the heart is ſorrowfull: and the end of that mirth is heauineſſe. Likewiſe ſaith the holy man Iob; Terrors of conſcience come vpon the wicked man like waters: inIob. 27. 20. the night a whirle-winde carrieth him away ſecretly. Eliphas the Temanite, auouched the ſame point, ſaying: The wicked man is continually as one that trauaileth of child: a ſoundIob. 15. 20. of feare is in his eares, &c. Thus then wée ſée, that howſoeuer many carnall Atheiſts, and vngodly perſons, ſéem outwardly to float aloft in all mirth and iollity, bearing it out (as w

               You haue ſpoken many things very ſharpely againſt couetouſneſſe: but in my mind, ſo long as a man couets nothing but his owne, he cannot be ſaid to be couetous.
            
            
               Theol.
               Yes, that he may. For not only is he couetous, which gréedily deſireth other mens goods; but euen he alſo which ouer niggardly and pinchingly holdeth faſt his owne, & is ſuch

a miſer, that he will part with nothing. We ſée the world is full of ſuch pinch-pennies, that wil let nothing goe; except it be wrung from them perforce, as a key out of Hercules hand.
               Theſe gripple muck-rakers had as léeue part with their blood, as their goods. They wil pinch their owne backs & bellies, to get their god into their cheſts. And when they haue once got him in there, will they eaſily part with him trow yée? No, no: a man will not part with his god, for no mans pleaſure. He will eat peaſebread, and drinke ſmall drinke, rather then he will diminiſh his god. Therefore the ſcripture ſaith: Eate not the meat of him that hath an euill eye:Pro. 13. 6. and deſire not his dainty diſhes. For as hee grudgeth his owne ſoule; ſo he will ſay vnto thee: Eat and drinke, when his heart is not with thee. Thou ſhalt vomit thy morſels, which thou haſt eaten, and loſe thy pleaſant ſpeeches. The old ſaying is, The coueteus man wanteth as well that which he hath, as that which hée hath not: becauſe he hath no vſe of that which he hath. So then you ſée, there is a great ſtrength of couetouſneſſe, in the niggardly kéeping of our owne.
            
            
               Antil.
               Yet, for all this, men muſt follow their worldly buſineſſe, and lay to liue. For it is an hard world, and goods are not eaſie to come by. Therefore men muſt plie their buſineſſe,

                  or elſe they may go beg or ſtarue.
               
            
            
               Theol.
               I deny not, but that you may follow the works of your calling diligently: ſo it be in the feare of God, and with a good conſcience, as I told you before: but this gréedineſſe and grippleneſſe God doth condemne, and alſo this exceſſiue loue of mony.

               Beleeue me I know no body that hateth it, I cannot ſee, but that all men loue gold and ſiluer.
            
            
               Theol.
               It is one thing to vſe theſe things: and another thing to loue them & ſet our hearts vpon them. For the Scripture ſaith: If riches increaſe, ſet not your heart vpon them: Pſa.
                   62. S. Iohn alſo ſaith: Loue not this world, nor the1. Ioh. 2. things that are in this world. He ſaith not, vſe not this world, but loue not this world. For vſe it we may: loue it we may not. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith: that they which vſe this world,1. Cor. 7. ſhould be as though they vſed it not. Where he alloweth a ſober and moderate vſe of the things of this life, in the feare of God. We muſt vſe this world for neceſſities ſake, as we vſe meat and drinke. For, no more of this world then néedes muſt: for feare of ſurfetting. The holy Ghoſt ſaith: Let your conuerſation be without couetouſnes, & be content with things preſent.
                  Heb. 13. 5. Happy is that man therefore, that is well content with his preſent eſtate whatſoeuer,

and carrieth himſelfe moderately and comfortably therein. For the ſpirit ſaith: There is no profit to a man vnder the Sunne: but that hee eat and drinke, and delight his ſoule withEc. 2. 24. the profit of his labours. I ſaw alſo this, that this is of the hand of God. In which words, the prudent King ſaith thus much, in effect: that this is all the good we can attaine vnto in this world, euen to take a ſober and comfortable vſe of the things of this life, which God beſtoweth vpon vs. And further hée auoucheth, That thus to vſe them aright, and with ſound comfort, is a very rare gift of God. For as one ſaith: He is a wiſe man, that is not greeued forGregorius Nazi. the things which he hath not: but doth reioyce in the things that he hath: vſing them to Gods glorie, and his owne comfort. So then I conclude this point, and returne you an anſwer thus: That we may in ſober and godly manner, vſe gold, ſiluer, and the things of this life: but at no hand to ouer-loue them, or giue our hearts vnto them.
            
            
               Antile.
               Well: yet for all this, I cannot ſee, but that theſe preachers and profeſſors, theſe learned men, and preciſe fellowes, are euen as eager of the world, & as couetous as any other.
            
            
               Theol.
               Now you ſhew your venemous ſpirit, againſt better men then your ſelfe. And I haue a foure-fold anſwer for you. Firſt I anſwer,

that although godly men may be ſomewhat ouertaken this way, and ouer-ſpirt a little, yet they breake not out ſo groſiv as others. Secondly, if God leaue them ſometimes to be ouercome of the world: yet he, in his great wiſedome and mercy, turneth it to their good. For thereby he firſt humbleth them, & afterward raiſeth themRom. 8. vp againe. And ſo all things worke together for good, to them that loue God. Thirdly, I anſwer, that we liue by rules, & not by examples. For euen the beſt of Gods people haue had their wāts and weakneſſe. Therefore we may not frame rules to liue by, out of the infirmities of the moſt excellent ſeruants of God. Wicked therefore & impious is their allegation, which alleage Dauids adultery, Lots drunkennes, Peters fall, Abrahams ſlips, Salomons weakeneſſe, &c. for a ſhelter & defence of themſeines in the like ſins. Laſtly, I anſwere, that you do greatly wound your ſelfe, in your own ſpéech: ſo far off are you from mending your market any whit thereby. For if Preachers and other godly men (after many prayers and téeres, & much meanes vſed) cannot eſcape ſcot-frée, but ſomtimes are wounded, and almoſt ouerthrowen, by the world and the Diuel; what then ſhall become of you, which vſe no meanes at all, nor any gaine ſtriuing, but willingly giue place to the Diuell? If the Diuell did ouer-maſter Dauid, Lot, Sampſon,
                  
                  Salomon, and other ſuch excellent Worthies: alas, what ſhall become of méere worldlings and Atheiſts? If the moſt valiant men, and thiefe Captaines in a battell goe downe, what ſhall become of the faint-hearted ſouldiers? and as Saint Peter ſaith; If the righteous ſcarſe1. Pet. 4. 18. be ſaued, where ſhall the wicked and vngodly appeare? So then I take you at the rebound, and returne your owne weapon vpon your ſelfe, that ſith godly men cannot eſcape thorow this world, without blowes, what ſhall become of them which know not what godlineſſe meaneth?
            
            
               Antile.
               Yet, I ſay once againe, that men muſt liue, men muſt lay for this world: wee cannot liue by the Scriptures. And as for that which you call couetouſneſſe, it is but good husbandrie.
            
            
               Theol.
               I thought, wée ſhould haue it at laſt. Now you haue paid it home: you are come to the old bias, and as an Hare to her old forme, and her old couert. For this is the very couert and thicket of the world, wherein they would hide couetouſneſſe: but I will do what I can to hunt you out of it, by the Scriptures.
               Firſt, Salomon ſaith: He that ſpareth morePro. 11. 24. then is right, ſhall ſurely come to pouertie. So then you ſée, that couetouſnes bringeth pouerty. Thus therefore I reaſon: that which bringeth

pouerty is no good huſbandry: but couetouſneſſe, and too much ſparing, bringeth pouertie: therefore it is no good huſbandry. The ſame Salomon ſaith; He that is giuen to gaine, troubleth his owne houſe. That is, the couetous man is an occaſion of many euils, in his eſtate and family. From this Scripture I do thus reaſon; That which troubleth a mans houſe, is no good huſbandrie: but couetouſneſſe troubleth a mans houſe: therefore it is no good huſbandrie. Laſt of all, the old prouerbe ſaith: Couetouſneſſe bringeth nothing home. And therfore it is no good huſbandrie. For oftentimes we do ſée, that men, for couetouſneſſe of more, loſe that which otherwiſe they might haue had. One of the wiſe Heathen ſaith: Euill gaine is as bad asHeſiodus. loſſe. But the couetous man doth ſéeke after wicked gaine, and therefore ſéeketh loſſe: and conſequently, is no good huſband. Another ſaith: Vniuſt gaine, bringeth both loſſe and miſery.
                  Phocillides. And therefore it is far enough off from vertue, and all good huſbandry. Thus then, I hope, you are ſo hunted both by God and men, that this couert cannot hide you. And therefore you muſt out of it, and ſéeke ſome other ſhelter: for this will not ſerue your turne.

               Now, I muſt needs ſay, you haue fully ſtopt his mouth, and thorowly ferrited him out of his deepe burrow. And it is moſt certaine,

that you ſay: that the wiſe heathen haue condemned couetouſneſſe and all vniuſt gains, which we both practiſe and defend: and therefore will riſe vp in iudgement againſt vs. But now let vs leaue this cauiller, and proceed in our matters. There is one thing yet remaining, wherin I deſire to be ſatisfied.
            
            
               Theol.

               I would gladly know which bee the ſpeciall remedies againſt couetouſneſſe.
            
            
               Theol.
               There be two ſpeciall remedies againſt couetouſneſſe: to wit, Contentation, and the meditation of Gods prouidence.
            
            
               Phila.
               Let vs heare ſomewhat of Contentation, out of the Scriptures.
            
            
               Theol.
               The Apoſtle ſaith: Hauing food and1. Tim. 6. 7. rayment, we muſt therewith bee content. For wee brought nothing into this world: and it is certaine wee ſhall carry nothing out. The Spirit alſo ſaith: Let your conuerſation beeHeb. 12. 5. without couetouſneſſe, and bee content with your preſent eſtate. Againe, the Apoſtle ſaith: Hee had learned in what eſtate ſoeuer heePhil. 4. was, therwith to be content. Note that he ſaith, he had learned: for he had it not of himſelfe. For Contentation is the ſingular gift of God: as it is written: The righteous eateth to the Contentation of his ſoule: but the bellie of theCyril. in Ioan. 4. wicked ſhall want. Pro.
                   13. 25. An ancient Father

ſaith: We ought to accuſtome our ſelues to liue of a little, and to be content; that wee may do no wicked or filthy, thing for lucres ſake.
                  Chryſoſt. homil. 51. Another ſaith: He is not poore that hath nothing: but he that deſireth much. Neither is he rich that hath much, but hee that wanteth nothing; for contentation neuer wanteth. There is no griefe in lacking, but where there is immoderate deſire in hauing. If we will liue after nature, we ſhall neuer be poore; if after our owne appetite, we ſhall neuer be rich. Well therefore ſaid the Poet: Wax not rich vniuſtly, but iuſtly;Euripedes. Be content with thine owne things; abſtaine from other mens. Thus then we ſée, that both God himſelfe (the fountaine of all wiſedome) & men alſo, both in the ſtate of nature & grace, doe all ioyntly aduiſe vs to ſtriue for Contentation: and then ſhall we haue a ſoueraigne remedy againſt Couetouſneſſe.
            
            
               Phila.
               Let vs heare ſomewhat of the ſecond remedies againſt Couetouſneſſe.
            
            
               Theol.
               An earneſt thinking vpon the prouidence of God, is a preſent remedy againſt the moſt fooliſh & pining carefulneſſe of men for this life. For if we would ſeriouſly weigh & déeply conſider the prouident care that God hath had for his children in all ages, touching food & raiment; and how ſtrangely he hath prouided for them, it might ſuffice to correct this euil in vs,

and miniſter vnto vs a notable preſeruatiue againſt couetouſneſſe.
               We read how wonderfully the Lord did prouide for his Prophet Eliah, in the time of the great dearth & drought, that was in Iſrael. Did not the Lord command the rauens to féed him, by the riuer Cherith? did not the rauens bring1. Ki. 17. him bread & fleſh in the morning, & bread & fleſh in the euening, and he drunke of the Riuer?
               What ſhould I ſpeake, how miraculouſly God prouided for Hager and her infant, when they were both caſt out of Abrahams houſe, and brought to great extremity! euen both of them ready to giue vp the ghoſt for want of food.
               Did not God helpe at a pinch, as his mannerGen. 21. 15. hath alwaies bin? did not he ſend his angell vnto them, & both comfort thē, & prouide for them? What ſhould I ſpeak how ſtrangely God prouidedExod. 15. 4. Exod. 17. 6. Pſal. 7. 8. for his church in the wildernes? Did he not féed them with Manna from heauen, and gaue them water to drinke out of the Rocke? Hath not our heauenly Father made many royall and large promiſes, that he will prouide neceſſaries for his children? Shall we not think that hée will be as good as his word? Doth héePſ. 34. 10. not ſay: The Lions lacke, and ſuffer hunger; but they which ſeeke him, ſhall want nothing that is good? Doth hée not ſay: Feare him all yee Saints; for nothing is wanting
                  
                  to them that feare him? Doth he not ſay: NoPſal. 8. 4. 11. Mat. 6. 33. good thing ſhall bee withheld from them that walke vprightly? Doth he not ſay: Our heauenly father knoweth, that we haue neede of theſe things: and that all theſe things ſhall be caſt vpon vs, if we earneſtly ſeeke his kingdome? Doth he not bid vs, caſt all our care vpon1 Pet. 5. 7. Luke 12. Heb. 13. 5. him? For he careth for all. Doth he not bid vs, take no thought what wee ſhall eate, or what we ſhall drinke, or wherewithall we ſhall bee cloathed? Meaning thereby, no diſtracting or diſtruſtfull thought. Doth he not ſay, He will not leaue vs not forſake vs? Doth he not ſay: The Lord is at hand: in nothing be carefull?
                  Phil 4. 5. Are not theſe large promiſes ſufficient to ſtay vp our faith in Gods prouidence? ſhal we think God ieſteth with vs? ſhall we thinke he meaneth no ſuch matter? ſhall we imagine he will not kéepe touch? Oh, it were blaſphemy once to thinke it: For God is true, and all men lyers. He is faithfull that hath promiſed. His word is more then the faith of a Prince: more then ten thouſand Obligations: Why then doe we not reſt vpon it? why goe we any further? why doe we not take his word? why doe we not depend wholly vpon him? why are we ſtill couetous? why are we ſtil diſtruſtful? why doe we diſſemble, & deceiue? Oh we of little faith! Our Lord Jeſus (knowing right well the diſtruſtfulneſſe

of our nature, and the déepe root it hath in vs) is not only content to make theſe great and royall promiſes vnto vs which were inough; but alſo ſtrengthneth and backeth vs with many ſtrong reaſons, to ſupport our weakeneſſe in this behalfe. He therefore bringeth vs backe, to a due conſideration of things. Conſider (ſaith he)Luk. 12. 
                  the Rauens; conſider the foules of the heauens; For they neither ſow nor reape, nor carry into barnes; and yet God feedeth them; they want nothing. Conſider the Lillies how they grow; they neither labour, nor ſpinne; yet Salomon in all his royaltie, was not cloathed like one of theſe. Oh therefore that wée would conſider theſe Conſiders! Oh that wée would conſider that our life is more worth then meat, and our bodies then rayment! Oh that we would conſider, that with all our carking and caring, we can doe no good at all; no, not ſo much as adde one cubite to our ſtature! Truly, truly, if we would déepely ponder theſe reaſons of our Sauiour, and apply them to our ſelues, they might ſerue for a bulwarke and ſure defence againſt Couetouſneſſe. If men would conſider how that great King of heauen (who hath his way in the whirl-wind, and the clouds are the duſt of his féet) careth for the little wren, and ſillyNahun. 12. ſparrow; how he looketh to them, how he tendereth them, how he prouideth for them euerie

day, both break-faſt, dinner, and ſupper: it might ſerue to correct our diſtruſtfulneſſe. For who euer ſaw theſe, or any other ſoule ſtarue, for hunger? ſo good a father, and ſo good a nurſe haue they. And are not we much better then they? hath not God more care of vs, then of them? yes verily, a thouſand times. For he loueth them, but for our ſakes: how much more then doth he loue our ſelues? Therfore I ſay again & again: if we would conſider theſe things, & lay them to heart, they wold nip couetouſnes on the head, & driue it quite out of our hearts. Let vs conſider therefore, that God prouided for man before man was: then how much more will he prouide for man, now that he is? Is he our Father, & wil he not prouide for vs? Is he our king, and wil he not regard vs? Is he our ſhepheard, and wil he not looke to vs? Hath he prouided heauen for vs, and wil he not giue vs earth? Hath he giuen vs his ſonne Chriſt, and ſhal he not with him giue vs all things? Doth he prouide for his enemies, and wil he not prouide for his friends? doth he prouide for whoremongers; & wil he neglect his choſen? Doth he ſend his raine, & cauſe his Sunne to ſhine vpon the vniuſt, and ſhall he not vpon the iuſt? Doth he prouide for them which are not of the family, & will he not prouide for his owne family? Will a man féed his Hogges, and not care for

his ſeruants? Or will he care for his ſeruants, and not regard his owne children? Oh then let vs conſider theſe reaſons: let vs remember, that our heauenly Father hath as great care for the preſeruation of his creatures, as once hée had for their creation. Let vs therefore remember, that our life conſiſteth not in theſe things; but in the prouidence of God. Let vs remember, that he which giueth the day, will prouide for the things of the day. Let vs remember, that God alwaies giueth for ſuſtentation, though not for ſatietie. Let vs remember, that God will not famiſh the ſoules of the righteous.
                  Pro. 10. 38. Let vs remember how God neuer failed his. For who euer truſted in the Lord, and was confounded?

               What then is the cauſe that many do want outward things?
            
            
               Theol.
               The cauſe is in themſelues, becauſeIerom. ad. Heliodorum. Cyprian. in Oratione dominica. they want faith. For if wée had faith, wée could want nothing. For faith feareth no famine, as ſaith an ancient Father. And another ſaith: For as much as al things are Gods, he that hath god can want nothing: if he himſelfe be not wanting vnto God. Therefore to haue God is to haue al things. For if we haue him our friend we haue enough, we néed goe no further. For hée will make men our friends: yea hée will make Angels, & all creatures to be ſeruiceable vnto vs: he

will giue them a ſpeciall charge to looke to vs, to guard vs, and to doe continuall homage vnto vs. Therefore let vs make God our friend, and then haue we done all at once, that may concerne our good, both for this life, and a better. But if he ſtand not our friend, if wée haue not him on our ſide, if he backe vs not, then all other things whatſoeuer, can do vs no good: allAuguſt. is not worth a button. For Quid prodeſt, ſi omnia habes, eum tamen, qui omnia dedit, non habere? What is a man the better though hée haue all things, and be without him which is the author of all things?
            
            
               Phila.
               Herein you ſpeake very truely, no doubt. For wee ſee, many haue great plenty of outward things: but becauſe they haue not God, they can haue no true comfort in them, or bleſſing with them.
            
            
               Theol.
               True indéed: For man liueth not by bread onely (ſaith our Lord Jeſus) but byMatth. 4. euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. And againe he ſaith: Though a manLuke 12. haue abundance, yet his life conſiſteth not in the things that he hath. For without Gods bleſſing, there can be no ſound comfort in any thing. Wée ſée by dayly experience, how the Lord curſeth the wicked, though they haue abundance. For, ſome hauing abundance, yet are viſited with continual ſickneſſes. Some hauing

abundance, pine away with conſumptions. Others hauing abundance die of ſurfetting. Others are ſnatched away by vntimely death, in the middeſt of all their iollitie. Others are viſited with great loſſes both by ſea and by land. Others are vexed with curſt wiues, and diſobedient children. Some againe commit murders, and treaſons, and ſo loſe all at once. Others are waſted and conſumed, by the ſecret curſe of God; no man knoweth how. Some hauing great riches, are giuen ouer to the murtherer, ſome to the theefe, ſome to the poiſoner. Therefore the wiſe king ſaith: There is an euill ſickneſſe vnder the ſun; riches reſerued to the owners thereof, for their euill. Eccleſ.
                   5. 12.
               
                  Zophar alſo, the Naamathite, ſaith; WhenIob 20. 22. the wicked ſhall haue ſufficient and enough, he ſhall be brought into ſtraits: The hand of euery troubleſome man ſhall be vpon him. When he ſhould fill his belly, God will ſend vpon him his fierce wrath: which he ſhall raine vpon him in ſtead of his meat.
               
               Thus then it is cleare, that mans life and good eſtate, dependeth not vpon the abundance of outward things, but only vpon the bleſſing and prouidence of God. For, His bleſſing only maketh rich, and it doth bring no ſorrowPro. 10. 12. Pſa. 37. 16. with it. For, Better is a little vnto the inſt, then great abundance to many of the wicked. Better
                  
                  is a little with the feare of the Lord, thanPro. 25. 16. Pro. 16. 8. great treaſure, and trouble therewith. Better is a little with righteouſneſſe, then great reuenews, without equity.
               
               Thus then I conclude this point. Man liueth not by bread, but by a bleſſing vpon bread; not by outward meanes, but by a bleſſing vpon meanes. For how can bread, being a dead thing, and hauing no life in it ſelfe, giue life to others?

               I doe not well vnderſtand the meaning of theſe words: By euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
            
            
               Theol.
               Thereby is meant, the decrée, ordinance, and prouidence of God, which vpholdeth all things, euen the whole order of nature:
               For the Scripture ſaith: He ſpake and it wasPſal. 33. 9. done: he commanded and they were created; In which words we plainly ſée, that God doth but ſpeake, and it is done: he doth command, and all creatures are preſerued. For God doth all things with a word. He created all with his word: he preſerueth all with his word: he ſpeaketh & it is done. His words are words of power, & authority. Whatſoeuer he ſaith, whatſoeuer he calleth for, it muſt be done preſently, without any delay, there is no withſtanding of him. He calleth for famine, and behold famine. He calleth for plenty, and behold plenty. He calleth

for peſtilence, and behold peſtilence. He calleth for the ſword, and behold the ſword. All Angels, all men, all beaſts, all fiſhes, all fowles, all creatures whatſoeuer muſt obey him, and be at his beck. He is the greateſt Commander: his word commandeth heauen and earth and the ſea. All creatures muſt be obedient to his will, and ſubiect to his ordinance.
               This is the cauſe, why all things both in heauen, earth, and the ſea, do kéepe their immutable, and vnuariable courſes, times and ſeaſons, euen becauſe he hath charged them ſo to doe. And they muſt of neceſſity alwaies, at all times, and for euer obey, for the creatures muſt obey the Creator. This act of Parliament was made the firſt wéeke of the world, and neuer ſince was or can be repealed.

               But to call you backe againe, to the point we had in hand: reſolue me, I pray you, of this; Whether many of the deare children of God, do not in this life ſometimes want outward things, and are brought into great diſtreſſe?
            
            
               Theol.
               Yes certainly. For Eliah did want, &1 Reg 17. 2. Cor. 1. 8. 2. Cor. 11. 25. Heb. 11. 36. was in diſtreſſe. Paul did want, & was in many diſtreſſes. The holy Chriſtians, mentioned in the Hebrewes, did want, and were in maruellous diſtreſſes. Many of Gods deare ones haue in all ages wanted, and at this day alſo doe

want, and are greatly diſtreſſed. But this is a moſt infallible truth, that howſoeuer Gods children may want, & be low brought; yet they are neuer vtterly forſaken, but are holpen euen in greateſt extremities: yea, when all things are deſperate, and brought euen to the laſt caſt.
               To this point, moſt notably ſpeaketh the Apoſtle ſaying; Wee are afflicted on euery ſide, but yet we deſpaire not: we are perſecuted, but2. Cor. 4. 8. not forſaken: caſt downe, but wee periſh not. The Prophet Ieremie alſo ſaith; The Lord willLament. 3. not forſake for euer: but though hee ſend affliction, yet will be haue compaſſion, according to the multitude of his mercies. For hee doth not puniſh willingly, or from his heart, nor afflict the children of men. The kingly Prophet ſaith; Surely the Lord will not faile hisPſal. 94. 14. Eſa. 55. 8. people, neither will hee forſake his inheritance. The Lord himſelfe ſaith; For a moment in mine anger, I hid my face from thee; but with euerlaſting mercy haue I had compaſſion on thee. So then we may fully aſſure our ſelues, and euen write of it (as a moſt vndoubted and ſealed truth) that Gods children ſhall neuer be vtterly forſaken, in their troubles.
            
            
               Phila.
               Sith the care and prouidence of God is ſo great for his children, as you haue largely declared: what then I pray you is the cauſe, why God ſuffereth his to bee brought into ſo many

troubles and neceſſities.
            
            
               Theol.
               Their profit and benefit is the cauſe, and not their hurt. For he loueth them, when he ſmiteth them: Hée fauoureth them, when hée ſéemeth to be moſt againſt them. He aymeth at their good, when he ſéemeth to bée moſt angry with them. He woundeth them, that hée may heale them. He preſſeth them, that he may eaſe them. He maketh them cry, that afterward they may laugh. He alwaies meaneth well vnto them, he neuer meaneth hurt. He is moſt conſtant in his loue towards them. If he bring them into neceſſities, it is but for the triall of their faith, loue, patience, and diligence in prayer.
               If he caſt them into the fire, it is not to conſume them, but to purge and refine them. If he bring them into great dangers, it is but to make them call vpon him more earneſtly, for helpe and deliuerance.
               He preſſeth vs, that we might cry: we crie, that we may be heard: we are heard, that we might be deliuered. So that héere is no hurt done: we are worſe ſcared, then hurt.
               Euen as a mother, when her childe is wayward, threatneth to throw it to the Wolfe, or ſcareth it with ſome pocar, or bul-begger, to make it cling more vnto her and bée quiet: So the Lord oftentimes ſheweth vs the terrible

faces of troubles and dangers, to make vs cleane and cling faſter vnto him: and alſo to teach vs to eſteeme better of his gifts when wée enioy them, and to be more thankfull for them; as health, wealth, peace, liberty, ſafety, &c. So then ſtill we ſée, here is nothing meant on Gods part, but good: As it is written; All things worke together for good, to them that loueRom. 8. God. For euen the afflictions of Gods childrenHeb 12. 10. Heb. 12. 14. 1. Theſ. 1. 6. Gal. 6. 14. Phil. 3. 10. 1 Cor. 11. 32. Rom. 5. 3. 4. are ſo ſanctified vnto them by the ſpirit, that thereby they are made partakers of Gods holineſſe. Thereby they inioy the quiet fruit of righteouſneſſe. Thereby they attaine vnto a greater meaſure of ioy in the holy ghoſt. Therby the world is crucified to them, and they to the world. Thereby they are made conformable to Chriſts death. Thereby they are kept from the condemnation of the world. Therby they learne experience, patience, hope, &c. So that, all things conſidered, Gods children are no loſers by their afflictions, but gainers. It is better for them to haue them, then to be without them: they are very good for them. For when Gods children are chaſtiſed, it is as it ſhould bée. For to them, the croſſe is mercy, and loſſe is gaine. Afflictions are their ſchooling, and aduerſity their beſt Uniuerſity.Pſa. 119. 27.
               
               
                  It is good for me (ſaith the holy man of God)

                  that I haue beene afflicted, that I might learne thy ſtatutes. By his afflictions therefore, hée learned much, and became a good ſcholar in Gods booke, and well ſéene in his Statutes and Lawes. Hée grew to great wiſedome and iudgement by his chaſtiſments. All things turned about, in Gods mercifull prouidence, to his euerlaſting comfort. For I ſay againe, and againe, that all things tend to the good of Gods choſen people. And therefore that eſtate, which GOD will haue his children to bée in, is alwaies beſt for them. Becauſe hée, who can beſt diſcerne what is beſt, ſéeth it to bée beſt for them: whether it bée ſickneſſe or health, pouerty or plenty, priſon or liberty, proſperity or aduerſity. For ſometimes ſickneſſe is better for vs then health, and pouerty then plenty. Are therefore the children of God ſicke? it is beſt for them. Are they poore? it is beſt for them. Are they in any trouble? it is beſt for them: becauſe their good Father will turne it to the beſt. Hee will oftentimes cut vs ſhort of our luſts, and deſires; becauſe hée ſeeth wée will bane our ſelues with them. Hée, in fatherly care, will take the knife from vs; becauſe hée ſéeth wée will hurt our ſelues with it. He will kéepe vs ſhort of health, and wealth, becauſe hée knoweth wee will bée the worſe for them.

He will not giue vs too much eaſe, and proſperity in this world; for he knoweth it will poiſon vs. He will not allow vs continuall reſt, like ſtanding pondes: for then he knoweth we will gather ſcum and filth. He dealeth fatherly and mercifully with vs in all things, euen then ſeeking our greateſt good, when we thinke he doth vs moſt harme.
               And to ſpeake all in a word; hée bringeth vs into troubles and ſtraits, to this end eſpecially, that he may heare of vs. For he right wel knoweth our nature: he is wel acquainted with our diſpoſition. He knoweth we will not come at him, but when we ſtand in neede of him: we care not for him, ſo long as all goeth well with vs. But if we come into diſtreſſe, or want any thing that we would faine haue, then he is ſure to heare of vs. As he ſaith by the Prophet: InHoſ. 5. 15. their affliction, they will ſeeke me early.
               
               And another Prophet ſaith; Lord, in troubleEſa. 26. 16. haue they viſited thee. They powred out a praier, when thy chaſtiſement was vpon them. So then now I hope, you do plainely ſée the cauſe, why the Lord bringeth his children into ſo many troubles and neceſſities.
            
            
               Phila.
               I doe ſee it indeed: and I am very well ſatisfied in it. But yet let me aske you one thing further. Are Gods children alwaies ſure to be deliuered, out of their troubles?
            
            
               
               Theol.
               Yes verily: and (out of doubt) ſo far foorth, as God ſéeth it good for them. For it is written: Great are the troubles of the righteous;Pſ. 34. 20. but the Lord deliuereth them out of all. S. Peter ſaith: The Lord knoweth how to deliuer2. Pet. 1. 9. the godly out of temptation. As if hée ſhould ſay: He is beaten in it, and well ſéene and experienced in it: ſo as he can doe it eaſilie, and without any trouble at all. It is ſaid of Ioſeph, being in priſon: that, when his appointedPſ. 105. 19. 20. time was come, and the counſell of the Lord had tried him, the King ſent and looſed him, the Ruler of the people deliuered him. And againe, the Scripture ſaith; The righteous cry, and thePſal. 34. Lord heareth them, and deliuereth them out of all their troubles. The Angell of the Lord tarrieth round about them that feare him, and deliuereth them. And in another place, the Lord himſelfe ſaith, concerning the righteous man;Pſ. 91. 14. 15. 
                  Becauſe hee hath loued mee, therefore I will deliuer him. I will exalt him, becauſe he hath knowen my name. Hee ſhall call vpon mee in trouble, and I will heare him. I will bee with him in trouble: I will deliuer him, and glorifie him. So alſo ſaith Eliphas the Temanite: HeIob. 5. ſhall deliuer thee in ſix troubles: and in the ſeuenth, the euill ſhall not touch thee. Come my people, ſaith the Lord, enter thouEſa. 16. 20. into thy Chambers, and ſhut thy doores after
                  
                  thee; hide thy ſelfe for a very little while, vntill the indignation paſſeouer. And the Prophet ſaith: Vpon Mount Zion ſhall be deliuerance, and it ſhall be holy; and the houſe of IacobObad. 17. ſhall poſſeſſe their hereditary poſſeſſions. Almoſt innumerable places of the Scriptures might be alledged, to this purpoſe: but theſe may ſuffice. Therefore let vs know for a certainety, that ſo ſure as trouble and affliction are to the Children of God, ſo ſure alſo is deliuerance out of the ſame. As we may write of the one, and make reckoning of it as ſure as the coat of our backe; ſo may we alſo, in Gods good time, write of the other, and make full account of it as ſure as the Lord is true. Abraham was in trouble; but deliuered. Iob in trouble; but deliuered. Dauid in great troubles; but deliuered. The thrée Children in the Furnace; but deliuered. Daniel in the Lions den; but deliuered. Ionas in the Whales belly; but deliuered. Paul in innumerable troubles; but yet deliuered out of all.
            
            
               Phila.
               All this being true, that you ſay, it followeth, that Gods children are chaſtiſed only for their good, and euermore ſure of deliuerance in his appointed time. Which thing being ſo, me thinketh there is no cauſe at all why they ſhould be ouer heauie, or too much caſt downe in their afflictions.
            
            
               
               Theol.
               Aſſuredly there is no cauſe at all; but rather cauſe why they ſhould reioyce, clap their hands, and ſing care away. For can a father forſake his children? a ſing his ſubiects? a Maiſter his ſeruant? or a Shéepe heardHeb. 13. his ſhéepe? Doth not Iehouah ſay, I will nor leaue thee nor forſake thee? Doth not our heauenly Father know, wée haue néede of theſe things? Hath not God geuen vs his word, that wée ſhall not want outward things? Hath hée not ſaid: They ſhall be caſt vpon vs? Why then ſhould wee be diſmaied? Why ſhould wée hang downe our heades? Why doe wée not plucke vp our hearts? and be of good cheare? God is our deare Father: he is our beſt friend: hée is our daily Benefactor: hée kéepeth vs at his owne coſts and charges: hée grudgeth vs nothing: hée thinketh nothing too much for vs. He loueth vs moſt dearely: he is moſt chary and tender ouer vs: hée cannot endure, the winde ſhould blow vpon vs: he will haue vs want nothing that is good for vs. If we will eate gold, wée ſhall haue it. He hath giuen vs his faithfull promiſe, that as long as wée liue, wée ſhall neuer want. Let vs therefore reioice and be merry. For Heauen is ours, earth is ours, God is ours, Chriſt is ours, all is ours.
               As the Apoſtle ſaith: All is yours, and you1. Cor. 3. 22.
                     
are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods. The world clap their hands, and crow long before it bée day, ſaying, all is theirs: but the children of God may ſay, and ſay truely: All is ours. For they haue a true title, & proper intereſt, through Chriſt in all the creatures. Many are their priuiledges, great are their prerogatiues. They are frée of heauen, and frée of earth. They are the onely frée Deniſens of the world. Chriſt hath purchaſed them their fréedome. Chriſt hath made them frée, and therefore they are frée indéed. They are frée from ſinne, frée from hell, frée from damnation. They are at peace with God, men & Angels. They are at peace with themſelues. They are at peace with all creatures. They are yong Princes, Angels fellowes, deſcended of the higheſt houſe, of the bloud royall of heauen, ſtates of Paradiſe, and heires apparent to the immortall Crowne. Therefore God hath commanded his Angels to guard them, being ſuch yong Princes as they are: yea, he hath giuen a very ſtraight charge to all his creatures, to look to them, to ſée to them, that they want nothing, that they take us hurt; ſo teaſous, ſo chary, ſo tender is he of thē. The angels muſt cōfort Iacob. The whaleGen. 32. 1. Kin. 17. Iona. 2. Ioſ. 10. muſt reſcue Ionas. The rauens muſt féed Elias. The Sun and Moone muſt ſtay for Ioſhua: The Sea muſt diuide it ſelfe, that Moſes and

his people may paſſe thorow. The fire muſtExod. 14. Dan. 3. Dan. 6. not burne the thrée children. The Lions may not deuoure Daniel. All the creatures muſt change their nature, rather then Gods children ſhould not be holpen and deliuered. Oh therefore how great is the happineſſe of Gods choſen! Who can expreſſe it? who can vtter it? They know not their owne happineſſe: it is hid from them. Afflictions doe cloud it; troubles doe ouerſhadow it; croſſes doe dim it: and there is an interpoſition of the earth, betwixt their ſight and it. But this is moſt certain and ſure, that the beſt is behind with the children of God: all the ſwéet is to come. Their happines doth not appeare in this world. Their life isCol. 3. 3. 4. hid with Chriſt in God. When Chriſt ſhall appeare, then ſhall they alſo appeare with him in glorie. It doth not yet appeare, what they ſhall1. Ioh. 3. 1. bee: but when hee commeth, they ſhall bee made like vnto him. Their names are already taken, and entred into the booke of life: and one day, they ſhal be crowned. One day it ſhall be ſaid vnto them: Come yee bleſſed, &c. One day, they ſhall enioy his preſence, where is fulneſſe of ioy; and at whoſe right hand, there is pleaſure for euermore. Pſal.
                   16. Therefore let all Gods ſecret ones reioyce, ſing and be mery. For howſoeuer in this world they be contemned, trodden vnder the foot, made no bodies,

and walke as ſhadowes; being counted as the very rags of the earth, and the abiects of the world: yet the time wil come, when their happineſſe and felicitie ſhall be ſuch, as neuer entred into the heart of man, it is endleſſe, vnſpeakeable, and vnconceiueable.
            
            
               Phila.
               I doe now plainely ſee, that there is no cauſe why Gods people ſhould be too heauy and dumpiſh in their afflictons. I ſee, that though they be not free from all afflictions, yet are they free from all hurtfull afflictions. For no rod, no croſſe, no chaſtiſement is hurtfull vnto them: but all in the concluſion commeth to a bleſſed iſſue.
            
            
               Theol.
               You haue vttered a great, and a moſt certaine truth. For there is no affliction or trial, which God impoſeth vpō his children, but if they endure it quietly, truſt in his mercy firmely, and tary his good pleaſure obediently, it hath a bleſſed and comfortable end. Therefore the people of God may well be merry, in the middeſt of their ſorrowes. They may, with patience & comfort, ſubmit themſelues to their Fathers corrections; taking them patiently, and euen kiſſing his holy rod, and ſaying in themſelues: Sith my Father will haue it ſo. I am content; ſéeing it is his minde, I am willing withall. As old Ely ſaid: It is the Lord, let1. Sam. 3. 48. him doe what hee will. And as Dauid in like

ſubmiſſion, ſaid in a certain caſe: Behold, here2. Sam. 25. 26. am I: let him doe to me, as ſeemeth good in his owne eyes. And in another place, he ſaith:Pſal. 39. 
                  I was dumbe, and opened not my mouth: becauſe thou Lord haſt done it. Behold, here then the patience of Gods Saints, and their humble ſubmiſſion vnto his moſt holy will. They know all ſhall end well; and that maketh them glad to thinke of it. I conclude then, that the children of God are happy, in what ſtate ſoeuer they are: happy in trouble, happy out of trouble, happy in pouertie, happy inDeut. 28. plenty, bleſſed in ſickneſſe, bleſſed in health, bleſſed at home likewiſe, and abroad, and euery way bleſſed. But on the contrary, the wicked are curſed, in what ſtate ſoeuer they are: curſed in ſickneſſe, curſed in health, curſed in plenty, curſed in pouertie, curſed in proſperitie, curſed in aduerſitie, curſed in honour, curſed in diſhonour. For all things worke together, for their deſtruction. Nothing doth them any good. They are not any thing the better, either for Gods mercies or iudgements. All weathers are alike vnto them. They are alwayes the ſame, in proſperitie and aduerſity: they are no changelings. And, as we ſay: A good yeare doth not mend them; nor an ill yeare paire them.
            
            
               Phila.
               You haue long inſiſted vpon this

point. Now proceed to the fourth ſigne of a mans damnation; which is the contempt of the Goſpell: and lay open both the greatneſſe of the ſinne, and the danger of it.
            
            
               Theol.
               This ſinne is of another nature, then the former. It is a ſinne againſt the firſt Table. It toucheth the perſon of God himſelfe. For to contemne the Goſpell, is to contemne God himſelfe; whoſe Goſpell it is. If to contemne the Miniſters of the Goſpell, be to contemne God and Chriſt, as our Lord Jeſus auoucheth (Luke 10. 16.) how much more then, to contemne the Goſpell it ſelfe? Therefore it is dangerous meddling in this ſinne. It is to meddle with edged tooles, to meddle with princes matters, to touch the Arke, to come héere the holy mountain: which all were things full of great perill and danger. Yea, it is to ſpill the Sacrament. It is Noli me tangere. It is to raile at a King. It is to ſpit God in the face. It is high treaſon againſt the King of glory. Therefore this ſinne, of all other, can neuer be endured; and may, at no hand, be borne withall. For can a mortall King endure the contempt of his lawes? can he put vp the contempt of his owne perſon? Can he abide any to ſpit at his Scepter, or to throw a ſtone at it? No ſurely, hée will not.
               Therefore the holy Ghoſt ſaith: He that deſpiſeth
                  
                  Moſes Lawes, dieth without mercy, vnder two or three witneſſes. Of how much ſorerHe. 10. 28. puniſhment ſuppoſe yee ſhall hee bee worthy, which treadeth vnder foot the Sonne of God, and counteth the bloud of the Teſtament as an vnholy thing (wherewith hee was ſanctified) and doth deſpiſe the Spirit of grace. And againe; If they were puniſhed which obeiedHeb. 2. 5. not the word ſpoken by Angels; how ſhall wee eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſaluation? If theyHeb. 13. eſcaped not, which refuſed him, that ſpake on earth; how ſhall wee eſcape, if we turne away from him that ſpeaketh from heauen? Therefore our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith; That it ſhall beLuk. 10. 12. eaſier for Sodome in the day of iudgement, then for the contemners of the Goſpell.
               
               Moreouer he ſaith; The Queene of theMatt. 12. South ſhall riſe vp in iudgement, againſt all froward deſpiſers of his Word. For ſhe came from the vttermoſt parts of the earth to heare the wiſedome of Salomon: and behold a greater then Salomon is heere. For Chriſt is greater then Salomon, his doctrine and wiſedome farre more excellent. And therefore their ſinne is the greater which contemne it. They ſhall neuer be able to anſwer it. For the ſpirit ſaith; Hee that deſpiſeth the word, ſhall be deſtroied.
                  Par. 13. 13
               
               S. Peter alſo telleth vs, that the old world,Pet. 3. 19. and men of the firſt age, are now in hell fire, becauſe

they both deſpiſed, & were diſobedient to2. Pet. 2. 5. the doctrine of Chriſt, which (though not perſonally, yet in his diuine ſpirit) he ſpake by Noah. So then we ſée clearely, God will neuer take it at our hands, that his glorious Goſpell ſhould be ſo vniuerſally & openly contemned as it is.
            
            
               Phila.
               You haue ſpoken moſt truly, and alſo ſhewed it out of the Scriptures, that the contempt of the Goſpell is a moſt hainous ſin: yet for all that, it is moſt lamentable to conſider, how little men eſteeme it, and how light they make of it. Many regard it, no more then an eg-ſhell; they thinke it is not worth a gally halfpenny; they will not goe to the doore to heare it; they take it to be but a breath from vs, and a ſound to them: and ſo the matter is ended. They eſteeme it but as a noiſe, or empty ſound, in the aire; or, as a voice afar off, which a man vnderſtandeth not: they neuer felt the power of it in their hearts. Therefore they preferre their ſheep, their Farmes, their Oxen, their profits, their pleaſure, yea euery thing before it; they know it not to be any ſuch pretious iewell, as it is. Although our Lord Ieſus himſelfe compare it to a hid treaſure, and a moſt pretious pearle; yet theſe filthy Swine of the world tread it vnder feet. For they know not the price of it; though Salomon the wiſe ſaith; All the marchandiſe of gold & ſiluer, pearle & pretious ſtons, are not toPro. 3.
                  
bee compared vnto it: yet theſe beaſts, theſe dogs and hogs of the world contemne it. They eſteeme a cow more, then Chriſts moſt glorious Goſpell. They are like Eſops cocke, which made more account of a Barlie corne, then all the pretious ſtones in the World: they are like little children, that eſteeeme their rattles, more then a bag of gold: they are like the Gadarenes, which eſteemed their Hogs, more then Chriſt and his Goſpell: they make nothing of it. They thinke it not worth the while. Many of them ſit idle in the ſtreets euen vpon the Sabboths. While the Goſpell is preached in their churches, many are at cards, and tables, in Ale-houſes. Many, vpon the Sabboths, ſleep vpon their beds, all the Sermon while, in the after-noone. Many will heare a Sermon in the fore-noone: and they take that to be as much as God can require at their hand, and that he is ſomewhat beholden vnto them for it; but as for the afternoon they will heare none: then they will to bowles or Tables.

O miſerable wretches! O curſed catifes!

O monſtrous hel-hounds: which ſo groſly and openly contemne the Goſpell of Chriſt! What will become of them in the end? Aſſuredly their damnation ſleepeth not. A thouſand deathes wait for them: they lie open on all ſides to the wrath of God. And wee may wonder at his maruellous patience, that he doth not throw downe balles of wild-fire from heauen, to conſume and burne vp, both them, their ſhops, and houſes, and euen make them ſpectacles of his vengeance, for ſo notorious contempt of ſuch ſacred, holy, and high things.

               You haue ſpoken very truly, zealouſly, and religiouſly; and I doe greatly commend you for it. And I muſt néeds affirme the ſame things. For they cānot be denied. And for mine own part, I think the Goſpell was neuer ſo openly contemned in any age (of a people liuing vnder the profeſſion of it, and vnder a godly and chriſtian prince) as it is in this age. For howſoeuer ſome make a ſhew of religion, yet they haue denied the power thereof. They turne the grace of God into wantonnes, as S. Iude ſaith, verſ. 4. They make the Goſpel a cloake for their ſins. They receiue it & imbrace it, as it wil beſt ſtand with their profits & pleaſures, their luſts & likings, their credit & policies, and not a iot further. They will practiſe it at their leaſure. Theſe men profeſſe they know God: but by
                  
                  their works they deny him, & are abhominable,Tit. 1. 10. diſobedient, and to euery good work reprobate; This age is full of ſuch carnall Proteſtants.

               This age indeed aboundeth with many hollow hearted hypocrites, diſſemblers & timeſeruers; which howſoeuer they make a face, and beare a countenance as though they loued the Goſpell, yet their heart is not with it. Their heart is with Atheiſme; their heart is with Popery. They haue a Pope in their bellie; they bee Church-Papiſts. Howſoeuer, now and then, they come to the Church, and heare a Sermon, and ſhew a good countenance to the preacher; yet their heart goeth after couetouſneſſe. The Lord complaineth of this, by his Prophet Ezechiel, ſaying; This people will ſit before theeEze. 33. 32 and heare thy words; but they will not do them. For, with their mouths they make ieſts; and their hart goeth after couetouſnes. God complaineth of this alſo, by his Prophet Ieremy, ſaying; Will you ſteale, murther, and commit adultery, andIe

Is this houſe become a den of theeues, wherupō my name is called? Where we ſee, how the Lord doth chide his people, and ſharply reproue them, for abuſing of his temple, worſhip & ſacrifices; making them a cloake for their ſins;

and making his houſe a den of theeues, which ſhould bee an aſſembly of Saints. Now all this is a liuely deſcription of our time; wherein many vſe the exerciſes of the world, prayer, and ſacraments, not to kil and mortifie ſin, but to nouriſh and ſhelter their ſinnes. For they blindly imagine, that if they come to the church & pray, and heare the Sermon, they are diſcharged of their ſins, though they leaue them not. They imagine they haue giuen God his full due; and that therefore they may be the more bold to ſin afterward. Theſe kind of hypocrites are like rogues, which vſe medicines, not to cure ſores, but to make ſores. Theſe are like the Papiſts, which think, if they heare maſſe in the morning, they may doe what they liſt, all the day after.

               I ſée now, you haue very well profited in the knowledge of God, & true religion. You haue ſpoken ſoundly, and like a man of knowledge, in Gods matters. For the common ſort of people thinke indéed, that all religion conſiſteth in the outward ſeruice of God, though their hearts be far from him. To whom God may iuſtly ſay: This people draweth neere me with their lips but their hearts are far from me.

               The great contempt of the Miniſters of the Goſpell in this age, doth ſtrongly argue the contempt of the Goſpell it ſelfe. For a man cannot loue the Goſpell, and hate the faithfull Miniſters thereof. But wee ſee, by lamentable experience, that the moſt graue, godly and learned Miniſters, are had in deriſion of very baſe and vile perſons. And as Iob ſaith: TheyIob 30. 1. whoſe fathers I haue refuſed to ſet with the dogs of my flock, they were the children of fools, and the children of villaines, which were more vile then the earth; For now euery Raſcall daresTit. 1. 7. 1.

And though the holy Ghoſt giueth them glorious and lofty titles (as, the Stewards of Gods owne houſe, diſpoſers of his ſecrets, disburſers of his treaſure, keepers of the broad ſeale, keepers of the keyes of heauen,

Gods Secretaries, Gods Embaſſadors, Angels; yea, the very glory of Chriſt: and all this, to expreſſe the excellencie of their calling) yet theſe vile varlets and venemous vermine of the earth, dare call them proud prelats, pild parſons, pelting prieſts. O monſtrous and intolerable impietie! Now it is come to paſſe, that this moſt ſacred function (which is glorious in the ſight of God, and his Angels, and in it ſelfe moſt honorable) is had in greateſt contempt, of all callings. For now the earth is full of ranke Atheiſts, and mock-gods; which ſcoffe at the Goſpell, and bleare out their tongues at all Religion. Theſe kind of fellowes neuer diſſemble for the matter. They make no ſhew at all, they are no hypocrites, they hide not their ſins; but declare them openly, like Sodom. They care not if they neuer come to the Church: they are too ful of it. They liue like brute beaſts. They think the Scriptures are but fables. They raile at the Miniſters and Preachers. They make flat oppoſition againſt them, and are notorious mockers & paſt-graces.

               Of ſuch the Apoſtle S. Peter foretold,2. Pet. 33. that in the laſt daies ſhould come mockers, and ſuch as would liue after their owne luſts, &c.
               
               Of ſuch, a godly writer ſaith: Verbum Dei ſecurè
                  Caluin. 
                  contemnitur, promiſſiones inanes eſſe creduntur, minae pro fabulis habentur. That is, The word of God is careleſly contemned, his promiſes are

counted vaine, and his threatnings fables. Of ſuch the Poet ſaith;
               
                  Heu viuunt homines, tanquam mors nulla ſequatur:
                  Aut velut Infernus fabule vana foret.

               Now is alſo the time, wherein the world ſwarmeth with papiſts and Atheiſts; and moſt men liue as if there were no God. For now religion is hated, true godlineſſe deſpiſed, zeale abhorred, ſincerity ſcoffed at, vprightneſſe loathed, preachers cōtemned, profeſſors diſdained, & almoſt all good men had in deriſion. For now we may iuſtly complaine with the Prophet:Eſa. 59. 14. 
                  Iudgement is turned backe-ward, and Iuſtice ſtandeth farre off. Truth is failen in the ſtreets, and equitie cannot enter. Yea, trueth faileth; and he that refraineth from euill, maketh himſelfe a pray. The Prophet Micha bewaileth the times ſaying: The good man is periſhed out of the earth, and there is none righteousMic. 7. 2. among men. They all lie in wait for blood: euery man hunreth his neighbour with a net. The Prophet Ieremie complaineth of the ſame euill in his time; namely, that the people were come to be paſt ſhame in ſinning. Were theyIer. 8. 12. aſhamed (ſaith he) when they had committed abhomination? Nay, they were not aſhamed, neither could they haue any ſhame. This is a

liuely picture and a very counterpane of our time. For now we haue put on a brow of braſſe: we are become impudent in ſinne. We cannot bluſh: we cannot be aſhamed. We are almoſt paſt ſhame, and paſt grace. O Lord what will this géere grow to in the end!

               Theol.
               You haue ſpoken a truth. And wée haue heard before how the old world was plagued for it. And wée read how grieuouſly the Jewes were aſflicted by the Romanes for this ſin: as our Lord Ieſus did plainly foretell. We read alſo, that after the Lord had broached the Goſpell himſelfe, and ſpread it abroad by his Apoſtles, conquering the world thereby (which thing was ſignified by the white horſe, his rider, his bow and his crowne) and yet ſhortly after, ſaw that the ſame began to be contemnedApoc. 6. 2. in the world and made light of; then hée did in moſt fearfull manner plague the earth with warres, blood-ſheddings, tumults, dearth, famine, and peſtilence: which all are ſignified by the red horſe, the black horſe, and the pale horſe, which did appeare at the opening of the ſecond, third, and fourth ſeale. So likewiſe vndoubtedly,

                  God will ſeuerely puniſh all iniuries, wrongs, & contempts, done to his faithfull embaſſadours; as appeareth Apocal. 11. 5. where it is ſet downe, that if any would hurt the two witneſſes with their two Oliues, and two candleſticks, (whereby is ſignified the faithfull Preachers of the Goſpell, with all their ſpirituall treaſures and heauenly light) fire ſhould procéed out of their mouthes, and deuoure their aduerſaries. That is, the fire of Gods wrath ſhould conſume all that had oppreſſed them, either by mockes, flouts, railings, ſlaunders, impriſonment, or any other kinde of indignity. Of this we haue a plaine example or two, in the Scripture. Firſt, we read how fire came downe from Heauen, and conſumed the contemptuous2. King 1. 10. 2. King. 1. 23. captain and his fifty, at the threatning and calling for of Eliah. Secōdly, how two Beares came out of the forreſt, and tare in péeces 42. yonkers, which mocked Eliſhah the Prophet of God; calling him bald-head, bald-pate. So then by theſe examples, it is manifeſt, that howſoeuer the Lord may wink at theſe things for a time, and make as though hée ſaw them not: yet the time will come, when he will raine fire and brimſtone vpon all the ſcoffers of his faithfull Miniſters; and contemners of his Goſpell. All this is plainly declared in the 5. Chapter of the Prouerbs of Salomon: where

is ſhewed how the wiſedome of God, euen Jeſus Chriſt the higheſt wiſdome, doth cry aloud all abroad in the world, and manifeſt himſelfe in the open ſtréets: but yet is contemned of wicked worldlings and ſcoffing fooles. Therefore ſaith Chriſt: Becauſe I haue called, and yee

Then ſhall they call vpon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeeke me early, but they ſhall not finde me. Héere then we ſee is terrible wrath and vengeance threatned from heauen, againſt all prophane contemners of Chriſt, and his euerlaſting Goſpell, or any the faithfull publiſhers, and proclaimers thereof. Behold therefore, yée deſpiſers, and wonder: conſider well what will become of you in the end. Dee not thinke, that the moſt iuſt God will alwaies put it vp at your hands, that yée ſhould ſo manifeſtly contemne both his Word, and the moſt zealous Preachers and profeſſors thereof. No, no: aſſure your ſelues hee will bée euen with you at laſt. He will ſmite you both ſidelings and ouerthwart; he will dog you and purſue you with his iudgements and neuer leaue following the

chaſe with you, till he haue deſtroied you, and conſumed you from off the face of the earth. For remember, I pray you, what he ſaith in Deut. If I whet my glittering ſword, and my hand take hold of iudgement, I will execute vengeance on mine enemies, and I wil reward them that hate me; I will make mine arrowes drunke with blood, and my ſword ſhall eat the fleſh of mine aduerſaries.

               No doubt, it is a very great ſinne to deſpiſe the word of God: and I thinke there is none ſo bad that will doe it. For we ought to loue Gods word: God forbid elſe. He that loueth not Gods word, it is pitie he liueth.

               Theſe are but words of courſe. It is an eaſie matter to ſpeake good words. And very many will ſay as you ſay: but both you, and they, in your practiſe doe plainly ſhew that you make no reckoning of it: you eſtéeme it no more then a diſh-clout. I thinke, if the matter were wel tried, you haue ſcant a Bible in your houſe. But though you haue one, it is manifeſt that you ſeldome read therein, with any care or conſcience: and as ſeldome heare the word preached. How elſe could you be ſo ignorant as you are?

               Theol.
               Yes verily. Your continuall negligence, and careleſneſſe, doth argue a plaine contempt. Sure it is, you haue no appetite, nor

ſtomacke to the holy word of God. You had rather do any thing, then either read or meditate in it. It is irkſome vnto you. You read not two Chapters in a wéeke. All holy exerciſes of religion are moſt bitter & tedions vnto you. They are as vineger to your téeth, and ſmoke to your eies. The immoderate loue of this world, and of vanity, hath taken away your appetite from all heauenly things. And where as you ſhift it off with negligence, as though that would excuſe you; the Apoſtle hits you home, when hée ſaith: How ſhal we eſcape, if we neglect ſo greatHeb. 2. 3 ſaluation? Marke that he ſaith: if we neglect.

But as for your fiue wits, they will not ſerue your turne in theſe matters: though you had fiftéene wits. For all the wit, reaſon, and vnderſtanding of naturall men, in Gods matters, is but blindneſſe, and méere fooliſhneſſe. The Apoſtle1. Cor. 3. 19. Rom. 8. 7. ſaith, that the wiſedome of the moſt wiſe in this world, is not onely fooliſhneſſe with God; but indéed very enmitie againſt God. And again, he ſaith, that the naturall man (with al his fiue wits) vnderſtandeth not the things of the Spirit1. Cor. 2. 14. of God; becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. Moſt prudently to this point ſpeaketh Elihu, ſaying: There is a ſpirit in man; but theIob. 32. 2. inſpiration of the Almightie giueth vnderſtanding.

               I call you not foole: but I tel you, what the Scripture ſaith; which calleth all men (though otherwiſe neuer ſo wiſe, politike, and learned) very fooles: till they be truly lightned, and inwardly ſanctified by the Spirit of God; as appeareth, Tit. 3. 3. Where the Apoſtle affirmeth, that both Titus and himſelfe, before they receiued the illuminating Spirit of Gods grace, were very fooles, without wit, and without all ſenſe in Gods matters.

               It may well indéed be called a ſigne of condemnation. For I thinke it more then a ſigne; it is indéed an euident demonſtration of a Reprobate. For I neuer wiſt any man, truly fearing God in his heart, that was an vſuall and a common ſwearer.

cannot be, that the true feare of God, and ordinary ſwearing ſhould dwel togither in one man: ſith ſwearing is a thing forbidden by flat ſtatute. And God addeth a ſore threat to his Law: that hee will not hold him guiltleſſe that taketh his name in vaine; but will moſt ſharpely and ſeuerely puniſh that man.

               Theſe threatnings being ſo great and greeuous, and that from the God of Heauen himſelfe, a man would thinke ſhould cauſe mens hearts to quake and tremble, and make them affraid to rap out ſuch oathes as they do; if they were not altogether hardned, paſt feeling, and paſt grace.
            
            
               Theol.
               True indéed: but yet we ſée, by lamentable experience, how men are giuen ouer both to ſweare, and for ſweare, For at this day

there is no ſinne more common amongſt vs then ſwearing. For many there be which cannot ſpeake ten words, but one ſhall bee an oath. And numbers haue got ſuch a wicked cuſtome of ſwearing that they can by no meanes leaue it: no more then a Black-moore can change his ſkinne, or a Leopard his ſpots. For it is made naturall vnto them, through cuſtome: and they haue got the habit of it. I doe verily thinke, if it were high Treaſon to ſweare, yet ſome could not leaue ſwearing. And ſure I am (as light as we make of it) that it is high Treaſon againſt the crowne of Heauen. Yea, it is a ſinne immediately againſt God: euen againſt his owne perſon. And therfore he hath forbidden it, in the firſt Table of his Lawe.
            
            
               Phila.
               Queſtionleſſe, this vice of ſwearing is of all other ſinnes moſt rife in this Land. For you ſhall heare little boyes and children, in the ſtreets, rap out oathes, in moſt fearfull manner. It would make a mans heart quake, to heare them. Wee may thinke, they haue ſucked them out of their mothers breaſts: but ſure wee are, they haue learned them from the euill example of their parents. And now adayes wee cannot almoſt talke with a man, but (in ordinarie ſpeech) he will belke out one oath or another.
            
            
               
               Theol.
               I will tell you a ſtrange thing; and with great griefe I ſpeake it. I do verily think there are ſworne in this land an hundred thouſand oathes, euery day in the yeare.
            
            
               Phila.
               No doubt, Sir, you are within compaſſe. For now almoſt ſo many men, ſo many oathes; excepting ſome few in compariſon. Nay, I know diuers of mine owne experience, which if they may be kept in talke, will ſweare euery day in the yeare an hundred oathes for their parts.
            
            
               Theol.
               Oh what a lamentable thing is it! We may well take vp the old complaint of the Prophet Ieremie, who ſaith; that in his time the Land did mourne, becauſe of oathes.
                  Iere. 23. 20. And we may wel wonder, that the land ſinketh not becauſe of oathes. For, if God were not a God of infinite patience, how could he endure his moſt ſacred and glorious name to be ſo many thouſand times blaſphemed in one day? and that, by ſuch miſerable wretches as we be.
            
            
               Phila.
               Wee may indeed admire and wonder at the patience and long ſuffering of God, that hee ſpareth vs ſo long, and giueth vs ſo large a time of repentance; but ſure it is that the Prophet ſaith; That, howſoeuer the Lord is ſlow to anger, yet he is great in power, and will not ſurely cleare the wicked. Though heNah. 1. 3. may winke at their monſtrous oathes for a

time, yet he forgetteth them neuer a whit, but ſcoreth them vp, and regiſtreth them in his booke of accounts; ſo as they ſtand in record againſt them. And when the great day of reckoning ſhall come, he will ſet them all in order before them, and lay them to their charge.
               Let not wicked ſwearers and blaſphemers therefore think that they ſhal alwaies ſcape ſcot-free, becauſe God letteth thē alone for a while, and deferreth their puniſhment. For the longer God deferreth, the more terrible will his ſtrokes bee when they come. The longer an arrow is held in the bowe, the ſtronger will bee the ſhot when it commeth foorth. Though God haue leaden feete, and commeth ſlowly to execute wrath, yet hath he an iron hand, and will ſtrike deadly when he commeth. Though God giueth the wicked ſecurity for a time (ſaithIob 24. 23. Iob) yet his eyes are fixed vpon all their waies. And in an other place he ſaith; The wicked is reſerued vnto the day of deſtruction, and they ſhall be brought forth vnto the day of wrath Iob 21. 30. So then the holy man Iob plainely affirmeth, that the ſtate and condition of all the rich and wealthy worldlings is, as the condition of an Oxe that is fatted vp againſt the day of ſlaughter. For in the ſame Chapter hee ſaith; TheyIob. 21. ſpend their daies in wealth, and ſuddenly goe downe to hell. But now I pray you nominate

the oathes which are ſo rife and common amongſt vs.
            
            
               Theol.
               There be ſix oathes, which are (of all other) moſt rife and common, in euery mans mouth; and they be theſe:

                     By my Faith.
                     By my Troth.Six common oathes.
                     
                     By our Lady.
                     By S. Mary.
                     By God.
                     As God ſhall iudge me.
                  
               
               For you cannot lightly talke with a man, but he will fluſh out ſome of theſe, in his ordinary ſpéech.
            
            
               Aſune.
               Doe you count it ſo great a matter, for a man to ſweare by his faith, or his troth?
            
            
               Theol.
               Yes indéed do I. For our faith and our troth are the moſt pretious iewels we haue. Shall we then lay them to gage, for euery word we ſpeake? It ſheweth we are of ſmall credit: nay, very bankrupts. For who but a bankrupt will lay the beſt iewell in his houſe to pledge, for euery ſmall trifle?
            
            
               Aſune.
               I know a man, that will neuer ſweare, but by Cocke or Pie, or Mouſe-foot. I hope you will not ſay they be oathes. For he is as honeſt a man as euer brake bread. You ſhall not heare an oath come out of his mouth.
            
            
               
               Theol.
               I do not thinke, he is ſo honeſt a man as you make him. For it is no ſmall ſinne to ſweare by creatures. The Lord ſaith by his Prophet Ieremie: They haue forſaken me, andIere. 5. 7. ſworne by them that are no Gods. So then to ſweare by creatures, is to forſake God. And I trow you will not ſay, hée is an honeſt man which forſaketh God.
            
            
               Aſune.
               I doe not beleeue that to ſweare by ſmall things is a forſaking of God.
            
            
               Theol.
               You, and ſuch as you are, will beléeue no more of the word of God, then will ſtand with your fantaſie. But whatſoeuer you beléeue, or beléeue not, the word of God ſtandeth ſure: and no iote of it ſhall euer be proued falſe. But this I wil ſay vnto you, becauſe you think it ſo ſmal a matter to ſwear by creatures; that the more baſe and vile the thing is which you ſware by, the greater is the oath: becauſe you aſcribe that vnto a baſe creature, which is onely proper to God: namely to know our hearts, and to be a diſcerner of ſecret things. For whatſoeuer a man ſweareth by, he calleth it as a witneſſe vnto his conſcience, that hée ſpeaketh the truth, and lieth not: which thing onely belongeth vnto God. And therefore in ſwearing by creatures, wée doe rob God of his honour. Therefore to ſweare by the croſſe of the money, or by bread, or a mouſe foot, or

the fire which they call Gods Angell, or any ſuch like, is a robbing of God of his Honour, and an aſcribing of that to the creature, which is proper onely to the Creator.
            
            
               Aſune.
               What ſay you then to them, which ſweare by the Maſſe, and by the Rood?
            
            
               Theol.
               Their ſinne is as great as the other. For it is an hainous thing to ſweare by idoles: as S. Mary, our Ladie, by the Maſſe, by the Rood, &c. The Prophet Amos ſaith: They thatAmos 8. 4 ſweare by the ſinne of Samaria, and that ſay; thy God, O Dan, liueth; euen they ſhall fall, and neuer riſe vp againe. To ſweare by the ſinne of Samaria, is to ſweare by Idols: for Samaria was full of idols.
               Moreouer the Lord threatneth by the Prophet Zephany, that he will cut off them thatZep. 1. 5. ſweare by the Lord, and by Malcham, or by their King. For the idolaters called their idol, Molech, their King.
            
            
               Aſune.
               Seeing you condemne both ſwearing by creatures, and ſwearing by idols, what then muſt we ſweare by? You would haue vs ſweare by nothing, belike.
            
            
               Theo.
               In our ordinary communication wée muſt not ſweare at all, either by one thing or another. But (as our Lord teacheth vs) our communicationMa. 5. 37. muſt be, yea, yea; nay, nay. For whatſoeuer is more then theſe, commeth of euill.
                  
And Saint Iames ſaith: Before all things, myIam. 5. 12. brethren, ſweare not: neither by heauen, nor by earth, nor by any other oath: but let your Yea be yea, and your Nay nay, leſt you fall into condemnation.
               
            
            
               Antile.
               It ſeemeth you are an Anabaptiſt. You condemne all ſwearing; you will haue no ſwearing at all.
            
            
               Theol.
               Not ſo. For though I condemne ſwearing by creatures, ſwearing by idols, and vaine ſwearing; yet doe I allow ſwearing before a Magiſtrate, and priuately alſo, in matters of waight and importance, for the further bolting out of the truth.
               This is warranted from Gods owne mouth, where he ſaith: Thou ſhalt ſweare, The LordIere. 4. liueth, in truth, in iudgement, and in righteouſneſſe. And in theſe caſes onely, the name of God is to be ſworne by; as it is written: ThouDeut. 10. 20. ſhalt feare the Lord thy God, and thou ſhalt ſerue him, and ſhalt cleaue vnto him, and ſhalt ſweare by his name.
               
            
            
               Aſune.
               May wee not ſweare by God in our common talke?
            
            
               Theol.
               At no hand. For that is to take the name of God in vaine: which you know is forbidden.
               And one of the wiſe Heathen could ſay thus: When an oath is laid vpon thee, vndertake it
                  
                  for two cauſes: either to deliuer thy ſelfe from ſome grieuous crime and accuſation, or elſe to preſerue thy friends from danger. So then thatIſocra. ad Demon. Heathen man in common talke, wil not allow any oath, much leſſe, to ſweare by God. Another ſaith: Auoid an oath, though thou ſwearePhocilid. truely. So then wée ſée vaine ſwearing condemned, euen by Heathen.
            
            
               Aſune.
               Yea, but for all that, we muſt ſweare; men will not beleeue vs elſe.
            
            
               Theol.
               Neither yet will they beléeue you any whit the more for your ſwearing. For it doth manifeſtly appeare, that thouſands make no conſcience at all of it. They make no more conſcience of it, then of cracking of nuts: and therefore what wiſe man will beléeue them, though they ſweare neuer ſo much? But, if you would make conſcience alwaies to ſpeake the truth, from your heart, without any oathes at all, you ſhould be better beléeued of all honeſt and wiſe men, then otherwiſe with a thouſand oathes.
            
            
               Antile.
               It is the cuſtome to ſweare.
            
            
               Theol.
               But a wicked and diuelliſh cuſtome.
            
            
               Antile.
               I hope, ſir, we may ſweare, as long as we ſweare truely, and ſweare by nothing but that which is good.
            
            
               Theol.
               It hath béene anſweared before, that in vaine matters you may not ſweare at all.
            
            
               
               Antil.
               As long as we doe no worſe than that, I hope God will hold vs excuſed.
            
            
               Theol.
               God will not hold you excuſed, when you breake his commandements, and continue ſo doing.
            
            
               Antil.
               What ſay you then, to them, that ſweare wounds and blood, and ſuch like, in a brauery, thinking that it ſetteth out their ſpeech very well?
            
            
               Theol.
               Hell gapeth for them. And they ſhall know one day, what it is to blaſpheme God.
            
            
               Antil.
               What may we thinke of ſuch as ſweare by Gods life, Gods ſoule, Gods body, Gods heart?
            
            
               Theol.
               That their cauſe is moſt wofull and dangerous: & I quake at the naming of them. They are moſt horrible, monſtrous and outragious blaſphemies: enough to make the ſtones in the ſtréet to cracke, and the clouds to fall vpon our heads. And we may thinke, that all the Diuels in hell are in a readineſſe, to cary ſuch blaſphemous villaines headlong into that lake, which burneth with fire and brimſtone, for euer.
            
            
               Antil.
               Doe you find in the Scriptures, that God will ſo ſeuerely puniſh ſwearers?
            
            
               Theol.
               Yes verily. For beſides that which hath béene ſpoken before, wée haue diuers other examples: Firſt of Senacherib, the King of

                  Aſhur, who for his outragious blaſphemies againſt the God of heauen, was in moſt fearefull and tragicall manner ſlame by his own ſonnes, Adramelech, and Sharezer: and that, in the1. Kin. 19. 35. Temple, when he was worſhipping his Idoll God, Niſroch. And yet behold a more fearefull example of Gods wrath, againſt blaſphemers.
               Wée reade that an hundred thouſand of the1. Kin. 20. 29. 
                  Aramites were ſlaine, by the Iſraelites, in one day, for blaſpheming of God: And ſeuen and twenty thouſand being left, and flying into the city of Aphek for refuge, were all ſlaine, by the fal of an huge great wall. What ſhould I héere ſpeake how the ſeuen ſonnes of Saul, the King of Iſrael, were hanged vp before the Lord in mount2. Sam. 21. 9. 
                  Gibeah, for the breach of the oath made to the Gibeonites long before? In theſe examples, we may plainly ſée, that the iuſt God, euen in this life, ſometimes will be reuenged of blaſphemers, and oath-breakers. And therefore the very Heathen in all ages haue béene very carefull for the performing of oaths: as Pharaoh King of Egypt willed Ioſeph to goe vp into the land of Canaan, to bury his father, according to his oath made to his father.
            
            
               Phila.
               Me thinketh, theſe ſo terrible, & fearfull examples of Gods vengeance againſt ſwearers, and blaſphemers, ſhould ſtrike ſome terror

into the hearts of our blaſphemers.
            
            
               Theol.
               One would thinke ſo indéed, if any thing could doe it. But alas, they are ſo hardened in it, and in all other ſinne, that nothing can mooue them: except peraduenture there were a Law made, that euery ſwearer and blaſphemer ſhould hold his hand a quarter of an houre in boiling lead. This or ſome ſuch like ſeuere law, might peraduenture curbe them a little, and make them bite in their oaths. But otherwiſe, they will neuer feare any thing, till they be in hell fire, when it will be too late to repent.

               What may be the cauſe of this ſo often, and great ſwearing? for ſurely it is no inherent and in-bred ſinne in our nature, as ſome of the other ſinnes be.
            
            
               Theol.
               No verily. But theſe thrée I iudge to be the cauſe of it:

                     Cuſtome.
                     Want of admonition.
                     Want of puniſhment.

               What then are the remedies for it?

               The remedies are theſe:

                     Diſuſe.
                     Praier.
                     Friendly admonition.
                     Some ſharpe Law.
                  
               
            
            
               Phila.
               Well Sir, now we haue heard enough

of ſwearing, I pray you proceed to the next ſigne of damnation: which is lying.
            
            
               Theol.
               Swearing and lying be of very néere kindred. For he that is a common ſwearer, is for the moſt part a common lier alſo. For hee that maketh no conſcience of ſwearing, will make no conſcience of lying. And as the Lord hateth the one, ſo alſo he hateth the other. And as he puniſheth the one, ſo he will puniſh the other. Therefore Salomon ſaith: Lying lips arePro. 12. 22. Apoc. 22. 15. an abhomination vnto the Lord. Saint Iohn ſaith: Without ſhall be dogges, enchanters, whoore-mongers, murtherers, and whoſoeuer loueth or maketh lies. Againe the ſame holy man of God ſaith: that liers ſhall haue theirApoc. 21. 8. part and portion in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone: which is the ſecond death.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               Theſe ſcriptures, which you alleadge, doe manifeſtly declare that God abhorreth liers, and hath reſerued great torments for them. Therefore the princely Prophet Dauid ſaith, that he would baniſh all liers out of his houſe.Pſa. 101. 7. He that telleth lies (ſaith he) ſhal not remaine in my ſight. A lying tongue is one of the ſixePro. 6. 7. 8. things which God doth hate, and his ſoule abhorre. Yet for al this, we ſee the lamentable experience, how many haue euen taught their tongues to lie (as the Prophet ſaith) and there

                     . 9. is no trueth in their lips. This vice is almoſt as

common as ſwearing. For it is hard to finde a man that will ſpeake the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth from his heart, in ſimplicity and plainneſſe, at all times, in all places, and amongſt all perſons, without all glozing or diſſembling, either for feare, gaine, flattery, men-pleaſing, hiding of faults, or any ſiniſter reſpect whatſoeuer. Where, I ſay, is this man to be found? I would fain ſee him. I would faine looke vpon ſuch a man. It would doe my heart good to behold him. I would reioyce to ſet mine eyes vpon ſuch a man.
            
            
               Theo.
               Such a man, as you ſpeake of, is hardly to be found among the ſonnes of men. They be blacke Swans in the earth, they be white crowes: they be rare birds. For there be very few that will ſpeake the truth from their heart: yet ſome ſuch I hope there be. But, for the moſt part, & amongſt the greater ſort, lying, diſſembling, and fraud, do beare all the ſway. There is no truth, no honeſty, no conſcience, no ſimplicity, no plaine dealing, amongſt men in theſe moſt corrupt times. Faith and truth are parted cleane away. And as the kingly prophet ſaith: The faithfull are failed, from among the childrenPſal. 12. of men. They ſpeake deceitfully euery one with his neighbour; flattering with their lippes, and ſpeake with a double heart. Men now adayes ſtudie the Arte of lying, flattering,

fawning, gloſing and diſſembling: they haue a heart and a heart. They haue hony in their mouth; and gall in their heart. Their tongues are as ſoft as butter and oile: but their hearts are full of bitterneſſe, poiſon and wormwood. They are full of outward courteſie and ciuility, full of court holy water, when there is no truth nor plaineneſſe in their inward affection. They will ſpeake you faire, when they would cut your throats. They will ſhew you a good countenance; when they would eate your heart with garlicke. In outward ſhew, they will carry themſelues plauſibly, when their hearts are full of venome & malice. This viperous brood do but watch their times & opportunities, till they can get a man vpon the hip: and then they will ſting him, & worke their malice vpon him. Theſe fauning curs will not barke till they bite. They will lurke, and lie cloſe, til they ſpie their vantage, and then they wil ſhew themſelues in their kinde: then they will hoiſt a man, and turne him ouer the perke, if they can. Theſe men are like the waters, which are moſt déepe, where they are moſt calme: like a dangerous rocke, hid vnder a calme ſea; or, as the Heathen ſay, like the Syrens ſong, which is the Sailers wrecke; like the Fowlers whiſtle, which is the birds death; like the hid bait, which is the fiſhes bane; like the Harpyes,
                  
which haue virgins faces, and Uultures tallons; or like Hyena, which ſpeaketh like a friend, and deuoureth like a foe; or, as the Scripture ſaith; like Ioab, the captaine of the2. Sam. 20. 10. hoaſt, which ſpake kindly to Amaſa an other Captain, & kiſſed him, when preſently hée ſtabd him; or like vnto the Herodians, and Phariſies ſeruants, which came to our Lord Jeſus with many fawning inſinuations, calling him good maſter, & telling him that he was the plaine truth, that he taught the way of God truely, he regarded no mans perſon, and many good morrows, and all this géere, when as, in very déed, their purpoſe was to intangle him in his words, and to entrap him, that they might catch aduantage againſt him, & ſo cut his throt, & giue him pap with a hatchet. This it is whichPro. 2. 9. 5 the wiſe man ſaith: A man that flattereth hisPro. 26. 23. Pro. 26. 24. neighbour, ſpreadeth a net for his feet. And againe; As ſiluer droſſe, ouerlaid vpon an earthen pot: ſo are fawning lips, and an euill heart. And in another place hée ſaith: Hee that beareth hatred, will counterfait with his lips: but hee laieth vp deceit in his heart. When hee ſhall ſhew his voice fauourably, truſt him not. For their are ſeuen abhominations in his heart. Hee will couer hatred by deceit: but his malice ſhall be diſcouered in the congregation. In another place he pronounceth a curſe vpon

all theſe hollow hearted hypocrites, and meale-mouthed flatterers. For ſaith he; Vnto him that bleſſeth his friend, with a loud voice, betimes in the morning riſing vp earely, a curſePro. 17 14. ſhall be imputed.

               You haue very well deſcribed the conditions of the men of this age, which haue faces, countenances, and tongues, but no harts; which profeſſe lying and diſſembling; which ſay, hee cannot liue, that cannot diſſemble, which haue faire faces, and falſe hearts, which haue forgotten, that plaine honeſty is deepe policy.

               The holy Ghoſt, often in the Prouerbs of Salomon calleth all vnregenerate men fooles: or as it is in the Hebrew, men without hearts. Becauſe they haue no heart to God, no heart to his word, no heart to his children, no heart to godlineſſe, no heart to any thing that good is. They are without an honeſt heart, an vpright heart, a plaine heart. They are all in words, nothing in déeds. They promiſe mountaines, and performe mol-hils. They will ſpeake well of religion, and practiſe nothing. They wil giue faire words to their friends, and doe iuſt nothing for them.

               The world is ful of theſe masked counterfaits: and lying and diſſembling did neuer more abound.
            
            
               Theol.
               It is too true, that lying and diſſembling

are moſt rife, and ouer common vices amongſt all ſorts of men: but eſpecially it doth ouerflow and ſuper abound in ſhop keepers, and ſeruants. For both theſe make a trade and occupation of it, they can do no other but lie. It cleaueth vnto them, as the naile to the doore.
            
            
               Phila.
               I doe certainly know ſome ſhop keepers, which (to vtter their bad wares, & to blind the eyes of the ſimple) doe trade in lying, all the day long, from Sun to Sun; from the opening of the ſhop & windows, to the ſhutting of the ſame. And what is their life (if cuſtomers come in apace) but ſwearing, lying, diſſembling, & deceiuing? they will lie as faſt as a dog will trot, as wee ſay. It is a wonder, that their ſhops and all their wares do not fire ouer their heads, for their ſo common, ſo lewd, & ſo abhominable lying; & that againſt their owne knowledge, againſt their conſcience, againſt God, againſt their neighbour, againſt heauen and earth, men & angels.
            
            
               Theol.
               True it is, we may maruell at the long ſuffering of God in this behalfe. But this is to be noted, that God doth not immediatly puniſh all notorious ſinners in this life: but reſerueth thouſands to the iudgment of the great day. In this life he onely culleth out ſome few, whom hée ſmiteth for the example of others, that they might feare and tremble, and learne by other mens harmes to beware.
               
                  Therefore, euen in this life, we ſée before our eies, ſome liers, ſome drunkards, ſome whoremongers, ſome ſwearers, ſome miſers of the world, ſome ruffians, and cut-throats, ſtriken downe, by the reuenging hand of God. But whereas God ſmiteth one of theſe, in this life, he letteth an hundred eſcape. For if he ſhould puniſh all offenders in this life, to what purpoſe ſhould the iudgement to come ſerue? If he ſhould puniſh none, then we would think there were no God, or that he were ſhut vp idle in heauen, and would doe neither good, nor euill, nor once meddle in the matters of the earth: as ſome Epicures haue dreamed. Therefore, to auoid both theſe extremities, God in his heauenly wiſedome hath thought good to méet with ſome, euen in this world.
            
            
               Phila.
               I am of this minde, that the goods which men get by ſwearing, lying, and deceit, will neuer proſper long.
            
            
               Theol.
               You are not therein deceiued. For God wil blow vpon all ſuch kind of euil gotten goods, and they ſhall put it in a bottomleſſe purſe, as the Prophet ſaith, Hag. 1. 6. The holy Ghoſt, in the booke of the Prouerbs, hath many excellent ſayings to this effect: as chapter 13. The riches of vanity ſhall bee diminiſhed, butPro. 13. hee which laboureth with the hand, ſhall increaſe them. Againe: Hee that dealeth with a

                  deceitfull hand ſhall become poore: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. In another place he ſaith: The deceitfull man roſteth notPro. 18. 27. that which he hath caught in hunting. That is, he ſhal not long inioy or taſte the pray, which he hath gotten by fraud. For either one trouble or other will come vpon him, that he ſhall not be able to poſſeſſe, or take delight in the ſpoile. Therefore it is ſaid: The bread of deceit isPro. 10. 17. ſweet to a man: but afterward his mouth ſhall be filled with grauell. That is, in the end the crafty perſon ſhall méet with many troubles. For either his conſcience will vpbraid him and checke him, or vengeance will plague him, for his deceit. The feares, cares and ſorrowes, which he ſhall haue, ſhall be as it were ſo many ſharpe ſtones, to ſet his téeth on edge, and to vex him. Wherefore, in ſtead of meat, he ſhall féed on grauell: and in ſtéed of wheat, on pebble ſtones. Small pleaſure is taken in the end in goods ill gotten, or liuings vnlawfully come by. For the holy Ghoſt hath paſſed ſentence vpon them, that they ſhall neuer proſper.

               It ſometimes falleth out, that they proſper for a time: but as wee ſay, the third heire ſhall neuer enioy them. For God will curſe them in our poſteritie: and our childrens children ſhall feele the ſmart of our ſins. Therfore the holy man, Iob ſaith: the of-ſpring of

the wicked ſhall not be ſatisfied with bread. ForIob. 27. 14. out of doubt, God will bleſſe that onely, which is got with a good conſcience in the workes of our calling; and it ſhall remaine bleſſed to vs, and our poſterity. Therefore the Spirit ſaith,Pro. 20. 7. The iuſt man that walketh in his vprightneſſe is bleſſed, and bleſſed ſhall his children be after him. But God will not bleſſe, but curſe that, which is got with an euill conſcience; as ſwearing, lying, diſſembling, deceiuing, &c.

               Some ancient writers haue ſpoken very prudently to this point. For one ſaith: Iniuſta lucra breues habent voluptates: longos autem dolores. That is, vniuſt gaine hath long ſorow,Ierom. and ſhort ioy. Another ſaith: Eligas damnum, potiùs quàm turpe lucrum illud: enim ſemel tantùm te dolere afficiet; hoc verò ſemper. That is, chooſeAuguſt. loſſe, rather then filthy lucre. For the one will grieue thée but once; the other, for euer. A third ſaith; Meliùs eſt honeſtè pauperem eſſe, quàm turpiter diuitem. Hoc enim commiſerationem, illud verò reprehenſionem adfert. It is betterBernard. to be honeſtly poore, then wickedly rich. For the one moueth pitie, the other reproofe. One ofEuripid. Pheniſs. the wiſe Heathen alſo ſaith: We may not wax rich vniuſtly; but liue of iuſt thinges; which he calleth holy things.

               Haue we not examples in the Scriptures of ſuch as haue beene puniſhed for lying?
            
            
               
               Theol.
               Yes. For we read how the Gibeonits,
                  Ioſ. 9. 23. for their lying and diſſembling, were made drudges and ſlaues to the Iſraelites. Gehezi alſo2. King. 5 the ſeruant of Eliſha the prophet, for his lying and couetouſneſſe together, was ſmitten with a moſt grieuous leproſie. Ananias and Sapphira
                  Act. 5. 5. his wife, for their lying and diſſembling, were ſtriken downe ſtarke dead, by the immediat hand of God, at the rebuke of Peter.
               
               
                  Zophar one of Iobs friends, ſpeaking of theſe kind of men, ſaith: They ſhall ſucke the gall ofIob. 20. 16. 24. Aſpes, and the Vipers tongue ſhall ſlay them. They ſhall flee from the iron weapons, and a bowe of ſteele ſhall ſtrike them thorow.
               
               Now then by all theſe examples wée may plainely ſee, how greatly God abhorreth lying and diſſembling.
            
            
               Phila.
               Oh therefore that wee could followCol. 3. 9. the counſell of the Apoſtle, who ſaith: Lie not one to another: ſith yee haue put off the old man, with his workes. And againe: CaſtEph. 4. 5. away lying, and ſpeake euery one the truth to his neighbour. The maner of ſpeech which the Apoſtle vſeth is very forcible, implying this much; that we ſhould in a kinde of diſdaine or deteſtation, caſt it away, and throw it from vs, as a filthy, ſtinking and beraied clout, hanging about a mans necke: which hee doth ſuddenly ſnatch away, and hurleth into the

fire; as being aſhamed, that euer it ſhould be ſeen or knowen. Would to God therefore that we were come to ſuch a deteſtation and loathing of lying, that we would euen ſpattle at it, & crie fie vpon it, and all that vſe it! Oh that we could hate it as the diuel, which is the father ofHomer. Iliad. 3. it; & as hel fire, which is the reward of it! Oh that we were come but ſo far as the heathē man, who ſaith; I hate him as the gates of hell, who hath one thing in his tongue & another in his heart!

               Yet for all this we find in the ſcriptures, that euen ſome of the godly haue beene taken tardie in lying, and yet haue not ſinned in ſo doing; as Abraham, Iacob, Rahab, the Midwiues of Egypt; And therefore why may not we doe ſo to.
            
            
               Theol.
               I told you before, that you may not make the infirmities of Gods people, rules for you to liue by. And further I anſwer, that all theſe did offend in their liuing. Some of them indéed, I grant, are commended for their loue to the church & charitable affections to Gods people, but none of them ſimply for lying: which is a thing condemned euē of the heathen. For ſaithEurip. Pheniſſ. one of them: Lying doth corrupt the life of mā: and euery wiſe and godly man doth hate lying.

               No verily: neither is there any good

vantage to be got that way. For when you haue made vp your accounts, all charges deducted, & all expences defraied, your cleare gaines will be very ſmall. For by your wilfull and cuſtomary lying you gain inward griefe, and loſe true ioy; you gaine ſhort pleaſure, and loſe perpetuall glory; you gaine hell, and loſe heauen; you make the diuell your friend, and God your enemy. Now then reckon your gaine.

               You haue ſpoken enough of this vice to cauſe all ſuch to abhorre it and forſake it, as haue any droppe of grace, or ſparke of Gods feare in them: but as for them that are filthy, let them be more filthy. Now I pray you ſpeake your iudgement of the ſeauenth

ſigne of condemnation: which is drunkennes.
            
            
               Theol.
               It is ſo brutiſh and beaſtly a ſinne, that a man would thinke, it ſhould not néed to be ſpoken againſt: but that all reaſonable men ſhould euen abhorre it, & quake to thinke of it. For it is a moſt ſwiniſh thing: it maketh of a man, a beaſt: it taketh away the heart of a man from all goodneſſe, as witneſſeth the Prophet Hoſea, ſaying: Whoredome, wine, and newHoſ. 4 11. wine, take away their heart. For, what heart, what ſtomacke, what appetite can whoremongers and drunkards haue to any thing that is good? either to heare or read the word of God, or to pray or to meditate in the ſame? Alas, they are farre from it, farre from God, and far from all grace and goodneſſe. Therefore the Prophet Ioel ſaith: Awake yee drunkards: weepe andIoel. 1. 5. howle yee drinkers of wine. Yea, the mighty God of heauen doth pronounce a woe againſt them, ſaying: Woe vnto them that riſe vp earlyEſa. 5. 11. to follow drunkenneſſe: and to them that continue vntill night, till the wine doe enflame them. Our Lord Jeſus himſelfe giueth vs a caueat, to take héed of it: Take heed, ſaith he, thatLuke. 22. 24. your hearts be not ouercome with ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe, and the cares of this life: and ſo that day come vpon you vnawares. Thus you heare, how both Chriſt himſelfe, and ſundry of the Prophets, do thunder downe from heauen

againſt this groſſe beaſtlineſſe, which now aboundeth & raigneth amongſt the ſons of men.

               True indeed. But yet almoſt nothing wil make men leaue it: for it is a moſt rife and ouer common vice. We ſee many, that think thēſelues ſome bodies (and as we ſay, no ſmall fools) which yet will be ouertaken with it: and thereby loſe all their credit and reputation with all wiſe men: yea, do proue themſelues to bee but ſwine, and bruit beaſts, as the holy Ghoſt auoucheth, ſaying:Pro. 21. 1. Wine is a mocker & ſtrong drink is raging: Whoſoeuer is deceiued therein, is not wiſe.
            
            
               Theol.
               The wiſe king in the ſame book, doth moſt notably and fully deſcribe vnto vs the inconueniences and miſchiefes, which do accompany drunkenneſſe, and follow drunkards atPro. 23. 29. the héeles. To whom (ſaith he) is wo? to whom is alas? to whom is ſtrife? to whom is babling? to whom are wounds without cauſe? to whom is the redneſſe of the eies? Euen to them, that tary long at the wine: to them, that go and ſeek out mixt wine. In the ſame chapter he ſaith: BePro. 23. 19. not of the number of them, which are bibbers of wine, or of them which glut themſelues with fleſh: for the drinker & the feaſter ſhall become poore: and the ſleeper ſhall bee cloathed with rags. Moreouer he ſaith: Their eies ſhall beholdPro. 23. ſtrange women: and that they ſhalbe like him that lieth in the middeſt of the Sea, and
                  
                  ſleepeth in the top of the Maſt. In all theſe ſpéeches, the holy Ghoſt doth, in moſt liuely maner, deſcribe vnto vs the properties of drunkards: euen their ſtaggering, their réeling, their ſnorting, their ſenſeleſſe ſenſuality. Behold then what be the curſed fruits and euents of drunkenneſſe. Euen theſe which follow: wo, alas, griefe, miſerie, beggerie, pouerty, ſhame, luſts, ſtrife, babling, brauling, fighting, quarelling, ſurfetting, ſickneſſe, diſeaſes, ſwiniſh ſléeping, ſecuritie, and ſenſualitie. So then I conclude, that drunkenneſſe is a vice more beſéeming an hogge, then any reaſonable man. And as one ſaith: It is the Metropolitane Citie of all the Prouince of vices.
               Well therefore ſaith the Heathen writer:Demoſt. Olinth. 
                  When the wine is in, a man is as a running coach without a Coach-man.

There is no man but he hath his faults: and the beſt of vs all may be amended. If neighbours meete together now and then, at the Ale houſe, and play a game at Maw, for a pot of Ale, meaning no hurt: I take it to be good fellowſhip, and a good meanes to increaſe loue amongſt neighbours: and not ſo hainous a thing as you make it.

               I ſée you would fain make faire weather of it; and ſmooth ouer the matter with ſwéete words: as though there were no ſuch great euill in it. But howſoeuer you mince it, and blaunch it ouer, yet the Apoſtle ſaith flatly: That drunkards ſhall not inherite the kingdome1. Cor. 5. of God. I thinke, this one ſentence is enough

to amaze and ſtrike thorow the hearts of all drunkards in the world: For it is as much in effect, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid: All drunkards are notorious Reprobates, and hell-hounds, branded of Sathan, and deuoted to perpetuall deſtruction and damnation.
               But you ſay, you meane no hurt. I anſwer, whatſoeuer you meane, your actions are naught, and your fellowſhip as bad. For what good meaning can you haue? or what good fellowſhip call you it, for poore labouring men, artificers, and ſuch like, to ſit idlely all the day long in Tauernes and Ale-houſes, miſpending their time, and their money in gaming, rioting, ſwearing, ſtaring, ſwilling, bezzeling, bibbing, brauling, and brabling? There is no true fellowſhip in it: it is méere impiety: if we may call it impiety, for poore mèn to liue idlely, diſſolutely, neglecting their callings, while their poore wiues and children ſit crying at home for bread, being ready to ſtarue, to beg or to ſteale. I pray you ſpeake your conſcience, what good fellowſhip is there in this?

               Yet for all that, there be ſome which abſtaine from Ale-houſes, and yet are as bad as any other. For they will backe-bite and ſlaunder their neighbours: they will doe them a ſhrewd turne, as ſoone as any other: they are enuious, they cenſure vs, and diſdaine our

company. Yet we thinke our ſelues as good as they: for all their ſhewes of holineſſe.

               Well Sir you haue waded farre enough in this point: let vs now come to the eighth ſigne of condemnation: which is idleneſſe.
            
            
               Theol.
               Concerning idleneſſe, this I ſay briefely: that it is the mother of all vice, and the ſtepdame of all vertue: yea, it is the very veldame of all enormities: It is the mother of whoredome, the mother of pride, the mother of theft, the mother of drunkenneſſe, the mother of ignorance, the mother of error, the mother of pouerty, the mother of ſlandering and back-biting, pratling, and goſſipping, brawling, ſcolding, quarelling: and what not? Idleneſſe was one of the principall ſinnes of Sodome, as the Prophet Ezechiel teſtifieth, ſaying: pride, fulneſſeEzech. 16. 29. of bread, and abundance of idleneſſe was in her, and in her daughters. Salomon is very plentifull in this matter: For, ſaith he, the ſluggardPro. 13. 4. luſteth and hath nought. And againe: The ſluggard is wiſer in his owne conceit, thenPro. 16. 16. ſeuen men that can giue a ſenſible reaſon. That

is; he taketh himſelfe the wiſeſt of many; becauſe hée ſpareth his body, when others takePro. 24. 33. paines: he ſaith; Yet a little ſleepe, yet a little ſlumber, yet a little folding of the hands: and his pouerty commeth like a traueller; that is vnawares: and his neceſſity like an armed man: that is ſtrongly. Then he foldeth hisEccl. 4. 5. Pro 26. 15. hands together, and eateth his owne fleſh. For, he hideth his hand in his boſome: and it wearieth him to put it to his mouth againe.
               
               In an other place the holy Ghoſt ſaith: The ſlothful man will not plough, becauſe of winter: Therefore he ſhall begge in ſommer, and haue nothing.
               
               Againe: the ſlothfull man is brother to himPro. 16. 8. that is a great waſter.
               
               Moreouer it is ſaid, that the ſluggard turnethPro. 26. 14. himſelfe vpon his bed, as the doore doth vpon the hinges:
               
               That is, he kéepeth his bed, as if he were faſtened to it.
               And, becauſe the Spirit will abound in this point: it is further written of the ſlethfull man that he ſaith; An huge Lyon is in the way: IPro. 26. 11. ſhall be ſlaine in the ſtreets. That is, when any good matter is in hand (as preaching, praying, reading, giuing to the poore, &c.) then hée draweth backe, he ſhrinketh into the ſhell, hée findeth one let or other, one excuſe or other.

Then profit, and pleaſure, buſineſſe, and idleneſſe, matters at home, and matters abroad, company, and a thouſand occaſions will lye in his way, as ſo many Lions, to let and hinder him. So then we ſée, how liuely and plentifully the holy Scriptures doe paint out the lazy lubbers of this world, and ſons of idleneſſe: which are as hardly drawen to any good thing, as a Beare to the ſtake. As for the duties of Religion, they goe as liuely and as cheareful about them, as a théefe goeth vp the ladder, to be executed for his theft.
            
            
               Phila.
               I doe plainely ſee, that this ſinne of Idleneſſe is a very groſſe euill, and the root of many vices: yet for al that, there be a great number which thinke they were borne to liue idlely; as many yong Gentlemen, and ſuch like: which imagine, they came into the world for no other purpoſe, but to hunt and hawke, card, and dice, riot and reuell, and to ſpend their daies in pleaſure and vanity. Againe, there be many lazy lozels, and luskiſh youths, both in Townes and Villages, which doe nothing all the day long, but walke in the ſtreetes, ſit vpon the ſtaules, and frequent Tauernes and Alehouſes. Many rich Citizens, eſpecially women, doe ordinarily lie in bed till nine of the clocke, and then forſooth riſe and make themſelues ready to goe to dinner. And after they

haue well dined they ſpend the reſt of the day, and a good part of the night alſo, in playing, pratling, babbling, cackling, prating and goſſipping. Fie of this idle life. Many prophane ſeruing men alſo doe falſly ſuppoſe, that they were borne onely to game, riot, ſweare, whore, ruffle it, and roiſt it out, and to ſpend their time in meere idleneſſe. But, of all theſe well ſaid theAriſtotle▪
                   Heathen Philoſopher: Illi pariter indignantur & dij & homines, quiſquis otioſus. Both God and man doe hate the idle perſon.
            
            
               Theol.
               It is a lamentable thing to ſée ſo many men and women liue ſo idlely, and ſo vnprofitably as they doe. For alas, there be too many, which fellow no honeſt calling, liue to no vſe, no body is the better for them. They do no good, neither to the Church or Commonwealth. They are like drone bées: they are vnprofitable burthens of the earth. God hath no vſe of them, the Church no good, the Common wealth no benefit, their neighbours no profite, the poore no reliefe. They imagine, they came into the world, to doe nothing but eate, and drinke, and ſléepe and riſe vp to play. They thinke they ſhould ſpend their time in dicing and dauncing, in whoredome and brauery, in gluttony and belly-chéere: in maſting themſelues, like hogs of Epicurus heard: in pampering their paunches, and

cramming their bellies: in fatting themſelues like Boares in a Franke, till they bée well brawned: and (as Iob ſath) till their bones runne full of marrow, their faces ſtrout withIob. 15. Iob. 21. 21. fatneſſe, and they haue collops in their flanke. Oh, what a beaſtly life is this! Fie vpon it, fie vpon it. It is more méete for Epicures, then Chriſtians: for ſwine, then for men: for Sardanapalus, and Heliogabalus, and ſuch like belligods, then for the profeſſors of the Goſpel. But, of all ſuch, Iob ſaith enough; They ſpend theirIob. 21. daies in pleaſure: and ſuddenly goe downe to hell.

               But may it not bee allowed vnto Lords and Ladies, Gentlemen and gentlewomen, and other great ones, to liue idlely, ſith they haue wherewithall to maintaine it?
            
            
               Theol.
               God doth allow none to liue idlely: but all, great and ſmall, are to be imploied one way or other: either for the benefit of the Church, or common wealth: or for the good gouernement of their owne houſholds, or for the good of townes and pariſhes, and thoſe amongſt whom they doe conuerſe: or for the ſuccour and reliefe of the poore: or for the furtherance of the Goſpell, and the maintaining of the Miniſtery: or for one good vſe or other. To theſe ends, our wits, our learning, our reading, our ſkill, our policy, our wealth, our health, our wiſedome,

and authoritie, are to be referred: knowing this; that one day, we ſhall come to giue an account of our Bally-wicke, and to be reckoned withall, for the employment of our Talents. For this cauſe Iob ſaith: that, man is borne toIob. 5. 5. 7. trauell: as the ſparkes flie vpward. And God hath laid this vpon Adam, and al his poſterity:Gen. 3. 
                  In the ſweat of thy browes, thou ſhalt eat thy bread. Some doe ſet downe foure cauſes, why euery man ſhould labour diligently in his calling:
               Firſt, to beare the yoake laid vpon all mankinde, by the Lord.
               Secondly, to get the neceſſaries of this life.
               Thirdly, to liue vnto the profit of humane ſocietie.
               Laſtly, to auoid euill thoughts and actions.
               Saint Paul findeth great fault with ſome in the Church of Theſſalonia, becauſe they walked2 Theſ. 3. inordinately, that is idlely, and out of a lawfull calling: and therefore concluded, that ſuch as would not labour, ſhould not eat. So then we do plainly ſée, that God alloweth idleneſſe in none. For when we are idle (as hath béen ſhewed before) we lie open to the diuell & his temptations: and he getteth within vs and preuaileth againſt vs. While Dauid taried idly

at home in the beginning of the yeare, when kings vſed to goe forth to the battell, he was ſoone ouertaken with thoſe two foule ſinnes of adultery, and man-ſlaughter. So long as Sampſon warred with the Philiſtims, he could neuer be taken or ouercome: but after he gaue himſelfe to idleneſſe and pleaſure, he not only committed fornication with the ſtrumpet Dalilah, but alſo was taken of his enemies, and his eies miſerably pulled out. Theſe examples doe ſhew, what a dangerous ſinne idleneſſe is. Therefore the holy Ghoſt ſends vs to ſchoole, to the little creature, the Ant, to learne of her both to auoid idleneſſe, and alſo to vſe wiſedome and prouidence in our actions. Go to the Piſmire, O ſluggard, behold her wayes, and be wiſe: For ſhee,Pro. 6. 6. hauing no guide, task-maiſter, nor ruler, prepareth her meat in the ſummer, and gathereth her food in harueſt. And in goodſooth it is wonderfull to obſerue, what indeſinent paines, and vnwearied labour, this ſilly creature taketh in ſummer, that ſhée may be well prouided for againſt winter. Let vs therefore learne wiſedome from her example: and let vs ſet before our eyes the looking glaſſe of all creatures. Let vs conſider how the birdes flie, the fiſhes ſwim, the wormes créepe, the heauens turne, the elements mooue, the ſea ebbeth and floweth vnceſſantly: yea the earth it ſelfe, which is the

moſt heauy and vnweldy creature of all other, yet neuer ceaſeth his working, bringing foorth his burden in ſummer, and labouring inwardly all the winter, in concocting and digeſting his nouriſhment for the next ſpring. Thus we ſée, how all creatures are diligently and painfully exerciſed in their kindes. And therefore it is a great ſhame for vs to liue idlely, careleſly, and diſſolutely. Let vs therefore learne (once at laſt) to flie ſlath, and euery one to liue faithfully, diligently, and induſtriouſly in our ſeuerall callings. So ſhall wée both kéepe Sathan at the ſtaues end, and alſo much ſinne out of our ſoules; which otherwiſe idleneſſe wil force in vpon vs.

               I muſt needs confeſſe, that idleneſſe is a groſſe vice in whomſoeuer it is found. But ſpecially, in my iudgement, it is moſt odious in Magiſtrates and Miniſters.
            
            
               Theol.
               That is ſo in truth. For they ought to be the guides, gouernours, ſhepheards, and watchmen ouer the people of God. And therefore for them to neglect their duties and charges, is a moſt horrible thing, ſith it concernethHomer. Iliad. 2. the hurt of many. Therefore well ſaid the Heathen Poet: A magiſtrate, or a Miniſter, may not be lazie and ſlothfull, to whom the nurſing of the people is giuen in charge, and of whom many things are to be cared for.
               
               
                  What a lamentable thing therefore is it, when Magiſtrates are prophane, irreligious, popiſh, vicious, and negligent in the duties of their calling? And how much more lamentable is it, when Miniſters neglect their ſtudies, ſlack preaching, and prayer, and giue vp themſelues, ſome to couetouſneſſe, ſome to pride, ſome to husbandrie, ſome to other worldly affaires, and ſome to ſpend their time idlely in Lauerns, Ale-houſes, gaming, rioting, and lewd company? Would to God therefore that both theſe kind of publike perſons would caſt off idleneſſe and ſlouth; and with diligence, faithfulneſſe, care and conſcience, performe the duties of their places. For it is an excellent thing for any to be a good man in his place: As a good Magiſtrate, that ruleth well, that gouerneth wiſely, which fauoureth good men and good cauſes, and defendeth them: which alſo ſetteth himſelfe againſt bad men and bad cauſes, and puniſheth them ſharpely and ſeuerely: which moreouer maintaineth vertue, euen of a very loue he beareth vnto it in his heart: and puniſheth vice of a very zeale and hatred againſt it: and not for his credit only or to pleaſe ſome, or becauſe he muſt needs doe it, and can doe no leſſe, or for any ſuch ſiniſter reſpect: but euen of a loue to God, a care of his glory, a conſcience of dutie, and a feruent zeale againſt

ſinne. So likewiſe, it is a notable thing for a Miniſter to be a good man in his place; to bée ſtudious in the law of God, diligent and painfull in preaching; and that of a loue to God▪ a zeale of his glorie, déepe pity and compaſſion toward the ſoules of the people, ſéeking by all meanes poſſible to winne them vnto God▪ carrying himſelfe in all his actions amongſt them, wiſely, religiouſly, vnblameably, and in offenſiuely.
               So againe, it is a worthy thing to be a good rich man which doth much good with this riches, which kéepeth a good houſe, relieueth the poore, miniſtreth to the neceſſity of the Saints, and giueth chéerefully, and with diſcretion, where néed is.
               So alſo, it is a commendable thing to be a good neighbour, or a good Towneſ▪ man▪ by whom a man may liue quietly, peaceably, ioyfully, and comfortably.
               And laſtly, to be a good poore man: that is, humble, lowly, duetifull, painefull, ready to helpe, and ready to pleaſe. Oh, I ſay, this is a moſt excellent and glorions thing, when euery man kéepeth his ſtanding, his range, and his ranke: when all men, with care and conſcience performe the duties of their places: when the huſband doth the duty of an huſband, and the wife of a wife: when the father doth the duety

of a Father, and the child of a child: when the Maſter doth the duty of a Maſter, and the ſeruantof a ſeruant: when euery man ſetteth God before his eies, in doing thoſe things, which eſpecially belong vnto him. For héerein conſiſteth the honor of God, the glory of the Prince, the crowne of the Church, the fortreſſe of the Common-wealth, the ſafety of Cities, the ſtrength of kingdomes, and the very preſeruation of all things.

               You haue ſaid well in ſome things. But yet I doe not ſee, but that rich men and women may liue idlely; ſith they haue enough, where withall to maintaine it. For may not a man doe with his owne what he liſt?
            
            
               Theol.
               No verily. For you may not take your owne knife, and cut your owne throat with it: neither may you take your owne are, and kill your owne childe with it. Therefore that reaſon is naught. Albeit therefore wealthy men & women haue great plenty of all things, ſo as they néed not to labour; yet let them bée profitably emploied, ſome other way. Let them exerciſe themſelues in one good thing or other. If they can finde nothing to doe, let them giue themſelues much to priuate praiers, and reading of the ſcriptures, that they may be able to inſtruct and exhort others. Or elſe let Ladies and Gentlewomen doe, as that good woman

                  Dorcas did: that is, buy cloth, cut it out, work it, ſewe it, make ſhirtes, ſmockes, coates, and garments, and giue them to the poore, whenActs 9. 36. 39. they haue ſo done. For it is ſaid of Dorcas, that ſhee was a woman full of good workes and almes-deeds, which ſhee did. She was a mercifull and tender hearted woman, ſhe was the poore mans friend, ſhe clothed the poore and naked, ſhée knew it was a ſacrifice acceptable to God. Oh, that the wealthy women of our land would follow the example of Dorcas. But alas, theſe daies bring foorth few Dorcaſſes:

               Theol.
               It is ſo infinite a matter, that I know not where to begin, or where to make an end of it. It is a bottomleſſe ſinke of moſt grieuous enormities. I ſhall enter into a Labyrinth, where I ſhall not know now to get out againe. But ſith you are deſirous to heare ſomething of it, this I ſay, that it is a moſt cruell monſter, a bloody vice, a moſt vgly and hidious fiend of hell. The Scriptures in very many places, do cry out vpon it, arraigning it, adiudging it, and condemning it downe to hell. They doe alſo thunder and lighten vpon all thoſe, which are ſtained and corrupted with this vice; calling them by ſuch names and giuing them ſuch titles, as are taken from the effects of this ſinne, and moſt fit for oppreſſours: as namely, that they grinde the faces of the poore; that theyEſa. 3. 15. Amos. 8. 6 Mic. 3. 2. Pſal. 14. 4. plucke off their ſkinnes from them, and their fleſh from their bones; that they eate them vp, as they eate bread. Theſe are they; which ſtriue to deuoure all (like ſauage beaſts) & to get the whole earth into their hands, either by hooke or by crooke, by right or by wrong, by oppreſſion, fraud, and violence. Theſe Caterpillers, and Cormorants of the earth, are like vnto the Whale-fiſh, which ſwalloweth vp

quick other little fiſhes. They are like the Lion, that deuoureth other beaſts. They are like the Falcon, which ſeizeth, plumeth, and prayeth vpon other fowles. Theſe gréedy Wolues deuoure all, and ſwallow vp the poore of the Land. Therfore the Prophets of God do thunder out many great woes againſt them.
               Firſt, the Prophet Eſay ſaith; Wo vnto themEſay 5. 8. that ioine houſe to houſe, and field to field; till there be no place for the poore to dwell in; that they may be placed by themſelues, in the middeſt of the earth.
               
               Secondly, the Prophet Ieremy ſaith; WoeIere. 22. 13. vnto him that buildeth his houſe by vnrighteouſneſſe, and his chambers without equity.
               
               Thirdly, the Prophet Micah ſaith: Wo vntoMic. 2. 2. them that couet fields, and take them by violence; and ſo oppreſſe a man and his houſe, euen a man and his heritage.
               
               Fourthly, the Prophet Abacuc crieth outAbac. 2. 12. ſaying; Woe vnto him that buildeth a Towne with bloud, and erecteth a City by iniquity. S. Iames alſo moſt terribly threatneth theſe kindIam. 5. 1. 2. of men, ſaying: Goe to now you rich men, weepe and howle for your miſeries that ſhall come vpon you. Your gold and ſiluer is cankered: and the ruſt of them ſhall bee a witneſſe againſt you; and ſhall eat your fleſh, as it were fire.
               
               
                  Laſtly, S. Paul ſaith flatly, that extortioners1. Cor. 6. 10. ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God. Thus we ſée, how many fearefull woes and threats are denounced from heauen againſt theſe peſtilent cut-throats of the earth.

               And all little enough. For they are ſteeped in their ſinne, and the ſtaine of it is ſo ſoked into them, as it will hardly euer be waſhed out. True it is, that you ſaid, that theſe cruell oppreſſing bloud-ſuckers are the moſt pernicious and peſtilent vermine, that creepeth vpon the face of the earth; and yet I thinke there were neuer moe of them, then in theſe daies. For now the wicked world is full of ſuch, as doe ſundry waies bite, pinch, and nip the poore, as we ſee by euery daies lamentable experience; but you can ſpeake more of it then I. Therefore, I pray you, lay open the ſundry kinds of oppreſſion, vſed in theſe daies.

                  There is oppreſſion, by vſury.
                  Oppreſſion, by bribery.The ſundrie kinds of oppreſſions.
                  
                  Oppreſſion, by racking of rents.
                  Oppreſſion, by taking exceſſiue fines.

               In truth, this is a moſt cruell and oppreſſing age, wherein we liue; yea, a very iron age. It ſeemeth, that the great ones minde nothing elſe, they are altogether ſet vpon oppreſſion, they dote and dreame of it, they finde ſweet in it, and therefore they are mad of it. AsEccl. 7. 5. Salomon ſaith; Oppreſſion maketh a wiſeman mad. It ſeemeth therefore, that this vice is of ſuch maruellous force, that it can bereaue men of their wits, and make men ſtarke mad of getting goods by hooke or by crooke, they care not how, nor from whom; ſo they haue it. Yet,

no doubt, the moſt wiſe God hath enacted many good lawes for the ſuppreſſing of this euill: and doth threaten the execution of them in his owne perſon: and eſpecially his Law doth prouide for the ſafetie of the poore, the fatherleſſe, the widow and the ſtranger. But you M. Theologus, can repeat the ſtatutes better then I; becauſe you are a profeſſed Diuine. Therefore, I pray you, let vs heare them from you.
            
            
               Theol.
               In the 22. Chapter of Exodus, God made this law following: You ſhall not trouble any widow or fatherleſſe childe; if thouExo. 22. vex or trouble ſuch, and ſo hee call and crie vnto me, I will ſurely heare his crie. Then ſhall my wrath be kindled, and I will kill you with the ſword, and your wiues ſhall be widowes, and your children fatherleſſe. Againe, he ſaith: Thou ſhalt not oppreſſe an hired ſeruant, that isDeut. 22. needy and poore; but thou ſhalt giue him his hire for his day: neither ſhall the Sunne goe downe vpon it (for he is poore, and therewith ſuſtaineth his life,) leſt hee crie againſt thee vnto the Lord, and it be ſinne vnto thee. Moreouer, the Lord ſaith: Thou ſhalt doe no iniuryExod. 22. to a ſtranger: for yee were ſtrangers in the land of Egypt. And God himſelfe threatneth thatMal. 3. he will be a ſwift witneſſe againſt thoſe which kéepe backe the hirelinges wages, and vex the widow, and the fatherleſſe. The

Apoſtle ſaith: Let no man oppreſſe or defraud1. Theſ. 4. 6. his brother, in any matters. For the Lord is an auenger of all ſuch things. Salomon alſo ſaith: If in a country thou feeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iuſtice and iudgement, be not aſtonied at the matter: for hee that is higher then the higheſt regardeth: and there be higher then they. Eccleſ.
                   5. 7. All theſe holy ſtatutes and lawes, enacted and prouided againſt oppreſſors, doe plainely ſhew what care the Lord hath for his poore, diſtreſſed, and deſolate people.

               But theſe oppreſſing hel-hounds are ſuch as care for nothing. No Law of the Almighty can bridle them: nothing can feare them: nothing can reſtraine them. They haue made a couenant with Hell and death. They are frozen in the dregs; they are paſt feeling. And as Iob ſaith: Theſe are they, that abhorreIob. 14. 13. the light, they know not the waies thereof, neither continue in the pathes thereof. Their hearts are as hard as the Adamant. Nothing can mooue them: nothing can worke vpon them. There is great crying out euery where of the ſtone in the reines, which indeed is a great torment to the bodie (but there is no complaining of the ſtone in the heart. I meane a ſtonie heart: which is the ſoreſt diſeaſe that poſſibly can fall into the ſoule of man) and yet

in theſe times it groweth very rife. For mens hearts are as hard as braſſe, and as the neather Milſtone: as the Scripture ſpeaketh. For many, eſpecially of theſe vnmercifull and oppreſſingZeph. 1. 12. Amos 6. 3. 6. tyrants, ſay in their hearts; God will do neither good nor euill. Therefore they put the euil day far from them, and approch vnto the ſeat of iniquity. They are at eaſe in Zion; they lie vpon beds of Iuory, and ſtretch themſelues vpon their beds; and eat the lambes of the flocke, and the calues out of the ſtall. They ſing to the ſound of the viall; they inuent inſtruments of muſicke, like Dauid. They drink wine in bowles, and no man is ſory for the affliction of Ioſeph; that is, the troubles of Gods people. The Prophet Eſay alſoEſa. 5. 12. Pſal. 10. 14. 6. complaineth of theſe kind of men, ſaying; They regard not the work of the Lord, neither conſider the work of his hands. And another Prophet ſaith; they ſay in their harts God hath forgotten; he hideth away his face, and will neuer ſee. They are ſo proud, that they ſeeke not for God. They think alwaies, there is no God; his iudgements are far out of their ſight. Their waies alwaies proſper; and therefore they ſay in their hearts; Tuſh we ſhall neuer be moued, nor come in danger.
            
            
               Theol.
               You haue ſpoken very well, touching the ſtéelineſſe and hardnes of theſe mens harts, who are ſo vnmerciful to their poor neighbors, that almoſt none can liue by them. They do ſo

diſturbe & diſquiet al things, that poore men can dwell in no reſt by them. Therefore truly ſaith the wiſe king: A mightie man moleſteth all, &Pro. 18. 2. both hireth the foole, & hireth thoſe that paſſe by. But the poore man ſpeaketh with prayers: that is, by the way of entreatie and ſupplications. For the poore are afraid of them. They quake when they ſée them: as the beaſts quake, at the roaring of the Lion. Many poore Farmers, poore Huſband men, poore Heards, poore Labourers, poore widowes, and hirelings, doe quake and tremble, when theſe gréedy wolues come abroad. And (as Iob ſpeaketh) the pooreIob. 24. 4. of the earth hide themſelues together. For (alas) in their hearts, they cannot abide the ſight of them: they had as léeue méet the diuell as méet them, for feare of one diſpleaſure or another. For either they feare that they wil warne them out of their houſes, or parley about more rent and ſtraighter couenants, or beg away their beſt kine, or borow their horſes, or command their carts, or require a wéeks worke of them, & neuer pay them for it, or a twelue moneths paſture for a couple of Geldings, or that they wil make one quarel or another vnto thē, or one miſchiefe or another. Se that theſe poore ſoules cannot tel what to do, nor which way to turn them, for feare of theſe cruel termagants. They are euen weary of their liues. For they

haue no remedie for theſe things, but euen to beare it off with head and ſhoulders. Therefore they often with they were out of the world, and that they were buried quicke. They ſay, if any will knocke them on the head, they will forgiue him. O moſt pittious caſe! O lamentable hearing! Theſe poore ſilly creatures are faine to drudge and moile all the yere long, in winter & ſummer, in froſt & ſnow, in heat & cold, to prouide their rents, that they may be able to pay their cruell Land-lord at his day: For elſe, how ſhall they be able to looke him in the face? Yet their rent is ſo rackt, that all that they can do is little enough to pay it. And when that is paid, (alas) the poore man, & his wife, & children haue little left to take to, or to maintaine themſelues withal: they are faine to gnaw of a cruſt, to fare hardly, & go thinly clad. Sometimes they haue victuals, and ſometimes none. The poore children cry for bread. Poore widowes alſo, & poore fatherleſſe children, are found wéeping & mourning in their houſes, and in their ſtréets. So that now we may with Salomon, turne and conſiderEccle. 4. 1. all the oppreſſions, that are wrought vnder the Sun. Wée may behold the téeres of the oppreſſed, and none comforteth them. For the mighty ones do wrong the weaker: euen as the ſtrongen beaſts do puſh and harme the féebler. Theſe griping oppreſſors do pinch the poore euen to the

quicke. They plucke away from the fatherleſſe and widowes, that little which they haue. If there be but a cowe, or a few ſheepe left, they will haue them. If there be a little commodity of houſe or land, oh what deuiſes they haue to wind it in, & to wring it away! Theſe tyrants will go as nigh, as the bed they lie vpon. They know well inough, the poore men are not able to wage law with them: and therfore they may do what wrong they will, & ſhew what cruelty they liſt. Hence commeth the téeres of the oppreſſed; hence commeth the wéeping & wailing of the poore. But alas (poore ſoules) they may wel wéep, to eaſe their hearts a little; but there is none to comfort them: remedy they can haue none. But yet aſſuredly the euerlaſting God doth looke vpon them, & will be reuenged. For the cries of the poore, the fatherles, and the widowes, haue entred into the cares of the Lord of Hoſts, who is an auenger of all ſuch things; yea a ſtrong reuenger, as Salomon ſaith: EnterPro. 23. 14. not into the field of the fatherleſſe: for their reuenger is ſtrong. He himſelfe will plead their cauſe againſt thee. And againe he ſaith: RobPro. 22. 2. not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: neither tread downe the afflicted in the gate: for the Lord pleadeth their cauſe: and will ſpoile their ſoule that ſpoile them. We ſée then, that the moſt iuſt God wil be reuenged on theſe vnmercifull

tyrants. He will not alwaies put vp theſe wrongs and iniuries, done to the poore.
               In the eight chapter of the Prophet Amos, hee ſweareth by the excellency of Iacob, that hee will neuer forget any of their workes. And againe, he ſaith by his Prophet Ieremie; Shall I not be auenged, on ſuch a Nation as this? Surely he will ſet his face againſt them to root them out of the earth. For indéed they are not worthy to crawle vpon the face of the earth, or to draw breath amongſt the ſonnes of men. It is written in the booke of Pſalmes; that God will ſet their fellowes oppoſite againſt him, as a Butte to ſhoot at: that he will put them apart:Pſal. 21. 13. and the ſtrings of his bow ſhall he make ready againſt their faces. Be aſtoniſhed at this, O ye heauens; and tremble, O thou earth. Heare this, O ye cruell land-lords, vnmercifull oppreſſors, and blood-ſuckers of the earth. You may well be called blood-ſuckers: for you ſuck the bloud of many poore men, women & children: you eat it, you drinke it, you haue it ſerued in at your ſumptuous tables euery day, you ſwallow it vp, and liue by it. And (as Iob ſaith) The wildernes giueth you and your children food. That is, youIob. 24. 5. liue by robbing, and murthering. But wo, wo, vnto you that euer you were born. For the blood of the oppreſſed, which you haue eaten & drunken, ſhall one day cry for ſpéedy vengeance, againſt

you: as the blood of Abel cried againſt Cain. Their blood ſhall witneſſe againſt you, in the day of iudgment; and the téeres of many poore ſtarued children, orphans, & widowes ſhall cry out againſt you. Was the Lord reuenged of Achab, for his cruell and vninſt dealing1. Reg. 21. with poore Naboth, and ſhall he not be reuenged of you? Did the dogs lap the blood of Achab, and ſhall you eſcape? No, no: you ſhall not eſcape. The Lord will be a ſwift witneſſe againſt you; as he ſaith in Malachie. Was theMal. 3. Lord angry with the rich of his people, for oppreſſing the poore (ſo as the cry of the people and of their wiues, againſt their oppreſſors, wasNeh. 5. heard of the Almighty) & do you think, you ſhal eſcape ſcot-frée? Doth not the like cauſe, bring foorth the like effect? the like ſinne, the like puniſhment? know therefore for a certainty, that the Lord hath coffers full of vengeance againſt you, and one day he will vnlocke them, and bring them forth, in the ſight of all men.
               Know alſo, that the timber of your houſes, and the ſtones of your walles, which you haue built by oppreſſion and blood, ſhall crie againſt you in the day of the Lords wrath, as the Prophet Abacuck telleth you. The ſtone (ſaith he)Abac. 2. 11.

The one ſide ſingeth, behold blood: the other, behold murder. The one ſide, behold deceit: the other, behold cruelty. The one, behold pilling & poling: the other, behold couetouſneſſe. The one, behold robbery: the other, behold penury. And thus you ſée how the ſtones and timber of your houſes ſhall deſcant vpon you. And howſeeuer you put on your brazen brows, & harden your hearts againſt theſe threatnings of the moſt terrible God and Lord of hoſts: yet one day, you ſhall (ſpite of your hearts) will ye nill ye, be brought forth vnto iudgement: you ſhall once come to your reckoning, you ſhall at laſt be apprehended, conuented, and arraigned at the bar of Gods tribunall ſeat before the great Judge of all the world. Then ſentence ſhall paſſe againſt you: euen that moſt dreadfullMat. 25. ſentence: Goe ye curſed into hell-fire, there to bee tormented with the Diuell and his Angels for euer. O then, woe, woe vnto you. For,Mat. 16. what ſhall it profit a man to winne the whole world, and loſe his owne ſoule? ſaith our Lord Jeſus. Surely euen as much, as if one ſhould winne a farthing, and loſe an hundered thouſand pound. For, if hée ſhall be caſt into Hellfire,Mat. 25. which hath not giuen of his owne goods

righteouſly gotten, as our Sauiour auoucheth; where then ſhall hée be caſt, that hath ſtollen other mens goods? And if he ſhal be damned that hath not clothed the naked, what ſhall become of him that hath made naked them that were clothed? Oh, therefore repent in time, O ye cruell oppreſſors; ſéeke the Lord whileſt he may be found; call vpon him while he is néere; lay aſide your ſauage cruelty, viſit the fatherleſſe and widow, in their diſtreſſe; deale your bread to the hungry; helpe them to their right which ſuffer wrong; deale mercifully with your tenants; racke not your rents any more; pinch not the poore ſoules, for whom Chriſt died; pittie them, I ſay, but pinch them not; deale kindly & friendly with them; remember your great accounts; conſider the ſhortneſſe of your daies, and the vanitie of your life; rent your hearts, and not your clothes. Turne vnto the Lord, with all your heart, with wéeping, faſting, and mourning; preuent Gods wrath with a ſacrifice of téeres; pacifie his anger with the calues of your lips, and with a contrite ſpirit; be gréeued for that which is paſt, and amend that which is to come; ſtand it out no more at the ſwords point againſt God. For it will not boot you to ſtriue; he is too ſtrong for you. Your only wiſdom is, to come in. Come in therfore, come in, ye rebellious generation; ſubmit your ſelues

to the great King, humble your ſelues vnder his mighty hand: caſt downe your ſwords and targets: yéeld vnto your God. So ſhall you eſcape the vengeance to come; ſo ſhall God accept you, haue mercy vpon you, receiue you to fauor, grant you a generall pardon for all your rebellions, and admit you into the number of his faithfull and loyall ſubiects.

               I doe conceiue by diuers ſpeeches which you haue alledged, that goods gotten by oppreſſion and cruelty, will neuer proſper long. For oppreſſors coine their mony vpon their neighbours skins. How then can it be bleſſed?

For, as it hath béen ſhewed before, that thoſe goods which are gotten by ſwearing and lying are curſed: ſo all theſe that are gotten by oppreſſion and violence are more curſed. Therefore the Lord ſaith by his Prophet Ieremie: as the Partrich gatherethIere. 17. 11. the yong which ſhee hath not brought foorth, ſo he that gathereth riches, and not by right, ſhall leaue them in the midſt of his daies: and at his end ſhall bee a foole, and his name ſhall be written in the earth.

               I maruell much, with what face theſe cruell oppreſſors can come before God in his holy Temple, to pray, and offer vp their ſacrifices vnto him. For we ſee, many of them though they haue ſuch foule hands, and foule hearts, as wee haue heard; yet for all that, will

moſt impudently preſume to come to the church and pray; or at leaſt, when they are laide in their beds a nights, and halfe aſleepe, then wil they tumble ouer their praiers, or be pattering ſome Pater noſters.
            
            
               Theol.
               Alas, alas, poore ſoules: all that they do in matters of Gods worſhip, is but hypocriſie & diſſimulation. For in truth, they care not for God: they loue him but from the téeth outward: their mouths are with him, but their heart goeth after couetouſneſſe, and their hands are full of blood. And therefore God doth both abhorre them, and their prayers. For ſaith he; Though they ſtretch out their hands, yet will IEſa. 1. 15. hide mine eyes from them; and though they make many prayers, yet will I not heare them. For their hands are full of blood.

                  God heareth not ſinners: that is, stubburne and careleſſe ſinners. So then we may cléerely ſée (by all theſe teſtimonies of holy writ) what account God maketh of the praiers of oppreſſors, and all other prophane & vngodly men: namely, that hée doth hate them, and abhorre them, as moſt loathſome and odious in his ſight.

               The remedies are theſe:

                     A good conſcience.

               Phila.
               Now ſir, as you haue at large vttered your mind, concerning theſe groſſe corruptions of the world, and haue plainely and euidently proued them to be the deadly poiſon of the ſoule; ſo alſo I pray you ſatisfie vs in this: whether they be not hurtfull alſo to the body, goods, and name.
            
            
               Theol.
               I haue dwelt the longer in theſe common vices of the world, becauſe almoſt all ſorts of men are ſtained with one or other of them: and therefore they can neuer be enough ſpoken againſt. For the whole world lieth in them, as S. Iohn teſtifieth. If men therefore could be recouered1. Iohn. 5. of theſe diſeaſes, no doubt there would

be a ready paſſage made for the abundance of grace; and wée ſhould haue a moſt flouriſhing Church and Common-wealth; but as long as theſe doe lie in the way, there is ſmall hope of greater mercies and bleſſings to be powred vpon vs; or that euer we ſhall come to haue an inward conuerſation with God. For theſe vices blinde our eies, burden our hearts, and (as the Prophet Ieremy ſaith) hinder many things fromIer. 5. 25. vs. But touching your petition, I muſt néeds grant; that, as theſe vices are the very bane of the ſoule, and moſt certaine ſignes of condemnation; ſo are they very dangerous to the body, goods & name; yea, and to the whole land, both Church and Common-wealth.
            
            
               Phila.
               Shew vs out of the Scriptures what danger they bring to the body.
            
            
               Theol.
               The Lord our God ſaith, that if wée will not obey him, nor kéepe his commandements (but break his couenant) he will appoint ouer vs haſtie plagues, conſumptions, and the burning ague, to conſume the eies, and to make the heart heauy. So alſo he ſaith, that if we willLeui. 26. 16. Deut. 28. 21. not obey his voice, to obſerue all his commandements and ordinances, that then he wil make the peſtilence cleaue vnto vs, vntill hée haue conſumed vs; that hée will ſmite vs with the Feauer, with the botch of Egypt, with the Emeroids, with the Scabbe, and with the Itch;

that alſo he will ſmite vs with madneſſe, and with blindnes, and with aſtoniſhment of heart. So then you ſee what great euils the Lord threatneth to inflict vpon our bodies in this life, for theſe and ſuch like ſinnes. But on the centrary, the holy ghoſt ſaith: Feare God, and departPro. 3. 7. from euill: ſo health ſhall be vnto thy nauell, and moiſture vnto thy bones.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               What euill doe theſe forenamed ſins bring vpon vs, in our goods and outward eſtate?
            
            
               Theol.
               They cauſe God to curſe vs in all that we ſet hand vnto, as plentifully appeareth in the forenamed Chapters; where the Lord ſaith thus: If thou wilt not obey the commandementsDeut. 28. of the Lord thy God, curſed ſhalt thou bee in the towne, curſed alſo in the field, curſed ſhall be thy basket and thy ſtore, curſed ſhall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, and the increaſe of thy kine, and the flockes of thy ſheepe. Curſed ſhalt thou bee when thou commeſt in, and curſed alſo when thou goeſt out. The Lord ſhall ſend vpon thee curſing, trouble, and ſhame, in all that thou ſetteſt thy hand vnto. And further he ſaith: That hee will breake the ſtaffe of their bread: that ten women ſhall bake their bread in one ouen,Deut. 28. and they ſhall deliuer their bread againe by waight: and they ſhall eat and not be ſatisfied.
                  
You do therefore apparantly ſée, that theſe ſins will draw downe Gods wrath vpon vs, and al that we haue.
            
            
               Phila.
               What hurt doe theſe ſinnes to our good name?
            
            
               Theol.
               They bring reproch, ſhame, & infamy vpon vs, and cauſe vs to be abhorred and contemned of all good men. They doe vtterly blot out our good name. For as vertue maketh men honorable and reuerend; ſo vice maketh men vile & contemptible. This is ſet downe, where the Lord threatneth Iſrael; that for their ſinnes2. Kin. 9. 7. and diſobedience, he will make them a prouerbe & common talke; yea, a reproach, & aſtoniſhment amongſt all people. In ſundry other places of the Prophets, he threatneth for their ſinnes, to make them a reproach, a ſhame, andEze. 5. 5. hiſſing, and nodding of the head to all Nations.
            
            
               Phila.
               I doe verily thus thinke: that as ſinne generally doth ſtaine euery mans good name, which all are charie and tender of: ſo eſpecially, it doth blot thoſe which are in high places, and of ſpeciall note, for learning, wiſedome, and godlineſſe.
            
            
               Theol.
               You haue ſpoken moſt truely, and agréeable to the Scriptures. For the Scripture ſaith: As a dead flie cauſeth the Apothecaries ointment to ſtinke: ſo doth a little follie, him that is in eſtimation, for wiſedome & for honor.
                  
Where Salomon ſheweth, that if a flie get into the Apothecaries box of ointment, and die, and putrifie in it, ſhe marreth it, though it be neuer ſo pretious. Euen ſo, if a little ſinne get into the heart, and breake out into the forhead of a man of great fame for ſome ſingular gifts, it will blurre him, though he be neuer ſo excellent.
            
            
               Phila.
               Shew this, I pray you, more plainly.
            
            
               Theol.
               Wée obſerue this, in all experience: that if a Noble man be a good man, and haue many excellent parts in him of courteſie, patience, humility, and loue of Religion: yet if hée be couetous, the common people will haue their eye altogether vpon that: and they will ſay; Such a Noble man, is a very good man, but for one thing: hée is excéeding couetous, oppreſſeth poore men, & dealeth hardly with his tenants, kéepeth no houſe, doth little good in the country where he dwelleth. And this is it that marreth all.
               Moreouer, let a Judge, a Juſtice, or a Magiſtrate, bée endued with excellent gifts of prudence, policie, temperance, liberality, & knowledge in the law: yet, if they be giuen to anger, or taking of bribes, oh, how it will grieue them amongſt the people! For they will ſay: Hée is a worthy man indéed, but there is one thing in him that marreth all: he is an exceding angry and furious man; he is as angry as a waſpe: he

will be in a pelting chafe for euery trifle: hée will fret and fume, if you doe but blow vpon hun. And beſides this, he is a very corrupt man: hée is a great taker of bribes, hée loueth well to bée bribed: hée will doe any thing for bribes.
               Furthermore, if any Preacher be a man of great gifts, the common people will ſay of him: Oh, hée is a worthy man indéed, an excellent Scholar, a profound Diuine, a ſingular man in a Pulpit: but yet, for all that, hée hath a ſhrewd touch which marreth all; he is an excéeding proud man: hée is as proud as Lucifer. He hath very great gifts indéed, but I warrant you hée knoweth it well enough. For hée carrieth his creſt very high, and looketh very ſternely, and diſdainefully vpon all other men. Hée is vnmeaſurably puft vp with ouerwéening, and thinketh that he toucheth the clouds with his head. Thus therefore we ſée, how the dead flies marre all: and how ſome one ſinne doth diſgrace a man, that otherwiſe doth excell.
            
            
               Phila.
               What is the cauſe, why ſome one ſinne doth ſo blot and ſmut the moſt excellent men?
            
            
               Theol.
               The reaſon héereof is, becauſe ſuch men are as a candle, ſet vpon a candle-ſticke, or rather vpon a ſcaffold or mountaine, for all

men to behold and looke vpon. And ſure it is, they haue a thouſand eies vpon them euery day; and that not onely gazing vpon them, but alſo prying very narrowly into them, to ſpie out the leaſt moat, that they may make a mountaine of it. For, as in a cleane white paper, one little ſpot is ſoone eſpied; but in a péece of browne paper, twenty great blurs are ſcant diſcerned: euen ſo in Noble men, Judges, Magiſtrates, Juſtices, Preachers, and Profeſſors, the leaſt ſpot or ſpecke is ſoone ſeene into; but amongſt the baſer ſort, and moſt groſſe liuers, almoſt nothing is eſpied or regarded.
            
            
               Phila.
               Sith the eies of all men are bent and fixed vpon ſuch men as are of ſome note, therefore they had neede verie heedfully to looke to their ſteps, that they may take away all aduantage from them that ſeeke aduantage.
            
            
               Theol.
               Yes verily. And furthermore, they had néed to pray with Dauid alwaies: DirectPſal. 119. 133. my ſteps O Lord in thy word: and let none iniquitie haue dominion ouer mee. AndPſal. 41. 12. againe: Order my doings, that my footſteps ſlippe not: vphold mee in mine integritie. For if ſuch men bée neuer ſo little giuen to ſwearing, to lying, to drinke, or to women, it is eſpied by and by: and therewithall their credit is cracked, their fame ouer-caſt,

their glory eclipſed, and the date of their good name preſently expired.
            
            
               Phila.
               Now, as you haue ſhewed what great hurt theſe ſinnes doe bring vpon our ſoule, bodies, goods and name; ſo alſo, I pray you; ſhew what danger they doe bring vpon the whole land.
            
            
               Theol.
               Queſtionleſſe they doe pull downe the wrath of God vpon vs all, and giue him iuſt cauſe to breake all in péeces, and vtterly to ſubuert & ouerthrow the good eſtate, both of church and Common-wealth: yea, to make a finall conſumption and deſolation of all. For they be the very fire-brands of Gods wrath, and as it were touch-wood, to kindle his anger and indignation vpon vs. For the Apoſtle ſaith: ForCol. 3. 6. ſuch things commeth the wrath of God vpon the children of diſodedience.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               Declare vnto vs, out of the Scriptures, how the Lord in former times hath puniſhed whole Nations and Kingdomes for theſe and ſuch like ſinnes.
            
            
               Theol.
               In the fourth of Hoſea, the Lord telleth his people, that hée hath a controuerſieHoſ. 4. 2. with the inhabitants of the Land (and the reaſon is added) becauſe there was no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the Land. By ſwearing, lying, killing, ſtealing, and whoring, they breake out, and blood toucheth
                  
                  blood. Therefore ſhall the land mourne; and euery one, that dwelleth therein, ſhall be cut off.
               
               Héere then we ſée, what it is that wil incenſe God againſt vs, and cauſe vs all to mourne. So likewiſe the Lord threatneth by his Prophet Amos, that for the cruelty and oppreſſion of the poore, hée would plague the whole land. Shall not the land tremble for this (ſayth theAm. 8. 8. Lord) and euerie one mourne that dwelleth therein?
               
               Againe, the Lord ſayeth by his Prophet Ieremie;Ier. 7. 19. 20. Doe they prouoke mee to anger, and not themſelues, to the confuſion of their owne faces? Therefore thus ſayth the Lord: Behold mine anger and my wrath ſhall bee powred vpon this place, vpon man, and beaſt, vpon the tree of the field, and vpon the fruit of the ground; and it ſhall burne, and not be quenched.
               
               Againe the Lord ſaith: If yee will not heareIer. 2
                           •
                        . theſe words, I ſwear by my ſelfe (ſaith the Lord) that this houſe ſhall be waſte, and I will prepare deſtroyers againſt thee, euery one with his weapons, and they ſhall cut downe thy chiefe Cedar trees, and caſt them in the fire.
               
               Likewiſe the Lord threateneth, by his ProphetEzec. 5. 7. 
                  Ezechiel, ſaying: Becauſe yee haue not walked in my ſtatutes, nor kept my iudgements;
                  
                  therefore behold; I euen I, come againſt thee, and will execute iudgement in the middeſt of thee; euen in the ſight of Nations: and I will doe in thee, that I neuer did before, neither will I doe any more the like, becauſe of all thine abhominations. For, in the middeſt of thee, the fathers ſhall eat their ſonnes: and the ſonnes ſhall eate their fathers. Againe, byEze. 7. 23. 27. the ſame Prophet, the Lord ſaith: The land is full of the iudgement of blood, and the citie full of crueltie. Wherefore, I will bring the moſt wicked of the Heathen, and they ſhall poſſeſſe their houſes. I will alſo make the pompe of the mighty to ceaſe, and the holy places ſhall be defiled. When deſtruction commeth, they ſhall ſeeke peace, and not haue it. Calamity ſhall come vpon calamitie, and rumour vpon rumour. Then ſhall they ſeeke a viſion of the Prophet, but the law ſhall periſh from the Prieſts, and counſell from the auncient. The King ſhall mourne, and the Prince ſhall be clothed with deſolation, and the hands of the people in the land ſhall bee troubled. I will doe vnto them according to their waies: and according to their iudgements will I iudge them: and they ſhall know, that I am the Lord. Laſt of all, the Lord ſaith by his Prophet: Heare O earth: behold, I will cauſe a plague to comeIer. 4. 19. vpon this people, euen the ſruit of their owne
                  
                  imaginations, becauſe they haue not taken heed to my words, nor to my Law; but caſt it off. Almoſt innumerable places to this purpoſe are to be found in the writings of the prophets: but theſe may ſuffice to prooue the maine point: to wit, that the iuſt God doth puniſh whole nations and kingdomes, for the ſinnes and rebellions thereof.
            
            
               Phila.
               Sith all theſe ſinnes (for the which the Lord did execute ſuch vniuerſall puniſhments, vpon his owne people) doe abound and ouerflow in this land, may wee not iuſtly feare ſome great plague to fall vpon vs? and the rather, becauſe our tranſgreſſions doe increaſe daily, and grow to a full height and ripeneſſe: ſo as it ſeemeth the harueſt of Gods vengeance draweth neere, and approacheth.
            
            
               Theol.
               We may indéed iuſtly feare and tremble. For if God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, how ſhall he ſpare vs? If he ſpared not his owne people, what can wée looke for? If hée ſpared not the naturall braunches, how ſhall hée ſpare vs which are wilde by nature? Are we better then they? Can we looke to bée ſpared, when they were puniſhed? Are not our ſinnes as many, and as great as theirs? Doth not the ſame cauſe bring forth the ſame effect? Is the arme of the Lord ſhortned? Or is not God the ſame iuſt God, to puniſh ſinne now,

that he was then? Yes, yes, aſſuredly. And therefore wée haue great cauſe to mourne and lament, to quake and tremble; becauſe there is a naked ſword of vengeance, hanging ouer ourIer. 4. 19. Am. 5. 6. Abac. 3. 16. heads. Thus did Ieremie, thus did Amos, thus did Abacuck: when they plainely ſaw the imminent wrath of God approching vpon the people of Iſrael and Iudah.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               I thinke, we may the rather doubt and feare, becauſe the puniſhment of theſe forenamed vices, is neglected by the Magiſtrate. For commonly, when they that beare the ſword of Iuſtice, doe not draw it out to puniſh notorious offenders and malefactours, the Lord himſelfe will take the matter into his owne hands, and bee reuenged in his owne perſon: which is moſt dreadfull and daungerous. For it is a fearefullHeb. 10. 31. thing, to fall into the handes of the liuing God.
            
            
               Theo.
               You haue ſpoken a truth. For if thoſe, which are Gods deputies and vice-gerents in the earth, doe their duties faithfully in puniſhing vice, and maintaining vertue; in ſmiting the wicked, and fauouring the godly: then aſſuredly euill ſhall bée taken out of Iſrael, Gods wrath preuented, and his iudgments intercepted; as it is written: Phineas ſtood vp and executed iudgement, and the plague was ſtaied.1 Pſ. 106. 30 But if they (for feare, fauour, affection, gaine,

flattery, bribery, or any other ſiniſter reſpect) will be too ſparing and remiſſe in puniſhing of groſſe offenders, and be rather ready to ſmite the righteous: then doe they excéedingly prouoke Gods wrath againſt the land, and againſt themſelues.
            
            
               Phila.
               One thing I doe greatly lament: that there be either none at all, or very ſlender cenſurers, either by the Ciuill, or Eccleſiaſticall authority, for diuers of theſe fore-named vices: as pride, couetouſneſſe, oppreſſion, lying, idleneſſe ſwearing, &c.
            
            
               Theol.
               It is a thing to be lamented indéed. For where doe wée ſée a proud man puniſhed, a couetous man puniſhed, an oppreſſor puniſhed, aſwearer puniſhed, a liar puniſhed, an idle perſon puniſhed? Now, becauſe they know they cannot, or ſhall not be puniſhed, therefore they are altogether hardned, and imboldned in their ſinnes: as the wiſe man ſaith: Becauſe ſentenceEccl. 8. 11. againſt an euill worke is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the hearts of the children of men are fully ſet in them to doe euill.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               One thing I do much muſe at, wherein alſo I deſire to be further ſatisfied, to wit, what is the cauſe, that vnder ſo godly a prince, ſo many good lawes, and ſo much good preaching and teaching, there ſhould notwithſtanding, be ſuch an exceſſe and ouerflowing of ſin, in all eſtates.
            
            
               
               Theo.
               The cauſes héere of are diuers and manifold. But I will nominate ſoure eſpeciall ones, in my iudgement. The firſt is, mans naturall corruption; which is ſo ſtrong, as almoſt nothing can bridle it. The ſecond is ill preſidents, and externall prouocations to euill. The third is the want of teaching, in many congregations of the land; by reaſon whereof, many know not ſinne to be ſinne. The laſt reaſon is, the corruption and negligence of ſome ſuch as are in authority.
            
            
               Phila.
               Doth not this inundation and ouerflowing of ſinne, with the impunity of the ſame, Prognoſticate great wrath againſt vs?
            
            
               Theol.
               Yes vndoubtedly, as hath in part béene ſhewed before. And there he diuers other preſages of wrath, though not of the ſame kinde: which are theſe:

                     Vnthankefulneſſe for the Goſpell.
                     The abuſe of our long peace.
                     Our generall ſecurity.
                     Our ſecret Idolatries.Nine predictions, or foreſignes of wrath.
                     
                     Our ripeneſſe in all ſinne.
                     Our abuſe of all Gods mercies.
                     Our abuſe of his long patience.
                     The coldneſſe of profeſſors.
                     Our not profitting by former iudgements: as peſtilence, famine, dearth, and the ſhaking of the Sword.
                  
               
            
            
               
               Phila.
               This laſt I take to be a ſpeciall token of approching vengeance; that we haue not profited by former warnings.
            
            
               Theol.
               True indéed. For it is an ordinary thing with God, when men will not profit by milde corrections, and common puniſhments, then to lay greater vpon them. And when a former trouble doth vs no good, we are to feare a finall conſuming trouble. For ſo we reade in the Prophecie of Hoſea; that at the firſt, God was to Ephraim as a moth, and to Iudah as rottenneſſe: but afterward, when as they profited not by it, he was to Ephraim as a Lion, and to Iudah
                  Hoſ. 5. 12. as a Lions whelpe. So the Lord ſaith in another place, that, if they will not come in, and yéeld obedience at the firſt call of his wrath, then he will puniſh them ſeuen times more. But ifLeu. 26. 18 they continue in their ſtubbornneſſe, then he threatneth to bring ſeuen times more plaguesVerſe 21. vpon them, according to their ſins. If by all theſe they would not be reformed, but walke ſtubbornelyVerſe 24. againſt him, then he threatneth yet ſeuen times more, for their ſins: and the fourthVerſe 28. time, yet ſeuen times more. The proofe héereof wée haue in the booke of the Iudges. WhereIudg. 3. 8. we read, how the people of Iſrael, for their ſins, were in ſubiection to the King of Aram Naharim, eight yéeres: afterward, becauſe they profited nothing by it, but returned to their old

ſinnes, therfore they ſerued Eglon king of Moab, eightéene yéeres. After that againe, for theirIudg. 3. new ſinnes and prouocations, the Lord gaue them vp into the hands of Midian, ſeuen yéeres.Iudg. 6. 1. After all this, for the renewing of their ſins, the Lord ſolde them into the hands of the Philiſtins
                  Iud. 10. 7. Pſa. 106. 3. and the Amonites, which did gréeuouſly vex and oppreſſe them, for the ſpace of eightéene yéeres. Laſt of all, we reade, that when neither famine nor peſtilence could cauſe them to returne vnto him, then he deliuered them vp to the ſword of their enemies, and held them in bondage & captiuity, thréeſcore and ten yéeres. After all this, when they were deliuered out of Captiuity, and returned home ſafely to their owne nation, and inioyed ſome good time of peace and reſt, yet at laſt they fell to renewing of their ſinnes: and therfore the Lord plaguedEzec. 3. 8. Dan. 7. Dan. 11. them moſt grieuouſly, by the diuided Gréeke Empire: euen by Magog, and Egypt, Seleucidae, and Lagidae, and that by the ſpace almoſt of thrée hundred yéeres. And this is it, that the Prophet Hoſea did foretell: that the childrenHoſ. 3. 4. of Iſrael ſhould remaine many daies without a King, and without a prince, without an offering, and without an image, without an Ephod, and without Teraphim.

               You haue very largely laide open this laſt token of vengeance; to wit, that

God at the firſt doth but beat vs vpon the coat: but if we continue in ſinne, he will whip vs on the bare skinne: and if men will not yeeld at the firſt gentle ſtroaks, then he wil ſtrike harder and harder, till he haue broken our ſtout ſtomacks, and made our great hearts come downe. Therefore it is good yeelding at the firſt: for we ſhall get nothing by our ſturdineſſe againſt him. We doe but cauſe him to double his ſtrokes, and ſtrike vs both ſidelings and ouer-thwart: For he cannot indure that we ſhould gruntle againſt him, with ſtubborne fullenneſſe. But now to the point. Sith there are ſo many preſages, and foreſignes of Gods wrath, I pray you ſhew, what it is that ſtaieth the execution, and very downefall of the ſame.
            
            
               Theo.
               The praiers and téeres of the faithfull, are the ſpeciall mean, that ſtay the hand of God from ſtriking of vs. For the praiers of the righteous are of great force with him: euen able to do all things. Saint Iames ſaith, that theIam. 5. 17. prayer of a righteous man auaileth much, if it be feruent: and bringeth the example of Elias, to proue it: For ſaith he, Though Elias was a man ſubiect to the like paſſions that we be, yet was he able, by his praiers, both to open and ſhut the heauens. Abraham likewiſe preuailed ſo farre with God, by his praiers for Sodome,
                  Gen. 18. that if there had béene but ten iuſt men

found in it, it had béene ſpared. The almighty God ſaith in the 15. chap. of Ieremy, ThoughIere. 15. 1. Moyſes and Samuel ſtood before me, yet mine affection could not bee toward this people. Which doth plainely ſhew, that Moyſes and Samuel might haue done much with him, had he not béene ſo fully bent againſt his people for their ſins, as he was. So likewiſe he ſaith in the Prophecie of Ezechiel; Though theſe threeEz. 14. 14. men, Noah, Daniel and Iob, were amongſt them, they ſhould deliuer but their owne ſoules, by their righteouſneſſe. Which alſo ſheweth, that if there had béene any poſſible entreating of him for the Land, theſe thrée men might haue done it: but now he was reſolutely determined to the contrary. In reſpect therefore that the zealous preachers, and true profeſſors of the Goſpell doe ſo much preuaile wiſh God by their praiers, they are ſaid to be the defence and ſtrength of Kingdomes and Countries, of Churches and Common wealthes: as it is ſaid of Eliah; that he was the Chariot of Iſrael
                  2. King. 2. 12. 2. King. 6. 17. and the horſmen thereof. Eliſhah alſo was enuironed with a mountaine full of horſes, and Chariots of fire. And ſure it is, that Eliah and Eliſhah are not onely the Chariots and Horſemen of Iſrael, but alſo by their praiers, they do cauſe God himſelfe to be a wal of fire round about it: as the Prophet ſaith in the 22. of

                  Ezechiel, verſe 30. the Lord God ſaith: IEze 22. 30 ſought for a man among them, that ſhould make vp the hedge, and ſtand in the gappe before me for the land; that I might not deſtroy it: but I found none. Which ſheweth, that if there had béene but ſome few to haue ſtood in the breach, he would haue ſpared the whole land. This alſo appeareth more plainely, in the Prophecie of Ieremy; where the Lord ſaith thus: Run to and fro, by the ſtreets of Ieruſalem;Iere. 5. 1. behold and inquire in the open places thereof, if yee can finde a man, or if there be any that executeth iudgement, and ſeeketh the truth: and I will ſpare it. Oh then marke and conſider, what a man may doe: yea, what one man may doe: what an Abraham may doe: what a Moyſes may doe: what an Eliah may doe: what a Daniel, what a Samuel, what a Iob, what a Noah may doe! Some one man (by reaſon of his high fauor with the Eternal) is able ſometimes to do more for a land, by his praiers and téeres, then many prudent men by their counſell, or valiant men by their ſwords. Yea, it doth euidently appeare (in the ſacred volume of the holy Ghoſt) that ſome one poore Preacher, being full of the Spirit and power of Eliah, doth more in his ſtudy (either for offence, or defence: either for the turning away of wrath, or the procuring of mercie) then a

Campe-royall, euen forty thouſand ſtrong: or, as the Spirit ſpeaketh: though they all haueCant. 3. 7. their ſwords girded to their thighes, and be of the moſt valiant men in Iſrael. All this is clearly proued in one verſe of the booke of the Pſalmes: where the Prophet hauing reckoned vp the ſins of the people, addeth: Therefore the Lord minded to deſtroy them, had not Moſes (his choſen)Pſ. 106. 23. ſtood in the breach, to turne away his wrath: leſt he ſhould deſtroy them. Sée therefore, what one man may do with God! Some one man doth ſo binde the hands of God, that when he ſhould ſtrike, he hath no power to doe it: as it is ſaid of Lot: I can doe nothing, tillGen. 19. 22 thou be come out. Sée how the Lord ſaith, he can doe nothing: becauſe he will doe nothing! Hée doth wittingly and willingly ſuffer his hands to be manacled and bound behind him, for ſome fewes ſake, which he doth make more account of, then all the world beſides: ſo pretious and deare are they in his ſight. Likewiſe it is written, that the Lord was excéedingly incenſed againſt the Iſraelites for their idolatrous Calfe, which they made in Horeb: yet he could doe nothing, becauſe Moyſes would not let him. And therefore he falleth to intreating of Moyſes, that Moyſes would let him alone, and entreat no more for them. Oh, (ſaithExo. 32. 10. the Lord to Moyſes) let me alone: that my wrath
                  
                  may wax hote againſt this people, and that I may conſume them. Thus wée ſée, that except Lot goe out of the City, and Moyſes let him alone, he can doe nothing. Oh the profoundneſſe and altitude of Gods mercy, towards mankind! Oh, the height and depth, length and breadth of his loue towards ſome! Oh that the moſt glorious & inuiſible God ſhould ſo greatly reſpect the ſonnes of men! For what is man, that hée ſhould be mindfull of him? or the ſonne of man, that he ſhould regard him? Let vs therfore that are the Lords remembrancers, giue him no reſt, nor let him alone, vntill wée haue ſome ſecurity, and good aſſurance from him, that he will turne away from vs the wrath which we moſt iuſtly haue deſerued: that he wil ſpare vs, and be mercifull vnto vs. Yea, & as the Prophet ſaith, Let vs neuer leaue him, nor giue himEſa. 62. 7. ouer, till he repaire and ſet vp Ieruſalem, the praiſe of the world: leſt for default héereof, that be charged vpon vs, which was charged vpon the head of ſome of the Prophets in Iſrael: that they were like the foxes in the waſte places, that they had not riſen vp in the gaps, neither made vp the hedge for the houſe of Iſrael.
                  Eze. 13. 45. For now adaies, alas, wée haue many hedgebreakers, few hedg-makers: many openers of gaps, few ſtoppers, many breakers of breaches, to let in the flouds of Gods wrath

vpon vs, but very few, that by true repentance goe about to make vp the breach, and to let downe the ſluces, that the guſhing ſtreames of Gods vengeance may be ſtopt and ſtaied.

               I doe now plainely ſee, that there be ſome in high fauour with God, and, as wee ſay, greatly in his books; ſith his loue is ſo great vnto them, that for their ſakes he ſpareth thouſands.
            
            
               Theol.
               It is written in the Prouerbs of Salomon, that the righteous in a land, are the eſtabliſhment of the kings throne; and the wicked, the ouerthrowing of the ſame. The words are theſe: Take away the droſſe from the ſiluer,Pro. 25. 4. and there will proceed a veſſell for the finer. Take away the wicked from the King, and his throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe. Likewiſe in another place the wiſe man affirmeth, that the righteous are the ſtrength and bulwarke of Cities, Townes, and Corporations: but the wicked are the weakening & vndoing of all. Scornefull men, ſaith he, ſet a CityPro. 29. 8. on fire; but the wiſe turne away wrath. To this purpoſe, moſt excellent is that ſaying of Eliphas in Iob; The innocent ſhall deliuer the Iland; andIob. 23. 30. it ſhall be preſerued by the pureneſſe of their hands. Wée reade in the booke of the Chronicles, that when the Leuites & the Prieſts were caſt out by Ieroboam, they came to Ieruſalem,
                  
and all ſuch as ſet their hearts to ſéeke the Lord God of Iſrael came with them. And then afterward2. Chron. 11. 13. it is ſaid, they ſtrengthned the kingdome of Iudah, and made Rehoboam the ſonne of Salomon mighty. By all theſe teſtimonies it is euident, that princes, kingdomes, cities, towns & villages, are fortified by the righteous therein: and for their ſakes alſo great plagues are kept backe. Which thing one of the heathen did well ſée into, as appeareth by his words, which are theſe: When God meaneth well vnto a city, and will doe good vnto it, then hee raiſeth vp good men: but when hee meaneth to puniſh a citie or countrey, and doe ill vnto it, then he taketh away the good men from it.

               It is very manifeſt by all that you haue alledged, that the wicked fare the better euery day in the yeare, for the righteous that dwell amongſt them.
            
            
               Theol.
               All experience doth teach it: and the ſcriptures do plentifully auouch it. For did not churliſh Laban fare the better for Iacob hisGen. 30. 27. Gen. 39. 5. kinſman? Doth he not acknowledge, that the Lord had bleſſed him for his ſake? Did not Potiphar fare the better for godly Ioſeph? Doth not the Scripture ſay, that the Lord bleſſed the Egyptians houſe for Ioſeph his ſake? and that the Lord made all that he did to proſper in his2. Sam. 6. 11. hand? Did not Obed-edom fare the better for

the Arke? Did not the ſeuenty and ſix ſoules, that were in the ſhip with Paul, ſpéed all theAct. 27. 24. better for his ſake? Did not the Angell of God tell him in the night, that God had giuen vnto him, all that ſayled with him? for otherwiſe, a thouſand to one, they had béene all drowned. Therfore the children of God may very fitly be compared to a great péece of cork, which though it be caſt into the ſea, hauing many nailes faſtned in it, yet it beareth them all vp from ſinking: which otherwiſe, would ſinke of themſelues. What ſhall we ſay then? or what ſhall we conclude? but that the vngodly are more beholden to the righteous, thē they are aware of.
            
            
               Phila.
               I doe thinke, if it were not for Gods children, it would goe hard with the wicked. For, if they were ſorted and ſhoaled out from amongſt them, and placed by themſelues, what could they looke for; but wrath vpon wrath, and plague vpon plague? till the Lord had made a finall conſumption of them, and ſwept them like dung, from the face of the earth.

               Sure it is, all creatures would frowne vpon them. The Sunne would vnwillingly ſhine vpon them: or the Moone giue them any light. The Starres would not be ſeene of them: and the Planets would hide themſelues. The beaſts would deuoure them: the fowles would picke out their eies. The fiſhes would make

war againſt them: and all creatures in heauen and earth would riſe vp in armes againſt them. Yea, the Lord himſelfe from heauen, would raine downe fire and brimſtone vpon them.

               Yet for all this, it is a wonder to conſider how deadly the wicked hate the righteous, and almoſt in euery thing oppoſe themſelues againſt them: and that in moſt virulent and ſpitefull manner. They raile and ſlander, ſcoffe and ſcorne, mocke and mowe at them: as though they were not worthy to liue vpon the earth. They eſteeme euery pelting raſcall, and preferre euery vile varlet, before them. And though they haue their liues and liberty, their breath and ſafety, and all that they haue elſe, by them, yet, for all that, they could be content to eat their hearts with garlicke: ſo great, ſo fiery, ſo burning and hiſſing hot is their fury and malice againſt them.

Or vnto a man that ſtandeth vpon a bough in the top of a trée, where there is no more: and yet, with an axe choppeth it off, and therewithall falleth downe with it, and breaketh his necke. Euen ſo, the fooles of this world doe what they can, to

               I ſee plainly, they be much their owne foes, and ſtand in their owne light, and indeed know not what they doe.

               The mercifull preſeruation of our moſt gratious king (who is the breath of our noſtrils) the long continuance of our peace, and of the Goſpell: the kéeping backe of the ſword out of the land, which our ſinnes pull vpon vs: the fruſtrating of many plots and ſubtill deuices, which haue béene often intended againſt our ſtate, yea, and the life of his Maieſties moſt roiall perſon: make me to thinke, that there bée ſome ſtrong pleaders with God, for the publike good of vs all.

               Yes aſſuredly, very much: as the ordinary and outward meanes, which God vſeth for our ſafety. For though the Apoſtle Paul had a grant frō God for the ſafety of his owne life, & al that were with him in the ſhip; yet he ſaid, Except the mariners abide in the ſhip, we can not be ſafe. Shewing thereby, that vnto faithAct. 17. 3. and praiers, the beſt and wiſeſt meanes muſt be ioyned.

               Theol.
               The beſt and ſureſt courſe, that I can conſider or conceiue of, is, to repent heartily for ſinnes paſt, and to reforme our liues in time to come, to ſeeke the Lord while he may be found, and to call vpon him while he is néere: to forſake our owne waies, and our owne imaginations, and to turne vnto him with all our hearts, with wéeping, with faſting, and with mourning; as the Prophet Ioel aduiſeth: ForIoel. 2. our God is gracious and mercifull, ſlow to anger, and of great kindeneſſe, and repenteth him of the euill. All the Prophets doe counſell vs to follow this courſe, and doe plainely teach, that if we all (from the higheſt to the loweſt) doe méet the Lord with vnfained repentance, and offer him the ſacrifice of a contrite ſpirit, vndoubtedly hée will be pacified towards vs, and be mercifull to our tranſgreſſions. This is moſt plainely ſet downe in the ſeuenth of Ieremy, where the Lord ſaith thus to his people:Ier. y. 
                  If you amend and redreſſe your waies and your workes: If you execute iudgement betwixt a man and his neighbour, and oppreſſe not
                  
                  the ſtranger, the fatherleſſe and the widow, and ſhead no innocent blood in this place, neither walke after other gods, to your deſtruction: then will I let you dwell in this place; euen in the land which I gaue vnto your fathers, for euer and euer. So likewiſe he ſaith by the ſame Prophet. Execute yee iudgement andIer. 22 3. righteouſneſſe, and deliuer the oppreſſed from the hand of the oppreſſor, and vex not the fatherleſſe, the widow or the ſtrangers; doe no violence, nor ſhead innocent blood in this place. For if you doe this thing, then ſhall the Kings ſitting vpon the Throne of Dauid, enter in by the gates of this houſe, and ride vpon chariots and vpon horſes, both hee, and his ſeruants and his people. And againe: O yeeIer. 3. 22. diſobedient children returne, and I will heale your rebellion. The Lord alſo ſaith by his Prophet Eſay; If yee conſent and obey, yeeEſay. 1. 19. ſhall eate the good things of the land; but if yee refuſe and bee rebellious, yee ſhall be deuoured with the ſword. For the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it. The Prophet Hoſea ſaith: Come let vs returne to the Lord: forHoſ. 6. 1. hee hath ſpoiled, and he will heale vs: he hath wounded vs, and he will binde vs vp. And againe: O Iſrael returne vnto the Lord, (forHoſ. 13. 1. thou haſt fallen by thine iniquitie) and I will heale thy rebellion, and will loue thee freely:
                  
                  for mine anger is turned away from thee. I will be as the deaw vnto Iſrael; he ſhall grow as the Lilly, and faſten his root as the tree of Lebanon; his braunches ſhall ſpread, and his beautie ſhall bee as the Oliue trée; and his ſmell as Lebanon.
               
               The Prophet Michah telleth vs what is good for vs, and what is our beſt courſe, and what the Lord requireth at our hands: namely theſe foure things: To doe iuſtly, to loue mercie,Mic. 6. 8. to humble our ſelues, and to walke with our God. The Prophet Amos giueth the ſameAmos. 5. 14. counſell, ſaying: Seeke the Lord, and yee ſhall liue. Seeke good, and not euill. Hate the euil, and loue the good, and eſtabliſh iudgment in the gate. It may bee, that the Lord of Hoſtes will bee mercifull vnto the remnant of Ioſeph. Alſo the Lord himſelfe ſaith; If this Nation, againſt whom I haue pronounced, turne from their wickedneſſe, I will repent of the plague I thought to bring vpon them. Iere. 8. 8. Thus we doe plainely ſée, what aduice and counſell the Prophets and holy men of God doe giue vnto vs. The ſumme of all is this; that if we do truely repent and turne vnto him with all our hearts (ſtudying to obey him, and walke in his waies) then he wil grant vs any fauor, that we wil require at his hands. For, euen as woolpacks, and other ſoſt matter,

beateth backe, and dampeth the force of al ſhot: ſo penitent, melting, and ſoft hearts, doe beat backe the ſhot of Gods wrath, and turne away his vengeance from vs. Moreouer, wée may obſerue in all experience, that when potentates are offended, or any great man hath conceiued a diſpleaſure againſt a poore man, that then he muſt runne and ride, ſend preſents, vſe his friends, breake his ſléeps, and neuer be quiet till he haue pacified him. Euen ſo muſt wée deale with our God, ſéeing he hath taken a diſpleaſure againſt vs. Oh therfore that we would ſpéedily vſe all poſſible meanes, to pacifie his wrath! Oh that we would, with one heart and voice, euery one of vs (from the higheſt to the loweſt) humble our ſelues before our God, forſake our former euill waies, be grieued for that we haue done, and purpoſe neuer to do the like againe! Oh that it might go to the hearts of vs, that we haue ſo often & ſo grieuouſly offended ſo louing a God, and ſo mercifull a Father! Oh that we would awakeonce at laſt, & rowſe vp our drowzie hearts, & ranſack our ſleepy conſciences, crying out againſt our ſins; that our ſins might neuer cry out againſt vs! Oh that wée would iudge our ſelues, accuie our ſelues, endite our ſelues, and condemne our ſelues; ſo ſhould wée neuer be adiudged, accuſed, endited or condemned of the Lord! Oh that all hearts

might ſob, all ſoules might ſigh, all loynes might be ſmitten with ſorrow, all faces gather blackneſſe, and euery man ſmite himſelfe one the thigh, ſaying: What haue I done? Oh, that both Magiſtracy, Miniſtery, and communaltie, would purpoſe and vow, and euen take a bond of themſelues, that from hence foorth, and from this day forward they would ſet their hearts to ſéeke the Lord: and that they would wholly giue vp themſelues to his obedience! Oh that all men, women, and children would feare God, & kepe his commandements: would eſchew euill, and doe good: would ſtudie to pleaſe God in allthings, and to be fruitfull in all good workes: making conſcience to performe the duties of their generall callings, and duties of their ſpeciall callings: duties of the firſt Table, and duties of the ſecond Table: that ſo God might be ſincerely worſhipped, his name truely reuerenced, his Sabbaths religiouſly obſerued; & that euery man would deale kindely, mercifully, iuſtly, & vprightly with his neighbour: that there might be no complaining, no crying in our ſtréets! Oh I ſay againe, & againe, that if all of vs, of what eſtate, degrée, or condition ſoeuer, would walke in the paths of our God; then doubtleſſe we ſhould liue and ſee good daies, all future dangers ſhould bée preuented, our peace prolonged, our ſtate eſtabliſhed,

our King preſerued, and the Goſpell continued. Then ſhould we ſtil enioy our liues, our goods, our lands, our liuings, cur wiues, our children, our houſes, and tenements, our Orchards, and Gardens: yea, as the Prophet ſaith, we ſhould eat the good things of the land, ſpending our daies in much comfort, peace and tranquillity: and leaue great bliſſings vnto our children and poſterity, from age to age, from generation to generation.

               You haue fully anſwered my queſtion, and well ſatisfied me therin, out of the ſcriptures: yet I pray you giue me leaue to adde one thing vnto that, which you haue at large ſet downe. The Lord ſaith by the Prophet Amos, that for their ſinnes and rebellions, hee had giuen them cleanneſſe of teeth: that is, dearth and ſcarcitie: and yet they did not turne vnto him. Alſo hee with-held the raine from them, and puniſhed them with drought, and yet they did not turne vnto him. Moreouer hee ſmote their Corne, their great Gardens, their Orchards, Vineyardes, Figtrees, and Oliue-trees, with blaſting and mildeaw, and the Palmer-worme did deuoure them; and yet they did not returne vnto him. Laſt of all, hee ſmote them with peſtilence, and with the ſword, and ouerthrew them, as he ouerthrew Sodome and Gomorrah, and they

were as a fire-brand pluckt out of the burning: yet, for all this, they did not turne vnto him. Yee haue not turned vnto mee, ſaith the Lord. But now to come to the point. Out of this IAmos. 4. 6. 7. gather, that if wee multiply our tranſgreſſions, God will multiply his plagues vpon vs: but on the contrary, if wee would vnfainedly turne vnto the Lord our God with all our hearts, all plagues ſhould bee ſtaied, all dangers preuented; and no euill ſhould fall vpon vs. For becauſe they would not turne, therefore hee ſmote them. If therefore they had turned, hee would not haue ſmote them. But now I pray you briefely conclude this point, and declare in few words, what it is that doth moſt materially concerne our peace, and publike good.
            
            
               Theol.
               Theſe fewe then briefly, I take to be the things which belong to our peace:

                     Let Salomon execute Ioab and Shemei.Ten things concerning our peace.
                     
                     Let Iohn and Eliah ſlay the Prieſts and Prophets of Baal.
                     Let Aaron and Eleazar miniſter before the Lord faithfully.
                     Let Ionas be caſt out of the ſhip.
                     Let Moſes ſtand faſt in the gap, and not let downe his hand.
                     Let Ioſuah ſucced him.
                     
                        Let Cornelius feare God, with all his houſehold.
                     Let Tabitha be full of good workes, and almeſdeeds.
                     Let Deborah iudge long in Iſrael, proſper, and be victorious.
                     Let vs all pray that the light of Iſrael may not be quenched.
                  
               
               And this I take to be the ſumme of all, that belongeth to our peace.

               The ſumme of all our conference hitherto, as I remember, may be reduced vnto theſe few heads: Firſt, mans naturall corruption hath beene laide open. Secondly, the horrible fruites thereof. Thirdly, their euill effects and workings, both againſt our ſoules and bodies, goods, name, and the whole land. Laſtly, the remedies of all. Now therefore I would grow to ſome concluſion of that which you touched by the way, and made ſome mention of: namely, the ſignes of ſaluation and damnation: and declare vnto vs plainely, whether the ſtate of a mans ſoule, before God, may not by certaine ſignes and tokens, bee certainely diſcerned euen in this life.

               What ſay you then to Saint Peters ſignes, which are ſet downe in the firſt chapter of his ſecond Epiſtle: which are theſe eight?

Which is as much as if hée had ſaid: they will make vs ſound and ſincere Profeſſors of the Goſpell.

               All theſe, I grant, are exceeding good ſignes and euidences of a mans ſaluation: but yet ſome of them may deceiue; and an hole may bee picked in ſome of theſe euidences. I would therefore heare of ſome ſuch demonſtratiue and infallible euidences, as no Lawyer can finde fault with. For I hold, that good Diuines can as perfectly iudge of the aſſurances and euidences of mens ſaluation: as the beſt Lawyer can iudge of the aſſurances and euidences, whereby men hold their lands and liuings.

               You haue ſpoken truely, in that. And would to God all the Lords people would bring foorth the euidences of their ſaluation: that wée might diſcerne of them.
            
            
               Phila.
               Set downe then, which be the moſt certaine and infallible euidences of a mans ſaluation: againſt the which no exception can beeSeuen infallible ſignes of ſaluation. Acts 16. 31. Pro. 11. 20. Ioh. 1. 47. taken.

               I iudge theſe to be moſt ſound and infallible:

               Now you come neare the quicke indeed. For, in my iudgement, none of theſe can be found truely in any reprobat. Therefore I thinke no Diuine can take exception againſt any of theſe.
            
            
               Theo.
               No, I aſſure you: no more then a Lawyer can finde fault with the Tenure of mens lands, and fee-ſimples, when as both the Title is good & ſtrong by the law, and the euidences thereof are ſealed, ſubſcribed, deliuered, conueied, and ſufficient witneſſe vpon the ſame, and all other ſignes and ceremonies (in the deliuering and taking poſſeſſion thereof) according to ſtrickt law obſerued. For if a man haue theſe forenamed euidences of his ſaluation, ſure it is, his Title and intereſt to heauen is good, by the law of Moſes, and the Prophets: I meane the word of God. God himſelfe ſubſcribeth to them: Jeſus Chriſt deliuereth them as his owne déede: the holy Ghoſt ſealeth vnto them: yea, the three great witneſſes, which beare record in the earth (that is, water, blood, and the ſpirit) doe all witneſſe the ſame.
            
            
               Phila.
               Now, you haue very fully ſatisfied me

touching this point. And one thing more I do gather out of all your ſpeech: to wit, that you doe thinke, a man may be aſſured of his ſaluation, euen in this life.
            
            
               Theol.
               I doe thinke ſo indéed. For he, that knoweth not in this life that he ſhall be ſaued, ſhall neuer be ſaued after this life. For S. Iohn
                  1. Iohn. 3. 2. ſaith: Now are we made the ſonnes of God.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               But becauſe many doubt of this, and the Papiſts doe altogether denie it: therefore I pray you confirme it vnto vs out of the Scriptures.
            
            
               Theol.
               The Apoſtle ſaith: We know that if2. Cor. 5. 1. our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle bee deſtroied, wee haue a building giuen vs of God: that is, an houſe not made with hands, but eternall in the heauens. Marke, that he ſaith, both he, and the reſt of Gods people, did certainely know, that heauen was prouided for them. For the ſpirit of adoption beareth witnes with our ſpirits, that we are the children of God. And againe, the ſame Apoſtle ſaith: From henceforth is laid vp for me the crowne of righteouſneſſe, which the Lord the righteousRom. 8. 15. 16. 2. Tim. 4. 8. Iudge ſhall giue mee at that day; not to mee onely, but to all them that loue his appearing. Héere we ſée, that he knew there was a crowne prepared for him, and for all the elect. And the ſame ſpirit, which did aſſure it vnto

                  Paul doth aſſure it alſo to all the children of God. For they all haue the ſame ſpirit: though not in the ſame meaſure. S. Iohn ſaith alſo:1. Ioh 2. 3. 
                  Hereby we are ſure we know him; If we keepe his Commandements. In-which words, S. Iohn telleth vs thus much: that if we doe vnfeinedly endeuour to obey God, there is in vs the true knowledge and feare of God: and conſequently, wée are ſure we ſhall be ſaued. S. Peter ſaith: Giue all diligence, to make your2. Pet. 1. 10. calling and election ſure. Wherefore ſhould the Apoſtle exhort vs, to make our election ſure, if none could be ſure of it? In the ſecond to the Epheſians the Apoſtle ſaith flatly, that in Chriſt Ieſus we doe already ſit together in the heauenly places. His meaning is not, that we are there already in poſſeſſion: but we are as ſure of it, as if we were there already. The reaſons hereof are theſe: Chriſt our head is inIoh. 22. 32. Ioh. 14. 13 poſſeſſion: Therefore he will draw al his members vnto him, as he himſelfe ſaith.
               Secondly, we are as ſure of the thing which we hope for, as of that which we haue. But we are ſure of that which we haue; which is the worke of grace; Therefore we are ſure of that wée looke for; which is the crowne of glory. Many other places of the holy Scriptures might be alleadged to this purpoſe: but I ſuppoſe, theſe may ſuffice.
            
            
               
               Phila.
               As you haue ſhewed this by the Scriptures; So alſo ſhew it yet more plainely, by euident reaſon out of the ſame.
            
            
               Theol.
               How can a man in truth call God his Father? (when he ſaith: Our Father wich art in Heauen) and yet doubt, whether he be his Father or no? For if God indeed be our Father, and we his children, how can we periſh? how can we be damned? will a father condemne his owne children? or ſhall the children of God be condemned? No, no. There is no condemnationRom. 8. 1. Rom. 8. 33. 34. to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus. And, who can lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that iuſtifieth, who can condemne? It is therefore moſt certaine and ſure, that all ſuch, as doe in truth call God their Father, and haue God for their Father, ſhall be ſaued. Againe, how can a man ſay, in truth and féeling, that he beléeueth the forgiueneſſe of ſin, and yet doubt whether he ſhall be ſaued? For if he be fully perſwaded that his ſinnes are forgiuen, what letteth why he ſhould not be ſaued? Moreouer, as certainly as we know that wée are called, iuſtified, and ſanctified: ſo certainely wée know we ſhall be glorified. But we know the one certainely: and therefore the other.
            
            
               Aſune.
               I will neuer beleeue, that any man can certainely know in this world, whether hee ſhall bee ſaued, or damned; but all men

muſt hope well, and be of a good beliefe.
            
            
               Theol.
               Nay: we muſt goe further then hope well. We may not venture our ſaluation vpon vncertaine hopes. As, if a man ſhould hope it would be a faire day to morrow: but hée cannot certainely tell. No, no. We muſt in this caſe, being of ſuch infinite importance as it is, grow to ſome certainety, and full reſolution. Wée ſée, worldly men will be loath to hold their lands and leaſes vncertainely, hauing nothing to ſhew for them. They will not ſtand to the courteſie of their land-lords, nor reſt vpon their good willes. They will not ſtay vpon vncertaine hope. No; they are wiſer then ſo. For the children of this world are wiſer in their generation, then the children of light. They will be ſure to haue ſomething to ſhew. They will haue it vnder ſeale. They will not ſtay vpon the words and promiſes of the moſt honeſtLuke. 16. men, and beſt Land-lords. They cannot bée quiet, till they haue it in white and blacke, with ſound counſell vpon their Title; and euery way made as ſure vnto them, as any Law of the Land can make it.
               Are then the children of this world ſo wiſe in theſe inferiour things, and ſhall not wée bée as wiſe in matters of tenne thouſand times more importance? Are they ſo wiſe for earth, and ſhall not wée bée as wiſe for Heauen? Are they

ſo wiſe for their bodies, and ſhall not we be as wiſe for our ſoules? Shall we hold the ſtate of our immortall inheritance by hope well; and haue no writings, nor euidences, no ſeals, no witneſſes, nor any thing to ſhew for it? Alas, this is a weake Tenure, a broken title, a ſimple hold indéed.
            
            
               Aſune.
               Yet for all that a man cannot be certaine.
            
            
               Theol.
               Yes, S. Iohn telleth vs, we may bée certaine. For he ſaith: Heereby we know wee1. Iohn. 4. 13. dwell in him, and he in vs; becauſe he hath giuen vs of his ſpirit. He ſaith not, we hope; but we know certainly. For he that hath the ſpirit of God, knoweth certainly he hath it; and he that hath faith, knoweth that he hath faith; & he that ſhall be ſaued, knoweth hée ſhall be ſaued. For God doth not worke ſo darkely in mens hearts, by his ſpirit, but that they may eaſily know whether it be of him or no, if they would make a due triall. Againe, the ſame Apoſtle ſaith: He that beleeueth in the Sonne of God,1. Iohn. 5. 10. hath the witnes in himſelfe. That is, he hath certaine teſtimonies in his owne conſcience, that he ſhall be ſaued. For we muſt fetch the warrant of our ſaluation from within our ſelues: euen from the worke of God within vs. For looke, how much a man feeleth in himſelfe the increaſe of knowledge, obedience, & godlines;

ſo much the more ſure hée is, that he ſhall bée ſaued. A mans owne conſcience is of great force this way: and will not lie, or deceiue. For ſo ſaith the wiſe man: As water ſheweth face toPro. 27. 19. face, ſo doth the heart, man vnto man; That is, the mind and conſcience of euery man telleth him iuſtly (though not perfectly) what he is. For the conſcience will not lie: but accuſe, or excuſe a man; being in ſtead of a thouſand witneſſes.
               The Apoſtle alſo ſaith; No man knoweth the1. Cor. 2. 11. Pro. 20. 27. things of man, but the ſpirit of a man that is in him. And againe, the Scripture ſaith; Mans ſoule is, as it were, the candle of the Lord: wherby he ſearcheth all the bowels of the belly. So then it is a cleare caſe, that a man muſt haue recourſe to the worke of Gods grace within him, euen in his owne ſoule. For thereby he ſhall be certainely reſolued, one way or another. For euen as Rebecca knew certainely, by the ſtriuing and ſtirring of the twinnes in her wombe, that ſhe was conceiued and quicke of child; ſo Gods children know certainly, by the motions and ſtirring of the holy Ghoſt within them, that they haue conceiued Chriſt, and ſhall vndoubtedly be ſaued.
            
            
               Phila.
               I pray you, let vs come to the ground worke of this certaintie of ſaluation, and ſpeake ſomewhat of that.
            
            
               
               Theo.
               The ground-worke of our ſaluation is laide in Gods eternall election, and in reſpect thereof it ſtandeth faſt and vnmoueable; as it is written: The foundation of God ſtandeth faſt.
                  2. Tim. 2. 19. 1. Theſ. 5. 2. Tim. 2. 13. And againe: He is faithfull, that hath promiſed: though we cannot beleeue, yet he abideth faithfull. So then, as we know it certainely in our ſelues, by the conſequents of election; ſo it ſtandeth moſt firme in reſpect of God, and his eternall and immutable decrée. And a thouſand infirmities (nay all the ſinnes in the world, nor all the diuels in hell) cannot ouerthrow Gods election. For our Lord Jeſus ſaith; All that theIoh. 6. 37. Father hath giuen me, ſhall come vnto me. And againe: This is the Fathers will that hathIoh. 6. 39. ſent me: that of all which he hath giuen me, I ſhould loſe nothing: but ſhould raiſe it vp againe, at the laſt day. And in another place,Ioh. 10. 27. our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith; My ſheepe heare my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I giue vnto them eternall life, and they ſhall neuer periſh: neither ſhall any plucke them out of my hand. My Father which gaue them me, is greater then all; and none is able to take them out of my Fathers hand. Wée ought therefore to be as ſure of our ſaluation, as of any other thing which God hath promiſed, or which we are bound to beléeue. For to doubt thereof, in reſpect of Gods truth, is blaſphemous

againſt the immutability of his truth.
            
            
               Philag.
               But, are there not ſome doubts, at ſome times, euen in the very Elect, and in thoſe which are growen to the greateſt perſwaſion?
            
            
               Theol.
               Yes verily. For he that neuer doubted, neuer beléeued. For whoſoeuer beléeueth in truth, féeleth ſometimes doubtings and wauerings. Euen as the ſound body féeleth many grudgings of diſeaſes, which if hée hath not health, hée could not féele: ſo the ſound ſoule féeleth ſome doubtings: which if it were not ſound, it could not ſo eaſily féele. For wée féele not corruption, by corruption; but we féele corruption, by grace. And the more grace we haue, the more quicke are we in the féeling of corruption. Some men of tender ſkinnes, and quicke féeling, will eaſily féele the lighteſt feather, in ſofter manner laide vpon the ball of their hands; which others, of more ſlow féeling and hard fleſh, cannot ſo eaſily diſcerne. So then it is certaine, that although the children of God féele ſome doubtings, at ſometimes; yet the ſame doe no whit impeach the certainety of their ſaluation: but rather argue a perfect ſoundneſſe and health of their ſoules. For, when ſuch litle grudgings are felt in the ſoule, the childrē of God oppoſe againſt them the certaintie of Gods truth and promiſes: and ſo doe

eaſily ouercome them. For the Lords people néed no more to feare them, then he that rideth thorow the ſtréets vpon a luſty gelding with his ſword by his ſide, néeds to feare the barking and bawling of a few little curres and whappets.

               Theol.
               Euen as a man, ſet in the top of the higheſt ſtéeple in the world, and ſo faſt bound vnto it, that he cannot fall though he would; yet when hée looketh downeward, hee feareth, becauſe mans nature is not acquainted, nor accuſtomed to mount ſo high in the aire, and to behold the earth ſo farre beneath: but when he looketh vpward, and perceiueth himſelfe faſt bound, and out of all danger, then hée caſteth away all feare. Euen ſo when wée looke downeward to our ſelues, wée haue doubts and feares: but when wée looke vpward to Chriſt, and the truth of his promiſes, wée féele our ſelues cocke-ſure, and ceaſe to doubt any more.
            
            
               Phila.
               Declare vnto vs, what is the originall of theſe doubts and feares, and from whence they ſpring in the children of God.
            
            
               Theol.
               They ſpring from the imperfection of our regeneration, and from that ſtrife which

is in the very minde of the elect, betwéene faith and infidelity. For theſe two do mightily fight together in the moſt regenerate, and ſtriue to ouer maſter, and ouerſhadow one another. By reaſon wherof, ſometimes it commeth to paſſe, through the preuailing of vnbeliefe, that the moſt excellent ſeruants of God may fal into fits and pangs of deſpaire, as Iob and Dauid, in their temptations did. And euen in theſe daies alſo, ſome of Gods children at ſometimes are ſhrewdly handled this way, and brought very lowe; euen vnto deaths doore: but yet the Lord in great mercie doth recouer them, both from totall and finall deſpaire. Onely they are humbled and tried by theſe ſharpe fits, for a time, and that for their great good. For as we vſe to ſay, that an Ague in a young man is a ſigne of health: ſo theſe burning fits of temptations, in the elect, for the moſt part, are ſignes of Gods grace and fauor. For, if they were not of God, the diuell would neuer be ſo buſie with them.
            
            
               Phila.
               Is it not meere preſumption, and an ouermuch truſting to our ſelues, to bee perſwaded of our ſaluation?
            
            
               Theol.
               Nothing leſſe. For the ground of this perſwaſion is not laid in our ſelues, or any thing within vs, or without vs; but onely in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and the mercifull

promiſes of God. For, is it any preſumption for vs to beléeue that, which God hath promiſed, Chriſt hath purchaſed, and the holy Ghoſt hath ſealed? No verily, it is not any preſumption; but a thing which we all ſtand bound vnto, as we will anſwere it at the dreadfull day of iudgement. As for our ſelues, we do fréely confeſſe, that in Gods ſight we are but lumps of ſinne and maſſes of all miſery; and cannot of our ſelues mooue hand or foot to the furtherance of our ſaluation. But being iuſtified by faith, we are at peace with God, and fully perſwaded of his loue and fauour toward vs, in Chriſt.
            
            
               Phila.
               Cannot the Reprobates and vngodly be aſſured of their ſaluation?
            
            
               Theo.
               No. For the Prophet ſaith: There isEſay. 57. 22. no peace to the wicked. Then I reaſon thus: They which haue not the inward peace, cannot be aſſured. But the wicked haue not the inward peace. Therefore they cannot be aſſured. Stedfaſt faith in the promiſes doth aſſure. But the wicked haue not ſtedfaſt faith in the promiſes. Therefore they cannot be aſſured. The ſpirit of adoption doth aſſure. But the wicked haue not the ſpirit of adoption. Therefore they cannot be aſſured.
               To conclude, when a man féeleth in himſelfe an euill conſcience, blindneſſe, prophaneneſſe,

and diſobedience, he ſhal (in deſpite of his hart) ſing this dolefull ſong: I know not whether I ſhall be ſaued or damned.
            
            
               Phila.
               Is not the doctrine of the aſſurance of ſaluation, a moſt comfortable doctrine?
            
            
               Theol.
               Yes doubtleſſe. For except a man bée perſwaded of the fauour of God, and the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and conſequently of his ſaluation, what comfort can he haue in any thing? Beſides this, the perſwaſion of Gods loue towards vs, is the root of all our loue and chearefull obedience towards him. For therefore wée loue him and obey him, becauſe we know hée hath loued vs firſt, and written our names in the booke of life. But on the contrarie, the Doctrine of the Papiſts, which would haue men alwaies doubt and feare in a ſeruile ſort, is moſt helliſh and vncomfortable. For ſo long as a man holds that, what encouragement can he haue to ſerue God? What loue to his Maieſtie? What hope in the promiſes? What comfort in trouble? What patience in aduerſity?
            
            
               Antil.
               Touching this point, I am flat of your minde. For I thinke verily, a man ought to bee perſwaded of his ſaluation. And for mine owne part, I make no queſtion of it. I hope to bee ſaued, as well as the beſt of them all. I am out of feare for that. For I haue ſuch

a ſtedfaſt faith in God, that, if there ſhould be but two in the world ſaued, I hope I ſhould be one of them.
            
            
               Theol.
               You are very confident indéed. You are perſwaded before you know. I would your ground were as good, as your vaine confidence. But who is ſo bold as blinde Bayard? Your hope is but a fancie, and as a ſick mans dreame. You hope you can not tell what. You haue no ground for that you ſay. For, what hope can you haue to be ſaued, when you walke in no path of ſaluation? What hope can a man haue to come to London ſpéedily, that trauelleth nothing that way, but quite contrary? What hope can a man haue to reape a good crop of corne, that vſeth no meanes, neither ploweth, ſoweth, nor harroweth? What hope can a man haue to be fat and well liking of his body, that ſeldome or neuer eateth any meat? What hope can a man haue to eſcape drowning, which leapeth into the Sea? Euen ſo, what hope can you haue to be ſaued, when you walke nothing that way, when you vſe no meanes, when you doe all things that are contrary vnto the ſame? For, alas, there is nothing in you of thoſe things, which the Scriptures doe affirme muſt bée, in all thoſe that ſhall be ſaued. There be none of the fore▪ named ſignes and tokens in you. You are ignorant, prophane and

careleſſe. God is not worſhipped vnder your roofe. There is no true feare of God in your ſelfe nor in your houſhold. You ſeldome heare the word preached. You content your ſelfe with an ignorant Miniſter. You haue no praiers in your family, no reading, no ſinging of pſalmes, no inſtructions, exhortations, or admonitions, or any other Chriſtian exerciſes. You make no conſcience of the obſeruation of the Sabbaths; you vſe not the name of God with any reuerence; you breake out ſometimes into horrible dathes and curſings; you make an ordinary matter of ſwearing by your faith, & your troth. Your wife is irreligious, your children diſſolute and vngratious, your ſeruants prophane & careleſſe. You are an example in your owne houſe of al Atheiſme, and conſcienceles behauiour. You are a great gameſter, a rioter, a ſpendthrift, a drinker, a common ale-houſe-haunter, an whoore hunter; and, to conclude, giuen to all vice and naughtineſſe. Now then, I pray you tell me, or rather let your conſcience tell mée, what hope you can haue to be ſaued, ſo long as you walk and continue in this courſe? Doth not S. Iohn ſaie; If wee ſay wee haue fellowſhip1. Ioh. 1. 6. with him, and walke in darkeneſſe, we are liers? Doth not the ſame Apoſtle auouch, that1. Ioh. 2. 4. ſuch as ſay they know God, and kéepe not his commandements, are liers?
               
                  Againe doth he not ſay: Heth at committeth1. Ioh. 3. 8. 10. ſin, is of the Diuell; And whoſoeuer doth not righteouſneſſe, is not of God? Doth not our Lord Jeſus flatly tell the Jewes (which bragged that Abraham was their father) that they were of their father the diuell: becauſe they did his works? Doth not the Apoſtle Paul ſay; HisRom 6. 16. ſeruants we are, to whom we obey; whether it be of ſin, vnto death, or of obedience, vnto righteouſnes? Doth not the ſcripture ſay; Hee thatIoh. 3. 7. doth righteouſneſſe, is righteous? Doth not our Lord Jeſus affirme: that nor euery one thatMat. 7. 21. ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdome of heauen; but he that doth the will of my father which is in Heauen? Therefore I conclude: that, foraſmuch as your whole courſe is carnall, careleſſe, and diſſolute, you can haue no warrantable hope to be ſaued.
            
            
               Phila.
               I doe verily thinke, that this mans caſe (which now you haue laied open) is the caſe of thouſands.
            
            
               Theo.
               Yea, doubtles (of thouſand thouſands) the more is the pity.
            
            
               Aſune.
               Soft and faire, ſir, you are very round indeed. Soft fire maketh ſweet mault. I hope you know wee muſt be ſaued by mercy: and not by merit. If I ſhould doe all my ſelfe, wherefore ſerueth Chriſt? I hope that which I cannot doe, hee will doe for me. And I hope

to be ſaued by Ieſus Chriſt as well as the beſt of you all.
            
            
               Theol.
               Oh, now I ſée which way the game goeth. You would faine make Chriſt a cloake for your ſinnes. You will ſinne, that grace may abound. You will ſinne frankly, and ſet all vpon Chriſts ſcore. Truely there be many thouſands of your minde, which, hearing of Gods abundant mercie in Chriſt, are thereby made more bold to ſin. But they ſhall know one day, to their coſt, what it is ſo to abuſe the mercie of God. The Apoſtle ſaith: The mercy and louingRom. 2. kindneſſe of God ſhould leade vs to repentance. But we ſée, it leadeth manie to further hardneſſe of heart. The Prophet ſaith: With him is mercy, that hee may bee feared. But many thereby are made more ſecure and careleſſe. But to come néerer the marke: you ſay, you hope to be ſaued by Jeſus Chriſt. And I anſwer: that if thoſe things be found in you, which the Scriptures do auouch to be in all that ſhall be ſaued by him, then you may haue good9. Things required of all that ſhall be ſaued by Chriſt. 2. Cor. 5. 17. 1. Pet. 4. 2. confidence, and aſſured hope: otherwiſe not. Now the Scriptures do thus determine it, and ſet it downe: That if a man bée in Chriſt, and looke to be ſaued by him, he muſt be indued with theſe qualities following:

                     Firſt he muſt be a new creature.
                     Secondly, hee muſt liue, not after the luſts of

men: but after the will of God.
                     Thirdly, he muſt be zealous of good works.Tit 2. 14. Rom. 6. 14.
                     
                     Fourthly, hee muſt die to ſinne, and liue to righteouſneſſe.
                     Fiftly, he muſt be holy and vnblameable.
                     Sixtly, he muſt ſo walke, as Chriſt hath walked.Col. 1. 22. Iohn 2. 6. Gal. 5. 24.
                     
                     Seuenthly, hee muſt crucifie the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.
                     Eigthly, he muſt walke, not after the fleſh, butRom. 8. 1. after the ſpirit.
                     Laſt of all, he muſt ſerue God in righteouſneſſeLuke. 1. 75. and true holineſſe, all the daies of his life.
                  
               
               Loe then what things are required of all that ſhalbe ſaued by Chriſt. Now therefore, if theſe things be in you in ſome meaſure of tenth, then your hope is currant, ſound, & good: otherwiſe, it is nothing worth. For in vaine doe men ſay, they hope to be ſaued by Chriſt, when as they walke diſſolutely. The reaſon hereof is: becauſe the members muſt be ſutable to the head. But Chriſt our head is holy: therfore we his members muſt be holy alſo; as it is written: Be ye1. Pet. 1. 16. holy, for I am holy. Otherwiſe, if we will ioine prophane & vnholy members to our holy head Chriſt, then we make Chriſt a monſter. As if a man ſhould ioyne vnto the head of a Lion, the necke of a Beare, the body of a Wolfe, and the legges of a Foxe: were it not a monſtrous thing: would it not make a monſtrous creature?

Euen ſuch a thing doe they goe about, which would haue Swearers, Drunkards, Whoremongers, and ſuch like, to be the members of Chriſt, and to haue life and ſaluation by him. But ſith you doe ſo much preſume of Chriſt, I pray you let mée aſke you a queſtion.
            
            
               Antil.
               What is that?
            
            
               Theol.
               How doe you know that Chriſt died for you particularly, and by name?
            
            
               Antile.
               Chriſt died for all men, and therefore for me.
            
            
               Theol.
               But, all men ſhall not bée ſaued by Chriſt. How therefore doe you know that you are one of them that haue ſpeciall intereſt in Chriſt, and ſhall be ſaued by his death?
            
            
               Antil.
               This I know that we are all ſinners, and cannot be ſaued by any other then by Chriſt.
            
            
               Theol.
               Anſwer directly to my queſtion. How doe you know in your ſelfe, and for your ſelfe, that you are one of the Elect, and one of thoſe, for whom Chriſt died?
            
            
               Antil.
               I know it, by my good faith in God: becauſe I put my whole truſt in him, and in none other.
            
            
               Theol.
               But, how know you, that you haue faith? or how ſhall a man know his faith?
            
            
               Antile.
               I know it by this; that I haue alwaies had as good a meaning, and as good a faith to Godward as any man of my calling, and that is

not booke-learned. I haue alwaies feared God with all my heart, and ſerued him with my praiers.
            
            
               Theol.
               Tuſh: now you goe about the buſh, and houer in the aire. Anſwer me to the point. How doe you know certainely and aſſuredly, that Chriſt died for you particularly & by name.
            
            
               Antil.
               You would make a man mad. You put me out of my faith: you driue mee from Chriſt. But if you go about to driue mee from Chriſt, I will neuer beleeue you. For I know wee muſt be ſaued onely by him.
            
            
               Theo.
               I go not about to driue you frō Chriſt, but to driue you to Chriſt. For how can I driue you from Chriſt, ſeeing you neuer came néere him? How can I driue you out of Chriſt, ſéeing you were neuer in him? But this is it, that deceiueth you, & many others; that you think you beléeue in Chriſt, becauſe you ſay you beléeue in Chriſt. As though faith conſiſted in words: or, as though a man had faith, becauſe he ſaith ſo, If euery one that ſaith he hath faith, therefore hath faith: & euery one that ſaith he beléeueth in Chriſt, doth therefore beléeue: then who wil not haue faith? who will not beléeue? But in very déed, your faith, and the faith of many others, is nothing elſe but a méere imagination. But all this while, you haue not anſwered my queſtiō, touching your particular knowledge of Chriſt.
            
            
               
               Antile.
               I can anſwer you no otherwiſe then I haue anſwered you. And I thinke I haue anſwered you ſufficiently.
            
            
               Theol.
               No, no; you faulter in your ſpéech: your anſwer is not worth a button, you ſpeake you wot not what, you are altogether befogd and benighted in this queſtion. But, if there were in your heart the true knowledge, & liuely féeling of God, then I am ſure you would haue yéelded another, and a better anſwer. Then you would haue ſpoken ſomething from the ſenſe and féeling of your owne heart & from the worke of Gods grace within you: but becauſe you can yéeld no ſound reaſon, that Chriſt died for you particularly, and by name; therefore I ſuſpect you are none of them which haue proper intereſt in him, and in whom his death taketh effect indéed.
            
            
               Phila.
               I thinke this queſtion would grauell a great number: and few there be that can anſwer it aright.
            
            
               Theol.
               It is moſt certaine. I doe know it by lamentable experience, that not one of an hundred can ſoundly and ſufficiently anſwer this queſtion: none, indéed, but only thoſe, in whom the new worke is wrought, & do by the inward worke of the ſpirit féele Chriſt to be theirs. I haue talked with ſome, which are both witty, ſenſible, and learned: who notwithſtanding

when they haue been broght to this very point and iſſue, haue ſtucke ſore at it, & ſtaggred very much. And howſoeuer they might by wit and learning ſhuffle it ouer, and in a plundred ſort, ſpeake reaſon: yet had they no feeling of that which they ſaid, and therfore no aſſurance: and conſequently as good neuer a whit, as neuer the better. It is the ſanctifying ſpirit, that giueth féeling in this point. And therefore, without the féeling of the operation of the ſame ſpirit, it can neuer be ſoundly anſwered. Thus then, I doe cloſe vp this whole matter: As the vinebrauch cannot liue and bring forth fruit, except it abide in the Ume: no more can wée, except we abide in Chriſt, and be truely grafted into him by a liuely faith. None can haue any benefit by him, but they only which dwel in him. None can liue by Chriſt, but they which are changed into Chriſt. None are partakers of his body, but they which are in his body. None can be ſaued by Chriſt crucified, but they which are crucified with Chriſt. None can liue with him béeing dead, but thoſe which die with him béeing aliue. Therefore let vs root down-ward in mortification, that we may ſhoot vpward in ſanctification. Let vs die to ſinne, that we may liue to righteouſneſſe: Let vs die while we are aliue, that we may liue when we are dead.
            
            
               Aſune.
               If none can be ſaued by Chriſt, but

onely thoſe which are ſo qualified as you ſpeake of, then Lord haue mercy vpon vs: then the way to heauen is very ſtraight indeed, and few at all ſhall be ſaued. For there be few ſuch in the world.
            
            
               Theo.
               You are no whit therein deceiued. For when all comes to all, it is moſt certaine, that few ſhal be ſaued. Which thing I wil ſhew vnto you, both by ſcripture, reaſon, and examples.
            
            
               Aſune.
               Firſt then, let vs heare it proued by the ſcriptures.

               Our Lord Jeſus ſaith: Enter in at theMat. 7. 1. ſtraight gate. For, it is the wide gate and broad way that leadeth to deſtruction: and many there be which goe in thereat: becauſe the gate is ſtrait, and the way narrow that leadeth vnto life, & few there be that find it. Againe he ſaith, Many are called, but few are choſen. In anotherMat. 20. 16. place, we read of a certaine man which came to our ſauiour Chriſt, & aſked him of purpoſe whether few ſhould be ſaued. To whō our Lord Jeſus anſwered thus: Striue to enter in at the ſtraight gate. For many (I ſay vnto you)Luk. 13. 14. will ſeeke to enter in, and ſhall not be able. In which anſwer, albeit our Sauiour doth not anſwer directly to his queſtion, either negatiuely or affirmatiuely; yet doth he plainely inſinuate by his ſpéeches, that few ſhall bee ſaued. For firſt he bids vs ſtriue earneſtly: noting therby,

that it is a matter of great ſtrife againſt the world, the fleſh, and the diuell. Secondly, he affirmeth, that the gate is very ſtraight: noting, that none can enter in, without vehemēt crowding, and almoſt breaking their ſhoulder bones. Laſtly, he ſaith; that many which ſéeke to enter in, ſhall not be able: noting thereby, that euen of them that ſéeke, many ſhall ſtep ſhort; becauſe they ſeeke him not aright. Eſaias alſo ſaith: Except the Lord of Hoſts had left vs aEſay. 1. 9. ſeed, we had beene as Sodome, and had beene like to omorrha.
                   The Apoſtle alſo alle agethEſay. 10. 22. Rom. 9. 28. out of the Prophet: That the Lord will make a ſhort account in the earth, and gather it into a ſhort ſumme, with righteouſneſſe. Theſe ſcriptures, I thinke, are ſufficient to proue that few ſhall be ſaued.
            
            
               
                  Aſune. Now let vs heare your reaſons.
            
            
               Theol.
               If we come to reaſon, wée may rather wonder that any ſhould bée ſaued, then ſo few ſhall be ſaued. For, wée haue all the lets and hindrances that may bée, both within vs and without vs. Wée haue (as they ſay) the Sunne, Moone, and ſeuen Starres againſt vs. Wée haue all the Diuels in Hell againſt vs, with all their hornes, heads, maruellous ſtrength, infinite wiles, cunning deuices, déepe ſleights, and methodicall temptations. Héere runnes a ſore ſtreame againſt vs. Then haue

wée this preſent euill world againſt vs, with her innumerable baits, ſnares, nets, gins, and grins to catch vs, fetter vs, and entangle vs. Héere haue wée profits and pleaſures, riches and honour, wealth and preferment, ambition and couetouſneſſe. Héere comes in a Campe royall of ſpirituall and inuiſible enemies. Laſtly, wée haue our fleſh, that is, our corrupted nature againſt vs: wée haue our ſelues againſt our ſelues. For we our ſelues are as great enemies to our ſaluation, as either the world, or the Diuell. For, our vnderſtanding, reaſon, will, and affections, are altogether againſt vs. Our naturall wiſedome is an enemy vnto vs. Our concupiſences & luſts do miniſter ſtrength to ſathans temptations. They are all in league with Sathan againſt vs. They take part with him in euery thing againſt vs and our ſaluation. They fight all vnder his ſtandard, and receiue their pay of him. This then goeth hard on our ſide, that the Diuell hath an inward party againſt vs: and wée carry alwaies within vs our greateſt enemy, which is euer ready, night and day, to betray vs into the hands of Sathan; yea to vnbelt the dore, and let him in to cut our throats. Here then we ſée an huge army of dreadfull enemies, and a very legion of Diuels, lying in ambuſh againſt our ſoules. Are not wée therefore poore wretches in a

moſt pitifull caſe, which are thus betraied and beſieged on euery ſide? All things then conſidered, may wée not iuſtly maruell, that any ſhall bée ſaued? For who ſeeth not, who knoweth not, that thouſand thouſands are caried headlong to deſtruction; either with the temptations of the world, the fleſh or the Diuell? But yet further, I will ſhew, by an other verie manifeſt and apparant reaſon, that the number of Gods Elect vpon the face of the earth, are very few in compariſon: which may thus bée conſidered. Firſt, let there bée taken away from amongſt vs all Papiſts, Atheiſts, and Heretikes. Secondly, let there bée ſhoaled out all vicious and notorious euill liuers; as Swearers, Drunkards, Whooremongers, Worldlings, deceiuers, couſeners, proud men, Rioters, gameſters, and all the prophane multitude. Thirdly, let there be refuſed and ſorted out all Hypocrites, carnall Proteſtants, vaine profeſſors, backeſliders, decliners, and colde Chriſtians. Let all theſe, I ſay, bée ſeparated: and then tell mée, how many ſound, ſincere, faithfull, and zealous worſhippers of God, will bée found among vs. I ſuppoſe, wée ſhould not néed the Arte of Arithmetike to number them. For I thinke, there would bée very few in euery Uillage, Towne, and Citie; I doubt, they would walke very

thinly in the ſtréets: ſo as a man might eaſily tell them as they goe. Our Lord Jeſus aſketh a queſtion in the Goſpell of S. Luke, ſaying: Doe you thinke, when the Sonne of man commeth,Luk. 18. 8. that he ſhall finde faith on the earth? To the which we may anſwer, Surely very little.
            
            
               Aſune.
               Now, according to your promiſe, ſhew this thing alſo, by examples.
            
            
               Theol.
               In the firſt age of the world, all fleſh had ſo corrupted their waies, that God could no longer beare them; but euen vowed their deſtruction, by the ouerflowing of waters. When the floud came, how few were found faithfull? Eight perſons onely were ſaued by the Arke. How few righteous were found in Sodome, and the Cities adioyning; but one poore Lot, and his family? How few beleeuers were found in Iericho; but one Rahab? How few of the old Iſraelites entred into the Land of Promiſe; but two, Caleb and Ioſuah? TheHeb. 3. 19. reſt could not enter in, becauſe of vnbeliefe. The true and inuiſible Church was ſmall, during the gouernment of the Judges: as appeareth plentifully in that booke. In Elias time, the church was ſo ſmall, that it did not appeare. In the raigne of the Kings of Iſrael and Iudah,
                  1. Kin. 17. the ſincere worſhippers were very few: as appeareth by all the Prophets. During the captiuity, the Church was as the Moone voder a

cloud, ſhée was driuen into the Wilderneſſe, where ſhée hid her ſelfe. During the perſecutions of the Greeke Empire, by Gog, Magog, and Egypt, they were feweſt of all. In Chriſts time, what a ſilly company did hée beginne withall! How were all things corrupted by the Prieſts, Scribes, and Phariſies! In the beginning of the Apoſtles preaching, there were few beléeuers. After the firſt ſix hundreth yeares, what an eclipſe was in the Church, during the height of Antichriſts raigne! How few true worſhippers of God were in the world, for the ſpace of▪ almoſt ſeuen hundred yéeres! Since the Goſpell was broached and ſpread abroade, how few doe beléeue! And as the Prophet ſaith;Eſay. 53. 1. 
                  Lord who hath beleeued our report? Thus thē you ſée, it is apparant (both by Scripture, reaſon, and examples of all ages) that the number of the Elect is very ſmall: and when all comes to all, few ſhalbe ſaued.
            
            
               Phil.
               I pray you tell vs, how few, and to what ſcantling they may be reduced: whether one of an hundred, or one of a thouſand, ſhalbe ſaued?
            
            
               Theol.
               No man knoweth that: neither can I giue you any direct and certaine anſwer vnto it. But I ſay, that, in compariſon of the Reprobate, there ſhall bée but a few ſaued. For, all that profeſſe the Goſpell are not the true Church, before God. There bée many in

the Church, which are not of the Church.

               Out of the ninth to the Romans: where the Apoſtle ſaith: All are not Iſrael, that are ofRom. 9. 6. Iſrael. And againe, Eſaias crieth, concerning Iſrael: Though the number of the children ofRom. 9. 27 Iſrael were as the ſand of the ſea, yet but a remnant ſhall be ſaued.

               How doe you ballance it in the viſible Church: or in what compariſon do you take it? Let vs heare ſome eſtimate of it. Some thinke, one of a hundred; ſome but one of a thouſand ſhall be ſaued.
            
            
               Theol.
               Indéed I haue heard ſome learned and godly Diuines giue ſuch coniectures: but for that matter, I can ſay nothing to it. ButRom. 9. 27. onely let vs obſerue the compariſon of the holy Ghoſt betwixt a remnant, and the ſand of the ſea, and it will giue ſome light into the matter.
            
            
               Phila.
               Doth not the knowledge of this doctrine diſcourage men from ſeeking after God?
            
            
               Theol.
               Nothing leſſe. But rather it ought to awake vs, and ſtirre vp in vs a greater care of our ſaluation, that we may be of the number of Chriſts little flocke, which make an end ofPhil. 2. 12. their ſaluation in feare and trembling.
            
            
               Phila.
               Some make light of all theſe matters. Others ſay; As for the life to come, that is the

leaſt matter of an hundred to be cared for. As for that matter, they will leaue vnto God, euen as pleaſeth him, they will not meddle with it. For they ſay, God that made them, muſt ſaue them. They hope they ſhal do as well as others, and make as good ſhift as their neighbours.
            
            
               Theol.
               It is lamentable, that men ſhould be ſo careleſſe, and make ſo light of that, which (of all other things) is moſt waighty and important. For, it ſhall not profit a man to win theMath. 16. 2. whole world, and loſe his owne ſoule, as the authour of all wiſedome teſtifieth.

               I pray you Sir vnder correction, giue me leaue to ſpeake my minde, in this point. I am an ignorant man: pardon me, if I ſpeake amiſſe. For a fooles bolt is ſoone ſhot.
            
            
               Theol.

               I doe verily thinke, that God is ſtronger then the diuell. Therefore I cannot beleeue that he will ſuffer the Diuell to haue moe then himſelfe. He will not take it at his hands. Hee loueth mankind better then ſo.
            
            
               Theol.
               You doe carnally imagine, that God will wreſtle and ſtriue with the diuel about the matter. As for Gods power, it doth neuer croſſe his will. For God can doe nothing againſt his will and decrée, becauſe he will not.

               Yea but the Scripture ſaith, God will haue all men ſaued.
            
            
               
               Theol.
               That is not meant of euery particular man, but of all ſorts ſome. Some Iewes, ſome Gentiles, ſome rich, ſome poore, ſome high, ſome lowe, &c.

               Chriſt died for all: therefore all ſhall be ſaued.
            
            
               Theol.
               Chriſt died for all, in the ſufficiency of his death: but not in efficacy, vnto life. For onely the Elect ſhall bée ſaued by his death. As it is written; This is my bloud in the new Teſtament,Luke 22. 20. which is giuen for you: meaning his Diſciples, and choſen Children. And againe, Chriſt béeing conſecrated, is made the author ofHeb. 5. 9. ſaluation, to all that obey him.
            
            
               Aſune.
               God is mercifull, and therfore I hope he will ſaue the greateſt part, for his mercy ſake.
            
            
               Theol.
               The greateſt part ſhall periſh: but all that ſhalbe ſaued, ſhalbe ſaued by his mercy. AsRom 9. it is written; He will haue mercy on whom he will haue mercy: And whom he will he hardneth. And againe: It is not in him that willeth,Rom. 9. or in him that runneth: but in God, that ſheweth mercy. Therefore, though God be infinite in mercy, and Chriſt infinite in merit, yet none ſhall haue mercy, but onely the veſſels of mercy.

               Can you tell who ſhall be ſaued, and who ſhall be damned? Do you know Gods ſecrets? When were you in Heauen? When

ſpake you with God? I am of the mind that all men ſhall be ſaued. For Gods mercy is aboue all his works. Say you what you will, and what you can, God did not make vs, to condemne vs.
            
            
               Theol.
               You are very peremptory indéed: you are more bold then wiſe: for Chriſt ſaith, few ſhall be ſaued: you ſay, all ſhall be ſaued. Whether then ſhall we beléeue Chriſt or you?

               They would ſay, there be few in heauen, and many in hell: heauen is empty, and hell is full.

               Becauſe the word of God ſaith ſo. Becauſe Moyſes and the Prophets ſay ſo. If

               I pray you let me aſke you a queſtion. Whether doe you thinke, that God and his word, or the ſoules of dead men are more to be credited?

               You ſhew your ſelfe to be a notable Infidell. You wil not beleeue Gods word, without ſignes and miracles, and wonders from the dead.
            
            
               Antile.
               You ſpeake, as though you knew certainely, that hell is full. You doe but ſpeake at randome: you cannot tell: you were neuer there to ſee. But for mine owne part, I beleeue there is no hell at all, but onely the hell of a mans conſcience.
            
            
               Theol.
               Now you ſhew your ſelfe in kinde what you are. You ſay, you beléeue no hell at all. And I think, if you were wel examined, you beléeue no heauen at all neither God nor diuell.

               Theol.
               Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh. You haue ſufficiently bewraied your heart by your words. For the tongue is the key of the minde. As for iudging, I iudge you onely by your fruits: which is lawfull. For wée may iuſtly ſay, It is a bad trée which bringeth foorth bad fruit; and he that doth wickedly, is a wicked man. But it is you, and ſuch as you are, that wil take vpon you to iudge mens hearts. For, though a mans outward actions be religious and honeſt, yet you will condemne him. And, if a man giue himſelfe to the word and praier, reformeth his family, and abſtaineth from the groſſe ſinnes of the world, you will by and by ſay, he is an hypocrite. And thus you take vpon you to iudge mens hearts, as though you knew with what affection theſe things are done.

               I confeſſe, I am a ſinner: and ſo are all other for ought I know. There is no man, but he may be amended. I pray God ſend vs

all of his grace, that we may pleaſe him, and get to heauen at laſt.
            
            
               Theol.
               Now you would ſhuffle vp all together, as though you were as good as the beſt, and as though there were no difference of ſinners: but you muſt learne to know, that there is great difference of ſinners. For there is the penitent, and the vnpenitent ſinner; the carefull, and the careleſſe ſinner; the ſinner whoſe ſinnes are not imputed, and the ſinner whoſe ſinnes are imputed; the ſinner that ſhall bée ſaued, and the ſinner that ſhall bée damned. For it is one thing to ſinne of frailty, another thing to liue in it, dwell in it, and trade in it, and (as the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh) to ſucke it in, as theEſay. 5. 18. fiſh ſucketh water, and to draw it vnto vs with cart-ropes and cords of vanity.
               To conclude therefore, there is as great difference betwixt a ſinner, and a ſinner, as betwixt light and darkeneſſe. For, though Gods children be ſinners, in reſpect of the remnants of ſin within them, yet the Scriptures call them iuſt and righteous: becauſe they are iuſtified by Chriſt, and ſanctified by his grace and holy ſpirit. And, for this cauſe, it is, that S. Iohn ſaith,1. Ioh. 3. 6. He that is borne of God ſinneth not.

               Yes, and what then? what are you the better?

               You Preachers cannot agree amongſt your ſelues. One ſaith one thing, and another ſaith another thing: ſo that you bring the ignorant people into a mammering: and they know not on which hand to take.
            
            
               Theol.
               The Preachers, God bée thanked, agrée very well together, in all the maine grounds of religion, and principall points of ſaluation. But, if they diſſent in ſome other matters, you are to trie the ſpirits, whether they be of God or no. You muſt try all things, and kéepe that which is good.

               How can plaine and ſimple men trie the ſpirits and doctrines of the Preachers?
            
            
               Theol.
               Yes. For the Apoſtle ſaith: The ſpirituall1. Cor. 2. 15. 1. Ioh. 2. 26. man diſcerneth all things. And S. Iohn ſaith to the holy Chriſtians: You haue receiued an ointment from that holy one, and know all things; that is, all things neceſſary to ſaluation. Thoſe therefore which haue the ſpirit of God, can iudge and diſcerne of doctrines, whether they be of God or no.
            
            
               Antile.
               I am not booke-learned: and therefore I cannot iudge of ſuch matters. As for hearing of Sermons, I haue no leaſure to goe to them: I haue ſomewhat elſe to doe. Let them that are bookiſh, and heare ſo many Sermons, iudge of ſuch matters. For I will not meddle with them, they belong not vnto me.
            
            
               
               Theol.
               Yet for all that, you ought to reade the Scriptures, and heare the word of God preached, that you may bée able to diſcerne betwixt truth and falſhood in matters of religion.
            
            
               Antile.
               Belike you thinke none can be ſaued without Preaching; and that all men ſtand bound to frequent Sermons; but I am not of your mind in that.
            
            
               Theol.
               Our Lord Jeſus ſaith; My ſheepeIoh. 10. 27. Ioh. 8. 47. heare my voice. And againe he ſaith; He that is of God, heareth Gods word. Yee therefore heare it not; becauſe you are not of God. You ſee therefore how Chriſt Jeſus maketh it a ſpeciall note of Gods child, to heare his word preached.
            
            
               Antile.
               But I thinke, we may ſerue God well enough without a Preacher. For, Preachers are but men; and what can they doe? A Preacher is a good man, ſo long as he is in the Pulpit; but if he be out of the Pulpit, he is but as another man.

But the Apoſtle doth fully anſwer your obiection, ſaying: Faith commeth by hearing, and hearingRom. 10. by the word of God; and how can they heare without a Preacher? In which words, the Apoſtle telleth you flatly, that you can neither haue faith, nor ſerue God aright, without preaching.

               When you haue Preached all that you can, you can make the word of God no better then it is: and ſome put in and put out what they liſt. The Scriptures are but mens inuentions: and they made the Scriptures.
            
            
               Theol.
               We preach not to make the Word better, but to make you better. As for putting in and putting out, it is a méere vntruth. And whereas you ſay, the ſcriptures were made by men, it is blaſphemy once to thinke it: and you are worthy to receiue your anſwer at Tiburne.

               Now I ſee you are hot. I perceiue, for all your godlineſſe, you will be angry.
            
            
               Theol.
               I take it to be no ſinne to be angry againſt ſinne. For your ſinne is very great: and who can beare it?

               All this while you ſpeake much for Preaching: but you ſay nothing for Praier. I thinke there is as much neede of Praier, as Preaching. For, I finde in the Scriptures, Pray continually; but I finde not, Preach continually.
            
            
               Theol.
               No man denieth, but that praier is moſt néedfull, alwaies to be ioyned vnto preaching & al other holy exerciſes: for it is the handmaid to all. But yet we prefer preaching aboue it, becauſe preaching is both the directour and whetſtone of praier: yea, it ſtirreth vs aright in

all ſpirituall actions and ſeruices whatſoeuer: without the which wée can kéepe no certaine courſe, but are euer ready to erre on this hand, or that. Now, whereas you ſay, you find Pray continually, but not Preach continually: you might (if you were not wilfully blinde) finde alſo, Preach continually. For the Apoſtle ſaith to Timothy, Be inſtant: Preach the word in ſeaſon,2. Tim. 3. 2. and out of ſeaſon:
                   that is, alwaies; as time and occaſion ſhall ſerue.

               You extoll preaching: but you ſay nothing for reading. I beleeue, you condemne reading.
            
            
               Theol.
               Doth hée that highly commendeth gold, condemne ſiluer? I do ingenuouſly confeſſe, that both publike and priuate reading of the ſcriptures, are very neceſſary and profitable, and would to God, it were more vſed, then it is. For, it is of ſingular vſe, both to increaſe knowledge and iudgement, and alſo to make vs more fit to heare the word preached. For, ſuch men, as are altogether ignorant of the Hiſtory of the bible, can heare the word with ſmall profit or comfort.

               Truly, Sir, you may thinke of me what you pleaſe. But I aſſure you, I haue more care that way, then all the world wonders at: I thanke God for it. I ſay my praiers euery night when I am in my bed. And if good praiers will do vs no good, God helpe vs. I haue alwaies ſerued God duely and truely, and had him in my minde. I do as I would be done to. I keepe my Church, and tend my praiers while I am there. And, I hope, I am not ſo bad as this fellow would make me. I am ſure, if I be bad, I am not the worſt in the world: there be as bad as I. If I goe to hell, I ſhall haue fellowes, and make as good ſhift as others.

And ſecondly, you iuſtifie your ſelfe by compariſon with others; becauſe others are as bad as you, and you are not the worſt in the world.

               I would I could haue as good an opinion of you, as I deſire; and that I might ſée that wrought in you, which might

               I hope I may repent. For the ſcripture ſaith: At what time ſoeuer a ſinner doth repent, God will haue mercy on him. Therefore if I may haue ſpace and grace, and time to repent before death, and to aske God forgiueneſſe, and ſay my praiers, and cry God mercie, I hope I ſhall doe well enough.
            
            
               Theol.
               You ſpeake as though repentance were in your power, and at your commandement, and that you can put it into your owne heart when you liſt; and that makes you, and many others preſume of it, thrée houres before death. But you muſt know that repentance is the rare gift of God: and it is giuen but to a few. For God will know him well that hée beſtoweth repentance vpon, ſith it is proper onely to the Elect. It is no word matter. It is not attained without many & feruent praiers, & much hearing, reading, and meditating in the word of God. It is not ſo eaſie a matter to come by, as the world iudgeth. It is not found but of them that ſeeke it diligently, and begge it earneſtly. It is no ordinarie thrée

houres matter. Crie God mercie a little for faſhion will not doe it. Courſarie ſaying of a few prayers a little before death auaileth not. For, though true repentance be neuer too late, yet late repentance is ſeldome true. Héerein delayes are dangerous; for the longer we deferre it, the woorſe is our caſe. The further a naile is driuen in with an hammer, the harder it is to get out againe. The longer a diſeaſe is let runne, the harder it is to cure. The déeper a trée is rooted, the harder it is to plucke vp againe. The longer we deferre the time of our repentance, the harder it will be to repent; and therefore it is dangerous driuing it off to the laſt caſt. For an ancient Father ſayth:Auguſtine. 
                  We reade but of one that repented at the laſt, that no man ſhould preſume: and yet of one, that none might deſpaire.
               
               Well then, to conclude this point, I would haue you to know, that the preſent time is alwayes the time of repentance. For, time paſt can not be recouered, and time to come is vncerteine.
            
            
               Antile.
               Sir, in mine opinion, you haue vttered ſome very dangerous things, and ſuch as were enough to driue a man to deſpaire.
            
            
               Theol.
               What be they, I pray you?
            
            
               Antile.
               There be diuers things. But one thing doth moſt of all ſticke in my ſtomacke,

and that is, the ſmall number that ſhall be ſa ued, as you ſay. But I can hardly be perſwaded that God made ſo many thouſands to caſt them away when he hath done. Do you thinke that God hath made vs, to condemne vs? Will you make him to be the authour of condemnation?
            
            
               Theol.
               Nothing leſſe. For God is not the cauſe of mens condemnation, but themſelues. For euery mans deſtruction commeth of himſelfe: as it is written: O Iſrael, thy deſtruction is of thy ſelfe. As for God, he doth (in greatHoſ. 13. mercie) vſe all poſſible meanes to ſaue ſoules; as hée ſayth by the Prophet: What could IEſa. 5. 4. haue done more to my vineyard, that I haue not done vnto it? But to come néerer to your queſtion. I denie, that God hath created the moſt part of men onely and ſolely vnto perdition, as the proper end which he did aime at in creating them: but hée hath created all things for the praiſe of his glorie; as it is written: Hee hath created all things for himſelfe;Pro. 16. 4. and the wicked alſo for the euill day. Then it followeth, that the cauſe and end why the wicked were created, neither was, nor is the onely deſtruction of his creature, but his owne praiſe and glorie; that that onely might appeare and ſhine foorth in all his works. Yet certeins it is, that God, for iuſt cauſes (albeit

vnknowen and hidde to vs) hath reiected a great part of men. The cauſes, I ſay, of reprobation are hid in the eternall counſell of God, and knowen to his godly wiſdome only. They are ſecret and hid from vs; reſerued in his eternall wiſdome to be reuealed at the glorious appearing of our Lord Jeſus. His iudgements
                  Pſal. 36. Rom. 11. (ſaith the Scripture) are as a great deepe, and his wayes paſt finding out. It is as poſſible for vs to comprehend the Ocean ſea in a little diſh, as to comprehend the reaſon of Gods counſell in this behalfe.
            
            
               Antile.
               What reaſon, iuſtice, or equitie is there, that ſentence of death ſhould be paſſed vpon men before they be borne, and before they haue done good or euill?
            
            
               Theol.
               I tolde you before, that we can neuer comprehend the reaſon of Gods procéeding in this behalfe: yet we muſt know that his will is the rule of righteouſneſſe, and muſt be vnto vs in ſtead of a thouſand reaſons. For whatſoeuer God willeth, in as much as hée willeth it, is to be holden iuſt. We cannot conceiue the reaſon of many naturall things, and things ſubiect to ſenſe; as, the motion of the celeſtiall bodies, their vnconceiueable ſwiftneſſe, their matter and ſubſtance, their magnitude, altitude, and latitude. We can not thorowly finde out the cauſes of the thunder,

lightning, windes, earth-quakes, ebbing and flowing of the ſea, and many other things vnder the Sunne: how then can we poſſibly aſcend vp into the priuy chamber and counſellhouſe of God, to ſift and ſearch out the bottome of Gods ſecrets; which no wit or reach of man can any way attaine vnto! Let vs therefore learne in Gods feare to reuerence that which we can not in this life comprehend.
               This one thing I muſt ſay vnto you, that whatſoeuer God decréeth, yet doth he execute no man, till he haue ten thouſand times deſerued it. For, betwixt the decrée and the execution thereof, commeth ſinne in vs, and moſt iuſt cauſes of condemnation.
            
            
               Antil.
               If God haue decreed mens deſtruction, what can they do withall? who can reſiſt his will? why then is he angrie with vs? For all things muſt needs come to paſſe according to his decree and determination.
            
            
               Theol.
               Firſt, I anſwer you with the Apoſtle: O man, who art thou which pleadeſt againſtRom. 9. 20 God! Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made mee thus? Hath not the Potter power of the clay, to make of the ſame lumpe one veſſell to honour, and another to diſhonour? Moreouer, I anſwer, That Gods decrée doth not enforce the will of man: but it worketh, and mooueth of it ſelfe.

It hath in it ſelfe the beginning of euill motion, and ſinneth willingly. Therefore, though the decrée of God impoſeth a neceſſitie vpon all ſecondarie cauſes (ſo as they muſt néeds be framed and diſpoſed according to the ſame) yet no coaction or conſtraint: for they are all carried with their voluntarie motion. Euen as we ſée the plumbe of a clocke, being the firſt moouer, doth cauſe all the other whéeles to mooue, but not to mooue this way or that way: for, in that they mooue ſome one way, and ſome another, it is of themſelues; I meane of their owne frame. So Gods decrée doth mooue all ſecondarie cauſes, but not take away their owne proper motion. For God is the authour of euerie action, but not of any euill in any action. As the ſoule of man is the originall cauſe of all motion in man, as the Philoſophers diſpute, but yet not of lame and impotent motion; for that is from another cauſe; to wit, ſome defect in the bodie. So, I ſay, Gods decrée is the root and firſt cauſe of motion, but not of defectiue motion: That is from our ſelues. Likewiſe, that a bell ſoundeth, the cauſe is in him that ringeth it: but that it iarreth, the cauſe is in it ſelfe. Againe, that an inſtrument ſoundeth, is in him that plaieth vpon it: but that it iarreth, is in it ſelfe; that is, in it owne want of tuning. So then, to ſhut vp this point, all inſtruments

and middle cauſes are ſo mooued of God, being the firſt moouer, that he alwayes doth well, holily, and iuſtly in his moouing. But the inſtruments mooued, are caried in contrary motions, according to their owne nature and frame. If they be good, they are caried vnto that which is good: but if they be euill, they are caried vnto euill. So that according to the double beginning of motion and will, there is a double and diuers worke and effect.

               But from whence commeth it, that man of himſelfe, that is, of his owne free motion, doth will that which is euill?
            
            
               Theol.
               From the fall of Adam, whereby his will was corrupted.
            
            
               Antile.
               What was the cauſe of Adams fall?
            
            
               Theol.
               The Diuell, and the deprauation of his owne will.
            
            
               Antil.
               How could his will encline vnto euill, it being made good, and he being made good?
            
            
               Theol.
               He and his will were made good, yet mutably good. For to be immutably good, is proper only to God. And Adam did ſo ſtand, that he might fall, as the euent declared.
            
            
               Antile.
               Was not the decree of God the cauſe of Adams fall?
            
            
               Theol.
               No: but the voluntarie inclination of his will vnto euill. For Adams will was neither forced, nor by any violence of Gods

purpoſe, compelled to conſent: but he, of frée will and ready minde, left God, and ioined with the Diuell.
               Thus then I do determine, that Adam ſinned neceſſarily, if you reſpect the decree or euent: but if you reſpect the firſt moouer and inherent cauſe, which was his owne will, then he ſinned voluntarily and contingently. For the decree of God did not take away his will, or the contingencie thereof; but only order and diſpoſe it. Therefore (as a learned writer ſayth) Volens
                  Beza. 
                  peccauit, & motu. He ſinned willingly, and of his owne motion. And therefore no euill is to be attributed vnto God or his decree.

               How then do you conceiue and conſider of the purpoſe of God in all theſe things?
            
            
               Theol.
               Thus:
               
                  That God decreed with himſelfe, vno actu, at once;
                  That there ſhould be a world,
                  That Adam ſhould be created perfect,
                  That he ſhould fall of himſelfe,
                  That all ſhould fall with him,
                  That he would ſaue ſome of the loſt race,
                  That he would do it of mercy through his ſon,
                  That he would condemne others for ſinne.

               But how anſwer you this? God willeth not the death of a ſinner. Therefore heeEzec. 18. hath predeſtinate none to deſtruction.
            
            
               Theol.
               God willeth not the death of a ſinner ſimply, and abſolutely, as it is the deſtruction of his creature; but as it is a meane to declare his iuſtice, and to ſet forth his glory.

               God did foreſee, and foreknow, that the wicked would periſh through their owne ſinne: but yet he did not predeſtinate them vnto it.
            
            
               Theol.
               Gods preſcience and foreknowledge cannot be ſeparated from his decrée. For whatſoeuer God hath foreſéene & foreknowen in his eternall counſell, he hath determined the ſame ſhall come to paſſe. For as it apperteineth to his wiſdom to foreknow and foreſée all things, ſo doth it apperteine to his power to moderate and rule all things according to his will.

               What do you call preſcience in God?
            
            
               
               Theol.
               Preſence in God, is that whereby all things abide preſent before his eies: ſo that to his eternall knowledge, nothing is paſt, nothing to come; but all things are alwaies preſent. And ſo are they preſent, that they are not as conceiued imaginations, formes, and motions: but all things are alwaies ſo preſent, before God, that he doth behold them in their verity and perfection.

               How can God iuſtly determine of mens deſtruction, before they haue ſinned?
            
            
               Theol.
               This obiection hath béene anſwered in part before. For, I told you, that God condemneth none but for ſinne, either originall only, or elſe both original and actual. For howſoeuer hée doth in himſelfe, before all time, determine the reprobation of many, yet he procéedeth to no execution, till there be found in vs both iuſt deſerts, and apparant cauſe. Therefore they deale vnſoundly and fooliſhly, which confound the decrée of reprobation, with damnation it ſelfe: ſith ſinne is the cauſe of the one, and onely the will of God of the other.

               Well Sir, ſith we are ſo farre proceeded in this queſtion, by the occaſion of this mans obiections and cauils, I pray you now, as you haue ſpoken much of reprobation, and the cauſes thereof, ſo let vs heare ſomewhat of election, and the cauſes thereof: and ſhew

vs out of the Scriptures, that God hath before all worlds choſen ſome to eternall life.
            
            
               Theol.
               Touching the decrée of Election, there are almoſt none that make any doubt thereof: therefore ſmall proofe ſhall ſerue for this point. Onely I will confirme it by one or two teſtimonies out of the holy Scriptures. Firſt the Apoſtle ſaith; Bleſſed be God, euen the FatherEpheſ. 2. 3 of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall bleſſings in Heauenly things in Chriſt, as hee hath choſen vs in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him, in loue. You ſée, the words are very plaine and pregnant for this purpoſe. An other confirmation is taken out of the 8. Chap. to the Romanes, in theſe words: Thoſe whom he knew before, didRom 8. he alſo predeſtinate to be like to the image of his own Sonne; that he might be the firſt borne of many brethren.
               
            
            
               Phila.
               Which be the cauſes of Election?
            
            
               Theol.
               The cauſes of Election are to be found onely in God himſelfe. For his eternall election dependeth neither vpon man, neither yet vpon any thing that is in man, but is purpoſed in himſelfe, and eſtabliſhed in Chriſt in whom we are Elected. This is fully prooued in theſe words: Who hath predeſtinated vs to bee adoptedEph. 1. 5. 6 through Ieſus Chriſt in himſelfe, according
                  
                  to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of his glory, wherewith he hath made vs freely accepted in his beloued. Where wée ſee, the apoſtle telleth vs, that his frée grace, and the good pleaſure of his will, are the firſt motiues or moouing cauſes of our Election.
            
            
               Phila.
               But the Papiſts fetch the firſt motiue of election out of mans merits, and fore-ſeene works. For, ſay they, God did fore-ſee who would repent, beleeue, and doe well: and therefore he made choiſe of them.
            
            
               Theol.
               But they are greatly deceiued. For I ſay againe, and againe, that there was nothing in vs which did euer mooue God to ſet his loue vpon vs, and to chooſe vs vnto life: but he euer found the originall cauſe in himſelfe. As it isRom. 9. written; Hee will haue mercy vpon whom he will haue mercy: and whom hee will, hee hardneth.
                  Rom. 9. And againe: It is neither in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth; but in God that ſheweth mercie. The Lord himſelfeDeut. 7. 7. alſo teſtifieth, that hée did chooſe his people, not for any reſpect in them; but onely becauſe hée loued them, and bare a ſpeciall fauour vnto them. So then it is a certaine truth that Gods eternall predeſtination excludeth all merits of man, and all power of his will, thereby to attaine vnto eternall life: and that his frée mercy, and vndeſerued fauour, is both the beginning,

the middeſt, and the end of our ſaluation. That is to ſay, all is of him, and nothing of our ſelues.
            
            
               Phila.
               Whether then doth faith depend vpon election, or election vpon faith? That is, whether did God chooſe vs becauſe we doe beleeue? or whether doe we beleeue, becauſe we are choſen?
            
            
               Theol.
               Out of all doubt, both faith, and all fruits of faith, doe depend vpon election. For, therefore we beléeue, becauſe we are elected: and not therfore elected, becauſe we beléeue. As it is written: So many as were ordained to euerlaſtingAct. 13. 48. life, beleeued.
               
            
            
               Antil.
               If men be predeſtinate before they be borne, to what purpoſe ſerue all precepts, admonitions, lawes, &c? It forceth not how we liue. For neither our godly, or vngodly life can alter the purpoſe of God.
            
            
               Theo.
               This is a very wicked and carnall obiection, and ſheweth a vile and diſſolute minde in them that vſe it. But I would wiſh ſuch men to conſider the end of our election: which is that we ſhould lead a godly life. As it is plainely ſet downe in the firſt to the Epheſians, where the Apoſtle ſaith: God hath choſen vs beforeEphe. 1. 3. the foundation of the world. But to what end? that we ſhould line as we lift? No, no, ſaith he: But that we ſhould be holy, and vnblameable before him. Againe he ſaith: We are perdeſtinate
                  Rom. 8.
                  
                  to bee made like the image of his Sonne; that is, to be holy and righteous. For moſt certaine it is, that we can iudge nothing of predeſtination, but by the conſequents: that is, by our calling, iuſtification, and ſanctification. For when once we féele the worke of grace within vs, (that is, that we are waſhed by the new birth, and renewed by the holy Ghoſt, finding in our ſelues an vnfained hatred of ſin, and loue of righteouſneſſe) then are we ſure, and out of all doubt, that we are predeſtinated to life. And it is euen as much, as if God had perſonally appeared vnto vs, and whiſpered vs in the eare, and told vs that our names are taken, & written in the booke of life. For, whom he hath predeſtinate,Rom. 8. them he hath called; and whom he hath called, them he hath iuſtified; & whom he hath iuſtified, them he hath glorified. Now therefore, till we féele theſe marks of election wrought in vs, we can be at no certainty in this point; neither are we to take any notice of it, or meddle in it: but we muſt ſtriue, according to that power and faculty we haue, to liue honeſtly, and ciuilly, waiting when God will haue mercy on vs, and giue vs the true touch. As for them that are careleſſe and diſſolute, ſetting all at ſix and ſeuen, there is ſmal hope that they are elected, or euer ſhall be called.
            
            
               Antil.
               I thinke the preaching and publiſhing

of this doctrine of predeſtination hath done much hurt: and it had beene good it had neuer beene knowen to the people, but vtterly concealed. For, ſome it driueth to deſpaire, and others it maketh more ſecure and careleſſe.
            
            
               Theol.
               You are in a great errour. For this Doctrine is a part of Gods reuealed Truth, which hée would haue knowen to his people. And, in good ſooth, it is of very great and comfortable vſe to the children of God, againſt all the aſſaults of the Diuell, and temptations of deſperation whatſoeuer. For, when a man hath once in truth felt, by the effects, that God hath choſen him to life: then though the Diuell lie ſore at him, and the conſcience of ſinne and his own frailties moſt vehemently aſſault him; yet he knoweth certainely, that the eternall purpoſe and counſell of God is immutable; and that becauſe his ſaluation is not grounded vpon himſelfe, or his owne ſtrength, but vpon the vnchangeable decrée of God, which is a foundation vnmoueable, and alwaies ſtanding ſure and firme; therefore, doe the diuell and ſinne what they can, yet he ſhal be vpheld in righteouſneſſe & truth, & euen (as it were) borne vp in the arms of God, euen to the end. For whom God loueth, to the end he loueth them. Moreouer, when once the Lords people perceiue (by their ſanctification, and new birth) both that the Lord hath reiected

and reprobated ſo many thouſand thouſands, and made choiſe of them to be heirs of his moſt glorious kingdome, being in themſelues of the ſame mould and making that others are; and that be hath done all this of his frée grace, and vndeſerued mercy towards them: oh, how doth it rauiſh their hearts with the loue of him! Againe, how frankely and chearefully doe they ſerue him! How willingly and faithfully doe they obey him! Yea, how are they wholy rapt, and infiamed with the deſire of him! For it is the perſwaſion and féeling of Gods loue towards vs, that draweth vp our loue to him againe; as S. Iohn ſaith: We loue him, becauſe he hath1. Ioh. 4. loued vs firſt.
               
               Moreouer, it is ſaide of Mary Magdalen,
                  Luke. 7. that ſhée loued much, becauſe much was forgiuen. For, after ſhe felt her many and great ſins fréely pardoned, her affections were kindled with the loue and obedience of Chriſt. So likewiſe the Church in the Canticles, after ſhe had béene in the banqueting houſe of all ſpirituallCant. 2. 5 grace, and felt the banner of Chriſts loue diſplaied vpon her, forthwith ſhée was rapt therewith, and cried out (as it were in a ſwoune) that ſhée was ſicke of loue. So againe, when Chriſt putCant. 5. 4. in his hand by the hole of the doore (that is, touched the very inward parts of her heart, by his ſpirit) then her heart yearned, and her bowels

were affectioned towards him. This is it which Saint Paul praieth for vpon his knees, that it may be granted to the Epheſians, thatEpheſ. 5. they may be able to comprehend with all the Saints, what is the breadth and length, height and depth of Gods loue towards vs, and to know the loue of Chriſt (which paſſeth knowledge) and to be filled with all fulneſſe of God. Thus then you ſée the great and comfortable vſe of this doctrine of election, both in that it miniſtreth ſtrength & comfort againſt all temptations, as alſo becauſe it conſtraineth vs to loue God & of very loue to feare him, and obey him.
            
            
               Phila.
               Well Sir, I thinke now you haue ſpent time enough in anſwering the obiections and cauils of Antilegon. In all which, I doe obſerue one thing; that there is no end of cauilling, and obiecting againſt the truth; and that a man may obiect more in an houre, then a learned man can well anſwer in a day.
            
            
               Theol.
               You ſay truth. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe men haue ſin in them out of meaſure, and the ſpirit of God but in meaſure. Therefore they can by the one, obiect and conceiue more againſt the truth, then by the other they ſhall be able to anſwer, and ſay for it.
            
            
               Phila.
               It appeareth indeed, that errors be infinite, & obiections innumerable, & that there is no end of mens cauilling againſt Gods ſacred

truth. It is good for vs therefore to bee throughly ſetled in the truth, that wee be not entangled or ſnarled with any cauils, or ſophiſtications whatſoeuer. But I doe verily thinke (notwithſtanding all his obiections, and exceptions) that he doth in his conſcience deſire, with Balaam, to die the death of the righteous, and to be as one of them, whom he ſeemeth to deſpiſe.
            
            
               Theol.
               I am ſo perſwaded too. For this is the triumph that vertue hath ouer vice, that, where ſhe is moſt hated, there ſhe is often deſired and wiſhed for. And this is the great puniſhment, that God bringeth vpon the wicked; Virtutem vt videant, intabeſcantque relictâ, as ſaith the Poet; That they ſhall ſee vertue and pine away hauing no power to follow it.

               But now let vs returne to the point we were in hand with, before wee fell into theſe obiection and cauils: which was concerning the ſmall number of them which ſhall be ſaued. And as you haue ſhewed vs many reaſons thereof, ſo proceed to ſpeake yet more vnto that point.

               The firſt, which is Infidelity, is proued out of the fourth chapter to the Hebrewes, where it is written; Vnto vs was the Goſpell preached, as vnto them: but the word, whichHeb. 4. 2. they heard, profited them not, becauſe it was not mixed with faith in thoſe that heard it. And againe: They could not enter in, becauſe of vnbeliefe. Héere we ſée that vnbeliefe did barre out the old people, from entring into the land of promiſe, which was a figure of Gods eternall kingdome. And ſure it is, that the ſame vnbeliefe doth barre out thouſands of vs.

For many will beléeue nothing, but their owne fanſies. They will not beléeue the word of God: eſpecially, when it is contrary to their luſtes and likings, profits & pleaſures. Though things be manifeſtly prooued to their faces, and both the Chapter and the Uerſe ſhewed them, yet will they not beléeue: or though they ſay they beléeue, yet will they neuer goe about the practiſe of any thing, but reply againſt God in all their actions. And, for the moſt part, when God ſaith one thing, they will ſay another. When God ſaith yea, they will ſay no: and ſo giue God the lie. Some againe will ſay, if all bée true that the Preachers ſay, then God helpe vs. Thus you ſée, how Infidelity doth barre men out of Heauen, and caſt them into hell.

               This is ſet downe in the 29. of Deuteronomy; where the Lord ſaith thus. When a man heareth the words of this curſe, and yet flattereth himſelfe in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall haue peace, although I walke according to the ſtubbornneſſe of mine owne heart (thus adding drunkenneſſe to thirſt, that is, one ſinne to another) the Lord will not be mercifull vnto him, but the wrath of the Lord and his iealouſie ſhall ſmoake againſt that man; and euery curſe

               Héere we ſée, how the mightie God doth thunder downe vpon ſuch as goe on in their ſins, preſuming of his mercy, and ſaying in their hearts, If I may haue but a Lord haue mercy vpon me, thrée houres before death, I care not. But it is iuſt with God, when thoſe thrée hours come, to ſhut them vp in blindneſſe, and hardneſſe of heart, as a iuſt plague for their preſumption. Therefore the Prophet Dauid, ſeeing thePſal. 19. grieuouſneſſe of this ſin praieth to be deliuered from it. Keepe me, ô Lord (ſaith he) from preſumptuous ſins: let them not raigne ouer me. Let all men therfore take héed of preſumptuous ſins: For, though God be full of mercy: yet will he ſhew no mercy to them that preſume of his mercy. But they ſhall once know, to their coſt, that iuſtice goeth from him, as well as mercy.

But we will doe whatſoeuer goeth out of our owne mouth: and we will doe as we haue done, both we and our Fathers, our Kings, and our Princes, in the cities of Iudah and in the ſtreets of Ieruſalem.

               This is auouched by the wiſe man, in theſe words; Becauſe ſentence againſt an euillEccl. 8. 11. worke is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the hearts of the children of men are ſet in them to doe euill. Where he ſheweth, that one cauſe why men are ſo hardned in their ſinnes, is, becauſe God winketh at them, and letteth them alone, not puniſhing them immediately after they haue ſinned. For if God ſhould forthwith ſtrike downe one, and raine fire and brimſtone vpon another, and cauſe the earth to ſwallow vp the third, then men would feare indéed. But it hath béene ſhewed before, that God

taketh not that courſe: but though he méet with ſome in this life, yet he lets thouſands eſcape: and that makes them more bold, thinking they ſhall neuer come to their anſwer. Euen as an olde théefe, which hath a long time eſcaped both priſon and gallowes, thinkes he ſhall alwaies ſo eſcape, and therefore goeth boldly on in his thefts. But let men take héed. For as the prouerbe ſaith, Though the pitcher goeth long to the well, yet at laſt it commeth broken home: So, though men eſcape long, yet they ſhall not eſcape alwaies. For there will come a day of reckoning, a day that will pay it home for all. Thus you ſée, how impunity leadeth numbers to deſtruction. That is, when men are let alone, and neither ſmitten by the hand of God, nor puniſhed by the law of the Magiſtrate.

               Theol.
               This is affirmed by our Lord Ieſus concerning that rich worldling, who, when he felt the world come in vpon him with full ſtreame, ſaid he would pull downe his barnes and build greater, and ſay to his ſoule; Soule,Luke 12. 19. thou haſt much goods laid vp for many years: Liue at eaſe, eate, drinke, and take thy paſtime. But our Sauiour calleth him foole, for flattering himſelfe in ſecurity, and promiſing vnto himſelfe long life. Moreouer hée plainely tolde

him, that the ſame night, hée ſhould make a helliſh and miſerable end. Note, I pray you, how Jeſus Chriſt, the fountaine of all Wiſedome, calleth this man a foole; and yéeldeth a reaſon thereof: to wit, becauſe hée gathered riches to himſelfe, and was not rich in God; hee had great care of this life, and none at all for that which is to come. So then it followeth, that all ſuch are right fools indéed, and may be Chronicled for fooles, (how wiſe ſoeuer they be taken and reputed in the world) which haue much care for their bodies, and none for their ſoules: great care for this life, and little for that which is to come. Well, let all ſuch prophane worldlings, as dreame and doat of long life, (and therfore deferre the day of their repentance and conuerſion vnto God) take héed by this mans example, that they reckon not without their Hoſt, and be ſuddenly ſnatched away in the midſt of all their pleaſures, and iollities; as Iob
                  Iob. 21. 23. ſaith: Some die in their full ſtrength, being in all eaſe and proſperity. Their breaſts runne full of milke: and their bones run full of marrow. Wée ſée therefore, how dangerous a thing it is for men to flatter and ſooth vp themſelues with hope of long life.

               Proceed to the ſeuenth gate; which is Conceitedneſſe.
               
            
            
               Theol.
               This is indéed a very broad gate, into

hell. For the Scripture ſaith: Seeſt thou aPro. 26. 12. Pro. 26. 16. man wiſe in his owne conceit? there is more hope of a foole then of ſuch a one. And againe, The foole is wiſer in his owne eies, then ſeuen men that can giue a ſenſible reaſon. The holy ghoſt, we ſée, affirmeth, that ſuch as are puft vp with an ouer-wéening of their owne gifts, are fartheſt of all other from the kingdome of Heauen. For they deſpiſe the wiſedome of God, to their owne deſtruction. They hold ſcorne to bée taught. They will ſay, they know as much as all the Preachers can tell them. For, what can all the Preachers ſay more then this; We are all ſinners, we muſt be ſaued by Chriſt; Wée muſt doe as we would be done to? There is no more, but doe well, and haue well, &c. Alas poore ſoules, they looke aloft: they are deſperatly hauen vp with conceiptedneſſe; not knowing that they are poore, naked, blinde, & miſerable.Reu. 3. 17.
               
               Theſe men truſt altogether to their owne wit, learning, policy, riches, and great reputation in the world. And becauſe all men crouch to them, and clap their hands at them, therefore they ſwell like Turky Cocks, ſet vp their feathers, & draw their wings vpon the ground with a kinde of ſnuffe and diſdaine of all men: as if they were the onely wights of the world. Moreouer, when men doe praiſe them for their gifts, ſoothe them, and applaud vnto them,

then is it a wonder to ſée how they ſtreake themſelues; as though they would forthwith take their flight, and mount into the cloudes. But let all inſolent and conceited men hearken vnto the woe that is pronounced againſt them, by the eternall King of glory, ſaying, Woe vntoEſa. 5. 21. them that are wiſe in their owne eyes, and prudent in their own ſight. Againe, let them hearken to the counſel of God, which ſaith, Truſt vntoProu. 3. 5. the Lord, with all thy heart, but leane not vnto thine owne wiſedome. Bee not wiſe in thine owne eies: but feare God, and depart from euill. Theſe ſilly conceited fooles thinke, that becauſe they haue the caſt of this life, and can cunningly compaſſe the things of this world and goe through-ſtich with them, therefore they can compaſſe heauen alſo by their fine wits, and déepe deuices. But, alas, poore wretches, they are greatly and groſſely deceiued. For the wiſdome of the world is fooliſhneſſe with God: and1. Cor. 3. 19. he catcheth the wiſe in their owne craftineſſe. And againe the Lord ſaith, I wil deſtroy the wiſdome of the wiſe, and will caſt away the vnderſtanding1. Cor. 1. 19. of the prudent. Let not theſe men therefore ſtand too much in their owne light: let them not truſt to their owne policies. For, they are all but as an ice of one nights fréezing, which will deceiue them that truſt vnto it. Let them therefore become fooles in themſelues,

that God may make them wiſe. Let them deny themſelues, that God may acknowledge them. Let them be humbled in themſelues, that God may exalt them. For aſſuredly, there is no vſe after this life, of the moſt exquiſtte wiſedome of fleſh: it all endeth when we end. For how dieth the wiſe man? Euen as dieth the foole, ſaith theEccl. 2. 16. holy Ghoſt. And where all worldly wiſedome endeth, there all heauenly wiſedome beginneth. Thus therefore we ſée, what a wide gate into hell, conceitedneſſe is, and how many enter in thereat.
            
            
               Phila.
               Now let vs vnderſtand of the eight gate into hell: which is ill company.
               
            
            
               Theol.
               The ſpirit of God foreſéeing the great danger of this, and knowing how ready we are to be carried away with ill company, doth giue vs moſt earneſt warning to take héed of it, as a moſt dangerous thing. Enter not (ſaithPro. 4. 14 he) in the way of the wicked: and walke not in the way of euill men. Auoid it, goe not by it, turne from it, and paſſe by. The reaſon héereof is yéelded in another place: where it is ſaid. A companion of fooles ſhall be madePro. 13. 20. worſe. Let men therefore take héede of ill company. For, many thereby haue béene brought to the gallowes, and haue confeſſed vpon the ladder, that ill company hath brought them vnto it: and therefore haue admoniſhed

all by their example, to take héed, and beware of lewd company. Moreouer, the Scripture ſaith: He that followeth vaine companions, ſhall be filled with pouerty. And againe in thePro. 28. 19. ſame Chapter, He that keepeth company with banquetters, ſhameth his Father. Let vs therefore with Dauid ſay, I am a companion of allPſ. 119. 63. them that feare God, and keepe his commandements. And, on the contrary, let vs ſay with him, I haue not haunted with vaine perſons,Pſ. 26. 4 neither kept company with the diſſemblers. I hate the aſſembly of the euill, and haue not companied with the wicked. Let vs therefore, by Dauids example, ſhun the company of the wicked: For, as a man is, ſo is his company. It is the ſureſt note to diſcern a man by. For, as al vnlike things are vnſociable, ſo all like things are ſociable. Herein let vs beware, we deceiue not our ſelues with vaine words, and an opinion of our owne ſtrength: as if we were as ſtrong as Chriſt, & could not be drawne away with any company. No, no: we are more apt to be drawne, then to draw: to be drawne to euill by others, then to draw others to good. Therefore God ſaith by his prophet: Let them returne vnto thee, but returne not thou vnto them. UndoubtedlyIere. 15. 19. he is an odde man, that is not made worſe with ill companie. For can a man touch pitch, and not be defiled therewith? Can a man

carry coales in his boſome, and not bée burnt? Daily & lamentable experience ſheweth, that many of them, which thinke thēſelues ſtrong, are this way moſt gréeuouſly ſmutted. Let a man thinke therefore, hée neuer abandoneth euill, till hée abandon ill company. For no good is concluded in this Parliament. For ill company is the ſuburbes of hell. Furthermore, it is to be obſerued, that ſome vpon admonitions, and ſome inward compunctions of their owne conſcience, doe leaue their ſinnes, vntill they haue new prouocations, and vntill they come amongſt their old copeſmates and ſinne-companions: and then are they carried backe againe to their old bias, and returne to their folly, as aPro. 26. 11. dog returneth to his vomit. For wee ſée ſome, which otherwiſe are of good natures and diſpoſitions, moſt pittifully, and violently carried away with ill company. For euen as gréene wood of it ſelfe is vnapt to burne, yet being laid on the fire, with a great deale of ſeare wood, it burneth as faſt as the reſt: So, many toward youthes, which of themſelues are not ſo prone vnto euill, as others: yet with this violent ſtreame and bluſtering tempeſt of ill company, are carried cleane away.
            
            
               Phila.
               Let vs come to the laſt gate: which is the Euill example of Miniſters.
               
            
            
               Theol.
               It gréeueth me, and I am almoſt aſhamed,

to ſpeake of this point. For, is it not a wofull and lamentable thing, that any ſuch ſhould be found amongſt the ſons of Leui? Is it not a corſey, that the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhuld be of a ſcandalous conuerſation? For if the eie be darke, how great is the darkneſſe? If they bée examples of all euill to the flocke, which ſhould be patterns, lights, and examples of all goodneſſe, muſt it not néeds ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, ſo as they cannot returne from their wickedneſſe? But this is an old diſeaſe & euill ſickneſſe, which hath alwaies béene in the church. The Prophet Ieremy doth moſt gréeuouſly complaine of it in his time, & ſaith; That from the Prophets of Ieruſalem, is wickedneſſe
                  Ier. 23. 14. 
                  gone foorth into all the land. For, both the Prophet and the Prieſt doe wickedly. I haue ſeene, ſaith he, in the Prophets of Ieruſalem, filthines. They commit adulterie, & walke in lies: they ſtrengthen alſo the hands of the wicked, that none can returne from his wickedneſſe; they are all vnto me as Sodom: and the Inhabitants thereof, as Gomorah.
                   And in the ninth verſe of the ſame Chap. he ſheweth, that it was no pleaſure or toy vnto him, ſo publikely to reprooue them: but, that he did it with excéeding griefe, as being forced thereunto, both in regard of Gods glory, & the good of his Church. His words are theſe, Mine hart breaketh within
                  
                  me, becauſe of the prophets, and al my bones ſhake. Moreouer, in the ſame Chapter is ſet downe, how the Lord would féed them with wormewood, and make them drinke the water of gall, and ſundry other waies plague them, for their flatteries, ſeducements, corrupt doctrine, and euill example of life.

               Moſt certaine it is, that the euill example of Miniſters, and eſpecially of Preachers, is very dangerous, & offenſiue: for thereby thouſands are hardned in their ſins. For men will ſay, Such a Miniſter, and ſuch a Preacher, doth thus, and thus, and therefore why may not we doe ſo too? They are learned, and know the word of God: therfore, if it were euil, I hope they would not doe it. For they ſhould be lights to vs, and giue vs good examples. Therefore, ſith they do ſuch things, we cannot tell what to thinke, or what to ſay to the matter: they bring ſuch ſimple folke as we are, into a mammering.

               Oh that I could, with the Prophet Ieremy, quake and ſhake to thinke of theſe matters! Oh that I could mourne as a Doue, in penning of it! Oh that I had in the wilderneſſe a cotage, and could with Iob be a brother to the Dragons, and a companion to the Oſtriches, whileſt I haue any thoughts of thoſe things▪ Oh that I could wéepe & mourne without ſin, before I yéeld you an anſwer ï For wéepe indéed

I may: but anſwer, I cannot. Alas (with much griefe I ſpeake it) all is too true, that you ſay. And héerein the people haue a vantage againſt vs: if I may call it vantage. But let this be mine anſwer: If the blinde leade the blind, both ſhal fall into the ditch. Blind guidesMath 15. 14. and blinde people, ſhall periſh together. If becauſe we are wicked, they will be more wicked, then both they and we ſhall burne in hell fire together. Then let them recken their gaines, and ſée what they haue got. They haue ſmall cauſe ſo to triumph ouer vs. For, thereby their market is neuer a whit amended: let them take this for anſwer. And let vs that are the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Preachers of the Goſpell, looke narrowly to our ſelues, and make ſtraight ſteps to our féet. For if we tread neuer ſo little awry, we may ſée how many eies are vpon vs. Let vs therfore with Dauid pray continually, Order my goings, O Lord, that my footſteps ſlip not. For when my foot ſlipped, they reioyced againſt me. And as for the people, let them follow the examples of thoſe, which walke vnblameably (as God be thanked, ſome ſuch there be) and let them flie the examples of ſuch as are offenſiue. So ſhall God haue more glory, & they more peace in their owne hearts. Thus haue we heard, what a wide gate is opened into hell, by the euill example of Miniſters,

and eſpecially of Preachers.

               Well, ſith there be ſo many bars out of heauen, and ſo many gates into hell, it is a very hard matter to breake thorow all theſe barres, and ſo to enter into life: and as hard a matter, to miſſe all theſe gates, and to eſcape hell.

And I doubt not, but my good deeds ſhall weigh againſt my euill deeds, and that I ſhal make euen with God, at my latter end. For I thanke God for it, I haue alwaies liued in his feare, & ſerued him with a true intent. Therefore I know, that ſo long as I keepe his commandements, and liue as my neighbours doe, and as a Chriſtian man ought to doe, he will not damne my ſoule.

               Aſune.
               You ſay not well in that. I need a Sauiour: and it is my Lord Ieſus that muſt ſaue me: for he made me.
            
            
               Theol.
               What néed you a Sauiour, ſith you are no ſinner?
            
            
               Aſune.
               Yes beleeue me, I am a ſinner. We are all ſinners: there is no man but he ſinneth.
            
            
               Theo.
               How can you bée a ſinner, ſith you kéepe all the Commandements?
            
            
               Aſune.
               Yes: I am a ſinner, for all that.
            
            
               Theo.
               Can you both be a ſinner, and be without ſinne too? for hée that kéepeth the commandements, is without ſinne. Which thing you ſay you doe. But I ſée how the caſe ſtandeth; that a great number of ſuch ignorant & ſottiſh men as you are, will in generall ſay you are ſinners, becauſe your conſcience telleth you ſo: but when it cōmeth to particulars, you know not how you ſinne, nor wherein. I pray you therefore, let me leade you thorow the Commandements againe, and deale with you in particulars: that I may bring you to the ſight of your ſins. How ſay you therefore, do you vpon your knées, euery morning and euening, giue God thanks for his particular mercies, & manifold fauours towards you: And do you call much vpon him priuately, and much alſo with your family? anſwer me plainely and ſimply.
            
            
               Aſune.
               I cannot ſay ſo.
            
            
               
               Theol.
               Then you haue broken the firſt commandement; which chargeth vs to giue God his due worſhip; whereof, praier and thankeſgiuing are a part. So then héere, at the very entrance, you are found guiltie. Further, I demaund of you, whether you neuer had any by-thoughts in your prayers, and your heart hath not béene vpon other matters, euen then while you were in prayer?
            
            
               Aſune.
               I cannot denie that. For it is a very hard matter to pray, without by-thoughts.
            
            
               Theol.
               Then (by your owne confeſſion) you haue broken the ſecond cōmandement, which doth command the right manner of Gods worſhip; that is, that as we muſt worſhip God, ſo wée muſt doe it in ſaith, loue, zeale, and pure affections. So that héere you are guiltie alſo; becauſe when you pray, your minde is of other matters, and you doe it not in ſinceritie and truth. Further, I demand of you, whether you did neuer ſweare by your faith, or troth, or ty our Lady, S. Mary, and ſuch other oathes?
            
            
               Aſune.
               Yes by S. Mary haue I: I muſt needs confeſſe it.
            
            
               Theol.
               We néed no further witneſſe. Your verie anſwer prooueth it; for your anſwer is an oath. Therefore here alſo you are guilty; becauſe you ſweare by idols. Further, I demand of you, whether you did neuer trauel to Faires

on the Sabbath day, or make bargains on that day, or take iourneies, or talke of worldly matters, neglecting holy duties?
            
            
               Aſune.
               Yes, God for giue me, I haue.
            
            
               Theol.
               Then are you guiltie of the breach of the fourth commandement: which chargeth vs, on paine of death, to ſpend the Sabbath day in holy & religious duties, both publikely, and priuately. Further I demand, whether you inſtruct your wife, children, and ſeruants, in the true knowledge of God, and pray with them, or no?
            
            
               Aſun.
               I am ſure, you would haue me ſpeake the truth, I muſt needs confeſſe, I doe not, neither am I able to doe it.
            
            
               Theol.
               Then you are guiltie of the breach of the fift commandement; which commandeth all duties of ſuperiours, towards their inferiours; and of inferiours, towards their ſuperiours, whereof prayer and inſtructions are a part. Moreouer, I demand, whether you were neuer angry or no?
            
            
               Aſune.
               Yes, an hundred times, in my daies. And I thinke, there is no body, but will be angry at one time or other; eſpecially when they haue cauſe.
            
            
               Theol.
               Then you haue broken the ſixt commandemēt: which chargeth vs to auoid wrath, anger, malice, deſire of reuenge: and all ſuch

like fore-runners vnto murther. Further, I aſke you: whether you did neuer looke vpon a woman with a luſt in your heart?
            
            
               Aſune.
               Yes. For I thinke there is no man free from thoughts that way. I had thought, thoughts had beene freee.
            
            
               Theol.
               No: thoughts are not frée before God. For, God knoweth our thoughts: & wil puniſh vs, arraigne vs, & condemne vs for thoughts. Men know not thoughts: and therefore can make no Lawes againſt thoughts: but becauſe God is priuy to all our moſt ſecret thoughts, therefore hée hath made Lawes againſt them, and will condemne them. Therfore I conclude, that if you haue nouriſhed adulterous thoughts in your heart, you are guilty of the breach of the ſeuenth commandement: which forbiddeth all ſecret thoughts and prouocations whatſoeuer to adultery. But further, I demaund, whether you did neuer pilfer, purloine, and ſteale ſome ſmall things from your neighbour: as paſture, poultry, conies, apples, and ſuch like?
            
            
               Aſun.
               I cannot cleare my ſelfe in theſe things. For I had thought, they had bin no ſinne.
            
            
               Theol.
               Then haue you broken the eight commandement, and ſtand guilty of eternall death. For God, in this commandement, chargeth vs to haue as great care of our neighbours goods, as of our owne: and not to iniure him any maner

of way, in thought, word, or déed. Therefore all deceit, pilfering, oppreſſing, and all vniuſt dealing with our neighbours goods, is héere condemned. Moreouer, let me aſke you, whether you did neuer lie, or diſſemble?
            
            
               Aſune.
               Yes aſſuredly.
            
            
               Theo.
               Then haue you broken the ninth commandement: wherein, God chargeth vs, both in witneſſe-bearing, and all other matters, to ſpeake the plaine truth from our heart, without lying or diſſembling.
               Laſt of all, I demand whether you did neuer in your hart deſire ſomthing that was not your owne: as your neighbours houſe, or ground, kine, or ſhéepe, &c. therein bewraying the diſcontentment of your heart?
            
            
               Aſune.
               I am as guilty in this, as in any thing. For (God forgiue me) I haue often deſired and luſted after this, and that, which was none of mine owne, and ſo haue bewraied my diſcontentment.
            
            
               Theol.
               Then I perceiue (by your owne confeſſion) that you are guilty of the breach of all the Commandements.
            
            
               Aſune.
               I muſt needs confeſſe it. For I ſee now more into that matter, then euer I did. I neuer heard ſo much before in my life, nor was euer asked any ſuch queſtions, as you aske me. I had thought many of thoſe things, which

you asked me, had beene no ſinnes at all.
            
            
               Theol.
               I could haue conuicted you in a thouſand other particulars, wherein you doe daily and hourely breake the Law of God. But my purpoſe was onely to giue you a taſte of ſome particular tranſgreſſions, and there withal ſome little light by the way into the meaning of the law: that thereby you might be brought to ſome better fight of your ſelfe, and might a little perceiue in what caſe you ſtand before God; and by that little, conceiue a great deale more.
            
            
               Aſune.
               Well: now I doe plainely ſee, that I haue beene deceiued; and am not in ſo good eſtate before God, as I thought I had beene. Moreouer I ſee, that thouſands are out of the way, which thinke they are in a good caſe before God: whereas indeed they are in blindneſſe, and in their ſins. But Lord haue mercy vpon vs. I doe now plainely ſee, that I am farre from keeping the commandements: and I thinke no man doth keepe them.
            
            
               Theol.
               You may ſwear it, I warrant you. For neither S. Paul, Dauid, or the virgin Mary, could euer kéepe any one of the Commandements. I am glad you begin to ſée into the law of God, and to haue ſome taſte that way. For, as a mans knowledge and inſight is into the law, ſo is the knowledge and inſight into himſelf. He that hath a déepe inſight into the law of

God, hath alſo a déepe inſight into himſelfe. He that hath no ſight into the law, can haue no inſight into himſelfe. For the law is that glaſſe wherein we do behold the face of our ſoules, before God. The Apoſtle ſaith: By the law commethRom. 3. 20. the knowledge of ſinne. Therefore thoſe which are altogether ignorant of the law, and neuer behold themſelues in this glaſſe, do commit an hundred ſinnes a day, which they know not of; and therefore are not gréeued for them. For, how can a man be gréeued for that, which he knoweth not? But now further, I pray you giue me leaue to aſke you ſome moe queſtions of the principles of religion: to the end, that you knowing and féeling your ignorance, may bée humbled therwith, bewaile it in time, & ſéeke after the true knowledge of God. But yet, by the way, I will aſke Antilegon, a queſtion, or two; becauſe I deſire to vnderſtand what knowledge he hath in the grounds of religion. Tell me therefore Antilegon, what was the reaſon why Chriſt was conceiued by the holy Ghoſt?
            
            
               Antil.
               I could anſwer you: but I will not. What authority haue you to examine me? Shew your Commiſſion. When I ſee your warrant, I wil anſwer you. In the meane time, you haue nothing to doe, to examine me. Meddle with that you haue to doe withall.
            
            
               Theol.
               I perceiue you are not only ignorant,

but wilfull, and obſtinate, and refuſe all inſtructions. Therefore I will leaue you to God, and to your galled conſcience. But I pray you Aſunetus, anſwer that queſtion. What thinke you, what is the reaſon that Chriſt was conceiued by the holy Ghoſt?
            
            
               Aſune.
               Beleeue me Sir, that is an hard queſtion. You may aske a wiſe man that queſtion: For I cannot anſwer it.
            
            
               Theo.
               What ſay you then to this: Who was Chriſts mother?
            
            
               Aſune.
               Mary Sir, that was our bleſſed Lady.
            
            
               Theol.
               What was Pontius Pilate?
               
            
            
               Aſun.
               I am ſomwhat ignorant, I am not booklearned: but if you will haue my ſimple opinion, I thinke it was the diuell. For none but the diuell, would put our ſweet Sauiour to death.
            
            
               Theo.
               What is the holy Catholicke Church, which you ſay you doe beléeue?
            
            
               Aſune.
               The Communion of Saints, the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.

               What doe you pray for, when you ſay, Thy Kingdome come?
            
            
               Aſune.
               I do pray, that God would ſend vs all of his grace, that we may ſerue him, & do as we ought to do, & keepe vs in a good mind to God ward, and to haue him much in our mind: For ſom (God bleſſe vs) haue nothing but the diuell in their minde: they do nothing a Gods name.

               The Lords Supper.

               What is the principall end of your comming to receiue the Sacrament?

               To receiue my maker.

               What is the principall vſe of a Sacrament?

               What profit and comfort haue you by a Sacrament?

               In token that Chriſt died for vs.
            
            
               Theol.
               I can but pitie you, for your ignorance: for it is excéeding groſſe and palpable. Your anſwers are to no purpoſe, and bewray a wonderful blindneſſe and ſenſeleſneſſe in matters of Religion. I am ſory, that now I haue not time and leaſure to let you sée your folly, & extreame ignorance, as alſo to lay open vnto you the ſenſe and meaning of the Articles of the faith, the Lords prayer, and the Sacraments, & al other the grounds of Chriſtian Religion.

               What courſe would you wiſh me to take, that I may come out of ignorance, and attaine vnto the true knowledge of God?
            
            
               Theol.
               Surely, I would wiſh you to be diligent

in hearing of Sermons, and reading the Scriptures, with praier and humility. Alſo that you would peruſe Catechiſmes, and other good bookes: and eſpecially Vi

If you take this courſe, you ſhall by Gods grace, within a ſhort time, grow to ſome good meaſure of knowledge, in all the maine grounds of Chriſtian religion.

               I had not thought any man had beene ſo ignorant, as I now perceiue this man is.
            
            
               Theo.
               Yes verily: there be thouſands in his caſe. And I doe know by experience, that many will vſe the very ſame anſwers: or at leaſt, very little differing.
            
            
               Phila.
               I warrant you, if you had queſtioned with him of kine, or ſheepe, purchaſing of lands, taking of Leaſes, or any other matter vnder the ſunne, you ſhould haue found him very ripe and ready in his anſwers.
            
            
               Theol.
               I am ſo perſwaded too. For let a man talke with worldly men of worldly matters, and their anſwer is neuer to ſeeke. They will talke very freſhly with you of ſuch matters, if it be all the day long. For they haue a déepe inſight

into earthly things: and doe wholly delight to talke of them, being neuer weary. For it is their ioy, their meate, and their drinke. But come once to talke with them of Gods matters (as of faith, repentance regeneration &c.) you ſhall finde them the verieſt dullards, & dunces in the world. For, when spéech is had of theſe things, they are ſo befogged, that they can not tell where they are, nor what they ſay.
            
            
               Phil.
               In my iudgement, ſuch mens caſe is very pitifull, and dangerous. And ſo is this mans caſe alſo, if God doe not very ſpeedily pull him out of it.
            
            
               Theol.
               Queſtionles. For God ſaith, My peopleHoſ. 4. 7. periſh for want of knowledge. Our Lord Jeſus ſaith, that ignorance is the cauſe of all errours. Yee erre, ſaith he, not knowing the ſcriptures.
                  Math. 22. The Apoſtle ſaith, that ignorance doth alienate vs from the life of God. For ſaith he, The gentiles were darkened in their cogitation,Epheſ. 4. 18. being ſtrangers from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them. So then it is cleare, that ignorance is not the mother of deuotion, as the Papiſts doe auouch: but it is the mother of errour, death and deſtruction, as the Scripture affirmeth. Our Lord foreſéeing the great danger of ignorance (how thereby thouſands are carried headlong into Hell) doth admoniſhIoh. 5. 39. al men to ſearch the Scriptures, which

do teſtifie of him: that ſo they might get out of the moſt dangerous gulfe of ignorance, wherein multitudes are implunged. Therefore the Noble men of Berea are commended, by theAct. 17. 11. holy Ghoſt, becauſe they receiued the word, with all readineſſe; and ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo. Oh therefore that men would earneſtly ſéeke after the knowledge of God in time: and (as the Prophet ſaith) Seeke the Lord, whileſt he mayEſay. 55. 6. be found: call vpon him whileſt he is neere▪

               I do ſee, that all ignorance in matters of faith, is dangerous: but I thinke, wilfull ignorance is of all other moſt dangerous.
            
            
               Theol.
               Wilfull ignorance (no doubt) is a plaine prognoſtication, and demonſtratiue argument of eternal death: For it is a moſt horrible and feareful thing, for men to refuſe inſtructions, deſpiſe counſels, harden their hearts, ſtop their eares, and cloſe vp their eies againſt God. This is the very vp-ſhot of our decay.

               An heard heart is that, which is neither mooued with Gods mercies, nor ſcared with his iudgements: neither feareth the law, nor regardeth the Goſpel: neither is holpen by threatnings, nor ſoftned by chaſtenings: which is vnthankful for Gods benefits, and diſobedient

to his counſels: made cruell by his roddes, and diſſolute by his fauours: vnſhamefaſt to filthineſſe, and feareleſſe to perils: vncurteous to men, and retchleſſe to God: forgetfull of things paſt, negligent in things preſent, and improuident in things to come.

               Lay foorth yet more plainely the ſtate of ignorant and hard hearted men; and ſhew how lamentable it is.

               If a man be outwardly blind, we do pity him, and ſay: There goeth a poore blinde man: but if he be both blind and deafe, doe wée not more pity him, and ſay? Oh, in how miſerable a caſe is that man! But if he bée both blinde, deafe and dumbe, doe we not moſt of all pity him, and ſay? Oh, that man is in a moſt wofull taking, and in a moſt pittifull plight!
               How much more then are they to be pitied, which as concerning their ſoules, are both blinde, deafe, and dumbe? For the diſeaſes of the ſoule are far more dangerous, and more to be pittied, then thoſe of the body.
               Would it not pitty a mans heart, to ſee a poore ſhéepe in a Lions mouth, whileſt he teareth him, renteth him, & pulleth out his guts? Euen ſuch is the caſe of ignorant men, in the clawes of the diuell. For the diuell hath them vnder him, rideth them at his pleaſure, and teareth their ſoules in péeces.

the gronings of ſouldiers wounded, & the doleful ſighes and gronings of many Captaines and Coronels, giuing vp the ghoſt: were not this a moſt wofull ſpectacle? Euen ſo, when wée doe clearely ſée Sathan wound and murther thouſand, thouſands ſoules, is it not a farre more tragicall & lamentable ſight? and ought it not euen to kill our hearts, to behold it? But alas, men haue no eies, to ſée into theſe things. And yet certaine it is, that Sathan doth continually, and in moſt fearefull maner, maſſacre innumerable ſoules. Thus haue I ſhewed you, the wofull eſtate of prophane and ignorant men.

               If it be ſo, you that be Miniſters and Preachers of the Goſpell, & haue taken vpon you the cure and charge of ſoules, haue need to looke about you, and to doe what in you lieth, to ſaue ſoules, & as good ſhepheards, in great pittie and compaſſion, to labour to pull them out of the pawes of this roaring Lion, which goeth about continually ſeeking whom hee may deuour.

               It ſtandeth vs vpon indéed, very ſeriouſly and carefully to looke to it, as wée will anſwer it at the dreadfull day of iudgement. For it is no ſmall matter that we haue taken in hand; which is, to care for the flocke, which Chriſt hath bought with his bloud. Would to God therefore that wée would leaue ſtriuing

about other matters, and ſtriue together all about this; who can pull moſt out of the kingdome of Sathan, ſinne, and ignorance: who can winne moſt ſoules, and who can performe beſt ſeruice to the church. This were a good ſtrife indéede: and would to God that we might once at laſt with ioined forces goe about it, & with one heart and hand, ioine together to build vp Gods houſe. If through our owne follies the worke hath béen hindred, or any breach made, let vs in wiſedome and loue, labor to make it vp againe. If there hath béene any declining and coldneſſe, let vs now at laſt reuiue: let vs ſtirre vp our ſelues, that we may ſtirre vp others. Let vs be zealous and feruent in ſpirit, that wée may through Gods grace put life into others, and rowſe vp this dead declining & cold age wherein we liue: So ſhall God be glorified, his church edified, his Saints comforted, his people ſaued, his throne erected, and the kingdome of the Diuell ouerthrowne.

               What thinke you were the beſt courſe to effect this which you ſpeake of?
            
            
               Theol.
               This is a thing that muſt bée excéedingly laboured in of vs, which are the Miniſters, and Preachers of the Goſpell. And héere is required diligence and (as we ſay) double diligence: for the people are, euery where, very ignorant. Some are ſtones, altogether vncapable

of inſtruction: others are froward and wilfull. Some will receiue the doctrine: but not the practiſe: ſome againe are altogether ſet vpon péeuiſhneſſe, and cauilling. So that a man were better take vpon him the charge of kéeping Wolues and Beares, then the charge of ſouls. For it is the hardeſt thing in the world, to reforme mens diſorders, and to bring them into order, to pull mens ſoules out of the kingdome of Sathan, and to bring them to God. It is as we ſay, an endleſſe péece of worke, an infinite toyle, a labour of all labours: I quake to thinke of it. For, men are ſo obſtinate and irrefragable that they wil be brought into no order: they wil come vnder no yoake. They will not be ruled by God, nor bridled by his word. They wil follow their owne ſwinge. They will run after their owne luſts and pleaſures. They will kicke and ſpurne, if they be reprooued. They will rage and ſtorme if you goe about to curbe them, and reſtraine them of their wils, likings, and liberties. They wil haue their wils, and follow their old faſhions; ſay what you will, and doe what you can.
               Is it not thinke you a buſie péece of worke, to ſmooth and ſquare ſuch Timber-logs, ſo full of knots and knobs? Is it not a tedious and irkeſome thing, to thinke vpon? And would it not kill a mans heart to goe about it? For, how

hard a thing is it, to bring ſuch into frame, as are ſo farre out of frame?

               Well ſir, you can but doe your endeuour, and commit the ſucceſſe to God. You can but plant and water: let God giue the encreaſe. You are Miniſters of the letter: but not of the ſpirit. You baptiſe with water: but not with the holy Ghoſt. If you therefore preach diligently, exhort, admoniſh, and reprooue, publikely, and priuately: ſtudying by all good example of life, and ſeeking with all good zeale, care, and conſcience, to do the vttermoſt that in you lieth, to reduce them from their euill waies; I take it, you are diſcharged, though they remaine ſtubborne and incorrigible. For you know, what the Lord ſaith by his Prophet: If you doe admoniſh them and giue them warning, then you ſhall bee diſcharged, andEze. 33. 9. their blood ſhall bee required at their owne hands.
            
            
               Theol.
               You haue ſpoken the truth. And therfore, ſith ſome muſt needs take vpon them this ſo great a charge, it will bée our beſt courſe, to labour much with them in Catechiſing, and priuate inſtructions: and that in moſt familiar and plaine manner. For much good hath béene done, and is done, this way. The ignorant ſort muſt be much labored vpon this way: and ſo, no doubt, much good may be done.

For, in all labour there is profit. Héerein, wePro. 14. 23. (that are the Miniſters of Chriſt) muſt be content to bée abaſed, and to teach the poore ignorant people in moſt plaine maner, aſking them many eaſie queſtions, & often queſtioning with them in moſt plaine and louing maner, till we haue brought them to ſome taſte and ſmacke of the principles of Chriſtian Religion. We muſt not be aſhamed to vſe repetitions, and tautologies, and to tell them one thing twenty times ouer, and ouer againe, héere a line, and there a line: héere a little, and there a little: preceptIſa. 28. 10. vpon precept, as the Prophet ſpeaketh. I know riht well, nothing goeth more againſt the ſtomacke of a ſcholar, and him that is learned indéede, then to doe thus. It is as irkeſome and tedious, as to teach A. B. C. Some can, at no hand, endure it. But truely, truely I finde now, after long experience, that if we will doe any good to theſe ſimple and ignorant ſoules, we muſt enter into this courſe: and wée may not be aſhamed of it. For, it will be our crowne, and our glory, to winne ſoules, howſoeuer wée be abaſed. Let vs therefore be well content to ſtoupe downe, that Chriſt may be exalted. Let vs be abaſed, that God may be honoured. Let vs doe all things in great loue to Chriſt, who hath ſaid: If thou loueſt me, feede, feede, feedeIoh. 21. 15. my flocke. Let vs therefore teſtifie our loue to

him, by féeding his flocke. Let vs doe all things in great loue and déepe compaſſion towards the poore ſoules, that goe aſtray. As it is ſaid, that our Lord Jeſus was mooued to pity, and his bowels did yearne, to ſée the people as ſhéepe without a ſhéepeheard. Let it likewiſe mooue vs throughly, and make our hearts to bléede, to ſée ſo many poore ſhéepe of Chriſt wandring and ſtraying in the mountaines, and wilderneſſe of this world, caught in euery bramble, and hanged in euery buſh, ready to be deuoured of the Wolfe. Thus haue I ſhewed you, what courſe (in my iudgement) is beſt to be taken, for the deliuering of poore ignorant ſoules, out of the captiuity of Sathan and ſinne.
            
            
               Phil.
               Now, as you haue declared, what courſe is beſt to be followed of your part, which are the Miniſters and Preachers of the Goſpell; ſo I pray you ſhew, what is beſt to be done of vs, which are the people of God.
            
            
               Theol.
               The beſt counſell that I can giue you if it were for my life, is, to be much exerciſed in the word of God, both in the hearing, reading, and meditation thereof: and alſo to purchaſe, vnto your ſelfe the ſincere miniſtery of the Goſpell, and to make conſcience to liue vnder it, eſtéeming your ſelfe happy if you haue it, though you want other things: and vnhappie if you haue it not, though you haue all other

things. For it is a péereleſſe pearle, an incomparable Jewell. For the purchaſing whereof, we are aduiſed by our Lord Jeſus, to ſel all that we haue, rather then to goe without it. Againe,Mat. 13. 44. our Sauiour Chriſt giueth the ſame counſell, to the Church of Laodicea, in theſe words: I counſellApo. 3. 18 thee, to buy of me gold tried by the fire, that thou maieſt be rich: and white raiment, that thou maiſt be cloathed, and that thy filthy nakedneſſe do not appeare: and annoint thine eies with eie-ſalue, that thou maiſt ſee. Where you ſée, the word of God is compared to moſt pretious gold, whereby we are made ſpiritually rich: and to glittering attire, wherewith our naked ſoules are cloathed: and to an eyeſalue, wherewith our ſpirituall blindneſſe is cured. We are aduertiſed alſo by Jeſus Chriſt whoſe counſell is euer the beſt, that wée ſhould buy theſe things, whatſoeuer they coſt vs. The ſame counſel alſo giueth wiſe Salomon, ſaying, Buy the truth: but ſell it not. So then you ſée,Pro. 23. 23. the counſell which héerein I giue you, is not mine owne; but the counſell of Ieſus himſelfe, and Salomon the wiſe. And who can or who dare except againſt their counſell?
            
            
               Aſune.
               Is your meaning, that men muſt of neceſſitie frequent preaching of the word? will not bare reading ſerue the turne?
            
            
               Theol.
               I tolde you before, that reading is

good, profitable, and neceſſary: but yet it is not ſufficient. We muſt not content our ſelues with that onely: but wée muſt goe further, and get vnto our ſelues the ſound preaching of the Goſpell, as the chiefeſt and moſt princiyall meanes, which God hath ordained and ſanctified, for the ſauing of men. As it is plainely ſet downe, 1. Cor. 1. 21. When as the world (by wiſedome) knew not God, in the wiſedome of God, it pleaſed God, by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, to ſaue them that beleeue. The meaning of it is, that when as men, neither by naturall wiſedome, nor the contemplation of the creatures, could ſufficiently attaine to the true knowledge of God; the Lord, according to his heauenly and infinite wiſedome thought of an other courſe: which is, to ſaue men by preaching; which the world counteth fooliſhneſſe. And by the way note, that the preaching of the word is not a thing of humane inuention: but it is Gods owne deuice, and came firſt out of his braine, as the next and néereſt way to ſaue mens ſoules.
               Wiſe Salomon alſo in the Booke of the Prouerbes telleth vs, that the preaching of Gods word (which hée calleth Uiſion, vſing the word of the Prophets, which called their Sermons Uiſions) is not a thing that may be ſpared, or that wée may be at choiſe whether

we haue it or no: but he maketh it to be of abſolute neceſſity vnto eternall life. For he ſaith, Where viſion faileth, the people are left naked.
                  Pro. 29. 18. So indéede, it is in the Originall. But the old tranſlation giueth vs the ſenſe, thus: Where the word of God is not preached, there the people periſh. Then you ſée that Salomon ſtriketh it dead, in telling vs, that all they which are without preaching of the word, are in excéeding danger of loſing their ſoules. Oh that men could be perſwaded of this! Saint Paul alſo ſaith, that faith commeth by hearing the word preached. For hée ſaith: How can theyRom. 10. 14. heare, without a Preacher? If faith come by hearing the word preached, then I reaſon thus▪ No preaching, no faith: no faith, no Chriſt: no Chriſt, no eternall life. For eternall life is only in him. Let vs then put them together, thus: Take away the word, take away faith: take away faith, take away Chriſt: take away Chriſt, and take away eternall life. So then it followeth; Take away the word, and take away eternall life.
               Or, wée may reade them backeward thus: If we will haue heauen, we muſt haue Chriſt: If we will haue Chriſt, we muſt haue faith. If we will haue faith, we muſt haue the word preached. Then it followeth thus. If we will haue heauen, we muſt haue the word preached.

Then I conclude, that preaching generally, and for the moſt part, is of abſolute neceſſitie vnto eternall life; as meate is of abſolute neceſſity, for the preſeruation of our bodies; as graſſe and fodder are of abſolute neceſſity, for the vpholding of the life of beaſts; and water of abſolute neceſſity, for the life of fiſhes. Then, this being ſo, men are with great care and conſcience to heare the Goſpell preached, to frequent Sermons, to reſort much to Gods houſe and habitation, where his honour dwelleth: with Dauid to ſay; One thing haue I deſiredPſal. 27. 4. of the Lord, that I will require: euen that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord, all the daies of my life; to behold the beautie of the Lord, and to viſit his holy Temple. With godlyLuke. 14. 42. Ioh. 5. 7. 
                  Mary to ſay; One thing is neceſſary; and ſo chooſe the better part. With the poore Cripple at Betheſda, to wait for the moouing of the waters by the Angell, that his impotency may be cured: I meane, that wée ſhould tie our ſelues to the firſt moouing of the ſpirituall waters of life, by the Preachers of the Goſpell; that our ſpiritual impotency may be holpen and relieued. For the miniſtery of the Goſpell is that golden pipe, whereby and where-through all the goodneſſe of GOD, all the ſwéeteneſſe of Chriſt, and all heauenly graces whatſoeuer are deriued vnto vs. Which thing was ſhadowed,

in the law by the Pomegranates in the ſkirts of Arons garments, and the golden Belles betwéene them round about: that is, a golden Bell, and a Pomegranate; a golden Bell, and a Pomegranate. The golden Bellesxod. 28. 33. did ſignifie the preaching of the Goſpel, and the Pomegranates the ſwéet ſauour of Chriſtes death. Noting thereby that the ſwéet ſauour of Chriſts death, and all the benefits of his paſſion, ſhould be ſpread abroad by the preaching of the Goſpell. Thus you ſée, that if euer men purpoſe to be ſaued, they muſt make more account of the preaching of the Goſpel, then they haue done, & not thinke, (as moſt men do) that they may be without it, & yet doe well enough. And ſome had as léeue be without it, as haue it. For it doth but diſquiet them, and trouble their conſciences: but woe be vnto ſuch.

               Yet we ſee, where the word is ſoundly preached, there be many bad people: and the reaſons thereof, in mine opinion, are two. The one, that God taketh his holy ſpirit from many in hearing the word: ſo that their hearing is made vnfruitfull. The other, that the diuell hath an hundred deuices, to hinder the effectuall working of the word: ſo as it ſhall doe no good at all, nor take any effect in multitudes of men. But you, Maſter Theologus, can better laie open this matter,

then I. I pray you therefore ſpeake ſomething of it.
            
            
               Theol.
               The ſleights of Sathan, in this behalfe, are moe and more ſlie, then I, or any man elſe can poſſibly diſcouer. For who is able to deſcrie, or in ſufficient manner, to lay open the déepe ſubtilties, and moſt ſecret and ſinfull ſuggeſtions of the Diuell in the hearts of men: Hée is ſo cunning a crafts maſter this way, that none can perfectly trace him. His workings, in the hearts, of men, are with ſuch cloſe and hid deceits, and moſt methodicall and craftie conueyances, that none can ſufficiently finde them out. But yet notwithſtanding, I will béewray ſo much as I know, or can conceiue of his dealings with men that heare the word, that he may ſteale it out of their hearts, and make it fruitleſſe and vnprofitable. Firſt of all, hée beſtirreth him and laboureth hard, to kéepe men faſt aſléepe in their ſinnes, that they may haue no care at all of their ſaluation: and therefore diſſwadeth them from hearing, or reading the word at all; leſt they ſhould bée awaked. If this will not preuaile, but that they muſt néeds heare, then his craft is, to make their hearing vnprofitable, by ſléepineſſe, dulneſſe by-thoughts, conceitedneſſe, and a thouſand ſuch like. If this will not ſerue

the turne, but that the word doth get within them, and worke vpon them (ſo as thereby they grow to ſome knowledge and vnderſtanding of the truth) then he practiſeth another way, which is, to make them reſt themſelues vpon their bare knowledge, and ſo become altogether conſcienceleſſe. If this will not ſuffice, but that men fall to doing, and leaue ſome ſinnes, eſpecially the groſſe ſinnes of the world, and doe ſome good, then he perſwadeth them to truſt to thoſe doings without Chriſt, and to thinke themſelues well inough, becauſe they doe ſome good, and leaue ſome euill. If this bée not enough, but that men attaine vnto the true iuſtifying faith which apprehendeth Chriſt, and reſteth vpen his merits, then he deuiſeth how to blemiſh the beauty of their faith, and weaken their comfort, through many frailties and wants, yea groſſe downefalles, and ranke euils: ſo as they ſhall bée but ſpotted and leaprous Chriſtians. If this weapon will not worke, but that Chriſtians doe ioyne all good vertues with their faith, and abundantly ſhine foorth in all fruits of righteouſneſſe, then he caſteth about another way: which is, to daunt and dampe them with diſcouragements: as pouertie, neceſſity, ſickneſſe, reproches, contempts, perſecutions &c. If none of all theſe will doe the déeds, but that men conſtantly

beléeue in Chriſt, and patiently, and ioyfully endure all afflictions, then his laſt refuge is, to blow them vp with gun-powder: that is, to puffe them vp with a pride of their gifts, graces and ſtrength, and ſo to giue them an vtter ouerthrow whileſt they doe not walke humbly and giue God the praiſe of his gifts.
               Thus haue you a little taſte of Sathans cunning, in making the word vnfruitfull amongſt vs.

But, the beſt end of ſinne is alwaies repentance: if not in this life, then with woe, and alas, when it is too late.

Where, Zophar plainly ſheweth, that the auoiding of ſinne is our ſtrength, and the committing of it, our weakening.

According to that of Salomon; The way of thePro. 10. 29. Lord is the ſtrength of the vpright man. Therefore walke in the way of God, and take héed of the waies of ſinne. For God puniſheth euery ſinne, his way; ſome one way, and ſome another; and no ſinne can eſcape vnpuniſhed. For becauſe God is iuſt, therfore he muſt néeds puniſh ſinne in all men, though in diuers manners; as the wicked, in their owne perſons; the godly, in Chriſt. Beware of it therefore, and flatter not your ſelfe in your ſinnes. Remember how euery diſobedience, and euery tranſgreſſion, hath had a iuſt recompence of reward. God hath in all ages matched the cauſes withNote how God in all ages hath puniſhed the breakes of his lavv. Exo. 32. 10. Leuit. 10. 2. Num. 15. Num. 15 52. the effect; that is, ſinne with the puniſhment of ſinne. The Iſralites, for breaking the firſt commandement in making other Gods were often ſmitten by the hand of God. Nadab and Abihu, the ſons of Aaron, for the breach of the ſecond commandement, in offering ſtrange fire vpon Gods Altar, were conſumed with fire. He that blaſphemed and tranſgreſſed the third commandement, was ſtoned to death. He that brake the fourth commandement, in gathering ſticks vpon the Sabbath, was likewiſe ſtoned. Abſolon tranſgreſſing the fift Commandement, was hanged in his owne haire.2 Sam. 18. 
                  Cain, tranſgreſſing the ſixt, in flaying his brother Abel, was branded with the markeGen. 4. 15.
                  
of Gods wrath. Sichem the ſonne of Hamor,
                  Gen. 34. 26. tranſgreſſing the ſeuenth, in defiling Dina the daughter of Iacob, was ſlaine by Simeon and Leui, the ſons of Iacob. Achan, ſinning againſtIoſua 7. 25. the eight Commandement, in ſtealing the wedge of Gold, and the Babyloniſh garment,Act. 5. 6. was ſtoned to death. Ananias & Sapphira, ſinning againſt the ninth commandement, in liing and diſſembling, were ſuddenly ſmitten1. Re. 21. 24. with death. Ahab, tranſgreſſing the tenth commandement, in ceueting and diſcententment, was deuoured of dogges. Or if you will haue originall ſinne therein onely forbidden, then infantsRom. 5. 14. are therefore puniſhed with death.
               Thus we ſée there is no dallying with God; but if we ſin, we are as ſure to beierkt for it, as the coat is on our backe. Therfore let vs not deceiue our ſelues, nor make light of ſin. For ſin is no ſcar-bugge; and we ſhall one day finde it ſo. And howſoeuer we make light of ſome ſins, yet in very déed all ſinne is odious in the ſight of God, yea all ſin is hainous and capital, in this reſpect, that it is againſt a perſon of infinite being; it is againſt God himſelfe; it is againſt the higheſt Maieſty. For the greatneſſe of the perſon offended, doth enhaunce and increaſe the greatneſſe of the ſinne.
               As for example: If a man raile at a Juſtice of peace, hée ſhall be ſtocked; if hée raile

We muſt therefore leaue bare words, and come to déeds. For our Lord Ieſus ſaith: Not euery one that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enterMat. 7. 21. into the kingdome of heauen, but he that doth the will of my father which is in heauen. Where wée ſée, Chriſt (in plaine tearmes) doth exclude out of his kingdome, all thoſe whoſe Religion conſiſteth onely in good words and ſmooth ſpéeches: but make no conſcience to practiſe the Commandements of God.
               
                  Dauid, hauing made ſome good preparation for the building of the Temple, and perceiuing his ſonne Salomon to haue ſtuffe and prouiſion enough to perfectt and finiſh it, doth moſt wiſely incourage him to the worke, in theſe words: Vp, and be doing, and the Lord ſhall be with1.

Oh, that men would follow this counſell of Dauid: That they would vp, and bée dooing; And not ſit ſtill, and doe nothing: that they would leaue words and countenances; and ſet vpon the practiſe of Gods Law: and ſtudy with all care and conſcience, to bée obedient to his will. Then aſſuredly God would be with them, and bleſſe them: and much good would come of it.

               The greateſt part of men are like vnto the Gadarens, which eſtéemed their Swine more then Chriſt. As wée ſée in theſe our daies, how many make more account of their kine and ſhéepe, then of the moſt glorious Goſpell of Chriſt. They highly eſtéeme dung, and contemne Pearle. They are carefull for trifles, and regard not the things of greateſt moment. And therefore may very fitly be compared to a man, who hauing his wife and children very ſicke, doth vtterly neglect them, and is altogether carefull for the curing of his hogs eares.

               This is ſhort and ſweet indeed. You haue touched ſome of theſe points before, in this our conference. But I am very deſirous to heare ſomewhat more of the two laſt, which yet haue not beene touched.
            
            
               Theol.
               Sith you are deſirous, I will briefely deliuer vnto you, that which I haue receiued from the Lord. Firſt concerning the day of iudgement, I find in the volume of Gods booke, that it ſhalbe very terrible and dreadfull. For,Math. 24. 30. 
                  The ſonne of man ſhall come in the clouds of heauen, with power and great glory.
               
               S. Peter ſaith; The day of the Lord ſhal come as a thiefe in the night. In the which, the heauens1. Pet. 3. 10. ſhall paſſe away with a noiſe, the elements ſhall melt with heat; & the earth, with the works
                  
                  that are therein ſhall be burnt vp. The Apoſtle telleth vs, that at the comming of Chriſt, all the whole world ſhall bée of a light fire: and that all caſtels, towers, goodly buildings, gold, ſiluer, veluets, ſilkes, and all the glittering hue, glory, and beauty of this world, ſhall be conſumed to powder and aſhes. For he ſaith plainly; The heauens and the earth, which are now, are2. Pet. 3. 7. reſerued vnto fire, againſt the day of iudgemēt, and of the deſtruction of vngodly men. Moreouer, he doth ſtrongly prooue, that as the world was once deſtroied by water; ſo the ſecond time, in the end thereof, it ſhall be deſtroied by fire. The Apoſtle Paul doth witneſſe the ſame2. Theſ. 1. 7. 1. Theſ. 4. 16. thing: For he ſaith; Chriſt ſhal come from heauen, with all his mighty Angels in flaming fire. And in another place, he noteth the terrour of his comming to iudgement, ſaying; He ſhall come with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel, & the trumpet of God. We ſée by experience, that the comming of mortall Princes to any place, is with great pompe & glory. They haue great traines and troupes behind them and before them. They are accompanied with many Nobles, goodly Lords; and gallant Ladies doe attend vpon them. The Sword-bearer, Trumpetters, and harbengers go before; many flaunting and ſtately perſonages follow after. Now then, if the comming of mortall

Princes be ſo pompous, and glorious: how much more glorious ſhall the comming of the ſonne of man be, in whoſe ſight, all mortal princes are but duſt? The Scriptures doe affirme, that his ſecond comming vnto iudgement, ſhall be with ſuch reſplendent and vnſpeakeable glory, that euen the moſt excellent creatures ſhall bluſh at it. For the Sunne ſhall be darkened: theMath. 24. 29. Moone ſhall not giue her light: and the ſtarres ſhall fall from heauen. Meaning thereby, that the moſt glorious and bright-ſhining creatures ſhall be clouded and obſcured, by the vnconceiuable brightneſſe of Chriſts comming.
               Moreouer, is noted vnto vs the terrour of Chriſts comming, in this; that immediatly before it, the very ſea ſhall quake and tremble, and in his kind crie out. For it is ſaid, that theLuk. 21. 25. 1. ſea ſhall roare (and make a noiſe in moſt doleful and lugubrious manner) and mens hearts ſhall faile them for feare, and for looking after thoſe things, which ſhall come on the world: for the powers of heauen ſhall be ſhaken. Oh, what ſhal become of ſwearers, drunkards, whore-mongers, & ſuch like, in that day! They ſhall ſéeke to créepe into an auger hole, to hide their heads. They ſhall then cry wo and alas, that euer they were borne. They ſhal wiſh that they had neuer béen borne, or that their mother had born them toads. And, as it is ſaid in the Apocalyps,
                  
                  They ſhall ſay to the mountains and rocks, FallApoc. 6. 16. on vs, and hide vs from the preſence of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lambe. For the great day of his wrath is come, and who can ſtand?
               
               We ſée therfore, that the comming of Chriſt ſhall not be baſe and contemptible, as in his firſt viſitation: but it ſhall bée moſt terrible, princely, and glorious. And as the Scriptures doe affirme, that his comming ſhall bee with great terror and dread: ſo alſo they doe ſhew, that it ſhall bée very ſudden and vnlooked for. For the day of the Lord ſhall come as a theefe2. Pet. 3. 10. 1. Theſ. 5. 2. Luk. 21. 35. in the night: as the trauell that commeth vpon a woman. As a ſnare ſhall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the earth. That is, it ſhall ſuddenly catch and intangle all men, whereſoeuer they bée in the world: As the Earthquake, which was ſome twentie yéeres agoe, did ſuddenly take the world tardy, they not thinking of any ſuch matter: So ſhall the comming of the ſonne of man to iudgement, take the world tardy and vnprepared. For few there be that thinke of any ſuch matter. Sith therefore the ſecond appearing of Chriſt ſhall bée with ſuch ſuddenneſſe, let vs feare and tremble: for all ſudden things are to be feared.
            
            
               Phila.
               Well ſir, as you haue ſhewed vs the terror, and ſuddenneſſe of Chriſts comming, ſo

ſhew vs the purpoſe and end of his comming.
            
            
               Theol.
               The principall end of his comming, ſhall be to kéepe a generall audit, to call all men to an account, to haue a reckening of euery mans particular actions, & to reward them according to their déeds; as it is written: The SonMath. 16. 27. of man ſhall come in the glory of his Father, with his Angels: and then ſhall he giue to euery man, according to his deeds. Againe, the Apoſtle ſaith to the Corinthians: We muſt all appeare
                  2. Cor. 5. 10. 
                  before the iudgement ſeat of Chriſt, that euery man may receiue the things which are done in his body, according to that which he hath done, whether it be good or euill.
               
               Héere wée doe plainely ſée, that the end of Chriſts comming ſhall be, to iudge euery man according to his works, that is, as his works ſhall declare him, and teſtifie of him and of his faith. In another place the Apoſtle ſaith; That2. Theſ. 1. 9. the end of his comming ſhall be to render vengeance vnto them which know not God, and which obey not the Goſpell of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which ſhall be puniſhed with euerlaſting perdition, from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. Woe then vnto two ſorts of men, the ignorant & the diſobedient. For, the Apoſtle ſaith flatly, they both ſhall be damned. Me thinketh, both the ignorant & diſobedient, & all other prophane men, ſhold tremble

to thinke of this, that Chriſt ſhall come to render vengeance vnto them. If we did certainely know, that the Spaniard ſhould inuade our Nation, ouerrunne it, and make a conqueſt ofNote this. it, that he ſhould ſhead our blood, deſtroy vs, and make a maſſacre amongeſt vs: yea, that wée ſhould ſée our wiues, our children, our kindred and deare friends ſlaine before our faces, ſo as their blood ſhould ſtreame in the ſtréets: what a wonderfull feare and terrour would it ſtrike into vs? we would quake to thinke of it. Shall we not then be much more afraide of the damnation of our ſoules? Shall we not quake, to think, that Chriſt ſhall com to take vengeance? If the Lion roare, all the beaſt of the field tremble, and ſhall not we be afraid of the roaring of the Lion of the Tribe of Iudah? But alas, we are ſo hard hearted, and ſo rockt aſlepe in the cradle of ſecurity, that nothing can mooue vs, nothing can awake vs.
            
            
               Phila.
               Now as you haue ſhewed vs the terror, and end of Chriſts comming: ſo alſo declare the manner of it.
            
            
               Theol.
               The manner of it is this; that the whole world ſhal be cited to appeare perſonally at the generall Aſſiſes, before the great Iudge. No man ſhal be admitted to appeare by his atturney: but all muſt appeare perſonally. None ſhall be ſuffered to put in ſureties: but all muſt

come in their owne perſons, without baile or maine prize; as it is written: We muſt all appeare,
                  2. Cor. 5. 10. high and lowe, rich and poore, king and begger, one and other; as it is plainly ſet down in the 20. Chapter of the Reuelation: where the ſpirit ſaith, I ſawche dead both great and ſmall ſtand before God: and the ſea gaue vp the dead which were in her, and death and hell deliuered vp the dead which were in them. So then it is cléere, that all, without exception, ſhall make their appearance at the great and dreadfull Aſſiſes. Oh what a great day will that be, when as the whole world ſhall appeare together at once! If a king marry his ſonne and dif other Kings, Emperours, Dukes, & Nobles to the marriage, with all their pompe & traine, we vſe to ſay: Oh what a mariage, what a méeting, what a doe, what a great day will there be! but when the vniuerſal world ſhal be aſſembled together (not only al Monarks, Kings, and Princes, but all other, that euer haue béen from the beginning of the world, al that are, and ſhal be) what a day will that be! No maruel therefore, though the Scriptures call it the day of God and the great day of the Lord. Now then when all fleſh is come together, to make their perſonall appearance, then ſhall the ſon of God aſeend vnto his tribunall ſeat, with great Maieſtie and glory. For a fiery ſtreame ſhall iſſue
                  
                  and come foorth before him: thouſand thouſandDan. 7. 10. Angels ſhall accompany him, and miniſter vnto him: and ten thouſand thouſand ſhall ſtand before him: the iudgement ſhall be ſet and the books opened. All the Saints alſo, and true worſhippers of God, ſhall attend him, and accompany him vnto his iudgement ſeat. And not onely ſo, but they ſhall ſit vpon the Bench and Throne, with him; as it is written: The1. Cor. 6. 2. Saints ſhall iudge the world: they ſhall iudge the Angels; that is, the diuels, the Angels of darkneſſe. Our Lord Jeſus himſelfe doth auouch the ſame thing, when he ſaid to his Diſciples, andMat. 19. 28. in them to all true Chriſtians: Verily I ſay vnto you, that when the ſonne of man ſhall ſit in the throne of his Maieſty, yee which followed me in the regeneration, ſhall ſit vpon twelue thrones, and iudge the twelue Tribes of Iſrael. That is, the Saints of God ſhall beare witneſſe that the iudgement of Chriſt, and ſentence of condemnatien which he paſſeth againſt all vnbeléeuers, is according to iuſtice and equity. Thus then we ſée, how Chriſt ſhall be accompanied to his throne; and with what glorie and Maieſtie hée ſhall aſcend vnto it. Experience teacheth, that when mortall Iudges hold their Seſſions and generall Aſſiſes, they are brought vnto the Bench & iudgement ſeat, with pompe and terrour. For the

Shiriffe of the Shire, and Holbard-men, with many Juſtices of peace, and traines of others, doe accompany them vnto the Bench. Then with how much more glory and maieſty ſhall the Sonne of God be brought vnto his royall Throne! Thus then Chriſt being ſet vpon his iudgement ſeat, all the vngodly ſhall bée conuented before him, and he ſhall ſtand ouer them with a naked ſword in his hand. The diuell ſhall ſtand by them on the one ſide, to accuſe them, and their owne conſcience, on the other ſide: and the gaping gulfe of hell, vnderneath them, ready to deucure them. Then ſhall the bookes be opened; not any bookes of paper and parchment, but the books of mens conſciences. For euery mans ſinnes are written and recorded in his conſcience, as it were in a Regiſter booke. Then will God bring euery worke to iudgement, with euery ſecret thought, and ſet them in order before all the Reprobates. Then will God lighten the things that are hid in darkneſſe;1. Cor. 4. 5 and make the counſels of the heart manifeſt. Then ſhall all the vngodly bée arraigned, conuicted, and hold vp their hands at the barre of Chriſts tribunall leat, and ſhall cry guilty. Then ſhall that moſt dreadfull ſentence of death & condemnation be pronouncedMath. 25. 41. againſt them by the moſt righteous Judge, Go ye curſed into euerlaſting fire; which is prepared
                  
                  for the diuell and his Angels. Oh dole full ſentence! Oh heauy hearing! Whoſe heart doth not tremble at theſe things? whoſe haire doth not ſtand vpon his head? For then ſhall thouſands, which in this world haue floriſhed as the cedars of Libanus, be caſt downe for euermore; and ſhall drinke (as a iuſt recompence for their iniquity) of the bitter Cup of Gods eternall wrath & indignation in the kingdome of darkeneſſe, and in the fearefull preſence of Sathan, and all the rurſed enemies of Gods grace.

               Well now as you haue declared vnto vs the terror, the ſuddennes, the end, & the manner of Chriſts comming to iudgement; ſo laſtly ſhew vnto vs, the right vſe of all theſe things.
            
            
               Theol.
               S. Peter telleth and teacheth vs the2. Pet. 3. 11. right vſe of all: for ſaith he; Seeing all theſe things muſt be diſſolued, what manner of perſons ought we to be, in all holy conuerſation & godlines? As if he ſhould ſay; Sith the heauens ſhall paſſe away with a noiſe, the Elements ſhal melt with heat, & the earth, with the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt vp: ſith alſo the cōming of Chriſt ſhall be with great terror, to a feareful end, & in fearefull maner; O how ought we to excell in goodnes! So then S. Peter telleth vs, that the true vſe of all is this: that hereby we be brought néerer vnto God, euen to be more obedient to his will, & to walk in all his commandements,

making conſcience of all our waies, and ſtudying to pleaſe God in all things, and to be fruitfull in all good works, liuing ſoberly, iuſtly, & holily in this preſent euill world, and ſhewing foorth the vertues of him which hath called vs out of darkeneſſe to this maruellous light; ſo that we may be prepared againſt the day of his appearing, that it may not take vs tardy. For our life ought to be a continuall meditation of death. We ſhould alwaies liue as if wée ſhould die, or that our bed ſhould bée our graue: we muſt liue continually, as if Chriſt ſhould come to iudgement preſently. As it is reported of a godly man in the Primitue church; that whether he eat or dranke, or whatſoeuer he did, hée thought alwaies hée heard the trumpet of the Lord, with theſe words; Ariſe yee dead, and come vnto iudgement. Put caſe it were certainly knowne, that Chriſt wold come to iudgement the next Midſommer-day; Oh what an alteration wold it make in the world, how would men change their minds & affections! who would care for this world! who would ſet his heart vnto riches! Who would regard braue apparel! Who durſt deceiue or oppreſſe! who durſt be drunke! Who durſt ſweare, lie, and commit adultery! Nay, would not all men giue vp themſelues to the obedience of God? would not all ſerue him diligently? would

not all men and women flocke to Sermons? would they not giue themſelues to praier and reading? would they not repent them of their ſinnes? would they not cry for mercy and forgiueneſſe? Sée then, what the knowledge of a certaine day approaching would effect. And ought we not to doe all theſe things with as great care & zeale, ſéeing the day is vncertaine? For, who knoweth whether Chriſt will come this moneth, or the next; this yeere, or next? HeMat. 24. 44. himſelfe ſaith; Be ready, watch: for, in the houre that ye thinke not of, will the ſon of man come. We thinke he wil not come this yéere, nor next yeere, nor this hundred yéere. It may be therefore, that he will come ſuddenly vpon vs: we know not how ſoone. For in an houre that we little thinke of, will he come. Therfore our Sauiour ſaith in the 13. Chapter of Mark. Take
                  
                  Mark. 13. 33. 
                  heed, watch and pray: for, you know not when the time is. And in the Goſpell of S. Luke, heLuke 21. 34. ſaith; Take heed that your hearts be not ouercome with ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe, and the cares of this life; and ſo that day come vpon you vnawares. For, as a ſnare ſhall it come vpon all them that dwell vpon the face of the earth. We heare therefore how many watch words and caueats our Sauiour giueth vs, when he ſaith: Be in readineſſe, awake, take héed, watch and pray, and looke about you, leſt that day come

ſuddenly vpon you, and take you napping. It ſtandeth vs all therfore vpon, to be at an houres warning, vpon paine of death, and as we will anſwer it at our vttermoſt perill.

               Concerning the torments of hell, (I do note thrée things which I will briefly ſpeake of) and they be theſe: The extremity, perpetuity, and remedileſneſſe thereof. Firſt, touching the extremity thereof, it ſtandeth ſpecially in theſe thrée things. Firſt, that it is a ſeparation from all ioy and comfort of the preſence of God. Secondly, that it is an eternall fellowſhip with the diuell and his angels. Thirdly, it is a féeling of the horrible wrath of God; which ſhall ſeize vpon body and ſoule & ſhall feed on them (as fire deth vpon pitch and brimſtone) for euer. TheApo. 21. 8. Luke. 13. 28. Mat. 9. 44. ſcriptures do note the extremity of it, in calling it a lake, that burneth with fire & brimſtone, for euer: in ſaying, there ſhal be weeping & gnaſhing of teeth: in affirming, that their worme dieth not, (meaning the worme that gnaweth their cōſcience, or their torment of conſcience) & the fire neuer goeth out: in tearming it Tophet, which is deepe and large: & the burning thereof is fire and much wood:
                   and that the breath of the Lord, as a riuer of brimſtone, doth kindle it All theſe things hée terrible to our ſenſes: and yet can they not fully expreſſe the thing, as it

is indéed. For, no heart can conceiue, or tongue expreſſe the greatneſſe and extreamity of the torments of hell. As the ioyes of heauen neuer entred into the heart of man: no more did the torments of hell. All the torments and troubles that fall vpon men in this life, are but as ſparkles of the fornace of Gods totall wrath. All fires are but as it were pictures of fire, in compariſon of hell fire. For as one writeth: Hell fire is ſo extreamely hot, that it wil burne vp a man ſeuen mile, before he come at if. Yet the reprobates, being alwaies in it, ſhall neuer be conſumed of it. As the Salamander is alwaies in the fire, and neuer conſumeth ſo the wicked ſhall be alwaies in the fire of hell, & neuer conſume. For hell is a death alwaies liuing, & an end alwaies beginning. It is a grieuous thing to a man that is very ſick, to lie vpon a featherbed: how much more vpon a hot gridiron! but how moſt of all to burne alwaies in hell fire, & neuer be conſumed! An other extreamity of it conſiſſeth in this, that the torments of hell are vniuerſall: that is, in euery memberat once: head, eies, tongue, téeth, throat, ſtomacke, backe, belly heart, ſides, &c. All puniſhments of this life are particular. For ſome are pained in their head, ſome in their backe, ſome in their ſtomacke, &c. Yet ſome particular paines are ſuch, as a man would not ſuffer, to gaine all the world. But, for a man to be tormented

in all parts at once, what ſight more lamentable! who could but take pity of a dog in the ſtréet, in that caſe! Thus then wée ſée, that the extremity of Hell torments is greater, then can be conceiued or vttered. For, who can vtter that, which is incomprehenſible? We can go no further in comprehending that which is incomprehenſible, then to know it to be incomprehenſible.

               As you haue ſhewed vs the extremitie of Hell torments: ſo now proceed to the perpetuity.
            
            
               Theol.
               The Scriptures do ſet forth the perpetuity of hell torments, in ſaying: they are for euer. The wicked ſhall be caſt into the lake, that burneth with fire and brimſtone for euer. The fire neuer goeth out. When as many hundred thouſand yéeres are expired, as there be ſtones by the Sea ſide: yet ſtill there be ſo many more to come. For that which hath no end, can neuer come to an end. If all the Arithmeticians in the world were ſet a worke to do nothing but number all the daies of their life, euen the greateſt numbers that they could poſſibly ſet down, and ſhould in the end adde all their numbers together; yet could they neuer come any thing néere to that length of time, wherein the wicked ſhalbe tormented. If the whole circumference of the heauens were writtē about with figures

of Arithmeticke, from the Eaſt to the Weſt, and from the Weſt to the Eaſt againe; yet could it not containe that infinite time, and innumerable yéeres, wherein all vnbeléeuers ſhal ſuffer eternall torture. For, in things infinite, time hath no place. For time is the meaſure of thoſe things which are ſubiect to meaſure. Therefore, becauſe Hell torments are infinite, they cannot be meaſured by any time: neither can that which is infinite, be diminiſhed. For if you ſubtract from that which is infinite, ten thouſand thouſand millions of milions, yet it is thereby nothing diminiſhed or made leſſe. Put caſe a man ſhould once in an hundred thouſand yéeres, take a ſpooneful of water, out of the great Ocean Sea, how long would it be, ere hée had ſo emptied it! Yet ſhall a man ſooner empty the Sea, by taking out a ſpoonfull once in a hundred thouſand yéeres, then the damned ſoule ſhall haue any eaſe. Therfore a certain writer ſaith, If a damned ſoule might be tormented in Hell but a thouſand yeeres, and then haue eaſe, there were ſome comfort in it: (ſor then there would be hope it would come to an end,) but, ſaith he, this word euer killeth the hart. Oh conſider this yée that forget God! O yée carnall worldlings, thinke on this in time! For, if you will not now be moued in hearing, you ſhal be thē cruſhed in péeces in feeling. What auaileth it, to liue in all

poſſible pleaſures, and carnall delights héere, for ſome 60. yéeres, and then to ſuffer this eternall torment? What ſhal it profit a man, to win the whole world & loſe his ſoule? they be more then mad, which will hazard their ſoules, for a little profit, and a few ſtinking pleaſures. But this is the nature of men; they will haue the preſent ſwéet (come of it what wil) though they pay neuer ſo deare for it: though they goe to the higheſt price: though hey loſe their ſoules for it. Oh the vnſpeakeable blindnes & madnes of the men of this world! The diuell hath put out their eies: & therfore leadeth them whither he liſt. For who cannot lead a blind man whither he liſt? Nahaſh1. Sam. 11. 2. the Ammonite would make no couenant with the Iſraelites, but vpon condition that he might put out all their right eies. So the diuel doth couenāt with al the wicked, to put out both their eies; that he may lead them directly into Hell.
            
            
               Phila.
               Now ſir, a word or two more of the remedileſneſſe of hell fire.
            
            
               Theol.
               The ſcriptures do affirme, that as the torments of hel are extreme, ſo they are without all hope of remedy; as it is written: A man canPſal. 49. 8. by no meanes redeeme his brother; he can not giue his ranſome vnto God: ſo precious is the redemption of the ſoule, and the continuance for euer. To this purpoſe Abraham ſaid to theLuke 16. 26. rich man, being in hell torments: Betwixt you
                  
                  and vs, there is a great gulfe ſet; ſo that they which would goe from hence to you, cannot: neither can they come from thence, to vs. Our Lord Jeſus alſo ſaith; What ſhall a man giueMath. 16. for the recompence of his ſoule? Where our Sauiour doth plainely affirme, that there is no ranſome or recompence, though neuer ſo great, to be giuen for a damned ſoule. For the ſoule being in Hell, can neuer be releaſed, it is paſt remedy. No meanes whatſoeuer can doe any good. No gold, no ſiluer, no friends, no riches, no power, no policy, no flattery, no bribery, no reach, no fetch or deuice whatſoeuer can preuaile one iot. For a man being once in Hell, hath no remedy. He is in cloſe priſon, he is ſhut vp vnder the hatches for euer: there is no getting out againe. He muſt ſuffer perpetuall impriſonment. He cannot bring a writ of falſe impriſonment: (becauſe hée is laid in by the moſt righteous and iuſt Judge, who cannot poſſibly doe any wrong,) but he muſt lie by it. For béeing there once, he is there for euer. If all the Angels of Heauen ſhould entreat for a damned ſoule: If Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, ſhould make great ſute: If all the Prophets, Apoſtles & Martyrs, ſhold be continuall ſolicitors of Chriſt for releaſe: if the father ſhould make requeſt for his ſon, or the mother for her daughter: yet can none of theſe be heard: they muſt all haue the

repulſe. For, the ſentence of Chriſt cannot be reuerſed; his decrée is vnrepealeable. The due conſideration of theſe things, may make all hearts to quake, and all knées to tremble. In the troubles and afflictions of this life, though a man come in neuer ſo great dangers, yet he may winde out againe, by one meanes or another, by mony, or friendſhip, or rewards, or ſuch like meanes: but in Hell fire this is it that gripes, & maketh the heart deſpaire, that there is no remedy at all to be vſed. If we ſhould aſke of a damned ſoule, or an afflicted conſcience, what they would giue for the eaſe and redemption of their ſoules: they would anſwere, the whole world; howſoeuer ſecure worldlings, and wicked Atheiſts (which ſee nothing, nor feele nothing) make nothing of it.
               Héere, by the way, let vs conſider the greatneſſe of the loſſe of a mans ſoule; which we ſhall the better perceiue and ſée into, if we can aright value and priſe the ſoule. If therefore it be demaunded, what is the price of the ſoule, or what is it worth; our Lord Jeſus anſwereth; that it is more worth, then all the world. For ſaith he, What ſhall it profit a man, to win all theMath. 16. world, and loſe his ſoule? Therefore the ſoule of the pooreſt begger is more worth then all the world. Then I reaſon thus: if the ſoule bée more worth then all the world, then the loſſe of

it is greater, then the loſſe of the whole world. For indéed it is a loſſe of all loſſes; an vnrecouerable loſſe. If a man ſhould haue his houſe burnt ouer his head, and all that he hath conſumed in one night, it were a great loſſe. If a Merchant venturer ſhould loſe twenty thouſand pound in one venture, in one ſhippe, or, as they ſay, in one bottome, it were a very great loſſe. If a king ſhould loſe his crowne and kingdome, it were an excéeding great loſſe. But the loſſe of the ſoule is a thouſand time more than all theſe: it is a matter of infinite importance. If a Tenant bée caſt out of the fauour of his Landlord, it is a matter of griefe. If a Noblemans Secretary be caſt out of fauour with his Lord, ſo that hée taketh a pritch againſt him, it is a matter of great ſorrow. If a Nobleman himſelfe be diſcountenanced, & caſt out of all fauour with his Prince, that was in great fauour, it is a corſey, a heart ſmart, and a matter of excéeding gréeuance. But, to be eternally ſeparated from God, to be ſhut out of his fauor, and to be caſt away from his preſence, and the preſence of his Angels, is a matter of infinit more dolour and torment. Marke then and behold, what a thing it is for a man to loſe his ſoule. Oh therefore that men would bée wiſe in Gods feare, that they would looke out in time, & make prouiſion for their ſoules. Now then, to cloſe vp

this whole point, the ſumme of all that hath béene ſaid, is this: That the torments of Hell are endleſſe, eaſeleſſe, and remedileſſe.

               The laying open of theſe doctrines of hell fire, and the iudgement to come, maketh me quake and tremble: I am thereby much perplexed, I feele great terror in my conſcience, I am afraid I ſhall be damned.

               Damned, man! What ſpeake you of damning? I am aſhamed to heare you ſay ſo. For it is well knowen that you are an honeſt man, a quiet liuer, a good neighbour, and as good a towns man, as any is in the pariſh where you dwell: and you haue alwaies beene ſo reputed and taken. If you ſhould be damned, I know not who ſhall be ſaued.

               I regard not your flatteries, I beleeue God; I beleeue his word. I beleeue thoſe things which M. Theologus hath alleaged out of the holy ſcriptures, pointing me both to the chapter, and the verſe: and whether it bee more meet that I ſhould beleeue the Scriptures, or your ſoothings, iudge you. No, no: Now I doe clearely ſee by the glaſſe of Gods law, that my ſtate is wretched and miſerable. For I haue liued in ſinne and ignorance all the daies of my life, being vtterly void of all Religion, and true knowledge of God. I am not the man indeed that you and others take me for. For though

outwardly I haue liued honeſtly to the worldward, yet inwardly I haue not liued religiouſly to Godward.

               Becauſe they be no better. They be goodly geere, trimme ſtuffe. They are good to kindle a fire, or to ſcoure a hot ouen withall. And ſhall I tell you my opinion of them? I doe thus thinke, that they were deuiſed by the diuell, ſeene and allowed by the Pope, printed in hell, bound vp by Hobgoblin; and firſt publiſhed and diſperſed in Rome, Italy, and Spaine: and all to this end, that thereby men might be kept from the reading of the Scriptures. For euen as a Lapwing with her buſie cry, draweth men away from her neſt: ſo the Popiſh generation, by theſe fabulous deuices, draw men from the Scriptures.

               I am the better for you Sir, I thanke God. I neuer knew what ſinne meant till this day. It hath pleaſed God now to giue mee ſome ſight and feeling thereof. I am greatly diſtreſſed in my conſcience to thinke what I haue beene. The remembrance of my former ſinnes doth ſtrike an horror into me, when I conſider how ignorantly and prophanely, and how farre off from God, I haue liued all my life: it ſtinges and gripes me to the heart. I doe now ſee that which I neuer ſaw; and feele that which I neuer felt. I doe plainly ſee that if I had died in that ſtate wherein I haue liued all my life, I ſhould certainely haue beene condemned, and ſhould haue periſhed for euer in my ſinne and ignorance.

               I am very glad that God hath opened your eies, and giuen you the ſight and féeling of your miſerie, which indéed is the very firſt ſtep to eternal life. It is a great fauour and ſpecial mercy of God towards you, that he hath ſo touched your heart: you can neuer be thankfull enough for it. It is more then if you had a million of gold giuen you. It is the onely rare

priuiledge of Gods elect, to haue the eies of their ſoules opened, that they may ſée into heauenly and ſpirituall things. As for the world, it is iuſt with God, to leaue them in their blindneſſe.

               I do feele the burden of my ſins, I am greatly grieued for them, I am weary of them, I am ſory that euer I ſinned againſt God, or that I ſhould be ſuch a wretch as to incur his diſpleaſure, and prouoke his Maieſtie againſt me. But I pray you good M. Theologiu, ſith you are a ſpirituall Phyſician, and I am ſicke of ſinne, that you would miniſter vnto mee, out of Gods word, ſome ſpirituall Phyſicke, and comfort.
            
            
               Theol.
               Truely, I muſt néeds thinke that the promiſes of mercy and forgiueneſſe of ſinne, made in the Goſpell, doe belong vnto you, and that Jeſus Chriſt is yours: you are truely intereſted in him, and haue a proper right vnto him. For hée came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance. You doe now féele your ſelfe to be a finner, you are grieued for your ſins, you are wearie of them: therefore Jeſus Chriſt is for you: all the benefits of his paſſion belong to you. Againe he ſaith, The whole need not theMatt. 9. 12. Phyſician, but they that are ſicke. But you doe acknowledge your ſelfe to be ſicke of ſin: therefore Chriſt Jeſus wil be your Phyſician; he wil ſwaddle you, and lappe you; hee will binde vp all your ſores; he wil heale al your wounds; he

will annoint them with the oyle of his mercy; he will ſmile vpon you, and ſhew you a ioyfull countenance; he will ſay vnto you, your ſins are forgiuen.
               In him you ſhall haue reſt and peace to your ſoule: Through him, you ſhall haue eaſe and comfort. For he taketh pity of all ſuch as mourne for their ſinnes, as you doe. Hée diddeth you, and all that are in your caſe, to come vnto him, and he will helpe you. Come vnto me
                  Math. 11. 28. (ſaith he,) all yee that are weary and heauy loaden, and I will eaſe you. You are one of them that are bid to come: for you are weary of your ſinnes, you féele the burden of them. Chriſt is altogether for ſuch as you are. He regardeth not the world, that is, the prophane and vnregenerate men. He bids not them come, he praieth not for them. I pray not for the world, ſaith hée.Ioh. 17. 9. They haue no part nor intereſt in him. They haue nothing to do with him, nor with his merits & righteouſneſſe. He is onely for the penitent ſinner, & ſuch as mourne for their ſins. He is a pillow of downe to all aking heads, & aking conſciences. Be of good comfort therefore, feare nothing: for aſſuredly Chriſt and all his righteouſneſſe is yours. He will cloath you with it. He will neuer impute your ſins 
                     〈◊〉

happy are you that haue ſuch a Mediator and high Prieſt. Reſt therefore wholly vpon him, and vpon that perfect, eternal, and propitiatory ſacrifice which hée hath once offered. Apply Chriſt, apply his merits, apply the promiſes to your ſelfe, and to your owne conſcience: ſo ſhall they doe you good & bring great comfort to your ſoule. For put caſe you had a moſt excellent and ſoueraigne ſalue, which would cure any wound it were laide vnto; yet if you ſhould locke it vp in your cheſt, & neuer apply it to your wound, what good could it doe you? Euen ſo the righteouſnes & merits of Chriſt are a ſpirituall ſalue, which will cure any wound of the ſoule: but if we doe not apply them to our ſelues by faith, they can doe vs no good. You muſt therefore apply Chriſt, & all the premiſes of the Goſpel, to your ſelfe by faith, & ſtand fully perſwaded, that whatſoeuer he hath done vpon the Croſſe, he hath done for you particularly. For what is the iuſtifying faith, but a full perſwaſion of Gods particular loue to vs in Chriſt? The generall & confuſed knowledge of Chriſt & of his Goſpell, auaileth not to eternal life. Labour therefore to haue the true vſe of all theſe great and precious promiſes: ſticke faſt to Chriſt, for through him only we haue remiſſion of ſins, and eternall life. To him all the Prophets giue witneſſe (ſaith S.Act. 10. 45. 
                  Peter) that through his name, al that beleue ſhal
                  
                  receiue remiſſion of their ſins. Where the Apoſtle telleth vs, that if a graund Jury of prophets were panelled to teſtifie of the way & meanes to eternal life, they would al with one cōſent bring in a verdit, that remiſſiō of ſins & eternal life are only in Chriſt. Let vs heare the fore-man ſpeak, & one or two of the reſt, for in the mouth of two or thrée witneſſes ſhall euery word ſtand. The Prophet Eſay ſaith: He was wounded for ourEſa. 53. 5 tranſgreſſions; he was broken for our iniquities; the chaſtiſement of our peace was vpon him, & with his ſtripes we are healed. This great Prophet we ſée doth plainly affirme, that Chriſt ſuffered for our ſins & by his ſuffering we are ſaued. The Prophet Ieremy teſtifieth the ſame thing, ſaying; Behold the daies come (ſaith the Lord)Ier. 23. 5 
                  that I wil raiſe vnto Dauid a righteous branch & a king ſhall raigne and proſper, & ſhall execute iudgment & iuſtice in the earth. In his daies, Iudah ſhall be ſaued, & Iſrael ſhal dwell ſafely; and this is the name wherby they ſhall call him; the Lord our righteouſnes. This Prophet tumpeth with the other. For he ſaith, that Chriſt is the righteous branch, & that he is our righteouſnes, which is al one as if he had ſaid, our ſins are pardoned only through him, & through him we are made righteous. Moreouer he affirmeth, that Iudah & Iſrael, that is, the Church, ſhall be ſaued by him. The Prophet Zachary, that I may ſpeake

it with reuerence, telleth the ſame tale word for word. Hée auoucheth the ſame thing with the other two Prophets. For he ſaith: In that day a Fountaine ſhall be opened to the houſe of
                  Zach. 13. 1. 
                  Dauid, and to the inhabitants of Ieruſalem for ſinne, and for vncleanneſſe.
                   The meaning of the prophet is, that in the daies of Chriſts kingdome, the fountaine of Gods mercy in Chriſt, ſhould be opened, and let out, to waſh away the ſinnes and vncleanneſſe of the Church. So then we ſée, that theſe thrée great witneſſes doe all agrée in this, that through Chriſt onely, wée are waſhed from our ſins, and through him onely wée are made righteous. Séeing then that eternall life is onely in the ſonne, therefore he that hath the ſon hath life. Be of good courage therefore, O Aſunetus, for no doubt you haue the ſon, & therfore eternal life. Feare not your ſins, for they cannot hurt you. For as all the righteouſnes of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, and all the moſt righteous men that euer liued vpon the face of the earth, if it were yours, could doe you no good, without Chriſt; ſo all the ſinnes in the world can do you no hurt, being in Chriſt. For there is no condemnation to them which are inRom. 8. 1. Chriſt Ieſus. Plucke vp a good heart therfore, be no more heauy and ſadde; for if you be found in Chriſt, clothed with his perfect righteouſneſſe, being made yours through faith, what can the

diuel ſay to you? what can the Law doe? They may wel hiſſe at you, but they cannot ſting you: they may grin at you, but they cannot hurt you. For who ſhall lay any thing to the charge ofRom. 8. 33. Gods elect? It is God that iuſtifieth; who ſhall condemne? It is Chriſt which is dead, or rather which is riſen againe, who is alſo at the right hand of God, & maketh requeſt for vs. ReioicePhil. 4. 4. in the Lord therfore: & againe I ſay reioice. For greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the world: our Lord Jeſus is ſtronger then all. None can plucke you out of his hands: he is a ſtrong Mediator; he hath conquered all our ſpiritual enemies; he hath ouer come hell, death, & damnation; he hath led captiuitie captiue; he hath ſpoiled principalities & powers; and hathCol. 2. 15. made an open ſhew of them, & triumphed ouer them in his croſſe. He hath moſt triumphantly ſaid, O death, I will be thy death; O graue, I wilHoſ. 13. 14. 1. Cor. 15. 55. be thy deſtruction: O death where is thy ſting? O hell where is thy victorie? Séeing then you haue ſuch a Mediator and high Prieſt, as hath conquered the helliſh armie, and ſubdued all infernall power, what néed you to doubt, what néed you to feare any more? Moreouer you are to vnderſtand, and to be perſwaded, that Gods mercy is excéeding great towards penitent ſinners, & all ſuch as mourne for their tranſgreſſions;Ezech. 18. according as he ſaith: At what time ſoeuer
                  
                  a ſinner doth repent him of his ſinnes from the bottome of his heart, he will put them all out of his remembrance. The Prophet Dauid doth moſt liuely & fully deſcribe vnto vs, the mercifull nature of God, in the 103. Pſalme; where he ſaith: The Lord is full of compaſſion andPſal. 103. mercy, ſlow to anger, & of great kindnes: he wil not alwaies chide, neither keepe his anger for euer; he hath not dealt with vs after our ſins, nor rewarded vs according to our iniquities. For as high as the heauen is aboue the earth, ſo great is his mercy towards thoſe that feare him. As far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſo far hath he remoued our ſins from vs. As a father hath compaſſion on his children; ſo hath the Lord compaſſion on them that feare him. For he knoweth whereof we be made; he remembreth that we are but duſt. The Hiſtorie of the loſt ſonne doth moſt notably ſet foorth the wonderfull mercie of God towards penitent ſinners. There is ſhewed, how the Lord doth embrace, tender & make much of ſuch poore ſinners, as haue broken and contrite hearts for their ſinnes: for it is ſaide; that when the father ſaw his repenting ſonne aLuk. 15. great way off, he had compaſſion on him, and ran and fell on his necke, and kiſſed him, and cloathed him with the beſt robe, put it on him, put a ring on his hand, & ſhooes on his féet, and cauſed the fat calfe to be killed for him. Euen ſo

the euer laſting father doth reioyce at the conuerſion of any of his loſt ſons. Yea, there is ioy in the preſence of the angels of God, for one ſinner that conuerteth. Moreouer the Lord doth moſt liuely expreſſe his merciful nature and diſpoſition, in this, that he is very loath we ſhould periſh & willingly caſt away our ſelues. Therfore often in the holy ſcriptures he doth mourne for vs, bewaile our wretchednes, and taketh vp many pitifull complaints and lamentations forPſal 81. 13. vs, ſaying: Oh that my people had hearkned vnto me, and Iſrael had walked in my waies. And againe: Oh that thou hadſt hearkened vnto my commandements; then had thy proſperity beenEſay 48. 18. as the floud, and thy righteouſneſſe as the waues of the Sea. Againe he mourningly complainethHoſ. 6. 4. by his Prophet Hoſea, ſaying: Oh Ephraim, what ſhall I do vnto thee? Oh Iudah, how ſhall I entreat thee? And in another place: What could I doe more vnto my vineyard that I haue not done? Mark here how compaſſionately the Almighty God doth yearn ouer vs, and euen as it were blée
                     •
                   vpon our wounds. The Apoſtle alſo doth note the rich mercy, & maruellous loue of God to mākind, in this, that he doth beſéech vs, & pray vs by the miniſters of the goſpel, that we would be reconciled vnto him. The words are theſe: Now then are we embaſſadors for Chriſt,2. Cor. 5. as though God did beſeech you through vs, we
                  
                  pray you in Chriſts ſted, that you be reconciled vnto God. Is it not a ſtrange thing that the omni potent God, ſhould fall to intreating of vs poore wretches? It is all one, as if a King ſhould intreat a begger, whom he may will and commaund: But the abundant mercy of God towards mankind, doth moſt of all conſiſt in this, that he hath giuen his onely ſonne for vs, when we were his enemies. As it is written: GodIohn 3. ſo loued the world, that he hath giuen his onely begotten ſonne; that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life. Againe: God ſetteth out his loue towards vs,Rom. 5. 8. ſeeing that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for vs: much more then being now iuſtified by his bloud, we ſhalbe ſaued frō wrath through him. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his ſon, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaued by his life. In all this then wée may cléerely behold the infinite mercy of God towards vs poore ſinners. For is it not a great matter that the ſonne of God ſhould take our nature vpon him, ſhould be ſo abaſed as he was, & ſhould humble himſelfPhil. 2. 8. to death, euen to the death of the Croſſe? For as the ſhadow of the Diall went backe ten degrées that Ezechias might receiue length of daies, & much happineſſe: ſo Chriſt, the ſonne of righteouſneſſe, hath gone backe many degrées, that we

might haue eternall life. His humiliation therefore, is our exaltation: his ſufferings our ioy: his death, our life. For we haue no other remedy or refuge but onely his merits & righteouſnes. He is our city of refuge, whither we muſt fly & where we muſt take ſanctuary. He is theIer. 8. Iohn 5. 2. Balme of Gilead, whereby our ſoules are cured. He is that poole of Betheſda, where euery man may bée cured of what diſeaſe ſo euer hée2. King. 5 hath. He is the riuer of Iordan, where Naaman may waſh away all his Leproſie. He is that Pellican, who by pecking a hole in his owne breſt, doth reſtore his yong to life againe by his blood. Yet one thing we muſt note by the way, which hath béene partly touched before: that al the mercy of God, and merits of Chriſt, are to be reſtrained onely to the elect: only to the true members of the Church. As plainely appeareth in the 103. Pſalm. Where the mercies of God, which there are largely deſcribed, are reſtrained onely to them that feare him, kéepe his couenant, & thinke vpon his Commandements to do them. And touching Chriſt, it is ſaid, thatPſal. 130. Heb. 5. 6. he is a prince, & a Sauiour vnto Iſrael: & that he ſhall redéeme Iſrael from all his iniquities. Againe it is written: That Chriſt being conſecrate, was made the author of eternall ſaluation, to them that obey him. None do or can obey him, but onely the Elect: therefore he is the authour

of ſaluation onely to the Elect. And conſequently, the prophane world, whatſoeuer they ſay, whatſoeuer they brag & boaſt, haue no true title or intereſt in him. This thing was figured in the law, in this, that the mercy ſeate, which was a type of Gods mercy in Chriſt, & the Arke which was a figure of the Church, were by the expreſſe commandement of God, fitted each to other, both in length and breadth. For as the Arke was two cubits and a halfeExod. 25. 10. long, & a cubit and a halfe broad: iuſt ſo was the mercy ſeate. Noting thereby, that the mercy of God in Chriſt, ſhould onely bée fitted to his church, & belong only to the Church: ſo as not one without the Church ſhould be ſaued. For he that hath not the church for his mother, cannot haue God for his father. Laſtly we are to obſerue, that as God is infinit in mercy, & of great compaſſion towards penitent ſinners: ſo alſo is he moſt conſtant in the courſe of his mercies towards his children. And therefore one of the Pſalmes carrieth this foote: His mercy endurethPſal. 138. for euer; his mercy endureth for euer; his mercy endureth for euer. Noting thereby both the conſtancy and eternity of Gods mercy. To the ſame purpoſe it is thus written: It is the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed; it is becauſeLament. 3. 22. his compaſſions faile not. Let vs know therefore, that God, as touching his mercy to his

children, is of a moſt conſtant and vnchangable nature. As he ſaith: I am the Lord I change not. For if God were of a changeable nature, as we are, and ſubiect to paſſions, then were we in a moſt miſerable caſe. Then muſt he néeds ſmite vs downe, and take vengeance of vs euery day and euery houre in the day: becauſe we prouoke him euery day, & euery houre in the day. But the God of heauen is not as a man, that he ſhould be ſubiect to paſſions and affections: he is of a moſt conſtant and immutable nature. For though wée prouoke him euery day with new ſinnes, yet is he ſo farre off from taking reuenge, that the next day he rewardeth vs with new mercies, and breaketh through all our vnkindeneſſe, to ſhew kindneſſe vnto vs: and through all our naughtineſſe to doe vs good. All our infirmities cannot make him breake off with vs, or ceaſe to loue vs. He is content to take vs with all faults: and to loue vs dearely, though we haue great faults. He regardeth not our infirmities, though we be oftentimes waiward and eluiſh, yet for all that, he loueth vs neuertheleſſe. Euen as a louing mother, though her young ſuckling crie all night, and be excéeding treafe and weiward, ſo as ſhe cannot reſt an houre in the night: yea, though ſhe endure much loathſomneſſe & trouble with it, yet in the morning, when ſhe ariſeth, ſhe loueth

it neuertheleſſe, but dandles it, plaieth with it, ſmileth and laugheth vpon it: ſo the God of all mercies, whoſe loue towards vs far paſſeth the loue of mothers, though we gréeue him with our infirmities continually, yet loueth vs neuertheleſſe, and is content to put vp all, to forget and forgiue all: for he is a moſt conſtant louer. Where he once ſets and ſettles his loue, he loueth moſt conſtantly, nothing can alter him, nothing can remoue him, Euen as a Father, when his little childe catcheth a fall, breaketh his ſhinnes, and hurteth his face, is ſo far from being offended or diſpleaſed with him therefore, that he doth pity him, and bemone him, ſéeking remedies for his hurt: ſo our mercifull Father, is ſo farre off from being angry & diſpleaſed with vs for ſome ſlips and falles, that he doth the more pity vs, and lament our caſe. Euen as a louing and wiſe husband, though his wife haue many infirmities, yet knowing that ſhe loueth him dearely, and that her heart is with him, he is well content to winke at all her faults, to hide them, to beare with them, yea and to make nothing of them, louing her neuertheleſſe for them. So our deare huſband and Spouſe Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe he knoweth we loue him, and that he hath our hearts, is content to beare with all our infirmities, and to make light of them. For this cauſe it is that he ſaith to

his Spouſe in the Canticles: Though ſhe wasCan. 4. 1. blacke and full of infirmities, behold thou art faire my loue, behold thou art faire, thou art all faire my loue, there is no ſpot in thee. Marke that he calleth his Church faire, all faire, and without ſpot, not becauſe ſhe was ſo in herſelf, but becauſe ſhe was made ſo in him. And aſſuredly the eternall God beholding her in his ſon doth ſo eſtéeme and account of her. For as hée that beholdeth any thing thorough a red glaſſe doth take it to be red, as is the colour of the glaſſe; ſo God the Father, beholding vs in his ſon, doth take vs to bée of the ſame nature and quality that he is: that is, perfectly righteous. For this cauſe it is that he loueth vs, & ſetteth his heart vpon vs, and will not be remooued from vs. For his loue to his children, is alwaies one and the ſame: although we haue not alwaies the like ſight and féeling of it. As the Moone is alwaies the ſame in ſubſtance and quantity, though ſometime it ſéemeth vnto vs to be waſted into a very ſmall ſcantling. Let vs know then to our great comfort, that the loue of God towards vs in his deare ſonne, is conſtant and alwaies alike, and that he wil not diſcountenance vs or ſhake vs off for ſome infirmities, no nor yet for many infirmities: for the merciful God doth accept of his children, becauſe their generall care is good, and the vniuerſall Tenor

of their life tendeth vnto righteouſueſſe, howſoeuer they may greatly faile in many particular actions. Two or thrée fits of an Ague, do not prooue a diſeaſed body: nor two or thrée good daies a ſound body: euen ſo ſome few infirmities doe not argue a wicked man; nor two or thrée good actions, a good man: but we muſt haue an eye to the certaine and ſettled courſe of a mans life. Euen as men are truely ſaid to walke in a way, when they goe in it, although ſometimes they trip and ſtumble: ſo Gods children doe walke in the way of righteouſnes, although ſometimes they ſtumble, and ſtep out of it; or ſometimes be violently haled out of it by theeues. For Sathan and the violence of our luſts, doe often hale vs out of the way, but we muſt get into it againe as ſoone as we are eſcaped. Now then to conclude & draw to an end, ſith God is ſo infinitely mercifull, and conſtant in his mercy: ſith ſuch great and precious promiſes are made to vs in Chriſt: ſith the Lord doth not regard our infirmities when our harts are with him: Therefore O Aſunetus, be of good chéere, let nothing trouble you, feare not the aſſaults of the Diuell, regard not his temptations: for aſſuredly your ſinnes are forgiuen. Chriſt is yours, heauen is yours, and all the promiſes of life and ſaluation belong vnto you: ſo as you néed not to doubt, you cannot

miſcarry, your name is written in the booke of life.
            
            
               Aſune.
               I am greatly comforted and cheared vp with your words: your preaching of the Goſpell, and laying open of Gods abundant mercy in Chriſt, and of the promiſes, do exceedingly reuiue me, and euen as it were put new life into me: they are as Sacke and Sugar vnto my ſoule, and more ſweete then the hony, and the hony combe: they are as Phyſicke to my ſicke ſoule, and as oyntment to my ſpirituall wounds. I doe now beginne to ſee what miſery is in man, and what mercy is in God. And I know by wofull experience, that where miſery is not felt, there mercy is not regarded: but now it hath pleaſed God to giue me ſome feeling of mine owne wretchedneſſe and miſery, and yet with good comfort in his mercy. For I thanke God for it, I begin now to grow to ſome perſwaſion, that the promiſes doe belong vnto me, my ſins are forgiuen, and that I am one of them that ſhall be ſaued.
            
            
               Theol.
               I doe greatly reioyce, that God hath according to his rich mercy, wrought this good worke in you. I doe from the bottome of my heart giue him the praiſe and glory of it. Happy are you, that euer you were borne, in whom God hath wrought ſo gratious a work. It is of his high fauour and ſpeciall mercy towards

you, for it is the only priuiledge and prerogatiue royall of Gods owne children, truely to repent and beléeue. I beſeech God therefore to increaſe your faith, and to fill you full of ioy and peace in beléeuing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the holy Ghoſt.

               Sir, I will now take my leaue of you. I can neuer be thankefull enough for all the good inſtructions and comforts which I haue heard from you this day; I hope I ſhall remember ſome of them whileſt I liue: I doe therfore praiſe God for you, and for your counſell, and for this day, which I hope ſhall be the firſt day of my repentance, and true conuerſion vnto God.

               The Lord for his infinite mercies ſake grant it. And I moſt humbly beſéech the Almighty God to eſtabliſh you with his frée ſpirit, that you may procéed and goe forward in a Chriſtian courſe vnto the end.

               I pray you good M. Theologus pardon

my boldneſſe: for you ſee I haue beene very bold to propound many queſtions vnto you, wherein you haue fully ſatisfied me, to the great ioy and comfort of my ſoule. I doe therefore praiſe God for you, and I hope I ſhall neuer forget ſome things which you haue vttered. But I will now commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build further.
            
            
               Theol.
               Farewell good Philagathus. The Lord bleſſe you, and kéepe you in all your waies: and the God of Heauen preſerue vs all, and continue vs in his feare vnto the end.

               Preaching, a matter of abſolute neceſſitie vnto eternal life. 337
               Without preaching, the people are in great danger of loſing their ſoules. 336

               The torments of hell, with the extremitie, perpetuitie, and remedileſneſſe thereof deſcribed. 361
               The ignorant man, vpon the hearing of the day of iudgment, and hell fire laide open, is pricked in his conſcience, bewaileth his former life, repenteth earneſtly for his ſinne and ignorance, and deſireth ſpirituall Phyſicke and comfort of the Preacher. 374
               
                  The Preacher miniſtreth vnto him much ſpiritual comfort, and doth in ample manner laie open vnto him all the ſweete promiſes of the Goſpell, and the infinite mercy of God in Chriſt, to all true, penitent, and broken hearted ſinners. 375
               The ignorant man, being afflicted in his conſcience, is exceedingly comforted with the hearing of Gods abundant mercy preached vnto him, and thereupon doth gather great inward peace, conuerteth vnto God with all his heart, and doth exceedingly bleſſe God for the Preachers counſell. 391

            A Morning prayer, to be vſed in priuate families.
            
            
               O Lord our God, and heauenlie Father, we thy vnwoorthy children doe heere come into thy moſt holy and heauenly preſence to giue thee praiſe and glory, for all thy great mercies and manifold bleſſings towards vs: eſpecially for that thou haſt preſerued vs this night paſt from all the dangers and feares thereof, haſt giuen vs quiet reſt to our bodies, and brought vs now ſafely to the beginning of this day, & doſt now afreſh renew all thy mercies vpon vs, as the Eagle reneweth her bill, giuing vs all things abundantly to enioy; as foode, raiment, health, peace, libertie, and freedome from many miſeries, diſeaſes, caſualties, and calamities which we are ſubiect vnto in this life, euery minute of an houre: and not onely ſo, but alſo for vouchſafeing vnto vs many good things, not onely for neceſſitie,

but euen for delight alſo. But aboue all (deare Father) we praiſe thy name for the bleſſings of a better life, ſpecially for thy moſt holy word and ſacraments, and all the good we enioy thereby; for the continuance of the Goſpel amongſt vs; for the death of thy ſonne, & al that happineſſe which we haue thereby; alſo becauſe thou haſt choſen vs to life before we were, and that of thy meere goodnes, & vndeſerued fauor towards vs, & haſt called vs in thine appointed time, iuſtified vs by thy grace, ſanctified vs by thy ſpirit, & adopted vs to be thine own childrē, & heirs apparant to the great crown. O Lord open our eies euery day more & more, to ſee and conſider of thy great & marueilous loue to vs in all theſe things; that by the due conſideration therof, our harts may be drawne yet neerer vnto thee, euen more to loue thee, feare thee, & obey thee: that as thou art enlarged towards vs in mercy, ſo we may be enlarged towards thee in thankſgiuing: & as thou doeſt abound towards vs in goodnes, ſo we may aboūd towards thee in obedience & loue. And ſith (deere father) thou art neuer weary of doing vs good, notwithſtanding all our vnworthines & naughtines: therefore let the conſideration of thy great mercy, & fatherly kindneſſe towards vs euen as it were force our hearts, and compell vs to come into thy moſt glorious preſence with new ſongs of

thankeſgiuing in our mouths. We pray thee (O moſt mercifull God) to forgiue vs all our vnthankfulnes, vnkindnes, prophannes, & great abuſing of all thy mercies, & ſpecially our abuſe & contempt of thy Goſpel, together with al other the ſins of our life, which we confeſſe are innumerable & mo then can be reckoned vp, both in omiſſion of good things & commiſſion of euill. We moſt humbly intreat thee to ſet thē all ouer to the reckning which thy ſon Chriſt hath made vp for them vpō his croſſe, & neuer to lay any of them to our charge, but freely forget all, & forgiue all; Naile downe all our ſins & iniquities to the Croſſe of Chriſt, bury them in his death, bathe them in his blood, hide them in his wounds, let them neuer riſe vp in iudgement againſt vs. Set vs free of the miſeries that are vpō vs for ſin, & keep back the iudgements to come, both of ſoule, body, goods, and good name. Be reconciled vnto vs in thy deere ſon, concerning all matters past, not once remembring or repeating vnto vs our old & abhominable iniquities: but accept vs as righteous in him, imputing his righteoſnes to vs, & our ſins to him. Let his righteouſnes ſatiſfie thy iuſtice for all our vnrighteouſnes, his obedience for our diſobedience, his perfection for our imperfection. Moreouer we humbly beſeech thy good maieſty to giue vs the true ſight & feling of our manifold ſins, that we

may not be blinded in them through delight, or hardned in them through cuſtom, as the reprobates are: but that we may be euen weary of them, & much grieued for them, labouring and ſtriuing by al poſſible means to get out of them. Good Father touch our harts with true repentance for all ſin. Let vs not take any delight or pleaſure in any ſin: but howſoeuer we fal throgh frailty (as we fall often) yet let vs neuer fall finally, let vs neuer lie downe in ſin, nor continue in ſin; but let vs get vpon our feete againe, & turne to thee with all our hearts, & ſeeke thee whileſt thou maieſt be found, & whileſt thou doeſt offer grace and mercy vnto vs. O Lord encreaſe in vs that true and liuely faith whereby we may lay ſure hold on thy ſonne Chriſt, & reſt vpon his merits altogether. Giue vs faith aſſuredly to belieue all the great and precious promiſes made in the Goſpell, and ſtrengthen vs from aboue to walke and abound in all the true & ſound fruits of faith. Let vs walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit. Let vs feele the power of thy ſons death killing ſinne in our mortall bodies, and the power of his reſurrection, raiſing vs vp to newneſſe of life. Let vs grow daily in the ſanctification of the ſpirit, and the mortification of the fleſh. Let vs liue holily, iuſtly, and ſoberly in this preſent euill world, ſhewing foorth the vertues of thee in all our particular actions; that

we may adorne our moſt holy profeſſion, and ſhine as lights in the middeſt of a crooked and froward generation amongſt whom we liue, being gaineful to all by our liues & conuerſations, & offenſiue to none. To this end we pray thee fill vs with thy ſpirit and all ſpirituall graces; as loue, wiſedome, patience, contentment, meekeneſſe, humility, temperancy, chaſtity, kindneſſe, and affability: and ſtirre vs vp to vſe praier and watchfulneſſe, reading & meditation in thy law, and all other good meanes whereby wee may grow and abound in all heauenly vertues. Bleſſe vs in the vſe of the meanes, from day to day; make vs ſuch as thou wouldeſt haue vs to be, and ſuch as we deſire to be, working in vs both will and deede, purpoſe and power. For thou, O Lord, art all in all, thou wilt haue mercy vpon whom thou wilt haue mercy, and whom thou wilt thou hardeneſt. Haue mercy vpon vs therefore (deere Father) and neuer leaue vs to our ſelues, nor to our owne wils, luſts, and deſires, but aſſiſt vs with thy good ſpirit, that we may continue to the end in a righteous courſe; that ſo at length we may be receiued into glorie, and be partakers of that immortall crowne which thou haſt laid vp for all that loue thee, and truely call vpon thee.
            Further, we entreat thee, O heauenly father, to giue vs all things neceſſary for this life: as

foode, raiment, health, peace, liberty, and ſuch freedome from thoſe manifold miſeries which we lie open vnto euery day, as thou ſeeſt meete. Bleſſe vnto vs all the meanes which thou haſt put into our hands for the ſuſtenance of this fraile life. Bleſſe our ſtocke, and ſtore, corne, and cattell, trades & occupations, and all the works of our hands: for thy bleſſing only maketh rich, and it bringeth no ſorrows with it. Giue vs therfore ſuch a competency and ſufficiency of theſe outward bleſſings, as thou in thy heauenly wiſdome ſeeſt moſt needfull for vs. Moreouer, we humbly beſeech thee, (moſt louing Father) in great mercy to looke downe from heauen vpon thy whole Church, and euery member of it. Be fauourable vnto Sion, and build vp the wals of Ieruſalem. Behold with the eye of pity, the great ruines and deſolations of thy Church. Heale vp the wounds, & make vp the breaches thereof in all Nations. Regard it as thine owne flocke, tender it as thine owne family, dreſſe it as thine owne vineyard, loue it as thine owne ſpouſe. Think thoughts of peace to it, & alwaies look vpon it in deepe compaſſion. Bleſſe it with thy grace, guide it with thy ſpirit, & defend it alwaies with thy mighty power: ſcatter the deuiſes confound the counſels, & ouerthrow the forces of all that fight againſt it. Specially we intreate thee (deare Father) to ſet thy ſelf againſt that antichriſt

of Rome, that man of perdition, which ſetteth himſelfe againſt thee, and againſt all thy people. In thine appointed time we pray thee giue him a deadly downe-fall. Beat downe all his power and authority daily more and more: giue free paſſage to thy Goſpell in al kingdoms, that Babylon may fall and neuer riſe vp againe. The more the fauorites and adherents of Rome labour to vphold their Idolatrous kingdome, the more let it fall downe, euen as Dagon before the preſence of thine Arke. Poure downe the vials of the fulneſſe of thy wrath vpon the kingdome of the beaſt, and let their riches, wealth, credite, and authority dry vp euery day more and more, as the riuer Euphrates. Let it pity thee, O Father, to ſee thine owne ſpouſe ſit as a deformed and forlorne woman heere below, weeping and mourning with her haire about her necke, hauing loſt all her beauty and comlineſſe: cheere her vp (deare Father) glad her with the ioie of thy countenance, and ſo decke her and trimme her vp, that thou maieſt delight in her, as a Bridegroome in his Bride. Specially we intreat thee to haue mercy vpon thy Church in this land: intend good vnto vs and not euill: giue vs not ouer into the hands of the cruell Spaniard, as our ſinnes haue deſerued. Scatter we pray thee, O Lord, the deuiſes, and breake the plots of all ſuch as haue plotted

the ouerthrow & vtter ſubuerſion of this church and common-wealth. Bleſſe this Church more and more, with the continuance of true Religion amongſt vs. For thy great names ſake, and infinite mercies ſake, deale gratiouſly and fauourablie with vs, & our poſteritie. Turne from vs that vengeance which is due to vs for our ſins. For thou ſeeſt how iniquitie preuaileth and the wicked goe away with the goale. Atheiſme ouerſpreadeth euery where, and Popery ſeemeth to get a head againe. Now therfore (deare Father) we moſt humbly beſeech thee to take order ſpeedily for the remedying & repreſſing of theſe manifold diſorders, and grieuous enormities that are amongſt vs. Be intreated of thy poore children to be good to this Engliſh Nation. Heare the cries of thine elect: heare the mourning of them that mourne in Sion. Let the cries of thy children cry downe all the cries of the ſins of the land, and be reconciled vnto vs in the multitude of thy compaſſions: that ſo thou maieſt ſtill continue a moſt mercifull protector of this thine Engliſh vineyard. Wee pray thee (good Father) ſhew ſpeciall mercy to our moſt Noble and gratious King Iames thine annointed ſeruant: bleſſe him, and keepe him in all his waies. Bleſſe his gouernment vnto vs. Let thine Angels encampe about him, and let thy holy hand be alwaies ouer him, keepe him from treaſons,

and deliuer him from the treacheries of his enemies: giue him to ſee what belongeth vnto his peace, and giue him a heart earneſtlybent to ſet vpon the practiſe of the ſame: giue him all graces neceſſary for his peace, and neceſſary for his ſaluation: continue his gouernment peaceable and proſperous amongſt vs: & as thon haſt made him the breath of our noſtrils, and a gratious inſtrument for the ſauing of many thouſand ſoules, ſo let his owne ſoule be ſaued in the day of thy Son Chriſt. Bleſſe his Maieſties moſt honorable priuy Counſellors, & giue ſuch good ſucceſſe vnto all their Counſels and policies in matters of ſtate, that we may leade a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe & honeſty. Bleſſe all the Nobility, worke in them a care to glorifie thy name in their places, make them faithfull to thee, and faithfull to the Land. Direct with thy good ſpirit all ſuch as beare the ſword of Iuſtice, that they may draw it out to puniſh the wicked, and to defend the godly, and that they may with all good care and conſcience diſcharge the duties of their places. Increaſe the number of faithfull and zealous Miniſters, in this church. Send thy Goſpel to thoſe places where it is not, and bleſſe it where it is. Remember them in thy mercy O Lord, that are vnder any croſſe or affliction whatſoeuer: be comfortable vnto them, heale vp their wounds, binde vp their ſores, put all their teares into thy bottle, and make their

bedde in all their ſorrowes, and put ſuch a good ende to all their troubles, that they may redounde to thy glory, and the furtherance of their owne ſaluation. In the meane time giue them patience and conſtancy to beare whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe thy mercifull hand to lay vpon them. Laſt of all, in a word, we pray thee bleſſe magiſtracy, miniſtery, and commonalty. Bleſſe all thy people; doe good to all that are true and vpright in their hearts. And ſo (deare Father) we doe commit and commend our ſelues, our ſoules and bodies into thy hands, for this day, and the reſt of our life, praying thee to take care and charge of vs; keepe vs from all euill, watch ouer vs for our good, let thine Angels encampe about vs, let thy holy hand be ouer vs, & keepe vs in all our waies, that we may liue to thy praiſe and glory heere in earth, keeping faith and a good conſcience in all our actions; that after this life we may be crowned of thee, for euer in thy kingdome. Grant theſe things (good father) to vs here preſent, & to all thine abſent; praying thee in ſpeciall fauor to remember our friends, & kinsfolks in the fleſh, all our good neighbours & welwillers, & all thoſe forwhom we are bound to pray by nature, by deſerts, or any duty whatſoeuer, for Ieſus Chriſts ſake our onely mediator; to whom with thee, and the holy Ghoſt, be giuen all praiſe and glory, both now, and for euermore.
            Amen.
         
         
            
            An Euening Praier, to be vſed in priuate families.
            
            
               OEternall God, and our moſt louing and deare Father, wethy vnwoorthy children doe héere fall downe at the foote of thy great Maieſty, acknowledging from our harts, that we are altogether vnworthy to come néere thée or to look towards thée: becauſe thou art a God of infinite glory, and we are moſt vile, and abhominable ſinners, ſuch as were conceiued, & borne in ſinne and corruption, ſuch as haue inherited our fathers corruptions, and alſo haue actually tranſgreſſed all thy holy ſtatutes and lawes, both in thought, words, & déeds, before weknew thée: and ſince, ſecretly and openly, with our ſelues & with others, our particular ſinnes are moe then can be numbred: for who knoweth how often he offendeth? But this we muſt needs confeſſe againſt our ſelues, that our hearts are full of pride, couetouſneſſe, and the loue of this world,

full ofwrath anger, and impatiencie, full of lying, diſſembling, and deceiuing, full of vanity, hardneſſe, and prophaneneſſe, full of infidelity, diſtruſt, and ſelfe-loue, full of luſt, vncleannes, and all adhominable deſires: yea our harts are the very ſinkes of ſinne, and dunghils of all filthineſſe. And beſides all this, we doe omit the good things we ſhould doe: for there are in vs great wants of faith, of loue, of zeale, of patience, of contentment, and of euery good grace; ſo as thou haſt iuſt cauſe to procéed to ſentence of iudgement againſt vs, as moſt damnable tranſgreſſors of all thy holy commandements: yea ſuch as are ſunke in our rebellions, and haue many times & often committed high treaſon againſt thy maieſty, & therefore thou maiſt iuſtly caſt vs all downe into hell fire, there to be tormented with Sathan, and his Angels for euer. And we haue nothing to except againſt thy maieſty for ſo doing: ſith therein thou ſhouldeſt deale with vs but according to equity, and our iuſt deſerts. Wherfore déere Father, we do appeale from thy iuſtice to thy mercy, moſt humbly intreating thée to haue mercy vpon vs, and freely to forgiue vs all our ſinnes paſt whatſoeuer, both new, and old, ſecret and open, knowen and unknowen, and thatfor Jeſus Chriſts ſake our only mediator. And we pray thée touch our hearts with true griefe, & vnfained repentance

for them, that they may be a matter of continuall ſorrow, & hart-ſmart vnto vs, ſo as nothing may grieue vs more then this, that wée haue offended thée béeing our ſpeciall friend and Father. Giue vs therefore (deare Father) euery day more and more ſight & féeling of our ſinnes, with true humiliation vnder the ſame. Giue vs alſo that true and liuely faith, whereby we may lay ſure hold on thy Sonne Chriſt, and all his merits, applying the ſame to our owne ſoules; ſo as we may ſtand fully perſwaded that whatſoeuer he hath don vpon the croſſe, he hath done for vs particularly, as well as for others. Giue vs faith (good Father) conſtantly to beléeue all the ſwéete promiſes of the Goſpell, touching remiſſion of ſin, and eternall life, made in thy ſon Chriſt. O Lord increaſe our faith that we may altogether reſt vpon thy promiſes which are all yea, and Amen. Yea, that we may ſettle our ſelues, and all that we haue wholly vpon them: both our ſouls, bodies, goods, name, wiues, children, and our whole eſtate, knowing that all things depend vpon thy promiſes, power, and prouidence, & that thy word doth ſupport and beare vp the whole order of nature. Moreouer, we intreate thée, O Lord, to ſtrengthen vs from aboue, to walke in euery good way, & to bring foorth the fruits of true faith in all our particular actions, ſtudying to pleaſe thée in all things

and to be fruitfull in good works, that we may ſhew forth vnto all men by our good conuerſation whoſe children we are: and that we may adorne and beautifie our moſt holy profeſſion by walking in a Chriſtian courſe, and in all the ſound fruits, & practiſe of godlineſſe, and true religion. To this end we pray thée ſanctifie our hearts by thy ſpirit, yet more and more: ſanctifie our ſoules and bodies, and all our corrupt naturall faculties, as reaſon, vnderſtanding, will, and affections, ſo as they may be fitted for thy worſhip and ſeruice, taking a delight and pleaſure therein. Stirre vs vp to vſe praier, watchfulneſſe, reading, and meditation in thy law, & all other good meanes whereby we may profit in grace & goodnes from day to day. Bleſſe vs in the vſe of the meanes, that we may daily die to ſin, and liue to righteouſnes: draw vs yet néerer vnto thée: helpe vs againſt our manifold wants. Amend our great imperfections, renue vs inwardly more and more, repaire the ruines of our hearts, aide vs againſt the remnants of ſinne. Enlarge our harts to run the way of thy Commandements, direct all our ſteps in thy word, let none iniquity haue dominion ouer vs. Aſſiſt vs againſt our ſpeciall infirmities, & maſter ſins, that we may get the victory ouer them all, to thy glory, and the great peace & comfort of our owne conſciences. Strengthen vs good father

by thy grace and holy ſpirit, againſt the common corruptions of the world, as pride, whoredome, couetouſnes, contempt of thy Goſpel, ſwearing, lying, diſſembling, and deceiuing. O déere father, let vs not be ouercome of theſe filthy vices: nor any other ſinfull pleaſures, and fond delights, wherewith thouſands are carried headlong to deſtruction. Arm our ſoules againſt all the temptations of this world, the fleſh, & the diuell: that we may ouercome them all through thy helpe, & kéepe on the right way to life, that we may liue in thy feare, & die in thy fauor, that our laſt daies may be our beſt daies, & that we may end in great peace of conſcience. Furthermore, déere father, we intreat thée not onely for our ſelues, but for all our good brethren thy déere childrē ſcattred ouer the face of the whole earth, moſt humbly beſéeching thée to bleſſe them all▪ to chéere them vp, & glad them with the ioy of thy countenance, both now and alwaies. Guide them all in thy feare, and kéepe them from euill, that they may praiſe thy name. In theſe dangerous daies, and declining times, we pray thée, O Lord, raiſe vp nurſing fathers, and nurſing mothers vnto thy Church. Raiſe vp alſo faithfull Paſtors, that thy cauſe may be caried forward, truth may preuaile, Religion may proſper, thy name onely may be ſet vp in the earth, thy Sonnes kingdome aduanced, and thy

will accompliſhed. Set thy ſelfe againſt all aduerſary power, eſpecially that of Rome, Antichriſt, Idolatry, and Atheiſme: curſe and croſſe all their counſels, fruſtrate their deuiſes, ſcatter their forces, ouerthrow their armies. When they are moſt wiſe, let them be moſt fooliſh: when they are moſt ſtrong, let them be moſt weake. Let them know that there is no wiſedome, nor counſell, power nor policy againſt thée the Lord of hoſtes. Let them know that Iſrael hath a God, and that thou which art called Iehouah art the onely ruler ouer all the world. Ariſe therefore O moſt mighty God, and maintaine thine owne cauſe againſt all thine enemies, ſmite through all their loines, and bow downe their backs, yea let them all be confounded, and turned backward that beare ill will vnto Sion. Let the patient abiding of the righteous be ioy: and let the wicked be diſappointed of their hope. But of all fauour, we intreat thée O Lord to ſhew ſpeciall mercy to thy Church in this Land wherein we liue. Continue thy Goſpell amongſt vs yet with greater ſucceſſe, purge thy houſe daily more and more, take away all things that offend. Let this Nation ſtill be a place where thy name may be called vpon; & an harbour for thy ſaints. Shew mercy to our poſterity, deare Father, and haue 
                  •
               are of them, that thy Goſpell may be left vnto

them as a moſt holy inheritance. Defend vs againſt forraine inuaſion, kéepe out idolatry, and Popery from amongſt vs. Turne from vs thoſe plagues which our ſinnes crie for. For the ſins of this Land are excéeding great, horrible, and outragious, and giue thée iuſt cauſe to make vs ſpectacles of thy vengeance to all Nations: that by how much the more thou haſt lifted vs vp in great mercy, & long peace, by ſo much the more thou ſhouldeſt preſſe vs downe in great wrath and long war. Therefore deare father, we moſt humbly intreate thée for thy great names ſake, & for thy infinite mercies ſake, that thou wouldeſt be reconciled to this land, and diſcharge it of all the horrible ſinnes thereof. Drowne them O Lord in thy infinite mercy through Chriſt, as it were in a bottomleſſe gulfe, that they may neuer riſe vp in iudgement againſt vs. For although our ſins be excéeding many, and fearefull, yet thy mercy is farre greater. For thou art infinite in mercy: but we cannot be infinite in ſinning. Giue vs not ouer into the hands of the Idolaters, left they ſhould blaſpheme thy name and ſay, Where is their God in whom they truſted? But rather, deare Father, take vs into thine owne hands, and correct vs according to thy wiſedome: for with thée is mercy, and déepe compaſſion. Moreouer we moſt hartily beſéech thy good Maieſty to bleſſe our moſt

gratious King Iames, and to ſhew much mercy to him in all things. Guid him in thy feare, and kéepe him in all his waies, working in his ſoule vnfained ſorrow for ſinue, true faith in the promiſes, & a great care to pleaſe thée in all things, and to diſcharge the duties of his high place, in all zeale of thy glory, and faithfulneſſe towards thy Maieſty: that as thou haſt crowned him héere in earth, ſo hée (ſpending his daies héere below in thy feare) may after this life, be crowned of thée for euer in the Heauens. Wée béeſeech thee alſo to bleſſe his Maieſties moſt henorable priuy Counſellors. Counſell them from aboue, let them take aduiſe of thée in all things: that they may both conſult, and reſolue of ſuch courſes as may be moſt for thy glory, the good of the Church, and the peace of this our Common-wealth. Bleſſe the Nobility, and all the Magiſtrates in the Land, giuing them al grace to execute iudgement and iuſtice, and to maintaine truth and equity. Bleſſe all the faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpell, increaſe the number of them, increaſe thy gifts in them: and ſo bleſſe al their labours in their ſeueral places and congregations, that they all may be inſtruments of thy hand to inlarge thy Sonnes kingdome, and to winne many vnto thee. Comfort the comfortleſſe with all néedfull comforts. Forget none of thine that are in trouble: but as their

afflions are, ſo let the ioyes and comforts of thy ſpirit be vnto them; and ſo ſanctifie vnto all thine, their afflictions and troubles, that they may tend to thy glory, and their owne good. Giue vs thankefull hearts for all thy mercies, both ſpirituall and corporall: for thou art very mercifull vnto vs in the things of this life, and infinitely more mercifull in the things of a better life. Let vs déepely ponder and weigh all thy particular fauours towards vs: that by the due conſideration thereof, our hearts may bée gained yet néerer vnto thée, and that therefore wée may both loue and obey thée, becauſe thou art ſo kinde and louing vnto vs: that euen thy loue towards vs, may draw our loue towards thée, and that becauſe mercy is with thée, thou maieſt bée feared. Grant theſe things good Father, and all other néedefull graces for our ſoules or bodies, or any of thine throughout the whole world, for Jeſus Chriſts ſake. In whoſe name we further call vpon thée as hée hath taught vs in his Goſpell, ſaying; Our Father which art in Heauen, &c.
            
         
         
            
            A praier to be vſed at any time, by one alone priuately.
            
            O Lord my God, and heauenly Father, I thy moſt vnworthy childe, doe héere in thy ſight fréely confeſſe that I am a moſt ſinnefull creature, and damnable tranſgreſſor of all thy holy Lawes and Commandements: that as I was borne and bred in finne, and ſtained in the wombe, ſo haue I continually brought foorth the corrupt & vgly fruits of that infection & contagion, wherein I was firſt conceiued, both in thoughts, words, & works. If I ſhould goe about to reckon vp my particular offences, I know not where to begin, or where to make an end. For they are mo then the haires of my head, yea farre moe then I can poſſibly féele or know. For who knoweth the height, and depth of his corruption: who knoweth how oft he offendeth? Thou onely O Lord knoweſt my ſins, who knoweſt my heart: nothing is hid from thée, thou knoweſt what I haue béene, & what I am: yea my conſcience doth accuſe mée of many & gréeuous euils, and I doe daily féele by woful experience how frail I am, how prone to euill, & how vntoward to all goodneſſe. My minde is ful of vanity, my hartfull of prophanenes, mine affections full of deadneſſe, dulneſſe & drowzineſſe in matters of thy worſhip & ſeruice. Yea, my whole ſoule is full of ſpirituall blindeneſſe,

hardneſſe, vnprofitablenes, coldneſſe, and ſecurity. And in very déed I am altogether a lumpe of ſin, & a maſſe of all miſery: & therefore I haue forfaited thy fauour, & incurred thy high diſpleaſure, & haue giuen thée iuſt cauſe to frown vpon me, to giue me ouer, & leaue me to mine owne corrupt will and affections. But (O my déere father) I haue learned from thy mouth, that thou art a God full of mercy, flow to wrath & of great compaſſion & kindneſſe, towards all ſuch as grone vnder the burden of their ſinnes. Therefore extend thy great mercy towards me poore ſinner, and giue me a generall pardon for all mine offences whatſoeuer: ſeale it in the bloud of thy ſonne, and ſeale it to my conſcience by thy ſpirit, aſſuring me more and more of thy loue & fauour towards me, & that thou art a reconciled father vnto me. Grant that I may, in all time to come loue thée much, becauſe much is giuen, and of very loue feare thée, and obey thée. O Lord increaſe my faith, that I may ſtedfaſtly beléeue all the promiſes of the Goſpel made in thy ſon Chriſt & reſt vpon them altogether. Enable me to bring foorth the ſound fruits of faith and repentance in all my particular actions. Fill my ſoule full of ioy and peace in beléeuing. Fill me full of inward comfort and ſpirituall ſtrength againſt all temptatious: giue me yet a greater féeling of thy loue & manifold

mercies towards me, worke in my ſoule a loue of thy Maieſty, a zeale of thy glory, an hatred of euill, and a deſire of all good things. Giue me victory ouer thoſe ſins which thou knoweſt are ſtrongeſt in me. Let me once at laſt make a conqueſt of the world, and the fleſh. Mortifie in me whatſoeuer is carnall, ſanctifie me throughout by thy ſpirit, knit my heart to thée for euer that I may feare thy name, renue in mée the image of thy ſonne Chriſt daily more and more. Giue me a delight in the reading and meditation of thy word. Let me reioyce in the publike miniſtery thereof. Let me loue and reuerence all the faithfull Miniſters of thy Goſpell. Sanctifie their doctrines to my conſcience, ſeale them in my ſoule, write them in my hart; giue me a ſoft and melting heart, that I may tremble at thy words, and be alwaies much affected with godly ſermons. Let not my ſinnes hold backe thy mercies from me, nor mine vnworthines ſtop the paſſage of thy grace. Open mine eies to ſée the great wonders of thy law. Reueale thy ſecrets vnto me: be open hearted towards me thy vnworthy ſeruant. Hide nothing from me that may make for thy glory, & the good of my ſoule. Bleſſe all meanes vnto me which thou vſeſt for my good. Bleſſe all holy inſtructions vnto my ſoule. Bleſſe me at all times, both in hearing & reading thy word. Giue me the right vſe of all

thy mercies, and corrections, that I may be the better for them. Let me abound in loue to thy children. Let my heart be very néerely knit vnto them, that where thou loueſt moſt, there I may loue moſt alſo. Let me watch & pray, that I enter not into temptation: giue me patience & contentment in all things. Let me loue thée more & more, & the world leſſe & leſſe. So draw my minde vpward, that I may deſpiſe al tranſitory things. Let me be ſo rapt & rauiſhed with the ſight and féeling of heauenly things, that I may make a baſe rekoning of al earthly things. Let me vſe this world, as though I vſed it not. Let me vſe it but for neceſſity, as meat & drink. Let me not be carried away with the vaine pleaſures and fond delights thereof. Good Father worke thy good worke in me, & neuer leaue me, nor forſake me, till thou haſt brought me to true happineſſe. Oh deare Father, make me faithfull in my calling, that I may ſerue thée in it, & be alwaies carefull to doe what good I may in any thing. Bleſſe me in my outward eſtate. Bleſſe my ſoule, body, goods, and name. Bleſſe all that belongeth vnto me. Bleſſe my goings out, & commings in. Let thy countenance be lifted vp vpon me, now & alwaies: cheare me vp with the ioies & comforts of thy ſpirit: make me thankfull for all thy mercies. For I muſt néeds confeſſe that thou art very kind vnto me in all

things. For in thée I liue mooue & haue my being: of thée I haue my welfare & good being, thou art a daily friend, & ſpeciall good benefactor vnto me. I liue at thy coſt & charges. I hold all of thée in chiefe, and I finde that thou art neuer weary of doing me good: thy goodnes towards me is vnſtanchable. Oh I can neuer be thankefull enough vnto thée for all thy mercies, both ſpirituall & corporall. But in ſuch meaſure as I am able, I praiſe thy name for all, beſéeching thee to accept of my thankeſgiuing, in thy ſon Chriſt, and to giue me a profitable vſe of al thy fauors, that thereby my heart may be fully drawne vnto thée: giue me O Father to be of ſuch a good nature, and diſpoſition, that I may be wonne by gentleneſſe & faire meanes, as much as if thou gaueſt me many laſhes. Pardon all mine vnthankfulneſſe, vnkindneſſe, and great abuſing of thy mercies, and giue me grace to vſe them more to thy glory in all time to come. Strengthen me deare Father thus to continue praiſing & glorifying thy name héere vpon earth: that after this life I may be crowned of thée for euer in thy kingdome. Grant theſe petitions moſt mercifull God, not onely to me, but to all thy déere children throughout the whole world, for Jeſus Chriſt ſake: in whoſe name I doe further call vpon thée, ſaying as he hath taught me: O our Father which art in Heauen, &c.
