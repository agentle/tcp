                  HAppy and bleſſed is that perſon whome trouthe teacheth / & enformeth nat by fygures / or by deceytfull voyces but as the trouthe is / our oppinyō and our wytte many tymes deceyueth vs / For we ſe nat the trouthe / what auayleth vs the knowlege of ſuche thīgꝭ as ſhall neyther helpe vs at the day of Iugement yf we knowe thē nor hurte vs if we knowe them nat. It is therfore greate foly to be neglygent in ſuche thynges as be profytable and neceſſary to vs / 

and to labour for ſuche thynges that be but curyous and dampnable. Truely yf we do ſo we haue eyen but we ſe nat / and what auayleth vs the knowledge of the kynde and werkynge of creatures truely nothynge / he to whome the euerlaſtynge worde that is Ieſus ſpeketh: is dyſcharged of many vayne opynyōs / and of that worde all thynges procede and all thynges openly ſhewe / crye and belyue that he is god. No man without hym vnderſtandeth the trouthe ne ryghtfully iugeth / but he to whom all thynges is one and he that all thynges draweth ī to one and all thynges ſetteth in one / and deſyreth nothynge / but one may anone be ſtablyd ī herte and be fully pacifyed in god. O trouthe that God arte / make me one with the in perfyte charyte / for al that I rede / heare / or ſee / without the is a greuous thyng to me for in the is all that I wyll or may deſyre / Let all Doctours be ſtyll in thy preſence: and let all creatures kepe thē in ſilēce & thou onely lorde ſpeke to my ſoule. The more that man is onede to the / & the more that he is gathered togither ī the / the more he vndſtādeth with out labour hygh ſecrete myſteries / for he

hathe reſceyued from aboue the lyght of vnderſtandynge. A clene / pure and a ſtable herte is nat broken ne lyghtely ouercome with ghoſtly laboures / for he doth all thynge to the honoure of god / & for he is clerely mortified to hym ſelfe / therfore he coueyteth to be fre fro folowynge his owne wyl. What hyndreth the more than thy affeccions nat fully mortyſied to the wyll of the ſpirite / truely nothyng more. A good deuoute man ſo ordreth his outwarde beſynes that it drawe nat hym to the loue of it / but that he compell it to be obedient to the wyll of the ſpiryte and to the ryght iugement of reaſon. Who hath a ſtrenger batayle: thā he that laboureth for to ouercome hym ſelfe / and that ſhuld be our dayly labour & our dayly deſyre to ouercome our ſelfe / that we may be made ſtrengers in ſpirite / & increaſe dayly from better to better. Euery perfeccion in this lyfe hath ſome imperfeccion annexed vnto it / & there is no knowyng ī this worlde but that it is mixte with ſome blyndnes of ygnoraūce. And therfore a meke knowynge of our ſelfe is more ſyker waye to god / than is the ſerchyng for hyghnes of connynge. Connynge well ordred is nat

to be blamed for it is good and commeth of god / but a clene conſcyence and a vertuous lyfe is moche better & more is to be deſyred / bycauſe ſome men ſtudy to haue cōnynge rather than to lyue well. Therfore they arre many tymes & bryng forth lytel good fruit or none. O if they wold be as buſye to auoyde ſynne & to plante vertues in theyr ſoules / as they be to moue queſtions: there ſhulde nat be ſo many euyll thyngꝭ ſene in the world / ne ſo moch euyll example gyuen to the people / ne yet ſo moche dyſſolate lyuyng in religion. At the daye of Iugement it ſhall nat be aſked of vs what we haue red but what we haue done ne howe wel we haue ſayd but howe religiouſly we haue lyued. Tel me nowe where be all the great clerkes & famous doctours whome thou haſt well knowen. Whā they lyued they flouriſſhed greatly ī theyr lernyng / and nowe other men occupie theyr prebendes & ꝓmociōs and I can nat tell whether they thynke any thynge on them. In theyr lyfe they were holden great in the worlde / & nowe is lytell ſpekyng of them. O howe ſhortly paſſeth awaye the glory of this world with all the falſe deceyuable pleaſures of

it / wolde to God theyr lyfe had accorded wel with theyr lernynge / for than hadde they well ſtudyed and rede / howe many peryſhe dayly ī thys worlde by vayne cō

And bycauſe they deſyre rather to be great ī the worlde thā to be meke / therfore they vanyſſhe awaye in theyr lernynge as ſmoke in the heyre. Truely he is great / that hath greate charite: & he is great that is lytel ī his owne ſyght & that ſetteth at nought al worldly pleaſures as vyle dunge / ſo that he may wynne Chryſte. And that perſon is very wel taught that forſaketh his owne wyl and foloweth the wyll of god.

In thyne temptacyon it is good that thou ofte aſke counſayle / and that thou be nat rygorouſe to no perſon that is tēpted / but be glad to cōforte him as thou woldeſt be cōforted. The begynnynge of all euyll temptayons is in conſtaunce of mynde and to lytell a truſte in god. For as a ſhype without a guyde is driuē hether & theder with euery ſtorme So an vnſtable man that anone leuethe hys good purpoſe in god / is diuerſly tēpted / the fyre proueth golde / & temptacyon proueth the ryghtwyſe man / we knowe nat many tymes what we can ſuffre / but tēptacyon ſheweth playnly what we are and what vertue in vs. It is neceſſary in the begynnynge of euery tēptacyon to be well ware / for thā the enemye is ſone ouercome yf he be nat ſuffred to entre in to the herte. But that he be reſyſted / and ſhytte out as ſone as he ꝓfereth to entre for as a bodely medicyn is very late miniſtred whā the ſyckenes hathe ben ſuffred to encreaſe by longe contynuaunce / ſo it is of temptacyon.

And ſo by lytell and lytell the enemye hathe full entre for he was nat wyſely reſiſted in the begynnyng / & the more floweth that a man is in reſyſtynge the more weyke he is to reſyſte / and the enemye is dayly the more ſtronger agaynſte hym. Some perſons haue theyr greateſt temptacyons in the beginnynge of theyr conuerſyon / ſome in the ende: and ſomme in maner all theyr lyfe tyme be troubled therwith / and there be many that be but lyghtly tempted and al thys cometh of the great wyſdom & ryghtwyſnes of god whiche knoweth the ſtate and meryte of euery perſon: & ordeyneth al thyngis for the beſte / and to the euerlaſtynge helthe & ſaluacyon of his electe & choſen people.

ſoules vnder the ſtrong hāde of almighty god / for he wyll ſaue all theym and exalte all them that be here meke and lowe in ſpiryte. In temptacyons & tribulacyons a man is proued howe moche he hathe ꝓfyted / and his meryte is therby the great anenſte god / & his vertues are the more openly ſhewed. It is no greate maruayle if a man be feruent and deuoute whan he feleth no grefe▪ but if he can ſuffre paciētly in the tyme of temptacyons / or other aduerſyte / and therwith all can alſo ſtyre hym ſelfe to feruour of ſpiryte it is a tokē that he ſhall greatly profyte hereafter in vertue and grace.

                     gelles clene and pure ſhynnyge in al vertue / we oughte euery daye to renewe our purpoſe in god / and to ſtere our herte to feruoure and deuocion: as thoughe it were the fyrſte daye of our conuerſyon & dayly we ſhal praye and ſay thus. Helpe me my lorde Ieſu that I maye perſeuer in good purpoſe and in thy holy ſeruyce vnto my deth and that I may nowe this preſent daye perfitely beginne for it is no thynge that I haue done in tyme paſte. After our purpoſe & after our intent ſhall be our rewarde / & thoughe our intente be neuer ſo good yet it is neceſſarye that we put therto a good wyll and a greate deligence / for if he that ofte tymes purpoſeth to do well & to profyte in vertue yet fayleth in his doynge / what ſhall he do than that ſeldō or neuer taketh ſuche purpoſe.

Let vs entend to do the beſte we can / and yet our good purpoſe maye happen to be letted and hyndred in dyuers maners / & our ſpeciall hyndraūce is this / that we ſo lyghtly leue of oure good excercyſes that we haue vſed to doo before tyme / for it is ſeldome ſene that a good cuſtome wylfully broken may be recouered agayne with out great ſpiritual hyndraunce. The purpoſe of ryght wyſe men dependeth in the grace of god more than in them ſelfe or ī theyr owne wyſdome / for man purpoſeth but god diſpoſeth / ne the waye that man ſhall walke in this worlde is nat in hym ſelfe but in the grace of god. If a good cuſtome be ſomtime lefte of for helpe of our neyghboure / it maye ſone be recouered but if it be lefte of through ſlouthe or neglygēce of our ſelfe it wil hindre vs greatly and hardly wil it be recouered agayne Thus it appereth that though we incourage our ſelfe all that we can to do well / yet we ſhall lyghtly fayle in many thynges. And neuertheles thoughe we maye nat alway fulfyl it / yet it is good that we alwaye take ſuche good purpoſe eſpecially agaynſte ſuche thynges as hyndrethe vs moſte / we muſte alſo make dylygente

ſerche bothe within vs and without vs / that we leue nothynge inordynate vnreformed ī vs as nyghe as our fraylte may ſuffre / & yf thou can nat for fraylte of thy ſelfe do thus contynually / yet at the

In the mornīge thou ſhalte take a good purpoſe / for that daye folowynge: and at nyght thou ſhalte dyſcuſſe dylygently howe thou haſte behaued the the daye before in worde / in dede / and in thought / for in them we doo ofte offende god & our neyghboure.

Bodely exercyſes are to be done ſecretly / for that that is profytable to one is ſomtyme hurtfull to a nother / and alſo ſpirituall labours done of deuocion are more ſurely done in priuite than in open place. And thou muſte beware that thou be nat more redy to pryuate deuocions than

All maye nat vſe one maner of exercyſe but one in one maner / another in another maner as they ſhall fele to be moſte profitable to them. Alſo as the tyme requyrethe ſo dyuers exercyſes arr to be vſed / for one maner of exercyſes is neceſſary on the holy daye / another on the feriall daye / one in tyme of temptacyon another in tyme of peace & conſalacyon / one whan we haue ſwetnes in deuocion / another whan deuocyon withdrawethe.

And be brought ī to the euer laſtynge feaſte in heuen. And ſythe that bleſſe is yet deferred from vs for a tyme we maye well thynge that we be nat yet redy ne worthy to come therto. And therfore we ought to prepayre our ſelfe to be more redye another tyme / for as Saynte

Luke ſayethe. ♣ Bleſſed is that ſeruaunt whome oure Lorde (whā he ſhall come at the houre of dethe) ſhall fynde redy / for he ſhall take hym and lyfte hym vp hyghe aboue all erthly thynges in to the euerlaſtynge ioye and bleſſe in the kingdome of heuen.

It is alſo more lyght to be alway ſolytary at home / than to go forthe in to the worlde and nat offende. Therfore he that intendeth to come to an inwarde ſettynge of his herte in god and to haue the grace of deuocion / muſte with our ſauyour Chriſte withdraw him from the people.

But if ī the begynnyng thou be ofte therin and kepe it well in good praiers and in holy meditacyons it ſhall be here after to the a ſynguler frēde and one of thy moſte ſpecyall comfortes: in ſcylence and quietnes of herte a deuoute ſoule profyte the moche and lerneth the heed ſentences of ſcripture and fyndeth there: alſo many ſwete trees in deuocyon wherwith euery nyghte ſhe waſhed her nyghtely from al fylthe of ſynne that ſhe may be ſo muche the more familyer with god / as ſhe is dyſſerued from the clamours noyſe of worldly buſynes.

kepe the alwaye vnderſome holſome dyſcyplyne. Neuer gyue thy ſelfe to no vndyſcrete myrthe / for no maner of thynge as nyghe as thou mayſte. Haue perfyte compunccyon and ſorowe for thy ſynnes and thou ſhalt fynde therby great inly deuocyon Cōpuncciō openeth to the ſyght of the ſoule many good thynge / whiche lyghtnes of hert and vayne myrthe / ſome dryueth awaye. It is meruayle that any man can be mery in thys lyfe / yf he conſyder well howe farre he is exiled out of his countre: and howe great peryll hys ſoule dayly ſtandeth in / but through lyghtnes of herte / and neglygence of our defautes we fele nat: ne we wyl nat fele the ſorowe of oure owne ſoule / but ofte tymes we laughe whan we ought rather to wepe & morne: for there is no perfyte lyberty nor true ioye / but in the drede of god and in a good conſcyence. That perſon is ryght happy that hathe grace to auoyde from hym all thynges that letteth hym fro beholdynge of hys owne ſynnes / and that can tourne hym ſelfe to gody by inwarde compunccyon / and he is happy alſo that auoydeth fro hym all thynges that may offende or greue his conſcyence. Fyght

It is muche expedient & more ꝓfytable that a mā ſomtyme lacke cōſolacions in his lyfe than that he haue thē alwayes after his wyl namely fleſſhely cōſolaciōs. Neuertheles that we haue nat ſomtyme heuenly cōſolacyōs or that we ſo ſeldome fele theym as we do. It is through our owne defaute: for we ſeke nat to haue the true cōpunctyon of herte ne we caſte nat fully awaye from vs the falſe outwarde conſolacyons: holde thy

ſelfe therfore vnwordy to haue any conſolacyon and worthy to haue moche trybulacion / whan a man ſoroweth perfytly for hys ſynnes / than all wordly comfortes be paynfull to hym. A good man fyndeth alway mater inough why he oweth ryghtfully to ſorowe & wepe / for yf he beholde hym ſelfe or if he thynke on his neyghbour / he ſeeth well that none lyuethe here without great myſery and the more throughly that he may cōſyder him ſelfe The more ſorowe he hath and alway the mater of true ſorowe and of true inly conpunccyō is the remēbraūce of our ſynnes wherwith we be ſo bylapped on euerye ſyde that ſeldome we maye beholde any ghoſtly thingꝭ.

But for as moche as theſe thynges go nat to the herte & we yet loue the

flateringe and the falſe pleaſures of this worlde / therfore we remayne colde and voyde of deuocyon / and ofte it is through the weykenes of the ſpirite that the wretched body ſo lyghtly cōplayneth.

Therfore they ſhall moſte profyte in vertue byfore all other that enforce theym ſelfe myghtely to ouercome tho thynges that be moſte greuous and moſte cōtraryous to thē For a man profyteth there moſte & there wynneth moſte grace where he mooſte ouercommeth hym ſelfe / and wherin he moſte mortyfyeth his bodye to the ſoule.

Two thynges helpe a man moche to amendemente of lyfe / that is a myghty withdrawynge of hym ſelfe from thoſe thynges that the bodye mooſte inclineth hym to / and a feruent laboure for ſuche vertuous as he hathe mooſt nede of.

Man alſo is therby defended fro the wrathe to come / & almighthy god and the penitente ſoule mete louyngly together in holy kyſſynges of heuēly loue. A meke concricion of herte is to the lorde a ryght acceptable ſacrifice / more ſwetely ſauouryng in thy ſyght thā brennyng enſcence. It is alſo the precious oyntmēt that thou woldeſt ſhulde be ſhede vpō thy bleſſed fete / for a meke & a contryte herte thou neuer dyſpyſeſt. This contricyon is the place of refuge fro the drede & wrathe of the enemye / and therby is waſhen and clenſed / what ſo euer is before miſdone or that is defouled throughe ſynne in any maner.

Nothynge ſo muche pleaſeth god / as that a man loue hym aboue all thynge / as I ſhall ſhewe to the by a ſymylytude of a Pagan woman / whiche knowynge nothynge of the faythe / thoughe to her

ſelfe thus I knowe ſayde ſhe of what mater I am come in to thys worlde / and of what thynges I came in to my mothers wombe. ♣ And I beleue that it had bene impoſſible that I ſhulde haue had my body ſo knyt togyther as it is / and my reaſon and vnderſtandynge / but they had be gyuen vnto me / and therrfore I knowe well there is ſome creatoure and mayſter of me that hathe made me a reaſonable creaure / nat deformed me lyke vnto wormes or ſerpentes / wherfore me thynketh that though I had many huſbandes and all they called me / I wolde rather come at one callynge of my creatoure than at the callynge of them all. I haue alſo many ſonnes and many doughters / and ne neuertheleſſe if I ſawe them haue meate in theyr handes / and I knewe my creatoure to wante meate / I wolde take the meate from my chyldren and wolde gladly gyue it vnto my creatour / I haue alſo many poſſeſſyons / whiche I order after myne owne wyll / and neuertheles yf I knewe the wyll of my creatour / I wolde gladely leaue myne owne wyll and dyſpoſe them to his honour. But my doughter ſe what god dyd with thys pagan woman.

He ſente vnto her one of his electe ſeruauntes / that inſtructed her in the faith / and god hym ſelfe viſyted her herte as thou mayſte well knowe and vnderſtande hereafter by the anſwere of the woman. ☞: For whan that man ſhewed vnto her that there was one god withoute begynnynge / and withoute endyng that is to ſay the creatoure and maker of all thynges / he anſwered and ſayde. It is well to be beleued that he yt hath created me & all thingꝭ / that he hath no creatour aboue hym / and it is lyke that hys life is euerlaſtynge that myght gyue me lyfe. ★: And whan the woman herde ferther that the ſame creatoure toke manhoude of a vyrgyne / and that he preched in this worlde / and taught the people in his owne perſone / ſhe anſwered. ♣ It is to beleue god in euery thynge / and than ſhe ſayde further ♣: I pray the ſhewe me what be the wordes that my Creatoure dyd ſpeake and commaunde / for I wyll holly leaue myne owne wyll / and fully obey vnto hym / and to euery worde that he hathe ſpoken. Than whan he declared vnto her of the paſſyon of our lorde / of his croſſe / hys dethe / and of hys reſurrecciō.

The woman with great wepyng anſwerered and ſayde. Bleſſed be my creatour yt ſo pacyently ſheweth hys charite in the worlde / that he had to vs in heuen. And therfore yf I loued hym / fyrſte bycauſe he created me / I am nowe more bounden to loue hym / bycauſe he hathe ſhewed me the ſtreght waye vnto heuen / and hath redemed me with hys precyous blode / and I am bounde therfore to ſerue hym with all my ſtrength and all ye partes of my bodye / and I am bounden alſo to remoue all my deſyre from me that I had / fyrſte to my poſſeſſyons / and to my chyldren and kynſmen / and onely to deſire to ſe my creatoure in hys glorye that neuer ſhall haue ende. Than ſayde our bleſſed lady to ſaint Birget (Lo doughter) Howe greate rewarde that woman had for her great loue. ♣ So is dayly gyuen greate rewarde to euery man after the loue that he hathe vnto god whyle he lyueth in thys worlde.
               
               
                  
                     ❧:Our lorde Ieſu Chryſte gyueth to his ſpouſe ſaynte Birget a notable doctrine of ye lyues Actyue & Contēplatiue which be notable ſygnifyed by Martha / 

and Mary Magdaleyne / that is to ſaye howe a man ſhall begyn & profyte in the lyfe ſpūall / & in grace and vertue that he may finally aſcende vnto the hyghe degre of the loue of god / & of hys neyghbour / whiche doctryne appereth in the .vi. boke of the reuelacyons of ſaynte Birget. The .lxv. Chapiter.
                  THe ſone of god ſpeketh to his ſpouſe ſaynt Birget / ſayenge thus. ★: There be two lyues whiche be lykened to Martha / & Mary Magdaleyne / & who ſo euer wyll folowe thoſe two lyues muſte make pure confeſſyon of all his ſynnes / takynge very contricyon for them / hauynge full wyl neuer after to offende. And the fyrſte lyfe as I do wytneſſe my ſelfe in my goſpell / Mary Magdaleyne dyd choſe whiche ledeth a man to contēplacion / that is to ſaye to the beholdinge of heuenly thynges / and that is the beſt parte and is the very way of the lyfe euerlaſtynge. Therfore euery man that coueyteth to folowe the lyfe of Mary / that is to ſaye the lyfe contemplatyue It ſuffyſeth to hym to haue onely

the neceſſaryes for the body / that is to ſay clothynge without vanyte / mete and drynke in ſcarſyte / and nat inſuꝑfluytye. Chaſtitie without any yuell delectacyon faſtynge and abſtynence after the ordynaunce of the churche / and he that faſteth muſte take hede that he be nat ouermuche enfebled and made weyke by hys vnreaſonable faſtynge / leſte thoroughe that weyknes he be inforced to leaue his prayers and his counſayle gyuynge / or other good dedes / wherewith he myghte bothe profyte hym ſelfe and hys neyghboure alſo. And he muſte alſo dilygently take hede that he be nat through hys faſtynge ye more ſlowe to iuſtice / nor more ſlaker to the workes of mercy / for why: to punyſhe rebels / and to bryng infideles vnder the yoke of the fayth is requyſyte greate ſtrengthe as well of body / as of ſoule. ♣ Therfore euery ſeke perſone that wolde rather to the honour of god: faſte then ete / ſhall haue lyke rewarde for hys good wyll / as he that faſteth of charytie. And in lyke wyſe / he that for obedyence eteth / deſyring rather to faſte: thā to eate ſhall haue lyke rewarde as he yt faſtethe Seconde the contemplatyue man ſhall

nat ioye of the honoure of the worlde / nor of the proſperyte thereof / ne ſorowe for his aduerſyte / but he ſhall ioye ſpecyally in thys / that wycked men be come deuoute men / that louers of the worlde be come louers of God / and that good men profyte in goodnes / and be through good labour and dilygence in the ſeruyce of god made dayly more deuoute than other ☞ Of this alſo the contemplatyue man ſhall ſorowe that ſynners be made dayly worſe and worſe / that almyghty god is nat beloued of hys creatures / as he ought to be / and that the commaundementes of God be diſpiſed and ſette at nought. ★ Thyrdely the contemplatyue man may nat be ydell / ne no more maye he that vſeth the actyue lyfe / but anone whan he hath taken his neceſſarye ſlepe he ſhall ryſe and thanke almyghty God with all his herte / for that he hath create and made all thynges / and that of hys charyte by takynge our nature he hathe reformed and renewed mankynde / ſhewynge by hys paſſyon and deathe the loue that he hath to man / whiche is ſo greate that none can be greater. ♣ Alſo the contemplatyue man ſhall thanke almyghty

God for all theym that be ſaued / and for all them that be in purgatorye / and for them that yet be lyuynge in the worlde / prayenge mekely for them vnto our lorde that he ſuffre them nat to be tempted aboue theyr power. ☞: The contemplatyue man alſo muſte be dyſcrete in hys prayers / and well ordered in hys laudes and prayſynges of God / for yf he haue ſufficyent to lyue with withoute laboure or buſyneſſe / he muſte make the longer prayers. And yf he be wery and temptatyon ryſe in hys prayers / he may laboure with his handes ſome honeſte and profytable werke / eyther for hym ſelfe yf he haue nede or for other. ☞ And if he be in maner yrkeſome with bothe / that is to ſaye: with prayer and laboure / than he may haue ſome other honeſt occcupacion or here ſome good holſome wordes / or profytable counſeyls in all ſobernes / all ſcur
                        •
                     ylytie and vncleane wordes ſette aparte tyll the body and ſoule be made more apte / and more able to the ſeruyce of god. ★ And if the contemplatyue man haue nat ſufficyent to lyue with all / but through his labour / than maye he make the ſhorte prayers for hys neceſſarye labour

/ and that laboure ſhalbe the perfeccion and encreaſynge of hys prayer / and if he can nat laboure nor maye nat / than let nat hym be aſhamed / ne thynke it nat greuous to begge / but rather that he be ioyous for it / for than he foloweth me the ſonne of God that made my ſelfe poore: to make man ryche / and yf the contemplatyue man be vnder obedyence / than he muſte lyue after the obedyence of hys prelate / and hys rewarde ſhalbe double more than yf he were at lybertye. Fourthly the contemplatyue man maye nat be couytous / no more maye the actyue man / nor he maye nat be prodygall for as the actyue man dyſtrybuteth temporall goodes for god / ſo the contemplatyue man muſt diſtrybute hys ſpirytuall goodes. Morouer yf the contemplatyue man wyll haue almyghty god inwardly in his herte: let hym beware to ſaye thus as many do. It ſuffyſeth to me yf I can ſaue myne owne ſoule / for yf I can do ſo / what haue I to do with the dedes of other men / or yf I be good my ſelfe / what is it to me howe other lyue. O my doughter / they that ſay or think ſo / if they ſawe theyr frende diſhoneſte and troubled / they

wolde renne with all theyr power to the deathe / that theyr frende myght be delyuered out of his trouble / ſo ſhall the contemplatyue man do / he muſt ſorowe that almyghty god is offended that hys brother whiche is his neyghbour hath occaſyon to offende. And if any fall into ſyn / the contemplatyue man ſhall endeuoure hym all that he can to helpe hym oute of his ſynne with all diſcreſſyon. And yf he haue trouble or perſecucyon for it / lette hym leaue that place and ſeke an other place that is more quyet. For I my ſelfe that am very good / ſayde vnto my diſcyples thus. If they perſecute you in one cytie flye ye in to an other: and ſo dyd Paule / the whiche by cauſe he ſhulde be more neceſſarye an other tyme / was let go by a wall in a baſket. Therfore that the contemplatyue man may be lyberall and pitious / there be fyue thynges neceſſarye vnto hym. The fyrſte is a houſe in the whiche his geſtes maye ſlepe. The ſeconde is clothynge to clothe the naked. The thyrde is meate to fede the hungry. The fourth is fyre to warme theym that be colde. ♣ The fifte is medicins for them that be ſeke that is to ſaye: good confortable

wordes with the charyte of god. ❧:★The houſe of the contemplatyue man is his hert / wherof the yuell gheſtes be all tho thinges that trouble hys hert / that is to ſaye / wrathe / heueneſſe / couetyſe / pryde / and many other lyke. Therfore all tho vyces whan they come / they ſhall in maner lyke as gheſtes that be on ſlepe / and as they that be at reſte. ☞ For as an hoſte receyueth yuell gheſtes / and good with pacyence / ſo the contemplatyue man muſte ſuffre all thynges / for god throughe vertue of pacyence / and in no wyſe to conſent to vyces / nat to them that ſeme leſte ne to delyte in theym / but as muche as he maye be lytell and lytell throughe the helpe of grace / to remoue them clerely out of the herte. ♣ And yf he can not clerely remoue theym / he muſte ſuffre them pacyently agaynſte his wyll as enemyes: and neuer to aſſent to them knowynge certeynly that they ſhall profyte hym to the greater rewarde in heuen and nat to dampnacion. Seconde the contemplatyue man muſte haue clothes to cloth his gheſtes / that is to ſay mekeneſſe bothe inwarde and outewarde / and compaſſyon of mynde for the afflyction

of hys neyghbour. And yf the contemplatiue man be dyſpyſed of ye worlde lette hym thynke howe I the God almyghty beynge contempned and dyſpyſed ſuffred pacyentely / and whan I was iudged I helde my peace / and whan I was ſcourged: and crowned with thornes I murmured nat. The contemplatyue man alſo muſte take hede / that he ſhewe nat to them that reproue hym / or rebuke hym any ſynnes of anger or impacyence / but that he bleſſe thē that perſecute him / that they that ſe it may bleſſe god whome ye contemplatyue man doth folowe / and almyghty god ſhal gyue bleſſynges for tho maledi
                        •
                     cyons. The contemplatyue man muſte be ware alſo that he do nat ſpeke yuell of them nor rebuke them that do greue hym / for it is dampnable to bacbyte other / and wylfully to here them that do bacbyte / or thoroughe impacyence for to reproue or rebuke hys neyghbour. Than that the contemplatyue man maye haue perfytely the gyfte of mekenes and pacyence / he muſte ſtudy to admonyſſhe and warne them that do bacbyte other / of the greate peryl that they ſtande in / and that he exorte theym

in all charyte with wordes and with examples to perfyte mekenes. Alſo the clothynge of the contemplatyue man muſte be compaſſyon / for yf theſe hys neyghbours do any ſynne: he muſte haue compaſſyon of hym / prayenge to almyghty god to haue mercy vpon hym. ★: And yf he ſe hym ſuffre any wronge or hurte / or reproue: he muſte be ſory for hym and helpe hym with hys prayers / and with his ayde and dilygence / and that yf nede be before the greate Men of the worlde for the true perfyte compaſſyon ſekethe nat that is hys / but that is hys neyghbours. ♣ And yf the contemplatyue man be ſuche a one that he is nat herde with prynces / and that it profytethe nat that he go out of hys ſelfe. ☞: Than he ſhall praye hartely for theym that be in trouble and almyghty god that is the beholder of mannes herte / for the charytye of hym that prayeth / ſhall turne the hertes of the people to the peace and quyetneſſe of hym that is in trouble / ſo that he ſhall eyther be delyuered oute of hys trouble / or he ſhall haue pacyence ſente hym of god to ſuffre it / and ſo his rewarde ſhalbe doubled. Therfore ſuch clothynge / that

is to ſay: mekenes and compaſſyon muſt be in the herte of the contemplatiue man for nothynge ſo myghtely draweth god in to the herte as mekenes and compaſſyon of the neyghbour dothe. Thyrdely the contemplatiue man muſt haue meate and drynke for hys geſtes / for ſomtyme yuell geſtes do lodge in the herte of the contemplatiue man / that is to ſay whan the herte is drawen fro beholdynge of it ſelfe: and coueteth thynges delectable / to ſe worldely thynges / to haue poſſeſſion of temporall goodes. ☞ And whan the eeres deſyre to here hys owne honowre / the fleſſhe deſyreth to delyte in carnall thynges / the ſpirite leyth excuſe of his fraylneſſe / and that ſyne is but lyght and whan there cometh a paynfulneſſe and an hardeneſſe for to do good dedes / and a forgetfulneſſe of thynges to come. ❧:And whan he thynketh hys good dedes great and forgetteth hys yuell dedes. Agaynſte all ſuche gheſtes it is neceſſarye for the contemplatyue man to haue good counſeyle / and nat to dyſſemble as thoughe he were a ſleape / but that be armed ſtrongely with trewe fayth anſwere vnto ſuche gheſtes: ſayeng thus.

I wyll haue nothyng of temporal goodꝭ but barely for the ſuſtaynynge of my bodely kynde / and I wyll nat ſpende houre nor time but to the honour of god nor I wyll nat take hede what is fayre or foule in the worlde / ne what is pleaſaunte or diſpleaſaunt to the fleſſhe: or ſauoury / or nat ſauoury to the mouth / but to ye pleaſure of god and helthe of my ſoule / for I wolde nat lette one houre but to the honour of god. Such a wyl is mete & drinke for the gheſtes that come / and that anſwere extyncteth and putteth awaye all inordynate delytes and pleaſures of the worlde and of the fleſhe. Fourthly the cō
                     tēplatyue man muſte haue fyre to warme his gheſtes and to gyue them lyght / this fyre is the herte of the holy ghoſt / it is impoſſible any man to leaue his owne wyll or to forſake the carnall loue of his frendes or the loue of ryches / but thoroughe the inſtincte and hete of the holy ghoſte. Alſo the contemplatyue man / howe holy and perfyte ſo euer he be / maye nat of hym ſelfe begynne nor contynue in good lyfe withoute helpe of grace in the hooly goſte. Therfore that the contemplatyue man may ſet a lyght before hys gheſtes.

Fyrſt lette hym thynke thus: Almyghty God hath created me / that I ſhulde honoure hym aboue all thynges. And in honourynge hym / that I ſhulde loue hym and drede hym / and he was borne of a virgyne to teache me the waye to heuen / and that I ſhulde folowe that waye in all mekenes. ☞ And with his deathe he opened the gates of heuen / that I ſhulde with grēate deſyre haſt me thyther. Alſo the contemplatyue man muſte examyne diligently all his dedes / all his thoughtꝭ and all his affeccyons / that is to ſay how he hath offended god / and howe paciently god ſufferethe man / and howe many wayes he calleth man vnto hym / ſuche thoughtes and ſuche gheſtes of the contemplatyue man: be in maner but as they were a ſlepe / but they be illumynate with the fyre of ye holy ghoſt / the which fyre than comethe in to the herte whan the contemplatyue man thynketh howe reaſonable it is to ſerue God / and whan he thynketh that he had leuer ſuffre all payne / than wyttyngly no prouoke God to wrathe / whoſe goodnes hys ſoule is create and made / and it is alſo redemed with hys precyous blode. Than alſo the

herte hath hete of his heuenly fyre / that is the holy ghoſte / whan the ſoule thynketh and dyſcernethe to what intente euery gheſt / that is to ſaye / euery thought 
                        •
                     ommethe. ☞ And whether it moue the mynde to couyte ioye perpetually or trā
                     ſitorie / and that he leaue no thought vndyſcuſſed: ne vncorrected with drede of god. ★: Therfore that thys fyre maye be goten / and whan it is goten that it may be falſely kepte. ☞: The contemplatyue man muſte laye to drye ſtickes / that is to ſaye: he muſte dilygently take hede of the mocyons of the fleſſhe / that it rebell nat agaynſte the ſpiryte. ♣ And he muſte put to all hys dylygence that the wordes of pitie and good prayers maye be deuoutly encreaſed / wherewith the holy ghoſte may haue delyte / but he muſte ſpecyally knowe and conſyder that where a fyre is made in a cloſe veſſell that hath no auoydaūce anone the fyre goeth oute / and the veſſell wereth colde. ♣: So it is with the contemplatyue man / yf he wolde nat lyue to nothynge els but that he myght do honour to God / It is expedyent that his mouth be opened / and that the flame of hys charytye go forthe. Than is the

mouthe opened whan by hys ſpeakynge whiche procedeth of feruent charytye / he getteth ſpiritual children to god / but the cōtemplatyue man muſte take good hede that he open his mouth to preach / where good men ſhalbe made more feruent / and where yuel men may be amended / where ryghtwyſenes maye be encreaſed / and yuell cuſtomes maye be put awaye. For the Apoſtle Paule ſomtyme wolde haue ſpoken but the holy ghoſt dyd prohybyte hym / and ſomtyme he helde hys peace / and whā tyme conuenyēt cam (he ſpake) and ſomtyme he vſed ſofte wordes / and an other tyme more ſharper wordes / and alwaye he ordered his wordes to the honour and glory of god / and to the confortynge and ſtrenthynge of the fayth. And if the contemplatiue man may nat preache but he hath good wyll and connynge to preache and lacketh good hearers / he muſte do as the fore dothe / the whyche goth about many mountaynes and ſerchethe with hys fete in many places and where he fyndeth the ſofteſte place / and mooſte apte for hym / there he maketh a dene to reſt hym in. ♣ So the contemplatyue man muſt aſſay with wordes / with

examples / and with good prayers / the hertes of many people / and where he fyndeth the hertes moſt apt to here the wordes of god / there he muſt tary in counſaylynge and inducynge the people to God all that he can. The contemplatyue man alſo muſte labour al that he can that cō
                     uenient auoydance maye be had for hys flame / for the greater that the flame is the mo be illumined and made hote therby. Than hath the flame conuenyente auoydaunce / whan the contemplatyue man neyther dredeth rebukes ne coueyteth nat hys owne prayſe / whan he neyther dredeth aduerſites / ne delyteth hym nat in proſperytyes: and than it is more pleaſure to God that he do hys good dedes openly than pryuely / that they that ſe them maye glorifye god. ♣ And it is to vnderſtāde: that the contemplatyue man muſte put forthe two flames / one ſecretely / an other openly / that is to ſaye he muſte haue a double mekenes. ☞: The fyrſte muſte be within forth in the herte. the ſeconde muſte be without forth to the worlde. The firſte is that the contemplatyue man thynke hym ſelfe vnworthy and vnprofytable to all good warkes.

and that he preferre nat hym ſelfe in hys owne ſyght aboue no man / ne that he coueyte nat to be lauded nor to be ſene in the worlde that he flye pryde / and deſyre god aboue all thynge / folowing hys wordes & his teachinges. And if the contemplatyue man put forth ſuch a flame with good warkes / than hys herte ſhalbe illumyned with charytye / and all the contrarious thynges that come vnto hym ſhall lyghtly be ſuffred and ouercome. The ſeconde flame muſt be openly / for if perfyte mekenes be in the herte / it muſte alſo appere in hys apparell without forthe / and be herde in hys wordes / and be performed in hys dedes. True mekeneſſe is in the apparell / whan the contemplatyue man coueytet more to haue clothynge of ſmal pryce whiche is profitable / than clothyng of greater value wherby he maye fall in to pryde / and in to a deſyre to be ſene in the worlde / for that apparell that is lytell worth: and is called in ye worlde vyle and abiecte / is very fayre and precyous before god / for it prouoketh mekenes. And that apparrell that is of greate pryce and is called fayre in the worlde / is very foule and vnſemely before god / for

for it takethe awaye the fayrenes of aungels / that is to ſaye mekeneſſe. ☞: But yf the contemplatyue man for any reaſonable cauſe be conſtrayned to haue an habyt ſomwhat better than he wolde: let hym nat be troubled therfore / for hys rewarde ſhall therby be encreaſed. Alſo the contēplatyue man muſte haue meakenes in his mouth / that is to ſaye in ſpekynge meke thynges / eſchewynge all rybaldry and ſuperfluytye of wordes / nat ſpeakynge ſubtylly ne diſceytfully / ne preferrynge his ſentence before other. And yf the contemplatyue man here hym ſelfe prayſed for any good dedes / lette hym nat be lyfte vp in hys hert therfore / but that he anſwere thus. All laude and honour be to god that gyuech all thynges. ❧What am I but duſte in the wynde / or what goodnes commethe of me that am nought elles but drye earthe withoute water? ☞:♣ And yf he be reproued in the worlde / lette hym nat be moued therwith / but that he anſwere thus. I am worthy all thys and muche more for I haue ſo ofte offended god / and haue nat made amendes therfore agayne. Therfore praye ye for me therby ſuffring

of ſuche temporall reproues / I maye eſcape the ſhames and reproues euerlaſtynge. ★ And yf the contemplatyue man be prouoked to anger or wrathe by the vngoodly dealynge of hys neyghbours lette hym be well warre & take good hede that he anſwere nat vndiſcretely / for cō
                     menly pryde foloweth anger and wrath. Therfore it is good coūſayle / that whan anger or pryde come: that he holde hys peace ſo longe tyme / tyll the wyll maye aſke helpe of God to ſuffre / and to take good auyſemente howe and what to anſwere / that he maye fyrſte ouercome him ſelfe / and than the wrathe ſhalbe abated in the herte / ſo that he maye anſwere wyſely to them that be vnwyſe. ☞:♣:Thou ſhalte knowe alſo that the deuyll hath greate enuye to a contemplatyue man: and yf he can nat hynder hym by breakynge of the commaundementes of god / than he wyll ſtyrre hym to be eyther lyghtly moued with wrathe / or to be dyſpoſed to ſomme vayne and vndyſcrete myrth / or elles to haue ſome vayne and vnprofytable wordes. ☞: Therfore the cōtemplatyue man muſt alway aſke helpe of god that all hys wordes and dedes

be gouerned by hym and be holly directed vnto hym. ♣ And the contemplatyue man muſte haue mekeneſſe in all his workes / that is to ſay / that he do nothynge for worldly prayſe / ne that he attempte no newe thynge of hym ſelfe / and that he be nat aſhamed of no worke how vyle ſo euer it be / ſo that he maye therby pleaſe god / that he flye ſyngularytye that he do good to all that he can / and in euery good dede that he dothe / thynke that he myght haue do better. ♣: Alſo he muſte choſe to ſytte rather with poore men than with ryche / rather to obey thā to commaunde / to kepe ſcylence rather than to ſpeake / to be ſolytarye than to be with myghty men or with hys worldely frendes. ♣: Alſo the contemplatyue man muſte hate hys owne wyll / ofte remembre his dethe / flye curioſyte / all murmuringe and grudgynge / alway remembre the ryhgtwyſeneſſe of god / and take hede of his owne affeccyons. Alſo the contemplatyue man muſte ofte vſe confeſſion be ſtable and dilygent in his temptacyons / and nat be deſyre to lyue to none other entente / but that the honoure of God / and helthe of ſoules maye be encreaſed.

★Than if the contemplatyue man that hath ſuche affeccyons and ſuche deſyres as is ſayde before / be choſen into the offyce of an Actyue man / and of obedyence and charyte to god he taketh vpon hym the rule of other he ſhall haue a double rewarde / as it maye appere by thys ſymylytude. ★ There was a myghtie man that had a ſhyppe charged with precious marchaundiſes / whiche ſayde to hys ſeruaunt this. ★ Go ye with this ſhippe to ſuche a porte / for ther I ſhall haue ryght greate encreaſe / if ye wynde ryſe laboure manfully and yrke nat at it / for your rewarde ſhalbe great. After as the ſeruaūt ſayled / a greate wynde roſe / the ſtormes wexed greate and the ſhyppe was toſſed and broken greuouſly. Than the gouernour of the ſhippe wexed wery and ſlowe and all that were in the ſhip diſpeyred of theyr lyues / and agreed to go to ſome other porte whyther as the wynde wolde dryue them / and nat to that porte that their lorde had appoynted them to.
