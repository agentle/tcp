            The Politicall Touchſtone, Taken From Mount Pernaſſus: Whereon the Governments of the greateſt Monarchies of the World are touched.

            THE PREFACE.
            
               THE trueſt and ſecurest precepts of Policie are thoſe, which either are drawen from the prudent reſolutions, or vnadviſed errors of great Princes in the deliberations of their most important affaires, or from the ſtudy of Policie; all conſisting in a ſevere, and iudicious cenſure of the actions of the Great: and the ſtudious in Histories, which haue the gift to know how to examine them well, draw out of them moſt excellent rules, for the wel-governing of many people: which being very true, it is no marvaile, if the best Writers of matters of State have growen extreamely odious to thoſe that raigne; by reaſon, that as Princes willingly lend an eare to the praiſes which happen to be given them, although they come from the pen, or mouth of an impudent Flatterer, ſo likewiſe they haue in exceeding abhomination all cenſures which are made vpon their actions: it being an inſupportable miſerie vnto them, that their imprudence, and calamities, should ſerve for instructions vnto others, not to commit the like faults. This truth aſſures me, that theſe my preſent Advertiſements from Pernaſſus, (where in a ſporting manner the actions, interests, true ends, and defects of many Princes, not very iuſt, coming to be cenſured, touched, diſcovered, and noted) would bring them infinite diſpleaſure, if they should be openly published. Wherevpon, I, that at any hand will not give diſguſt

to any perſon private or publike whatſoever, haue fully reſolved to keepe them from the Preſſe, as from the fire: for the length of time maturing things, that, which for infinite reſpects, in our Age is odious, the preſent Princes wanting, and thoſe affaires growing olde, which now liue: and that in regard of their importance are held in great ielouſie, I hope that theſe my Labours will then with particular liking bee read of the Vertuous, whom I indevour to pleaſe and delight: In the meane time I haue preſumed to hide theſe my Writings in your Lordships Librarie, vnto whom I preſent them, to the end they may be published to the world at ſuch time as they cannot giue distaſte to any one. But then my deſires shalbe accomplished, when theſe my Workes, ſuch as they are, may giue vnto your Lordship that ſatisfaction, which I ſo exceedingly deſire, in regard of the infinite devotion I beare vnto your Name, and the innumerable obligations, wherein I ſtand ingaged vnto you, which haue created me a debtor vnto you in ſo great a ſumme, that if I should ſpend my whole life in your ſervice, yet I should thinke I had done nothing, but that ſtill I should die ingratefull.

            CHAP. 1. The Spanish Monarchy arrives at Pernaſſus: beſeecheth Apollo she may be cured of an Yſsue in her arme, and by the Politicall Phyſicians is dismiſſed.
            
            
               ALthough the Majeſtie of Apollo had decreed vnto the High & Mighty Monarchy of Spayne immediatly vpon her arrivall at this Court (vvhich vvas ſome fovvre months paſt) not only a ſolemne entrance, but the publike Conſiſtory of the Learned in the Royall Hall of Audience, vvith the preſence of the Excellent Muſes: yet vvas it not executed, vntill tvvo dayes ſince, by reaſon she conſumed all thoſe fovvre moneths in according vvith the Princely Poets ſuch Titles as she vvas to giue, and receiue from others: and in agreeing hovv to receiue, and hovv to be receiued in Viſitations: vvhilſt the Vertuous ſtood amazed, and bitterly complayned of the hard condition of theſe modern times plagued vvith the corruption of ſuch vanity: but greater vvas the affliction of the Vertuous, becauſe many Learned Princes openly refuſed to be viſited by that great Queene, ſaying, That they ſuſpected the receiving ſome affront from her, for that they had lately Letters out of Italy, vvherein they vvere adviſed by their friends to ſtand vpon their guard,

it being the particular cuſtome of the Spaniards, to goe to viſit perſons more to iniure, then to honor them; and that therefore it ſeemed to them a kind of exceeding madnes, in ſtead of avoiding affronts, to attend them in their houſes, and reverently to receiue them vvith Cappe in hand. And albeit ſo potent a Monarchy to the great vvonder of all men had shevved herſelf much more ſparing, in giuing to others ſatisfaction of Titles, then in beſtovving her golden Piſtolets; nevertheles she hath receiued from thoſe Princely Poets, and from all the Vertuous Potentates, that more regard the ſubſtance, then the vanity of things, in this ſame titular buſines, as much content as she could deſire. Hovvbeit, the reputation of ſo great a Queen hath bin much blemished in this Court, by reaſon she is ſeen, notvvithſtanding the extreme neceſsity that lyeth vpon her for the acquiſition of friends, to shevv her ſelf too forvvard in alienating ſuch from her, as deſire nothing of her, but ſatisfaction of vvords. Further, it hath bin obſerved for a particular of much note, hovv the Mr. of the Ceremonies advertiſed her, that that great punto she ſo ſtands vpon, is an odious thing, onely proper to barbarous Kings, and moſt vnvvorthy ſo great a Lady, and ſuch a Princeſſe of Europe as she vvas: vvhereunto vvith much diſdaine she anſvvered, Hovv she vvondered that he, conſidering the place he held, should haue ſo litle vnderſtanding, as not to knovv, that a Prince vvith out gravity, shevveth like a Peacocke vvithout a tayle. It is not poſſible to vvrite, vvith vvhat curioſity and deſire this Princeſſe vvas expected, nor vvhat a concourſe of people came from all parts of Apolloes State, to looke vpon this povverfull Queene, that vvith ſuch a monſtrous courſe of felicity hath in ſo short a time vnited vnder her moſt

ſpatious Kingdomes, and therof framed an Empire ſo formidable, that there is not a Prince in the vvorld, vvhich for ſuſpition of her hath not armed himſelfe. The Monarchy of Spayne in compariſon of thoſe of France, of England, and other ancient Monarchies, is young in age, but of body farre bigger then any other vvhatſoeuer; and according to the proportion of yeres she is of, of an vnmeaſurable greatnes: vvhence it is argued, that if she continue grovving vnto that terme, vvherein humane bodies are wont to come to their full perfection, she will become ſo great a Gyanteſſe, that she will arriue to that vnmeaſurable height of the Vniverſall Monarchies, wherunto the Rom. Monarchy attained: but the accidents of matters of State affirme for certain, that she wil neuer be bigger: and that she was as high in her tendreſt yeres, as euer she vvilbe in any time to come whatſoever. The which is plainly demōſtrated by this apparant argument, that in theſe preſent times she hath grovven more ſlovvly halfe a fingers breadth, then she did tvvo handfulls in times paſt. This mighty Lady is of complexion very tavvny, much inclyning to the Moore: therefore her cuſtomes are rather proud, then graue; and in all her actions, hath more of the cruell, then the ſevere: ſo that not having beene able, nor deſirous to learne that art (ſo neceſſary for a Prince) of pardoning, it is the firme opinion of many, that thereby her greatnes is the more impeached: for placing her eſtimation vpon nothing more, then to be called the Mistris of Nations, in the knovvledge of being moſt reſolute to ſtrike off the heads of ſuch odious Poppies, as in the gardens of her States overtop their fellovves, she reioyceth not a litle, that she is ſaid in that ſort to haue gone beyond that Tarquin the Great, vvho vvas the firſt inventor of ſuch a ſecret.

Being then ſo reſolute in the execution of ſeuerities, she is much perplexed in conferring of graces, vvhich are ſeene to proceed very ſeldome from her; and thoſe too she doth, are granted vvith ſo much authoritie, as they are not very acceptable: Hovvbeit in apparance, she is all mildnes, and vvholly diſſolved into Complements: but he that vvith the politicall Spectacle knovveth hovv to penetrate into the invvard of the heart, shall diſcover her to be all pride, all covetouſneſſe, and cruelty; in ſuch ſort, that they vvhich haue long negotiated vvith her, report; That there is not any Princeſſe from vvhom come ſvveeter vvords, and bitterer deeds: vvhereby it happeneth, that as a friend she greatly allureth men, and as a Miſtres exceedingly terrifieth them. Her hands be out of all proportion long, vvhich she extendeth euery vvhere, as may be moſt for her profit, vvithout diſcerning friend from foe, or a ſtranger from a kinſman: She hath the nailes of an Harpy moſt rapacious; vvith fingers of ſo hard and ſtrong a tenure, that she neuer letteth goe any thing, vvhich she once faſtneth on. Her eyes be blacke, and of a merveilous sharpe ſight: She looketh afquint, ſo that fixing her eye vpon one, she attentiuely beholdeth another: (a matter of much danger to Princes for of late yeares, having ſet her face vpon Argier, before any body vvas avvare, she faſtned her looke vpon 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  . And in thoſe eyes is diſcouered a world of greedines, becauſe she neuer beholdes any thing, that she doth not earneſtly covet vvith her heart; vvhereupon the Speculatiue affirme, That this Queene is enflamed vvith an immoderate thirſt of others Eſtates; and she never had freind, vvhom in a short time vvith ſundry deviſes she made not a ſlaue. All vvhich doe manifeſt vnto the

vvorld, that she is fitter to governe ſlaues then free-men. She ſtandeth ſo much vpon the punto of State, that she vvill not vouchſafe to ſtirre a foot for to encounter good occaſions, vvhich many tymes haue gone home even to her ovvne doores to find her out. She goeth beyond all other Queenes vvhatſoever, either paſt or preſent, in the knovvledge hovv to cover vvith the cloake of hypocriſie any intereſt of hers, though neuer ſo diabolical: and albeit she is ſeene daily to enter into actions that are none of the beſt, yet she maketh oſtentation of nothing more, then of her Conſcience. Whence the French, ſo often deceiued vnder colour of moſt holy pretexts, haue at length to thier coſt learned to arme themſelues, and get to horſe, aſſoone as they once heare her propound matters full of pretences of Religion, and bleſſed Charitie tovvards her moſt beloved Neighbor. She is ſo excellent in the exerciſe of horſemanship, that she hath not only vvith good fortune tamed the generous Courſes of Naples, but alſo made gentle even thoſe moſt vitious mules of Spayne, that by their naturall inſtinct are ſo vvilde and vnruly. She is aboue all other Ladies moſt ſuſpitious, inſomuch that, her ovvne Nation excepted, she truſteth not any of all thoſe that are ſubiect vnto her, though vpon all occaſions she hath proved them moſt faithfull: a matter of ſuch preiudice vnto her, that the vnderſtanding part of the vvorld plainly ſay, hovv for that only moſt important defect, it is not poſſible she should euer grovv greater: And this happeneth, becauſe no Prince living eareth leſſe then she to be loved of her people, placing all her ſtudy hovv to make her ſelf to be feared. Whereupon the Polititians: haue obſerved it as a kind of very great madneſſe in her, to be ſo confidently perſwaded as she is, that

she can dravv people to adore her by oppreſſing them: Nevertheleſſe, with theſe ſo odious Cuſtomes she allureth all men vnto her ſervice, for the infinite abundance of her treaſures is that calamitie, which vvith ſuch violence haleth vnto her even thoſe minds, that are bound to abhorre her. She is moſt accurate in petty things, but in great affaires no other Queene hath ſuffered herſelf to be more eaſily deceived. In diſcourſing of, and reſolving importāt matters, she sheweth admirable vnderſtanding and prudence; but either by her naturall ſloth, or the cunning of her miniſters, moſt covetous Marchants of great buſineſſes; or becauſe it ſeemeth vnto her, that no reſolution is made with Decorum, if it be not a long time expected by the World, she executeth her reſolutions vvith ſo much delay, that the face of affaires changing vvith the time, thoſe reſolutions which haue beene moſt prudently deliberated, haue often proved infortunate. And therefore it is the opinion of all men, that she is more able in laying of Plots, then in the managing of Armes, wherein she hath great courage, exceeding conſtancy, vnſpeakable patience of all diſcommodities: but ſo litle reſolution, that her extraordinary circumſpection hath many times the face of feare: whereupon she ſeemeth more apt to maintaine, then conquer States. There are many ſingular men, that laugh at her, for ruling all her actions by ſuch ſolide and mature counſels, without ever venturing any in the hand of that Chance, and Fate vvhich haue ſo favoured, and made glorious the French, when as on occaſions they haue bene carried more by valor, then diſcretion: And ſome are of the minde, how that only proceedeth, from her being as ſparing of her owne bloud, as she is thirſty after others: Whence it is,

that the moſt vnderſtanding Captaines in the Art of warre, deride her, for aſpiring to the Empire of the World, and yet will neuer fight: for this mighty Queene being reſolved to make acquiſition of great States by marriages, she abhorreth that dreadfull cuſtome of the French, to buy others Kingdomes with the price of their owne bloud. Being then more adviſed then couragious, she is more dangerous to her friend in peace, then to her enemy in vvarre; wherefore the French, that hitherto haue liued with her in a ſupine negligence, haue at length, after ſo many calamities learned to double barre the doore when once they haue concluded a peace with the Spaniards. She is moſt careleſſe of her owne, but ſo greedy of others riches, that she careth not to waſte her owne patrimoniall eſtates, ſo as thereby she may get anothers. She is ſo cloſe, ſo reſerved, that it is not poſſible for any cunning of man to find out her ends: but he that will iudge of the diſpoſition and cuſtomes of ſuch a Lady, muſt be fully perſwaded, that in all the affaires which either she manageth herſelfe, or others haue to negotiate with her, she is within quite contrary to that she appeareth without. And albeit that amongſt the aforeſaid vertues, she hath ſo notorious vices, yet by the greatneſſe of her fortune every thing in her is interpreted, and admired for Vertue: ſo that many wiſe Princes hold it an honor to imitate her, even in vices. She is of conſtitution very ſtrong: whereupon it is concluded, that she is long-liu'd, only she ſuffereth in the indiſpoſition of the diſtraction of her members; a matter that doth infinitely weaken ſo great a Body: and although with the ayde of the liberty of Genoa, and the alliance she hath with the Duke of Savoy, she vſeth many deviſes to vnite them: yet by the diverſity

of the intereſts of thoſe Potentates, she prevaileth litle. But ſuch a Princeſſe by nothing receiueth ſo much preiudice, as by her principall miniſters the Spaniards, whoſe ſervices alone she vſeth in the greateſt Charges, exerciſed by them with ſo much inſolency & odious pride, 
                  〈◊〉
                they will not be honored as men, but adored as gods: an impertinence, that hath made the Spanish Dominion diſtaſifull, not only to the Italians and Flemmings, but euen to the very Spaniards themſelves.
            This mighty Princeſſe then, appearing in the Royall Hall before the Maieſty of Apollo, she cauſed her ſeruants to vnbinde her left arme, and shewing it naked vnto Apollo, and to all the ſacred Colledge of the Learned, she ſpake in this manner: Lord, and Father of good letters, this vvhich you ſee, is that ſame ſtinking Yſſue of Flanders, vvhich the French, the Germanes, and ſome Italian Princes, vvhich ſeeme my friends, and that in bowelled beyond. Sea Renegada, made me ſo many yeeres ſince, out of the ſuſpition they had of mee. I grant, that the Princes I haue named, had iuſt cauſe to bee iealous of my power, at ſuch time, as after the death of Henry the ſecond, they ſaw France falne into the calamity of infant Kings; and that in their minority, I ſought to ſow diſſention in that Kingdome: But now that thoſe ſuſpitions are vvanting, and that in the great contention vvhich I had with the French; and particularly vvith that ſame vnchayned Prince of Bea
                     •
                  ne, I vvas condemned in coſts, I doe beſeech of your Maieſty, that ſo faſtidious an Yſſue may be ſtopped, ſince every one ſeeth, that by the great abundance of humors, vvhich are there concurring, it is become ſo raging a Canker, that I pray God, it doth not end vvith the ruine of the vvhole. I did not paſſe into Italy through

mine owne ambition, nor had that ardent deſire to poſſeſſe my ſelfe wholly of it, as mine enemies affirme: it is vvell knowne, that I was called, nay, forethly ha
                  •••…
                thither by the Princes of Italy themſelues, to deliuer them from the great feare they were in, of the domination of the French. And happy had it beene for my Houſe of Spayne, vvhich I had covered with Slate of ſilver, and Tyles of maſſie gold, if I never had had any thing to doe with the Italians; a double dealing Nation, full of deceits, and intereſts, and onely good to imbarke men in dangerous affayres vvithout Bisket, and then to abandon them in the middeſt of greateſt perils, making profeſſion of nothing more, then to fare well at other mens coſts: And it ſeemeth marueylous ſtrange to mee, that Italy, which (as every man knowes) hath ſuffered her ſelfe to be towzed by ſo many ſtrange Nations, should now make ſuch profeſſion of chaſtity to mee; that if shee ſee me never ſo little to moue, shee entreth ſtraight into a jealouſie, that I vvill depriue her of the honour of her Liberty. And albeit the greatneſſe, wherein the Kingdome of France ſtandeth at this inſtant, ſecureth Italy, and all the Princes which I have named, from the feare they are in of my power; yet vvhen it shall ſo ſeeme good to your Maieſtie, I am ready to give ſecurity to every one, of not offending, ſo that this ſame faſtidious Yſſue of mine may be ſtopped.
            By order then of his Maieſtie, the Yſſue then was diligently conſidered by the politicall Phyſicians; and having made an exquiſite conſultation thereupon, they delivered, That in regard the Spanish Monarchy was troubled with an ardent th
                  •
               rit of Domination, that Yſſue was neceſſary for her, whereby thoſe groſſe humors might be

purged away; which from Peru diſtilled downe into her ſtomacke, and cauſed that vnquenchable thirſt. And thoſe worthy Phyſicians conſidered, that if the ſayd Monarchy had not that Yſſue, there was manifeſt danger, that the pernicious humors of Peru, would mount vp into the head of Italy, with apparant ruine of the principall members, which now remaine free in her; and that the ſaid Monarchy of Spayne would fall into the Dropſie of an Vniuerſall Monarchy: to avoid vvhich inconveniences, nothing was ſo proper, ſaid they, as that ſame Yſſue of Flanders, which was to be kept open, ſo long as Peru miniſtred thoſe pernicious humors to the Monarchy of Spayne.
            
            This reſolution greatly diſpleaſed the Spanish Monarchy, vvherevpon being much incenſed, she ſaid thus; Sir, if through the malice of others I muſt ſo foully conſume away my ſelfe in miniſtring oyntments to the Canker, vvhich my enemies call a divertiue Yſſue, ſome peradventure, that litle dreame of it, shall haue their share in it: This was preſently apprehended by the English, the French, and Italians; who replied; That they cared not a rush for any thing she could doe: for they ſent but the refuſe of their States in to Flanders, whereas the Spaniards conſumed Gold, and vitall bloud there: And that to ſecure themſelues from the formidable power, and ambition of the Spanish, vvhich appeared to haue no Horizon, the English, French, Germans, and Italians, were forced conformable to the Aphoriſme of the politicall Hipocrates, Tacitus: Conſilijs & eſtu res externas moliri arma procul habere.
            
         
         
            
            CHAP. 2. The Monarchy of Spaine lamenteth, for that her Falshoods are diſcouered.
            
            I Know not whether it were by accident, or by the malice of ſome French-men, or indeed (as many haue grievouſly ſuſpected) by the plottings of that nation, which is ſuch an implacable enemy to the French: but ſo it was, that many yeares ſince, the Royall Palace of the Monarchy of France was ſet on fire, and ſo great was the Flame, and ſo terribly did it burne, that the neighbouring Monarchies were in extreame feare, leſt that fire wold end with the ruine of their States: in ſuch ſort, that for the preſervation of their owne, euery one ranne to the extinguishing of the flame of anothers houſe. The English, though natural enemies to the French, brought thither the waters of their Thames; the Germans thoſe of the Moſe, and of the Rhine; the Venetians emptied almoſt all their Lakes. And in truth it was a mervailous thing to ſee, that even the Monarchy of Spaine her ſelf, (eſteemed ſo cruell an enemy to the French) should labour amongſt the chiefeſt friends, to extinguish that fire; whereas the common fame went, she would rather haue reioyced to haue warmed herſelfe at it: wherevpon euery one remained much aſtonished, when they ſaw, that with care, and vnſpeakeable charitie, she not only brought thither her waters of Tagus, and Iberus, but even the boundleſſe Ocean it ſelf; whereof, when the English, and Hollanders will permit her, she is abſolute Miſtres. Howbeit, ſome Politicians ſiniſterly interpreting the charitie

of the Spaniards, publikely affirmed, that it was a pernitious matter in the occaſions of the French to admit the aſſiſtance of the Spaniards, who being eternall and capitall enemies to France, were rather to be recounted Architects of euery French ruine, then zealous of the greatneſſe of that Kingdome as men, that meaſuring all the actions of thoſe, which raigne in the workes of Princes, with the only Compaſſe of their intereſt, many times doe not admit even pietie towards God, much leſſe charitie towards men. But theſe Politicians were ſo much the more held in abhomination with the world, by how much it was moſt apparant, that the Spaniards in their diligence, and charitie to bring water vnto that fire, not onely equalled, but went beyond any friend whatſoeuer of the French: And that which encreaſed all mervaile, and brought high reputation to the Monarchy of Spaine with ſimple men, was, that Flanders, and Auſtria, her ancienteſt patrimonies, burning with the cruell flames of warre, she had preferred the ſafety of the French, before the care of her owne affaires. Now becauſe neither humane labour, nor any quantity of water was ſufficient to extinguish the leaſt ſparke of ſuch a dreadfull fire, but rather the flames of thoſe bloudy ciuill warres, notwithſtanding all diligence, and remedies, daily more and more encreaſed; euen good men, and the deuouteſt Simplicities began to lend an eare vnto the adviſe of the Politicians, and to ſuſpect, that the charitie of the Spanish Monarchy was altogether intereſt, which indeed is right Spanish charitie; ſo that they reſolved no longer to giue credit to apparences, but to looke into them, and ſee what matter it was, that the Spaniards brought in their Barrels: and they found, that

in ſtead of water, to quench the fire, they were filled with Pitch, Oyle, Rozin, and diabolicall diſſentions, to encreaſe it; which treachery alſo ſome French Barons were diſcouered to vſe, who more then others making profeſſion of extraordinary charitie, employed thoſe Barrels, and the matter in them, lent them by the Spanyards: Whereupon, vvith iuſt indignation they vvere ſlaine by the French Monarchy, and burned in the very ſame fire, vvhich vvith ſuch ſedition, and infidelity they had nourished in their Country. And the Spanyards were not onely chaſed away from that Worke, but vvith ſound of Trumpet proclaymed and published for Hypocrites; and by a particular Edict of the French Monarchy, the World vvas made to know, that if ever in time to come, there vvere any one found, that could be induced to beleeue, how any kind of charitie could fall into the minds of the Spanyards towards the French, he should bee held, and reputed for a notorious Simplicity: and that, if after the firſt admonition he should perſeuere in his errour, as malicious, and ſeditious, hee should be toſſed in a Blanket.
            It vvas ſtrange to ſee, how the Spanyards, and thoſe French before-named, had no ſooner abſtained from that Worke, but that the inflammation of France, vvhich before vvas ſo great, that even men of the beſt iudgement affirmed, how it vvas not poſſible to bee extinguished by any humane meanes, ceaſſed of it ſelfe: Whereupon, the famous Flowers-de-luce of Gold ſo trampled on before, roſe vp more reſplendent and flourishing, then ever they vvere; and France, that through the exceſſiue ambition of many, had beene cruelly tormented for forty yeeres together and better, became (to the great marvaile of all men) quiet, and pacified in the twinckling of an eye: ſo

that then it evidently appeared, that the Spaniards were the firſt Authors of that fire in France, which with ſuch farre pretences of Religion and charitie, they haue labored to make the world beleeue they would ſo faine haue extinguished. It is generally reported, that the Monarchy of Spaine retired herſelfe into her Royall Palace, and how for a long time together she would not ſuffer herſelfe to be ſeene of any one, giuing her ſelfe over to a deepe Melancholy, and with abundance of teares freely acknowledging, that she would rather haue loſt two of the beſt Kingdomes she had, then ſee the vvorld condemne, and deride thoſe holy pretences of hers, with which she had ſo often, to her infinite comodity, ſold even the moſt ſtinking Aſſafetida for Muſke, and Ambergriece: for now it ſeemed vnto her that she remayned without her richeſt treaſure, and that she had loſt the inexhauſtible Mynes of Gold and Siluer of Peru, and of all the new World, ſeeing she was depriued of the benefit of being able euer after to make the ſimple multitude beleeue, that blacke was white; thinking it withall a very hard caſe to be driuen to that fearefull paſſe, wherein she had alwaies ſeene the French, that she muſt be forced to make acquiſition of Kingdomes, only with the point of the ſword; whereas in times paſt, with the ſole apparences of her holy pretexts, vvhich had ſerved her in ſtead of a moſt flourishing army, she had put the whole world into combuſtion: And that it exceedingly grieved her to be fallen into ſuch an ill opinion with men, that she was in danger for the time to come, not to be beleeued any more in the truth; vvhere before, the diſſimulation of falſe pretences, and of the openeſt Hypocriſie that might be, carried the credit of moſt ſacred Truth, and of moſt perfect Devotion.

            THere came three Poſtes very lately vnto the Majeſtie of the Emperour Maximilian the ſecond; and preſently it vvas knowen, how they brought him advertiſement, that the Arch-duke Matthias had taken Armes againſt the Emperour Rodolphus his Brother, ſeditiouſly requiring the Kingdomes of Hungary and Bohemia, and the abſolute Dominion of Auſtria, and other Provinces. Theſe ill newes infinitly troubled the mind of the Emperour; for he vvell knew, that the diſcord riſen vp among his Sonnes, vvould giue the enemies of the Houſe of Auſtria that content, vvhich they ſo much deſired. Whereupon, yeſterday morning very early, that Prince preſented himſelfe before Apollo, and vvith many teares demanded of him, vvhen the evils of the Houſe of Austria, ſo long before commenced, through the cruell combination of all Germany againſt it, should have an end; and for vvhat demerit ſuch fearefull ſcourges vvere ſent vnto his Houſe. Vnto this demand Apollo anſwered in this ſort: All the troubles and perſecutions of your Family, great Emperour, shall ceaſe, vvhen it shall vvholly abandon thoſe ambitious thoughts of deſiring to command over Hungary, and Tranſilvania; vvhich hath given vnto Germany ſuch iealouſies, that to ſecure her auncient Liberty from the power of your Houſe, shee bendeth all her ſtudy to nothing more, then to the depreſſion of it: for the Germans, fearing greater prejudice from your acqueſts,

then from the victories of the Turkes, are fully reſolved rather to loſe Vienna, then recouer Buda. And then alſo shall all Germany vnfainedly loue your Arch-Dukes, when depoſing their preſent ambition, they shall make it appeare, that they deſire to be equall, and not ſuperior to other Princes of Germany.
            
         
         
            CHAP. 4. Philip the ſecond King of Spaine, after ſome conteſtation about his Title, entreth with great pompe into Pernaſſus.
            THe mighty King of Spayne, Philip the ſecond, who (ſome two months ſince arrived at this Court, was not permitted before yeſterday to make a publicke and ſolemne entry, becauſe that on certaine Tryumphall Arches, which with a Royall magnificence were erected vnto him by the Spanish Nation, theſe wordes were written: Philippo ſecundo Hiſpaniarum, vtriusſ
                     
                        
                     
                     que

                  . Which diſtaſting the greater part of the Italian Princes, they required them to be cancelled, ſaying: That they would not at any hand acknowledge from the Spaniards that peace of Italy, which with ready mony they bought of the Hollanders. This aromaticall matter was a long time diſputed, and albeit the Italian Princes had concludingly proved in iudgement, that the preſent peace of Italy was not to be acknowledged from the good mindes of the Spaniards, who would haue ſeized on it all, had it not beene for that great diuerſion, but altogether from the

warres of Flanders, yet in the greateſt heate of this contention, the Queene of Italy with her wonted prudence pacified the matter; for hauing called all her Princes together, she adviſed them to leaue oſtentation, and vainglory to the Spaniards, and applying themſelues to ſubſtantiall things to continue feeding them with breath. The concourſe both for number, and quality of Princes which aſſembled to grace, and ſerve ſo great a King, was the greateſt, and the honorableſt, that euer Pernaſſus had ſeene. And ſo powerful a Prince had place amongſt thoſe Monarchs, which are famous in the world more for prudence, and adviſednes vſed in peace, then for valor shewed in warre: and greatly did the Learned marvaile at the Impreſe, which he carried painted in his Standard generall, of a writing penne, wherewithall, by the teſtimony of Hiſtorians it plainly appeared, that in the potent Kingdome of France, and other places, where good occaſion had beene preſented vnto him to employ it, he had cauſed greater batteries and ruines, then Charles the fift his Father had done, or could do with moſt part of the Cannons of all Europe. An Impreſe, that was much commended by the ſacred Colledge of the Vertuous, it being greatly to the honor of all Writers, that a Penne in the hand of a man, who knew how to mannage it, could worke ſuch memorable effects. So mighty a King was entreated in Pernaſſus, alla grande; for euen the chiefeſt Monarchs of Chriſtendome thought it a great reputation vnto them forto be able to ſerue him, inſomuch that the day after his entry, being vnder the Barbers hand, the famous Queene of England continually held the baſon vp cloſe to his beard; and the warlike King of France, Henry the fourth, counted it a great glory vnto him to wash his

head, the vvhich he performed vvith ſuch excellent dexteritie, as if he had beene borne for the Trade, although ſome malignants haue published, that it was without Soape, and onely with very ſtrong and sharpe Lye.
            This great Monarch was preſented by all the Vertuous of Pernaſſus with ſundry Preſents of Poeſie, and other moſt elaborate Writings; the which he exchanged with much liberalitie: And to a learned perſonage, that preſented him with a moſt worthy and honeſt Diſcourſe, wherein he shewed the way, how the noble Parthenope, and the whole Kingdome of Naples, that by the robberies of Souldiers, corruption of Iudges, oppreſſions of Great-men, and by the generall ranſackings of the ravenous Vice-roys, which from Spayne are ſent thither to be fatned, is now come to vtter deſolation, may be made to returne vnto the ancient greatneſſe of his ſplendour, he gaue twenty Ducats, and conſigned the Diſcourſe to his Confeſſor; charging him to yeeld him a good account of it, as of a Worke, that was very holily written: But vnto a ſufficient Politician, that preſented him with a long Diſcourſe, howbeit cleane contrary to the former, entreating of the meanes which was to bee vſed, for afflicting the ſayd Kingdome of Naples more then now it is; & how it might be reduced to ſuch calamity and miſerie, that the generous Steed, which without Bridle and Saddle, the Seate of State doth (with ill fortune) carry for Impreſe, should patiently endure both Pack-ſaddle, and Burthens; yea, and quietly draw in the Coach too: becauſe he held that to be vnderſtandingly written, according to the true termes of good Policie, hee gaue twelue thouſand Crownes a yeere, and created him a Grande of Spayne.
            
         
         
            
            CHAP. 5. Moſt of the Princes, Common-vveales, and States of Europe, are weighed in a payre of Scales by Lorenzo Medici.
            SEeing it is apparent, that the Romane Commonweale, after the acquiſition it had made of the Empire of all Italy, could in a short time arrive to that Vniuerſall Monarchy, which is yet ſo famous to the World, and whereunto many ambitious Princes haue ſince in vaine aſpired, it hath beene a generall receiued Opinion, That that Potentate, who in State and Forces is ſuffered to grow vnto ſuch greatneſſe, that hee findeth no other Prince able to counterpoyze him, no more then the Romane Common-weale did, after it became Commander over Italy, cannot poſſibly be impeached from obtaining the Vniverſall Monarchy. Whereupon thoſe Empires and Kingdomes, which were afterwards framed out of the pieces of the Romane Monarchy, to avoyd thoſe calamities and diſſolutions, which fell vpon ſuch Potentates as were oppreſſed by the Romane Forces, out of moſt wholeſome, and almoſt diuine counſell agreed together, that every fifteenth yeere, all the Princes of Europe should aſſemble into one place; where each ones Forces should bee ſeverally weighed; and thereupon fit counterpoyze, and due mortification be given vnto him, that was found to be growen to any greatneſſe, which might be odious and dangerous to his Competitor.
            Many great Wits were from time to time preferred to that honorable charge of governing the Scales; but for an

hundreth yeres paſt or thereabout, they were managed by the Illuſtrious Houſe of Medici, and in particular by Lerenzo the Great. Which prerogatiue, although to many it ſeemed preiudiciall vnto the Maieſtie of the Popes, and prudence of the Venetian Senate, who haue alwayes watched; if not more, at leaſtwiſe equally with Lorenzo, and the Florentine Commonweale, to maintaine both in Italy and abroad, the Forces of the Potentates of Europe evenballanced, yet with a marvailous conſent of all the Hiſtorians the government of the Scales was given into the hands of Signior Lorenzo. The firſt day of August, then all the Princes and Potentates of Europe, aſſembled in Phocis, not only to meet with ſo important a buſineſſe as the perfect knowledge of their owne affaires, but that alſo of others, which in matter of State importeth much more. Whereupon, by an ancient and iuſt prerogatiue, the firſt that came to be weighed, was the Ariſtocraticall Monarchy of the Apostolicke Sea, whoſe temporall State was put into the Scale; and becauſe the weight of the laſt fifteenth yeere was but ſixe Millions of pounds, and now was found to amount vnto ſeuen & an half, every one knew, that the addition of the noble Duchie of Ferrara had cauſed that encreaſe. The next that was put into the Scale, was the State of the ſeuen Princes Electors of the Romane Empire, which by old Records appeareth to haue weighed in times paſt ſeventy Millions of pounds; but ſince, by the indiſcreet governement and courſes of many Emperours, that luſty complexion, which made it evermore redoubted, was ſo ſpoyled, that it fell into thoſe dangerous and foule infirmities, which after a long Quartane, found end in an Hecticke Fever, that hath now ſo conſumed it, as our Age beholdeth it left with nothing but

very skinne and bone. Howbeit, though it bee ſo much decreaſed in ſtate, yet the great bulke it hath of body, maketh it in shew very goodly to looke vpon; the rather, becauſe the intrinſecall imperfections are not diſcouered: for many good perſons with the ancient Titles of the Empire, and maieſticall Name of Caeſar, haue beautified it very excellently without, but when it came to bee weighed, it was found quite empty within; a feather not being ſo light, as the name of a Prince without authority is vayne: whence it is, that the Romane Empire proved ſo weake, as it weighed but 480 pounds. Then the famous Peeres of France brought vnto the Scale the flourishing and warlike French Monarchy; a ſquare of fiue hundreth and fifty Miles every way, replenished with an infinit Nobleſſe, armed on horſebacke, which not onely maintaineth peace at home, but maketh ſo great a King formidable to all the Nations of the earth; beſides a world of learned men, which adorne it; Merchandiſe and Trades which enrich it; Tillage and Husbandry, which make it plentifull, and abounding with every good thing. The ancient weight of ſo famous a Monarchy was twenty Millions of pounds; but in the laſt fifteenth yeeres weight, by reaſon of the horrible calamities, whereinto (by the diſloyalty of ſome of her Barons) she was throwen, it did not arriue to twelue Millions; howbeit now it not onely equalled, but went farre beyond the weight of the beſt ancient times; for it came to fiue and twenty Millions; a matter of ſuch marvaile to everyone, that the Spanyards got on their Spectacles, and very narrowly obſerved, whether the Weights were right or no.
            To the ancient Kinḡdome of France was added the acquiſition

of Breſſe given vp by the Duke of Savoy, which in regard it was ſo advantageous to the City of Lyons, augmented the weight of it aboue a Million. Next were the many Kingdomes of Spayne put into the Scale by the Spanish Grandes, and to the great wonder of thoſe ancient men, that could remember, how an hundreth and twenty yeres ſince, they were held in a poore and vile account, the weight amounted to twenty Millions. The Spanyards remained exceeding well ſatisfied with this weight of their Spayne: and aſſured themſelues, that with the addition of ſo many other States, they had beſides to put into the Scale, not onely to equall, but farre to exceed the fiue and twenty Millions of the French Monarchy. VVherefore inſtantly they put into the Scale the flourishing Kingdome of Naples, which every one thinking would encreaſe the weight at leaſt two Millions more; it appeareth, that then it weighed leſſe by one and an halfe: at this ſtrange accident the Spanyards being much amazed, ſayd: That either Lorenzo had vſed ſome fraud in the weighing, or that of neceſſitie the Scales were not even; becauſe it was a monſtrous thing, that the addition of matter should abate of the weight. Whereunto Lorenzo coldly anſwered; That his Scales were even; but that neither the Indiaes voyd of inhabitants, nor the Neopolitans, and Milaneſe, which were ſo farre diſtant from the Forces of Spayne, and replenished with a people, which ſo vnwillingly ſupported the command of ſtrangers, weighed any thing at all: for it was the loue and multitude of ſubiects, the fertility and vnion of States, that giue weight, and turne the Scale.
            Hereupon the Spaniards added the Dutchy of Milan into the Scale, which in like manner abated a Million of

the weight; whereat alſo the Spanyards were ſo much aſtonied, that they would not put Flanders into the Scale, fearing to receiue a greater diſtaſte and affront. Howbeit ſome ſayd, that if they had put in the Indiaes, they might haue wrought ſome good effect, but not thoſe miracles, which certaine lavish toungs have delivered; who with the ſame facility talke of Millions of Crownes that the furnace-men make of very bricke and tyle. Then came the English Lords, who put into the Scale their Kingdome, ſo much redoubted for the ſtrength of the wonderfull ſcytuation thereof; for the continued Mountaynes, which compaſſe it about ſerving for walles, made by the very powerfull hand of God in forme of bulwarks, and the Ocean for moſt profound ditches, make it a Kingdome feared, in regard of the commodity it hath to aſſayle others; and the inſuperable difficulties, which they shall finde, that offer to attempt it. The weight of this Kingdome was anſwerable to that of the laſt fifteenth yeare, which amounted to ſixteene Millions. But the English to giue more weight to their Kingdome, would haue put the Kingdome of Scotland into the Scale; when the Scottish Nobilitie with drawen ſwords in their hands oppoſed themſelues; freely proteſting, that they would never ſuffer their Country to be annexed to the Kingdome of the English; for yet fresh was the lamentable example of the miſeries of Flanders, who when she ſaw her Earles become Kings of Spayne, foolishly beleeved that shee should command over the Spanyards; whereas ſoone after, not Spayne was ſacked by the Flemmings, but Flanders by the covetous and cruell Spaniards; and that which made vp their miſerie, Charles the fifth the Emperor, and King Philip his

ſonne, by their continuall reſidence in Spayne, of Flemmings became Spanyards. The vnfortunate Flemmings by loſing their Prince, of naturall ſubiects, grew to be eſteemed ſtrangers, and men of little faith. And ſo Flanders, the naturall Country of Charles the fifth, the Patrimony of King Philip, became (according to the termes of moderne Policie) a State of fiue States, and began to be governed by ſtrangers; with thoſe jealouſies, and with thoſe oppreſſions of Cuſtomes, Taxes, Contributions, and Donatiues, as begat thoſe bad humors, thoſe ill ſatisfactions, from whence ſince hath proceeded that ciuill warre, which after an vnſpeakable profuſion of Gold, an infinite effuſion of bloud, an incredible loſſe of honour to the Flemmings, was converted into a covetous merchandiſe of the Spanyards. Therefore the Scots by ſuch lamentable miſeries haue learned, not to permit their King vpon any termes whatſoever, to abandon the Royall Seate of his ancient Kingdome, for to place it in a greater, newly fallen vnto him: in which caſe the Scots should vnder their cruell enemies the English, be ſure to ſuffer all the calamities, which inferiour Nations are wont to endure at the hands of the ſuperiour.
            Some that were preſent at this Act report, how the Spanyards told the King of England, that thoſe Scots which had ſpoken ſo arrogantly in the preſence of his Majeſtie, were to be ſeuerely chaſtiſed; to whom the King of England anſwered, That the Spaniards ought not to giue that counſell vnto others, which had proved ſo pernicious to themſelues: and thereupon hauing commanded the ſtay of weighing their Kingdome, hee aſſured his Scots, that ere long he would giue them all poſſible ſatisfaction.
            After this, the vaſt Ottoman Empire was put into the

Scale; which the laſt fifteenth yeare arrived to the ſumme of two and thirtie Millions, but now was found to be leſſe then ſixteene; the ſtrangeneſſe whereof made all the Princes very much to marvaile; and particularly the Venetians, who could not beleeue ſuch a fall; whereupon they deſired, that with more diligence it might be reweighed; and it appeared, how in that litle time running betweene the firſt and this ſecond weighing, it had fallen eight hundreth twenty and two pounds; whereby it was manifeſt, that the Ottoman Empire, heretofore ſo terrible to the world, now conſumed with luxury, covetuousneſſe, and idleneſſe, runneth headlong to his ruine, which gaue great contentment to all thoſe Princes. Nevertheles, it was obſerved by ſome of the wiſeſt there preſent, that the Spanyards were not ſo glad of it as the reſt; out of a doubt they had, that the depreſſion of the Turke, would be the exaltation of the Venetian State. Then came the Polach Senators, and put into the Scale their Kingdome, which in regard of the ſmall authoritie the King hath there, and the too much command, which the Palatines arrogate vnto themſelues, made but a poore reckoning; for it did not amount to ſix Millions of pounds, whereas in times paſt it alwayes exceeded twelue. After them, the Signory of the Councell of Tenn put into the Scale the flourishing eſtate of the Venetian Commonwealth, moſt admirable for the greatneſſe thereof, and oportunitie of ſcituation fitting for all great enterpriſes, which went beyond all expectation in the weight, for it came to eight Millions; the cauſe whereof was ſayd to be the huge maſſe of Gold, which thoſe wiſe Senators in ſo long a time of peace had gathered togither into their Treaſury. Next came the Swittzers,
               
the Griſons, and other free people of Germany, and brought their Comonweales to the Scale. How beit the Princes required, that they might be weighed each one ſeverally by it ſelfe, wherewith the Germanes were well contented, ſo that it might be done. But Lorenzo having put the Commonwealth of Baſil into the Scale, it appeared, that the greater part of the other Common weales of Germany were all ſo linked together, that it was impoſſible to ſeperate them one from another, which put a many of ambitious Princes there in a ſweate. Then the Duke of Savoy cauſed his State to be put into the Scale by his noble Knights of the Annonciata, which equalled the weight of the laſt fifteenth yeare; but Lorenzo, having added into the Scale that moſt noble prerogatiue of Title, which the ſayd Duke Charles Emanuell enioyeth of the Prime Souldyer of Italy, it was ſeene to aggravate the weight a Million foure hundreth and twenty pounds. After this, with a pompe and Maieſtie matchable to Kings, appeared the Duke of Lorraine; whoſe State, though litle, equalled the weight of great Kingdomes; and it was conſidered that it fell out to be ſo by a certaine good fortune which that Prince had, to haue his States ſo happily ſeated, that he could eaſily put the Lowe-Countreys into grievous difficulties, by impeaching the paſſage of thoſe ſuccors, which the Spaniards conduct thither out of Italy, whereby he hath growen into ſuch reputation, that to the moſt offerer he ſelleth for ready Gold the marchandiſe of that his adhering; in ſuch ſort, that after he had dreyned the Spanyards, aſmuch as any the devouteſt French Lord of the Holy League whatſoever, ſyding afterwards with the French, he knew ſo well how to change his coppy, that a King of France, ſuch as was Henry the fourth,

the great Duke of Toſcan, and the Duke of Mantoua, were glad of his allyance. And fully to make vp the Spanyards iealousye, the famous Venetian Commonwealth drew into her pay a Prince of that Houſe with ſuch affection, that if that great Lady had not made a vow of perpetuall chaſtity, and her nature (according to the cuſtome of ſome Indians,) had not bene ſtytched vp the firſt day she was borne by the Venetian Signory, moſt jelous of her honor, it was verily beleeved by many, that she would haue taken him to huſband. It was obſerved, that the Duke of Savoy envyed much the felicity of this Prince; becauſe he finding himſelfe alſo ſeated betweene the French and the Spanyards of Milan, as the Duke of Loraine was betweene the French and the Spanyards of Flanders, in ſtead of ſo many benefits, and ſo many commodities, as fell vpon the Duke of Loraine, he had received moſt cruell kickes, not onely from the French then his enemies, but from the Spanyards his friends; ſo that it was evident, the Duke of Savoy did now plainly ſee, how that practiſe of his with the Spanyard, was moſt pernicious for him. Then came the Otto di Balia, and put into the Scale the flourishing State of the Great Dukes of Tos
                  
                     ••…
                  
                which by reaſon of the excellent wits of the inhabitants, perpetuall plenty, continuall peace, and quiet ſecurity it enioyeth, anſwered in weight to many Kingdomes. Lorenzo greatly reioyced, when he ſaw how vpon the foundations of thoſe Churches and Hoſpitals, which he and his Predeceſſors in the time of the Florentine libertie had layed in their Countrey, their Succeſſors, according to the modell left them by Coſimo the Great, had afterwards found meanes to erect ſtrong Cyttadels; wherevpon Lorenzo, to make a glorious shew of the worth and

wiſedome of the Princes of his Houſe, added into the Scale the admirable vnderſtanding of Ferdinand the Great, with the exceſſiue weight whereof it was ſo overcharged, that the huge chayne whereby it hung brake in two, ſo that all went to ground. This accident of the Scales ſo broken, was an hinderance that other Italian Princes, which remayned, could not be weighed; wherevpon it was concluded, that comming, according to the ancient cuſtome, to lay all the Princes and Potentates of Italy in ballance againſt the Monarchy of Spaine, out of the vniverſall weight of the Italian Princes, each ones perticular would eaſily appeare. Into the midſt of the great Hall then was brought an huge, and even payre of Ballance, whereinto on the one part was put all the Kingdomes of the Monarchy of Spayne, and into the other all the principalities of Italy; and it was ſeene that they ſtood in equall Ballance; a matter of great trouble to all the Italian Princes: but whilſt they continued in this agony, it was noted, how the mighty French Monarchy with one only loving looke, which she gaue to that Ballance, wherein the Italian Principalities lay, made it ſuddainly to turne on that ſide. It may not be omitted, how to Spanyards ſeeing the Dukes of Savoy, who the laſt fift
                  •••…
                yeare refuſed to be weighed with the Italian Forces, 
                  〈◊〉
                to be put into the Ballance, for to counterpoyſe theirs, threatned them by biting their thumbs at them; whereof thoſe Princes being aware, with a generoſity worthy their vndaunted ſpirits, they ſay thus vnto them: Signory of Spayne, yee can no longer feed men with hopes, for now we are throughly poſſeſſed of your courſes: Yee thought to haue brought the Dukes of Savoy by the cunning of your hopes to ſuch a madneſſe, as to forgoe that

litle bread, which they had in the mouth of their State; to reach at the shadow of thoſe great inheritances of Spayne, which they ſaw in the bottome in the water. And becauſe the Spanyards complayned for that the Dukes of Parma, Modena, Vrbin, the Lords of Mirandola, and the famous Roman Barons, Gartani, Coloneſi, and Orſini, which haue the Fleece, and are in their pay, were weighed with the Italian Forces; whereas in regard of that Order, and the Penſions they receiue, they were obliged to adhere to their deſeignes, and to be the miniſters of their greatneſſe. They were anſwered by thoſe Lords, that they receiued the honors of the Fleece, and enioyed the profits of thoſe Penſions, as honorable Ladies accept of gifts from their Lovers, only in a pure way of curteſy, and not with an intent any way to forget what appertayneth to their honor.
         
         
            
            CHAP. 6. The Spanish Monarchy goeth to the Oracle at Delphos, for to know whether ever she shall attayne to the Monarchy of the world, and receiveth a contrary anſwere.
            
            YEſterday morning two houres before day, the renowned Monarchy of Spayne departed with great ſecrecy, in a Caroch of ſixe horſes from Pernaſſus, carrying along with her onely ſome few Confederates of her Court, which begate a world of jealouſie; but in particular the French Monarchy was ſo mooved, that to be aſcertained of this voyage, she preſently tooke Poſte, and following the Monarchy of Spayne, shee overtooke her iuſt as shee was entring into the Oracle of Apollo at Delphos; before whom preſenting herſelfe, by report of them that by chance were then preſent, shee made this enſuing requeſt: O eternall, and cleare Lampe of the world; thou right Eye of Heaven, that not onely bringeſt day, but every good elſe to mankind: Thou knoweſt, that for a long time together, all my thoughts haue aymed at that Vniverſall Monarchy, whereunto the Romane people onely arrived: Thou knoweſt what effuſion of bloud, what profuſion of Treaſure I haue made, to attaine vnto the end of my intent: To thee onely are knowen the watchings, the ſweat, and thoſe ſo artificiall endevours of mine which I have vſed, to bring ſo important a Deſeigne to paſſe: Thou knoweſt alſo, that by the valour of my Nation, by the dexterity of my

wit, and by the power of my money, not many yeeres ſince, at ſuch time, as I had ſowen thoſe turbulencies of ciuill warres in France, whereon I had grounded all my hopes, I was neere vnto the obtaining of my intent; nothing remaining for me to overcome all impediments, but to vnite Naples with Milan; a difficulty, which if I can once ſurmount, I may then ſecurely boaſt that I haue gotten the day: But ſeeing that either by my fatall miſfortune, or by the impoſſibility of the affayre, or by the power of ſo many cruell enemies, which declared themſelues againſt mee, the ſcandals of thoſe revolutions, which with ſuch deviſes in the ſpace of ſo long a time, I had ſowen amongſt the French, over whom yet I could never prevaile, were in one onely day converted into ſuch peace and tranquilitie, as it breaketh my heart to behold it; and that after the waſting of ſo many of my people, whom in this enterpriſe, that I haue propounded to my ſelfe, I haue almoſt reduced to vtter deſolation, I am in the end become euen the fable of the world: Therefore doe I thus preſent my ſelfe before thy Majeſtie, whom I moſt humbly beſeech, to let mee clearely vnderſtand, whether that Vniverſall Monarchy, which is ſo imprinted in my heart, and which is the only end of all my actions, bee deſtinated by the will of Heaven to me, and my Nation: and this I deſire to know, that either by the impoſſibility of the matter, I may bee conſtrayned to give it over, or by the poſſibility thereof, I may encourage my Spanyards to goe on cheerefully in their attempts: for to confeſſe the truth vnto thee, that knoweſt the ſecrets of thoughts, in regard of ſo many croſſes, which both by Sea and Land I have endured; in regard of ſo many Conſpiracies and Counterplots which

by my implacable enemies have beene contrived, and now more then ever are contrived againſt me, I beginne wholy to deſpaire and ſaint.
            After this requeſt, the Temple shooke, and the earth trembled, when from the mouth of Apollo's Miniſter came theſe words: The Vniverſall Monarchy shall returne anew to the noble Italian Nation, when it shall give over thoſe inteſtine diſcords, which have made it a ſlave to Strangers. Vpon ſo ſad an anſwere, the Monarchy of Spayne full of griefe departed out of the Temple, and much she marvailed, when shee ſaw the French Monarchy preſent her ſelfe before her; with whom having vſed her wonted Complements, shee drew her aſide, and declaring vnto her, what anſwere shee had received from the Oracle; shee informed her, that if the Vniverſall Monarchy should returne againe to the Italian Nation, France would quickly be as ſure to feele a new Iulius Caeſar, as Spayne a ſecond Scipio; and therefore to ſecure their affaires, there was no ſuch way, as to divide Italy betweene them. Shee alſo offered to teach her the ſame Receipt, which shee had ſo happily experimented in the Indiaes, wherewithall they might ſo aſſure themſelves of the Italian Nation, that there should remaine no more of that wicked race of men in the world, then the bare name. Let me firſt forget (anſwered then the French Monarchy) that vnlucky deviſion of the Kingdome of Naples, which my king Lewis the twelfth made not long ſince with you, and then we will talke of this buſineſſe: For it is not ſo eaſy a matter to wrong the French a ſecond time, as I perceiue you perſwade your ſelfe it is. As for the receipt, which (to be ſecured of the Italians) you propound vnto me, I pray you vſe it your ſelfe; for to ſpoyle the earth of

people (as you haue done in the Indiaes) and to raign over naked Countreys voyd of inhabitants, is a certaine politick Precept, which is not found in the French reaſon of State; for I haue learned to my coſt to content my ſelfe with a litle, ſo it be good; and therefore I place my greatneſſe more in the multitude of Subiects, then in the extent of Kingdomes; and ſo as my French may liue cōmodiouſly in this world, I am well pleaſed that others shall doe ſo too. Moreover, with that libertie, which is proper to my nature, I will freely tell you, that the ſubduing of all Italy, is not an enterpriſe ſo facile as you imagine; for when I was of your humor, I know how pernicious it proved to me; and therefore be warned by my experience, not to attempt that, which in the end will bring you nothing but loſſe, and diſgrace.
         
         
            
            CHAP. 7. Almanſor, ſometime King of the Moores, encountring with the Kingdome of Naples, they relate one to another the miſeries they ſuſtayne by the oppreſsion of the Spanyards.
            THe famous King of Moores, Almanſor; he that many yeares togither raigned in Spayne over the noble Realme of Granada, met yeſterday with the Kingdome of Naples, and falling in talke with him, after he had for a good ſpace obſerved the chayne, which the ſayd Kingdome of Naples wore faſtned about his legge, he told him, that the manufacture thereof being Moreſco, he verily thought that he had many times ſcene, and handled it ſome where els; and a litle while after with a shew of great marvayle he affirmed, that he knew it well; and how it was the very ſame, wherewith all both he, and the Moorish Kings his Predeceſſors had for the ſpace of ſeven hundreth yeares held many Kings of Spayne in ſervitude; and therefore he earnſtely entreated him, to let him vnderſtand, how, by whom, and when he was chayned in that manner. A very good eye, and an excellent memory haſt thou, Almanſor; (anſwered then the Kingdome of Naples) for this vnlucky chayne, which thou ſeeſt about my legge, was brought out of Spaine by Gonſalvo Corduba, called the great Captaine, and therefore it is very likely to be the ſame thou ſpeakeſt of. And now it is an hundreth yeares, ſince firſt I found my ſelfe in the miſerable ſervitude, wherein thou beholdeſt me, and from

which I know not whither ever I shall be freed; for in regard of the mighty power, whereunto I ſee the ſorces of the Spaniards arrived, having vtterly loſt all hope of aſſiſtance, that may be expected from men, I know, that my ancient libertie ſtandeth wholly in the poewrfull hand of God, who had need to renew in me the miracles of the Red-Sea, if my deliverance shall follow. The yeares (replyed Almanſor) confront well; for a litle before the time of thy ſervitude, the Spanyards vndid this my chayne from about the legge of the Kingdome of Granada, where withall afterwards they bound thee. But let it not diſpleaſe thee, O Kingdome of Naples, to declare vnto me, how it could come to paſſe, that the Spanyards should make themſelues Maſters of ſuch a Kingdome as thou art, ſo potent, and ſo farre diſtant from their Forces. By fraud Almanſor, (ſayd the Neapolitan Kingdome) did the Spanyards get into Italy, for by open force they had never beene able to make ſuch notable acqueſts; and as thou ſaydeſt well, ſo diſproportionable to their Forces, which vvere ſo farre off. But heare, and vvonder at the large and groſſe conſcience of a King of Spayne in matters of State, although he vſed much art to ſeeme vnto foolish men a very Saint; for thou shalt come vnto the knowledge of a Tragedy, according to the rules of my Chriſtian Religion, moſt vvicked and cruell; but according to the termes of moderne Policie, the moſt adviſed, that ever any Nation repreſented vpon the Stage of the vvorld. Alfonſo my King, to his vtter, and my chiefeſt ruine, gaue Iſabella his Niece (for from this vnhappy marriage did my diſplantation take beginning) to Iohn Galeazzo, Duke of Milan for vvife. The minortie firſt, and then the vnſpeakeable ſilly weakeneſſe of ſo infortunate a Prince incouraged

               Lodovico Sforza to vſurpe the State vpon his Nephew; Alfonſo, as it behoved him, ſought to hinder that Tyranny; vvhere of Lodovico being aware, and knowing, that without the ruine of my Kings, it vvas not poſſible for him to arriue vnto the end of his moſt injuſt deſire, he fell into that reſolution, vvhich afterwards both to himſelfe, to me, and to all the Princes of Italy proved ſo fatall, of drawing the French into Italy, to the conqueſt of me. My Kings to defend themſelues from ſuch mighty enemies, called to their ayde that holy ſoule of Ferdinand King of Aragon their Couſin, who shewed himſelfe ſo kind a kinſman, and ſuch a faithfull friend, that in ſtead of chaſing avvay the French enemies, he divided me with them; and to shew himſelfe compleat, a little after this vnhappy diviſion, he entred into warres againſt the French, and having overcome them, he forced them to returne full of shame, and loſſe into their countrey; vvhereupon the good King Ferdinand without any ſcruple at all of conſcience became my abſolute Lord; and then it was, that he faſtned this chayne about my legge, which thou remembreſt to be the manufacture, and worke of thy Nation. And I do not thinke, that in all the Chronicles of the Saracens, Moores, or Turks, vvhich it is likely thou haſt read, there was ever a more vvicked treachery recorded, done by a King, that deſired to be reputed a man of a good conſcience, and of an holy diſpoſition; and that a litle before had receiued of the Apoſtolicke Sea that glorious title of the moſt Catholike King. Truly (replyed Almanſor) in the Chronicles, which thou haſt named of my Nation, many foule actions cōmitted by divers Princes out of ambition to raigne, may be read, but this which thou haſt recounted of Ferdinand goeth beyond them

all. But if thou, O Almanſor, (ſayd the Kingdome of Naples) diddeſt with thy Nation keepe the Kingdome of Granada, chayned ſo many hundreth yeares, vvhat courſe tooke the Spanyards for to free him? That Vnion of the Kingdomes of Castile and Aragon (replyed Almanſor) which followed vpon the marriage between Ferdinand and Iſabella, occaſioned the libertie of the Kingdome of Granada: a moſt vnhappy Vnion, the which, no leſſe then I haue done, and continually ſtill doe, the greateſt Potentates of Europe, haue lamented, doe lament, and perpetually with vnfained teares vvill lament; as that, which is the true and onely roote, from vvhence are ſprung all thoſe greateſt ſubverſions of States, which vnto this day haue beene ſeene in many partes of Europe, but more remarkeably in Italy. And beleeue me, Neapolitan Kingdome, that even till now might I haue raigned happily in Spayne, if this peſtiferous Vnion had not overthrowen my greatneſſe; for the many jealouſies that raigned betweene the Caſtilians and Aragonians, were my inexpugnable Cittadels, which would haue maintayned my raigne here for ever. Withall aſſure thy ſelf, O Kingdome of Naples, that the aydes which the Popes gaue to Ferdinand, and Queene Iſabella, greatly accelerated my taking in. Peace, peace, Almanſor (ſaid then the Neapolitan Kingdom) for after thou wert chaced out of Spayne by the ambitious Spanish Nation, the Popes vndervvent ſuch miſeries, that it may be truly ſayd, how with ready mony they bought thoſe extreame calamities, wherewithall afterwards they encountred; for though the Sea Apoſtolicall were well contented to ſee the Moores driven out of Spaine, yet that ſatisfaction was much diſſaſted with my ſervitude, which followed preſently vpon it, the Popes having never

had any thing in greater feare, then that I should fall into the hands of a mighty Prince, vvho might make them liue in thoſe perpetuall jealouſies, vvherein finding themſelues drowned even vp to the very eyes, many of them, and particularly thoſe, that haue a greater knowledge of things of the vvorld, do not alwayes make quiet ſleepes. A cleare teſtimony of the truth which I ſpeake, was the lamentable and wicked ſacke of Rome, perpetrated by the Spanyards a litle after my ſervitude; with which ingratitude they payd the Apoſtolicke Sea for all they were debtors vnto it, aſwell for the remiſſion of the Tribute of Naples, as for the other ſuccors, which they received in the vvarre of Granada. A calamitie, that having paſt the termes of moſt grievous miſeries, hath in ſuch manner opened the eyes even of men of the drowſieſt vnderſtanding, that every one cōmeth clearely to know, what it is to vnchayne the Lyon out of a zeale of pietie; for the Spanyards no ſooner ſaw themſelues freed from the impediment of the Moores of Granada, but that through the ambition, which they shewed in deſiring to cōmand over the whole Vniverſe, not onely in Italy, but throughout all Europe, moſt important jealouſies of State, and moſt grievous intereſts of Religion diſcovered themſelues, in ſo much, that I haue often heard it diſcourſed by men of moſt vnderſtanding in affayres of the vvorld, how peradventure it would haue beene leſſe prejudiciall for many Princes of Europe, that thou haddeſt raigned ſtill in Granada, then that the Spanyards should haue paſſed into Italy, to acquire ſuch important States, as at this day they poſſeſſe there.
            Hereunto may be added the prejudices both publike and priuate, which my ruine hath brought, and continually

doth bring vnto the Italian Princes, and more particularly to the Popes, becauſe the Kings of Spayne had no ſooner faſtned this Chayne about my legge, but preſently they began to aſpire vnto the Dominion of all Italy; and the quicklier to arriue thereunto, they knew very excellently how to intereſſe themſelves in the differences, which at that time depended betweene the Princes of Italy, and the French, about the poſſeſſion of the Dutchy of Milan, wherein that top of man, Charles the fifth, carried himſelfe in ſuch ſort, that hee made himſelfe to bee knowen the worthy Nephew of his Grandfather by the Mothers ſide: for having with the Forces of the Italian Princes, chaſed the French out of Italy, inſtead of reſtoring the Sforzi to the State, as it was agreed betwixt him, and the confederate Princes, with the fraud of a thouſand Turkish quarrels pickt of purpoſe, which he well knew how to invent againſt the Sforzi, he made himſelfe abſolute Maſter of that ſo important a Dutchy. Stay, Kingdome of Naples; and making a point here, (ſayd Almanſor) ſatisfie me in this: ſeeing the noble State of Milan was fallen into the hands of the Spanyards, what hindred them from running precipitouſly to the acquiſition of all Italy? and ſeeing thy ſervitude doth manifeſt vnto the world, that the aydes and ſuccours of Princes, ſerue more for the benefite of him that giveth them, then for the profit of him that receiveth them, why would not the Italian Princes rather ſuffer, that Milan should be vnder the Dominion of the French, then by receiving ayde from the Spanyards, runne the danger of letting that Dutchy, (beeing ſo important a member of Italy) fall into the hands, as thou ſaydeſt it did, of the Kings of Spayne? The power of the Kings of

               France (anſwered the Neapolitan Kingdome) defendeth that remnant of Liberty which remaineth in Italy, from the ambition of Spaine: for thoſe glorious Kings out of the intereſt of their greatneſſe will not endure, that the Dominion of all Italy should fall into the power of the ambitious Spanish Nation, which cannot extinguish the ardent thirſt they have of commanding, neither with the Conqueſt of all the new World diſcovered by them, nor with ſo great a part which they poſſeſſe in the old.
            Beſides, the Italian Princes, who know the great perill (wherein they finde they are) of a dangerous and miſerable ſervitude, have ſo vnited themſelves together, that although they be many in number, yet make they but one Body; and the Spaniards, who haue vſed, and doe vſe all poſſible deviſes to diſ-unite them, evidently perceive, that they wash a Black-Moore.
            But touching the State of Milan, thou muſt know, how it was iudged more ſecure for the publike Liberty of Italy, that that Dutchy should fall into the power of the Spaniards, then that it should remaine in the hands of the French; who for that they were ioyning to Italy, when therein they should poſſeſſe any little part, there would haue beene manifeſt danger, that they would haue made themſelves abſolute Lords of the whole: but in the Spanyards it would fall out cleane contrary; for their Forces, albeit very great, are notwithſtanding ſo farre off, that by ſo long a tract of ſea, they could with much difficulty tranſport out of Spayne into Italy Forces, that were able to maintaine the acqueſts they had made, not that they could be ſufficient to ſubdue the whole.
            Thou ſpeakeſt the truth, (ſayd then Almanſor) but goe on, and declare vnto me the prejudices, which thy falling

into the hands of the Spaniards brought vnto the Popes. Know then, (replyed the Kingdome of Naples) that whereas before, the Popes were the terror of my Kings, now it happeneth to bee cleane otherwiſe; for they liue in a very great agony, leſt the Vnion of Milan with Naples should one day follow; to which marke, they obſerue, the Spanyards haue directed the ſcope of all their thoughts; vvhereupon the Spanyards, whoſe proper nature it is to make good vſe of the feare, vvhereinto they ſee they haue put the Princes their neighbours, haue arrogated vnto themſelves ſuch authority in the Court of Rome, that they vaunt they are the true arbitrators of all the moſt important matters, vvhich there are handled. Moreover, when the Kings of Naples were not Kings of Spayne, the Popes with every litle menace of denying the inveſtiture, obtayned of my Kings, Principalities, Dutchyes, Earldomes, and other great States in gift, buying their friendships alſo with mariages, and many other ſortes of liberalitie; but now, the feare being ceaſed, if the Popes vvil make their kinred great with titles of important States, they muſt be glad to buy them with their ready mony, and the adviſed Kings of Spayne, beſides the pretious Gold of entreaties, which at any hand they will bee ſure shall precede for a firſt payment, ſell them vnto them thoroughly ſawced. Important intereſts, and grievous diſorders are theſe (ſayd Almanſor) vvhich thou haſt recounted vnto me; but how cometh it that thou, Kingdome of Naples, which art the Magazine of Silkes, the Granary of Italy, shouldeſt goe ſo ragged, and be ſo leane? Seeing the Spanyards, that come naked out of Spayne [anſwered the Kingdome of Naples] after they haue beene three or foure dayes in my houſe, will needs cover themſelves

all over with gold, it is no marvaile if I be ſpoyled, to clothe ſo many Raggedemuffins: beſides, if thou ſaweſt the rapacitie of the Vice-roys, that to recover them ſelves are ſent vnto me, or if thou kneweſt the rapines of Secretaryes, of thouſand Officers, and other Courtiers, which they bring along with them, all thirſty of my bloud, thou wouldeſt greatly marvayle, how it were posſible, I should ſatiare the raging, and greedy ſwallow of ſo many hunger-ſtarved wretches. As for the litle flesh thou ſeeſt on my back, the Spanyards affirme, that in the booke of a certaine Florentine, who hath given rules of the cruell moderne Policie, they find written, that being a Kingdome conquered, after the manner of thoſe horſes vvhich are kept only for races, I ought to be maintayned low in the flesh.
            I but (ſayd Almanſor then) the Milaneſi how are they entreated? They alſo (replyed the Kingdome of Naples) are bathed with the water, wherewithall thou ſeeſt mee ſo wet; only this difference is betwixt vs, that in Milan are droppes, in my houſe, flouds. The true occaſion of the diverſitie of theſe entreatings is the quality of the Lombards diſpoſitions, moſt vnlike to my Neapolitans: for the Nobilitie of the State of Milan are naturally phantaſticall, free, reſolute, and farre from that vice ſo proper to my Neapolitans, of flattery, and affectation; but ſo bold and hardy, that they dare ſay, how if one only Cremoneſe ſpirit had beene found amongſt my Neapolitan Barons, it would haue hindered that ſame forced donatiue, that hath brought me to eate Bread and Onyons; the which, although with great words, it hath beene often demanded by the Spanyards in Milan, they haue beene as reſolutely anſwered, that they should take care to liue: Beſides,

the confining of the Griſons, of the Duke of Savoy, and Venetians, are the cauſe, that the Kings of Spayne proceed with more diſeretion in Milan: for when the Popes managed Armes, I my ſelfe alſo was for their occaſion greatly reſpected. But ſoft, Almanſor, yonder commeth my moſt capitall enemy Don Pedro de Toledo, wherefore I pray thee withdraw a litle; for at any hand I would not haue him take notice, that I lament my diſgraces heere vvith thee; and for this onely, vvere it for nothing els, may I tearme my ſervitude moſt wretched, in that I am forced to call this miſerable ſtate, wherein thou ſeeſt me, the happy golden Age.
         
         
            
            CHAP. 8. Sigiſmund Battor learneth the Latin tongue.
            
            YEſterday about eight of the clocke in the evening, the ordinary Poſt of Germany arrived at this Court, and brought very ioyfull newes, how Sigiſmund Battor, Prince of Tranſilvania, was growen ſo inamored of the gracefull Latine tongue, that to his great glory he ſpake, and wrote with the puritie and eloquence of the Ceſarean ſtyle; whereupon all the Vertuous earneſtly beſought Apollo, that for ſuch good newes there might be made in Pernaſſus all thoſe demonſtrations of ioy, which (to incourage Great-men to the loue of Learning) were wont to be made, when any Prince became learned: But his Maieſtie, that ſeeth into the vttermoſt ſecret of all things, denied thoſe Vertuous their requeſt, and told them, that then only there should be feaſting in Pernaſſus, when out of the freeneſſe of a noble minde, and meere election of ſtudies, not conſtrayned by any neceſſitie, Princes applyed themſelves to Learning; and that they were to know, how Prince Battor had gotten the elegant Latine tongue, neither out of ambition to shew himſelfe to bee learned, nor out of a vertuous curioſity to know many things, but onely out of neceſſitie for his reputations ſake, to correct the foolish and childish abſurditie which he committed, in Gender, Number and Caſe, at ſuch time, as in the warre of Hungary he tooke that fatall reſolution to arme himſelfe againſt the Turke, for to adhere vnto the Emperor of Germany, whom in regard of the ſtrong and lively pretenſions, which he hath to the Principali
                  •
               y of Tranſilvania, he was to haue in more horror, then ſeventy Ottoman Emperours.
         
         
            
            CHAP. 9. The Cardinall of Toledoes Summa is not admitted into the Library of Pernaſſus.
            THe illuſtrious, and reuerend Franceſco Cordova, Cardinall of Toledo, a perſonage of exemplarie life, an exquiſite Divine, and excellent Philoſopher; hee that in his owne perſon honoured the Word of God in the Pulpit more then any other Preacher whatſoever of his time, ſome few dayes ſince arrived at Pernaſſus, having beene received vpon the confines of the State, by Aleſsandro d' Ales, and Cornelio Muſſo Bishop of Bitonto, and all the way entertayned at his Majeſties charge. This honorable learned man preſented his Writings vnto the venerable Colledge of the Vertuous; and thoſe of Philoſophie were not only commended, but admired; as alſo the Commentaries compoſed by him vpon the divine paſſages of all the ſacred Writers, were received with extraordinary applauſe, and shortly after they were carried in a precious Vrne vnder a cloth of Eſtate, into the Delphicke Library, and with the name of the Author conſecrated to Eternity. Onely his Summa, although very learned, was not received by thoſe Vertuous, who freely told him, that there were ſo many Workes already of that kinde in his Majeſties Library, as ſome of them ſeemed ſuperfluous: for an infinit many of great Divines had with ſuch diligence handled matters appertayning to the conſciences of private men, that they had put the ſalvation of ſoules into comprimiſe, for the only regard of a shillings gaine: And that the world very much deſired

to ſee a complete Summa, compoſed vpon the conſciences of great Princes; a matter moſt neceſſary for the quiet of the whole Vniverſe, and altogether omitted by Divines; wherein thoſe actions of Princes should be exactly diſcourſed vpon, with which ſo often they put the world into confuſion, filling it with robberies, aſſaſſinates, and ſuch flaughters of men, that many of them blinded with the ambition to raigne vpon earth, have made rivers to runne with humane bloud.
            The Colledge of the Learned, hearing theſe particulars, ſayd, That they much deſired to have theſe Queſtions diſputed, and reſolved: Namely, whether Chriſtian pietie will admit the ſpeciall hipotheſis, which the violence of the ſword hath vſurped over others States: Whether a Principality, that by Armes, and fraud, is forceably taken from another Prince, may be held by one that hath the true feare of God: Whether that courſe of ruling a Kingdome, which is conquered onely to the end to impoverish and waſte it, that ſo it may be governed without jealouſie, may be practiſed by one that is borne in the Chriſtian Faith: Whether the exalting of Reaſon of State to ſuch an height, that it should trample vnder feet, as at this preſent it doth, all Lawes divine and humane, be not a more deteſtable and execrable Idolatry, then worshipping Nabuchadnezzars Image, or the golden Calfe. And laſtly, the Colledge ſayd, That then their deſires would be fully accomplished, when there could be found a Divine ſo much fearing God, that with his Writings durſt fright Princes as much from doing evill, as many others with their great Volumes had terrified private men; for it ſeemed a ſtrange thing vnto them, that infinite learned Divines had ſo laboured to reaſon

of the ſtrict accompt, which Shop-keepers are to render, even for idle words, vnto the Majeſtie of God, and in the meane time had omitted to make mention of thoſe exorbitant errors, committed by great Princes; when with their Armies over-running States, they ſend all things into perdition, both ſacred and prophane: And that with more benefite to mankinde, and eternall reward to themſelues, Divines might have diſcourſed vpon the actions of Lewis the twelfth, and Frances the firſt, both Kings of France; of Ferdinand King of Aragon, and Charles the fifth the Emperor, whoſe ſoules departed out of this world with the heauy burthen of halfe a million of manſlaughters, all comitted by their ambition to raigne, and whereof they were to giue a ſtrict accompt to Almighty God: All which were matters exceeding neceſſary, to the end, that mankind ſo much afflicted by the ambition of Princes, might one day receiue the conſolation, which with ſuch longing it deſireth, when thoſe that raigne, should be terrified from doing amiſſe, and be made to know, that Hell was prepared aſwell for the Great, as the ſmall.
         
         
            
            CHAP. 10. The French desire the Receipt of the Spanish Sent for Gloues.
            
            THe emulation which is ſeene to raigne betweene the two warlike and powerfull French and Spanish Nations, is as great, as it is eternall: for there is not any vertue appearing in the French, which is not exceedingly coveted by the Spanyards; neither are the French ever quyet, till they haue attayned vnto thoſe rarities, wherwithal they ſee Spayne indued. And becauſe that ſent with which Gloues are made ſo ſweet, is a particular invention and gift of the Spanyards, the French haue omitted nothing that might bring them to the perfection of making the like; and to their great charge they furnished themſelves with Muske, Ambergriece, Civet, and all other the moſt odoriferous Drugges the Eaſt produceth, but all to no purpoſe; for neither charge, nor diligence were ſufficient to make them attayne to the end of their intent; howbeit, before they vvould giue it over as deſperate, the noble French Nation had recourſe vnto his Majeſtie, the productour of all Aromatickes, vvhom they earneſtly beſought that hee vvould bee pleaſed to teach the French the vvay how to make the right Spanish ſent for ſweet Gloues. Whereupon Apollo was never ſeene to laugh more heartily at the fall of the infortunate Icarus, then hee did at the requeſt of thoſe French, whoſe hands, hee commanded his Prieſts that ſtood by him, to ſmell vnto, and tell him what they ſented of: The Prieſts immediatly obeyed, and affirmed vnto his Majeſtie, that they ſented vvell:

Which Apollo hearing, he ſayd to thoſe French, that nature alwayes vſed to countervaile a defect vvith ſome rare vertue; and that therefore the gift of making Gloues ſo ſweet, shee had only granted to that Nation, whoſe hands ſtunke moſt abhominable.
         
         
            CHAP. 11. The Monarchy of Spayne throvveth her Phiſitian out of the window.
            
            THis morning the Monarchy of Spayne hauing ſent for her ordinary Phiſitian, a litle after with her owne hands she threw him out of the window of her Royall Pallace, whereupon the poore wretch, being all battered in pieces, died incontinently. An accident that ſeemed the more ſtrange, in regard the Phiſitian was held by all the Court to be a man of extraordinary honeſtie, and in the practiſe of his profeſſion moſt admirable. Sundry were the diſcourſes, that were made vpon ſo remarkeable a matter. But Apollo deſiring to know of the Spanish Monarchy her ſelfe the true cauſe of ſo grievous a reſentment, that mighty Queene told him, how aboue forty yeares ſince, vpon occaſion of ſome accidents that befell her, and other ſignes, which she had diſcouered, she feared that in proceſſe of time, she should catch ſome dangerous French diſeaſe from the Royall Houſe of Burbon, and therefore; to provide for the inconvenience which shee foreſaw, she had demanded counſell of her Phiſitian, who preſcribed her a long,

faſhidious, and chargeable purgation, compounded of divers Oyles of Holy Leagues, of inſurrections of people, of rebellions of Nobilitie, of Cauteries, and other very bitter ingredients, whereby she had ſpoiled her ſtomach, weakned her ſtrength, and altogether loſt her appetite; and that the infinite quantitie of Syrrupes, and the many medicines which she had taken with ſuch anguish, had wrought no other effect, but the accelleration of the diſeaſe, which without that vnlucky and vnſeaſonable purgation peradventure she shold neuer haue had: Moreouer, that the many Leaches which were applied to many parts of her body, had in ſuch manner ſucked the beſt vitall bloud of the Gold of that Spayne, that thorough the weakneſſe of her complexion, she was not able to euacuate thoſe evill humors of Flanders, which had held her, and doe hold her oppreſſed. By which diſorders, all occaſioned through the naughty counſell of that imprudent Phyſitian, she was ſo exaſperated againſt him, that she had ſolemnely ſworne to throw him out of the window, if to free her from future infirmities, he euer after ordained her any purgation; And that perceiving, how the paine which she hath at this inſtant in the shoulder of Holland, vvas an apparent Lues Gallica, she had demanded counſell of the ſame Phyſitian for to cleare her ſelfe of it; who vnmindfull of his former errors, had foolishly ordayned the ſecond purgation, wholly and altogether like the former, and that therefore being ouercome with paine, she had throwen him out of the Window; ſo punishing him at once for both the faults he had committed: for it ſeemed vnto her, that he had well deſerved the misfortune of that reſentment, ſeeing that by the accidents following, with ſuch infelicitie of her

               Spanyards, he had not learned to know, that purgations made before their time for diſeaſes that are feared, doe not worke thoſe good effects, which either the Phyſitian beleeveth, or the Patient deſireth.
         
         
            CHAP. 12. Moſt of the States of the World are cenſured in Pernaſſus for their errors.
            
            
               APollo carefull of nothing more, then to ſee that the Princes of the World, should in the vpright gouernment of their States, giue the people ſuch ſatisfaction as they ought, introduced into Pernaſſus (many ages ſince) this admirable Cuſtome: That euerie yeare, the names of the chiefeſt Potentates of the earth, written vpon litle ſchedules, should be put into an Vrne, and then being drawen foorth one by one, the publicke Cenſor of Politicall matters should (in the preſence of the ſacred Colledge of the Learned) record the diſorders, which he had obſerued in the gouernment of their States; whereupon thoſe Princes were bound either incontinently with ſatisfying reaſons to defend ſuch things as were obiected againſt them, or els within a Moneth to reforme them.
            An inſtitution no doubt very noble, and holy; for it hath effected, that in the progreſſe of ſo many ages, ſince firſt it was vſed, Princes haue corrected an infinitie of errors: beſides, knowing that they are to be called to ſo ſtrict an accompt, it maketh them endeuour to liue ſo

vertuouſly, that in the preſence of ſo many Princes they need not to blush. Vpon the day appointed then, moſt of the Potentates of the World appeared before Apollo: And Count Baldazar Castiglione the Politicall Cenſor, ſaid vnto the reuerend Lord Giouanni dalla Caſa, Nuntio for the Sea Apoſtolicall in this State, which was firſt drawen out of the Vrne; That it ſeemed vnto him a moſt ſcandalous matter, and indeed vnworthy the Greatneſſe, and Maieſtie of the Popes, that in Rome should be ſeene ſome potent Families, vnto whom it ſerved in ſtead of a rich patrimony to be dependant on forraigne Princes, not very well affected to the greatneſſe of the Apoſtolicke Sea, which in euery occaſion were apt with the power of their Factions to giue the Popes much trouble; And that he might truly ſay, how in all his time he had not ſeene a more foule and execrable thing, then that which the Emperor Charles the fifth did, when with the noble Charge of the Kingdome of Naples he rewarded the cruell ſeditions, and shamefull treacheries, which the Cardinall Pompeo Colonna vſed againſt the High Bishop Clement the ſeuenth. Then the Lord Giouanni demanded of the Count, how long it was, ſince he had conuerſed in the Romane Court; who anſwering, Some ſeuenty yeares paſt: the Nuntio replied, that returning thither now, he should find, how by reaſon of the abundance of vertjuice, which the Pompei, Pabritij, Proſperi, Aſcanij of the family of Colonna; the Virginij, and other more principall Barons of the Houſe of Orſina had eaten; the teeth of their Nephewes, and Grand-children were ſo ſet on edge, that they could hardly chaw ther broth: for the Popes which had tyed thoſe exorbitances about their fingers, knew ſo excellently how to practiſe the Tarquinian precept,

that they haue reduced thoſe Poppies, which heretofore were as high as Cedars, to the humble ſtature of ridiculous dwarffes.
            This anſwere ſatisfied the Count, who turning to the Romane Empire, next diawen out of the Vrne, he ſaid vnto him, That the preſent diſorders, which were ſeene not only in the great patrimony of the Houſe of Austria, but in all Germany, proceeded from the negligence of the preſent Emperor Rodolphus, and therefore he much deſired, that that Maieſtie would with more care embrace the government of his ſo many States; remembring, that Princes, rulers of mankinde, bore vpon their shoulders the heauieſt weight, and had in their hands the moſt laborious worke, that any the painefulleſt day-labourer whatſoeuer could exerciſe. The Cenſor vvas exceedingly thanked by the Romane Empire for this aduiſe; whereunto with much grauitie he answered, That it was a diſgrace common with all Princes, to be accuſed of negligence, when ſcandals aroſe in their States, although it notoriouſly appeared, that in regard they were occaſioned by the practiſes of more mighty enemies, they could not poſſibly be avoyded by an vnderſtanding Prince.
            Wherefore it was to be conſidered, That the monſtrous felicities, which the moſt mighty Houſe of Auſtria haue had by inheriting with their Matches, the States of Flanders, the Kingdomes of Spaine, of Naples, Sicilia, Bohemia, Hungarie, and Portugall, haue giuen all the Princes of Germany, of Italy, and of Europe ſuch diabolicall jealouſies, that they haue cauſed both the paſſed and preſent ruines, now beheld in their ancient patrimony: Whereunto the Emperors, which haue raigned ſince Maximilian the firſt of famous memory, albeit they were reputed

moſt valorous & prudent princes, could neuer after apply any ſalue, that did not infinitely exaſperate the ſore of the diſorders of Germany, wherein had concurred ſuch abundance of malignant humors, that it might truly be ſaid, it was immedicable. Further, it was to be remembred, what ſmall authoritie, the moderne Emperors haue had in Germany, ſo that it were not only a diſcurteſie, but open injuſtice to will one, that hath his hands faſt bound behind him, to performe the acts of Orlando. Moreouer, the qualitie of the Empire was to be regarded, which being electiue, they that ſerued, had more authoritie in it, then they that commanded. Beſides, the preſent weaknes of the Houſe of Auſtria in Germany, from whom (with the ſeditions of Religion) the hearts of their ſubiects are ſtollen; a theft ſo important, that they may well abandon thoſe States as loſt, wherein ſuch dangerous ſeed is ſowen. Wherupon the preſent Emperor ſeeing himſelfe depriued of the obedience of his ſubiects, deſireth euery one to reflect vpon the qualitie of the Couſins, which the Houſe of Auſtria hath in Spayne, and they shall finde, that the people of Almaine borne for their libertie, to ſecure themſelues from the monſtrous power of ſuch a Family, take impious and wrongfull reuenges euen on thoſe, which shall not be free from the ſervitude of the Spanyards, if for the ſinnes of men they euer arriue to that point of commanding ouer the World; from which (by the meere goodnes and mercy of God they are put off as farre, as by their many deuiſes they haue labored to come neere it. That alſo it was to be thought vpon, how the firſt that in Italy, and abroad, diſinherited with all kind of irreuerence, and diſreſpect the Majeſtie of the Empire, were thoſe their Couſins of Spayne, as

clearely appeared by the vſurpation of Finale, and other Imperiall feudes by them poſſeſſed. All which things, moouing dangerous humors without diſſolving them afterwards, do cauſe the Houſe of Auſtria in Germany, to be cruelly ſcourged by moſt powerfull enemies, whilſt the Spaniards with their only menaces ſeeke to put the whole vvorld into ſuſpition and diſtaſte. And for concluſion, he deſired all the ſacred Colledge to conſider, that to the miſerable ſterilitie of children, which is ſeene in the preſent Emperor, is adioyned a lamentable fertilitie of brethren; one of which incited by the moſt violent ſpurre of ambition, hath not doubted at laſt to goe about to ouerthrow his owne Houſe, vvhich is ready to fall. All accidents ſo vnhappy, that they vvould make euen Salomon himſelfe ſeeme to the World a very foole.
            Theſe replies, which to all the Aſſiſtants ſeemed very vveighty, ſatisfied the Cenſor, vvho turning him to the vvarlike French Monarchy, ſaid vnto her, How all the Vertuous of Pernaſſus much deſired of her, that she vvould rule the furious, vnquiet, capricious, and exceeding impetuous diſpoſitions of her French, reducing them to thoſe termes of prudence, adviſedneſſe, and ſtayedneſſe of minde, which are ſeene in the noble Italian, and Spanish Nations; & how it much blemished her reputation, that the Kingdome of France, which holdeth a firſt place amongſt the moſt principall Monarchies of the World, should be inhabited by men ſo infinitely rash. To this aduert ſement the French Monarchy replied, That the Cenſor not well informed of the intereſts of her Kingdome, had cenſured for defects the chiefeſt vertues, vvhich she loued in her French. Folly, lightneſſe, vnaduiſedneſſe, and a precipitous nature were they, which had made her ſo

feared, and formidable a Queene, becauſe her French with vnſpeakeable alacritie and forwardneſſe, would vpon the leaſt nodde of hers, expoſe themſelues to thoſe perils, whereunto other Princes could not with the rope, the cudgell, and the cruelleſt kinds of punishment compell their wiſe, aduiſed, and circumſpect ſubiects: And that in the many warres, which she had held with moſt valorous Nations, she had learned to know, how an army framed of ſouldiers, which had litle braine, and much courage, ſo that they are ledde by a valiant, and diſcreet Generall, doth carry away the victorie from thoſe people, who profeſſe more circumſpection, and wiſedome. This anſwere of the Monarchy of France, was ſo much the more commended of Caſtiglione, by how much, regarding the qualitie of a mighty Kingdome, he knew that the French poſſeſſed all thoſe endowments and vertues, vvhich vvere requiſite in a Nation, for to found, amplify, and maintayne a great Empire.
            Then the Cenſor turning to the powerfull Monarchy of Spayne, ſayd vnto her, how it vvas evident, nothing gaue greater ſatisfaction to all people in generall, but more particularly to thoſe which were ſubject to ſtrange Nations, then the humanitie, and affable cariage of ſuch as governed them; whereas she ſending to the governments of Naples, Milan, and Sicilia, none but her owne Spanyards, they with their ordinary Caſtilian ſtatelineſſe, and inſupportable Spanish pride, without all compariſon farre exceeding that, which the Kings of Spayne themſelves either could, or would haue vſed in thoſe States, did ſo exaſperate even their good and faithfull ſubjects, that the Spanish Dominion was growen infinitely odious: And that further, both in vveighty, and ſleight affayres he deſired

more quicke expeditions from her, ſeeing that by her too much delay, and perplexitie in the deliberation of important matters, shee had loſt many fayre occaſions, that had preſented themſelves vnto her, for the enlarging of her Empire. The Monarchy of Spayne, very much thanked the Cenſor for the advertiſements he had given her, and in her excuſe anſwered, how that honorable Gentleman, which had a young vvife, beyond all expresſion fayre, but of a diſpoſition enclyned to laſciviouſneſſe, should shew himſelfe very diſcreet, if he deſired, that a proper handſome ſervant, whom he kept in his houſe, should bee rather extreamely hated, then any whit affected by his wife: and that vnto the delay in the reſolution of her affayres, which she knew to be virious and prejudiciall, it lay not in her power to give remedy: for almighty God having not without important occaſions created her Spaniards wholly, and altogether quite different in diſpoſition from the French, vvhilſt they in the deliberation of buſineſſes were rather precipitous, then executive, she in her beeing ſo ſlow, and irreſolute, obeyed the will of God, vvho would haue it ſo.
            The next drawen out of the Vrne vvas the Monarchy of Poland; vnto vvhom Count Baldaſar ſayd, How all the Princes of Europe could haue vvished, that the preſent King Sigiſmond had vſed towards thoſe ſeditious Nobles, which laſt rebelled againſt him, ſome ſeveritie worthy ſo grievous a fault, onely to the end, that by their example, other Lords might have beene deterred from committing the like. To this the Polach Monarchy anſwered, That thoſe chaſtiſements giuen to the Nobility, which in an hereditarie State would be commodious, haue alwayes prooved in her electiue Kingdome prejudiciall:

And how that Kingdome, which another receiueth in gift from a Nobility, in whoſe power is the election of the King, cannot without evident perill of falling from his greatneſſe, be governed with that rigour, vvhich in other hereditarie States is neceſſary; for that Senate, which out of an election of love giveth another a Kingdome, if it be provoked by the powerfull paſſion of hate, knoweth alſo how to re-aſſume it, in regard welladviſed Senators are vvont to reſerve vnto themſelves thoſe neceſſary inſtruments, vvhereby vpon every occaſion of evill ſatisfaction, they may recall their vſed liberalitie: And that the preſent King Sigiſmond beeing the firſt of his Houſe, vvhich had raigned in Poland, he vvas to direct the ayme of all his thoughts to no other ſcope ſo much, as by an extraordinary indulgence to vvinne the hearts of the Nobilitie of his State, that ſo vvith a gratefull memorie of his clemency, he might perpetuate the ſucceſſion of ſuch a Kingdome in his Bloud. An advertiſement, moſt neceſſary for Sigiſmond his King, by reaſon the Polachs, although their King be electiue, do neuer defraud the Royall Bloud of the ſucceſſion, if he that raigneth, can tell how to get the generall loue of the Nobilitie. For the Polonians being a Nation, that know not how to liue in an abſolute libertie, do ſo abhorre all manner of ſervitude, that that King among them (a matter common to all electiue Princes) shalbe moſt oculatiue, and vigilant in the matters of his State, that leaſt ſeemeth either to ſee or know any thing. Not only the Cenſor, but the whole Colledge of the Vertuous, admitted the juſtification of the Polach Monarchy for excellent.
            Hereupon, the Count turning hemſelfe to the vaſt

               Ottoman Empire, ſaid vnto him, That the crueltie, which he vſed, onely vpon light ſuſpitions, againſt his chiefeſt miniſters, was held by all the world to bee a bloudy courſe; it being a received opinion, that men of extraordinary valour and merit, should not be layd hands on, but for great and prooved offences: And that when the Ottoman Princes did even juſtly take away the lives of their miniſters, the cuſtome of ſeizing vpon their Eſtates to their owne vſe, and thereof vtterly depriving the children, did ſcandalize all good juſtice, becauſe it ſeemed, that with ſuch cruell rigour, the Eſtates, rather then the faults of the delinquents, were hunted after. To this ſo open a correction, the Ottoman Empire anſwered with admirable gravity, That hee was growen to that greatneſſe wherein hee was ſeene, by the onely two moſt powerfull meanes of reward without meaſure, and punishment vvithout end: And that the ſole foundation of he quiet of every State, being placed in the fidelity of the moſt important miniſters, Princes were not to ſeeke any thing with more care, then with immenſe rewards to allure them vnto faithfulneſſe, and vvith infinite punishments to terrifie them from trecheries: That thoſe miniſters vvhich have in their power the Forces, Command, and Governments of States, not beeing able to er
                  •
               e, but in moſt important matters, it vvere the counſell of a foolish Prince, vpon ſuſpitions of that moment to arraigne, accuſe, and heare the juſtifications of the offendor; but in ſuch a caſe, the Prince which will runne no danger, ought to indevour to ſurpriſe his miniſter vpon the ſudden, and to deale ſo ſecurely, that the execution of the punishment may precede even the accuſation itſelfe: That many times it had fallen out, that

he with a ſuddaine chaſtiſement had preuented the conſummation of moſt foule treaſons: Which reſolution, though he acknowledged to be moſt ſeuere, yet he knew it had ſo wrought, that there vvere neuer ſeene in his State any Counts St Paul, Princes of Orange, Dukes of Guiſe, d' Aumale, du Maine, de Mercure, and other foule monſters of diſloyaltie, vvhich, vvith the shame of thoſe Princes, that vvith halters, poynards, and axes knew not how to preuent ſuch dangerous offences, haue beene ſeene otherwhere: It being a rule in matters of State as common, as ſecure, That that miniſter, which giveth to his Prince the leaſt shadow of ſuſpicion of his faith, incurreth a capitall paine, becauſe thoſe Captaines which haue the care of Armies in their power, are bound, like the wives of Honorable perſonages, to liue with ſuch puritie of minde, that they be free not only from blame, but from the leaſt ſuſpicion of a blame-worthy thought. That touching the ſeazure of his Baſshawes eſtates after their death, he thought he might truly ſay, that the entertainements, gifts, and wealth, wherewithall other Princes rewarded their miniſters, in compariſon of thoſe inexhauſtible riches which he beſtowed on his well-deſeruing Officers, were vile, and poore, as thoſe Royall Treaſures, which Ruften, Mahomet, Ibrahin, and infinite others left behinde them after their deceaſe, haue fully teſtified: That the greateſt regard, which a Prince ought to haue in rewarding his miniſters, conſiſteth in prouiding, that the vnmeaſurable riches, wherewith he bought of them infinite fidelitie, may not poſſibly at any time be conuerted to the prejudice of him, that vſed the liberalitie: That from the grieuous diſorders fallen out in the States of other Potentates he had found it to be a

matter moſt pernicious vnto Princes, that the extraordinary riches left by a deſeruing miniſter should paſſe vnto his children, not hauing firſt deſerved it (by their vertue, valour, and fathers ſaid fidelitie) of the Prince: That he had not out of couetouſneſſe, as many miſjudged, confiſcated the great inheritances of his Baſshawes, but that by the cōmoditie thereof, thoſe ſubjects should not be idle, & conſequently vicious, which being deſcended of fathers of notable valour, gaue the Prince aſſured hope they would imitate the vertues of their Progenitors: That the gate of his Treaſure ſtood perpetually open to the heyres of his miniſters, to reſtore them their fathers enheritances twice doubled, when they with their fidelitie, and valour should deſerue them; and how much the riches of men vicious, and ſubject to ambition were apt to diſturbe the peace of any Kingdome how great ſoeuer, well appeared by the fresh examples, which he had ſeene both in France and Flanders.
            
            Whilſt the Ottoman Empire ſpake in this manner, he obſerued that the renowned French Monarchy with the shaking of her head, ſeemed to declare, that she no way approued thoſe reaſons, whereupon ſomewhat the more moued, he ſaid thus: Mighty Queene, my cuſtome in ſeizing vpon the eſtates of my Baſshawes, is profitable for the greatneſſe, and quiet of my State; and in regard of the friendship that is betwixt vs, I would to God, the ſame courſe were obſerued in your France; for you know full well, to what vſe Henry the Duke of Guize conuerted the exceeding riches, wherewithall the liberall Kings Francis the firſt, and Henry the ſecond rewarded the merits of Duke Francis his father. You, and I, and all thoſe that raigne do know, how the ſweeteſt bayte that can allure

men, is a Crowne, and there beeing no man, which for to taſte neuer ſo litle of it, but would hold it a great pleaſure for to expoſe euen his life to manifeſt danger of loſing it, Princes ought to be moſt vigilant in keeping with extreameſt ſeveritie the paſſages thereunto cloſed vp againſt all men: nay, they ought to accomodate their aff
                  •••
               es in ſuch ſort, that no priuate man whatſouer should once hope to taſte of ſo ſweet a thing: And I tell you freely, that if your Duke of Guize had in my State but only thought that, which with ſuch publike ſcandall he boldly put in execution in your Kingdome of France, I wold the very firſt day haue given him that blow, whervnto your King Henry the third, although hee were incited vnto it by the greater part of the Princes of Italy, could neuer be drawen, vntill the very laſt hower of his shamefull diſgraces, and euen at that inſtant, when the ſore of the French vprores vvas become an incurable vlcer; for where ambition raigneth among Nobles, Princes are conſtrained to shew themſelues all ſeveritie, continually keeping ſcaffalds in readineſſe, and prepared, to punish the ſeditious, and rebellious; and their Treaſury open, to reward the quiet, and the loyall; that Prince beeing vnworthy to command, that hath not the vnderſtanding how to make himſelfe be obeyed; neither can there be a more ſcandalous matter ſeene, or met withall in a State, then that the Prince should liue in jealouſy of an Officer, which ought to tremble before him. But it is the propertie of you the Princes of Chriſtendome, making profeſſion of Learning, and directing your ſelues by rules of Policie, to call me Barbarous, and my ſecure way of proceeding, Tyrannicall, whilſt in the meane time yee ſuffer your ſelues to be reduced by your heroicall

vertues of clemency, and gentleneſſe, to shamefull termes of enduring vnworthy things.
            It is not poſſible to deliver, how much the Ottoman Empire offended all the Vertuous of the ſacred Colledge with his diſcourſe, who ſtanding vp, told him in great diſdaine, how they could proove vvith preſent reaſons, that all which he had ſaid, were moſt wicked conceipts, vnworthy to be ſpoken by any perſon that had a ſoule, or to be heard of men, that made profeſſion of honour. Whereunto the Ottoman Empire anſwered ſmiling, That others in the gouernment of Kingdomes might haue regard to Vertue, and I know not what, but for his part he would neuer be perſwaded, but that the quiet and peace of States ought to be preferred before all other humane intereſts whatſoeuer.
            Then the Cenſor, to cut off ſo odious a diſpute, turning to the great Dutchy of Moſcovy, ſaid vnto him, That the moſt noble prerogatiue of raigning ouer people, which vvere louers of Learning, and excellently Vertuous, vvas the ſecond amongſt the greatneſſes of a Prince: Whereas hee by ſo endevouring to bring vp his ſubjects in a groſſe ignorance, reaped no ſmall blame, if not much diſreputation; becauſe euery one skorned him, for that, expelling the famous liberall Arts out of his State, he had only permitted his people to learne the benefite of vvriting and reading. To this Cenſure the Dutchy of Moſcovy answered, That the dreadfull fire, vvhich he had obſerued, Learning had euer kindled in thoſe States, where it had beene admitted, had made him reſolue not to ſuffer in any ſort, that ſo ſcandalous a a Cockle should be ſowed in his Dutchy; for men beeing the heards of Princes, as sheepe the flocks of priuate perſons,

it vvere extreame folly to arme thoſe gentle sheepe their ſubjects with the malice, which Learning engrafteth into their diſpoſitions, that attaine vnto it; whereas otherwiſe, in regard of that harmeleſſe ſimplicitie, wherewith Almighty God hath creared them, they may be comodiouſly ruled and gouerned, be they never ſo many in number, by one Prince alone: And how he held for infallible truth, that if the Germanes, and Hollanders had beene maintained by their Princes in the ſimplicitie of their ancient ignorance, and withall it had beene prohibited, that the pure minde of thoſe Nations might not haue beene contaminated with the plague of Greeke and Latin learning, without all doubt they had neuer had the judgement, with ſuch a ruine of their old religion, and deſtruction of many Princes, that before ruled ouer thoſe Prouinces, to know how to frame thoſe perfect formes of Commonweales in their Countries, wherevnto neither the vvit of Solon, the vviſedome of Plato, nor all the Philoſophy of Ariſtotle could euer arriue.
            This anſwere ſo mooued the Cenſor, and all the ſacred Colledge of the Learned, that with threatning lookes they ſaid, how the reaſons alledged by the Great Dutchy of Moſcouy, were open blaſphemies; and it ſeemed the Learned were ready to make good their vvords with deeds, when the greater part of the mightieſt Monarchies were ſeene to betake themſelues to their vveapons, for defence of the Moſcouite; vvho growing more audacious vpon the forward aſſiſtance of ſo many Potentates, boldly ſaid, If any one would deny, that Learning did not infinitly diſturbe the quiet, and good gouernment of States; and that a Prince might not with more facilitie rule a million of ignorants, then an hundreth learned,

that were made to command, and not to obey, he lied in his throate. The Vertuous vpon this daring defiance grew extremely incenſed, and ſtoutly replied, That the Moſcovite had ſpoken with an inſolence, worthy of an ignorant, and how they could alſo proue vnto him, that men without Learning were aſſes and calues with two legges.
            Now were they almoſt ready to goe together by the eares, when the Cenſor cryed out, Forbeare, and carry due reſpect to this place, where we are aſſembled to amend diſorders, and not to commit ſcandals; vvhereupon ſuch vvas the reuerence euery one bare to the Maieſtie of the Cenſor, that both the Princes, and the Learned, although they were tranſported with anger and diſdaine, became ſuddainly pacified.
            All being quiet, then the Cenſor ſaid vnto the famous Venetian Libertie, which next was drawen out of the Vrne, That the hardeſt matter to be found in an Ariſtocracie, as she well knew, was to reſtraine the young Nobilitie, who vvith their licentiousneſſe diſtaſting the better ſort of Citizens, had many times occaſioned the ruine of moſt famous Commonweales; And that he to his great griefe had heard, how the young Nobilitie of Venice vvith their proud demeanour had offended many honorable Citizens of that State; who exceedingly complained, that vvhilſt the inſolency of the Nobilitie encreaſed, the chaſtiſements for it decreaſed; And that therefore he remembred her, that it vvas a dangerous point in an Ariſtocracie, when thoſe vvhich vvere to glory for that they were farre from thoſe dangers, vvherunto ſuch are ſubiect, as are to obey the humor of a Prince, be heard to complaine, that they are oppreſſed by many Tyrants. Hereunto the Venetian Libertie anſwered,

That the diſorder recounted by the Cenſor vvas true, and vvithall dangerous; but that the authoritie of commanding, vvas ſo annexed to pride and inſolencie, that they ſeemed to be borne both at one birth: And that the licentiouſneſſe, vvhich the Nobilitie of all Ariſtocracies vſeth towards the Citizens, vvas by all the greateſt men, that haue diſcourſed of Commonweales, reputed a deſperate cure; for although it vvas moſt neceſſary, that inſolencies should be reſtrained vvith ſeuere paines, yet on the other ſide, an Ariſtocracie vvas to abſtaine as much as poſſibly might be from publike punishments of Noble men, albeit ſeditious; to the end that their shamefull ſuffering might not be an occaſion to diſinherit the vvhole Nobilitie it ſelfe of that reſpect vvhich is due to them from the people; for hauing the gouernment of the State in their hands, the intereſt of the publike conſervation thereof requireth, that they be held in higheſt reputation: And although in her Venice, diſobedient, and inſolent Noblemen vvere not ſeene to be ſo often punished, betweene the two pillars in the Piazza of St. Marke, as it ſeemeth many deſired, yet by the great Councell, the Pregadi, the Colledge, and other ſupremer Magiſtrates, that diſpence the publike Charges, thoſe ſeditious Noblemen, vvhich vvere diſcovered to carry a tyrannicall, mind, were cruelly afflicted vvith the torment of shamefull repulſes: And that many ſubiects of moſt noble Houſes are ſeene in Venice, vvhoſe ancient reputation for their demerits vvas maymed by Arquebuſes charged vvith bullets of paper; and that beeing ſtrucken downe vvith ſuch kinde of shot, they could neuer riſe ſince to honors and dignities; things vvherein conſiſteth the life of the Noblemen of

an Ariſtocracie: And that to excruciate a body, a greater torture could not be deviſed, no not by Perillus himſelfe, then that vvhich once a Nobleman of Venice experienced, vvhen in a concurrence of the Honorableſt Charges, he ſaw one younger then himſelfe paſſe before him, only becauſe he vvas knowen to the Senate to be more deſeruing. Caſtiglione did not only admit the juſtification of the Venctian Libertie, but alſo did infinitely commend the circumſpection, and ſeveritie, which she vſed in punishing her Nobilitie vpon occaſion of any demerit, or defect.
            Then the Cenſor ſaid vnto the Dutchy of Savoy, That his State beeing ſeated in the Confines of France and Italy, he vvas neceſſited with all carefulneſſe to maintaine himſelfe neutrall betweene thoſe Princes, vvith whom he confined; but in thoſe laſt rumors of France, by diſcovering himſelfe openly to be wholly Spanish, he had put, not only his owne, but the States of all the Princes of Italie in great trouble: And that whilſt vvith the bellowes of his forces he blew the fire of the French vprores, kindled by the Spanyards ambition, he ought to beleeve, that that flame vvas to burne vp friends and kin

               ed, before ever it could get to the other Italian Potentates that vvere enemies. The Dutchy of Savoy anſwered the Cenſor very readily, That the adherence of his laſt Duke to the Spaniards, vvas true, but the faire occaſion he had of three ſeuens in his hand, euen forced him to ſet vp his reſt, hoping to encounter the moſt famous Primiera, that euer any other Prince vvhatſoever had at Cards; to vvhich venture he vvas the rather carried, becauſe he vvas aſſored he could loſe but that mony, which at that game he had wonne before: That afterwards, though by

his ill luck the fourth Card, vvhich was dealt him, proued to be a Coa
                  •
               e of affront, vvherewith he had made the vvorſt hit, that could be encountred on the whole packe of Cards, neuertheleſſe he knew, that the braueſt mindes vvould confeſſe, that albeit the reſolution was very dangerous, yet not to vvrong the Cards, they vvould haue played no otherwiſe themſelues. The Cenſor apprehending the Metaphor, very much commended the magnanimous reſolution of that Duke; vvho, for that he might from a ſmall feaver haue received in gift the Empire of the greater part of the World, not only without any note of imprudence, but to his infinite glory, at ſuch time as ſo reſolutely he caſt the Dye of all the greatneſſe of his fortune vpon the table of Chance, he might well ſpeake thoſe famous vvords anew, Or Caeſar, or nothing.
            
            Then the Cenſor turned him to the noble Great Dutchy of Toſcan, and sharpely reprehending him, for going vvith his Galleys, at it vvere prouoking of Waſpes, he recorded vnto him, the miſerie and calamities, vvhich the Kinghts of St. Iohn ſuffered at Rhodes, at Tripoli, and the great danger, that laſtly they ranne at Malta, only becauſe they vvould imprudently haue tyed ſquibbes to the Buls taile; And that euery vviſe Chriſtian Prince ought rather to favour the preſent careleſneſe of the Turks, then to waken them with injuries of litle profit; nay, ſuch as brought others much damage, and neceſſite them to apply their mindes anew vnto maritime affaires, which in theſe times they had euen abandoned: Alſo he remembred him, how infinite people daily complained, for that, by his hindering Italy of the trade of the commodities of the Levant, all Drugges, that came from beyond

the Seas, were growen to an exceſſive rate. To this correction the great Dutchy of Toſcan anſwered, That the power of a Prince could not be termed perfect, which with a number of armed Veſſels had not ſome Dominion on the Sea: And that his Gallies vvere not only very neceſſary for the Toſcan greatneſſe, but alſo for the ſecuritie of the Libertie of all Italy, as ſcruing for a Schoole of Mariners, for a Seminary of Captaines, and ſouldiers at Sea: That he confeſſed the dammage, which they did to the trade of merchandiſe, but vvithall, he deſired it might be conſidered, that the myſterie of Warre, either by Land, or Sea, could not be learned by ſouldiers, nor exerciſed by Princes without prejudice to others: And that Toſcan breeding much filthineſſe of fantaſticall vnquiet braines, and extravagant humors, he had therefore great occaſion for thoſe Gallies, that might ſerve, as it were, to carry forth all the filth of his State, and thereby keepe it cleane, employing ſuch only for gally-ſlaues in them, as had done euill before, and that in regard of their vnquiet nature, vvere like to doe worſe after.
            This excuſe of the Great Dutchy of Toſcan vvas approved both by the Cenſor, and all the ſacred Colledge. Whereupon the Count ſaid vnto the Libertie of Genoua, vvho was laſt drawen out of the Vrne, That the exceſſiue vſe of exchanges, which she permitted vnto her Nobilitie, cauſed that great diſorder of enriching the priuate, and vvithall of empouerishing the publike, vvhoſe revennues vvould haue riſen to huge ſummes of Gold, if the reall riches of her Nobilitie had beene employed in a juſt trade of merchandiſe.
            The Genoueſe Libertie with a readineſſe, that gaue a particular guſt to all the Learned, anſwered, How it was

true, that exchanges doe vvorke that effect, vvhich the Cenſor had mentioned, and therefore vvere moſt pernicious in any Monarchy vvhatſoeuer; howbeit that notwithſtanding they might be permitted in a well-ordered Commonwealth vvithout any prejudice of the publike intereſts; becauſe the richeſt, and ſecureſt Treaſures of a free State, are the riches of the Nobilitie, and Citizens together; a matter, which falleth not out in a Monarchy, where betweene the commings in of the Prince, and the meanes of private men, there runneth a long wall of eight ſtories high built by Mine, and Thine: Further, that in a Monarchy the mutation of the State commonly followeth vvith litle, or no prejudice to the people, only changing the name of Mathew, to that of Martin; but in the ſubverſions of Commonweales, where libertie is changed into ſervitude, there the proper ſubſtance of private men is the publike treaſure; for then will they profuſely ſpend all that ever they haue, for to defend their owne libertie euen to the laſt gaſpe.

               APollo, with much diſpleaſure, came to know, how the greater part of moderne Princes, to preuaile ouer their enemies, doe not according to the manner of the ancient Heroes, vſe open force of Armes, but (for the moſt part) fraude; in the practiſe whereof they are ſo vnderſtanding, that vvith that only powerfull meane they haue brought to paſſe moſt important enterpriſes; vvhence it is, that the firſt vveapon, vvhich they employ againſt their enemies is that ſame shamefull corrupting the faith of their male-contented ſubjects, and ſtirring vp the Nobilitie to rebellion. To remedy then ſuch grievous diſorders, about thirtie yeares paſt his Maieſtie commanded, that the infortunate Count St. Paul, the Prince of Orange, and the Duke of Guize should be cloſely carried in a Caroch by Gio: Franceſco Lottini, the ſecret Regiſter of Morall precepts in this Court, vnto the porch of the Delphicke Temple; vvhere thoſe three great Princes, vvith their hands, without fingers, and all ſo foully torne, as if they had beene gnawen with dogges, vvere shewed by Lottini to the people, vvhich came in and out at the Temple; vnto

vvhom vvith a lowd voyce he ſaid: Yee faithfull Vertuous, devoted vnto Learning, and holy Morall precepts, by this ſo miſerable calamitie of theſe vnhappy Princes, depriued of the vſe of their hands, which God preſerue vnto you, take example, and learne vvhat it is for a man to ſuffer himſelfe to be carried to ſuch ſimplicitie, as to plucke Crabbes out of their holes with his owne hands, for the benefit of another.

            THe report goeth in this Court, that the Mighty Monarchy of Spayne, by her chiefe Secretarie in vited the worthy Cardinall of Toledo, vvith allowance of a large penſion, to aſſiſt as her Theologian in the Royall Councell of State, to the end that no hing should be determined there, vvhich might be againſt his conſcience: This matter filled the vvhole Court vvith marvaile, in regard euery one knew how litle that Prelate in the rebenediction of the moſt Chriſtian King Henry the 4. favoured the affaires of his Prince; for vvhich cauſe no man could imagne the occaſion, vvherefore ſo vviſe a Queene in a buſineſſe of ſuch weight, should vſe the ſervice of ſo diffident a ſubiect. Thoſe vvhich make profeſſion beſt to vnderſtand the manner of proceeding of the adviſed Spanish Nation, even in this reſolution acknowledged the inveterate prudence of the Kings of Spayne, vvhoſe proper cuſtome it is never to be at quiet, vntill that vvith penſions, vvith honorable Charges, with all kinde of loving demonſtrations, and humane deuiſes, they haue drawen vnto their partie all ſuch great ſubjects, as they ſee to be alienated from their Intereſt, and from vvhom they know, that one day yet they may receive ſervices. The chiefeſt Confidents of ſo great a Cardinal, deliuer, that his Lordship very gladly accepted the noble Charge propounded

vnto him; howbeit vvith this condition, (vvhich by the Spaniards vvas preſently rejected) that whenſoever vvith the authoritie of the ſacred Scriptures, vvith the Doctrine of the holy Fathers, vvith the ordinances of the Cannons, he should make the Royall Councell capable, how the reſolutions made in it, vvere diſagreeing from the Lawes of God, and men; he alone then vvould haue power to hinder the execution of them; and all to the end, the World might know, That the Royall Theologian in that Councell was only to helpe the conſcience of his King vvith the will of God, not to ſerve for a maſke to eſtablish the Dominion of Kingdomes over men; for it ſeemed too shamefull a matter vnto him, that ſuch a one as he should be employed to authoriſe the diabolicall impietie of the moderne reaſon of State, and to make moſt ſtinking Aſſa fetida appeare vnto ſimple people very excellent Muſke.
         
         
            
            CHAP. 16. The Spaniards attempt the acquiſition of Savoy, but doe not prevaile.
            
            SEeing that for to draw the French naile out of the table of Milan, vvhere it vvas fixed, the ill-adviſed Italian Princes had made vſe of the Spanish pickaxe, which entred in ſuch manner into the very table it ſelfe, that it was neuer poſſible ſince to draw it forth with any kinde of pincers whatſoever, all the Potentates of Europe, and eſpecially the Italian Princes, which perceived, that the Spanyards after the ſervitude of the Milaneſi, openly aſpired to the abſolute Dominion of all Italy, to the end they might ſecure that remainder of libertie, which is yet reſting in her, agreed amongſt themſelves, that every five and twentieth yeare, the Chaine vvhich the Spanyards haue forged for the Italian ſervitude, should vvith exact diligence be meaſured by perſons thereunto deputed. And comming (a few daies ſince) accordingly to meaſure it, the Italian Princes to their infinit amazement found, that ſo odious a Chaine vvas encreaſed vvith fiue moſt prejudiciall linkes; preſently whereupon the Politicall Smithes were called, who very carefully made an aſlay of the yron added to the Chaine, and they found that the firſt linke vvas forged at Piombino, the

other at Finale, the third at Correggio, the fourth at Porto Lungone, and the laſt at Monaco. Greatly did the Princes marvaile at the ſtrangeneſſe of this accident, and many of them were ashamed, tht thorough their careleſſe ſimplicitie the Spanyards had encreaſed the Chaine of the Italian ſervitude, much more in peace, then they could haue done in warre with foure Armies. With theſe ſtrange exorbitances, the Italian Princes were ſo incenſed againſt the Spanyards, that they told them freely, how if they did not containe themſelues within the bounds of honeſtie, and modeſtie; if the Italian files would not ſuffiſe to reduce that miſerable Chaine to his due meaſure, they would make vſe of the French; and if with them neither they could obtaine their intent, they would procure enough from England, and Germany; yea, and in caſe of deſperation they would not ſticke to furnish themſelues with thoſe excellent damaſked ones, that are made in Turkie. Whilſt the Italian Princes were in this conteſtation, there arrived a Poſte, which in all haſt had beene diſpatched out of Italy vnto them with this certaine aduertiſement, That the Spaniards were forging another linke in Savoy, to be added vnto the Chaine of their ſervitude: in regard of which newes, the renowned Venetian Libertie inſtantly opened her famous Arſenall, and all the Princes of Italy ranne to arme themſelues; the warlike French Monarchy cōmanded her Nobilitie to horſe, all Germany put themſelves in order to paſſe the mountaines, and the numerous Fleetes of the English, and Hollanders, ſet ſaile towards the ſtreights of Gibraltar; when juſt in the nicke, even as all the World was in Armes, a new Poſte arrived, vvho pacified

the minds of men with this intelligence, that indeed it was true, how the Spanyards had laboured vvith all poſſible induſtry to forge that moſt important Linke of Savoy, but that they had ſweat in vaine, becauſe in the ſoldering, it broke.
         
         
            
            CHAP. 17. The Duke d'Alva beeing arrived at Pernaſſus, in complementing with Proſpero Colonna, they fall foule about defrauding the Coloneſi of their Titles.
            
            
               DOn Hernando de Toledo Duke d'Alva, a few dayes ſince, arrived at Pernaſſus, and by expreſſe order from Apollo, a diligent examination of his actions beeing made by the militarie men, he was found worthy to be admitted into Pernaſſus amongſt thoſe famous Captaines, which without effuſion of bloud, knew how to vanquish an enemy, more by patience, and art, then by open force; or valour; that durſt hazard the fortune of Kingdomes vpon the doubtfull chance of a Battaile. But becauſe Lodovico Guicciardino, an vnderſtanding Writer of the affaires of Flanders; had preferred a Complaint, how that for certaine matters not very pleaſing, vvhich he had written of the Duke, he had beene ill entreated by him, therefore he ſtayed a long time to cleare himſelfe of ſuch an imputation; for there was an Edict of Apollo very rigorouſly obſerved in Pernaſſus, whereby that Prince, or private man, was declared to be infamous, which durſt offer any wrong to any Hiſtorian, or other Writer, for things written by him not very honorable, but yet true: Howbeit, of ſuch power were the Dukes friends that Guicciardino was contented to revoke his complaint,

whereupon withall the greateſt ſolemnitie he was admitted into Pernaſſus, and had a place in his Majeſties Company of men at Armes, which was commanded by that famous Quintus Fabius Maximus; who for the excellencie of his well-aduiſed warineſſe, was ſurnamed Cunctator. And it happened, that amongſt the other Princes, and Captaines, which the ſaid Duke viſited, one was the moſt excellent Lord Proſpero Colonna, by whom he was receiued with all kind of honour; and ſo much the more, becauſe he vnderſtood that the Duke made a publike profeſſion of beeing the diſciple, follower, and imitator of his ſlow, but ſure way of making warre. Howbeit, a ſtrange and troubleſome accident fell out in this viſitation; for at the firſt meeting, the Duke having given the Lord Proſpero the Title of your Honour, he was ſo incenſed with diſdaine, that taking himſelfe to be highly wronged by ſo vile a title, with an angry voyce he ſaid; Duke, I had thought thou wert come hither, to honor one that is greater then thy ſelfe, not to vndervalew him; but becauſe it is the fashion of the Coloneſi to anſwere the injuries of words with deedes, goe out of this houſe, and in the ſtreet (with my ſword in mine hand) I will prooue vnto thee, that all thoſe, vvhich vſe ſuch baſe termes to men of my ranke, deſerve not to be admitted into the Company of honourable perſons. The Duke remained much aſtonished to ſee that great Captaine take the matter ſo hainouſly at his hands; and going to withſtand the Lord Proſpero, who offered to thruſt him out of the chamber, they fell to grapple one with another: And becauſe the Spanyards, which were in company with the Duke, ſeeing him in ſuch termes

with Colonna, entred into the chamber to aſſiſt him: the Italians which belonged vnto the Lord Proſpero did the like; whereupon in regard of the number of perſons in ſo ſtreit a place, there enſued a cruell frey; the noyſe whereof comming into the ſtreet, was the cauſe that the newes of ſo dangerous an accident was ſuddainly carried to Apollo; who in all haſt diſpatched thither the Regent of the Vicaria vvith the guard of Archers, who freed the Duke out of the Lord Proſperoes hands: and the vprore beeing quieted, hee commanded the Spanyards, that had beene very ill handled, to returne home to their houſes; Thereupon the Lord Proſpero, to prevent any ſiniſter information that might haue beene given againſt him, preſented himſelfe before Apollo, vnto whom (the fame goeth) with a troubled countenance he vſed theſe vvords: Sir, it is well knowen, that men of the family of Colonna, of the qualitie I am of, haue alwaies enjoyed the title of Excellencie, antequam Abraham fieret, and ere the Spanyards were in rerum natura; Wherefore for that Nation to abuſe a man of my ranke, as the Duke d' Alva did me but now, is moſt inſupportable; for if the vileneſſe of him that offendeth, doth infinitely aggravate the injurie vvith him that is offended, how is it poſſible, that an Italian Baron of my qualitie, should containe himſelfe within the bounds of modeſtie, ſeeing himſelfe vndervalewed by that Nation, whoſe miſeries, not aboue foure dayes agoe to ſpeake of, ſo mooved the whole World to compaſſion, that throughout all Churches they were recommended to the charitie of well-diſpoſed Chriſtians, of whom almes were gathered, to free them from the miſerable ſervitude, wherein they were

ſo grievouſly oppreſſed by the of Moores of Granada. The Spanyards enjoy the dominion of the greater part of Italy; where, by ſuch as I am, notwithſtanding that daily they threaten it vvith a cruell, and vniverſall ſervitude, they are loved, honoured, and even ſerved. With their prodigious avarice they haue deprived vs of out wealth; and in that lamentable ſacke of Rome vvith their vnexpreſſable luſt they violated the honour of our chaſteſt Matrons. And now, in exchange of ſo abject a patience, they would alſo take from vs this litle honour of breath wee enjoy, and theſe miſerable Titles, the vnhappy remaines, and deplorable reliques of the Italian reputation: Which is a matter ſo hard to be digeſted, that by every honourable Italian Baron it ought to be revenged, not vvith complayning words, as I doe, but vvith daggers points.
            It is reported by them that vvere then preſent, how all the while the Lord Proſpero was ſpeaking, Apollo did nothing but ſmile, and that when vpon his concluſion he burſt out into thoſe words, how the Spanyards abuſes towards the Italians vvere to be revenged with daggers points, he fel to laughing out-right, and ſaid, Proſpero, thou art, and ever wert too much given over to choller: and I am inforced to tel thee, how it infinitly miſlikes me, that ſuch a one as thou, who haſt alwaies made a particular profeſſion of prudence, shouldeſt marvaile, that ſlaves, which for twentie yeares together have beene fedde in the Gallyes vvith courſe, and mouldy Bisket, when they light vpon a batch of new white Manchet, should fill their bellies till they are ready to cracke againe: Whereas that raging appetite of theirs, and every other dishoneſt

act, vvhich they vſe, to aſſwage their hunger, ought to be ſo farre from ſeeming odious vnto honeſt men which behold it, that it should rather moove them to pittie. Therefore do yee Italians likewiſe permit, that the Spanyards, men but new in this World, and lately got out of the ſervitude of the Moores of Granada, may glut themſelves with meate ſo delicate to their taſte, as are the honourable Titles, vvhich they haue found in Italy: for I aſſure thee, that vvhen they shalbe cloyed vvith ſuch vanities they alſo vvill become, as the French are, ſuch curteous Gallants, that they vvill vvillingly giue the Title of Excellency even to their horſe-boyes, much more to ſuch as thou art. And I tell thee, that if thou hadſt that prudence, and that perfect knowledge of the World, as I vvish thou haddeſt, thou vvouldeſt very well perceive, that thoſe exorbitances, and that ſo odious manner of proceeding, which the Spanyards vſe in Italy, whereof thou ſo complayneſt, is even as ſo much ſweet ſuger for you Italians, and bitter poyſon for the Spanyards; who if to their valour, to their adviſedneſſe, and vnſpeakeable ambition vvhich they haue to raigne, they had affable and curteous manners annexed, vvith the vtter deſtruction of that remnant of Libertie, which is yet out of the Lyons jawes, they would ſoon become abſolute Maſters of the World. All which are inſolencies, that vvith daggers points, not by you Italians, but by the Monarchy of Spayne herſelfe, ought to be revenged vvith all kinde of crueltie on her Spanish Miniſters, who with their vanitie diſtaſte the good ſervants of ſo great a Queene, and make her government nothing acceptable to her ſubjects: A diſorder that bringing much difficultie to the ſubſtance of that Vniverſal Monarchy, wherunto it is not

poſſible she can arrive vvith the publike hatred of all Italy, hath high need of remedie.
            With this anſwere Apollo returned the Lord Proſpero exceeding well ſatisfied to his houſe, after whom the Duke d'Alva appeared before his Majeſty with all his family wonderfull melancholy, vvhich caſt ſuch milke in their faces, that the Spanyards ſeemed not ſo blacke, as ordinarily thoſe Moores that come out of Granada vſe to be. Then Apollo interrupting the complaint vvhich the Duke was about to make againſt the Lord Colonna, ſaid; Duke, I am much diſpleaſed vvith the diſorder, vvhich I vnderſtand hath happened, and ſo much the more, by how much the cauſe of ſuch an vprore is not very juſt, nor vvithall very honourable on thy ſide: And vpon this occaſion it pleaſeth me to remember vnto you Spanyards, that to be not only niggards, as to all men ye are knowen, but not to vſe prodigalitie in giving vnto others thoſe Titles, vvhich are deſired, is a manifeſt ſigne of malignitie, becauſe the ingenuous nobilitie of a Baron is knowen, by shewing litle covetouſneſſe in receiving Titles, and much liberalitie in giving them: For even by over much, not by due honour, doth greater reputation accrew to him that giveth, then to him that receiveth it. And you Spanyards, that vſe ſuch auſteritie in deſiring great Titles onely for your ſelves, are not avvhit encreaſed in reputation, but rather are become ſo odious, and ridiculous to all men, that the Italians in their Comedies, haue deſervedly introduced the perſonage of the Spanyard to repreſent vnto the World a perfect Braggadochia. I wonder yee should not preceive, that in thinking to arrive vnto the Dominion of the earth by abuſing men, is the vvrong way to the wood; The mindes of men (Duke)

are taken vvith the baite of humanitie, vvith the whiſtle of gratitude, of courteſie, of gentleneſſe; and that Fowler would shew himſelfe very ignorant, that should goe with a drumme into a Dove-houſe for to take Pigeons, as I ſee you Spanyards, foolishly doe. Moreover, I tell you, that if ever any Nation vvere to make a baite of dignities, for to allure the Italians to fall into the nets of your Dominions, and light vpon the Limebush of your ſervitude, it is you Spanyards, for the ends vvhich yee haue vpon Italy: Withall yee are to conſider, that the States, vvhich yee poſſeſſe, of Naples, and Milan, are faſtned vnto you with Waxe; for yee shall command over thoſe two members no longer, then till the Italians reſolve to chaſe you from thence; who if they could be aſſured, that after your ruine, they should not fall into the power of the French, ye should quickly know, that only vvith a litle diſturbance, which they could give you in the Port of Genoua, they would put you into a thouſand intricate difficulties: all matters, that should admonish you to give ſatiſfaction, at leaſtwiſe in vvords, to them, whom in regard of your Intereſts in Italy, yee are obliged to reſpect. As for the injurie, vvhich you ſay you have received from the Lord Proſpero, I tell you plainly, that whatſoever affront shalbe done you vpon any ſuch like Titular occaſion, I vvill not onely be inſenſible of it, but I vvill thinke you haue deſirouſly ſought it. Then the Duke would have excuſed himſelfe vvith ſaying, that from his King he had inſtruction how to carry himſelfe towards the Italian Barons in the particular of Titles, vvhen Apollo told him, that the Spanish abuſes to the Italians were not to extend but only to the Neapolitans, and Milaneſi; and his Majeſtie alſo added, That if

much paſſion did not blind the Spanyards, they might eaſily ſee, how their Grandes, whom Spayne it ſelfe could not containe, and that in Italy, would play the Gyants, compared with the Romane Barons; and thoſe of meane ſtature would prove but dwarſſes. Herevpon a cloude, as white as ſnow, beginning by litle and litle to cover the perſon of Apollo, the Prieſts that were about him perceived how his Maieſtie would prophecie; ſo that every one falling proſtrate on the ground, and vvith the reſt, the Duke and his followers; out of that hollow cloud proceeded the divine voyce of his Majeſtie, which with a pleaſing ſound ſpake in this ſort: I fortell vnto you, Spanyards, that vvith your rough and odious manner of proceeding, yee vvill one day compell the Italian Nobitie; which is the Miſtres of the cruell Sicilian Veſpres, to plot ſome bloudy Neapolitan Even-ſong againſt you; it beeing the proper cuſtome of the Italians, with greater rage to revenge the abuſes of words, then the offences of blowes; as they that having short patience, and long hands, are borne not only with an heart moſt inclined to great reſolutions, but that doe not vſe to revenge injuries with all kind of crueltie, before they are quite forgotten by thoſe that did them. And with your owne ruine, you vvill then finde them, with ſwords in their hands, to be Paladine Orlandoes, when ye shall perſwade your ſelves, they are become moſt ſuffering Aſſes.
         
      
      
         
            
            The Poſte of Pernaſſus to the Reader.
            
            THeſe Papers comming by chance into my hands, I perceived there was ſomething in them that I could not perceive; wherefore I thought beſt to communicate them with better vnderſtandings: for my part I could ſee no hurt in them, but did imagine by that little good vvhich I ſaw, there was much more that I could not ſee, and therefore judged them fit for all mens eyes. Yet finding the names of Spayne and Auſtria, or Auſtria and Spayne, (pardon me, politicke Reader, for I am not certaine vvhich should have priority; and I know in ſuch Catholike points, a little error is deadly) ſo often inſerted, I durſt not be too bold with ſacred things. For I well ſaw thoſe two names joyntly conſidered, are now growne of ſuch eſtimation, as all Nations and Kings bend their knees, and doffe their Bonnets at the naming of them; more ſuperſtitiouſly for deſtroying, then reverently at the Name of Ieſus for ſaving. Therefore I could not reſolve, vvhether it were treaſon or ſacriledge, or I wot not what greater ſinne, to touch ſacred things profanely with common and vnwasht hands; eſpecially when I ſaw all ſuch as had done the like, or leſſe then thus, made miſerable examples of diſobedience, as if they had offended Adam himſelfe, or a houſe miraculouſly rayſed vp by God, or rather originally created in nature, to rule over all the vvorld in Adams ſtead; and that to be

the ſonne of a King, could not protect an offendor in this kind from punishment, yea, from being caſt out of his Paradiſe. O (thought I) vvhen I ſaw this, how worthy is he, that doth thus to be counted onely the Catholique King: for he is a King of kings indeed, fit to be the executioner of his Holineſſe divine Decrees, and to conſume all vvith Lightning, vvhere the ſacred fulminations vvent before. Tremble all Princes, and looke to your Crownes; eſpecially you perty ones in Germany, that are but fatted to be ſwallowed one after another, as his ſtomacke can digeſt, or your turne comes to bee ſerved vp. You ſee it is ſafer beeing his ſervant, then the ſonne of any Potentate beſides. Therefore ſtrive for place and preferment there, and helpe vvith all the ſpeed yee may, to betray one another to ruine. You that are Proteſtants or Lutherans, it is no matter for Religion; hold ſome the ſtirrop, and let others lift Spayne into the ſaddle, to ride one another like Poſte-horſes by turnes. You ſee how honourably hee deales with that Prince, whoſe peaceable patents made him eaſie entrance; and how fauourably vvith the Palatinate, vvhom hee rides in bloud, and ſpur-galls on both ſides, vvhilſt you ſtand laughing on, and ſee not that your day is comming.
            Thus I thought, and thought withall to be ſilent, and to keepe theſe Papers from flying abroad, for feare of having my owne vvings clipt. But vvhen I ſaw in defect of greater, God had rayſed vp petty Princes to defend the Faith, and put that ſpirit into the Prince of Orange, the Count Man

                  felt, and the Duke of Brunſwicke, vvhich hee had taken from Saxony and Bavaria, and others, it made me reſume courage, beholding the immediate hand of God in this vvorke, and to thinke, ſurely God vvill have

all the glory to himſelfe, that hee employes ſuch inſtruments, vvhoſe eſtates, in compariſon, are but drops to the Spanish Ocean: I vvill not therefore be guilty of ſo much cowardize, as to reſerve my ſelfe, vvhere theſe men fight, and ſeeme prodigall of their owne lives; or at leaſt, not of ſo much dishoneſty, as to conceale what God hath ſent into my hands, perhaps to publish for the generall information and benefit of all Chriſtendome. Goe out therefore, and proſper in Gods Name.
