               HOnourable Sir, the importunate curioſitie of men hath at length ouercome my purpoſe, which would not ſuffer neither this anſwere, nor the Epiſtle that gaue the occaſion of it to keepe priuate with other ſcroles in the desks of the owners. As for me, how vnwilling I haue been from the beginning and euer ſince to haue it publiſhed, both you well know, and others of worth can witneſſe, who haue earneſtly requeſted that of me, yet did not preuaile. But now ſeeing ſo great a man forced to yeeld vnto other mens deſire, let none marueile that I alſo haue done the ſame. And although this Anſwere was not written to the end that it ſhould be publiſhed; yet if they into whoſe hands it ſhall come, be equall and moderatly minded, not ſeruile to affections, there will proue no cauſe (I truſt) that I ſhould repent of publiſhing it, or they of reading it. It ſhall be knowne to honeſt men, and ſuch as be

deſirous of publike agreement amongst Chriſtian people, (as I haue obſerued the moſt to be on both ſides, that are good men, and intelligent in matters Diuine) that they haue his excellent Maieſtie of GREAT BRITAINE, ioyning with them in their moſt holie wiſh, yea, with moſt earneſt deſire. Who although he haue iuſt cauſe to be perſwaded that his words, his writings, & his actions heretofore haue made manifeſt to the whole Chriſtian world the excellencie of his minde in this behalfe; yet he thought good not to deſpiſe this occaſion happened alſo of declaring the ſame. Who is there ſo void of al ſenſe of piety, which doth not embrace, and admire this affection in ſo mightie a Prince? Who ſo ſauage and barbarous as otherwaies to interpret it, or to make doubt whether this anſwere of the King did proceed from a vehement deſire of concord? Religious and wiſe men ſhall further vnderſtand what manner of peace, and concord in the Church this moſt pious Prince wiſheth: and vpon what termes and conditions his Maieſtie is readie to make couenant. For this anſwere is tempered with ſuch moderation, that the zealous endeuour by all good meanes to make vp peace, appeareth not to be inferiour to the Zealous endeuour of defending the truth. And this ſurely is the Kings opinion, this his firme ſentence, that it is but vaine for ſuch men to thinke, or talke of the peace of the Church, which are not afraid to ſeparate and diſioyne this celeſtiall chariot, which ought in no wiſe to be diſcoupled. That in vaine therefore doe they vaunt of the truth of their opinion, who maliciouſly interpreting all the ſayings of other men, and deducting thence ſuch abſurd conſequences as they liſt, giuing bad example of ſuch peruerſe 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                induſtrie, doe proue themſelues deſtitute of charitie, which is the mother of vnitie. That in vaine alſo doe they vſurpe

the golden names of Charitie, and Vnitie, which are not willing to admit of Truth, which is the foundation of pietie that is ſincere. It was of old excellently ſpoken by S. Hilarie: Beautifull is the name of peace (ſaith he) and faire is the opinion of vnitie; but who may doubt, that that only is the peace of the Church, which is the peace of Chriſt? The peace of Chriſt, which alone is taught by this moſt holy father to bee approued off in the Church, it is that, by which the doctrine of Chriſt, which he taught his Apoſtles, and his Apoſtles taught the primitiue Church, doth remaine ſafe defenced, and vnſhaken. Let thoſe to whom it belongeth, who challenge the principall places in the Church, offer vnto his Maieſtie ſuch a peace, and ſtraightway the diſcord is ended. Let them ingeniouſly and faithfully ſeparate humane matters from diuine, things ſuperſtitious from things religious, nouelties, and late-borne deuices from ſuch matters as be truly ancient, laſtly, the nothing or leſſe neceſſarie, from the neceſſary: and I ſay againe, and I crie aloud, that all may heare, on his Maieſties part, and for the Church of England, the diſcord is at an end Now, to come vnto ſo great a benefit, there lieth but one Kings ſtreete, as it were, which from the entrance of the Church hath been beaten by our anceſtors, namely the free celebration of a Generall Councell: wherein the complaints of all Nations may be heard, wherein controuerſies may be determined, and peace for the time enſuing, by Gods mercie bee eſtabliſhed. For the rooting of bad opinions out of mens mindes, and for the reconciliation of nations diuided by diſſention, the Church in all ages knew no other courſe but this, nor vſed other but this; they vſed not violence nor armes. But ſeeing by reaſon of the generall ſinnes of vs all,

there appeares no hope of a Generall Councell, yet it would be ſome eaſe of this euill, if the great libertie, or rather vnbridled licence of daily writing and publiſhing bookes of Diuinitie, were by ſeuere lawes on both ſides reſtrained. For now what hope can remaine, when throughout all Europe euery where, euer now and then, new writers come abroad, ſuch as be readie to powre oyle into the fire, rather then by casting on water to extinguiſh the flame. Gregorie Nazianzen, that admirable Diuine, could not endure in the men of his time, the curioſitie in diſputing of diuine matters: and in diuers places of his writings hee affirmes that the only cauſe almoſt of the euils which that age ſuffered, not vnlike to ours now adaies, was this: becauſe men, void of Gods ſpirit, commonly and promiſcuouſly did diſpute of ſpirituall things, and conuert Theologie into technology, that is, make no other vſe of Diuinity but as a matter 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . of learned, or artificiall diſcourſe, as they talke of other arts and ſciences out of humane reaſon. From this licence, which now almoſt euery where beareth ſway riſe ſo many new tearmes, and ſuch diuerſitie of formes of ſpeech, and 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . ſentences which daily more and more breed diſſention in the Church of God. Away then with this libertie of prophecying, which is ſo pleaſing vnto ſome of theſe times, if they vnderſtand thereby a licence of broaching new deuices, and departing from the doctrine which hath been receiued by conſent of all men in the ages of the primitiue Church. What ſhould I tell here of thoſe vnſauourie, and vnlettered writers, which are ſcarcely perfit in the firſt elements of Christian religion, which daily come foorth of thoſe places eſpecially, where, without any difference made of good or euill demeanours, without reſpect of knowledge or ignorance, to the hurt of the common good, rewards are

propounded, vnto any one that being growne impudent can ſet out a booke againſt the aduerſe part, though it be full of rage, and emptie of all learning. But what good can be hoped for from ſuch, as make the knowledge of Diuinitie a trade of liuing, a helpe or way to get money? whom neither the glorie of God doth moue to write, nor the loue of truth, nor the edification of the Church, much leſſe the deſire of godly and holie peace: but reward only, and baſe hire, or the tickling of vaine glorie? Here it will be good to blaze the impudencie of one amongst many of the ſcriblers 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . of this garbe, of whom I will let you know what is his Maiesties iudgement. He whom I meane, whom I am aſhamed to name, ſuch is the baſeneſſe of this new Doctor, is a common vagrant Peltmonger, an idiot, an illiterate fellow, that neither hath Greeke, nor Latin, without ſcience and without conſcience, borne to trouble honeſt men, and to ſpend ſuſtenance, and nought elſe good for. He, becauſe amongst women he is held a petie Master, and well tongu'd in his mother language, hath taken vpon him of late to cenſure all the writers of both ſides. Which he hath vndergone more willingly, becauſe two yeeres agoe being deeply indebted, hauing got a penſion of ſeuen hundred Crownes, that he might wipe off the old debt, and haue annuall pay (I ſpeake nothing but truth, and what he himſelfe told me) changde ſides, and fled vnto the aduerſe part. So he, which amongst thoſe whom he forſooke, liued in famous for ſuſpition of being an Atheiſt, hatefull to all honeſt men that knew him neerely, now, forſooth, muſt needs approoue the feruour of his new Zeale to thoſe to whom hee hath fled, that is, whom hee hath deceiued. Wherefore Pelt: being now a Doctor of his owne or eating, daily writes, or rather vomites out new bookes. Firſt, two

yeeres ſince hee laid the rudiments of his new profeſsion, when hee put foorth a booke againſt the Preface of his excellent Maieſtie, that moſt learned Prince, himſelfe being the baſeſt of petifoggers, an vnlettered book-maker, the very 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                dregges of ignorance: in which booke (if you except a very few things) there is nothing but triuiall ſtuffe, vttered a thouſand times before, nothing but what is drawne out of the lees. And as for thoſe few things excepted, there is no learned man in Paris but knowes, and I am certaine from whom hee ſtole them. For we are not ignorant vnder whoſe table he gathers thoſe crummes which furniſh out his diſhes. This Pelt: hauing ſome few moneths ſince aſſaulted a man of great fame, and nobilitie, vouchſafed me alſo the honour to be thought worthie of the cenſure of this new Ariſtarch, this pillar of wiſedome: but by the way, and as it were paſsing by, leſt if hee ſhould haue done otherwaies, ſome honour (beleeue it) had accrewed vnto my name from the worthineſſe of ſo great an aduerſarie. I publiſhed not long before an Epiſtle written to Fronto Ducaeus, a Diuine of the ſocietie of Ieſus, wherein was contained a true hiſtoricall declaration of ſome things done in this kingdome by certaine of that Societie. This Epiſtle Pelt: in his booke aboue mentioned refuteth not, (how could he?) but ſtabs it with one ſharp cenſure: after that conuerting his ſpeech vnto his Maieſtie, requeſts him not to beleeue any of thoſe things which he beheld with his owne eyes, which the whole kingdome ſaw, which are laid vp in the publike records, which the vniuerſall world now knoweth to be moſt true. All theſe things my Pelt: dare call falſe, and fained through flatterie; yea, and ſaies it to the King: as if the moſt gracious and clement Prince were one, whoſe eares lie open for ſuch information as may deſtroy

the innocent. What halter, or what gallowes are condigne puniſhment for this crime? When his excellent Maieſtie read thoſe things, and ſhewed me them, who had not ſeene them before: I ſaw him heerein deteſt the ſtrange boldnes and impudence of this Pelt. And whereas hee would haue me thought a cunning flatterer, herein he wrongs egregiouſly the King, rather then me.

            Further, Pelt ſaith that when I wrote that Epiſtle I was led with a ſpirit of giddineſſe. I wondred then what hee called the ſpirit of giddineſſe: for he which makes a true relation of things done, or rather tranſcribes them out of publike records, who will ſay that hee is carried with the ſpirit of giddineſſe, but ſuch a fellow as himſelfe, which is poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of errour. But afterwards, ſome 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . three daies agoe I light vpon another booke of Pelts, written againſt a very learned man, in the end whereof hee hath another blow at me, and ſaies that I am led with the ſpirit of reformation. So the ſpirit of reformation, and the ſpirit of giddineſſe are one, and the ſame, as this miſchiefe would make them. Then all thoſe men of diuers ages paſt, which haue earneſtlie deſired the reformation of the Church, and haue left vs many bookes for witneſſes of their deſire, all were giddie. What? were the Fathers of the Tridentine Councell led with giddineſſe, which make ſo often mention of reformation? In the ſame booke Pelt: warnes me to take heed of writing any thing that may diſpleaſe

him: otherwaies I ſhall ſmart for it, he will runne me thorow. O zealous man for the houſe of God! which ſhootes foorth his zeale as farre as things that are not. Happie I; if I may fall by the hand of this great Aeneas. Only this ſcruple troubles me ſore: how will he doe to confute my writings, who is not able to vnderſtand them? for I write not bookes for the women of France to reade. Well, I will giue Pelt: one aduice, which will free both me and him from this ſcruple. Let him remember the old precept; Quam quiſque norit artem in hac ſe exerceat: Let euery man practiſe that art, wherein he is skilfull. Therefore, which thing only he hath learned, wherein only he is able, curet cuticulam, let him care for his pelt, and leaue theſe learned conflicts vnto thoſe that haue learning. Neither let him be ſo high minded, as to thinke that I will euer make any other account of him then of a barking dogge, or a wincing aſſe. I am not wont to be ſo prodigall of good houres, that he may hope I will euer turne the point of my ſtile vpon him. You ſee (honourable Sir) what kinde of Diuines ſpring of late, which like to Muſhroms grow great in one night, whom therefore the Greek Diuine wittily tearmeth ſowne Diuines, and worthilie 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . debarreth from the handling of ſacred things. But I returne to this Anſwere, which hauing found publiſhed corruptly in the parts beyond ſea, I reutewed it, and corrected it. And this I ſend to you for a teſtimonie of my loue, and ſeruice, which I know will be welcome to you.

            THE ANSWERE OF Mr. ISAAC CASAVBON TO THE Epiſtle of the moſt illuſtrious, and moſt reuerend Cardinall PERON.
            
               MOſt illuſtrious, and moſt reuerend Lord, I haue learned (as I thinke) by vſe, and experience, that there is no euill ſo great, out of which, or by occaſion whereof ſome good may not ariſe. And as it is an vſuall ſpeech that honey breedeth gall; ſo it may bee ſaid not vnfitly, that ſomtimes out of pure gall commeth pure honey. Not to ſeeke any further proofe of this, the lewd book of that deboſht cauiller, which gaue me firſt occaſion by his excellent Maieſties commaund, of writing to your illuſtrious Honour, it was pure gall, and that moſt virulent. But both your letters, which vpon that occaſion you ſent me, ſeaſoned with ſingular courteſie, humanitie, and prudence, witneſſing the faire ingenuitie of the author, were ſweeter to me then any honey. Wherefore I was not afraid to ſhew them vnto his Maieſtie, and his Maieſtie, although he approued not of all that was in them, (for that could not be) yet hee refuſed not, but was willing to reade them both. It delighted him very much, that yet he knew one Diuine of your ſide, a man of chiefe place, of honorable eſtimation, and excellent learning, which handling the controuerſies of theſe times, appeared to be of a moderate, and quiet diſpoſition. For, with what ſpirit the

moſt are led, which now adaies ſet out bookes of this argument, there needs no more ſufficient declaration then out of thoſe writers which hitherto haue oppugned his Maieſties Apologie. All of them (if you except one or two) filling their vnhappie leaues with lies, reproches, and foule language. But eſpecially the words in your laſt letters did delight his Maieſtie, whoſe minde is enflamed with the zeale of ſincere pietie, whereby you ſeemed to put him in hope that this friendly communication concerning matters of religion was like not to prooue fruitleſſe. Which thing as it pleaſed the King marueilouſly, who is readie vpon this condition to vndergoe any paines, ſo, if there remaine no hope hereof; neither is there any iuſt cauſe why his Maieſtie, or your Honour ſhould trouble your ſelues. Surely I hope, if your Worthineſſe will take ſerious care of it, that with the helpeof almightie God, you may effect, by the authoritie which you haue amongſt your owne, and the report of learning, and wit amongſt all, that by theſe mutual writings, ſome good profit may redownd to ye Church of Ieſus Chriſt. As for his moſt excellent Maieſtie of Great Britaine, in whoſe Court I haue now liued a whole veere and more, I dare promiſe you, and with all manner of aſſeueration confirme, that he is ſo affected, and that the courſe of his whole life hath bin ſo ordered, that all men may eaſily vnderſtand there is nothing dearer to him then the carefull endeuour for religion. Neither priuate buſineſſe, nor the publike cares of his kingdome doe vſually ſo affect his Maieſtie, as a kinde of vnmeaſurable deſire by all meanes to promote religion, and (which conſideration moſt beſeemes ſo great a King) an exceeding affection by all right and honeſt meanes to procure peace amongſt the diſſenting members of the Church. And this care ſo fitting a Chriſtian Prince, the moſt pious King hath not confined within the bounds of his owne kingdome, though very large, but remembring that he is ſtiled the Defendour of the faith, he hath thought good, not out of any curioſitie, but a vehemencie of zeale to extend it beyond the limites of his owne

little world: that his Maieſties wiſedome and authoritie might be beneficiall alſo to the Churches of other Countries, if occaſion were offered: and that daily it might be more apparant in the ſight of God, and men, that his chiefe care is the preſeruation of Chriſtian religion. Of late therefore, and about the time when I ſhewed you his laſt letters, his Maieſtie gaue this great experiment of this his deuout minde: which, as it is moſt worthilie approued, and commended 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . here of all good and godly men, ſo, I hope, moſt illuſtrious Cardinall, that the knowledge of it will be delightfull to you. When the right Honourable and moſt reuerend Prelate, the Lord Archbiſhop of Canterburie his Grace, by letters certified his Maieſtie, that there came vnto his hands a booke brought out of ſome part of Germanie, or the Low Countries, containing doctrine concerning the nature of God, which was new, peruerſe, and in ſome points repugnant to the faith of the Catholike Church; and withall deſired his Maieſtie that for the repreſſing of this miſchiefe, which was lately ſprung vp, hee would ſhew foorth the zeale of the Defendour of the faith, and intercede with the Magiſtrates of that place where the author liued, deſiring of them not to ſuffer ſo prodigious doctrine to bee 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . brought into their Churches, and Vniuerſities, and that the inuentor of this prophane noueltie might not paſſe vnpuniſhed: the King, as he came out of coach, after a tedious hunting, as ſoone as hee had receiued the letters, and the booke, noted, and markt in ſundrie places by that moſt vigilant Prelate, without any delay thought it a buſineſſe worthie to be taken notice of. And although at that time his bodie was faint with exerciſe, and faſting, yet what he had begun, he went through at once, as it were with one continuance and heate of endeuour: neither could hee bee entreated by the Nobilitie which ſtood about him to haue any reſpect of himſelfe, vntill after a good long conſideration of the whole matter, with the right reuerend Biſhop of Lichfield and others of the Clergie, and a perfect vnderſtanding thereof, hee moſt accuratly diſcharged, as

much as appertained to him, and as piety commanded. The booke was condemned, and it was determined that all the copies of it ſhould be burnt in London, and in both the Vniuerſities. Which afterwards was performed. Letters were immediatly diſpatched (the King himſelf dictating) vnto his Maieſties Legier there lying, to teſtifie what was the iudgement of the King, and the Church of England concerning this new doctrine. Withall, order was giuen to acquaint the Magiſtrates with the matter. Let them looke to it, to whom the care of remouing that euill doth belong, what account of their delay they can make vnto the immortall God, if (which wee hope cannot come to paſſe) neither of their owne accord, nor after ſo notable example, they vndergoe the patronage of the truth with leſſe zeale and endeuour then they ought. His Maieſtie at the firſt receiuing of the newes was ſo mooued, that hee thought hee ſhould commit a grieuous offence, if hee gaue any indulgence to his bodie, before he had fully performed this office of pietie. I doubt not (moſt illuſtrious Cardinall) but you will greatly approue of, and praiſe this deed. I haue made relation to you of what was done, not to the intent I might commend his Maieſtie vnto you, but to let you vnderſtand how faſt he holdeth the ancient faith, and how ſtout and earneſt a Defendour he is of the opinions of the true Catholike Church, whom notwithſtanding moſt of your Catholikes will not haue to bee accounted and called a Catholike, yea many, not a Chriſtian. His Maieſtie at the firſt thought the ſtrife about thoſe names not to be materiall, whileſt he held that which was meant by them, which his Maieſtie deſires to doe, and fullie truſts in the mercie of God that he doth. But becauſe the common ſort of men doe thus interpret, that to be depriued of ſuch names, is all one as to bee depriued of the things vnderſtood by thoſe names: therefore hee doth not thinke it wiſedome to take no notice of this wrong. As concerning the name of Chriſtian, there is no ſtrife, no controuerſie betwixt you and him. For neither of your Epiſtles doth deny

this title to be due vnto him. The queſtion is then concerning the title of Catholike. For after that, according vnto your excellent eloquence, in your firſt Epiſtle you had ſignified that you acknowledged in the King of Great Britaine the perfect and abſolute Idea of the greateſt Prince; in the end, you put this exception, if vnto the other gifts of his minde the glorious name of Catholike might bee added: and when, by his Maieſties commandement, it was anſwered, that that title could not be denied to him, which acknowledged the three Creeds of the Church Catholike, and the foure firſt generall Councels: and which beleeued all things that were beleeued as neceſſarie to ſaluation in the foure firſt ages: with this anſwere in your laſt accurate and ſubtile letters you appeared not to be ſo well ſatisfied. Thoſe letters perſwade your ſelfe that they were not read haſtily, and curſorily, for he read them through, and examined the waight of your reaſons with wonderfull equitie, and gentlenes of minde. But, whereas, after the reading of your anſwere, hee departeth not from his former opinion, and yet neuertheleſſe, by the helpe of Gods grace, truſteth he is a true Catholike, his Maieſtie would haue you know what reaſons he hath for this reſolution. Wherefore, moſt illuſtrious Cardinall, receiue this ſhort anſwere to your laſt letters, which receiuing from his Maieſties owne mouth, I was commanded to compriſe in words, and to ſend vnto you. I will not now requeſt of you, that in the reading of theſe you would vſe ſuch equitie, as hee did in the reading of yours. I know full well your excellent wiſedome and moderation worthie of all praiſe. The whole diſputation in your laſt letters conſiſteth of two parts. In the former part are brought fiue reaſons, which do illuſtrate and ſhew the acception of this theſis, in what ſenſe you would haue it taken. This theſis; Catholici appellatio, &c. The name of Catholike can be denied to none which admits of the three, namely, the Apoſtles, the Nicene, and the Athanaſian Creeds: and of the foure firſt generall Councels, the Nicene, the Constantinopolitane, the Epheſine, and that of Chalcedon: lastly, which beleeues
               
               all thoſe things that were thought neceſſarie to be beleeued to ſaluation in the first foure ages. This theſis, in the Kings anſwere, hath the place of the maior propoſition. The ſecond part of your diſputation bringeth in foure inſtances againſt the hypotheſis, or aſſumption.
            
               THE FIRST OBSERVATION.
               THe name of Catholike doth not ſimply ſignifie faith, but alſo a communion with the Catholike Church. Therefore the ancients would not haue them called Catholikes which departed from the communion of the Church, albeit they retained the ſame faith. For they ſaid, there was but one Church Catholike, out of which a man might haue the faith and Sacraments; but ſaluation hee could not haue. To this purpoſe you bring many things out of S. Auguſtine.
            
            
               HIS MAIESTIES ANSVVERE.
               TO beleeue the Catholike Church, and to beleeue the communion of Saints, are ſet downe in the Apoſtles Creed diſtinctly, as two diuers things. And the former of theſe two articles ſeemes to be inſerted eſpecially, to the end that a difference might bee made betwixt the Iewiſh Synagogue, and the Chriſtian Church. Which was not to bee confined within the bounds of one nation, as that was, but to be ſcattered farre and wide thorow all the regions of the world. Wherefore there is no manifeſt reaſon, why in the beginning of this obſeruation the name of Catholike ſhould be ſaid to ſignifie communion. Indeed theſe two are very neere ioyned, but they are two diuers things, as I haue ſhewed. Now his Maieſtie beleeues vnfainedlie, that there is but one Church of God, truly, and in name Catholike, or vniuerſall, diffuſed ouer the whole world, out of which he affirmeth alſo that no ſaluation is to be hoped for. Hee condemneth, and deteſteth thoſe which either long ſince, or more lately haue either departed from the faith of

the Catholike Church, and ſo become heretikes, as the Manichies, or from communion, and ſo haue become ſchiſmatikes, as the Donatiſts: againſt which two ſorts of men chiefly al thoſe things were written by S. Auguſtine, which are brought in this obſeruation. Likewiſe his Maieſtie commends the wiſedome of thoſe godly Biſhops, which in the fourth Councell of Carthage, as is here well obſerued, did adde vnto the forme of examination of Biſhops, an interrogation concerning this point. Neither is the King ignorant, that ye fathers of the ancient Church did oftentimes many things by way of condeſcent, pro bono pacis, as they yſed 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . to ſay, that is, for deſire of maintaining vnitie, and for feare of breaking mutuall communion. Whoſe example he profeſſeth himſelfe readie alſo ſtudiouſly to imitate, and to follow in the ſteps of thoſe that follow after peace, ad aras vſ

                   to the altars, that is, as farre as he may (conſidering the ſtate of the Church in theſe daies) with the ſafetie of a good conſcience. For hee is as much grieued as any man, for the diſtraction of the members of the Church, ſo much abhorred by the holy Fathers: and as earneſtly deſireth to communicate, if it were poſſible, with all that are members of the myſticall bodie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Neuertheleſſe, his Maieſtie thinketh that he hath moſt iuſt cauſe to diſſent from thoſe, which ſimply, without any diſtinction, or exception, doe perpetually vrge this communion. He acknowledgeth it to be very neceſſarie, and one of the proper notes of the Church: yet doth not account it for the true forme of the Church, and that which the Philoſopher calls the eſſentiall being. His Maieſtie hath learned by his reading 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . of the holie Scriptures (according to the minde of all ancient fathers) that the true and eſſentiall forme of the Church is this, that the ſheepe of Chriſt heare the voyce of 
                     Iohn 10. 3. their ſhepheard, and that the Sacraments be rightly and lawfully adminiſtred, namely as the Apoſtles haue giuen example, and thoſe which followed neere to the Apoſtles times. Thoſe Churches which are thus inſtituted, they muſt needes be linked together by a manifold communion.

They are vnited in Chriſt their head, who is the fountaine of life, whereby all live, whom the Father hath choſen to be redeemed by his precious blood, and to be rewarded with eternall life. They are vnited in the vnion of faith, and doctrine, in ſuch chiefe points as are neceſſarie to ſaluation. For there is but one ſauing doctrine, there is but one way to heauen. They are vnited in coniunction of mindes in true charitie, and the duties of charitie, eſpecially of mutuall prayers. Laſtly, they are vnited in the communion of one hope, and expectation of promiſed inheritance; knowing, that before the foundations of the world they were predeſtinate (I ſpeake of the elect) to be fellow heires, and of the ſame bodie, and partakers of the promiſe of God in Chriſt through the Goſpell, as ſaith the diuine Apoſtle. Yet 
                     Epheſ. 3. 6. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . his Maieſtie addes further, that the ſame Church, notwithſtanding if any member thereof depart from the rule of faith, will more eſteeme of the loue of truth, then the loue of vnitie. He knowes that the ſupreme lawe in the houſe of God is the ſinceritie of celeſtiall doctrine: which if any man forſake, he forſakes Chriſt which is Truth it ſelfe: hee 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 1. Tim. 3. 15 forſakes the Church, which is the pillar and eſtabliſhment of truth, and by this meanes ceaſeth to appertaine vnto the body of Chriſt. With ſuch Apoſtates, a true Catholike neither will nor can communicate: for what concent betwixt Chriſt and Belial? Wherefore the Church will flie from communion with theſe, and wil ſay with Greg Nazianzen, 2. Cor. 6. 15

                  that diſagreement for godlineſſe is better then ill affected concord. Neither will he doubt, if need be, to ſay with the ſame bleſſed father, that there is a holy contention. Now that ſuch a neceſſarie ſeparation ſhould ſometimes be in the Church, both wee are taught in other places of holie Scripture, and that admonition alſo of the holie Ghoſt, not without cauſe giuen to the Church, doth openly declare: ſaying, Goe out of Babylon, my people, leſt you communicate 
                     Apoc. 18. 4. with her ſinnes. What that Babylon is, whereout the people of God are commanded to depart, the King diſputes not in this place, nor affirmes hee any thing concerning it: yet

thus much the matter it ſelfe doth plainly ſhew, that whether ſome priuate Church be vnderſtood in that place by the name of Babylon, or the greater part of the whole, it was before this a true Church, with which the religious might religiouſly communicate: but after it was more depraued, the religious are commanded to goe out, and to breake off communion. Whereby it may be eaſilie vnderſtood, that not all communion with thoſe that be called Chriſtians is to bee deſired of the faithfull, but that only which may ſtand with the integritie of doctrine reuealed from heauen. Now, to come neerer to the purpoſe, his Maieſtie denies thoſe places of S. Auguſtine to belong at all to him. For he affirmes that all thoſe teſtimonies doe euince this only; that there remaines no token of ſaluation for them which depart from the faith of the Catholike Church, or from communion with the ſame Church. Which thing (as I ſaid before) the King willingly grants. But here his Maieſtie deſires of you (moſt illuſtrious Cardinall) that you would call to minde, and perpend, what great difference there is betwixt the times of S. Auguſtine, and theſe of ours. How much the Church now called Catholike differs from the ancient; how the face of the Church is changed, and the outward forme, to ſay nothing of the inward. For then the Church Catholike was like a citie ſeated vpon an hill, which, as Chriſt ſaith, cannot be hid, knowne to all, conſpicuous 
                     Matth. 5. 14 and certaine, whereof no ſound minde could make queſtion. Which was not (as the fooliſh Donatiſts prated) lying I know not where, in the South, driuen into ſome corner of the world, but diffuſed farre and wide thorow the whole earth flouriſhing vnder the Emperours, whoſe dominion extended from the Eaſt to the Weſt, and from North to South. You might ſee the Biſhops of the Eaſt and Weſt daily communicating, and when need required aſſiſting one another. For that which is written in the Conſtitutions of Clement, that the Catholike Church is the 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . charge of all the Biſhops, and by that meanes that euery one is an Oecumenicall Biſhop, we wonder now when we

reade it, neither can wee beleeue it, which then daily practiſe did ſhew to be moſt true, and may eaſily be demonſtrated out of hiſtorie, by infinit examples. There were then alſo in frequent vſe literae formate, that is, demiſſatie or teſtimoniall letters; by commerce whereof, and as it were by tokens, communion was held amongſt the members of the Church, although farre remoued by diſtance of place. Furthermore, when it ſtood in neede, they had Councels truly Occumenicall, not, as ſince we haue ſeene; Occumenicall in name only, but indeed aſſembled out of ſome Prouinces of Europe. And in thoſe ancient times this was the faſteſt bond, whereby all the members of the Catholike Church were knit together in the ioynture of one bodie; which bodie was for that cauſe very eminent, conſpicuous, and in the faire view of all, which no man could chuſe but know. There was one faith, one ſtate, one body Catholike, frequent mutuall viſitation, wonderfull conſent of all the members, a wonderfull ſympathie. Was any man lapſed by hereſie, or ſchiſme from the communion of any one Church: I ſpeake not of any one of the chiefe, which were the ſeates of the foure Patriarchs: but of any one much ſmaller? that man as ſoone as it was knowne, was held to be excluded from the communion of the whole Catholike Church. For whereas wee meete with ſome examples obſerued to the contrarie, that was not right, but vſurpation. Was any man bold to corrupt the truth a little, by being of another opinion? it was eaſie euen for a child to deprehend 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   him. Wherefore ſuch a ſteale-truth being once diſcouered, all the ſhepheards of the whole world, if need was, were raiſed, and were neuer quiet vntill they had rooted out this euill, and prouided for the ſecuritie of Chriſts ſheepe. By theſe ſignes and markes the Church at that time was conſpicuous: but this happineſſe continued not many ages. For, after that the Empire was ouerturned, and the forme of the Common-wealth altered, there ſprung vp many new ſtates, differing as well in manners and language, as in ordinances, and lawes. Then vpon the diſtraction of the Empire

followed the diſtraction of the Catholike Church: and by little and little all thoſe things ceaſed, which had been before of ſingular vſe for the preſeruation of vnion and communion in the outward Catholike bodie of the Church. From that time the Catholike Church hath not ceaſed to be, for it ſhall continue euer, neither ſhall the gates of hell at any time preuaile againſt it, ſeeing it is founded vpon Chriſt the true rock, and vpon the faith of Peter and the reſt of the Apoſtles; but it began to be leſſe manifeſt, being diuided into many parts, which, as touching externall communion, were quite ſeparated from one another. Then (which is chiefly to be lamented) it came to paſſe by this diſſipation, that there was leſſe ſtrength in the parts, then before in the whole bodie to reſiſt the enemie of mankind, who is readie at al times, as our Sauiour teacheth, to ſcatter tares amongſt the good ſeede. And conſidering, in theſe times wee ſee with our eyes that this is come to paſſe, and it is ſo groſſe that wee may almoſt grope it with our hands, it is ridiculous, and moſt abſurd to diſpute whether this thing could heretofore happen, or hath now happened. Therefore the Church of Rome, the Greek Church, the Church of Antioch, and of Aegypt, the Abyſſine, the Moſchouite and many others, are members much excelling each other in ſinceritie of doctrine, and faith: yet all members of the Catholike Church, whoſe ioynture, in regard of the outward forme was long ſince broken. For which cauſe his Maieſtie doth much wonder, when hee conſiders how ſome Churches, which heretofore were but members of the bodie once entire, doe now ingroſſe all the right of the whole, and appropriate to themſelues the name of Catholike: excluding from their communion, and affirming boldly, that they belong not to the Catholike Church, whoſoeuer doe diſſent from them in anything, or refuſe the yoke of their bondage. Neither do you only challenge to your ſelues this right: there are others that do the ſame. For, (his Maieſtie ſpeakes it with griefe) there are at this day many priuate Churches, which beleeue that they onely

are the people peculiar, which they call the Church. Giue 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . them that ſtrength which the Church of Rome hath, and they ſhall doe the ſame with her, and pronounce of all others as hardly as ſhe doth. What ſhall wee ſay? are there not ſundrie ſects now adaies, which are certainly perſwaded that they only haue inſight into the Scriptures, and, (as the Poet ſaith) that they only are wiſe, that all others walke

                   like ſhadowes? It is true, indeed, that in euery age there were conuenticles of ſectaries, and diſſemblies, which did boaſt themſelues of the Catholike Church, and by this prouocation did allure many vnto them: but it is the peculiar and famous calamitie of theſe latter times, that the Catholike Church, vnto which of neceſſitie a man muſt adhere, either really, and actually, or at the leaſt in will, and vow, is become leſſe manifeſt then it was of old, leſſe expoſed to the eyes of men, more queſtionable and doubtfull. For 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . which cauſe his excellent Maieſtie thinketh that he ought more carefully in ſuch a deluge of variable opinions to betake himſelfe to the mountaines of the ſacred Scripture: and as S. Auguſtine gaue counſell to the Donatiſts to ſeeke the Church of Chriſt in the words of Chriſt. And ſo S. Chryſoſtome, both elſewhere, and of purpoſe in his 33. Homilie vpon the Acts of the Apoſtles, handling the queſtion, How the true Church might be diſcerned amongst many Societies which challenge to themſelues that name: teacheth that there be two meanes of deciding that queſtion: firſt, the word of God, and ſecondly, antiquitie of doctrine, not inuented by any new author, but alwaies knowne from the birth, and beginning of the Church. Theſe two trials the King, and 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Church of England embracing, doe auouch that they acknowledge that doctrine onely for true, and neceſſarie to ſaluation, which flowing from the fountaine of ſacred Scripture, through the conſent of the ancient Church, as it were a conduit hath been deriued vnto theſe times. Wherefore to make an end of this obſeruation, his Maieſtie anſweres, that it is faultie many waies, and cannot ſtand with the hypotheſis propounded. Becauſe (ſaith he) the Church

of England is ſo farre from forſaking the ancient Catholike Church, which ſhe doth reuerence, and admire: that ſhe departeth not from the faith of the Church of Rome, in any point wherein that Church agreeth with the ancient Catholike. If you queſtion the ſucceſſion of perſons, behold the names of our Biſhops, and their continuance from the firſt without any interruption: if the ſucceſſion of doctrine, come, make triall: let vs haue a free Councell which may not depend vpon the will of one. The Church of England is readie to render an account of her faith, and by demonſtration to euince, that the authors of the reformation here, had no purpoſe to erect any new Church, (as the ignorant and malicious doe cauill) but to repaire the ruines of the old, according to the beſt forme: and in their iudgement that is beſt which was deliuered by the Apoſtles to the Primitiue Church, and hath continued in the ages next enſuing. His Maieſtie grants, that his Church hath departed from many points of that doctrine, and diſcipline which the Pope of Rome now ſtifly defendeth: but they doe not thinke this to be a reuolting from the Catholike Church, but rather a returning to the ancient Catholike faith, which in the Romane Church by new deuices hath been manifoldly, and ſtrangely deformed; and ſo a conuerſion to Chriſt the ſole Maſter of his Church. Wherefore if any man grounding vpon the doctrine of this obſeruation, will inferre from it, that the Church of England, becauſe it reiects ſome ordinances of the Romane, hath therefore departed from the ancient Catholike Church: his Maieſtie will not grant him this, vntill he prooue by ſound reaſons, that all things taught by them of Rome, eſpecially thoſe which they will haue to be beleeued as neceſſarie to ſaluation, were allowed of from the beginning, and eſtabliſhed by the ancient Catholike Church. Now, that no man can euer doe this, at leaſt neuer yet hath done it, his Maieſtie, and the reuerend Biſhops of the Engliſh Church, doe hold it to be as cleere as when the Sunne ſhineth at midday. Laſtly, his Maieſtie thinketh it a great offence to forſake

the Church, but hee vtterly denieth that hee, or his Church are guiltie of this crime. For, ſaith his Maieſtie, we depart not voluntarily, but we are driuen away. And your Non fugimus, ſed fugamur. Honour well knoweth how many, and how excellently learned and godly men, for theſe fiue hundred yeeres at the leaſt, haue wiſhed the reformation of the Church, both in the head, and members. What grieuous complaints haue been often heard of worthie Kings and Princes, lamenting the eſtate of the Church in their times? But what auailed it? for vnto this day we ſee not any one thing amended of all thoſe which were thought moſt needfull of reformation. Wherefore the Church of England in this ſeparation feareth not any fellowſhip with the Donatiſts, if the matter be debated by ingenuous men. They willingly and without cauſe left the Catholike Church, which at that time the conſent of all nations did approue, whoſe doctrine or diſcipline they could not blame: but England being enforced by great neceſſitie, ſeparated her ſelfe from that Church, which innumerable Chriſtian people did not grant to be the true Catholike, and vniuerſall Church: nay more, which many of your owne writers haue heretofore ingenuouſly confeſſed to haue varied much from the ancient Church in matters of faith, and diſcipline; to haue patched many new things to the old, and euill to the good: which indeed, is now better knowne to the vniuerſall world, then that any man can denie, or be ignorant of it. Furthermore, the Church of England for ſome ages paſt had felt the yoke of the Romane ſeruitude ſo cruell, being afflicted with their often new vexations, and incredible exactions, that if there were no other cauſe, yet that alone might ſuffice before equall iudges to free them from the ſuſpition of ſchiſme, and as S. Auguſtine ſpeakes of the Donatiſts, iniquae diſciſſionis, of an vniuſt rent, or diſtraction from the Church. For the Engliſh did not depart from brotherly charitie vpon a humour, as the Donatiſts did, nor, as the tenne tribes of the Iewes, for feare of imminent euill: but after the patience of many ages, after vnſpeakable miſeries,

at length they withdrew their necks, and ſhaked off the intollerable burthen, which neither were they able longer, nor would their conſcience ſuffer them to beare. Beſides this, the ancient Church, to the end that ſhe might draw the refractarie Donatiſts to communion, was wont with admirable charitie to prouide for the temporall commodities of the Biſhops, and others that were reconciled: but the Church of Rome (being deſirous of amitie with England) what doth ſhe? firſt, thunders out her Buls, then vſeth violence, open, and ſecret: then receiueth into her boſome, and ſtill cheriſheth deteſtable traytors, euidently condemned of plotting the deſolation of their Countrie: laſtly, numbreth amongſt Martyrs thoſe which ſuffered for the ſame crimes, and daily defendeth their innocencie againſt all lawes both diuine and humane. Cardinall Bellarmine

                     . himſelfe (I am loth to ſpeake, but I ſpeake the truth) is become a principall patrone of theſe parricides: who of late alſo (that he might draw on his Maieſtie) hath vſed this argument of wondrous efficacie to perſwade; that the kingdome of England belongeth to the Pope, and that his Maieſtie of England euen in temporalties is his ſubiect, and holdeth his kingdome of him. I omit other grieuances of the King and Church of England both ancient and moderne, which are not to be rehearſed in this place.
            
            
               THE SECOND OBSERVATION.
               BEſides thoſe that are neceſſarie to ſaluation, there are two kind of things, which the ancient Church beleeued: whereof one is, things profitable to ſaluation, the other, things lawfull, and not repugnant to the ſame. Therefore if a man will embrace the faith of the ancients, he must alſo embrace thoſe things, and eſteeme them as the ancient Church did.
            
            
               HIS MAIESTIES ANSVVERE.
               THoſe things which were held by the holy Fathers, as not abſolutely neceſſarie to ſaluation; but only profitable,

or lawfull, they ought to be eſteemed little more then indifferent. For the vſe of them being as things not ſimplie neceſſarie, in the beginning was free. In ſuch things therefore to deuiſe any neceſſitie at all, it ſeemes vniuſt: for by and by there will follow a neceſſitie of vſing them: as wee fee it is come to paſſe in the Church of Rome: which obſerues at this day many things as ſimplie neceſſarie to the integritie of faith, which the ancient Church ſcarce knew, much leſſe vſed as matters of neceſſitie. I will alleage foure examples of many. It is manifeſt that in the primitiue Church confeſſion of ſinnes was vſed, but farre otherwaies then now. For, that auricular confeſſion in that manner which you haue it was in vſe in the primitiue ages, I think, no man will affirme. His Maieſtie grants that the Fathers which did firſt ordaine it, had their reaſons why they thought that ſuch manner of confeſſion would further the eaſier attaining vnto ſaluation: but they held it not for a thing neceſſarie abſolutely, much leſſe for a Sacrament: or at leaſt not all the Fathers thought ſo. For as touching S. Chryſoſtome, it is plaine that hee required not of his people auricular confeſſion. But the matter is now come to that paſſe, that there is little leſſe attributed to this confeſſion, then to the precious blood of Chriſt, whereby wee are redeemed: the abſolute neceſſitie thereof is ſo preciſely vrged. Whence by little grew vp that doctrine in the Church of Rome, of not diſcloſing the ſecret of confeſſion vpon any occaſion ſoeuer. For, becauſe they beleeued that it was impoſſible without this confeſſion to attaine vnto the hauen of ſaluation, therefore they thought it neceſſarie to remoue all impediments that might hinder it. Wherefore in time this doctrine hath proceeded ſo farre, that now to murther Kings, or ſuffer them to be murthered, ſeemes to be no ſinne, in compariſon of breaking the ſeale of confeſſion: which many of your Diuines, eſpecially the expounders of the Canon Law haue in their bookes publiſhed. Moreouer, Binetus a Ieſuite, did auouch as much to me at Paris, in the ſame tearmes, which I remember yt I told you afterwards.

We know alſo, neither perhaps is your Honor ignorant of it, yt there is another Ieſuit in France, which of late was bold to ſay, That if our Lord Ieſus Chriſt were liuing vpon the earth, ſubiect to death, and ſome man had told him in confeſſion, that he would kill him, notwithſtanding, rather then he would reueale that confeſſion, he would ſuffer (I tremble to ſpeake it) Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe to be murthered. Which horrible blaſphemie you ſee whence it tooke the originall. In like manner, abſtinence from wine, and daintie cheare, ſet times of faſting, xerophagiae, or, eating drie meates, the ancient Church reckoned amongſt ſuch things as were profitable to the eaſier obtaining of ſaluation: neither doth his Maieſtie denie it, giuing a conuenient interpretation according to the intention of the primitiue Church: but, by your leaue, he liketh not that the obſeruation of theſe things ſhould be more ſtrictly required, then of ſuch as are expreſſely contained in holy Writ. Againe, ſingle life in the Miniſters of the Church, was in old time commended, but now it is commanded, and exacted as a matter of abſolute neceſſitie: whereof you ſhall heare more hereafter. So, whereas S. Paul ſaith, that hee doth afflict his bodie, and make it ſeruiceable, his Maieſtie 1. Cor. 9. 27 honours, and calles them bleſſed that follow this example of the diuine Apoſtle: but he deteſteth thoſe which reckon ſackcloth, and Lacedemonian whippings, and ſuch vexations 
                     Laconicas 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . of bodie, or, as they call them, ſatisfactions, amongſt the cauſes of ſaluation: or at leaſt ſo highly prize them, that they make account of ſlouenrie, and whatſoeuer naſtines, as of ſanctimonial perfection. But of al ſuch his Maieſtie doth eſpecially abhorre them, which after the manner of the prieſts of Baal, rending their bodies with ſcourges, would make vs imagine God to be deſirous, and thirſtie for mans blood, like Bollona the Pagan Goddeſſe. Only, he commends their wiſedom, which hiring others to be whipped for them, doe purchaſe the merit of thoſe puniſhments which they haue ſuffered. So, it commeth to paſſe, that the rich offend, and the poore are puniſhed: that penaltie purſueth

not the guiloie, but him that is in pouertie and want. Wherefore, his Maieſtie, as hee thinketh it vnlawfull to condemne thoſe things which the Fathers of the firſt age by vnanimitie of conſent did hold for things expedient, or lawfull: ſo he cannot endure to be bound with any peremptorie neceſſitie of vſing the ſame. For he holdeth Neceſſarie and Indifferent to be of a contrarie nature. But of theſe more largely in the Obſeruation following.
            
            
               THE THIRD OBSERVATION.
               SEeing in the matter of religion there is more then one kinde of neceſſitie, we muſt take heed when we ſpeake of things neceſſarie to ſaluation, that we be not deceined with the ambiguitie of the tearme. For there is neceſſitie abſolute, and vpon condition: a neceſſitie of the meane, and of the precept. There is alſo a neceſſitie of beleeuing, which bindeth all Christians without exception and another which doth not generally binde all. Laſtly, there is a neceſſitie of action, and a neceſſitie of approbation.
            
            
               HIS MAIESTIES ANSVVERE.
               THe doctrine in this Obſeruation, wherein the diuers kinds of neceſſitie are learnedly, and very accurately declared, his excellent Maieſtie is ſo farre from diſliking, that on the contrarie, he thinketh, if theſe diſtinctions be taken away, a manifold confuſion would follow in matters of religion. For what can be thought more dangerous then that things abſolutely neceſſarie ſhould be held as neceſſarie only vpon condition, or contrariwiſe? and that other diſtinction which ſerueth for the right, and orderly diſpoſition of all things in the houſe of God, is no leſſe profitable. Likewiſe, in your examples, his Maieſty obſerueth nothing greatly to be diſallowed. But in your explication of things abſolutely neceſſarie, hee commendeth the truth of that ſpeech: that there is no great number of thoſe things which

be abſolutely neceſſarie to ſaluation. Wherefore his Maieſtie thinketh that there is no more compendious way to the making of peace, then that things neceſſarie ſhould be diligently ſeparated from things not neceſſarie: that all endeuours might be ſpent about the agreement in the neceſſarie, and as touching the not neceſſarie, that a Chriſtian libertie might bee granted. Simply neceſſarie, his Maieſtie calleth thoſe things, which the word of God expreſſely chargeth to bee beleeued, or practiſed: or which the ancient Church by neceſſarie conſequence, hath drawne out of the word of God. But ſuch things, which out of the inſtitution of men, although with a religious, & wiſe intent, yet beſides the word of God, were receiued, and vſed of the Church for a time, thoſe he thinketh may be chāged; or relaxed, or aboliſhed. And as Pope Pius the ſecond ſaid of the ſingle life of the Clergie, that there was good right in times paſt to ordaine it, but now there is better to diſanull it: his Maieſtie thinkes that the ſame ſpeech may be vſed in generall of the moſt Eccleſiaſticall obſeruations, which are brought into the Church without any precept of Gods word. If this diſtinction were vſed for the deciding of the controuerſies of theſe times, and if men would ingenuouſly make a difference betwixt diuine, and poſitiue law, it ſeemes that amongſt godly and moderate men, touching things abſolutely neceſſarie, there would bee no long, or bitter cōtention. For both (as I ſaid euen now) they are not many, and they are almoſt equally allowed of by all which challenge the name of Chriſtian. And his excellent Maieſtie doth hold this diſtinction to be of ſuch moment for the diminiſhing of controuerſies, which, at this time doe ſo vexe the Church of God, that he iudgeth it the dutie of all ſuch as bee ſtudious of peace, diligently to explane it, to teach it, to vrge it. Now will we addreſſe our ſelues to ſpeak of ſome examples which are propoſed in this Obſeruation. Amongſt the things abſolutely neceſſarie, yet not ſimply, but in reſpect of diuine inſtitution, you reckon the baptiſme of infants, which wee (ſay you) doe referre vnto this
                  
                  kinde of neceſſitie. Afterwards you bring a place out of S. Auguſtine, wherein the poſſibilitie of ſaluation of children not baptiſed is preciſely denied. Here, firſt, his Maieſtie profeſſeth that himſelf and the Church of England doe allow the neceſſitie of baptiſme, in reſpect of diuine inſtitution, as wel as you. The Church of England doth not binde the grace of God to the meanes, which is contrarie euen to the doctrine of the better ſort of ſchoolemen: yet becauſe God hath appointed this for the ordinarie way to obtaine remiſſion of ſins in his Church, and Chriſt himſelfe denieth the entrance into the kingdom of heauen to thoſe which are 
                     Iob. 3. 5. not borne againe of water and the Spirit: therefore it is carefully prouided heere by the Eccleſiaſticall lawes, that parents may haue baptiſme for their children at any time, or place. Wherefore, that which Tertullian ſaith of the primitiue Church, that Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons did baptiſe: and laſtly, that the ſame was lawfull for lay men alſo in caſe of extreame neceſſitie; the ſame, as concerning Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, is at this day practiſed in the Church of England, without any rigid or inuiolable obſeruation of whatſoeuer time or place. But for the baptiſme of lay men or women, as by the lawes of the Church it is forbidden to be done; ſo being done according to the lawfull forme, in a manner it is not diſallowed, the Church pronouncing it to be baptiſme, although not lawfully adminiſtred. But his excellent Maieſty doth ſo highly eſteeme of this Sacrament, that when ſome Miniſters in Scotland, pretending I know not what ordinances of new diſcipline, refuſed, vpon the deſire of the parents, to baptiſe infants readie to die, he compelled them to this dutie with feare of puniſhment, threatning no leſſe then death if they diſobeyed. Wherefore the words of S. Auguſtine, which doe preciſely exclude the not baptiſed from eternall life, if they be vnderſtood of the ordinary way thither, and the only way that Chriſt hath taught vs, his Maieſtie hath nothing to obiect againſt that opinion: but if it be ſimply denied that almightie God can ſaue thoſe which die vnbaptiſed, 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
                  
his Maieſtie, and the Church of England abhorring the crueltie of that opinion, doe affirme that S. Augustine was an vnnaturall and hard father vnto infants. Vndoubtedly 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . his Maieſtie thinketh, that both theſe extreames are with the like care to be eſchewed: leſt if wee embrace this rigid ſentence, we abbreuiate the power of God, and offer wrong to his infinit goodneſſe: or, whileſt, as ſome doe, we reckon baptiſme amongſt ſuch things, the hauing, or forgoing whereof is not much materiall, wee ſhould ſeeme to make light of ſo precious a Sacrament and holy ordinance of God. S. Auguſtine was a worthie man, of admirable pietie, and learning, yet his priuate opinions his Maieſtie alloweth not as articles of faith, neither doe you allowe them; for example, Saint Auguſtine beleeued, as did Innocentius the firſt before him, that the receiuing of the bleſſed Euchariſt by infants was no leſſe neceſſarie to their ſaluation then baptiſme, and this he auoucheth in many places of his writings: yet you beleeue it not, neither hath the Church of England changed this point of doctrine which ſhe receiued from you. Amongſt thoſe things which impoſe neceſſitie of action vpon ſome perſons, you number mariage. Siquis ſobolem tollere voluerit: If any man ſay you deſire to haue iſſue. Againe, ſoone after, when you declare the neceſſitie of approbation, you reckon the choice of liuing in virginitie or ſingle life: which things when his Maieſtie read, he diſallowed them not, yet he thought that vnto both examples, ſomething might conueniently be added: for vpon the former it ſeemes to follow, that there is no other neceſſarie cauſe of mariage, ſaue hope of iſſue. But the Apoſtle S. Paul doth teach vs in expreſſe tearmes, that they alſo are bound to prouide for mariage which want the gift of continence. If they containe not, ſaith he, let them marrie. This 1. Cor. 7. 9. addition is of no ſmall moment. For who knoweth not what occaſion is daily miniſtred in the Church of Rome, of many and horrible crimes, through the contempt of this Apoſtolike rule, through the neglect of this neceſſarie remedie? Wherefore in continent perſons his Maieſtie exceedingly

commenceth the liuing in the eſtate of virginitie, or ſingle life: and being by the ſingular mercie of God more familiarly acquainted with the ſacred Scripture, then moſt Princes are, bee knoweth S. Pauls ſentence of the whole matter, and the examples extant in both Teſtaments, and the rewards propoſed to them that containe. But wheras your Diuices doe commonly teach, eſpecially the Doctors of the Canon Law, that fornication, whoredome, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . and other foule ſinnes not to be named, are more tollerable in Miniſters of the Church, then lawfull mariage, and the bed vndefiled: that his Maieſtie accounteth a moſt deteſtable crime, and moſt worthie of the hatred of God, and men. His Maieſtie oppoſeth againſt all the cauils of Sophiſters, yea againſt all humane authoritie whatſoeuer, that oracle, of the holy Spirit, pronounced by the mouth of the Apoſtle; It is better to marrie then to burne. For as a wiſe Captaine ought to be more afraid of receiuing ouerthrow, or loſſe to himſelf, then of weakning his enemie: ſo in the election of a mans life, whether he would lead it maried, or ſingle, his Maieſtie thinks that godly men ought in the firſt place to decline the tranſgreſſion of Gods law, and then on Gods name, if any man haue the power, let him vſe that benefit of nature. It is a thredbare cauill, that England is not a lawfull Church, becauſe here wanteth the practiſe of ſuch vowes. But what can the want of vow hinder, as long as wee are not deſtitute of that which is vowed? For here are many Biſhops, and other Paſtors of the Church, who without oſtentation of vow do abſtaine from mariage, and yet leade their liues chaſtly, and ſaintly, without any taint of common ſiniſter report. Moreouer, for the Monaſteries themſelues, his Maieſtie (as he is moſt earneſtly affected vnto pietie and goodneſſe) would not haue diſſolued them, or not all of them, (as I haue heard him often proteſt) if he had found them vncorrupted, and obſeruing the Canons of their firſt inſtitution. But his excellent Maieſtie often wiſheth that the Tridentine Fathers, which could not bee drawne by the entreaties of great Kings and Princes to

prouide for publike honeſtie on this behalfe, would conſider with themſelues, from what fountaine this doctrine did flow. For whereas at the firſt, ſingle life was placed amongſt profitable orders, and counſels: afterwards vowes were annexed, at length men came to this abſolute neceſſitie, which now raigneth amongſt you, the law of God being abandoned, and moſt vilely diſgraced. Now whereas in the end of this obſeruation it is added, that they which allow of ſome, and reiect other of thoſe things which the ancient Church beleeued as neceſſarie to ſaluation, although vnder diuers kindes of neceſſitie, haue no reaſon to affirme that they retaine the ſame faith and diſcipline with the ancient Catholike Church; his Maieſtie well enough perceiueth the drift of that ſpeech. He anſwereth therefore, that he wil not extol his own Church, by comparing it to a glaſſe without ſpot, or to a face perfectly faire without wrinkle, or blemiſh: he leaueth ſuch Pharaſaiſme to others. Yet that this he knoweth euidently, that if queſtion be made concerning the eſſentiall markes of the Church, or if you looke at thoſe things which are plainly neceſſarie to ſaluation, or reſpect order, and decencie in the Church; you ſhall not finde a Church in the whole world (God be praiſed for it) more approching to the faith, and faſhion of the ancient Catholike. His Maieſtie excepts none, no not the Church of Rome: which by new inuentions deuiſed for increaſe of ſuperſtition, and for the eſtabliſhing of her dominion ouer Princes, and people, hath manifeſtly turned, and changed the faith, and diſcipline of the ancient Catholike, and ſwarued infinitly in many things from the puritie and ſimplicitie of the primitiue Church.
            
            
               THE FOVRTH OBSERVATION.
               WHen question is made touching the faith of the ancient Church, there be ſame, which doe limit antiquitie within one, or two ages after the Church was founded: but it ſtandeth with equitie for examination of the controuerſies of

theſe daies to inſiſt vpon that time, wherein al parties grant that the Church was not only a true Church, but then alſo moſt floriſhing, and poſſeſſed of that glory & brightnes, which the oracles of ſo many Prophets had promiſed. And that is the time wherein the foure firſt generall Councels are included, from Conſtantine the Emperour vnto Marcion. And there is the more equitie in this, becauſe there be ſo few monuments extant of the former ages, but very many of this time wherein the Church floriſhed. So that the faith, and diſcipline of the ancient Catholike may eaſily be knowne out of the writings of the Fathers of that age.
            
            
               HIS MAIESTIES ANSVVERE.
               THis condition will ſeeme vnreaſonable to them which would haue the vniuerſall hiſtorie of the primitiue Church, concluded within the Acts of the Apoſtles, which is but one little, though moſt ſacred and diuine book. The moſt equall and prudent King is farre from this opinion: who in his Monitorie Epiſtle hath ingenuouſly declared how highly he eſteemeth of the Fathers, which liued in the fourth, and fifth age. Neither doth his Maieſtie doubt to pronounce with S. Auguſt▪
                   that look what the Church hath duly obſerued from her firſt originall vnto thoſe times, and for any man to offer to reiect that as impious, it is a point of most inſolent madnes. For his Maieſtie heretofore hath vnfainedly proteſted, that hee approoueth of thoſe markes of truth giuen by Vincentius Lirinenſis: à principio, vbique & ſemper: that is, from the beginning, euery where, and euer. Wherefore, the King, and the Church of England, in that they admit of the foure firſt generall Councels, therein they ſufficiently declare that they conclude not the time of the true, and lawfull Church within the compaſſe of one, or two ages: but that they extend it much further, compriſing the time of Marcion the Emperor, vnder whom the Councell of Chalcedon was kept. But whereas in this obſeruatiō you more eſteeme the times after Conſtantine, then the

times going before, that his Maieſtie thinketh ſomewhat ſtrange, and indeed doth not allow it. He granteth that the Church of the fourth age floriſhed aboue the former in externall glorie, and ſplendure, in wealth, and plentie of learned men: but that the Church of the former ages was equal with it, or excelled as touching the orthodoxall rightneſſe of faith, and ſinceritie of incorrupt diſcipline, he is perſwaded that none can make any doubt. We finde euery where in the holy Fathers of the fourth age, Baſil, Nazianzen, Ierome, Chryſostome, Augustine, and others, moſt grieuous complaints of the faults and ſundrie deprauations of their Churches. Neither can it be doubted, that the further men liued from the firſt originall, the further alſo they departed from the originall puritie, and ſinceritie. Wherefore when there is a ſerious purpoſe to clenſe, and to ſweepe the houſe of God, why ſhould not an eſpeciall regard bee had to the time of the Apoſtles, or the times neere the time of the Apoſtles? It is true indeed, that for the greateſt part of that time the godly Chriſtians did liue in obſcuritie, in pouertie, and miſerie, by reaſon of perpetuall perſecution: yet conſider well, if in this ſenſe alſo it be not better to goe into the houſe of mourning, then into the houſe of mirth. Pouertie and miſerie are called the ſiſters of good minde: riches, and 
                     Eccl. 7. 3. glorie haue not that honourable report. And although many of the writers of thoſe times be loſt, yet ſome are extant, and thoſe worthie of regard. S. Cyprian, that holy Martyr of Chriſt, he alone, if there were none elſe, can better informe vs in the gouernment and diſcipline of the primitiue Church, then many others which liued in the fourth age. Wherefore the ſumme of his Maieſties anſwere vnto this obſeruation, is: that he is well content there ſhould be arguments brought out of the writings of the Fathers of the fourth, and fifth ages; but with this caution, and condition, that thoſe things be allowed for ancient and neceſſarie to ſaluation, which had not their beginning then, but which may be cleerely proued to haue been continually obſerued from the firſt originall of the Church vntill thoſe times.
            
            
               
               THE FIFTH OBSERVATION.
               WHen there is question made about the vnanimitie, and conſent of Fathers, ſome will haue it then to bee manifest, when the matter controuerted is found in all the Fathers in expreſſe tearmes: whoſe opinion being manifestly vniust, it is more equitie for knowledge of conſent of Fathers, that theſe two rules be vſed. Firſt, that the conſent of Fathers ſhould then be thought to be ſufficiently proued, when the worthiest of euery nation do conſent in the auerring of any thing, and that no man accounted orthodoxall doth oppoſe them. So S. Auguſtine when he had praiſed eleuen of the principall writers of former times; and the Fathers of the Epheſine Councell, when they had brought out ten against Neſtorius, they all thought that they had giuen ſufficient testimonie concerning the conſent of the ancient Church. The ſecond rule is this: When the Fathers do not ſpeake as Doctors, nor ſay that this, or that is thus to be done, or thus to bee beleeued: but when as witneſſes of thoſe things which the vniuerſall Church of their times beleeued or practiſed, they affirme this to be the faith or practiſe of that Catholike Church through the whole world: then they are ſo much to be honoured, that ſuch an affirmation must be held ſufficient to proue the vnanimitie, and conſent of the Church.
            
            
               HIS MAIESTIES ANSVVERE.
               IT is an equall demaund, that the parties which contend in theſe times ſhould conſent and agree, how they may vſe profitably the authoritie of the ancient Fathers. For if the teſtimonie and authoritie of the primitiue Church bee taken away, his Maieſtie freely confeſſeth, that on mans 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . part, the controuerſies of theſe times can neuer haue an end, nor by any diſputation be determined. Wherefore that it may be agreed vpon what and how much is to bee attributed to the Fathers, and how farre their authoritie is to take place, it will not be amiſſe that certaine rules be compoſed

by the mutuall conſent of the parties, preſcribing the manner hereof. Amongſt many other profitable and neceſſarie rules for this purpoſe, his Maieſtie thinketh that theſe two which you haue noted, may haue their place. But becauſe the controuerſies of theſe daies are not about ceremonies, and other matters of lighter moment, but about ſome articles of faith, and opinions appertaining to ſaluation: therefore his iudgement is that aboue all there be a generall agreement vpon this rule, that opinions concerning matters of faith, and whatſoeuer ſhould be beleeued as neceſſarie to ſaluation, ought to bee taken out of the ſacred Scripture alone, neither muſt they depend vpon the authoritie of any mortall man, but vpon the word of God only, wherein hee hath declared his will vnto vs by his holy Spirit. Becauſe the Fathers, and the ancient Church had authoritie of deducting articles out of the ſacred Scriptures, and explaning, but of coyning new articles of their owne they had no authoritie. This foundation being laid, both, the maieſtie of the Scriptures inſpired by God ſhal remaine 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . inuiolated, and that reuerence ſhall be giuen to the holie Fathers which is due. That this was the minde of all the Doctors of the ancient Church, it may be eaſily demonſtrated out of their owne writings. For what words more frequent in their workes then theſe? That the doctrine which is taught in the Church of God, ought to bee taken out of the 
                  
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        .
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        .
                   
                  word of God. And theſe: For controuerſies in matters of religion let the Scripture be iudge. Or who knoweth not the golden words of S. Baſil the Great, in his booke De Fide? It is a manifest fall from faith, and argument of preſumption to reiect any thing of the written word, or to bring in any thing which is not written, ſeeing it is the ſpeech of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, My ſheepe heare my voyce. And thus much be ſpoken concerning the obſeruations propoſed.
               Now follow the foure instances. For your illuſtrious honour 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . being come to the hypotheſis, to the end that you might euince that his excellent Maieſtie doth not beleeue thoſe things which the Catholike Church did anciently

beleeue, you goe about to demonſtrate it by foure arguments, drawne from ſuch things as concerne the outward worſhip of God, or the liturgie and matters of daily practiſe in religion: and afterwards you giue this reaſon, why eſpecially you bring theſe inſtances, becauſe if there were agreement concerning theſe, the reſt would bee eaſily agreed vpon. His excellent Maieſtie (moſt illuſtrious Cardinall) could wiſh that this might be hoped for: but conſidering with himſelfe what it is which at this day is vrged by your writers with chiefe care, and eager contention: there appeares no great hope of peace, no not if there were agreement about theſe foure heads which you haue propoſed. For now adaies, there is as eager contention about the Empire of the Biſhop of Rome, as for theſe or any other points of Chriſtian religion. This alone is now made the article of faith whereon all the reſt doe depend. Wherefore what hope remaines but in the goodneſſe, and mercie of God, to whom onely it belongeth of right to cure the maladies of his Church? in him let vs hope, though againſt hope, he will effect it. To returne to the purpoſe, the Inſtances 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . which you bring againſt the Liturgie of the Engliſh Church, they be theſe.
               
                  1. They beleeue not the reall preſence of Chriſt in the ſacred Eucharist.
                  
                  2. They reiect the doctrine of the ſacrifice of the Christian Church.
                  
                  3. They pray not for the dead.
                  
                  4. They condemne the inuocation of Saints which are in heauen.
                  
               
               Vnto theſe foure his Maieſtie anſwereth in few words.
               
                  To the firſt Inſtance concerning reall preſence.
                  IF in the ſacred myſteries of Chriſtian religion, the faithfull ſhould bee thought to beleeue nothing but that, which they perfitly vnderſtand according to the manner,

then ſurely they would be found to be vnbeleeuing in many things, which now they doubt not but that they do moſt firmely beleeue. That Chriſt our Lord is the Sonne of God the Father, begotten of the Father before all worlds: that the ſame Chriſt being very God, did aſſume humane fleſh in the wombe of the bleſſed Virgin: that hee was borne of her without any violation of the virginitie of this mother: that the diuine nature is vnited in the ſame perſon with the humane: theſe things, I ſay, and the like, all Chriſtians doe make profeſſion to beleeue: of whom notwithſtanding if you demaund the manner how they are done, they will anſwere that faith in matters of Theologie is one thing, and humane ſcience is another: and they will religiouſlie alleage Galen, who otherwaies is no good Maſter of religion: whoſe excellent words in his 15. booke De vſu partium, are theſe: How this was done, if you enquire, you will be taken for one that hath no vnderstanding neither of your owne infirmitie, nor of the power of the Creator. And as for the Fathers, 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . how often they dehort vs from this queſtion of the manner, and from curioſitie of explaning the manner in diuine 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . myſteries, I ſhould be too long if I ſhould goe about to rehearſe. You know the words of Gregorie Nazianzene in his firſt oration, De Theologia: You heare the generation of the Sonne, be not curious to know the manner. You heare that 
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     the holy Ghost proceedeth from the Father, be not buſie to enquire how: and the ſame author in another place: Let the generation of God be honored with ſilence: it is much for thee to haue learned that hee was begotten, as for the manner how, wee grant it not to be vnderstood by the Angels, much leſſe by thee. Gregorie had to deale with the Arrians, thoſe peruerſe heretikes, whoſe impious curioſitie he goeth not about to ſatisfie with ſubtiltie of diſputation, but forbiddeth them to ſearch into the manner of ſo great a myſterie, and enioyneth them ſilence. Now if his Maieſtie, and the Church of England doe vſe this godly moderation about the myſterie of the ſacred Euchariſt, I pray you who ought to enuie it? We reade in the Goſpels that our Lord inſtituting this Sacrament,

tooke the bread, and ſaid, This is my body: but that our Lord did ſo much as by one word explane how it was his bodie, we doe not reade. The Church of England doth religiouſly beleeue that which ſhe reades, and with the ſame religion ſhe is not inquiſitiue into that which ſhe reades not. They acknowledge, and teach that this is a great myſterie which cannot be comprehended, much leſſe declared by the facultie of mans wit: but concerning the power and efficacie of it, their opinion is with all ſacred reuerence. They command thoſe which come vnto this holie table diligently to ſearch all the ſecret corners of their conſciences: to make confeſſion of their ſinnes vnto God, and if need be to the Prieſt alſo. They carefully warne the commers that they compoſe their mindes vnto all humilitie, and deuotion: they receiue the Communion of the bodie of Chriſt vpon their knees: and they doe not onely diuide the myſticall bread amongſt the faithfull in their publike aſſemblies, but they giue it alſo to thoſe which be towards death, pro viatico; that is, for victuals in their iourney, as the Fathers of the Nicene Councell, and all antiquitie doe call it. Laſtly, his Maieſtie, although he would haue his to abſtaine from all manner of curioſitie, yet alloweth alſo of whatſoeuer the holie Fathers of the firſt ages haue ſpoken in the honour of that vnſpeakable myſterie. Neither doth he reiect the words of the Fathers, as tranſmutation, alteration, tranſelementation, and ſuch like, if they be vnderſtood 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . and expounded agreeably to their intention. If this doctrine of his Maieſtie, and the Church of England doe not giue you ſatisfaction, then what remaines but that hee yeeld vnto the opinion of Tranſubſtantiation, if he will be friends with you? But that is not piouſly to beleeue the veritie of the thing, but with importunate curioſitie to decree the manner thereof: which the King and his Church will neuer doe, will neuer allow. But his excellent Maieſtie wondreth, that whereas your Honour granteth that you require not primarily the beleeuing of Tranſubſtantiation, but that there be no doubt of the truth of the preſence, 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        .
                     
yet the Church of England hath not ſatisfied you in this point, which in publike writings hath ſo often auouched her beleefe hereof. Wherefore that you may certainly know what is beleeued, and what is taught in this Church concerning that matter, I haue heere ſet downe a whole place out of the right reuerend the Lord Biſhop of Ely his booke againſt Cardinall Bellarmine, which ſome few moneths agoe he publiſhed. Thus he ſaith in the firſt chapter: Our Sauiour Christ ſaid, this is my bodie, not, after this manner is my bodie: whereof the Cardinall is not ignorant vnleſſe willingly, and wittingly. We agree with you concerning the obiect, all the ſtrife is about the manner. Concerning this is, wee beleeue firmely that it is: concerning after this manner it is, to wit, that the bread is tranſubſtantiate into his bodie, after what manner it is done, whether by, or in, or vnder, or beyond, there is not a word in the Goſpell: and becauſe there is no word; therefore we haue reaſon to baniſh it from beleefe. We number it per aduenture amongst the decrees of the ſchoole, but not amongst the articles of faith. That which Durandus is reported to haue ſaid, doth not diſlike vs: we heare the word, we perceiue the ſound, we know not the manner: we beleeue the preſence, we beleeue, I ſay, the true preſence aſwell as you: concerning the manner of the preſence we doe not vnaduiſedly define. Nay more, we doe not ſcrupulouſlie enquire: No more then we doe in Baptiſme how the blood of Christ clenſeth vs: no more then we doe in the incarnation of Christ how the diuine nature is vnited in one perſon with the humane. We reckon it amongst the myſteries (and indeed the Eucharist is a myſterie) the remainders whereof ſhould be conſumed with fire: That is, (as the fathers doe elegantly vnderſtand it) which ſhould be adored by faith, not debated by reaſon. This is the ſaith of the King, this is the faith of the Church of England. Who (that I may ſummarily compriſe the whole matter) doe beleeue that in the Supper of the Lord they are made really partakers of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, (as the Greeke Fathers ſpeake, and as Bellarmine himſelfe confeſſeth) ſpiritually. For by faith they apprehend, and eate Chriſt: and they belecue

that there is no other kind of eating profitable to ſaluation, which all your men alſo haue confeſſed.
               
               
                  To the ſecond Inſtance concerning the ſacrifice in the Chriſtian Church.
                  HIs Maieſtie is not ignorant, neither doth he denie, that in place of the manifold ſacrifices of the Moſaicall law, the ancient Fathers did acknowledge one ſacrifice in the Chriſtian religion. But this he auoucheth to be nothing elſe but the commemoration of that ſacrifice which Chriſt did once offer to his Father vpon the croſſe. Therefore S. Chryſostome, which maketh mention of this ſacrifice as oft as any, vpon the ninth chapter of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, after he hath called it a ſacrifice, ſtraightwaies adioyneth by way of explication, or correction, or rather commemoration of that ſacrifice. That tearme, or rather, what 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . force it hath you know very well. And often hath the Church of England proteſted, that they would not contend about the word, ſo they might obtaine of you to haue the ancient ſaith reſtored. And that theſe things which you practiſe contrarie to the cuſtome of the ancient Church, might be aboliſhed. For it is certaine that the celebration of the Euchariſt without any communicants, and all that merchandiſe of priuate Maſſes, condemned by many of your owne Diuines, tooke their originall from the peruerſe doctrine concerning this ſacrifice. And whereas for the deliuering of the ſoules of the deceaſed from the flames of Purgatorie, the neceſſitie of many Maſſes is vrged, his Maieſtie doubteth not, but that this is a dotage of idle braines, and ſuch as for their owne gaine doe wickedly abuſe the ſimplicitie of the people. Remoue thoſe, and the like groſſe and ſoule abuſes which raigne amongſt you, & the Church of England, which in her Liturgie maketh expreſſe mention of a ſacrifice, can be well content to reſt in the cuſtome of the ancient Church. Wherefore his excellent Maieſtie being lately informed that not long agoe, at a famous aſſemblie

of Dominican Friers, you diſputed learnedly concerning a double ſacrifice, of Expiation and of Commemoration, or religion, hath affirmed, in the hearing of many, that he approued that diſtinction, and commandeth me now to ſignifie ſo much vnto you.
               
               
                  To the third Instance of prayer for the dead.
                  THat it was a very ancient cuſtome in the publike prayers of the Church to make commemoration of the deceaſed, and to deſire of God reſt for their ſoules, which died in the peace of the Church, few are ignorant, much leſſe is it vnknowne vnto his Maieſtie. Neither is there any doubt but that this cuſtome ſprung from a vehement affection of charitie. Likewiſe the ancient Church hereby gaue teſtimonie of the reſurrection to come. This cuſtome, although the Church of England condemneth not in the firſt ages, yet ſhe thinketh not good to retaine it now for diuers and weightie cauſes, ſome whereof I will touch heere. Firſt, becauſe ſhe is verely perſwaded that without any precept of Chriſt, the ſupreme Lawgiuer of his Church, this cuſtome was introducted, neither could the contrarie hitherto bee demonſtrated by any of your Doctors. Wherfore, although his Maieſty doth not take vpon him, as he hath proteſted in his Monitorie epiſtle, to condemne an ordinance which is approued by ye practiſe of the ancient Church, yet he is vndoubtedly perſwaded that his Church is not bound by any neceſſitie to obſerue it. For whatſoeuer the ancient Chriſtian Fathers haue done on this part, all that his Maieſtie reſerreth vnto the head of things profitable, or lawfull: of which wee haue ſpoken in the ſecond obſeruation: neither can it be prooued that this cuſtome is to be referred vnto thoſe things which are of abſolute neceſſitie. For whence ſhould this neceſſitie ſpring? not from the law of God, for he neuer commanded it: and if it flow not from that fountaine, it is no neceſſitie. For wee haue alreadie laid this ground, that nothing ought to be accounted neceſſarie to ſaluation, which is not either expreſſely contained in Gods

word, or thence by neceſſarie conſequence deducted. And wee haue declared, that ſuch things as the ancient Church beleeued, or practiſed without neceſſitie, the ſame ought now alſo to be left with libertie vnto vs. A ſecond reaſon is, that although his Maieſtie acknowledgeth the authors of this cuſtome to haue been very ancient, yet no man hitherto could proue, that ſuch was the vſe in the beginning, and in the Apoſtolike times, which is the fountaine of all antiquitie in the Church. Beſides that, the prayers then vſed doe much differ both in their end, and manner, from theſe which are now practiſed, and taught. A third reaſon is added by his Maieſtie, that when once prayer for the dead tooke place amongſt Church rites, not long after a rout of ſhamefull errours, and doting ſuperſtitions did band together, and breake into the Church. Now let indifferent arbitratours iudge to whom the name of Catholike ſhould be denied: whether to the King, and his ſubiects, which by reaſon of errours enſuing haue left off, or thinke it not lawfull to vſe a cuſtome grounded vpon no neceſſitie: or to your men, which by ſophiſticall cauillations, and incredible obſtinacie had rather maintaine, then reforme all the errors of former ages, though neuer ſo groſſe, and pernicious.
               
               
                  To the fourth Inſtance concerning the inuocation of Saints.
                  COncerning the inuocation of Saints, his Maieſties anſwere is the ſame with his former touching prayers for the dead. From a ſmall beginning (as all men know) it grew to ſuch greatneſſe, that in former ages (and I wiſh it were not ſo now in many places) Chriſtian people haue put more confidence, and hope of preſent aide in Saints, then (ô horrible impietie) in our Sauiour himſelfe: who being in the 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . forme of God, that he might bring ſaluation vnto vs which were his enemies, did emptie himſelfe by taking the forme of a ſeruant, and humbled himſelfe being obedient vnto 
                        Philip. 2. 7. death, euen the death of the croſſe. And when this bleſſed

Sauiour, according to his neuer enough admired goodneſſe and clemencie, doth inuite miſerable ſinners with theſe ſweete words of his Goſpell, Come vnto me all you that are 
                     
                        Mat. 11. 28. 
                     wearie and heauie laden, and I will refreſh you: yet ſome haue endeuoured by the peruerſnes of their wit to fruſtrate this gracious inuitation: and painting Chriſt, who is our onely Aduocate to God the Father, alwaies terrible, and vnmercifull, they would perſwade poore ſoules that there is no way to Chriſt but through the mediation of many Saints. Moreouer, ſome others haue openly taught, that our Sauiour Chriſt hath reſerued the ſeueritie of iuſtice vnto himſelfe, but indulgence and mercie he hath granted to the bleſſed Virgin. Againe, how haue they diſtributed offices, and powers of healing amongſt the Saints with wonderfull curioſitie, or rather deteſtable ſuperſtition? And heretofore their ſuffrages only were deſired, that being gracious with God almightie they would make interceſſion for men: but afterwards, the world was filled with bookes concerning the proper ſeruice of this, or that Saint, and peculiar formes of prayer to be made vnto them. Wherefore in place of that diuine booke of the Pſalter, which the ancient Chriſtians neuer laid out of their hands; which was the ſolace of men and women, yong and old, rich and poore, learned and vnlearned, there haue ſucceeded the Houres of our Ladie, and Legends; or rather impious, and doting fables (I ſpeake not of the true hiſtories of Martyrs) and ſuch vile ſtuffe. And yet further, as if it were not iniurie enough to robbe Chriſtians of ſo neceſſarie and diuine a booke, one of your men hath turned all the Pſalmes to the honour of the bleſſed Virgin, attributing vnto her (as if there were no difference betwixt the creature and the Creator) whatſoeuer was prophecied concerning the onely Sonne of God. His excellent Maieſtie doth extoll the happineſſe of the moſt glorious virgin mother of our Lord, affirming that ſhe is eleuated vnto the higheſt degree of honour, which God the Creator could impart to any humane creature: he reioyceth alſo that the Church of England vpon ſet daies in

the yeere doth ſolemnize the honoured memorie of that moſt bleſſed Virgin: but the Sophiſters of theſe times can by no cunning euer perſwade him to allow, or endure that Pſalter of our Ladie. For as touching Cardinall Bellarmine, which hath lately defended it, his Maieſtie is perſwaded that he is diſtaſted of your owne, as many as haue but any ſmall ſenſe of pietie. Conſidering then that the Church of Rome is almoſt deadly ſicke of ſuch inward diſeaſes, his Maieſtie wondred (moſt illuſtrious Cardinall) when hee read in your epiſtle that the inuocation of Saints, as your men doe now practiſe it, is the ſame which was in vſe in the primitiue Church. Wherefore his Maieſtie anſwereth in few words: Firſt, it cannot be proued that in the beginning of the primitiue Church, any other but the almightie God was inuoked: ſecondly, that there is no precept in the word of God for it, no one footſtep of any example: God onely was adored, God onely was implored through the interceſſion of his onely begotten Sonne, the one and only Mediatour betwixt God and man. Afterwards was brought in the vſe of praying at the ſepulchres of Martyrs: then began the making of apoſtrophees vnto Saints, beſides the worſhip of God: then the making of vowes, and prayers, not primarily to pray them, but that they ſhould pray God. Yet if theſe new examples had gone no further, his Maieſtie would not greatly haue reprooued the cuſtome of thoſe times, at the leaſt not ſo much condemned it as the abuſes which hereupon enſued. For his Maieſtie doth honour the bleſſed Martyrs, and other Saints which now raigne with Chriſt the head of both Churches, triumphant and militant: neither doubteth he of their continuall prayers for the neceſſities of the Church, beleeuing ſtedfaſtly the benefit thereof: but hee confeſſeth ingenuouſly that hee knoweth no reaſon whereby any man can promiſe or warrant vs that they heare our prayers, and that wee ſhould account them as our houſehold gods; and protectors. Wherefore hee exceedingly diſliketh that which followed in after-ages. For by degrees it came to that

which I haue ſhewed, which the Church of England affirmeth to be impious in the extreame. And if there bee examples extant in the Fathers of the fourth age for this inuocation (as no doubt there are, neither doth the King denie it) yet this is a teſtimonie of the decay of ancient ſimplicitie, and of an euill then growing; but in no reſpect comparable with that which in the Church of Rome at this day is openly practiſed, tolerated, and defended. Laſtly, although the holy Fathers did allow the cuſtom of that time amongſt things profitable, or lawfull, yet they neuer accounted of it as a thing neceſſarie to ſaluation, which is the preſent argument of our ſpeech. And thus much concerning the foure obiections againſt the Engliſh Liturgie.
                  Now his Maieſtie commendeth your iudgement, that amongſt all the things which you diſlike in his religion, you haue made choice eſpecially of thoſe which concerne matters of Church aſſemblies, and diuine ſeruice. For the communion of the faithfull conſiſteth much in the publike exerciſes of pietie: and this is the chiefe bond of vnion ſo much deſired by good men. Wherefore if Chriſtians could but agree about this, why might not all Europe communicate together? only, granting a libertie to ſchoole-Diuines with moderation to debate other opinions. Which were a thing much to be wiſhed, and that foundation once laid, by the helpe of God, much hope might be conceiued of the reſt. For this cauſe his excellent Maieſtie greatly commending your iudgement herein, hath himſelfe likewiſe heere deliuered, what things in your Liturgie he thinketh worthie to bee reprooued. But if, for the want of theſe foure things in the Engliſh Liturgie, you think there is iuſt cauſe, that they which vſe it ſhould neither be accounted, nor called Catholikes: then conſider, I pray you, what his Maieſtie may pronounce of the Church of Rome, in whoſe Liturgie (for hee paſſeth other points of your religion) godly men haue obſerued ſo many things manifeſtly repugnant to the word of God, and the ancient Catholike faith. Which things neuertheleſſe the Pope had rather maintaine,

then reforme, when the truth now ſhineth ſo cleerely. And here although his Maieſty could eaſily rehearſe many grieuous abuſes in the Romane Liturgie; yet it pleaſeth him to name only foure, which he oppoſeth to the other foure named by you. The firſt is the vſe of an vnknowne tongue, contrarie to the precept of S. Paul, and the practiſe of the primitiue Church, to whom in their aſſemblies nothing was dearer then the good, and edification of the hearers. Wherefore the Fathers prouided the tranſlation of Scripture into all languages: and, as Epiphanius noteth in the end of his third booke, they had their Interpreters, who, if need were, did tranſlate one language into another, in their 
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     readings, as hee ſpeaketh, that is, when the Scriptures were read vnto the people. Surely, that the things read were generally vnderſtood, this alone is ſufficient proofe, that in moſt of the Homilies of the Greeke and Latin Fathers, wee meete with theſe words, vt audiſtis legi, or, vt hodie lectum eſt: as you heard it read, or as it was read to day. Which if your preachers ſhould ſay, were it not ridiculous? when the poore people vnderſtand nothing that is read out of the Scriptures, notwithſtanding they haue more need then the people of old time. For the ancient Doctors vrged euery one to reade the Bible diligently in their houſes, which now vnder paine of excommunication they are forbidden to touch; vnleſſe they obtaine a diſpenſation. So that the ſacred word of God (I tremble to ſpeake it) hath now the firſt place in the catalogue of bookes prohibited. His Maieſtie knoweth that amongſt you there may be found ſome Bibles tranſlated into vulgar languages: but the Engliſh Prieſts at Do way, which turned the Scripture into Engliſh, haue taught him thus much, that you were conſtrained againſt your willes to make thoſe tranſlations, importunitate haereticorum, by the importunitie of the heretikes, as they of Do way ſpeake. For it is hereſie with theſe men to be deſirous to reade the word of God with ſobrietie, and reuerence. Neither is his Maieſtie ignorant, when Renatus Benedictus Prieſt tranſlated the Bible into French, how the

Popes of Rome troubled him for that fact, and how by their letters they commanded the Biſhop of Paris to endeuour that all the French tranſlations might be extorted from the people. Which without faile they had effected, if there had been no Proteſtants in France. His Maieſtie hath read of late alſo in a booke of a certaine Engliſh Pontifician Prieſt, that prayers vttered in an vnknowne tongue haue a kinde of greater efficacie in them, then if they were vnderſtood. Which ſenſeleſſe dotage was an old heathniſh conceit, and is not the ſingular follie of this Prieſt alone. So the Valentinian heretikes did vſe Hebrew names in their ſuperſtitious myſteries, that they might amaze the ignorant multitude: and, as Euſebius ſpeaketh in the fourth part of his Hiſtorie, the more to astoniſh thoſe that were initiated in their 
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     ſuperstitions. The ſecond abuſe is, the diminiſhing of the holie Sacrament, contrarie to the inſtitution of Chriſt, the example of S. Paul, and the practiſe of the Church, for the ſpace of one thouſand yeeres at leaſt, as Caſſander a learned man confeſſeth. In the third place are priuate Maſſes, where are no communicants. I haue ſaid before that theſe things had their beginning from that peruerſe doctrine concerning the ſacrifice in the Chriſtian Church. Reſtore vs the ancient faith, and the ancient practiſe. In the fourth place his Maieſtie obiecteth the preſent vſe and adoration of Images. The Councell of Trent confeſſeth an abuſe, and the Romane Catechiſme giueth ſome profitable admonition on this behalfe. But what are we the better? the abuſe remaineth, it is approued, maintained, and encreaſeth daily. His Maieſtie omitteth the adoration, and inuocation of Saints: which as it is now practiſed, neither can, nor ought to be excuſed. He omitteth alſo the religious adoration of reliques, which at this day is taught and commanded as a thing neceſſarie, or at leaſt very profitable to ſaluation. Beſide the intollerable abſurditie: as when falſe or ridiculous reliques are obtruded, as the teares of Chriſt, and the milke of our Ladie, and ſuch like. Hee omitteth the licentious boldnes of your preachers, when they ſtray from the word

of God; who ought to bee reſtrained from propounding any doctrine to the people as neceſſarie to ſaluation, which is not drawne out of the diuine oracles, and agreeable to the ancient faith. For that is the wholeſome doctrine which the Apoſtle ſo often commendeth. If there were ſuch a reſtraint, many things now practiſed in the Church of Rome, would fall downe of their owne accord. As the doctrine of Indulgences: as that foppiſh deuice of the intenſiue paines in Purgatorie: by vertue of which intenſion many thouſand yeeres are contained in one minute: as thoſe battologiae, or idle repetition of heedleſſe prayers, vnpleaſing to our Sauiour, as he himſelfe witneſſeth. Then it would no longer be accounted great merit to repeate the Roſarie, or other prayers, and Pſalmes twentie, or fiftie, or an hundred times. If theſe and ſuch like impediments were remoued, religious men ſhould peraduenture finde no iuſt cauſe to abſtaine from your communion. There is another thing which his Maieſtie thought good not to omit, which is written in the end of your Epiſtle: that you will be ſilent concerning the Pope of Rome, becauſe it is manifeſt, to thoſe which haue but meane skill in Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, that the Fathers of the firſt ages, the Councels, and Chriſtian Emperours in all buſineſſe appertaining to religion and the Church, gaue him the preheminence, and acknowledged him the chiefe. That this is all for this point, which your Church requireth to be beleeued as an article of faith, by thoſe whom you receiue into communion. To this his Maieſtie maketh anſwere: and, appealing to your owne vnpartiall minde, he deſireth you to conſider the actions of Romane Biſhops for almoſt ſeuen hundred yeeres paſt. He is loth to ſtirre the remembrance of things noiſome, yet gladly would hee haue you know, that hee is moſt certaine of this: that the late Biſhops of that ſea are ſo vnlike vnto the ancient Popes in ſinceritie of faith, in manner of life, and in the whole courſe and end of their gouernment, that it is altogether vniuſt, things being in this ſtate, to draw arguments from the former ages, and applic them to this

preſent time. Let the forme of the ancient Church be reſtored, and many new lawes heretofore not heard of be aboliſhed. In briefe, let the Biſhop of Rome declare euidently by his actions that he ſeeketh Gods glorie, not his owne; that he hath a care of the peace, and ſaluation of his people: then his Maieſtie, as he hath proteſted before in his Monitorie Epiſtle, will acknowledge his primacie, and be willing to ſay with Gregorie Nazianzen, that he hath the care of the 
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     whole Church. But at this time what the Church of God, eſpecially Kings and Princes, ought to thinke concerning that ſea, his Maieſtie dare referre it to your owne iudgement to determine. For you know what a number of books come abroad daily from Rome, and almoſt all the corners of Europe, in defence of the Popes temporall power, or rather omnipotencie, his dominion, and monarchie ouer all the Kings, and people of the whole earth. You know that Cardinall Bellarmine hath of late written concerning that argument, and ſoone after the death of Henry the Great, hath been bold to publiſh that, which all honeſt men of your owne ſide doe deteſt. I ſay, all honeſt men: for the complices of that conſpiracie doe heartily embrace, and to their power defend it as an oracle from the mouth of the Pope, which cannot erre. Wherefore the Ieſuits of Ingolſtade in a booke lately publiſhed againſt Maſter Iohn Gordon, the Deane of Salisburie, a man nobly borne, and very learned, doe cite teſtimonies out of this booke of the Cardinals, as if it were the conſtant opinion, and conſent of all Catholikes. But I deſire your Honour to conſider whether the ancient Church euer did the like to this, and what will be the iſſue of this madneſſe. Conſider into what danger of vtter ruine they bring the Church of Chriſt, which doe approue, or ſuffer ſuch things as are now practiſed, and taught. For, to conclude, as long as matters ſtand thus with you, and yet you denie that you haue been the cauſe of the diuiſion, it were meere doltiſhnes, and follie to imagine any reconciliation amongſt the diuided mēbers of the Church. The laſt point in your letters was this: that you are able to

demonſtrate cleerely what good conſent there is betwixt the Church of Rome, and the ſeas of the other Patriarches in theſe points which are now in controuerſie. But his Maieſtie thinketh that you may ſpare that labour. For hee knoweth, and ſo doe others that are deſirous to prie into ſuch matters, that not the Weſt Church alone, but the Eaſt alſo, the Churches in the South and North parts of the world haue degenerated farre from the golden ſinceritie of former ages, and peraduenture further then might ſeeme poſſible: but that the reuolting from the ancient faith muſt come to paſſe of neceſſitie, being foretold by the oracles of God. He knoweth alſo how thoſe nations haue daily heaped ceremonies vpon ceremonies, and how for more then theſe thouſand yeeres ſuperſtitious men haue been too preſumptuous in that kinde. But when wee treat of reforming the Church of God, the queſtion is not what the Eaſt Church, or the Moſcouites Church doe practiſe, or beleeue: but this is the queſtion, what the Apoſtles haue taught from the beginning, and what the Catholike Church hath practiſed in her times, and in the ages next following. That, that, is the paterne which the King doth ingenuouſly, and from his heart confeſſe that he would imitate without all exception. Neuertheleſſe, ſuch as are skilfull in Eccleſiaſticall matters, they will not grant you this neither: that the doctrine of the Romane Church doth agree in all points with that which is taught in the Churches of other Patriarches. For to omit your worſhipping of Images, your fire of Purgatorie, your preciſe obſeruation of ſingle life, and the infinite power of the Pope, euen aboue Councels: to ſay nothing of theſe, and other articles: yet it is manifeſt that in the celebration of the ſacred Euchariſt, the Grecians doe much differ from you Romanes. In ſo much that Marcus the Archbiſhop of Epheſus ſpeaking of the Romane Maſſe, doth affirme that in matters of greateſt moment it is contrarie to the word of God, and the ancient Liturgies. It is manifestly repugnant (ſaith he) to the axpoſitions and interpretations which wee haue receiued by
                     
                     tradition, and to the words of our Lord, and to the meaning of thoſe words. And of thoſe which defend the Romane rites concerning this matter, the ſame Marcus pronounceth, that they deſerue to be pitied both in regard of their double ignorance, and their profound ſottiſhneſſe. But thus much is enough for this preſent. Now you haue heard (moſt Illuſtrious Cardinall) the reaſons wherefore his excellent Maieſtie of great Britaine; after the reading of your letters, doth, neuertheleſſe truſting in the mercie of God, beleeue, and maintaine that he, and his Church are Catholike. Who if he were not inflamed with an infinit deſire of furthering the publique peace, or if he ſuppoſed that you were otherwaies affected, he would haue ſpared the labour of this anſwere. Eſpecially, becauſe his Maieſtie calling to minde the daily writings and practiſes of your men, is now (as I ſaid before) ſtedfaſtly perſwaded that through their dealings there remaine no meanes or hope of reconciliation. For they are reſolued to defend all; and not to grow better, or by the ſerious reformation of things depraued to winne the mindes of the godly. In which reſolution as long as they perſiſt, and will not yeeld one iot to antiquitie, and truth, his Maieſtie profeſſeth once for all that he regardeth them not, neither will hee euer haue any communion with the Church of Rome. So his Maieſtie humbly prayeth to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that he would vouchſafe to direct thoſe excellent gifts of minde, which he hath plentifully beſtowed vpon you, to the honour of his name, and the benefit of his Church. And I humbly take my leaue of your Honour.
