FALL OF
King Nabuchadnezzer.

            Printed by Thomas Scarlet,

               Dan. 4. 28.
               
                  28 While the word was in his mouth, a
voice came from heauen, ſaying. O
King Nabuchadnezzer, to thee
be it ſpoken, thy kingdome is departed
from thee.
                  29 And they ſhal driue thee from men
and thy dwelling ſhall be with the
beaſtes of the field, they ſhall make
thee to eate graſſe with the Oxen,
and ſeuen times ſhall paſſe ouer thee,
vntill thou knoweſt that the moſt
higheſt God beareth rule ouer the
kingdomes of men, and giueth to
whomſoeuer he will.
                  30 The verie ſame houre was this
thing fulfilled vpon Nabuchadnezzer,
and hee was driuen from
men, and did eate graſſe as the

Oxen, and his body was wet with the
dew of heauen, till his haires were
growne as Eagles fethers, and his
nayles as birdes clawes.
               
            
            
               FRom the 26. verſe,
to the end of this
chapter, is layde
downe the pride,
fall, and reſtitution
of Nabuchadnezzer.
The two firſt verſes are like a banner
of his pride, which ſhewe him
in his ruffeling as it were in the
aire, before he knewe God, or him
ſelfe. The three next verſes are the
diſcouerie of his ſhame, which
ſhew him in his miſerie, as it were
groueling on the groūd, after God
had cooled his courage. The foure
laſt verſes are the celebration of his
recouerie, which ſhew him in holines

as it were rapt into heauen, &
ſinging with the ſaints for ioy, that
God had brought him vnto his
knowledge, thogh it were through
ſhame and trouble, and loſſe of all
that he had ſeuen yeeres togither.
Of his pride we haue heard alreadie:
yet becauſe we are friendes to
vices, as we are to men, ſo long as
they proſper and floriſh, but when
they decay and fal, then we ſhrink
away, and are aſhamed of them: ſo
it may be, if ye could ſee pride take
a fall, though yee loue her well
yet ye would forſake her, like a
banquerout, when yee ſee that ſhe
can pleaſure you no longer. Therefore
ye ſhall ſee Nabuchadnezzer
vpon his feete againe: before you
beheld him vppon his knees, that
when ye ſee what a king he was in
his galleries, and after find his ſeruants

in his palace, and his ſubiects
in his throne, & himſelf like a beaſt
in the wilderneſſe, God may giue
you heartes to thinke a little of this
ſinne, what it is which coſt ſo dere,
and is as common now in euerie
houſe, as it was then in the Kings
court.
            
               After twelue moneths (sayth Daniel)
that is, twelue moneths after
GOD had warned this king by
dreames and by Daniel, to repent
his ſins, he was ſtrouting in his galleries,
and thought what ſin ſhould
bee next, as though hee had neuer
heard of dreame or Prophet.
            By this computation of ſinne,
wherein the moneths are obſerued
ſo exactly, howe long Nabuchadnezzer
rebelled after hee was warned,
Daniel ſhewes what a reckoning
God keepes of our moneths,

and weekes and daies, which hee
giues vs to repent, as he did to Nabuchadnezzer,
& what an account
wee ſhall make of them, as Nabuchadnezzer
did, though we count
no more of our age then the childe
doth of his youth, & haue done no
more of our taſke at twentie then
when we were but ten, nor at thirtie
then when we were but twenty,
nor at fortie then when wee were
thirtie, yet we ſhall giue account of
mo hours in the day of iudgement,
& it ſhall be heauier to the old than
to the young, to you which haue
the word, then to them which want
it: and there is great ods betweene
Nabuchadnezzer and vs, for hee
which challenged Nabuchadnezzer
for twelue moneths ſince hee
was warned, may challenge vs of
twelue yeres ſince we wer warned,

and yet wee looke not for ſo great
puniſhment as fel vpō Nabuchadnezzer
for twelue moneths. Daniel
names three twelue moneths, as
though he would ſpeake of a great
matter, and ſhewes how worthie
Nabuchadnezzer was to be puniſhed,
becauſe he might haue reformed
his life ſince he was warned:
for there were twelue moneths betweene
his dreams and his baniſhment.
But that yeare wherein hee
had ſo manie warninges and teachinges,
was as vaine as the reſt, and
vainer then the yeares before: for
now he ſhould haue bin a mourner
like the king of Niniuie, whē Ionas
threatned deſtruction vnto them.
            But like a victor of a countrie
returned from battell, to ſolemnize
his triumph, firſt hee decked his
pallace as braue as himſelfe, and

then hee walkes his ſtations in it,
and when he hath ſet all things before
him, which might make him
forget God, and hoiſt himſelfe
in pride, like a ſerpent that would
burſt vnleſſe he diſcharged ſome of
his poyſon, hee breaketh out and
ſaith, Is not this great Babel, which
I haue built by the might of my power,
for the honour of my maieſtie? Wherin
obſerue firſt what a glorious
opinion this vaine king had of
his vaine buildinges. Secondly,
how that hee names himſelfe the
founder of them, as though he had
done all without an helpe. Thirdly,
that in all his workes hee ſought
nothing but vain-glorie, as he witneſſeth
againſt himſelfe, ſaying:
which I haue built for the honour of my
maieſtie, not for the honor of Gods
maieſtie, but for the honour of my

maieſtie. So firſt that which hee
ſhould haue contemned, as Chriſt
did the beautie of the temple, hee
admired it,Math. 24 2 and nothing ſeemed
ſo glorious to him, as that which
made him ſhamefull to God. Secondly,
that Citie which was built
by Semiramis, he arrogateth to him
ſelfe, and neuer ioyned the chiefe
workemaiſter with him, but ſaith
which I haue built by the might of my
power, when hee ſhould haue ſayd,
by the might of Gods power.
                  
                     •
                  sal. 127. 1. For
vnleſſe God build the houſe, the
builders (saith Dauid) buildeth
but in vaine.Kin. 4 10.
            
            Laſtly, that which hee ſhould
haue builte for the honour of
God, as the man built a chamber
for the Prophet, he builded for his
own honor, as our Nabuchadnezzers
do. Therfore when al his pleaſures

were prepared like a feaſt, and
he came to ſit downe at the banket,
it happened to him as to the churle
in the Goſpell, after hee had filled
his barnes, when hee came to ſing
in his hart, be merrie my ſoule, that
night his ſoule was taken from him
and the deuills made merrie with
it in hell: ſo hee had feathered his
neaſt, and beganne to crowe vpon
his roofe, Is not this great Babel, &c.
As if hee ſhould ſaie, Now Nabuchadnezzer,
make thee merrie,
that houre his honour was taken
from him, for a voice came downe
from heauen like the terrible hand
which wrote vpon the wall, when
Baltazar ſate at his banquet, and
daſht his pride vppon ſuch a rock,
that within an houre all his pomp
and pleaſures and treaſures, ſuffered
ſuch a ſhipwracke, that his

that his fall was more admired of
all, than his glorie and buildinges
were admired of himſelfe. Thus all
the ioy, and pleaſures, and glorie of
pride are ſpoken with a breath, and
ſtopt with another.
            Yo
                  •
                 haue heard what the voice
ſpake from earth, now you ſhall
heare what the voice ſounds from
heauen. Theſe three verſes following
declare this Kinges fall, when
and how, and from whome it was.
While the wordes were yet, &c. there is
the time. A voice, &c. there is the
iudge. O king, &c. there is the arraignment,
Thy kingdome, &c. there
is the iudgement, He was driuen from
men, & liued with beaſts in the wildernes,
till his haires were growen like Eagles
feathers. There is the execution
and maner of his puniſhment. Firſt
of time, While, &c.
            
            
               
As Daniel obſerued the time
when Nabuchadnezzer ſinned, ſo
he obſerueth the time when Nabuchadnezzer
is puniſhed, as if
God had lien in wait to catch him
in his words, & take him at the trip:
euen as hee watched Lots wife,
when ſhe looked backe,Ge. 14 and transformed
her into a piller of Salte, ſo
ſoone as ſhee looked behinde. So
now the Lord laie as it were in the
ſcout, to watch when Nabuchadnezzer
ſpake treaſon, and to apprehend
him vpon it. O Nabuchadnezzer,
thou haſt vaunted theſe twelue
moneths, ſince I warned thee, and
I made as though I heard not, but
ſuffered thee to doe and ſpeake thy
pleaſure, and vaunteſt thou ſtill?
Surely, thou ſhalt ſcape me no longer,
I will not heare a worde more
againſt mine honour: ſo hee cut

cut him off while the wordes were
in his mouth, and propundeth the
wordes of iudgement againſt him.
If you marke the time when the
voice ſpake from heauen, you may
ſee three wiſedomes of God, firſt
God takes him in his fault, that hee
might ſee his falt,
                  
                     •
                  . Kin. 13 4. as Ieroboam was
ſtroken when hee ſtroke the Prophet,
that he might knowe why he
was ſtroken. Then he takes him ſodenly,
becauſe hee contemneth his
warning, as the fire came vpon Sodome
while they contemned Lots
warning.Gen. 19 24 Thirdly, God takes him
where he is pleaſantest, & luſtiest, &
ſafeſt, in his pallace, which was lyke
a caſtle, as hee tooke Herod, when
his gard ſtod by him,Acts. 12. 23. that he might
ſee that nothing can garde him
from God, but God muſt garde
him from danger, or elſe Princes

be not ſafer than ſubiects: ſo thogh
a man ſin often, and ſteale his ſins
as it were without puniſhment, yet
at the laſt he is took napping while
the wickednes is in his hand: as the
Iewes were,Num while the quailes were
in their mouthes, and his day is ſet
when he ſhall pay for al, whether it
be after twelue moneths, or twelue
yeares, whenſoeuer it commeth, it
will ſeeme to ſoone. Vengeance
doth ſtay till ſinne be ripe, & watch
the time when they are moſt occupied:
then iudgement ſteps foorth,
like the Angell to ſtoppe Balaam
in his way.Num Becauſe the puniſhment
is more terrible and greeuous
when they looke not for it (for the
worſt that is, wiſh like Balaam to
die the death of the righteous)
therefore God will croſſe them in
that: though they proſper alwaies

before, yet their endes ſhall bee a
kinde of iudgement vpon all theyr
lyfe, and a propheſie of torment,
for all men to ſee what becomes of
the wicked after death, that they
may feare to bee lyke vnto them.
As when we ſee ſome ſtriken dead
while they forſweare themſelues at
the barre: ſome fall downe vnder
the table, while they ſit ſwilling at
the wine: ſome ſtriken dumbe in
the pulpit, while they preache vntruths:
euen as the Philiſtines were
ſlaine while they feaſted: and as
Herod was ſhamed while he vaunted:Act. 12 23
and as Ieroboam was ſtriken
while he ſtroke.1. Kin 13. 4 What doeth this
teach vs, but that our ſinnes depart
from vs, ſo ſoone as they are done,
vnto the iudge, and there they accuſe
vs, as Cains murther cried out
againſt him, ſo ſoone as hee ſlewe

his brother,Gen. 4 I know thy words, ſaith
God:Reu. 3 15 hee may ſaie, I knowe thy
wordes and thy thoughts too. For
Iudas coulde not goe ſo cloſely about
his trecherie,Mat. 26 14 15, 16 but that Chriſt
did knowe when his thought entered
into his heart, and hearde
when hee conferred alſo with the
Scribes, and ſawe likewiſe when
he tooke the bribe, though he kept
a time to puniſh him, as hee ſayth
in the ſeuen and thirtie Pſalme the
ſecond verſe: When I ſee a conuenient
time, then will I execute
iudgement.
            Now the time was come, when
this king ſhould be made an example
vnto all other kinges after him,
to amend their liues and reforme
their realme. When the Prophet
commeth from God vnto them,
to tell them what they ſhould doo,

when dreame & Daniel had done
what they could: nowe God calles
foorth his iudgementes and bids
them ſee what they can do, & commands
them to chaſe Nabuchadnezzer,
vntil he haue loſt his kingdom,
vntill hee be driuen out of his pallace,
vntill hee be fled into the wildernes,
vntil he be degenerat like a
beaſt, vntill his ſubiects & ſeruants,
and pages, make their ſport, & gaze
and wonder at him, like a foole
which goeth vnto the ſtockes, or a
treſpaſſer, which is gazed at vppon
the pillorie: So this king was debaſed,
when God heard him but
vaunt of his buildings.
            Therefore let vs take heede, and
be carefull, after what ſorte wee
ſpeake, and what wordes ſlip from
vs, leaſt God take vs in our lies, or
othes, or ſlanders, or ribauldrie, as

he took Nabuchadnezzer, when his
toong walked without a bitt: for if
he had ſuppoſed that God had bin
ſo neare, and that hee would haue
aunſwered him as hee did, hee
would haue held his peace, and laid
his hand vppon his mouth, rather
then pay ſo deare fo
                  •
                a vaine word,
which did him no good when it
was ſpoken.
            The ſecond note is of the iudge.
A voyce came downe from heauen: the
controuling voice came downe
from heauē
               ▪ God is moſt offended
with our ſinne: for Nabuchadnezzer
might haue ſpoken more than this,
before any other man: and no man
could controll him, becauſe he was
a king: and kings delight in greater
vanities than buildings, yet no man
ſaith, why doeſt thou ſo: becauſe
Salomon ſayth:Pro 
               He which repeateth

a matter, ſeparateth the Prince, that is,
he which tells Princes their faulte,
maketh them his enemies: therefore
ſince Iohn Baptiſt died, onelie
God is lefte to reproue almoſt all
that ſinne by authoritie, yet one is
in heauen hath an eare & a tongue,
and cheeketh the king as boldly as
euer the king checketh his ſubiects.
When the voice from earth ſpake
vainely, the voice from heauen
ſpake iudgement. Heere is the king
of heauen againſt the king of earth,
the voice of God againſt the voice
of man: a diuine wrath, warring
with a humane pride: the fire is
kindled, woe to the ſtubble. The
Lord of hoſts is in arms againſt the
Lord of Babel, and begins to laie
hands on him, and to thruſt him
out of his throane. Firſt hee rattles
him like a thunder, O king Nubuchadnezzer,
               
as if he ſhuld ſaie▪ for all
thou art a king, thou ſhalt ſee whether
another be aboue thee. Now
garde thy perſon, now defend thy
honor: for he whom thou haſt deſpiſed,
threatneth to take thy kingdome
from thee: go now & walke
in thy gallery, fetch one turne more
before thou be turned out of dore,
and walke with the beaſtes in the
forreſt. Now hee comes to the arraignment,
& cals him to the bar, O
king Nab. to thee be it ſpoken: he was
neuer called king with leſſe reuerence,
nor had ſuch pay for ſinne in
all his raigne. God giues him his title,
but he tells him his lot, he calles
him king, but without a kingdom,
as if he ſaid, late king of Babel, hold
vp thy hand, here a king is araigned
in his own kingdom, & no euidēce
giuen againſt him, but as though

he had witneſſed againſt himſelfe,
as all ſinners do, God condemneth
him out of his own mouth, and to
open his eares, hee calleth him by
his owne name, O king Nabuchadnezzer,
as the priſoner is called whē
he holdes vp his hand at the barre.
Then hee pronounceth the iudgement,
To thee be it ſpoken, to thee
which aduanceſt thy ſelf like God,
to thee which wouldeſt not take
heed by the dreame, to thee which
wouldſt not be warned by the prophet,
to thee which didſt all for
thine own honor. Now hearken to
thy iudgement, Thy kingdome is departed
from thee, thou ſhalt be driuē
out of thy pallace, they which
ſhoulde honour thee ſhall expulſe
thee, thou ſhalt raigne with the
beaſts in the deſart, there ſhalbe thy
dwelling ſeuen yeares, go now and

ſtalke in the woods, as thou didſt in
thy pallaces, and when thou art
among the lions and wolues, and
Beares, looke vnto Babell which
thou haſt built. Howe doth this
ſpeech differ from Nabuchadnezzers
ſpeeche? his wordes were but
words, but Gods wordes were, He
ſpake, and it was done.Genes
                     〈…〉
                  
                For in the
ſame houre that which was ſpoken
was done (ſaith Daniel) and whatſoeuer
the ſame voyce threatneth
vnto our ſinnes or vnto the ſinner,
ſhall be done at firſt or at laſt. To
Nabuchadnezzer it was ſayd, Thy
kingdome ſhalbe taken from thee: to vs
it is ſaid, Thy life ſhalbe taken from
thee: to him it was ſaid, Thou ſhalt
be thruſt forth into the deſart: to vs it
is ſaid, Thou ſhalt be thrown forth
into darkeneſſe: to him it was ſaid,
Thou ſhalt be like beaſtes: to vs it is

ſaide, Thou ſhalt be like the damned.
Shall not the voice ſpoken to
vs be remembred with God, aſwell
as the threatning menaced to him?
            This voyce came from heauen,
and therefore it ſpake home, not
like them which glide by the faults
of Princes, and whiſper behinde
their backs, as though they would
reproue them if they durſt, but for
feare leaſt the Prince, or Councellour,
or Iudge, or Magiſtrate,
ſhould take it as hee meanes it, and
think that he aimes at them, which
makes them ſpeake in parables, as
though they woulde caſt a vaile ouer
their reproofe, and eate their
meſſage before they haue ſpoken
it. The holy ghoſt teacheth vs here
to reproue, ſo that whoſoeuer ſinneth,
may know, that thou ſpeakeſt
to him. Hee which ſpeaketh from

heauen (as this voyce did) muſt
ſpeake like Iohn Baptiſt among the
Publicanes and harlottes, and ſoldiers,
as though he went from one
to another, and ſaide, this is ſpoken
to thee, this is ſpoken to thee,
this is ſpoken to thee. For vnleſſe
wee come neere this mortall Gods
and proude Nabuchadnezzers,
as neere as Elias came to Achab,
when hee said, It is thou that troubleſt
Iſrael,
               1. Kin.
                     〈…〉
                  
                they will poſt it ouer,
and thinke that thou ſpeakeſt not
to them, vntill thou ſpeakeſt plainly,
as the voyce ſpake from heauen,
To thee be it ſpoken. And then
they will reforme the matter, or
elſe God ſhewe ſome iudgement
vppon them, as hee did heere vpon
this great King Nabuchadnezzer.
Nowe the decree goeth
foorth, that Nabuchadnezzer

ſhall be king no more. Thy kingdom
is departed from thee. This is ſuch a
ſaying, as if Nabuchadnezzer had
thought of it before, hee woulde
haue wept when hee vaunted, to
thinke that his honour was going
from him, when he thought it was
comming to him: yet his kingdom
was not departed from him, & yet
God ſayth, Thy kingdome is departed
from thee, becauſe thy decree was
paſt, which ſhoulde as ſurely come
to paſſe, as if it were paſt alreadie,
Therefore becauſe we care not ſo
long as the Prophet ſaith, we ſhall
die, we ſhall ſuffer, we ſhal anſwer,
he leaueth Shall, and ſayth Now, as
God ſayd to Abimelec: Thou art a
dead man,
               
                  
                     •
                  ene. 20 3 not thou ſhalt die, but thou
art dead, which rouſed him more,
then if hee had threatned him an
hūdred deaths, becauſe he thought

that he ſhould die preſently: ſo the
holy Ghoſt is forced as it were to
exceede, and ſpeake more than we
thinke hee ſhoulde ſpeake, for the
hardnes of our hearts, which heare
like ſtones, and go like ſnails. If we
haue but a weeke to repent, we will
defer it to the laſt day, that we may
ſinne all the reſt.
            Therefore it was meete to ſay,
Thy kingdome is departed from thee.
That ſeeing his iudgement ſhould
not ſtay, hee ſhould not ſtay his repentance.
If this voice had ſaide,
Thy Babell ſhall ſinck, as Nemrods
Babel did, it ſeemeth hee woulde
haue thought his honour buried,
but when he was ſtript, not only of
his pallace, but alſo of his kingdome,
what heauy newes was this
vnto him, which thought himſelfe
equal with God, and now may not

be a king. But when hee was thruſt
among beaſts to eat graſſe with oxen,
what a downfull was this to be
brought vnder all his ſubiectes,
which ſpake euen nowe as though
there none but he: and now his ſeruauntes
ſeruant would not be like
vnto him? So the king of kings wil
be honoured of kinges, as they are
of their ſubiects, or els he wil tread
vpon their crownes, and they ſhall
heare the ſame at laſt, Thy kingdome
ſhall depart from thee. Now followeth
the execution of this iudgement,
for Daniel ſaith, The ſame
houre all this was fulfilled. So he ſheweth
the order of it: as a priſoner is
brought to the barre, and lead to
gybbet, ſo this king was drawne
from his throne, and turned into
the wilderneſſe, where hee abode
among wilde beaſtes ſo long, Till

his haires were growne like Eagles
feathers, and his nayles like Birdes
clawes.
            
            When God began, hee made
haſte, it was long before hee ſpoke,
but when he ſpoke, hee did it, and
effected in an houre all that the
dreame, and the Prophet had foretold.
Then was fulfilled, The pride
of man ſhall bring him low: Euen in
that houre that Nabuchadnezzer
aduanced himſelfe more then before,
in the ſame houre hee was
brought vnder al his ſubiects, al his
ſeruantes and pages: ſo hee which
ſetteth vp can pull down, he which
gaue can take, he which made can
deſtroy.
            Therefore let no man vaunt
though he were a king of his houſe
or land, or farme or children, but
knowe that he ſhoulde haue nothing,

if God did not regarde him
more than other: and thinke when
thou doeſt reade this ſtorie, whether
thou be not as proude of thy
welth, as Nabuchad. was of his pallace:
whether thou be not as proud
of thy children, as Nabuchadnezzer
was of his kingdome: whether
thou bee not as proude of thy
parentage, as Nabuchadnezzer
was of his honour: whether thou
be not ſo proud of thy learning, as
Nabuchadnezzer was of his traine.
If thou be not ſo proud, then God
doth ſay no more, O king, to thee be
it ſpokē, O ſubiect to thee be it ſpoken,
theſe bleſsings ſhall be taken from
thee, For, hath God taken no mans
kingdome from him but Nabuchadnezzers?
Hath hee taken no
mans office from him but Iudas?
hath he taken no mans riches from

him but Iobs? how did Antiochus
and Iulian, and Herod, and Saul,
and Athalia, and Iezabel, and Richard
the third goe from theyr
thrones, as if God had pulled them
out by the eares: he had no reſpect
vnto their perſons, but vſed them
like beaſts, as hee did Nabuchadnezzer,
& fulfilled his threatning.
The candle of the wicked ſhall be
put out. Therefore as Chriſt ſaith
vnto them which turne backe, Remember
Lots wife: ſo I ſay to them
which beare high minds, & proud
lookes, and ſtout wordes, remember
king Nabuchadnezzer, howe
God reſiſteth the proud. Now if
anie man long to be reſolued, how
this king was changed to a beaſt,
he muſt not imagine anie ſtrange
metamorphoſis, or popiſh tranſubſtantiation,
as though his ſhape

were altered, or his manhoode remoued,
or that he put on hornes &
hoofe, as the Poets faine of Acteon,
for the voice doth not ſaie that
he ſhould become a beaſt, but that
he ſhould dwell with the beaſtes.
Daniel doth not ſaie that his head
or arms, or legs were tranſformed,
but that the haire of his head & the
nailes of his fingers did grow lyke
Eagles feathers, & like birds claws,
as euerie mans haire and nayls wil
if he do not pare them. Laſtly, Nabuchadnezzer
ſayth not, that his
ſhape was reſtored vnto him, but
that his vnderſtanding was reſtored
vnto him: all which declare
that he was not changed in bodie,
but in minde: not in ſhape, but in
qualitie. A ſauage minde came on
him,Genes. 4 12 like that which droue Caine
from the companie of men, and he

became like a Satire or wild man,
which differeth not from a beaſt
but in ſhape: though hee was not
tourned to a beaſt, yet this was a
ſtrange alteration, to bee ſo changed
in an houre, that his nobles
abhorred him, his ſubiects deſpiſed
him, his ſeruants forſooke him,
none woulde companie with him
but the beaſts. Conſider this all
that aduaunce themſelues agaynſt
God and deſpiſe his word, as Nabuchadnezzer
did. Take warning
by a king, which euen now walked
in his galleries, and his nobles
ſerued him in his pallace, with all
diſhes that the aire, or ſea, or lande
could affoord: now he is turned to
graſe and feede like an oxe with
the beaſts in the wilderneſſe. This
was to ſhew that God maketh no
more account of the wicked then

of beaſtes, and therefore the holie
Ghoſt calleth them often by the
name of beaſts: ſhewing how that
ſinne and pleaſure make men lyke
beaſts, whē they haue abuſed their
wits often, and peruerted their reaſon,
at laſt God taketh their vnderſtanding
from them, and they become
like beaſtes, loathſome to
themſelues and others: many ſuch
beaſts we haue ſtil like Nabuchadnezzer,
who were fitter to liue in
the deſart among lions, wher they
might not annoy others, then in
townes amongſt men, where they
infect more then the plague. Thus
if you haue not conſidered the
beaſtlines of ſin, looke vppon Nabuchadnezzer,Genes. 4 12
like a beaſt. If you
would ſee the guilt of it, looke vppon
wandering Cain,1. Sa. 16. 14 If thou woldeſt
ſee the frenſie of it, looke vpon

frantike Saul. If thou wouldeſt ſee
the feare of it, loke vpon trembling
Baltazar.Dan. 3.
                     〈…〉
                  
                If thou wilt ſee the ſhame
of it,Heſter. 
                     〈…〉
                  1 looke vpon Haman hanging
vpon his owne gallowes. If thou
wilt ſee the end of it, looke vppon
the glutton frying in hell.Luke. 1
                     〈…〉
                  2 Theſe
are the pictures of ſin, which God
hath ſet for a terror before vs: like
the piller of ſalte,Gene. 1
                     〈…〉
                  2 or Achans ſepulchre
to ſpeake to vs. Take heed by
thoſe,Ioſua. 
                     〈…〉
                  2 when I haue warned you, as
I warned them, I will puniſh you,
as I puniſhed them.
            This is the Epitaph, as it were,
which God ingraueth vppon Nabuchadnezzers
ſepulchre.
            Be thou an example to kings and rulers,
for all the children of pride to beware
how they ſette themſelues againſt
him who aduanced them.
            Thus he which ſets vp, can pull

down. Did not I ſend thee dreams
to warne thee? Did not I ſende a
Prophet to warne thee? If either of
them would haue ſerued, thou
mighteſt haue ruled ſtill, and walked
in thy galleries, and feaſted in
thy pallace, and iudged vppon thy
throne, and died a king: but now
thy kingdome is departed from
thee, who woulde bee like Nabuchadnezzer,
now the king is like a
beaſt? If this heathen was thus
challenged for his warning, which
had heard but one Prophet, wee
may tremble to thinke what wee
ſhall aunſwere for our warninges,
which haue bin threatned as often
as the Iſraelites, & yet prouoke the
Lord whil he ſerueth vs, like thoſe
which curſe the ſunne while it ſhineth
vpon them.
            Thus haue you ſeene the fall of

pride. Euen now he ſaid, Is not this
great Babel? Now he may ſaie: Is
not this vnhappie Babel? euē now
he ſayde, Which I haue built by the
might of my power: and now he may
ſaie, which I haue built by the vanitie
of my pride: euen now hee
ſaid, for the honor of my maieſtie: now
he may ſaie,, for the ruine of my
kingdome: yet after this he roſe againe,
and came to himſelfe, and
receiued his kingdome, and honored
him which puniſhed him ſo:
but the time will preuent mee to
ſpeake of his reſtitution, therfore
here I end.
            FINIS.
