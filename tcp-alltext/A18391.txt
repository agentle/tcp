               IT is now three whole yeeres I appealed to your iudgment in a matter of difference and controuerſie betwixte a minister of your owne makinge, or allowance att least, Mr. Francis Maſon, and my ſelfe; concerninge the vocation and conſecration aswell of your owne perſon,

as of all the reſt of the proteſtant Bishops and miniſters in England. And thoughe hitherto I haue receiued no notice of anie Sentences geuen by you in this Controuerſie (becauſe for ſeeinge as I ſuppoſe, that you cannot paſſe your Sentēce thereupon, without preiudice either of your owne interest, or reputation, you willinglie diſſemble the matter) yett am I moued to demaunde your iudgment in another difference, betwixt another miniſter of yours, Mr. Richarde Pilkinton, and my ſelfe. For where as I ſett forth fiue yeeres a goe a briefe Manuall of Controuerſies, contayninge onlie ſeauen sheetes of Paper, proouinge all the cheefest heades of controuerſie by Scriptures only; he, this last yeare, to croſſe the ſame, hath printed a fowle great booke of fifty sheetes, callinge it, Parallela. Which booke he dedicateth to you. In whoſe Epistle Dedicatorie, thoughe there be as manie falſities and impertinencies, as there are in ſo manies lines of the rest of his booke; yet shall they paſſe without other touch in particular, then this generall reprehenſion (as either refutinge themſelues, or not worthy refutinge of purpoſe) only I cannot omitte theſe brauinge wordes of his which followe. This popiſh agent (he meaneth the author of the Manual) I haue vndertaken, and ſtripped him of his armour, which he hath vſurped, ſhewinge his proofes to be as weake, as his poſitions are wicked, that his blinde religion may appeare vnto all to be nothinge but an heape of vntruthes
               
               without patronage of holy Scriptures. Which encounter I nowe offer vnto the viewe of the world, vnder the ſhield of your graces protection, who firſt encouraged mee to this battell, and canne beſt of all men iudge (as the moſt experienced generall in this ſacred warfare) on which ſide the truth propendeth. In which wordes he doth not onlie vainlie bragge of the victorie alreadie achieued, but alſo acknowledgeth to haue receiued this taske from you, and perferringe your iudgment of his trauells before all other mens, offereth his booke vnto you, nothinge doubtinge either of your approbation or protection. Therefore haue I made free choice of you for vmpiere betwixt him and me, to iudge whether he hath indeede stryped me of myne Armour, as he braggeth, & whether his proofes or myne be ſtronger, and more pertinent to the purpoſe for which they are produced. I ſay of the proofes onlie, for of the poſitions themſelues, I houlde you not a fitt or competent iudge. And were it not, that I am verie confident in the clearenes of my cauſe, and am alſo perſuaded that you will not preiudice your reputation with the world ſo farre, as to giue your iudgment againſt a manifeſt truth, I would not be ſo vnaduiſed as to put my cauſe into ſo vnequall and partiall a iudge his handes, as all men knowe you to be, betweene me and myne aduerſarie. Neuertheles the premiſſes beinge conſidered I will not refuſe your iudgement in this cauſe: Only I will request of you

to peruſe that which hath been ſayd on either parte, before you geue your iudgment of the cauſe it ſelfe; And this I thinke I may iustlie demaunde of you, without incurringe anie ſpeciall obligation of particular grace or fauour: which beinge performed, I freelie permitt you to paſſe your opinion of the difference, as you shall thinke most conformable to equitie, and important for your owne reputation. Whereof, I maruell not a litle, you had ſo ſmal reguarde, as to lett goe foorth into the viewe of the worlde, with ſo much testimonie of your allowance and approbation, ſuch a peece of stuffe as Mr. Pilkinton hath ſett to ſale in this booke. Which (to ſpeake without preiudice of others that may ſeeme to contēd with him for the price of ignorance, impertinencie and peruerſitie) I thinke is one of the ſeeliest and shallowest thinges that hath ſeen ſunne in this age▪ And therefore a iudicious friende (hauinge looked a litle into it) tould me I was not to expect anie honour by vndertakinge ſuch an aduerſarie. Wherefore I aduiſe you for your owne credit ſake, to be more warie hereafter, then to lett ſuch birdes flye abroade with your name in their forehead.

            TO THE IVDICIOVS READER.
            
               IN the yeare 1614. (good reader) I put forth in print at the requeſt of a friend, a briefe Enchiridion or Manuall of controuerſies, proouinge the Catholike faith in 38. ſeuerall heades of controuerſie by the text of holy Scripture it ſelfe; which contayninge but onlie ſeauen ſheetes of paper, Mr. Richarde Pilkinton, who ſtileth himſelfe doctor of Diuinitie, after fower whole yeeres, pretendeth to anſwre, and for that purpoſe hath ſett forth a booke of fiftie ſheetes thinkinge to couer by multitude of wordes, that which with force of argument he could not impeache nor make obſcure. His booke came but to my handes the laſt of Februarie this preſent yeere, when I was both indiſpoſed in my health, & had newlie receiued a command from thoſe who could commaunde me, to tranſporte myſelfe from Paris, where then I liued, to Douay. So that vntill the fourteenth of May, I could not begin to thinke ſeriouſly of any reply to him, thoughe I had in the meane while runne ouer ſome parte of his booke, and alſoe noted ſomethinge therein to that purpoſe. Where Mr. Pilkinton may peraduenture ſay as he ſaith of the Manuall, that it well appeareth to haue

               tyme but another might well haue made diuers ſuch replies in the ſame ſpace; as Apelles answered to one, who sheweinge him a picture, and ſayinge he had made it in one day: But be ytt that Mr. Pilkintons witt and dexteritie, coulde haue performed much more in the ſame tyme, yett I confeſſe that mine coulde doe noe better; the other imployments wherein the greateſt parte of my tyme is taken vpp, lyinge vppon me. Neither doth Mr. Pilkinton neede much to bragge of his dexteritie and expedition in this kinde; ſeeinge he hath beſtowed fower whole yeeres or verie neere in anſwereinge only ſeauen ſheetes of paper, and that alſo ſo ſhallowly and ſeelily, that there is much leſſe difficultie to refute his aunſwere, then to Coppie out or tranſcribe his wordes. I haue replyed to all he ſaith as it lyeth in his booke ſo farr as I goe with him, relatinge his owne wordes, leaſt he ſhoulde complayne of ill dealinge, as if ſomethinge of moment were lefte vntouched; And both he and the reader may likewiſe vnderſtande, that I might with as much facilitie haue refuted the reſt of his booke, had it been either neceſſarie or proffitable to haue beſtowed the labour in tranſcribinge it, and coſt in printinge it. I would wiſhe thee good reader to take ſpeciall notice of the preface, which may ſerue thee as a key not only to this ſmall treatiſe, but alſo to

other workes of greater moment, and generally to all controuerſies. In the anſwereinge whereof as Mr. Pilkinton hath been more laborious, ſo hath he alſo ſhewed himſelfe more impertinent and peruerſe. Reade the whole with attention if thy leiſure will permitte thee, and compare diligentlie his proofes and myne together, & after doe not ſpare to giue thy Cenſure thereon as thou ſhalt thinke good in gods name. And if thou receiueſt anie proffit by my ſmall labour, I ſhall thinke it well beſtowed, and as fullie recompenſed as I expect or deſire in this worlde. God euer keepe thee and me alſo.

                  CHAMPNEY.
                  I may err and fayle, as all other men may; but obſtinate in errour by gods grace I ſhall neuer be. Neither will I euer be but a ſcholer and childe of the orthodox Fathers. If therefore by ouerſight, ignorance or errour which are defects incident to all men, I haue vttered anie thinge contrarie to theire doctrine, I doe here willinglie and wittinglie recall and retract it. But lett vs heare the directe contradictions you ſpeake of.

                  All articles of faith are not contayned ſo

                  You were verie ill aduiſed to vſe ſuch euident corrupt dealinge in the verie firſt line of your booke.

This poſition, ſett downe by you, is no more myne, then your Parallel, is my Manuall. But you prooue your ſelfe a fitt ſcholler of your old Maiſters. My poſition is this. All ſuch articles as are of faith, are not contayned ſo much as indirectlie or implici
                           •
                        lie in holie ſcriptures, but onlie ſo far as the ſcriptures contayne and teſtifie the aucthoritie of the Churche and Tradition. To this poſition lett vs nowe ſee your Antitheſis of the Fathers.

               In thoſe thinges that are plainlie ſet downe in the holy ſcripture, all poinctes are founde that concerne either beliefe or life.

                  If your wittes had been at home when you wroteAntitheſis Aug. lib. 2 de doctr. chriſt. c. 6. this, you would eaſilie haue ſeen this doctrine of S. Auguſt: to haue hadd no oppoſition with my poſition. For my propoſition, were it ſett downe in theſe wordes. All articles of faith are contayned in ſcriptures ſo far as they teſtifie the Authoritie of the Churche, and Traditions. Which you will not, as I ſuppoſe, deny to be the verie ſame in ſence with the poſition ſett downe in the Ma
                        •
                     uall; I would learne of you wherein you putt the antitheſis betwixt this poſition, and that of S. Auguſt. But lett S. Auguſt.Cont. Creſcon. lib. 1. cap. 33. himſelfe be iudge of this matter. Althoughe (ſaith he) no example of this thinge (ſpeaking of the validitie of Baptiſme, miniſtred by heretickes) be brought out of holie ſcriptures, yett doe we followe the truth of the ſame ſcriptures in this point, whilſt we doe that which pleaſeth the whole Churche, which the authoritie of the ſcripture doth commend. Wherby you ſee S. Auguſt. to teache ſome articles of faith not otherwiſe to be contayned in holy ſcriptures, but ſo far onlie as they commend vnto vs the authoritie of the Churche, which is that my poſition ſaith; and therefore your antitheſis is in your owne brayne that ſeemeth to be at oddes with all true doctrine.

And marueyle truly it is to me, with what countenance you produce S. Aug. doctrine, as thoughe you attributed to him ſome authoritie, ſeinge in theLib 2. d

In his omnibus libris timentes Deum, & pietate manſueti quaerunt voluntatem Dei. In all theſe bookes, thoſe that feare God, and are indued with true pietie ſeeke the will of God. If nowe you make anie eſteeme of S. Auguſt. iudgment, what caſe are you in, that reiect theſe bookes of holy ſcripture as apocriphall, whence he ſaith all pious and thoſe that feare God, do ſeeke his will: but this onlie by the way.

                  If you had taken but ordinarie heede what you wrote, you woulde not haue ſayde that my poſition hath anie oppoſition with S. Ireneus; who ſayth not that the Apoſtles wrote all they preached, as he ſhould haue don to make your antitheſis good, but onlie that they wrote the ſame goſpell which they

preached, and not a different or contrarie doctrine to their preachinge, as ſome prophane heretickes of whom he maketh there mentiō impudentlie taught, which ſence of this Father your ſelfe acknowledge pag. 5. But if you will needes make this conſequence they wrote that which they preached, ergo, they wrote all that they preached, (as you muſt argue if you will make anie antitheſis betwixt my poſition and S. Ireneus his doctrine) I will ſay that either you haue forgotten your logicke, or that you neuer had anie. For to make or inferre an vniuerſall propoſition, of an indefinite in n

                      or, the kinge writeth that he ſpeaketh and thinketh, therefore he writeth all he ſpeaketh or thinketh. Moreouer, of S. Ireneus his iudgment concerninge traditions, you might haue informed your ſelfe by the chapter immediatelie followinge that which you cite, where he hath theſe wordes. When we appeall to that tradition (which deſcendinge from the Apoſtles, is by the ſucceſsion of priestes in the Churche preſerued) they, to wit heretikes, reiect Traditions.

                  The poſition of the Manuall which you ayme at as this. All places of holy ſcripture containinge articles of faith (the obſtinate misbeleefe whereof is damnable) are not eaſie to be vnderſtoode, but require ſome rule to be interpreted by. Nowe if you will

maintaine this poſition to be oppoſite to S. Epiphanius, you muſt graunte that your doctrine is oppoſite to him, which I euidentlie ſhewe in this manner. In the roll of poſitions which you ſay are forgéd by me againſt you, and are ſett downe by you in the next page of your booke; This in the ſecond. All places of holie ſcripture conteininge articles of faith, are eaſie to be vnderstoode, which propoſition if you will reiect as none of yours, as you doe in the place mentioned; then muſt neceſſarilie the contradictorie propoſition which is the ſame with mine here carped at by you, and wich you ſay is oppoſite to S. Epiphanius be, yours, and then doe you contradict S. Epiphanius, if you will ſay that I doe. Or if you will confeſſe the truth, and acknowledge this latter propoſition. to be yours, as doubtles it is, why doe you then charge me with forgeinge it againſt you? Accorde your owne ſayinges, and then ſhall I knowe what to anſwere vnto. In the meane while, you are vnfortunate to ſtumble ſo groſſelie (if contradictinge your ſelfe in ſo ſhorte a ſpace may be termed onlie ſtumblinge) in the verie entrance of your diſpute. My poſition ſhall be ſhewed agreeable both with holy Scriptures and auncient Fathers in due place. And as for your authoritie alleaged out of S. Epiphanius, if it be in him (as I knowe no
                        •
                      whether it be or noe, for it is cited by you ſo at large that I cannot finde it) it may haue this true ſence and meaninge; That all thinges are cleare in ſcriptures to ſuch, as come to them with this minde to vnderſtande them as the catholicke Churche and the true paſtors thereof interpret them. Which ſayinge hath noe contrarietie at all with my poſition. For I doe not ſay that the ſcriptures are harde to be vnderſtoode by the churche, or that they neede another rule to be interpreted by then the Churches vnderſtandinge and interpretation.

And further that he that will impugne this treatiſe, may ſee, what he hath to prooue if hee wil prooue any thinge to purpoſe. That is if he will prooue anie thinge againſt the Catholike Faith, which onlie I vndertake in the Manuall to prooue, and not to impugne or diſprooue the proteſtants, further then the proofe of one contradictorie, is the diſproofe of the other. Without reaſon therefore doe you charge me with forgeinge poſitions, thoughe amongſt theſe which I ſett downe vnder this note in the margent, Proteſtants poſitiōs, ſome were founde, which they doe not mantayne (which whether it be ſo or no we ſhall preſentlie examine) for I putt the poſition contradictorie to the Catholike, vnder the title of proteſtant poſition for this cauſe (as I haue ſayde before) that if anie proteſtant will denie or impugne the catholike poſition prooued by me, he may ſee the direct poſition which he is to prooue.
                  If therefore there be anie of the catholique poſitions ſett downe by me, admitted and acknowledged as true and orthodoxe, then is not the contradictorie poſition inforced or impoſed vppon them to prooue. But if they reiect all the Catholicke poſitions

as falſe and erroneous (as they will be found to doe) then muſt they whether they will or noe, acknowledge the contradictorie poſition to be theirs, vnles they will graunt that both contradictorie poſitions may be true or both falſe, which noe man euer yett admitted. And thus much ſir for your charge of forged poſitions in generall, now we will examine the particular.

And for what other cauſe thinke you did Luther in the Creede, turned by him into Dutch, in ſteede of the Catholicke churche, thruſt in the Chriſtian churche, but to auoyde the force of the worde Catholicke? which he did ſo diſlike, that his diſciples in the conferrence att Altemberge reiected a certayne propoſitionColloquiū Altemb. fol. 154. aſcribed to him wherein was this worde Catholicke,

That the ſcriptures may be diuerſſlie vnderſtoode if you denie, who is he of all your fellowes that wil beleeue you? Surelie noe man that is awake, but will thinke rather that you dreamed when you wrote this, then he will thinke that the ſcriptures cannot be vnderſtoode diuerſlie, which beinge ſo euident by daylie experience, that noe man in his ſenſes can denie it, who ſeeth not the neceſſitie of ſome iudgment to determine which is the true ſence and meaninge thereof. But that is the thinge you feare, which rather then you will graunt, you ſay that which a drunken man woulde be aſhamed to haue ſayde.
                  The inſufficiencie of the ſcriptures to inſtruct the churche in al matters of faith, ſtādeth right wel with theire ſufficiencie to prooue thoſe thinges which are contained expreſlie in them; And therefore your argument whereby you would conclude againſt me, the inſufficiencie of ſcriptures to prooue anie article of faith, becauſe I ſay it is not ſufficient to prooue all the Articles of faith is more then childiſh, and like vnto this. The firſt chapter of Geneſis is no

                      ſufficient to prooue all the articles of chriſtian faith,

therefore it is not ſufficient to prooue that God created the worlde. Woulde you (I pray you) admitte this argument as good? I thinke not, thoughe I knowe you impertinent enoughe; why therefore doe you goe aboute to conclude your purpoſe againſt your aduerſarie by the like argument? leaue for ſhame to make your ſelfe ſo ridiculous, ſeinge you write your ſelfe ſo doctor of Diuinitie. As for the worde imperfect, I doe not knowe anie catholicke that doth vſe it; yett if it haue no other meaninge then inſufficient to prooue all the articles of faith, it is not reprehenſible & helpeth your cauſe nothinge at all. The authoritie of the churche, councell, and tradition in explication of ſcriptures, is as friuoluſly alleaged by you, to impugne the authoritie of the ſame ſcriptures, as if you ſhoulde ſay the authoritie of the iudges or cuſtomes in England or anie other kingdome, to interprete or expounde the Lawe doth violate and impeach the authoritie of the Lawe. Your impertinencies are without meaſure or number.

Firſt is it not a cheefe article of Chriſtiā beleefe that the ſonne of God is of equall or one ſubſtance and glorie with his father? and ſecondlie is not this article as clearlie and as often ſett downe in the ſcripture, as anie other articles of our beliefe? And thirdlie did not the Arrians delude by falſe interpretation all the proofes of the ſayde article, ſo that they remained not conuinced by anie of them, nor all of them together? which of all theſe three propoſitions will you denie? you will not as I ſuppoſe finde anie probable ground to denie anie of them. And yett if you graunt them all (as they are all moſt manifeſtlie true) that is clearlie concluded which I affirme, and you denie; to witt that noe teſtimonie of holy ſcripture can be ſo direct, and conuincinge, but that it may be eluded by falſe interpretation. You ſay be it ſo, what doth this either helpe me or hurte you. But you are verie ſhorte ſighted or rather ſtarke blinde, if you ſee not this, For it helpeth me in that it deliuereth me of

the charge or obligation to bringe ſuch teſtimonie of holy ſcripture in proofe of the article of our catholicke beleefe, as cannot by anie tergiuerſation or falſe interpretatiō be miſcōſtrued or miſunderſtoode by you, which you would ſeeme to tye me vnto, it hurteth you, becauſe it euidentlie ſheweth that the ſole ſcriptures are not ſufficiēt to conuince anie wilfull or obſtinate hereticke in anie article of faith, as you affirme it to be.
                  The reaſon that you alleage why it ſhoulde not helpe me, nor hurte you, that all criptures may be mis-interpreted, is altogether miſapplyed, prooueinge not that for which it is alleaged, but rather diſprooeuinge the propoſition it ſelfe. But this is a ſmall ouerſight in your diſcourſe, you ſay therefore; that whatſoeuer is added to the ſcriptures to interprete them, whether traditions or counſells, is equallie, if not more ſubiect to deluſion: whereunto I anſwere. Firſt that neither counſells nor traditions, are ſo ſubiect to miſinterpretatiō as the ſcriptures are; And the reaſon is, becauſe they expreſſe more particularlie theire owne ſence and meaninge then the ſcriptures ordinarilie doe, and conſequentlie leaue not ſo much libertie of miſinterpretatiō as they doe. Secōdlie I anſwere that whēſoeuer the teſtimonie of councells or traditions are drawne into doubte, and difficultie as often they are; (heretickes ſeruinge themſelues of them, as they doe of the ſcriptures) they are to be vnderſtoode accordinge to the iudgment of the preſent churche, which as a liuelie and liuinge iudge and interpreter, hath power to interprete aſwell the coū

That which doth perfect the man of God to euerie good worke, enableth him fullie to conuince heretikes: for this is one mayne dutie of his callinge, to conuince contradictours. But the ſcriptures doe perfect the man of God to euerie good worke, and particularlie S. Paule expreſſeth conuiction, therefore they teach him fullie to conuince heretickes.

To your double therefore out of the worde of God, I anſwere, that the minor or ſeconde propoſition of your argument is not out of ſcripture, nor in it ſelfe true.

Out of which place if you woulde conclude anie thinge by lawfull argument, you ſhoulde argue thus. That which is profitable to teach, to argue, to correct and inſtruct in iuſtice, that the man of God may be perfect, instructed in euerie good worke, is ſufficient ſo fullie to conuince heretikes of theire errour, that they cannot delude it by falſe interpretation. But all ſcripture inſpired by God is ſuch; therefore all ſcripture inſpired by God is ſufficient ſo fullie to conuince heretikes, that they cannot delude it by falſe interpretation. The concluſion of which argument is the iſſue betwixt you and me. The medium you vſe to prooue it are the wordes of the Apoſtle, which if you had putt downe ſimplie and whollie and not dubled (as you ſay) by curtayllinge them, you would eaſilie haue ſeene (if you ſee anie thinge) that they are as farr from cōcludinge

your affirmatiue, as the argument followinge is from concludinge that which is put in the concluſion thereof. Marke it I pray you, and learne to argue better; eſpeciallie when you diſpute for the victorie in a matter of ſuch moment as this is. That which is proffitable to nouriſhe, to exhilarate, and conforte or ſtrengthen man, that he may be able to exerciſe all man-like functions and actions, is ſufficient to defende him from his enemies, and to vanquiſhe them. Butt al wines are ſuch. Therfore al wines are ſufficiēt to defende a mā frō his enimies; & to vanquiſhe thē. By which argumēt, which is the verie ſame in forme that yours ſhoulde be, if you would haue formed it out of the Apoſtles wordes, you ſee (if you onlie are not blinde) how ridiculouſlie you double your affirmatiue out of gods worde. Beſides your argument is for diuers other reſpects either fooliſhe, or fraudubent. For S. Paule ſaith that all ſcripture, that is euerie parte & parcell of ſcripture is profitable to teache &c: yet you will not I hope ſay that euerie parcell of ſcripture is ſufficient to conuince heretikes. Agayne the Apoſtle ſpeaketh manifeſtlie of ſuch ſcriptures as Timothy had learned from his childehoode, which without controuerſie were onlie the ſcriptures of the old teſtament, of which you will not affirme that they are ſufficient to conuince all heretikes. And ſo you ſee the liuinge wherewith you woulde double your affirmatiue to be ſo poore ſtuffe, that were your cloake doubled with no better lyninge, you would feele the winter could, noe leſſe then if your cloake were ſimple: but lett vs ſee, peraduenture you haue better ſtuffe behynde.

Cuſanus ſpeaketh expresſlie of the vſe or ſece of ſcriptures ſo farr as they pertaine to the rite, order or manner of adminiſtring the Sacraments, and namelie of Communion vnder one or both kindes; which rites or Ceremonies becauſe they may be diuerſe and changeable without anie preiudice either to the nature of the Sacraments or to the veritie of holy ſcripture (as indeede they are at this day different in the Greeke and Latin church, the one conſecratinge the holy Euchariſt in leauened bredd, the other in vnleauened, and yett neither of them contrarie to the ſcriptures) they may be altered and changed accordinge as the wiſdome of gods churche ſeeth iuſt occaſion, and yett accordinge to the ſence and meaning of the holy ſcriptures, which to the churche is neuer vnknowne, and this is Cuſanus his plaine doctrine, which you could not haue been ignorant of, if you had read him yourſelfe. But it is your good nature, to make alwaies the worſt ſence of your authors to deceaue your reader thereby. For he ſpeaketh not of ſcriptures ſo farr as

they containe articles of faith, which euer are the ſame, but as they appertaine to matters of practice, which may be different accordinge to the diuerſitie of circumſtances occurringe. In ſettinge downe his wordes, you vſe your accuſtomed arte and fraude. For his wordes where vppon you would make your cheefe aduantage are theſe. Therefore the ſcriptures followe the church which was before them and for which the ſcriptures are, not contrarie: That is, the churche is not for the ſcriptures. Whereas you leauing out ſome parte of his ſpeache, make his wordes to ſound that the ſence and meaninge of the ſcriptures, followe the vnderſtandinge of the churche, and not the vnderſtandinge of the churche the ſence of ſcriptures, but might be contrarie vnto it: which neither he nor anie other catholick man euer dreamed of.

                        e ground of the proseſtants doctrine to be, that the wordes of the ſcripture are the iudge of all controuerſies. For the which Mr. Pilk: hotly reprehendeth me of fraude and falſehodde. See his wordes a little before at this marke † in the margent, and maruell at his witt, iudgment and memorie: Nowe to the purpoſe. Noe one of all the teſtimonies alleaged by you doth ſay, that where ſcriptures are produced by both partes, they are ſufficient to decide the controuerſie. Thoughe I doe not denie, but for the moſte part the inequallity is ſo greate in the catholike partie (as it alſo falleth out in the cauſe betweene the proteſtāts and catholikes at this day) that anie man of indifferent witt, iudgment and deſire to find out the truth, may ſee on whether ſide the ſcripture ſtandeth. But that they are not abſolutelie ſufficient where there is obſtinacie on anie ſide, I ſhall make your ſelfe to cō
                     feſſe (thoughe peruerſe enoughe) or elſe I ſhall much marueill; & that by the verie example vſed by S. Optatus and S. Aug: and approoued here by your ſelfe. Put therefore the caſe, that the children of a deceaſed father contend aboute the inheritance, euerie one of them challenginge it as appertayninge to himſelfe, & in proofe or confirmation of his clayme alleageth the teſtament and will of his father, which he proteſteth to be cleare for him, and againſt his competitours, beinge rightlie vnderſtoode, perſiſting moſt ſtifly in his opinion and in deffence of his right clayme, as he is perſwaded. The caſe beinge putt thus (which is the verie ſame with ours in the controuerſy of religion) will you ſay in the ſinceritie of your hearte, that the ſole will or teſtament of the father is a ſufficient iudge to decide this difference and to bringe the parties to an accorde? And that there needeth not anie other iudge or arbiter to determine

vppon the true ſence and meaninge of the fathers will, whereby they all pretende to make theire clayme, and to grounde theire title? you will not I thinke ſay, yea, to this queſtion. And well I wote that were the caſe your owne betwixte your ſelfe & your bretheren concerninge a temporall inheritance, experience (which though ſhee be the miſtres of fooles, is not for all that a fooliſh miſtres) woulde teach you that it is a meere Paradoxe to maintayne that the ſole teſtament of your deceaſed father, could in this caſe decide the controuerſie amongſt you his diſagreeinge children. So that the example brought by your ſelfe out of the fathers, is prooued to make manifeſtlie againſt you.
                  Which will yet be much more cleare, if the caſe be putt as it is indeede with vs, that theſe brethren doe not only contend aboute the true ſence and meaninge of theire fathers teſtament, but alſo aboute the teſtament it ſelfe; the one conteſtinge the whole writinge contayned in the booke vnder the title of his will to be his true teſtament, another not receiuinge the whole, contendeth diuers partes and parcells not to belonge therunto. And another yett reiectinge more; as it falleth out betweene vs and the proteſtants, Caluin caſtinge out of the teſtament of God, fiue whole bookes beſides ſome large partes of other bookes, which the catholikes belieue to appertayn to his true teſtament. Luther reiectinge beſides theſe, diuerſe other whole bookes. The caſe therefore beinge thus, howe is it poſſible that the ſole written teſtament of God ſhoulde decide the controuerſie betweene theſe competitors, and bring them to an accorde? who doe not agree ſo much as in what bookes or writinges the teſtament is contayned, ſo farre are they from beinge at accorde of the true ſence and meaninge thereof.
                  It is therefore no other thinge to ſay in this caſe, that the ſcriptures muſt iudge all controuerſies, then to ſay that the controuerſie it ſelfe, muſt be iudge of

the controuerſie, which is more then madnes to thinke. For the controuerſie beinge not onlie what the ſcripture ſaith, or meaneth, but alſo what is ſcripture, it is all one to ſay, that ſcriptures muſt iudge and decide all controuerſies, and to ſay the controuerſies themſelues muſt decide all controuerſies. Againe ſeeinge you Mr. Pilkinton, ſeeme to geue ſo much to holy ſcripture as to be able and ſufficient to decide all doubtes and determine all differences in matter of faith, Why doe you not hearken vnto them when they ſend you to the churche and to the paſtours, and doctours thereof, as to liuelie iudges, hauinge the keyes of knowledge to vnderſtande the ſcriptures? But you deſiringe nothinge leſſe then to come to a iuſt and competent tryall of your cauſe, holde your ſelues cloſe to that principle, by which the moſt deteſtable, vile, and contemptible heretike that euer was may maintaine his hereſie, without beinge conuinced thereof; as I toulde you before of Legat, which inſtance you can neuer anſwere not ſatisfy, and which onlie is ſufficient if you were not obſtinatly peruerſe) to make you aſhamed to maintaine ſo ſenceles a Paradox, and ſo euidentlie contradicted by perpetuall experience in all ages.
                  Your laſt ſhifte or euaſiō of interpretinge ſcripture by ſcripture, vnles there be ſome agreement, or certaintie of the ſcripture interpretinge, more then of the ſcripture interpreted, which abſtractinge from the iudgmēt of the churche cannot be had, is a meere mockerie, and like as if a man would meaſure one peece of veluett the meaſure whereof is as vncertaine as that of the former.
                  And to conclude this ſection, it beinge in queſtion betweene the catholikes and proteſtants who is to be iudge of controuerſies in faith (yea the roote and key of all controuerſies, which beinge ended or decided all the reſt would haue eaſie deciſion) you affirminge the ſcriptures to be this iudge and pretend to prooue this by ſcripture, as al other thinges to be

beleeued, you are bounde by your owne doctrine, to ſhewe it out of ſcripture, which when you ſhall doe, we will yeelde vnto you in all the reſt of the tontrouerſies betweene vs. But ſeeinge you can neuer doe this, why doe you not yeelde to vs, ſhewinge you out of manifeſt ſcripture the authoritie of the churche to decide controuerſies? You ſay the church is a partie and therefore no competent iudge. But this hauinge been the cauill of all condemned heretikes, and as truly alleaged by them as by you, this plea is no more receiueable in you then in them. And tell me I pray you, the kinge is he not partie in all pleas of felonie or treaſon that are brought into his courtes? yes verilie. And yett none euer yet thought of anie ſuch plea, as to appeale from the iudgment geuen in his name, and by his ſoueraigne authoritie in ſuch caſes: Albeit the iudgments geuen in his courtes are farr frō beinge ſo aſſuredly iuſte & equitable as are the iudgments of the church, which hath the infallible promiſe of the holy ghoſtes aſſiſtance in her deciſions and determinations. You are therefore faſt taken which way ſoeuer you turne your ſelfe; and this inference of myne: That if there be no other iudge of controuerſies beſides the ſcriptures, God hath not prouided ſufficient meanes to ſa

For what principles of artes or ſciences (I pray you) are thoſe that are beleeued for themſelues? none certainlie. For the principles of all naturall knowledge, are either euidentlie knowne by the light of nature, and not beleeued, or they are beleeued for the authoritie of a higher knowledge, and not beleeued for themſelues. The verities contayned in the Bible are beleeued, not for themſelues but for the authoritie of God reueilinge them, who onlie is truth it ſelfe, and beleeued for himſelfe, of whome and from whome they receiue authoritie, and haue it not of themſelues as you falſelie affirme.

               Then if the ſcriptures be principles, as it is confeſsed on both ſides, it followeth that they are immediate & indemonſtrable, as al other principles are in theire ſciēces, where of they are principles, but theſe more thē others, becauſe they are primae veritatis. And as the firſt good for it ſelfe is to be loued, ſo the first truth for it ſelfeProlog. in magiſt. q 3. art. 2. Aug 6. confeſſ. cap. 5. is to be beleeued ſaith Aquinas.

This is ſufficient to shewe that neither arte nor order requireth at your handes to prooue the ſcriptures, as you diſorderlie imagine.

                  The ſcriptures or verities conteyned in them are confeſſed to be principles in reſpect of all Theologicall concluſions deduced from them, and therefore in reſpect of them they neede no farther proofe to anie chriſtian diuine that beleeueth them to be the worde of God. But they are not principles in reſpect of the articles of our faith in generall, but are themſelues to be beleeued for the ſame authoritie of God reueylinge, as all other articles of faith are.
                  And that they are not neceſſarie principles of the articles of our

                     aith, it is manifeſt by that, before the ſcriptures were written, the churche of God beleeued manie of the ſame articles which nowe it beleeueth. Therfore when you ſay the ſcriptures or verities contained in them, are primae veritatis, if ignorance (thoughe groſſe and not to be excuſed in a doctour of diuinitie) doth not excuſe you, you will make the ſcriptures not onlie to be gods worde, but alſo to be God himſelfe. For beſides him there is no prima veritas which is to be beleeued for it ſelfe, as vppon better conſideration (I thinke) you will not dare to denie.
                  Seeinge therefore the ſcriptures are not primae veritatis or firſt truthe, but the teſtimonies wordes or verities reueiled by the firſt truthe, they are not, euen by your owne grounde to be beleeued for themſelues, but for the truthe and authoritie of the firſt veritie God himſelfe, of whoſe reuelation we muſt haue ſufficient grounde before we canne ſecurelie and prudentlie beleeue the ſcriptures to be his worde. That which you bringe out of S. Thomas, maketh euidentlie againſt you (ſo iudicious are you in your allegations.) For the ſcriptures beinge not God, they are not the firſt truth, and therefore not to be beleeued for themſelues. S. Aug. in the firſt place maketh alſo againſt you, ſayinge that the ſcriptures are to be beleeued to bee of gods ſpiritt and not to be knowne. For to beleeue this he recurreth

not to the ſcriptures themſelues, but to the authoritie which they had obtayned throughe the whole worlde. The ſecond authoritie of S. Aug. is wholie impertinent to your purpoſe, as the reader thoughe but of meane iudgmēt will eaſilie diſcerne. Hee ſayinge nothinge that ſoundeth as if the ſcriptures were to be beleeued for themſelues, or without other authoritie. And therfore thus farr haue you ſaide nothinge that may ſatisfie this aſſertion of the Manuall, that in the orderlie proceedinge in this preſent poincte, the ſcriptures ſhoulde firſt be prooued: but you will peraduenture ſatisfie better hereafter.

The one that the ſcripture cannot be an vniuerſall rule of our faith, ſeeinge ſomethinges are to be beleeued without proofe of ſcripture, as are (for example) that there is an holy ſcripture, contayninge gods worde and reuelation, and that theſe & theſe bookes be ſuch, therefore of neceſsitie muſt there be ſome other rule of our faith more vniuerſall then the ſcriptures, and conſequentlie before the ſcriptures. And this cannot be but the authoritie of gods churche, which is clearely S. Auguſt: doctrine, who was not a frayde to ſay: I woulde not beleeue the Goſpell, but that the authoritie of the church doth moue me. Seeinge therefore the authoritie of the churche is a ſufficient motiue for vs to beleeue what is ſcripture, why ſhoulde it not haue the like authoritie with vs in other points of faith? which is alſo S. Aug: argument in the ſame place: but I will notwithſtandinge ſatisfie our aduerſaries in theire owne humour.

I woulde not haue beleeued the goſpel, except the authoritie of the churche had moued me, are too weake to inſerr any ſuch like concluſion, thoughe we admitte them in your corrupt tranſlation. For it is plaine, he ſpeaketh not theſe wordes of the preſent tyme, when he was a Bishoppe as you reade them, but of the tyme past when he was a Manichy. Beinge a Catholicke & a Bishoppe when he writte that booke, he had farr other motiues to beleeue the Goſpell then the authority of the church which here he alone nameth. Take one place for a thouſande, I take my conſcience to witnes (Honoratus) and God that dwelleth in pure myndes, that I thinke nothinge more wiſe, chaste, religious, then all theſe ſcriptures, which the catholicke churche retayneth vnder the name of the olde and new testament, I knowe thou wounderest, but I cannot d

For if the churches authoritie had force to moue an hereticke to beleeue the goſpell, what man not depriued of common ſence will denie, but it hath at leaſt the like force with a catholike? But you ſay that S.

Seeinge therefore you geue to the churche theſe thinges without which the ſcriptures are not a rule of faith, why ſhould you deny it to be alſo a rule of faith?

If this argument conclude anie thinge, it will alſo prooue the ſcriptures to be noe rule of faith. For it is neither foundation, nor reſolution of faith, if you vnderſtande the firſt and chiefe foundation, or laſt reſolution (as I tould you before) vnles you will make it to be God himſelfe. But if you take foundation for that which doth grounde our faith in a certaine and ſure kinde of infallible teſtimonie, in which ſence al men ſpeake,

But they that beleeue not anie thinge but that which is prooued by ſcripture, cannot beleeue that there is a ſcripture, nor what bookes are holy ſcripture. For neither of theſe two canne be prooued by holy ſcripture. Therefore they that beleeue not anie thinge but that which is prooued by ſcripture, cannott beleeue anie thinge att all.

Yea what will you thinke of your ſelfe and all the reſt of your crewe, who caſt out of the Canon ſo manie of thoſe bookes which S. Aug. whoſe authoritie you cite, alwayes eſteemed to be canonicall ſcripture? See whether you haue not pronounced ſentence with your owne mouth againſt your ſelfe, and condemned your ſelfe to be noe Chriſtian? If you ſhoulde eate noe bread till you quitt your ſelfe of this indictment, I dare vndertake to finde you bread for ſixe pence ſo longe as you liue. Howſoeuer, hereby at leaſt it is cleare that the ſcriptures are not ſuch principles of our faith as beinge not prooued to be written by the holy Ghoſt, may be doubted of, and therefore neceſſarilie require to be ſufficientlie prooued before they can be groundes of other articles of our faith. Whē you or anie for you ſhall ſolue this argument, I ſhall eſteeme you not vnworthy of a doctours cap.
                  S. Aug. hath good reaſon to ſay that no Chriſtian dare to open his mouth againſt the ſcriptures receiued by the catholicke churche. For ſo ſhoulde he be worthyly eſteemed as a publican and heathen by theMatt. 18. teſtimonie of our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe. And therfore is Luther and Caluine with theire viperous generation worthilie cenſured as heretikes, thoughe they had no other errours but that of reiectinge with obſtinacie the canonicall ſcriptures.
                  That which you bringe out of Clemens (were it as you ſett it downe) is nothinge to your purpoſe. For we knowe the ſcriptures to be indemonſtrable

by reaſon, but yett to be prooued by authoritie, as all other articles of fayth are. And nowe looke ouer once more your cardes and weigh well with your ſelfe, whether this propoſition admitted for true, which is one of your principles; That nothinge is to be beleeued that is not prooued by ſcriptures, whether (I ſay) the Manuall doth not directlie conuince the proteſtants (who profeſſe that they cannot prooue the ſcriptures to be ſcriptures) to beleeue nothinge at all.

Secondlie there be manie thinges imbarked in them which Apostolicall rule of faith and ſound doctrine doth contradict, both theſe are verified of, the Apocripha. For neither the churche of God before Christ receiued them, to whom were committed the oracles of God. Rom. 3. 2. (which Christe woulde haue reprooued them for, if they had without iust cauſe reiected them, as well as he did reprehend them for the miſinterpretinge of the canonicall bookes) neither yett longe after Chriſte, did the Christian churche imbrace them. And beſides in the bookes them ſelues: there are certaine brandes, whereby they may be diſcerned from the canonicall. First the additionHeſt. 12. 5 vnto the booke of Hester ſaith, that Mardocheus had receiued rewardes for the detection of the conſpiracie of the kinges Chamberlaynes; the true Heſter ſayth he receiued none. The ſuppoſitiusHest. 6. 3. Heſter ſaith, that Haman intended the the destruction of Mardocheus for detectinge the Eunuches. Hest. 12. 6. The true Hester ſaith forHeſt. 5. 2. Heſt. 15. 7. Bar. 1. 2.

The booke of Baruch ſaith that the cittie of Hieruſalem was taken and burnt at the ſame tyme: Ieremie teacheth the contrarie & the bookes of the kinges. The additions vnto Daniell ſay that when Danyell deliuered Suſanna he was a childe: the true

Daniell ſaith that he with two others made byca. 13. 45. cap. 2. 48. the kinge were chiefe ouer 120. princes, that they might take all the accompts of the kingdome, and the kinge might not be troubled. But children vſe not to be ſett ouer ſuch affaires. Commentitiues Daniell ſaith in the storie of Bell, that he was fed by Abacucke. 14. 36. whereas Abacucke propheſied longe before the captiuitie 1. 6. In the booke of Tobie cap. 12. 15: the Angell calleth himſelfe Raphaell the Angell of the Lorde; but chapter the 5. 12. he is of the kinred of Ananias and Azarias the greate, if he be the Angell of the Lorde, he cannot be the ſonne of a man. As true is that medecine wherwith the deuill is driuen away: but corporall creatures vſe not to make anie impreſsion into a ſubſtance ſimply intellectuall as deuills be. In Iudith the cruell murther committed by Symeon and Leui is propounded to be imitated cap. 8. 23. which Geneſis the 49. is reprehended and accurſed. The booke of wiſdome is falſelie intituled, as it had been compoſed by Salomon, whereas the author of it was Philo the Iewe. Eccleſiasticus craueth pardon if he come shorte in ſome wordes, which the penmen of the holy Ghost vſed not to doe. In the bookes of the Maccabies a parricide is commended that layde handes on himſelfe, which is forbidden by the lawe.

In the former ſence, there is not anie protestant, that hath taught that the ſcriptures expreſſelie contayne all articles of faith, and this you papists knowe. For Eckius reprooueth the Lutherans, for that they will haue nothinge beleeued, but which is expreſſe ſcripture, or can be prooued out of ſcriptures. So that your owne ſide perceiue we beleeue thinges that are not expreſſelie ſett downe in ſcriptures, but nothinge which hath not a iuſt proofe out of it.

For if you had not been either blinde or blinde foulded, you would haue ſeen that the poſition denyeth full proofe of all articles of faith out of ſcriptures, in the ſame ſence and meaninge that you profeſſe to mayntaine the affirmatiue; and not onlie the expreſſe contayninge them in ſo manie wordes or ſillabels.

            The articles which proteſtants beleeue to be of faith as well as Catholikes, and

yett are not contayned expreſſelie in holy ſcripture, are manie, but we will geue inſtance but onlie in a fewe. Firſt that there are three diſtinct perſons and one only ſubſtance or eſſence in God. Secondlie that the ſecond and thirde perſons are of the ſame ſubſtance, and of equall glorie with the firſt. Thirdelie that the thirde perſon proceedeth from the ſecond and from the firſt. Fowerthly that there are two diſtinct and compleat natures in our Sauiour Chriſt, and but one onlie perſon. Fiftlie that there are in him two willes and two operations, to witt of God and man, aboute all which haue been diuerſe hereſies as is wel known to the learned. And thoughe all theſe articles haue moſt true grounde and proofe in holy ſcriptures, yett are they not ſo expreſſely contayned therein, as they may be fullie prooued by them alone. One example ſhall ſerue for al; to prooue the ſonne of God to be conſubſtantial or of one ſubſtance with the father, the catholikes doe alleage (and trulie) this teſtimonie (I andIo. 10. 30. the father are one) yett becauſe there are moe means of being one, thē in ſubſtāce, as namelie, to be of one wil, deſire, & affectiō, of which ſorte of vnitie ſpeciallie the Arrians did expound this place, alleaginge for themſelues that teſtimonie (I pray thatIo. 17.

For he that hath two perfect natures muſt needes haue theire natural properties & operations, but to wil & worke are natural proprieties & operations, followinge both natures in Christ: therfore he had two willes and two operations. All which places are vrged by the auncient Fathers and late writers proteſtants and papists to confirme theſe ſeuerall points, in ſo much that you are forced to graunt that they haue a

true proofe from the holy ſcriptures. And then I may ſay as S. August. ſaith to Maximian the Arrian. Si vox iſta vera eſt quaeſtio illa finita eſt. But you papiſts haue nimbler witts then the fathers, for you are not content with truth but you muſt haue full proofe, as thoughe that proofe which to a man is true, were not full. For there can be noe fuller proofe, then that which doth conuince and ſatisfie, the vnderstandinge, but a true proofe doth ſo: For what is truth but adaequatio rei & intellectus. And yett if there be anie difference betweene true & full, theſe articles are fullie concluded out of the ſcripture. For beinge articles of the Apostolicke creede, they are plainlie ſett downe as Bellarmine confeſſeth out of S. Aug. And ſome of them queſtioned by the Arrians, as the conſubſtantialitie of the ſonne (which in the next place you except against) he ſaith that of theſe questions which then were moued, clariſsima extabant in ſcripturis teſtimonia, quae ſine dubio antep̄onenda ſunt omnibus conciliorum teſtimonijs. Theſe thinges then that haue most cleare testimonies out of ſcriptures, and to be preferred before all teſtimonies of councells, haue a full proofe from them, but ſuch are ſome of theſe articles, yett you proceede to fight against ſcriptures, and wringe from Christians, one of the strongeſt Bulwarkes they haue against Arrians. I and the conſubstantialitie of the ſonne, becauſe the Arrians interpreted it of vnitie of concorde and will. But if

the mist of poperie had not blinded your eyes, you might eaſily haue ſeen vnanswerable arguments out of the text to prooue the ſonne conſubſtantiall to the father, and ſo to be vnderstoode of the vnitie of ſubſtance. For the Iewes require him to tell them plainely whether he be that Christ, he answereth directlie he is, there fore the naturall and conſubstantiall ſonne of God, as he prooueth. Matt. 22. 45. out of the Pſalme. 100. If then Dauid called him Lorde, howe is he then his ſonne?
               Secondlie he that geueth eternall life to his sheepe, ſo that none can take them out of his hande, is of the ſame power, and conſequentlie of the ſame nature with God; For what is it to be God, but to be of the highest and greateſt power, then which none greater? but the ſonne doth ſoe; ver. 28. & 29. And I geue vnto them eternall life, and they shall neuer perish, neither shall anie plucke them out of myne hande. Thirdlie the Iewes tooke vppe stones to stone him, as a blaſphemer as one that made himſelfe God, this cauſe they ſett downe in plaine termes. verſe 33. Becauſe thou makeſt thy ſelfe God, beinge man; but it is no blaſphemie to be of the like will, deſire and affection with God: playne therefore it is by Chriſts argument, that he did preache God ſo to be his Father, as the Iewes vnderstoode he would haue himſelfe the naturall ſonne of God. See nowe excepte you be blinder thē the Iewes, how plentifullie this ſcripture prooueth the conſubstātialitie of the ſonne,

and as for the place of Io. 17. it helpeth not the Arrians at all, as S. Aug. sheweth to PaſcentiusEpiſt. 174 the Arrian. For that whereſoeuer the ſcripture ſpeaketh of two that are one, as in this place, they are euer of one ſubſtance. And therfore he chargeth both Maximianus theire Biſhoppe, and Paſcentius a noble man of theire opinion, to trauers the ſcriptures, if anie where they coulde shew two, ſayde to be one that are not one in ſubſtance; But lett this be graunted that (I and the Father are one) prooueth onlie vnitie of will, not of ſubstance, is there not an armie of ſcriptures beſides this to prooue the ſonne of the ſame ſubſtance, that we neede not call in the authoritie of the churche?

               Where then is your inference, that this ſcripture without the interpretation of the churche doth not fullie prooue the Father and the ſonne to be one in ſubstance, as if the ſcriptures before the churches interpretation prooue onlie probable; after her interpretation fullie. This I gather to be your meaninge, becauſe BellarmineLib. 4. de verbo c. 7. affirmeth (from whoſe haruest you haue

gathered theſe gleaninges) that the ſcriptures expreſſed by a councell, doe firmelie and certainlie prooue that, which before they did not firmelie prooue. And of S.

                  My inference ſtandeth good, nor is it anie way impeached by S. Aug: euen in this place by you alleaged as alreadie appeareth. Beſides in his booke de vera religione cap. 1. he hath theſe expreſſe wordes▪

That which you ſay of the ſcriptures before and after the churches interpretation, and likwiſe of S.

That is,Mr. Pilkinton woulde turne the ſtate of the queſtion. the ſcriptures before the iudgment of the church of the true ſence and meaninge thereof, make noe full proofe vnto vs of the articles of our faith.

For the interpretation of a Sinode, is but a gloſſe, the ſcripture is the text; the interpretation may err, the text cannott erre; the interpretation is the worde of man, the ſcriptures the voyce of God: to conclude this point, whereas the poſition of the former Roman church was, that diuinitie reaſoneth from the ſcriptures neceſſarilie, from other authors and learninge probablie; the wheele nowe is turned, and men reaſon from the ſcriptures coniecturallie, but from the interpretation of the churche and tradition, firmelie and ſullie.

Paule. 2. Tim. 3. 16. All ſcripture is geuen by the inſpiration of God, and is profitable to doctrine, to reproofe, to correction, to inſtruction which is in righteouſnes. Of S. Peter the 2. epiſt. 1. 21. The prophecie came not in olde tyme by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moued by the holy Ghoſt,

                  Your ſecond anſwere is as much to the purpoſe, as your firſt. Neither the old teſtament proouing the newe, nor contrariwiſe; vnles the one be beleeued before. Yea you make your ſelfe ridiculous to all men by ſuch a naturall or circulare proofe, vnles you ſuppoſe the aſſured beleefe of ſome parte before. For example if one ſhoulde demaunde of you how you knowe, or why you doe beleeue thoſe wordes of our Sauiour which you cite out of the 24: of S. Luke either to haue been ſpoken by him, or written by S. Luke; would you ſay that they euidentlie prooue themſelues ſo to be? ſurely this you muſt ſay, both accordinge to your doctrine here, and accordinge to the neceſſitie you putt your ſelfe into by denyinge the authority of tradition and of the churches teſtimonie. And yett in ſayinge that, you ſhall euidently prooue your ſelfe to be ſenceles. For there is noe ſuch euidence of the thinge, but anie man that is not moued with the authoritie of gods churche, and tradition would eſteeme it verie vncertaine and moſt doubtfull. For vnles theſe wordes, (and that which I ſay of them, I ſay of the reſt of the ſcripture) were God himſelfe, and ſpake to vs as imediatlie as he did to Moiſes, and the reſt of his prophetts, they cannot be ſayde to be knowne by theire owne light, nor beleeued for theire owne truth.

This certainlie would be impoſſible for you to prooue, ſeinge you reiect the authoritie of tradition and the churches iudgment, by which onlie it is

aſſuredlie prooued. Furthermore you knowe, that our Sauiour ſpeakinge in his owne perſon, required not to be beleeued but by the teſtimonie of his workes,Ioh. 15. ſayinge: Niſi opera in eis feciſſem

Which doubtles they fulfilled, but they were not commanded in anie place to write all the ſame: neither doth it appeare by anie ſcripture that they did write all thinges which they taught men to beleeue and obſerue.

If you will therefore that it ſhould be beleeued that the Apoſtles wrot all things they taught, ſhewe it written, or acknowledge your ground to be falſe. The ſcripture teſtifieth that the Apoſties were commanded to teach all thinges neceſſarie to be obſerued, but that they were commaunded to write the ſame, it no where appeareth. If therefore they did it, either they did it by Chriſts commaundement, and then you muſt needes confeſſe ſomething neceſſarie to be beleeued more then is written; for it is no where written that he commaunded them to write all thinges they taught. Or they did it without his commaundement. And then it was not neceſſarie they ſhoulde doe it, and conſequentlie was it not neceſſarie there ſhould be anie thinge written at all in the newe teſtament. And thoughe they writte nothinge but that was inſpired into them, yea & that they were inſpired to write, both which thinges you beleeue, thoughe you finde neither of them written, yett it no where appeareth, that they were inſpired to write all they had by inſpiration.

If therefore you will admitte of theire doctrine, though not taken out of the ſcripture, why doe you profeſſe that nothinge is to be beleeued, but that which is written and contayned in the ſcripture.

               The Baptiſme of infants may by good and neceſſarie conſequence be deriued from the ſcriptures

otherwiſe your friend Bellarmine hath brought chaffie arguments againſt the Anabaptists. The firſt is from the figure of the olde teſtament, children were circumciſed, therefore they ought to be baptiſed: this is ſo stronge ſaith he that it cannot be eluded. The ſecond is taken out of the thirde of Iohn. Except a man be borne againe of water and the holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen. Whereunto may be added Chriſts commaundment Matt. 19. 14. Suffer little children to come vnto me, for of ſuch is the kingdome of heauen. And in howe manie places doth S. Aug. prooue from the holy ſcriptures, the neceſsitie of Baptiſme againſt the Pelagians, who imagininge children to be without original ſinne, thought it vnneceſſarie; wheras he sheweth out of Iohn that without it originall ſinne is not remitted, and therefore if it be needfull certainlie it is lawfull.

                  The arguments vſed by Bellarmine are not chaffie but ſubſtantially good, becauſe they are taken from the ſcripture interpreted by the authoritie of the churche, and the canonicall practiſe thereof, receiued from the Apoſtles, which is ſufficient to prooue the Anabaptiſts to be heretike denyinge the Baptiſme of infants to be lawfull. And ſeeing you confeſſe the teſtimonie of the 3. of S. Iohn to be ſo effectuall to prooue the lawfulnes of the Baptiſme of infants, you muſt likwiſe confeſſe Caluin and all his followers to be heretikes. For he denyeth the neceſſity of Baptiſme to ſaluation which is much more clearlie prooued out of that place, then is the Baptiſme of infants. And ſo whilſt you woulde auoyde one euill you fall into a worſe. The ſame inconuenience

followeth againſt you vppon the argument of S. Auguſt. For if he prooue rightlie againſt the Pelagians that Baptiſme is neceſſarie; he concludeth directlie againſt your Maſter Caluin.

For whereas Cyprian hath taught, that Baptiſme of heretikes was not good, and therefore to be reiterated, S.

are you deceiued to thinke that S. August: conceiued this to be an vnwritten tradition without ground of ſcripture, for thus he writeth. (That I may not ſeeme to prooue it by humane arguments, I will bringe foorth certayne documents out of the ſcripture). And whereas Cyprian had taught, that for proofe of this we must haue recourſe vnto the fountayne of Apoſtolicall tradition, that is the ſcriptures, S. Aug: approoueth it, and ſaith that the Apoſtles deliuered, that there is one God, one Chriſte, one baptiſme, and therefore baptiſme of heretikes is firme, and not to be repeated. When then he ſaith of this as of other thinges, that they are not founde in the Apostles writinges, nor in latter councells &c. And there be manie thinges which the whole churche doth holde, and therfore are well beleeued to be commended by the Apostles, albeyt they be not found written. Which wordes are in his 2. booke contra DonatiſtasI cited the ſame place you doe if you coulde ſee it, thoughe the printer added the other vnto it. cap. 7. and not lib. 5. cap. 27. as you cited them.

This is playne out of Aug. for hauinge vttered theſe wordes vrged by you, when he draweth to an ende of this diſputation, he thus concludeth. It might ſuffice that our reaſons beinge ſo often repeated and diuerſelie debated and handled in diſputinge, and the documents of holy ſcripture beinge added, and ſo manie testimonies of Cyprian concurringe.

By this tyme I thinke the weaker ſorte of men vnderstande, that the baptiſme of Chriſte cannot be violated, by the peruerſnes of the partie that geueth or receiueth it. Loe howe be bringeth documents out of ſcripture, to prooue that the peruerſnes of heretikes, peruerteth not the baptiſme of Christe, and therfore baptiſme ministred by hereticks is good.

               For answere vnto this, lett the iudicious readerBell. lib. 4 de verbo. cap. 11, reſponſ ad Ireneum. The heretikes abuſinge the authoritie of traditions prooueth theire authority, as it doth alſo that of the ſcriptures which they likewiſe abuſe. obſerue that it is the vſuall doctrine of Papiſts to teach, that all points of Christian beliefe, which are neceſſarie for all men, were publikelie preached by the Apostles to all men and recorded in the register of holy ſcripture. But beſides theſe there were diuers thinges committed to prelats and priests that were more perfect men, which they taught them a parte, accordinge to that which S. Paule ſaith, we ſpeake wiſdome amonge them that are perfect. And theſe be theire traditions which they would haue equallie credited with the ſcriptures. Nowe this was the verie doctrine of the auncient heretikes, Valentinians, Cerintheans, Marcionists &c. For abuſinge the ſcripture and aduancinge traditiōs grounded on the ſame foundation, as the fathers tell vs. And theſe be thinges which the proteſtants denie to be equall with the ſcriptures, for they graunt that the Apoſtles in the beginninge of theire embaſſage, write not the whole doctrine which they preached, but deliuered parte by worde of mouth, and parte by writinge; howbeit they conſigned the Canon of the ſcripture, and writte that formerlie they had deliuered as

Ireneus and August. doe teach. This beinge the true state of the question, if the papiſts meane not theſe former ſecret matters that Bellarmine mentioneth and are not written, his poſition is, de non ente. For that there is nothinge or faith nowe, which the Apostles did not after they preached either finde or leaue in writinge vnto the churche, and theſe beinge deliuered at first, partely by liuelie voyce, partely by letters, were to be embraced with like acceptance and creditt. But if he meane theſe ſecret doctrines deliuered a parte, and only by worde, neuer by them written, then we denie that the Apostles left any ſuch thinge equallie to be credited, with the holy ſcriptures, neither the allegations inferre anie ſuch matter.

the edifiinge of the people, as Aquinas iudgeth; it is farr from your inference, that vnwritten traditions are of equall creditt with the ſcriptures. Vincentius fauoureth not your traditions att all; For that which was committed to Timothie, is in his opinion the talent of catholike faith, whereof, he was not the author, but the keeper, not an ordayner, but a follower; not a leader but one that is ledd. Loe this is the catholike faith contayned in the ſcriptures, not traditions of other doctrine beſide them or without them.
            
            
               PILK.
               The depoſitum which S. Paule ſpeaketh of, is the whole chriſtian doctrine deliuered by the Apoſtles to theire diſciples to keepe, and to deliuer to others as is manifeſt, by the wordes followinge in the ſame text. O Timothie (ſaith he) keepe the depoſitum, auoydinge the prophane nouelties of voyces and oppoſitions of falſlie called knowledge. Verie litle of which doctrine beinge then written, it muſt neceſſarilie be vnderſtoode of tradition. And this is Vincentius Lirinenſis doctrine; which you cannott denie, though you would obſcure it a litle in wordes, ſayinge the depoſitum is the catholike faith; where if you meane, the thinges belieued▪ you ſay the ſame that I ſay, if you meane the act or habitt of faith, you ſpeake againſt common ſence.
               For that is not the depoſitum comitted to Timothie, by S. Paule, but the vertue of faith, geuen him by God, neither is it formallie oppoſed to the prophane nouelties to be auoyded by him; but the vertue or act whereby we aſſent vnto the articles of faith and verities propoſed vnto vs.

Theſe thinges were taught and hearde, and commended to faithfull witneſſes, therefore not written. The Bereans hearde S. Paule teach, but the ſame things they founde in the ſcriptures. Thus Aquinas interpreteth this place, theſe thinges which thou hast hearde of me and of Christe, I ſay not of one onlie, but confirmed by manie witneſſes vid. the Lawe and the Prophetts.

Paule therefore taught nothinge contrarie to the lawe and prophetts, yea thoſe thinges which he preached to the Iewes of our Sauiour Chriſte, he prooued to be conformable to theire owne prophetts. Which kinde of proofe to the gentills would haue been of ſmall moment, and therefore you ſee your argument not to be effectuall nor to conclude vniuerſallie.
                  Againe why doe you vſe the like manner of reaſoninge which you reprehended in me a litle before, concludinge that becauſe S. Paule at one tyme, or in one audience preached nothinge without the lawe, and prophetts; that therefore neither he or

anie other tymes nor anie other of the Apoſtles▪ did preach anie thinge more then that which is contayned in them? Which kinde of argument thoughe I may iuſtly maintaine againſt you, as conformeable to your owne principles, denyinge traditions and beleeuinge nothinge but that which is written, yett are you ridiculous to vſe it againſt me, who profeſſe to beleeue manie thinges not written. And much more ridiculous you are to vſe it for the impugninge of traditions, aſſuminge that for the grounde of your proofe, which you knowe is denyed you, and which oughte firſte to be prooued.
                  Further where doe you finde in all the prophetts or Moiſes, the viſion whereof S. Paule maketh a recitall in the chapter cited by you? Certainlie no where. And yett this he preached with much vehemencie in an aſſemblie of greate perſonages, and himſelfe thought it worthy of beleefe. Somethinge therefore you ſee he preached more then that which was contayned in Moiſes and the prophetts. And this I geue you for an example onlie, and not as the ſole thinge wherein inſtance may be made.

By that tyme that you ſhall haue quitte your ſelfe of this argument, you will I ſuppoſe finde your owne not to deſerue the name of an argument, nor yett of a wittie Sophiſme. For to beleeue one only God, is able to make a man wiſe to ſaluation, becauſe it maketh him wiſe in ſome thinge neceſſarie to ſaluation, as no man of common ſence will denie.
