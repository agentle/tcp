               No wretched Father, no vnthriftie Sonne:
               
               No crauing subtile Whore, or shamlesse Bawde,
               Nor stubborne Clowne, or daring Parasite,
               
               No lying Seruant, or bold Sycophant.
               
               We are not wanton, or Satyricall.
               These haue their time and places fit, but we

               Heres all Iudicious friends; accept what is not ill,
               Who are not such, let them do what they will.

Chronologers many of them are so so Phantasticke, as
when they bring a Captaine to the Combate, lifting vp
his reuengefull arme to dispart the head of his enemie,
they'le hold vp his armes so long till they haue bestowed
three or foure pages in describing the gold hilts of his
threating Fauchion. So that in my Fancie the reader may well
wonder his aduersary stabs him not, before he strikes, moreouer
they are become most palpable flatterers alwaies begging at my

                     Garners of Snow, and Christals full of dew,

                     With Rackets made of Spheares, and Balls of Starres,
                     Playing at Tennis for a Tunne of Nectar.

                     I must needs confesse, this deuise to passe all
that euer I heard or saw, and thus it was, first hee takes a Faulcon,
and charges it without all deceiptes, with dry powlder
well canphred, then did hee put in a single bullet, and a great
quantity of drop shot both round and lach

fastens a post, vpon which he hangs me in a corde a Siderits, of
Herculean stone.

                     Well, well, I know it well, it was found out in Ida, in
the yeare of the world—by one Magnes, whose name it retaines,
though vulgarly they call it an Adamant.

arrested by the Sargent of Nature, and houered in the ayre
round about it, till they had lost the force of their motion, clasping
themselues close to the Stone in most louely manner, and
not any one flew to endanger the marke, so much did they remember
their duty to nature, that they forgot the errand they
were sent of.

practised this deuise often: once when I had a quarrell with
one of my Lady Veritas naked knaues, and had pointed him
the field, I conuaide into the heart of my Buckler an Adamant,
and when we met, I drew, all the foynes of his Rapier, whether
so euer hee intended them, or howsoeuer I guided mine arme,
pointed still to the midst of my buckler, so that by this meanes,
I haut the Knaue mortally, and my selfe came away vntoucht, to
the wonder of all the beholders.
