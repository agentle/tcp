               A SPEACH, Deliuered to the Kinges most excellent Majestie, at his Entry into his good Towne of EDINBVRGH, &c.
            
               HOw joyfull your Majesties returne (Gracious and dread Soueraigne) is to this your Majesties Natiue Towne, from that Kingdome due to your Sacred person by Royall discent, the countenances & eyes of these your Majesties loyall Subjects speake for their hearts. This is that happie Day of our New-birth, euer to bee retained in fresh memorie, with consideration of the goodnesse of th'Almightie our God, considered

with acknowledgement of the same, acknowledged with admiratiō, admited with loue, & loued with joy; wherein our eyes behold the greatest humane felicitie our heartes could wish, which is to gaze vpon the Royall countenance of our true Phoenix, the bright Starre of our Northerne Firmament, the Ornament of our Age, wherein wee are refreshed, yea reuiued with the heat and bright Beames of our Sunne, the powerfull Adamant of our Wealth; by whose remouing from our Hemisphaere, wee were darkened, deepe sorrow and feare possessing our heartes (without enuying your Majesties happinesse and felicitie) our places of solace euer giuing a newe heat to the feuer of the languishing remembrance of our wonted happinesse: The verie Hilles and Groues accustumed of before to be refreshed with the dewe of your majesties presence, not putting on their wonted Apparrell; but with pale lookes representing their miserie for the departure of their Royall King.
            I Most humblie begge pardon of your Sacred Majestie, who most vnworthie and vngarnished by Arte or Nature with Rethoricall coloures haue presumed to deliuer to your sacred Majesty, formed by Nature, and framed by education, to the perfection of all eloquence; the publike message of your majesties loyall subjectes, heere conuened vpon the verie knees of mine heart: Beseeching your sacred majestie, that mine obedience to my Superiours command may be a sacrifice acceptable to expiate my presumption:

your Majesties wonted clemencie may giue strength and vigour to my distrustfull spirites, in gracious acceptance of that which shall bee deliuered, and pardoning mine escapes.
            REceiue then, dread Soueraigne, from your Maiesties faithfull and loyall Subiectes, the Magistrates and Citizens of your maiesties good Towne of Edinburgh, such Welcome as is due, from these who with thankfull hearts doe acknowledge the infinite blessinges plenteouslie flowing from the paradise of your maiesties vnspotted goodnesse and Vertue, gouerned with the Scepter of Wisedome, nowe fiftie yeeres to this your maiesties natiue Towne, wishing your maiesties eyes might pearce into their verie heartes, there to beholde the excessiue ioye inwardlie conceiued of the first messenger of your maiesties princelie resolution to visite this your maiesties good Towne, increased by your maiesties constancie in prosequuting what was so happily intended, and nowe accomplished by your maiesties fortunate and safe returne, which no tongue, howe liberall so euer, is able to expresse.
            WHo shall consider with an vnpartiall eye the continuall carefulnesse your maiestie hath had ouer vs from the first houre that Nature opened your maiesties eyes: The setled temper of your maiesties gouernament, wherein the nycest eye could finde no spot, your selfe as the life of the Countrey,

as the father of the people, instructing not so much by precept, as by example, your maiesties Court, the marriage place of Wisedome and Godlinesse: without impietie hee can not refuse to auouch, but as your maiesties prudencie hath wonne the pryze from all Kinges and Emperoures which standeth in degree of comparison: So hath your maiesties gouernament beene such, that euerie mans eye may bee a messenger to his minde, that in your maiestie standeth the Quint-essence in ruling skill, of all prosperous and peaceable gouernament, much wished by our Fore-fathers; but most aboundantlie, praised be God, enjoyed by vs, vnder your Sacred maiestie.
            For if wee shall in a view lay before vs the times past, euen since the first foundation of this Kingdom, and therein consider your maiesties most noble progenitoures; they were indeede all renowned princes for their vertues, not inferiour to anie Emperoures or Kinges of their time, maintained and deriued their Virgine Scepters vnconquered, from age to age, from the inundation of the most violent floods of conquering Sworde, which ouer-whelmed the rest of the whole Earth, and carried the Crownes of all other Kinges of this Terrestriall Globe captiues vnto thraldome: But farre short of your sacred maiestie, nature hauing placed in your sacred person, alone what in euery one of them was excellent, the senate house of the Planets being, as it would seeme, conuened at your maiesties birth, for decreeing of all perfections in your Royall person: The Heauens and

Earth witnessing your Heroicall frame, none influence whatsoeuer beeing able to bring the same to anie higher degree.
            IF wee shall call to minde the tumultuous dayes of your maiesties more tender yeeres, and therein your maiesties prudencie, wisedome and constancie in Uniting the disjointed members of this Common-wealth, who will not with the Queene of Scheba confesse hee hath seene more wisedome in your Royall person, than report hath brought to forraine eares.
            There is not of anie estate or age within this your maiesties Kingdome who hath not had particular experience of the same, and as it were, sensiblie felt the fruites thereof: The fire of ciuile discorde, which as a flame had deuoured vs, beeing thereby quenched, euerie man possessing his owne Vineyarde in peace, reaping that which hee hath sowne, and enjoying the fruites of his owne laboures: Your maiesties great vigilancie and Godlie zeale in propagating the Gospel, defacing the monumentes of Idolatrie, banishing that Romane and Antichristian Hierarchie, and establishing of our Church, repairing the ruines thereof, protecting vs from forraine inuasion. The rich trophees of your maiesties victories, more powerfullie atchieued by your sacred wisedome, and deserued more worthilie by your vertue, than these of the Caesars, too much extolled by the ancients; all ages shall recorde: and euen our posteritie shall blesse the

Almighty our God, for giuing to vs their Forefathers: A King in heart vpright as Dauid, wise as Salomon, and godlie as Iosias.
            THis also your majesties Good Towne of Edinburgh is not the lest witnesse of your majesties royall beneficence, and superexcellent wisedome, which beeing founded in the dayes of that worthie King, Fergus the first, builder of this Kingdome, and famous for her vnspotted fidelitie, to your maiesties most noble progenitours was by them enriched with manie Freedomes, Priueledges, and Dignities, which all your maiestie hath not onelie confirmed, but also with accession of manie more enlarged, beautifying her also with erecting of a Colledge, famous for profession of all liberall Sciences: So that shee justlie doeth acknowledge your majestie as the author and conseruer of her peace, her sacred Phisition, who bound vp the woundes of her distracted Commonwealth, the onelie magnes of her prosperitie, and the true fountaine from whence, vnder God, all her happinesse and felicitie floweth, and doeth in all humilitie recorde your majesties Royall fauoures extended towardes her aswell absent as present.
            WEe should prooue most vngratefull, if wee should passe ouer in silence your maiesties sacred wisedome, in disposing of the gouernament of this your maiesties natiue Kingdome, during your maiesties absence, and placing such subalterne

magistrates and officers of the Crowne, within the same, who haue shined as cleare Starres in this firmament, keeping euer the prescript of your maiesties Royall commandes, watching for the good of your maiesties Subiectes, and squaring all their actions to your maiesties frame, as their paterne: and returning all their springes to the same fountaine from whence they themselues receiued influence of vertue: beeing vigilant in nothing more than in procuring the good and peace of this Church and Commonwealth: To approue their loyaltie to your maiestie and to knit vs your maiesties Subiectes in a more firme knot of obedience to your sacred authoritie.
            NEither hath the oceane of your maiesties vertues contained it selfe within the precinct of this Ile: What eare is so barbarous, that hath not heard of the same? What forraine Prince is not indebted to your sacred wisedome? What reformed Church doeth not blesse your maiesties Birth-day, and is not protected vnder the winges of your maiesties sacred authoritie from that Beast of Rome and his Antichristian locustes, whose walles your maiestie by the Soueraigne wisedome wherewith the Lord hath endewed your sacred person hath battered & shaken more than did the Gothes and Vandales, the olde frame othe same by their sworde: Would God as your maiestie hath made happie beginninges in drying vp their Euphrates, laying the nakednesse of that hoore open to the view of the world, & ruinating of that

Lernean hydra: So your maiesties dayes may bee prolonged, to see the accomplishment of the same.
            ALl this your Majesties Royall Storehouse of vertues perpetuall vigilancie in managing of the publicke affaires, your prudencie in your actions, your vertue in your life, and your felicitie in all the Lord hath crowned, not onelie with continuance of your maiesties peaceable gouernament ouer vs, your natiue Subiectes more yeares nor anie of your predecessoures reignes attained vnto: But also with accession of three great Kingdomes, and made your name famous thorow the whole Earth aboue all the Princes of your time.
            And therefore, wee your maiesties most humble Subjects doe in all submission of minds acknowledge your maiestie, not onelie for our just and lawfull Prince; but also the first founder of the United Monarchie of this famous Ile, borne for the good of the same; who during the whole time of your maiesties most happie reigne, hath so in publicke carried your selfe ouer vs your maiesties Subiectes, as if yee were priuate, no man could lay anie imputation or blotte to your vnspotted life, who neuer more desired to bee aboue vs than for vs, nor to bee accounted great than good: joyning euer to your maiesties power modestie and true pietie: And that as for your sacred vertue, your maiestie deserueth to bee Monarch of the worlde: So for your pietie and vnfained zeale in propagating and maintaining of the Gospel, doth of

due appertaine the true titles of the most Christian and Catholicke King.
            FOr the which all your Majesties Royall fauoures hauing nothing to render but that which is due, We your Majest. humble Subjects, prostrate at your Majest. sacred feete, lay downe our Liues, Goods, Liberties, and whatsoeuer else is most deare vnto vs: and doe vow to keepe vnto your sacred Majesty vnspotted Loyaltie and Subjection, and shall euer bee readie to sacrifice and consecrate our selues for maintainance of your Royall Person and Estate: Praying th'Eternall our God, that Peace may bee within your Majesties Walles, Prosperitie within your Majesties Palaces, Length of Dayes to your Sacred Person, One from your Majesties Loynes neuer wanting to weigh the Scepter of these your Majesties Kingdomes, And that Mercie may bee to your Majestie and your Seede for euer.

               ORATIO PER EVNDEM SERENISSIMO REGI EXHIBITA.
            
               REditum tuum (Rex Maxime) fortunatissimum, in Regnum hoc tuum, & vibem hanc diu & anxie probis omnibus expetitum, Obvius gratulatum tibi hic prodit confessus: O foelicem hunc diem, albo notandum lapillo, & altissimis pectoribus ad perpetuam divini beneficii memoriam insculpendura, qui te sospitem & salvum iam pene post tria lustra in patriam reducem tuis, tuosque tibi subditos arctissimo amore, & obsequio obnoxios, restituerit.
            
               Venisti tandem tuaque expectata popello
               Vicit iter durum pietas.
            
            Difficilis admodum mihi imposita est provincia publicam omnium laetitiam, benignos singulorum affectus,

innatam animorum in patrem patriae benevolentiam, coram Rege ipso non orationis elegantiarum modo, sed & rationis ponderum scientissimo, tanto etiam doctissimorum stipato comitatu verbis exprimere: In hanc tamen partem, vt officio promptus dicar, peccare malui & paupertini ingenii maciem obsequendo publicare, quam sub rustico pudore in tanta omnium oblectatione, in tam celebri & quasi insperato totius patriae gaudio obmutescere: quamvis tuarum laudum testimonia, quae ego ingenii culpa enarrando non deteram, in subditorum pectoribus inhaerescere, quam in linguis versari malueris. Ludet operam profecto & frustra fuerit, qui ineffabilem Scotorum & devotissimae huius vrbis voluptatem sermone commemorare, nedum exaequare studuerit
            Verus amor nullum novit habere modum.
            Quocunque oculos circumflexeris, quocunque gressum contuleris, circumspice, omnium ora, oculosque in te vnum admiratione veneranda & amico intuitu defixa invenies,
            
               —utinamque oculos in pectora posses
               Inserere & sanctos intus deprendere amores.
            
            Herbae & semina hiberno frigore & nive obtecta, quae in terrae visceribus hieme, quasi sepulta & obruta delituerunt, vbi primum ab austro ad Septentrionem mundi ille oculus, qui accessu & vitali calore suo inferiora reficit, vegetatque, ascenderit, protinus capita sua exerunt, & in dias auras luminis erumpentia

advenientem quasi Phoebum virore suo & colore ver. no salutant: Scotia tua illuvie, vastitudine, quotidiano moerore propter dilectissimi Regis absentiam hucusque squalida & lugubris in lessu & tristitia contabuit: verum exoptatissimo tuo in patriam audito reditu, tanta omnium animos laetitia invasit, tam subitum & certum exortum est gaudium, vt divino quodam afflatu repente immutatos dicas: ipsaque
            
               Scotia quae fuerat globus & sine imagine moles
               Nunc redit in faciem membraque digna Deo.
            
            In risus abeunt lachrymae, sua gaudia quisque sermone & vultu celebrat: Quare, ne in tanta animorum exultatione, Nos, quos potissimum tua praesentia beasti, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                in hac scaena videamur praefectus, Consules, Senatores, Populusque tuus Edinburgenus, quem vndatim ex aedibus erumpentem ad solis tui iubar spectandum: Cernis 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                suum clamant, fausta omnia & foelicia adventui huic & adventanti ex intimo pectoris sensu comprecantur & vovent: vt si prius torpore, in senium effaeta quasi, & desita haec tua vrbs (Serenissime Princeps) diuturna tua absentia vergere quotidie & marcescere hucusque caeperat, dum cui se ornaret, cui aedes instrueret, cui lautius se decoraret: Te, suis orbata delitiis, non haberet. Gratissimi tamen reditus vix rumor levissimus, incerto authore, fuerat dispersus, cum Templa, forum, compita, privatae aedes, quantum contracti temporis tolerare posset angustia, ad testandam hilaritatem non aspernando nitore refecta sunt, quin &

caementa jam ipsa, & parietes gestire videntur & adventum tibi gratulari; quod fortasse vehementiore delibuti gaudio tui cives, licet explicata & serena fronte prodeant, iucunditatis magnitudine & nimietate pene obruti viva voce explicare non possunt.
            
               I am sylvae iamque antra loqui, iam vivere fontes,
               I am sacer horror aquis, aditisque effunditur echo
               Clarior, & faustae spirant praesagia rupes.
            
            Tullianam fidem apud plerosque in hunc diem ancipitem, pro certa hodie confirmandam contendam: Diagoram Rhodium cum tres filios Athletas eodem die vincere & victores coronari vidisset, populumque gratulabundum flores in eum vndique iacere, in stadio spectante populo in manibus & oculis filiorum animam prae laetitia efflavisse: Plerique sic proculdubio immensa aspectus tui voluptate correpti ac meritissimae incolumitatis delectatione perfusi repente exspirarent, si non salutiferâ regiae tuae munificentiae aura afflati: Respirare denuo & reviviscere cogerentur: Innumeris tuis beneficiis, quibus Scotiam tuam praesens absens cumulate affecisti, maius aut gratius accidere nullum potuit, quam recens & continuata nativi soli recordatio, quam non maximi imperii altitudo, non charissimae coniugis amplexus, non dilectissimi filii lachrymae, non vicinorum turbatis suis rebus opem petentium preces, non vaticani Iovis minae, non Harpyarum Societatis proditoris illius Iudae verius quam IESV subdolae fraudes, non longissimi itineris taedium, non quod in humanis tibi

charissimum, extinguere aut delere valuerunt: Quin Scotos tuos, quorum frequenti sermone fidelitatem, & amorem publice praedicâris, praedicando collaudâris, collaudando memori pectore collocaris, & natalitiam hanc tuam vrbem inviseres, & totius hujus regni administrationem, non auribus sed oculis subjiceres. Certe verius de te praesagiuisse, quam de se dixisse videtur Vespasianus, Imperatorem stantem mori oportere: vtpote qui sicut militares stationes in excubiis contra hostem, in perpetua es vigilia & assidua Reipublicae cura, nec tam praeesse, quam semper prodesse vis, nec tibi tam subditos datos quam te subditis arbitraris: vt non solum tui, sed & exteri dubitent, tuamne magis nunquam intermissam pro Reipublicae bono vigilantiam, in actionibus prudentiam, in vita virtutem, an in omnibus foelicitatem admirentur, & vere exclament.
            
               Quae te cum laeta tulerunt
               Secula; qui talem tanti genuere parentes!
            
            Solus ex omnibus mortalibus placuisti; electusque es, qui supremi Regis vice in terris fungere, vitae necisque gentibus arbiter, cujus in manu qualem quisq. statum sortemque habeat, est positum: O dignitas vicarium Dei esse & non esse aemulum! In vnius animum totius Reipublicae curam admittere, & vniuersi populi suscipere fata, oblitumque quodammodo sui, gentibus vivere, innumerabiles vndique nuntios accipere, Totidem mandata dimittere, Noctes omnes, Diesque perpeti solicitudine pro salute omnium

cogitare: Absque quo esset antiquissima gens Scotia diuturna ista pace, sincero religionis cultu, Incorrupta Iustitia tam placide non frueretur.
            
               Nulla rel cta foret Scotorum nominis▪umbra
               Ni pater hic gentis iamiam ruitura subisset
               Pondera, turbatamque ratem, certaque levasset
               Naufragium commune manu.
            
            Permagna equidem, immortales Deo Optimo Maximo, in perpetuum nobis agendi gratias offertur occasio, sive illibatam illam iam quinquaginta annos aequissimi tui dominatus foelicitatem ante oculos proponamus, quum & ciuili dissentione & Ecclesiae exitio miserè labefactaretur respublica: Tu protinus vt alter Asclepiades exortus es, qui salutarem ei dexteram medicinamque porrexisti: A vi & tyrannide exterorum qua frequentius infestabamur, vindicasti, sive elapsa á regni conditu revocemus tempora▪ Maiores tui strenui omnes & egregii licet principes praecipuis illa tempestate regibus quibuscunque aut Caesaribus conferendi vixerunt: Tibi tamen longe secundi cedunt: quicquid enim in omnibus aut singulis insigne & divinum fuerat: Natura rerum opifex, id omne simul & semel in te vnum tanquam archetypum congessit: Illi equidem, vt tempora ferebant, domi, boni, militiaeque, foelicibus auspiciis imperitarunt, quorum tamen res gestas fulgore tuo ita praeradias, vt si cum tua regni gerendi peritia componantur
            
               
               Quanto nauem qui temperat anteit
               Remigis officium, quanto dux milite major
               Tantum omnes superas.
            
            Singulare etenim illud & eximium, si cum reliquis terrarum gubernatoribus conferantur, Majores tui tenuerunt, quod in tanta & tam frequenti, rerum & naturae ipsius vicissitudine, cum omnia susque deque multoties raperentur & migrarent, subitaeque regnorum mutationes euenirent, nulli vnquam externo imperio vi aut armis subacta Scotia tua paruerit, sed suo sibi regi hereditario (quod atavorum omnium beneficium commune est) per duo millia annorum libera & obsequens, liberum & immune sceptrum conservarit. Illud tamen tui vnius proprium ac vnicum fatemur, quod vt acceptum & traditum per tot saecula regnum incolume retinueris: Ita solus & primus sis: qui vniversam insulam, armis & dissidiis antea distractam & inimicam, in amicam ditionem redegeris.
            Avitamque insuper Hyberniam, cui primas Cunas & Originem Scoti debent, vectigalem & morigeram reddideris. Neque enim Deus Optimus Maximus, Te tantummodo parta tueri voluit sed
            Qua latam occidaus Naereus circumsonat oram
            Augere dilatare, & venturis nepotibus per te subiicere decrevit. Quam iniqua conditione sub tuis (Rex Invictissime) natalibus haec patria vastitatem spectans iaceret, & quam exinde indulgentem tuo ductu fortunam habuerit, examussim si perpendamus, neminem

arbitror candidiorem paulo qui non privatim se fructum vberem imperii tui percepisse fatebitur: Nonne commune illud implacabilis odii incendium, quod vltroque citroque conflagrabat, restinctum est: Nonne absque furto & rapinis vnicuique fortunis suis secura fruendi facultas est?
            
               Tutus bos etenim rura perambulat
               Nutrit rura Ceres, almaque faustitas
               Pacatum volitant per mare navitae
               Culpari metuit fides.
            
            Haec illa nimirum tantopere majoribus & toties exoptata tempora, nobis etiam priusquam obtigerant, suspiriis & fletu advocata sunt. EDINBVRGVM etiam Regiam tuam in se fusius munificentiam testabitur: Cujus licet eadem cum Fergusio Cunabula & spectata in principes & Majores tuos (Rex Serenissime) fidelitas & obsequium, novas subinde dignitatum accessiones & incrementa fecerunt, Solus tamen tu extitisti, qui paeonia manu Ecclesiae nostrae cladem, Reipublicae eversionem, obductasque cicatrices & plagas in integrum persanisti, Academiam insuper omnibus praeclaris florentem studiis, quae vt Hermodorus ille Ephesius virtute & aemulatione solummodo displicet, ampliasti: Inhumanum esset & illiberale admodum hic consultissimam tuam silentio praeterire prudentiam, qui Consilio, solertia, longissimoque rerum vsu edoctos integerrimos huic Regno absens Consiliarios & Magistratus praefecisti, qui dies noctesque te tanquam prototypum, ad cujus exemplar omnem suam administrationem & actiones conforment,

statuisti ne quid temere aut inconsulto, sed omnia ad praescriptum tuae voluntatis, & rationis perpendiculum & subditorum emolumentum tanquam vnicam impositi muneris metam collimarent: vt si non praesenti nutu, Iussu tamen & mandato tuo tu ipse omnia dirigeres. Sed quid his terminis basilicas tuas circumsepio virtutes: Cujus fama orbem terrarum cum laude pervagata est, cum longissimi principes regendi prudentiam tibi debeant, Orthodoxae Ecclesiaete vt Cynosuram, vbique terrarum sequantur, Constantinum

Tu es, qui harpyas obscaenas illas volucres, quae rapinis contactuque omnia foedant immundo (Iesuitas scilicet vel Esuitas potius intelligo) tuis finibus abegeris, & exterminaris: Atque utinam sicuti foeliciter hosce polypos & stelliones profligare occaeperis, ita ad vltimum persequi perdures, praecamur.

               Quo nihil majus meliusve terris
               Fata donavere bonique divi,
               Nec dabunt quamvis reddant in aurum
               Tempora priscum.
            
            Quam in hodiernum diem maioribus tuis illabatam fidelitatem servavimus, quodque tibi obsequii nostri sacramentum inviolabile nosipsi diximus, in perpetuum tibi tuisque praestituros nos vovemus. Quare quod reliquum est (Serenissime Princeps) cives tuos devotissimos ad pedes advolutos aeterno mancipi nexu addictissimos quo solitus clementiae & beneficentiae favore dignare: Quaeque semel munifica liberalitate indulsisti, Religionem, Iustitiam, Immunitates, Privilegia, Academiam, tuere, confirma,

adauge. Nos coelestem parentem suppliciter & jugiter precibus & suppliciis, vt Patriae te patrem incolumem, integrum, valentem, diu esse velit, & iubeat, comprecamur.
            DIXI.
