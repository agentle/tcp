Fraternitie of Grocers, at the Confirmation and
Eſtabliſhment of their moſt worthy Brother, the Right
Honorable PETER PROBY, in the high Office
of his Maieſtus Lieutenant, Lord

            Taking beginning at his Lordſhips going, and perfecting
it ſelfe after His returne from receiuing the Oath of

Triumphs; the Right Honorable, PETER
PROBY, Lord Maur of this
Renowned City.
            
               TO be His Seruant, that hath ſeru'd
            Two Royall Princes, and deſeru'd
            So Worthily of Both; the Same

            THE TRIVMPHS OF
Honor and Vertue.
            
               IF forreine Nations haue beene
ſtrucke with Admiration at the
Forme, State, and Splendor of
ſome yeerly Triumphs, wherein
Arte hath beene but faintly
imitated: There is faire hope
that things where Inuention flouriſhes, cleere Art
and her gracefull Proprieties, ſhould receiue fauor
and encouragement from the content of the Spectator,
which next to the ſeruice of his Honor
and honorable Societie, is the principall reward
it lookes for; then not deſpairing of that common
fauour, this takes delight to preſent it ſelfe.
            And firſt, to beginne with the worthy loue of
his Noble Fraternity, after his Honors returne
from Weſtminſter, hauing receiued ſome ſeruice
vpon the Water, by the conduct of two Artfull

Triumphs. Viz. The Throne of Vertue, and the
Continent of Jndia; which alſo by Land attends
his Lordſhips moſt wiſhed arriuall, accompanied
with the whole body of the Triumph, which
neere vpon the time of his Honors approch are
decently and diſtinctly placed; the firſt, bearing
the Title of the Continent of India: A triumph repleniſhed
with all manner of Spice-plants, and
trees bearing Odour, attends his Honors arriuall
in Paules Church-yard; A blacke Perſonage repreſenting
India, call'd for her odours and riches,
the Queene of Merchandize, challinging the
moſt eminent Seate, aduanceth her ſelfe vpon a
bed of Spices, attended by Indians in Antique habits:
Commerce, Aduenture and Traffique, three habited
like Merchants, preſenting to her view a
bright Figure, bearing the inſcription of Knowledge,
a Sunne appearing aboue the trees in brighteſt
ſplendor and glory: The blacke Queene before
mentioned, lending a voyce to theſe following
words:
            
               The Speech.
               YOu that haue eyes of Iudgement, and diſcerue
               Things that the beſt of Man and Life concerne,
               Draw neere, this blacke is but my natiue dye,
               But view me with an Intellectuall eye,
               
                  
As Wiſe men ſhoote their beames forth, you'le then find
               A change in the complexion of the mind;
               I'me beauteous in my blackneſſe, O yee Sonnes
               Of Fame and Honor, through my beſt part runnes
               A Spring of liuing Waters, cleere and true,
               Found firſt by Knowledge, which came firſt by you,
               By you, and your examples, bleſt Commerce,
               
               That by Exchange ſettles ſuch happineſſe,
               Of Gummes and fragrant Spices, I confeſſe
               My Climate Heauen do's with aboundance bleſſe,
               And thoſe you haue from me, but what are they
               Compar'd with Odours whoſe ſent ne're decay,
               And thoſe I haue from you, plants of your youth,
               The Sauour of eternall life ſweet Truth,
               Exceeding all the odoriferous ſent,
               That from the beds of Spices euer went:
               I that command, (being proſp'rouſly poſſeſt)
               The Riches and the Sweetneſſe of the Eaſt,
               To that fam'd Mountaine Taurus ſpreading forth
               My balmy Arme, whoſe height do's kiſſe the North,
               And in the Sea Eoum laue this hand,
               Account my bleſſings not in thoſe to ſtand,
               Though they be large and fruitfull, but confeſſe
               All wealth cons;iſts in Chriſtian holyneſſe,
               To ſuch caeleſtiall knowledge I was led;
               By Engliſh Merchants firſt enlightened,
               
                  
Jn Honor of whoſe memory, onely Three
               I inſtance here, all of this' Brotherhood free,
               To whoſe Fames the great Honor of this howre
               Aptly belongs, but to that Man of Power
               The firſt and chiefeſt, to whoſe worth ſo cleere,
               Iuſtice hath giuen her Sword vp for a yeere:
               And as yo'n Sunne his perfect ſplendor ſhowes,
               Cheering the Plants; and no Cloudes interpoſe
               His Radiant Comforts; ſo no Earthy part
               Which makes Eclipſes in a Rulers hart
               (As in that glorious Planet) muſt come nye
               The Sunne of Iuſtice, all ſuch myſts muſt flye;
               You're in an Orbe of Brightneſſe plac'd and fixt,
               And with no ſoyle muſt Honor be commixt.
               So to your worthy Progreſſe Zeale commends
               Your Lordſhip, with your Graue and Noble friends.
               The Speech being ended, to adde a little more
help to the fainter Apprehenſions, the three Merchants
plac'd in the Continent, haue reference to the
Lord Maior and Sheriffes, all Three being this yeer
Brothers of this Ancient and Honorable Society,
which triple or three fold Honor hapned to this
Worthy Company in the yeere 1577. Sir Thomas
Ramſey being then Lord Maior, and Maſter Nicholas
Backhouſe and Maſter Francis Bowyer, Sheriffes;
hauing cohereuce with this yeeres Honor,

matcht and paralell'd with theſe Three their as
worthy Succeſſors, the right Honorable, Peter
Proby, and the generous and Nobly affected, Maſter
Iohn Hodges, and Sir Humphrey Handford Sheriffes
and Aldermen.
               By this time his Lordſhip being gracefully conducted
toward the Chariot of Fame, which awaits
his Honors approach neare the little Conduit in
Cheape; Antiquitie a graue and reuerend Perſonage,
with a golden Regiſter-booke in his hand,
giues life to theſe words:
            
            
               The Speech.
               OBiects of Yeeres and Reuerence greete mine eye,
               A Sight moſt pleaſing to Antiquitie;
               
               I neuer could vnclaſpe this Booke of Fame
               Where Worthies dwell by a diſtinguiſht Name,
               At a more comely ſeaſon; I ſhall tell
               Things ſprung from Truth, neere kin to Miracle;
               With that of later dayes I firſt begin,
               So backe into the deeper Times agen:
               I onely touch Thy memory (which I know
               In thankefulneſſe can neuer be found ſlowe)
               With Heauens miraculous Mercy, to Thy Health
               After ſo long a Sickneſſe, all the wealth
               
                  
Which thou with an vnuſuring hand haſt got
               Which is not the leaſt wonder worthy note,
               (Truth makes me ſpeake things frely) cannot be
               A greater worke then thy recouerie,
               Nine Brethren-Senators thy Seniors all
               Whoſe times had beene before thee, Death did call
               To their eternall Peace, from this degree
               Leauing their earthly Honor now to thee,
               Thinke and be thankefull ſtill, this ſeemes the more
               Another obſeruation kept in ſtore,
               For ſeuenteene Senators ſince thy time were choſe
               And to this minute not one dead of thoſe.
               Thoſe are not vſuall notes, nor here it endes,
               The Court and City two moſt Noble Friends,
               Haue made exchange a late, I reade, from hence
               There ha's gone ſome moſt worthy Citizens
               Vp to the Courts aduance; in lieu of that
               You haue a Courtier now your Magiſtrate,
               A Seruant to Elizabeth the bleſt,
               Since to K. Iames that raignes with Salomons breſt.
               Kept the Records for both, from the Queene tooke
               Charge of three hundred Horſe, three thouſand Foote,
               Foure Attributes cleaues to this Man of Men,
               A Scholler, Souldier, Courtier, Citizen,
               Theſe are no vſuall touches, to conclude
               (Like to his life with bleſsings ſo endude)
               
                  
Ha's choſe his Brotherhood, men of that Fame
               For Bounty, Amity and honored Name
               The City bounds tranſcend not in their place,
               And their word makes e'm proſper, God grant grace.
               
               Honor they neuer wanted, when wa'ſt ſeene
               But they had Senators to their Bretheren
               Nay, one record here to make ioy more glad,
               I finde ſeuenteene that were in Scarlet clad
               All at one time of this Fraternitie,
               Now fiue, for this houres honor brings forth three,
               Fame triple will make triple vertue ſtriue
               At whoſe triumphant Throne you next ariue.
               For farther Illuſtration there are contained in
Antiquities golden Legend, the Names of many
Worthies of ancient Time, by whom this Noble
Fraternity ha's receiued much honor, ſuch as were
the worthy and famous Sir Andrew Bockerell, who
was Lord Maior of this City, the ſixteenth yeere
of King Henry the third, and continued in the
Magiſtracie ſeuen yeeres together, alſo the Noble
Allen de la Zouch, who for his good gouernement
in the time of his Maioralty, was by King Henry
the third, created both a Baron of this Realme,
and Lord chiefe Iuſtice of England. Alſo that
famous Worthy, Sir Thomas Knowles, twice Lord
Maior of this honorable City, which ſaid Sir Thomas
                  
beganne at his owne charge that famous building
of Guild-Hall in London, and other memorable
workes both in the City and in his owne
Company, Reedifying alſo Saint Anthonies
Church; with many others that are faire Ornaments
to Memory. Viz. Sir William Seuenock, ſir
Robert Chichſley, ſir Stephen Browne, ſir Henry Keble,
ſir William Laxton, &c. Who by thoſe Vertues
that they were moſt addicted vnto in their lifetime,
are Illuſtrated by perſons of Brightneſſe in
the Throne of Vertue, the next part of Triumph
that preſents it ſelfe: next beneath Antiquitie, ſits
Authoritie, plac'd between Wiſedome and Innocence,
holding a naked Sword, a Serpent woond about
the Blade thereof, two Doues ſtanding vpon the
croſſe Barre of the Hilt, and two hands meeting at
the Pummel, intimating Mercy and Iuſtice, accompanied
with Magiſtracie, who holdes in his hand
a Key of gold, ſignifying both the Key of Knowledge
and of Confidence, the City Magiſtrate taking
into his truſt the Cuſtodie of the Kings Chamber,
the proper Title of the City; and which Key
of gold alſo ſtands in his Lordſhips Creſt, viz. an
Eſtridge holding a Key of gold in his Mouth, his
Necke circled with a golden Crowne.
               
                  
His Lordſhip by this time arriuing at the Throne
of Vertue, plac'd neere Saint Laurence-Lane end,
Receiues this greeting from her Deitie.
            
            
               The Speech.
               I See great Power approach; here makes a Stand,
               Would it with Vertue ought? for ſome Command
               Seemes ſo compleate in Selfe-Opinions Eye,
               It will ſcarce looke on me, but paſſes by;
               As if the Eſſence of my Deitie
               Were rais'd by Power, and not Power rais'd by me;
               But let ſuch Rulers know that ſo command
               They build the Empire of their Hopes on Sand▪
               
               Still This remaines, with Eye vpon me fixt
               As if he ſought to haue His ſplendors mixt
               With theſe of mine, which makes Authoritie meeke,
               And I'me ſo ficke of Loue to thoſe that ſeeke
               I cannot chooſe but yeeld; nor do's it wrong
               Great Power to come to Vertue to be ſtrong,
               Being but a Woman, mercifull and milde,
               Therein is Heauen with greater glory ſtilde
               That makes weake things, as Clemencie, and Right,
               Sway Power, which would elſe rule all by Might:
               It maybe ſaid you did but late paſſe by
               Some part of Triumph that ſpake Vertuouſly,
               And one ſuch Speech ſuffices; 'tis not ſo
               In taking of your office, there you goe
               
                  
From Court to Court, before You be confirm'd
               In this high place, which Praetorſhip is term'd;
               From Vertue, if to Vertue you resort,
               It is but the ſame courſe you haue in Court
               In ſetling of your Honor; which ſhould bee
               Redoubled rather, that I hope to ſee:
               So Power and Vertue when they fill one Seate,
               The City's bleſt, the Magiſtrate compleate.
               At the cloſe of the Speech, this Throne of Vertue
with all her Caeleſtiall Concomitants, and the other
parts of the Triumph, take leaue of his Lordſhip
for that time, and till after the Feaſt at Guild-Hall
reſts from Seruice; but the Feaſt ended, the whole
ſtate of the Triumph attends vpon his Lordſhip,
both to Saint Paules and homeward; and in Soper-Lane
two parts of the Triumph ſtand ready
planted; viz. the Throne of Vertue, and the Globe
of Honor, which Globe ſuddenly opening and flying
into eight Cants or diſtinct parts, diſcouers in
a twinckling, eight bright Perſonages moſt gloriouſly
deckt, repreſenting (as it were) the Inward
Man, the Intentions of a Vertuous and Worthy
Breſt, by the Graces of the Minde and Soule, ſuch
as Cleere Conſcience, Diuine Speculation, Peace
of Heart, Integritie, Watchfulneſſe, AEqualitie,
Prouidence; Impartialitie, each expreſt by Its proper

Illuſtration. And becauſe Mans perfection
can receiue no conſtant Attribute in this Life, the
Cloude of Frailty, euer and anon ſhadowing and
darkening our brighteſt Intentions, makes good
the Morality of thoſe Cants or Parts, when they
fall and cloſe into the full round of a Globe againe,
ſhowing, that as the Brighteſt Day ha's his ouercaſtings;
ſo the beſt men in this life haue their
Imperfections; and worldly Miſts oftentimes interpoſe
the cleereſt Cogitations, and yet that but
for a ſeaſon, turning in the end like the mounting
of this Engine, to their euerlaſting Brightneſſe,
conuerting it ſelfe to a Canopie of Starres: at the
foure corners below are plac'd the foure Cardinall
Vertues, Wiſedome, Iuſtice, Fortitude and Temperance,
by each of them fixt a little Streamer or
Banner, in which are diſplayed, the Armes of this
Honorable City, the Lord Maiors, the Grocers,
and the Noble Eaſt-India Companies: The outparts
of the Globe ſhewing the Worlds Type, in
Countries, Seas and Shipping, whereon is depicted
or drawne Ships that haue bene fortunate to
this Kingdome, by their happy and ſucceſſefull
Voyages; as alſo that proſperous Plantation in
the Colonie of Virginia, and the Bermudaes, with
all good wiſhes to the Gouernors, Traders and
Aduenturers vnto thoſe Chriſtianly Reformed
Iſlands.
            
            
               
               The Speech at Night, preſented by Honor,
A Perſonage mounted on the top of this
Vnparalel'd Maſter-piece of Inuention and
Art, the Globe or Orbe of Honor.
               Honor.
               BY Vertue you came laſt, and who brings home
               True Honor, muſt by Vertue alwayes come,
               The right Path you haue tooke then, ſtill proceede,
               For t'is Continuance crownes each worthy Deeds:
               Behold this Globe of Honor; euery Part
               It is compos'd of, to a Noble Hart
               Applyes Inſtruction; when t'is clos'd and round
               It repreſents the World, and all that's found
               Within the labouring Circle of Mans Dayes,
               Aduentures, Dangers, Cares, and ſteepie Wayes;
               Which when a Wiſe-man thinkes on, ſtrait he mounts
               To Heauenly Cogitations, and accounts
               The vexing Spirite of Care and Labour vaine:
               Lifting himſelfe to his full height againe:
               And as this Engine do's in eight Parts riſe
               Diſcouering eight Bright Figures, ſo the Wiſe
               From this Lifes ſlumber rowz'd, (which Time deludes,)
               Opens his Heart to eight Beatitudes:
               And as I (Honor) ouertopping All,
               Here fixe my Foote on this Orbicular Ball,
               
                  
Ouer the World expreſsing my Command
               As I in this Contemptuous Poſture ſtand:
               So euery good and vnderſtanding Spirit
               Makes but Vſe onely of this Life, t'inherit
               An euerlaſting Liuing; making Frends
               Of Mammons Heapes, got by vnrighteous Ends,
               Which happy Thou ſtandſt free from, the more white
               Sits Honor on thee, and the Coſt more bright
               Thy Noble Brotherhood this Day beſtowes;
               Expence is grac'd when Subſtance follow Showes,
               Now to no higher Pitch of Praiſe I'le come,
               
                  Loue brought thee forth, and Honor brings thee home.
               FOr the body of the whole Triumph, with all
the proper Graces and Ornaments of Art and
Workemanſhip, the Reputation of thoſe, rightly
appertaine to the deſerts of Maſter Garret Criſmas,
an Exquiſite Maſter in his Art, and a Performer
aboue his Promiſes.
            
            FINIS.
