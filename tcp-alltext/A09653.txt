            To the Right honourable VVilliam Earle
of Darby, Lord Stanly, Lord Strange, of Knocking

                  ARiſtoxenus (thrice noble Lord) held that
the Soule of man was Muſicke: But that
the being thereof was framed of Bumbees,
as the Pithagorians affirme: But for that it
is the ſubiect and obiect of all harmonicall
concents: Intimating heereby the dignitie
and high renowne of that Art, which deſcended
from ſo noble a ſtemme, ſeeketh by
all meanes poſsible to nobilitate the ſame,
and that man to bee vnfit for the ſociety and commerce of men, that honoureth
not ſo worthy a Jewell for the life of man. Which opinion verely
is worthy Ariſtoxenus, that is to ſay, a noble Philoſopher, yet how litle
ſquaring with the time, experience a perfect Miſtreſſe of truth hath a
long time taught. For who regardeth the melodius charmes of Orpheus,
or enchanting melodie of Arion? ſurely but a few, Quos aequus amauit
Iupiter dijs geniti, aut ardeus euexit ad aethera virtus. Of which
rancke ſeeing your Lordſhip hath giuen vndoubted teſtimonies of your
honour to bee one: Muſitions ſhould commit an vndiſcreet part of ingratitude
not to acknowledge ſo great a fauour. For mine owne part (who
am meaneſt of many which profeſſe this diuine skill, though not meaneſt
in good will & humble affection to your Honor) I muſt confeſſe my ſelfe
many waies obliged to your Lordſhips familie, not onely, for that my Father
and Brother receiued many graces of your Honours noble Father,
whom they followed, but that my ſelf had the like of your moſt honorable
Brother, euen from the firſt notice he chanced to take of mee. And therfore
(moſt honourable Lord) I haue heere preſented this oblation, howſoeuer
meane, a token of mine affectionate good will Loue, yea onely
deuoted to your Lordſhip, which if it may gaine your gracious acceptation,
will feare neither Zoilus nor Momus his reprehenſion.
