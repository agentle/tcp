                     CHAP. 1. Of the natiuity of Iohn the Baptist, and Chriſts birth and actions, vntill he is about 30. yeeres.
                     
                     THE yeere of the World, 4183. when Elizabeth, ſpouſe to Zacherie, the father of Iohn the Baptiſt was with childe (ſix moneths gone) Gabriel was ſent to Mary vnto Galile to Nazereth to intunate her conception, Luk. 1. 26 and an Angel to Ioſeph, Matth. 1. 20. Marie with Chriſt in her wombe went into the hill Country in haſt, vnto a Citie of Iuda to Zacharies his houſe, Lu. 1. 39. Marie went vp againe

being great with child, from Galile out of the Citie of Nazareth vnto Iudea, with Ioſeph vnto Bethleem, where Chriſt was borne, Luke 2. 4. 7. and laid in a Manger.
                     The firſt day after his birth, the Shepheards came at the voyce of the Angel to Ioſoph and Mary, Luk. 2. 11. and to the babe v. 16. who were the firſt publiſhers, v. 17.
                     After this time, the Wiſe-men came from the Eaſt to worſhip him, Matth. 2. 1.
                     The 8. day Chriſt was circumciſed. Lu. 2. 21.
                     The 33. day was the purification of Marie, and then Ieſus was carried to the Temple of Ieruſalem, to bee preſented before the Lord, Luke 2. 22. Simion receiued him in his armes, Luke 2. 28. and Anna likewiſe (who had liued ſeuen yeeres with her husband from her virginity, and had beene widdow foureſcore and foure yeeres) gaue thankes for him, Luke 2. 36. 37. 38.
                     The 2. yeere Chriſt was carried into Egypt, and tarried there two yeeres, Matth. 2. 13.
                     The 6. yeere Chriſt came out of Egypt, and fearing for Archelaus to goe to Iudea, turned aſide into the parts of Galile, and dwelt in Nazareth, Matth. 2. 23.
                     The 12. yere he to paſt Ieruſalem with Ioſeph and Mary, at the feaſt of the Paſſeouer, and diſputed with the doctors: frō thence he returned downe with them to Nazareth, and was ſubiect

vnto them, and hee increaſed in wiſedome and ſtature, and in fauour with God and man, Luk. 2. 42. 52.
                     In the 15. yeere of Tiberius, Luke 2. 23. Pontius Pilate his 4. yeere being Lieutenant of Iudea, Herod Tetrach of Galile, his brother Philip Tetrach of Itrurea, & Trachonites, Lizanias Tetrach of Abilene, Chriſt came from Galile, Matth. 3. 13. and was baptized by Iohn in Iordan, Mar. 9. 1. being about 30 yeeres of age.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. 11.
                     
                        Of Chriſts first yeres, publike functiō in preaching & working of miracles, being the 31. of his age.
                     
                     FRom Iordan he returned, and was immediately led into the wilderneſſe, where he was with the wilde beaſts, Marke 1. 13.
                     
                        Iohn hauing diſputed with the Phariſies at Bethabora, next the day pointed at Ieſus cōming to him: ſaying, Behold the Lamb of God, Io. 1. 29.
                     The next day Iohn ſtood againe, and two of his Diſciples & ſaid, Behold the Lamb. v. 35. 36.
                     The ſame day, about the tenth houre, Andrew and Peter followed him, Iohn 1. 39.
                     Chriſt on the morrow going to Galile, found Philip, v. 43.
                     The third day after, he came to Cana in Galile, and wrought the firſt miracle, Iohn 2. 2. 11.
                     After that he went down to Capernamn, with his mother, brethren, and diſciples; but they continued not many dayes there, Iohn 2, 12.
                     
                        
The Iewes Paſſeouer was at hand, and Ieſus went vp to Ieruſalem, and draue the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple, Iohn 2. 13.
                     At night Nicodemus came vnto him, Io. 3. 2.
                     After he came vnto the land parts of Iudea, Iohn 3. 22. When Iohn was baptizing in Enon, beſide Salim, v. 23. Ieſus left Iudea, and departed againe into Galilie thorow Samaria to Sychar, and conuerted the Samaritan woman, at the Well, Iohn 4. 5. where he abode two daies, Iohn 4. 40. and two daies after hee departed thence and went into Galilie, v. 43.
                     Againe, Ieſus came to Cana in Galilie, v. 46. and wrought the ſecond miracle, that ſame day, at the ſeuenth houre; healing the Rulers ſonne, verſe 52.
                     When Ieſus had manifeſted himſelfe in Galilie, Luke 4. 14. hauing fled thither becauſe of Iohns impriſonment, Matth. 4. 12. called Andrew and Peter at the ſea of Galilie, Mat. 4. 18. and Iames and Iohn, v. 21. paſſing round about Galilie, v. 23. his fame ſpread abroad thorow all Syria, v. 24. there followed him great multitudes out of Galilie and Decapolis, and Ieruſalem, and Iudea, and from beyond Iordan, verſe 25.
                     From Galilie he went to Nazareth, and leauing Nazareth went and dwelt in Capernaum: which is neere the ſea in the borders of Zabulon and Nepthalim, verſe 13. and there on the

Sabbath day went into the Synagogue and preached, Luke 4. 16. and cured one poſſeſſed, Marke 1. 21. In the ſame Citie alſo with the foure Diſciples, he healed the ſame day Simons mother in law of a feuer, Mar. 1. 29. and when eeuen was come and the ſunne downe, he healed many, verſe 32.
                     And in the morning very early before day, he aroſe & went out into a ſolitary place to pray, verſe 35. and when hee ſaw great multitudes about him, hee commanded them to depart to the other ſide of the water, Matth. 8. 18. there in the way to the ſea, hee refuſed three which offered to follow him, v. 19. Luke 9. 57. Then he came ouer to the other ſide of the ſea, to the Countrey of Gadarens, Marke 5. 1. who becauſe their diuells poſſeſſed their ſwine, beſought him to depart: and hee gate him vp into the ſhip and returned backe againe, Luke 8. 37. where the people were waiting for him v. 40. to whom hee taught out of the ſhip, Luke 5. 3. from thence hee entred into his owne Citie, Matthew 9. 1. then to Capernaum againe, Marke 2. 1. where hee cured the ſicke of the palſie, and after he had called Matthew, hee dined with him, Matth. 9. 9. where there was a great company of Publicans, and other that ſate at table with them, Luke 5. 29. where hee diſputed of Iohn & the Phariſies faſting, Mar. 2. 18. In the meane time while hee ſpake with

                     And vpon the way, a woman of the bloudy iſſue was healed in the preaſe, Mat. 9. 20. when he came to the houſe he healed two blind men, Matt. 9. 28. and one poſſeſſed of a diuel, v. 32.
                     After this, there was a feaſt of the Iewes, and Ieſus went vp to Ieruſalem: this is the ſecond Paſſeouer mentioned, and there at Betheſda a Cripple is healed on the Sabbath day, Iohn 5. 9.

                     It is written (O frailty) and earneſtly thinke of it; Is there not (Iob 7. verſ. 1.) an appointed time to man vpon earth, and are not his dayes as the dayes of an hireling, as a ſeruant longeth for the Sabaoth, and an hireling looketh for an end of his worke: ſo haue I had as an inheritance, the moneths of vanity, and painefull nights haue been appointed vnto me: If I laid me downe, I ſaid, when ſhall I ariſe? and meaſuring the euening, I am full with loſſing to and fro vntill the dawning of the day againe. 2 Cor. 15. 19. In this life onely wee haue hope in Chriſt, we are of all men the moſt miſerable, againe, Heb. 11. 13. & 13. 14. We are ſtrangers and pilgrimes vpon earth, wee haue no continuing Citie héere, but wee ſeeke one to come, Iob 14. 1. A man that is borne of a woman, is of ſhort continuance and full of
                        
                        trouble: he ſhoots forth as a flower and is cut downe, he vaniſheth alſo as a ſhadow and continueth not.
                     
                  
                  
                     Frailty.
                     
                        Much wealth and a ſhining eſtate ſhall I forgoe and leaue behinde me?
                     
                  
                  
                     Faith.
                     It is written, Eccleſ. 1. verſ. 1. Vanitie of vanities, and all is but vanitie, I haue made me great workes, I haue built me houſes, I haue planted me vineyards, I haue made me gardens and orchards, and planted in them trees of all fruits, I haue gathered vnto mee ſiluer and gold, and the choiſe treaſure of kings and prouinces, I haue prouided me men-ſingers, and women-ſingers, and the delights of the ſonnes of men: And I was great and increaſed aboue all that were before me: whatſoeuer my eyes deſired I withheld it not from them, I withdrew not my heart from any ioy: But then I looked of all my workes that my hands had wrought, and on the trauell that I had laboured to doe, and behold all is vanitie, and vexation of the ſpirit, and there is no profit vnder the ſunne: Therefore I hated life for the worke that is wrought vnder the ſunne is grieuous vnto me, for all is vanity and vexation of ſpirit, I hated all my labour wherein I had trauelled, I went about to make my heart abhorre it, for what hath man of his trauell, griefe of his heart, wherein hee hath trauelled

vnder the ſunne, all his dayes are ſorrowes, and his trauels griefe: his heart taketh not reſt in the night, which alſo is vanity.
                  
                  
                     Frailty.
                     
                        O but wife and children, & friends, lye neere my heart and miniſter thoughts of heauy woe vnto me, when I thinke of leauing them.
                     
                  
                  
                     Faith.
                     Remember (Frailty) what is written, Hee that loueth father and mother more then me, is not worthy of mee, and he that loueth ſonne or daughter more then mee, is not worthy of me: He is the Father of the fatherleſſe, and the widdowes Iudge, euen God in his holy habitation.
                  
                  
                     Frailty.
                     
                        O but God is angry with mee, and what ſhall I doe?
                     
                  
                  
                     Faith.
                     I will beare the wrath of the Lord, becauſe I haue ſinned againſt him, vntill hee 
                           •
                        lead my cauſe and execute iudgement for me: Then will he bring me forth to the light; and I ſhall ſee his righteouſneſſe, I will looke vnto the Lord, I will waite for God my Sauiour, my God will heare me: Reioyce not againſt me (O my enemy) for though I fall I ſhall riſe, when I ſhall ſit in darkeneſſe, the Lord ſhall bee a

                     Frailty.
                     
                        Sicknes and ſufferings are tokens of Gods anger towards man or woman.
                     
                  
                  
                     Faith.
                     God forbid: cleane contrary doth the

Lord ſpeaks for our comfort, as many as I loue, I rebuke and chaſten: Be zealous therefore 
                           Reuel. 3. 19 and amend: Againe, haue you forgotten the conſolation that ſpeaketh vnto you as vnto childrē: My ſon deſpiſe not the chaſtning of the

                        Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him, for whom the Lord loueth he chaſteneth, & he ſcourgeth euery ſonnc that he receiueth: 
                        
                           Heb. 12. 11 If yee indure chaſtning, God offereth himſelfe vnto you, as vnto ſonnes, for what ſonne is there, whom the father chaſteneth not: If therfore ye be without correction (whereof all are partakers) then are ye baſtards and not ſons: The righteous cry and the Lord heareth them, and deliuereth them out of all their troubles: The Lord is neere vnto all them that are of a contrite heart, and will ſaue ſuch as be afflicted in ſpirit. Great are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord deliuereth them out of all 
                              •
                            He keepeth all his bones, ſo that none of them is broken.
                     
                  
                  
                     Frailty.
                     
                        But death is dreadfull, and what a miſery of man is it to die?
                     
                  
                  
                     Faith.
                     I ſhall not die but liue, and declare the workes of the Lord, I ſhould vtterly haue fainted, but that I beleeue verily to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in the land of the liuing: Chriſt is to mce both in life and death aduantage; I deſire to bee looſed and to bee with
                        
                        Chriſt, which is the beſt of all: Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord: Euen ſo ſaith the ſpirit, for they reſt from their labours and their workes follow them.
                     
                  
                  
                     Frailty.
                     
                        But I ſhall periſh and be as though I neuer had beene?
                     
                  
                  
                     Faith.
                     Vnto my ſheepe that heere my voyce, I giue eternall life, and they ſhall neuer periſh, neither ſhall any plucke them out of my hand: My Father which gaue them mee, is greater then all, and none is able to take them out of my fathers hands, I & my father are one.
                  
                  
                     Frailty.
                     
                        Yet duſt I am, and to duſt I muſt returne?
                     
                  
                  
                     Faith.
                     We ſhall be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt Trumpet, for the Trumpet ſhall blowe, and the dead ſhall bee raiſed vp incorruptible, and wee ſhall bee changed, for this corruptible, muſt put on incorruption, and this mortall muſt put on immortalitie, &c.

                     Frailty.
                     
                        When I am gone, I am gone, and what hope is there after death?
                     
                  
                  
                     Faith.
                     
                        I know that my redeemer liueth, and
                        
                        that hee ſhall ſtand the laſt vpon the earth, and though after my skinne wormes deſtroy this body, yet ſhall I ſee God in my fleſh, whom I my ſelfe ſhall ſee, and my eyes ſhall behold, and no other for me.

                        Satan frighteth me with my ſinnes, and layeth the greatneſſe of them before me?
                     
                  
                  
                     Faith.
                     
                        But this is a true ſaying, and worthy of all men to be receiued: Ieſus Chriſt came into the world to ſaue ſinners, whereof I am chiefe? The bleſſed Apoſtle looked vpon himſelfe, as the greateſt finner in the world, and yet deſpaired not: But ſaith, for this cauſe hee was receiued to mercy, That Ieſus Chriſt ſhould firſt ſhew on him all long ſuffering vnto the enſample of them, which ſhould in time to come beleeue on him vnto eternall life.
                  
                  
                     Frailty.
                     
                        Sathan ſuggeſteth that my repentance is too late?
                     
                  
                  
                     Faith.
                     It is neuer too late that is ſincer
                           •
                         and true: the theeſe vpon the Croſſe came very late, yet to him was it graciouſly ſaid, This day ſhalt thou bee with mee in Paradice. Not preſuming therefore of mercy, and continuing in ſinne; but truely lamenting what was paſt, and leauing any further to offend wilfully, I alſo will ſay in hope, Lord remember me when thou commeſt into thy kingdome.

                        Yet God is iuſt and muſt needes puniſh my ſin?
                     
                  
                  
                  
                     Faith.
                     That iuſtice is ſatiſfied in the obedience of Chriſt, and each penitent ſinner may in comfort ſay: If any man ſinne, we haue an aduocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſinnes, and not onely for our ſinnes, but for the ſinnes of the whole world; For two titles our Sauiour Chriſt hath to the kingdome of heauen: the right of inheritance, and the merit of his Paſſion: The firſt belongeth to him, the ſecond he vouchſafeth to vs in his merit: therefore our merit is not to be truſted in. For as touching our merit, remember Dauid, Enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruant (O Lord) for in thy ſight no fleſh liuing ſhall be iuſtified. When ye haue done all theſe things that are commanded, you ſhall ſay, we are vnprofitable ſeruants?
                     
                     Wee haue done that which was once our dues to doe: Behold he found no ſtedfaſtneſſe in his ſcruants, and laid folly vpon his Angels; how much more in them that dwell in houſes of clay? whoſe foundation is in the duſt: yea the heauens are not cleare in his ſight: how much more is man adhominable and filthy, which drinketh iniquity like water. How may a man be iuſtified before God, or how can he be cleane that is borne of a woman: Behold, he will giue no light to the Moone, and the ſtarres are vncleane in his ſight: How much more man, a

worme, euen the ſonne of man which is but a worme. The Apoſtle againe, When the bountifulneſſe & loue of God our Sauiour towards man appeared, not by the workes of righteouſneſſe which wee had done: but according to his mercy hee ſaued vs by the waſhing of the new birth, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on vs abundantly through Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, that wee being iuſtified by his grace, ſhould be heires according to the hope of eternall life.
                  
                  Thus will faith euer finde comfort in the Word, to anſwere frailty in any point whatſoeuer of feare and fright, if it be ſought out by carefull reading.
                  
                     A Proteſtation in Sickneſſe.
                     
                        I Wrotched and woefull ſinner, yet redeemed with the precions bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, through his great loue, not my merit, proteſt before the all-ſéeing God, that I doe heartily deſire to die in the faith, wherein it becommeth a true member of the true Church to end this life. I beleeue and confeſſe all and euery part of the Chriſtian Faith, either expreſly mentioned, or truly compriſed in the twelue Articles: and generally, I beleeue whatſoeuer a Chriſtian man or woman ought to beleeue.
                     This immoueable and firme faith (God aſſiſting mee with his grace) I ſhall hold, as a

ſtrong and inuincible hold, againſt all the ſuggeſtions and aſſaults of Satan: Wherefore, if either by his oppugning tyranny, or my ſickeneſſe raging fury, I ſhall either ſpeake, doe, or thinke any thing repugnant and contrary to this. Now in this my better ſtrength both of body and minde, I diſclaime it, renounce it, abhorre it, and pray that it may not bee imputed vnto mee, as any word, worke, or thought of mine, but of Sathans malice and my ſickneſſe ſtrength. To my vttermoſt power I remit and forgiue vnto all perſons, all iniuries whatſoeuer at any time, or in any ſort done vnto mee: and earneſtly intreating them the like againe from them to mee in any faults, or errours of mine vnto them: and I humbly acknowledge, with true woe of a grieued heart, that to my God I haue not carried my ſelfe as I ſhould: my faults and offences, my faults and tranſgreſſions are bitter vnto mee: yet doe I not deſpaire, but laying hold by the hand of my faith. vpon my all powerfull and ſweet Sauiour, I humbly craue mercy, with bowed knées of heart and ſoule before him: I acknowledge his infinite goodneſſe to mee many and infinite wayes, and with heart and ſoule and all that is within me praiſe his holy Name: I commend into his hands my ſpirit, and though weake in body, yet ſtrong in him, I ſay and cry, Lord
                        
                        Ieſus, Lord Ieſus receiue mee to thee, Come Lord Ieſus, come quickly, Amen, Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     A Prayer in Sickneſſe.
                     O Lord, iuſt art thou, and iuſt and true are all thy iudgements, thy wayes are mercy and truth, and there neuer was or ſhall be any end of thy goodneſſe: I humbly beſéech thée to haue mercy vpon mee, and doe not reward mée according to mine iniquities: I haue ſinned, I haue ſinned, and woe is me for it; O thou preſeruer of men, thine I am, and in thee is my truſt: in thy feare let mee liue, in thy fauour let me die; Sweete God of my comfort, Bleſſed for euer and euer, Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     Another Prayer.
                     MEercy Lord, mercy moſt holy and comfortable God, to all truely ſorrowing ſinners; looke vpon thy wretch that ioyeth to be thine, although moſt vnworthy to be reſpected of thée: vniuſt things haue I done and my heart bléedeth for them; iuſt things doe I ſuffer in regard of thée my gracious God. I humbly acknowledge, if I looke what I haue done what I ſuffer is not anſwerable: but leſſ
                           •
                         doe I ſuffer then I haue deſerued: Deare Father, I acknowledge thy iuſtice ſo mixt with mercy, as neuer I can ſufficiently thank thee for it. Comfortable

God, giue ſtrength to my weakeneſſe, that more and more I may be able to doe that, which ſuch great goodneſſe of thine bindes mee vnto: where ſinne aboundeth, thy mercy ſuper-aboundeth, and ſhall not I feele it? Let not thy prayer depart out of my mouth whileſt I liue and breath; if outwardly I muſt ſuffer, yet inwardly comfort and indue mee with patience according to the multitude of thy mercies.
                     Thou knoweſt all, and thou canſt doe all and euer bleſſed be thy name, Amen, Amen.

                     No ſurety will ſuffice,
                     No hoping of delay:
                     No clamors nor no cryes,
                     But either die, or pay.
                  
                  
                     The band is by the ſoule,
                     The ſubſtance faith and troth,
                     And who are in the world,
                     Muſt looke vnto their oath.
                  
                  
                     The Iudge is wiſe and iuſt,
                     His Law is pure and cleere;
                     And at his preſence muſt,
                     All fleſh and bloud appeare.
                  
                  
                     The place ſhall be ſo great,
                     That none but ſhall haue roome▪
                     
                     But none that ſhall intreat,
                     To haue a partiall doome.
                  
                  
                     
                     All fleſh ſhall be indited,
                     Of conſcience accuſation,
                     Shall let none be acquited,
                     That ſinne ſends to damnation.
                  
                  
                     But ſuch as mercy craues,
                     That are for mercy crying:
                     And ſuch as mercie ſaues,
                     From the eternall dying.
                  
                  
                     Time ſhall yeeld vp his flowers,
                     And faith ſubſcribe to grace:
                     Nature yeelds vp her power,
                     Corruption hath no place.
                  
                  
                     And in an inſtant all,
                     A ſudden change ſhall ſee,
                     Then all the world ſhall fall,
                     Where ſhall no being be.
                  
                  
                     Rich, poore, both yong and old,
                     Faire, full and ſtrong and weake;
                     Wiſe, fond, both hot and cold,
                     The hearts of all ſhall breake.
                  
                  
                     The ſpirits ſhall all aſſemble,
                     And horrors hold the heart:
                     The iuſteſt ſoule ſhall tremble,
                     For feare of their deſert.
                  
                  
                     All are in ſinne contained,
                     But who for ſinnes are ſorry:
                     Shall be from death detain'd,
                     
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         of mercies glory.
                  
                  
                     
                     The rich muſt leaue his wealth,
                     And to the graue muſt hye:
                     The youth muſt leaue his health,
                     And learne the way 
                           〈◊〉

                     The faire muſt leaue to paint,
                     And tak
                           •
                        d earthly hue:
                     The poore muſt leaue to faint,
                     And bid the world adue.
                  
                  
                     The wiſe muſt leaue his wit,
                     And make the wormes a feaſt:
                     The foole muſt leaue his fit,
                     and make the graue his reſt.
                  
                  
                     No bribe ſhall buy an houre,
                     No gift procure a grace:
                     To ſweete the ſmalleſt ſower,
                     in the infernall place.
                  
                  
                     Since then the newes are ſuch,
                     The Day of Doome ſo nye:
                     And mercy doth ſo much,
                     With higheſt maieſty.
                  
                  
                     So none ſhall mercy craue,
                     With humble faithfull loue:
                     But ſhall in mercy haue,
                     The ioyes in heauen aboue.
                  
                  
                     And ſcape the paines of hell,
                     That doth to ſinne belong:
                     And with the Angels dwel,
                     To ſing a heauenly ſong.
                  
                  
                     
                        Let vs to mercy flye,
                     
                     
                        From ſinne and death to ſaue vs:
                     
                     
                        And vnto mercy cry,
                     
                     
                        That hell may neuer haue vs, Amen.
