                     •…
                   this clauſe is wont to bean nexed (I beleue in Ieſus Chriſt our lord) Anbic can not be declared, what ſtrength is in this worde, our lorde, for heere we witnes yt we doo beleue that Ieſus Chriſte, hathe brought and delyuered vs from the captiuitie of ſynne, death, hell, and the deuil vndernethe his domynion. And nowe doth rule all theſe enemyes, and that we through Chriſt, be higher then theſe enemyes: for Chriſt hath gotten vnto vs. and not vnto him ſelfe, a tryumphaunte victorie, of ſuche tyranycall enemyes. By what meanes Chriſte hath brought vs vnderneth his power: the ſequell & folowynge ſentences of our belief, doo more playnely teſtifye. And fyrſte, it foloweth, which was conceyued by ye holy

ghoſt, that is, I beleue Ieſus Chriſte our lorde to be conceyued in the womb of the holye Virgyn Mary, but not cō
                  ceiued by the meane of the ſeede of mā, but of the holy ghoſt, which in ye womb of the Vyrgyn Mary dyd make the ve ry body of Chryſte. And that is it, that Damel ſaith, the ſeconde Chapter, that Chryſte is the ſtone cut oute with oute handes, that is (as ſome men thynke) withoute the ſeede of man to be conceyued in the wombe of the Vyrgin Marye.
               And the Aungell Gabriel, luke the fyrſt chapter, the Vyrgyn demaundyng how ſhe ſhould conceyue a ſonne, ſeyng that ſhe neuer knewe man, he anſwered The holy ghoſte ſhall come vpon the, & the power of the higheſt ſhall ouer ſhadowe the. For this cauſe, Chriſt wold be conceiued by the holy ghoſt, that our vnpure conception gylty of dampnatiō (for in ſynne we are conceyued the .I. pſalme) ſhould be purged by hym, leſt for the ſyn of our conception, we ſhulde be caſte into eternall death: he therefore whiche doth beleue that Chriſte was cō
                  ceyued

by the holy ghoſte, in the womb of the virgyn his mother for hys cauſe, may trewly get and vendicate vnto him ſelfe purely, the conception of Chriſte: euē in lyke caſe as al other thyngs whiche Chriſte didde: for Chriſte is all ours: and all thynges which Chriſt dyd, they be to be accompted in the ſelf ſame place as if we had done them our ſelues, the which thynges when we haue certifyed oure ſelues in, wee can neuer be trow beled in anye other thynge anye more. Chriſte Ieſus whiche is oure lord, hath alwaye rule in vs, and euen the ſame which was conceyued by the holy ghoſte, clenſe throughly our vnpure conceptyon, and gyue vs his grace to beleue, that vndoubtedly it is all made cleane bye him. So be it.
            
            
               
               The fourth ſermon domeſticall to their chyldren, of Chriſtes byrthe.
               A Few dayes a go, welbeloued children, ye haue hearde that the churche of Chriſte doth beleue yt he is ye ſon of god, yt euerlaſtyng god, wt the eternall god the father in lyke power as the father. Row, when Chriſte the ſonne of god alſo is very man, it foloweth in the belief (I beleue in Ieſus Chriſte, which was borne of Mary the Virgyn) And here is great occaſion gyuen vnto me, to ſpeake largely of the byrthe of Chryſte. But when yt he is dyligentely written of by one of the Euangelyſtes and fyrſt of Sainct luke .ij. Chapter: Thyther will I ſende you. And at this tyme we will fyrſte intreate, what it is to beleue. Chriſt to be borne of Mary the Virgin. It is to declare brieflye, nothynge elſe then to beleue that Chriſte is the ſonne of God, takyng very humaine fleſh, of the Virgin, he was borne trew man and yt euen of the holy Virgin, whoſe flower of chaſtitie was not taken awaye, no:

chaunged, neither before the byrthe, neither in the byrthe, neyther after ye byrth. And for this cauſe, I do beleue that this thynge was done, that he ſhould cleane pourge as well my vnpure natiuitie, as al other mens, and that he ſhouldbe that promiſed ſeede vnto Abrahā our father in the which as well I, as all other men be bleſſed, that is, that we ſhould folow the remyſſion of oure ſynnes, and an eternall lyfe, and that we ſhoulde be deliuered from the power of the denyll.
               And fyrſte we muſte heere marke, yt euery man muſt ve

                  dycate and chalenge vnto hym, the natiuitie of Chryſt, and yt Chryſte was borne of the Virgyn Mary for his cauſe, and he muſte make hys ſoule to beleue that his natiuytie is truely pourged and made clene by Chriſtes natyuitte, and for to folowe the eternall ſaluation.
               And that this was no hyndrance vnto him, for this ſyngeth dayly the church, onles our lyttell ſonne Chriſt had byne born vnto vs, we ſhould haue peryſued for euermore, for this cauſe, for that we were conceyued in ſynne, and bor

We are borne ye childrē of wrathe, that is, wee of oure owne ſtrength do performe this one thyng for the which thinge, god is angry with vs and doth condempne vs. Chriſt therfore is borne, that we beyng the chyldren of wrathe, ſhoulde be made well beloued chyldren of god, by hys holy natyuytie and that he ſhoulde waſſhe awaye the fylthynes of oure ſynnes, of our vnpure natiuytie, throughe hys holy natiuytie. Paul to the Galathyaus ye iiij. Cha. de clareth briefly wherfor criſt was borne, when he ſayethe, But when the fulnes of tyme was come, God ſent his ſonne made of a womā that thoſe which were gyltie vnder the law, he ſhoulde redeme that we ſhould be taken for hys ſonnes by adoption: Saynt Paul meaneth here in hys ſaying, when the tyme was fulfil led, that Chriſte ſhoulde be ſente here in to this worlde, god the father not being requeſted, nor prouoked through our de ſeruynges, but through his vnſpeakeable mercy, towardes man kynde, ſente not aunge

not that the ſonne ſhoulde here loke after his own cōmodities & profites, but yt he ſhoulde vendycate and chalenge vs from condemnation of the lawe, which could not make amendes for our owne ſelues by our owne deſeruynges, for ye which he dyd abundantly make am
                     •
                  nds for vs, and he beyng the trew lambe of God, ſhould take awaye oure ſynnes Ihon the fyrſte Chapter: yt ſo by Chriſt the onely naturall ſonne of god, we the whiche ſhoulde beleue in hym, ſhoulde be made the ſonnes of adoption of the heuenly father, and the heyres of god & the coinherytours of Ieſus Chriſte, too the Romayns ye .viij. Chapter, which is ſoo greate a well ſprynge of eloquence that as it is euermore worthe & worthy, it can not be expownded: god the father ſhewynge to vs and towardes vs hys mercy in Chriſt Ieſu, what tong is able to declare or expres ye commodites whiche Chriſt Ieſu the ſonne of god and of Mary the vyrgyn, hath brought vnto vs by his holynatiuite? But what ſhuld we do? When god for y• his vnſpeakeable goodnes doth deſyre nothingels but

that we ſhould be thankefull vnto him, and gyue dayly thankes, both vnto god the father, and vnto our Chriſt, euen vnto hym, for that, that for oure ſaakes, he dydde voucheſafe hys onely Sonne, the cauſe of our helth, to be borne of the virgin Mary, to this end, that he obeying the will of his father, did not refuſe to take our fleſhe on him, and to make vs free from the curſe of the lawe, from ſynne, from the tyrany of the deuyl. Let vs therfore gyue thankes vnto god the holy ghoſte, for that he did make by his holy power, both the body and ſoule of Chriſte, in the wombe of the holy Vyrgyn, that CHRIST beynge verye man, ſhould get vs our ſaluatiō, & ſhulde bryng vs to euerlaſtinge lyfe, prayſe be vnto god the father and his ſonne Ieſus Chriſte, and to the holye goſt, now & euermore so be it.
            
            
               
               The fyfte Sermon domeſtical vnto their Children, of the paſſyon of Chriſt.

                  taſticall thinge, the tyme where in chriſt did ſuffer, verely whē Poncius Pylate was lieutenante of the Romain Impire, it is expreſſed very wel. What is it to beleue, that chriſt ſuffered vnder pontius pilate, this thinge is meante in it, that he ſhoulde make a mendes for my ſynnes, and therfore, to go vnto ſo vyle a death, for Peter in his firſt Epiſtle the ſecond chapiter, ſaith, Chriſt did beare in his body

our ſynnes, vpon the croſſe, where by we beinge dead to ſinne, ſhould lyue vnto iuſtice, with whoſe ſtrypes wee are made hole, & addeth vnto this thynge ye ſaying of Eſaye. In the .liij. Chapter. Truelye he did beare our infirmities, and he did ſuffer our paines. It is trulye by cauſe I wold expound ye thyng more at large. The paſſion of Chriſt after ye mind of ſainct Auguſtine, is two waies to be taken, firſt, as an holy ſacrament, & thē as an example, as a ſacrament trewly, for that it ſignifieth & kylleth ſynne in vs. As an example that we ſhould frely and

                  lilyngely heare all maner of euyls wt a good herte, whiche be ſente to vs by Chriſt, perſwadynge with our ſelues, yt all thooſe afflyctions in the paſſyon of Chriſt, are made acceptable in the ſyght of god, & that alſo, if nede ſhall require, we offer our ſelues to Chriſt, euē as a ſacrifice willyngly for oure neyghboures euen as Chriſte did offer him ſelfe a ſacrifyce for vs to god the father, as a ſmelle of a good and ſwete ſauer. Epheſyans the v. chapter. For whi Chriſt dyd ſuffer for vs, leauynge to vs an example, that

we ſhoulde folow his foote ſteppes, and here Chriſt ſayth, Mathew the .x, Chapter. Who ſo euer doch not take his cros and folowe me, is not worthy of me. Iesus Chriſte graunte that we maye take his paſſion with a trewe faythe, and we being once entred into his fote ſtepes, may come thyther where he is come, ſyttynge on the ryghte hande of god almighty.

               IT is not vnknowen vnto you (as I thinke.) welbeloued children, that we ſhal dye al once. Hebrues 9. chapter. For when euen vnto one, all we were giltie with ſinne, death began to rule all men, after theſe ſaiynges. 1. Corint. 13. Chap. The pricke of death is ſinne: and leſt death myght ſwalow you vp.

                  nnes, and breake the ſtrēgth of death, for the which we ſhould dye, and death woulde ſwalowe vs vp. Seeyng that therefore there is made ſatisfaccion for our ſinnes by Chriſt, death can no more deuour men: for why, the death of Chriſt is our death, the ſatiſfaccion of Chriſt for our ſinnes, is our ſatiſfaccion.

                  oth oute of the Prophetes, the Euaungeliſtes & the wrytyngs of the Apoſtles. For Daiud ſaith, Pſalm xv. He doth aſcend on hygh, he hath led captiuitie captiue, he hath giuen giftes to men, whiche place of the Pſalme, Paul dothe open. Epheſians the .iiij. Chapter. and in the fortye and ſyxte Pſalme. Dauid ſayth. Godde hath aſcended in gladneſſe and the Lorde in the voyce of the trompet. The fourtenth Pſalme, whyche hathe aſcended vpon Cherubyn, and hath taken hys flyght vpon the feathers of the wynd. The hundreth & nynth Pſalme. The lorde ſaide to my Lorde, ſyt on my ryght hand. Furthermore, Mark, xvi. and Luk .i. Chap. in thactes doth make

mention playnely in euery place of the ſtory of the aſcention of Chriſt. and Peter in his firſt Epiſtle ye .iij. Chap. Saith of Chriſte, which is on the ryght hande of god, ſyttynge in heauen. And Paul to the Ephe .v. Chap. After the efficacye and ſtrength of his power, whiche hee did exercyſe in Chriſt, when he ſhoulde be rayſed up from the dead, and to cauſe hym to ſyt on his right hand in heauen, ye do here how goodly the teſtimonies of holy ſcripture be brought in of the aſcencion of Chriſt. But euery man maye eaſily ſay. I beleue in Ieſus Chriſte the ſonne both of God, and of the Virgyn, whiche hath aſcended vp to the heauēs, and ſitteth on the right hand of god the father almightie. So doth not euery mā knowe the meaning of theſe wordes, or vnderſtande them, or beleue them. It is nothyng els to beleue that chriſte hathe aſcended vp to the heauens, and to ſytte on the right hand of God the father almightie, then that therefore Chriſte dyd lyft vp hymſelf from our ſyghte, that he myght haue to doe with all men, to rule in all men, to be preached of al men, and

that he might be in all men, and that he myght heare the prayers of all men, and helpe our cauſe, and defend vs againſt al euils, and to pray for vs, and to take the office of an interceſſour for vs, and an aduocate. Romains the eyght chapter, and the firſt epiſtle of S. Iohn the .ij. Chap. Furthermore, we muſte not thinke that Chriſt is farre frō vs, but we muſt thinke clene otherwiſe. Whē that he did walke here in earth, he was farre from vs: now truely after that he hath aſcended vp into the heauens, and there ſhall ſit on the ryght hand of god the father almightie, that is to ſaye, that he ſhoulde haue lyke power, glory, and honour, like kingdom wt god the father, he is nere vs, although our reaſon cannot compaſſe it, it maketh no matter, for it is an article of our faith we muſt haue a faythe of thoſe thynges which our reaſon can haue no vnderſtā

And now the courſe of our talke dooeth requyre, that we ſhould intreate now of god the holy goſt. The holy goſt alſo to be god, the holy ſcripture doeth playnly proue. But leſt I ſhould be tedious vnto you with the multytude of Scryptures I wyll bryng forth onely ſome places of ſcrypture, by the whiche ye ſhall knowe the deitie of the holy ghoſte, and that ye may both defend your conſcience frō the aſſaultes of the deuill.

                  , here Chriſt doth attribute the godhead vnto the holy ghoſt: for when I muſt beleue in the holye ghoſte, then I make hym a god, for I muſt beleue and put my truſt in no man, but in God. This argumente dooeth Razianzene the fifth 
                     •
                  oke of his holy writing vſe, whoſe words be theſe. But yf the holy goſt be a creature, how do we beleue in hym, or be confirmed in him? and it is not al one thyng, to beleue in any thyng, and to beleue of any thing for that thyng is attributed to the godhead, the other thyng to euery creature. And this argument S. Cyprian dooeth touche in his expoſitiō of the belefe. Dauid .xxxij. pſalme, ſaieth. The heauēs wer made with y• word of god, and with the ſpiryt of his mouth all their powers, and here is alſo opened a teſtimony, that the holy ghoſt is god, as heauen, & all thyng whiche is in heauen was made by hym. Pſalme. Cxxxviii. Whyther ſhall I god

from the ſpirite. And whyther ſhal I flie frō thy face? It is in no creatures power for to be in all places, or to fulfyll all the world: but that pertayneth only to God the creator. Furthermore, that the holie ghoſt is very god, theſe places may ſatiſfy you for this tyme, of the Godhed of y• holy goſt. Now I come to the belief, in y• whiche we ſay. I beleue in the holy goſt with the whiche woordes I ſaye, that I profeſſe to beleue not onely, that the holy ghoſte is god, with true god y• father, and very god the ſonne, and for to come forth of them bothe: but alſo, maketh in me that thyng, that his name doth ſygnifye, truely that he doth ſanctifye me: with what meanes that is done, y• nexte ſentences of the belefe do declare. But truely, to beleue in the holy ghoſte, is to beleue, that our hartes are led by hym, are ſtyrred by him, are moued to beleue the ghoſpell of Ieſu Chriſt, and that by hym we are broughte to the knowledge of the father and Chriſt: and by hym,

Wherefore (welbeloued chyldren) when eyther ye wil heare the word of god, or doo any thing, pray ye to Chriſt, y• he would ſend vnto you y• holy ghoſt, y• whatſoeuer ye ſhal here or do, y• ye may both heare it

So be it.
            
            
               The thirtenth domeſticall ſermon to their chyldren, of Chriſtes Churche.
               
                  IN the laſt ſermon (welbeloued childrē) ye haue herd that to beleue in the holye ghoſt, is nothyng els then to beleue that the holy goſt is very god with verye God the father, and very god the ſonne, and that he doth make us verily holye, euen as his holye name doeth ſignifie: and nowe ye ſhall

heare, how by the holy goſt we ar made holy, and what thynges appertayn vnto him from the firſt beginning of y• world, and what appertaineth to hym euen to the end of the world. This foloweth in the belefe. I beleue the holy churche, the communion of ſamtes. Here ye oughte to bee admony ſhed (wherefore we ſaye here.) I beleue the holy church, and not in the holy churche. Saint Cyprian doth make aunſwere here, for this cauſe it is done, that the creator ought to be ſeparated from the creatures, and holy thinges may be ſeparated from humayne thynges. Furthermore, whē we profeſſe that we do beleue holy churche, we ſhew and ſet forth the holynes of the church, whiche can not be ſet forth before our corporall eyes, for thoſe thynges which we beleue, are not ſeene with our eyes, and ſo is the holyneſſe of the churche hydden, for god hath wrapped his churche with many kyndes of infirmities, with ſinne, with errours, and with a thouſande maner of croſſes he doeth oppreſſe it, that it ſeemeth to be nothyng leſſe then holye. Therfore whoſoeuer doeth not obſerue

and ſaie. I beleue the holy churche. I confeſſe this chyng: I beleue that there is vpon the earthe a companye of holye ſaintes, whiche do beleue in Ieſus chriſt of the whiche company I am one: yea and a membre of the ſame, and profeſſe that I am a partener of all good thynges whiche they do: In the which company I am aſſociate vnto thē by the holy Ghoſte, for that that I haue hard the word of God: and now heare it.

Here I do confeſſe that I doo beleue the holy churche to haue the remiſſion of ſynnes: The remiſſiō of ſynnes is, when our ſinnes are forgeuen vs freely by Chriſt. Whiche forgeuenes is made by the preachyng of the woord of god, and the adminiſtration of the ſacramentes among the church of Chriſt, and geuen to vs by onely Ieſus Chriſt, both through his merites and promiſe.

The ſame words Paul writeth, Colloſſ .i. chap. And Chriſt hym ſelf ſayeth in the laſt chapter of Luke. This ought Chriſt to ſuffer, and ryſe the third day frō death and vnderneath his name, repentance & remiſſion of ſinnes to be preached amōg all nations. And Paul ſaieth, Actes .xiij. chap. Be it knowen to you (O ye men) that by thys, that is Chriſt, remiſſyon of ſynnes is declared vnto vs. But wherefore do I tarry, in bringing forth ſo manye teſtimonyes of Scripture? as who ſhould ſay, that all holye ſcripture were not full of teſtimonies, that by only Ieſu Chriſt, the remiſſion of our ſynnes is graunted and promyſed to vs▪: and it is not only fortified by y• opē places of ſcripture, but alſo cōfirmed by the ſētences of many holy men.

               The fiftenth domeſtical or houſhold ſermon to their chyldren, of the reſurrection of the dead.
               Fewe men, welbeloued children, do willingly dye: and y• cauſe is (as I thinke) partli for that we ar more deſirous by our nature of life thē death, partly for that in fewe of vs there is true faith, that there ſhalbe a reſurrection of y• dead: for if this faithe were ſtrong in vs, truly it could not be, but y• we ſhuld willingly dye: but that this ſentence of y• reſurrection which ſhalbe of the dead, may bee made to you more familyer, and y• it once well vnderſtand, myght make you the willynglyer to departe this preſente lyfe: we ſhall ſpeake a fewe wordes at this preſent time of it. We ſaye therfore in our belief, I beleue the reſurrection o

Wherefore exerciſe your mynde to beleue this, that our body, which now here we ſee, ſhalbe raiſed again, but the condition & qualitie

Cyprian ſaieth) but the ſinners alſo. The iuſte truely, for becauſe they ſhal euer tarry with chriſt, and y• ſinners without any remedy, ſhal euer tarry in euerlaſting payn .i. Corint .xv. chap. For this corruptible body muſt put on incorruption, and this mortall bodye, muſt put on immortalitie. Iob xix. chapter. I know that my redemer liueth, and in the latter daye, I ſhall ryſe from the earth: and againe I ſhalbe couered with my ſkynne, and in my fleſhe I ſhall ſee God, whom euen I my ſelfe ſhall ſee, and myne eyes ſhall loke vpon. Furthermore, of the reſurrection y• ſhall be of the dead, there be many goodly teſtimonies in holy ſcripture. Ezech .xxxv. chap. ſaith. Behold, I ſhal open your ſepulchres, and ſhal bring you out of your ſepulchres. Daniel .xii. cha. And many of thoſe whiche ſlepe, ſhall come out of the duſt of the earth, ſome to euerlaſting life ſome to their rebuke: that they maye alway ſee, Chriſt ſaith. Iohn .i. The houre

ſhall come, in the whiche all that be in y• graues ſhall heare his voyce, and thoſe which haue done good, ſhal go to the reſurrectiō of life, and thoſe that haue done cuyll, to the reſurrection of condēnation. Matt .xxii. Chriſt ſaith alſo, of the reſurrection of the dead, haue ye not red, that it hath bene ſaid vnto you of god, which ſaith? I am the god of Abraham, the god of Iſaac, and the god of Iacob. God is not the god of the dead, but of y• liuyng, And vnto thoſe apply y• ſaiyng of Paul .i. Corint .xv .i. Theſſa .iiii. and Philip .iij. Chapter. In the whiche places there be goodlye teſtimonyes of the reſurrection y• ſhalbe of the dead. But here perchaūce ye would ſaye: and how, and after what ſort, ſhall the reſurrection of the dead be. To theſe words doth Paul make vs anſwere and ſay .i. Corint .xv. chap .i. Theſſ .iiii. chap. We tell you verily this thyng, as the word of the Lorde, that we which liue, and ſhalbe leaſt to the commyng of the lord, ſhall not preuente and come before thoſe whiche doo ſlepe: For y• ſame lord with a commaundemēt & the voyce of the Archaungell, and the trumpette of

Furthermore, he declareth what we ſhall doo, after that we are relieued, we ſhall come out of y• earth to immortalitie & euerlaſting life: or we being yet aliue ſhalbe changed to immortalitie: with y• which thoughtes if our hert ſhal ſōtimes be occupied, we ſhal eaſily etolerate & beare this death, whiche maie be a meane vnto vs to an immortalitie & euerlaſtyng lyfe. The cauſe y• we do ryſe chriſt through his holy reſurrectiō hath beſerued for us, y• no man ſhould think y• it cōmeth of his own workes. Of y• whiche Paul doth ſpeake .i. Cor .xv.

In this place where he maketh mention of the laſt reſurrection of the dead, then ſhalbe a Saboth day, of a ſaboth day: and a moneth of a moneth &c: That is to ſay / then ſhal it perpetually be holy day, and ſaynctes ſhal perpetually worſhip the lord, that is they ſhall knowe the Lord, and ſhal lyue without any ſpot of ſynne, and ſhall dye no more.

It is called the ſacrament of thākes geuyng, becauſe it is inſtituted by this name, to be a ſacramēt, as Chriſo▪ ſaith. Let vs geue thankes vnto Chriſte, for his ineffable benefites whiche he hath beſtowed vpon vs, by his mooſt bitter paſſyon: It is called a communion, for that the ſupper of the Lorde, was woonte

                  o bee ſolemnyſed, in and amonge the congregation of Chryſten people, they beeyng once gathered together.
               Therefore, learne what is the ſupper of the lord, and then wherfore it was inſtituted

of Chriſt, and what profites we do receiue by it: and laſt, who oughte to bee admitted vnto this ſupper. The ſupper of the lord is, when Chriſt ſaid vnto his diſciples, take and eate, this is my bodie, whiche is geuen for you, this is my blud whiche is ſhed for you in the remyſſion of ſinnes. To the whiche wordes Chriſt addeth breade and wine, with the which the faithful receyue his very bodye, and his very bloud ſpiritually: which .ii. ſygnes, be as ſeales, that the words of chriſt be agreable vnto the trewth. Wherfore was this ſacramente inſtituted? for two cauſes (welbeloued chyldren) firſte that we ſhould not doubte that there is geuē to vs truely, whiche the goſpel doth promiſe vs, that is the remiſſion of ſynnes, and lyfe enerlaſtynge, for Ieſu Chryſtes ſake, then, that we ſhoulde declare our fayth before the world, for before god it is ſufficient for vs to beleue the ghoſpel▪ but for becauſe God ſuffereth vs here to lyue for this cauſe, that we ſhould be profitable to all men, and the faythe that is hydden in our hartes, we ſhoulde ſhewe outwardly before men: He hath inſtituted

to vs baptiſine, and the ſupper of the lord, by the whiche figurs▪ y• world doth know that we are Chriſtians. But here ye myght ſay perchaunce. Is not Baptiſme ſufficient for vs? Wherfore ſhould we receyue the ſupper of the lord▪ ſeyng that we myght by baptiſme be admoniſhed of the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and the lyfe euerlaſtyng by Chriſt, and thus declare our profeſſion. But here ye, welbeloued chyldren, by baptiſme truely we are reuiued, and regenerated firſte, as ye haue heard in the ſermon before. Sence we can not here put of the olde ſkynne, and for the moaſt part are throwen into dyuerſe ſtormes of temptations, Chriſte hath left here vnto vs in ſpirite and faith to receiue his body and his bloud, with the whiche we maye make ſtrong oure faith againſt ſo many aſſaultes of temptations, and ſo by thē to be ſtrengthened more and more. I thinke ye loke for now that I ſhould ſhewe to you, what commodities or frutes we do receiue by y• ſacrament of the body and blude of Chriſt, and for becauſe I will be ſhorte, this ſacrament ledeth vs to two commodities,
