            To The Reader.
            
               GRace and peace / &c. Good Christian Reader her are sett forthe for thine instruction / and comforte / certen learned / and comfortable conferences / Betwene the two Reuerende / and godly fathers M. Rydley / and M. Latymer: whose bodies the Romishe tyrannie of late hathe tormented / and fier hathe consumed: whose sowles mercie hathe embraced / and heauen hathe receiued / yelding thone vnto the enemie to deathe / for testimonie of the truthe / commending thother vnto god in suer hope of lyfe. Wher vnto is also added a learned treatise / and a cleare confutation of the fonde / and wicked opinion of Transubstantiation written by the said M. Ridley. And forasmuche as these their scrolles / and writynges wer by goddes good prouidence preserued / and as it wer raked owte of the asshes of thauthors: cōteinīge as well cōfortable cōsolatiō for suche as are in the schole of the crosse / as also goode / ād profitable admonitiō for them which eyther of ignorāce / either of infirmitie / or by flattering of them selfes with vayne pretenses / do yelde vnto the wicked worlde: the reuerence due to the reuerende fathers / the zeale towardes the setting forthe of the tried truthe / and the readye goode will to conforte / and confirme weake consciences / would not suffer the any lenger to wante these smalle treatises / and yett no

smalle treasures. That as in life thei profited the by teaching / and in deathe by example / so after death they may doe the goode by writing. And albeit the matter of it selfe is sufficiente to commend it selfe / yet it cannot be but the worthines of the writers / will encrease creditte / and giue no small authoritie to the writynges. M. Latymer came earlier in the morning / and was the more auncient workeman in the lordes vineyarde / 
                  Matt. 20. who also may verie well be called (as diuerse learned men haue termed hym) the Apostle of Englād: as one much more worthie of that name / for his true doctrine / for his sharpe reprouinge of sinne / and superstition / then was Augustine bisshop of Canturburie for bringing in the popes monkerie / and false religion. M. Ridley came later aboute theleuenth howre / but no doubte he came when he was effectuallye called / and frō the time of his calling / became a faithfull / labourer terrible to the enemies for his excellent learning / and therfore a meete man to ridde owte of the lordes vineyarde the sophisticall thornes of the wrangling aduersaries / which dyd well appeare in all disputations / and conferences that wer in his tyme / and partlye doth appeare in these shorte treatises folowing. But what shal it nede in manye wordes to prayse them / whose lyfes wer moste commendable / whose deathes wer most glorious? in office and vocation bothe lyke / in labour and trauail bothe faithfull / in learning and iudgemēt both sounde: in minde and maners

bothe milde / but in goddes cause bothe stoute. For neither threatned deathe / neither loue of present lyfe / could shake the foundation of theyr faithe / firmely grounded apon the suer rocke Christe.
                  Matt. 7. They redemed libertie of conscience / with the bondage of the bodie / and to saue their lyfes / they wer content to lose their lyfes. This was not the worke of the fleshe / but the operation of goddes mightie spirite: who hathe euer frome the beginning not onlye builded / but also enlarged his churche by the sufferance of his sainctes / and sealed his doctrine with the bloude of his martyrs: as S. Augustine speaking of the persecutions in the primatiue church doth well declare in theis wordes.
            Ligabantur, includebantur, caedebantur,De ciuita. Dei lib. 22 cap. 6. torque bantur, urebantur, & multiplicabantur.
            That is to saye. The Christians wer bounde / wer emprisoned / wer beaten / wer tormented / wer brente / and yet wer multiplyed.
            Yf Iustinus Martyr when he was yet an heathen Philosopher (as he confesseth of hym selfe) was moued to embrace the fayth and religion of Christe / 
                  Apolog. 1 in beholding the constante patience of the martyrs which suffred for Christe in his tyme: how muche more oughte the patiente suffringe / and voluntarie death of these notable fathers / with many other learned / godlye men / in our dayes / whose names are writtē in the booke of lyfe / not only moue / but also pearce / ād perswade all godly heartes constantely to remayne in the truthe knowen? For

vndoubtedly the truthe of the cawse they suffred for / is moste euidente by goddes worde / and hath ben so fully taughte / so clearly sette forthe by many and sundrye writynges / that it is open to the Consciences of all the worlde / euen of the verie aduersaries themselfes that persequute it (greater is theyr damnation) excepte it be to such / whome the godde of thys worlde / 2. Cor. 4. malice / ambition / auarice / or ignorance hath blynded. Which thynge nedeth none other proofe (especially for the realme of englande) but only to call to mynde with what conscience and constancie / these pyllers of the church that can nott erre / haue walked in Religion these twentye yeares by paste / how they not longe agoo receiued and allowed thynges / which with fyre / and fagotte / they persequute now / and shranke frome that thē / which now they moste earnestly mainteyne. And allthoughe ther appeared in the latter dayes a shadow of stowtenesse in a few / yet it was in dede nothynge. For it sprange not owte of any zeale to the cawse / or clearenesse of conscience / but rather owte of a lyke subtylle / and foxye presumption / as the Syrians once conceiued / when they putte themselfes in the daunger of Kinge Achab sayeng.3. Reg. 20. Beholde we haue hearde that the kinges of the howse of Israel are pitefull / and mercyfull. For owte of all dowte K. Henry theyghte coulde as easely haue obteined at winchesters handes / and others a conformytee in puttyng downe the Masse / and all the reaste / what so euer hath

ben done (by order) sence / if he hadde earnestly minded it / as the abolisshinge of the pope / monkerye / pylgremages / reliques / with lyke baggage: all which are now agayne / thinges well estemed / and couered (as all the resydew is) with the clooke of the Catholike church. But to returne to the matter we haue in hāde / in this littel treatise (goode read) thow shalte perceiue another māer of spirite thow shalte thīke (if thow thi selfe be not verie dulle) that thow hearest men speake which hadde learned the lessō of thapostles / that is / 
                  Acto. 4. to obei godde rather thē mā: ād hadde not learned the Romisshe Epicures lesson / to applye fayth / and religiō to the presente state of policie / to turne with the tyme / and serue all seasons: men before death / deade vnto the worlde / accowmptynge with S. Paule / all other thynges to be dāmage / losse / and vile /

O Englande / Englande / how greate is thy losse for the wante of them? how horrible is thyne offense for killinge of them? how greuouse will thy plage be / when the reuenger of innocente bloude

Godde graunte that the admonitions of these and other godly martyrs maye so warne vs / theyr doctrine so instructe vs / and theyr example so cōfirme vs in the true knowlege and feare of godde / that flyenge and abhorringe Idolatrye / and superstition / we maye embrace true religion and pierce / forsakinge the phantasyes of men / we maye humblye obey the written worde of godde / and ruled therby / directe all our doyngs to the glorie of his name / and our owne endeles saluation in Christe Iesu / Amen.

               It ys done in a strawnge tounge which the people doth not vnderstande / contrarie to the doctrine off the Apostle / 1. Cor. 14.1. Cor. 14.

Cor. 11. ye shall shew the Lordes deathe / till he come. What shewinge can be ther / wher as no man heareth / that it to saye vnderstādeth what is sayde: No man (I meane) off the commen people / for whose proffet the prayer of the churche oughte specially to serue.
               
                  
                     H. L. Luc. 11.Woo be vnto you that take awaye the keye off knowlege. The Papistes studie by all meanes to make the people ignorante / Lest theyr ignorante sir Ihons shuld be hadde in Lesse estimation / or despised: which is cleane contrarie to Saint Paules practise / who wisshed that all men myghte be fulfilled with all knowledge / and to be perfite in Christe Iesus / 
                     Coloss. 1. &c. The institution of Christe / if it wer rehersed in the vulgare tounge / shulde be / not only a Consecration / but also a frutefull preachinge / to the edification off the hearers / wher as in the popisshe Masse it is neyther vnderstanded / nor hearde: whils the commen people are vtterly ignorāte / what their preestes doo / or what

they goo abowte / whether they blesse / or curse. The Apostles vnderstoode Christe / when he celebrated his supper / Therfore doo these papistes swarue frome Christe in theyr Masse.
               Ther is no Communion / but it is made a priuate Table / and in dede owght to be a Communion.
                     N. R
                   For S. Paule sayeth. The breade which we breake / 1. Cor. 10. is the partakynge of the bodie of Christe. And Christe brake / and distributed / and sayde. Take / 
                     Matt. 26. and eate / &c. But that they make it a priuate table / it is open.
                     The papistes make the lordes table, a priuate table
                   For wher they be manie preestes which will communicate / they doo it not in one Table / or aulter / but euerie one off them haue their aultars / masses / and tables.
               To make that priuate which Christe made commen / and willed to be communicated / 
                     H.L.
                   maye seme to be the workmanshippe of Antichriste hym selfe. The Canons of thapostles doo excommunicate them / which beinge presente at commē prayer / &c.
                     Cano. 10. doo not also receiue the holy communion.
                     De Cons. dist. 1. cap. Epis.
                   And vnto the same agreeth the decree of Anacletus. When the consecration is done (saieth) he let all such communicate / as entend not to be excommunicate.
               That which is firste / is trew / that which is Latter / is cownterfayted / sayeth Tertulliane. But the papistes saye we doo it priuately Bicawse we doo it for others.

                  The lordes commaundement of communicating the cuppe vnto the laye people is not obserued according vnto the worde of the lorde: drincke ye all of this.
                     Matt. 26.

                     H.L. 1 Cor. 11. ye shal shew the lordes deathe &c. so that not the partaking of the one onlye / but of bothe is a shewing of the lordes deathe bicause in his deathe the bloude was deuided from the bodie / it is necessarie that the same diuision be represented in the supper / 
                     
                        The lordes death is not shevued, excepte both partes of the Sacrā. be ministred.
                     
                     
                        Thargument of K. Henry the 8. 2. Cor. 11.
                   otherwyse the supper is not a sheuing of the lordes deathe / &c. Let a man examine hym selfe / &c. But this worde (Homo) is of bothe gendres / therfore it is as wel commaunded to the woman to drincke of the cuppe / as the man / &c. But the Kings argumente once againste me was this. Whē ye come to gither to eate. He saieth not / (saiethe he) to drincke / I aunswerid it was not neadfulle seing that a litle before he had made mention of bothe / in theise wordes. And so let hym eat of that breade / and drincke of that cuppe. Homo / that is to saye aswel the woman as the manne. Vnder the name of bread which betokenethe all sustinaunce of the bodie / drincke is also vnderstanded in the scriptures. Otherwise they woulde saye that Christe did not drincke after hys resurrection withe his disciples excepte Peter had saide:
                     Acto. 10. We

did eate and drincke with him after he arose from deathe.
               They doo seruyllye serue the holye sygne (as S. Augustine speaketh) in steade of the thinge signiffied / whiles the sacramentall breade by a solenne or commen errour is adored / and worshipped / for the flessh taken of the sonne of godde.

Furthermore / in the first supper celebrated off Christe himselfe / ther is no mention made off adoration off thelemētes / who sayd / Eate ye / and drincke ye / not worshippe ye. Therfore againste Adoration maye be spoken that saynge off Christe concerninge diuorse.

               What meaneth this prayer for the sacramente it selfe / if it be / as they saye / the body off Christe / 
                     Vuordes ovute off the Canō off the Masse.
                   if it be godde and man? How shuld the father not looke with a chearefull countenance apon his onely welbeloued sonne? Why doo we not rather praye for owre selfes / that we / for hys sake / maye be looked apon off the father / with a chearefull countenance?
               To thys let them answer / that so praye:

                   Excepte

parauenture thys prayer was vsed longe before it was estemed to be the body of Christe / really / and corporally: and then thys prayer maketh well to destroye the popissh opinion / that it is not the opinion off the church / nor so awncyēt / as they bable. Ther be other prayers off the masse / which parauenture be off lyke effect / but I haue forgotten all Massing matters / and the Masse it selfe I vtterly deteste / and abhorre / and so I confessed openly / before our Diotrephes / and other.

                  Commawnde these to be caried by the handes of thy holye Awngell vnto thy hyghe Aultar / &c. If we vnderstande the body and bloud of Christe / wherfore doo we so soone desyre the departure off them / before the receipte off the same? and wherfore broughte we them theder by makyng of them / to let them goo so soone?
               Write agayne I besech you / fathers / and brethern / moste dearely beloued in Christe / spare not my paper: For I looke er it be longe / that owr commen enemye will fyrst assaulte me / and I wissh frome the botome off my harte / to be holpen / not onely by your prayers / but also by your holsome cownsayles.

               Ihon Bapt: saieth / 
                     Ioan. 3. A man can receiue nothing excepte it be geuen him frome heauē / and S. Paule. No man taketh honour vnto hymselfe / butt he that is called of godde / as was Aaron / &c.
                     Hebr. 5. But to offer Christe is a greate and weyghtie matter / ther fore oughte no man to take it apon hym withowte a manifest callinge / and commission. Butt wher haue our sacrificers so greate an office committed vnto them? Let them shew theyr commission / and then sacrifice. Parauenture they will saye (Doo thys) is all one to saye / as (offer this) Then I aske what was ther doone? what was demonstrated by thys pronowne (This) or what dyd they see done / to whome these wordes (Doo this) wer spokē? yf the hole action off Christe / if all that Christe dyd / be mente by thys worde (This) and (Doo) is nothing els but (offer) then the hoole action off Christe is to be offred off the priestes: neyther can they / but in so doynge satisfie the cōmawndemēt: And so it shuld appeare / that neither was ther anye sacrament instituted for the laye people / seyng that no such sacrifice / hath ben done at anie tyme / or is to be done / of the laye people: neyther doth it auayle much to eate or drinke it / butt onlye to offer it. Now the texte hath not that any parte of Christes

action was to offer / forasmoch as the texte doth not declare that Christe himself did then offer. And so the action off offering is not conteyned in thys pronowne (Thys) Goo thoroughe euerie worde. Firste / to take / is not to offer / to breake / is not to offer / to geue to the disciples / is not to offer / &c. Worcester sayd ones to me / that to offer / was conteyned in (benedicere) which is not true / for (benedicere) is to gyue thankes. But he hadde often geuen thankes to godde before / withowte any such offering. And if in giuynge of thankes Christe offered his bodie / seinge after he hadde geuen thankes / he sayed (this is my bodie) then in speaking those wordes / he dyd not chawnge the breade into his bodie / for as moche as he hadde offered / before those wordes wer spoken.
                     Hebr. 2. S. Paule hath these wordes to the Hebr. speakinge off Christe. That he myght be mercifull and a faythfull highe prieste in thynges concernyng godde / for to pourge the peoples synnes. So that it maye appeare that the pourgyng of owr synnes doth rather hange heroff that Christe was the highe prieste offering / then that he was offered / sauinge in that he was off himselfe willingly offered. Then is it not necessarie / he shuld be offred off others: I will not saye a meruelouse presumpteouse acte / that the same shuld be attempted off anie / withowte a manifeste vocation for it is no small matter to make an oblation: And yet I speake nothinge that it tēdeth partely to the derogation off Christes crosse / besydes

also that the offerer / owghte to be off more excellencye then the thynge offered.
               The minister of the gospell hath rather to doe for Christe withe the people / thē for the people withe god / excepte it be in praynge / and giuinge of thā
                  kes / and so hathe the people aswell to doe with god for the minister / the office of reconciliation stādithe in preachīge / not in offeringe. We are messangers in the rowme off Christe (Sayeth S. Paule) he doth not saye / 2. Cor. 5. we offer vnto godde for the the people.
               Yf Christe offered in his supper: for whom I praye yow? For all: Then his latter oblation made on the crosse / cā not be thought to be done for all mē / . for it was not done for them / for whom the oblation was made in the supper / excepte perauenture he offerid twise for the selfe same. And that shulde argue the vnperfectues of the sacrifice.
               Feede ye asmuche as in you liethe the flocke of Christe / 1. Petr. 5. naye sacrifice raither for the flocke of Christe / if the matter be as it is pretended / and it is mervelle that Peter did forget so highe an office seinge in thes daies sacrificinge is somuche estemed / preachinge almoste nothinge at all. Who arte thou if thow ceaseste to feede? a goode catholike. But who arte thou / if thou ceaseste to sacrifice and saye masse? at the leaste an heretike. From whēce come theis peruerse iudgementes? excepte parauenture they

thincke that in sacrificinge they fede / and thē what neadethe a lerned pastoure? seinge no manne is so folishe but he canne sone learne to sacrifice / and saye Masse.
               Paule wrote two Epistles to Timothie / one to Titus / two cleargie mē / he made also a longe sermon ad clerum / Act. 20. but not one worde of this masse sacrifice / 
                     Acto. 20. which coulde not haue ben done / if ther hadde ben suche a one and so highlie to be esteamed.
               I haue redde ouer of late the newe testamente thre or foure tymes deliberatly / yet can not I fynd ther / 
                     The synevues of the masse can not be foū
                        de in the nevue test.
                   nether the popish consecration / nor yet their transubstantyacion / nor their oblation / nor their Adoration / whiche be the verie synewes / and mary bones of the Masse. Chryste could not be offered but propitiatorely / yet nowe (hoc facite) doo this: muste be as muche to say / as sacrifice / and offer my bodye vnder a piece of bread / auaylable / but we can not telle how muche. Ah theafes. Haue ye robbed the realme with your sacrifice of landes / and goodes / and nowe can not tell how muche your sacrifice is auailable? as who saye it is so much auailable that the valeu cā not be expressed / nor to deare boughte with bothe landes and goodes.
                     Esa. 64. The eye hath not sene / and the eare hathe not hearde / &c. This is a fine spunne threade / a conninge pece of worcke worthelie qualified / ād blaūched

be ye sure. But oure nobilitie will not see / they will not haue that religion that hathe the crosse annexed to it.
               Al popishe thinges for the moste parte are mannes inuentions where as they oughte to haue the holie scripture for the onlie rule of faithe. When Paule made allegation for him selfe before Felix the highe deputie / he did not extende his faithe beyonde the worde of god writtē beleuing all things (saieth he) which are written in the lawe / 
                     Acto. 24. and the prophetes / making no mention of the Rabbins. Moreouer they haue Moses and the prophetes (saieth Abrahā in the parable) not their persones / 
                     Luc. 16. but their writinges. Also faith cometh by hearinge / and hearinge / by the worde of god.
                     Rom. 10. Luc. 11. Hieron. in. 23. Matth. Aug. cōt. lit. Petil. l. 3. c. 6. And agayne: blessed are they which heare the worde of god / &c. The thinges which haue not theyr authorite oute of the scriptures / maye as easely be despised / as allowed / sayeth S. Hierome. Therfore whether it be of Christe / or of his church / or of any other maner of thinge which belongeth to oure faythe / and liffe / I will not saye / Yf we (sayeth S. Augustine) which are not worthy to be compared to him that sayed: Yff we / 
                     Gala. 1. butt that also which forthwith he addeth / Yf an Aungell frome heauen shall teache any thynge besides that ye haue receiued in the scriptures of the lawe and gospell / accursed be he.
                     Diotreph▪ is described Ioan. ep. 3. Our Diotrephes / with hys papistes are vnder this Curse. But how are the scriptures (saye they)

to be vnderstanded?
                     De doctr. Christ.
                   S. Augustine answereth giuynge this rule. The Circunstances of the scriptures (sayeth he) lyghten the scriptures / and so on scripture doth expownde another / 
                     Li. 3. c. 28. to a man that is studiouse / well willinge and often callynge apon godde in contynualle prayer / who geueth his holye spirite to them that desyre it of him.
                     Luc. 11. 2. Pet. 1. So that the scripture is not of anie priuate interpretation at anie tyme. For such a one thoughe he be a laye man / fearinge godde / is moche more fytte to vnderstande holye scriptures / then any arrogante and prowde prieste / yea / then the bysshop hymselfe / be he neuer so greate / and glystering in all his Pontificalles. But what is to be sayed of the Fathers? How are they to be estemed? S. Augustine answereth giuyng thys rule also / that we shulde not therfore thinke it true bicawse they saye so / doo they neuer so moche excelle in holynes / or learnynge: but if they be able to prooue theyr sayeng by the canonicall scriptures or by goode probable reason:
                     Ep. 19. ad Hieron.
                   meanynge that to be a probable reason (as I thinke) Which doth orderly folow apon a righte collection and gatheringe oute of the scriptures.
               Lett the Papistes goo with theyr longe fayth / be you contented with the shorte fayth of the sayntes / which is reueled vnto vs in the worde of god written. Adew to all popissh phantasies / Amen. For one man / hauing the scripture and goode reason for hym / is more to be estemed himself alone / 

then a thowsand such as they eyther gathered together / or succeding one another.
                     Panorm. C. significasti extra de appellat.
                  
               
               The fathers haue both herbes and weedes / and papistes commenly gather the weedes / and leaue the herbes. And they speake many tymes more vehemently in sounde of wordes / then they dyd meane in dede / or then they wolde haue done / if they hadde forseene what sophisticall wrāglers should haue succeded them. Now the papistes are geuen to brawle aboute wordes / to the mayntenance off theyr owne inuentions / and rather folow the sounde of wordes then▪ atteyne vnto the meanynge of the fathers / so that is daungerouse to truste them in citynge the fathers.
               In all aeges the deuel hath styrred vp some lyghte heades to esteme the sacramentes butt lyghtly / as to be emptie and bare signes / whome the fathers haue resisted so fearsely / that in theyr feruour they seme in sownde off wordes to runne to farre the other waye / and to geue to moche to the sacramentes / when they dyd thynke more mesurably. And therfore they are to be redde warely / with sownde iudgement. But our papistes / and they seme but a litle soundinge to their purpose / they will owte face / brace / and bragge all mē / it must nedes be as they will haue it. Therfore ther is no remedie / namely now when they haue the mayster bowle in theyr hande / and rule the roste / but patience.

Better it is to suffer what crueltye they will putte vnto vs / then to incurre goddes hyghe indignation.
               Wherfore goode my Lorde be of goode cheare in the Lorde: with dew cōsideration what he reqwireth of you / and what he doth promesse you. Our commē enemye shall doo no more then godde will permitte hym.1. Cor. 10. Godde is faythfull which will not suffer vs to be tempted aboue our strength / &c. Be at a poynte what ye will stande vnto / sticke vnto that / and lett them both saye and doo what they liste. They can butt kylle the bodie / which otherwise is off it self mortall. Neyther yet shall they doo that whan they liste / but when godde will suffre them / when the howre apoynted is comme. To vse many wordes with them / it shall be but in vayne / now that they haue a bloudye and deadely lawe prepared for them. But it is verie requisite that ye geue a reasonable accowmpte off your fayth / if they wille qwietly heare you Elles ye know in a wicked place off Iudgement a man may kepe silence / 1. Pet. 3. after the example off Christe. Lett them not deceiue you with theyr Sophisticall Sophismes / 
                     Luc. 23. and fallacies: you knowe that many false thynges / haue more apparence of truthe / then thynges that be moste true: therfore Paule geueth vs a watche worde.
                     Coloss. 2. 2. Tim. 2. Let no man deceiue you with lyklynesse of speache. Neither is it requisite that with the contentiouse / ye shuld folow strife of wordes / which

tende to no edification / butt to the subuersion of the hearers / and the vayne bragginge and ostentation of the aduersaries.
               Feare off death doth moste perswade a greate number. Be well ware of that argument / for that perswaded Shaxton (as many men thoughte) after that he hadde ones made a goode profession / openly before the iudgement seate. The flessh is weake / but the willingnesse off the spirite / shall refressh the weakenes off the flessh.
               The number off the cryars vnder the aultare must nedes be fulfilled:
                     Apoc. 6. if we be segregated therunto / happie be we. That is the greatest promotion / that godde geueth in this worlde / 
                     Phil. 1. to be such Philippians to whome it is geuen / nott only to beleue / butt also to suffer / &c.
               But who is hable to doo these thinges? Surely all our habilitee / all our sufficience is off godde. He requireth / and promyseth. Let vs declare our obedience to hys wille / whan it shalbe requisite / in the tyme of troble / yea in the myddes of the fyre.
               Whan that numbre is fulfylled / which I wene shall be shortely / then haue at the papistes / when they shall saye Peace / 1. Thess. 5. all thynges are

safe / when Christe shall comme to kepe his greate Parlamente / to the redresse off all thynges that be amysse. But he shall not comme as the papistes fayne hym / to hyde himself / and to playe bopiepe as it wer / vnder a piece off breade: but he shall comme gloriously / to the terrour and feare off all papistes / but to the greate consolation and comforte of all that will her suffer for hym.1. Thess. 4. Conforte your selfes one another with these wordes.
               Lo syr / her haue I blotted your paper vaynely / and played the foole egregiously / but so I thoughte better then not to doo your reqweste at thys tyme. Pardon me / and praye for me: praye for me I saye / praye for me I saye. For I am sometime so fearefull / that I wold creape into a mowschoole / sometyme godde doth visitte me agayne with his comforte. So he commeth and goeth / to teach me to fele and to knowe myne infirmitee / to thintente to geue thankes to hym that is worthye / least I shuld robbe hym of his dutye / as manye doo / and almoste all the worlde. Fare you well.
               What credence is to be geuen to papistes it maye appeare by theyr rackynge / wrythinge / wrynginge / and monstrously iniuryeng of goddes holy scripture / as appeareth in the popes lawe. But I dwell her now in a scoole of obliuiousnesse. Fare you well ones agayne. And be you stedfaste / and vnmoueable in the Lorde.1▪

Be faythfull vnto the death / and I will geue the a Crowne of lyfe / sayeth the Lorde.
            
            
               To H. Latymer.
               IN writyng agayne ye haue done me an vnspeakeable pleasure and I praye that the Lorde maye reqwyte it you in that daye.
                     N. Rydl.
                   For I haue receyued greate comforte at your wordes / butt yett I am nott so fylled withall / but that I thurste moche more now thē afore / to drinke more of that Cuppe of yours / wherin ye mingle vnto me profytable with pleasaunte. I praye you goode father let me haue one draughte more to comforte my stomacke. For surely except the Lorde assiste me with his graciouse ayde in the tyme of his seruice / I knowe I shall playe but the parte of a white lyuered knight. But truly my truste is in hym / that in myne infirmitee he shall trye hymself strōge / and that he can make the cowarde in his cawse to fighte lyke a mā. Syr now I looke dayely when Diotrephes with

his warriours shall assaulte me wherfore I praye you goode father / for that you are an olde sowldyar / and an experte warriour / and godde knoweth I am but a yonge sowldyar / and as yet of smalle experience in these fyttes / helpe me I praye you to buckle on my harnesse. And now I wolde haue you to thynke / that these dartes are caste at my heade off some one of Diotrephes or Antonius sowldyars.

                        N. Ryd. Luc. 9. is fytte for the Kyngdome off godde. And also for the selfe same cawse / why S. Paule wolde not suffer Titus to be circū

is contrarie to sownde doctrine: and so shulde be a stumblynge stocke vnto the weake. But woo be vnto hym by whome offense commeth / it wer better for hym that a Milnestone wer hanged abowte his necke / and he caste into the myddes of the sea.

But if ye be desyrouse to know / 1.

And they be these. The straunge tounge: The wante off the shewynge off the Lordes death: The breakynge of the Lordes commawndement of hauyng a communion: The sacrament is not communicated to all / 
                        Matt. 26. vnder bothe kyndes / accordynge to the worde off the Lorde: The signe is seruyllie worshipped / for the thinge signiffyed. Christes Passion is iniuryed / forasmoch as this Masse sacrifice is affirmed to remaine for the purginge off sin̄es: To be shorte / The manyfolde superstitions / and triflynge fondenes whych are in the Masse / and abowte the same.

For so one shall alleuiate the tediousnesse off the other.

                     They will saye / as their fathers saied / 
                        Ioan. 19. Whē they haue no more to saie. We haue a lawe / ād by our lawe he owght to dye / Be ye stedfast ād vnmouable saieth saincte Paule / ād agayne / persistito / stande fast.1. Cor. 15. 2. Tim. 3. Ioan. 15. Col. 1. And how ofte is this repeted / if ye abide / yf ye abide &c. But we shall be called obstinate / sturdie / ignoraūte / headye / and what not? So that a man hath nede of muche patience hauing to do with suche men.
                  But yow knowe how great a crime it is to separate your selfe from the communion or feloushippe of the churche / and to make a schisme / or diuision.
                        Anton. obiect. 3. You haue ben reported to haue hated the secte of the Anabaptistes / and alwaies to haue impugned the same. More ouer this was the perniciouse erroure of Nouatus / and of the heretikes called (Cathari) that they woulde not communicate with the churche.
                  I knowe that the vnitye of the churche is to be retained by al meanes / and the same to be necessarye to saluation.
                        N. Ryd. Ansvu.
                      But I do not take the masse as it is at this daye / for the communion of the churche / but for a popisshe deuyse / wherby bothe the commaundemente and institution of oure sauior Christe for the ofte frequēting of the remēbrance of his deathe / is eluded / and the people of god is miserablye deluded. The secte of the Anabaptistes / and the heresie of the Nouatians / oughte of righte to be

condemned / for as muche as with oute anye iuste or necessarie cause / they wickedlye separated them selfes from the communion of the congregation / for they did not alledge that the sacramentes were vnduelye ministred / but turninge awaie their eies from them selfes / wher with accordinge to saincte Paules reule they oughte to examine them selfes / 1. Cor. 11. and castinge theyr eyes euer vpon others / either ministers / or communicātes with them / they alwaies reproued some thinge / for the which they absteined from the communion / as from an vnholie thinge.

But for asmuch as thinges done in the masse tende openlye to the ouerthrowe of Christes institution / I iudge that by no meanes either in worde / or dede I oughte to consente vnto it. As for that whiche is obiected oute of the fathers / I acknowledge it to be wel spokē / if it be well vnderstanded. But it is mente of them whiche suppose they are defiled yf anie secret vice be either in the ministers / or in them that communicate with them. And is not mente of them whiche doo abhorre superstition / and wicked traditiōs of men / and will not suffer the same to be thruste up on them selfes / or vpon the churche / in steade of goddes worde / and the trewethe of the gospel.

detestable / and therfore by no meanes to be borne withal / so that of necessitye the mendinge of it / is to abolisshe it for euer. For yf yow take awaie oblation / and adoration / which do hange vpon consecratiō and transubstantiacion / the most papistes of them all will not sett a button by the masse / as a thinge which they esteame not / but for the gaine that foloweth theron. For yf the Englyshe communion whiche of late was vsed / wer as gainefull to them / as the masse hathe ben heretofore / they woulde striue no more for their masse: From thens groweth the griefe.

Thys Church I doo reuerence / and honour in the Lorde. But the rewle off this church is the worde off godde / accordyng to which rewle / we goo forward vnto lyffe. And as many as walke accordyng to thys rewle / I saye with S. Paule / peace be apon them / 
                        Gala. 6. and apon Israel which perteyneth vnto godde. The guyde off this Churche is the holie ghooste. The markes / wherby this Churche is knowen vnto me in this darke worlde / 
                        Phil. 2. and in the myddes of this Crooked and frowarde generatiō / are these. The syncere preachinge of goddes worde. The due administration off the sacramentes. Charitee / and faythfull obseruynge off Ecclesiasticall discipline accordyng to the worde off godde. And that Church or congregation which is garnisshed with these markes / is in verie dede that heauenly Hierusalem / which consisteth of those /

Forthe off thys (I graunte) ther is no saluation / and I suppose the residew of the places obiected are rightly to be vnderstanded of thys churche only.
                        In op. im. Homi. 49. in Matth.
                      In tymes paste (sayeth Chrysostome) ther wer many waies to knowe the Churche of Christe / that is to saye / by goode lyffe / by miracles / by chastitee / by doctrine / by mynistringe the sacramētes. But frome that tyme / that heresies dyd take holde off the churches it is onlye knowen by the scriptures which is the true church. They haue all thinges in owtwarde shewe / which

the true church hath in truthe. They haue temples lyke vnto ours / &c.
                  And in thende concludeth. Wherfore only by the scriptures doo we knowe which is the true churche. To that which they saye / the Masse is the Sacramente of vnitie. I answer / The breade which we breake / accordinge to the institution of the Lorde / 1. Cor. 10. is the sacramente off thunitee of Christes Mysticall bodye. For we beynge manye / are one breade / and one bodye / forasmuch as we all are partakers of one breade. But in the Masse / the Lordes institution is not obserued / for we be not all partakers of one breade / but one deuoureth all / &c. So that (as is it is vsed) it maye seme a sacramente off singularitee / and off a certen speciall priuelege for one secte off people / wherby they maye be discerned frome the reaste / rather then a sacrament off vnitee / wherin our knyttinge together in one / is represented.
                  Yea / Whatt felowshyp hath Christe with Antichriste?
                        H. Laty.
                      Therfore is it not lawfull to beare the yoke with papistes. Cōme forthe frome amōge thē / and separate your selfes frome them / sayeth the Lorde. It is one thinge to be the churche in dede / another thinge to countrefayte the churche.2. Cor. 6. Wolde godde it wer well knowen / what is the forsakynge of the churche. In the kynges dayes that deade is / who was the churche of Englande? The kinge and hys

fautors / or Massemongers in corners? Yf the kynge and the fautors of his procedinges / why be not we now the churche abidinge in the same procedinges? Yf clancularie Massemongers myght be of the churche / and yett contrarie the kinges procedinges / why maye not we aswell be off the churche contrarienge the qwenes procedynges? Not all that be couered with the title off the church / are the churche in dede. Separate thy selfe frome thē that are suche saieth S. Paule: frome whom?1. Tim. 6. The texte hath before. Yff anie mā folowe other doctrine / &c. he is pufte vp / and knoweth nothinge / &c. Weighe the hole Texte / that ye maye perceaue what is the fruyte of contentiouse disputations. But wherfore are such men sayd to knowe nothynge / when they knowe so many thynges? You knowe the olde verses.
                  
                     Hoc est nescire, sine Christo plurima scire.
                     Si Christum bene scis, satis est, si caetera nescis.
                  
                  That is / This is to be ignorante / to knowe manie thīges withoute Christe. Yf thow knowest Christe well / thow knowest inough / though thow knowe no more. Therfore would S. Paul know nothing / 1. Cor. 2. but Iesus Christe crucified. et c. As manie as are papistes / and massemongers / they maie well be saide to knowe nothing / for they know not Christe / forasmoche as in theyr massinge they take much awaie from the benifite and merite of Christe.

                  That church which you haue described vnto me / is īuisible / but christes church is visible & knowē.

For els why would Christ haue saide / dic Ecclesie / Tel it vnto the church?
                        Matt. 18. For he hadde commaunded in vaine to goo vnto the churche / yf a man can not tell whiche is it.

                     The churche which I haue described is visible / it hath members whiche maie bee seen / and also / I haue afore declared / by what markes and tokens it maie be knowen. But if either our eies are so daselled / that wee can not se it / or that Sathan hath brought suche darkenes into the worlde / that it is hardde to discerne the true church: that is not the faulte of the churche / but either of our blindenesse / or of sathans darkenesse. But yet in this most depe darkenesse / there is one moste cleare candle / which of it selfe alone is able to put awaie all darkenesse. Thy worde is a candle vnto my feete / and a lyght vnto my steppes.
                        Psal. 119.
                  
                  The church of Christe is a Catholique or vniuersall church dispersed throughout the whole world:
                        Anton obiect. 7. 2. Tim. 2. Matt. 25. Mat. 3.13. This church is the great house of God / in this are good men and euel mingled together / goates and sheepe / corne and chaffe / it is the nette whiche ga: thereth of all kinde of fishes: This churche can not erre / because Christe hath promised it his spirite / which shal lead it into all truth / 
                        Ioan. 16. Mat. 16.28 and that the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it / that he will bee with it vnto thende of the worlde: What so euer it shall lose or binde apon earth / shalbe ratified in heauen

/ &c.1. Tim. 3. Cōtra epi. funda. c. 5. This churche is the piller / and staie of the treuth / this is it for the whiche S. Augustine saith he beleueth the gospell. But this vniuersall church alloweth the Masse / because the more parte of the same alloweth it / Therfore &c.
                  I graunt that the name of the churche is taken after three diuerse maners in the scripture.
                        N. Rydl. Ansvu.
                      Sometime for the hole multitude of them which professe the name of Christe / of the which they are also named christians. But as S. Paul saith of the Iew / 
                        Rom. 2. Rom. 9. Not euery one is a Iew / that is a Iew outwardly et c. Neither yet all that bee of Israell / are counted the seed. Euen so not euery one which is a christian outwardly / is a christian in deed.
                        Rom. 8. For if any manne haue not the spirite of Christe / the same is none of his. Therfore that church which is his body / and of which Christ is the heade / standeth onely of liuing stones / and true christians / 1. Pet. 2. not only outwardly in name and title / but inwardli in harte and in truth.
                  But forasmuch as this church (whiche is the seconde takinge of the churche) as touching the outward felowshippe / is contained within that great house / and hath with the same / outwarde societie of the sacramentes and ministerie of the woorde / many thinges are spoken of that vniuersall church (whiche S. Austen calleth the mingled churche) whiche can not truely be vnderstanded / but onely of that purer parte of the churche. So that the rule

of Tyconius concerning the mingled church / may here well take place.
                        Augu. de doc. Crist. l. 3. cap. 32. When there is attributed vnto the whole churche / that whiche canne not agree vnto the same / but by reason of thone parte therof: that is either for the multitude of good mē / which is the churche in deed / or for the multitude of euell men / whiche is the malignante churche / and synagoge of Sathan:
                        Apo. 2. And is also the thirde takinge of the churche / of the which / although there be seldomer mentiō in the scriptures / in that signification yet in the worlde / euen in the most famouse assembles of christendome / this churche hath borne the greatest swynge. This distinction presupposed / of the three sortes of churches / it is an easye matter / by a figure called Synecdoche / to geue to the mingled and vniuersall churche / that which canne not truelye be vnderstanded / but onely of thone parte therof.
                  But if any manne will stiflye affirme that vniuersalitie dooth so pertaine vnto the churche / that whatsoeuer Christe hath promised to the church / it muste needes be vnderstanded of that / I woulde gladly knowe of the same man / wher that vniuersalle churche was in the tymes of the patriarches / and pophetes / 
                        Exod. 17. 3. Reg. 19. Hiere. 6. of Noe / Abraham / and Moses (at such tyme as the people wold haue stoned hym) of Helias / of Hieremie: in the tymes of Christe / and the dispersion of the Apostles / in the time of Arius when Constantius was Emperour / 
                        Theo. ecc. his. l. 2. c. 15 61. and Felix bisshoppe of Rome / succeded Liberius. It is worthie

to be noted / that Lira writeth apon Mathew.
                        Lyra in Matt.
                      The churche (sayeth he) doth not stande in men by reason off theyr power / or dignitee / whether it be Ecclesiasticall / or seculer / for many princes ād popes / and other inferiours haue ben fownde to haue fallen awaye frome godde. Therfore the churche consisteth in those persones / in whome is true knowlege / and confession of the fayth / and off the Truthe. Euell men (as it is in a glose of the Decrees) are in the churche in name / and not in dede.
                        De poenit. dist. 1. c. ecclesia. Lib. 1. c. 33. And S. Augustine / contra Crescomū gram̄aticū sayeth / Who so euer is afrayed to be deceiued by the darkenesse off this qwestiō / let hym aske cownsell at the same church of it: which churche / the scripture doth poynte oute withoute any doubtefulnesse. All my notes which I haue written and gathered owte of such authors as I haue redde in this matter / and suche like are com̄e into the hādes of such / as will not let me haue the leaste of all my writtē bookes: wherin I am enforced to complayne of them vnto godde / for they spoile me of all my labours / which I haue takē in my studye these many yeares. My memorie was neuer goode / for helpe wheroff I haue vsed for the moste parte / to gather owte notes of my readinge and so to place thē / that therby I might haue hadde the vse of them / when the tyme required. But who knoweth whether this be goddes will / that I shulde be thus ordred / ād spoiled of the poore learninge I hadde (as me thoughte) in stoore / to thintēte that I now destitute of that / shuld frome hēceforth learne onely to knowe with Paule / 1. Cor. 2. Christe

/ and hym crucifyed. The Lorde graūte me herin to be a goode yonge scoler / and to learne this lesson so wel / that neither deathe / nor liffe / wealth / nor woo / &c. make me euer to forgette that. Amē. Amē.
                  I haue no more to saye in this matter / for you your selfe haue sayd all that is to be sayed.

                      That same vehemente sayeng of S. Augustine. I wolde not beleue the gospelle / &c. was wonte to troble manie men / as I remember I haue redde it well qualiffied off Philippe Melanchton / but my memorie is alltogether slypperie. This it is in effecte. The churche is not a iudge /

                      but a witnesse. Ther wer in his tyme that lyghtly estemed the testimony of the churche / and the owtwarde ministerie of preachynge / and reiected the owteward worde it selfe / stickinge only to theyr inwarde reuelations. Such rasshe contempte of the worde / prouoked and droue S. Augustine into that excessiue vehemence. In the which / after the bare sownd of the wordes / he might seeme to such as doo not attaine vnto his meanynge / that he preferred the churche farre before the gospell / and that the Churche hath a free Authoritee ouer the same: but that godly man neuer thoughte so. It wer a saynge worthy to be broughte forthe agaynst the Anabaptistes / which thinke the open ministerie to be a thinge not necessarie / if they anie thinge estemed such testimonies. I wolde not sticke to affirme / that the moore parte of the greate howse / that is to saye of the hoole vniuersall

churche / maye easely erre And agayne / I wolde not sticke to affirme / that it is one thinge to be gathered together in the name off Christe / and another thinge / to comme together with a Masse off tholye ghooste goynge before. For in the firste Christe ruleth / in the latter the deuel beareth the swinge: and how then can anie thinge be goode that they goo abowte? frome thys latter shall our Sixe Articles comme forth agayne into the lyghte / they them selfes being verie darkenesse. But it is demaunded / 
                        A questiō
                        
                      whether the fownder or better parte of the catholyque church / may be seene of men / or no? S. Paule sayeth:
                        Ansvuer.
                      The Lorde knoweth them that are his. What maner of speaking is this in commēdation of the lorde / if we knowe as well as he who are his? Well / thus is the texte: The Sure fowndation of godde standeth still / and hath this seale: the Lorde knoweth them that are hys / and let euerie man that nameth the name of Christe departe frome iniquite. Now how many are ther of the hoole Catholique church of England which departe from iniquite? How many of the noble men / how many of the bysshops or cleargie / how many of the ryche men / or merchauntes / how many of the qwenes cownsellers / yea / how many of the hoole realme? In how smalle rowme then I praye you / is the true church within the realme of Englande? and wher is it? and in what state? I hadde a cōceipte of myne owne well grownded (as they saye) when I began / but now it is fallen by the waye.

                  But that anie such counsell hath at anie tyme allowed the masse / such a one as ours was of late / in a straunge tounge / and stuffed with so manie / absurditees / errours / and superstitions / that I vtterly denye / 2. Cor. 6. and I affirme it to be impossible. For like as ther is no agreement betwixe lyghte and darknesse / betwixe Christe and Belial / so surely superstition / and the syncere Religion of Christe / will worship / and the pure worshippinge of godde / such as godde requireth of his / 
                        Ioan. 4. that is / in spirite ād truth / can neuer agree together.
                  
                     But ye will saye / wher so greate a Companie is gathered together / it is not credible / but ther be two / or three / gathered in the name of Christe. I answer If ther be one hundreth goode / and two hūdreth badde / forasmoche as the decrees / and ordinances are pronounced accordinge to the greater numbre of the multitude of voyces / what can the lesse numbre of voices auayle? It is a knowne thinge / and a commē prouerbe: Often tymes the greater parte / 
                        A prouerbe.
                      ouercommeth the Better.
                  As touching general counseils / 
                        H. Laty.
                      at this present I haue no more to say / thē you haue sayd. Only I refer you to your own experience / to thinke of our cō

                      The more part in my time did brīg furth the sixe articles / for thē the king wold so haue it / being seduced of certē. Afterward the more part did repel the same / our goode Iosias willing to haue it so. The same articles now again (alas) another greater / but wurse part / hath restored. O what an vncertaintie is this? But after this sort most commonly are mans procedings. God be mercifull vnto vs. Who shall deliuer vs from such tormēts of mind?

                        Anton. obiect. 9.Yf the matter shoulde go thus / that in generall counsailes menne shoulde not stande to the more numbre of the whole multitude / I meane of them whiche ought to geue voices / then shoulde no certaine rule bee lefte vnto the churche / by the whiche controuersies in waightie matters might bee determined / but it is not to bee beleued / that Christe woulde leaue his churche destitute of so necessarie a helpe and sauegarde.
                  
                     
                        N. Ryd. Ansvu. Ephes. 5.Christe / who is the moste louinge spouse of his espoused the church / who also gaue himselfe for it / that he mighte sainctifie it vnto himselfe / did geue vnto it abundantlye all thinges which are necessarie to saluacion / but yet so / that the churche shoulde declare it selfe obediente vnto him in all thinges / and kepe it selfe within the boundes of his commaundementes / and further / not to seke any thing whiche he teacheth not / as necessarie vnto saluacion. Nowe further / for determination of all controuersies in Christes religion / 
                        Luc. 16. Christe himselfe hath left vnto the church not only Moses / and the Prophetes / 
                        Esa. 8. whome he willeth his church in all doutes to go vnto / and aske counsell at / but also the gospelles / and the reste of the bodie of the newe testamente: in the whiche whatsoeuer is harde in Moses and the prophetes / whatsoeuer is necessarie to be knowen vnto saluation / is reueled and opened.
                  So that nowe wee haue no neede to saie / who shall clime into heauen / 
                        Rom. 10. or who shall go downe into

the depth / to tell vs what is needfull to be done. Christ hath done both / and hath commended vnto vs the worde of faith / whiche also is aboundantly declared vnto vs in his worde writtē / so that hereafter if wee walke earnestly in this waie to the ser / ching out of the trueth / it is not to be doubted / but throughe the certaine benifite of Christes spirite / 
                        Luke. 11. which he hath promised vnto his / we may finde it / and obtaine euerlastinge life. Shoulde mēne aske counsell of the dead for the liuing saieth Esaie?
                        Esai. 8. Let thē go rather to the law / and to the testimonie. et c. Christe sendeth them that bee desierouse to knowe the trueth vnto the scriptures / saiynge / 
                        Iohn. 5. search the scriptures. I remembre a like thing well spoken of Hierome.
                        Hieron. in 23. Math.
                      Ignoraunce of the scriptures is the mother / and cause of al erroures / and in another place as I remembre in the same authoure. The knoweledge of the scripturs is the fode of euerlasting life. But nowe me thinketh I enter into a verie broade sea / in that I beginne to shewe / either oute of the scriptures them selues / or oute of the aunciente writers how muche the holy scripture is of force to teache the trueth of oure religion. But this is it / that I am nowe aboute / that Christe wold haue the church his spouse in all doubtes to aske counsel at the word of his father writtē / ād faithfully lefte / and cōmēded vnto it in boeth testamētes the old / and the newe. Neither do we reede that Christ in any place hath laiede soo greate a burthen vpon the members of his spouse / that he hath commaūded

them to go to the vniuersall churche.
                        Rom. 15. What soeuer thinges are written (saieth Paule) are written for oure learninge. And it is true that Christ gaue vnto his churche / some Apostels / some Prophetes / some Euangelistes / 
                        Ephe. 4. some shepards / and teachers / to the edifiynge of the sainctes / till wee all come to the vnitie of faithe / et c. But that all menne should meete together / oute of all partes of the worlde / to define of the articles of our faith / I neither finde it commaunded of Christe nor written in the worde of God.
                  
                     
                        H. Latim.
                     There is a diuersitie betwixt thinges pertaining to God / or faith / and Politique or Ciuile matters. For in the firste we muste stande onely to the scriptures / whiche are able to make vs all perfecte / and instructed vnto saluation / 2. Tim. 3. if they bee well vnder / standed. And they offre thēselues to be wel vnderstanded onelye to them / whiche haue good willes / and geue themselues to studie / and praier. Neither are there any menne lesse / apt to vnderstand them / then the prudent and wise men of the worlde.
                  But in the other / that is in Ciuile or Politique matters / often tymes the magistrates doe tolerate a lesse euil / for auoiding of a greater / as they which haue this saiynge ofte in their mouthes. Better an inconuenience / then a mischieffe: and it is the propertie of a wise man (saieth one) to dissemble many thinges: And he that canne not dissemble / can not rule. In which saiyngs they bewraie themselues / 

that they doe not earnestely weighe / what is iuste / what is not. Wherfore / forasmuch as mās lawes / if it bee but in this respecte onely / that they bee deuised by menne / are not able to bringe any thing to perfection / but are enforced of necessitie to suffre many things out of sqware / and are cōpelled somtime to wynke at the worste thinges / seinge they knowe not howe to maintaine the common peace and quiet otherwise / 
                        Gal. 3. 1. Cor. 3. Rom. 3. Psa. 116. Lib. 1. retr. cap. 10. they do ordaine that the more part shall take place. Yow know what these kindes of speaches mean / I speke after the maner of men / yee walke after the maner of men / all men are liers. And that of S Augustine / if ye liue after mannes reason / ye do not liue after the will of God.
                  Yf ye saie / the councels haue sometimes erred / 
                        Anton. obiect. 10. or maie erre / howe then shoulde we beleue the catholique Churche? For the councels are gathered by the authoritie of the catholique churche.
                  From maie bee / to bee in deede / 
                        N. Rid. ansvv.
                      is no good argument / but from being / to maie bee / no man doubteth / but it is a most sure argument. But now that councels haue sometime erred / it is manifeste. Howe manie councels were there in the east part of the worlde / 
                        Socr. eccle. hist. l. 2. which condemned the Nicene counceil? and al those which wold not forsake the same / thei called by a sclāderouse name (as thei thought) Homousiās. Was not Athanasius / Chrisostome / Cyrille / Eustachius / men verie well learned / and of

godly life / 
                        Socr. eccl. H. l. 1. c. 24.32. Theod. l. 5. cap. 34. Obiectiō.
                      banished / and cōdēned as famouse heritiques / ād that by wicked coūcelles? Howe many thinges are there in the Canons and constitutions of the counselles / whiche the papistes them selues do much mislike? But here paraduenture one man will saie vnto me: We will graunt you this in prouincial councelles / or councelles of some one nacion / that they maie sometimes erre: Forasmuche as they do not represente the vniuersall churche / but it is not to be beleued / that the general and full councelles haue erred at any time. Here if I hadde my bookes of the counselles / or rather such notes as I haue gathered out of those bookes / I coulde bring somthīg which should serue for this purpose. But now seing I haue them not / 
                        Ansvuer.
                      I wil recite one place onely out of S. Austen / which (in my iudgdment) maie suffise in this matter in steade of many. Who knoweth not (saieth he) that the holie scripture is so set before vs / 
                        l. 2. de bap. cont. don. cap. 3. that it is not lawefull to doubte of it / and that the letters of Bishops / maye be reproued by other wiser men̄es wordes / ād by coūcelles: and that the coūsels thēselues / which are gathered by prouīces ād coūtries / dooe geue place to the authoritie of the general ād ful coūcelles: ād that the former general coūcels are amēded by the latter / whē as by some experience of things / either that which was shut vp / is opened / or that whiche was hid is knowen. Thus muche of Augustine. But I wyl plead with our Autoniane / vpō matter confessed▪ Here with vs when as papisttie reagned / I pray

you howe doth that booke / whiche was called the Bishoppes booke / made in the time of King Henry the eighte / whereof the Bishoppe of Winchester is thought to be either the first father / 
                        The Bisschops booke.
                      or chiefe gatherer / howe doeth it (I saie) sharpely reproue the florentine counceile / in which was decreed the supremacie of the Bishoppe of Rome / and that with the consente of the Emperoure of constantinople / and of the Grecians? So that in those daies oure learned / aunciente fathers / and Bisshoppes of Englande / did not sticke to affirme that a generall counceile mighte erre. But me thinketh I heare another manne despising all that I haue broughte furthe / and saiynge. These whiche you haue called counceiles / are not worthy to be called counceiles / but rather assembles / and cōuēticles of heritiques I pray you syr / why do you iudge them worthie of so slanderouse a name? Because (sayth he) they decreed thinges heretical / contrarie to true godlines / and sounde doctrine / and against the faith of christen religion. The cause is waightie / for the which thei ought of right so to be caled. But if it be so that all counceiles oughte to be dispised / whiche decree any thinge contrarie to sounde doctrine / and the trew worde / whiche is according to godlines: forasmuche as the masse / 1. Tim. 6. suche as we haue had here of late / is openly against the worde of Godde / forsothe it must folow of necessitie / that al suche councels / as haue approued such masses / oughte of righte to be fledde / and despised / as conuenticles / 

and assembles of menne that straie from the truth.
                  
                     
                        The B. of Romes authoritee.
                     Another man alledgeth vnto me the authoritie of the Bisshop of Rome / withoute whiche / neither can the counsels (saith he) be lawefully gathered / neither beinge gathered determine any thing concerning religiō. But this obiection is only grounded vpon the ambitoiuse and shamelesse maintenaunce of the Romishe tyrāny / and vsurped dominion ouer the cleargie / 
                        England abiured the popes supremacie.
                      whiche tyrānie we Englisshe men / longe ago / by the consent of the whole Realme / haue expulsed / and abiured. And howe rightlie we haue done it / a litle booke set furth / de vtraque potestate / (that is of booeth the powers) doeth clerelye shewe. I graunt that the Romishe ambition hath gone aboute to chalenge to it selfe / and to vsurpe suche a priueledge of olde time.
                        Cōc. Carthag. 3. But the counsell of Carthage / in the yeare of our Lorde / 457. did openly withstande it and also the counseil at Milcuyte: in the whiche S. Augustin was present / 
                        Can. 22. did prohibite anie appellations to be made to Bisshoppes beyond the sea.
                  S. Augustine saieth the good men are not to be forsaken for the euell / 
                        Anton. obiect. 11. Ep. 48. but the euell are to bee borne withal for the good. Ye will not saie (I trowe) that in our congregations all be euell.
                  
                     
                        N. Ryd. Ansvuer.
                     I speake nothing of the goodnesse or euelnesse of your congregacions / but I fighte in Chrstes quarell

againste the masse whiche doth vtterlye take awaie and ouerthrowe the ordinance of Christ. Let that be taken quite away / and then the particion of the walle that made the striefe shalbe brokē doune Nowe to the place of S. Austine / for bearing with the euill for the goods sake / there ought to be added other woordes / whiche the same writer hath expressedly in other places. That is:
                        Aug. l. 3. cont. literas parm. cap. 2.3. if those euell men do caste abroad no seedes of false doctrine / nor lead other / to destruction / by their example.
                  Yt is perilouse to atempt any newe thinge in the church / which lacketh example of good men.
                        Anton. obiect. 12. How muche more perilouse is it / to commit any act / vnto the which / thexample of the prophets / of Christ / and of thapostles are contrary. But vnto this your fact / in abstaining from the church by reason of the masse / the example of the prophetes / of Christe / and of thapostles are cleane contrarie. Therefore. et c. The firste part of the argument is euident / and the seconde parte I proue thus. In the tymes of the Prophetes / of Christ / and his Apostels / all things were mooste corrupte. The people was miserablye geuen to superstition / the priestes dispised the law of god: and yet not withstanding / we neither read that the prophetes made any schismes or diuisiōs / and Christ himselfe haūted the temple / and taught in the temples of the Iewes.
                        Luc. 21. Acto. 3. Acto. 13. Peter and Ihon wēt vppe into the temple at the ninthe howre of praier Paule after the readinge of the lawe / being desyred

to saie something to the people / did not refuse to doe it. Yea / further no mā can shewe / that either the Prophetes / or Christ / and his Apostles / did refuse to praie together with others / to sacrifice / or to be partakers of the Sacramentes of Moses law.
                  I graunt the former parte of youre argumente / and to the seconde parte I saie / 
                        N. Rydl. Ansvu.
                      that althoughe it containe mani true thinges / as of the corrupt state in the times of the Prophetes / of Christe / and the Apostles / and of the temple being haūted of Christ and his Apostels / yet notwithstāding the seconde parte of your argument is not sufficientlie proued: For ye oughte to haue proued / that either the Prophets / either Christ / or his Apostles did in the temple / communicate with the people / in any kinde of worshippinge whiche is forbidden by the lawe of God / or repugnant to the worde of god. But that can no where bee shewed / And as for the churche / I am not angrie with it / and I neuer refused to goe to it / and to praie with the people / to heare the worde of God / and to doe all other thinges whatsoeuer maie agree with the worde of God. S Augustin speakinge of the Cerimonies of the Iewes (I suppose in the Epistle ad Ianuariū) although he graunt they greuousely oppressed that people / 
                        Ep. 119. both for the numbre / and bondage of the same / yet he calleth them burdens of the lawe / whiche were deliuered vnto them in the worde of God / not presumptions of men / which notwithstanding if thei

were not cōtrarie to gods word / might after a sort bee borne withall. But nowe / seing they are contrarie / to those thinges whiche are in the worde of god written. Whether they ought to be borne of any Christian or no / let him iudge which is spiritual which feareth God more then mā / and loueth euerlastinge life / more then this shorte and transitorie life. To that which was saied that my facte lacketh example of the godlie fathers that haue goone before / the contrarie is moste euident in the historie of Tobie. Of whome it is saied / 
                        Tob. 1. that when all other went to the golden calues / which Hieroboam the Kinge of Israel hadde made / he himselfe alone fledde all their companies / and gotte him to Ierusalē / vnto the temple of the Lorde / and there worshipped the Lorde God of Israel.3. Reg. 13. Did not the man of God threaten greuouse plages both vnto the priestes of Bethell / and to the aulter whiche Hieroboam had there made after his owne fantasie? Whiche plages Kinge Iosias the true minister of god did execute at the time appointed.4. Reg. 23. And where doe we read that the Prophetes / or thapostles / did agree with the people in their Idolatrie? When as the people went a whoring with their hill aulters / for what cause I praie you did the prophets rebuke the people so muche / as for their false worshipping of god after their owne minds / and not after gods woorde? For what was so muche as that was? wherfore the false prophetes ceased not to maligne the true prophetes of God: Therfore they bet them

they bannisshed them.

                      in the vulgar toung for the peoples sake which are

presente / that they maye the better vnderstande theyr owne profession / and also be more hable to teache their childrē the same / yet notwithstanding ther is not lyke necessitee of the vulgare tounge in Baptisme / and in the lordes supper. Baptisme is geuē to children / who by reason of their aege are not able to vnderstande what is spoken vnto them what tounge soeuer it be. The lordes supper / is / and oughte to be geuen to them / that are wexen. More ouer / in Baptisme which is accustomed to be geuen to children in the Latin tounge / all the substantial poyntes (as a man wolde saye) which Christe commawnded to be doone / are obserued. And therfore I iudge that Baptisme / to be a perfecte and true baptisme: and that it is not only not nedefull / but also not lawfull / for anie man so Christened / to be Christened againe. Butt yet notwithstandynge / they oughte to be tawghte the Cathechisme of the Christen fayth / whan they shall come to yeares of discretion: Which Cathechisme / who so euer despiseth / or will not desirously embrace / and willingly learne / in my iudgemente he plaieth not the parte of a Christiane man. But in the popisshe masse are wantynge certeyne substantialles / that is to saye / thinges commawnded by the worde of godde to be obserued in ministration of the lordes supper: of the which ther is sufficient declaration made before.
                  
                     
                        H. Laty.
                     Wher you saye (I wolde wisshe? surely I wolde

wisshe / that you hadde spoken more vehemently / and to haue sayed it is of necessitee / that all thinges in the congregation shulde be doone in the vulgare tounge / for thedyffyenge and cōforte of them that are presente. Nottwithstandinge that the childe it selfe is sufficientlye baptised in the Latin tounge.
                  Forasmoche as I perceiue you are so stifflie / 
                        Anton. obiect. 14 I will not saye obstinately bente / and so wedded to your owne opinion / that no gentle exhortations / no holsome cownsayles / no other kynde of meanes can call you home to a better mynde: ther remayneth / that which in lyke cases was wonte to be the only remedye agaynst stiffe necked / and stubburne persones / that is / you muste be hampered by the lawes / and compelled either to obey whether ye will or no / or elles to suffer that / which a rebelle to the lawes oughte to suffer. Doo you not knowe that whosoeuer refuseth to obeye the lawes of the realme / he bewrayeth himselfe to be an enemye to his cowntrey? Doo you not knowe that this is the redyest waye / to stirre vp sedition / and ciuille warre? Yt is better that you shulde beare your owne synne / then that throughe thexample of your breache of the commē lawes / the cōmen qwiette shulde be disturbed. How can you saye / you will be the qwenes true subiecte / when as you doo openly professe / that you will not kepe her lawes?
                  
                     
                     
                        N. Ryd. Ansvuer.
                     O heauenly father / the father of all wisedom / vnderstandinge / and true strengthe / I besech thee for thy onli sonne our sauiour Christes sake / looke mercifulli vpon me wretched creature / and sende thine holye spirite into my breaste / that not only I maye vnderstāde according to thy wisedome / how this pestilēt and deadly dart is to be borne of / and with what aunswere it is to be beaten backe / but also when I must ioyne to fight in the fielde for the glorye of thy name / that then I being strengthened with the defence of thy right hande / maie manfully stande in the confession of thy faieth / and of thy trueth / and continue in the same vnto the ende of my life / through the same our Lorde Iesus Christ. Amen.
                  Nowe to the obiection. I graunt it to be reasonable / that he whiche by woordes and gentilnesse can not be made yealde to that is right and good / shoulde bee bridled by the straite correction of the lawes: that is to saie / he that will not bee subiect to gods worde / muste be punished by the lawes. It is true that is commenly saide. He that will not obeie the gospell / muste be tamed and taught by the rigoure of the lawe. But these thynges oughte to take place againste him / whiche refuseth to do that is right / and iuste / according to true godlines: not againste hym / whyche can not quietelye beare superstitions / and the ouerthrowe of Christes institutions / but doth hate / and detest from his harte / 

suche kinde of procedinges / and that for the glorie of the name of God. To that which ye saie a transgressour of the commen lawes / bewraieth himselfe to be an enemy of his countrie / suerly a man ought to looke vnto the nature of the lawes / what maner of lawes they bee whiche are broken. For a faithfull Christian oughte not to thinke alike of all maner of lawes. But that saiyng ought onelye truely to bee vnderstanded of suche lawes as bee not contrarie to gods woorde. Otherwise whosoeuer loue their contrie in treuth / (that is to saie in God) they wyll alwaies iudge (if at any time the lawes of god and manne be thone contrarie to the other) that a man ought rather to obeie God then manne.
                        Acto. 4. And they that thinke otherwise / and pretende a loue to their contrie / forasmuche as they make their contrie to fyghte as it were againste Godde in whome consisteth the onelie staie of the countrie / surelye I do thinke that suche are to bee iudged mooste deadly enemies / and tratours to their countrie. For they that fighte againste Godde / whiche is the safetie of theyr countrie / what doe they els but go aboute to bryng vpon theyr countrie a presente ruine and destruction. But they that do so are worthelie to be iudged enemies to their countrie / and betraiours of the Realme / Therfore &c.
                  But this is the rediest waie (ye saie) to stir vp sedition / to trouble the quiete of the commen welth / 

therfore are these thinges to bee repressed in time / by force of lawes. Beholde Sathan doth not cease to practise hisolde giles / 
                        Satā & his ministers doo alvuayes charge the godly vuith sedition. 3. Reg. 18. Hiere. 26. ād accustomed subtilties. He hath euer this darte in a readines to whorle againste his aduersaries / to accuse them of sedition that he maie bringe them (yf he can) in daunger of the higher powers. For so hath he by his ministers alwaies charged the Prophetes of Godde. Achab saied vnto Elias art thou he that troubleth Iraell? The false prophetes also complained to their Princes of Hieremie that his woordes were seditious and not to be suffered / Did not the Scribes / and Pharisies falselye accuse Christe as a seditious person / 
                        Luc. 23. Ioan. 19, Acto. 24. and one that spake againste Cesar? Did they not at the laste crie if you let this manne go you are not Cesars frende? The Oratoure Tertullus how doth he accuse Paule before Felix the highe deputie? We haue founde this man (saith he) a pestilent felowe / and a sterer of sedition vnto all the Iewes in the whole worlde &c. But I praie you were these men as they were called seditious persons. Christ / Paule / and the Prophetes? God forbid. But they were of false men / falsely accused. And wherefore I praie you? but because they reproued before the people their giles / superstition / and deceites. And when the other could not bere it / and would gladly haue hadde them taken out of the waie / they accused them as seditious persons / and troublers of the commen wealthe / that beinge by this meanes made hatefull to the people / and Princes / they

mighte the more easilie be snatched vppe to be tormented / and put to death. But howe far they were from al sedition / their whole doctrine / life / and conuersation doeth well declare. For that whiche was obiected laste of all / that he canne not be a faithfull subiecte to his prince which professeth openly that he will not obserue the lawes / whiche the prince hath made: here I woulde wishe that I mighte haue an indifferente iudge / and one that feareth god / to whose iudgement in this cause I promise I will stande. I aunswere therfore a man oughte to obeie his prince / but in the Lorde / and neuer against the Lorde. For he that knowingly obeith his prince against god doth not a duetie to the prince / but is a decieuer of the Prince / and an helper vnto him to worke his own destruction. He is also vniust whiche geueth not the prince / that is the princes / and to god that is gods. Here commeth to my remembraunce / that notable saiynge of Valentinianus / the Emperoure for chosinge the Bisshop of Millaine. Set him (saith he) in the bishops seate / 
                        Theodor. eccl. hist. l. 4. cap. 5. Euse. eccl. histo. l. 4. cap. 4. Niceph. li. 3. cap. 35. to whome if wee (as man) do offende at any time / we maie submitte our selues. Policarpus the moste constante Martyr when he stode before the chiefe Ruler and was commaunded to blaspheme Christe / and to sweare by the fortune of Caesar &c. He aunswered with a milde spirite: we are taught (saieth he) to geue honoure vnto princes and those powers whiche be of god / but suche honoure as is not contrarie to gods religion.
                  
                     Hitherunto ye see good father / howe I haue in wordes onely made as it were a florishe before the fighte whiche I shortelie looke after / and howe I haue begōne to prepare certaine kindes of wepōs / to fight againste the aduersaries of Christe / and to muse with my selfe / howe the dartes of the olde enemie maie be borne of / and after what sort I maie smite him againe with the sworde of the spirite.
                        Ephes. 6. I learne also hereby to be in vre with armour / and to assaie howe I canne goe armed.
                  In Tyndall where I was borne / not farre from the scotishe borders / I haue knowen my contreiemen watche nighte and daie in their harnesse / such as they hadde / that is in their Iackes: and their speares in their hands (you call thē northen gads) specially when they hadde any priuye warninge of the cōming of the scottes. And so doyng / although at euerie suche bickeringes some of them spente their lifes / yet by suche meanes like pretie men they defended their countrie. And those that soe died / I thinke that before God they died in a good quarel / and their ofspringe and progenie / all the countrie loued them the better for their fathers sakes. And in the quarell of Christe our sauioure / in the defense of his owne diuine ordinaunces / by the whiche he geueth vnto vs lyfe and immortalitie / yea / in the quarell of faithe / and Christian religion / wherein resteth oure euerlastinge saluacion / shall wee not watche? shall we not goe alwaies armed? euer lokinge when oure aduersarie (whiche like a roaringe

Lyon seeketh whome he maie deuoure) shall come vpon vs by reason of oure slouthfulnesse.1. Pet. 5. Yea / and woe be vnto vs / if he canne oppresse vs at vnwares / whiche vndoubtedly he wil doe / if he finde vs slepinge. Let vs awake therfore / for if the good manne of the house knewe what houre / the thiefe woulde come / he woulde surely watche / and not suffer his house to be brokē vp.

                      Let vs awake therfore I saie / and lette vs not suffer oure house to bee broken vp. Resist the Deuill saieth S. Iames and he will flie from you.
                        Iaco. 4. Lette vs therfore resiste him māfullie / ād taking the crosse vpō oure shoulders / let vs folow our captaine Christ / who by his owne bloude / hathe dedicated and halowed the waye whiche leadeth vnto the father / that is to the light whiche no man can attaine / 1. Tim. 6. the fountaine of euerlasting ioyes. Let vs folow I saye / whither he calleth and allureth vs / that after these afflictions / whiche laste but for a momente / whereby he trieth our faith / as gold by the fiere / we maie euerlastinglye raigne / and triumphe with him in the glorie of the father / and that throughe the same oure Lorde / and Sauiour Iesus Christ / to whome with the father and the holie ghooste bee all honoure and glorie nowe and for euer. Amen. Amen.
                  Goode father / forasmoch as I haue determined with my selfe / to powre forthe these my cogitatiōs into your bosome / her me thinketh I see you sodenly liftyng vp your heade towardes heauen / after

your maner / and thē lookynge apon me with your propheticall countenāce / and speakynge vnto me / with these or like wordes. Truste not my sonne (I beseche you vouchsafe me the honour of this name for in so doynge I shall thinke my selfe both honoured / and loued of you.) Truste not I saye my sonne to these worde weapons:1. Cor. 4. for the kingdome of godde / is not in wordes / but in power. And remember allwayes the wordes of the lorde / doo not imagine afore hande / 
                        Matt. 10. Marc. 11. what and how you will speake / for it shall be geuen you / euē in that same howre what ye shall speake / for it is not ye that speake / but the spirite of your father which speaketh in you. I praye you therfore father / praie for me / that I maye caste my hoole care apon hym / and truste apon hym in all perilles. For I knowe / and am surely perswaded / that / what soeuer I can imagine or thinke afore hande / it is nothinge / excepte he assiste me with his spirite when the tyme is. I beseche you therfore father / 
                        Ephes. 6. praie for me / that such a complete harnesse of the spirite / suche boldnesse of mynde may be geuen vnto me / that I maye owte of a true fayth saye with Dauid.
                        Psal. 44. I will not truste in my bowe / ād it is not my swearde that shal saue me. For he hath no pleasure in the strengthe of an horse / &c.
                        Psal. 147. But the lordes delyte is in them that feare hym / and putte theyr truste in his mercye. I besech you praye / praye / that I maye entre thys fyghte / only in the name of godde / and that when all is paste / I beinge not ouercome throughe his gratiouse ayde /

                  Now father I praye you helpe me to buckle on this geare a little better. For you knowe the depenes of Sathan / beynge an olde souldyar / 
                        Apoc. 2. ād you haue collered with hym or now: blessed be godde / that hath euer aided you so well. I suppose he maye well holde you at the baye / but truly he will not be so willynge (I thynke) to ioyne with you / as with vs yongelynges.
                  Syr I beseche you / let your seruaunt reade this my bablinge vnto you / and nowe and then / as it shall seme vnto you beste / let youre penne runne on my booke / spare not to blotte my paper I geue you good leaue.
                  As touchinge this Antoniane / whome I haue here made mine aduersarie / leste paraduenture anie ymagination mighte carrie you amisse / and make you thinke otherwise then I ment: Knowe you that I haue alluded to one Antonie a mooste cruel Bisshoppe of the Arianes / and a very violent persecuter of them that were Catholique / 
                        Victor. li. 3. de persequut. Aphricae.
                      and of a righte iudgemente. To whome Hunericus a Tyrante of the Vandales / knowing Antonies fearcenes committed his whole autoritie / that he should

either turne the Christians which beleued well / vnto his false Religion / or els to punish and torment them at his pleasure. Which thing Antonius toke in hande to doe / and executed the same againste a greate numbre / but specially againste two mooste godlie Bisshoppes / and most constante in the doctrine whiche was according to godlinesse.
                        Tit. 1. The name of thone was Eugenius an aged man / thother was named Habet deum. This Latter as it appeareth by Victors Historie of the persecutions of the Vandales booth the Tyranne / and the false counterfaicte Bisshoppe desiered muche to haue turned vnto their mooste pestilēt heresie. This Habet deum / was bisshope of the Citee Tamallune / wher Antonie hadde ben bisshoppe before. And when Antonie hadde vexed hym (as the storie sayeth) with diuerse and sundrie persequutions / and hadde fownde the souldiar of Christe allwaies constante in his Confession / it is sayd / that at lengthe in a greate rage he swoore / and sayd to his frendes on this wise: yf I make hym not of our Religion / then am I not Antonie: it is incredible what harmes and troubles he putte hym to / what crueltye he practised against him / and it wer to longe now / to describe the same vnto you. But the man of god stoode allwayes vnmooueable / and in the confession of Christes fayth remayned euer vnto thende / the constante and vnfoyled souldyare of Christe. Thys goode Bisshoppe Habet deum / I praye to godde our heauēly father to geue me grace that

I maye fathefully folowe / throughe our Lorde Iesus Christe / Amen.
                  Syr I haue cawsed my man not onely to reade your armour vnto me / but also to write it owte / 
                        H. Laty.
                      for it is not onely no bare armour / but also well buckled armour / I see not how it could be better. I thā
                     ke you euē frome the botome of my harte for it / and my praier you shall not lacke / trustinge that you do the like for me. For in deede there is the helpe. &c. Manie thinges make confusion in memorie. And if I were as well learned as was Sainct Paul. I woulde not bestowe muche amongest them / further then to gaule them / and spurgall to / when / and where as occasion were geuen / and matter came to minde / for the lawe shall bee their shote anchour / staye and refuge.
               
            
            Fare you well in Christe.
         
         
            
            A treatise agaīst the errour of transubstantiation / made by the fornamed Reuerende father Nic. Rydley Byshop of London / in the time of his emprisonmente
            
               MAnie thinges cōfounde the weake memorie. A fewe places well weighed ād perceiued / lightneth the vndstandinge. Trueth is there to bee searched with diligence / where it is certaine to be hadde. Though God do speake the trueth by man / yet in mannes worde which God hath not reueled to bee his / a man maie doubt without mistruste in God. Christ is the truth of God / reueiled vnto man from heauen by God himselfe / and therefore in his worde the trueth is to bee founde / whyche is to bee embraced of all that be his. Christe biddeth vs aske and wee shall haue / Searche and we shall finde / Knocke and it shal be opened vnto vs. Therfore O heauenly father autour and fountaine of all truth / the bottomeles Sea of al true vnderstanding / send doune wee beseche thee thy holye spirite into oure hartes / and lighten oure vnderstanding with the beames of thy heauenly grace. We aske the this O heauenlie father not in respect of our desertes / but for thy deare Sonne oure Sauiour Iesus Christes

sake. Thou knoweste O heauenlye father / that the controuersie aboute the Sacrament of the blessed bodie and bloude of thy deare Sonne oure Sauioure Christe / hathe troubled not of late onelie thy churche of England / Fraūce / Germanie / and Italye / but also manie yeares agoe. The fault is oures no doubt therof / for we haue deserued thy plage. But O Lorde be mercifull and relieue our miserie / with some light of grace. Thou knoweste O Lorde howe this wicked worlde rolleth vp and doune / and rieleth to and fro / and careth not what thy wil is / so it may abide in welth. Yf truth haue wealth then who are so stoute to defende the truth as they. But if Christes crosse bee laiede on truethes backe / then they vanishe straighte awaie as waxe before the fiere.
                  Truthe in tyme of affliction hath sevin frendes.
                But these are not they O heauenly father for whome I make my most mone / but for those selye ones O Lorde / whiche haue a Zeale vnto thee / those I meane whiche woulde ād wisshe to know thy will and yet are lette / holde backe / and blinded by the subtilties of Sathan / and his ministers / the wickednes of this wretched world / and the sinfull lustes and affections of the fleashe. Alasse Lorde / thou knowest that we be of oure selues but fleash / wherin there dwelleth nothing that is good. How then is it possible for man / without thee (O Lorde) to vnderstande thy truth in deede. Can the naturall man perceiue the will of God?1. Cor. 2. O Lorde to whome thou geuest a Zeale of thee / geue them also we beeseche the knowledge of thy blessed will. Suffer not

them O Lorde blindelie to bee ledde for to striue against thee / as thou didst those (alas) whiche crucified thine owne deare sonne. Forgeue thē O Lorde for thy deare sonnes sake / for they knowe not what they doe. They do thinke (alas) O Lorde for lacke of knowledge / that they doe vnto thee good seruice / euen when againste thee they do moost greuouselie rage.
                  Ioan. 16. Remembre O Lorde we besech the for whom thy Martir Steuen did praie?
                  Acto. 7. and whome thy holy Apostle did so truelye and earnestly loue / that for their saluation he wished hymselfe accursed from thee.
                  Rom. 9. Luc. 23. Remembre O heauenlye father the prayer of thy deare sonne oure Sauioure Christe vpon the crosse / when he saide vnto thee / O Father forgeue them / they knowe not what thei do. With this forgiuenes (O good Lorde) geue me I beseche the thy grace so here briefelye to sette forth the saiyngs of thy sonne our Sauiour Christ / of his euangelists / and of his Apostles / that in this aforesayd controuersie the light of thy trueth / by the lanterne of thy worde maie shine vnto all them that loue thee.
            Of the Lordes laste Supper do speake especially three of the Euangelists / 
                  Matt. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 10.11. Mathewe / Marke / and Luke. But none more plainelie / nor more fully declarethe the same / then doeth S. Paule / partelie in the 10. but especiallye in the 11. Chapiter of the firste Epistle vnto the Corinthianes
            As Mathewe and Marke doe agree muche in forme of woordes: Soe doeth lykewise Luke and

S Paule. But all foure no doubte / as they were all taught in one schole / and enspired with one spirite so taughte they all one trueth. God graunte vs to vnderstande it well.
            Mathewe setteth forth Christes Supper thus.
            
               Matthev.
            
            
               Vuhen euen vuas comme he satt dovune vuith the 12. &c.
               
                  Matt. 26. 
               As they dyd eate Ihesus tooke bread and gaue thākes, brake it, ād gaue it to the disciples and sayd, Take, Eate, This is my body. And he tooke the cuppe, gaue thankes and gaue it to them sayng: Drynke ye all of this. For this is my bloud of the nevue testament, that is shedd for many for the remission of sinnes. I saie vnto you I vuill not drinke henseforth of this fruyte of the vyne tree, vntyll that daye vuhen I shall drinke that nevue in my fathers kingdome. And vuhen they had sayd grace, they vuent out.
            
            
               Marke.
            
            
               Novve Marke speaketh it thus, And as they ate. Iesus tooke breade, blissed and brake,
               
                  Marke. 14. 
               and gaue to them, and saide. Take eate, This is my bodie. And he toke the cuppe, gaue thankes and gaue it them, and they all dranke of it, and he saide vnto them, This is my bloud of the nevve testamente, vvhich is shedde for manye. Verelie I saie vnto you, I vuil drinke no more of the fruite of the vine, vntyll that daie that I drinke that nevve in the kingedome of God.
            
            
               Here Matthew and Marke doo agree not onely in the matter / but also allmost fullye in the fourme of wordes. Sauing that for thies wordes in Mathew (gaue thankes) Marke hath one word (blessed) which signefieth in this place al one. And wher Mathew saithe (drinke ye al of this) Marke saith: and they all dranke of it. And wher Matthew saithe (of this fruyte of the vyne) Marke leaueth owt the worde (this) and saith / of the fruyte of the vyne.
            Nowe lett vs see likewise what agrement in forme of wordes is betwixte S. Luke and S. Paule.
            
               
                  Luke.
               
               Luke vuriteth thus. He toke breade, gaue thankes, brake it and gaue it to them saing: This is my bodye vuich is geuē for you. This doo in remembraunce of me Likevuise also vuhen they had supped he tooke the cupp saynge,
               
                  Luc. 22. 
               This cupp is the nevue testamēt in my bloud vuich is shed for you.
            
            
               
                  S. Paule.
               
               S. Paule setteth fourthe Christes supper thus, the Lord Ihesus the same night in the vuich he vuas betrayed, tooke bread, and gaue thankes, and brake. and said,
               
                  
                     •
                  . Cor. 11. 
               Take, eate, this is my bodie vuiche is broken for you. This doo in remembrance of me. After the same maner he tooke the cupp vuhen supper vuas done saing, This cupp is the nevue testament in my bloud. This doo as often as ye drinke it, in the remembraūce of me: for as ofte, as ye shall eate this bread, and drinke this cuppe, ye shall shevue the Lordes death tyll he comme.
            
            
               Here wher Luke sayth (which is geuen) Paule saythe (which is broken). And as Luke addeth to the wordes of Paule spoken of the cuppe (which is shedd for yow) so likewise Paule addeth to the wordes of Luke (this doo as often as ye shall drinke it in the remēbraunce of me). The rest that followeth in S. Paule both ther and in the x. chapter / perteineth to the right vse and doctrine of the Lordes supper.
            Thus the Euangelistes and S. Paule haue rehersed the wordes and worke of Christ / wherby he dyd institute and ordeine this holye Sacrament of his blessed bodye and bloud to be a perpetuall remembraunce of hym selfe vntill his comminge agayne: of hym self (I saye) that is of his bodye geuen for vs / and of his bloud shedde for the remission of sinnes.
            But this remembraunce thus ordeined as the awthor therof is Christ both god and man: so by thallmighty power of god / farre passeth all kind of remembraunces that any other man is able to make / either of hym self / or of any other thing / for who so euer receueth this holye sacrament thus ordeyned in remembraunce of Christ he receyueth therwith either deathe or lyfe / In this I doo trust we all agree. For saincte Paule saith of the godlie receuers in the x. chapter of his first epistle to the Corinthians.1. Cor. 10. The cuppe of blessing which we blesse / is it

not the partaking or felowshipp of Christes bloud? And also he saieth: the bread which we breake (and meaneth at the Lords table) is it not the partaking or felowshippe of Christes bodie? Nowe the partakinge of Christes bodie and of his bloude vnto the faithfull and godlie / is the partaking or felowship of life and of immortalitie. And againe of the bad and vngodly receiuers / S. Paule plainlie saieth thus.1. Cor. 11. He that eateth of this breade and drinketh of this cuppe vnworthily / he is gilty of the bodie and bloude of the Lorde. O howe necessarie then is it / if we loue life and would eschewe death / to trie and examine oure selues before we eate of this breade / and drinke of this cuppe. For els assuredlie / he that eateth and drinketh vnworthilie / eateth and drinketh his own damnation / because he estemeth not the Lords bodie / that is he receiueth not the Lords bodie with the honoure whiche is due vnto hym. And yet by that whiche was saide / that with the receipte of the holie Sacramente of the blissed bodie and bloude of Christ / is receiued of euerie one good or badde / either life or death: it is not meant that they whiche are deade before God / hereby maie receiue life / or the liuing before God / cā herby receiue deathe. For as none is meete to receiue naturall foode / wherby the naturall life is norished / excepte he be borne / and liue before: so no man can feede / by the receipte of this holie Sacramente / of the foode of eternall life / excepte he bee regenerated and borne of god before. And on the other side / 

no man her receiueth damnation / whiche is not deade before God.
            Thus hitherto withoute all doubte God is my witnes (I saie so farre as I know) there is no controuersie among thē that bee learned in the church of Englāde / concerning the matter of this Sacramente / but all doe agree / whether they be newe or olde (and to speake plaine / and as some of them odiouslye either do call other) whether they bee protestantes / papistes / pharisies or Gospellers.
            And as all do agree hitherto in the aforesaide doctrine: so all doe deteste the wicked herisie of the Messalians whiche be otherwise called Euchites / 
                  Triparti. histo. lib. 7. cap. 11. whiche saide that the holie sacramente canne neither do good nor harme.
            All doo also condemne these wicked Anabaptistes wich putte no difference betwene the Lordes table and the Lordes meate / and their owne.
            And because charitie woulde we shoulde if it be possible / and so far as we maie with the safegarde of good conscience / and maintenaunce of the trueth to agree with all menne: therfore me thinketh it is not charitably done to burthen ani manne either newe or olde as they call them / 
                  Charitie vuil belye no man.
                further then suche do declare themselues to dissente from that we are perswaded to be the trueth / and pretende there to be controuersies / whereas none suche are in dede / and so to multiplie the debate / the whiche the more

it doeth increase / the further it doeth departe from the vnitye that the true Christiā should desire. And againe this is true that the trueth neither needeth nor will bee maintened with lies. It is also a true commen prouerbe / that it is euen sinne to lye vpon the deuell. For though by thy lie thou doeste seame neuer so muche to speake againste the deuell / yet in that thou lieste in deede / thou workest the deuelles woorke / thou doste him seruice / and takeste the deuils parte.
            Nowe / whether then do they godlye and charitablye / 
                  The papistes do belie the prechars of the gospel.
                whiche either by their penne in writyng / or by their wordes in preaching / do beare the simple people in hande that these whiche thus doe teache and beleue: do goe aboute to make the holie Sacrament ordeined by Christe himselfe / a thing no better then a pece of commen baken bread / or / that do saie / that suche do make the holie sacramente of the blessed bodie and bloude of Christ / nothing els but a bare signe / or figure to represente Christ / none otherwise then the Iuie bushe doeth represente the wine in a tauerne / or as a vile person gorgiouslie appareled maie represente a kinge / or a prince / in a plaie? Alas let vs leaue liyng / and speake the truth euerie man not onely to his neighbour / 
                  Ephe 5. but also of his neighbour / for we are membres one of another saith S Paule. The controuersie no doubte whiche at thys daye troubleth the churche (wherin anye meane learned man either olde or newe doth stand in) is not whether the holie sacrament of the bodye

and bloud of Christ is no better thē a piece of cōmē breade or noe? Or whether the Lordes table is no more to bee regarded then the table of any earthlye man or noe? or whether it is but a bare signe or figure of Christe and nothing elles or no? For all doe graunt that S Paules wordes do require / that the breade whiche we breake / is the partakinge of the bodie of Christe. And all also doe graunte him that eateth of that breade or drinketh of that cuppe vnworthilie / to bee giltie of the Lordes death / and to eate and drinke his owne damnation / because he estemeth not the Lordes bodie. All do graūte that these wordes of S Paule when he saith (if we eate it auantageth vs nothing / or if wee eate not / wee want nothing therby) are not spoken of the Lordes table / but of other commen meates.1. Cor. 8.
            
            Thus then hitherto yet we all agree. But nowe lette vs see wherin the dissention doeth stande. The vnderstanding of that wherin it doth chieflie stand is a steppe to the true searching furth of the trueth. For who can seeke well a remedie / if he knowe not before the disease?
            It is neither to be denied nor dissembled / that in the matter of this Sacramente there bee diuerse pointes / wherein men counted to be learned canne not agree.
                  The chieffe pointes off controuersie abovute the sacramēt.
                As whether there be any transubstantiation of the breade or no? Any corporall and carnal presence of Christes substance or no? Whether adoracion onely due vnto God / is to be done to the sacramente or noe? And whether Christes bodie bee

be there offered in deede vnto the heauenlye father by the prieste or noe? Or whether the euell man receiue the naturall bodie of Christe or noe?
            Yet neuerthelesse as in a man diseased in diuers partes / commenlie the originall cause of suche diuers diseases whiche are spredde abrode in the bodie do come from some one chiefe membre / as from the stomacke or from the heade: euen so al those fiue aforesaide pointes do chiefely hange vpon this one question / whiche is / what is the matter of the Sacramente / whether is it the naturall substance of breade / or the naturall substance of Christes owne bodie.
            The treuth of this question truelye tried out and agreed vpon / no doubte shall cease the controuersie in all the reaste. For if it bee Christes owne naturall bodie / borne of the virgine / then assuredlie (seynge that all learned men in Englande / (so farre as I knowe) both newe and olde / graunt there to be but one substance / then I say / they must nedes graunt Transubstantiation / that is a change of the substance of breade into the substance of Christes bodie: then also they must graunt the carnall and corporall presence of Christes bodie: then must the sacramēt be adored with the honour due vnto Christ himselfe / for the vnitie of the two natures in one person: then if the prieste do offre the sacrament / he doeth offre in deede Christ himselfe: and finallye the murtherer / the adulterer / or wicked mā / receiuinge the Sacrament / must needes there receiue also the

naturall substaunce of Christes owne blessed bodye / both / fleash and bloude.
            Nowe on the other syde / if after the truthe shalbe truly tryed owte / it be fownd / that the substance of breade / is the materiall substance of the sacrament (althowgh for the chaunge of the vse / office / and dignitie of the bread / the bread in dede sacramentally is chaunged into the bodye of Christ / as the water in Baptisme is sacramentally chaunged into the fountayne of regeneracion / and yet the materiall substance therof remayneth all one as was before) yf (I saye) the trewe solutyon of that former question / wheruppon all these controuersies doo hange / be / that the naturall substāce of bread / is the materiall substance in the holie sacrament of Christes blessed bodye: then must it followe of that former proposition confessed of all that be named to be learned / (so farre as I knowe) in Englande / whiche is / that there is but one materiall substāce in the sacramente of the bodie / and one onelye lykewise in the sacrament of the bloud: that there is no such thing in deede / and in truth / as they call transubstantion (for the substance of breade remaineth styll in the sacrament of the bodie) then also the naturall substance of Christes humane nature which he tooke of the virgine Marie is in heauen / where it reigneth now in glory / and not here inclosed vnder the forme of breade: then that godlie honoure whiche is due vnto God the creator / and maye not

be done to the creature / without Idolatrie and sacrilege / is not be done to the holie Sacramēt / then also the wicked (I meane) the impenitent murtherer / adulterer / or suche like do not receiue the naturall substāce of the blissed body and bloud of Christ: finallie then doth folow that Christes blissed bodie and bloud which was once onely offered / and shed vpon the crosse / beinge auailable for the synnes of all the worlde / is offered vp no more in the natural substaunce therof / neither by the prieste nor anie other thinge.
            But here before we goe any further to searche in this matter and to wade (as it were) to searche and trie oute (as we maie) the trueth therof in the scripture / it shall do well by the way to knowe / whether they that thus make aunswere and solution to the former principall question / doe take awaye simplye and absolutlye the presence of Christes bodie and bloud / from the sacrament ordeined by Christ / and duely ministred according to his holye ordinances and institution of the same.
            Vndoutedlye they do denie that vtterly / either 
                  〈◊〉
                to saie / or to meane the same. And therof / if any 
                  〈◊〉
                doe or will doubte / the bookes whiche are written alreadye in this matter of them that thus doe answeare / will make the matter plaine.
            Nowe then you will saie / what kinde of presence

do they graunt / and what do they denie?
                  Vuhat kī
                     de of presence is to be graunted in the lordes supper.
                Briefelye they denie the presence of Christes bodye in the naturall substance of his humaine and assumpte nature / and graunt the presence of the same by grace. That is / they affirme and saie / that the substance of the naturall bodie and bloud of Christ / is onelie remainynge in heauen / and so shall be vntill the latter daie when he shal come againe in glorie accompained with the angelles of heauen / 
                  Matt. 24▪
                to iudge both the quicke and the deade: And the same naturall substance of the verie bodie and bloude of Christe / because it is vnited to the diuine nature in Christe / the seconde person of the Trinitie / therfore it hath not onelye life in it selfe / but it is also able and doth
                  Ioan. 6. geue life vnto so manie as bee or shall be partakers thereof / that is / that to all that doo beeleue on his
                  Ioan. 1. name / which are not born of bloud (as Iohn saith) or of the will of the fleshe / or of the will of man / but are borne of God / though the selfe same substance abide still in heauen / and they for the tyme of their pilgremage dwell here vpon the earth / by grace I saie / that is by the life mētioned in Ihon / 
                  Ioan. 6. and the properties of the same / meete for oure pilgremage here vpon earth / the same bodie of Christe is here presente with vs: Euē as for example wee saie / the Sunne whiche in substaunce neuer remoueth hys place out of the heauens / is yet presente here by his beames / light / and natural influence / where it shineth vpon the earth. For gods worde and his Sacraments be as it were the beames of Christ which
                  Malach. 4
               
is Sol Iustiticie / The Sunne of righteousenes.
            Thus thou haste hearde of what sorte or secte soeuer thou be wherin doth stande the principall state and chiefe pointe of all the cōtrouersies whiche doe properlie perteine vnto the nature of this Sacrament: As for the vse therof I graunt ther be many other thinges wherof here I haue spoken nothing.
            And now leste thou iustly maist complaine / and saie that I haue in openinge of this matter doone nothing els but digged a pitte / and haue not shutt it vp againe / or broken a gap / and haue not made it vp / or opened the booke and haue not closed it againe / or elles to call me what thou listest / as Newtrall / Dissembler / or what soeuer els thy luste and learning shall serue thee to name me worse: Therfore here nowe I will by Goddes grace not onlye shortly / but also so clearely and plainelie as I can / make the nowe to knowe whether of the foresaide two aunsweres to the former principall state and chief pointe doth like me beste. Yea and also I will holde all those accursed whiche in this matter that nowe soe troubleth the churche of Christe / haue of God receiued the Keye of knowledge / and yet goe about to shutte vp the doores / so that they them selues will not entre in / nor suffre other that woulde
            And as for myne owne parte I considre / boeth of late what charge and cure of soule hath been cō
               mitted

to me wherof God knoweth howe soone I shall be called to geue an accoumpt / and also nowe in thys worlde what peryll and daunger of the lawes concerning my life I am now in at this presente time / what folye were it then for me nowe to dissemble with God of whome assuredlye / I loke / and hope / by Christ / to haue euerlasting life. Seing that suche charge and daunger both before God and manne do compasse me in rounde aboute on euery side / therfore God willing I will franklye and freelye vtter my minde. And thoughe my bodie be captiue / yet my tounge / and my penne / as longe as I maie / shall freelye set furth that whiche vndoubtedlye I am perswaded to bee the trueth of Gods worde. And yet I will doe it vnder this protestation / call me a protestante who liste / 
                  A protestation.
                I doe not passe therof: My protestation shall be this that my minde is / ād euer shalbe (God willing) to set furth syncerlye the true sense and meaning to the beste of myne vnderstanding / of Gods most holye worde / and not to decline from the same / either for feare of worldly danger / or els for hope of gaine. I do protest also dew obedience / and submission of my iudgment in this my writing / and in all other mine affaires / vnto those of Christes churche whiche bee truelye learned in Gods holye worde / gathered in Christes name and guided by his spirite.
                  An ansvvere to the cheefe question▪
                  
                After this protestation I doe plainelye affirme and saie / that the seconde aunsweare made to the chiefe question and principal pointe I am perswaded to be the verye

true meaning and sense of Gods holie worde: That is / that the natural substaunce of breade and wine / is the true materiall substaunce of the holie sacramente of the blissed bodie and bloude of oure sauioure Christe.
            And the places of scripture wherupon this my faithe is grownded / be theis / both concernyng the Sacrament of the bodye / and also of the bloud.
            Fyrst lett vs repete the begynning of the institution of the Lordes supper wherin all the three Euā
               gelistes and S. Paule almost in wordes do agree / sayng that Ihesus tooke bread / gaue thankes / brake / and gaue it to the Disciples sayng / take eate / This is my bodye.
                  Christe calleth verie breade his bodie.
                Here it appereth plainlye / that Christ calleth verye bread his bodye. For that which he tooke was very bread (in this all mē doo agre) and that which he tooke / after he had gyuen thankes / he brake / and that which he tooke and brake / he gaue it to his disciples: and that whiche he tooke brake / and gaue to his disciples / he sayd hym self of it: This is my bodye. So it appeareth plainlye that Christ called verye bread his bodye. But very bread can not be his bodye in verye substāce therof / therfore it muste nedes haue an other meanyng / whiche meanyng appeareth plainlye what it is / by the nexte sentence that followeth immediatlie both in Luke and in Paule / and that is this / 
                  Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 11. Doo this in remēbraūce of me: wher vppon

it seameth vnto me to be euidēt / that Christ dyd take bread / and called yt his bodye / for that he wold institute therby / a perpetuall remembraunce of his bodye / specially of that singular benefyte of our redemptyon / whiche he wold then procure and purchase vnto vs by his bodye / vppon the crosse. But bread retayning still his owne very naturall substance / maye be thus by grace / and in a sacramentall signification his bodye / wheras elles / the verie bread which he tooke / brake / and gaue them / could not be in any wise his naturall bodye / for that were confusyon of substances. And therfore the verye wordes of Christ ioyned with the nexte sentence following / bothe enforceth vs to confesse the verye bread to remayn still / and also openeth vnto vs howe that bread maye be / and is thus by his diuine power / hys bodye which was giuen for vs. But here I remembre I haue redde in soome writers of the contrarie opinion / 
                  An obiection.
                whiche doo denye / that that whiche Christ dyd take / he brake. For (saie they) after his taking he blessed it / as Marcke doth speke / 
                  Marc. 14. ād by his blessing he chaunged the naturall substance of the bread into the naturall substance of his bodye: and so althowgh he tooke the bread and blessed it / yet because in blessing he chaunged the substance of it / he brake not the bread which then was not ther / but onely the forme therof.
            Vnto this obiection I haue ij. playne answers / 
                  Ansvuer.
               
               
boeth grounded vpon Godds woorde. Thone I wyll here reherse / thother aunsweare I will differ vntill I speake of the Sacrament of the bloude.
            Mine aunsweare here is taken out of the plaine wordes of S Paule / whiche doth manifestlie confound this phantastical inuention / first inuented (I wene) of Pope Innocentius / and after confirmed by the subtill sophister Dunse / and latelye renued nowe in our daies with an eloquent stile and muche finesse of witte.
                  It is mente of a booke firste sette forth vnder the name of M. Antonius Constantius. And after vuard of Ste▪ Gard. Bishop of Vuinch.
                But what can crafty inuention / subtiltie in sophismes / eloquence or finesse of witte preuaile against the infallible worde of god.
            What nede we to striue / and contēd / what thing we breake / for Paule saith speking vndoubtedlie of the Lordes table / the breade (saieth he) whiche wee breake / is it not the partakinge or felowshyp of the Lordes bodie? Wherupō it foloweth that after the thankes geuing / it is bread whiche we breake. And how often in the Acts of the Apostles is the Lords supper signified by breakinge of breade. They did perseuer (saieth S Luke) in the Apostles doctrine / communion / and breakyng of breade.
                  Act. 2. ibidem
                And againe they brake breade in euerie house.
            And againe in an other place. When they were come together to breake breade.
                  Act. 20. S Paule whiche setteth forth moste fullye in his writing / boeth the doctrine and the vse of the Lordes supper / and the

sacramentall eatynge / 1. Cor. 10.11. and drynkinge of Christes bodie / and bloude / calleth it fiue tymes / breade / breade / breade / breade / breade.
            The sacramentall breade is the misticall bodye / 
                  The 2 reason.
                and so is called in scripture / 1 Cor. 10. as it is called the naturall bodye of Christe: But Christes misticall bodye is the congregacion of Christians.1. Cor. 10. Now no manne was euer so fonde / as to saye that that sacramentall bread is transubstantiated and changed into the substaunce of the congregatiō. Wherfore no manne shoulde lykewise thynke or saie that the breade is transubstantiated / and chaunged into the naturall substaunce of Christes humaine nature.
            But my mynde is not here to wryte what maye bee gathered oute of scriptures for this purpose / but onelye to wryte here briefelye those whyche seeme to me to be the mooste playne places. Therfore contented to haue spoken thus muche of the sacramentall breade / nowe I wyll speake a litle of the Lordes cuppe.
            And this shalbe my thirde argument grounded vpon Christes owne woordes.
                  The. 3. argument.
                The naturall substance of the sacramentall wine remaineth stil / and is the materiall substance of the sacramente of the bloude of Christe / therfore it is likewise so in the sacramentall bread. I knowe that he that is of a contrarie

opinion will denie the former parte of my argumente. But I will proue it thus / by the plaine wordes of Christe himselfe:
                  Matt. 26. Mar. 14. both in Mathewe and in Marke Christes wordes be thus / after the wordes saide vpon the cuppe. I saye vnto you (saieth Christe) I will not drinke henseforth of this fruite of the vine tree / vntill I shall drinke that newe in my fathers kingedome. Here note / how Christ calleth plainelye his cuppe the fruite of the vine tree / but the fruite of the vine tree is very natural wine / wherfore the naturall substance of the wine / doeth remaine still in the sacramente of Christes bloude.
            And here in spekinge of the Lordes cup / it commeth vnto my remembrance / the vanitye of Innocentius / his phantasticall inuention / whiche by Paules wordes I did confute before / and here did promise somewhat more to speake / and that is this Yf the Transubstantiacion be made by this worde (blissed) in Marke saide vpon the bread / as Innocentius that Pope did saie / then suerlie seing that worde is not saide of Christe / neither in any of the Euangelistes / nor in Paule / vpon the cuppe / there is no Transubstantiation of the wine at all / for where the cause doth faile there can not folow the effecte. But the sacramentall breade / and the sacramentall wine do both remaine in their naturall substance alike / and if the one be not changed / as of the sacramētall wine / it appeareth euidentlye then there is noe suche Transubstantiation in neither of

them boeth / All that put and afferme this change of the substaunce of breade and wine into the substance of Christes body / and bloud (called transubstantiation) doe also saie / and affirme / this change to be made by a certaine forme of prescript wordes and none other / but what they bee that make the chaunge either of the one or of the other / vndoubtedlye euen they that do write moste finelie in these oure daies / almoste confesse plainelie / 
                  Vuinch. in the ansvuer to the 48. obiection.
                that they can not tell. For although they graunt to certaine of the olde Soctours / as Chrisostome / ād Ambrose / that these wordes (This is my bodie) are the wordes of Consecration of the sacrament of the bodie / yet saie they / these wordes maie well bee so called because they doe assure vs of the Consecration therof / whether it be done before these wordes be spoken or no. But as for this their doubte concerning the sacrament of the bodie I let it passe.
            Let vs now consider the wordes which pertaine vnto the cuppe / This is firste euident that as Mathewe muche agreeth with Marke / and likewise Luke with Paul doth much agree herein in forme of woordes: so in the same / the forme of wordes in Mathewe and Marke is diuerse from that which is in Luke and Paule. The old Authors doo most reherse the fourme of wordes in Matthew / and Marke / because (I wene) they semed to them most cleare. But here I wold knowe / whether it is credible or no / that Luke / and Paule / when they celebrated the Lordes supper whith their congregations

/ that they didde not vse the same forme of woordes at the Lordes table whiche they wrotte / Luke in hys Gospell / and Paule in his Epistell.
            Of Luke because he was a Phisition / whether some will graunt that he mighte be a Priest or no / and was able to receiue the order of Priesthode which (they say) is geuen by vertue of these words / said by the Byshoppe (take thou autoritie to sacrifice for the quick and the dead) I can not tel.
                  Vuith vuhat vuordes, the popish priestehod is geuen.
                But if they shoulde be so straite vpon Luke / either for his craft or els for lacke of suche power geuen hym by vertue of the aforesaide wordes / then I wene both Peter and Paul are in danger to be deposed of their priestehode for the crafte / either of fishing / whiche was Peters / 
                  Peter, and Paule, vuere no priestes of the popish order.
                or of makīg tēts / which was Pauls / were more vile then the scyence of phisike. And as for those sacramentall wordes of the order of priesthod / to haue authoritye to sacrifyce both for the quicke and the dead / I wene Peter and Paule / if they were both a liue were not able to proue that euer Christ gaue them suche authoritye / or euer sayd any such wordes vnto them. But I will lett Luke go. And because Paule speketh more playnely for hym self I will reherse his wordes.
            That (sayth Paule) whiche I receaued of the Lorde I gaue vnto yow:1. Cor. 11. for the Lord Ihesus &c. And so he setteth fourthe the whole instituciō and right vse of the Lordes supper. Nowe seing that Paule here saythe / that which he receiued of the

Lord / he had geuen them / and that which he had receiued / and geuen them before by word of mowthe / nowe he reherseth and writeth the same in his epistle / ys it credible that Paule wold neuer vse this fourme of wordes vppon the Lordes cuppe / whiche (as he saithe) he receiued of the Lord / that he had geuen them before / and nowe reherseth in his epistle? I trust no man is so far from all reason butt he will grawnt me that this is not likelye so to be. Nowe then if yow graunte me that Paule dyd vse the forme of wordes whiche he writeth / let vs thē reherse and cōsyder Paules wordes / which he saithe Christ spake thus vppon the cuppe: This cupp is the newe testament in my bloud / this doo as often as ye shall drinke it in the remembraunce of me.
            Here I wold knowe whether that Christes wordes spoken vppon the cupp were not as mightye in worke / and as effectuall in signification to all ententes / constructions / and purposes (as our parlyamēt men doo speke) as they were spoken vppon the bread? Yf this be grawnted / which thinge I thinke no man can denye / then further I reason thus: But the worde (ys) in the wordes spoken vppon the Lordes bread / doth mightelye signefye (saye they) the chaunge of the substance of that which goeth before yt / into the substance of that which followeth after / that is / of the substance of bread into the substance of Christes bodye / when Chryst sayeth / This is my bodye / Nowe

thē if Christes wordes whiche be spokē vppon the cupp / whiche Paule here reherseth / be of the same might and power / both in working / and signefyinge / then must this word (ys) when Christ saith / This cuppe is the newe testamēt / &c. turne the substance of the cuppe into the substance of the newe testament.
            And if thow willt saye that this word (ys) neither maketh nor signefieth any suche chaunge of the cuppe / althowgh it be sayd of Christ / that this cuppe is the newe testament / yet Christ ment no suche chaunge / as that: Mary syr euen so saye I / when Christ sayd of the bread which he tooke / and after thankes geuen brake / and gaue them sayinge take / eate / This is my bodie: he meant no more any suche chaunge of the substance of bread / into the substance of his naturall bodye / then he meant of the chaunge and transubstantiacion of the cuppe / into the substance of the newe testament. And if thow wilt saye / that the worde (cuppe) her in Christes wordes doth not signefye the cuppe it self / but the wyne / or thinge conteyned in the cupp / by a figure called Metonymia / for that Christes wordes meant / and so must nedes be taken / thow sayest verye well. But I praye the by the waye here note two thinges / fyrst that this word (ys) hath no such strength or signification in the Lordes wordes to make or to signifie any transubstantiacion:2. necessarie Notes.
                secondly that in the Lordes wordes wherby he instituted

the sacramente of his bloude / he vseth a figuratiue speache. Howe vaine then is it that some soe earnestlye do saie / as it were an infallible rule / that in doctrine / and in thinstitution of the sacraments Christ vseth no figures / but all his words are to be streined to their proper significations: when as here / what soeuer thou saieste / was in the cuppe / yet neither that nor the cuppe it selfe was (taking euerie woorde in his proper signification) the newe testament: But in vnderstanding that which was in the cuppe / by the cup / that is a figuratiue spech. Yea and also thou canste not verifie or truely saie of that (whether thou saiste it was wine / or Christes bloude) to bee the new testament / without a figure also: Thus in one sentence spoken of Christe in the institution of the sacrament of his bloude / the fygure muste helpe vs twise. So vntrue is it that some doe write / that Christe vseth no figure in the doctrine of faith / nor in the institution of his sacramentes. But some saie if we shall thus admitte figures in doctrine / then shall all the articles of our faieth by figures and allegories / shortlye be transformed and vnloused. I saie it is like fault / and euē the same / to denie the figure where the place soe requireth to be vnderstanded / as vainelye to make it a figuratiue speche / whiche is to be vnderstanded in his proper signification.
            The rules wherby the speche is knowen when it is figuratiue / and wherby it is none / 
                  Augu. de doc. Chri. l. 3. cap. 16. S Austine in

his booke called de doctrina Christiana / geueth diuerse learned lessons verie necessari to be knowē of the studente in Gods worde. Of the whiche one I will reherse / which is this: Yf (saieth he) the scripture doeth seame to commaund a thinge whiche is wicked or vngodly: Or to forbidde a thing that charitie doeth require / then knowe thou (saith he) that the spech is figuratiue. And for example he bringeth the saiyng of Christ in the 6 Chapter of Sainct Ihon. Except ye eate the fleash of the sonne of man and drinke his bloud / ye canne not haue life in you▪ It seameth to commaund a wicked or an vngodlye thing / wherfore it is a figuratiue speache / commaundinge to haue communion and felowshippe with Christes passion / and deuoutelye and wholesomelie to laie vp in memorie / that his fleashe was crucified and wounded for vs.
            And here I can not but maruaile at some men / suerelye of muche excellente finesse of witte / 
                  Vuinch. in his ansvuers to the 16. and 226. obiection.
                and of greate eloquēce / that are not ashamed to write and saie that this aforesaide saiynge of Christe is (after Saint Austen) a figuratiue speach in dede / but not vnto the learned / but vnto the vnlearned / here lette any man that indifferently vnderstandeth the lattē tounge / reade the place in S Austen / and if he per / ceiue not clearlye S Austens woordes and minde to be contrarie / let me abide therof the rebuke.
            This lesson of S Austen I haue therfore the rather

sette forth / because as it teacheth vs to vnderstande that place in Ihon figuratiuelye / euen soe suerlye the same lesson with the example of S Austens exposition therof teacheth vs / not only by the same to vnderstande Christes wordes in the institution of the Sacrament both of his bodie / and of his bloud figuratiuelye / but also the very true mening and vnderstanding of the same. For if to commaund to eate the fleashe of the sonne of man / and to drinke his bloude / semeth to commaunde an inconuenience / and an vngodlines / and is euen so in dede / if it be vnderstanded as the wordes do stand in their proper signification / and therfore muste be vnderstanded figuratiuely and spirituallye / as S Augustin doth godlie / and learnedlie interpretate them: Then suerlie / Christe commaundinge in his last supper to eate his body / and to drīke his bloud / semeth to commaund in sound of words / as great and euen the same inconuenience and vngodlines as did his woordes in the 6. Chapiter of S. Ihon / and therfore muste euen by the same reason be likewise vnderstanded and expounded figuratiuelye and spirituallie / as S Austin did the other. Wherunto that exposition of S Austen maie seame to be the more mete / for that Christe in his supper / to the commaundement of eatinge and drinkinge of his bodie / and bloud / addeth / do this in remembrance of me / whiche wordes suerlye were the keye that opened and reueled this spirituall and godlye exposition vnto S Austen.
            
               But I haue taried longer in settinge fourth the forme of Christes woordes vpon the Lordes cuppe written by Paule and Luke then I intended to do. And yet in speaking of the forme of Christs wordes spoken vpon his cuppe / it commeth now vnto my remembraunce the forme of wordes vsed in the lattin Masse vpon the Lordes cuppe: Wherof I doe not a litle maruaile what should be the cause / seing the latten Masse agreeth with the Euangelistes and Paule in the forme of woordes saied vpon the breade / 
                  Vuordes of the latin Masse.
                why in the wordes saiede vpon the Lordes cup / it differeth from them all: yea and addeth vnto the wordes of Christe spoken vpon the cuppe / these woordes / Misterium fidei / that is / the Misterie of faith / which are not redde to be attributed vnto the sacrament of Christes bloud / neither in theuangelistes nor in Paule / nor so farre as I do knowe in anie other place of holie scripture / yea and if it maie haue some good exposition / yet why it shoulde not be aswell added vnto the wordes of Christe▪ vpon his breade as vpon his cuppe / suerlie I doe not see the misterie.
            And because I se in the vse of the lattin Masse / the sacrament of the bloud abused / when it is denied to the laie men / 
                  The abuse of the sacramente in he latin Masse.
                cleane contrarie to gods moste certaine worde: For why I beseche the shoulde the sacramente of Christes bloude / be denied vnto the laye Christian / more then to the priest? dyd not Christ shead his bloude aswell for the laye godlye

man / as for the godlye preste? yf thow wilt saye / yeas / that he dyd so / but yet the sacrament of the bloud is not to be receyued with owt the offering vpp and sacrifycing therof vnto god the father / both for the quicke / and for the dead / and no man maye make oblatyon of Christes bloude vnto god / but a priest / and therfore the priest / and that but in his masse onelie / maye receiue the sacrament of the bloud. And call ye this (maisters) mysterium fidei? alas / alas / I feare me this is before god / mysteriū iniquitatis the mysterie off iniquitee / such as saint Paule speketh of in his epistle to the Thessaloniās.2. Thess. 2 Psal. 67. The lord be mercifull vnto vs / and blesse vs / lighten his cowntenaunce vppon vs / and be mercifull vnto vs. That we maye knowe thy waye vppon earth / and among all people thy saluation. This kind of oblation standeth vppon transubstantyacion his germayne coosyn / and doo growe both vppon one grownd / the lord weede it owt of his vyneyard shortlie (if it be his blessed will and pleasure) that bitter roote.
            To speke of this oblation howe muche it is iniuryous vnto Christes passion / 
                  The Masse sacrifice is iniuriouse to Christespassiō.
                howe it can not but with high blasphemie / and hainous arrogancie / and intollerable pride be claymed of any mā / other then of Christ him self / how much / and how plainly it repugneth vnto the manyfest wordes / the trewe sense and meanyng of holye scripture in many places / especially in thepistle to the Hebrues:
                  Hebr. 9.10. The

matter is soe longe and other haue written in it at large / that my mind is now not to entreat therof any further. For only in this my scribling I intended to searche out and set furth by the scriptures / according to gods gratious gift of my poore knowledge whether the true sense and meaninge of Christes wordes in the institution of his holy supper / do require anye transubstantiation (as they call it) or that the verye substaunce of bread and wine doe remayne styll in the Lordes supper / and be the materiall substaunce of the holye sacramente of Christe oure sauioures Blissed bodie and bloude.
            Yet there remaineth one vaine Quiddite of Duns in this matter / the which because some that write nowe do seme to like it so well / 
                  Vuīch. in the aunsvuere to the 15 obiection.
                that they haue strypped hym oute of Dunses dustie and darcke termes / and pricked him and painted him in freshe colores of an eloquente stile / may therfore deceiue the more excepte the error be warely escheued.
            Dunse saith in these wordes of Christ / this is my body / this pronoune demonstratiue / meaning the worde (this) if ye will know what it doth shewe or demonstrate / whether the bread that Christ toke or no: he answereth no / but only one thing in substāce it pointeth / wherof the nature or name it doeth not tell / but leaueth that to be determined and tolde by that which foloweth the word (is) that is by predicatum / as the Logician doeth speake / and therfore

he calleth this pronowne demonstratiue (this) indiuiduum vagum / that is a wanderynge proper name / whereby we maie pointe out and shewe any one thing in substance / what thing soeuer it be.
            That this imagination is vaine and vntruly applied vnto those wordes of Christ (this is my body) it maie appeare plainly by the wordes of Luke / and Paul / saide vpon the cup / conferred with the forme of wordes spoken vpon the cuppe in Mathew and Marke / for as vpon the bread it is saide of all / this is my bodie / so of Mathewe and Marke is saide of the cup / this is my bloud. Then if in the wordes This is my bodye / the woorde (this) be as Dunse calleth it a wanderynge name / to appointe and shewe furthe anye one thinge whereof the name or nature it doeth not tell: so muste it bee lykewyse in those woordes of Mathewe and Marke vpon the Lordes cup / This is my bloud. But in the wordes of Mathewe and Marke / it signifieth / and pointeth out the same / that it doth in the lordes wordes vpon the cuppe in Luke / and Paule / where it is saide: This cuppe is the newe testamente in my bloude / &c· Therefore in Mathewe and Marke / the pronowne demonstratiue (this) doeth not wander to poynte onelie one thynge in substaunce / not shewyng what it is / but telleth it plainelie what it is / no lesse in Mathewe and Marke to the eye / then is done in Luke and Paul / by putting to this word (cuppe) boeth vnto the eye / and vnto the eare▪
            
            
               For taking the cuppe and demonstrating or shewing it vnto his disciples by this pronowne demonstratiue (this) and sayng vnto them: drynk ye all of this / it was then all one to saye / This is my bloud: as to say. This cupp is my bloud: meaning by the cuppe as the nature of the spech doth require the thing cōteyned in the cupp: so likewise withowt all dowbte when Christ had taken bread / geuen thankes / and broken it / and geuing it to his disciples / sayd / Take / and so demonstrating and shewing that bread which he had in his handes / to saye then. This is my bodye / and to haue sayd this bread is my bodye. As it were all one if a man lacking a knyffe and going to his oysters wold saye to another / whom he sawe to haue ij. knyfes. Syr I praye yow lend me thone of your knyfes: were it not nowe all one to answer him / Syr hold I will lende yow this to eate your meate / but not to open oysters with all: ād hold I will lend yow this knyf to eate your meate / but not to open oysters. This similitud serueth but for this purpose / to declare the nature of spech whithall / wher as the thing that is demonstrated and shewed / is euidētly perceaued / and openly knowen vnto the eye. But o good Lord what a wonderfull thing is it to see / howe soome 
                  Vuinch. in the ansvuer to the 13 obiectiō
                  
               men doo labour to teache / what is demonstrated and shewed by the pronowne demōstratiue (this) in Christes wordes / when he saith / This is my bodie / this is my bloud / howe they labour I saye to teache what that (this) was then in dede / when

Christ spake in the beginning of the sentence / the word (this) before he had pronownced the rest of the wordes that followed in the same sentence / so that their doctrine maye agree with their transubstantiation which in dede is the verye foundacion / wherin all their erroneous doctrine doth stand.
            And here the transubstantiators doo not agree amongest them selfes / 
                  The papistes them selfes doo not agree.
                no more then they doo in the wordes which wrought the transubstātiacion when Christ did first institute his sacrament. Wherin Innocentius Bisshopp of Rome of the latter dayes and Duns (as was noted before) do attribute the worke vnto the word (benedixit / blessed) But the rest for the most part to (Hoc est corpus meum / This is my bodye) &c. Dunse therfore with his secte because he putteth the chaunge before / must nedes saye that (this) when Christ spake it in the beginning of the sentēce was in dede Christes bodye. For in the chaunge the substance of bread did departe / and the chaunge was nowe doone in (benedixit sayth he) that went before. And therfore after him and his / that (this) was then in dede Christes bodye / thowgh the word did not import so muche / but onely one thing in substance / which substāce after Duns / the breade being gone / must nedes be the substance of Christes bodye.
            But they that putt their transubstantiacion to be wrought by these wordes of Christ / This is my bodye / and doo saye that when the hole sentence

was finished / then this chaunge was perfected / and not before / they can not saie / but yet Christes (this) in the beginninge of the sentence / before the other wordes were fully pronoūced / was breade in deede: For as yet the change was not done / and soe longe the bread must nedes remainer and so longe as the substance of the bread doth remaine / so long with the vniuersal consent of al trāsubstantiators / the natural substance of Christes body cānot come and therfore muste their (this) of necessitie demonstrate and shew the substance which was as yet in the pronouncing of the first worde (this) by Christ / but breade.
            But how cā they make and verifie Christs words to bee true / demostrating the substance / whiche in the demonstration is but breade / and saie therof: This is my bodie / that is as they saie / the naturall substance of Christes bodie except they wolude saie that the verbe (is) signifieth / is made / or is chāged into / and so thē if the same verbe (is) be of the same effecte in Christes wordes / spoken vpon the cuppe / and rehearsed by Luke and Paule / the cuppe or the wine in the cuppe / must be made or turned into the newe testament / as was declared before.
            
               
                  Vuinch. is become a Neutrall.
               There bee some amonge the transubstantiators whiche walke soe wilely and soe warely / betwixte these ij. aforesaide opinions / allowinge them both and holding plainelye neither of them boeth / that

me thinke they maie be called Neutrals Ambidexters / or rather suche as canne shifte on boeth sides. They plaie on boeth partes: for with the latter they doe allowe the doctrine of the laste sillable / whiche is that transubstantiation is done by miracle / in an instante / at the sound of the laste sillable (um) in this sentēce / hoc est corpus meum: And they do alow Dunses phantastical imaginacion of indiuiduū vagum / that demonstrateth (as he teacheth) in Christes wordes / one thing in substaunce / then beinge (after his mynde) the substaunce of the bodie of Christe.
            A marueilous thing howe anye manne can agree with both these two / they beynge soe contrarie the one vnto the other / for the one saieth the woorde (this) demonstrateth the substaunce of breade / and the other saith no not soe. The breade is gone / and it demonstrateth a substaunce whiche is Christs bodye. Tushe sayeth thys thyrd man.
                  Vuinch in the ansvuere to the 84 obiection
                Ye vnderstand nothing at all they agree well inough in the chiefe poynte / whiche is the grounde of all / that is boeth doe agree and beare witnesse / that there is transubstanciation. They doe agree in deede in that conclusion I graunt / but their profes and doctrine thereof doe euen aswell agree together / as dydde the false witnesses before Annas and Caiphas againste Christe / or the twoo wicked iudges againste Susanna. For againste Christe the false witnesse did agree no (doubte)

to speake all againste him: And the wicked iudges were both agreed to cōdemne poore Susanna / but in exāinatiō of their witnesses / thei dissented so far / that al was found false that they went about / both that wherein they agreed / and also those thinges whiche they brought for their proofes.
            Thus muche haue I spoken in searchyng oute a solution for this principall question / whiche was / what is the materiall substaunce of the holy sacramente in the Lordes supper.
            
               
                  The consente of the olde Authours.
               Nowe leste I should seame to sette by my owne conceite more then is meete / or lesse to regarde the doctrine of the olde Ecclesiasticall writers / then is conuenient for a manne of my poore learning / and simple witte for to dooe: And because also I am in dede perswaded that the olde ecclesiastical writers vnderstode the true meaning of Christ in this matter / and haue both so truely / and so plainly / sette it forth in certaine places of their writinges / that no man which wil vouchsase to read them / and withoute preiudice of a corrupte iudgement will indifferently wey them / and construe their mindes none other wise / then they declare them selfe to haue meant / I am perswaded I saye that in reding of them thus / no mā can be ignorant in this matter / but he that will shutt vpp his owne eies and blind feld hym self.
            
               When I speake of ecclesiastical writers / I meane of such / as were before the wicked vsurpatiō of the Sea of Rome was growē so vnmeasurablie greate / that not onely with tyrannicall power / but also with corrupt doctrine / yt beganne to subuerte Christes gospell / and to turne the state that Christ and his Apostles sett in the church / vpside downe.
            For the causes afore sayd I will reherse certayne of their sainges / and yet because I take them but for wytnesses and expownders of this doctrine / and not as the Authors of the same: and also for that nowe I will not be tedyous / I will reherse but fewe / that is / three olde wryters of the Greke churche / and other three of the latine church / which do seeme vnto me to be in this matter / most plain.
            The Greke authours are Origen / Chrysostome and Theodoret / The Lattin / are Tertullian / S. Austin / and Gelasius.
            I knowe there can be nothing spoken so plainly / but the craftye wit furnished with Eloquence can darcken it / and wrest it quite frō the true meaning / to a contrarie sense: And I knowe also that eloquence / crafte and finesse of witte / hath gone about to bleare mens eyes / and to stoppe their eares in the afore named writers / that menne shoulde neither heare nor see / what those authoures boeth write and teache soe plainelye / that excepte menne should be made both starke blinde / and deafe / they

can not but of necessitie if they will reade and weye them indifferentelye boeth heare and see what they doe meane / when eloquence / crafte / and finesse of witte / haue done all that they canne. Now lette vs heare the olde writers of the greke churche.

               Origene / who liued aboue twelue hundreth and fiftie yeares ago / a manne for thexcellencie of his learning so highlie estemed in Christes church / that he was counted and was iudged the singuler teacher in his time of Christes religion / the confounder of heresies / the scolemaster of many godly martyres / and an opener of the high misteries in scripture:
                  Eccl. Hist. lib. 6, cap 3. he writinge vpon the 15 Chapter of S Mathewes gospell / saieth thus.
            But if any thing entre into the mouth / it goth awai into the belly / and is auoided into the draught yea and that meate which is santified by the word of god and praier / 
                  Orig. in 15. Matth.
                concerning the matter thereof it goeth awaie into the bellye and is auoided into the draught / but for the praier which is added vnto it / for the proportion of the faith / it is made profitable makinge the minde able to perceiue and see that whiche is profitable. For it is not the materiall substaunce of breade but the worde whiche is spoken vpon it / that is profitable to the man that eateth it not vnworthelye. And this I meane of the typicall and Symbolicall (that is) sacramentall bodie.
            
               Thus farre goeth the wordes of Origene / where it is plaine firste that Origene speaking there of the sacrament of the Lordes supper / as the last words doe plainelye sygnifie / doeth meane and teache that the materiall substaunce thereof / is receiued / digested / and auoided as the materiall substaunce of other breade / and meates is / whiche coulde not bee / if there were no materiall substaunce of bread at all / as the phantasticall opinion of transubstantiation doeth put.
            It is a worlde to see the aunsweare of the papystes to thys place of Origene.
                  The disputations in the perlamente house and in the Vniuersities.
                In the disputations whiche were in this matter in the Parlament house / and in boeth the vniuersities of Camebridge and Oxforde / they that defended transubstanciation / saied that this parte of Origene / was but sette furth of late By Erasmus and therefore is to be suspected.
            But howe vaine this their aunswere is / it appeareth plainely: for so maie all the good olde authours whiche laie in olde libraries / and are sette fourth of late / bee by this reason reiected / as Clemens / Alexandrinus / Theodoretus / Iustinus / ecclesiastica Historia Nicephori / and other suche.
            Another answere they had saiyng that Origene is noted to haue erred in some pointes / and therefore faith is not to be geuen in this matter to hym.
            
               But this aunswear well weighed doth minister good matter to the cleare confutation of it selfe. For in deede wee graunt that in some pointes Origene did erre / but those erroures are gathered oute / and nooted boeth of S Hierom / and Epiphanius / soe that his workes (those erroures excepted) are now so muche the more of authoritie / that suche greate learned menne / toke paines to drawe oute of him / what soeuer they thoughte in him to bee written amisse. But as concerning this matter of the lordes supper / neither they / nor yet euer any other aunciēt authour did euer saie that Origene did erre.
            Nowe because these two aunsweres haue bene of late soe confuted and confounded / 
                  Vuinchester in the aunsvuer to the 166. obiection.
                that it is well perceiued / that they will take noe place / therfore some whiche haue written sence that tyme / haue forged two other answeres euē of the same mould.
            The former wherof is / that Origene in this place spake not of the Sacramentall breade or wyne of the lordes table / but of an other misticall meate / of the whiche S. Augustin maketh mencion to be geuen vnto them that were taughte the faith / before they were baptised. But Origenes owne wordes in two sentences before rehersed beinge put to gether / proueth this aunswere vntrue: For he saieth that he meneth of that figuratiue and misticall bodye / whiche profiteth them that doe receiue it worthyly / alluding so plainly vnto S Paules wordes

spoken of the Lordes supper / that it is a shame for any learned manne once to open his mouth to the contrarie. And that breade whiche S Augustine speaketh of / he can not proue that any suche thinge was vsed in Origenes time: Yea and though that could be proued / yet was there neuer breade in any tyme called a sacramentall bodie sauing the sacramentall breade of the Lordes table / which is called of Origene / the typicall / and symbolicall bodie of Christe.
            The seconde of the two newe founde answeres / 
                  Vuich in the same place.
                is yet moste monstrous of all other / whiche is this. But let vs graunt (saie they) that Origene spake of the Lordes supper / and by the matter thereof was vnderstanded / the materiall substaunce of breade / and wine. What then saie they? for though the ma / teriall substaunce was once gone / and departed by reason of transubstantiation / whileste the formes of breade and wyne did remaine / yet nowe it is no inconuenience to saie that as that materiall substaunce did depart at the entryng in of Christes bodie vnder the aforesaide formes / soe when the saide formes be destroied / and doe not remaine / then cō
               meth againe the substance of bread and wine / and this (saie they) is verye meete in this misterie / that that which began with miracle / shal ende in a miracle. Yf I hadde not red this phantasie / I would scarselye haue beleued / that any learned man euer would haue set furth suche a folish fantasie / which

not onely lacketh all ground either of Gods word / reason / or of anie anciente writer / but is also cleane contrarie to the commen rules of schoole diuinitie / whiche is / that no miracle is to be affyrmed and putte withoute necessitie. And although for their former miracle / whiche is their trasubstantiation / they haue some collour / though it be but vaine / saynge it is doone by the power / and vertue / ofthese woordes of Christe / This is my bodie / yet to make this second miracle / of returning the material substaunce againe / they haue no colloure at all. Or els I pray them shew me / by what wordes of Christe / is that seconde miracle wrought.
            Thus ye maie see that the sleigthes and shiftes whiche crafte and witte can inuente to wreste the true sense of Origene can not take place. But now lette vs heare / one other place of Origene / and soe we shall lette him goe.
            Origene in the 11. Homelye Super Leuiticum / saeth that there is also euen in the fower gospelles / and not onely in the old Testamente a letter / meanynge a litterall sense whiche kylleth / for if thowe followe the letter (saieth he) in that saiynge: except ye eate the fleash of the sonne of manne / and drinke his bloude.
                  The second authoritie furth of Origene.
                &c. This letter doth kill. Yfin that place the letter doth kyll / wherin is commaunded the eating of Christes fleash / then suerlie in those wordes of Christ / wherin Christe commaundeth vs to eate

his bodie / the literall sense theroflikewise doth kill▪ For it is no lesse crime / but euen the same / and all one in the literal sense / to eate Christes body / and to eate Christes fleashe. Wherfore if the one doth kyll / except it be vnderstanded figuratiuelie / and spirituallie / then the other suerly doth kill likewise. But that to eate Christes fleashe doeth kill so vnderstanded / Origene affirmeth plainli in his words aboue rehersed. Wherfore it can not be iustlie denied / but to eate Christes body literallie vnderstanded / must nedes after him kill likewise.
            The aunsweare that is made to this place of Origene / of the papistes is soe folishe / that it bewraeyeth it selfe withoute anye further confutation. It is the same that they make to a place of S Augustine in his booke de doctrina Christiana.
                  Li. 3. ca.
                Whereas S. Augustine speaketh in effecte the same thynge that Origene doth here. The papistes answeare is this / to the carnal man the literall sense is hurtful / but not soe to the spirituall. As thoughe to vnderstande that in hys proper sense whiche oughte to be taken figuratiuelie / were to the carnall manne a daungerous perrill / but to the spirituall manne none at all.
            Nowe to Chrisostome whome I bring for the seconde writer in the Greke churche.
                  Chrisostome.
                He speakinge againste the vnholie vsyng of mans bodie / whiche

after S Paule ought to bekepte pure / and holie as the verie temple of the holy ghoste / saith thus: If it be a faulte saith he to translate the holied vesselles (in the whiche is not contained the trwe bodie of Christe / 
                  In opere imperfect Hom. 11. in Matth.
                but the misterie of the bodie) to priuate vses / howe muche more offence is it to abuse and defile the vesseles of our bodie. These be the woordes of Chrysostome. But I trowe that here many foule shiftes are deuised to defeate this place.
            The authoure saith one is suspected: I answere but in this place neuer fault was founde with him vnto these oure daies.
            And whether this authour were Ihon Chrisostome himselfe the Archbishoppe of Constantinople / or no / that is not the matter: for of al it is graū
               ted / that he was a writer of that age / and a man of greate learninge. Soe that it is manifest / that this which he writeth / was the receiued opiniō of learned men in his daies / or els vndoubtedly in suche a matter his saiyng should haue bene impugned / of some that wrote in his time / or nere vnto the same.
            Nay saith another / if this solution wil not serue / we maie saie that Chrysostome did not speak of the vesseles of the Lordes cuppe / 
                  Vuinch. in theansvuer to the 198. obiection.
                or suche as was then vsed at the Lordes table / but of the vesselles vsed in the temple in the olde lawe.
            
               This answere will serue no more then the other. For here Chrysostome speaketh of suche vesselles / wherin was that whyche was called the bodye of Christ / although it was not the true body (saith he) of Christe / but the misterie of Christes bodie. Now of the vesselles of the olde lawe / the writers doe vse no suche maner of phrase: for their sacrifices were not called Christes bodie / for Christe then was / but in shadows and figurs / and not by the sacrament of his bodie / reuealed.
            Erasmus whiche was a man that coulde vnderstand the wordes and sense of the writer / although he woulde not be seene to speake againste this error of transubstantiation because he durste not / yet in his time declareth plainlie / that this saiyng of this writer / is none otherwise to be vnderstanded.
            Yet can I saith the thirde papist finde out a fine and a subtill solution for this place / and graunt all that yet is saide / both alowing here the writer / and also that he mente of the vesselles of the Lordes table:
                  Vuinch. in the same place.
                For saith he the body of Christe is not conteined in them at the Lordes table / as in a place / but as in a misterie. Is not this a pretie shefte / and a mistical solution. But by the same solution then Christs bodie is not in the Lordes table / nor in the priestes hande / nor in the pixe / and soe he is here no where / For they will not saie that he is either here / or ther / as in a place. This answere pleaseth so wel the maker

/ that he hymselfe / after he hadde played with it a litle whyle / and shewed the finesse of his witte / and eloquence therin / he is contented to geue it ouer / and saye: But it is not to be thoughte that Chrisostome woulde speake after this finesse or subteltie / and therefore he returneth againe to the seconde aunsweare for hys shootte anker whiche is sufficientlye confuted before.
            Another shorte place of Chrisostome I wyll reherse / which (if any indifferencie maie be hearde) in playne tearmes setteth fourth the trueth of this matter.
            Before the breade (saieth Chrisostome writinge ad Cesarium Monachum) /
                  Chriso: stome ad Caesariū Monachum.
                be hallowed / we call it breade / but the grace of Godde sanctifiynge it by the meanes of the prieste / it is deliuered nowe from the name of breade / and esteamed worthy to be called Christes bodye / althoughe the nature of breade abyde in it still. These bee Chrisostomes woordes / wherin I praye you what canne be said or thoughte more playne agaynste this erroure of Transubstantiation / then to declare that the bread abideth soe styll.
            
               
                  Vuin. in his aunsvucre to the 201. obiection.
               And yet this soe plaine a place some are not ashamed thus shamefullye to elude it / Saiynge wee graunte the nature of breade remaineth still thus / for that it maie be seen / fealte / and tasted / 

and yet the corporall substaunce of the breade therfore is gone / lest two bodies be confused together / and Christ shoulde be thoughte impanate.
            What contrarietie and falsehoode is in this answeare / the simple manne maye easilie perceiue / is not this a plaine contrarietie to graunt that the nature of breade remaineth so still / that it maie bee seen / fealte / and tasted / and yet to saie the corporall substance is gone / to auoide absurditie of Christes impanation?
            And what manifest falsehoode is this to say / or meane / that yf the breade shoulde remayne styll / then muste followe the inconuenyence of impanation / as thoughe the verie breade coulde not be a Sacramente of Christes bodye / as water is of Baptisme / excepte Christe shoulde vnite the nature of breade to his nature in vnitie of person / and make of the breade God.
            Nowe let vs heare Theodoretus / whiche is the laste of the three Greke authoures.
                  Theodorete.
                He writeth in his dialoge Contra Eutichen / thus. He that calleth his naturall bodie / corne and breade / and also named himselfe a vine tree / 
                  Dialog. 1. euen he thesame hath honoured the Symboles / that is the sacramentall signes / with the names of his body and bloud / not chaunginge in dede the nature it selfe / but adding

grace vnto the nature. What canne be mor plainlye saide then this / that this olde writer saieth / that although the Sacramentes beare the name of the bodye and bloude of Christ / yet is not their nature chaunged / but abydeth still / and where is then the papistes transubstanciation?
            The same writer in the 2. Dialoge of the same worke / 
                  Dialog. 2. againste the aforesaid heretique Eutyches / writeth yet more plainlie against this error of transubstantiation / if any thing can be saide to be more plaine: for he maketh theretique speake thus agaīst him that defendeth the true doctrine whom he calleth Orthodoxus.
            As the sacramentes of the bodie and bloude of oure Lorde are one thinge before the inuocation and after the inuocatiō they be chaunged / and are made another: So likewise / the Lordes bodie saith the heretique is after the assumption or ascention into heauen turned into the substaunce of Godde: theretique meaninge therby that Christe after his assention remaineth no more a man.
            To this Orthodoxus aunswereth thus / and saieth to theretique. Thou art taken (saith he) in thine owne snare / for those misticall symbolles / or sacramentes / after the sanctification / doe not go out of their owne nature / but they tarrie and abide still in their substance / figure / and shape / yea and are sensiblye

seene / and groped to bee the same they were before. &c.
            At these woordes the papistes doe startle / and to say the truth / these wordes be so plaine / so full / 
                  The Cutle is a sea fish vuhich casteth as it vuere an yncke about herand so by making the vuater blacke escapeth taking. Pli. li. 9. Cap. 29. and so cleare / that they can not tell what to saye / but yet will not cease to goe about to plaie the Cutles / and to caste their colloures ouer them / that the trueth whiche is so plainlie tolde / shoulde not haue place.
            This authour wrote saie they before the determination of the church. As who would saie / whatsoeuer that wicked man Innocentius the Pope of Rome determined in his congregacions / with his monkes and friers / that must bee (for so Suns saieth) holden for an article / and of the substaunce of oure faith.
            Some do charge this authour that he was suspected to be a nestorian / which thing in Chalcedon Councell was tried and proued to be false.
            But the foulest shift of all / 
                  So ansvueres D. Morman, in the conuocation house.
                and yet the beste that they canne finde in this matter / when none other will serue / is to saie that Theodoret vnderstandeth by the woorde substaunce / accidents / and not substaunce in dede. This glose is like a glose of a laweyer vpon a decree the text wherof beginneth thus. Statuimus / that is wee decree. The glose of the lawyer there / after manie other pretie shiftes there

sette fourth / whiche he thinketh will not well serue to his purpose / and therefore att the laste / to cleare the matter / he saieth thus:
                  Distinct. 4. Cap. statuimus.
                After the minde of one Lawyer / veldic (saieth he) statuimus / id est abrogamus / that is / or expounde / we doe decree / (that is) we do abrogate / or disanull. Is not this a worthy and Goodlye glose? Who will not saie but he is worthye in the Lawe to be retained of Counsell / that canne glose soe well / and fynd in a matter of dyfficultie suche fyne shyftes / and yet this is the Lawe / or at the leste the glose of the lawe. And therfore who can tell what parrell a manne maye incurre to speake against it / excepte he were a lawyer in deede / whiche canne kepe himselfe oute of the briars / what wynde soeuer blowe.
            Hitherto yee haue harde three writers of the Greke Churche / not all what they doe saie / for that were a laboure to greate for to gather / and to tedyous for the reader / but one or twoo places of euerye one. The whiche howe plaine and howe full / and cleare they bee againste the erroure of Transubstantiation I referre it to the iudgemente of thindifferente reader.
            And nowe I wil likewise rehearse the saiynges of other three olde aunciente writers of the Lattin Churche / and soe make an ende.
            
               
                  Tertulliā.
               And firste I will begin with Tertullian / whom

Cypriane the holy Martyr so highlie estemed that whēsoeuer he would haue his booke / he was wōt to say / geue vs now the Master.
                  Lib. 4. contra Martionē.
                This olde writer in his 4. booke against Martion the heritike / saith thus: Iesus made the bread / which he toke and distributed to his disciples / his body / saiyng: This is my body / that is to say / (saieth Tertullian) a figure of my bodie. In this place it is plaine / that after Tertullians exposition / Christ ment not by calling the bread his body / and the wine his bloude / that either the bread was his natural bodie / or the wine his naturall bloude / but he called them his bodye and his bloud because he would institute them to be vnto vs Sacramentes / that is holie tokens and signes of his bodie / and of his bloud / that by them remembringe / and firmelie beleuing the benefites procured to vs by his body / whiche was torne and crucified for vs / and of hys bloude / whiche was shedde for vs vpon the crosse / and soe with thankes receiuinge these holye sacramentes / according to Christes institution / myghte by the same be spirituallie noryshed / and fedde / to thencrease of all Godlines in vs / here in oure pylgremage and iorney wherin we walke vnto euerlasting life.
            This was vndoubtedlie Christe our Sauiours mynde / and this is Tertullians exposition. The wranglynge that the papistes doe make to elude this saiynge of Tertullian / is so far out of all frame that it euen wearieth me to thinke on it.
            
               
               
                  Vuinch in his āsuuer to the 161. obiect.
               Tertullyan writeth here saye they / as none hath done hitherto before him. This saiyng is to to manyfest false: S. Augustine and other olde awthors likwise doo call the Sacrament a figure off Christs bodye.
            And wher they saie / that Tertullian wrott this / whē he was in an heat off disputation with an heretike / coueting by al meanes to ouercō his aduersarye. As who saye he wolde not take hede what he dyd saye / ād specialy what he wold write in so high a matter / so that he might haue the better hand off his aduersarie. Ys this credible to be trewe in any godly wyseman? Howe much lesse then is it worthy to be thowght / or credited in a man off so great wyt / lernyng / and excellency / as Tertullian is worthely / esteamed euer to haue bene.
            Lykwise this author in his first booke against the the same heretike Martion writeth thus. God dyd not reiect bread / which is his creature: for by it he hath made a representation off his bodye. Nowe I prai you what is this to say / that Christ hath made a representation by breade of his bodye / but that Christ hath / 
                  Lib. 1. cōtra Mar.
                instituted and ordeined bred to be a sacrament / for to represent vnto vs his bodye Nowe whether the representation of one thinge by another / requireth the corporall presence of the thinge which is so represented / or no / euery man that hath vnderstanding / is hable in this pointe (the matter is so cleare of it lsefe / ) to be a sufficient iudge.
            
               The second doctor and wryter off the latine churche whose saiynges I promised to set furth / 
                  S. August.
                is S. Augustine / off whose lernyng / and estimation / I neede not to speake: for all the churche of Christ both hath / and euer hath had hym for a man of moost singular learning / witte and dilygence / both in setting fourth the true doctrine of Christes religion / and also in the defense off the same againste heretikes.
            This awthor as he hath written most plenteously in other matters off our faith / so like wise in this argument he hathe written at large in manye off his workes so plainli against this error of transubstantiation / that the papistsloue least to heare of him off all other writers / partly for his authoritye / and partly because he openeth the matter more fully then any one other doth. Therfore I will reherse moe place off him / then heretofore I haue done of the other.
            And firste what can be more playne / then that whiche he writeth vppon the 89. psalme speking of the sacramente of the Lordes bodye and bloud / and rehersing (as yt were) Christes wordes to his disciples affter this maner.
            Yt is not this bodie which ye doo see / that ye shal eate / neither shall ve drincke this bloud / which the Soudiares that Crucefye me schall spille / or

shedde: I doe commende vnto you a misterie or a sacramente / whiche spiritually vnderstanded shall geue you life. Nowe if Christ hadde no moe naturall and corporall bodies but that one / whiche they then presentlie boeth harde / and saw: And none other naturall bloude / but that whiche was in the same bodie / and the whiche the souldiers cruellye did after shedde vppon the Crosse / and neither this bodie / nor this bloude / was by this declaration of S. Augustine / either to be eaten / or dronken / but the misterie therof spirituallye to be understanded: Then I conclude / (if this saiyng and exposition of S. Augustine be trwe) / that the misterie whiche the disciples shoulde eate / was not the natural bodie of Christe / but a misteri of the same / spirituallye to be vnderstanded. For as S. Augustine saieth in his 20. booke contra faustum. Cap. 21 Christes fleashe and bloude was in the olde testament promised by similitudes / and signes of their sacrefyces / and was exhibited in deede / and in trueth / vpon the crosse / but the same is celebrated by a sacrament of remembrance vpon the aulter.
            And in his booke de fide ad Petrum. Cap. 19 / he saeth that in these Sacrifices (meaninge of the olde lawe) it is figuratiuelie signified / what then was to be geuen: But in this Sacrifice it is euidentlie signified what is alreadie geuen / vnderstanding in the sacrifice vpon the aulter / the remembraunce and thankes geuing for the fleashe / whiche he offred

for vs / and for the bloude whyche he shedde for vs vppon the Crosse / as is in the same place / and euidentlye there it maie appeare.
            Another euidente and cleare place / wherein it appeareth that bythe Sacramentall breade / whyche Christe called hys bodye / he meante a fygure of hys bodie / is vppon the thyrde Psalme: Where Sancte Augustine speaketh thus in plaine tearmes. Christe did admit Iudas vnto the feast / in the whiche he commended to his disciples the fygure of hys bodye. Thys was Christes laste supper before hys Passion: Wherein he dydde ordayne the Sacrament of hys bodye / as all learned menne doe agree.
            S. Augustine also in his 23. Epistle ad Bonifacium teacheth howe Sacramentes doe beare the names of the thinges wherof they be sacraments / boeth in Baptisme / and in the Lordes table.
                  August. Epi. 23. Euen as we call euerie good fryday / the daye of Christes passion: and euerie Easter day the daie of Christes resurrection. When in verie dede there was but one daie wherin he suffered / and one daie wherein he rose. And why doe we then call them so which are not so in dede / but because they are in like time / ād course of the yeare / as those dais were wherin those things wer done: Was Christ (saeth S. Austin / offred any more but once? and he offred hīself:
            
               And yet in a sacramente / or representation / not onely euery solempne feast of Easter / but also euery daie / to the people he is offered. For if sacramentes had not some similitude / or likenes of those things wherof they be sacramentes / they could in no wise be sacramētes. And for their similitudes / and likenes commēly they haue the names of the thinges wherof they bee sacramentes. Therfore / as after a certaine maner of spech / the sacramente of Christes bodie / is Christes bodie / the sacramente of Christes bloud / is Christes bloud / so likewise the sacrament of faith is faith. &c.
            After this maner of speache / as S. Augustine techeth in his questions Super Leuiticum / et contra adimantum / 
                  Question 57. it is sayed in scripture that seuen eares of corne be seuen yeares / seuen kyne be seuen yeares / and the rocke was Christe / and bloud is the soule: The whiche laste saiynge (saieth S. Austen) in his booke contra adimantum / is vnderstanded to be spoken in a signe / or figure / for the Lorde himselfe did not sticke to saie / This is my bodie / when he gaue the signe of his bodie.
                  Cap. 13.
            
            For we muste not considre in sacramentes (saieth S. Augustine in an other place) what they be / but what they do signifie.
                  Contra Maximium. lib. ca. 22. For they be signes of things / being one thing in themselues / and yet signifiyng an other thing. For the heauenly breade (saieth he) speakinge of the sacramentall breade / by some maner

of speach is called Christes bodye / when in verye dede it is the sacrament of the bodye / &c.
            What can be more plaine / or more clearely spoken / then are theis places of S. Augustine before rehersed / if men were not obstinately bent to mainteyne an vntrewth / and to receiue nothing what so euer doth sett it fourth.
            Yet one place more of S. Augustine will I alledge which is verie cleare to this purpose / that Christes naturall bodye is in heauen and not here corporally in the sacrament / and so lett him depart.
            In his 50.
                  Tract. 50. in Ioan.
                Treatyse which he writeth vppon Ihon̄ he teacheth plainly / and clearlie howe Christ being both God and man / is both here after a certaine maner / and yet in heauē / and not here in his naturall bodye and substaunce which he tooke of the blessed virgine Marie speking thus of Christ and saing. By his diuine maiestye by his prouidence / by his vnspeakable and inuisible grace / that is fulfilled which he spake: Behold I am with yow vnto the ende of the worlde. But as concerning his fleash / whiche he tooke in his incarnation / as towching that which was born of the virgine / as concerning that which was apprehended by the Iewes / and crucified vppon a tree / and taken downe from the crosse / lapped in lynen clothes / and buryed and rose agayn / and appeared after his resurrecton

/ as coocerning that fleash he sayed / Ye shall not euer haue me with yow / why so? For as concerning his fleashe he was conuersaunt with his disciples 40. dayes / and they accompanying / seing / and not following him / he went vpp into heauen and is not here. By the presence of his diuine maiestie he did not depart / as concerning the presence of his diuyne maiestie we haue Christ euer with vs / but as concerning the presence of his fleash he said truly to his disciples / ye shall not euer haue me with yow. For as concerning the presence of his fleashe / the church had him but a fewe dayes / nowe yt holdeth him by fayth / thowgh it seeth him not.
            Thus much S. Augustine speketh repeting one thing so ofte / and all to declare / and teach / howe we should vnderstand the maner of Christes being here with vs / which is by his grace / by his prouidence / and by his diuine nature / and howe he is absent by his natural bodie / which was born of the virgine Marie / dyed / and rose for vs / and is ascended into heauē / and ther sitteth as is in tharticles of our faith on the right hand of god / and thense / and from none other place (saith S. Augustine) shall comme on the latter daye to iudge the quicke and the dead. At the which daye the righteous shall then lift vpp their heades / and the lighte of godes truth shall so shine / that falsehood / and errors shalbe putte to perpetuall confusion. Righteousnes

shall haue the vpper hand / and trewth that daie shall beare awaie the victorie / all the Enemyes therof quyte ouerthrowen / to be troden vnder foote for euermore.
            O Lord / Lord / I beseach the / hast this daye / thē shalt thow be glorifyed with the glorye dewe vnto thy holy name / and vnto thy diuine maiestie / and we shall singe vnto the in all ioye and felicitee laude and prayse for euermore.
            Here now wold I make an end / for methink S. Augustine is in this matter so full / ād playne / and of that authoritye / that it should not neade after this his declaration / being so firmely grownded vppon goddes word / and so well agreing with other awncyene awthours / to bring in for the confirmation of this matter / anye moe. And yet (I sayed) I wold alledge three / of the Latyne church / to testefye the truthe in this cause.
            Nowe therfore the last of all shalbe Gelasius / Gelasius. which was a Busshop of Rome / but one that was Busshopp of that Sea / before the wicked vsurpation / and Tyrannye therof spredde / and brast owt abroade into all the worlde. For this man was before Bonifacius / yea ād Gregory the first: In whose daies / both corruption of doctrine / and tyrannicall vsurpatiō did chiefly growe / and had the vpper hand.
            
               Gelasius in an Epistle of the two natures of Christ / contra Eutichen / writeth thus. The sacramentes of the bodie and bloud of Christ / which we receue / are godly thinges / wherby / and by the same / we are made partakers of the diuīe nature / ād yet neuertheles the substaunce / or nature / of the breade / and wyne doth not departe or go awaye.
            Note thes wordes I beseach yow / and cōsyder / whether any thing can be more playnlye spoken / then theis wordes be against the error of Transubstantiation: which is the grownd / and bitter roote whervppon springeth all the horrible errours before rehersed.
            Wherfore seing that 
                  〈◊〉
                falsehood hereof doth appeare so manyfestly / and by so many wayes / so plainely / so clearelie / and so fullye / that no man nedeth to be deceiued / but he that will not see / or will not vnderstand. Let vs all that doo loue the truth / embrase yt / and forsake the falsehed / for he that loueth the truth / is of god / and the lacke of the loue therof / is the cause why God suffereth men to fall into errours / and to perish therin / yea and as S. Paule saith / why he sendeth vnto them illusyons / that they beleue lyes / vnto their owne condemnatyon: because (sayth he) they loued not the truthe. This truth / no dowbt / is Goddes word / for Christ him self sayth / vnto his Father: Thy word is truthe / the loue / and light wherof / Almightye God

heauenlye father giue vs / and lighten it in owr hartes / by his holye Spiryte / throwghe Iesus Christ our Lorde / AMEN.
