dyd chaunce in the primatyue churche, euen in the tymes of y• a poſtelles, to the great hynderance, and let of the goſſpell of Chriſte, for where ſo euer, the apoſtells and dyſciples of oure ſauyour, had preachyd y• kyngdome of god, and with greate peane and labour, had brough: the people, from theyr ſuperſtytious, and vngodly wayes, in to the waye of the truthe: there dyd breake in certayne falſe prophetes, and falſe a poſtelles alſo, with there peruerſe and hypocriticall doctryne, ſubuertynge the myndes of them, that wt ioyfull hartes, had receyued the glade tidynges of ſaluatin̄ & delyueraunce.

For as ſoone as any man, by y• inſpiration and gyft of the holy goſt, dyd begyne in thoſe dayes, to preache the goſſpell, purely & ſincerely, to the great glorye of god and edyfyeng of the church, defending with the ſwerd of the ſpiritee, that libertee and fryedome, that chriſt with hys precyous bloode hath purchaſſyd

In ſo muche that the yearthly prynces, whome, with theyr abhomynabyll dyſſcimulation, they had gotten on theyr ſede, blyndynge and poyſeynynge them moſt ſubtillye & craftely, with the golden cuppe

of ye purplyd hore of Babylone, thought, that they dyd a greate ſacryfyce vnto god, whan, with all the tirannye that coulde be, for theſe belys ſake, murthered, and perſequuted them, whome god had choſē and ſent, to ſhewe vnto them, the waye of truthe & ſaluation. But bleſſed be that bontuous lorde, which hath not ſuffered the prynces, whome by hys diuine prouidence, he hath made & ordoned, to be ſupreme gouernors of hys church, immedyatly vnder hym (though by y• tyrannicall power of thoſe falſe prophetes, & antichriſtes, they ware put, by that ſuperyorytye a greate whyle) to erre and bee deceued any lōger, but dyd moſt mercyfull opē their eyes to loke vpon that comfortable ſonne of ryghtuoſnes, and lyght of the

truthe, y• they myghte, in theſe thyk darkeneſſys of thys wretched worlde, be gydes vnto hys people, to bryng them out of the egypte of ignorannycye, and ſo leade them through y• parylous deſertes, into y• land of promiſcion. For the which thynges, we are all greatly bounde, to gyue dayly, and hourley, immortall thāckes vnto god, and ſpecially that, of hys bountuous, & mere goodnes he hath gyuen vnto vs ſuch of noble & coragious prince which now in his tender years, is ſo delegentli brought vp, ī all godlynes & vertuous learning, that he hereafter, as a nobyll Salomon, ſhall wt all prudence and godly wyſdome, not onely ſhed the blode of them that dyd ſhede the innocent bloode, but alſo, buylde vp, myghtely, the

temple of the liuing god. Which thyng, as dauyd in y• olde lawe, ſo nowe oure moſte vyctoryus prynce. Henrye the eyghte, the father of this, oure ſofuerayne lorde kyng Edwarde the ſyxte, wolde had done, if god had not dyſpoſed otherwyſe, with hym. But thanckes be to god, that he hath ſo well, prepared all thynges, before hys death, and that he hath wt y• tow edgged ſworde of the ſpiritee, cutted a waye alredy, the buſhes, thornes and brembles, that ſhuld had letted the buyldyng of the temple, makyng the ground euen, by abbatynge the pryde of theſe falſe a poſteles, and puttyng awaye, by litell and litell the rubbyſhe, of vngodly traditions and vayne ceremonis. Which thyng wyl be no, ſmal ſpurre, vnto our moſt

ſofuerayne lord, kyng Edward the ſyxt, to performe and bryng to proſperous, and ioyfull ende, that, which hys louyng father, hath begonne, ſo godly. And I doubte not, but now (god wyllynge, who neuer for ſaketh hys true, and faythfull ſeruantes, though, to trye theyr fayth, for a tyme and ſeaſon, ſuffereth thē to be perſequuted) all thynges ſhall be done to y•, glory of god, and greate conforte of ye louing ſubiectes, of thys noble and floryſhyng realme. Among whom (as we may, eaſely pr

               ceyue, by theyr dylygent and greadye comyng to the churches, whan they heare of any ſermon, and preachyng) is fallē now a great hunger and thriſt, not of thys materyall breaed, and drincke, but of the lyuely worde of god.

But alas in ſtede, of y• heauēly breade, y• feadeth to euerlaſting lyfe, they be deluded wt blind & dome ceremones. Which thing, I truſt, not lōg ſhal cōtynew in chriſtes churche, where ye word of god, onely ſhould reygne, and wtout y• which, purely & ſincerly preached, is no church but a dē of theues. Excepte I ſaye theſe, vanytes, and peſtyferous inuetions of men: be vtterly bānyſhed a waye it is more lyke the carnall temple of the Iues (in whoſe Synagoges Moyſes, & the prophetes war reade euery Sabothe daye, without fayle) than the church of chriſte. But now, ſith that it hath pleaſed god (whoe lokynge mercyfully vpon the affliction of his people hath ſent the 
                  〈…〉
                myghtye deliuerer) to enhaunce, and make

your grace, not onely hygh protector & defendour of this noble contrey of England, but alſo a faithfull ouerſeer, of y• buylding of this ſpirituall temple, which is the church of the lyuyng god, that, with hys precious bloode, he dyd waſhe, from all ſpote, blote, and macule, to tryūphe with hym euerlaſtyng lyfe, in hys heauenly kyngdome, and y• towarde the ſame buyldyng, as in the olde lawe, towarde the ſettyng vp of y• tabernacle ſome men dyd offer gold, ſome ſyluer, ſome precyous ſtones, ſome a gayne dyd offer purple, ſcarlet, and ſylkes: I thoughte accordyng, to my pouer abylytye, be cauſe I coulde, offer none, of y• aboue reherced thyngs to offer at leſt, either ſome vyle gotes: ſkynes, or ſome ledde, to couer

thys ſpirituall temple, and to keape, the rayne, and foule weather, frome that gorgyous and goodly ornamentes, that other men, accordyng to their ryche, & pregnant wytts haue abundantly offered. It is ſo, that otherwhyles, for lacke of good couerture, many fayre, & goodli places, well & gorgyouſly trym med wtin, and decked pleſantly, with gold, aſure, and precious ſtones, doo fall in ſhorte ſpace, in to great dekaye, by reaſon of the rayne y• falleth in. Lykwyſe yf a remydye, be not prouyded, that the churche of god, and celeſtyall Ieruſalem (whiche is now almoſt buyldyd vp agayn, and through reparated, by our godly Nehemias) may be fēſed, againſt y• tempeſtuous hereſis of the Anabaptiſtes (whyche,

                  Tell me I praie y•, if thou art a

good felow. What harmes, doe theſe men, go about to doe? for I dare ſaie and affirme, that I haue not hetherto harde, that thei haue gone about any thyng, that doeth abhorre, from truthe and honeſty. In the meane ſeaſon I know, that many thynges are imputed vnto them, falſely, moreouer that thei be accuſed, and blamed in many thynges, whiche thei dooe not knowlage them ſelues, to be gylty in.

                  I can not vtterly blame this ſorte of men, for yet I haue not harde, that thei haue done any abhomynable thyng.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  But I wil

make it, manyfeſte vnto the. This ſecte dyd vtterly ſubuerte the whole citie of Waltzhountum, and did cauſe many of the cytezens, whyche were bothe good and ryghtfull men, to bee exyled, and to be put from their poſſeſſions. Wherfore the goſpell (whiche dyd floryſſhe godly there) was alſo outrageouſly extynguyſſhed. The whiche thyng dyd almoſte chaunce, in a citee, called Vormantia. There were Anababtyſtes in Auguſte, in Baſile, and in Morania, whiche did affyrmt, that Chriſte was but a prophete, ſaiyng that the vngodly perſones, whiche for theyr vngodlyneſſe were damned, and the dyuelles alſo, ſhulde enioye, the heauenly bleſſe. In a towne called Sanctogallus, one of them, did ſmite

of his owne brothers heade, the father of heauen (as he ſayed) byddynge hym thus to dooe. What abhominacion they dooe commytte, vnder the pretence, and colour of ſpirituall matrimony, the townes and cittees, that did oftentymes, greuouſly punyſſhe them, for ſuche wicked and abhominable factes, dooe manifeſtly ſhewe and teſtifie. And this no man can denay, but that many of them, do leaue and forſake their owne wyues and children, yea all offyce and honeſty beyng caſted a ſyde, dooe lyue, feade, and fatte them ſelues, with other mens labours, ſnortyng bothe daie and nyght, moſte ſlougardely. And where as, they bee wholely gyuen to ſo foule and deteſtable ſenſualytee, they dooe interprete

it, to be, the commaundemente, of the heauenly father, perſuadyng to women and honeſte matrones, that it is impoſſible for them, to be partakerres of the kyngdome of heauē excepte thei doe abhominabli proſtitute, and make common theire owne bodies to all men, ſithe that it is, wrytten, that we muſte forſake and renounce, to all thynges, y• we loue beſt, and that we ought to ſuffer all kyndes of infamie, or reproche, for Chriſtſake, beſyde that, that ye publicans, and harlottes ſhallbe preferred, to the ryghtwes, in the kyngdome of heauen, There is no ende, nor meaſure of ther infydelitie, and falſhod, of their liyng and ſedition, with the which vices theſe diſobedient perſons are on euery ſyde infectyd. Are theſe, my

Symon, and other muche greuoſer, which I dooe paſſe ouer here, for the nones, to be callyd vertues? Dooe they ſeme vnto ye yet, to haue done no vnhoneſt acte? Or canſte thou denaye, but that thei haue done theſe thīges
               
               
                  Symon.
                  Truly many thinges are aſcribed vnto them falſely and the fame or voyce of the people, dooeth alwayes adde ſomwhat vnto it.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  That, which is ſayed hetherto, maye be prouyd by ſealed letters, and with ſure and infalible witneſſes. I haue here wittingly paſſed ouer theyr abhominable crimes, and haue ſayed, a greate deale leſſe, than they haue done them ſelues. Therfore, it greauith me the more, that men are ſo blynde, that they can not perceiue, nor ponder in their hertes

ſuche thynges. But rather, that a greate ſorte of men, dooe embrace thoſe erroneous felowes and rennegates, eauen as, yf they ware fallen, or ſent doone from heauen and were ſaintes amonge mortall men, whiche ſhould preache, none other, but godly & heauēly thinges. Where as thei doe paſſe, in filthy liuing the Nicolantes, and Valentynians.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  Theſe thīges haue ben hetherto vnknowen vnto me. And I ſuppoſe, that they be not all pollutyd, with thoſe filthye abhominationes. But what ſkyllithe, to them, yt are good, what fewe among thē Dooe committe? In the hollie nūbre of the apoſtelles, Iudas was a traytour, and yet neuertheleſſe was callyd an apoſtyll. Which (I ſuppoſe) coulde not

hurte the other. Moreouer thei teache ſo excellente and godly thynges, of god, of ſhunninge ſynnes, that I can not perceaue yt they be ſo wycked, and lewde. Whan they are takē, they praiſe and laude god, they gyue thankes, whan they are put to death they doe conſtantly endure and ſuſteyne, dyeng gladly and wyllynglie. This thou canſte not denaye my Ioiada, wherfore I wolde gladly, that thou haddeſt hard them as I haue.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  I coulde paraduenture, bringe here fewe thynges, agaynſte the excepte I knowe well alredye, all this ſorte, of men and that a greate whyle a go. But I am not ingnoraunte, howe muche hipocriſye can preuayle, by the meanes of fraude and deceate. And as touchynge thyne anſwere,

thou ſayeſt very well in that, that is to wyt, that the wycked facte of fewe, ſhall not harme the innocent. But thou haſte not yet proued, that the cauſe of the Anababtiſtes is iuſt and good, Nor thou canſte not ſhewe one amonge them whiche is not commaculate, and infected with ſome of theſe ſaid vices I meane lyenge, falſhode, periurie, diſobedience, ſedicion, idelnes, forſakynge of their wiues and chyldren, turpitude. And though all theſe vices doe not ſticke or cleaue to them al at ones, yet not withſtandyng are they euery chone pollutid with ſome of them. That in the mean ſeaſon I ſhould ſpeake nothyng of their hereſie, and ſectes, of their pertinacie, of their falſe & erroneous doctrīe. And becauſe

                  In this thyng truely thei do wrong and iniury to the preachers of the goſpell, teſtifiyng the contrary to the vniuerſall chyrche, that is to ſaie, denaiyng, that by the goſpel truely and ſyncerely preached the people is taught to put their truſte, in the onely and true lyuyng god through Ieſu Chriſte. In ſo muche that among the enemies of the goſpell, it is ſaied in maner of a prouerbe, that prieſtes doe preache nothyng elles, but of god and faith onely, beyng offēded, with this preachyng: Man is iuſtified by faith alone.

                  Now therefore if the Catababtiſtes, dooe teache of god and faithe otherwiſe, ſurely thei dooe blaſpheame god and ſeduce the people. And if thei doe teache, all one thing with vs (for ſo it muſt be, if thei doe teache ryght, and accordynge to the ſcriptures) why doe thei therfore ſeparate them ſelues from vs. Or is not that ſufficient, that we teache, ſythe that we dooe teache bothe one thyng?
               
               
                  Sym.
                  There is one thyng, that ye wyll not teache, that is to ſaie, that thei, whiche are godly, ſhulde not ſinne at al. And again ſinners are not ſhunned of you Nor ye will not ſeparate your ſelues, from this polluted, and wicked worlde.
               
               
                  Ioiad.
                  We were taught by our ſauiour Ieſu Chriſt, that thei, that are

whole, haue no neade of the phiſycian, but thei that art ſycke. For the Phariſees dyd obiecte the ſame to y• diſciples of Chriſt, ſaiyng: Why doeth your maiſter eate with ſinners? furthermore ſeyng that no man liueth without ſynne, not as muche, as the infaunt of one daie: we owght not to teache, that men ſhoulde not ſynne at all, but rather to repent daiely and hourely, and to beware of ſinne, as of a ſnake, and that the godly owght not to diſpaire, if thei fall, at any tyme As for the ſinnes, that are committed openly, thei are ſo exagitate or rebuked by the miniſters of the churche. Suche ſeueritee and extreme grauitee is vſed in rebukyng, that theyr enemies are wont to ſaie alredy, that thei can none other thyng,

but chide and braule. Agayne, touchynge abſtencion or ſeparatyng, we doe not ſee that euer Chriſte did the ſame, as long as there was any hope. We doe not ſeparate our ſelues, leaſt we become like vnto the Phariſees, Luc. xviii.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  But ſinnes are not forſaken.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  And that, owght not to bee imputed to the doctrine, but to them, whiche doe not folow the teachyng. The teachyng and doctrine (as thou graunteſt thy ſelfe) is holſome, and in it, nothing is wantyng or lackynge. What other thyng doe then, the Catababtiſtes, in teachyng the contrary, but ſhew theyr pertinacy and a certaine ſyngularitee or loue of them ſelues, wherby it cometh to paſſe, that nothyng but that, which thei doe them ſelues pleaſeth

them? As this, is not done, without affection, ſo it can not be without vice.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  And yet not withſtandyng, thou doeſt not beleue, how deuout they are to god, how full of conſtancy and grauitee, how feruently thei loue god.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  I can not beleue, yt this deuocion of theirs is without blame, or is ſyncere and pure. For thei diuide the churche, where no neade is. For thou canſt not denaie, but that god, is taught by vs truely and faithfully. And that ſynnes are reprehended and rebuked, with great libertee and conſtauncie. What doe thei therfore, that we doe not, ſaue onely, that thei doe ſeparate them ſelues, frō other, and are full of obſtinacie? Doeth not Sathā alſo tranſforme him ſelfe, into an āgell of light?

What merueill is therfore, if theſe impoſtours or deceitfull perſons, can faine them ſelues, to be ſheapeherdes? Thei that doe fiſſhe, dooe not caſte a bare hooke before the fyſſhes, but doe hyde & couer it, with ſome pleaſaunt and ſwete baite. And Cato did ſaie veary well. Whiles the byrder, the byrdes begyleth, The flute alwai ſwetely pipeth. Nor he is not ſo fooliſſhe, as for to ſet or laye his net before the birdes eies. Did not the biſſhop of Rome ſeduce vs ſo many yeres, with his peincted hipocriſie, and with his godly and dyuyne diſſimulacion and fraude? But theſe thynges are gon out of remembraunce, ſythe that we doe, ſo lyghtly addicte or bynde our ſelues, to theſe newe impoſtours, and hipocrites. By what

craftes, did monkes get ſo gret richeſſes, was it not, by flatteryng, and hypocriſie? Was it not, by a feined ſanctimony, and holyneſſe of lyfe? As for that, yt thei doe reioyce, when thei are taken, & dye gladly, with prayſyng and laudyng god, thou doeſt ſo exaggerate and extoll it, as though theſe thynges (if thei be done) ſhulde ſhewe and proue that their doctrine is true, and that their deedes are good. If thou canſt proue that, it ſhall folowe, that theft and robbery, be iuſte and good deedes alſo. For whan thei be puniſſhed at the galows, or vpon the whele, thei doe oftentymes ſuffer it paciently, & moreouer, doe praiſe & laude god. Who is ſo folyſſhe, to thynke, that he maye thus make his argument? This man

is tormented and puniſſhed, & yet not withſtandynge, dooeth gyue thankes: ergo, he is a iuſt man & holy. If any man, ſhulde contende, that this doeth folow, he muſte nedes to graunt alſo, that the religion of the Iues, is moſte holy, yea, that their religion onely is true. For no man▪ doeth pacientlyer endure, to the very death, for his religion, thā the Iues doe. How many heretikes were there (thinkeſt thou) which did moſte conſtantly ſuffer death, teſtifiyng, wt their oūe blood, that thei had taught the truthe. Do not oftētime robers & traitours, which ſuffer death, accordīg to their deſeruyng, ſtifly defend their innocencie, to the laſt breath? Is therfore y• cauſe of ſuch an obſtacle and deſperat man, iuſtified before god? Who

doeth not perceiue, y• the farther he is from repentance and confeſſion, ſo muche the worſe he is
               
               
                  Symon.
                  It is ſo as, thou ſaieſt, nor I can not ſaie, againſte it. But this is moſte to be lamented, that we, whiche are ſimple perſons, are ſo toſſed and caried to and fro, in ſo muche, that we can not tel, what is beſte to bee doone. The Anababtiſtes dooe ſaie, that ye doe erre, and ye ſaie agayne, that thei be out of the right waie. After my iudgemēt, what miſery ſo euer, or trouble there is, it dooeth come of the prieſtes. And I dooe thinke, yt ther were neuer ſo troubleſome tymes. It were peraduenture better, that I folowyng myne owne mynde, ſhuld beleue, none of you al, doyng al thinges after myne owne appetite, and witte.

                  Thou ſhalt not do ſo, my Symō, but now, learne by thine own ſelf what good, doeth come of the anababtiſtes & what thou haſt ſucked of thē, for thou doeſt ſhew openly, ye fruite, that is to ſaie, deſperacion, and to truſt in thi ſelf, haſt thou forgottē, what god hath commaunded, in Deuteronomy? ſaiyng: ye ſhal not do euery man, y•, which ſemeth good vnto you, but that, which y• lord hath commanded. So this phā

But ye your ſelues, are in the faulte, being the autors of your one harmes, for ſuch deceitful perſons, do pleaſe you. By & by, as ſone as any cōtencious body, or ſome new & vnaccuſtomed thing, doeth ſet forthe his head, ye come rēning by troppes, & neither

And whan ye be come into y• botomles pit of miſerie or myſchef ye put ye faulte in the ouerſeers, which do geue you warnyng before, wt great fidelitie & trothe.

If thou haddeſt redde the hollie goſpelles & actes of the Apoſtelles, thou ſhouldeſt haue founde greuouſer diſſentions, whiche did riſe of the ſermons of Chriſt and of his apoſtelles. Finallie that hiſtories are full of tumultes, which dyd ſpryng in tymes paſte, of the falſe oppinions of Marcion, Valentinus, Arrius, Neſtorius Enriches, Donatus, Pelagius, and other heretikes. Ther were great tumultes and

rebellions, not onely of cities & townes, but alſo of whole realmes, which wer ſo great, yt ours owght not to be compared with them. Did not bothe chriſt himſelfe, and his apoſtels gyue warnyng before, that ſectes, ſhould aryſe? Not becauſe, that for thē we ſhould be amaſyd, or deſpair vtterly, but becauſe, that wee ſhould ye more dilygently watch againſt ſuche peſtiferous ſectes not onely to auoyde and ſhunne them, but to reſiſte alſo.

                     None of the Saintes dyd euer by violence or force, ſet forthe or thruſte them ſelues in to the commune office of a preacher, ſaue onely whan they ware ſente by god, elected and

choſen, by the apoſtells and churche.
                     CHriſte and the apoſtels did neuer trouble ye churche for yerthly and temporal thinges, but did chiefly ſtudy to nouryſſhe the peace and vnitee of al the churches. It appereth therfore, that thei, whiche doe trouble & diuide any churches being wel ordeined & pacified in chriſt for ſuch thynges, are ſedicious, lyers and heretykes.
                     THei are to bee counted falſe prophetes, which not without blaſphemy & contempte of the croſſe of Chriſt, doteache, that Chriſt dyd take awaie onely origynall ſynne, affirmyng that thei, which doe fail againe, after that thei be ones purified,

and clenſed by the water of regeneracion, ſhal not obteine daily remiſſion of their ſynnes. Thei be alſo falſe prophetes, y• doe attribute or adſcrib iuſtification to our owne workes.
                     Suche are blaſphemous agaīſt the goſpell, which doe contēd and affirme that the ſoules do ſlepe, after this lyfe not knowyng the nature of the ſoule, nor the vertue of the reſurreccion of Chrfſt.
                     Rebabtization or babtizing agayne, is not of god, but a new ſecte deuiding the vnitie of the churche, wherby the moſt peſtiferous, and hurtefull hereſie, of Nonatus, Anpencius and Pelagius is renewed.

                  Symon.
                  I praie the, that thou wylt reherſe, out, of this chapiter, the thinges, yt moſte chyefly, doe for our pourpoſe,
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  Theſe are the wordes of the apoſtel: Who is wyſe, and endued with knolage amonge you (Let hym ſhewe, by his good conuerſacion, his workes, with a gentell wyſdome. If ſo be, that ye haue bytter enuye and contencion, in your hertes, dooe not ye boaſte of it, nor be liers againſte the truth. For that wiſdome, is not connyng from aboue, but yerthly beaſtelyke, and deauelyſhe. For where tnuye and contentacion, is, ther

is incōſtancie and wicked workes. But the wiſedom whiche is from heauen or from aboue firſt is chaſte, after peaſible, meake, tretable, full of mercie, and of good fruites, withoute rache or vnaduiſed iudgement, and ſimulacion Hitherto haue we reherſed the wordes of Iames. Ponder and iudge now, whether the holy Apoſtle, did not liuelye deſcribe the faſhions, and doctrin of the Anababtiſtes. For what do they els, but ineth and rayle againſt other men, and that of a deſpitefull enuye and bitternes, oppreſſing thē wt preiudicial ſē
                     tence, and iudgemēt?

                  They promeſſe to make an aunſwere, before any manne, and to geue a reaſonable accoumpt of their doctrine and learnyng.
                  Moreouer that they wyll ſuffer

them ſelues patiently to be conuicted of errour.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  Why dooe they promeſſe that whiche thei wil neuer perfourm? Thou thy ſelfe haſte knowen manye (to ſaye the truthe, they doe all of a pretudiciall ſentence, ſtiflie and with great pertinacy, ſtād in their owne oppinions which ſaied, that thei ware ſufficiētly tawght. dyd knoledge their erroure, and offered them ſelues to recante, yea and dyd forſwere their errour. And by and by as ſone, as they ware come, to their complyces or felowes, thei dyd renewe their hereſee, and againſt their othe, and all honeſtye beſyde, dyd obſtinatly defende it, What ſhould we doe with ſuche men? Paule ſayeth: Shunne thou an heretyke, after that thou haſt warned hym ōes

or twyſe. Their doctrine therfore, is a certaine pertenax contention, and bitter wyſdome, ſuche as Saynt Iames doeth deſcrybe.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  In the meane ſeaſon, they wyll neuer graunt, thy concluſions to be true.

                  This is, that I ſaye thei be more ſtyfe & more obſtacle thā doeth be come any chriſtē men, to be. But thou, that haſte lyued, moſt famylyarly wt them knoweſt wel and perfitly, their foundacions, where vpon they grounde them ſelues.

                  I wolde therfore, my Symon. that thou ſhouldeſt now diſpute agaynſt my concluſions as the Anababtiſtes are wonte to doe but without ſtomake and contē
                     cion I wyll endeuoure my ſelfe to corroborate and ſtreingthen

them with holy ſcripures, and to proue that they be true.

                  Be it as thou ſaieſt. For I deſire to be taughte. Thou ſhalte haue me alſo obediente. ſo that I may vnderſtande and perceiue yt thy doctrine and teachyng is true. ❧
                  
               
            
            
               
               The third treatie or dialoge.
               
                  How that the ſpirite, which repugneth agaynſt the ſpirite, that ſpeaketh in the ſcriptures, is not from the father of truth, but from the father of lyes the deuels.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  
                     Fyrſte and formoſt, I dooe meruell, what moueth the, to put this concluſiō where as after myne oppynion and iudgmēt, it is no nede, therof.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  But, it ſemeth vnto me, to be verye neceſſarye. For manie of the Anababtiſtes, doe boaſte, I can not tel, what ſpirite, and father, agaynſte the manyfeſt ſcriptures. For whan they perceiue them ſelues, to bee ouer comed, with holye ſcriptures, and ſo holden in that they

can, by no waye eſcape: by and by, they crye oute, ſayeng that the ſpiritee, teacheth them, an other thyng, that is to ſaye, eyther to holde theyr peace, or to ſpeake forthe ſome tryflyng matter▪ and that they bee, neyther ſubiecte, ne bound to the litterall ſenſe, or letter. In the which thyng, they dooe no leſſe erre, than the doctoures of the byſſhope of Rome, which in matters of fayth, wyll not admyt the ſcripture to be iudge, but referre al thynges, to theyr interpretation and ſpiritee. Is not this an hygh blaſphemie, that a ſinnefull man ſhoulde preſume, to ſete hym ſelfe iudge, ouer the word and wyl of god? asthough he ought not, to bee obedient vnto it, excepte, he were moued, with his owne ſpiritee, and mocion,

to reiecte, or receiue it. I harde ones a papiſte doctour, openly in a diſputaciō, ſaie: that we, whiche teache the goſpell, dooe teache the truthe, and dyd alowe our teachynge veary well, but that he coulde not, nor durſte ſubſcribe vnto it, exrepte our teachynge were adprobated and alowed, by the biſſhoppe of Rome. Beholde my Symon, what abhominacion is this, that a mortall man ſhulde take vpon hym, to adprobate, & alowe, the diuine and heauenly veritee? and ſet hym ſelfe iudge ouer god? Therfore haue I put this concluſion in the forefront becauſe that the Anababtiſtes, doe for y• moſte parte, boaſt and aduaunce their ſpirite, vnder ſuch pretence, deceiuyng the ſimple and rude people.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  
                     Doeth not Paule teache this, that the letter, doeth kylle, and the ſpirit viuifieth or doeth quieken? ii. Corin. iii And Chriſte doeth ſaie. Ioan. xiiii. The ſpirite ſhall teache you all truthe. It is ſpoken by the lorde alſo, Hieremy. xxxi. Euery man ſhall teache no more his neyghbour, ſaiyng: knowe thou the lorde, but all ſhall knowe hym, from the loweſt, to the hygheſt: Finally, Iohn dooeth ſaie: It is no neede, that euery man dooe teache you, but as the vnction teacheth you of all thinges whiche is true and is no lye. What canſt thou ſaye, agaynſt ſo manyfeſte ſcriptures?
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  To the woordes of Paule I aunſweare thus: That Paul ſpeaketh there of the lawe, whyche

kylleth vs, as he dooeth declare more apertly in the .vii. chap. to the Romains. And by the ſpirit, he vnderſtondeth faith, and the conſolacion or comforte of the goſpell. That, it is ſo, the texte of the whole chapter dooeth teſtifie. Therefore this place helpeth nothyng your errour. For whan we ſpeake of the woorde of god we dooe not vnderſtonde the bare and deade letter, or voyde ſonnde of it. but the word well and truely vnderſtonded, and as it is, in veary dede.
                  And as, for that, that Chryſte dooeth promeſſe a ſpyrite vnto his dyſciples, teachynge them all thynges, wee dooe admytte and beleue it. But that ſpyrite can not bee contrarye to Chryſte, nor teacheth any other

thyng, than Chryſt hath taught Therfore doeth he adde, by and by: teachyng you, what ſo euer, I haue ſaied vnto you. What dooe, theſe thynges perteyne, to the ſpirite of the Anababtiſtes, whiche teacheth contrary thynges to the ſpirite of Chriſte.
                  The prophecies of Ioel, and Hieremye, are vnderſtonded of that ſame ſpirite, that Chriſte dooeth bothe promeſſe and geue to his diſciples, as it is euidently ſene, in the ſeconde chapiter of the Actes, and the eyght, to the Hebrues. Iohn, in his epiſtell, whan he ſpeaketh of the vnctyon, dooeth playnely expounde hym ſelfe, ſaiynge: I haue written vnto you, that ye bee not deceyued (or that, ye dooe not ſuffer your ſelues to be brought in to errour) whyche

thyng, will then come to paſſe, if ye dooe ſtedfaſtely abyde, in the doctrine of the ſpirite, whiche ye haue harde at the begynnynge, and ſwarue not at all, from it. The holy ghoſte is the ſpirite of truthe, which canne neither lye, nor repugne againſt hym ſelfe, beyng all waies conſtaunte, vnchaungeable, euery where, lyke vnto hym ſelfe.
                  Now, no man can denaye, but that the ſame euerlaſtyng, vnchaungeable, and holy ſpirite, hath inſpyred the holy ſcriptures in to holy mens hertes and myndes. Whereby it foloweth neceſſarily, that the ſame ſpirite, which ſpeaketh agaynſte the meanyng of the ſpirite, that dooeth ſpeake and expreſſe hym ſelfe in the diuine ſcriptures, is not of god, but rather an humaine

mayne affection, whyche, if it bee ſtyffe, maie bee deſeruyngly called, a deauelyſſhe ſpyryte, as Chryſte dooeth proue agaynſte the Iues. Iohn. viii. Or canſt thou thynke, in thy mynde, that ſpirite to bee good, whiche contemneth the cleare, manyfeſte, pure and holy ſcriptures? and when by them, he is conuicted of errour, doeth boſte an other ſpirite, whiche ſhoulde teache cleane cōtrary thinges? Is not this to deſpiſe y• ſpirite of y• ſcriptures, and to repugne againſt hym? As though our ſpirit meaneth truely, and the ſpirit of the ſcriptures moſt falſely? Where haue the Anababtiſtes learned, to ſet their ſpirit againſt y• ſcriptures, yea and preferre hym, to the holy worde of god?
               
               
                  Symon.
                  
                     But who hath geuen you this libertee, to iudge al thynges after the litterall ſence or letter?
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  That, we dooe not, as thou doeſt interprete the letter. But we ſaie, that the worde of god, conteined in the ſcriptures of the Bible, is a touche ſtone, wherby ſpirites are tried. For what ſpirite ſo euer doeth agree with the ſcriptures, is of god, the father of truthe. And agayne what ſpirite ſo euer is contrary to the holy ſcriptures, is of the dyuelle, the father of lyes. Seyng therfore, that the ſpyrite of the Anababtiſtes, wil not bee ruled by the holy ſcriptures, but preferreth hym ſelfe, to the woorde of god (callynge by crafte, the woorde of god, a bare letterre) yea and ſette

ſet him ſelfe iudge ouer it, he cā
                     not be of god. For if he were of god, he would come to light and ſpeake that ſame thyng, that the holy ghoſt doeth ſpeake in al the holy ſcriptures. But now, ſith yt he doeth not depende of the ſcriptures, but will be at his own lybertie, it is a token that it is a craft and ſubtiltie of the deuell, whiche doeth alwayes ſcatter & repugne againſt god.
               
               
                  Sy.
                  Thou ſpeakeſt theſe thynges mightily and ſtronglye, but withoute the word of god. And this is your familier cuſtome, to ſpeake many thinges without ſcriptures. As touching the ſpirite, what he techeth, I haue brought and alledged places and teſtimonies oute of the ſcriptures. But that the ſpirit ought to be tried by ſcriptures, or rather mācipated and

bounde vnto them, and not be at his own libertie, it is thy parte for to proue. Or peraduenture thou doſt prefer the creature vnto the creatour.
               
               
                  Ioi.
                  What, and yf I ſhould ſay alſo: My ſpirite hath taught me this thyng. What couldeſt thou do or ſay vnto me?

                  Nor ye do not anſwere ſufficiently, when ye boſt your ſpirite, without or agaynſt the ſcriptures. But in this thīg we do learne, that whan it pleaſeth you, ye vſe the ſcriptures, & agayne whan ye ſee to be expede ent, ye boaſte, aud aduance your ſpirit. Whan I affirme that the ſpirite muſt be tried by the ſcriptures, I doe not mancipate nor ſubdue the creatour vnto y• creature, but I will that the thynge whiche is vncertaine, be tryed &

proued, by yt, which is certaine, and that any ſpirit, be tried, by the holy ſpirit of god, that is to ſaie by the ſcriptures, whether he agreeth with hym ſelf or not. And if he be like euery where vnto him ſelf to be receiued, if not, to be refuſed & reiected, as falſe & deceitful. But whan ye ſpeake of the ſpirite, ye doe vnderſtond a bare creature. For your ſpirit is not the holy ghoſt, but a carnall affection.

                  Ye dooe yet without any ſcriptures of the Bible enhaunce and magnifie, the letter.

For whē we name ye ſcriptures, we doe vnderſtande ye expreſſed worde of yt ſpirit. For as ye voice, or ſound of ye worde, can in no wiſe be ſeparated, from ye lyuely breth of ye liuing creature So ye ſcriptures can not be diuided from ye ſpirit yt inſpireth thē for ye ſcripture, is ye expreſſed wil of god, but now wil I bryng ye teſtimonies & places wt thou requireſt, our lord Ieſu Chriſt, vnto whom ye heuēly father, did geue witnes from heuen, & who hath receiued the holy ghoſt, after no meaſure, did not deſpiſe ye ſciptures, in ſo muche that he dyd

corroborate all his ſaiynges, by them onely, and did commaund that the Iewes ſhould trye both his woordes and factes, by the ſcriptures. Ihon. v. and Luke xvi. He biddeth them to lyfte vp their eyes to Moyſes & the prophetes, and not to apparaunte ſpirites. He reprouyng alſo the Saduceis, did ſhewe that this was the cauſe of their errour, be cauſe that they were ignoraunt in ſcriptures, or neglected them Mark .xii. The Apoſtles (as we may vnderſtand by the booke of the Actes) did receiue abundātly in the beginyng, the holy goſt & that by a ſertaine viſible tokē. And yet not withſtandyng, did thei not therfore forſake or contēne ye ſcriptures, nor boſte their ſpirite againſt thē. But rather did proue & ſtrengthen all their

ſermons, with the worde of god preachyng nothyng els, but the pure and playne ſcriptures. Theſe thynges are euydently proued, by the epiſtels of Peter. Iohn doeth plainely ſhewe and teache that the ſpirites owght, to be tried, whether thei bee of god or not .i. Io. iiii. Wherby, it is euydent enowgh, that ſpirites owght to be tried, and that thei be not ſo free, as the Anahabtiſtes will haue them. And how thei muſte bee proued, it is manifeſtly declared in yt place. Paule whiche was rauiſſhed, in to the thyrde heauen, and dyd learne his goſpel of Ieſu Chriſt, beyng hym ſelfe, the choſen veſſel of god, full of the holy ghoſt, and heauenly wiſedome, neuer the leſſe before the kyng Agrippa, he doeth teſtify, that he dyd

teache nothyng beſide Moiſes, and the prophetes. Act. xxvi. In the epiſtell to the Galathians, ye firſt chapter, he ſaieth thus: if I, or an angel of heauen, ſhulde preach vnto you, any other thīg, then ye haue harde, let it be anathema, or acurſed, He alſo warnyng and teachyng Tymothe, that be ſhoulde beware of falſe and erroneous doctrines, dyd directe and ſende hym, to the redyng of ſcriptures. But reade thou the iii. chapiter of the ſeconde epiſtell, to Tymothe, and it ſhall appere, what we owght to iudge and thynke of the Anababtiſtes ſecte, what of the ſpirite, and of the ſcriptures.
               
               
                  Sy.
                  That place, is knowen well enowghe, and I am almoſt perſuaded. But this vexed my mynde, that Paule ſaieth that

a ſpirituall man, iudgeth all thynges, but he is iudged of no body.

                  I longe to knowe of the, of what ſpirite, Paule doeth ſpeake there.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  But I haue leauer to heare it, of the
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  Conſidre the woordes, yt go before. For he ſaieth thus: We haue not receiued the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit, whiche is of god, that we may know what thynges, haue ben geuen vnto vs by Chryſt.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  But to what purpoſe did Paul ſpeke here, of the holy ghoſt.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  I aſke of the, wheather yt ſame ſelfe ſpirite dyd not inſpyre the ſcriptures.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  Truely, that ſame ſelfe ſpirite.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  Seyng therfore, that it is all one, and bothe the ſame ſpirite, that Paule ſpeaketh of here, and that whiche ſpeaketh in the

ſcriptures, haue I not proued, that Paule, by a ſpirituall man did not vnderſtond hym, which boaſteth, I can not tell, what ſpirite, deſpiſyng in the meane ſeaſon the ſcriptures, but ſuche a ſpirituall man, as is and will be ruled and gouerned by the holy ghoſt, that waie, that he ſheweth and expreſſeth hym ſelfe, in the holy ſcriptures? He therfore that ſtriueth againſte the holy ſcripture and inſpiracyon of the holy ghoſt, can not bee that ſpirituall man, whome Paule doeth ſpeke of. Now, if he be not ſpirituall, he can not iudge, but he muſte be iudged. The Anababtiſtes therfore can iudge nothyng, but ought to bee iudged and tryed, by the worde of god. Hathe not here the ſpirite of the Anababtiſtes loſt bothe his win

ges? But I do remembre other ii. places, whiche dooe vtterly ſtoppe the mouthes of the Catababtiſtes. The firſt is, in the .x. chapiter of the Actes, touchyng Cornelius the centurion, which although he was elected by god, yet not withſtandyng, beyng ſo tawght by the angell, did ſende meſſangers, to fetche Peter, yt he migh heare by hym, the preachīg of our ſauiour Ieſu chriſt. If that, the ſpirite ſhould diſanulle and aboliſſhe the ſcriptures, it ſhulde folow, yt this outwarde preachyng and ſuch like thinges, wer done in vaine. The other is in the .xvi. chapiter, concernyng the Theſſaloniens, whiche after that thei had harde the preachyng of Paule, dyd daily ſeke and ſerche the ſcriptures, to knowe, wheather Paule dyd

teache true or not. Which thing, thei wolde not haue done, if the ſpirites ſhoulde not be tried by the ſcriptures wherefore what ſo euer the Anababtiſtes dooe teache concernyng this thynge, is falſe and erroneous, and not vnlike vnto the errour of Montanus.
               
               
                  Sym.
                  What monſtruous thyng is yt?

                  This Montanus about .xiii. hundred yeres a go, was a great heretike, who did almoſt ſpeake of the ſpirite, as the Anababtiſtes dooe. For thei do cal in again, the old & aboliſſhed errours, as it ſhall appere hereafter.

                  Go forth I praie ye, and let vs diſcuſſe the argumentes of the ſecond concluſion. For I can not beleue that none of the ſaynttes (whiche thyng thou doeſt affirme ſtifly) did thruſte them ſelues, into

the office of common preachers, excepte thei were called. What other thyng is this, but (as the biſſhop of Rome hath done in times paſte) to hyde the truthe frome the commons, that none, ſaue onely thei, that are learned, dare ſpeake and talke of it? Where as, not withſtandynge, god did manifeſt him ſelf to the littell ones and not to the wiſe. Mathew. xi.

                  I will doe it gladly, but I wil firſt confute that, which thou bryngeſt of the learned, & of the ſymple. For it is not conuenient, that I ſhulde paſſe ouer theſe thynges vnſpoken, ſithe that therwith ye doe blynd the eyes of the ſimple and rude people.

                     IS this, to blynde the eies of the ſymple, & rude people, Chryſte hym ſelfe, did ſaie ſo, when he gaue thankes vnto his father, becauſe y• he hath reuelated & ſhewed ſuch high, godly and diuine miſteries, not to the wiſes, but to the litell ones, & to the ſimple. Ma. xi. And againe, he did not choſe learned men but ſimple and idiots, to be his apoſtels .i. Cor. i. Therfore we haue no neede of great learnyng, but the ſimpler that any man is, the more apte is he, to this office.

                  It is manifeſte and euident, that ye vnderſtonde not the woordes

of Chryſt. For if by the ſymple, he ſhulde vnderſtond them, that lacke wiſedome and learnynge (for ſo ye expounde the wordes of Chriſt) truely no man ſhulde be more apt, than fooles and diſerdes, whiche be in dede ignoraunt in all maner of thinges. But euery man dooeth ſee, that it is againſt al reaſon, to thinke any ſuch thyng. Therfore Chriſt vnderſtondeth by ſimplicitee an other thyng.

                  He is called a ſymple man, not he that is without witte, without reaſon and wiſdome, but he whiche is playne and ſincere, and without fraude, he whiche is good, and true inwardly in his herte, beynge without crafte and deceit. Elles it woulde come to paſſe, that euery man ſhoulde defende

his errour, by ignorancie. Whiche thyng, what coulde be elles, but a carnall malice or libertee, wherby euery man woulde begynne and goe about, to boaſte and ſette forthe hs ignorancie, and therewith to defende his errours? Who did euer ſee, ſuche temerarious audacitee, as theſe ſhamefull rennegates dooe vſe? that with theyr ignorancie and rudeneſſe dare defende any thynge? By ignorauncy truely, errours are detected, and not confyrmed.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  Yet, the apoſtels were ignoraunt and vnlearned, nor we dooe not reade, that Chryſt did chooſe any that were learned.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  Truely thei were endued with ſuch ſimplicitee, as we haue ſpoken of afore. But they were not vnlerned and ignoraunt. For they

were familiarly cōuerſant with Chryſte, aboue three yeares, wt Chriſt, I ſay, in whom are, all y• treaſures wiſdō of & knowlage, yea, which is hymſelf, yt eternal wiſedome of y• heauenly father. Of this fountaine drāke they abundantly, by this maiſter, wer thei inſtituted and tawght, and at lengthe were ſo endued, and illuminated with the holy ghoſt that they were 
                        •
                     unnynge in all tonges & ſcriptures. That may be ſene, bothe by their writyngs and alſo by theyr actes. As for that, that thou denaieſt, y• chriſt did call none, whiche were learned, doeſt thou not repugne here agaīſt y• manifeſt truthe? Paull was excedyngly well lerned.
                  Barnabas, Gamaliell, Nicodedemus, & Apollo y• Alexandrian were great clerkes. That in the

meane ſeaſon, I ſhulde paſſe ouer all the other, that is to ſaie, Moiſes, whiche was learned in al the ſciences of the Egipcians Steauen, Eſaie, Timothe, loke better vpon the .xiii. chap. of the firſt epiſtel, to the Corinthians, and vpon the firſt chap. of the epiſtell, to Citus, and thou ſhalt fynde what erudicion and learnynge an ouerſeer or biſſhoppe ought to haue. Therfore, theſe arrogant & preſumptuous Anababtiſtes, can not excuſe nor defende, their impudent ignorancie, by ſimplenes, but that it is alredy manifeſt vnto the world yt they are geuen into a reprobate ſence, as thei, that be not aſhamed, to boaſt, and to ſet forth vnto all men, their ignorancie, in ſtede of good learnynge, as though children, do not ſmel alredy,

their craft & ſubtiltee. But in y• meane ſeaſō, no man ought thus, to interprete our ſaiynges as though we ſhuld ſpeake here, of them, that are falſely, called learned men. For we ſpeake of ſuch, as haue ben taught, by god & to the glory of god. Of whom, there were many, in the primitiue churche, as Pātonus, Tertulian, Cyprian, Lactantius, Auguſtine, and many other.
               
               
                  Sy
                  Thou ſpeakeſte, with good reaſō. For we ought not to think that Chryſte did commend ſuch ſimplicitee, wherby the vnconnynger that a man is, the bolder he ſhoulde be. As many, whiche though thei can ſcarſely reade y• vulgare tonge, yet not withſtandyng, doe without ſhame, ingerate & thruſt them ſelues, in to y• office of preachers, ſtamering

moſt foolyſſhely in the common pulpit, But becauſe thei ſhulde not be founde to bee ignoraunt, in ſome thyng: they begyn firſt to excuſe their ignorancie, with ſuch woordes. Be not ye offended, obretherne, that I am ignorant and vnlearned. For the father, doeth manifeſt hym ſelfe to the ſymple and vnlerned. Finally, ſeyng that Chriſte, doeth promeſſe, to his diſciples ſuche wiſedome, and eloquence, that their aduerſaries, ſhould not be able to withſtond it (where as, on the contrary part, theſe men doe recken their ignorancie, to be a glorious thyng vnto them) I mai eaſily perceiue, that theſe are not ſuche ſimple perſons as Chryſte doeth ſpeake of, but rather ſuch, as doe clothe them ſelues, in ſheapes ſkinnes, faining

them ſelues, to be ſheapes, but inwardely, within theyr hertes, are rauenyng wolues. But now, I praye the, to take that awaye quickely, whyche offendeth me in the ſeconde concluſion.

                     cluſion, y• ſo, it ſhulde not, be iaufull for euery man, to ſpeake and talke of god, thou goeſt far out of the waie, and doeſt not vn derſtond my ſaiynges. I ſpeake of common preachyng, and not of priuate communicacion or talke. For he that taketh vpon hym to be a common preacher, not being called, doeth rauen as he, that maketh hym ſelfe, by his owne authoritee, a kyng or gouernour, makyng & callyng together a particuler Senate or

counſeill, & beginneth thus, of his owne heade, to rule and adminiſtrate the common welthe, commaunding, and forbiddyng what ſo euer pleaſeth him. Truly, no man, can dooe this, but yt he ſhalbe accuſed, not onely of foliſheneſſe & diſobedience, but alſo of tumultee, and high treaſon. Elles, we do not denaie, but yt euery man maie talke of god, yea & maie ſynge of him, accordyng to ye doctrine of Paule .iiii. Epheſy. And the more, yt it is done, the better we alow it. But to ſeparate him ſelf frō y• church to ſeke woods & corners, & there to aſſemble a company, to inſtitute & ordein ſectes and to take vpon them ſelues, beyng vncalled, & vnſent, the office of preachers: not onely, it hath no example, in y• holy ſcriptures, but

hath ben iudged and condemned alwais as heretikall. But we will now, corroborate and ſtrength theſe ſaiynges, with holy ſcripture. In the epiſt. to the Rom. x. chap. Paule teacheth after this maner: who ſo euer calleth vpon the name of the lorde, ſhalbe ſaued. But how can thei call vpon hym, in whome they haue not belued? and how ſhal thei beleue in hym, of whom thei haue not harde? And how can they heare without a preacher? And agayne how ſhal thei prea: the, except thei be ſent? By theſe wordes of Paule, we maie perceiue, that ſendyng is veary neceſſary, whiche doeth not equally pertaine vnto all men. For Paule .i. Corin. xii ſaieth, that there be many giftes. And eauen as the body is one thynge,

and hath many lymmes, which lymmes, though thei belong all to one body, yet neuertheleſſe, haue not all owne offyce, in the body, ſo it is in the churche, and miſticall body of Chryſte. God dyd putte and ordeyne ſome, in the churche, to be apoſtels, ſome to bee prophetes and interpretours of ſcriptures, ſome to bee teachers, ſome to bee poteſtates and rulers, ſumme to haue the giftes of healynge, ſumme to miniſter to the poore, ſumme to gouerne, and ſumme agayne to haue the knowledge of tonges. If ſo bee, that the offyce of teachyng, ſhulde equally perteine vnto al men: Paul would haue ſayed, that god hadde ordeyned all, to bee prophettes, and teachers, but he ſayeth: he hathe ordeyned ſumme to bee

apoſtels. &c. Why dare then the Anababtiſtes preſume ſo much, as for to ſet them ſelues forthe, by their own autoritee, to preache & to teach, againſte the doctrine of Paule? Hebrues .v. No man (ſaieth he) doeth vſurpe, or preſumptuouſli take that honor vnto hym ſelfe, but he, which is called by god, as Aarō, ſo chriſt did not glorifie hym ſelfe to bee made biſſhoppe, but he that ſaied vnto hym. Thou art my ſonne and to daye haue I begotten the. And in an other place: Thou arte a prieſt for euer, after the order of Melchyſedecke. After this maner dooeth Iohn Babtiſte, teſtifye of the miſſion and ſendynge of Chryſte in the fyrſte, and thyrde chapiter of Iohn. And of his owne ſendyng, doeth he hym ſelfe ſpeake,

in the .i. cha. of Iohn, ſaiynge: There was a man ſente by god, whoſe name was Iohn when he was alſo aſked, by what authoritee he did teache and babtize, he did bryng forthe out of Eſaie and Malachie, a teſtimony and witneſſe of his miſſion and ſendyng. So the Apoſtelles were bothe called and ſent, as it appeareth, by the x. and .xxviii. of Mathew, by y• laſt of Mar. and .xx. of Io. Paule doeth teſtifie in y• begynnyng of his epiſtels, and ſpecially in the epiſtell to y• Galathiās, that he was called. In the .xiii. of the Act. he with Barnabas, is ſegregated by the holy ghoſt and ſent to preache. In Moiſes alſo, & in all the prophetes their miſſion and ſendyng is manifeſted. But agaynſt them that dooe renne, beyng not called,

and without ſendyng doe preache, in the .xxiii. of Hieremy, the lorde ſpeaketh thus Thei did renne, but I ſent them not. Therfore, I do thynke, that this concluſion is ſufficiently proued, and that it is manifeſte enough, that the Anababriſtes dooe not in this thyng, behaue them ſelues wel and godly, whiche, thowgh thei be not called, doingerate and thruſt them ſelues, in to the office of preachers Which thyng (as we doe reade) was neuer done by none of the Saintes.

For he dyd promiſe vnto them, to ſende the promiſed ſpirit and comfort our of the father vpon them. And after, that thei had ones receiued the holy ghoſt, with it, thei did receiue, the knowlage of all ſciences, ſpeches, & tongues. Luc. xxiiii. Act. ii. whan Moiſes dyd draw backe, and did bryng many excuſes, knowledgyng hym ſelfe, to bee without vtterance, vneloquent, chyldiſſhe, and vnmete for that offyce, that god

woulde haue ſent hym to: the lord, did promiſe, that he would be in his mouth, as, he dyd alſo promiſe to his apoſtelles, ſuche mouth and wiſedome, that no man ſhoulde bee able to reſyſte agaynſte it. Mathew .x. Paule writynge to Tymothe and Titus, concernyng the election of byſſhoppes, requireth ſuch one, as, is apte to teache, able to exhorte with wholſome doctrine, whyche can reuycte, and confounde them, that reſyſte and withſaie the truthe .i.

Netherto, haue I brought places and teſtimonies out of the ſcriptures, touchyng the learnyng, that ought

to be in an ouerſeer or byſſhop. Now ſhall we heare, what the ſcriptures doe teſtifie and witneſſe concernyng the miracles of them, that are ſent. We dooe therfore alleage here the wonders, that Moyſes did ſhewe, in Egypte and other innnmerable ſignes, and tokens, that bee written in the Actes, the manifeſte impoſicion of handes, and that thei dyd receiue the holy ghoſt viſebly. Moreouer that thei, whiche be ſent, ought to be laufully elected and choſen by a common aſſent, we dooe dryng the firſt chapiter of the Attes, vpon the election of Mathias the vii. and .xiii. of the Actes vpon the election of Steuen Paule and Barnabas. The .xiii. chap. alſo of the Actes doeth manifeſtly ſhewe, that Paule and Barnabas,

when thei had created, thorow all the churches by a generall election prieſtes or ſeniours, laiyng their handes vpon them, and had made theyr praiers with faſtyng, did committe them vnto the lorde, in whome thei had beleued. Now thou ſeeſt, my Symon, that in y• times of the Apoſtels. euery man dyd not raſſhely aduaunce nor ſette for the hym ſelfe to preache. For if it hadde ben ſo, what ſhoulde haue neaded any election, and impoſicion of handes? But election was made after praiers & faſtyng. The ſame is alſo written in the epiſtell to Titus.

Who hathe ſent the authours of this ſecte, to make and congregate a new churche? Truely, amulacion, enuy, ſtrife, contencion, auaryce, ambicion, and ſtiffe pertinacy. I could wel and ſufficiently proue all theſe thynges. except, I ſhoulde here wittyngly, ſpare ſome people.

Their Churche therfore, is not the Churche of God, but a certayne ſecte, and congregacion of ſtyffenecked and diſobedient people, among whom, there is no more iuſt election, then is in the company of rebelles & traytours, whiche forſakyng their owne prince or gouernour, doo retchely, & without aduiſement chuſe, thys man or that man, to be their Capitayne.

Nonatus lykewyſe, & bothe in Affrica. And yet not withſtandynge, none of theim both, was called or ſent by god. And their Churche alſo, were

                  What thynkeſt thou by the ſaiyng of ſ, Paule .i. Corin. xiiii. where he doth geue free libertie, vnto all men to preache, or interprete the Scriptures.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  I am of the ſame ſelfe opinion, that Paule is: Two or three (ſayth he) may ſpeake in the church: Let the other heare and iudge. Finally, if it be reuelated to an other ſyttyng by, let the other holde his peace.
                  And by and by it followeth: For ye may al prophecy, one after another, that all may learne and haue couſolacion.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  By theſe wordes, it appeareth. that Paule dothe not geue libertie to euery man, to preache what he liſteth, whē he nameth ii. or .iii. and byddeth the other

to heare, & to geue attendance to that that the Prophetes (in the newe Teſtament, ſuche, as do expounde the ſcriptures are called Prophetes) do expounde and ſet furthe out of the ſcriptures. Nor he doth not gyue lyſence to the hearers, to interrupte the ſermons of the Prophetes, excepte it be, when any thyng is lefte or peruerſly expounded by the Prophet, or interpretor. By this, it foloweth, that it is not ſemely ne comely, that any mā ſhuld interrupt, if the truthe be ſufficiētly enucleated & ſhewed, muche leſſe, that any man ſhoulde, vnder ſuche pretence and colour ſewe in, or bring in his errors. I doo ſee & perceiue, that the effecte of the matter doeth conſiſt, in thys thyng: If it be neceſſary, if any

thyng be omitted and lefte, by them that are Prophetes, that oughte not to bee omitted, or whiche beynge lefte, maye dooe harme: and agayne, which being ſhewed, may edifi the churche, that then it may be ſhewed vnto them, by any mā, but that, with al ſobreneſſe and charitie. If nothing be wanting or lackynge, all the audience to holde their ptace.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  Thou takeſt the ryght ſenſe of it. For it foloweth by and by: The ſpirite of the Prophetes, is ſubiect to the Prophetes. For God is not the auctor of confuſiō, but of peace. The Holy ghoſt doth not breake furth raſhely, & with affection and ſtryfe, but is treatable: nor he dooeth not ſtyffely contende for euery lyght matter, but ſuffereth him ſelf to be inſtructed,

and taughte: & ſo geueth eaſely place, to him that hathe better vnderſtandyng. But the Anababtiſtes are farre from al ſuch thinges, boaſtyng neuertheleſſe a ſpirit, but as Iudas did boaſt his Apoſtleſhip: ſayut Iames, dyd not without a cauſe, warne vs, ſaiyng: Let not many maſters be among you, knowynge that we ſhall receyue greatter dampnaciō or iudgement, that is to ſay: we that are teachers.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  But here thou haſte brought me into a greter dout: For now I aſke the: Whether of theym two▪ is greatter, the Prophet. vnto whom the ſpirit is ſubiect, or the ſpirit? If thou ſayeſt, that man is gretter, then the ſpirite, beware that thou doeſt not attribute to much to a mortall and frayle man. If the

ſpirite is hygher, how can that thyng, which is gretter, be ſubiecte to a thyng, that is leſſe. If ſo bee, that thou preferreſt the ſpirite vnto men, & agayne wyll haue the ſaiyng of Paule to be true, I do not perceiue, by what reaſon it can ſtande. Or howe can a man be greatter, then the Spirite, whiche maketh hym a Prophet?
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  Thou dooeſt aſke righte well this queſtion. But it is to be noted, that Paul doeth not here take the ſpirite for the holy ghoſt, whiche is the thyrde perſone in trinitie, but for the gyfte & operacion of the ſpirite of God. The ſenſe and meanyng of this place, is therfore, that the gyfte of prophecy, is ſo in the power of the Prophet, that hath it, that he maye bothe ſpeake, & holde his peace,

in the congregacion of the ſayntes, when, and as long, as it is expedient for the hearers. For they are not ſo inſtructed and moued, with the ſpirit, as mad, and phantaſticall men are, that they ſhoulde all cryout at once, with an vnſemely clamor, murmuryng one agaynſt another, with a debatefull contencion & ſtryfe: For ſo, one coulde not vnderſtande another. The ſpirite of God is gentle, treatable. and peaſable, not ſtirrynge or mouyng any man to contenciō, and debate, but to peace and vnytie. Wherfore he ſayeth: ye may Prophecy all, one after another. To the which expoſiciō, Theophilactus, agreith, interpretynge this place, after thys maner: The ſpirite, that is to ſay, the grace of the holy ghoſt,

which is in thee, the operacion or workyng, that hath inuaded thee, is ſubiecte to the gyfte or grace of another man, which is moued to Prophecy, that is to ſay, dothe geue place & hearing. But now, if thou be ſo pleaſed, let vs go aboute the thirde Concluſion.

Or is there any man, that can ſay the contrarye?

                  Thou dooeſt writhe and wreſt the wordes of Chriſt: For he ſpeaketh nor theſe wordes of his Churche, that they ſhoulde diſagree within themſelues, as the Anabaptiſtes do moue tumulte, in thoſe churches, where Chriſt and the Goſpell is preached ſincerely, but doth expres the nature of the infidels, whiche doo perſecute the faythfull. For, wherſoeuer Chriſt is preched, they that are godly, do receyue and embrace him gladly: and they that are vngodly, doo bothe let and perſecute Chriſt and his Diſciples. Now Chriſt doth cal this diſcenciō a ſword: which ſworde is not among the godly in the Churche: but the infidels do vſe it agaynſt them that ar godly. Dothe not Eſaie ſay, that there is no peace to the

vngodly. The cogniſaunce or badge of them that ar godly, is Charitie, Peace, and Concord. Wherfore, the Lorde, dothe call them, that be peaſable, or loue peace, bleſſed, and chyldren of God. Mat. v.

                  I do eaſely graunte, that peace and vnitie ought to be, in the Church. But that Chriſt, and hys Apoſtles dyd neuer moue ſediciō for temporall thynges, thou doeſt affirme it ſcantly.

                  In the .xv. chap. of the Actes, we do reade that Paule and Barnabas, had no ſmall diſcencion, and reaſonyng agaynſt them, which dyd teache Circumſicion. Who wyll deny, circumciſion to be an outwarde thyng?

                  I vnderſtande & call outward thynges,

that dooe helpe nothyng to our ſaluacion, perteining to the body, more, then to the ſoule, and which being neceſſari to the body, do, in proceſſe of tyme, waxe olde, waſte, and conſume away, ſuche as be, condicion, rycheſſe, and groſſe elementes of thys worlde. But circumciſion, was not taught by the falſe prophetes, as an outwarde thyng, but as a neceſſary & needeful thyng to ſaluacion: which thei dyd very vrgently and inſtantly perſuade, that it ſhoulde bee obſerued & kepte, yea, and all the whole law beſyde. Hereof, dyd ryſe the diſputacion, whche is written of, in the xv. chap. of the Actes Els Paule dyd circumciſe, Timothie, for peace and tranquilitie ſake, and becauſe that he woulde not offende certayne

weake bretherne, in the Churche: but after that, ſome men dyd vrgently bring in, circumciſon, as neceſſary, Paule dyd greatly repugne, & woulde not ſuffer Titus to be circumcized .xvi. of the Actes .ii. Galat. This ſediciō therfore that thou aledgeſt here, hathe a greatter cauſe, then an outwarde thyng.

                  Howe dareſt thou call richeſſe outwarde thinges, which do exclude a mā from the kyngdome of Heauen? For Chriſt ſayeth that it is eaſyer for a camell, to go thoroughe the eye of a nydle. then for a ryche man to entre into the kyngdome of Heuen.

                  We doo know well inoughe the falſe ſighynges and teares of the Crocodyle, which, theſe light and inconſtant Anababtiſtes, do poure doune daily,

diſpiſynge richeſſe, none other wyſe, then the Foxe, dyd in tymes paſt diſpyſe, the ſweete grapes, that ſhe could not come by. Richeſſe, are by them ſelues nether good, nor euyll, but the vſe, dothe make theim either good, or euyll. If thyne eye be ſimple, and lyghtſome, all the body ſhal be lyghtſome: but if thyne eye be wycked and euyll, all thy body ſhall be darkeneſſe. Mat. vi. Therfore, if a riche mā be faithfull and godly, the richeſſe that he hathe, be good, and that, by reaſon of the good vſe. If the maſter or owner of the richeſſe, is vnfaythful or an infidell, his richeſſe are nought. Luke .xvi. Such, do chriſt ſpeake of, when he bringeth in, the ſimilitude of the camell. and of the eye of the nedle. There wer innumerable,

bothe in the olde & newe Teſtament, whiche, in great richeſſe were called no ſmall frendes of God: as Noe, Abraham, Lot, Iſaac, Iacob. Iob, Ioſeph, &c. Whiche in the myddeſt of their rycheſſe, dyd cleaue vnto God, with a ſincere harte, and good fayth. Loke what opiniō Paul hathe of this thyng, and what he writeth of it .i. Timoth. vi. Therfore, I care not what theſe hipocrites doo bable and prate, ſith that the richemen may doo good to the poore, in Chriſtes Churche, whiche occaſion they that haue no richeſſe doo lacke. To what purpoſe or intent doo then theſe mad braines, trouble all the worlde for trifelyng and vnneceſſary thyngꝭ? I do know ſum, which, if thei had as much as they do lacke, thorough their

owne negligence and ſlugherdneſſe, they woulde fynde by and by a way, to iuſtify their vniuſt and euyll gotten goodes.

                  That Chriſt dyd neuer cauſe tumult, for outwarde thynges, but dyd alwayes ſtudy to peace & tranquilitie, we wyl bring the .xvii. of Mathew, where he ſpeaketh to Peter after this maner: Leſt we do offēd them (that is to ſay, that do receyue the didragme) go thy waye to the ſea, & caſt in, thy hoke, and the fyrſt fyſh that cometh, open his mouth, & thou ſhalt fynde a ſtater, take it and geue it for the & me. In the. xxii of Math, when he was aſked, of the yearely tribute, that was

payed vnto Ceaſar, he did ſo fly from tumulte, that he dyd iyone bothe god and Ceaſar togither, biddyng them to pay their duty to eche of them. Nor, he dyd not condempne them, that dyd receyue. Nor agayne he dyd not ſay: Bleſſed are they, which doo geue. He dyd not ſay: ye owe nothyng by Goddes law, but notwithſt andyng geue: wo be, vnto hym, that dothe receyue. In the .xiii. of Iohn, Chriſt doth ſo teache hys Diſciples: I geue you a new cōmaūdement, that ye loue eche other, as I haue loued you. By this, ſhall all men know that ye be my Diſciples, if ye loue eche other. And incontinent in that long ſermon that he made vnto his Diſciples, after his Maundy, he doth chefely ſpeake of the Spirite of the

faythfull. And a lytell afore, he ſhoulde ſende his Apoſtles, he dyd ſaye: Peace vnto you, as my father hathe ſent me, ſo I ſende you. The .xiiii. chap. Rom. Paule ſayeth: The kyngdome of God, is neyther meate nor drinke, but rightouſneſſe, peace and gladneſſe in the holy ghoſt. For, he that ſerueth vnto chriſt in thoſe thyngꝭ, is accepted both before GOD, and before men. Therfore, let vs followe that, whiche belongeth to peace, and edifieng, one towarde another. In the .i. Cor. i. he dothe exhorte the Corinthiās, after this maner: I beſeche you, brethren, in the name of oure Lorde Iheſu Chriſt, that ye dooe ſpeake all one thyng, and that there be no diſſenciōs among you, but that yee bee one whole bodye, of one

mynde & opinion. Let no ſuche contenciōs be among you, that one ſhoulde ſay: I am Cephas diſciple, another, I am Pauls: an other, I am Chriſtes. Is Chriſt diuided: was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptiſed, in the name of Paule? When ye do ſay ſo, ar ye not yet carnal? Moreouer, loke, & conſider what Paul writeth in the xii. cha. to the Cori. exhortyng them to concorde & charitie, by the exemple of the body and the lymmes. In the .xiiii. he ſayeth apartelye, that God is not aucthor of diſcencion, but of concorde and peace, whiche thyng may be ſene, in the Churches of the faythfull. In the .iiii. to the Epheſians, Paule doeth exhort vs, to behaue oure ſelues, and walke ſo, as it doeth become the

vocacion wherwith, we are called, with all obeiſaunce & lowlyneſſe, with gentlenes of hert, forbearing eche other thorough charitie, and that we ſhoulde ſtudye to kepe the vnitie of the ſpirite by the bounde of peace, beyng (ſayth he) one body & one ſpirite, as yee are called in one hope, of your vocacion. There is but one Lorde, one fayth, one Baptiſme, one God and father of vs all▪ &c. In the▪ ii. chap. to the Philippians, with lyke ſtudy, exhorteth he, the faythfull to be of lyke affection, to haue betwene them ſelfes, loue & charitie, to be of lyke mynde & lyke iudgement, and that nothyng ſhoulde be doone among them, by contencion or vayneglorye. But by humilitie & lowlyneſſe of hearte, euerye man ſhoulde

thynke an other mā, to be more excellent, then he is himſelf. &c. Are not theſe, ſufficient teſtimonies?

                  Io.
                  Very much, for thei proue and ſhew manifeſtli, that the Anabaptiſtes be authors of tumulte and ſedicion.

                  Ioi.
                  That is to ſay, that they againſt al good ordre, and exemple of the Apoſtles, dooe make ſtryfe & contencion in the Churche of Chriſt, & that only for certayne outwarde trifles.
               
               
                  Sy.
                  But they doo teache many thynges of God and of faythe. What outewarde thynges are they, wherfore they do make diuiſion in the Churche?
               
               
                  Ioi.
                  If they ſhoulde preache none other thyng, but of God, of faith, charitie and innocencye of lyfe, it

ſhould be no neede of this ſeperacion. For theſe thynges are taught alſo in our Churches. ſo that it is no neede at all, that they ſhoulde preache. But they ſeperate them ſelues therefore, becauſe that they teache theſe thyngꝭ hereafter reherſed, that is to ſaye: That we haue neede of a new Baptyſme, and that a Chriſten man may not receyue rentes, nor reuenewes: That Chriſten men are free frome paiyng of tythes: That a chriſten man may not beare rule or be a maieſtrate: That no man is boūde to make a lawful othe, when he is commaunded, by the maieſtrates: And alſo they doo take away richeſſe from chriſtē men.

trouble the Churche? Beſyde that, they doo bynde their diſciples, that they ſhall not heare the worde of God among them, where Baptyſme of chyldren is vſed, rentes and tythes payed, any lawfull othe is made, magiſtrates be, & richeſſe ar counted good. Nowe call in remembraunce, the places and teſtimonyes, that we haue brought and aledged afore, of Chriſt, & of his Apoſtles, & ponder well, whether this ſeperation, is Apoſtolicall, or ſedicious.

                  It ſkylleth not that ye cal them ſedicious. For that dyd chaunce to Chriſt, and to his Apoſtles, to be accuſed of tumulte & ſedicion. But in this thyng, they do prayſe God, and geue thankes, that they be counted worthy, to ſuffer for the name of Ieſu, remembring

what Chriſt ſayeth: Bleſſed are ye when men dooe curſe you, and ſpeake all euyll againſt you, reioice and be glad, for your reward is great in heuen.

                  Lying (ſayth he) for my ſake. That we dooe call the Anabaptiſtes ſedicious, it is not doone for Chriſtes ſake, but becauſe, that they do diuide Churches beyng well ordered and pacified, for the thinges afore named. The which thyng neuer Chriſt nor his Apoſtles dyd. Nor we doo not lye, when we accuſe them of tumulte, and ſedicion. For the thing is ſo manifeſt, that it can not be denyed. But they that imputed ſuche

thinges to Chriſt, and to his Apoſtles dyd lye, and dyd not ſay trewe, as it appeareth by the xxiii. of Luke, the .xvi. & .xxiiii. of the Actes. There were ſome which dyd falſely reporte, that they preached agaynſt paiyng of Tribute, vnto Ceaſar, ſeducyng the cōmens, and mouyng ſedicion, whiche thynges were not true. For neither chriſt, nor his Apoſtles dyd it, but rather taught the contrary alwayes. But the Anabaptiſtes, becauſe, that they repugne againſt publike magiſtrates or rulers, and go aboute to abolyſſhe the ordinance of God, are ryghtfully called tumultuous, rebels and ſedicious heretikes.

Thou ſeeſt, my Symon, the nature of heretikes, whiche is, to make diuiſion in the Churche, to get vnto them diſciples, or folowers of their hereſye, not to ſpare the flocke, to ſowe diſcorde, to teache peruerſe thynges, to allure men, to reyſe or ſtyr vp partes, ſectes, & factions, to congregate a particuler Churche.

Where as, they haue made an innumerable ſorte of mē ſo perplexed and doubtfull, that they do abhorre from the goſpell & do beleue neither vs, nor them. Paule did more lyuely expreſſe them, that do diſceyue & ſeduce the people with fayre ſpeakyng, ſeruyng to their belyes, in the iii▪ chapiter to the Philipenſes, with theſe wordes: For many do walke, of whom I haue ſpoken many tymes, and now doo ſpeake weeping, enemyes of the croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe ende is perdicion, whoſe belye is their God, and glorie or reioyſyng, in their opprobriouſneſſe: Which do care for earthly thyngꝭ only.

Moreouer, of theſe thynges, that they do teache, tumultes, ſediciōs, warres, robbyng and ſpoilyng, dyd alwayes ryſe. I thynke thou doeſt vnderſtande, whom Paule

dothe call belyes, and enemyes of the croſſe of Chriſt.

And what other thyng do the Anabaptiſtes, but for the weakeneſſe, or (as they doo ſay) for the wyckedneſſe or vngodlyneſſe, of ſome, forſake the Churche▪ and exhorte other to dooe the ſame.? But let vs come now to the .iiii. concluſion,

which ſhall ſhew playnly, that the Anabaptiſtes are falſe prophetes, & enemyes of the Croſſe of Chriſt.

                  They are falſe prophetes, whoſoeuer they be, that doo affirme, that Chriſt dyd only aboliſh & take away, originall ſyn. They are falſe Prophetes, that do deny grace, & forgyueneſſe of ſynnes vnto them: which, after that the truthe is once knowen, do fall agayne, into ſinne or error. They are falſe Prophetes, that do attribute, ſaluaciō, vnto our workes. Syth that the Anabaptiſtes do teach theſe articles, thei be not only enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt, but more ouer do denye Chriſt.

Is not all one thyng, if a man ſhould ſay Chriſt is not. And there is no ſuche thynge, wherefore Chriſt dyd come? Chriſt dyd come to take away our ſynnes, whiche thyng if he dyd not, Chriſt is not Chriſt. If he be dead onely for them, that were in the old teſtament, and not for vs, he can not bee our ſauiour, and how is he then Chriſt? If ſo be that our workes, do ſaue vs, is he not dead in vayne? Doeſt thou not ſee, how the enemyes of the Croſſe are knowen?

awaye the ſynne of the worlde. By theſe & other wordes of the ſcripture. it is manifeſtly proued, that Chriſt is the full ſatiſfaction, for the ſynnes of all the worlde. Or canſt thou ſay, that the fathers of the old Teſtamēt are onely the worlde.

By the worlde, he vnderſtandeth, whatſoeuer is worldly: ſo by this word ſinne, he vnderſtandeth, all that can be named ſynne, the gender beynge here put, for the ſpecies. For he ſayeth, which taketh away, and not, which hath taken away, or ſhall take away, that this word Tollit, taketh away, may ſignifye action or doyng & not tyme. For what ſynnes ſoeuer are taken

away, they ar taken away, by the ſacrifice of Chriſt, done in the Croſſe.

                  This aucthoritie is bothe playne & ſtrong inough. Nor it can not be ſubuerted, by any contradiction. But that thou mayeſt ſee, that we ar not without auctorities. Reade the .v. to the Roma. and thou ſhalt vnderſtand, and perceyue, that the vertewe of the death of Chriſt, is abolyſhed by you. And not as bi one mā (ſaith ſaynt Paul) which had ſinned, death dyd come: ſo is the gyfte of GOD. For iudgement, dyd come, by one ſynne to condemnacion, and the gyfte dyd come, to iuſtify frō many ſynnes. Do not theſe woordes, O Symon,

prooue, that Chriſt with hys death, dyd not clenſe or pourge onely one ſynne, but all maner of ſynnes? But reade all the whole chapiter, and then, thou ſhalte vnderſtande it better.
                  Paule ſpeaketh of Chriſt in the ii. chap. to the Colloſſen. after this maner: And you (ſayth he) when yee were dead thoroughe youre ſynnes or in the prepucie or vncircumciſiō of yourfleſh, he hath quykened alſo with him forgyuyng vnto vs all our ſynnes. Becauſe that in him dothe inhabite all plenitude or perfection of God head corporally and ye are made perfect in him. Which thyng, truly, coulde not be, if he had not waſhed vs clene frō all our ſynnes. But the contrary is euidently knowen, by the .x. chap to the Hebrues. He

(ſayth ſaynt Paule) one oblacion beynge offered for ſynnes, ſitteth euerlaſtīgly on the right hande of God the Father. For with one oblaciō, he hath made perfecte for euer, them, that are ſanctified .i. Ioh. i. The blood of Chriſt, dothe clenſe vs, from all our ſynnes .i. Io. ii. If any man dothe ſynne, we haue an aduocate, before the father, that righteous Lorde Ieſu Chriſt. And he is the ſatisfaction for oure ſynnes, and not onely for oure ſynnes, but for the ſynnes of all the worlde. If Chriſt dyd take away, onely original ſynne, the teſtimonye and aucthoritie of Ieſu, is voyde. And agayne, if Chriſt dyed not for vs, but for them only that were after hym: what belongeth vnto vs, the death of Chriſt. Or why ſhould

we confeſſe it, if it perteyneth nothyng vnto vs? Doeſt thou not ſee yet, who are falſe Prophetes, enemyes of the croſſe of Chriſt, and ſubuerſers of the Chriſten fayth?

For that which Paule in the▪ vi. chap. to the Hebrues, and Peter in the ii. chap. of his ſecond Epiſt. doo write, dothe not ſtrengthe nor proue the oppinion of the Anababtiſtes, but that there is no remiſſion for them, whiche doo ſwarue frome the faythe, and thorow miſbeleue or infidelitie do diſpayre of the mercy of god. For they doo ſynne agaynſt the holy goſt, whiche ſyn is not forgyuen here, nor in the worlde to come, as Chriſte teacheth. Mat. xii. & .i. Iohn .v. But, my Symon, diſcuſſe thou and wey, the wordes, of bothe the Apoſtles,

and conſider to what purpoſe they were ſpoken. Truly for this purpoſe, to proue, that it is impoſſible for hym, that hath beleued ones perfectly, to falle away from his fayth. Peter, with the other diſciples, being aſked of chriſt, whether thei woulde, forſake hym alſo, dyd anſwere. Lord, to whom ſhould we go? thou haſt the wordes of euerlaſtyng lyfe. And we dooe know and beleue, that thou art the ſonne of the lyuyng God. If ſo be, that any man dothe fall cleane from fayth, he doth ſhew manifeſtly, that he had neuer a true fayth. They went from vs (ſayth Iohn) but they were not of vs: for if they had ben of vs, truly they ſhoulde had remayned with vs. He therfore, that ſwarueth from the knowē faith

hathe no ſaluacion. But why? For Chriſt is the onely ſaluaciō frome whome he doothe falſely ſwarue, and therfore can fynde no other ſaluacion. Thou doeſt vnderſtande, I thynke, that the falle, whereof Paull ſpeaketh, is not the fall, that doth chaūce daily, by thinfirmitie & weakeneſſe of the fleſh in them, that are godly, but extreme deſperacion thorough miſbeleue & infidelitie, wherby a mā ſwarueth from God. Reade the .vii. &. viii to the Heb. and thou ſhalte ſee, that daily remiſſion of ſynnes, is not denyed vnto them that ar fallen agayne. For he ſayeth alſo, in the .v. cha. that Chriſt is a biſſhoppe, that can haue compaſſion, of our infirmities, vnto whom we muſt flye, hauyng lycence & libertie, to do it .x. chap.

                  In the .xii. chap. Paule teacheth. that Eſau coulde fynde no place of repentaunce, thoughe he dyd ſeke it with teares.
               
               
                  Ioia.
                  Paule doth not ſpeake in this place, of repentaunce, and forgyueneſſe of ſynnes. but of election, and recouering of his firſt birth which he had loſt ones, thorough glotony, and intemperance, and could neuer recouer it agayne, though he had aſſaied & proued it, with wepynges and teares. for Iacob had bought the right of the firſt borne. and had preuented him. Wherfore he ſpeaketh nothyng heare, of the inwarde remiſſion of ſinnes. And often tymes, thys woorde penaunce is taken in an other ſignificaciō. But the Cathariās dyd vſe the ſame argumentes,

in ſo muche, that ſome weake perſons, among them, that wer godly. dyd abhorre, & ſuſpecte the Epiſtle to the Hebrues, as ſome do now a dayes the Epi. of ſaynt Iames. But now I come to the auctoritie of Peter, who ſpeaketh after this maner: It had ben better for them▪ not to haue knowen the waye of righteouſneſſe, then after that they haue knowen, to tourne from that, that was taught them by the holye precepte. But that chaunceth vnto theim, that is wont to be ſpoken in a true prouerbe: A dogge goynge to his vomittyng (or to that which he had vomitted) agayne: And a waſhed ſow, beyng retourned to the myre wallowyng or walteryng. If thou conſidereſt well & truly theſe wordes, thou ſhalt

fynde that they be ſpoken of infidelitie, and vnfaythfulneſſe. From the which, after that thei wer ones called, through faith, they dyd fall agayn from God, into the fyrſt vnfaythfulneſſe & infidelitie. We doo ſet therfore that infidelitie is condempned euery where.

                  What ſayeſt thou of this, that thei do affirm that we liue no more in the fleſh
               
               
                  Io.
                  The fleſh dothe ſtycke vnto vs, to the verye graue. For the fleſh doth contrary, the ſpirite, and agayne, the ſpirite doth repugne agaynſte the fleſh, in ſo moche that we doo that, whiche we woulde not do, the Rom. the vii. It is therfore great boldeneſſe, to preſume & boaſt of that, whiche the Apoſtles dyd neuer preſume 
                        ••
                      boaſt of. For Paule did complain of his fleſh, which

hath more ſpirite, & dyd labour more, to tame his fleſh, then all the Anababtiſtes. And yet they dare ſay, that they be not in the fleſh. For this cauſe peraduenture, becauſe that they be, none other thyng but fleſh, that is to ſay, all carnal, drouned in their ſenſualitie & affections. Which thyng is manifeſtly knowen, by their lyfe. But paul did cōclude all thys whole matter, more perfectly, & more briefly alſo, ſaiyng: I do, with my mynde, obey and ſerue vnto the lawe of god, but with my fleſh, vnto the law of ſynne. He doth more, at large expounde theſe thynges, in the .viii. Rom. and v. Galat. Where he dothe ſhewe, in fewe wordes▪ that they, which do not feare God, nor rare, for heauenly thynges, but are all earthly, do lyue after the fleſh. And that

he walketh in the ſpirite, or after the ſpirite, which though he hath, & feeleth in him ſelf, ſinne, and weakeneſſe of the fleſh, beyng tickeled with ſenſualitie, & affections, yet not withſtādyng, dothe not geue the bridell, vnto the fleſh, ne vnto ſynne, but reſiſteth ſtyll, and is alwayes a frayde to fall. And if ſo be, that he chaunceth to fall, by and by, draweth he backe his foote, and repentyth.

For where ſynne is not, there is no grace, where preuaricacion and tranſgreſſion is not, there is no Remiſſion amonge them, there is no tranſgreſſion, ergo, the grace of God, is not a mong them. Is not this, to aboliſh the grace of God? What ſhall I ſaye, but that theſe mad braynes, do fal into another hereſye, that is to ſaye, in to the hereſy, of that blaſphemous mā Pelagius, who dyd denye the grace of God, magnifiyng and extollyng the ſtrengthe of man.

                  Io.
                  Chriſt ſaieth vnto the Iues: If ye do not beleue, ye ſhal dye, in your ſynnes, Ergo, vnfaythfulneſſe is a deadly ſynne or ſyn to death. And though a faythful beleuer, is without this ſyn, that is to ſay, without infidelitie, yet he is not without vyce or ſyekeneſſe, which he muſt be ware of always, leſt he be drouned

in ſyn. or ſoiled & defiled wt the abhominable fylthyneſſe of ſinnes: & therfore it followeth in Iohn: We do know, that all that is borne of god, ſineth not: but he that is borne of god, doth kepe himſelf, & theuyll toucheth him not. So therfore the godly ſineth not: & though he falleth by frailnes, yet notwithſtāding that malicious Satan can not catche him. For the diligent ſtudy & labor, that the godly dothe take, in ſhunnynge & auoidyng ſynne (that is to ſay faith) doth that ſyn is not imputed for ſyn. It is written in the .viii. Rom. That ther is no condemnacion vnto thē that be in chriſt, which do not walke after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit. Els ſaint Iohn doth ſay in the ſame ſelf epiſtle: If we do ſay, we haue no ſyn, we deceyue our ſelfꝭ, & truth is not

in vs. If we do cōfeſſe our ſines god is both faithful & rightwiſe to forgeue vs our ſinnes, and to clenſe vs from our iniquitie. If we do ſay, we haue no ſynne, we make him a lier, & his worde, is not in vs. There be many ſuche places euery where in the ſcriptures. Dauid doth crye out: O Lorde, do not enter into iudgement, with thy ſeruaunt, for in thi ſight, no mā ſhalbe iuſtified. And agayne, if thou lookeſt extremely vpon our ſynnes, o lord who is able to abyde it? In the xliii. of Eſa. the lord doth ſpeke thus, by the Prophet, vnto the Iues, which dyd glorify & boaſt them ſelues in the rightwyſnes of ye law. I am he, I am he (ſaith y• lord) that taketh away thyne iniquities, for myne owne ſake, & wyll not remembre thy ſines.

Bring me into remembraunce, let vs be iudged together, telle furth if thou haſt any thyng, to iuſtifie thy ſelfe. Thy father hath ſynned fyrſt, and thyne interpreters haue gone out of the way. None of the moſt holy men were euer without ſinne, which thyng manifeſtly appereth, in Adam, Noe, Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Moyſes, Aaron `Dauid Ioſias, Ezechias, Peter, Paul, Matew. &c. Therfore Iob ſpeaketh truly. Iob .ix. What am I, that I ſhould anſwer him, and ſpeake with him, with my wordes, which though I had ſome rightwyſneſſe, wyl not anſwer, but entreate my iudge. If I wyll iuſtifye my ſelfe, my mouth ſhall condemne me: if I ſay that I am innocent, my mouth ſhall proue me wicked. &c. Paule in

the .iii. Rom. ſayeth, that al men haue ſined, & do want the glory of god. In y• .xiii. of Ihon, chriſt ſayeth, he that is waſhed hath no neade, but to waſh his feete: for he is all cleane. If he be all cleane, what neade hathe he, to waſh his feete? If he hath neade to waſh his feete, how can he be all cleane? Therfore we ar clenſed & purified, with the blood of Chriſt, that was ſhed vpon the croſſe, from the filthines of ſyn, & be all cleane, But it followeth not by this, that we be no more i the fleſh, or that we be no more ſynners. For the dregges of ſyn do remayne in our feete, that is to ſay, in our affections, as long as we liue, & walke in this duſt i and foule way, we are ſoyled & contaminated, with the filthyneſſe of ſynne, which we neade,

with perpetuall ſtudy and daily care, to waſhe awaie, and afterwardes, to wype out, theſe filthineſſes, with gret inward grefe repentaunce, and teares, in the vertue of the paſſion and death of Chryſt. Finally chriſt, in the .xv. of Iohn ſaieth: I am the trewe vine, and my father is the huſbande man. He doeth take awaie euery bough in me that bringeth forth no fruite, & euery bowgh y• bryngeth for the fruite, he doeth purge & make cleane, that he mai bryng forth more fruite. By the which ſaiynges we maie vnderſtande, ye we that are in Chriſt, thorowe faith, as a bowgh, is in y• vine, & doo bryng forth fruite, liuyng godly, haue neuertheleſſe nede to be made cleane, and that, by the ſpirit, and vertue of Chriſt.

Now, ye, which is made cleane, muſt nedes to be vnpure, & vnclene? So we, that ar in Chriſt alredy ar made clene daily, for we do offend in many thinges, and no man is liuyng, that ſinneth not, and that hath no nede of this clenſyng. Except the Anababtiſtes, whiche in their hathe, be made ſo pure & clene, by their water, wherwith thei do waſh their diſciples, among whom, water doeth take awaie that, which the blood of Chriſt doeth not take awaie in them, that are godly.
               
               
                  Sy.
                  I do not ſee yet proued, that he, which falleth againe, after that he hath knowen the truthe, doeth daily fynd grace & pardon.
               
               
                  Io.
                  It is ſufficientli proued by y• ſaiyngs of Iohn, and by the exemple of Dauyd, and of Peter. For if

we be all ſynners, and yet neuertheleſſe doo entre, into the kyngdome of heauen, where no vncleane thing entreth, it foloweth that our ſynnes are forgyuen vs.
               
               
                  Sy.
                  I do not denay, but that we were ones all ſynners, & that thoſe ſynnes were ones forgyuen vs, by Chryſte. But I will ſaie this, that after that the ſynnes, which we committed before, thorow ignorā
                     cye, be ones, thorow the grace of God forgyuen vs, and ſo bee receaued by the free gyfte and goodneſſe of Chriſt, in to y• numbre of the chyldren of god, that then we be pure holy, and clene, and that we ought to ſynne no more, and that, if we ſynne wittyngly, after that we haue ones knowen & receaued the grace, ſuch ſinne is not forgiuen.
               
               
                  Io.
                  
                     But thou mighteſt, ſufficiently vnderſtand by the places afore aledged▪ that we be yet ſinners ſtyll, after that we haue knowen the truthe, and that thoſe ſinnes, which we do daily commit as long, as we ar in Chriſt 
                        •
                     e daily forgyuen vnto vs. For Chryſte ſaieth, that his diſciples, are all cleane, but neuertheleſſe that thei haue neade to waſhe their fete. And again, the father dooeth make cleane the bowghes, that doo bring forth fruite in Chriſte. If thei dooe bryng forth fruit, thei do bring forth fruite, in faith, and in the knowen truthe (for without faith, it is impoſſible, that any man ſhulde pleaſe God, & what ſo euer is without faith, is ſīne and not fruit) If thei be made cleane, thei haue ſome filthines

in the knowen truthe. Els thei ſhulde be cleane, and ſhuld nede no clenſynge or purgynge. But ſith that thei be made clene, the filthineſſes that thei do gather in bringyng forth fruit, ar forgeuen and waſhed awaie. Neither Pelagius, nor Nouatus, nor none of the Anababtiſtes, is able to withſtand this veritee.
               
               
                  Sy.
                  I am not farre frome this opinion, yet notwithſtanding, had I leuer to heare plain ſcriptures, that a man, maie come to grace, as often, as he ſynneth.
               
               
                  Io.
                  And that can I ſhew vnto the, beſyde, the fore aleged places. The lorde ſpeaketh thus by Ezechiell: When the vngodly ſhall turne from y• vngodlines, that he hath done, & doeth iudgement & rightwiſneſſe, he ſhall get life vnto his

ſoule. Is the death of ye vngodly, a pleaſure vnto me, ſaieth y• lorde, and not rather, that he turne from his waies and liue? Turne and repent from al your iniquitees, and your iniquitee ſhall not hurt you. In the .ii. of Ioel. Turne to ye lord your god (ſaieth he) for he is gentill, and piteful, he is pacient, & of great mercifulnes, & repenteth vpon y• plage, yt he had threatened.
               
               
                  Sy
                  That, whiche thou haſt aleged, is to be vnderſtanded of the vngodly, & of y• remiſſion of ſinnes yt is graunted vnto them, that neuer knew god, & neuer beleued in him.
               
               
                  Io.
                  I wold y• thou ſhuldeſt loke better vpon y• wordes of Ezechiell, thou ſhuldeſt ſe, yt he ſpeaketh theſe woordes to y• children of Iſraell, whiche were the choſen people of god.

Moreouer conſidre, with what ende, he dooeth conclude this chapiter. Why ſhoulde ye dye (ſaieth he) o ye houſe of Iſrael, I wyll not the death of a ſinner but y• hereturn & lyue. Or canſt thou returne to hym, with whō thou waſt neuer before?
               
               
                  Sy.
                  No, but I doo come to hym, and do not returne, but with whom I was afore, and from whome I was gone, to hym doo I return againe.
               
               
                  Ioi.
                  Ergo it foloweth, that they, which are exhorted, by the prophete, to returne to god, were ſomtymes with god. If thei were ſometymes with god: ergo this is not the fyrſte ſinne, that thei did committe, afore that thei knew the truthe but it was the ſynne, that thei committed, after that thei knew the truthe and had faith.

We haue proued, I thynke, that the ſynnes that we cōmit after the knowledge of the truth, are forgeuen, by God. In the .xxiiii. of the Prouerbes, it is written that a rightwyſe man falleth vii. tymes in the day, & ryſeth a gayne, but that the vngodly do fall, to their vtter dampnacion. Here thou haſt a manifeſt and a playne difference, betwexte the godly & the vngodly, or betwixt the faithfull & infidell. The vngodly, after that he is come, in to the bothomleſſe pitte, of vngodlyneſſe, dothe contempne, & remayneth in ſynne to the laſt ende with diſpayre. A godlye man, is not he that ſynneth not, but he, which falling .vii. tymes in the day, doth not continew in ſynne, but ryſeth agayne. With this place, are the Palagians,

Nouatians, and Anababtiſtes confounded & conuicted. Adde vnto theſe the .xviii. of Mat. & the .xvii. of Luke, where Chriſt doth plainly ſay: If thy brother dothe treſpaſſe agaynſt the, rebuke him betwixte the and him alone, if he be ſori for his offence or repenteth, forgeue thou him. And if he .vii. tymes in the day dothe offende the, & .vii. tymes in the day cometh to the ſaiyng: I am ſory for myne offēce, thou ſhalt forgeue him.
               
               
                  Sy.
                  But he doth not ſaye, that he wyll forgeue vs our ſynnes.

                  Canſt thou pray, or ſay thy Pater noſter?

                  Doeſt thou not thou pray this: Forgeue vs our treſpaſſes, as wee forgeue them that treſpaſſe againſt vs? Vnto theſe woordes dothe the Lord adde, by and by, in the .vi.

chapiter of Mathew. If ye doo forgeue vnto men their fautes, your father, that is in heauen, ſhall forgeue you alſo. Seyng therfore, that wee doo forgeue, vnto oure brethren daily, it foloweth, that the father of heauē forgeueth vs alſo daily. Do not the ſaintes or holy men pray ſo, and that euery day? Nowe, I aſke the, whether they do lye before God: praiyng thus or not?
               
               
                  S.
                  They do not lye.
               
               
                  Io.
                  If they do not lye, it foloweth, that thei haue in them ſelfe treſpaſſe and ſynnes. If ſo be, that ſynne, as thou thynkeſt, is not forgeuen, whye dyd Chriſte teache vs to prai ſo? forgeue vs our treſpas. Is not this an abhominable thyng, that any man, whiche knoweth not, what he dooeth praye, ſhoulde take vpon hym,

not only to be a teacher, but alſo to teache that whiche repugueth againſt ye manifeſt truth and prayers of the Sayntes? But what thynkeſt thou of Peter, was he, a faithfull Chriſtē man, & elected of God, or not?
               
               
                  Sy.
                  He was not a faithful Chriſten man, afore his falle, els he wolde not haue denyed Chriſt.
               
               
                  Ioi.
                  If he had ben an infidel, to what intent were theſe wordes ſpokē. mat. xvi. Thou artchriſt the ſon of the lyuyng god? Are theſe the wordes of an infidell. And agayne, if Peter had ben, an infidell or hipocrite, when he dyd make ſuche a godly confeſſion, Chriſt would not haue ſayde: Thou art bleſſed Symō: Fleſh and blood hath not reuelated this thynge, vnto the, but my father, which is in heauen.

The LORDE prayſeth not, hipocrites and infidels, but abhorreth & hateth them, Mat. vi and .xxiii. He would not, haue ſaid vnto him: he that is waſhed, hath no neale, but to waſhe his feete. And agayne, Peter, I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith do not faile or ſlake. Rede beſyde that, the .xvii. of Iohan. Now I aſke the again, whether Peter was a faythful Chriſten mam, or not?
               
               
                  Sy.
                  The ſcripture doth compel me to confeſſe, that he was a faithfull chriſtē man.
               
               
                  Io.
                  Now I aſke agayn, whether his fall, was a ſynne or not?
               
               
                  Sy.
                  Agayne, the ſcripture cōpelleth me, to confeſſe that it was a ſynne, for he dyd wepe bitterly And agayn, if to deny chriſt, is no ſynne, what ſhalbe a ſyn thā?
               
               
                  Io.
                  Ergo, it followeth, by all

theſe argumentes, that Peter dyd ſynne, after the knowledge of the truthe, and receiuyng of the fayth. Therfore, a faythfull man is not all without ſynne. And here Peter dyd commytte not a ſmall, but a very greuous ſynne, denyeng thus, the Sauior of the worlde. Now I aſke whether his ſynne was forgeuē him or not?
               
               
                  Sy.
                  yeas truly: for Chriſt ſayeth: Whan thou arte turned agayne, conforte or confirme thy brethren.
               
               
                  Ioia.
                  So ſhoulde the Anababtiſtes dooe, if they were ſent by God. But ſeeyng that preſumptuouſneſſe & partinacie hath ſente them, and do ſo bytterly, & with ſuche ſtubburneſſe, ſpeake agaynſt the goſpell, teachyng for conforte, deſperacion: they ar ſuch Prophetes, as the Lorde doth complayne

vpon, in Ezechiel, which regarde nor care nothynge for the diſeaſed & wounded ſheepe, (which thing neuertheleſſe, thei had learned of the Lord, which is deſeruingly called the good & true ſhephearde. Luc. xxv. or of Paule. ii. Corin. ii.) but diſſipate & ſcatter the Lordꝭ flocke. For what maketh them, beſyde a ſingularitie, or ſinguler loue of them ſelfes, to ſeparate them ſelfes, from our church, but that (as they do ſay) we be ſynners, that is to ſay, vſurers, publicās & dronkardes? I can not, but that I muſt cōfeſſe, that ther be many enorme ſines vſed amōge vs (which is the more pitie) yet we ought not to diſpayre of many, but that thei mai be brought to repentaunce. And truly, as for our elues, we are not very

negligent or ſlouthfull in rebukynge ſynnes, criynge out ſtyll bitterly againſt them, that commyt ſuche thynges. And yet agaynſt the precepte of GOD, Math. xiii. and exemple of the Apoſtles, which dyd condemne no man raſhly, they do ſeparate them ſelues from vs. But this is the nature of Phariſeis.

                  As touchyng this article, I am ſufficiently taught, & I thanke God of it,

                  Iohn, without exception, doth ſay: Chyldren, I haue written this vnto you, that ye ſhulde not ſynne, but if any man dothe ſynne, we haue our aduocate, before the father, that rightwiſe LORDE Ieſu Chriſt. &c. Here no man can bryng any cauillacion. Chriſt is here named and appoynted to be Aduocate or mediator for

all ſynners, and that, at all tymes, as he offereth him ſelfe. ri. Mathew, ſaiyng: Come vnto me all ye that labor and are loadyd, and I wyll refreſh you. That ſame thyng doeth Paule teache, concernynge the onely Sauior Ieſu Chriſt .i. Tim. i. It is a faythfull ſaiyng, and worthi to be receiued of al men, that Chriſt dyd come, into this worlde to ſaue ſynners. If the Anababtiſtes therefore, dooe teache the contrarye, they are the open enemyes of the Croſſe of Chriſt: in the which opinion, if they doo abyde, or perſiſt obſtinately, they are manifeſt heretikes, whome all godly perſones ought to flye and abhorre.
               
            
            
               
               The .ix. treatie or dialoge.
               
                  How that our ſaluacion and rightwiſneſſe, is not to be deſcribed to our workes but to faith.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  
                     IF the Anababtiſtes doo teache, that our ſaluacion, & rightwiſnes, ought to be aſcribed to our workes (whiche is the .iii. parte of this article) thou wilt not ſaie (I thynke) that thei doo erre in it.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  There is nothyng that I will graunt them, leſſe. For this thynge beynge ones graunted, al ye epiſtles of Paul ar condemned, as falſe, & whiche dyd ſeduce the people. For this is the thyng onely, wherfore Paule, with ſuche a zeale did repugn & reſiſt againſt falſe prophetes, whiche did teache,

that rightwiſneſſe dyd come of workes: where as ſainte Paul did attribute our rightwiſnes to faithe. That maie eaſily bee ſene by ye epi. to the Ro. and to the Gala. But I wil bring out of them, certaine places, which can not be confuted. In the .iii. cha. to the Romains, Paul ſaieth thus: All haue ſynned and ar deſtitute of the glory of god, but are iuſtified freely by his grace, thorowgh the redemcion that is in Chriſt Ieſu. And in the .iiii. Ro. If Abraham were iuſtified by workes, thē hath he wherin to reioice, but not with god, for what ſaieth ye ſcripture Abrahā beleued god, & it was counted vnto him, for rightwiſnes. To him yt worketh is ye rewarde not reckened of fauoure but of dutye. To him y• worketh

not, but beleueth in hym, that iuſtifieth, the vngodly, is his faith counted for rightwiſnes. Euen as Dauid deſcribeth the bleſſedfulnes of that man, vnto whom god imputeth righwiſneſſe without dedes. Bleſſed ar thei (ſaieth he) whoſe iniquities are forgiuen, & whoſe ſinnes are couered. &c. And in the xi. to the. Ro. There is a remenaunt left accordyng to the election of grace, if it be of grace then it is not now, of workes. For thā grace is no more grace But if it be of workes, then is it no more grace. For then wer deſeruyng, no more deſeruyng. In the ſeconde to the Galathians: The lyfe, whiche I nowe lyue in the fleſhe, I lyue by the faith, of the ſonne of God, whiche loued me, and gaue hym

ſelfe for me, I deſpiſe not the grace of God. For if rightwiſeneſſe cometh of the lawe, then Chryſte, is dead in vaine. In the thyrde chapiter, he doeth argumente and reaſone after this maner: That no man is iuſtified in the ſight of God, by the lawe, it is euydent. For the iuſte ſhall lyue by faythe. The lawe is not of faythe, but the man, that fulfylleth the thynges, conteyned in the law, ſhall lyue in them. Chryſt hath delyuered vs from the curſe of the lawe, in as muche, as he was made accurſed for vs, that the bleſſing of Abraham might come on the gentilles thorough Theſu Chryſte, and that we myght receaue the promiſe of y• ſpirit, thorow faith. Brethern, I ſpeake after y• maner of men.

Though it be, but a mans teſtament, yet if it be alowed, no man deſpiſeth it, or addeth any thyng ther vnto. To Abraham, and his ſede, was the promiſe made. He ſaieth not, in thy ſedes, as in many, but in thy ſede as of one, which is Chriſt, this I ſaie, that the lawe, which beganne. CCCC and .xxx. yeres after, doeth not diſanulle the teſtament, which was confirmed afore of God, vnto Chriſt warde, to make ye promiſe of no effecte. For if the inheritaunce cometh of ye law, then it cometh not of ye promiſe. But god gaue it, vnto Abraham by promiſe. For if ther had ben a law geuē, which could had geuen life, thē no doubt rightwiſneſſe, ſhoulde haue comed by ye lawe. But the ſcripture, concluded al thinges

vnder ſinne, yt the promiſe, by y• faith of Ieſu Chriſt, might bee geuen vnto them yt beleue. In ye ii. cha. to the Ephe. ye ar ſaued thorow faith, & not of our owne ſelues. It is the gift of god, and cometh not of our dedes or workes. For we ar his owne workmāſhyp, created in Ieſu Chriſt to do good dedes, which he hath prepared for vs to walke in, & in the .iii. to Ti, we wer alſo folyſhe, diſobediente, deceaued, ſeruyng to luſtes and voluptuouſnes, liuyng in malice, and enuye, hatefull or odiouſe and hatyng eche other. But after yt the goodnes and loue of our ſauiour God, not accordynge to the dedes of rightwiſnes, whiche we haue done, but accordyng to his mercye, had made vs ſafe, by the fountayne of

regeneracion, and renuynge of the holy ghoſt, whiche he hath poured vpon vs abundantely, thorow our ſauiour Ieſu chriſt that we beyng iuſtified by his grace, ſhulde be made heyres of euerlaſtyng lyfe, accordyng to our hope. Theſe places are plaine, and can not be auoided. For thei, that ſpeake againſte them, are no chriſten men, but felowes of the falſe Apoſtles, againſt whome Paule writeth, callyng them euyll workemen, and ſubuerſours of the goſpell of Chriſt. And by theſe wordes, not onely the Anababtiſtes, but alſo, all popiſhe doctours, are noted, and whoſoeuer beſyde, doo attribute our rightwiſnes and ſaluacion to our dedes & workes.

                  I can ſaie nothing againſt the manifeſt veritee.

But I wold faine know of the, in what reputacion thou haſte the epiſtle of Iames, and how muche thou doeſt eſteme it.
               
               
                  Io.
                  And I aſke the firſt, what thou thinkeſt, or what oppinion and iudgement thou haſte, of the afore aledged places, and howe ſtrong thou coūteſt them to be.
               
               
                  Sy.
                  Thei are manifeſt, and true and alſo ſtrong enoughe, and dooe attribute ſaluacion, and iuſtifiyng: to faith, but Iamis doeth adſcribe ſaluacion to our woorkes and dedes.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  What ſemeth vnto the then? is it right, yt many places, ſhulde geue the ouer hande to one, or one place to many.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  The interpretaciō of one place, muſt bee taken out of many. But what dooeth this to the epiſtle of Iames?
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  Had the

apoſtles all one learnynge and ſpirite?
               
               
                  Symon.
                  All one. But I aſked the, touchynge the wordes of Iames.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  I haue had alwaies in ſingulare reputacion, the epiſtle of Iames, and haue alwaies geuen great credit & a faith vnto it, though it hath ben ſuſpected by Euſebius, and other beſyde, & counted leſſe apoſtolicall. But if it be Apoſtolical, it foloweth, that it hath the ſame meanyng and ſpirit, that the epiſtles of Paul haue. For this thou haſt graū
                     ted before, that thei had al one learnyng and ſpirit, moreouer that the places, whiche I haue aledged out of Paule, and doo adſcribe ſaluacion to faythe, and not to woorkes, are bothe true and ſtronge. Now it foloweth neceſſarily that it is not

the meanynge of Iames, that woorkes ſhoulde iuſtifye and ſaue, and that therefore this darke place and ſaiyng of Iames ought to be expounded, by many plaine and manifeſte teſtymonyes of Paule.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  What is that?
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  That is to ſaie, that Iames dooeth not goe about, to proue, that workes iuſtifie, and that fayth iuſtifieth not, but that faithe without workes, is no faithe, but an oppiniō and credulitie, or light beleue, which faith can not ſaue. And y• it is ſufficient to ſaluacion to truſt & leyne vpon this vaine oppinion. It is manifeſt therfore, y• Iames doeth not take here faith, for that true and liuely faithe (whiche faith is a gyft of God, and renuyng of the mynde, and lyfe) but for a falſe oppinion, which foolyſhe men do call faith, with the whyche faythe, the diuell beleueth, all quakyng and trē
                     blyng, but by it, he is made neuer the better, nor ſaued. Beſyde that, he vnderſtandeth not humaine or bare workes without faithe, but faithe workyng effectually thorough charitee and loue. Ponder the wordes of ſaynt Iames, and thou ſhalt perceiue, that he proueth there, partly, that faithe can not bee without workes, partly that faith workyng thorough charitee, doeth bothe iuſtifie and ſaue. Therefore Iames dooeth not diſagree from Paule, but meaneth al one thing with him agreyng, both in one ſpirit and learnyng.
               
               
                  Sy.
                  Yet it ſemeth vnto me, that our ſaluacion is adſribed

to workes, when it is attributed to faythe. For if faith can not be without workes, nor workes without faith, thei muſt be all one thyng, and that, which is attributed to one is attributed to the other.
               
               
                  Ioia.
                  Faith and woorkes are almoſt ſo one thynge, as the godhed, and manhead, are one perſone in Chriſte. And yet it folowed not that the godhed is mortal, becauſe that Chriſt dyed in very dede vpon the croſſe. Yet notwithſtandyng, it is all one perſone. whyche can not be diuided. So we maie ſpeake in this buſyneſſe. Faith iuſtifieth. Here faith is taken, for the election, and grace of God, and alſo for the redempcion, whiche is not adſcribed to our owne workes, though thei can not be ſeparated

from faith, and which folowyng moſt certainly of faithe, are very ſure & vndoubted ſignes & tokens of faith and election of god. For ſo Paul doeth ſpeake: Whom he hath predeſtinated, them dydde he choſe, whom he hath choſen, them did he call, whome he hath called, them dyd he iuſtify. And Iohn alſo: We knowe, that when he ſhall appere, we ſhall bee lyke vnto hym, and euery man that hath this hope, doth make him ſelfe cleane, as he is pure .i. Io. iii. In one ſonne, there is bothe lyght and heate, and the one is not from the other. Yet notwithſtandyng the lightyng or illuminacion, is attributed to the lyght, and not to the heate, and the heatyng or warmeneſſe, is adſcribed to the heate, and not

to the lyght.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  But the ſcriptures dooe often and in many places, adſcribe ſaluacion, to oure woorkes and merites.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  That is done, not becauſe that the worke, ſhoulde bee barely taken by it ſelfe, but as a woorke or dede, comyng of faithe, wherby that, whiche is fartheſt, and chyefeſt (that is to ſaie faythe) maie be manifeſted, and ſhewed. I aſke the, can a man, dooe any good thynge of hym ſelfe.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  No. For no man, is good, but god onely.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  And Chriſt ſaieth in the .xv. of Iohn. As boughes can not brynge forthe fruite, excepte, they remayne ſtylle, in the vine. So ye can bryng forthe no fruite excepte ye remayne in me. For without me ye can dooe nothynge.

Now I aſke againe, who bringeth forth the grapes and the wyne?
               
               
                  Symon.
                  The vine.
               
               
                  Ioia.
                  If god, ſhoulde take awaie his ſtrengthe frome the vyne, and ſhoulde not worke in it, that, which we dooe ſee, coulde that vine brynge for the wyne?
               
               
                  Sy.
                  No.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  The chyefe thyng therefore that geueth wyne, is not the vyne, but God, and yet notwithſtandyng, we dooe adſcribe the wyne to the vyne, whereas it dooeth onely come of God.
               
               
                  Symon.
                  I can ſaye nothynge agaynſte the truthe.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  It is all one reaſon, when the ſaluacion and euerlaſtynge lyfe, is attributed to oure owne workes, where as it cometh of God onely, and of gratuitee and free election. For GOD worketh 
                        〈…〉
                     s,

bothe to be willyng, and to doo or performe the thyng, that he hathe moued vs, to be willyng to do, accordyng to his bountuous wyll. He, I ſay, worketh in vs good workes, as in his electes, notwithſtanding the workes ar attributed vnto vs, and are called ours, whiche neuertheleſſe are Gods, that glory & honor may be geuē to god only. Doeſt thou vnderſtande what I ſay?
               
               
                  Sy.
                  I doo vnderſtand it very well.

                  Dothe it ſatiſfie thee?
               
               
                  Sy.
                  ye as truly, Now do I perceiue, that the lernyng of the Anababtiſtes, cometh of ygnoraunce and boldneſſe, and that it is very pernicious and hurtfull, whiche is gaye in the ſyght of the ſimple, but in dede is an error, & malicious rudeneſſe 
                        〈…〉
                     ut I deſyre to knowe,

what thou wylte ſaye of the .v. concluſiō: For they be fully perſuaded, that ſoules are a ſlepe.
               
            
            
               The .x. treatie or dialoge.
               
                  How that the Soules after that thei be departed from the body do not ſlepe, but lyue in chriſt.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  BVt, with this opinion, they do aboliſh the goſpel, which teacheth of the reſurrection of Chriſt: as ſaynt Paule, in the fyrſt chap. to the Romayns, doth ſay: Beſyde that, they doo denye, the laſt Article of oure fayth, that is to ſaye: The lyfe euerlaſtyng, after this lyfe. Is not this therfore a pernitious Doctrine, that repugneth agaynſt ſo manifeſt veritie, and ſure beleue?
               
               
                  Sy.
                  Thou doeſt not vnderſtande the Anabaptiſtes,

For they doo neyther denye the Goſpell, nor the Reſurrection of Chriſt. They ſaye that the Soules, after the deathe of the bodye, (if they dooe departe in fayth) do ſlepe in the boſome of Abraham, tyl the day of iudgement, & that then, they do entre into euerlaſting life. And proue their ſaiynges by the goſpell, & by Paule. Luc. xvi. i. Theſſ. iiii. I wyl not haue you to be ignoraunt touchyng them, that are a ſlepe. &c. In the Olde Teſtament, it is written of the Fathers, that thei fal a ſlepe, with their Fathers. And alſo, it is ſayde of Stephen, that he dyd ſlepe in the Lord. And that thei at lengthe, ſhall receyue euerlaſtyng lyfe, they do proue it by Paule .ii. Timoth. iiii. I haue ſayeth he, fought a good fyght.

Now is there layde vp for me, a croune of rightwyſneſſe, which the Lorde, who is a rightfull iudge. ſhall geue or render vnto me, vpon that day, not onely to me, but alſo to al them that loue his comynge. There is ſuche a thyng. Phil. iii. & i. Iohn. iii. Or what neade is it, of that laſt iudgement, if by & by, after his death, euery man receyueth his owne dome: theſe do ſeme vnto me ſtrong.

                  I ſaye the ſame thyng that I ſayde before. If our ſoules dooe ſleepe, after the death of the bodye, the ſoule of Chriſt ſleepeth alſo, and the reſurrection is diſanulled. For Chriſt dyd proue that ther was an euerlaſting lyfe by his riſing agayne, which can not be euerlaſtyng,

if the ſoule ſlepeth, and begynneth then to lyue, when iudgement dothe come. Wherfore the ſleepe of the Anababtiſtes, dothe euacuate and diſanull, the goſpell and reſurrection. As for the boſome of Abraham, I aſke the whether it be, a ſlepyng place & dormitori, or a receptacle, and place to receyue the lyuyng?

                  A place whervnto, the ſoules of ye faithfull Chriſten men, ar gathered together, tyll the day of iudgement.

                  Theſe ar not my wordes, but the wordes of him, that ſpeaketh there, of his owne death. For he vſeth this word, to go, for to dye. (ſo that to go, and to dye, is all one thyng, with him) And agayne, this worde, to come, wherfore the Anababtiſtes doo ſtryue, is not taken, for his laſt comyng, but for the reſurrectiō of chriſt: and ye helpe and ayde, that he ſheweth vpon the faythfull chriſten men being in extreme nede. For he came agayne, after that he was ryſen from death, & dyd declare, that he had opened the

kingdom of god: that we might be ſure, that as he dyd entre in to heauen him ſelfe, ſo we ſhuld come in or entre in alſo. But he is entered, in to immortal lyfe, & not in to ſlepe, in to the kyngdome of God, and not in to the boſome of Abraham, and that by & by after his death. Therfore we ſhall alſo, incontinent after our death, entre in to euerlaſtyng lyfe, and into the kingdome of God. For he taketh vs away, when he calleth vs from death to lyfe. Iohn. v. For it is added by maner of expoſicion: That where I am, ther ye may be alſo. Therfore are we taken in ſoule, from death to euerlaſtyng lyfe, & in body, to iudgement. Or tell me, dyd Chriſt with his death, reſerate & open heauen, whiche was locked vp

afore or not?
               
               
                  Sy,

                  But what neadeth this reſeration or openyng, if the ſoules doo not entre in to lyfe? Where as notwithſtādyng Paul doeth ſay: I coueit to be diſſolued, & deliuered from this body, & to be wt chriſt. beleuyng that after this death, he ſhould be with Chriſt. Peter moreouer doeth ſaye, that for this cauſe, the goſpel was preached vnto the dead, that they ſhuld be iudged in the fleſh, but lyue, after, or in ye ſpirit, do not theſe manifeſt places teache & proue, that the ſoules doo lyue, with God? For he ſayeth that y• goſpell was preached vnto the dead: What is els the goſpel, to be preached, but redemption & lyfe to be preached. And what were they that were dead, but

they, which after that thei were departed, were gathered in the boſome of Abraham?

                  Becauſe that they being deliuered, thorough the death of Chriſt, ar receiued, as touching their ſoules, into euerlaſtyng lyfe. In the laſt day, they ſhall ryſe bodily, and as all other, ſhall be iudged, in the vniuerſall iudgement. In the meane ſeaſon their ſoules do liue with God. Is it proued ſufficiently that the ſoules that wer in the boſome of Abraham are delyuered, & brought in to heauen?

Epiſtle to Timothe. For he had ſpoken before of his death, ſaiyng: I am ready to be offered: affirming, that he had ben faith full and loyall, in his courſe, & therfore, he dyd not doubte, but that the rightwiſe iudge, ſhulde render vnto him, the coroune of rightwyſneſſe, which, as he leaueth no vnrightwyſneſſe vnpunyſhed, ſo alwayes rewardeth them that lobor faithfully. And this place doeth rather for vs, then for the Anababtiſtes, ſeing that Paule dothe hope, that the coroune of rightwyſneſſe, duyd vnto the rightwyſe, ſhalbe renderyd vnto him, at the tyme of his death. Ergo, he beleueth not, that the ſoules do ſlepe, but that they do lyue euerlaſtingly. That, which thou aledgeſt out of Iohn and Paule to the Philipenſes,

are ſpoken, of the laſt iudgement, but they proue not that the ſoules are a ſleape. For that, whiche they doo ſpeake of ſaluation there, dooe perteyne more to the reſurrection of the body. For theſe are the wordes of Paule: He ſhall transforme (that is to ſay Chriſt) our vyle body, that he may make it conforme and lyke, to his glorious body. What meane theſe thingꝭ elles, but that our bodyes haue full hope of reſurrection. or riſyng agayn? As Iob dyd ſpeke Iob .ix.

                  Can then a ſpirite be ſubiect to bodily infirmities, as to be an hongered, to be weryed, to dye. &c.
               
               
                  Sy.
                  No, for theſe perteyne to the bodye onely. A ſpirite, is immortall, incorruptible, euerlaſting or perpetuall.

                  Thou ſayeſt very well, therfore marke thyne argumēt thus: Sith the ſoule is a ſpirit, & not a bodye, it can not be ſubiecte to bodily paſſions or infirmities, but is exempte frome them: ſlepe doth chaunce to the body, thorough werineſſe. Ergo the ſoule can not ſlepe: for the ſoule cannot be weary. Or canſt thou brynge any other thynge

                  Now, if our ſoules ſhould ſlepe, it ſhoulde folow, that after this lyfe, we doo feele neither good, nor euyll, which dothe directly pugne agaynſte the Goſpell. Moreouer, we wyl proue by the nature of the ſlepe, that the ſoules can not ſlepe, but the bodye only. For now I aſke the, when doeth the ſoule ſlepe, after that ſhe is departed frome the body, or when ſhe is yet ioyned to the body?
               
               
                  Sy.
                  At bothe tymes.
               
               
                  Ioi.
                  Neither of them can be trew: and I do meruail that ſo groſſe an anſwere dyd come from the. For ſeyng that the Soule, can muche leſſe ſlepe, when ſhe hath

put awaye the burdeyn of th
                        •
                      body, then when ſhe beareth about yet, the burdeyn of the body, & doeth not ſleape, when ſh
                        •
                      is yet in the bodye, it followet
                        •
                      that ſhe ſleapeth muche leſſe, when ſhe is deliuered from th
                        •
                      bodye And that ſhe doeth not ſlepe beyng in the body, it maye be knowen by thys, that in the tyme of wakyng, the body doth alwayes, without reſt & quyet, worke, which actions do come from the ſoule. Ergo, it is manifeſt, that whiles that the body waketh, the ſoule ſleapeth not. And agayn, when the body hath geuē it ſelf to reſt & to ſlepe, the ſoule worketh with a perpetual motion or mouyng, & doeth neuer reſt or ceaſſe, either ſhe bretheth, or doeth ſome thynge alwayes, withe the vertue of remembraunce

& vnderſtādyng, or with the other excellent vertues & powers. All mans lyfe is eyther wakynge, or reſt: in none of them bothe, doeth the ſouleſleape. Ergo the ſoule doeth not ſleape at all. Therfore ſlepe, longeth only to the body, & not to the ſoule. For when the ſoule begīneth ones to haue life it is a perpetual Enteſechia, comeyng frō the euerlaſting & eternall fontayne of goodneſſe, the which perpetuall Enteſechiia, that is to ſay, vnrequietable, & perpetuall action and mouyng in the ſoule, if any man denayeth, by that ſame reaſon he muſt denay the ſoule
               
               
                  Sy.
                  Theſe thyngꝭ are ſomewhat darke vnto me.
               
               
                  Ioiada.
                  Therefore, I wyll declare them, by an exāple: Fyer is a very pure & actuall thyng,

whiche after that it begynneth ones, can neuer ceaſſe from his operacion and workyng, tyll it be quenched: and that is, when it hathe nothyng, whervpon, it maye ſhew, and exerciſe his operacion. If thou denyeſt the operacion & working of the fier, thou haſt denyed the fyer. The nature of the ſoule is very like, which after, that ſhe is poured in to the body, by god, is a liuely and working ſpirite, and can neuer ceaſſe nor be at reſt. Wylt thou haue no fyer, take awaye the operacion. If thou denyeſt the Soule, attribute vnto her, ſlepe. For to ſay, that the ſoule is a ſlepe, and to ſaye, that the ſoule is not, is all one thyng.
                  If the ſoule ſlepeth, ſhe dooeth reſt, if ſhe dooeth reſt, ſhe worketh not, if ſhe doeth not worke,

ſhe is not. For to worke, and to be in the ſoule, is all one thing, 
                        •
                     yth that ſhe is a perpetual motion, & workyng. But the ſoule is, therfore ſhee ſleapeth not. Dooeſt thou vnderſtande this thyng?
               
               
                  Sy.
                  Very well.
               
               
                  Ioia.
                  Therfore did I ſay, that the A
                     
                        •
                     ababtiſtes knowe not, the nature of the ſoule.
               
               
                  Sy.
                  Thou ſhuldeſt peraduenture haue perſuaded ſomewhat, to Timens, and Phedrus, Platos diſciples, I had leauer heare Scriptures.
               
               
                  Ioia.
                  The Saduces, dyd teache that ther was no Reſurrection, and by this, dyd denye the immortalitie, and perpetual workyng of the ſoule, yea, and alſo Angels, and all maner of Spirites. Act. xiii. The Lorde dyd ſtop their mouthes, with theſe reaſons. Ye erre (ſayth he) not

knowing the ſcriptures, nor the vertue of God. God, after the death of the Fathers, calleth hym ſelfe, the God of Abrahā, Iſaac and Iacob, which is not the God, of the dead. but of the lyuyng, and that therfore, Abraham, and the other Fathers were a lyue, and not dead. Thei were dead in body, a gret whyle afore, and buryed: Therfore Chriſt ſpeaketh here, of the lyfe of the ſoule. Ergo, the ſoule beyng ſeparated from the body, is in her owne kynde, worketh lyuely, and ſlepeth not. This ſyllogyſme and argument, doo I put to all the Anababtiſtes, to anſwer to, that they may cleare them ſelfe frome the hereſye of the Saduces. For thei are lyke vnto the Saduces and Manicheans. What ſhoulde I ſay of

the wordes of Chriſt, whiche hangyng vpon the Croſſe, doeth comforte, the thiefe with theſe wordes, ſaiyng: To daye thou ſhalte be with me in Paradiſe.
               
               
                  Sy.
                  Paradiſe, and the Boſome of Abraham, are all one thyng, to the Anababtiſtes, where thei ſay, that the ſoules doo ſleape.
               
               
                  Ioia.
                  Thei do affirme this with out ſcriptures, and with an hereticall ſpirite. Chriſt ſayeth: To day, thou ſhalte be with me in Paradiſe. Ponder euerye worde. If Paradice, is a ſleapyng place, Chriſt ſleapeth in it alſo. For he ſayeth: To daye thou ſhalte be. Moreouer, the thiefe prayeth Chriſt, to remember him, when he ſhoulde come in to hys kyngdome. If the kyngdome of God, is a Dormitorie or Sleapyng place: what

doo the ſcriptures ſpeake, of the Reſurrection, and Aſcendyng of Chriſt in to heauen? Ye ate obſtacle aſſes, O Anababtiſtes, whiche dare make mention of ſuche ſleapyng, agaynſt ſo manifeſt places of the ſcriptures. What ſhall thei ſay, to the wordes of Chriſt. Iohn. v.? He that heareth my word, and beleueth in him, that hath ſent me, ſhall not come in to iudgement, but is paſſed frome deathe to lyfe. Whiche woordes are ſo cleare, that no mā can denay them, but heretikes. Let the .xi. of Iohn. and the .xv. of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians. Item the .ii. Cor .ii. be reade, and it ſhal euidently he knowen, that the ſleape of the Anababtiſtes, is a blaſphemy agaynſt the Goſpell and Reſurrection of Chriſt.
               
               
                  
                  Sy.
                  If the matter be better looked vpon: the Anababtiſtes can not cleare them ſelues, from the crime of ouer boldneſſe & ignorancye: but they haue not pondered all theſe thingꝭ ſo exactly
               
               
                  Ioia.
                  Why dooe they preſume to teach then, & take vpō thē that, which paſſeth their ſtrengthe? And agayne, when they be conuicted, wyll not geue the vpper hande to the truthe? But becauſe they wyll be ſene ſtedfaſt, they be founde, in all thynges, frowarde, and obſtacle. To ſay briefly: They doo all thynges, with contention, arrogancye, and ignoraunce.
               
               
                  Sy.
                  I woulde had queſtioned with the, touchyng the .vi. Concluſion, but that I muſt go to myne Iune: Tomorow, if thou canſt haue leaſyr, I wyll be here betymes
