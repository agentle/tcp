                  To the Christian Reader.
                  THat which here I offer vnto thy view, courteous Reader, is, as the title doth shew, the translation of a booke imprinted certaine yeares since, and published in the Arabicke tongue: Yet when, or where, or by whom, is not, as vsually the manner is, in the same any where expressed or declared. It was first written, as the Author himselfe seemeth to intimate, about 600 years since. Who he was, and what, I dare not for certaine affirme; Many of the obiections, demands, answers, arguments, and speeches are too good to be thought to come from the breast of an Heathen, Turke, or Saracen: although of them many scarce good enough to be fathered vpon a well grounded Christian. That consideration first mooued me to iudge it framed by some Christian, in disgrace and confutation of

that fond and foolish religion. Yet when I called to mind, that I had heard many Merchants, and especially M. W. G. a worshipfull Gentleman, who did spend the better part of his youth continually resident amongst them, That it was a common thing to heare from themselues such like obiections, and doubts made against their law. Againe whē I considered, that whatsoeuer is here alledged and layd downe, though neuer so good and Christianlike; Or contrariwise absurd and monstrous; is notwithstanding found and read in that their law: And lastly, seeing that my selfe can testifie that from their owne mouthes I haue heard; and can shew in their bookes and tractates the like morall sayings, and zealous exhortations vnto vertue, and holinesse of life; I then altered that mine opinion, and did verily beleeue it to be written by some Saracen or Mohametane, who did in truth make these doubts and demands, as being desirous of better satisfaction. If any man shall obiect and say, as the consistorie of Rome did by the Talmud, That it were better that such foolish fables and blasphemies were concealed and vtterly suppressed, then made publike and common to all: I answer, I haue done no more, nay not so

much, as the ancient Fathers, Tertullian, Irenaeus, Epiphanius, Augustine, and others, who haue taken vpon them to confute the errors and opinions of Heretiks, haue done. Nullum enim est dogma, insigniter impium & peruersum in Alcorano, quod non extet in libris eorum quos antea indicaui, Irenaei, Tertulliani, scriptorum Ecclesiasticae historiae, Epiphanij, Philastrij, Augustini; quorum libri saepius foetant propè quàm cuniculi: Et Typograghi quaestum inde non exiguum tolerant, & rem studiosis bonae literaturae inprimis gratam faciunt. Quaedam etiam absurdiora in veterum haeresium descriptionibus reperiuntur, quà Alcoran protulerit, &c. For in the Alkoran, saith a learned Diuine, there is no one opinion so impious & wicked, which may not be found in the bookes of those writers which I haue before spoken of; to wit, Irenaeus, Tertullian, the Ecclesiasticall historians, Epiphanius, Philastrius, and Augustine; whose bookes do breed wellnere as oft as conies: And the printers do thereby reape no small gaines, and withall do deserue very well of all good students. Some things also, in the discoueries

of old heresies, are met withall, more absurd and grosse, then the Alkoran doth afford any. But the examples following, being of the same nature, & practised by graue iudicious Diuines, are more proper to our purpose. Peter, Abbot of Cluniak, a man highly commended in his time, for learning, religion, and Christian charitie, did well nere 500 yeares since, cause Robert of Reading our countryman, to translate the Alkoran or lawes of Mohamed into the Latine tongue; Which translation was by the said Peter dedicated vnto S. Bernard, that famous Abbot of Clareuall. At the end of which his translation you shall find this which followeth; Illustri glorioso
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         viro Petro Cluniacensi Abbate praecipiente, suus Angligena, Robertus Retinensis, librum istum transtulit, anno Domini M.C.XLIII, anno Alexandri, M.CCCC.III, anno Alhigere D.XXXVII, anno Persarum quingentesimo vndecimo. About this time did Euthymius a learned Grecian translate, if not all, yet diuerse and sundrie peeces of the same. The Councell of Vienna, celebrated by Pope Clement the 5, in the yeare of our Lord 1311, hath an act enioyning certaine Vniuersities to maintaine Professours of

the Arabicke tongue, for the translating of books out of that language into Latine. Now, as a learned man truly gathereth, those holy Fathers had no care of Physicke and Astronomie, but of Diuinitie onely: and therefore they meant of the Alkoran and such others concerning religion. Not long after this, Iohn Bishop of Segouia, offered vnto the Councell of Constance, the Alkoran by him translated and confuted. In the yeare of our Lord 1543, Theodorus Bibliander, (animated thereunto and commended by Philip Melanthon) did publish and imprint the aforesaid version of Retinensis the English-man. Within foure or fiue years after this edition, Andreas Arriuabene turned the Alkoran, as he saith, out of Arabicke into Italian: The title by himselfe praefixed to that his edition is thus; L'Alcorano di Macometto, nel qual si contiene la Dottrina, la Vita, i Costumi, & le Legge sue, tradotto nouamente dall'Arabo, in lingua Italiana; Con Gratie, e Priuilegij, M.D.XLV II. The Alkoran of Machomet, in which is contained his Doctrine, Life, Customes & Lawes, translated newly out of Arabicke into the Italian tongue. When as in deed that translation of his is nothing but

                     Retinensis Italionated; neither do I thinke that he vnderstood much Arabicke. Thus you see what presidents I haue, for that which is done: Such as I doubt not, but will fully satisfie the learned and indifferent: the peeuish and froward, I weigh not: this paines was not taken for them. Nothing I know may please them that is not of their owne breeding. Neither do I see what benefite the vnlearned may reape by it. Now concerning the thing it selfe, I do giue the Reader to vnderstand, (the louers of these studies, and such as haue seene the booke can testifie that I speake the truth) That the copie that I haue followed, was so badly imprinted, that in verie many places I was constrained to diuine and guesse. And therefore if in any place I haue failed, it is not much to be maruelled. Notwithstanding, although I will not say, that I haue failed in any particular: yet I dare boldly affirme, that I haue hit the generall scope and purpose of the Author, which for the thing it selfe might haue bene sufficient. But beside this generalitie, for the benefite of students, which I especially aimed at, I haue so set it foorth that they might be bettered by it: And therefore I haue tied my selfe, as neare as the English

phrase would suffer me, vnto the words of the Arabicke. Wherefore for their sakes, which are desirous to vnderstand that language, and for that purpose do please to vse this our labour, we haue, in the margent of this our booke, set downe the numbers answering to the pages of the Arabicke copie. Truth it is, that in that booke you shall find no such numbers expressed: but that want any man with his pen may easily supply. If I haue added any thing to helpe the English, that we haue caused to be imprinted in an Italica letter.

                        I did not see thee at all, all the time that we went to the Alkaaba (God make vs honorable by it) vntill we were gone vp mount Kabis: At that time I would faine haue met thee: but by meanes of the great throng of pilgrimes I could not, and by reason of the great prease I lost thee. Yet this morning I saw thee againe, and making hast, being farre off, and the throng great, at length I came vnto thee. But both my selfe and my Camell are very weake and faint.

                        Good father, I know this very well, and I desire it may be done: But how is it possible a man should be in this world, and not be polluted and defiled with it?

                        What then are those faculties of the Soule?
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        Vnderstanding, Memorie, and Will: For  these three faculties are in euery reasonable soule.

                        How do these three faculties make a man like vnto God?
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        As euery reasonable soule, adorned and beautified with these three faculties, is one man: So that same God is the powerfull vnderstanding comprehending all, and commanding ouer all: He is also that word or soule which created the heauens vaultwise most seemlily; with all other things else whatsoeuer: Lastly he is that Will or Charitie, whose bountie and goodnesse preserueth all things.
                     
                     
                        AH.
                        These words are good, and such as all men ought to heare and regard.
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        It is not sufficient for a man to heare, that there is this power and propertie in God: And that a man do know also the excellencie of his soule vnited  with the basenesse of this worldly life, like vnto a brute beast: And that he doth not indeed vnderstand what is good and equall, but is like vnto the vnreasonable creatures.
                     
                     
                        AH.
                        What is it therefore that he ought to do?
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        This he ought to do: As the Angels, the Heauens, and the Elements all are vnder the obedience of the Creator, and do alwaies sing praises and do those things, which he, whose name is alway to bee praised and exalted, hath ordained them to do: So man with the vnderstanding ought to glorifie God continually: And with the excellencie of Will, and

faculty of Memory in all matters we should walke vprightly and honestly, and shun all sinne and iniquitie.

                        Blessed is he that doth thus.
                     
                     
                        
                            SH.
                        Truth it is; he is blessed indeed. For his soule beginneth to delight it selfe, in this world, with that kind of delight and ioy, that after this mortall life ended, shall be perfect and in Paradise compleate; which in this world is not possible for man to conceiue or apprehend: For our vnderstanding cannot conceiue that, which was not first seene or, heard, or perceiued by some of the externall senses.

                        Why then it followeth, That seeing the end of man is the blessednesse of the soule: And that the portion he looketh for is spirituall, not animall, It must needs be thought, that that good thing which is proposed to a man, is something spirituall, not corporall, nor animall.

                        This confession is sound, and this confession ought euery Mussleman, that is of discretion, to make.

                        In truth, these words of thine do much reioyce me: But I maruaile greatly, why this is not a custome amongst the wiser sort of Musslemans, to talke and discourse at all times of these arguments, and such like matters as these.

                           The reason is, for that the Musslemans for the most part, do exercise themselues in feats of armes, and do giue their mind to the study of the famous acts of former kings; not vnto studies of Diuinity, and spirituall knowledge.

                        Our Prophet, our Aduocate, I meane, hath ordained the Law in the famous Alkoran, for the saluation of his people:
                              The end and effect of the law of God.
                            For this is the property of the Law, that it draweth and tendeth vnto that end that maketh peace, and saluation of the soule, not of the  bodie. For the bodie is dust, and subiect to mortalitie: But the soule dieth neuer; because it is of a diuine nature.

                            For in the Law are contained the commandements of God, which were giuen first vnto Moses, to this end that he should keepe and obserue the said precepts. And hereupon it is, that our Prophet in the title Ionas,
                              Of the Prophets.

And men were drawne vnto this error and destruction by a litle and litle. And to be briefe; small and great, all of them were vnder this diuellish and blinde seruitude.

                        There fell out this. That he, like the direct &  true beames of the Sunne, in a moment dispelled out of the world,
                              Christ the true light of the word, By the preaching and miracles wrought by himselfe and his Apostles dispelled all darknes and idolatry.
                            those clouds of darknes; And he roused vp mankind and the posterity of Adam from those sinnes by a litle and litle, by preaching and miracles. And after him, his Apostles, and Disciples, and those who followed him, exercised the same things, vntill that men had contemned idols, and wholly abandoned them, and did worship the true God, and loued the seruice of God sincerely.

                        Therefore very worthily did our Prophet commend the Gospell, and call it, a prophecy, and straight way of God. For in truth so it is.

                        Our Prophet came after Christ about 600 yeares; and therefore I thinke there were no idols,  no not in any place; especially in such places where learned and discreet men dwelt.
                        
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        What good thing did our Prophet adde vnto the Gospell, seeing that the doctrines of it are holy

and perfect, as he himselfe doth affirme.

                        He added no other thing at all, then that which he himselfe doth testifie of himselfe in his Alkoran; to wit, That he himselfe also is a true Prophet; And that he hath talked oft-times with the Angell Gabriel. And that vpon Barak he went vp into the heauens: Item he saith, That God and his Angels do pray for him: Lastly, he saith, That Noe, Abraham, & his Apostles did follow his law & cōmandements
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        Here, I adiure thee by the most high God, that thou tell me, How these men did follow his law, seeing that they were before him many hundreds &  thousands of yeares?

                        But his law was written also by another, in a time before that.
                        
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        This seemeth not to be true: For our Prophet himselfe saith, That he wrote them, and that by himselfe. Wherefore we do confesse; That the books of Moses, & of the Prophets, the Psalmes of Dauid, and the Gospell of the Christians, were commended and receiued of our Prophet.

                        Yet I am desirous to know whether all these bookes be but one, or not? And whether all of them do agree in all languages, which are now found in the world, or not?
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        There is no question of that: For the disciples of Christ, and his Apostles combined together with one consent, carried them, and by preaching spread them into euery corner of the world.

                        But if at this time there should be any language found, wherein the text and Scripture were different from that of other languages, what ought

then to be done?

                        It must be confessed that this did arise out of the ignorance of the Scribe: And that it ought to be corrected, and that text be made to agree with all other texts agreeing betweene themselues, especially with those texts, and most ancient bookes which were the first, and best corrected, that is, with those written in the languages of Abraham, the Syrians, Greekes, and Latines.

                        This was not the worke of man; but the will of God: For so Christ saith in the glorious Gospell, It is possible that the heauenly orbes may perish or faile, as also the earth: But it is not possible that there should faile or perish one letter of the law of God the most high, and of my precepts.

                           Yes verily. And not with Gabriel onely, but with God himselfe. For we do reade that many of the ancient Prophets, and holy fathers did talke with them, and one of them, for examples sake, was Abraham the prophet.

                        Abraham the prophet, and Lot the prophet, and Iacob, and many others: But Abraham did not  onely speake with them; but there were with him at his house three Angels, which conuersed with him, and hosted there. It is also read, that Abraham saw three Angels, but adored but one onely;
                              In the Godhead are three persons, euen the Musslemans do confesse.
                            Now this one, was God the Father, with his eternall Word, together with his eternall Spirit, that is, that one God, which created all the world, and doth preserue and command the same.

                            Moreouer he said, That his seede should go in amongst idolaters: and therefore lest the Iewish nation should communicate with the wicked people, he commanded the law of the Couenant, that by it they might be distinguished from them.

                        It is very true, so we do reade, and this was a miraculous act of our Prophet.

                        How was that possible that the Moone should fall to the earth? And how could it go into the sleeue of a man, seeing that the breadth of it is greater then all the whole earth?

If he were a Prophet, how came it to passe that he spake that which was not true? For in asmuch as he was a Prophet, hee ought continually to speake truth, as the bookes of the rest of the Prophets do.

                        I will answer vnto the last onely; and I do affirme,

that Moses writeth, That our blessed God, by his blessed and holy word alone, did create the world. Moreouer also Dauid writeth, That Elohim, that is God the most high, had all things with him for a patterne of the workes of Christ to come, and of his Apostles. And to be briefe, the ancient writings and the Gospell do agree of one truth, of those  things which concerne Christ, which afterward were not by parables and figures; but were clearely taught of Christ by demonstration, and manifestation of the way of truth and practise, (according to the will and pleasure of God) of the attaining of the glory of the kingdome of heauen, that is, of Paradise.

                        Yet Christ saith, My burthen, that is my precept, and my law is good and sweet. For it is the law of loue and mercy; And wheresoeuer there is loue & compassion, in very deed there is God; And therefore by his aide and assistance whatsoeuer it be that doth seeme to vs and our sences, heauie and difficult, shall be made light and easie.

                        It must needs be confessed, that he attributeth to him a diuine perfection; and that his power it was, which was seene to be in him, by reason of those many miracles which he did; As it is read, That hee gaue sight to the blind, which was so borne by nature: Hearing to the deafe: Speech to the dumb: And life vnto the dead, after they had bene laid

                           rom God: And therefore they did confesse that that same law was giuen by God: Moses also did shew great miracles, and was famous amongst men for his Religion and loue of God almightie toward him.

                           In like maner also, if the law of our Prophet and his Alkoran of so great esteeme be giuen of God, it is meete that it be confirmed by the testimony of Martyrs: By the perswasion of miracles: And by some demonstration from God almighty.

And what thing the nature of God is? I say that thou hast, in making these questions, committed a great sinne, in that thou durst for shame speake such a thing.

Beleeue therefore, good sonne, in humility whatsoeuer is to be beleeued concerning the things of God. And run not out at any time into speeches to say, That God cannot do all things: For God is omnipotent, and doth much in many matters, whose causes we can by no meanes know, neither ought we to search into them: For they remaine layd vp in the treasurie of his secrets, which cannot be comprehended.

                        I haue sinned, and I do acknowledge my sinne: For it is true that thou hast said. But I would willingly know for what cause our Prophet doth call

                            Christ, The word of God, or the soule of God, or his spirit:
                              
                                 That Christ is the word of God;

                        Yes, you may, and it is easie to answer it. Christ is the soule or word of God, as the beames of the Sunne are the very essence of the Sunne, and nature thereof.

And this ought to be the faith and confession of euery one, and to make no question of it. For that were a meere deniall of it.

Now in the time of slaughter, the Angell Gabriell came downe from heauen, and caught him by the hand, that he should not kill him; and came with a Lambe, or a Ram, which was to be sacrificed: and so Ishak was not slaine; although he were offered vp by his father, & laid vpon the altar, and vpon the wood; yet he was preserued aliue.

                        I am desirous to heare what those good things are: therefore tell me them. For in the recitall of them we shall be incited to do good works.

                        Our Prophet in his glorious Alkoran saith, That God will giue to those that do good, all pleasant graces, faire houses, virgines, and damsels: Moreouer, that to euery man seuerally he will giue of euery thing store, together with goodly garments; Now all this shall be cause of very much ioy.

                        I maruaile much at this: For our Prophet  also in the glorious Alkoran saith, That men shall come & shall be gathered together in the day of promise with goodly bodies, which shall neuer die at all: And therefore man shall not neede to eate: because he shall not die. Neither shall he haue any need of women: For in Paradise he shall haue no children: For in this world God giueth women for issue and childrens sake. And if a man haue issue, hauing eternall life, that is, being a citizen of heauen, I demand of thee, How their children shall be? If they be mortall, or subiect to death; then it followeth, That of an immortall man should be borne him that were mortall, which were absurd to grant: For euery thing begetteth some thing like it selfe. Now if an immortall man should be begotten, this were a new kind of  generation, which is also absurd.

saith he did write in iest: For our state without doubt, shall be like vnto the blessed estate of the Angels, and other heauenly spirits, enioying the glory of God. For there must be in Paradise no consideration of meate, drinke, women, or such things. For all these things are giuen to vs of God, in this world, as conuenient for our bodies, and fleshly part of ours, that are imperfect of themselues, to preserue mankind; And are no waies necessary

                            For we all know generally, That God created Adam; And that out  of his side he also formed one woman; And that he said to Adam, This is flesh of thy flesh, and they two were one flesh, that is, one man, with one woman.

                            Man after the fall of Adam, fell into a state that was not very perfect, but disordered: And by this meanes one man is not content with one woman, but doth desire many and diuerse, for the satisfying of his concupiscence, and lust that he hath vnto their company. Moreouer also we know that garments were at the first giuen of God to Adam & Heua, to couer their nakednesse withall, after they had committed sinne: But man hath made himselfe goodly apparell, of new and diuerse fashions. Adam  had an house for the needfull vse of it; that man (which was borne naked without haire, which other liuing creatures haue, that do moue and abide in the ayre) might dwell in it, to defend himselfe from the violence of summer and winter; From the danger of cold, and heate of the Sunne; From raine, and snow, and such like things offending.

                        In deed, this is the excellent property of the vnderstanding, when it learneth any spirituall thing, and is delighted with diuine conceipts; where our soule resteth, as in the worthinesse and blessednesse of them, it desireth alwaies to go on forward.

                        And on the contrary, wisemen alwaies of euery  profession & countrey haue knowne, and taught, That the true ioy and comfort of man is in liuing according vnto reason.

                        This is indeed a ioy; but it is a worldly ioy, and that which soone decayeth: For it hath an end at  the death of the body: Yea and oft-times also before the death of the body it is lost by many accidents & casualties. But the spirituall ioy which is according vnto perfection, beginneth in this world, and continueth in the world to come for euer and euer. For it draweth our soule vnto his true end, that is, vnto God our Creator.

                        In truth there is a great difference betweene this ioy, and that: And seeing that this ioy, which thou callest worldly ioy, is so small a ioy, of little continuance, and doth so soone decay; I do maruaile why all wise men do not seeke after this which is eternall and stable.

That he ascended vp into the highest heauen:Fabula plusquam Talmudica. One of R. Lumleys tales.
                            but he speaketh not one word of his worth, dignity, and perfection. But he saith, That Gabriel on a night did knocke at his gate; and he arose out of his bed, where he did sleepe with his wife Aïsha; and he opened the gate, and the Angell saluted him; and said vnto him, The peace of God be vpon thee and thy wife: thou must with me go vp into heauen, that thou maist see in this blessed night the secrets of God. Now this vision and iourney did neuer befall to any sonne of Adam. Item, he reporteth in the Alkoran,  That he rode vpon Barak, which was with Gabriel; And Barak did speake, saying, Thou shalt not ride me, except thou wilt promise me to pray for me, before the maiestie of God almightie, and his excellencie. Then riding vpon him, he was carried, as he saith in his Alkoran, (praise be giuen to him that led his seruant vnto his end) and from thence also he went vp by staires, euen vnto the very throne of God, as he saith.

Furthermore tell me, I charge thee in Gods name, seeing it is not possible to vnderstand the Alkoran, how God Almightie doth command that we should follow it? And seeing the law is not

                        Without all doubt the law of Moses, the  ancient Prophets, and the glorious Gospell, were written orderly, and plainely: And therefore our Prophet in the Assora intituled Ionas, saith; If there be any doubt to thee in religion, I haue told thee & enioyned thee, saying, Seeke the declaration and exposition thereof of them which did reade it before we did: to wit, of the Iewes, and of the Christians, which did reade the Law and the Gospell before our time.

                        If there be no other greater difficulty then this,
                           
                            despaire not; for an answer is easily shaped to this question. For I my selfe, was once of this opinion, but I wished that I might vnderstād it. And at length I was satisfied and fully perswaded of it; for it is a thing plaine enough, and it cannot be denied.

                        In mine opinion it is a very strange thing, that thou shouldst say, It is a matter manifest: But thou art a great learned man, and very old, and thou saidst, I was satisfied. I intreate thee therefore, for God almighties cause, to shew me the exposition of it; that I may learne, and make profite by thee.

                        I do also beleeue that the rayes of the Sunne

                        SH.
                        Now we say, That he that begetteth is the Father: And that which is begotten is the Sonne.

                        SH.
                        So in the same manner therefore the Christians do say, That Christ was the Sonne of God: Because he is his word; and God is the Father: For he was begotten of him; as the speech is begotten of Reason; and as of the Sunne, the beames. Now as reason and speech are of one & the same essence; And the nature of the Sunne, and of his raies are one and the same: So Christ the Sonne, with the Father hath one and the same nature; And the essence of them is one and the same: And therefore they are but one God, and not two Gods. Now because that our Prophet in the Assora intituled Annesa, saith, That Christ is the word of God; we must needs, in regard of the former demonstrations a little before premised,
                            also confesse, That he is the Sonne of God; because he is his word, and is borne of him: it followeth therefore, That there is but one God. For the essence of both being but one; also the diuine nature is but one and the same. And to say without any ground, That God almightie should not haue a Son without a Wife, were mere madnesse: For God is a very spirit: and in this diuine generation there needeth no vse of a woman. Whosoeuer denieth this, denieth also and saith, that God is not an essence. For in God there is no dimension. He denieth also and

saith, that God doth not liue. For he doth not eate. Now this is mere ignorance and a great madnesse.

                        This is plaine, that God doth not eate to sustaine life, as man doth: otherwise he should not be God.

                        And therefore I say, seeing that our Prophet  doth say, That Christ is the word of God, and doth name the word, his Sonne; (for he is borne of him) therefore we must also confesse, that Christ is the Sonne of God; thus then your question is answered.

                        By these parables that thou hast declared, it seemeth so in my iudgement: and that it may not be denied. For indeed thou hast expounded the matter truly and well: and I am glad of it, and in all things I am well satisfied.

                        I told thee, That those diuine and heauenly things which are not seene, are not comprehēded by the vnderstanding, neither are they conceiued of vs, but by the meanes of some other creatures of God.

                        Well, but I haue another doubt, and that also a great one. It seemeth that we cannot reade the Mosaicall bookes, for this purpose: And in like manner the Gospell, can we not reade for expositions and comments, although our Prophet do command the same.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                            SH.
                        How is this question another doubt?
                     
                     
                        AH.
                        The doubt is, That all those bookes were altered and corrupted by the Christians, especially the name of our Prophet, as the Musslemans do affirme.
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        Art thou then one of them which do thinke so?

                        I do verily beleeue as all other of them do beleeue.
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        But this is a foule error, for this reason onely: If the Mosaicall bookes and the Gospell had bene altered; or if they should haue bene one opposite to another, our Prophet would not haue said, That his writings should bee corrected by those bookes. And in like manner it cannot be said, That they were corrupted, for this one other reason also: For the Christians and the Iewes are contrary one to another, and there was alwaies enmity betweene them: But the text to them both is but one and the  same. In a word, the Hebrew text of the Iewes, doth agree with the Greeke and Latine texts word for word. Furthermore, after the daies of our Prophet, which was after Christ, somewhat more then 600 yeares, as I told thee yesterday, there were alwaies hereticks, as Arians, Nestorians, Iacobites, & others; seeing that they all haue one Gospell agreeing in all points: And for that because in diuerse languages, in the which they are found written: And that in all corners & kingdomes of the world, the text is found so to agree, that not so much as in one iot or title they do disagree; seeing it is thus, I say, it cannot be iustly said, that the Iewes and Christians haue agreed, throughout the whole world, of such diuerse nations, to blot ought out of the bookes aforesaid. Neither doth it satisfie reason to say, That they haue blotted  out the name of our Prophet, who in the Alkoran, in many places doth commend Christ, and the Virgine Mary his mother. Therefore if the Christians had put out any names, they would haue put out

the name of the Iew, which was the cause of his death; or the name of Pilate, who crucified Christ; not Mohammed, that commendeth him.

                        If this be thus, it is confessed by thee, that these bookes were neuer corrupted; and then, that they are bookes which had remained 600 yeares, to wit, from Christ vnto the coming of our Prophet.

                        By the aforesaid demonstrations, thou must of necessitie say so, willingly beleeue it, and confesse as much. For the contrary & aduerse opinion is euery way without any shew of probability, and hath no ground.

                        Our Prophet, in the Chapter Albakara, saith in the person of God himselfe: We haue sent downe the prophecie of God, and we haue kept it. Now it seemeth to me, that the meaning of this word Prophecie, is nothing else but the glorious Gospell.

                        We say, That God Almightie gaue the  Law to our Prophet last of all, as a

                           eale of the Prophets, and complement of the law of those which went before. How then is it giuen vnto the Mosaicall law and the Gospell?
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        We do also say, he is a generall Prophet to all Prophets. But wee know that he knew not any language but the Arabicke tongue only; neither did he speake any other language; neither had he learned any other tongue; And indeed the Alkoran is not found written in any other language but in the Arabicke tongue onely.

                        Therefore there remaineth yet another great difficultie, videl. How this law should be vniuersall, seeing that it is not found written but in the Arabick tongue onely; and for that this our Prophet could not speake any word of any other language: and because that he and his law were not for all men, & for all creatures or people.

                        AH.
                        Because I do see that God Almighty would first that the Gospell should be for a generall law to  all men: And therefore God of all goodnesse gaue the knowledge of all tongues miraculously to his Apostles, and to his Disciples and Preachers. Wherefore they by & by preached it throughout the whole world: and the Gospell was written in all languages. Now this thing was requisite for vs also to do, both for the honour of God, and his praise, as also for the saluation of our soules, throughout all kingdomes of the world; seeing that our Prophet doth say in the Chapter Amran, That no one man shall

be saued, but by his mediation or by his law, and not otherwise.

                        I told thee, that our Prophet saith, that himselfe doth not vnderstand his owne law; but God onely doth vnderstand it: for he is most skilfull. Who therefore can teach it, or know how to preach it?

                        Therefore we do follow that, which is vnknowne to vs. Now how much, and how grossely do they erre, which do not vnderstand, or haue not heard the law? But by your patience I vnderstand that this reason is not receiued as current.

                        AH.
                        Because that in the Alkoran there is in truth no sentence written, but it may be vnderstood of euery one that vnderstandeth the Arabicke tongue: Yea and thou knowest it: for thou had read much.

                        I know well, but in respect of the loftines of the phrases of our Prophet, I spake it.

                        But let vs leaue all other demonstrations, and let vs consider this one sentence onely, to wit, that saying, (That God gaue his law in the world, which may not be vnderstood, especially of those which follow i,t) it is beyond the reach of reason, and compasse of faith.

                        Truth it is, that this is strange: yet it may not be spoken of God Almightie. For an vnderstanding and iust man, doth not command to another man, any thing but that which he doth vnderstand, which is within his abilitie, & is possible for him to do. And so if God be most wise and iust, he will not force the soule to any thing, but that which is within compasse of it. This confession is sound, and thus we ought to

beleeue: For God is most wise and iust in very deed.

                        Yet I cannot but maruaile, how it cometh to passe, that our Prophet, in his Alkoran, which is the law of God, a serious matter, as wherein is declared the meanes of the saluation of our soules, hath inserted  in it such small matters, and so impertinent; As of the Ant, of the Smoake, and such like: for these do no way further a man in matters of religion or of his saluation. I pray you, what profite do you get by the Ant that did speake? or did not speake, but laugh? Or that the heauen was made of the smoake; and the smoake, of greene things and of the sea? And that the sea doth run from the mount Kaf, which doth compasse the whole world, and the earth, and supporteth the celestiall orbes?

and certainly knew that God gaue it. Thus also was the Gospell confirmed by miracles, and great wonders, which Christ first did; then his Apostles, and lastly his Disciples; As, the giuing of life vnto the dead in all sorts of men; The giuing of sight of the  eies to the blind: hearing to the deafe, health to those that were sicke of any manner of disease; as our Prophet doth also witnesse in the end of the Chapter Almaïda of his Alkoran.

                        Amongst all the good things that appertaine to a man, virginity, and purity of bodie is the chiefe, and greatest of all.

                        It is also the perfection of mankind: yet indeed it is not for euery one; but for Saints. Wee do reade in the law of Elias, that he was a virgine, and so did alway continue: Moreouer in the Gospell wee reade, that Iohn the sonne of Zachary, and Iohn one  of the disciples of Christ, were virgines. And indeed, that which is commended of all and receiued for truth; and is also of our Prophet receiued and greatly commended, is, that Mary, the virgine, the mother of Christ, was conceiued by the holy Ghost; and that after the birth of Christ she also remained a maid & virgine for euer as long as she liued. Now by this perfection, that is, by virginitie, it is knowne that he was

of God accepted for his perfection.

                        It is not sufficient to say it: but it shall bee prooued: for he that loueth perfection, he doth not only not do any vile thing: but he doth not so much as speake any misbeseeming speech. Now seeing that our Prophet did not onely write that he had many wiues: but he writeth also that he loued his maide, and lay with her; and thereupon when Aïsha his wife was angry with it and rebuked him, he promised with a great oath, that he would abstaine from her bed: Yet afterward in the Chapter Atta
                              •
                           rim he saith, That God did pardon and dispence with that oath for him, by the testimonie of Gabriel and Rachael: and therefore at another time also he lay with his maid, notwithstanding his promise aforesaid, & then his wife said nothing to it: Item, in the Chapter  Alahzab it is read that he tooke the wife of Zeid his seruant, vnto himselfe. And he saith, speaking it from God, that he doth not feare any man: for God gaue him the wife of Zeid.
                              Mohammed was a good familist.
                            Moreouer it is read also, that God willed him to lie with the wiues of the faithfull; that Prophets might be begotten by him; when as notwithstanding it is cleare, that there was

no Prophet begotten by him: For he did not leaue any issue male behind him. Seeing then that our law and the Alkoran is the law of God, which is iust and holy, how could our Prophet be absolued from that oath, which he did make concerning the lying with his maid, to saue himselfe from the breaking of the promise to his wife? And wherfore did God dispense with him, that he might haue the wife of Zeid; seeing that this is not matrimonie, but fornication, adulterie, and iniquity? In the Chapter Bakara, it is writtē also, That the wiues of men are as it were the seed-fields of the men, and euery man doth sow his wife  as pleaseth him best. Moreouer he saith, That he is lustie, and is as strong for carnall copulation, as 40 men are. Item, that it is not lawfull for a woman after her separation and diuorce, the third time to come vnto her husband againe, except first she haue lien with another man once. Now this is a thing more vile then may be spoken: although we do obserue it, like as other precepts of our Prophet. Now these being filthy and shamefull, how do they beseeme our law, which was giuen by God? Therefore I do demand an answer of thee; tell me therefore thine opinion concerning these matters: for I will heare thee very gladly.

Now we do know that by reason of their frowardnesse and malice, they are fallen into all sinnes. Moreouer also we know, That God which is good, is also the cause of all perfection, the fountaine and true cause of all perfection, and of all good things.

Now if this be true, then that cannot which followeth; videlicet, That the disciples of Christ did not follow Mohammed. For the Disciples of Christ were before Mohammed 600 yeares. Therefore this allegation is false. For they did not follow the Alkoran: because it was not written at that time.

For our Proph. doth cōmend, as is said before, the bookes of Moses, which are most methodically written from the creation of the world: and the Gospell, which is named of our Pro. the raies of the spirits and prophecy of Almighty God. Seeing that our Prophet doth commend these bookes, therfore he sheweth that he also did read these books.

For to morrow or straight after to morrow we shall dy: and then what gaine haue we made, if we haue not learned the truth, and to do according to the approbation of the will of the almighty and blessed God?

                        I am desirous to study, that I may learne to do as thou sayst: but mine vnderstanding doth not  rest & rely on parables, things not to be vnderstood, or vpon old stories. For in these things my soule findeth

no profite nor contentment. And indeed I loue & desire that knowledge that is profitable vnto faith and religion, and dependeth vpon the mysteries of almighty God: And I desire to reade that which is confirmed by great miracles.

                        Now in the law of our prophet it is not written that any thing was confirmed by miracles: For he himselfe doth confesse, that God did not giue him the gift of miracles: but the knowledge and skill of warre onely.

                        For miracles are indeede a manifest note of a Prophet, and of prophecy: and of the preachers of the will of God almighty, which loueth goodnes, & commandeth men to loue one another. But war, by which the world is oppressed & killed, and men are at great variance and strife, it is the instrument of Satan  which is the enemy of goodnes; and is the cause of all euill and troubles.

                        And indeed our Prophet did not worke any miracles: But the workes of God toward Mohammed were miraculous.

                        The comming of the Angell vnto his gate, was a great miracle: Item, the conference also of Albarak with him; Item, that in one moment and the twinkling of an eie he went that iourney, to wit, from Mecha vnto Ierusalem; where he found all the Prophets which long since were at rest: where our Prophet did call vpon them, and pray for them. Item, his visiō of the Stayres from the earth vnto heauen. Item, his going vp with the Angel vnto heauen, euen to the throne of God, and from thence to God

                           himself, of whō he receiued great fauours, as he saith.

                        Seeing that thou callest these things, miracles; answer me to this one other question of mine, which may be demanded of any skilfull and vnderstanding man, which is this; Our Prophet saith, All that before is spoken of, was done in one night, and yet neither his wife nor his maide did see Gabriel. Moreouer he saith also, That the Prophets which came, were the dead Prophets: Neither doth he say, that some of them were liuing. Wherefore if one should now say, That none of all these things were true; but were fained by him, that men might beleeue him, & his prophecy; what shalbe for an answer vnto this? For we haue no witnesses nor confirmation from the liuing; but he onely doth speake, and record, and also write so of him selfe.

                        He that beleeueth not these things, doth not likewise beleeue that he was absolued by God, concerning his oath that he made vnto his wife: because he saith, Gabriel and Rachael did onely testifie this; and it is also vnknowne. For he saith, This is solitary, and no man euer saw it; neither can we aske of any of them, whether this be true or false.

                        This also is necessary and worthy to be vnderstood & considered of, how hee describeth the orbes from the beginning of the sphere vnto the end of the same: where he sayth, The first spheare is made of pure siluer: and the Starres are hanged vpon the first spheare by chaines made of brasse: The second spheare of pure gold: The third of precious stones or  pearles: The fourth, of a Smaragd: The fifth, of pearles: The sixth, of Alahal. Now all this is confuted

by the Astronomers, and Philosophers: for Gold, Siluer, and Gemmes, or pretious Stones, are thicke bodies, and our eyes do not see through them, per modum transparentiae: that is, it is not possible that our sight should passe through them, from one to another. And this is apparent: For the body of the Sun is in the fourth spheare, and yet it enlighteneth all the world: And Mercury is in the second; Venus in the third: Mars, in the fifth: Iupiter, in the sixth: Saturne in the seuenth: The Starres in the eight; which by reason that they go into certaine clouds they are ofttimes not seene of vs; as the Sun also, whē the Moone falleth betwen it & vs. Now if our Prophet were true in this saying of his; that is, if the spheares were of  Gold, and siluer, & Gemmes; those things could not be seene of vs. But we do see the Starres, the Sunne, the Moone, and the rest of the Planets: and therefore, as we haue said, this is false, and he is not true in his word. And so may it be said of his communication with the Angell: of his ascension into heauen, and other falshoods of his. For all this fell out in one night, and that without testimony of any witnesse aliue.

                        He that will thus go on by way of solid demonstration, will deny also the aides, the cogitations, & suggestiōs, which God gaue to him in that night, as he saith.

                        This also is solid in mine opinion. For it is denied of euery man generally, to wit, that God did touch him with his hand, and did make him cold, as our Prophet doth write.

                        Because that euery one doth know, that God is a simple essence, not hauing any body: yet he saith, That God did touch his hand; attributing to God an hand, and other members, and affirming that God hath a body, attributing to him also coldnesse. Also, he saith, That he hath quality and quantity: and he attributeth to God quality which is annexed to quā
                           tity: which notwithstanding God is free from, and it is absurd to say otherwise: For that were a great scandall and heresie; nay it were Atheisme.

                        Yet of this oft times we ought to conferre, for knowledge of the truth, and to be able to distinguish  truth from falshood: that a man may be made good, and not bad. And if we do not thus, we shall walk without knowledge like blinde men and fooles: and we shall leade our life in this world, as beasts and vnreasonable creatures do. Now this were shameful, and the way vnto the destruction of the soule.

                        I do desire by all meanes, that we leaue this communication, speech, conference, or arguments, vntill another time and place. For I do study the Alkoran and other bookes seriously and diligently, and I finde many absurd things, without sence, and also such as are not confirmed by miracles: Yea there are innumerable and infinite such things as these in the Alkoran and in our law, which are repugnant & contrary one to another, and are opposite to all Philosophers and Astronomers; and much also which hath

no ground, or proofe from demonstration; nor yet  is confirmed by manifest miracles from God: and therefore let our conference end at this place: seeing that I see the pilgrimes do stay, and dispose of their tents and luggage where they meane to rest themselues: Let vs also do as they do; and let vs be neere one another here; and to morrow, by Gods grace, we shall haue time to conferre againe of this matter: and then let vs speake of such things as may also concerne vs to know for our saluation.

For this thy loue to comprehend all briefly cannot be found in all men. For euery man forgetteth himselfe, and  his minde also inclineth vnto the loue of this transitory world and delights of the same, (& reuiueth not according to the conceipts of the soule,) the lusts of which do spoile the body, and pollute the soule; and, in a word, do kill the soule and body too.

                        Yesterday also thou toldst me as much. This

is a foule fault of our men, the Musslemans I meane; nay I dare boldly affirme it to be a grosse errour, seeing that all the sacred bookes haue bene found from the beginning in all languages, and in all kingdomes, and seeing that euery one of them do agree one with another. Moreouer, it is incredible. For our Prophet doth say, that we ought to receiue the exposition and declaration of those ancient bookes; And, that they were changed at that time, or at this time,  our Prophet doth not say any such word: and therefore thou oughtest not to say so. For it is far from the opinion of men of vnderstanding: and beside that, it is a grosse errour.

                        I would say; Because these bookes are giuen of God, as it is manifest to all the world: and that for more then 600 yeares before our Prophet was borne; this our Musslemans ought to beleeue, That those books were true; & that they do cōtaine true things; and that they were as they are, agreeing in all languages: For one and the same truth is in all their mouthes alwaies.

And without doubt we are bound to reade all bookes which our Prophet hath giuen commendations of. For out of all doubt, when our Musslemans do vnderstand our law as they ought to vnderstand it, they will order their conuersation and liues vnto that end and purpose in which our soules may finde true and eternall rest.

                        Truly it were a good thing, that all the world with one mouth would beleeue and confesse, That as God is one, so also the way whereby we come vnto him is one; not many, as men do say and determine.

                        Tell me, I adiure thee by God Almighty, The ancient Prophets, which were from the beginning vnto the time of our Prophet, what? did they agree between themselues? For I haue heard that they were not all of them in one time: but that some of them were in one age, and some in another age. And some  of them speake of one thing, and some of another.

                        Herehence also it appeareth plainely, that they were in very deed the Prophets of God, & were enlightened and taught of him. For all their speeches tend vnto one and the same end and purpose, that is, to remoue men from the seruice of idoles, which had their seruice after the manner and forme of the very true God: And all of them with one cōsent preached and declared the coming of Iesus, that is, of Christ, which was borne of Mary the Virgine; and of the holy Ghost, as our Prophet doth also plainely affirme.

                        So it is, and in that time the religion of Christ (by the misery and affliction of the Martyrs giuing testimony) passed into all the world: and the glorious Gospell was also written in all languages.

                        I would faine vnderstand whether that in the interim of that sixe hundred yeares betweene Christ and our Prophet, there were sent any other Prophet from Almighty God vnto the world?

                        Know thou, that all the Prophets were sent from God at sundry times; and haue preached and taught the very true God; and haue declared that Christ was the end & the accomplishment of the old Law; and the beginning of the new Law. And the last of these Prophets was Iohn the son of Zachary, which did not onely foretel of Christ; but did preach of his birth, & did point him out with his finger, whē he saith, This is the Lambe of God. And when all the  sayings of the Prophets, of the coming of Christ the holy one, which was the argumēt of their preaching, were ended; not so much as one more was sent from Almighty God, in these 600 yeares: yea neither will he send any other Prophet: for there was no need of any other Prophet, when Iesus was come, which was the Prophet of Prophets, and their Lord: And seeing that in him all the sayings of the Prophets are accomplished, there shall come onely in the last time, Antichrist, which is named Dagial: And after him shall come Iesus in his glorie to iudge the quicke and the dead: and to giue the faithful and good ones,

Paradise: and to the froward and sinners, grieuous torments in Hell.

                        This good consent amongst the Prophets, and this end also, which is the argument handled by  
                           them all, to wit, of the coming of Christ, is a matter worth the consideration, and I do confesse that I neuer heard of it before, nor vnderstood it.

                        I neuer heard that Iohn the sonne of Zacharias was the last of the Prophets, & the seale of thē all: and therefore I haue wondered how he, amongst vs Musslemans, became so famous, and his name so honorable: and wherefore the day of his natiuity, in all parts of the world, is kept holy.

                        What wonder is it, when thou hearest of his excellency which he had aboue all the Prophets? to wit, that he did behold and point out also to others who it is, which of all the holy Fathers and Prophets was desired to be seene, to wit, Isay, or Iesus Christ that was foretold of all the Proph. & was agreed vpō.

                        Seeing then that he, to wit, Iohn, was the sealer  vp of the sayings of the Prophets: and that all their sayings were fulfilled by reason of the coming of Christ, there was no need that there should be any thing spoken by any new Prophet: for there 
                              •

                        And these are those things which euery one

                        Truth it is, this is a great madnesse of this  world: for we know that our Prophet did commend all the Mosaicall books, & the books of the Prophets, and beyond all compasse the glorious Gospell; And he saith, These bookes are as it were an exposition of the figures of our law: & yet we do contemne them, & do not translate, nor turne them into our language, that we might view them.

                        And it behooueth euery one of vs to consider, seeing that our Prophet saith, That they are sacred & good bookes, and were giuen of God, whether he say true or no. If he say true, then we ought to reade them for profite sake. If he do not speake truth, wherefore do we say, that our Prophet is true? But without doubt the history is so. For the world from 600 yeares before our Prophet, as we haue sayd, did know it: and that before these bookes. And the verity and truth of them, doth testifie that they are holy & good.

                        Also, I do affirme, that our Prophet in the Chapter Almaida doth say these words, That the study of this booke is altogether vaine, if withal the Gospell & the law be not obserued: Therfore the Musslemans must vnderstand the intention of this booke.

                        SH.
                        And because I do see that it is a necessary place

therefore if the words bee so perspicuous, I say to thee againe the second time in sober sadnes, that thou and all such as thou art ought to obserue it well, and that for good reason: for our Prophet speaketh these words, and yet we do not translate them.

                        This was for our disobedience. And for our other sins, I do beleeue that our Prophet spake these words vnto his sectaries, that is, You shal be separated  farre off from me vnto the seuenty three generation, and one onely shall enter into Paradise: the rest all of them shall go to the fire.
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        But I say to thee, that in the chapter Mary he saith thus, That all the Musslemans shall go into the fire: and of this I am afraid: For in asmuch as he saith, All, no one is excepted: and therefore it behooueth vs in this our life, to consider our estates, and to labour with great endeuour, that we do not go into Gehenna, and eternall perdition.

                        We according to the saying of our Prophet are more abhominable then the Iews and Christians: for in the Chapter Baccara he saith, That the Iewes & Christians shall go into Paradise.
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        And in the Chapter Abraham he saith, That not any one shall go into Paradise, but by the meanes of our law. Now this is contrary to the former; and  truth is not figured out by contrarieties; but in the Alkoran, in many places, you shall finde contrarieties: And these contrarieties amongst vs are the cause of other brutish opinions. Now this doth not fall out to those that reade the glorious Gospell, and do informe themselues after the precepts thereof. But it is manifest, that good Christians, when they are found in

any tentation & misery of this world, at that instant their soules are replenished with the loue of God, and in the sense thereof they do exceedingly reioyce.

                        This reioycing and this power, which is in the soules of the Christians, in the midst of miserie and tentatiō in this world, is demonstrated from that glory and the blessednesse, which God will giue them for euer, that is, Paradise.

                        Our Prophet in the Chapter Almaïda speaketh  altogether cōtrary to that which thou now speakest. For he in that Chapter doth shew, that the Iews and Christians shall not be the sonnes of God, nor any of his friends. And this is manifest by the misery and oppression in this world which God doth lay vpon them for their sinnes.

                        Now in mine opinion, from hence it cannot be argued, that they are not the friends of God: But what is thine opinion of this matter?
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        With me that is firme and good that is receiued amongst the learned in generall, and of the wisemen of the world; that is, That the Iewes were afflicted of God, and were dispersed, as it doth appeare plainely, 1000 yeares ago and more; and that they are without a Temple, without sacrifice, and without a Priest, for this sin of apostasie onely, which they did do against Christ, which was the Word of the euerlasting  God, and his eternall Sonne, as I shewed thee yesterday.
                     
                     
                        AH.
                        What dost thou say then of the afflictions of the Christians, which God layeth vpon them?
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        This is not like vnto the misery of the Iewes: for in all that religion, the Christians haue a Priest, &

Churches: and they do sacrifice their sacrifices, praise God, and his glorious name, not onely in the place where they haue the sole command; but also in Constantinople, Egypt, Arabia, in Ada the new,
                              That is, the Ilands.
                            in the Sea, and in all quarters of the world. Therefore we ought to say, that their miseries do testifie the loue of God toward them, as Salomon the wise doth affirme, when he sayth, That a good father doth chastise his sonne whom he loueth, very much: and Dauid the Prophet saith, The good through many miseries & great tentations shall enter into the kingdome  of God: And moreouer, That the good are tried of God, as the gold which is tried in the fire. And therefore I, when I do see man in felicity in this world; and according to his desire to enioy worldly matters, without any crosse at all, euen at that instant I am afraid of him. For Dauid the Prophet also saith, I haue seene the wicked exalted and magnified; and I went out, and he was gone; and I asked after him, and he was not to be found, and there was no signe of his place in the which he had bene. Therefore the sayings which are in the Chapter Almaïda, cannot signifie, that the Christians, by reason of the misery which at some time they do suffer, are not the sonnes nor friends of God: but it doth teach the contrary; & that by the testimony of Dauids owne words: neither  is there any thing else that I am able to say to it.

                            that Salomon was exceeding wise: whether was that he that is mentioned in the chapter Amemela, that had a great army of Angels, of men, and other liuing creatures: and when Salomō found the Ants innumerable as the running

waters, he commanded one of them to go into their holes: and after that it spake with Solomon, and laughed also, as it is recorded in that Chapter.

                        How can it be vnderstood as a parable, it not being in it owne nature true? For neither had Solomon any such army, neither did the Ant so miraculously speake or laugh.
                     
                     
                        SH.
                        I do maruell at thee: for thou doest shew thy selfe to haue little vnderstanding; in that thou doest not know that Solomon, which was the son of Dauid, did neuer leuy any armies, neither of Angels, nor of beasts: but he was very learned, and of great wisedome, as it appeareth by his speeches and books. and that it was he which built the Temple at Ierusalem. For he was so commanded by God in the same glorious Ierusalem: but there is no record made by him of any army, or of such an Ant, or of any such miracle with the Ant; or of the beasts.

                           ound, which is recorded in the Alkoran. And this was one of those wormes which did manifest the death of Solomon to the Diuels.

                        In it also, as I thinke, is recorded many things like that of the Ant: for in it is recorded, that Solomō
                           
died, and yet remained leaning vpon his staffe:
                              A Talmudica

                            and the Diuels which did minister vnto him, were ignorant of his death, vntill one of the worms did eate in two his staff; which being broken Solomon fel down: and at that very instant time they vnderstood of the state of his death: And they at that selfe same time did lift vp their heads, and were aduersaries and opposite to mankinde. Now all this is not true, neither likely to be true; neither do I know for what reason our Prophet hath written it. For this parable is no way profitable to vs.

                        That booke, where the law and the commandements  of God are written, ought to record nothing but such things as are high and diuine, because of the prerogatiue and excellency of our vnderstanding, & apprehension in the speculation of heauenly things, and vnderstanding of the maiestie of God. And by reason of these friuolous things and parables which are read in this Azoara, and in that other Azoara, in very deed they do not beseeme, neither are they worthy of that booke, seeing that none of them are any way profitable vnto vs.

                        I told thee, that our Prophet doth prefer the vnderstanding of his booke and his law vnto the holy books of the old Testament, and of the glorious Gospel, as the true cōmentary. For he also hath taught, that the books of Moses, and the bookes of the Prophets, and Gospell, do containe the high and profitable senses conuenient for all. Now I do not know why we  do not translate them: seeing that it is a great danger to our soules.

                        I also do acknowledge that the reading of

these bookes are profitable and conuenient: seeing that our Prophet doth much commend them: but yet I am not content, neither doth it seeme to me an equall thing, that wee Musslemans, with all our iniquities which do spring out of vs, should beleeue that we shall enter into Paradise, onely for the confession of the vnity of God; and that his Prophet Mohammed is of God. For the confession of the vnity is not denied of the Iews, no nor of the Christians. Therefore this confession is without any particular reward to vs. The confession also, That Mohammed is his Prophet and his friend, what profite haue we by this confession?

                        For the seruice of God & his praise, as is meet, we  ought to stirre vp our vnderstandings vnto things of the deepest conceipt. Also we ought before all things to know, seeing that God, which is iust and pure, and the fountaine of goodnes and perfection, hath created man after his own image, and likenesse according to himselfe; that is, hath made him most perfect, and without sinne: that therefore after the disobedience of the Man, and the fault which he had committed, of necessity euery man must worke iniquity, vntill he be restored vnto his former iustice and antecedent perfection; the obtaining of which is impossible, but by the helpe of God, and knowledge of his gloririous law, and by the doing of good workes, according to the determination of his glorious will and pleasure.

                        This deepe speculation is not like that miracle of the Ant. And I do beleeue that our Prophet did not write that Chapter wherein is recorded so

lofty matters as those precedent things, and the Gospel are. And because he saith, Those books were giuen  by God, he signifieth, that those bookes do containe all perfections and goodnesse. Therefore we ought to confesse, that those bookes appertaine vnto the saluation of all the world, & of euery seuerall person in the same.

                        Yea, & I do confesse, that from all eternity those bookes were holy: and therefore I do know that all the Musslemans do offend: and I do pity the case in which I do see they are: because I do see that we might finde those bookes, and reade them, and yet we do not. As it is said, we do leaue the white bread, & that which is most pleasing: & we do eat brown bread which is no way so pleasing in tast, nor so good for the body. And this difference there is betwene words of verity and truth, and falshood: For this is pleasant vnto the vnderstanding, and profitable to the soule: and that is no way pleasing, but hurtfull: for it is a  vaine thing, and it hath no commodity in it, because it is false. But let this suffice: for I see the the rest do take downe their tents. I pray God that this consideration may enter into the heart of all and euery Mussleman: that euery one of vs may consider and direct his mind vnto such matters as do appertaine vnto his soule, as vnto the true end, I meane the saluation of our soules: for all things of this world are fraile and vnconstant. Now those things which according to their essence are transitory, do not deserue but to be passed ouer, and not to be had in any regard amongst men.

For this conference was very beneficiall vnto me, by thy meanes, and I shall thinke alwaies of this thy kindnes, and I shall desire of God that he will reward thee for it.

For the better vnderstanding therefore not onely of this present Treatise of ours, but generally of all histories of the Saracens, Persians, Indians, Turks, & Africans: as also of all bookes and treatises written of their superstition and ceremonies, I haue, for thy good, gentle Reader, in the midst of my many and great troubles, procured by the fraudulent practises of the wicked, according to my best ability, and small helpe that I haue, out of those kinde of writings gathered and composed these two Treatises ensuing; The one containing a

Catalogue of all such Arabicke termes and words vsed by historians: The other an Index of the Chapters of the Alkoran. But some man may say, That in those histories there are many other strange words found that here I haue not mentioned; I answer, it is true. But those being for the most part Turkish or Persian, that is, barbarous and out of the compasse of my skill, I leaue them to be handled by others. Againe, if any man shall finde that we haue omitted diuerse, euen of this nature here by vs nominated, let him know, that we could not seriously reade ouer all books of that argument; onely wee did for this purpose but lightly cast our eye ouer some of the principallest, and such as we could haue the vse of at this time.

Of this that forenamed booke doth thus write: Anno vicesimo quinto fundatum est Alkaba: Anno verò quadragesimo Machumet Propheta datus est. In the 25 yeare, the Alcaaba was begun to be built; and in the 40 yeare Mohammed our Prophet was borne. And like as we reade that Daniel, and other of the Saints of God, being in exile or in forraine countries, did make their prayers and orisons toward Ierusalem: so the Turks, in imitation of them, do vsually pray with their faces toward this temple.

Now what manner of men these be, the historians shall tell thee: Turcici sacerdotes, à laicis haud multum differunt: Satis enim illis est, si Alcoranum legere, & Turcicè ad verbum interpretari norint. The Turkish priests do not much differ from their lay-men: For it is enough for them, if they can reade the Alkoran, and also interpret it word for word into Turkish. Which also M. Syluaticus doth affirme: Alfachi, est qui docet matrimonium contrahere Arabes; & qualiter debeant orare. Et est doctor legis, qui non probat quicquā. Nam praeceptis legis credere oportet sine argumentatione. Mutali verò est philosophus, qui probat quod docet necessarijs argumentis. An Alfakih, saith Matt. Syluaticus, is he that amongst the Arabians doth solemnise mariages, and teacheth them how they ought to pray. He is a doctor or teacher of their law, but he need not prooue or demonstrate ought that he teacheth. For a man ought to beleeue the grounds of the law without any proofe. Now the Mutaali is a Philosopher or scholer, which prooueth by necessary consequences that which he goeth about to teach.

                        ALGARBII, or Garbij, are a people belonging to the kingdome of Portugall, whose countrey or prouince where they dwel is called Regnum Algarbiorum. The word signifieth, the Westerne-men. And indeed they possesse the vttermost part of Spaine toward the West. And for the same reason was the whole countrey of Spaine, of the Greeks, called Hesperia; because it lieth not onely on the West of Italy; but is also of all the maine land or continent of Europe, the most Westerly part: yea of the whole world, I meane of that which was at that time knowne to the Romanes or Greeks. This kingdome is bounded, as we haue said, vpon the West and South by the Ocean sea, vpon the East by the riuer Guadiana: how farre it extended Northward, he doth not tell, neither dare I determine.

continetur, nomine dotis assignauit. Ex eo postea matrimonio natus est Alphonsus, qui primus Portugalliae Rex est appellatus: Primus qui Ulixbonam à Mauris recepit. Quorum quinque simul regibus vno praelio superatis, quinque scutorum insigne facti monumentum reliquit. To Portugal at this time, saith the learned Ortelius, doth belong the kingdome of the Algarbij, which is the sea coast of it toward the South. For that king doth stile himselfe, King of Portugallia, Algarbia, Guinea, AEthiopia, Arabia, Persia and India. This kingdome did first begin in the yeare of our Lord 1100. For euen vnto that time, as anciently it hath bene, it was accounted as a part of Spaine. For thus doth Marineus describe this history: One Henry Earle of Loraine, a valiant man, well experienced in warlike affaires, coming thither out of France, did great seruice against the Saracens. For the which Alphonsus the VI, king of Castile gaue him in mariage a bastard daughter of his, called Tiresia, & withall did assigne in lieu of a dowrie, that part of Gallecia, which is contained within the kingdome of Portugall. Of this mariage did afterward spring Alphonsus which was the first king of Portugall, and was he that recouered Lisbone out of the hands of the Moores. Who also ouercoming in one set battaile fiue of their kings in one day, left vnto his successors for the armes of that kingdome fiue scutcheons, for a memoriall of that honorable atchieuement of his.

This aera or epocha of the Arabians beginneth, as many do thinke, from the time that Mohammed their Prophet fled from Mecha, to Iethrab: (following herein, as seemeth, the nature of the word, which signifieth a flight, or running away:) or from the time of the first publication of his cursed law, which the learned do rather applaud.

                        AMIR, Amira, Amiras, or Admirant, as some haue it, signifieth a commander, lieutenant or president. Imperium obtinens, or admirans regni, as others interpret it.

Herehence is that title of the kings of Barbary, one of whose titles is, Amira'lmowminin, or as Leo Africanus doth conceiue and write it, Miralmuminus, that is, Praeses fidelium, The prouost of the faithfull. Of which one thus speaketh, Miralmuminus, quae vox Principem credentium significat: Historici nostri corruptè vocant Miramulinum. Primus omnium qui se hoc titulo insigniuit fuit Abedramon, qui Maroci vrbem maximam condidit.

Or lastly they are Arabì Mustehgeme, Arabes Barbari. Item, Mozarabes, are Arabians mingled with other nations. Item Mozarabica, hocest, as mine author doth informe me, cum Arabico mixta.

                        AZZEKOM, or as it is sometime ignorantly written, Alzekom, it is a tree whose fruite is exceeding bitter; of which the blasphemer saith, that the wicked shall feed on in hell.

This is cited out of the 37 Chapter of the Alkoran, which is intituled Assora Assaphet; The words there according to Retinensis are these, Arbor Ezetius (tu scribe, Ezecus, vel rectiùs, Ezzecum) ob malos plantata cyros, sicut diabolorū capita gestans, & ex sua radice Gehennae focum emittens. Vnde cibandi increduli, ventres suos farciunt. pag. 139.

Haec caregio est quae dactylos producit. Yet it taketh not the name or denomination from thence: For then it should haue bene called Bleda'ttamar, or Bleda' nnachel. For as in Ebrew, so in Arabicke, Tamar with tau, signifieth a Date: so that the fruite that is called a Tamarind, is nothing else but a Date of India. Itē, the same fruite is in Arabicke named Nachel, not Gerid, as they would haue vs beleeue.

                        BENI, or Bani, signifieth sonnes, or nephewes, that is, grandchildren. It is a word often read preposed before other words: which therefore do not properly signifie any set place: but rather some name of a family, nation, kinred, or cast as they call it.

                        HALEB, Heleb, Halep, is that famous city or marttowne, which we commonly call Hallepo, or Allepo.

                        TARIFA, signifieth the end, outside, or outmost bound of any thing. Hereupon many places in Arabia, and in

places where the Arabian colonies haue bene seated, do take their name. In Spaine the city which was anciently called Carteia, in the outmost skirts of Andalusia, is now called Tarifa. Carteia in Hispania ad Calpe promontorium sita, post dicta est Tarifa. Carteia, a city in Spaine, situate vpon the forelād called Calpe, was afterward named Tarifa. Item.

There is also a fountaine or spring neare vnto this place which is called of the Geographers Fons Tarifius. The historian was deceiued. For these places were not so named of Tarif, a Captaine: but of their position and situation, as I haue said. For so that foreland or promontory in Cornwall, which we call The Lands end, the Arabian Geographer calleth Tarfi'lgarbi mina' lgezira, the West bound of the Iland.

                  Gathered and digested according to their naturall order, for the benefite of Diuines, and such as fauour these studies. By W.B.

                  To the Reader.
                  THE booke of the famous impostour Mohammed the Arabian, called in that language the Koran, or, with the article, the Alkoran, is, as the word doth signifie, the Text, that is, the authenticall body of their law, and ground of that religion. For this word, both in signification and nature, is the same that Mikra
                           •
                        , or Hammikra, is to the Iewes. For that interpretation deliuered by Robert of Reading our countreyman, and receiued for good by Peter Abbot of Cluniak, Ricoldus Florentinus, Demetrius Cydonius, Cantacuzenus the Grecian, Cardinall Cusa, and others, who would haue it to signifie Collectionem praeceptorum, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is, A collection of holy precepts, doth not expresse the true originall, or Etymology of the word. For the theame or roote, as they call it, from whence it is deriued, is not Karan, to conioyne or knit together: but Kara', to reade, as all men skilfull in the Grammars of these Easterne tongues can beare me witnesse.
                  This booke is deuided into sundry sections or Chapters, which they call Assurats, or Azoara's, after Retinensis expression. An Index or Catalogue, of which I did some three or foure yeares since, at the request of M.Th. Erpenius of Gorchom in Holland, a zealous louer of these studies, gather and compose in manner and forme as here thou seest. Of the names and number of

these Chapters all Authors do not agree betweene themselues. For our countrey man, who first of all others, to my knowledge, did translate this booke out of Arabicke into Latine, (whom Ariuabene the Italian, doth follow word for word) numbreth 124. Euthymius Z

                     es in Barbary, do constantly with one consent reckon 114. The reason of this difference is thus: Some interpretours do not account the first for any Chapter, but make it a kinde of Preface or preamble. Retinensis of the second chapter, maketh foure: of the third, three: of the fourth, foure: of the fifth, two: and of the sixth, three: That is, the fiue first Chapters he deuideth into 1
                        •

Retinensis, and such as follow him do write it Azoara; which a learned man, that hath written briefe Annotations vpon the Alkoran, doth thus interpret; Azoara Arabice, saith he, vultus Latinè dicitur. Vnde quod nos Capitulum dicimus, illi vocant Azoaram. Sicut enim Vultus maxime quis vel qualis sit homo docet: Sic capitulum, quid sequens litera dicere velit. Secundum quosdam Azoara oraculum sonat.

                      then the etymology of the word. For truth it is, that this booke is a kind of rude Poëme, or hobbling kind of rythme. Now these Chapters are also diuersly cited: for sometimes they name them, as they are called by the Arabians sometime they are cited by the interpretation of the same Arabicke word. As for example, the title of the second Chapter is Albacara; which word in that language signifieth, A cow. Therefore of some writers, this second Chapter is cite
                        •
                      by the name of Azoara bacara, or Sorato' lbacara. By others, by the name of Azoara vaccae, or Canticum bouis. Therefore that we might euery way, to our vttermost, further the Reader, we haue here in this our Index, set downe both the one and the other; to wit, the Arabicke titles first in Romane capitall letters: then the interpretation of the same in Latine, as they are done by the afore named Authors.
