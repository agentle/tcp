beſyly nyght & day in bookis of poetis of holy
ſcryptur: Hit happed ſo that about mydlent he was

the Iuge thou ſaiſt not ſothe for thou art an hethen
man and nought a cryſten man / For where thy treſore
is there is thy herte And thy herte is more vpō

coud not anſuere but oon of the iuges bade bete

than ſait Ierom ſwere tofore the iuge almyghti god
And ſaid lord if euer I haue ony ſeculer or worldly

And anon he lyued ayen and fond hym ſelf alle be
wepte and hys body ſore and fulle of woūdes of the
betyng that he suffred afore the iuge: And fro thens
forthe he ſtudyed and redde as besily vpon holy bokes
as he hadde doon tofore vpon worldly bookis
Than he made hym ſelf a monk and ther he liued

whan he was xxxix yere of age he was made a cardinal
preſt in the chyrch of rome And after the pope
was dede al folke cryed that ierome was worthy to
be pope But for as moche as he had vſed to blame
the fleſſhelynes of myſgouerned clerkis and religiouſe
peple they with gret indignacōn lay in a wayt

chyrch. wening it had be his owne: whiche his enemyes
hadde leyed by his beddis forto make folke
wene that he had a woman in his chambre: & ſo to
ſcorne him / And whan he ſee theyr malyce he fledde
thens and come to conſtantinnoble and ther he comyned
wyth the biſſhop of holy ſcripture and ſithen
went in to deſert and ther he ſuffred gret penaunce
and diſſeſe un yere to gydre: wherfore he writeth vn
to the ſaid holy mayde Euſtace and ſeith whan I
was in deſerte in grete wyldrenes wher is a ful horrible
dwellyng place all to brent with the ſonne me
thought I was among the delices of rome Alle my
body was deformed and cladde in a ſack & my ſkin
made blak lyke an ethiope or man of ynde / Euery

I ſpake not whan they that be ſike vſe ther but cold

I was felow of ſcorpyons and of wylde beſtes / 

And yet in thys cold body & in my dede fleſſh I ſelt
brenninges & ſturinges of vnclennes: And therfore
ſith they fele ſuche temptacions that ſo deſpiſe their
bodyes and fight only with theyr thoughtes: what
ſuffre the men or wymen that lyue in delyces ſothely
as the apoſtel ſaith they lyue in body: but they are
ded in ſoule / But our lord is my wytnes that after
many wepynges / ful often tymes me ſemed that I

And vnto his ende he lyued a virgine. alſo he wrot
