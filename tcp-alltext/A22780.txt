of Englande.
            Cum priuilegio.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            
               THe lawe is the miniſtracion
of iuſtice / and iuſtice
is a conſtante and apermanent
mynde & wyll to
render vnto euery ꝑſone his ryght
and dutye. The prudencye of lawe
is a knowlege of diuyne & humane
thynges / a ſcience and perfyte notice
of equite and iniquite / of ryghtuouſnes
and vnryghtuouſnes.
            And foraſmoch as a great porcion
of the prudencye of ye lawes of this
realme cōſiſteth in the ꝑfyte knowlege
of eſtates, in landes and tenementes:
we ſhall fyrſt as compendiouſly,
and as ſimply and playnly
as we can treate of eſtates.
         
         
            ¶A diuiſion of eſtates.
            ¶Ye ſhall vnderſtande, that who
ſo euer hath any eſtate in landes or
tenemētes, eyther he hath ī ye ſame
onely a chatell / a free holde / or an

inheritaūce. Yf he hath an eſtate in
the lande but for terme of certayne
yeres, or at wyl: ſo is it called a chatell
/ yf for terme of his lyfe or of an
others lyfe, it is called a free holde,
or franke tenement / yf he hath it to
hym & to his heyres in ſee ſimple,
or in tayle: ſo he hath an eſtate of
inheritaunce.
         
         
            ¶Tenaunt for terme
of yeres.
            ¶Tenaunt for terme of yeres, is
he to whom landes or tenementes
be leſſed for the terme of certayne
yeres, as is agreed bitwene ye land
lorde and the tenaunt. And whan
the leſſee doth entre by force of the
ſayd lees, and is an actuall poſſeſſion
of the ſame: than he is called
tenaunt for terme of yeres.
            And here ye ſhal note, that if the
leſſour that made the lees hath reſerued

vnto hym a yerely rent vpō
the ſaid lees (as it is accuſtomably
vſed to be done) yf ye rent be behynd
it ſhall be in his election eyther to
entre and diſtrayne for the rent, or
to brynge an action of dette againſt
him at the lawe, for the arreragies
of the ſame. But in this caſe it is
requyred that the leſſour be ſeaſed
of the landes or tenementes at the
tyme of the makyng of the lees, for
otherwyſe it ſhall be a good plee in
the action of dette for the tenaunte
to ſay that the leſſour had nothyng
in the lande or tenement at ye tyme
of the lees made: excepte the lees
were made by dede indented / for
than the plee ſhall not lye in the
mouthe of the tenaunte or leſſee to
plede.
            And it is to be knowen that in a
lees for terme of yeres, by dede or

without dede, there nede no lyuery
of ſeaſon to be made to ye leſſee, but
he may entre whan he wyll by vertue
of his lees, without any further
ceremonye of lawe.
            Note alſo, that yf a man leſſeth
landes for terme of yeres, thoughe
the leſſour chaunceth to dye before
the leſſee doth entre, yet he may entre
well ynoughe. Otherwyſe it
is where as lyuery of ſeaſon is to
be made: as in free holdes, and in
inherytaunces.
            Alſo yf ye tenaunt for yeres doth
waſte, the landlord may brynge an
action of waſte agaynſt hym, and
ſhall recouer the place waſted, and
his treble damages.
         
         
            ¶Tenaunt at wyll.
            ¶Tenaunt at wyl, is he to whom
landes or tenementes be leſſed to
haue and holde the ſame at ye wyll

of the leſſour. And in this caſe the
leſſour may put out his tenaunt at
what tyme hym lyſteth. But yet
neuertheles, yf the tenaunt haue
ſowed the groundes with corne, yf
the leſſour wyll entre and put out
his tenaūt before harueſt, the lawe
wyll gyue hym free cōmynge and
goyng to repe and carye his corne
awaye without any punyſhment
bicauſe he knewe not at what time
the leſſour wolde entre. But otherwyſe
it is of ye tenaunt for certeyne
yeres / for if he ſoweth the grounde
and his terme be expired before the
corne be rype, in this caſe yt leſſouror
he ī the reuerſion may entre and
take the corne, bycauſe it was the
foly of the tenaunt to ſowe ye groūd
knowynge the ende of his terme.
            In lykewyſe tenaunt at wyll ſhall
haue free cōmyng and goyng after

the time of ye leſſours entree to cary
away his houſhold ſtuffe & goodes
for a reaſonable ſpace.
            ¶Ye ſhal alſo vnderſtande that he
that maketh a lees at wyll may reſerue
an annuel rent, in which caſe
yf the rent be behynde, he may entre
and diſtreyne the goodes and catelles
of the tenaunt, or at his election
brynge an action of dette agaynſt
hym.
            Alſo it is to be knowen that tenaūt
at wyll of a meſe or tenement
is not bound by thorder of lawe to
ſuſteyne & repayre the houſes that
be ruynous as is the tenaunt for
yeres / and therfore none action of
waſte lyeth agaynſt him. Yet yf he
do voluntary waſte: as yf he plucketh
downe the houſes, or cutteth
downe ye trees: it hath ben thought
that the leſſour may brynge an action

of treſpace agaynſt hym.
         
         
            ¶Tenaunt by copy of
courte roll.
            ¶There is an other kynde of tenaunt
at wyll, whiche is by copye
of the courte rolles. And this is
whan a man is ſeaſed of a maner
wtin whiche it hath ben vſed tyme
out of mynde, that the tenauntes
within the precinet of the ſaid maner,
haue holden landes and tenementes
to them and theyr heyres
in fee ſimple, fee tayle, or for terme
of lyfe, at the wyll of the lorde accordynge
to the cuſtome of the maner.
And ſuche can not aliene or ſell his
lande by his dede / for yf he do, the
lande ſo aliened and ſolde, is forfayted
ī to the lordes handes / but yf he
wyll alieue his copy holde laude to
another, he muſt accordynge to the
cuſtome, come into the courte, and

there ſurrender it in to the lordes
hande, to the vſe of hym that ſhall
haue the ſtate. The forme of which
ſurrender is this.
            Ad hanc curiam venit A. de B. & ſurſū

            ¶Theſe as I ſayd be called tenaū
               tes
by copye of courte roll / bycauſe
they haue none other euidence concernynge
theyr landes, ſaue onely
the copyes of the rolles of theyr lordes
courte.
            
               
Neyther can theſe tenauntes ſue
or be ſued for ſuche landes in the
kynges courte by wryte or otherwyſe
/ but yf they wyll implede or
ſue others for ſuche landes, they
muſt do it by waye of playnt in the
lordes courte after this ſorte.

F. G. &c.
            ¶Nowe althoughe ſome ſuche tenauntes
haue an inheritaunce accordynge
to the cuſtome of the maner,
yet in very dede they are but tenauntes
at the wyll of the lorde.
            For as ſome men thynke yf ye lorde
wyll expell them & put them forth
they haue no remedye at all, but to

ſue vnto theyr lorde by peticion, deſyrynge
him to be good vnto them.
For yf they myght haue any remedye
by the lawe, than ſhold they not
be called (ſay they) tenaūtes at the
wyll of the lorde, after the cuſtome
of the maner. But other men of no
leſſe lernynge and prudencye haue
ben of contrarye ſentence: as lorde
Bryan chife iuſtyce, in the tyme of
kynge Ed. the. iiii. whoſe opynyon
was alwayes that if ſuch tenaunt
by ye cuſtom (payeng his ſeruices)
be eiected and put forth by his lord
without cauſe reaſonable he may
very well brynge and maynteyne
an action of treſpace agaynſte his
lorde at the cōmon lawe: as appereth.
H. xxj. Ed. iiij. Alſo lord Danby
chyefe iuſtice in lykewyſe, was
of the ſame iudgement: as appereth.
M. vij. Ed. iiij. where he ſaith

that the tenaunt by the cuſtome is
as well īheritable to haue his land
after ye cuſtome, as is he that hath
a free holde at the cōmon lawe / but
the determinacion of this queſtion
I remytte to my great mayſters,
            Qui iuris no dos & legum enygmata
ſoluunt,
            
               Foraſomoche as yet ſtyl of this mater,
Certant cuaſidici & adhuc ſub iudicelis
eſt.
            ¶Alſo ye ſhall vnderſtande, that
thuſage of ſome maner is, whan
the tenaunte wyll ſurrender his
lande to thuſe of an other, that he
ſhall take a wande in his hande, &
delyuer it to ye ſteward of the court,
and the ſtewarde ſhall delyuer the
ſame wande in name of seisin to
hym that ſhall take the lande: and
ſuche a tenaunt is called, tenaunte
by the verge. Dyuerſe other cuſtomes

there be of ſurrēdring of copy
hold landes, which here for prolixitie
I wyll p̄termit. And foraſmoche
as tenaūtes by cuſtome of ye
maner, haue by ye courſe of ye cōmon
lawe no free holde, therfore they be
called tenaūtes of baſe tenure,
            ¶Hytherto I haue treated of the
fyrſt membre of diuiſion / that is to
wyte of chatelles / for as I ſayd, al
leeſes for terme of yeres, & at wyll
be accompted in the lawe but as catelles,
and be compriſed vnder that
name / ſaue that they be called catelles
reals / where as kyne, oxen,
horſes, money, plate, corne, & ſuche
lyke be called chatell perſonalles.
Nowe we wyll proſede to thexplanicion
of the ſeconde membre / that
is to ſaye, of free holdes,
         
         
            ¶A diuiſion of free holdes.
            ¶Free holdes or franke tenemētes

a mā may haue in ſūdry wyſes, for
eyther he is ſeaſed for terme of his
owne lyfe, or for terme of an other
mās lyfe. yf for terme of his owne
lyfe, either he haue gotē ſuch eſtate
by way of purchaſe, or els the lawe
hath en
                  ••
               ed him thervnto. I call it
bi purchaſe, whether he cōmeth vnto
it by his owne bargayning & procurement,
or by ye gyft of his frend,
and I cal it by thoperacion and intytlynge
of the lawe, whan a man
maryeth a woman that is an inherures,
& hath iſſue by her, and ſhe
dyeth / nowe ſhal he haue ye landes
duryng his lyfe by the courſe of the
lawe, and ſhal be called tenaunt by
the curteyſye of Englande.
            In lyke wyſe, yf a man be ſcaſed in
fee ſimple, or fee tayle of landes, &
taketh a wyfe, & he dyeth / the law
gyueth vnto the wyse, the thyrde

parte of her huſbandes landes for
terme of her lyfe / and ſhe ſhal be called
tenaunt in dower.
         
         
            ¶Tenaunt for terme
of lyfe.
            ¶Tenaunt for terme of lyfe, is he
that holdeth landes or tenementes
for terme of theyr owne lyfe / or for
terme of an others lyfe. Howe be it
the mooſt frequent maner of ſpeakyng,
is to cal him that hath eſtate
for terme of his owne lyfe, tenaunt
for lyfe / and hym that hath eſtate
for terme of an others life, tenaunt
pour terme dautre vie / that is to
ſaye, tenaunte for terme of an oters
lyfe.
            Ye ſhal note, that he that maketh
the lees is called the leſſour, & he to
whom the lees is made the leſſee / 
ſo he that maketh a feffemēt is called
the feffour / and he to whom the

feffement is made, the feffee.
            Alſo yf tenaunt for terme of lyfe, or
tenaunt pour terme dautre vie do
waſte, the leſſour or he in the reuerſion
ſhall maynteyne an action of
waſte agaynſte hym, and recouer
treble damages.
            Finally ye ſhal vnderſtande that
by an acte of parlyament made in
the. xxvii, yere of Henry the eyght,
it is enacted that no free holde, nor
eſtate of inheritaunce ſhall paſſe ne
take effecte but by dede indented,
ſealed and enrolled in one of the kinges
courtes at Weſtminſter, or els
within the ſame countie where the
lande lye: as by the ſayd acte more
at large appereth.
         
         
            ¶Tenaunte by the
curteſye.
            ¶Tenaunt by the curteſye of Englande,
is he yt hath maryed a wyfe

               
                  •
               herited, and hath had iſſue by her,
& ſhe deed / in this caſe the lawe of
Englande permytteth hym to reteyne
al his wyues landes that ſhe
had, eyther ī fee ſimple, or fee tayle
ſo longe as he lyueth: And this is
by the curteyſye of Englande / for
this thynge is vſed in none other.
region.
            But in this caſe it is requyred
that the chylde ve vitall / that is to
ſay, be borne and brought forth in
to this worlde alyue / and therfore
the cōmon ſayenge hath ben, that
onleſſe the chylde be herde crye, the
father ſhall not be tenaunte by the
curteſye / for thonely proue and argument
of lyfe in an infaunt newe
borne, is the vagite and cryenge.
            Ye ſhall vnderſtande that onleſſe
the huſband be in actual poſſeſſion
of his wyues landes, and ſeaſed of

them in her ryghte, he ſhall not be
tenaunt by curteſye after her deth.
And therfore yf landes deſcende to
a mans wyfe, ſo that ſhe is tenaūt
in the lawe, and to euery mans accion,
yet yf the huſbande haue not
made an actuall entree duryng the
couerture, he ſhall not be tenaunte
by the curteſye, for it ſhall be reputed
his foly and negligence, that he
wolde not entre in her lyfe.
            Otherwyſe it is of aduouſons
rentes, and ſuche other thynges,
whiche forthwith whan they diſcende
be in a man without any entre
or further ceremonye
            Note that if tenaunt by the curteſye
wyl ſuffre or make any waſt
in the landes or tenemētes that he
ſo holdeth / he is punyſhable therfore
by action of waſte.
            Alſo it is to be knowen, that of

thinges that be in ſuſpence, a man
ſhall not be tenaūt by the curteſye / 
& therfore yf a man be the tenaūt in
fee ſimple of certayne lande, & doth
entremary wt a woman yt is ye ſeignoreſſe
or lady of the ſame, & hath
iſſue by her, & ſhe dyeth yet he ſhall
not be tenaunt by ye curteſye of the
lordſhyp or ſeignory, bycauſe hym
ſelfe is tenaunt of the lande, & therfore
the lordeſhyp is ſuſpended for
the tyme / for a man can not be both
lorde and tenaunte of one thynge / 
but yf he had not ben tenaunt of the
lande, he ſhold haue had ye lordſhyp
after the deth of his wyfe by ye curteſye
of Englande very well.
         
         
            ¶Of tenaunt in dower.
            ¶Tenaunte in dower, is ſhe that
hath ben maryed to an huſbande
that was dutynge the couerture
ſeiſed of landes or tenementes in

fee ſimple, or fee tayle, whiche is
now deed & ſhe ſeaſed of the thyrde
parte of her huſbandes ſayd landꝭ
for terme of her lyfe. For by the cō
               mon
lawe of the lande, yf the huſbande
be at any tyme durynge the
couerture ſeaſed laufully, whether
it be by purchaſe or by diſcent, eyther
in fee or in tayle and dye, his
wyfe ought to be indowed by the
courſe of the common lawe, of the
thyrde fote. And in ſome places by
an auncient cuſtome of the moitie / 
yea and though the huſbande were
neuer ſeaſed actually durynge the
couerture: yet if the landes be caſt
vpon hym by the lawe, ſo that the
lawe calleth hym tenaunt to euery
mannes action, it ſuffiſeth for the
woman to demaunde her dower / 
for it were vnreaſonable that the
neglygence of entrynge of the huſbande

ſhold hurte the wyues title.
            Otherwyſe it is as I ſayd before
of tenaunte by the curteſye / for yf
landes deſcend to a woman couert
and the huſbande for ſlouthfulnes
dothe not entre in his wyues lyfe,
he ſhall not be tenaunte by the curteſye
/ for by all lawes the wyfe oweth
obedience & ſubiection to her
huſbande / and therfore ſhe can not
compel him to entre / but whan landes
deſcende to the wyfe, the huſbande
onely haue power to entre
at his pleaſure.
            And ye ſhall vnderſtande, that
onleſſe the wyfe be paſſed thage of
ix. yeres at the tyme of her huſbandes
dethe, ſhe ſhall not be endowed
by the cōmon lawe.
            But it is to be knowen that a woman
may by dyuers wayes preuidice
her ſelfe of her dower: as yf

ſhe be attaynte of treaſon, murdre
or felonye, ſhe gette no dower / notwithſtandynge
ſhe hath obteyned
her pardone.
            Alſo yf after the deth of her huſbande
ſhe taketh a lees for terme of
lyfe of the ſame landes wherof ſhe
is endowable. Moreouer yf ſhe departeth
from her huſband and lyueth
in aduoutry wt another man / 
& not reconciled agayne to her huſbande
without coercion of the eccleſiaſtical
power, ſhe leſeth dower.
She ſhall be alſo barred of dower
yf ſhe wyll witholde from ye heyre
the charters and euydence concernyng
that lande wherof ſhe aſketh
dower: But none other ſaue the
heyre can deteyne her dower for
this cauſe.
            It may not be vnknowen alſo of
what thynges ſhe may demaunde

dower, and of what thynges not.
            Of landꝭ meſſuagies / aduouſons / 
rente charges / rente ſeruyſes / or
ſeignoryes / in groſſe or otherwyſe / 
of villaynes / of cōmons certayne / 
of eſtouers certayne / ſhe is dowable.
But of cōmons, and eſtouers
ſans nombre / alſo of annuities / of
homage / of thinges of pleaſure: as
of ſeruyces of payment of roſes / &
ſemblable ſhe ſhal not be endowed.
            There be yet two other kyndes
of dower / the one is called dowmēt
ex aſſenſu patris, and thother dowment
de la plus beale ꝑtie.
            Dowment ex aſſenſu patris, is
whā the father is ſeaſed of landes
in fee / and his ſone heyre apparant
endoweth his ſpouſe at the church
dore whan he is eſpouſed of parcel
of his fathers landes, with thaſſēt
of his father in wrytyng teſtifieng

the ſame aſſent / yf in this caſe her
huſbande dye, ſhe maye forthwith
entre into the landes ſo aſſigned vnto
her without further appoynting
or proces of lawe, although the father
of her huſbande be yet alyue,
and in actuall poſſeſſion of ye lande.
But yf ſhe thus do, and take her to
this endowment at ye churche dore
ſhe can not haue her dower by the
cōmon lawe of the thyrde parte of
all her huſbandes landes, or any ꝑcell
of them, but yf ſhe wyll refuſe
this aſſignement made vnto her at
the churche dore, and demaunde
dower at the cōmon lawe ſhe maye
very well.
            A man may alſo endowe his wyfe
at the tyme of the ſpouſayles of his
owne landes, which he hath in his
owne poſſeſſion / and that dower is
called dower ad oſtium eccleſie.
            
               
Dowment dela plus beale / that
is to ſaye, dowment of the fayreſt
parte, ſhall be in this caſe.. Whan
a man is ſeaſed of landes wiche
he holdeth of an other mā by knightes
ſeruyce / and of other landes
whiche be of ſocage tenure, & hath
iſſue, whiche is wtin thage of .xiii.
yeres & dye / and the lorde of whom
the lande is holden by knyghtꝭ ſeruyce
entreth in to the lande holden
of him / and the mother of ye chylde
entreth in to the ſocage tenure: as
gardeyne in ſocage / yf in this caſe
the woman wyll brynge a wryt of
dower againſt the lord gardeyne in
cheualrye / he maye plede the ſpeciall
mater, and ſhewe howe ſhe as
gardeyne in ſocage, hath ſo moche
lande / and praye the courte that ſhe
maye be permytted to endowe her
ſelfe of ſo moche lande being in her

owne cuſtodie, as amounteth to y•
thyrde parte of thoſe landes. And
than the iudgement ſhall be, that
the gaerdeyne in chyualry ſhall reteyn
the lande holden of him quyte
from the woman durynge the non
age of ye warde. After which iudgement
ſhe may go and in preſence of
her neighbours endowe her ſelf of
the beſt parte of that whiche is in
her cuſtodye, amountynge to the
thyrde parte of thole / and than is
ſhe called tenaunte in dower de la
plus beale.
         
         
            ¶A diuiſyon of inheritaunces.
            ¶Nyther vnto I haue ſpoken of
free holdes / nowe it remayneth to
treate of inheritaūces / not that inheritaunces
be no free holdes, for
they be free holdes alſo / but the other
eſtates of which I haue here

tofore treated be onely free holdes,
and of no hygher nature / where as
a ſtate of inheritaunce, although it
be a free holde, yet it is not to be called
by that name, ſythe it is a farre
more excellent and greater eſtate,
But ye ſhal vnderſtande that of inheritaunces
ſome be of more amplitude
and excellenct ye than other
ſome be: as yt inheritaunce which
is pure, ſimple, and without limitacion
of what heyres, whiche is
called fee ſīple. But whan I make
a limitacion of what heyres, than
is it called fee tayle / of whiche alſo
be two ſortes, as hereafter more at
large ſhall be reueled. Nowe the
nature of fee ſimple is to be declared
with our accuſtomed compendiouſnes,
         
         
            ¶Fee ſimple.
            ¶Fee ſimple is (as I ſayd) the

mooſt ample and large inheritaūce
that can be excogitate: as yt which
a man hath to hym & to his heyres
ſimply without any further limitaciō
/ whether they be of his owne
body begoten or not, ſo that they be
the nexte of his kynne, and within
the degrees it ſuffiſeth.
            So that tenaunte in fee ſimple is
he that hath landes or tenementes
(whether it be by purchaſe or by
diſcente) to hym and to his heyres
for euer. For if a man wil purchaſe
landes in fee ſimple, he muſt nedes
haue theſe wordes, his heyres in
his purchaſe, for theſe only wordes
to make an eſtate of inheritaunce.
Therfore yf landꝭ be gyuen to a mā
for euer, and no mencyon be made
of his heyres: he hath an eſtate but
for terme of his lyfe, bycauſe theſe
wordes, his heyres do lacke.
            
               
Yet neuertheles, yf a man by his
teſtamente dothe deuyſe landes to
an other in ſuche place where the
cuſtome wyll ſerue ſo to do, though
he maketh no mencyon of heyres,
but ſayth yt he bequetheth to ſuche
a parſone ſuch landes, to haue and
to holde to hym and to his aſſignes
for euermore: here a ſtate of inheritaunce
doth paſſe / for ī teſtamentꝭ
the wyl and intent of ye teſtatour is
to be pondred, and not ye preſcripte
wordes of the lawe.
            Alſo theſe termes in the lawe,
franke mariage, & franke almoyne
do include in them wordes of inherytaunce.
And therfore yf I gyue
landes to a mā with my doughter
in franke maryage without further
addicyon of heyres, this is an
eſtate of inheritaunce, as we ſhall
hereafter declare more copyouſly.

In lykewyſe it is of landes gyuen
to an houſe of religion in pure and
franke almes. Moreouer yf landes
be giuen to a man and to his blodeor
to hym and to his ſeed, he hathin both caſes a ſtate of inheritaūce
in the one a fee taile, and in thother
a fee ſimple. For this worde ſeed,
and blode, and ſuche lyke do imply
wordes of inheritaunce,
            But nowe it is to be ſene who be
ſayd & mannes he yres in the lawe.
Ye ſhall therfore knowe, that my
brother or ſyſter by the halfe blode
that is to wyte, by the fathers ſyde
and not by the mothers / or cōtrary
wyſe by ye mothers and not by the
fathers, ſhal neuer be myne heyre / 
nor none that come of them.
            Neyther my baſtarde can be myne
heyre / nor myne owne naturall father
ne mother / nor grandfather ne

grandmother can be myne heyre.
            For it is a princyple and ground in
the lawe, that inheritaunce maye
linially deſcende, but aſcend it may
not. And therfore yf I haue landes
in fee ſimple and dye without iſſue
of my bodye, my father can not be
myn heire: but my fathers brother
or ſyſter ſhal / and than yf my vncle
or aunte dye ſeaſed without iſſue,
my father ſhall haue the landes as
heyre to myn vncle or to myn aunt,
but heyre to me he can not be. But
it may go from me to mine vncle or
aunte well ynough / for that is not
called a lyniall aſcenſyon, but a collaterall,
            And ye ſhall note that by the cō
               mon
lawe of this realme, my eldeſt
ſone ſhall haue thole inheritaunce / 
and after hym yf he hath no iſſue
the ſeconde ſone and ſo forthe. And

yf I haue no ſones but doughters
than ſhall all the doughters togyther
inherite / yf I haue no iſſue at
all, neyther ſones ne doughters,
than ſhal my eldeſt brother ſuccede
me, but yf I haue no brother, than
my ſyſters yf I haue any / yf not,
my vncle by my fathers ſyde, yf ye
landes be of myne owne purchaſe
And to be ſhort if ther be none aliue
of my fathers ſyde, it ſhal go to my
mothers ſyde / and yf there can be
found no heyre neyther by fathers
ſyde ne yet by mothers, ſo ſhal it reuerte
& eſchere (as they call it) to ye
lorde of whome it was holden / for
euery lande muſte nedes be holden
of ſome lorde, as ſhall be here after
ſhewed. But if landes deſcende vnto
me by my mothers ſyde, than if
I fayle of iſſue, the landes ſhal deſcende
onely to my heyres of my mothers

ſyde, & neuer to myne heyres
of my fathers ſyde: As on the contrary
ſyde, yf I haue landes by diſcent
from my father or his bloode,
they ſhall neuer deſcende to my heyres
by my mothers ſyde.
            Thus ye ſe a greate difference in
this behalfe, bytwene purchaſed
landes and landes which deſcende
from my anuceſtour.
            Yf there be thre ſones, and the
myddell ſone purchaſeth landes, &
dye wtout iſſue, theldeſt ſhall haue
the landes, and not the yongeſt.
            Alſo it is a principle in our lawe,
that none can be myne heyre of landes
that I hold in fee ſimple, onles
he be myne heyre by ye hole bloode / 
for yf a man hath iſſue, two or thre
ſones by ſondry wyues, and theldeſt
purchaſe the landes in fee and
dyeth without iſſue, his halfe brethren

ſhall not haue the lande, but
it ſhall go to his vncle. Lykewyſe
yf a man hath by his fyrſt wyfe a
ſone and a doughter, and by his ſeconde
wyfe an other ſone, and the
ſone by the fyrſte wyfe purchaſeth
landes in fee, and dyeth without
iſſue: the ſyſter ſhall haue the landes
by diſcent, as heyre to her brother,
and not to the yonger brother.
Otherwyſe it is of landes entayled
as ſhall be hereafter ſpecifyed.
            Alſo yf a man be ſeiſed of landes
in fee ſimple, and hath iſſue a ſone
and doughter by one wyfe, & a ſone
by another, and dyeth, and theldeſt
ſone entreth ī to the landes, and after
dyeth without iſſue, the doughter
ſhall haue ye landes and not the
yongeſt ſone, & yet ye yongeſt ſone is
heyre to his father, but he is not ſo
to his brother. But yf in this caſe

theldeſt ſone had not entred after
the deth of his father but had died
before any entre made by hym, thā
ſhall not the ſyſter germayne entre
but the yonger brother as heyre to
his father, bicauſe theldeſt brother
was neuer in actuall poſſeſſyon,
which is requiſyte to that perſone
that claymeth to be heyre collaterally.
But to the lyniall heyres, it
ſuffyſeth that the aunceſtout ſhold
haue ben heyre yf he had lyued / I
meane as thus. A man is ſeaſed of
landes, and hath iſſue, a ſone and
doughter by one wyfe, and a ſone
by another / he dyeth / theldeſt ſone
entreth not, but dieth without iſſue
before he can make any actuall entree
/ his ſyſter ſhall not haue ye landes
as heire to her brother, bicauſe
her brother was neuer actually
poſſeſſed / but ye yonger brother ſhal

haue them as heyre to his father.
Yet yf theldeſt ſone in that caſe had
lefte behynd him iſſue of his body,
whether it had bene ſone or doughter,
this iſſue notwithſtandynge yt
the father was neuer poſſeſſed eyther
actualy or in ye lawe, ſhal haue
the landes, and ſhal conuey his diſcent
from his father, for the ſone or
doughter is linial heyre, where as
the brother, ſyſter, vncle, aunte. &c.
be heyres collateral, and ſo obſerue
a dyuerſitie.
            I call an actuall poſſeſſyon, whan
a man entreth in dede in to landes
to hym deſcended, but a poſſeſſyon
in lawe, is called whan landes be
deſcended to a perſone, and he hath
not yet really and actually entred
into them. For notwithſtandynge
that he is not in actuall poſſeſſyon
yet he is poſſeſſed in the lawe / that

is to ſaye, in the eye and conſyderacyon
of the lawe / foraſmuche as he
is tenaunt to euery mannes action
that wylſue for the ſaid landes / for
els there ſhold inſue an intolerable
inconuenience, as we ſhal more copiouſly
open in an other place.
            Ye ſhall vnderſtande that this
worde inheritaunce is not onely to
be accōmodate and applyed to that
whiche cōmeth by diſcente from a
mannes aunceſtours: but alſo to
euery purchaſe in fee ſimple, or fee
tayle.
         
         
            ¶Fee tryle.
            ¶Ye ſhall vnderſtande, that before
the ſtatute of Weſtminſter ſeconde
there was no ſtate taile, but al was
fee ſimple, eyther purely or condicionally:
as appereth by the p̄tence
of the ſaid ſtatute / but now ſithens
the promulgatynge of that ſtatute

dyuers formes of ſtate tayles haue
ryſen.
            Fee tayle is whan it is lymytted
in the gyfte what heyres, and by
whome engendred ſhall inheryte.
As I gyue landes to a man and to
his heyres and go no further, this
is fee ſimple: but yf I make a lymitacion,
and adde of his body begoten,
now is it fee tayle / that is to
ſaye, a fee or inheritaunce lymtted,
determinate, or aſſigned. So that
yf I gyue landes to a man and to
his heyres, he hath fee ſimple / but
yf I gyue landes to him and to his
heyres of his bodye lawfully begoten,
he hath but a fee tayle / foraſmoche
as I appoynte, lymite, preſcrybe
and determyne the heyres▪
and for lacke of ſuche heyres ye gyft
ſhal be expired and worne out / and
the landes ſhall reuerte agayne to

the gyuer or his heyres.
            But ye muſte obſerue that there
be two kyndes of fee tayle. There
is a generall tayle, and a ſpecyall
tayle. Fee tayle gn̄rall is as where
landes be gyuen to a man & to his
heyres of his body begoten without
expreſſynge by what woman
they are to be begotē. And therfore
Yf a man be tenaūte in the generall
tayle of landes, and taketh a wyfe
and hath iſſue by her, and ſhe dieth
& he taketh an other wyfe, of whō
he hath alſo other iſſue / here either
of theſe iſſues is inheritable to this
lande entayled: But yf I expreſſe
in the gyfte by what woman the
heyres ſhall be procreate, than is it
an eſpecyall tayle: as yf landes be
gyuen to a mā and to the heyres of
his body lawfully begoten by Katherin
his wyfe, this is an eſpeciall

tayle / for ye iſſue of him by an other
woman, ſhall neuer īheryte by force
of the tayle. Lykewyſe it is yf landes
be gyuen to a womā and to the
heyres of her body lawfully begotē
(and ſhe we not by what man) this
is a generall tayle / but yf I adde &
ſaye by ſuche a man her huſbande,
than is it an eſpecyall tayle.
            Alſo yf I gyue landes to a man
and to his wyfe, and to the 
                  〈◊〉
               
of theyr two bodyes lawfully begoten:
this is an eſpecyall tayle / as
well in the huſbande as my wyfe.
            Semblably it is, if a man gyueth
landes to an other man with his
doughter or kynſwoman in franke
maryage, this īplyeth a ſtate tayle
eſpeciall / and as well the man as
the woman hathe eſtate in the ſpeciall
tayle.
            But yf I gyue landes to a man

and to a woman, and to his heyres
that he ſhall begete of her / here the
woman hath eſtate but for terme
of her lyfe, & the huſbande an eſtate
in the eſpeciall tayle. In lykewyſe
it is on the womans behalfe: as yf
I gyue landes to a man and his
wyfe, and to her heyres of the body
of her ſayd huſbande engendred / 
he hath an eſtate but for terme of
lyfe, and ſhe an eſtate in the ſpeciall
tayle. But in bothe caſes, yf I had
ſayd to the heyres and not his or
her heyres, than ſholde eyther of
them haue had an eſtate in the ſpeciall
tayle, bicauſe this worde heyres
is as well referred to thone as
to thother.
            Ye ſhall alſo vnderſtande, that if
landes be gyuen to a man, & to the
heyres males of his body, this is a
ſtate tayle, and in this caſe ye heyre

female ſhall neuer inheryte.
            Finally it is to be noted, that of
landes wiche a man hath in fee
ſimple, the poſſeſſion of the brother
ſhall cauſe the ſyſter germayne to
inherite / and not the brother by the
halfe blode, as here to fore was ſaid
but of landes entayled otherwiſe it
is. Therfore yf a man be ſeiſed of
landes in the generall tayle, & hath
iſſue by his fyrſt wyfe a ſone and a
doughter, and a ſone by an otherwyſe,
and dyeth / and theldeſt ſone
entreth ī to ye landes and dyeth the
ſyſter germayne ſhall not haue the
landes, but ye yonger brother of the
halfe bloode / bycauſe who ſo euer
ſhall inheryte landes in tayle, muſt
clayme them as next and immediate
heyre, not to hym that dieth laſt
ſeaſed of the landes, but to hym vnto
whome the landes were fyrſte

giuen, whiche in the caſe before remembred,
is the ſone and not the
doughter.
            Thus ye ſhall obſerue a greate dyuerſitie
betwene the faſſion of ſucceſſyon
in landes of fee ſimple and
of fee tayle.
         
         
            ¶Tenaunt after poſſibilitie
of iſſue extincte.
            ¶Whan landes or tenementes be
giuen to a man and to his wyfe,
and to the heyres of theyr two bodyes
lawfully begoten, yf in this
caſe eyther of them chaunce to dye
before they haue iſſue betwene thē,
he or ſhe that ouerlyueth is ſtyll tenaunt
in tayle / but without al poſsybylitie
of any iſſue ye can be heyre
to theſe landes entayled / & for this
cauſe he or ſhe thus ouerlyuynge
is called tenaunte after poſſibilitie
of iſſue extinct / for in ſuche a tenaūt

is all poſſibilitie of iſſue that maye
be inherytable to theſe landes by
force of the gifte in tayle vtterly extincte
and quenched / and by his or
her deth the ſtate tayle ſhal expyre,
ceaſe, & be abolyſſhed for euer / and
ſhal reuerte agayne to the gyuer or
donour from whens it came.
            Yet foraſmoche as this tenaunte
after poſſibilytie of iſſue, had ones
an inheritaunce in him, he ſhal not
be punyſſhed by an action of waſte
though he maketh neuer ſo moche
waſt in the landes and tenementꝭ / 
yet in effect he is but a tenaunt for
terme of lyfe.
         
         
            ¶Of perceners.
            ¶Hithervnto I haue made a compendious
declaracyon of eſtates of
all ſortes: but where as I ſayd yt
amonges ſyſters there is no pretogatyue
or preeminence concernyng

thenherityng of theyr aunceſtours
landes, but that they ſhall be al togither
inheritours, and make as it
were but one heyre: it is expedient
to make a further ꝓceſſe in this behalfe,
and to ſhewe howe & in what
maner particion ſhall be made.
            But ye ſhall vnderſtande yt there
be beſyde perceners at the cōmon
lawe, whiche be onely ſyſters / alſo
perceners by cuſtome, which is amonges
brothers contrarye to the
courſe of the cōmon lawe / and this
cuſtome is in Kent, and ī other places
where landes and tenementes
be of the tenure of Gauel kynde.
            Ye ſhall therfore knowe, yt whan
a man is ſeiſed of landes in fee or fetayle,
and hath no iſſue but doughters,
and die / and the doughters do
entre in to the landes thus deſcended
vnto them, nowe they be called

perceners, or coheyres / & by a wryt
called, Dep ꝑticione facienda brought
by one of them agaynſt the others,
they ſhall be conſtrayned by ye lawe
to ſuffre an egall ꝑticion to be made
of the landes bytwene them.
            Nowe particion maye be made
in ſundrye wayes. One waye is
whā they them ſelue do make ꝑticiō
bitwene thē of thoſe heritage
and do agree vnto the ſame, and entre
euery one in to her parte ſo alotted
vnto her.
            An other is, whan by all theyr
agrement and conſent one cōmon
frende do make the particion. In
whiche caſe the eldeſt ſyſter ſhall
haue the firſt election, and after her
the ſeconde ſyſter, and ſo forth / but
if they agree yt the eldeſt ſyſter ſhal
make the particion, & ſhe maketh
it, than ye eldeſt ſhall not chuſe firſt,

but ſhall ſuffre all her other ſiſters
to choſe before, as it is thought.
            There is alſo an other forme of
ꝑticion, whiche is egally to deuyde
the landes in to ſo many partes as
there be coheyres or ꝑceners / and
to wryte euery parte ſo deuyded in
a ſeueral ſcroull of paper, & to put
the ſayd ſcroulles in to a bonet / or
to encloſe them ſeuerally in balles
of waxe / and than th eldeſt ſyſter to
chuſe which ball ſhe wyl, or to put
her hand in to the bonet & to take a
ſcroull, & to holde her to her chaūce
and allotment, & ſo conſequently euery
ſyſter after other.
            And ye ſhall note, that particion
by agrement may as well be made
by nude and bare wordes without
wrytynge as by wrytynge.
            That yf any of ye perceners wyl
not ſuffre any particion to be made

than may thother that wolde haue
peaticyon, purchaſe a wryt called
De particione facienda agaynſt thē
that refuſe particion, to compel the
ſame to ſuffre particion to be made
accordyngly / and thā by the iudgemēt
of the courte the ſheryfe by the
ſerement of twelue men ſhal make
particion bytwene them, and ſhall
aſſigne to eche ſiſter her porcion, as
he ſhall thynke good, wtout gyuyng
any election to theldeſt.
            And yf two maners or meeſes
deſcend to two ſyſters, and the maners
be not of egal value, than may
ſhe to whom ye leſſe maner is allotted
haue aſſigned vnto her a rente
proporcyonably out of the others
maner.
            Finally ye ſhal vnderſtande, that
yf a man be ſeaſed of landes in fee
ſimple, and hath iſſue two doughters

/ and gyueth with one of his
doughters to an other men ye third
or fourth parte of his land ī franke
maryage, and dyeth / if in this caſe
the doughter that is in this wyſe
auaunced wyll haue her porcion of
her fathers heritage, ſhe muſt put
her lande gyuen vnto her ī franke
mariage in hochepot newe againe.
I meane ſhe muſte be contented to
ſuffre her ſayd landes to be cōmixt
and mēgled with the other landes
of whiche her father dyed ſeaſed in
fee, ſo that an equall diuiſion maye
be made of the hole / or elles ſhe ſhal
haue no ꝑte of thoſe landꝭ, of whiche
her father dyed ſeaſed: but yf her
father had made vnto her but a cō
               mon
gyft in tayle, or a feffement in
fee, ſhe ſhold not nede to put her landes
in hochepot, but maye retayne
them ſtyll, and alſo haue as good a

ꝑte of the reſt of ye landes of whych
her father dyed ſeaſed, as her other
ſiſter or ſiſters. For a gyfte ī franke
maryage, is acompted the mooſte
free or mooſt liberall gyfte that can
be, and that whiche the law iudggeth
to be onelye for the aduaūcement
and beſtowyng of the doughter,
where as feffementꝭ in fee and
alſo cōmon gyftes in tayle be acuſtomably
for other cauſes, and for
the aduauntage rather of the gyuour,
or ſeffour.
         
         
            ¶Of condicions.
            ¶Foraſmoche as euery eſtate is
eyther pure, or condcional / it were
not amyſſe ſomwhat to make a declaracyon
of the nature and efficacye
of condicions. Wherefore ye ſhal
vnderſtand that of cōdicions, ſome
be actuall condicions, called condicions
in dede / and other ſome be cō
               dicyons

in lawe.
            Condicyons in dede be ſuche as
by annexed by expreſſe wordes to ye
feffement lees or graunt, eyther in
wrytynge or without: as yf I infeffe
a man in certayne landes reſeruinge
to me and to myne heyres
ſo moche rent yerely to be payde at
ſuche a feeſt / and for defaute of payment,
that it ſhall be lawfull for me
to reentre this is a feffement vpon
condicyon of payment. For the not
payment of the rente ſhall diſſolue
the feffement. Semblably it is of
gyftes in tayle leeſes. &c.
            But yf the condicion be, that for defaulte
of paiment of the rent, it ſhal
be lawful for the feffour to entre agayne
in to the landes, and to holde
them tyl he be ſatiſfyed of the rent / 
this condicyon not performed doth
not diſſolue the feffement, but oneli

gyueth to the feffour an authoritie
to reteine the landes (as it were by
way of diſtreſſe) tyl he hath leuyed
the arreragyes of the rent.
            And ye ſhall obſerue, that condicyons
be ſomtyme made to be performed
on the feffees behalfe, and
ſomtyme on the feffours behalfe.
On the feffees behalfe, as whan I
infeffe you of landes vpon condiciō
that ye ſhall do ſuche an acte, as to
pay vnto me or to myn heyres ſuch
annuall rent.
            On the feffours behalfe, as whā
I make a feſſement vnto you vpon
condicion, that yf I pay or cauſe to
be payde vnto you before ſuche a
day, ſuche a ſomme of money, than
it ſhall be lawfull for me to entre agayne
and reteyn my landes in my
former eſtate. In this caſe ye that
be the feffee, are called tenaunte in

morgage, which is as moche to ſay
as a deed gage / and it ſemeth that
the cauſe why it is ſo called, is foraſmoche
as it is doubtful whether
the feffour wyll pay at the day preſcrybed
ſuche ſomme of money for
the redemptiō of his landes or no / 
for yf he do not, his title or intereſſe
in the landes thus gaged is vtterly
extincte without all hope of reuyuynge.
            Ye ſhall note that yf the morgageour
dyeth before the daye of payment,
his heire may redeme ye land
very wel euen as wel as his aūceſtour
yt morgaged the lande myght
haue done, althoughe there be no
mencion made of heyres in ye wrytynge.
            And yf whan the money is lawfully
by ye morgageour or his heire
profered, and the feffee refuſeth to

receyue the ſame, the feffour or his
heyre may entre, and than hath the
feffee no remedye for his monye at
the cōmon lawe.
            Ye ſhall vnderſtande alſo yt ſome
cōdicyons be vtterly voyde in the
lawe, and of none effycacye: as if a
feffement be made of landes in fee
vpon condicion that the feffee ſhall
not aliene this ſame to none other
this condicion I ſaye is voyde, bycauſe
the feffee is reſtrayned of his
hole power that the lawe giueth in
ſuche caſe vnto hym, and whiche
power and libertye, is in maner included
in euery feffemente: yet I
may abbrydge hym of parte of his
power, as to condycyon with hym
that he ſhal not aliene the landes to
ſuche a perſonne or ſuche. But of
gyftes in tayle other wyſe it is, for
yf I gyue landes to a man and to

the heyres of his body lawfully begoten
vpon cōdicion that he nor his
heyres ſhal aliene ye landes to none
other ꝑſone / this condicion is good
and effectuall in the lawe / and if he
or his heyres contrary to che condicion
do aliene them, than ye donour
or his heyres maye very well entre
and reteyne the landes for euer / bicauſe
this condicyon dothe ſtande
with the ſtatute of Weſtm̄ ſeconde
whiche prohybiteth ſuche alienacions
to be made.
            Hyther vnto I haue ſpoken of cō
               dicions
in dede, nowe wyl I ſhewe
what be condicions in lawe that be
annexed to any eſtates.
            Knowe ye therfore, that yf thoffyce
of a ꝑker, or ſtewarde, or ſuche
lyke offyce, be graūted to a man for
terme of his lyfe, thoughe there be
no condicion at al mencioned in the

graunt, yet the lawe ſpeketh a condicion
in this caſe, whiche is that
yf the partye to whom ſuche offyce
is gyuen ſhal not execute al poyntꝭ
apperteynynge vnto his offyce accordyngly,
it ſhall be lawfull for the
grauntour to entre and diſcharge
hym of his offyce / & this condicion
is called a condicion in lawe.
         
         
            ¶Of lyuery of ſeaſon, and
of atturnement.
            ¶In all feffementꝭ, gyftꝭ in tayle,
leeſes for terme of lyfe, or for terme
of anothers lyfe of landes or tenementes,
there can be no alteracion
or tranſmutacion of poſſeſſion, onleſſe
there be a certayne ceremonye
of lawe adhibited and ſolempniſed
in the preſence and ſyght of neyghbours
or others, whiche ceremony
is called lyuery of ſeaſon.
            And ye ſhall vnderſtande, yt this

ceremonye of lyuerye of ſeaſon is
done, whan the feffour, donour, leſſour
or theyr deputy come with the
neighbours ſolemplye to ye landes
or tenementes / & there put ye feffee
donee or leſſee in poſſeſſion of ye ſaid
landes or tenementꝭ by deliueryng
vnto hym a clod of erth, or the ring
of the dore, or ſome other thynge in
ye name of ſeaſon / and for this ſelfe
cauſe this ceremony of lawe is called
lyuery of ſeaſon, that is to wyt
a tradicion or gyuynge of ſeaſon.
            But this ceremony is not required
in leeſes for terme of yeres, or
in leeſes at wyl, in as moche as the
leſſour in ſuche caſe remaineth ſtyl
ſeaſed / and the leſſee hath only the
poſſeſſyon without the ſeaſon / and
therfore the termes of the lawe be,
that ſuche a mā is poſſeſſed / where
as in feffementes / gyftes in tayle,

and leeſes for lyfe, he is called ſeaſed.
            Wherfore yf a feffement or lees
for lyfe be made of landes or tenementes,
and before liuery of ſeaſon
be made the feffour dyeth, the heyr
of the feffour ſhall haue the landes
by the regour of the lawe, notwithſtandynge
that ye feffee hath payed
to the feffour the pryce of the land,
and although the feffee be in poſſeſſyon.
But other wyſe it is of alees
for terme of yeres.
            A lyke ceremonye is vſed whan
rent charges, whan rent ſeruyees,
and ſuche other thynges as paſſe
bygraunt, be graunted / for it is no
ful and perfyte graunt tyl it be conſignyte
as it were with the ceremony
of atturnement.
            This atturnement is nothynge
elles, but whan the tenaunt of the

lande of whiche the reuerſyon is
graunted, or out of which a rent is
graunted, do make ſome euydent
ſignification and token that he accepteth
the perſone to whome the
graunte is made to be in the ſame
reſpecte vnto hym that the grauntour
was: As if the tenaunt of the
lande after he haue herd of ye graūt
cōmeth to the grauntee / that is to
wyte, to the perſone to whome the
graunt was made, and ſay in this
wyſe, or in lyke effecte.
            I agree me to the graunt made
vnto you by ſuche a man / or I am
well apayde and contented of the
graūt that ſuche a man hath made
vnto you. But the mooſt vſual and
frequent forme of atturnement is
to ſay: Syr I atturne vnto you by
force of ye ſayd graunt, or I become
your tenaūt / or to delyuer vnto the

graūtee a peny or halfpeny by way
of atturnement.
            Yf a man maketh fyrſt one graūt
to one perſone, and after another to
an other perſone / that graunt ſhall
ſtande to whiche the tenaunt wyll
atturne, although it be the latter.
            And ye ſhall note, that yf a man
be ſeaſed of a maner (whiche is ꝑcell
in demene, and ꝑcell in ſeruyce)
and doth altene the ſame maner to
an other, onleſſe the tenauntes of ye
maner do atturne, the ſeruices ſhal
not paſſe, onely tenauntes at wyll
excepted, for it nedeth not to cauſe
them to atturne.
            Note that there is a great difference
bytwene gyuynge a penye in
name of ſeaſon, and gyuynge it by
waye of atturnement, for whan it
is gyuen of ye tenaunt to the grauntee
in name of ſeaſon, it dothe not

onely implye an atturnement, but
alſo it gyueth hym ſuche a ſeaſon,
that yf the rente afterwarde be behynde
and not payde, he may nowe
vpon the ſeaſon of the peny, after a
lawfull diſtres and reſcus made,
brynge an aſſyſe of nouel diſſeaſon,
where as yf it were gyuen only by
waye of atturnement, he could not
brynge the aſſyse, but his wryt of
reſcus onely.
            Alſo ye ſhall vnderſtande, that
where as landes be deuiſable by ye
cuſtome of any auncient boroughe
or city, yf there be reuerſion of any
landes be by teſtamente bequethed
to a man ī fee, and the diuyſour dyeth
/ the deuiſee, that is to wyte, he
to whome the deuyſe was made
hath forth with the reuerſion ī hym
without further ceremonye of atturnement.
Lykewyſe it is if a mā

of ſeruyce that the tenaunte oweth
to his lorde, is called knyghtes ſeruyce.
         
         
            ¶Knyghtes ſeruyce.
            ¶Knyghtes ſeruyce is homage,
fealtie & eſcuage / and who ſo euer
holdeth his landes by knyghtꝭ ſeruyce,
is bounde by the lawe to do
his lorde homage and fealtie, and
to paye eſcuage whan it ſhal be aſſeſed
by parliament.
            Homage is the mooſte reuerent
ſeruyce yt is / for whan the tenaunt
ſhall do ſytte, & the tenaunt ſhal knele
before hym vpon bothe knees / and
ſhal holde his handes bit wene his
lordes handes, & ſaye in this wiſe.
I become your man from this day,
forth warde of lyfe and of membre
and of terrene honour, and to you
ſhal be faythfull and loyall, & fayth

to you ſhall beare for yt landes that
I clayme to holde of you: ſauynge
the fayth that I beare vnto our ſoueraigne
lorde the kynge / and thā
the lorde ſo ſyttyng ſhal kyſſe hym.
But if an abbot or pryour, or any other
perſone of religion ſhall do homage
to his lorde, he ſhall not ſaye:
I becom your mā, bicauſe he hath
profeſſed hym ſelfe to be the onely
man of god: but ſhall ſaye, I do to
you homage, & ſhal be to you faythfull
and true, and fayth to you ſhall
beare for the tenementes yt I holde
of you: ſauynge the fayth whiche
I do owe to our ſoueraygne lorde
the kynge.
            Ye ſhall note alſo, that whan a
woman ſole bothe homage to her
lorde, ſhe ſhall not ſaye: I become
your woman for it is not conuentent
that a woman ſhold be the woman

or any other than of her huſbande
that ſhe ſhall marye / but ſhe
ſhall ſaye euen as the relygyous
perſone ſaythe: I do vnto you homage.
&c.
            
            That yf perchaunce a man holdeth
ſundry landes and tenemētes
of ſundry lordes, and euery of them
by knyghtes ſeruyce, than ī thende
of his homage, he ſhall ſay ſauynge
the faythe that I owe to our ſoueraigne
lord the kynge, and to myne
other lordes.
            And it is to be knowen, that none
is bounde to do homage to ye lorde,
onles it be ſuche a tenaunt as hath
in the tenauncy an eſtate of fee ſimple,
or fee tayle, eyther ī his owne
ryght, or in the ryght of another.
            For yf a woman haue landes or
tenementꝭ in fee ſimple or fee tayle,
whiche ſhe holdeth of her lorde by

knyghtes ſeruyce / and taketh an
huſband and haue iſſue / ī this caſe
the huſbande ī the life of his wyfe
ſhall do ye homage, bycauſe he hath
a title to haue the landes bi the curteſye
yf he ouerlyueth her / and alſo
he holdeth them now in his wyfes
ryght. yet before iſſue had bitwene
them, the homage ſhall be made in
theyr bothe names. But yf the woman
dieth before homage made by
her huſbande in her lyfe, & the huſbande
kepeth ſtyll the landes as tenaunt
by the curteſye / now he ſhal
not do homage to his lorde bycauſe
he hath now an eſtate but for terme
of lyfe.
            Fealtie is as moche to ſaye as a
fidelitie or faythfulnes, in doynge
wherof the tenaunt ſhall holde his
hande vpon a boke, and ſay thus:
Heare you this my lorde: I to you

ſhall be faythfull and true, & fayth
to you ſhal beare for the landes and
tenementes whyche I clayme to
holde of you / and duely ſhal do you
the cuſtomes and ſeruices whiche
I owe to do you at the termes aſſigned,
as me helpeth god and his
ſayntes. And than he ſhal kyſſe the
boke / but he ſhall not knele as he
that dothe homage.
            And ye ſhal obſerue that homage
can not be done but to the lord hym
ſelfe, where as the ſtewarde of the
lordes courte or the baily may take
fealtie for the lorde. Alſo tenaunte
for terme of lyfe ſhall do fealtie, but
homage (as is ſayd) he cannot do.
            Now as concernyng eſcuage ye
ſhal vnderſtande, that he yt holdeth
his landes by eſcuage, whan the
kynge maketh a vyage royall in to
Scotlande for the ſubduyng of the

Scottes, is bounde to be with the
kynge by the ſpace of .xl. dayes wel
& conueniently arayed for ye warre.
And he that holdeth his lande but
by the moite of fee of knyghtes ſeruyce,
is bounde by the force of his
tenure to be with the kynge by the
ſpace of .xx. dayes / and ſo proporcionably
accordynge to the rate and
quantitie of his tenure.
            But now to the purpoſe, after
this viage royall in to Scotlande
(in whiche the kynge goeth in perſone)
and after the retyre in to Englande
agayn a parliament is wont
to be ſōmoned, in which ſhal be aſſeiſed
what euery ꝑſone that helde
his lande by homage and went not
with the kynge, neyther by hym
ſelfe, nor by his deputye, ſhall paye
to his lord in ſatiſfaction of his, not
ſeruyng / & accordynge to the taxacion

herof, euery tenaunt ſhall pay
to his immediate lorde (whether it
be the kynge or other) after the rate
of his tenure / yf he holdeth by an
hoole fee, the hoole eſcuage / yf by a
moitie the halfe / yf be the fourthe
parte of a fee, the fourth parte. &c.
and this money thus aſſeyſed, is
called eſcuage / for whiche the lorde
to whom it is due, maye very well
diſtreyne.
            But here it is to be noted, yt ſome
tenauntes by cuſtome are bounde
to pay but the moite, or the thyrde
parte of that whiche ſhall be aſſeiſed
by acte of parliament.
            Yea, & the cuſtome is ī ſome place
that to what ſōme ſo euer eſcuage
is aſſeiſed, the tenauntꝭ ſhal pay neuer
but ſuch acerteyne ſōme of money:
& this eſuage is called eſcuage
certayne, where as thother is called

eſcuage vncertayne,
            Finally ye ſhal vnderſtand, that
eſcuage vncertayne is alwayes a
knyghtꝭ ſeruice, and draweth vnto
it warde maryage and reliefe / but
eſcuage certeyn is no knyghtes ſeruyce,
but of the tenure of ſocage, as
ſhall be herafter ſhewed.
         
         
            ¶Of warde maryage
and reliefe.
            ¶Euery knyghtes ſeruyce draweth
vnto it warde maryage and relife
/ wherfore it is expedient ſomewhat
to entreate of them.
            Ye ſhall therfore be admoniſſhed
that whan the tenaūt by knightes
ſeruyce dyeih, his heyre male beyng
within thage of .xxi. yeres, the
lorde ſhall haue the warde, that is
to ſaye, the cuſtodye or kepynge of
the landes ſo holden of him to his
owne vſe and profyte, tyl the heyre

cōmeth to the full age of .xxi. yeres▪
For the lawe preſumeth that tyl he
cōmeth to this age he is not able to
do ſuche ſeruice as is of this tenure
requyred. Furthermore yf ſuche
heyre be vnmaryed at the tyme of
the deth of the tenaunt, than ye lorde
ſhall haue alſo the warde and the
maryage of hym.
            But yf tenaunt by knyghtes ſeruyce
dyeth, his heyre female beyng
of thage of .xiiij. yeres or aboue, thē
the lorde ſhall not haue the warde,
neyther of the lande ne yet of the bodye
of ſuche an heyre / and ye reaſon
is becauſe a woman of yt age maye
haue ā huſhande able to do knyghtꝭ
ſeruyce / that is to ſaye, to wayte
vpon the kynges perſone whan he
auaunceyth in to Scotlande with
his armye royall.
            But yf ſuche an heyre female be

within thage of .xiiij. yeres and not
maryed at the tyme of the dethe of
her aunceſtour, than the lorde ſhall
haue the warde of the lande holden
of hym, tyll ſuche heyre female cō
               meth
to ye age of .xvj. yeres. by force
of an acte of ꝑliament in the ſtatute
of Weſtm̄, the fyrſt.
            Note that there is a great diuerſite
in the lawe, bitwene thages of
females & of males / for the female
hathe thus many ages apoynted
by the lawe. Fyrſt, at .vij. yeres of
age, the lorde her father maye diſtreyne
his tenauntes for ayde to
mary her. Seconde, at .ix. yeres of
age, ſhe is dowable. Thyrdly, at
xij. yeres ſhe is able to aſſent to matrimonye.
Fourthly, at .xiiij. yeres
ſhe is able to haue her lande, & ſhall
be out of warde if ſhe be of this age
at the deth of her aunceſtour.
            
               
Fyfthly, at .xvj. yeres ſhe ſhall be
out of warde, thoughe at the dethe
of her aunceſtour ſhe was within
thage of .xiiij. yeres. Sixthly, at
xxi. yeres ſhe is able to make alienacions
of her landes or tenementes.
Where as the man hath but
two ages / the one at .xiiij. yeres to
haue his lande holden ī ſocage, and
to aſſent to matrimonye / the other
at .xxi. to make alienacions.
            Ye ſhall vnderſtande that by the
ſtatute of Merton, the ſixth chapitre,
it is enacted that yf in caſe the
lordes do mary theyr warde to vylaynes
or others, wheare is a diſpargement
/ yf ſuche heyre ſo maried
be within thage of: xiiij. yeres
or of ſuche age that the ſayd warde
can not conſente to the maryage:
Than yf the frendes of this heyre
complayne or fele them ſelues greued

with this vnmete maryage, ye
next of kyn to the heire vnto whom
the heritage can not deſcende may
entre in to the landes, and put out
the gardeyne in cheualrye / & yf the
next kyndeſman wyll not thus do,
another kyndeſman of the infante
maye do it, and ſhall take the iſſues
and profites to the vſe of the heyre,
and ſhall yelde accomptes therof
vnto hym whan he cōmeth to his
full age.
            But there be dyuers other diſpargementes
which be not expreſſed
in the ſaid eſtatute, as if ye heyre
beynge within age of conſente and
in warde be maryed to a creple: as
to one that hath but one fote or one
hande, or that is a defforme creature,
or hauynge any horryble diſeaſe
or contynuall infyrmitye. All
theſe and ſuche lyke be diſpargementes.

But here ye ſhall vnderſtande
that it ſhall be ſayd no diſpargemente
onleſſe the heyre be ſo
maryed, beynge within the age of
diſcrecyon / that is to ſaye, of .xiiij.
yeres. For yf he be of that age or aboue
and conſenteth to ſuche maryage,
it is no diſpargement / neyther
ſhall the lorde for ſuche maryage
loſe his warde, bycauſe it ſhall
be reputed to the folye of the heyre
beynge of age of diſcrecyon to conſent
to ſuche maryage.
            Now yf the gardeyn offre to the
heyre beinge in his warde a conuenient
maryage without diſpargement,
and the heyre refuſeth it as
he may very wel do, than the lorde
ſhal haue the value of the mariage
of ſuche heyre whan he cōmeth to
his full age. But yf he mary hym
ſelfe beynge in warde agaynſt the

wyll of his gardeyne, than he ſhall
paye ye double value by force of the
eſtatute of Merton before remembred.
            And ye ſhall note that yf landes
holden by knyghts ſeruice deſcende
to an infante from his mother, or
from any of his aūceſtours, his father
beynge eytalyue, in this caſe
the lord ſhal not haue the maryage
of this heyre / for duryng the lyfe
of ye father, the ſone ſhal be in ward
to no man.
            Finally, it is to be knowen, that
he whiche is gardeyne in cheualry
in ryght may after he hath ſeaſed
the warde graunt the ſame, yet her
by dede or without dede to another
and than he to whom ſuche graunt
is made is called gerdeyn in fayte.
            Nowe as touchynge reliefe, ye
ſhall knowe that yf a man holdeth

his lande by knyghtes ſeruyce and
dyeth, his heyre beynge of full age
(the full age of the male is .xxj. yeres,
of the female .xiiij.) than y• lord
of whome the lande is holden ſhall
haue of the heyre reliefe.
            Reliefe of a hole knyghtes fee is
C.s̄. and of halfe a knyghtes fee
fyftye. s̄. &c.
            Alſo a man may holde landes of
a lorde by two knyghtes fees, and
than the heyre beynge of ful age at
the deth of his aūceſtour, ſhall pay
to his lorde for reliefe .xl. li.
         
         
            ¶Seruyce of caſtell
garde.
            ¶Ye ſhal vnderſtande that a man
may hold by knyghtes ſeruyce and
yet not holde by eſcuage, nor ſhall
paye no eſcuage / for he maye holde
by caſtell garde, that is to ſaye, by
ſeruyce to kepe a towre of his lordꝭ

caſtell or ſome other place, vpon a
reaſonable warnynge, whan his
lorde heareth that enemyes wyll
come or be come in to Englande.
This ſeruice is alſo knyghtes ſeruyce,
and draweth to it warde maryage
and reliefe as other knyghtes
ſeruyce dothe.
         
         
            ¶Of graunde ſergeauntye.
            ¶There is alſo an other kynde of
knyghtes ſeruice, called graunde
ſergeaunty, which is where a mā
holdeth his landes or tenementꝭ of
the kynge, by ſuche ſeruyce as he
oweth in proper perſone to do: as
to beare ye banet of our ſoueraygne
lorde the kynge, or his ſpere / or to
conduct his hoſte / or to be his marſhall / 
or to be the ſewar, caruer,
or butler, at the feeſt of the coronacion
/ or to be one of ye chābrelaynes

of the receypte of his eſchequere, or
to do ſemblable ſeruyces to ye kynge
in proper perſone, ſuche maner of
ſeruyce I ſay, is called graund ſergeauntye
/ and the cauſe why it is
ſo called, is bycauſe it is the mooſt
honorable and mooſt worthye ſeruyce
that is / for he that holdeth by
eſcuage is not appointed by his tenure
to do any other more ſpecyall
ſeruice thā an other is bounde that
holdeth by eſcuage / but he that holdeth
by graunde ſergeauntye, is
bounde to do ſome ſpeciall ſeruyce
to the kynge.
            Alſo yf he that holdeth of ye kynge
by graunde ſergeauntye dyeth his
heyre beynge of full age, than the
heyre ſhall pay to the kynge for reliefe,
not onely. C.s̄. as he that holdeth
by eſcuage ſhall do, but ye clere
annuall value of thoſe landes and

tenementes whiche he holdeth of
the kynge by graund ſergeanty.
            Furthermore ye ſhall note that
in the marches of Scotlande, ſome
holde of the kynge by cornage / that
is to ſaye, by blowynge of an horne
to warne the men of the countrey
whan they here that the Scottes
or theyr enimyes be commynge, or
be alredye entred in to Englande,
which ſeruyce is alſo graunde ſergeauntye.
            Graunde ſergaunty is as moche
to ſaye in latyn as magnum ſeruiciū
/ that is to ſaye, a great or hygh
ſeruyce, lyke as petite ſergeauntye
is called peruū ſeruitium / that is
to ſaye, a lytle ſeruyce.
            But to reuert agayne to ye thing.
yf any tenaunt holdeth of any other
lord than of the kynge by ſuche ſeruyce
of cornage, than it is no graūd

ſergeauntye, but yet it is knightes
ſeruyce, and draweth to it warde
maryage and reliefe / for none can
holde by graunde ſergeauntye but
of the kynge.
            Finally ye ſhal vnderſtande, that
all they whiche holde of the kynge
by this ſeruyce called graunde ſergeauntye
do holde of the kynge by
knyghtese ſeruyce, and the kynge
ſhal haue of them warde mariage
and reliefe, but eſcuage he ſhall not
haue of them, oneleſſe they hold by
eſcuage of hym by expreſſe wordꝭ.
         
         
            ¶Petite ſergeaunty.
            ¶Tenaunt by petite ſergeauntye
is he that holdeth his lande immediatly
of our ſoueraygne lorde the
kynge by this ſeruyce, to pay to the
kynge yerely a bowe, or a ſpere, a
dagger, a ſwerde, a payre of gauntlettes,

a payre of ſpores of golde, &
ſhafte or ſuch other ſmal thingꝭ apꝑteynyng
to ye warre / and this ſeruyce
is in effect but ſocage, bycauſe
that ſuche a tenaunt is not bounde
by his tenure to go ne do any thing
in his owne propre ꝑſone touching
the warre, but onely to rendre and
paye yerely certeyn thynges to the
kynge, as a man oughte to paye a
rente / wherfore this ſeruyce of petite
ſergeaunty is no knyghtes ſeruyce
but yet ye ſhall note, yt a man
can not holde neyther by petite ſergeauntye
neyther by graunde ſergeaunty,
but of the kynge onely.
         
         
            ¶Homage aunceſtrell.
            ¶Tenaunt by homage aunceſtrel
is he whiche holdeth his lande of
his lorde by homage, and bothe he
and his aunceſtours whoſe heyre

he is haue holden the ſame land of
the ſayd lorde & of his aunceſtours
tyme out of minde by homage / and
haue done vnto them homage, and
this is called homage aunceſtrell,
by reaſon of the longe continuaūce
whiche hath ben by title of preſcription
as well concernynge the tenauncy
in the blode of the tenaunt,
as concernynge the ſegnorye in the
blode of the lorde. And this ſeruyce
of homage aunceſtrell draweth vnto
it warrantye (that is to ſaye) yf
the lorde which is now in lyfe hath
ones receyued ye homage of his tenaūt,
he ought to warrant ye ſame
tenaunt, what tyme ſo euer he ſhal

            Moreouer ſuche ſeruyce of homage
aunceſtrell draweth to it acquitale

(y• is to ſaye) the lord ought
to acquite the tenure agaynſt all other
lordes that can demaunde any

            Wherfore yf in this caſe the tenaunt

how he and his auceſtours (whoſe
heyre he is) haue holden his lande
of hym and of his aūceſtours tyme
out of mynde / the lord yf he can not
denye this, and yf he haue receiued
the homage of ſuche a tenaunte, is
bounde by ye lawe to warrant hym

                diſclayme
in the ſegnorye / and ſo put
out the tenaunt of his warrantye.
Where ye ſhall note, that in euery
caſe that the lorde diſclayme in his
ſegnory in courte of recorde, his ſegnory
is extincte, and the tenaunte
ſhall holde from thenſforthe of the
nexte lorde to hym that thus diſclaymed.
            Thus ye perceyue that homage
aunceſtrell is not but where as is
alonge continuaūce, as well in the
bloode of the tenaunt in reſpecte of

his tenauncye, as of the lorde in reſpecte
of his ſegnorye. Wherfore if
the tenaūt doth ones aliene his landes
to an other, althoughe he purchaſeth
ye ſame agayne, yet he ſhall
not hold any lenger by homage aū
               ceſtrell
by cauſe of this diſcontinuaunce,
but ſhall holde it now by the
vſuall homage.
         
         
            ¶Of ſocage.
            ¶Socage is properly where the
tenaunt is boūde to come with his
ſoke (that is to ſaye) wt his plough
to earye and ſowe percell of the demene
landes of his lorde, which ſeruyce
in auncyente tyme was very
frequent / but nowe by the mutuall
conſent bothe of the lorde and of the
tenaunt, it is conuerted for ye mooſt
parte in to a yerely rente. How be it
the name of ſocage abydeth ſtyll.
Wherfore nowe all yt is not knyghtes

ſeruyce is called by the name of
of ſocage.
            So that yf a man holdeth by fealtye
onely, or by fealtye & homage
for al maner of ſeruice, it is but ſocage
tenure / for homage alone maketh
not knyghtes ſeruyce / yea yf
a man holdeth by eſcuage certayne
as I haue ſayd here tofore he holdeth
in effecte but by ſocage.
            Now where a man holdeth his
landes by ſocage & dyeth, his heire
beynge within thage of .xiiij. yeres
the lorde ſhall not haue the warde,
but the nexte of kynne to the heyre
to whome the heritage can not deſcende
ſhall haue the wardeſhyp as
wel of the lande as of the heyre, tyll
the heyre come to the age of .xiiij.
yeres / and ſuche gardeine is called
gardeyn in ſocage / and ſhall rendre
accomptes to the heyre for ye iſſues

and ꝓfites that he hath receiued of
the landes duryng ſuche tyme, his
reſonable coſtes and expences deducted,
ſo that he ſhall not haue the
wardſhyp to his owne vſe & profite
as gardeyne in cheualry hath.
            Finally ye ſhal vnderſtande that
whan tenaunt in ſocage dyeth the
lord ſhal haue reliefe / that is to ſay,
the value of the rent that is yerely
due vnto hym of the tenauncye beſyde
the yerelye rent: ſo that in effecte
after the dethe of his tenaunte
he ſhal haue of the heyre .ij. rentes,
ſaue that for the relife / he maye diſtrayne
forthwith, but for thaccuſtomed
rente he can not diſtrayne
tyll the vſuall daye of payment be
come.
         
         
            ¶Franke almoyne.
            ¶Tenaunt in franke almoyne, is
where an abbot or pryour or any other

man of religyon, or eccleſiaſticall
perſone holdeth of his lorde in
pure and perpetual almes / & ſuche
tenure began fyrſte in olde tyme in
this maner. Whan a man was
ſeaſed in olde tyme of certayne landes
or tenementes in his demene,
as of fee, and of the ſame tenementes
enfeoffed an about & his couent
or a pryour and his couente, or any
other perſone eccleſiaſtycall: as a
deane of a colege / mayſter of an hoſpitall / 
or ſuche lyke / to haue and to
holde the ſame landes to them and
to their ſucceſſours for euer in pure
and perpetuall almes, or in franke
almes, in theſe two caſes the tenementes
ſholde be holden in franke
almoyne.
            By force of whiche tenure they
that holde in franke almoyne after
this ſorte be bounde of ryght before

god to make oriſons, prayers to celebrate
maſſes and other diuine ſeruices
for the ſoules of theyr graunters
and feffars / and for the ſoules
of theyr heyres which be deed / and
for the proſperous eſtate of theyr
heyres that be nowe alyue. And bicauſe
of ryght they be boūde to this
diuyne ſeruyce, they be diſcharged
by the lawe to do any other ꝓphane
or corporall ſeruyce: as fealtye or
ſuche other lyke.
            But neuertheles yf ſuch as hold
theyr tenementꝭ in franke almoyne
do omit theſe diuine ſeruicꝭ whervnto
they be bounde before god, the
lorde can not diſtrayne them, ne yet
compel them by any other meanes
by the courſe of lawe / but the onely
remedy is to complayne of them to
theyr ordinary, who of right ought
to compell ſuche eccleſiaſticall perſonnes

to do the diuyne ſeruyce due
as aforeſayd.
            But here ye ſhall note that yf an
abbotte, or pryour, or parſone of a
churche or ſuche lyke holdeth of his
lorde by certeyne diuyne ſeruyce to
be done, as to ſyng maſſe euery frydaye
in the weke / or placebo and dirige / 
or to fynde a preeſte to ſynge
maſſe or to diſtribute in almes .C.
pence to a hōdred men at ſuch day.
In all theſe caſes yf ſuche diuyne
ſeruyce be vndone, the lorde maye
very well diſtrayne, bicauſe the ſeruyce
is put in certayntye.
            Now I ſayd that yf in olde tyme
a man dyd infeoffe ſuche ſpirituall
ꝑſone after ſuch ſorte, he ſhold hold
his lande in franke almoyne / but
nowe at this daye it is otherwyſe / 
for by the reaſon of a ſtatute called,
Quia emtoris terratum, no man can

aliene ne graunte landes or tenementꝭ
in fee ſimple to holde of hym
selfe, ſo that nowe yf a man ſeaſed
of landes in fee and graunteth the
ſame by licence to an abbot ī franke
almoyne / theſe wordes franke almoyne
be voide, and the abbot ſhall
holde them immediatly of the lorde
of the feoffer by the ſame ſeruyces
that the feofer held / ſo that no man
can hold in franke almoyne, but by
force of a graūt made before ye ſayd
eſtatute onely the kynge excepted / 
for he is out of the compas of the
ſtatute.
            Finally, ye ſhall note that where
as a mā holdeth in franke almoyne
his lorde is bounde by the lawe to
acqnyte hym of al maner of ſeruice
that any other lorde can haue or demaunde
out of the ſayd landes.
            That yf he dothe not acquyte hym

but ſuffre him to be diſtreyned, thā
he ſhal haue agaynſt his lorde a certayne
wryt, called a wryt of meane
and ſhall recouer agaynſt hym his
damages and coſtes of his ſuite.
         
         
            ¶Of burgage.
            ¶A tenure in burgage, is where
an auncient burgh is of which the
kynge is lord / and they which haue
tenemētes within the ſame burgh
holde the ſame of the kyng, paying
a certeyne annuall rent, whiche tenure
in effect is but ſocage tenure.
Semblably it is where as any other
lorde ſpirituall or temperall is
lorde of ſuche burgh.
            Here ye ſhal note that for yt mooſt
parte ſuch auncient burghes haue
dyuers cuſtomes & vſages whiche
other townes haue not. For ſome
burghes haue a cuſtome, that the
yongeſt ſonne ſhall inheryte before

theldeſt, which cuſtome is called
cōmonly burgh Englyſſhe.
            Alſo in ſome burghes by the cuſtome
the woman ſhal haue for her
dower all the landes and tenementes
wherof her huſbande was ſeaſed
at any tyme duringe the couerture.
            Moreouer in ſome burghes a
man maye deuyſe his landes or tenementes
by teſtament at the tyme
of his deth / and by force of ſuche deuyſe
or legacye, he to whom the bequeſt
was made, after the dethe of
the teſtatour maye by force of this
auncient cuſtome entre ī to the landes
ſo to him bequethed or deuiſed
wtout any lyuerye of ſeaſon to hym
made or further ceremony of lawe.
            Dyuers other cuſtomes in Englande
there be contrary to ye courſe
of the cōmon lawe, whiche yf they

be any thynge probable and maye
ſtande with reaſon are good and effectuall
/ notwithſtandynge they be
agaynſt the cōmon lawe.
         
         
            ¶Of villenage.
            ¶A tenaunte in vyllenage is properly
whan a vilayne / that is to
ſay / a bondman holdeth of his lord
(whoſe bondman he is) certayne
landes or tenementes, accordynge
to the cuſtome of ye maner or otherwyſe
at the wyl of his lorde / and to
do his lorde villayne ſeruyce: as to
beare and to carye the donge of his
lorde out of the citye, or out of his
lordes maner, and to laye it vpon
the demene landes of his lorde / or
to do ſuche lyke ſeruyle or villayne
ſeruyce. How be it fre men in ſome
places holde theyr tenementes and
landes of theyr lordes by cuſtome,
by ſuche maner of ſeruyce / & theyr

tenure, is called tenure ī villenage / 
and yet they them ſelues be no villaynes.
For the lande holden in villenage
maketh not the tenaunte a
villayne, but contrarye wyſe a villayne
maye make free lande to be
villayne lande vnto his lorde. As if
a villayne purchaſeth lande in fee
ſimple or in fee tayle, the lord of the
villayne maye entre in to the lande
ſo purcaſed by his bondman, & put
hym and his heyres out for euer / 
and this done, the lorde yf he wyll
may leaſe the ſame lande to his villayne
to holde of hym in villenage.
            And here ye ſhall vnderſtande,
that ſeruitute or villenage, is thordinaunce,
not of the lawe of nature
but of that lawe, whiche is called
Ius gentium, by whiche a man is
made ſubiecte (contrary to nature)
vnto an other mannes dominion.

For he that is a vyllayne or bondman,
eyther he is ſo by tytle of preſcription
(that is to ſay) he and his
aunceſtours haue ben vyllaynes
tyme out of mynde / or elles he is a
villayne by his owne confeſſyon in
courte of recorde / ſo that all villaynes
either they be borne villaynes,
or elles they be made ſo. They be
borne villaynes whan theyr father
bernge a bonde man hym ſelfe begetteth
them in lawfull wedlocke,
eyther of a fre woman or of a bond
woman, for ſo that the father be
bonde, the iſſue of hym lawfully begoten
muſte nedes be bonde by the
lawes of Englande, hauinge no regarde
to the condicion of ye mother / 
whereas in ye ciuill lawe it is clene
contrarye. For there partus ſequitur
ventrem (that is to ſaye) the ſeruitute
or bondage of ye mother maketh

the chylde boūde and not of the
father. How be it the baſtarde ſone
of a bondman ſhal not be bonde, bycauſe
a baſtarde is Nullius filius in
the lawe.
            They be made vyllaynes two
wayes, eyther by theyr owne acte,
as whan a free man beynge of full
age wyll come in to a courte of recorde,
and there confeſſe hym ſelfe
bonde to an other man.
            Or elles by the lawes of armes called
Ius gentium: as whan a man is
taken pryſoner in warres, and is
compelled to ſerue, and become the
thrall & bondman of hym that toke
him, the lawe calleth ſuche perſone
a vulayne.
            And ye ſhall note that vyllaynes
he ꝓperly called in latyn Serui, bycauſe
that whan they be taken in
warre, the captaynes be wont not

to kyll them, but to ſell them / and ſo
to ſaue theyr lyfes / ſo that they be
called Serui a ſeruādo, that is to ſay
of ſauyng. They be alſo called Mancipia a manu capiendo, bycauſe that
they be taken by hande of the enaemyes.
            Nowe as I ſayd by the lawe of
nature we are all borne free: but
after that by the lawe of gentillite
ſeruitute inuaded the worlde, than
enſued ye benefite of manumiſſion,
Manumiſſion is De manu da
                     ••
                  o,
that is to ſaye a gyuynge out of the
hande or power. For ſo longe as a
man is in ſeruitute, he is ſubiecte
to the hand and power of an other / 
and whan he is manumiſſed he is
made free, and delyuered from the
ſaid power / ſo that a manumiſſion
is nothynge elles than an enfranchiſement
/ that is to ſaye, a wrytynge,

teſtifieng that the lord hath
enfranchiſede his villayne and all
his ſequell.
            Alſo yf the lorde maketh to his
villayne an obligacion of a certeyn
ſomme of money, or graunteth to
hym by his dede an annuitie, or leaſeth
to hym by dede landes or tenementes
for terme of yeres, any of
theſe actes do imply an enfrāchiſement.
            Lykewyſe yf the lorde maketh
a feoffement to his villayne, & maketh
vnto him liueri of ſeaſon, this
alſo is an enfranchiſemēt. Brefely
to ſpeke, where ſo euer the lorde cō
               pelleth
his villaine by the courſe of
the lawe to do that thynge that he
might enforce him to do or to ſuffre
wtout thauctorite of ye lawe, he doth
by implicacion enfranchiſe his villayn:
as if ye lord wil bryng agaynſt

his villayne an action of det, an action
of accompte of couenaunt or of
treſpace: theſe and ſuche lyke be in
the eye of the lawe manumiſſions,
bycauſe that the lord in al theſe caſes
may haue theffecte of his ſuite
(that is to ſay) the goodes, catels,
and correction of his villayne wtout
the compulſion of the lawe by his
owne propre power and authorite,
which he hath vpon his villayne.
But if the lord ſue his villayne by
an appeale of felonye, the villayne
beynge lawfully indyted of ye ſame
before, this is no infranchiſement / 
for the lord though he haue power
to beate his vilayne and to ſpoyle
hym of his goodes, yet he can not
put hym to deth / 
            Ye ſhall alſo vnderſtande, that if
a mannes villayne purchaſeth landes,
or acquire vnto hym any other

thynge / the lorde may by and by en

                  〈◊〉
                ſeaſe the ſame in to his owne
handes. Wherfore yf the lord wyll
brynge agaynſt his vyllayne a Precipe
quod reddat, by whiche he demaūdeth
agaynſt his vyllayne any
landes or tenementes, this implyeth
an enfrancheſemēt / foraſmoche
as he byndeth hym ſelfe to the preſcripte
and authoritye of the lawe / 
where as he myght vſe his owne
authoritie, by entryng and ſeaſyng
the ſayd landes
            Finally ye ſhall marke that ſome
vyllaynes be called vyllaynes in
groſſe, and ſome be called villaines
regardaunt. In groſſe be they of
which the lorde is ſeuerally ſeaſed,
and not by reaſon of any lordeſhyp
or maner: but they be called regardaunt
whiche do belonge to a maner,
of which the lord is ſeaſed, and

the ſayd vilaynes haue ben regardaunt
(that is to ſaye) expectaunt
and attendaunt tyme out of mynde
to the lord of the ſayd maner, in doynge
vnto hym ſuche ſeruyces as
to a villayne appertayne.
