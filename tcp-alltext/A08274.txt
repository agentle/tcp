               TAke early in the
morning of thy
life a Quart of
true and vnfained
Repentance of
Niniuie, and put to it both
your hands full of feruent
Faith in Christs blood, which
was shed for you; with asmuch
Hope and Charity of the purest
that you can purchase
with teares vnfained, from the
Garden of Gods Word, of
each of these a like quantity,
and put them into the vessell
of a cleare and vnspotted conscience,

and let them boile well
in the fiery flames of true and
hearty loue, till you see by the
perfect eye of your faith, and
feele by your zeale illuminated,
the black fome of the loue
of the world to stinke in your
stomacke. Then scumme it off
with the spoone of faithfull
prayer: that done, take the immaculate
cloath of Christs
pure innocency, and couer
you warme with as many
cloathes of the Amendment
of life as God shall strengthen
you to beare: And then lie
downe on your bed, ioyned
with the peace of God, and
sweat out all the vile poison of
couetousnesse, Idolatry, and
the participation thereof, with
alkind of pride, oppression, extortion,
deceit, sedition, sects,
enuie, swearing, adultery,

theft, drunkennesse, sloth, and
the like, let this bee distilled
through the limbeck of a clean
heart: then apply the sweet
ointment of a good conuersation,
and lay it to your nose,
for feare you smell after your
neighbors goods: And when
you feele your selfe clensed
from all these fore-named diseases,
then take the powder of
Say-well, and lay it on your
tongue to sauour your mouth,
and the eares of the hearers;
but drink three times as much
Doe-well. And anoint your
hands with the oyle of gladnesse,
to doe good workes, that
they may be supple and ready
to minister to the poore distressed
members of Christ as
you see good occasion and are
able: but beware of taking the
wind of vaine-glory in the giuing,

lest the daily gusts therof
do you much harme, let these
bee incorporated all into one
body with the iuyce of the
Herbe of Grace, of which if
thou faile, all the rest will doe
thee little pleasure, neither can
they bee operatiue to either
soule or body. And then arise
from sin willingly, & walk out
your course worthily: and take
vp Christs crosse patiently and
beare it thankfully: obserue
these precepts carefully, and
be mindfull of them daily, and
pray these prayers following
zealously, and God will blesse
thee continually, and so shalt
thou liue euerlastingly: which
God grant, Amen say I.

By thy Father.
         
         
            
            The Fathers Legacy.
            In certaine Morall
precepts for the better
ordering of his life.
Concerning thy selfe.
            
            1 BEgin the day in the seruice
of God, continue it
in his feare, that thou mayest
end it in his fauor.
            2 When thou canst not
spend the day in honourable
actions, thou maiest in vertuous
Contemplations, but bee
sure to put thy knowledge into
practice.
            3 In all things shew a noble
mind, and aboue all things auoid

basenesse; if thy birth be
noble shame it not, if meane,
let thy vertues raise it.
            4 Neuer striue to please all
men, or indeed any man whom
thou needst not feare, since
whateuer thou doest will displease
some body, if thou canst
please thy selfe and not offend
God, it is no matter whether
others be pleased or no.
            5 Be neither seruile, nor officious
to any (though greater
then thy selfe) from whom
thou neither regardest fauour,
nor fearest wrath: giue them
no occasion of offence, nor
take iniury at their hands.
            6 With thy superior in degree
shew thy selfe neither too
awfull nor familiar, with thy
equall bee both courteous and
familiar, with thy inferiour
though courteous yet not too
familiar.
            
               
7 Bee sparing to praise or
dispraise thy selfe in any quality:
the first sauour of vaine-glory,
the other of folly, neither
meddle with others actions
either in way of approbation,
or contumely; for as the
one will get thee neuer the
more loue, so the other, will
will get thee much more hatred.
            8 Auoide rather those that
flatter thee, then those that reproue
thee: one loues thy purse,
the other thy person.
            Intrude not thy selfe into any
company where the place is
priuate, nor enter into counsell
vnrequired, and let thy aduice
sauour rather of wisdome,
then wit, for so thou shalt saue
thy credit and thy friends.
            10 Let thy company where
thou mayest haue welcome be

waies of the best sort, but shun
all those that shall intice thee
to any base action.
            11 Marry not till thou beest
thy owne man, to dispose of
thy estate thy selfe, neither
marry till thou hast a competent
estate to defray that
charge which mariage of necessity
brings with it.
            12 If thou be poore marry
late and far off, if rich, quickly
and neer home, let thy wife be
either vertuous, noble, rich, or
faire, for without these or one
of these, there can be no loue.
Nobilitie and riches may be a
meanes to aduance posteritie,
vertue and beauty will adde to
thy selfe pleasure and content,
but neuer marry for beauty
onely, lest time or sicknesse
shew thee thy folly.
            13 As neere as thou canst

chose one better qualified in
mind then body, whose soule
is faire as her face, hansome
and neat in her apparell, not
gay, nor sluttish; silent, yet not
dumbe when occasion serues
to speake, with a blushing
cheeke, rather then a brazen
forehead, milde and gentle spirited,
and one that cannot bee
angry, free-hearted, yet not lauish,
louing to all, familiar to
few, alwaies mery, seldome
wanton.
            14 If thou hast children bring
them vp in all noble qualities,
to make them worthy instruments
either for Church or
Common-wealth: but constraine
none of them to apply
themselues to any thing against
nature, and winne them
rather by loue and gentlenesse,
then harsh seuerity.
            
               
15 Let thy house be rather
necessary and neat, then large
and rude, yet if thy estate and
calling be great, let thy house
bee answerable without and
within.
            16 Let thy house-keeping be
alwaies bountifull, neuer prodigall,
rather abounding then
wanting, but neuer to win credit
stretch thy purse beyond its
bounds, nor let thy charge bee
greater then thy reuenues, and
take heed of paying vse-mony.
            17 Let all thy house funiture
be of the best, not only to
shew but for vse also, so shalt
thou not onely content but
pleasure thy friends, whose
loue if thou wilt gaine, let thy
house be to him alwaies as his
own, freely, without grudging,
the signe of a base nature.
            18 Inuite not any man,

especially great men) to thy
house, vnlesse thou haue exercise
to recreate them abroad
aswell as within, hunting, hawking,
bowling, &c. for without
these he will quickly be weary;
and let me aduise thee, if thou
be able, alwaies to keepe a stable
of good horses, excellent
for some qualitie, which will
not onely please all men, but
shall get thee the name of generous.
            19 Let thy seruants bee so
many as thou mayest imploy
in honest offices, such as will
neither be idle nor ill imployd:
for thy house affaires choose
aged & well experienced men,
rather profitable then hansome,
but such as waite on thy
person or thy friends, gentlemen-like
in body or mind, neither
let drudges, as horse-keepers

or labourers, or such like
come neere thy person, or thy
table, for either their rude behauiour
or ill smell will bee offensiue.
For thy maidseruants
take this rule, let thy house bee
well deckt with them (such I
meane as be hansome) for they
grace a house more then all
thy other furniture, and let thy
wife haue alwayes a couple of
Gentlewomen to attend her
person at the least, and remember
that sluts and foule sowes
will haue alwaies sluttish conditions.
            20 Finally, banish from thy
house all rude and ruffian-like
fellowes, with ignorant and
hypocriticall puritans.
         
         
            
            A Morning
Prayer.
            
               O LORD God,
our most gracious,
louing
and mercifull
FATHER in
Christ Iesus,
we thy poore and most vnworthy
seruants do here prostrate
our selues, both soules and bodies,
before the Throne of thy
heauenly Maiesty, humbly acknowledging
and confessing
from the bottom of our hearts,
that we are most vile, miserable,
and sinfull wretches, conceiued
in sin, brought forth in

iniquitie, and so haue continued
all our life time: Not
worthy O Lord, of the least of
all thy blessings, but deserue
iustly for our sinnes eternall
death and damnation, and to
be cast for euer from thy presence.
Heauenly Father, wee
confesse freely against our
owne soules, that our sins are
moe in number then the hairs
of our heads, or the sands of
the sea, or the stars of heauen;
and that we haue broken and
transgressed al thy holy Commandemēts,
both in thought,
word, and deed, from our infancy
to our youth, from our
youth to our riper age, from
the day of our birth to this
present day. The euil, O Lord,
which we should not doe, we
haue done, and the good which
we should haue done, we haue

omitted. We haue made no
conscience of our wayes, no
regard of thy promises, no
feare of thy threatnings. We
haue made vs other gods in
thy sight, a god of our gold,
a god of our belly, a god of euery
affection: we haue blasphemed
thy holy name: wee
haue profaned thy Sabbaths:
we haue polluted thy Sanctuary:
wee haue despised thy
Word: we haue done all manner
of euill in thy sight, and the
feare of thy Maiesty hath not
beene before vs. Thy mercy
hath not allured vs, thy iudgements
haue not terrified vs;
but with a high hand we haue
heaped sinne vpon sinne, and
gone on still in all manner of
wickednesse, vntill wee haue
made it too heauy a burden
for vs to beare.
            
               
What then belongs vnto vs
thou iust Iudge of all the
world, but eternall confusion
both of soule and body. Neuerthelesse,
appealing from
thy iustice, wee implore thy
mercy, and intreat thee in Iesus
Christ to be reconciled vnto
vs; for his sake to pardon
and forgiue vs all our sins, to
naile them on his Crosse, to
bury them in his graue, and to
warn them away in his most
pretious bloud. Wash vs O
Lord, and wee shall be clean:
clense vs, and wee shall passe
the snow in whitnesse: Good
Lord be mercifull vnto vs, pardon
and forgiue vs all that is
past, and giue vs grace to leade
a more holy life then we haue
done hitherto. And to this
end, O blessed Lord God, because
our hearts are the sinkes

of all our sinnes, and the fountaines
of all our vncleannesse,
sanctifie our vncleane hearts,
mortifie our sinfull affections,
pacifie our impure thoughts,
clense our wicked cogitations:
O Lord renew a right spirit
within vs, O Lord giue vs
grace to conceiue aright of
the wonderfull things of thy
Law, & to practice the things
that concerne thy glory.
            And because O Lord wee
should be the more vnworthy
to receiue any good thing
from thee, if we should not be
truly thankfull for those many
good things which we haue
already receiued, we render
vnto thy diuine Maiesty all
possible praise and thankes for
all those blessings which thou
hast so mercifully from time
to time bestowed vpon vs. We

thanke thee O Lord for our election
before we were: for
our creation and what we are:
for our redemption when we
were lost: for our iustification,
and sanctification in this life,
and for our assured hope of
glorification in the life to
come.
            We thanke thee deare Father,
for whatsoeuer good concerns
either soule or body: for
our liues, and for our liberty:
for our peace, & for our plenty:
for our health, and our prosperitie:
and aboue all, for the
sweet and inestimable iewell of
thy holy Word. Thou hast
been more gracious to vs, then
to other Nations. O Lord we
were a people that sate in
darknesse and in the shadow
of death, but thou hast opened
our eyes, and giuen vs a lanterne

for our feete, and a light
for our paths: let not our sins
we beseech thee, remoue this
candle-sticke from vs.
            Wee thanke thee O Lord,
that thou hast sealed vnto our
consciences the free, and full
remission of all our sinnes in
Christ Iesus.
            Wee thanke thee that thou
hast kept vs from many sinnes
which our fraile nature might
haue committed, and for sauing
vs from many dangers
whereinto we might haue fallen:
Lord keepe vs both from
sinne and danger.
            And because both of the
weaknesse of our nature, and
the number of our enemies,
how busie they are to tempt,
& how ready we are to yeeld,
Lord shield vs with thy grace,
and protect vs with thy Spirit

against all the assaults & temptations
both of the world, the
flesh, and the deuill. Let not
the flesh allure vs, let not
the world bewitch vs, let not
the deuill vanquish vs; but
grant good God, that by the
mediation of Christ, and the
assistance of thy blessed Spirit,
against all these we may be
more then conquerours.
            Wee thanke thee O Lord
that thou hast preserued vs to
this present houre; and because
the time of our pilgrimage
here on earth is but
short, Lord giue vs grace to
spend it in thy feare: teach vs
to number our dayes, and that
little time we haue to liue to
bestow it wisely. And for as
much as thy Kingdome O
Christ is not of this world,
neither consisteth in meat, or

drinke, but in righteousnesse,
and peace, and ioy in the holy
Ghost, grant O heauenly Father,
that we renouncing this
world, and crucifying the lusts
of this sinfull life, and being
borne anew by thy Word and
holy Spirit, setting our affections
vpon things aboue, and
hauing our conuersation in
heauen, may after this life ended
obtaine the inheritance of
eternall life, and rest with thee
and thy Sonne Christ in the
Kingdom of Heauen for euer
and euer. Amen.
            
            Our Father which art &c.
         
         
            
            An Euening
Prayer.
            
               OH eternall and euer-liuing
God;
most holy, and
iust; most omnipotent,
gracious,
mercifull, and louing Father,
and my only Lord and
Sauiour; I a wretched and sinfull
creature, thy vnworthy
seruant, yea, rather the seruant
of sinne, and bondslaue
of iniquitie, the sonne of Adam,
yet through Christ my
Sauiour and his righteousnesse,
thy adopted childe, and
a member of his mysticall body:

Doe here humbly prostrate
my soule, and cast down
my self before thy footstoole &
mercy-seate (oh euer-liuing
Redeemer) acknowledging
and confessing from the bottome
of my heart mine owne
vnrighteousnesse, and manifold
sinnes and transgressions,
my disobedience and rebellion
this day committed against
thy holy and sacred
Maiesty, my contempt of thy
Word & Commandements,
my vaine conuersation and
corrupt affections, my continuall
breach of thy most holy
and reuealed Will, in thought,
word, and deed, whereby I
haue deserued thy iust iudgements
and wrathfull indignation
to be poured downe vpon
me, vile and wretched sinner,
and vtterly to be cast out

of thy sight, and to be deliuered
to Satan my deadly enemy,
who daily and hourely laboureth
to win me from thee,
and to cast me into vtter darknesse,
where there is nothing
but weeping and gnashing of
teeth. O Lord my deseruings
doe astonish my heart, and dazell
mine eyes, that I dare not
looke vp to heauen; my sinnes
doe presse me downe to the
depth and bottomlesse pit of
hell; my conscience doth
challenge mee a thousand
waies, for offending thee so
good and so gracious a God:
My ghostly enemie is a roareing
and a ramping Lyon, ready
euery minute to deuoure
me, is busie with me day and
night, he casteth a mist before
mine eyes, that I cannot see
thy holy Will reuealed in thy

Word, and still vrgeth my sins
vnto my conscience, driuing
me into despaire of thy mercy
in Christ Iesus, and feedeth
my fantasie with manifold visions,
he troubleth my minde
with dangerous assaults, deludeth
my senses, and striueth to
draw me aside from euery
good exercise, and from the
fellowship of thy Saints here
militant vpon earth. Oh Lord
my God, iust are thy iudgements,
great are my sinnes, but
thy mercy is far aboue all thy
workes: for thou desirest not
the death of a sinner, nor takest
pleasure in the damnation
of Soules; thou hast ordained
life, and health, and all saluation
is from thee. Oh God
most high, thou hast giuen vs
thy dearely beloued Sonne Iesus
Christ, that who soeuer beleeueth

in him, should not perish,
but haue life euerlasting.
And how can it be, but with
him thou shouldest giue vs all
things necessary for this life,
and the life to come? In him,
and for his sake, I thy poore
afflicted creature groaning vnder
the burthen of my sinnes,
and altogether tyred through
the manifold temptations of
Satan and this wicked world,
doe most humbly intreat thee
to forgiue and pardon all my
iniquities and sinnes whatsoeuer,
committed against thy diuine
Maiestie; Most mercifull
Father, for Christs sake, lay
them no longer to my charge;
for I am not able to beare thy
threatning hand against mee.
Suffer not Satan to delude me
any longer, nor abuse my
weakenesse, not to deceiue my

senses and fantasie; suffer him
not (O Lord) to deuoure my
soule. Oh sweet Sauiour
Christ, thou fountaine of liuing
waters, and that true brazen
Serpent that healest all infirmities,
and the sting of that
fiery Serpent that hath wounded
my conscience: thou
which callest vnto thee all
those that trauell and are heauie
loaden with the burthen of
their sins and feeling of their
infirmities, promising them
ease in Conscience, and Rest
vnto their soules: I most wretched
and vile sinner, meekely
beseech thee, euen for thy promise
sake, that thou wilt receiue
me, and ease my burthen
which is too heauie vpon me
day and night. Oh thou
sweet Samaritan, poure thy
Wine and Oyle of gladnesse

into my wounded heart; giue
me to drinke of the water of
life, that whoso drinketh freely
shall neuer thirst againe, euen
of the fountaine of euer-liuing
waters. (Oh sweet Iesu) thou
Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda,
preserue my soule, and deliuer
it from the mouth of the
rouring Lyon. Oh holy Spirit,
proceeding from the Father
and the Sonne; thou
Comforter of Gods Elect,
worke in my heart a true and
liualy faith, whereby I may
quench all the fiery darts of the
deuill, and may with-stand all
his assaults. (Oh Lord) I doe
confesse it is my weaknesse
that maketh him so strong; my
cowardlinesse that maketh
him so ventrous; my bashfulnesse
that maketh him bold.
And therefore (O Lord) I

humbly poure out my soule
before thee this night, praying
thee to increase my faith, to
strengthen me in the inward
man, to arme me with thy
spirituall armour; giue mee
strength and power I beseech
thee most blessed Trinitie, to
fight valiantly against Satan,
and wisely to preuent all his
practises against me. And here
(O Lord) according as I am
bound, I render vnto thee all
possible praise and thankes for
all those blessings and benefits
which thou so graciously and
plentifully hast bestowed on
my soule and body, for this
life, and that which is to come;
namely, for my Election, Creation,
Redemption, Vocation,
Iustification, Sanctification,
and continuall preseruation
vntill this present day and

houre, and for the firme hope
of Glorification; and likewise,
for my health, wealth, foode,
raiment and prosperity: more
especially, for that thou hast
defended me this day now past
from all dangers both of soule
and body; defend me, O Lord,
this night, and likewise all the
rest of my daies and nights, I
haue to liue in the pilgrimage
of this sinfull world, that so
hauing victory through Christ
I may sing vnto thee the blessed
Trinitie, All Honour, Praise,
Glory, Power, Might and Maiesty,
be to the Father, the
Sonne, and the Holy Ghost,
both now and for euer.
Amen.
            
            Our father which art in
heauen, &c.
            
            
               And so my soule, this night, into
thy hands I commit.
            
         
         
            
            The Fathers Repentant
teares.
            
               1
               IF that a sinners sighes
               be Angels food,
               Or that repentant teares
               be Angels wine:
               Accept O Lord in this
               most pensiue mood,
               These hearty sighes
               and faithfull teares of mine,
               That went with Peter forth
               most sinfully.
               But not as Peter wept
               most bitterly.
            
            
               2
               If I had Dauids Crowne
               to me betide,
               Or all his purpled clothes
               that I might weare.
               I would lay then such honor
               all aside.
               
                  
And onely seeke a sackcloth
               weed to beare:
               His Palace would I leaue
               that I might show
               With him in cell
               for such offence my woe.
            
            
               3
               There should these hands
               beat on my pensiue brest,
               And sad to death for sorrow
               rent my haire.
               My voice to call on thee
               should neuer rest,
               Whose grace I seeke,
               whose iudgements I doe feare:
               Vpon the ground all groueling
               on my face.
               I would beseech thy fauour,
               and thy grace.
            
            
               4
               But sith I haue no meane
               to make the show
               Of my repentant mind,
               and yet I see,
               
                  
My sinnes to greater heapes
               then his doe grow,
               Whereby the danger more
               it is to me;
               I put my trust in his most
               pretious blood,
               Whose life was sold to purchase
               all our good.
            
            
               5
               Thy mercy greater is
               then any sin:
               Thy greatnesse none can
               euer comprehend:
               Wherefore O Lord let mee
               thy mercies winne,
               Whose glorious name no time
               shall euer end.
               Wherefore I say, all praise
               belongs to thee:
               Whom I beseech
               be mercifull to me.
            
            FINIS.
