            THE AVTHORS EPISTLE TO HIS FRIEND.
            
               WORTHY, & welbeloued Friend, you shal pleaſe to vnderſtand, that at my late being at the Hage in Holland, I receaued your leter, wherin you deſire me

to deſcribe vnto you the Countrey; & condition of the people, as alſo to know my opinion of their cauſe and quarrell againſt the King of Spayne, about which they haue ſo long troubled the world: Moreouer how I find thē in their thankefulnes vnto our State, for ſo longe ſticking vnto them, and ayding them: And what thoſe differences are which are lately riſen vp among them about matters of Religion.
            This letter of yours I had no tyme to anſwere frō thence, neither would the anſwering it there haue beene conuenient; I therefore deſerred the anſwere, vntill my comming into France,
               
to which iourney I was reſolued before the receit of your letter; becauſe (to deale truely with you) I could not any longer endure to heare the lauish and vile ſpeaches, which a ſort of baſe vnbridled people dayly diſgorged againſt the Maieſty of our King, whereof in the enſuing diſcourſe ſomwhat more shalbe ſpoken. And indeed this intollerable demeanour of theirs toward the Maieſty of ſo great and ſo bountifull a Prince, and to whome they are ſo much beholding, hath giuen me good cauſe aſwell to looke into the iuſtneſſe of their wars againſt the King of Spaine, as into their

in gratitude vnto the King and State of England, and therby to become the more able to giue you ſatiſfaction to the demands in your letter.
            I muſt notwithſtāding confeſſe, that ſince my aryuall heer in Paris, I haue for ſome whyle deferred it: for as on the one ſide I had a great deſyre thereunto, ſo on the other ſyde, I found in my ſelfe a kind of vnwillingnes to begin it; which vnwillingnes I proteſt vnto you, proceeded of a conceaued feare to offend you, when in deliuering you the very true and playne truthe of thinges as they are, you might fynd me altered in mynd and

iudgment from what I was when I was cōuerſant with you in England. But conſidering that the true duety of a friend is, with his friend to deale vnfaignedly, I haue now at laſt vndertaken the taske ſo to do. And in ſuch regard muſt intreate you, to excuſe me, and not to let my ignorance of the time when I cōuerſed with you be put in oppoſition againſt the better knowledge which experience of ryper years hath yielded me; for you muſt think that by trauailing abroad in other Countryes, & conuerſing with men of vnderſtanding of diuers nations, who in theſe parts are accuſtomed to freneſſe

of ſpeach; by reading the iudicious writings of ſuch credible Authors, as haue noted downe the actions of State of this time; as alſo by the obſeruatiōs which myſelfe haue made, I haue ſeen as it were a miſt wip

And thus leauing you to

God, in all kind affection I take of you my leaue.

                  HOLLAND at the creation of the world was no Land at all, and therefore not at the firſt intended by God or nature for a dwelling place of men, for it was then & long after a ſea, and conſequently the habitation of fiſhes.

the meaneſt of the ſeauen mettalles, or any mineral matter at al. But what ſhal I ſpeak of their want of mynes in the earth, when they haue want of earth it ſelf; and yet notwithſtanding their want therof, are faigne to make vſe of that litle they haue for their fuell, and ſo begin to burne vp their Countrey before the day of Iudgement.
            Graſſe they haue, and that is all the greateſt good that their ground can affoard them, and heerof butter and cheeſe are the wittneſſes: but for this one benefit, they want many which other Countries haue that haue this as wel as they. To ſay the truth, I do not know any benefits peculiar to themſelues whereof they may boaſt, except only two: the one is their hauing of a Country which is the fitteſt for rebelliō in all Chriſtendome; and the other is, that by reaſon of the great lowneſſe of their dwelling, they are the neereſt neighbours to the Diuel, of any nation

liuing vpon earth.

            Hell is nothing ſo odious vnto this people, as is the Spaniſh Inquiſitiō, albeit they liue in more danger of hell then of it. The reaſon why they ſo much hate it, is becauſe it hateth the Babel of their belief But notwithſtāding their profeſſed freedom of al Religions, they can finde meanes without vſing the name of

            They had rather heare blaſphemy vttered againſt God, then any word of the abridging of any their priuiledges, which they conſerue ſo inuiolably, that they haue quite broken the beſt, and abuſed all the others: ſo as the reaſon why they ſtand ſo much vpon them, appeareth to be, becauſe they would haue no body to be the breakers of them, but The high powerſull Lords the States themſelues.
            The words of Soueraigne authority Sic volo, ſic iubeo, are in tollerable in their eares, for their taking place before right and reaſon, as Langenes telleth vs, in his booke of Mappes printed at Amſterdam 1599.
            It ſeemeth they much affect the Storke, becauſe, as they ſay, ſhe ſeeketh

not to liue in any Countrey that is gouerned by a King, and therefore when ſhe coms into Europe, ſhe holds her reſidence moſt in Switzerland, and Holland.
            
            The regiment of a Beaſt with ſeauen heades pleaſeth them beſt, becauſe it is a monſter that ryſeth out of the ſea, and becauſe poſſibility giueth hope that any Beer-brewer, or Basket-maker by vulgar cōmendation of his friends, may at one tyme or other be raiſed to the dignity of one of The powerfull Lords the States.
            
            One great prerogatiue I muſt confeſſe this people to haue, which they do not bragge of, and this is, that when at the day of Iudgement the wicked ſhall ſay vnto the Mountaines fall vpon vs, & vnto the hills couer vs; thoſe that be wicked in Holland becauſe they haue no hills, ſhall but need to cut their bankes through, & the ſea of it ſelf wil ſtraight wayes ouer whelme them. I am verily perſwaded, that if this people had been

the rebels of any other King or Prince in the world then of th

                King of Spain, he would as well haue made the ſea to haue holpen him to reuenge his quarell vpon them, as they haue made it to aſſiſt them in their rebellion againſt him: and that this by the ſea might be brought to paſſe is apparent inough, and the ſea it ſelfe gaue proofe therof, when not forty yeares before this their great rebellion, it drowned foure hundred & foure of their villages. Nor would themſelues omit to do the ſame, if they might therby haue the like aduantage againſt the King of Spayne: for in ſundry places both of Flanders and Brabant, they haue long ſince begon ſome practiſe of it, to the diſaduantage of the ſayd King, and the detriment of ſuch of his ſubiects as liued vnder him in their due obedience.
            But now to be no longer tedious vnto you in this Countrey and peoples deſcription, I wil come vnto the beginning and originall cauſe of their rebellion.

Yo

                ſhall therefore vnderſtand, that King Philippe the ſecond before-named, departed out of theſe Netherlands towards Spayne in the yeare of our Lord 1559. then being in full poſſeſſion of all the ſeauenteene Prouinces, to wit, of the ſeauen now vnited in rebelon, whereof Holl
                     •
                  nd is the chiefe, and the ten others. The Soueraignty of all which Prouinces, he receaued as true and ſole heyre ſucceſſiuely from his Father the Emperor 
                  
                     •
                  harle the fifth, who in like manner had them ſucceſſiuely frō his Father, to whome they likewiſe were deſcended from his Anceſtours.
            At his departure, he left all theſe Countryes in peace & plenty, hauing no ciuill broyles amongſt themſelues, nor warres with other Nations. Their religion was the ſame wherunto aboue eight hundred yeares before they were brought, when firſt they were conuerted from Paganiſme to Chriſtianity: to the maintenance of which Religion,

as alſo of the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate in all her rig
                  •
               ts and priuiledges, the ſayd King was ſworne, as to one of the chiefeſt of all other priuiledges.
            He left for ſupreme Gouerneſſe vnder him in theſe Prouinces the Lady Margaret Ducheſſe of Parma his natural ſiſter by the Fathers ſide: but neither left he any Spaniſh Lifetenant Gouernour of any of theſe Prouinces vnder her, nor had he any army or troopes of Spaniſh ſouldiers in al the Country, but left ech particuler gouernement to the Nobility of the Country it ſelfe, with other benefits beſtowed vpon euery of them. And beſides the ſundry benefits both in titles of honour, and in riches which the aforeſayd Emperour Charles had beſtowed vpon William of Naſſaw, Prince of Orange; this King Philip his ſonne, not diminiſhing but much augmenting them, left him alſo Lifetenant Gouernour of ſome of theſe Prouinces.
            Thus departed the ſayd king Philip
               
into Spayne, without giuing the leaſt cauſe of diſcontentment to any of the Nobility or people of theſe Countries, leauing them all in obligation of loue & loyalty, & in more floriſhing eſtate thē euer they were before. But as prodigall ſeruants are wont to beare themſelues in the abſence of their maiſters, ſo ſome of this forſayd Nobility bearing themſelues far aboue the limits of their meanes, became greatly behind hand, and indebted, & thereupon attendant for ſome one or other remedy (now in the abſence of their Soueraigne Lord) which might keep their eſtates from declyning wholy to ruine. And amongſt theſe, there lurcked in the hart of the aforſaid William of Naſſaw Prince of Orange, as well a deſyre of reuenge, as of remedy for the vnderpropping of his decayed eſtate. This deſire of reuenge was not for any wronges or iniuries donne or ſuffred to be donne vnto him by the king of Spayne, but a reuenge forſooth,

becauſe the greedy appetit of his inſatiable ambition was not fully ſatisfyed. For knowing that the King of Spayne after he had receaued poſſeſſiō of theſe Netherland Prouinces, muſt needs returne agayne into Spayne, and leaue ſome generall Gouernour thereof behind him, he laboured by what meanes he might both by himſelfe and ſuch of the Nobility as were of his faction, that this authority might be giuen vnto the Lady Christierna Ducheſſe of Lorayne, & daughter vnto the ſiſter of the Emperour Charles the fifth, who was maryed vnto Chri
                     ••
                  iernus the third, King of Denmarcke; and this Ducheſſe had a daughter called the Lady Dorothy, and with this Lady the aforeſayd Prince of Orange meant to haue maryed, that by this meanes after the death of the Ducheſſe Chriſtierna he might haue come to haue beene Supreme gouernour of the whole low Countries. But by reaſon of the Ducheſſe of Parma her being

preferred vnto this dignity, & his deſignment broken, he out of cōceaued reuenge went and maryed with a daughter of Mauritius Duke of Saxony being in religion a Lutheran; and with her returned agayne into the Netherlandes, retayning ſtill in his hart the mali
                  •
               e which he had cōceaued, & the expectation of ſome occaſiō of further reueng, with reparation of his decayed eſtate.
            Now is it to be noted, that albeit Martin Luther the New-Religiō-maker of Germany, dyed not paſt three years before king Philip departed out of theſe Netherlandes, yet were there already, by meanes of him and his diſciples ſix ſeueral religions riſen vp in theſe Coū
               tries, to wit, The religion which Luther himſelfe had firſt begune, The religion of the Anabapſtiſts, The religiō of the Caluiniſts, The religion of the Loyiſtes, The religion of the family of loue, and the religion of the Georgiſts: of which ſix, for your more ſatiſfactiō
               
I will heere giue you (though briefly) ſome particuler relation.
            
               Martin Luther when he had made his reuolt from the Catholike Roman Church, fynding that there were ſome thinges taught, and obſerued in the ſame Church, that were thereto deſcended by ancient tradition, and alſo deduced from the ſcriptures, though not expreſſly therein mentioned, thought with himſelf that the only way for him to draw many diſciples after him, was, to proclayme in all his ſermons and writings, that we ought not to belieue or do nay thing concerning faith & religion, but that which was expreſſly comaunded and ſet downe in the written Word of God. By this deuyce in the beginning he found great applauſe, eſpecially among the vulgar ſort, into whoſe handes he had thruſt Bibles and Teſtaments tranſlated by himſelf into Dutche, to the beſt aduantage of his doctrine. But it was not long after that

ſome of theſe his diſciples grew ſo ſubtile, as to examine his doctrine by his owne rule, and to ſee if all that he had taught them were expreſſly to be found in the written Word of God. In which examination, they found that the Chriſtening of yonge children was not there to be found; and thereupon eſteeming the baptiſme of children to be of no force, they reuolted from him and rebaptized themſelues, and ſo began the ſect of the Anabaptiſts.
            After theſe, Andrew Carolostadius, one of the firſt and greateſt diſciples of Luther, who with him allowed the baptiſme of children, although not expreſſed in Scripture, began to diſſent frō 
               
                  〈◊〉
                in opiniō of the real preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, albeit expreſſed in Scripture; which opinion being imbraced by Zuinglius and others, and afterward p
                  ••
               liſhed by Iohn Caluin, left vnto his followers the name of Caluiniſts.
            The Loyists tooke their name of

one Lo
                     •
                  , by occupation a Slater, and a townſeman of Antwerp, who was ſo confident in his right vnderſtanding of Scripture by inward illumination from heauen, that being furniſhed of money by certayne rich Merchantes of that citty whom he had brought to be of his Sect, trauailed to Wittemberge to diſpute with Luther, and to conuert him to his religion: but Luther finding him ſo to interpret the Scripture as to deny the reſurrection of the dead, to hold that the ſoules of the good are immortal and do go to God, and that the ſoules of the euill do conſume away and come to nothing, and conſequently that there is neither Diuel, nor Hell, except the hell of this world, and the Men-diuels in it; Luther offered rather to diſpute with him with fiſtes, then with Scripture: wherupon Loy finding ſuch harſh entertaynment returned to Antwerp again, & left Luther vnconuerted. But hauing in Antwerp ſeduced and brought many to

be of his opinion, after he had recanted his doctrine and fallen to it againe, he was finally burnt.
            The family of Loue began by one Henry Nicholas a Mercer, or Seller of Silks, alſo of Antwerp, who held among other thinges, that man ought to be Deifyed in God, and God ho
                  •••
               fyed in man; and that men may haue their heauen firſt heer in this world by liuing in that deifyed loue they ought to do, and heereafter in Heauen alſo.
            The laſt of theſe ſix was the ſect of Dauid George a Glaſſe painter of Delft in Holland. This monſter ſecretly taught his diſciples, that in himſelfe was infuſed the ſoule of the true Meſſias and Sauiour of the World, that he was more then Elias, more then S.

            Theſe ſix ſects beginning now to grow and ſpread themſelues in ſundry parts of the Countrey, though ſome increaſed more then ſome, the Georgiſtes
               
keeping themſelues more ſecret then any of the others; there was now no remedy for the preſeruation of the ſubiects from ſo great confuſion in religion, as alſo from the dayly increaſe of more Sects, & the great inconueniences iuſtly feared thereby to ariſe, then by putting in practiſe the Placarts or Ordinances of the Emperour, being no other then conſonant vnto the ancient lawes of all other Countryes in Chriſtendome, as alſo for the preſeruation of the Oath which the Emperour, and his Son the King of Spayne had take in this Country, for maintenance of the ancient eſtabliſhed Religion and Clergy.
            Theſe lawes then being now begun to be put in execution, and diuers of thoſe that were of theſe Sects put to death, but of none more then of that of the Anabaptiſts; certain of the decayed Nobility aforeſayd, of which faction William of Naſſaw was the chiefe, ſeeing that all this made for them, & that ſomthing

muſt needes come of it, whereby they might fall to fiſhing in a troubled water, ſought by all meanes to get themſelues beloued of all theſe Sectes, that in the end they might benefite themſelues by that which moſt preuailed. Wherupon in the Moneth of April in the yeare of our Lord 1566. in the Towne of Bruxells they exhibited vnto the L

               . Margaret aforſaid a ſupplication, wherin they requyred a repeale or moderation of all rigorous Placartes, or Lawes made concerning Religion.
            Let now any man of reaſon or iudgment conſider of the lawfullnes of this demaund, and whether themſelues that demaunded it, could with good conſcience moue the ſame, the very mouing of the demaund it ſelfe plainely arguing little reſpect or conſcience in the demaunders, & declaring plainely, that the thing they ſought was for their owne endes; and that taking part at the laſt with that Sect which came

to domimere aboue the reſt, as in the end one muſt needes doe, they might ſticke thereunto, and ſo by flatte and open rebellion make vp their mouthes by the ouerthrowe of the ancient Clergy that was in poſſeſſion of good 
                  〈◊〉
                and huinges, to which all theſe new Sects did beare equal hatred, albeit ech or them did neuertheleſſe hate one another.
            This requeſt being as is aforeſayd preſented vnto the Lady Margaret in the moneth of April, ſhe promiſed them to ſend it into Spaine, and to require from thence, reſolution and anſwere t
                  •
               ereof. The requeſt ſhe ſent, but the anſwere they attended not, but gaue f
                  ••
               thwith ſuch hart and encouragment vnto the Sectaryes, that within few weeks after the requeſt was ſent away, they began to preach publikely in ſundry Townes and Cittyes, vpon a ſelfe aſſumed authority, euen in deſpite of all Lawes and Magiſtrates; and thereupon

fell to robbing and ſpoyling of Churches throughout al the Countrey.
            Vpon this the King of Spayne as a Prince moſt carefull of his Oath, and of the good of his ſubiects, was enforced to ſend into theſe Netherlands the Duke of Alua, to take vpon him the generall gouernment, which in ſo troubleſome a world was too great a charge to be menaged by a woman.
            This Duke ariuing in theſe partes in the moneth of Auguſt, in the yeare 1
                  •
               67. which was the yeare following; the Lady Margaret reſigned vnto him the gouernement, and departed out of the Countrey. The Duke now being placed in the gouernement, began to learne out, and informe himſelfe what perſons they were that had conſpired togeather in this buſines, and had giuen the onſet and countenance vnto theſe rebellious Sectaryes, and Sacrilegious Church-robbers; & finding the Earles of Egmont and Horne, and ſome other

Gentlemen to be culpable of this crime, they were apprehended, and beheaded in Bruxels But VVilliam of Naſſaw Prince of Orange, the chiefeſt Ring leader of this ſedition, ſo ſoone as he heard of the ariuall of the Duke, got him away into Germany, and by his flight declared himſelfe to be guilty, as by experience afterward it proued.
            Heere now it is to be conſidered, whether in the ſight and iudgement of the whole World, the King of Spaine had not all right and reaſon on his ſide, to vſe ſuch meanes as he did for the puniſhment of ſuch capitall offenders, and to imploy the ſubiects of one Countrey, for the chaſtiſement of the Rebells of another, when he had no other remedy. And whether any King or Prince liuing in the world, could in honour, or iuſtice winke at, & put vp ſuch great and capital crymes and inſolencyes committed by his ſubiects, as is a generall and publique ſacrilegious

Church-robbery, and the ſpoyling of the Clergy, for the preſeruation of whoſe priuiledges he had ſo ſolemnely taken his oath, and to ſuffer the dooers quietly to paſſe vnpuniſhed, & to let euery man openly profeſſe & follow ſuch new and neuer heard of doctrine, as his owne fancy ſhould inuent, or of his owne choice he ſhould beſt like; which euen thoſe themſelues that are at this day the ſucceſſours of theſe firſt rebells in ſome of theſe Netherlands, doe find ſo inconuenient, for gouernement, that notwithſtanding their firſt profeſſion, that euery man ought to haue his free exerciſe or Religion according to his owne conſcience, they do prohibite to ſuch, as they like not.
            The Duke of Alua hauing cauſed iuſtice to be executed, firſt vpon ſome of the principall conſpiratours, and after vpon other inferiour offenders, did at laſt in the yeare of our Lord 1570. by order from the King of Spaine, cauſe a

general pardon to be proclaimed, wherof if VVilliam of Naſſaw Prince of O
                     •
                  ange and his adherents had taken the offered benefite, all further troubles had ceaſed: but to the contrary they laboured, both by ſecret ſeditious preachers, as by other ſuch like agents to ſpread abroad that the King of Spayne had broken the Countrey priuiledges; as thogh the Countrey had had priuiledges that churches might forſooth be robbed, & no man called in queſtion for it, & that euery man might profeſſe what religion he liſted, were it neuer ſo naught, or new, the prohibiting whereof and the conſeruation of Eccleſiaſticall priuiledges, to which the King was ſworne, being the only cauſe, as to all the world was apparent, why the ſayd King was conſtrayned to ſend the Duke of Alua, and Spaniardes into the Countrey, which els had neuer beene thought of. So as the true blame which the King of Spayne hath deſerued, is not for breach

of priuileges, but for ſeeking to reſtore priuiledges which his diſobedient ſubiects had broken; the which if he had not done, then might he haue beene thought negligent and careleſſe of his Oath: but this, the equity of his conſcience would neuer permit.
            I am not ignorant that ſome fooles haue made other fooles belieue, that the King of Spayne at his departure out of theſe Netherlands, did promiſe euery ſeauen yeare to returne thither againe, and that the breach of his promiſe gaue cauſe ſufficient for theſe his ſubiects to rebell. This fooliſh allegation deſerneth no anſwere. Yet leaſt ſome wiſer people might be abuſed by fooles, I 
                  •
               ill leaue them to conſider, that there was no cauſe why his Maieſty ſhould bind himſelfe to any ſuch condition, his predeceſſors before him hauing beene free, and the Countrey comming vnto him by right of ſucceſſion, as it did to them: Experience hauing alſo ſhewed the inclination

of the people to rebellion, being grown proud by reaſon of their Wealth, and new-fangled alſo by reaſon of the choyce of Religions; in ſo much that the Duke of Alua ſaw it neceſſary to mayntayne certayne gariſons of ſoldiers in caſtles & conuenient fortifyed frontier places in the Countrey; which he made known vnto the King of Spayne, & ſent vnto him for prouiſion of money, becauſe he found the ſayd King vnwilling to haue his ſubiects of this Countrey burdened with any more taxations thereabout. But what ſucceſſe heereof enſued, ſhall appeare in the next Chapter.
         
         
            
            CHAP. II. How diſhonourable it was, for Queene Elizabeth of England, to take the Hollāders parts, against the King of Spayn: How ſhe oppreſſed, and impoueriſhed her ſubiects for their ſakes; and endangered her owne Crowne and Kingdome.
            
            BEFORE I begin to ſpeake of Queen Elizabeth of England her aſſiſting the rebelled ſubiects of Holland againſt the King of Spayne, it is not impertinent to the purpoſe, to call to mind whether there were any cauſe of emnity giuen vnto her by meanes of any wronges or iniuryes offred her by the King of Spayne, in former tyme, in regard wherof ſhe might now take the oportunity of reuenge.
            This King Philip the ſecond of Spayne hauing beene maryed in England to Queen Mary, was neuer known to

haue beene diſaffected to the Lady Elizabeth, for ſo was ſhe then called; but cōtrary wiſe did ſhew himſelf to be the greateſt freind

               e in briefe to declare, you muſt nore, that this Lady E

                and other places. M. Fox the Author of the Engliſh Proteſtant Martyrologe, wryting of this Ladies inpriſonment, declareth not any cauſe why; but becauſe he putteth her in his hiſtory of others that ſuffred for proteſtant religiō he intendeth to haue his reader imagine her to haue ſuffred ſome perſecutiō alſo for the ſame cauſe, whereby he thinketh not a little to honour her. But had her troubles beene for Religion indeed, Fox would then neuer haue omitted to ſet down her examinations about the

ſame, and her anſweres thereunto, in defence of ſome ſuch poin
                  •
               s as are in controuerſy betwen Catholiks & Proteſtan
                  •
               s; as about the real preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, or about prayer to Saints, or prayer for the Dead, or ſome one or other point, as wel as he hath ſet down, the examinations and anſweres of ſo many others, to their great glory, as he takes it: but heer is nothing found, Fox in this in ſilent, and leaues his reader to imagine of himſelf that it was for religiō. For ſomething it was, but that it was for religiō be could not make manifeſt, for that this Lady in al the tyme of the raigne or her ſiſter, dayly did heare Maſſe, went vſually to Confeſſion, and in all points ſhewed her ſelfe a Catholike; yea three weekes after ſhe was proclaymed Queene ſhe had Maſſe in her own Chappell in the Court, and permitted it to be ſayd in all Churches throughout the whole realme for the ſpace of ſeauen monethes after,

which is no ſigne of being ſo reſolue da Proteſtant as that ſhe would ſuffer impriſonment for that religion. Her troubles, in very deed, were for ſundry offences againſt Queene Mary her ſiſter; which being found to be ſuch, as might perhaps haue coſt her her life, if they had come vnto publique triall of Iuſtice; the King of Spayne was ſo greatly her freind that he ſtayed the proceeding thereof, and ſo not only ſaued her life, but quit her alſo from the publike blot and ſtayne of treaſon: and heerin he was ſo earneſt, that on a time, when ſhe was to haue come to her anſwere, he did ſo importune Queene Mary his wyfe, to let the matter paſſe in ſylence, that ſhe ſayd vnto him, My Lord, You ſpeake very earnestly now for her, but I pray God ſhe do not one day make you repent it. A certaine Spainſh Author wryteth that the King was therevnto alſo moued vpon ſome conſideration of ſtate: for Queen Mary of Scotland
               
being then maryed vnto the french king Francis the ſecond if the Lady Elizabeth had dyed, there had in apparence byn great poſſibility that the Kingdomes of England, Scotland and Ir
                     •
                  land might come to haue beene annexed vnto France, the ſayd Queene of Scotland being the next heyre in bloud vnto them all.
            Queene Mary of England at laſt hapning to dy, King Philip her huſband, notwithſtanding the caueat giuen him by his late deceaſed Queen, did ſo cō
               tinue his good affection vnto the now Queene Elizabeth, that being then in the Netherlands, he ſent ouer vnto her Monſieur de Aſſonuile, to congratulate her aduancement, and to ſignify his gift vnto her of all Queen Maries Iewells, which being his owne, he might iuſtly haue detayned vnto himſelfe, if he would. Theſe Iewells ſhe ſeemed very thankfully to receaue, and ſayd vnto this Monſieur de Aſſonuile, that ſhe

thought her brother the King of Spayne might thinke much in her for change of religion; but, quoth ſhe, there is but little difference betweene his religion and ours, almoſt all that he hath in Latin we haue in Engliſh: and we do not as others do, for we mayntayne a clergy of Biſhops and other Prelates, ſo vs we are in effect, as before.
            And whereas there was held a treaty of peace between the Spaniſh & French Kings vpon the taking of S. Quintins, the king of Spayn would yield vnto no agreement with the French, vnleſſe it were alſo conditioned that Callis ſhould be reſtored backe vnto Queen Elizabeth of England▪
                and heerin were his commiſſioners that treate
                  •
                with the French ſo earneſt, that in the end the french to be rid of their importunity were faygne to confeſſe vnto them, that they knew that they tooke more paynes then they were deſyred to do; for that the Engliſh had playnly

told them that they had not ſet them on work in any ſuch buſynes; which was a ſigne that they deſired not to be beholding vnto the king their maiſter. Of which whē the king had knowledg, he ſtood no more vpon the rendring of Callis, but concluded his peace with the french without it, which as thinges did afterward fall out, proued a happy turne to himſelf.
            Theſe proofes of this Kings good will vnto Queene Elizabeth being thus made manifeſt to the world, who would haue thought that ſhe would not only haue omitted all ſignes of gratitude, but within a litle after, become an enemy to ſuch a friend, yea and ſo great and capitall a one, as ſeldome any Hiſtory can giue witnes of the like.
            Seeing then that no acts of gratitude are to be ſought after; let vs then ſee what effectes of emnity enſued inſteed thereof. Firſt then to begin withall

(omitting her refuſall of the King of Spaynes kind endeauours for getting the French to reſtore vnto her the Towne of Callis) we will returne vnto the duke of Alua & his expected prouiſiō of money from Spayne, mentioned in the former Chapter. This prouiſion be

                  •
               ut this demand of his (cauſed chiefly thorough the ſaid Engliſh arreſt) was cauſe of a far greater detriment vnto the King of Spayne, then that wrongfully deta
                  •
               ned money came vnto: ſo as the one great wrong was the cauſe of another

far greater. For heereupon all the Netherland people began to mutter, to ſhew a generall vnwillingnes vnto the ſo wide ſtretching of their purſes; the ſediouſly affected took Occaſion by her Forelockes, and to the feare of this taxe added the faygned feare of the bringing in of a Spaniſh Inquiſition.
            One Monſieur de Lymmay, vnderſtanding by detayning of the K. of Spaynes money in England, what hatred that Queen began to beare him, poſteth out of France into

               urthen, it was deuiſed to draw the Duke of Alancon Brother vnto the French King Henry the third, into E

                  gland, vnder colour of treaty of a match betweene him and Queene Elizabeth: but in the end it proued an infortuna

                  •
               ring from thence into France with diſhonour, he

there not long after, dyed of griefe.
            In this deſignement, the Engliſh ſaw their expectation greatly deceaued. For albeit K. Henry the third of France had refuſed to take the Hollanders parts, hating them for that cauſe which no Kinges can loue ſuch people; yet they thought by getting his owne brother aforeſayd inueſted in the Duchy of Brabant, he muſt then of neceſſity take his part. But the matter now falling out otherwiſe, the burden returned and remayned heauyer vpon the Queene and Realme of England then before. And the Prince of Orange ſoon after the death of the Duke of Alan
                     •
                  on being ſlayne, the Hollāders remayned as a body without a head, vntill the Queen of England ſent ouer vnto them the Earle of Leycester, with great prouiſion both of men, and money, accompanyed with diuers Noblemen and Gentlemen of good accompt. And albeit this Earle afterward returned into England againe, yet continued

ſhe her ayding the Hollanders, both with men and money vnto her dying day. And it is thought by ſuch as haue made calculation of this great and long continued charge, that ſhe ſo oppreſſed and burthened her ſubiects for the Hollanders wars, that ſhe had more money from them by Graunts & Subſides, & ſuch other meanes, then had all the Kings of England from the tyme of the Conqueſt vnto her dayes, who had the greateſt warres with France. And I haue heard ſome Lawyers affirme, that ſhe did extremly wrong her poore Subiects, by ſometymes preſſing them, and ſending them perforce to her ſeruice out of the Realme; ſeeing, as they ſay, no Prince by the Lawes of the Realme can compell any of his ſubiectes to ſerue in warre, vnles it be for the defence of the Realme at home▪ or for the recouery of ſome loſt Patrimony of the Crowne abroad; & ſeeing now that Holland was neuer knowne to haue beene any part

of the patrimony of the Crowne of England, nor any pretence of iuſt war could be made by England to that end, it was the greater wrong and iniuſtice.
            And heere by the way I muſt alſo note vnto you, that at the beginning, for a long time of her ayding the Holland
                     •
                  rs, though ſhe did diſguiſedly make ſhew of friendſhip & amity with Spayn, and had not only her Embaſſadour in Spayne, as the King of Spayne had his alſo in England; and in all her publike Proclamations, wherein any mention happened to be made of Holland and the adiacent partes, ſhe did alwayes call them, The Low Countreyes of her louing Brother the King of Spayne, & therby acknowledged that which ſhe could not deny: yet euen at this very time ſhe imployed Syr Francis Drake to robbe him of his treaſure in the Weſt Indyes, Don Bernardino de Mendoca remayning Ambaſſadour Ledger for the King of Spayne in England, both then and long

after, yea euen at the very tyme when Drak was arriued home with his booty, (which was in Nouember in the yeare 1580.) and being all this while an eye witneſſe not only of the ſayd Queenes oppreſſing and impoueriſhing her own ſubiects at home, for the ayding of the foreſayd Hollanders abroad, & rebellious ſubiectes of the King his Maiſter; but of her ſending forth alſo to robbe him, in his owne dominions, therby to ayde them vnlawfully with their Lords own treaſure.
            If now from the firſt to the laſt, the deportement of the Queene of England towards the King of Spayne in the long continuance of ſo many great wronges and iniuryes, be but indifferently conſidered; what man, though but of meane capacity can iudge, but in the end, he muſt needes be prouoked to do ſomething againſt her, were it but in regard of Honour, he being a King ſo great and potent. And therefore it

was no wonder, that after ſo many former yeares patience, he was in the end (and that alſo with an addition of eight yeares forbearance) after the taking of his aforſayd treaſure (in which tyme al detriments that could be done him, both by Sea & Land, beſides the ayding alſo of Don Antonio (the pretended King of Portugall) being put in practiſe) forced to prepare that great Armada againſt Englād by ſea, which he did in the yeare 1588. though with no ſucceſſe. And therefore, as I haue heard Strangers that are indifferent to both Nations, wonder very much, why there ſhould be more hatred diſcouered now in a tyme of peace and amity, betweene England and Spayne, in the Engliſh Natiō to the Spaniſh, then in the Spaniſh to the Engliſh (the English hauing giuen more cauſe a great deale for Spaniardes to hate them, then the Spainards haue giuen to Englishmen:) So haue they likewiſe noted, that notwithſtanding

the miſuſage in England of the Spanish Ambaſſadour himſelfe in his own perſon; yet the Spaniſh in Spayne doe not for all this miſuſe the Ambaſſadour of England; the cauſe whereof is the diſcreet conſideration of the Spaniſh Nation, who can diſcerne this miſuſage to proceed from ſuch pure-ſtrayned Miniſters, as are poſſeſſed with the fury of the ſpirit, or from the common debauſhed people, that doe not conſider, or haue not ſo much wit, as to think when they ſee a Spaniſh Ambaſſadour in England, that his Maieſty likewiſe hath an Engliſh Ambaſſadour in Spayne: Nor yet to ſet before their eyes the example of the carriage of the chiefe Nobility, and of the better and wiſer ſort towardes the ſayd Ambaſſadour and Nation; nor chiefly and aboue all his Maieſtyes amity & friendship with the King of Spayne, and the feare of his indignation and punishment due vnto ſuch barbarous inſolencyes.
         
         
            
            CHAP. III. Whether England hath receaued any benefite by defending the quarrell of the Hollanders; or whether the Hollanders haue endeauoured to deſerue the friendſhip they haue receaued frō thence, or haue any way ſhewed themſelues gratefull for it.
            
            TO examine and ſearch out the benefits which England may haue receaued by meanes of the Hollanders, I know not whereor which way to begin. The Hollanders, or their friends may perhaps ſay, that it was a benefit great inough for the Engliſh to aſſiſt them, in reaſon of ſtate, becauſe thereby they kept out warre from their own Country. But what an excuſe this is? when as the Engliſh neuer needed to haue feared warre in their own country, but for their cauſe, and for taking

their partes: for it was for their cauſe that the Engliſh ſeized vpon the ſix hundred thouſand ducates which were ſent out of Spayne to the Duke of Alua; which was a capital cauſe of enmity, and indeed the only cauſe that enforced the ſayd Duke to demand the tenth penny of the peoples goods, whereby the whole common multitude became diſpoſed the ſooner to rebellion. For the king of Spaynes money, was not detayned by the Engliſh vpon any couetous deſire to haue it for themſelues, but becauſe the Duke Alua ſhould not haue it to employ againſt the Hollanders, and that it might be tranſported from England vnto the Hollanders, & ſo come to be vſed by them againſt the ſayd Duke, to whom it was ſent to haue byn imployed againſt them for their Rebellion.
            But it may be further alleaged in

excuſe of the Hollanders, that they were ſo gratefull, as they offred vnto the Queen of England the Soueraignty of the Netherlandes, which benefit ſhe would not accept of, and therefore it was not their fault that if ſhe obtayned it not. To this may be ſayd, that the Diuel offred to haue giuen Chriſt all the kingdoms of the world if he would haue worſhipped him, and ſo was more liberall of giuing that which was none of his own, then were the Hollanders. But the Queen well knowing that by accepting this guift whereunto they had no right, ſhe ſhould haue been ſure to haue drawn a perpetual warre, and the whole charge thereof vpon her ſhoulders, and therefore refuſed this their liberality; yet was ſhe willing notwithſtanding to ayde them, without this obligation. And the reaſon was; becauſe ſhe ſtill retayned a hop to be wholy diſburdned, or at leaſt much holpen in the bearing this charge

by France, or Germany, or by bringing the Hollanders to the full poſſeſſion of the whole ſeuenteen Prouinces, wherby they might depend vpon themſelues.
            It may alſo be alleaged, that ſhe had the Cautionary Townes of Briel, Fluſhing & the other places, deliuered into her handes. True it is, ſhe had ſo, and thereby enioyed the benefit of being at more expence both of men and money. Other benefits can I remember none; nor can there be any found, & ſo will ſpare the labor to look any further after them: yet becauſe ill turnes, and domages may more readily be diſcouered to haue heereby happened to the Queene and ſtate of England, I ſhall ſet downe what in this kind I haue obſerued.
            Firſt then to begin with the afore mentioned Cautionary Townes, it appeareth, that becauſe the Hollanders would ſo ſoone as they could, be the

freer to ſet the Engliſh at naught, hauing by meanes of the Truce with the King of Spayne, and the Archduke Albert, gotten togeather ſome ſpared money; they ſo laboured with their feed freind Sir Raph Winwood (a better Hollander then an Engliſhman) that for paltry payment they got their brydle out of the Engliſh handes, and thereupō began ſtraightwayes to ſhew their gratitude in forbidding the bringing of Engliſh dyed, and dreſſed clothes into Holland, and their adioyned Prouinces, without euer making the king or his Ambaſſador Ledger at the Hage priuy thereunto.
            Soon after, to make amendes for this their ſaucy and vnmannerly carriage, they came to offer the Kings Maieſty himſelf a more inſolent affront. For whereas the Duke of Lennox, as Admirall of Scotland, by order from the King, had ſent one M. Brown in the yeare 1616. to demaund of the ſaid

               Hollanders, then fiſhing vpon the coaſt of Scotland, a certayne ancient duty, called Size herring; with much a do they payd it, as in former tymes it was accuſtomed; but yet withſome ſpeaches that it was the laſt tyme, that it ſhould be payed.
            The ſame M. Browne cōming the yeare following with the ſame authority and commaundement, with one ſhip of the Kinges only to demaund the duty afo
                  •
               eſayd, and with order, that if it were denyed, he ſhould take witnes of the refuſal in writing, and ſo peaceably depart; being come aboard one of their ſhips, and demanding the aforeſayd duty, he was by the Maiſter therof denyed it, who told him playnly that he was commaunded by the States of Holland not to pay it vnto the King any more, of which he tooke witnes according to his order from his Maieſty.
            Whyles this was a doing, there

comes aboard that ſhip, the Maiſter of of another ſhip of Holland, & demaunding of M. Brown his name, he replyed that his name was Browne: Why then (quoth he) if you be the man, I haue order to arreſt you, and to carry you into Holland: whereof M. Brown gaue notice to the Maiſter of the Kings ſhip, requyring him to aduertiſe his Maieſty of this inſolency, and ſo M. Brown was areſted and carryed away priſoner into Holland.
            
            About this tyme, as I alſo haue heard it credibly reported, one M. Archibald Rantkin a Scottiſh gentleman reſiding at Stockholme in Sweden, & there ſoliciting for the payment of certayne money due vnto ſome Londō
                Merchāts; one Van▪ dyke lying there alſo as Agent for the States of Holland, ſayd vnto ſome principal perſons of the Swedians, that they needed not be to haſty in paying the king of Englands ſubiects any money, or to giue them any reſpect, for that

the ſayd Kinges promiſes, were not to be belieued, nor his threates to be feared. For which villanous and inſolent ſpeaches, being afterward challenged by Rantkin, he had no better excuſe then to ſay, he was drunke when he ſpake them (for deny them he could not) and ſo his excuſe of playing the beaſt, excuſed him for playing the man.
            But now from theſe inſolent affronts and ſpeaches, let vs come to deeds, and ſee how they haue vſed our Engliſh Nation in the North ſeas, on the coaſt of Groonland & thoſe partes, about the trayn-oyle fiſhing, where they haue offred them ſundry abuſes by giuing them blowes, chaſing them away, and doing vnto them diuers oth
                  ••
                detriments; not admitting to vnderſtand that the ſea fiſhing is free for euery man, where it is not vpon the coaſt of any Countrey, vnto which the benefit belongeth by ancient prerogatiue.
            And yet is all this but little in regard

of their vſage of our Nation in the Eaſt Indyes, wher they haue as fiercely ſet vpon them with open hoſtility, as if before their meeting there, they had of long continuance beene mortall enemyes, hauing ſlaine many of our men, and ſunke ſundry of our ſhipps. And when moreouer they haue taken ſome of our men priſoners, they haue vſed them, in the ſight of the Indians, in ſuch contemptible and diſdainefull manner, as if at home in their owne Countryes, the Engliſh in reſpect of them were but an abiect and a ſlauiſh Nation; and that the Hollanders were either their Superiours, & might vſe them at their pleaſure, or the Engliſh ſo baſe and vnpowerfull, as they durſt not be reuenged, but quietly put vp any iniury at their handes.
            And indeed the Indians might in reaſon coniecture that the Hollanders would neuer haue dared ſo to domineer ouer the Engliſh abroad, if they had not

had the maiſtery of them at home; after which accounpt & reckoning ſuch actions abroad are wont to be looked into. What thinke you now of our Engliſh Prouerbe? Haue we not brauely ſet beggers on horſbacke? Nay haue not Engliſhmen (the premiſes conſidered) great reaſon to loue the Hollanders, and to hate Spaniards? Yea, and to hate Spaniards only for the loue of ſuch courteous & gratefull Hollanders?
            And as for the commodious trade which the Engliſh haue had in Muſcouy for more then threeſcore and ten years, and which the Hollanders haue now quite gotten from the
                  ••
               , and ſpoyled, what ſhall I ſay? Seeing they are about to make recompence for the ſame by doing the like with our Engliſh Merchants in Turky. And it is a thing ſo naturall & notorious for them to ſpoile the trade of other Nations, that when they cannot find occaſion to do it, they will not ſticke to ſpoile one another, ſo

great is their auaricious and inſatiable deſire of gayne; and yet all this proceedeth but out of a certain couetous wretchednes; for, let any of them arriue to what riches he will, he knoweth not how to be Noble or Generous.
         
         
            CHAP. IIII. Whether England can expect any benefite by continuing to take the Hollanders parts; and whether the Hollanders doe deſerue the ſame, by wishing, or deſiring the continuance of the State and Gouernement of England, as now it ſtandeth.
            
            THE end and ſcope whereunto the rebellious wars of the Hollanders haue tended, hath beene to bring themſelues into as free and qu
                  •
               et a State as is the Republique of the Switzers, which they might haue eaſily done by the help they haue had from England & France, if the King of Spayne had wanted

the meanes or the will to haue continued warre againſt them. But admit they had arriued vnto this their deſigne and had freely and quietly gotten the full poſſeſſion of all the ſeauenteene Netherland Prouinces, is it not like that they would then haue gotten into their clawes the Duchyes of Cleue, & Iuliers, with the other parts theron dependant, ſeeing they haue already gotten fotting therin? And hauing once incorporated theſe, is it like, that they would haue ſuffered the Countrey of Liege to haue remained in quiet, vnder the Rule of a Biſhop? When as the colour of reformation of Religion had alſo beene ſufficient for the taking away of the Countrey from the true owner? Or may a man thinke, that they would ſtand vpon titles of right, who hold not the leaſt place they poſſeſſe by any right at all? Or that they would make a conſcience to detayne from their Neighbour, when they make none to detayne from

their true Lord, and Maiſter? Surely there is no reaſon to think other wayes: and yet if any man ſhould, let him but looke into their attempt vpon Huys, & alſo vpon Liege the principall Citty of that Countrey, not long ſince put in practiſe.
            Put the caſe then, that they had arriued vnto their deſired greatnes, that is to ſay, to haue gotten the whole ſeauenteene Netherland Prouinces with the Duchyes of Cleue and Iuliers, & the reſt thereunto dependant, as alſo the Countrey of Liege; how would they thē haue borne themſelues towards England and France? How had they then beene able to haue giuen law to both theſe kingdomes; to the one by land, from the Countrey of Liege cōfining vpon it, and to the other by ſea, by being able to ouertop it in ſhipping? what doubt may be made heereof, conſidering what a correſpondent party they would haue found in France by their moſt confident

friends the Huguenots, and in England by no leſſe friendes the Puritans? Who cannot now diſcerne that the King of Spayne, by continuance of war againſt the Hollanders, hath highly benefited both England and France; and that England and France by aſſiſting the Hollanders againſt the King of Spayne, haue laboured to their owne coſt.
            What policy might it then haue proued for England and France, if the Hollanders had by their help preuayled againſt the King of Spayne, when they ſhould therby haue prepared an irremediable ſcourge for themſelues.
            Let it then be truely conſidered, whether it had not been greater policy, more honorable, & more profitable, for both thoſe Nations, and more for the tranquility of Chriſtendome, that they had ſuffred the King of Spayne to haue brought theſe his rebellious ſubiects to obedience, and ſo to haue gouerned them in peace, to the end he might haue

imployed ſo many millions, as he hath beene forced to ſpend in the Netherlād warres, againſt the Turke. And that ſo he would haue done, if he might heere haue inioyed reſt and quiet, who can doubt? Seeing notwithſtanding theſe his long wars, and all other wars therby occaſioned, both by ſea and land, he hath, to his euerlaſting prayſe and honour, neuer made either peace or Truce with that capitall enemy of Chriſtendome. And if thoſe forſayd many millions might haue bin implo
                  •
               ed againſt this common enemy, who can make doubt, but he might thereby not only haue beene driuen out of Europe, but that Hieruſalem, and all Palestine might haue beene recouered?
            
               England, as hath beene ſayd in the precedent Chapter, hath already receaued proofe of the ingratitude of her coſtly Holland friends; and France no leſſe, by hauing not long ſince diſcouered them to be more ready to take their

partes that were in armes againſt the now regnant King, then the Kinges part againſt them. And if they had been ſo wary as to haue diſſembled ſom what longer their ingratitude & inſolencyes towards England and France, yet their audacious brauing of the King of Denmark (notwithſtanding they muſt paſſe with all their corne from Danske throgh his Sownd) were inough to haue diſcouered their proud contempt of the maieſty of Kinges; and what Neighbours they would haue proued to England & France, when they ſhould haue arriued to their expected freedome of an abſolute Republike. Let it then be conſidered, whether England or France, could euer feare to be ſo much endomaged by Spayne, as by them; or that Spayne could haue ſo ready meanes to endomage thē, as the Hollanders; or could haue correſpondence in either Countrey with two ſuch turbulent factions.
            Thus may England as well by example

of the Hollanders ingratitude to France, as by the deere purchaſed experience in it ſelfe, cleerely behould what apparence there may be of expectation of any leaſt benefite by their meanes; ſince none can be found, none be looked for, albeit they were ſought after with the lanterne of Diogenes.
            
            If therefore no benefits can appeare, either paſt or to be expected, let vs then ſee what good fortune hath otherwiſe betyded ſuch as haue beene the greteſt actors in this rebellious buſines, whereby it may appeare to the World, how their endeauours haue beene pleaſing to God.
            The firſt man that began the ſurprize and open rebellion of Townes in Holland, was the aforenamed Monſieur de Lymmay. This man amongſt other preſents which were giuen him, when he was in England, one was a very faire great maſtiffe Dog, which he much eſteemed; and on a tyme playing with

him, he bitte him ſo ſoare in the arme, that he could by no meanes be cured, but in the end dyed thereof, ſtarcke mad, and raging, in the Towne of Liege. And thus came he to his death by being bitten of a Dog, that had beene a wolfe vnto many Eccleſiaſticall perſons, whoſe bloud without all forme of luſtice, or any offence by them committed, he had cauſed to be ſhed, aſwell in the Towne of Briel which he ſurpryzed, as in other places.
            The next great Actor in this ill buſynes was the Duke of Alancon alſo before mentioned. This Duke after he had in the Citty of Antwerp beene inueſted in the Duchy of Brabant, as abſolute Soueraigne; fynding not withſtanding that he was to be limitted & gouerned by ſuch as he accompted his ſubiects; & ſeeking thereupon to make his authority more abſolute, drew certayne troopes of his ſouldiers into the Town to haue ſurpryzed it, himſelf being

with his whole army hard without, who, through the reſiſtance of the Towneſmen, were all put to the ſword. Whereupon he with his whole army (the Artillery from the walles of the Towne playing vpon him) was forced to retyre thence in extreme diſgrace, and melancholy, as a defeated enemy; and in the end to returne into France, where conſidering the tricks that had by n put vpon him in England, and what diſgrace he had therby receaued in Flanders, on the 10. day of Iune in the yeare 1584. he dyed of conceaued griefe, in the town of Chaſtea
                     •
                   Theiry, and ſo loſt his faire poſſibility of wearing the crown of France, vnto which he was the apparent Heyre.
            The next and chiefeſt ſtyrrer in this buſynes, was William of Naſſaw, Prince of Orāge, who becauſe he was the Archrebell, or principall Actor in this great rebellion of all other, I hold it not vnfit, before I come to ſpeak of his death,

briefly to run ouer the thinges of moſt note in his life.
            This Prince, as in the firſt Chapter hath byn ſayd, retyred himſelf into Germany ſo ſoone as he heard of the Duk
                  •
                of Alua his aryuall in the Netherlandes; and albeit he came afterwards backe agayne to puſh forward his begun rebellion; yet was he fayne to fly the ſecond tyme into Germany, from whence when he heard that the Town of Briel, and one or two more were openly rebelled, he came ſecretly backe into Holland, and being in very poore and bare eſtate, he took vp his lodging in the Town of Tergow, in the howſe of one Kegeling an Apothecary, keeping himſelfe very ſecret, becauſe this town as yet held for the king of Spayn, as alſo did all the other Townes of the Country except two or three. But the Duke of Alua his demaunding the tenth penny aforeſayd, hauing bred a generall diſguſt and auerſion in the myndes of

the people; certayne ſcouts of rebellion were ſecretly imployed abroad in the Country to ſound the people about their forwardnes to reuolt. Which being done, anſwere was returned that they were found to be the
                  •
               unto ready inough, ſo they might haue a head, but who this head ſhould be, that knew they not. The Prince of Orange heerupō, in whoſe behalfe theſe ſcouts had beene imployed, called a conſultation of ſome fyue or ſix irreligicus Politikes (for ſuch beſt fitted to be his counſellours) to conſider what religion he were beſt to be of, for of all the religions now currant he could not be; and not declaring himſelf to be of one, all might hold him to be of none. For he had ſo caryed himſelf vntil this day, that the Catholikes held him affected to them; The Lutherans to them; The Anabaptiſts to them; And the Caluiniſts alſo to them.
            The Catholikes tooke him for

their freind, becauſe they thought him not to hate their religion, but indifferently well to affect it, in regard that he had beene brought vp in it, long profeſſed it, and had made as yet no open oppoſition or profeſſion againſt it; and for that he proteſted to vndergo this buſynes for the mayntayning of their rightes and priuiledges, and to free the Countrey from that terrible exaction of the tenth penny aforeſayd.
            The Lutherans tooke him for their frend, becauſe they held him in hart to be of their religion, ſince he had maryed the daughter of the Duke of Saxony, who was now a Lutheran, in publique profeſſion; and that he muſt in reaſon keep good correſpondence with the Lutherans of Germany, in hope of hauing ayde from them.
            The Anabaptiſts tooke him as greatly to fauor their religion, becauſe his Chamberlayne being the chiefeſt man about him, was an Anabaptiſt,

(called of his fellow Anabaptiſts by the name of Mardochaeus) by whoſe meanes this Prince became greatly beholding vnto them, for the loane of ſundry good ſummes of money, which he had receaued of them.
            The Caluiniſts thought him aſſuredly their friend, becauſe he was an enemy vnto Spayne & Spaniards, and becauſe he could not but ſee them more forward in action of Rebellion, then any of the others; ſeeing Briel and other Townes were already ſurpryzed by thoſe of their Nation and Religion.
            The aforeſayd Counſelours conſidering that this indifferent carriage of the Prince, could but argue a diſperſed affection, & might breed many iealouſies and factions, and wherby he could not procure to himſelfe the aſſured affection of any one ſyde to ſticke faſt vnto him; their reſolution muſt now be taken without longer delay, of which of theſe he would declare himſelf abſotely

to be, albeit he might promiſe fauour and protection to the reſt. There was no great need of learned Deuins to diſpute the matter, Scriptures and ancient Fathers were not important to be looked after, Faith and Conſcience had heerin no clayme, and Reaſon of State did put the Holy Ghoſt to ſilence.
            It was therfore firſt debated whether it were beſt & moſt for this Prince his aduantage to declare himſelfe a Catholike, becauſe the face of the State was yet Catholike. To this was alleaged, that if he ſhould ſo do by fauouring all oppoſite to the Catholikes, the Catholikes would therfore diſfauour him, ſeeing the other through his fauour would inſult vpon them: and ſo might there be danger of their returning to the obedience of the King of Spayne, whom thev were ſure was of their religion, and would mayntayne them in it. All which conſidered, it was not thought fitting for him to declare

himſelf to be a Catholike
            To declare himſelf a Lutheran, was alſo thought vnſit, becauſe the Duke of Saxony, albeit a Lutheran, was yet a freind vnto the Emperour, and the howſe of Auſtria; and beſides the Lutherans were but flegmatike & cold fellowes, and too farre offto giue him aſſiſtance, if need ſhould require.
            To declare himſelfe an Anabaptiſt, was held leſſe fitting, for albeit they had ſhewed more heat of zeale, in their greater number that had ſuffred for their religion, then any of the others; yet were they but of the meaner ſort of people, not hauing any potent perſons among them, nor any forrayne Prince or State to take their partes.
            In fine it was reſolued that it was moſt conuenient for him to declare himſelf a Caluiniſt, in regard of their ſtirring ſpirits, whereof they had giuen greater proof then any of the others, & that there was apparence of aſſiſtance

from England, and of good correſpondence with the Huguenots of France. Vpon this reſolution, followed ſtraight-wayes the conuerſion of this Prince of Orange vnto Caluinian-Proteſtant religion; and his new gayned greateſt friendes ſo beſtirred themſelues, that Town vpon Town rebelled eſpecially after he had by ſolemne Oath ſworne to mayntayne the Catholike Clergy in all their rights and priuiledges, and in publike exerciſe of their Religion▪ about which point yet the town of Amsterdam amongſt others, very precyſely capitulated with him, and he very ſeriouſly alſo proteſted and ſwore performance of the conditions: which Oath notwithſtanding he made no more conſcience ſoone after to breake, then he had done ſundry oathes before; as the great and ſolemne Oath which he tooke of Fidelity to the King of Spayne, when he receaued the Order of Knight-hood of the golden Fleece; the Oath of fidelity,

which he alſo tooke at the ſayd Kings making him Lieftenant Gouernour of Holland &c. beſydes his ſundry other perfidious breaches both of oaths and promiſes.
            And becauſe there is not any fidelity or honeſt dealing to be expected, where there is layd no ground of Religion and vertue it is the leſſe wonder that this irreligious Noble Man ſo caryed himſelf in choyce of religion. Certayne it is, that he was at the firſt a Catholike; and notwithſtanding that his malice had tranſported him ſo farre, as to protect and ſhelter ſome moſt ſacrylegious Church-robbers; yet vpon the aryuall of the Duke of Alua, and before his flight into Germany, he ſent for his eldeſt ſome Philip (who was Prince of Orange next after him) at that tyme a ſtudent in the Vniuerſity of Louayne, and moſt ſtraightly charged him, to liue and dye in the Catholike Roman Religion, as the ſayd Prince hath at ſundry

tymes to diuers perſons yet lyuing proteſted; wherby it may ſeem, that at that tyme he had yet retayned ſome regard of religion; and holding that for the beſt, commaunded his ſonne to remayne ſtill therin.
            Foure wyues he had, the firſt was a Catholyke, the ſecond was a Lutheran, the third and fourth were Caluiniſts; which perchance was becauſe he found no noble woman fit for him to match withall that was an Anabaptiſt, that ſo he might haue had foure wyues of foure ſeuerall Religions; yet to ſhew his great good wil vnto the Anabaptiſts (albeit he could not match amongſt them) he gaue them vnder his hand wryting the priuiledge & freedome for exerciſe of their religion in their own howſes, which they yet in Holland enioy.
            When I conſider the life and actiōs of this man, I wonder in my ſelf, that the blyndnes of the popular multitude,

could be ſo great, as to honor and extol him ſo highly, and to accompt him the great Patron and Protectour of their Country, that was the greateſt enemy therof that euer it had; and who was the cauſe of ſpilling ſo much bloud, aſwell of the people of his owne Country, as of other Nations; and ſuch an one as was the betrayer, & tranſporter alſo thereof, vnto another Nation, as much as in him lay, who had no right or clay me thereunto.
            To come now to touch the end of this man, when I cōſider, I ſay, what it was, there commeth to my remembrance this ſaying of a Pagan Poet:

                  Tyraennous Lords, that cauſe Landes to rebell,
                  VVithout ſome blow, can hardly come to Hell.
               
            
            About ſome foure yeares before the death of this Prince, he was for his offences depriued by the ſayd King of Spayne his ſoueraigne Lord, of all the authority and power which in former tymes the ſayd King had giuen him, &

proclaymed for a publike enemy vnto the King, the peace, and Weal-publike of the Countrey; and his goods & perſon expoſed to open violence by publique ſentence. In the end after ſome attempts to that effect, the Prince perceauing, what victorious ſucceſſe the Duke of Parma (that then vnder the King of Spayne commanded in the Netherlands) now began to haue in Flaunders, and Brabant, he fled ſecretly, from Antwerp (where he had layne lurcking for a time) vnto Delft in Holland, in his Armour; for it was the greateſt prayſe (forſooth) that this valiant Captayne atchieued in theſe warres, that he did commonly put on his Armour when he was eight or ten leagues from any place of danger.
            Being arriued at Delft, where he thought himſelfe in greateſt ſafety, he was vpon the tenth day of Iuly in the ſame yeare 1584. ſlayne with the ſhot of a Piſtoll, by one Ealtazar Gerard (aliâs

               Serach) a Burgundian, of the age of fiue and twenty yeares, a moneth after that the Duke of Alancon dyed at Chasteau-Theiry; for the Duke dyed on the tenth of Iune, & this Prince was ſlayne on the tenth of Iuly next following, as though his life had beene limitted by leaſe, to laſt but iuſt one moneth after the death of the other.
            The next of the greateſt Actors in this rebellious Tragedy, was Robert Dudley Earle of 
                  
                     •
                  eyceſter, who after he had beene the chiefe Commaunder of Holland, in theſe broyles (in which wa
                  •
                ſlaine his ſiſters Sonne Syr Philip Sidney, a Knight worthy to haue deſerued more Honour, if he had ſerued in an honourable cauſe) he grew weary of the Hollanders, and they of him; in ſo much, that by a iuſtification of his worthleſſe actions publiſhed in Print, he was driuen to accuſe & blame them of breach of promiſe and performance of couenants made vnto him, that ſo

by laying the fault vpon thē, he might repaire his owne reputation, and excuſe of gayning ſo little honour among them as he had. Returning therefore with great diſcontentment into England, he ſoone after ſickned and dyed, and as it is reported was poyſoned, and preuented by one whome himſelfe had thought by ſuch a meanes to haue made away.
            He dyed without any ſigne of a Chriſtian; and being dead ſeemed ſo vgly a corſe, as euen amazed the beholders. His body was opened and in his ſtomake were great holes eaten through with the poyſon. His Landes were all preſently ſeized on for his debts to the Queene, whereby he was now, as much diſgraced being dead, as he would perhaps haue beene, if he had liued but a little longer; and as his life was not much laudable, ſo was his death not greatly lamented.
            The next in this 
                  •

Queene Elizabeth her ſelfe, by whoſe meanes, as this rebellion at the firſt began, ſo was it by her ayd (euen to her laſt end) continued. And if a happy death be the true happynes of the precedent life, ſhe cannot be ſayd to haue had it, neither in regard of the good of her ſelfe, nor yet of her ſubiects; for ſhe ſought not the one, and ſhe had not the other. She ſought not the good of her ſubiects, which in all reaſon and right ſhe was bound to do, both before God mā, becauſe ſhe prohibited both ſpeach, and euen the knowledge as it were, of any ſucceſſor to her Crowne, as all the world well knoweth. In ſo much, that if ſome of the Nobility, preſently vpon her death, had not reſolued to receaue vnto her Crowne & dignity the true & lawfull Heyre that now raigneth, the bloud of many thouſandes of her ſubiects might haue beene ſpilt, for ought ſhe did to preuent it. Some do report her to haue ſayd, that whyles ſhe liued no

            That her death was not happy, appeareth, in that it is no happynes to dye diſtracted, and not to haue had, from the beginning to the end of her ſicknes, the perfect vſe of reaſon, and conſequently not to haue beene able moſt earneſtly to call vpon God; which as it is moſt fit that at their end, a

            Let vs now laſtly come vnto the

great Stateſman, and Menager of this State compoſed of States, the Holland-aduocate Berneuelt. This man after the death of the Prince of O

               leage that the Archduke Matthias, who afterward came to be Emperor, had beene a chief Commaunder and gouernour alſo ouer this rebellious faction, and yet came not to any vnfortunate end. To this I anſwere, that true it is, this Prince had ſuch a charge layed vpon him, when by reaſon of his youth he wanted iudgment perfectl
                  •
                to deſcern what he did, William of Naſſaw the vnhappy Prince of Orange before mentioned, being his chief Lieftenant vnder him, and the only man that diſpoſed of al. And yet eſcaped this yong Archduk not without diſgrace among thē, when they neither cared for him, nor much reſpected him; & in their ordinary ſpeaches gaue him the name of their Foster chyld, eſteeming him but as a chyld, or as a cipher that only ſerued

to ſupply a place. But in the end this noble Prince diſcouering their vniuſt courſes & his own errour, left thē, and gaue ouer that miſtaken gouernment, and retyring himſelfe into Germany, ſought, and found meanes to reconcile himſelf vnto his Couſin the King of Spayne, whoſe grace and fauour he obtayned, which none of the former that came to vnfortunate endes, euer ſought for. And by this meanes all former ſoars were ſalued, & this Prince by leauing to follow this wrong courſe, was not only freed from comming to an vnfortunate or diſgracefull end, but came to dy as a good Chriſtian Prince, and in the moſt high eſtate of an Emperour.
            Thus haue I heere briefly related vnto you, how ill they haue ſped, who haue beene the chiefeſt Actors in ſo ill a buſines as is rebellion, & the aſſiſting of rebels againſt their moſt iuſt and lawfull Soueraigne; what may ſucceed

to others, that do, or intend to continue the ſame vniuſt courſe, muſt be reſerued to the manifeſtation of tyme; but apparent it is, by that which heere hath been ſhewed, that the moſt high and ſupreme Ruler of all, hath, by permitting theſe their diſgracefull endes, ſhewed his diſlike of their actions; & contrarywiſe to ſuch as haue beene obedient to his will, his benediction hath been manifeſt in a copious manner.
            The benefits then which England might expect by continuing to take the Hollanders partes, muſt be vnderſtood to be, endles Charges, great Diſhonour, and the high Diſpleaſure of Almighty God, togeather with the Hollanders recompenſing the ſame with contemptuous ingratitude; which are motiues to mooue mad men to be their friendes.
            Some may perhaps ſuppoſe the Hollanders to deſerue the ſame in regard of a kind of loue and affection which they beare vnto that State, albeit no effect

or ſhew of good deeds to proue it, doth anv way breake out. This inuiſible affection, muſt then be imagined to conſiſt in a true deſire they haue to the countiuuance of the preſent State & Gouernement as now it ſtandeth. Les vs then ſee how likely it is, by firſt of al calling into conſideration the affection they manifeſt themſelues to beare vnto our Kings Maieſty of England; for this ought to giue the firſt and beſt light vnto this great obſcurity.
            Surely, if I ſhould relate vnto you what myne owne eares haue heard in this point, you would ſtand amazed. Reſpect of conſcience and duty, doth not permit me to repeate thoſe moſt odious Epithets which without any r

enemy. Their wordes, as I ſayd, I will not repeate, for feare leaſt an alleadger of the calumnyes of others, might be taken for a ſubtil calumniator himſelfe: but if you doubt of the truth heerof, make further enquiry of ſuch, as ſince the late famous battaile fought in Bohemia, haue come out of Holland into England; for there want no witneſſes to affirme this to be true. And if you ſhall chance to meet with One who for affection to the Hollanders, will rather diſſemble then confeſſe the truth, eſpecially being demaunded therof in Englād; I doubt not but you wil meet with Two, who will affirme it, and withall confeſſe that there is not any remedy to

them, be content that the common ſort doe ſpeake that which themſelues alſo thinke, and in priuate ſpeake the ſame, as well as they, ſeeing in publike they ſhew no diſlike therof.

            CHAP. V. Of the preſent state of the Hollanders; and of the diuiſion among them about matters of Religion: and whether reſpect of Religion may vrge England ſtill to aſſiſt them.
            
            THAT the Hollanders haue a will to continue their warres, to the end that at laſt they might in quiet poſſeſſion attayne to their wiſhed great Republike, of the whole ſeauenteene Netherland Prouinces, with ſuch adiacent and Anſeaitcke places as they could come to incorporate and annexe vnto them, there is no doubt: but their want of meanes to vndergoe this charge,

wherof no end can be determined, is alſo out of doubt. It is now about ſome two yeares ago that I ſaw a note of calculation made of their debts, which then appeared to be about ſix millions of florins, for the which they payed, & do yet yearly pay intereſt. It is not lyke that this debt is diminiſhed, but that it is rather, ſince that tyme, much augmented; beſydes theyr yearely ch

            Their meanes and trafficke of marchandize is well known to be nothing ſo good as it hath beene, and dayly to declyne to worſe and worſe; for they haue not only had ex

they ſpoyle their trading amongſt them ſelues; in ſo much that Holland doth not only ſpoile the trading of Zeland, but euen in Holland they dayly ſtudy to ſpoile the trade one of another: ſo as it hath beene noted, that when in Amsterdam it ſelfe, ſome Merchant hauing gotten priuate aduice from his correſpondent els where, that in ſuch or ſuch a place, ſuch and ſuch a commodity will be well vented, and that this Merchant thereupon fraighteth a ſhip with wares accordingly; another that perceaueth him to be fraighting, though not knowing whither his voyage is intended, will ſtraight wayes, and with all diligence fraight a ſhip alſo with the ſelf ſame wares, and follow and dogge him by ſea, till he arriue to the ſame Hauen vnto which the other is bound; and ſo by hindering of his gaine catch away the bread out of his mouth. And as by this, ſo by all other wayes and meanes,

for all will be Merchants, aſwell the Boores in the Villages, as the Burgers in the Towne.
            This then trading then thus hindred what by Pyrats, what by the multitude of Merchants, and other wayes ſpoyled, they cannot draw ſufficient meanes for the maintenance of warre only out of toles and cuſtomes; neither can it be rayſed by taxes and impoſitions layd vpon the people, they being already more heauily burdened that way, then they are able to beare; and farre beyond the tenth penny which the Dulde of

               . The Catholikes, the Arminians, & the Anabaptiſts, which haue the beſt purſes, haue little reaſon for it. The Catholikes and the Arminians are forbidden the exerciſe of their religion, and they will rather goe and reſide out of the Countrey. The Anabaptiſts that haue

exerciſe in their houſes cannot beare the burden alone; and if all theſe th

               bis lending continue, when they ſhall ſee their money ſtill caſt into a bottomles pit of expences, where there can be no hope of getting it out againe; and ſo ſhall they be ſure to find, who doe aſſiſt thē, if after the now approaching expiration of the Truce, warres do begin againe.
            Thus hauing briefly deliuered vnto you my conceyt of their preſent meanes; I will now alſo endeauour to giue you ſatiſfaction to your demaund about their ſo great difference in Religion. I do not meane the great difference that is between Sect and Sect, for that is beyould all calculation; but the late great difference riſen vp among the Holland-Proteſtants themſelues.
            You ſhall then vnderſtand that about the yeare 1607. one Iacobus Arminius a Doctor and profeſſor of Proteſtant

Religion at Leyden (according as it is there profeſſed) did, after that he had, diuers yeares belieued and taught as they did, begin to fall into further conſideration then before he had done of certayne points of their doctrine, and eſpecially their doctrine of Predeſtination, which is, That God hath abſolutely and precyſely choſen and ordayned ſome people to ſaluation, and ſome to damnation, before themſelues haue either done good or euill: And that to thoſe whome God, of an abſolute will, hath ordayned to pe
                     •
                  dition, he hath determyned to deny, and actually doth deny, the grace which is needfull and ſufficient for Saluation, ſo as they neither can, nor may belieue or be ſaued.
            
            Againſt this doctrine Arminius oppoſed himſelf, affirming the ſame to be contrary to the Nature of God, as repugnant to his Wiſdome, to his Iuſtice, and to his Goodnes. That it alſo is againſt the Ghoſpel, which commaundeth conuerſion

and beliefe, and promiſeth the grace of the holy Ghoſt, Remiſſion of ſinnes, and euerlaſting Lyfe. And that which is more, it impugneth Free will, with which, and in the which, man was by God created. Moreouer it hindreth the diligence vnto the doing of good workes; for (ſayth he) man being driuen (as theſe mayntayners of this Predeſtination affirme) by meanes of the ſafe-making grace, then muſt he worke, and cannot leaue ſo to do; but not being driuen by the ſame grace, he cannot ſo do, but muſt leaue it vndon.
            Thus doth Arminius refute the commō 
               Caluinian opinion in the doctrin of Predeſtination, and teacheth playnly, that man hath Free-wil, and ſheweth that good works are needfull to Saluation; affirming alſo that the contrary doctrine to theſe points, doth ouerthrow and quyte deſtroy the foundatiō of Religion, as further may be ſeen in his declaration printed at Leyden in the yeare 1610.
            
               
               Arminius himſelfe dyed, before this his declaration came forth in print; but certayne Miniſters that imbraced his doctrine, did after his deceaſe cauſe it to be printed; and theſe men proceeding forward in the ſame doctrine, and fynding many of the moſt learned miniſters to imbrace it, and many thouſandes of people, which dayly more and more increaſe, ready to receaue it; they wrote ſundry Books in defence thereof, wherin they gaue themſelues the name of Remonstrantes.
            
            Heerupon ſome of the Miniſters that remayned in the former and direct Caluinian opinion, writing againſt them, called themſelues the Contra-Remonſtrants: but becauſe the common people called thoſe that followed the opinion of Arminius aforeſayd, by the name of Arminians, the otherſide gaue vnto the Contra-Remonstr
                     •
                  nts, the name of Gomariſts; becauſe of all other who oppoſed themſelues againſt the opinion of

               Arminius, one Franciſcus Gomarus was the firſt and chiefeſt. And albeit the ſayd Gomarus taught not otherwiſe then did Caluin, or do other Caluinists; yet are thoſe of his ſide called by many in Holand, and generally in all the Netherlands by the name of Gomarists, except by themſelues; for they call not themſelues Proteſtants, but The Reformed, as they did before this diſcord fell out.
            About this difference in Religiō there hath beene between them very many bickeringes, and virulent bookes and pamphlets haue beene written on both ſydes, the one againſt the other. But becauſe it would perhaps be too tedious to make but recitall of their titles in

               The firſt point is,
               Whether God hath created any people vnto damnation.
