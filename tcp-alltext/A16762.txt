            TO THE SPIRIT OF MVCH forwardnesse, in the inclination to much goodnesse, in the loue of learning, and the honor of vertue: M. Thomas Rowe, sonne to the Lady Bartley of Stoke, Nich. Breton wisheth with continuance of health, a prosperous atchieuement of his vertuous desires.
            
            
               SYr, my acquaintance with you hath not beene litle, nor my loue, lesse; which I wold bee glad to manifest in some better matter thē bare words, and yet, since words well weyed, sometime carry matter of good sence; in the words which I write, I pray you wey the sence of my good will; which if it haue not done so well as I wish, beare with it for a litle fault, and it may bee I will mend it with a greater: but leauing complements, let me entreat you, in your kindnesse, to Patronage this childe of my best choise, to answere the regard of your good discretion; in whom, though you finde not that

finenesse, that is fitting to phantastike humours, yet it may bee you shall note some such matter of contentment, as may be a little worthy entertainment: the best is this; there is a carefull mothers blessing to her beloued sonne: the first I know you haue and the second I doubt not you are: who reading what I haue written, and remembring what you haue read, I am assured will please her that loueth you, and loue him that herein hath pleased you: & for that much good that he knoweth in you, will euer loue you: but seeing it were better that I rather do so, then tell you so, I will leaue my hope to a good occasion to manifest the nature of my affection: And so beseeching God to blesse your forwardnesse in all good actions, and to preserue you from all illusions.
            
               Yours Irest at commaund, in what mine owne. Nich. Breton.
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               GEntlemen, there are so many idle Pamphlets vnder the abused name of Poetrie, abroad in the world, that matter of good worth, either morall, or diuine, if it bee handled in verse, it is almost as ill as vertue; it will not sell almost for any thing: yet amōg a number, of, no matter for thē, I doubt not but there are some wil giue Reason his right, and Vertue her due; to such onely I commend this little tract of morall discipline: which though it be handled in single verse, yet if it please you to peruse it, I hope you will not vtterly disdaine it: such as it is, I leaue it to your discreete censures, and kinde corrections; in which, as you shall shewe the best conditions of dispositions, so shall you giue mee cause with much tha

               lnesse, to present you hereafter with some better substance: But least I promise more then I can performe, I pray you take this in as good part, as if it had bin a matter of more worth:

and so wishing you all that beare good mindes, the happy fruites of your best desires: Loath to be too tedious, I rest as I finde cause.
            
               Your friend, N. Breton.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            The Mothers blessing.
            
               MY sonne, my sonne, my best beloued sonne,
               Hear my deare son, what careful charge I leaue thee:
               Take hold of Time, the glasse is quickly run,
               Trust not to Fortune, for she will deceiue thee:
               What ere thou art, let not the world perceiue thee.
               Know God, loue him, be gouern'd by his will,
               And haue no doubt of good, nor feare of ill.
            
            
               Weane laizie Will, from thriftlesse Idlenes:
               Beware the wanton, to abuse thy wit:
               Vnbridled Will breeds but vnhappines,
               How euer sorrowes Care would couer it:
               Who buyes Repentance must pay deare for it.
               Time, Truth, and Triall, will in one agree:
               The fruits of sin, Death, shame, and sorrow bee.
            
            
               Loue not vpon the first delightfull looke:
               Nor hate, vpon the first conceiued harme:
               Let not the care of Conscience be mistooke,
               And feare the force of the Almightie arme:
               Feare not mischance, nor harken to a charme.
               By graceles meanes, deuise not to enrich thee,
               And let no worlds vnworthy loue bewitch thee.
            
            
               
               If that thou serue a Thatcher, do him due:
               But if thou canst, subscribe not to the Clowne:
               Lest all too late, thou find'st it all too true,
               When thou hast thatcht the house, he throw thee downe,
               But neuer fret, how euer Fortune

               Breake not thy word, that well thou maist performe,
               For words are waide by men of worthy minde:
               Take heed of those, that falshoods do enforme,
               And strike not

               Giue not a Misers liberalitie,
               And feare the fruite of prodigalitie.
            
            
               Heare all men speake, but harken to the wise,
               Learne of the learned, and the vertuous loue▪
               
               And let no pride thy blessed soule surprise,
               That may discretion from thy minde remoue:
               Humilitie is grac't with God aboue.
               And Courtesie, with honors cariage,
               Twixt Loue, and Beautie, makes a mariage.
            
            
               
               Be kinde to those, that kindly do deserue,
               Cruell to none, a Tyrant is a Deuill:
               Haue speciall care, thy health for to preserue,
               And keep thee from the Epicurian euill,
               Loue not the eye that squints, nor lips that dreuill.
               Beware the Pander, and the Parasite,
               And do not leaue a Faulcon for a Kite.
            
            
               Giue not thine eare to euery Idle tale,
               And trust no more, then what of needs thou must:
               Set not the secrets of thy heart to sale,
               For feare, they throw thine honor in the dust,
               And do not loue the treasure that will rust.
               Make it thy day, but when the Sun doth shine,
               And ioy in soule but in the loue diuine.
            
            
               Place not thy learning in a Library,
               Yet reede, and marke, remember, and apply:
               And till thou art a perfect Antiquary,
               Stand not too much vpon antiquitie:
               Let vertue note the best Nobilitie.
               Be wise in all things, that thou doest intend,
               A good beginning makes a blessed end.
            
            
               
               Stand not on termes with persons of estate,
               Be truly loyall in thy life and loue:

               Nor make a Gaunlet of a hedging gloue.
               Let Bountie euer be the fruite of thrift,
               For borrowing is too neare the Beggers shift.
            
            
               Looke into Nature with Discretions eye,
               And sort thy selfe with vnderstanding spirits

               Build not thy Castle of conceit too high,
               Nor let thy hopes be grounded but on Merits,
               While heedles Connies feare the hunters Ferits.
               Giue none abuse, nor basely take disgrace,
               Nor loue that minde, that hath a brazen face.
            
            
               A blessed Colour is a maiden blush,
               And setled Countenance is a comely sight:

               That honors quarrell may be absolute:
               Lest rashnes too much reason ouershute.
               For carefull valor in a cause of strife,
               Strengthens the hart, and giues the spirit life.

               Which are but poysons to a princely minde:
               And noted well, are but destructions,
               That do the world with wicked humors blinde:
               And do the soule to hellish seruice binde.
               Where nothing for gaine must be forbidden,
               While diuels in the shape of men are hidden.
            
            
               Note what is done, by whom, and how, and when,
               And marke what issue growes of each euent:
               If by the sword, the purse, or by the pen,
               And where the honor of the action went:
               And how to take it for a president.
               For many things haue many times bene done,
               That had bene better, nere had bene begun.

               But follow onely that may do thee good:
               In questions alwaies make thy meaning plaine,
               Obscured thoughts are hardly vnderstood,
               But let not choller ouerheate thy bloud.
               So shall thy feare of fortunes force be small▪
               
               And thou shalt stand when other men do fall▪
               
            
            
               Take heed my sonne, thy soule be not deceiued
               With any straunge, or all too strong illusion:
               For cares best wit cannot be misconceiued,
               Which sees the force of follies close intrusion,
               While heedlesse will brings wit vnto confusion.
               Be wise my sonne, in heau'nly wisedomes booke,
               And thou shalt angle with no diuels hooke.
            
            
               Loue not a Iester, nor a hackney Iade,
               Time is but lost in either of their triall:
               Rather regard the mattocke and the spade,
               And take the sunne to be thy truest diall:
               Where thou shalt see the foole a knauish spiall.
               Shake off the lowse that hangs vpon thy cloathes,
               And hate the swearer that is full of oathes.

               No da
                     •
                  ie tooth, nor double diligence;
               Nor him that hath a world wide conscience.
            
            
               
               But sober, honest, wittie, thriftie, kinde,
               Good shape, good face, expert, and laborous,
               Good hand, good heart, good spirit, & good minde,
               Discreetly carefull, but not couetous:
               Faithfull and firme, in perfect truths approuing,
               And think that seruant kindly worth the louing.
            
            
               Now if thy sernant vnawares offend,
               In secret giue him reprehension:
               But if you see he care not to amend,
               Nor of aduice take better apprehension,
               Mistrust his spirit of some ill intention.
               Away with him, and turne him to disgrace,
               And seeke to put a better in his place.
            
            
               But last of all, and not the least in charge,
               I wish thee looke into thy loues consort:
               For when the heart hath left the eye at large,
               
                  Venus commaunds where Cupid scales the fort:
               As all too many, all too true report.
               Be carefull therefore in thy thoughts affection,
               That they be gouern'd by a good direction.
            
            
               
               Beautie with vertue, honour ioynd with kindnesse,
               Wit with some wealth, and person without pride:
               True noblenesse, without ambitious blindnesse,
               Faire haird, straight bodied, sweet countenance, and cleare 
                     •
                  ide;
               A spirit where no poison doth abide.
               Where these sweet birds do all in one bush sing,
               Who would not spend his life in such a spring?
            
            
               But if she be ilfauour'd, blind, and old,
               A prattle basket, or an idle slut:
               A sleepie huswife, or a hatefull scold,
               Or such a sparrow as will not keepe cut:
               Spoile not thy teeth with cracking such a nut.
               For in the world there is no greater hell,
               Then in a house with such a hagge to dwell.
            
            
               Or if complexion with condition meete,
               A Croidon sanguine, and a currish nature:
               A minde that treads good manners vnder feete,
               A sorrell foretop, and a sowish feature:
               God blesse thee sonne, from such a wicked creature.
               And let thee rather leade a single life,
               Then kill thy selfe, to liue with such a wife.
            
            
               
               Learne then to chuse the best, and leaue the worst,
               And chusing well, make much of such a choise:
               And thou shalt see while other liue accurst,
               Thy heart and soule shall inwardly reioyce:
               Oh heartie loue is such a heau'nly voyce,
               As he that know it, or doth kindly heare it,
               Will finde no musicke in the world come neare it.
            
            
               But I will leaue thee to the heau'ns direction,
               Beseeching God of his high heauenly grace▪
               
               To settle so the care of thy affection,
               It take no roote in an vnworthy place:
               But that a virgins eye, and Angels face,
               So make thee ioyfull of thy happie chaine,
               That fancie bound, would not be free againe▪
               
            
            
               But that this course, and euerie other care,
               May purchase and continue thy content:
               And that thy soule may liue, where vertues are,
               The happie soules eternall ornament:
               To him that fram'd the highest firmament.
               Thy heart and soule in loue all humbly bow,
               And to his will, thy seruice truly vow.
            
            
               
               At morne, at noone, at euening, day, and night,
               Vnto his mercie do confesse thy sin:
               And begge of him, to cleare thy blinded sight,
               And teach thy spirit how it may begin
               To finde the way that gracious loue may win.
               Pray, weepe, and cry, vntill thou hast obtained
               Into his seruice to be entertained.
            
            
               And when thou feel'st the spirit of that grace
               That rules the heau'ns, come downe into thy hart:
               And so thy thoughts in order all to place,
               That vertue do dispose of euery part:
               When thus thou feelest that thou blessed art,
               Pray for continuance of that comforts blisse,
               That keepes the soule, it cannot go amisse.
            
            
               And when thou feel'st the loathing of that sinne,
               That long misled, that mournfull soule of thine:
               And the true way of grace art entred in,
               That doth the soule to sacred loue encline,
               And doth assure thee of the loue diuine,
               Then let thy heart, thy minde, and spirit sing,
               An Halleluiah to thy heauenly King.
            
            
               
               Begin with glory to his maiestie,
               Proceed with glorie to his holy name:
               Coutinue glorie to his Deitie,
               And end with glorie to his worthy fame:
               And endlesse be the glorie of the same.
               Begin, proceed, continue, end his story,
               Without beginning, neuer ending glory.
            
            
               O highest glory, in the heau'ns aboue,
               O brightest glory, of theau'ns behoue:
               O purest glory, before heau'ns to proue,
               O blessed glory, aboue heau'ns to loue:
               O louely glory, that all loue doth moue.
               O gracious glory, that all grace beginneth,
               O glorious glory, that all glory winneth.
            
            
               Thus my deare sonne, sing vnto God thy Lord,
               And sing in tune, that heau'ns may ioy to heare:
               And let thy tongue, thy heart, and soule accord,
               To chaunt it out with such a ioy full cheare,
               That heau'ns may see, thou hold'st their master deare.
               And thy true faith may in thy spirit proue,
               The liuing comfort of thy heau'nly loue.
            
            
               
               But if thou doost not serue thy God aright,
               And humbly feare his holy maiestie:
               Thy clearest day will turne to darksome night,
               Thy wealth to want, thy wit to vanitie:
               Thine ease to paine, ioy to calamitie.
               Thy sweetest musicke to a mournfull quell,
               Thy life to death, thy hope of heauen to hell.
            
            
               For though a while he suffer thee to thriue,
               And finde on earth a fayned paradies:
               Yet death will come, who quickly will depriue,
               Thy sences of the pleasures of thine eies:
               Wherein th'illusion of thy spirit lies.
               And thou wilt be within thy soule so torne,
               As thou wouldst wish, thou neuer hadst bin borne.
            
            
               A world of woes will ouerwhelme thy heart,
               And fearefull dreames affright thee in the night:
               A thousand torments will encrease thy smart;
               And dreadfull visions will thy soule affright:
               Thou shalt be bard from the eternall light.
               And in the darknesse, where all horrors dwell,
               Thy soule shall burne in euerlasting hell.
            
            
               
               Where thou shalt see the mizer-minded-dogge,
               Frie in the furnace of his molten gold▪
               
               The glutton monster, and the drunken hogge,
               Gnawing their bones, with hunger, thirst, and cold:
               The murtherer in paines not to be told.
               The leacher so bedight in beastlinesse,
               As kills his soule to see his filthinesse.
            
            
               The tyrant tortur'd with those vgly spirits,
               That fed his humour with the thirst of blood:
               The traitor follow'd with those hungry ferits,
               That onely fed vpon the poysned food
               Of damned soules, that neuer did man good.
               The theefe tormented with the shamelesse lyer,
               The swearers mouth, all in a flame of fyer.
            
            
               The pander and the wicked parasite,
               Shall sup the broath of hellish beastlinesse:
               The heretike in wilfull ouersight,
               Shall feed vpon the froth of foolishnesse:
               Boyld in the fire of all vnfaithfulnesse.
               The Atheist so shall feele Gods vengeance on him,
               That all the plagues of hell shall fall vpon him.
            
            
               
               The vniust Iudge, at least if there be any,
               The bribing client of ill conscience:
               The periur'd witnesse whereof are too many,
               The plotting pate of sinfull pestilence;
               The wrothfull spirit of impatience:
               All these shall iustly all their torments beare,
               But God blesse thee from seeing of them there.
            
            
               But if thou rightly serue thy Lord and God,
               And day and houre do sue to him for grace:
               When faithfull Truth this world hath ouertrod,
               Thy soule shall flye vnto afairer place;
               Where thou shalt see thy Sauiour in the face;
               And in that face, that euerlasting blis,
               In which the brightnesse of all glory is.
            
            
               There shalt thou see frō hie the day-light springing,
               Which darksome night hath neuer power to shade:
               There shalt thou heare the Saints & Angels singing,
               And all their ditties to his glory made;
               There shalt thou feele the ioyes that neuer fade.
               There shall thy soule more perfect ioyes possesse,
               Then tongue, or heart, or spirit, can expresse.
            
            
               
               There shalt thou see the bounteous richly crowned,
               The gratious Prince in Angels armes embraced:
               The vertuous souldiers with the Saints renowmed;
               The Iudge of Iustice, in high honor placed:
               The faithfull witnes, in Truthes fauour graced.
               The virgins singing, in the Angels quier,
               How patient hopes vnto their heau'n aspire.
            
            
               There shalt thou feele the blessed ioy of peace,
               Wherein the life of holy loue doth rest:
               There shalt thou heare the Musicke neuer cease,
               Where Angels voyces euer are adrest,
               In their best tunes to sound his glory best,
               Where euery one a blessed part doth beare,
               God blesse thee sonne, to set them euer there.
            
            Amen.
