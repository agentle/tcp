Because the Romanes whose speeche was Latine had the knowledge of the learned artes from the Greekes, and for that at the first they had not deuised in the Latin tongue fit words to expresse the meaning of these Greeke termes, therefore they kept still the greeke woordes, not onely in Grammar but also in all the other liberall Sciences.

They leaue out also w. for it is a letter proper to our English tongue. And though they vse h. in many wordes, yet they count it not a letter but onely the marke of a breathed vowell: so that the Latins in deede haue but 20. proper letters.

               Q. Why be they so called?
               
                  R. Because that of themselues they haue no manner of sounde, and therefore in pronouncing yee adde vnto them this vowell e. or a. as be. ce. de. ka. &c.

               Q. How many be called Liquides, or myld & melting letters?
               
                  R. Forsooth foure of those Semiuocales. That is l. m. n. r.
               
            
            
               Q. Why bee they so called?
               
                  R. Eyther because they sounde not so harde in pronouncing: Or els, because when one of them standeth in a woorde nexte after any of the Mutes it maketh the vowell goyng before to be eyther long or short.
            
            
               Q. Howe many bee called Double consonantes?

               Q. To what vse serue these letters?
               
                  
                  R. They serue to expresse in writing the wordes that a man thinketh to speake.
            
            
               Q. How do ye know with what letters to write a worde?
               
                  R. That is best learned by vse. But in the vowelles the sounde will teache yee which is to be vsed, and in the consonantes the framing of the tongue in speaking will bring yee to the letter.
            
            
               Q. What speciall notes haue yee for the placing of your letters in writing?

                     1. The first letter of euery word that beginneth a sentence and the first letter of euery proper name must be written with a bigger letter theÌ„ the other words, and those bigger letters are commonly called Capitall letters.
                  
                     2 Betwixt m & n ye shal neuer write p.
                  
                  
                     3 In Latine after x yee shall neuer write s.
                  
                  
                     4 In all simple words these letters following must alwayes be ioyned and spelled with the vowell that commeth after them. bd. ct. ps. st. cn. gm. gn. st. x.
                  
                  
                     5 In compounding of words ye must alwaies take heede to make good sounde, whiche the Greekes call Euphonia and therfore sometime some letters are to be put out, sometime others are to be put in, sometime those are to be changed.
               
            
            
               Q. Howe proue yee that?
               
                  R. For Example. Of ob & curro I compound one verbe which I write not obcurro, but occurro. Euphoniae gratia that is for good soundes sake. So for Absfero I write aufero. and for conlego I write colligo.
               
            
            
               Q. Nowe, What call yee a Dipthong?
               
                  R. It is a greeke worde and signifieth a double sound. And it is the placing of two vowels in one sillable which must be pronounced both together.
            
            
               
               
                  Q.  How many dipthonges haue yee?

               Q. Nowe. What call yee a sillable?
               
                  R. It is a greeke tearme, and may signifie in english a coupling. For it is the coupling of vowels and consonantes that are to be pronounced together without breaking of the sound, as if it were but one letter.
            
            
               Q. Must there needes be a vowell in euery sillable?
               
                  R. Yea. Or els there is no sounde.
            
            
               Q. Can there be no more vowels but one in a sillable?
               
                  R. No. In latine two vowels can neuer properly bee ioyned together in one sillable, except it be a dipthong.
            
            
               Q. How many letters may be in a sillable?
               
                  R. So manie as may be pronounced together with one breath without breaking of the sound.
            
            
               Q. Howe fewe letters may be in a sillable?
               
                  R. Sometime but one. But that must needes be a vowell. and then it is called, a or e, or o, perse, that is a or e or o by it selfe, but if there be any consonant in the sillable there must needes be more letters then one.
            
            
               Q. How will ye know how many sillables ther be in a word?
               
                  R. Very easily, for in latine there be so many sillables as there

be vowels. Except there bee a Dipthong. But it is best knowne by the pronouncing of the worde.
            
            
               Q. Why so?
               
                  R. For. So often as I am compelled to breake the sound in pronouncing of a woorde, so manye sillables bee in the worde as in me, ri, di, e, i. I breake the sounde fiue times, and therefore I haue fiue sillables.
            
            
               Q. Nowe. What call yee a worde?
               
                  R. It is a voyce consisting of one sillable or more, wherein is vttered so much as signifieth some what.
            
            
               Q. Howe manie sillables doe make a woorde?
               
                  R. There is no certaine number appointed. For some words be of one sillable called Monosyllaba, some be of 2. called Dissillaba. Some of more then two, called Hyperdissyllaba, Or of manie syllables called Polysyllaba.
               
            
            
               Q. Nowe what meane yee by distinctions of wordes?
               
                  R. They bee certayne prickes and markes which bee vsed in writing, to deuide euery sentence into his partes and to teache vs how to pawse in reading.
            
            
               Q. Howe many suche markes haue yee?
               
                  R. They be commonly these sixe.
               
                  1 Comma.
                  2 Colon.
                  3 Periodus.
                  4 Interrogatio.
                  5 Apostrophus.
                  6 Parenthesis.
               
            
            
               Q. What is meant by Comma?
               
               
                  R. It is a little crooke set at the end of a woorde, thus (,) which noteth that there is ended a little piece of a sentence, which wee call a clawse, and must haue a verie little pawse in reading.
            
            
               Q. What meane yee by Colon?
               
               
                  R. It is a marke made with two prickes thus (:) and doeth note that there is ended one of the chiefe partes of a sentence, called a member of a sentence, and therefore requireth a longer pawse.
            
            
               
               Q. What call yee Periodus?
               
               
                  R. It is a marke made with one pricke, thus (.) and noteth that the sentence is there fully ended. And therefore requireth a perfect pawse.
            
            
               Q. What meane yee by Interrogatio?
               
               
                  R. It is a marke made with two prickes thus (?) and noteth that the sentence going before it is a question, and should haue the last woordes raysed vp somewhat sharpe in pronouncing.
            
            
               Q. What call yee Apostrophus?
               
               
                  R. It is a little crooke set at the toppe of a letter thus. Nost in'. And noteth that there is something lacking in the ende of that worde.
            
            
               Q. What meane yee by Parenthesis?
               
               
                  R. That is a marke made with two halfe circles thus () and noteth that all the woordes betwixt these two halfe circles are no parte of that sentence wherewith they bee ioyned, but are a speciall sentence of themselues, thrust into the other sentence vppon some speciall occasion: so that the other sentence may bee taken together whole without them.
            
            
               Q. Nowe what thinges doe yee obserue in reading?
               
                  R. These two thinges.
               
                  1 Cleane sounding.
                  2 Dewe pawsing.
               
            
            
               Q. Wherein standeth cleane sounding?
               
               
                  R. In giuing to euery letter his iust and full sounde. In breaking or diuiding euery worde duely into his seuerall syllables, so that euery syllable may bee hearde by himselfe and none drownd, nor slubbered vp ill fauouredly. In the right pronouncing of ti, whiche of vs is commonly sounded ci when any vowel doeth follow next after him or els not. And finally in avoyding all such vices as are of many foolishly vsed by euill custome.
            
            
               
               Q. What vices be those?
               
                  R.
               
               
                  
                     Iotacismus. sounding i too broade.
                  
                     2 Labdacismus. sounding l too full.
                  
                     3 Ischnotes. mincing of a letter, as feather for father.
                  
                     4 Traulismus. stammering or stutting.
                  
                     5 Plateasmus, too much mouthing of letters.
                  
                     6 Cheilostomia. maffling or fumbling wordes in the mouth.
                  
                     7 Abusing of letters. as v for f. vat for fat. z for s as muza for musa. sh for ci. as fasho for facio dosham for doceam foelishum for felicium and such like.
               
            
            
               Q. Wherein standeth due pawsing?
               
                  R. In right obseruation of the markes and prickes before mencioned.
            
            And thus much for the first parte of Grammar.
         
         
            The second part of Grammar.
            
               
                  Q. VVHich is the second part of Grammar?
                  
                  
                     R. Etymologia.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What meane yee by Etymologia?
                  
                  
                     R. It is a greeke worde, Which some interprete in latine Veriloquium. And (if the worde were vsed) in Englishe, I would call it true woording. Or the true vse of wordes.
               
               
                  Q. What doe you learne in Etymologia?
                  
                  
                     R. Three things.
                  
                     
                        1. The true original & beginning of wordes.
                     
                        2. What euery worde is to be called in Grammar.
                     
                     
                        3. What thinges fall or chaunce to euery worde.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Howe will you learne the true originall or beginning of wordes?
                  
                     R. That must be learned by much reading after we know the rules of Grammar.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Then what doe ye learne in this part of Grammar for the calling of wordes?
                  
                     
                     R. There be many proper tearmes in Grammar which perteyne to wordes and speeche.
               
               
                  Q. Why, are wordes called otherwise in your art of Grammar then they be in common speech?
                  
                     R. Yea forsooth.
               
               
                  Q. Why so?
                  
                     R. Because neither Grammar, nor any other arte can be taught without some speciall tearmes deuised, to expresse the partes and thinges belonging to the same.
               
               
                  Q. Showe me some example?
                  
                     R. As in the art of sayling there be many tearmes proper to that art. As of the ship, the docke, the rudder, the snowte, the hatches, the decke, the mast, &c. The plowman hath proper tearmes in his owne art, as of the plowe, the beame, the cocke, the tayle, the cowlter, the share, &c. And so is it in all other artes.
               
               
                  Q. Be all the tearmes of Grammar conteyned in Etymologia?
                  
                  
                     R. No. For euery parte of Grammar hath his proper tearmes. As in Orthographia: You had these tearmes, Letters, Dypthonges, Syllables, Distinctions, &c. So are there special tearmes belonging to the other partes of Grammar.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Then what tearmes of Grammar be in this second parte called Etymologia?
                  
                  
                     R. Such tearmes as belong to the naming of wordes and thinges pertayning to the same.
               
               
                  Q. What doeth Etymologia especially intreate of?
                  
                     R. Of euery worde that is to be vsed in speech.
               
               
                  Q. What is speech?
                  
                     R. It is a pronouncing of wordes together, wherein euery man and woman speaking to eche other, vse to vtter their myndes.
               
               
                  Q. Whereof is speech made?
                  
                     R. Of wordes.
               
               
                  Q. Then what call yee woordes in Grammar?
                  
                  
                     R. I call all woordes partes of speeche.
               
               
                  Q. Howe many partes of speech be there in Grammar?
                  
                  
                     R. Eight.
               
               
                  
                  Q. Why, you sayde that euery worde is a part of speeche and are there but eight wordes in all the worlde?
                  
                     R. Yes there be many thousandes of woordes: But, all woordes that bee vsed in speeche are called by one of these eight tearmes in Grammar.
               
               
                  Q. Which be those eight tearmes which yee call the eight partes of speeche?
                  
                     R These.
                  
                     1 Nowne.
                     2 Pronowne.
                     3 Verbe.
                     4 Participle.
                     5 Aduerbe.
                     6 Coniunction.
                     7 Preposition.
                     8 Interiection.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Can there bee no fewer then eight termes which doe conteine in them all sorts of wordes?
                  
                     R. Yes it were more easie to say there are but 4. a Nowne & a Verbe, an Aduerbe & a Coniunction.
                  
               
               
                  Q. How so?
                  
                     R. Because a Pronowne & a Participle may very wel be referred to a Nowne, & a Preposition and Interiection may well be referred to an Aduerbe.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What is ye first differeÌ„ce amoÌ„gst these 8. partes of speech?
                  
                     R. Forsooth yt first 4. be declined: & yt latter 4. be vndeclined.
               
               
                  Q. What meane yee by declined and vndeclined.
                  
                     R. That worde in Grammar is saide to be declined, which maye bee chaunged in the last letter or sillable into other letters or syllables. And that whiche cannot bee so chaunged is sayde to be vndeclined.
               
               
                  Q. Be those first foure declined all in one manner?
                  
                     R. No. For some of them bee declined with cases, and some with moodes and tenses.
               
               
                  Q. How many partes of speech be declined with cases?
                  
                     R. These three. Nowne, Pronowne, and Participle. And a verbe onely is declined with modes and tenses.
               
               
                  Q. What were the first difference among woordes if there were but foure partes of speech?
                  
                     R. This. Some be wordes that haue number in them, as a Nowne, & a verbe. Some be wordes yt haue no nuÌ„ber in them

as an aduerbe and a coniunction.
               
               
                  Q. What is to be considered in euery part of speech?
                  
                     R. These 3. things.

                        
                           1
what it is
which is called the
definitioÌ„
                           
                        
                        
                           2
what parts it hath
which is called the
diuision.
                        
                        
                           3
what thinges chance vnto it
which is called the
accideÌ„ts.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  Q. Then first what is a nowne?
                  
                     R. Any worde that betokeneth the name of any thing is a nowne. {Or thus.
The name of any thing that may bee seene, felt, hearde, or vnderstanded is a nowne. As a booke.
               
               
                  Q. Is thy booke a nowne?
                  
                     R. The thing it selfe which is called a booke is not a nown, but this woorde booke, which is the name of the thing is a nowne, for a nowne signifieth nothing els but a name.
               
               
                  Q. Why doest thou put this difference betwixte the thing and the name of the thing?
                  
                     R. For that in Grammar which teacheth the true order of speech, wee haue to consider nothing but the very woordes that be spoken: so that thinges which bee signified by these wordes perteyne nothing to Grammar, and therefore no kinde of thing is a nowne, but the worde which is the name of any thing, that is a nowne.
               
               
                  Q. Howe many sortes of nownes haue ye?
                  
                     R. Two, some be called
                  
                     Substantiues and
                     Adiectiues.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Howe knowe you a nowne substantiue?
                  
                     R. A nowne substantiue is a name that standeth by himselfe.
               
               
                  Q. Howe can a nowne whiche is but a woorde stande by it selfe.
                  Q. I knowe that no worde can properly stande by it selfe,

but is a borrowed speeche and I meane an other thing by it.
               
               
                  Q. What meane ye by standeth by him selfe?
                  
                     R. That is to say, requireth not an other word to be ioyned with him.
               
               
                  Q. Tell me this more plainely?
                  
                     R. A nowne substantiue is a perfect worde, and a name so certaine, that I knowe certainely what thing it nameth, although there be no other worde ioyned with it.
                  So that when I say it standeth by it selfe, I meane I can vnderstande by it selfe the thinge that it signifieth although there be no other worde ioyned vnto it.
               
               
                  Q. Haue ye any speciall marke whereby to know a nowne substantiue?
                  
                     R. Yea forsoth. Any woorde that may aptly and properly haue before his Englishe this signe a. or the. is a nowne substantiue, as A citie, the citie.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Howe many sortes of nownes substantiues haue ye?
                  
                     R. Two for some be called
                  
                     
                        Proper and
                     
                        Common or appellatiue.
                     
                  
               
               
                  Q. What call yee a nowne proper?
                  
                     R. A proper name is a nowne which is proper to the thing that it betokeneth, that is to say, whiche doeth signifie some one speciall thing.
               
               
                  Q. Howe many sortes of proper names haue yee?
                  
                     R. Tenne as proper names of
                  
                     1 Godds.
                     2 Men.
                     3 Floodes.
                     4 Monethes.
                     5 Windes.
                     6 Goddesses.
                     7 Women.
                     8 Cities
                     9 Countreys
                     10 Ilandes.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What call yee a common name, or a nowne appellatiue.
                  
                     R. A nown common is that whose signification is common

to moe, that is, which betokeneth all things of that force.
               
               
                  Q. Shewe mee examples of a proper name, and of a common name?
                  
                     R. Edouardus is a proper name, and signifieth but one man so called. But A man is a common name and signifieth all men. So Londinum the Citie of London is a proper name: because it is the name but of one Citie so called. But vrbs a Citie is a common name, because euery Citie is called a Citie, but euery citie is not called London.
               
               
                  Q. Nowe howe knowe ye a nowne Adiectiue?
                  
                     R. A nowne adiectiue is a name that cannot stande by him selfe.
               
               
                  Q. What meane ye by that?
                  
                     R. That is to say, requireth an other woorde to be ioyned with him.
               
               
                  Q. Tell me this more playnely?
                  
                     R. A nowne adiectiue is the name of a thing, but so doubtfull and vncertaine, as I knowe not certainely what thing it nameth except there be some other worde ioyned vnto it: so that when I say it can not stande by it selfe: I meane that I caÌ„not perfectly vnderstand what thing it belongeth vnto, excepte there bee a substantiue ioyned vnto it, as Good.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Why, do ye not knowe that good is the name of a thing?
                  
                     R. Yes, I know that when you say good you meane something, but I knowe not what thing ye call good, except ye put some other worde vnto it: as a good horse, a good boy.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Haue ye any speciall marke whereby to know a nowne adiectiue?
                  
                     R. Yea forsooth In English, any name with which I may aptly ioyne this worde thing, is a nowne adiectiue: as a good thing.
                  
               
               
                  Q. This is inough for the diuision of a nowne. Now what meane ye by the Accidents.
                  
                     
                     R. The Accidents be certayne properties falling or belonging to all the partes of speeche generally, or to euery seuerall part of speeche particularly, and thereof my booke is called an Accidence or the Accidents.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Why so?
                  
                     R. For that is (as I take it) the booke that teacheth all the accidents, that is to say, all such thinges as fall or belong to all the partes of speeche.
               
               
                  Q. Howe many sortes of accidents haue yee?
                  
                     R.
Two sortes, for some bee

                        generall and belong to all partes of speeche as forme and figure.
                        particular whereof some belong to

                     R. Rectus casus signifieth the right case, and the nominatiue case is so called, because it setteth downe rightly the very name of euery thing, as homo. Obliquus casus, signifieth a crooked or bended case, and so be all other cases called, because their terminations are as it were bent and crooked away from the nominatiue,
                  As hominis, homini, hominem, homine. &c.

                     R. In Latine by the termination, in Englishe it hath commonly this signe to, before him, and answereth to this question
                  
                     To whome or To what? as I giue a booke to the Maister.

                  Q. Howe knowe ye the vocatiue case?

                     Q. For if I call or speake to any person, I must put the name of the person to whom I speake in the vocatiue case, as Master, I loue you.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Howe knowe ye the ablatiue case?

                  Q. This is sufficient for the cases, what call ye Gender?
                  
                  
                     R. Gender is an accident of a nowne, whereby wee make difference of natures in the names of thinges considering whether the woorde signifie the Male kynde or the Female.

                     Masculine.

                     Newter.

                     R The marke whereby we discerne the gender.
               
               
                  Q. How many articles haue yee?
                  
                     R. Three.
                  
                     Hic.

                     Hoc.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Why, this Hic. Haec. Hoc, is a pronown & signifieth this?
                  
                     R. It is true. Hic. Haec. Hoc, is a Pronowne and then it signifieth this, but when it is declined with a Nowne, it is onlie an article, that is to say, the marke of a gender and hath no signification at all.
               
               
                  Q. Then which is the proper article of the Masculine gender?
                  
                     R. The Masculine gender is declined with this article hic, as hic vir a man.
               
               
                  Q. Which is the article of the Feminine?
                  
                  
                     
                     R. Haec.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Which of the Newter?
                  
                     R. Hoc.
                  
               
               
                  Q. You say there are but three genders in deede: and they haue their proper articles. What then? Haue those other which ye numbred among the genders, no articles?
                  
                     R. They be not properly genders, and therefore they haue no proper articles, But as they be a mixture or mingling of genders, so doe they borrowe their articles of the three proper genders.
               
               
                  Q. Howe so?
                  
                     R. The common of two is both the masculine gender and the feminine, and therefore hee hath both their articles hic and haec.
                  
                  The common of three is both the masculine, the feminine, and the newter, and therefore hee borroweth all their articles hic haec and hoc.
                  
                  The doutfull gender is eyther the masculine or the feminine, and therefore he hath hic or haec.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What article hath the Epicene gender?
                  
                     R. The Epicene gender may haue any article according to the nature of the woorde. But all nownes of the Epicene gender be eyther names of foules or of fishes, or of wylde beastes. And because these nownes doe in one word signifie two kindes, that is, the male & the female. Therefore wee say suche a worde is the Epicene gender, that is the common or mingled gender.
               
               
                  Q. Why so?
                  
                     R. Because that in any such one worde what article soeuer it hath is vnderstood two natures, the male and the female As Vulpes the hee foxe and the shee. Passer the cock sparrow & yt hen. Halec the male hearing, & yt female.
               
               
                  Q. How will you finde out the gender of a nowne?
                  
                     R. By certaine rules in latine verses set downe in my booke of the latine Grammar.
                  
               
               
                  Q. This is sufficient for geÌ„ders, what call yee declenson?
                  
                     R. It is the breaking of the first name of a worde into diuers

other terminations which we call cases.

                     R. Like the nominatiue except nownes in as which do make their vocatiue in a as Nominatiuo Thomas vocat. Thoma.
                  
               
               
                  Q. How endes the Datiue case plurall of the first declenson?
                  
                     R. in is.
                  
               
               
                  Q. what, in all nownes?
                  
                     R. No. For these two nownes filia and nata doe make the datiue and the ablatiue case plurall in is or in abus, As Datiuo his filiis vel siliabus. And these foure nownes Dea, Mola, Equa, Liberta doe not make the datiue and the ablatiue case plurall in is but onely in abus, as Datiuo Deabus, Mulabus, Equabus, Libertabus.
                  
               
               
                  Q. How ends the vocatiue case singular in the 2. declenson?
                  
                     R. For the most part like the nominatiue?
               
               
                  Q. Doeth it not alwayes ende like the nominatiue?
                  
                     R. No forsooth.
               
               
                  Q. When doth it not ende like the nominatiue?
                  
                     R. When the nominatiue endeth either in vs or in ius.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Howe endeth the vocatiue when the nominatiue endeth in vs?
                  
                  
                     
                     R. When the nominatiue endeth in vs the vocatiue shall ende in e.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What in all nownes?
                  
                     R. Yea forsooth. Except this woorde Deus which maketh the vocatiue case Deus also. And filius whiche maketh the vocatiue fili.
                  
               
               
                  Q. How ends the vocatiue when yt nominatiue endeth in ius?
                  
                  
                     R. When the nominatiue endeth in ius the vocatiue shall end in i if the word be a proper name of a man, as Terentius vocat. Terenti: otherwise it endeth in e.
                  
               
               
                  Q. You sayde that all Nownes which haue their nominatiue in vs, doe make their vocatiue in e except Deus & filius. How say ye to Manus, doth he make his vocatiue case Mane?
                  
                  
                     R. No. For manus is a nowne of the 4. declenson. And this rule is onely for nownes of the second declenson.
               
               
                  Q. Doe all other nownes in vs of the seconde declenson except Deus, make their vocatiue in e.
                  
                  
                     R. Nay. These 6. nownes, agnus, lucus, vulgus, populus, chorus, fluuius, make their vocatiue in e or in vs.
                  
               
               
                  Q. How endes the vocatiue case in all other declensons?
                  
                     R. The vocatiue case in all declensons generally endes like the nominatiue both in the singular number & in ye plurall.
               
               
                  Q. Hoc regnum, tegni, what declenson is it?
                  
                     R. The seconde because the genitiue case singular endeth in i.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What is his nominatiue case plurall?
                  
                     R. Regna.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Why, how endes the nominatiue case plurall of the second declenson?
                  
                     R. in i.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Then why doe yee not say nominatiue haec regni?
                  
                  
                     R. Because it is a nowne of the newter gender.
               
               
                  Q. And what then?
                  
                     R. All nownes of the newter gender of what declenson soeuer, haue the nominatiue, the accusatiue and the vocatiue alike both in the singular number and in the plurall. And those three cases in the plurall number end alwayes

in a as well in substantiues, as in adiectiues of the newter gender.
               
               
                  Q. Is there no nowne substantiue nor adiectiue of the newter gender but that he makes the nominatiue the accusatiue and the vocatiue case plurall in a?
                  
                  
                     R. None except these two nownes ambo & duo. And they doe not make these three cases plurall in a. but in o, and therfore I say pluraliter ambo ambae ambo, & not amba.
                  
               
            
            
               Of Adiectiues.
               
                  Q. This is sufficient for substantiues. Nowe howe many sortes of adiectiues haue yee?
                  
                     R. So many as I had of substantiues. For some be proper, some be common. And some be Primitiue some bee Deriuatiue. And some be simple and some be compound.
               
               
                  Q. What accidentes hath an adiectiue?
                  
                     R. All those which a substantiue hath and one more.
               
               
                  Q. Whiche is that?
                  
                     R. Comparison.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Why doeth not a sudstantiue make comparison?
                  
                     R. No forsooth. For comparison is onelie proper to adiectiues, although in some Authors are read some few words of the coÌ„paratiue degree drawne out of substantiues, yet it is vnproper. For no substantiue doeth properly forme comparison but by abuse.
               
               
                  Q. Are all the accidentes in an adiectiue as they bee in a substantiue?
                  
                     R. Forme, Figure, Number, and case be the same and in the same manner in an adiectiue, that they were in a substantiue: but there is some difference in the genders and in the declyning.
               
               
                  Q. What genders hath an adiectiue?
                  
                     R. Euery perfect adiectiue hath in euery case both in the singular number and in the plurall all the three proper genders: That is to say, the Masculine, the Feminine & yt 
                     Newter.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Howe will yee finde out these three genders in euerye

case of an adiectiue?
                  
                     R. If there be three terminations of the adiectiue as bonus, bona, bonum, the first termination is the Masculine gender, the second is the feminine, and the thirde is the newter. If there be but two terminations as hunc & hanc foelicem & hoc foelix, then the former termination as foelicem is both the Masculine and the Feminine, and the latter termination as foelix is the Newter. If there be but one termination, as hic haec & hoc foelix or Datiuo bonis, then that one termination is both the Masculine, the Feminine, and the Newter in what case soeuer it bee.
               
               
                  Q. Howe chaunce yee sayde there were but two terminations, when ye reckoned hunc & hanc foelicem & hoc foelix, are there no wordes but two?
                  
                     R. Yes, but because hunc hanc & hoc are but articles, that is to say, signes of the gender, therefore I must not reckon them nor any one of the articles in what case soeuer it be, for any parte or termination of the Nowne, so that beside the articles there are no moe terminations in that case but foelicem & foelix.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What difference is there in declining of adiectiues?
                  
                     R. Forsooth some be declined with three terminations in euery case without any articles: and some be declined with three articles.
               
               
                  Q. How be nownes adiectiues of 3. terminations declined?
                  
                     R. Nownes adiectiues of 3. terminations in the masculine gender, be declined like nownes substantiues of the Masculine gender in the second declenson, that is to say, like Dominus or Magister. In the Feminine gender like a nowne of the first declenson as Musa. In the newter, like a nowne of the Newter gender in the second Declenson, as Regnum.
                  
               
               
                  Q. How be nownes adiectiues of 3. articles declined?
                  
                     R. Like nownes substantiues of the Masculine, Feminine, and newter gender in the 3. declenson.
               
               
                  Q. Be all adiectiues declined in this manner?
                  
                     
                     R. All sauing these eyght, vnus, totus, solus, vllus, alius, alter, vter and neuter. And their compoundes whiche make their genitiue case singular in ius and their datiue in i, in all other cases they are declined like nownes adiectiues of three terminations.
               
            
            
               Of Comparison.
               
                  Q. We haue past ouer sixe of the accidentes of a Nowne, which is the seuenth?
                  
                     R. Comparison.
               
               
                  Q. What call yee comparison?
                  
                     R. It is in english the altering of the signification of a word by degrees into more or lesse, In latine it is the altering of a word into other terminations, whereby the worde doeth signifie more or lesse.
               
               
                  Q. How many parts of speech doe forme comparison?
                  
                     R. These foure, a
                  
                     Nowne.
                     Participle.
                     Aduerbe.
                     Preposition.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Are yee sure that all these foure partes of speeche dot make comparison?
                  
                     R. I cannot say that they all properly doe forme coÌ„parison, so long as they be taken for those partes of speech.
               
               
                  Q. Why so?
                  
                     R. For a Participle when hee formeth comparison is accounted to bee a nowne adiectiue. And a Preposition wheÌ„ he formeth comparison is counted an Aduerbe.
               
               
                  Q. Well then, doe all nownes adiectiues and all Aduerbes forme comparison?
                  
                     R. No forsooth.
               
               
                  Q. Which then?
                  
                     R All such nownes and aduerbes whose signification may be increased or diminished, That is to say, made more or made lesse, as harde, harder, hardest.
               
               
                  Q. How many sortes of comparison haue yee?
                  
                     
                     R.
These foure a comparison that is called

                        
                           1 perfect.

                  Q. Which call yee a perfect comparison?
                  
                     R. That which hath all the degrees of comparison and is formed after some certaine rule.
               
               
                  Q. What meane yee by a degree of comparison.
                  
                     R. Euery word in the adiectiue or aduerbe that altereth the signification by more or lesse is called a degree.
               
               
                  Q. Howe many degrees of comparison be there?
                  
                     R. Three. The
                  
                     Positiue.
                     Comparatiue.
                     Superlatiue.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What meane yee by the Positiue?
                  
                     R. The Positiue degree is yt very first word of ye adiectiue or Aduerbe that formeth comparison, as durus harde.
               
               
                  Q. Why, here is no signification encreased by more or lesse?
                  
                     R. It is true. For the positiue doth signifie a thing absolutely without excesse, that is to say it hath no respect of comparison with any other worde, neither doeth it encrease his signification by more or lesse, and therefore it is vnproperly called a degree of comparison.
               
               
                  Q. What call yee the comparatiue degree?
                  
                     R. That which signifieth somewhat more then the positiue, as durior harder.
               
               
                  Q. What call yee the Superlatiue degree?
                  
                     R. That which exceedeth the positiue in the highest degree, that is, which signifieth more then his positiue in all respectes. As Durissimus, hardest of all.
               
               
                  Q. And howe many rules haue ye to forme these degrees?
                  
                     R. I haue onely one rule to forme the comparatiue degree: And three to forme the superlatiue.
               
               
                  
                  Q. Howe forme ye the positiue?
                  
                     R. The positiue is not formed at all: But is the very first worde of the adiectiue or aduerbe out of whiche the comparitiue and superlatiue degree is formed.
               
               
                  Q. Which is the rule to forme the comparatiue degree?
                  
                     R. This, The comparatiue degree is formed of the first case of his positiue that endeth in i by putting to or, or vs, as Durus harde, the genitiue case is Duri, put to or and it maketh Durior, put to vs and it maketh Durius, and so the comparatiue degree of Durus, is hic & haec durior & hoc durius.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Which is your first rule for the superlatiue degree?
                  
                     R. This. The superlatiue degree is formed of the firste case of his positiue that endeth in i. by putting thereto s. and simus. As Durus the genitiue case is Duri, put to s. and it maketh Duris, and then put to simus and it maketh Durissimus, and that is the superlatiue degree.
               
               
                  Q. Is the genitiue alwayes the first case in i?
                  
                     R. Yea forsooth, in adiectiues of three terminations, but in adiectiues of three articles, the datiue is the first case in i.
               
               
                  Q. What is your seconde rule to forme the superlatiue degree?
                  
                     R. This. If the positiue do ende in er, then the superlatiue degree is not formed of the first case of his positiue that endeth in i, but of the nominatiue case of the positiue that endeth in er, by putting thereto rimus. As to Nominatiuo pulcher, I put rimus, and so the superlatiue degree is pulcherrimus.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What is your thirde rule to forme the superlatiue degree.
                  
                     R. The thirde rule is for these sixe adiectiues that ende in lis, humilis, similis, facilis, agilis, gracilis, docilis.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Is it not for all adiectiues that ende in lis as well as for these sixe?
                  
                     R. No. For all other adiectiues in lis except these sixe doe forme their superlatiue degree according to the first rule, as

                     vtilis maketh vtilissimus.
                  
               
               
                  Q. But howe do these sixe forme the superlatiue degree?
                  
                     R. Of the nominatiue case in lis, by chaunging is into limus, as humilis change is into limus and there is the superlatiue degree humillimus.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Be here all the rules for perfect comparisons?
                  
                     R. No forsooth, there be certayne nownes compounded of these verbes dico, volo, and facio, which are also referred to the perfect comparison.
               
               
                  Q. Howe doe nownes that be made of dico, volo, and facio make comparison?
                  
                     R. They make the comparatiue degree by changing us into entior, & the superlatiue by changing us into entissimus. As maledicus, maledicentior, maledicentissimus.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Be there any more rules to forme comparisons?
                  
                     R. Some call it a comparison whiche is made by these aduerbs magis and maxime.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What nownes make comparison by magis and maxime?
                  
                  
                     R. Nownes that ende in us, and haue a vowell going before us, as pius.
                  
               
               
                  Q. And howe doe they make comparison?
                  
                     R. For the comparatiue degree we put magis to the positiue: and for the superlatiue we put maxime to the positiue.
               
               
                  Q. Showe mee howe?
                  
                     R. Pius, is Latine for godly and this is the positiue degree, and for the comparatiue degree I say magis pius more Godly, and for the superlatiue I say maxime pius most Godly. So in this worde assiduus for continuall the comparatiue is magis assiduus, the superlatiue is maxime assiduus.
                  
               
               
                  Q. This is sufficient for the perfect comparisons, nowe what call you a comparison anomala or without rule.
                  
                     R. That comparison I call anomala or without rule, which although it hath all the degrees of comparison, yet it is formed after no certaine rule, as bonus, melior, optimus.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Is not this formed after a rule?
                  
                     
                     R. No, For I haue no rule to forme melior or optimus out of bonus, for according to my rule I shoulde say bonus, bonior bonissimus.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What adiectiues be of this sort of comparison?

                     R. It is true, for the Relatiue qui is numbred amongest them, because hee is declined much like vnto them, but as I sayd before, it is doubted whether he be a nowne or a Pronowne.
               
               
                  Q. What Pronownes be of the thirde Declenson?
                  
                     R. The fiue Possessiues, and be declined like nownes adiectiues

of three terminations. Sauing that meus in the Masculine gender of the vocatiue case singular maketh not mee but mi & tuus, suus, and vester doe lacke the vocatiue case.
               
               
                  Q. What Pronownes be of the fourth declenson?
                  
                     R. The two Gentiles Nostras & Vestras, and they be declined altogether like nownes adiectiues of 3. articles.
               
               
                  Q. Your Accidence rehearseth 3.
                  
                     R. It is true, for Cuias is ioyned with them, because hee is called a Gentile & declined as they be. But Cuias is a meere Nowne, & no Pronowne.
               
               
                  Q. This is sufficient for Declensons. But doth not a Pronowne forme comparison?
                  
                     R. No not properly.
               
               
                  
                     Q. Why, Ipse and tu be Pronownes, and they forme comparison, as Ipse ipsissimus, Tu Tuissimus. Ergo a Pronowne also formeth comparison?
                  
                     R. Indeede these wordes are to be founde in some writers: But this comparison in Pronownes is vnproper and out of vse, although suffered sometimes in the Poets.
               
               
                  Q. Well then, the last accident of a Pronowne is person, what call yee person?
                  
                     R. Person is the name of any thing or creature whiche is sayde to doe or suffer any thing, as well in thinges that haue no life as in liuing creatures.
               
               
                  Q. Doeth not person also chaunce to a Nowne?
                  
                     R. No not properly.
               
               
                  
                     Q. Why, the name of euery thing is a nowne, and you saye that the name of euery thing is a person, & therefore euery Nowne is a person.
                  
                     R. It is true, euery Nowne substantiue & euery Pronowne substantiue, & whatsoeuer supplieth the place of a substantiue in Grammar is a person.
               
               
                  Q. Why doe ye not say then that person belongeth as well to a Nowne as to a Pronowne?
                  
                     R. Because there is no such speciall difference of persons in nownes as there is in Pronownes. For euery nowne is

of the third person.
               
               
                  Q. How many persons be there?

                  Q. Howe knowe yee the first person?
                  
                     R. The first person is a worde that speaketh of himselfe, as I, We: And hath no more wordes in Latine of the first person properly, but Ego and Nos.
                  
               
               
                  Q. How know yee the second person?
                  
                     R. The seconde person betokeneth somewhat that is spoken to, as Thou, Yee: And hath no more words of yt person properly in Latine, but Tu, & Vos, and euery vocatiue case.
               
               
                  Q. Howe knowe yee the thirde person?
                  
                     R. The thirde person betokeneth somewhat that is spoken of, as He, They: And so all nownes Pronownes & Participles are of the third Person except Ego, Nos, Tu & Vos, and euery vocatiue case.
               
               
                  Q. To what vse serue these persons in speech?
                  
                     R. They be alwayes referred to some verbe, and I can forme no verbe in any moode or tense, except the Infinitiue, but I must alwayes haue with it one of these persons.
               
               
                  Q. Why so?
                  
                     R. For these persons in Pronownes be like to articles in nownes. For as I ioyne some of them with the nowne in declining it. So I ioyne some of these persons with the verbe in forming it.
               
               
                  Q. Which be the persons yt yee vse in forming of verbes?

                     R. No forsooth, I do not alwayes expresse the person of the

pronowne with the person of the verbe, but wheresoeuer I haue any person of a verbe, I must alwayes vnderstande one of these persons of the pronowne with it.

                     R. Because they doe concorde, that is to say, agree mutually together in some speciall accidents, so that the three latter cannot stande perfectly in speech without the three former.
               
               
                  Q. What tearmes haue ye for them in Grammar?
                  
                     R. The three former, that is, the Nominatiue case, the substantiue and the Antecedent, bee called Subiecta as it were the pillers or vpholders or vnder setters of the other.
                  The latter three, that is to say, the verbe, the Adiectiue, & the relatiue, may be called Adiecta, which we may terme in Englishe the weakelings, or the wauerers, or the leaners: because they bee of them selues wÃ¨ake and wauering, except they do as it were leane to their pillers or vndersetters.
               
               
                  Q. Howe do these Adiecta agree with their Subiecta?
                  
                  
                     R. I haue for euery one of these Concordes or agreements certaine proper rules to showe howe they doe agree together.
               
            
            
               The first Concorde.
               
                  Q. Which is the rule for the first Concorde?
                  
                     R. A verbe personall agreeth with his Nominatiue case in two things, that is, in number and person.
               
               
                  Q. Must the verbe Personall then allwayes be the same number and person that his nominatiue case is?
                  
                     R. No forsooth, not alwayes: for I haue three exceptions.
               
               
                  Q. Which be they?
                  
                     R. The first is this, when I haue moe Nominatiue cases,

then one comming together with a coniunction copulatiue betweene them, although they be all the singular number, yet my verbe must be put in the plural number, but it must bee suche person as the moste woorthie Nominatiue case is.
               
               
                  Q. Which call ye the most worthie nominatiue case?
                  
                     R. The Nominatiue case of the first person is more woorthie then the seconde, and the nominatiue case of the second person is more worthie then the thirde.
               
               
                  Q. Which is your second exception?
                  
                     R. When a verbe commeth betweene two Nominatiue cases of diuers numbers, it may indifferently accorde eyther with that which goeth before him, or with that which commeth after him, so that they bee both of one person.
               
               
                  Q. Which is the thirde exception?
                  
                     R. This. The Nominatiue case to the verbe is not alwaies a casuall worde, but sometime a whole sentence, sometime a peece of a sentence, sometime an Infinitiue mode, sometime an Aduerbe with a Genitiue case.
               
               
                  Q. What call you a casuall woorde?
                  
                     R. Such a word as is declined with cases, namely a nowne, a pronowne, and a participle.
               
               
                  Q. Howe can a whole sentence, a peece of a sentence, an infinitiue mode or an Aduerbe with a Genitiue case be Nominatiue case to the verbe?
                  
                     R. When they stande for the Nominatiue case they bee taken altogether as it were a Substantiue, and may be supposed to bee declined altogether like hoc nihil indeclinabile.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Why so?
                  
                     R. Because nothing can bee the Nominatiue case to the verbe, but a substantiue or that which is taken as a substantiue.
               
               
                  Q. Why, the relatiue may bee the Nominatiue case to the verbe, and yet he is no substantiue?
                  
                     R. The Relatiue as touching his case standeth for a

substantiue and is alwayes aunsweared to in his case seuerally as a Substantiue.
               
               
                  Q. May not an adiectiue be nominatiue case to the verbe?
                  
                     R. Yes, but then he must be put alone without a substantiue in the Newter gender, and so supply the place of a substantiue.
               
               
                  Q. What number and person shall the verbe bee when a whole sentence, a peece of a sentence, an Infinitiue mode, or an Aduerbe with a genitiue case is the nominatiue case to the verbe?
                  
                     R. If it haue respect but to one thing, it shalbe the singular number, and the thirde person. If it haue respect to moe things then one, it shalbe the plural number & 3. person.
               
               
                  Q. In making and construing Latine, where shall I put the Nominatiue case?
                  
                     R. For the most parte before the verbe: but sometime after the verbe.
               
               
                  Q. When is the Nominatiue case put after the verbe?
                  
                     R. At 3 times, when
                  
                     We aske a question.
                     the verbe is the Imperatiue mode.
                     the signe it or there commeth before ye english of ye verbe.
                  
               
               
                  Q. How will ye find out the nominatiue case to the verbe?
                  
                     R. Put the question who or what with the englishe of the verbe & the word in the sentence that answeareth that question is the nominatiue case.
               
               
                  Q. Howe many thinges may bee the nominatiue case to the verbe?
                  
                     R.

               Of the second Concord.
               
                  Q. Which is the rule of the second Concord?
                  
                     R. The Adiectiue whether it be nowne, pronowne or participle agreeth with his substantiue in 3. things, that is Case, Gender, and Number.
               
               
                  Q. Why, haue ye more Adiectiues then of nownes?
                  
                     R.
Yea forsooth.

                        Very many nownes. be adiectiues.
                        Al Pronownes sauing Ego, tu, sui, be adiectiues.
                        All Participles. be adiectiues.
                     
                  
               
               
                  Q. Is an Adiectiue alwayes the same Case, Gender, and Number that his Substantiue is?
                  
                     R. Not alwayes, for I haue 3. such exceptions as I haue in the first Concorde.
               
               
                  Q. Which is the first exception for the second Concord?
                  
                     R. Many Substantiues singular with a Coniunction Copulatiue comming betweene them will haue an Adiectiue plurall, which Adiectiue shall agree with the Substantiue of the most worthy gender?
               
               
                  Q. Which is the Substantiue of the most worthy gender?
                  
                     R. The Substantiue of the Masculine gender is more worthy then ye feminine, & the substantiue of the feminine gender is more worthy then the Newter.
               
               
                  Q. Is this euer true?
                  
                     R. Nay, for in things not apt to haue life, the Newter geÌ„
                     der is most worthy.
               
               
                  Q. Which is the second exception for the second Concord?
                  
                     R. When an Adiectiue commeth betwene two SubstaÌ„tiues of diuers Genders it may indifferently accord with either of them.
               
               
                  Q. Which is the third exception for the second concord?
                  
                     R. This, the Substantiue is not alwayes a casuall woord, but sometime a whole sentence, sometime a peece of a sentence, sometime an Infinitiue mode, and sometime an Aduerb with a Genitiue case.
               
               
                  
                  Q. What case, gender, and number, shall the Adiectiue be when any of these is his Substantiue?
                  
                     R. He shalbe such case as they are accounted to be, and if it haue respect but to one thing as one sentence, or one peece of a sentence, it shalbe the Newter Gender and singular number: but if it haue respect to moe thinges then one, or to more sentences, or more peeces of sentences it shall be the Newter Gender and plurall Number.
               
               
                  Q. How wil ye find out the substantiue to the Adiectiue?
                  
                     R. Put the question who or what to the English of ye Adiectiue, and the worde or wordes in the sentence that answere that question is the Substantiue to it.
               
               
                  Q. How many things may be substantiue to the adiectiue?
                  
                     R. Whatsoeuer is nominatiue case to the verbe, the same may be Substantiue to the Adiectiue.
               
            
            
               The third Concord.
               
                  Q. Which is the rule of the third Concord?
                  
                     R. This, the Relatiue agreeth with his Antecedent in
three thinges, that is,
                  
                     Gender.
                     Number.
                     Person.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Is the Relatiue alwayes the same gender, number, and person that his Antecedent is?
                  
                     R. Not alwayes, for I haue here the same three exceptions, that I haue in the first Concord and in the second.
               
               
                  Q. Which is the first exception for the third Concord?
                  
                     R. When I haue moe Antecedentes then one of the singular number comming together with a Coniunction copulatiue betweene them, then the Relatiue shall bee put in the plurall number, and agree in gender with the Antecedent of the most worthy gender.
               
               
                  Q. What meane yee by Antecedent?
                  
                     
                     R. The Antecedent is any such worde as goeth in the sentence before the relatiue and is rehearsed againe by the Relatiue.
               
               
                  Q. Which is the second exception for the thirde concord?
                  
                     R. When a Relatiue commeth betweene two substantiues or antecedentes of diuers genders, it may indifferently accord with eyther of them, yea though they bee both of diuers numbers also.
               
               
                  Q. Which is the third exception for the third concord?
                  
                     R. The Antecedent is not alwayes a casuall worde, but sometime a whole sentence, sometime a peece of a sentence, sometime an Infinitiue mode, sometime an Aduerbe with a genitiue case.
               
               
                  Q. What gender, number and person shall the Relatiue be when he hath any of these Antecedentes?
                  
                     R. If he haue respect but to one thing, one sentence, or one peece of a sentence: he shalbe the Newter gender, singular number and third person: but if he haue respect to moe then one: hee shalbe the Newter gender, plurall number, and third person.
               
               
                  Q. How many things may be antecedent to the Relatiue?
                  
                     R. Whatsoeuer is nominatiue case to the verbe, the same may be Antecedent to the Relatiue.
               
               
                  Q. How will yee finde out the Antecedent to the Relatiue?
                  
                     R. Put the question who or what to the English of the Relatiue, and the worde or wordes in the sentence that aunsweareth the question is the Antecedent.
               
               
                  Q. How shall I order the case of the Relatiue?
                  
                     R. The Relatiue for his case alwayes supplieth the place of a Substantiue, and must be aunsweared to seuerally as a Substantiue.
               
               
                  Q. Haue yee none other rules for the case of the Relatiue then yee haue for substantiues?
                  
                     R. Yes I haue two speciall rules for the case of the Relatiue but they are all one in effect with the rules of Substantiues.
               
               
                  Q. Which is the first rule for the case of the Relatiue?
                  
                     
                     R. When there commeth no nominatiue case betweene the Relatiue & the verbe, the Relatiue shalbe the nominatiue case to the verbe.
               
               
                  Q. Which is the second rule for the case of the Relatiue?
                  
                     R. When there commeth a nominatiue case betweene the Relatiue and the verbe: then the Relatiue shall not be the nominatiue case to the verbe: but shall be gouerned of the verbe, or of some other worde in the same sentence.
               
               
                  Q. What meane you by shalbe gouerned?
                  
                     R. To be gouerned is to be such case as the verbe or any other part of speech will haue after him.
               
               
                  Q. Then if the Relatiue be not nominatiue case to ye verb, must he not follow the verbe or some other worde in the same sentence, whereof he is gouerned?
                  
                     R. No forsooth, he must indeed be such case as the verbe or some other word in the same sentence will haue after him, but the Relatiues qui, qualis, and quantus be set before the verbe and not after.
               
               
                  Q. Howe so?
                  
                     R. For it is the nature of these Relatiues to stand before yt woorde whereof they be gouerned.
               
               
                  Q. Doth no words els stand before the words which they be gouerned of but the Relatiue?
                  
                     R. Yes, for the substantiue which is ioyned with ye Relatiue doth follow the nature of the Relatiue?
               
               
                  Q. Shew me an example of this?
                  
                     R. If the Relatiue be ioyned in like case, gender, and number with a Substantiue, if there come also an other Substantiue both the Relatiue, and the Substantiue with which he is ioyned, shall be the genitiue case, and yet shal stand before the other Substantiue, as Scaeuola nobis exposuit Lelii sermonem de amicitia, cuius disputationis sententias memoriae mandaui,
                  
               
               
                  Q. Shew me how standeth this with your rule?
                  
                     R. Here I haue Cuius disputationis sententias, wheras

the Relatiue cuius agreeth in Case, Gender, and Number, with disputation is both which in order are placed before the other Substantiue sententias, & yet are the genitiue case, because the latter of two substantiues comming together must be the genitiue case.
               
               
                  Q. But if the Relatiue be not Nominatiue case to ye verbe, what case must he then be?
                  
                     R. If he be not Nominatiue case to the verb, then looke what case any nowne substantiue shoulde be being gouerned of the same worde, the same case must the Relatiue be and by the same rule.
               
               
                  Q. How wil ye know of what word yt Relatiue is gouerned?
                  
                     R. By putting for the Relatiue the same case of hic, haec, hoc, & so construing the sentence. For then yt case of hic, haec, hoc which is put for the Relatiue will in construing follow the word that the Relatiue is gouerned of.
               
               
                  Q. In what order are the rules for the construction of euery part of speech to be considered?
                  
                     R. In such order as ye parts of speech be rehearsed in myne Accidence. The rules for the construction of
                  
                     
                        1 Nownes Substantiues.
                     
                     
                        2 Nownes Adiectiues.
                     
                     
                        3 Pronownes,
                     
                     
                        4 Verbes Personalles.
                     
                     
                        5 Gerundes.
                     
                     
                        6 Supines.
                     
                     
                        7 Verbes Impersonalles.
                     
                     
                        8 Participles, and so foorth in such order as the partes of speech be rehearsed in myne Accidence.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What order keepe ye in the placing of these rules?
                  
                     R. The rules for euery part of speech stand according to the order of the cases.
                  
                     
                        
1 First, the rules for ye nominatiue case if the part of speech gouerne a nominatiue case after him.
                     2 Secondly, the rules for the Genitiue case.
                     3 Thirdly, the rules for the Datiue case.
                     6 Fourthly, the rules for the Accusatiue case.
                     7 Lastly, the rules for the Ablatiue case.
                  
               
               
                  Q. Why leaue ye out the rules for the vocatiue case?
                  
                     R. For the vocatiue case is not gouerned of any other parte of speech except an Interiection.
               
               
                  Q. Then how knowe yee when to put a worde in the Vocatiue case?
                  
                     R. This one rule is sufficient for it. Whensoeuer I call or speake to anye thing or person it is the Vocatiue case.
               
               
                  Q. Howe will yee finde out the rule for any worde in a sentence, to know why he is put in the nominatiue, Genitiue, Datiue, Accusatiue or Ablatiue case?
                  
                     R. First I must looke what part of speech the word is which I haue to seeke out, secondly of what worde he is gouerned, thirdly what parte of speech that worde is whereof he is gouerned, lastly I must looke what case my worde is, & so shall I turne to the rules that be for that part of speech & for that case.
               
               
                  Q. Shew me it by example?
                  
                     R. If my word be a substantiue & the genitiue case, and gouerned of a nowne Adiectiue, then I turne to the rules yt I haue for Adiectiues that gouerne a genitiue case.
                  If my worde be a Substantiue, the genitiue case, & gouerned of a verbe, then I turne to my rules for verbes which gouerne a genitiue case. Then I consider of what signification ye worde is whereof he is gouerned, and so I take the rule that agreeth to that signification.
               
               
                  Q. But how wil yee knowe of what woorde the same case which you seeke is gouerned?
                  
                     R. That must bee learned by diligent marking howe the

sentence is construed.
               
               
                  Q. Why so?
                  
                     R. Because euery case is gouerned of that worde which goeth next before him in the naturall construing of a sentence.
               
               
                  Q. What meane yee by construing?
                  
                     R. Construing is the right placing of euery word yt is written in a sentence, in the naturall order of speech, & giuing to euery word his proper signification in english.
               
               
                  Q. Shew me howe?
                  
                     R. Virtutis comes est inuidia. This sentence is construed thus. Inuidia enuy, est is, comes yt companion, virtutis of vertue.
               
               
                  Q. If ye haue a sentence giuen to be construed, what order wil ye keep in englishing and placing of euery word?
                  
                     R. Diuers men teach diuersly, but this way is playne and not vnprofitable. If there be any vocatiue case in the sentence I take that first. Secondly, the Nominatiue case, or that which is put in steede of the nominatiue case, and to him I adioyne any woord that hangeth vppon him. Then take I the verbe Personall. Then the Aduerb. After this the cases in their owne order. The Accusatiue case next after the verbe, and that whiche hangeth vppon him, then the Genitiue, and so the Datiue, and last the Ablatiue.
               
               
                  Q. What if there be not al these kinds of words in yt seÌ„teÌ„ce?
                  
                     R. Then take so many of them as be in it, and in this order, and alwayes take heede that ye put that case next after the verb, which yt verb doth properly gouerne after him, & theÌ„ the other cases in order.
                  The Accusatiue case goeth before the Infinitiue Mode, the Infinitiue comes after any other mode. The Adiectiue and the Substantiue must be construed togither except one of theÌ„ doth passe ouer his signification into some other worde.
               
               
                  Q. May this order be alwayes kept?
                  
                     R. No forsooth, for it is broken many times by the cases of Relatiues, Interrogatiues, Infinitiues & Genitiues of

partition and by some Coniunctions &c.
               
               
                  Q. If you haue an english giuen to be made in latine, what must you doe?
                  
                     R. First I must looke out the principall verbe in the sentence.
               
               
                  Q. Howe will ye finde out the principall verbe?
                  
                     R. It is alwayes the first verbe, except the first verbe bee the Infinitiue mode, or haue before it a Relatiue or a Coniunction.
               
               
                  Q. What will yee doe when yee haue founde out the principall verbe?
                  
                     R. Then I must seeke out his Nominatiue case.
               
               
                  Q. What seeke yee out after the Nominatiue case?
                  
                     R. After I haue made the verbe and his Nominatiue case, I consider what part of speech euery worde in the sentence is beside these: and then I ioyne them in suche order as I doe in construing of a sentence, and so make euery one of them into latine.
               
            
            
               For the Genders of Nownes.
               
                  Q. Howe will yee finde out the genders of a Nowne?
                  
                     R. I haue certayne rules in Latine verses for the Genders of nownes.
               
               
                  Q. Howe will yee seeke out the Gender of a Nowne by these rules.
                  
                     R. First, I must looke whether it bee a proper name or a common.
               
               
                  Q. What if it be a proper name?
                  
                     R. Then I haue two generall rules for his gender.
               
               
                  Q. Which be they?
                  
                     R.
                     
                        The first is this.
Propria quae maribus tribuuntur mascula dicas. &c.
                        
                        
                        The second is this.
Propria faemineum referentia nomina sexum,
                           Faemineo geneti tribuuntur.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  Q. Howe will yee knowe whether it bee a proper name or no?
                  
                     R. If it be a proper name, it is one of these ten.
As proper names of

                        Gods. 
                        Men.
                        Fluddes.
                        Moneths
                        Windes.
                     
And these be all the masculine gender.

                        Goddesses
                        Women.
                        Cities.
                        Countreis
                        Ilandes.
                     
& these bee all ye feminine gender for the most part.
               
               
                  Q. Be not all those latter fyue the feminine gender aswell as all the first fiue be the masculine.
                  
                     R. No, for certaine names of Cities be excepted?
               
               
                  Q. What gender be those that be excepted?
                  
                     R. These two of the masculine gender, Sulmo, Agragas, these of the newter gender, Argos, Tibur, Preneste.
                  
                  This one Anxur, which is sometime the masculine, sometime the newter.
               
               
                  Q. What if your nowne be no proper name?
                  
                     R. Then I must looke whether it be not the name of a tree.
               
               
                  Q. What if it be the name of a tree?
                  
                     R. Then I haue this rule for him.
                  
                     Appellatiua arborum erunt muliebria vt alnus.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What gender must your nowne be by this rule?
                  
                     R. The feminine.
               
               
                  Q. Be all names of trees the feminine gender?
                  
                     R. No.
               
               
                  Q. Then howe will ye knowe the gender of such Nownes as do not agree with the rule?
                  
                     R. All suche nownes as doe not agree with the rule, eyther be rehearsed by name strayght after the rule, or els there is some speciall rule of exeception set downe for them.
               
               
                  Q. What nownes haue ye excepted from this rule.
                  
                     R. Two of the Masculine gender, Pinus and Oleaster
                     
fiue of the Newter gender, Siler, Suber, Thus, Robur, and Acer.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What if your nowne be neyther proper name nor name of a tree?
                  
                     R. Then he is a nowne common, or a nowne appellatiue.
               
               
                  Q. Howe will yee seeke out the gender of a nowe appellatiue?
                  
                     R. First, I must looke in his genetiue case whether it doth encrease or no.
               
               
                  Q. Why so?
                  
                     R. For I haue three speciall rules referred to the genitiue case of a nowne common, whereby I may learne his gender.
               
               
                  Q. Which be they?
                  
                     R. The first is, Nomen non crescens Genitiuo seu caro carnis. &c.
The seconde is
NomeÌ„ crescentis penultima si Genitiui, syllaba accuta sonet. &c.
The thirde is,
Nomen crescentis Penultima, si Genitiui fit grauis. &c.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What maner of no wnes belong to your first rule?
                  
                     R. All such as doe not increase in the Genitiue case?
               
               
                  Q. When are nownes sayd to increase in the genitiue case?
                  
                     R. When they haue mo syllables in the Genitiue case then they haue in the Nominatiue.
               
               
                  Q. What gender then must those nownes bee, by this rule which doe not increase in the Genitiue case?
                  
                     R. All those whiche doe agree with the rule be the feminine gender.
               
               
                  Q. Did you not say that all nownes which do not increase in the Genitiue case doe agree with the rule?
                  
                     R. No forsooth, I sayde in deede that all nownes which doe not increase in the genitiue case do belong to the first rule

but all they doe not agree with the rule.
               
               
                  Q. What difference do ye put betweene these two wordes belonging and agreeing.
                  
                     R. I count all those to belong to the rule whiche bee of the same sort of nownes that the rule is made for, though they bee not the same gender whiche the rule appointes them to bee: but I count none to agree with the rule but suche as both bee of the same sortes of Nownes, that the rule is made for, & also be the same gender that the rule appointes them to bee.
               
               
                  Q. Then what gender bee those nownes that be excepted from this first rule.

                  Q. Howe will yee seeke out the preterperfect tense of a verbe?
                  
                     R. I haue certaine rules in latine verses for the forming of them.

                     R. First, I must looke whether the verbe be simple or compounde.

                     R. Because the preterperfect tense of a compounde verbe is most commonly made of the preterperfect tense of the simple verbe, of which he is compounded.
               
               
                  Q. What if your verbe be simple?

                  Q. Why so?
                  
                     R. Because the preterperfect tense of verbes in or be formed of the latter supine of verbes in o.
                  
               
               
                  Q. What if your verbe ende in o?
                  
                  
                     R. If the verbe ende in o and be eyther of the first, the second or the fourth Coniugation: I shall finde out his preterperfect tense by that rule which is made for the termination of the seconde person singuler of the presentense of the indicatiue mode or by the rules of exception.
