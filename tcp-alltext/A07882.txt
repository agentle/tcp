Anglam,
                     Ni diuina nouam dextra tulisset opem?
                     Reginam eripuit, sed regem tradidit,
orba
                     Quae sine matre dolet, nè sine patre foret.
                     Reginam eripuit, qualem non viderat antè,
                     Nec visura aetas vlla futura parem.
                     Spem rex ipse suis laetam virtutibus affert,
                     Quod toto regni tempore talis erit,
                     Qualem praemonuit moriens regina futurum,

                  Who though he tooke our Queene, a King
he gaue
                  To play the fathers part in mothers losse.
                  He tooke away our Queene, whose match no age
                  Hath euer seen before, or after shall.
                  The Kings most royall vertues feed our hope
                  That he will prooue so good the time he raignes,
                  As when our dying Queene pronounc'd him heire

She rests in heauen, in bosome of her God,
                  Of whom when I haue said what I shall say,
                  The world shall see how great a good we lost.
                  No sooner was this royall infant borne,
                  And left her mothers wombe to enter light,
                  But Gods foreseeing care, by many signes,
                  Accompaning her first cradle-time, bewraid
                  What rate he held her at, how he loued her,
                  And in her sex how rare she was to prooue.
                  Then he first shew'd his word vnto this land:
                  Then he commaunded Pope to part the realme,
                  Who though as then he were not quite cut off,
                  His superstitious rights remaining still,
                  Yet he then shew'd the way how being Queene
                  She might in time make him auoid the land:
                  And that she might with greater fame and wit
                  Thereafter rule the reines of Royall state,
                  How tri'd he her with change and choise of chance
                  Not onely in her first, but after yeares?
                  What greater signe of Gods great loue to her,
                  What stronger proofe that once she should be great,
                  Than to allot her youth such speciall things,
                  Whereby to prooue a wise and godly Prince?
                  Now when she gan to be of riper yeares;
                  Her personage appear'd for beautie rare,
                  Her cariage full of majestie and state,
                  Whereby she wan the loue of euerie looke:
                  But that which wrought in her the greatest grace,
                  Was truth in store bestowed in her heart,
                  
                     
The great indowments of her Royall mind,
                  Which she did learne as fast as princely braine
                  With judgement fraught, could possibly conceaue.
                  All this she learned so as it appear'd
                  That God had bred her vp to be a Queene,
                  Which gifts of princely mind then beam'd abroad,
                  When hauing got her fathers crowne on head,
                  She did shew forth the treasures of her heart.
                  When she first tooke the Scepter in her hand,
                  Euen then professing here the heauenly truth,
                  How quietly entred she, and with what peace?
                  All the Romish rout, which swarming here
                  With open throats, did thirst to see her fall:
                  Though all our neighbour lands, then priestly slaues,
                  Though forrein Kings and princes threw out threats,
                  Bicause they were bewitcht with Romish rags,
                  Yet she with hope in God, and checke to feare,
                  What truth did teach, that she did still desend:
                  And England of it selfe now free from feare
                  Of forrein princes yoake, was glad of her,
                  Who being staid in throne and princely seat,
                  How mightie things, how borne to liue did she?
                  Still constant, still the same, still in one course
                  Directing all the time that she did raigne.
                  What she enacted once, she held it fast,
                  Aswell what toucht the Church, as ciuill state:
                  No change of hands, from right vnto the left
                  Was she acquainted with, but still forth right.
                  Her gratious God so sauoured this her raigne,
                  
                     
Which she religiously maintained thus,
                  As if she did not quite surpasse all those
                  Which heretofore had raigned in this land:
                  At least she matcht the brauest of them all.
                  In all her great attempts victorious still.
                  If she with armed hand bar'd forrein foes:
                  If with the like she daunted stirs at home:
                  If with assisting aid she sought to free
                  Her neighbours, crauing helpe from seruile yoke,
                  The God of heauen did guide her still to gaine.
                  Oft times assail'd by false and treacherous meane,
                  Wherewith the Iesuites sought to sucke her blood,
                  She felt her God to saue her with his sheeld,
                  Which taking edge from sword, and charge from dagge,
                  From poyson strength to doe her any harme,
                  Bad her goe on, bad her abandon feare,
                  That he would be both guide and guard to his.
                  But were it not a mightie fault to hide
                  The royall gifts wherewith she was endow'd?
                  Her knowledge and her skill, the only meane
                  Which doth adornea noble royall wit?
                  Her learning did surmount her sex and kind.
                  She had obtain'd the chiefe and learned tongues,
                  Whereby she knew what things were to be knowne.
                  Vpon these grounds and learning of her owne,
                  She fauour'd so all people that were learn'd,
                  As both th' Vniuersities felt by Royall graunt
                  The benefits wherewith she priuiledged them:
                  As euerie shire so warranted from her,
                  
                     
Found many a schoole well founded for their youth
                  To bring them vp at first, whom afterward
                  The Vniuersities were to feed with stronger meats,
                  These qualities of hers so rare in woman kind
                  She did not hide, but shew'd them to the sunne.
                  In all her time so gouerning her estate,
                  As all the world did wonder at her wit.
                  Which kind of gouernment and blessed course
                  Great potentates abroad in forrein parts
                  Did so admire, as they forthwith did send
                  Their Embassies to her with true desire,
                  To craue and haue her friendship and her loue:
                  Whose answere was return'd in sort so wise,
                  And in that tongue which they themselues did vse:
                  (A thing for wonder rare, beyond beleefe,
                  To find in that weake sex so strong a gift,
                  But that her selfe past wonder, past beleefe)
                  As they were all amaz'd, and comming home
                  Reported to their Lords the thing they scant beleeu'd,
                  So strange a prince had God giuen to this world
                  Truth to maintaine and falshood for to mate.
                  Besides all these, great troups of noble men
                  Rapt with the fame and honour of her name,
                  Desiring to see whereof they heard so much,
                  With gladsome hearts repaired to this Realme:
                  And as they came with gladnesse for to see,
                  So they departed glad when they had seen.
                  Her entertainment was in such a sort,
                  For majestie of state and princely cheere,
                  
                     
As in all points she did content them all.
                  Nay, diuers noble Dames whom like desire,
                  Enflamed for to see the object of their eares,
                  Did vndertake the way though nere so long
                  By sea, by land to see that they did seeke:
                  What honour were these things to this our Isle?
                  What glorie to all those of that her sex?
                  That forraine lands should send both Ladies and Lords
                  To heare our princes voice, to see her face,
                  To kisse her faire and tender royall hand.
                  This was her publicke course in case of state,
                  Whereof the world each where eye witnesse was.
                  Now as she was addicted still to heare,
                  Or priuatly to read some learned booke,
                  She neuer brook't, nor could with patience beare
                  What she perceiu'd vnseeming for a Prince,
                  But as her choice was euer of the best
                  And chiefest that did write in any tongue,
                  So what she found to be sincere and pure,
                  That did she note and laid it vp in store,
                  VVhat was not such, as sorie she had red
                  That she exil'd both from her eie and eare.
                  If ought came by the way while she did read,
                  VVhich smelt of blood or cruell tyrants hand,
                  Her selfe rejected straight, and willed him
                  That red with her, to read the same alone,
                  And after tell it her in milder phrase.
                  Nay farther, if the lawes by force of right
                  Condemned any one for crime to die,
                  
                     
None was more loath to yeeld to such a death,
                  None more desired to respit time for life
                  Her nature was so mild, her heart so kind,
                  As paine or death deseru'd could hardly winne,
                  Though law and justice both did bid her strike.
                  Besides when any of her priuate traine
                  Did painfully perfourme his charge in truth,
                  How would she cherish him with courteous termes,
                  Alluring euerie heart to yeeld her loue,
                  Of which her gentle course well fitting her.
                  This may be brought for proofe, that being sicke,
                  No Ladie of her suit refused paines
                  By night, by day, to saue their princes health,
                  But euerie one with danger of their owne,
                  Did seeke to saue her life whom they so lou'd:
                  And as the women did, so did the men
                  VVith earnest care in dutie to perfourme
                  That sorrowfull seruice, with losse of prince to liue.
                  By nature such she was, by vertue such
                  As none deny'd her loue, where she did like.
                  To knit the last with least, whatsoeuer thing,
                  She vndertooke, to daunce, to play, to sing,
                  Or what so else a modest Queene might doe,
                  That she perfourm'd with majestie and grace,
                  That it became the place, that it beseem'd a Queene.
                  Now drawing neere to death, she stay'd on still,
                  The faith she held in life she kept in death,
                  That though they which were neere her when she dyed,
                  VVere for her death in paine and extreame griefe,
                  And could haue wisht her longer time to liue:
                  
                     
Yet they rejoic'd to see her so depart
                  As in her death they saw a present life:
                  For at her death she did remember well
                  Both what concern'd her soule, her heauenly state,
                  And how she must depart without delay,
                  As when her soule her mortall bodie left
                  VVith triumph she did mount straight into heauen.
                  Nor when she died, she did forget hers here,
                  As many mothers doe forget their babes,
                  But left vs such a King whose vertues might
                  Abridge the griefe which lacke of her might breed.
                  This was her end, this was her liues last act
                  VVith clap of hands for sorrow, but not for joy,
                  For who can but bewaile the losse of such a prince?
                  What time can serue to stint the streame of wosull teares?
                  For who is't we haue lost? a prince whom man did not,
                  But God alone did choose protector of his word,
                  The trumpet of his truth, a mother to vs all,
                  Apillar to all peace, a death to all debate.
                  The honour of her sex, a Queene surmounting match,
                  Of whom when all is said, all is not enough.
                  I must confesse we haue just cause to grieue,
                  But yet two greater grounds rebate our griefe
                  The first because her age, her seauentie yeares
                  Had made her ripe, and readie for to die.
                  If she had been before a maried Qneene,
                  Or not hauevs'd a diet low and spare,
                  Her life had not endur'd in strength so long.
                  She died in happie raigne, not feeling crosse
                  Belou'd at home, admir'd abroad, a matchlesse prince,
                  
                     
So that it seems she changed onely place
                  By such a blessed death cal'd vp to heauen,
                  VVhere here on earth she raignd in fits of care.
                  Now who so shall bewaile one dying so,
                  So throughly bles'd, in state so perfect good,
                  He shall not seeme to mourne for her he mones,
                  But to lament for losse of priuate gaine.
                  And yet an earnest loue cannot but mourne,
                  VVhen cause whence loue did rise hath his recourse
                  VVhich bred and borne on ground that beares it vp,
                  Cannot be tyred at all with shed of teares.
                  The second cause which ought to stay our griefe,
                  And that may seeme the proper cure to care
                  Is, that the Queene, when death approched her,
                  Did stint where all our griefe for her should stay,
                  By pointing vs a King, and that a man
                  Accustomed to rule: one of our English blood,
                  VVhich all his time hath fostered vp Gods truth,
                  A friend to peace, a prince of mightie skill,
                  To whom our Queene, our good Elizabeth
                  
                  Did yeeld, as to a prince her peere each way,
                  So that although we grieue for losse of her,
                  Yet this one close should knit vp all our griefe,
                  For that by her owne choise and right of blood,
                  VVe haue a King to turne our greefe to joy.
                  Now my liege Lord, successour to my Queene,
                  The greatest King that Brittish soyle hath seene,
                  Thou seest a mightie patterne in thine eie
                  A maiden prince which ruled so this state,
                  
                     
As to match her tis much, to passe her more.
                  Wherefore thy charge is doubled in our eyes,
                  VVhich are in hope that thou wilt follow her steps,
                  And rule as she did raigne with equall praise,
                  Which thing that thou maist doe both long, and safe, and sound,
                  Thou must of force with lesuites be at warre,
                  VVhose doctrine is to spare no princes blood,
                  To rob them of their state, to rob them of their liues,
                  VVith fire and sword to force them for to yeeld:
                  If they, (though God himselfe forbid the same)
                  Yeeld not their royall necks to popish foot,
                  The blood of Kings is Iesuites inke to write,
                  That liquour is it must make their Rubricks red.
                  Will he spare Iames our King, which spared not our Queen?
                  Will he forbeare a man, which preyed vpon a maid?
                  She though she caught him oft, yet spar'd him oft,
                  Which hope in him is dead through such a King,
                  Who hath from Gods owne mouth commandement giuen,
                  With double paine the bloody Babilon to pine:
                  That is his will that gaue King Iames a triple Crowne:
                  A triple Crowne? what's that? a fatall terme, that is
                  The triple Brittish Crowne, the Romish bane.
                  As good Elizabeth raignes most happie now in heauen,
                  So happie may King Iames raigne long with vs in earth:
                  And as she did auoid the Iesuites treacherous traines,
                  Whereby she gat her graue in drie and quiet death,
                  So good King Iames goe late to God and slip their snares,
                  For if thou stick'st to God, they'l not sticke to sticke thee.
