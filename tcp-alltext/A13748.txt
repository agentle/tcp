            ¶Vnto the Chriſten Reader.
            
               GRace and peace in oure lorde Ieſu Chriſte. Reade here with iudgemente goode reader the examinacion of the blſſed man of god / and there thou ſhalt caſelye perceyue wherfore oure holy chirch a

                the moſt on holy ſorte of all the people wilbe called) make all their examinaciōs in darkenes / all the laye people cleane excluded from their councels. For yf their lies had ben openly confuted and alſo that the accuſed of hereſye myghte as well haue ben admytted to reaſon their articles with councell / whether they were hereſye or no as the accuſed of treaſon agenſt the king / is admytted to his councell to confute his cauſe and articles whether they be treaſon or not / they ſhulde neuer haue murthered nor priſoned ſo many good chriſten men as they haue done. For their cloked lyes coulde neuer haue contynued ſo long in the lighte / as they haue done in corners. They good men when they / come in the pulpet and preache agenſt the treuth / crye: Yf their lernynge were goode and trew / they wold neuer go in corners / but ſpeke it openly. Where vnto I anſwere that beſyde that Chriſte and his apoſtles were compelled (for becauſe of the furyouſnes of their fathers the biſhoppes and preaſtes) whiche onely that tyme alſo wolde

be called holy chyrche) often tymes for to walke ſecretly / and abſent them ſelf and geue place to their malice? yet we haue daylye examples off more then one or two / that haue not ſpared nor feared for to ſpeake and alſo preache opnlye the trouthe whiche haue ben taken of them pryſoned and brent / beſyde other that for feare of deathe haue abiured and caryed fagottes. Of whos articles and examinacion there ys no leye man that can ſhewe a worde. Who can tell wherfore (not many yeres paſte) there were ſeuen burnt in conuentrye on one daye? Who can tell wherfore that good preaſte and holye martyr Syr Thomas hitton was brente / now thys yere / at maydſtone yn Kent? I am ſure no man. For this is their caſte euer when they haue put to deathe or punyſhed any man / after their ſecrete examynacyon / to ſlaunder hym of ſoche thynges as he neuer thought. As they maye do well Inough: ſeynge there is no man to contrarye them. Wherfore I exhorte the good brother / who ſoeuer thou be that redeſt thys treatyſe / marke hit well and conſyder it ſeryouſlye / and there thou ſhalt fynde not onelye what the chyrche ys / theyre doctryne of the Sacramente / the worſhyppynge off ymagyes / pylgremage / confeſſyon / Swerynge and payinge of tythes? But alſo thou mayſt ſe what ſtronge and ſubſtancyall argumentes off ſcripture and doctoures / and what clerkely reaſons / my lorde / the

hedde and prymate of the holye chyrche in England (as he wilbe taken) bryngeth agenſt this pore / folyſh / ſymple / and madde loſell / knave / & heretike as he calleth hym. And alſo the verye cauſe wherfore all their examynacions are made in darkenes. And the lorde of all lyght ſhall lighten the with the candle of his grace / for to ſe the trewth. Amen.

               THe Lorde god that knoweth all thinges worteth well that I am right ſorrowfull for to write or to make knowen this ſentē
               ce beneth written where that of myne even chriſtē ſette in hie ſtate and dignite ſo gret blyndnes ād malice maye be knowē that they that preſume of them ſelfe to diſtroye vices and to plante in men vertues / nother drede to offēde god nor luſte to pleaſe him as their warkes ſhow. For certes the biddinge of god & his lawe / whiche in the prayſynge of his moſt holy name / he commaundeth to be knowen and kepte of all men and women / younge and olde▪ after the cōnynge and power yt he hath gyuen to them / the prelates of this lande and their myniſters / with the comente of preſtys chefely conſentyng to them / enforce them moſte beſyly to withſtonde and deſtroye the holy ordinaunce of god. And there thorowe / god is greatly wrothe and moeuyd to take harde vengeaunce not onely vpon them that doo the evyll / but alſo on thē all that conſent to theſe Antichriſtys lymnes: Which knowe or might knowe their malyce ād their falſhode / and dreſſe them not to withſtond their malice and their greate pryde. Neuertheleſſe fower thinges moueth me to writeth is ſentence beneth. The fyrſt thinge that moeueth me hereto is this / that wher as it was knowē to certeyn

frendes yt I came frō the preſon of Shrewiſbury: and as it befell in dede that I ſhulde to the preſon of Canterbury: than diuerſe frendes in diuerſe places ſpake to me full hartefully and full tenderly: and commaunded me thē yf it ſo were that I ſholde be examined before ye Archebiſhope of Canterbury / that if I mygh
                  •
               e in ony wiſe / I ſholde writte myne appoſinge and myne anſweringe. And I promyſed to my ſpeciall frendes / that yf I might / I wolde gladly do their biddinges as I might. The .ij. thing that moueth me to write this ſentence is thys / diuerſe frendes which haue herde that I haue ben examined before ye Archebiſſhop / haue comen to me in priſon and councelled me beſely / and coueted greatly that I ſhulde do the ſame thynge. And other brethrē haue ſent to me & required me on goddes behalf yt I ſhold write out & make knowē both myne appoſing & myne anſwerīg for ye profet yt (as they ſaye) ouer my knowlegīg may come therof. But this they badde me yt I ſhold be beſye in all my wittes to go as nere ye ſentēce & ye wordes as I coulde both that were ſpokē to me ād yt I ſpake. Vp auēture this writing came a nother tyme before ye Archebiſhope & his counſell. And of this coūſelling I was right glad: for in my cōſciēce I was moued to do this thing / & to aſke hereto ye ſpeciall helpe of god. And ſo thā I conſidering ye great deſyre of diuerſe frēdes of ſondry places according all in one: I occupied all my mynde & my

writtes ſo beſyly yt thorow goddes grace I perceyued by their meyning & their charitable deſyre ſome profete might come ther throwe. For ſothe faſteneſſe & trouth hath theſe cōdiciōs. Where euer it is impugned: yt hath a ſwete ſmell & thereof comes a ſwete ſavoure. And ye more violently ye enemyes dreſſe thē ſelf to oppreſſe & to withſtond ye truthe ye greater & the ſweter ſmell cometh therof. And therfore this heuēly ſmell of goddes worde will not as a ſmoke paſſe awaye with the wynde: but it will deſcend and reſte in ſome clene ſouleth at thruſteth ther after. And thus ſomedele by this wrytynge maye be perceyued throwe goddes grace how yt the enemies of the truthe ſtanding boldely in ther malice enforce thē to witſtonde ye fredome of chriſtes goſpell / for which fredome Chriſte became mā / and ſhedde his herte bloode. And therfore it is great pytte and ſorowe that many mē & women do their awne weywart will: nor beſye them not to knowe nor to doo the pleſaunt will of God. Ye / men and women that heare the truthe and ſothefaſteneſſe / and heare or knowe of this / perceyuynge what is now in the chyrche / ought here throwe to be the more moued in all there wittes to able them to grace / and to ſett leſſer pryſe by them ſelf / that they without tariynge forſake wilfully and bodely all the wrechedneſſe off thys lyfe / ſyns they knowe not howe ſoone / nor whā / nor where / nor by whome god will teache them & aſſaye their pacience. For no doute who

that euer will lyue piteouſly that is charytably in Chriſte Ieſu ſhall ſuffer now here in this lyfe perſecucyon in one wyſe or a nother / that is if we ſhall be ſauyd: Yt behouyth vs to ymagyn full beſyly / the vilite and foulneſſe of ſynne and howe the lorde god is diſpleaſyd therfore: ād ſo of this vilite of hydouſneſſe of ſynne it behouyth vs to beſye vs in all our wyttes for to abhorre & holde in our mynde a greate ſhame of ſynne euer / and ſo than we owe to ſorowe hartely therfore / ād euer fliyng all occaſyō therof. And thā behooueth vs to take vpon vs ſharpe penaunce contynuynge therin for to obteyne of the lord forgeueneſſe of oure fore done ſynnes / and grace to abſtayne vs hereafter from ſynne. And but yf we enforſe vs to doo this wilfully / and inconuenient tyme / the lorde (yf he will not vtterly deſtroye and caſte vs awaye) will in diuerſe maners moue tyrantes ageynſt vs for to conſtreyne vs violently for to do penaunce / whiche we wolde not do wilfully. And truſte that thys doynge ys a ſpeciall grace of the Lorde / and a great token of lyfe and mercy. And no doute who euer will not applye him ſelfe (as is ſeyd before) to ponyſhe hym ſelfe wilfully / nother will ſuffer paciently mekely and gladly the rodde of the Lorde howe ſo euer that he wyll punyſſhe hym: their waywarde wylles and their ynpacience are vnto them earnyſte of euerlaſtyng dampnacyon. But becauſe there are but fewe in numbre that do able them thus faythfully

to grace for to lyue here ſymply ād purely and wythout gall of malyce and of grudgyng herefore the louers of thys worlde hate and perſue them that they knowe pacyent / meke / chaſte and wylfully poere / hatyng and fleyng all worldly vanites and fleſſhely luſtes. For ſuerly their vertuouſe condicyons ar euen contrary to the maners of thys worlde. The thyrde thyng that moeuyth me to wryte thys ſētēceys thys. I thought I ſhall beſye me in myſelfe to doo feythfully that all men and women occupiyng all their beſynes in knowyng and in kepyng of goddys cōmaundmentys able them ſo to grace that they myght vnderſtonde treuly the treuthe & haue and vſe verteu & prudence: & ſo to ſerue to be lychrenyd from aboue wyth heuenly wyſdom: ſo that all their wordys & their workys may be hereby made pleſaunt ſacrifices vnto the lorde god: ād not onely for helpe for their owne ſoulys but alſo for edificacyon of all holy chyrche. For I doute not but all they that wyll applye thē to haue thys foreſeyd beſyneſſe ſhall profere full mekyll both to frendys and to foes. For ſome enemyes of ye treut he throwe the grace of god ſhall throwe charitable folkes be made aſtoonyd in their conſcience / and parauē

ſētēce is thys I knowe my ſodeyn & vnwarnyd appoſyng & anſueryng yt all they yt wyll of goode harte wythout feynyng able thē ſelf wifully and gladly after their connyng ād their powere to folowe chriſte paciently / trauelyng beſyly pryuely and apertly in worke and in worde to withdrawe who ſo euer that they may from vyces plantyng in them (yf they may) vertues / cōfortyng them and fortheryng them that ſtondyeth in grace: ſo that therwyth they be not borne vp into veyne glorye throwe preſumpcyon of their wyſdome / nor enflamyd wyth any worldly proſperite: but euer meake ād paciente / purpoſyng to abyde ſtedfaſtely in the wyll of god ſuffryng wylfully and gladly wythout onye grutchyng what ſo euer rodde the lorde wyll chaſtyſe them wyth: than thys goode lorde wyll not forget to comforte all ſoch men and women in all their tribulacyons / and at euery poynte of temptacyō that any enemye purpoſyth for to doo ageynſt them. Soche feythfull louers ſpecially / and pacient folowers of chryſte / the lorde ſendyth hys wyſdome from aboue to them: whych the aduerſaries of the treuthe may not knowe nor vnderſtonde. But throwe their olde and newe vnſhamefaſte ſynnes thoſe tyrantys and enemyes of ſouthfaſtneſſe ſhall be ſo blynded and obſtynate in euyll that they ſhall wene themſelf to doo pleſaunt ſacrifyces vnto the lorde god in their malicyouſe and wrongfull perſewyng and deſtroyeng of innocent mennys and womens bodyes

whych men and women for their vertuouſe lyuyng and for their trew knoulegyng of the treuythe & their pacyent wilfull & gladde ſufferyng of perſecutyon for ryghteuouſnes deſerue throw the grace of god to be heyres of the endleſſe blyſſe of heuen. And for the feruent deſyre and the great loue that thoſe men haue as to ſtāde in ſothefaſteneſſe & wytneſſe of yt / though they ben ſodenly & vnwarnyd brought forthe to be appoſyd of their aduerſaries: the holy goſte: yet that moeuyth & reulyth them throw hys charite wyll in the houre of their anſueryng ſpeake in them & ſhewe hys wyſdome that all their enemyes ſhall not again ſeye nor againſt ſtande lawfully. And therefore all they that are ſtedfaſte in the feythe of god / ye / whych thorowe diligēt kepyng of hys comaūdementys / & for their paciēt ſufferyng of what ſo euer aduerſite that cometh to them / hope ſurely in hys mercy: purpoſyng to ſtande contynually in perfyte charite For thoes mē and women drede not ſo the aduerſites of thys lyfe that they wyll feare (after their connyng ād their power) to knowlege prudently the truethe of goddys worde / when / where / and to whome that they thynke their knoulegyng may profete Ye & though therefore perſecutyon come to thē in one wyſe or a nother / certes thei paciētly take hit knowyng their cōuerſaciō to be in heuē. Yt ys an hye rewarde & a ſpeciall grace of god for to haue & enioye as ye euerlaſtyng inheritaunce of heuen / for the ſufferyng

of one perſecutyon in ſo ſhorte tyme as ys the terme of thys lyfe. For lo thys heuenly heritage and endleſſe rewarde is the lorde god him ſelfe wych ys the beſte thyng that may be. Thys ſentēce wytneſſyth ye lorde god hym ſelfe wheras he ſeyd to Abrahā I am thy mede. And as the lorde ſeyd he was and ys the mede of Abraham: ſo heys of all hys other ſeyntys Thys moſte bleſſyd and beſte mede he graunt to vs all for hys holy name that made vs of nought / ād ſent hys onely moſte deare woorthy ſonne / our lorde Ieſu chriſte for to redeme vs wyth hys moſte preciouſe harte bloode Amen.
            
               KNowen be yt to all men yt rede or heare thys writyng benethe: that on the ſondaye next after the feſte of ſeynt Peter / that we call lammeſſe in the yeare of our lorde a .M.CCCC. and .vij. yeare. I william of Thorpe beyng in preſon in the caſtell of Saltwode was brought before Thomas Arundell Archebyſſhope of Canterbury and Chaunceler than of Ingland. And when that I came to hym / he ſtoode in a great chāber & moch people aboute hym: & when that he ſawe me he wēt faſte into a cloſett byddyng all ſeculer men that folowed hym to go forth from hym ſone / ſo that no mā was left than in that cloſet but ye Archebyſſhop hymſelfe ād a phyſician yt was callyd Malueren perſon of ſeynt Dunſtanys in London & other two perſonys vnknowen to me whych

ware minyſterys of ye lawe. And I ſtādyng before thē by & by the Archebyſſhop ſeyd to me William / I know well yt thou haſt thys twēty wynter & more trauelyd about beſyly in ye north contre & in other diuerſe contres of Inglād ſowyng about falſe doctrine / hauyng great buſyneſſe yf thou myght wyth thyne vntrew reachyng & ſhrewyd wyll for to enfecte and poyſon all this lāde. But through ye grace of god thou art now wythſtondyd & brought in to my warde / ſo yt I ſhall now ſequeſter the from thyne euyll purpoſe / & lett yt to enuenyme ye ſhepe of my prouynce. Neuer the leſſe ſeynt Paul ſeythe Yf it may be as ferre as in vs ys we owe to haue peace wyth all men. Therfore William yf thou wyll now mekely & of goode harte / without onye feynyng / knele downe & leye thy hāde apō a booke ād kyſſe yt promyſyng feythfully as I ſhall here charge the that thou wilt ſubmytthe to my correccyon / & ſtāde to myne ordinaūce / & fulfyll yt dewly by all thy connyng & power: thou ſhall yet fynde me gracyouſe vnto ye. Than ſeyd I to ye Archebyſſhop. Syr ſyns ye deme me an heretyke out of beleue wyll ye gyue me here audiēce to tell my beleue. And he ſeyd / ye tell on. And I ſeyd I beleue yt ther is not but one god almyghty / & in thys god heed and of thys godhede a

                   thre perſones / yt is ye fader / ye ſonne ād the ſothe faſte holy goſte. And I beleue that all thes thre perſones ar euen in power & in connyng ād in myght full of grace & of all goodneſſe For what

                  
                     •

                  hyng alſo ye ſonne dothe & can and wyll: ād in all their power connyng & wyll ye holy goſte ys equall to the father & to ye ſonne. Ouer thys I beleue that thrugh coūſell of thys moſte bleſſyd trinite in moſte conueniēt tyme before ordenyd for the ſaluacyon of man kynde the ſeconde peerſon of thys trinite was ordenyd to take the fourme of man / that is the kynde of man. And I beleue that thys ſeconde perſon our lorde Ieſu chriſte was conceiuyd thorough the holy goſte into the wombe of the moſte bleſſyd virgyn Marye wyth out mānys ſeede. And I beleue that after nyne monethys Chriſte was borne of thys moſte bleſſyd vergyn wythout ony peyne or brekyng of the cloſter of hyr wombe / and wythout fylthe of hyr virginite. And I beleue that Chriſte our ſauyour was circunciſyd in the eyghte daye after hys byrthe in fulfillyng of ye lawe / and hys name was callyd Ieſu whych was callyd of ye angell before yt he was cōceiuyd in ye wōbe of Marie hys moder. And I beleue yt Chriſte as he was about thyrty yeare olde was baptyzed in ye fludde of Iordane of Iohn̄ baptiſt / & in lykeneſſe of a dove ye holy goſte deſcendyd there vpon him: and a voyce was herde frō heuen ſeiyng. Thou art my welblouyd ſonne In the I am full pleaſyd. And I beleue that Chriſte was moeuyd than by the holy goſte for to goo in to deſert / & there he faſtyd fourty dayes ād fourty nyghtes wythout bodely meate & drynk. And I beleue that by and by

after hys faſtyng whan the manhode of Chriſte hongeryd the feende came to hym ād tēptyd hym in glotony / in veyn glory / and in couetyſe / but in all thoes temptacyōs Chriſte concludyd the fende ād with ſtoode hym And than wyth out tariyng Ieſu began to preache & to ſeye vnto the people / doo ye penaunce / for the realme of heuen ys now at hande. And I beleue yt Chriſte in all hys tyme here lyued moſte holyly and taught the wyll of hys fader moſte trewly / and I beleue that he ſufferyd therefore moſte wrong fully greatyſt repreuys and deſpyſynges. And after thys whan Chriſte wolde make an ende here of hys temporall lyfe. I beleue that in the daye next before that he wolde ſuffer paſſyon on the morne: In fourme of brede & of wyne he ordenyd ye ſacramēte of hys fleſſh & hys blood yt ys hys owne precyous body / ād gaue it to hys apoſtles for to eate / cōmaundyng them & by thē all their after comers: yt they ſholde doo it ī thys fourme that he ſhewyd to them / vſe them ſelf and teache and commone forthe to other men & woomen thys moſte worſhypfull holieſt ſacramēt / in myndefulneſſe of hys holyeſt lyuyng & of hys moſte trew teachyng / & of hys wilfull & paciēt ſufferyng of the moſte peynfull paſſion And I beleue yt thus Chriſteour ſauyour / after yt he had ordenid thys moſte woorthy ſacramēt of hys owne preciouſe body: he wēt forthe wyllfully agenſt hys enemyes / and he ſufferyd thē moſt paciently to ley their hādys moſte violētly

vppon hym / and to bynde hym / & to leade hym forthe as a thefe / and to ſkorne hym / ād buffet ād all to blow or fyle hym with their ſpittinges Ouer this I beleue that Chriſt ſuffered moſt mekely and paciently his enemies for to dinge out with ſharpe ſcourges the bloude that was betwene his ſkyn & his fleſh: yee without grudginge Chriſt ſuffered ye cruell Iewes to crown hym with moſt ſharp thornes and to ſtrike him with a rede. And after Chriſt ſuffered wicked Iewes to draw him out vpon the croſſe and for to nayle hym there vpon fote and hande. And ſo thorow this pitiefull naylinge Chriſt ſhed out wilfully for mans lyfe the bloude that was in his vaynes. And then chriſt gaue wilfully his ſpirite in to the handes or power of his father / and ſo as he wolde & when he wold Chriſt deid wilfully for mans ſake vpon ye croſſe And notwithſtādinge yt Chriſt was wilfully / paynfully ād moſt ſhamfully put to deeth as to the worlde / there was left bloude and water in his herte as he before ordened that he wolde ſhede out this bloude and this water for mans ſaluacion. And therfore he ſuffered the Iewes to make a blinde knight to thruſt him in to the herte with a ſpere and this the bloude and water yt was in his hert Chriſt wolde ſhede out for mās loue. And after this I beleue that Chriſt was taken downe from the croſſe and buried And I beleue that on ye thrid daye by power of his god heed Chriſt roſe again from deth to life. And

the .xl. daye ther after I beleue that Chriſt aſcended vp in to heuen and that he there ſitteth on the right hande of god the father almyghty. And the tenth daye after this vp goinge he ſente to his apoſtles the holy gooſt that he had promyſed them before. And I beleue that Chriſte ſhall come and iudge all mankinde / ſome to euerlaſtinge peace and ſome to everlaſtynge paynes. And as I beleue in the father and in the ſonne that they are one god almyghty / ſo I beleue in the holy gooſt that is alſo with them the ſame god almighti. And I beleue an holy chirche that is all thei / that haue byn and that now are and alwayes to the ende of the worlde ſhalbe a people the which ſhall endeuer them to knowe & to kepe the commaundementes of god / dredinge ouer all thynge to offende god and lovynge and ſekynge moſt to pleaſe hym. And I beleue that all they that haue had and yet haue and all they that yet ſhall haue the foreſayde ververtuous ſurely ſtandynge in the belefe of god / hopyng ſtedfaſtly in hys mercifull doynges / cō
                  tinuynge to their ende in perfect charite / wilfully / paciently and gladly ſoferynge perſecuciōs / by the example of Chriſt chefly ād his apoſtles / all theſe haue their names wryten in the boke of life. Therfor I beleue that the gaderynge together of this people lyuynge now here in this lyfe ys the holye chyrche of god feyghtynge here on erth agaynſt the fende / the proſperyte of the worlde and their fleſhely luſtes. Wherfore ſeyng

that all the gadering together of this church before ſaid and euery parte therof nother coueteth nor willeth nor loveth nor ſeketh any thinge but to eſchew the offence of god and to do his pleaſynge will: mekely / gladly and wilfully of all myne herte I ſubmitt my ſelfe vnto thys holye church of chriſt to be ever buxſom and obediente to the ordinaunce of it and of euery member thereof after my knowlege and power by the helpe of god. Therfore I knowlege now ād euermore ſhall / if god will / that of all my harte and off all my might I will ſubmyt me only to the rule and gouernaunce of them whome after my knowlege I maye perceave by the havynge and vſynge of the beforeſayd vertues to be membres of the holy churche. Wherfore theſe articles off belefe and all other bothe of the olde lawe and of the newe / whiche after the commaundement of god any man oughte to beleue / I beleue verely in my ſoule as a ſynnefull deedly wretche of my cunnynge and power oughte to beleue prayenge the lorde god for his holye name for to encreaſe my belefe and helpe my vnbelefe. And for bycauſe to the prayſynge of goddes name I deſyre aboue all thynge to be a faythfull membre of holy churche I make this proteſtacyon before you all foure that are now here preſente / covetynge that all men and women that nowe abſente knewe the ſame / that what thynge ſo ever before this tyme I haue ſayde or done / or what thynge here I ſhall doo or ſaye / 

at any tyme here after. I beleve that all the olde lawe and the newe lawe geuen and ordened by the councell of theſe thre perſones of the trynite were geuen and wrytten to the ſaluacyon off mankynde. And I beleue that theſe lawes are ſufficient for mans ſaluacyon. And I beleue every article of theſe lawes to the entente that theſe articles were ordened and commaunded of theſe thre perſones off the moſte bleſſed trynyte to be beleued. And therfore to the rule and the ordynaunce off theſe goddes lawes mekely / gladly and wilfully I ſubmytte me with all myne harte that who ever can or wyll by ouctoryte off goddes lawe / or by open reaſon / tell me that I haue erred or nowe erre or any tyme here after ſhall erre in any article of belefe (fro whyche inceonvenience god kepe me for his goodneſſe) I ſubmytte me to be reconcyled and to be buxum and obedyente vnto theſe lawes of god and to every article of them. For by auctorite / ſpecyally of theſe lawes / I will / thorowe the grace of god / be vnyed charytably vnto theſe lawes. Yee ſyr and ouer thys I beleue and admytte all the ſentences / auctorites and reaſons off the ſaynctes and doctoures accordynge vnto holy ſcripture and declarynge it truely. I ſubmytte me wylfully and mekely to be ever obediente after my connynge and power to all theſe ſaynctes and doctoures as they are obedyente in worke and in worde to god and

to his lawe / and forther not to my knowlege no
                     •
                   for any erthly power dignite or ſtate / thorowe the helpe of god. But Syr I praye you tell me yf after youre biddyng I ſhall laye my hande vpon the boke to the entente to ſwere thereby? And the Archebiſhope ſayde to me / yee / wherfore els? And I ſayde to him. Syr a boke is no thynge els but a thynge coupled together of dyuerſe creatures / and to ſwere by any creature both gods lawe and mans lawe is agaynſt. But Syr this thinge I ſaye here to you before theſe youre clerckes / with my forſayd proteſtacion / that howe where / when and to whom men are boūdē to ſwere or to obeye in ony wyſe after gods lawe and ſayntes & trewe doctours according with gods lawe: I will thorow gods grace be euer redy therto with all my conning & power. But I pray you ſyr for ye charite of god yt ye will before that I ſwere as I haue here reherſed to you tell me how or whereto yt I ſhall ſubmytt me: & ſhewe me wherof yt ye will correcte me: & what is the ordinaunce that ye will thus oblige me to fulfyll.
               And ye Archebiſhop ſeid vnto me. I will ſhortely that nowe thou ſwere here to me that thou ſhalt forſake all the opinions which the ſecte of Lollardes holde / and is ſlaundred with: ſo that after this tyme nother pryuely nor apertly thou holde any opiniō which I ſhall after that thou haſte ſworne reherſe to y• here. Nor thou ſhalt fauer no man nor womā / yong nor old yt holdeth

any of thes foreſeid opiniōs: but after thi knowlege & power thou ſhalt enforſethe to withſtande all ſoche diſtroblers of holye chyrche in euery dioceſe that thou comeſt in: & thē that will not leaue their falſe and dampnable opinions thou ſhalt putt them vp publeſhyng them and theyr names / and make them knowen to ye biſhope of the dioceſe that they are in or to the biſhopes myniſtres. And ouer this I will that thou preach no more vnto the tyme that I know by good witneſſe & trewe yt thy cōuerſacion be ſoch that thy harte & thy mouth accorde treuly in one cōtrariyng all ye leude learnyng that thou haſt taught here before.
               And I hearyng thes wordes thought in my harte that this was an vnlefull a ſting: & I demyd myſelf curſed of god / yf I cōſented hereto & I thought howe Suſan ſeid. Anguyſſch is to me on euery ſyde. And in yt I ſtode ſtill & ſpake not / the Archebiſhop ſeid to me. Anſwere one wyſe or a nother. And I ſeid. Syr / if I cōſented to you thus / as ye haue here reherſed to me / I ſhold become an appelar / or euery biſhopis eſpye / ſomonour of all Englonde. For & I ſholde thus put vp / & publeſhe ye names of mē & womē I ſholde here in deceive full many perſones: ye ſyr as it is likely by ye dome of my cōſciēce I ſholde herein becauſe of ye dethe both of mē & womē ye both bodely & goſtely. For many mē & womē that ſtande now in ye treuthe / & are in ye waye of ſaluacyon: yf I ſhold for the learnyng & reding

of their beleue publeſhe thē & put thē therfor vp to biſſhopes or to their vnpituouſe miniſters I knowe ſome dele by experience yt they ſhulde be ſo diſtrobled & diſeaſed with perſecuciō or other wiſe yt many of thē (I thinke) wold rather choſe to forſake the waye of treuthe thā to be traueled ſkorned & ſlaundred or puniſhed as biſhopes & their miniſtres now vſe for to conſtreyne men & women to conſent to thē. But I fynde in no place in holy ſcripture / that this office yt ye wolde now enfeffe me with accordith to ony priſte off chriſtes ſecte / nor to any other chriſtē man. And therfore to do thus werto me a full noyeous bō
                  de to be boundē with & ouer greuouſe charge. For I ſuppoſe yt yf I thus dede many men & women wold / ye ſyr / might iuſtly vnto my cōfuſion ſey to me / that I wer a traitur to god and to them: ſyns (as I thinke in myne hert) many mē and womē truſte ſo mekle in me in this caſe / yt I wold not for ſauyng of my lyfe do thus to thē For yf I thus ſholde do full many mē & womē wolde (as they might full truely ſey / that I hadde faſly and cowerdly forſaken the truthe / & ſlaundred ſhamefully the worde of god. For yf I cōſented to you to do hereafter your will for bonchefe or miſchef yt may befall to me in this lyfe / I deme in my conſcience yt I were worthy herefore to be curſed of god & alſo of all his ſoynctes / fro which inconuenience kepe me & all chriſten people almighti god now & euer for his holy name▪ And than the Archebiſhop ſeid vnto

me. O thyne harte is full harde endured as was yt herre of Pharao / & the deuell hath ouer comē the & peruerted the / & he hath ſo blynded the in all thy wittes / that thou haſte no grace to knowe the treuthe / nor ye meſure of mercye yt I haue profered to ye. Therfor as I perceyue now by thy foliſh anſwere / thou haſt no will to leaue thyne olde errours. But I ſey to ye leude loſell / other thou quikly conſente to myne ordinaunce & ſubmitte ye to ſtande to my decrees: or by ſeynt Thomas thou ſhalt be diſgraded / & folowe thy felowe in Smithfelde. And at this ſeyng I ſtode ſtyll and ſpake not / but I thought in myne harte yt god did to me a greate grace / yf he wolde of his greate mercy bringe me to ſoch an ende. And in myne hart I was nothing frayde with this menaſīg of ye archebiſhop. And I cō
                  ſidered there .ij. thīges in hī. One / yt he was not yet ſoroufull for yt he had made Williā Soutre wrongfully to be burnt. And as I conſydered that ye Archebiſhop thyrſted yet after more ſhedīg out of innocent bloode. And faſt therfore I was moved in all my wittes for to hold ye archebiſhop nother for prelate nor for preiſt of god / & for ye myne inward mā was thus altogether departed frō ye archebiſhop me thought I ſholde not haue ony dreade of hī. But I was right heuy & ſoroufull for yt ther was none audiēce of ſeculer mē by: but in myn hart I praid ye lord god for to cōforte me and ſtrengith me ageinſt thē yt there ware agaynſte the ſothefaſteneſſe. And

I purpoſed to ſpeake no more to the Archebiſſhop & his clerckes than me nede behoued: & all thus I praied god for his goodneſſe to geue me than & alwaye grace to ſpeake with a meke ād an eaſy ſpyrit: & what ſoeuer thinge yt I ſhulde ſpeke that I might therto haue true authorites of ſcriptures or open reaſon. And for yt I ſtode thus ſtill & nothing ſpake / one of the Archebiſſhopes clerkes ſeid vnto me.
               What thing muſiſte thou? do thou as my lorde hath now cōmaunded to the here.
               And yet I ſtode ſtill & anſwered him not / ād than ſone after ye Archebiſhope ſeid to me. Arte thou not yet bethought / whether thou wilt do / as I haue here ſeid to the? And I ſeid thā to hym.
               Syr my father & my mother on whoſe ſoules god haue mercy (yf it be his will) ſpent mekyll money in diuerſe places about my learning for the entent to haue made me a preſte to god. But when I came to yeares of diſcrecion / I had no will to be preiſte / & therfore my frēdes were right heuy to me / & thā me thought their grudgīg agenſt me was ſo peynfull to me / yt I purpoſed therfor to haue lefte their cōpany. And whē thei perceiued this in me they ſpake ſome tyme full feire & pleſaunt wordes to me: but for yt thei might not make me to cōſent of goode harte to be a preiſte / thei ſpake to me full ofte tymes very greuous wordes / & manaſſed me ī diuerſe maners ſhewīg to me full heuy chere. And thus one while ī feire maner / a nother while in greuous they

wer lōg tyme as me thought full beſy about me or I cōſentid to thē to be a prieſte. But at ye laſte whā in this matter thei wold no lōger ſuffer myne excuſacions / but other I ſholde cōſent to thē or I ſholde euer beare their indignacion / ye / their curſe (as thei ſeide) Thā I ſeing this praid them that they wold gyue me licence for to go to them that wer named wyſe prieſtis and of verteuous conuerſacion to haue their counſell / ād to knowe of them the office & the charge of prieſthode. And hereto my father and my mother conſented full gladly / ād gaue me their bliſſing and goode leaue to go / and alſo money to ſpende in this iourney. And ſo than I went to tho prieſtis whome I herde to be of beſte name / ād of moſte holy lyuyng / and beſte learnid / & moſte wyſe of heuenly wiſdome: and ſo I communed with them vnto the tyme that I perceiuyd by their verteuous and continuall occupacions yt their honeſte and charitable werkis paſſid their fame wich I herde before of them. Wherfore ſyr by the example of the doctrine of them / and ſpecially for the godly & innocent workis wich I perceiued than of them and in them / after my conning and power I haue exerciſed me than and in this tyme to knowe perfectly goddis lawe / hauing a will and a deſyre to lyue ther after / willing that all men and women exerciſed thē ſelf feithfully ther aboute. Yf than ſyr other for pleaſure or diſpleaſure of them that ar nother ſo wyſe / nor of ſo verteuouſe conuerſacion

to my knowlege / nor by comone fame to ony other mannis knoulege in this lande as thes men wer of whome I toke my counſell and informacion: I ſholde now forſake thus ſodenly and ſhortely ād vnwarnid all the learning yt I haue exerciſed my ſelf in this thirty winter and more. My conſcience ſhulde euer be herewith out of meſure vnquietid / & as ſyr I knowe well that many men and women ſholde be ther throwe greatly troublid and ſclaunderid / and as I ſeid ſyr to you before. For myne vntrewthe and falſe cowardneſſe many a one ſholde be put into full great reprefe / ye ſyr I drede / that many a one (as thei might than iuſtely / wolde curſe me full bitterly / and ſyr I feare not / but the curſe of god / wich I ſholde deſerue here in / wolde brīg me to a full euyll ende / yf I continewid thus. And if thorow remorſe of conſcience I repētid me any tyme retourning in to the waye / wych / you doo your diligence to conſtreine me now to forſake / ye ſyr / all ye biſſhopis of this lāde with full many other prieſtis wolde defame me / and purſew me as a relapſe / and thei that now haue (though I be vnworthy) ſome confidence in me here after wolde neuer truſte to me though I cowlde teache and liue neuer ſo verteuouſly more than I can or may. For if after your counſell I lefte vtterly all my learning / I ſholde hereby firſte wounde and defyle myne owne ſoule / ād alſo I ſhulde here through geue occaſiō to many men and women of full ſore hurting / ye ſyr

as it is likely to me / if I conſentid to your will I ſholde herein by myne euill example in it / as ferre as in me wer / ſlee many folke goſtely / that I ſholde neuer deſerue for to haue grace of god to the edifiyng of his chirche nother of my ſelf / nor of none other mannes lyfe: & vndone bothe before god & man. But ſyr by example chefely of ſome whos names I will not now reherſe / H / of I / P / and B / and alſo by the preſent doyng of Philip of Rāpenton that is now becomē Biſſhop of Lincoln I am now learnid as many mo hereafter thorow goddis grace ſhall be learnid / to hate & to fle all ſoche ſclaūder yt thes foreſeid men chefely hathe defyled principally thē ſelfes with. And in it yt in thē is they haue enuenemid all ye chirche of god for ye ſclaunderous reuokyng at ye croſſe of paulis of H. P. & of B / & how now Philip Rāpenton perſewith criſtis people. And ye feining / yt thes men diſſemble by worldly prudēce keping thē cowerdly in their preaching and communyng within the bondis ād termis (wich without blame may be ſpokyn and ſhewid out to the moſte worldly lyuers) will not be vnponiſſhid of god. For to the pointe of trewthe that thes men ſhewid out ſome tyme they will not now ſtreche forthe their lyues. But by example eche one of them as their wordis and their workis ſhewe they beſy them thorow their feinyng: for to ſclaunder and to perſewe Chriſte in his membres / rather than they will be perſewid.
               
                  And the Archebiſſhop ſeid to me. Thes men the wich thou ſpekiſt of now wer foolis and heretiques: whan they wer countid wyſe men of the and other ſoche loſelles. But now they ar wyſe men / though thou and ſoche other denie them vnwyſe. Neuertheleſſe I wiſte neuer none / that right ſeide / that eny while were enuenymed with your contagiouſneſſe / that is / contaminate and ſpottid doctrine.
               And I ſeid to the Archebiſſhop. Syr I thinke well that thes men and ſoche other ar now wyſe as to this worlde / but as their wordis ſoū
                  did ſometyme and their workis ſhewid outwardly / it was likely to moue me yt they hadde earneſte of the wiſdome of god / and that they ſholde haue deſeruid mikell grace of god to haue ſauyd their owne ſoules and meny other mennis if they hadde continewid feithfully in wilfull pouerte and in other ſymple verteuous lyuyng and ſpecially / if they hadde with thes foreſeide vertueis continewid in their beſy frutefull ſowing of goddis worde: as to many mennys knoulege they occupied thē a ſeaſon in all their wittes full beſyly to knowe the pleſaunt will of god / trauelyng all their mēbres full beſily for to doo ther after / purely and chefely to the praiſing of the moſte holy name of god / and for grace of edificacion and ſaluacion of criſten people But wo worthe falſe couetiſe / and euill counſell / and tyrannye by wiche they and many men and women ar ledde blyndely into an euill

ende.
               Than the Archebiſſhop ſeide to me. Thou & ſoche other loſellis of thy ſecte wolde ſhaue your berdis full nere for to haue a benefice. For by Ieſu I knowe none more couetouſe ſhrewis than ye ar / when that ye haue a benefice. For lo I gaue to Iohn̄ Puruay / a benefice but a myle out of this caſtell / and I herde more compleintis aboute his couetouſneſſe for tythes ād other myſdoyngys than I didde of all men that wer auauncid within my dioceſſe.
               And I ſeid to the Archebiſſhop. Syr puruay is nother with you now for the benefice yt ye gaue hym / nor he holdith feithfully with the learnyng that he tawght and writ before tyme and thus he ſhewith hym ſelf nother to be hote nor colde: and therfore he and his felaws may ſore drede that if they torne not haſtely to ye waye that they haue forſakyn: parauēture they be put out of the nombre of criſtis choſyn people.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſeid. Though Puruay be now a falſe harlot I quyte me to hym / but come he more for ſoche cauſe before me: or we departe I ſhall knowe with whome he holdith. But I ſey to the. Whiche ar thes holy mē and wyſe of whome thou haſte takyn thyne informacion.
               And I ſeid. Syr / Maſter Iohn Wicleff was holden of full many men the greatiſte clerke that they knewe than lyuyng / and therwith he was namid a paſſing ruely man and an ynnocent

in his lyuynge and herefore greate men commonyd ofte with hym and they louyd ſo his learnyng that they writ it / and beſily enforſid them to rule themſelf there after. Therfore ſyr this foreſeid learnyng of Maſter Iohn Wicleff is yet holden of full many men and womē the moſte agreable learning vnto the lyuing ād teachyng of Criſte and of his Apoſtles / & moſte openly ſhewing and declaring how the chirche of Criſte hathe ben and yet ſhulde be rewlid ād gouernid. Therfore ſo many men and women couet this learnyng / & purpoſe / thorough goddis grace to conforme their lyuyng lyke to this learnyng of Wicleff. Maſter Iohn aiſton tawght and writ accordingly ād full beſily wher and whan / and to whome that he myght / and he vſid it hymſelf right perfitely vnto his lifes ende. And alſo Philip of Rampenton while he was a chanone of Laceſter / Nicolas Herforde Dauy Gotray of Pakring monke of Bylande and a maſter of diuinite / and Iohn Purnay ād many other wich wer holden right wiſe men & prudent tawcht and writ beſily this forſeid learnyng and conformid them therto. And with all thes men I was ofte right homely ād communyd with them long tyme and ofte: and ſo before all other men I choeſ wilfully to be infourmyd of them and by them and ſpecially of Wicleff hymſelf / as of the moſte verteuous & godly wyſe mē that I herde of or knewe. And therfore of hym ſpecially and of thes men I tooke

the learnyng that I haue tauchte and purpoſe to lyue there after (if god will) to my lyues ende. For though ſome of thes men be contrary to the learnyng that they taucht before I wote well yt their learning was trewe wich they tauchte: ād therfore with the helpe of god I purpoſe to holde and to vſe the learning wich I harde of thē / while they ſat on Moyſes chaire / and ſpecially while that they ſat on the chaire of Criſte. But after ye werkis that they now do I will not doo with goddis helpe. For they feyne and hyde ād cōtrarie the trewthe wich before they taucht out plenily and trewly. For as I know well when ſome of thes men hathe ben blamyd for their ſclaunderous doyng / they graūte not that they haue tauchte a miſſe or crryd beforetyme / but yt they were conſtreinyd by peine to leaue to tell out the ſothe / and thus they choeſe now rather to blaſpheme god than to ſuffer awhile here perſecucion bodely for ſothefaſtneſſe that Chriſte ſhed out his harte bloode for.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſeid. That learnyng that thou calliſt trewthe and ſothefaſtneſſe is open ſclaunder to holy chirche / as it is prouyd of holy chirche. For all be it / that Wicleff your autour was a great clerke & though that many men helde hym a perfite lyuer yet his doctrine is not approuyd of holy cherche but many ſentencis of his learnyng ar dāpnyd as they well woorthy ar. But as touching Philip of Rāpeton yt was firſt chanone

and after Abbot of Laceſter which is now biſſhop of Lincoln: I tell the that the daye is comen for wich he faſtyd the euene. For nother he holdeth now / nor will holdethe learnyng that he thaughte whan he was a Chanon of Laceſter. For no biſſhop of this lāde perſewith now more ſharpely them that holde thy waye than he doeth.
               And I ſeid. Syr full many men and women wonderith vpon hym and ſpeakith hym mekill ſhame and holdith him for a curſid enemye of the treuthe.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſeid to me. Wherfore tarieſte thou me thus here with ſoche fables / wilt thou ſhortely (as I haue ſeid to the) ſubmit the to me or no?
               And I ſeid. Syr I tell you at one worde / I dare not for the drede of god ſubmitt me to you after the tenour and ſentēce that ye haue aboue reherſed to me.
               And than as if he hadde ben wrothe he ſeid to one of his clerkis. Fetche hider quikely the certificaciō that came to me fro Shrewiſbury vnder the bailiues ſeale witneſſing the errours & hereſies which this loſell hath venemouſly ſowen there.
               Than haſtely the Clerke tooke out / and leid forthe on a cupborde diuerſe rollis and writingis / among which ther was a litle one / which ye clerke deliuered to the Archebiſſhop. And by & by the Archebiſſhop redde this rolle cōteinyng

this ſentence.
               ¶The thyrde ſonday after eaſter the yere of oure lorde .M.CCCC. and ſeuen / William Thorpe came vnto the towne of Shrewiſbury / and thorow leaue graunted vnto him to preache: He ſaid openly in ſeynt Chaddis chirche in his ſermone / that the Sacramēt of the altare after the conſecracion was materiall brede. And ye ymages ſhulde in no wiſe be worſhiped. And that men ſhulde not go on pilgremages. And that prieſtes haue no title to tythes. And that it is not lefull for to ſwere in any wiſe.
               And whan the Archebiſhop had red thus thys rolle / he rolled it vp ageyn / and ſaid to me. Ys this holſome learnynge to be amonge the people?
               And I ſaid to him. Syr I am both aſhamed on their behalfe and right ſoroufull for thē that haue certified you thes thinges thus vntrewly: for I preached neuer nor taughte thus priuely nor apertly.
               And the Archebiſhop ſaid to me. I will gyue credence to thes worſhipfull men which haue writen to me and witneſſed vnder their ſealis there amonge them. Though thou now denieſt this: weniſt thou yt I will geue credence to the? Thou loſell haſt trobled ye worſhipful cominalte of Shrewiſbury / ſo that the bailives and cominalte of that towne haue writen to me praynge me that am Archebiſhop of Caunterbury / primate and Chaunceler of Englond / that I will

vouchſafe to graunte them / that yf thou ſhalt be made (as thou art worthy) to ſuffer open Ioureſſe for thyne hereſyes / that thou maye haue thi youreſſe openly ther among them: ſo that all they whome thou and ſoche other loſelles haue ther peruerted / may thorow feare of thy dede be reconſyled ageyn to the vnite of holy chyrche. And alſo they that ſtande in true faythe of holy churche may thorowe thy dede be more ſtabliſſhed therein. And as yf thys aſkyng hadde pleaſed the Archebiſhop / he ſaid. By my thrifte this hartye prayoure and feruente requeſte ſhall be thought on.
               But certeynly nother the prayer of the men of Shrewiſbery / nor the manaſſynge of the Archebiſhoppe made me any thinge a frayde. But in reherſyng of this malice and in the hearynge of it my herte greatly reioyſed and yet dothe. I thanke god for the grace that I than thought and yet thinke ſhall come to all the chirche of god here thorowe / by the ſpeciall mercyfull doynge of the lorde. And as hauynge no dreade of the malice of tyrauntes / by truſtynge ſtedfaſtly in the helpe of the lorde with full purpoſe for to knowlege the ſothefaſtneſſe / and to ſtande thereby after my connyng and power I ſaid to the Archebiſhop. Syr yf the truthe of gods worde might now be accepted as it ſholde be / I doute not to proue by lykely euidence / that they that are famed to be out of the faythe of holy church in Shrewiſbery & in other places alſo

are in the true faith of holy chirche. For as their wordes ſounde / and their workes ſhewe to mā
                  nis iugemēt dreading & louyng faithfully god their will / their deſyre / their loue / & their beſineſſe are moſte ſett to dreade to offende god / & to loue for to pleaſe him in true & faithfull keping of his commaundementes. And agene they yt are ſaid to be in the faithe of holy chirche in Shrewiſbery and in other places / by open euidence of their proude / enuiouſe / maliciouſe / couetouſe lecherouſe and other foule wordes & workes nother knowe nor haue will to knowe nor to occupye their wittes truely and effectuouſly in the righte faith of holy churche. Wherfore all theſe nor none that folowe their maners ſhall ony tyme come verely in the faithe of holy churche / excepte they enforce them more truelye to come in the waye whiche nowe they deſpyſe. For theſe men and women that are nowe called feyth full and holden iuſte / nother knowe nor will exercyſe them ſelfe to knowe of faythfulneſſe one commaundement of god. And thus full many men and women now / and ſpecially mē that are named to be principall lymmes of holy church ſtiere god to greate wrathe and deſerue his curſe for that they call or holde them iuſte men whiche are full vniuſte as their vicyouſe wordes / their greate cuſtomable ſweringe / and their ſlaūderouſe and ſhamefull workes ſhew openly and witneſſe. And herefor ſoche viciouſe men and vniuſte in theire owne confuſyon

call them vniuſte men and women / which after their power and conning beſy them ſelf to lyue iuſtely after the commaundement of god. And where ſyr ye ſay / that I haue diſtrobled the cominalte of Shrewiſbery and many other men & women with my teaching / yf it thus be / it is not to be wondred of wiſe men / ſyns all the cominalte of the cyte of Ieruſalem was deſtrobled off chriſtes awne perſon that was very god & mā and moſt prudent precher that euer was or ſhal be. And alſo all the Synagoge of Nazareth was moued ageynſte Chriſte and ſo fulfylled with ire towardes him for his preachinge / that the men of the Synagoge roſe vp and caſt ch
                     •
                  iſte out of their cyte / and ledde him vppe to the toppe of a moūtayne for to caſte him doune ther hedelinge. Alſo accordingly hereto the lord witneſſyth by Moſes / that he ſhall put diſſenſion betwixt his people ād the people that contrarieth and perſewith his people. Who ſyr is he yt ſhall preache the treuthe of goddes worde to ye vnfeithfull people / and ſhall let the ſothe faſteneſſe of ye goſpell & the prophecye of god almightye to be fulfilled?
               And the archebiſhop ſaid to me. It foloweth of thes thy wordes / yt thou & ſoche other thīkeſt yt ye do right well for to preach & teach as ye do without authorite of any biſhope. For ye preſume / that ye lorde hath choſen you only for to preache as faithfull diſciples and ſpeciall folowars of Chriſte
               
                  And I ſaid. Syr by authorite of gods lawe & alſo of ſeintes & doctours I am learned to deme / yt it is euery prieſtes office and deutie for to preache beſily frely and truely ye worde of god. For no doute euery prieſt ſhold purpoſe fyrſt in his ſoule & couett to take ye order of prieſthode chefly for to make knowē to ye people ye worde of god after his conning & power approuyng his wordes euer to be true by his vertuous workes and for this entent we ſuppoſe ye biſhopes and other prelates of holy chirch ſhold chefely take & vſe ther prelacie. And for the ſame cauſe / biſhopes ſholde gyue to prieſtes their orders. For biſſhopes ſholde accept no mā to prieſthode except that he had good will & full purpoſe / & wer wel diſpoſed / & well learned to preache. Wherfore ſyr by the bidding of Chriſt & by example of his moſte holy lyuyng & alſo by ye witneſſinge of his holy apoſtles & prophetes we are bounde vnder full great peyne to exercyſe vs after our cōning and power (as euery prieſte is like wiſe charged of god) to fulfyll dewly the office of prieſthode. We preſume not here of oure ſelfes for to be eſtemed (nother in oure owne reputaciō nor in none other mannes) feithfull diſciples ād ſpeciall folowers of Chriſte: but ſyr / as I ſaid to you before / we deme this by authorite chefely of goddes worde / that it is ye chefe deutie of euery prieſte to beſy them feithfully to make ye law of god knowen to his people / and ſo to comune the cō
                  maundement of god charitably howe that we

may beſte / where / whan / & to whome y• euer we may is our very deutie. And for the will & beſyneſſe that we owe of dewe dette to do iuſtely our office thorow the ſteyring ād ſpeciall helpe (as we truſte) of god / hoping ſtedfaſtely in his mercye / we deſyre to be the feithfull diſciples of chriſte: and we praye this gracious lorde for his holy name / that he make vs able ſo to pleaſe hym with deuoute prayers and charitable prieſtly workes / that we may obteyne of him to folowe him thankfully.
               And the Archebiſhop ſaid to me. Lewde loſell wherto makiſt thou ſoche veyne reaſones to me. Aſketh not ſeynt Paul / how ſholde prieſtes preche / except they be ſent? But I ſent ye neuer to preche. For thy venemous doctryne is ſo knowen thorow out Englōd / yt no biſhop will admitt the for to preache by witneſſyng of their letters. Why than lewde ydiote willeſt thou preſume to preach / ſyns thou art not ſent nor licenſed of thy ſouereyn to preach. Saith not ſeynt Paule / that ſubictes owe to obeye their ſouereyns / ād not only good and vertuous: but alſo tyrauntis that are vicious?
               And I ſaid to the archebiſhop. Syr / as touching your letter of licēce or other biſhopes / whiche ye ſay we ſholde haue to witneſſe yt we wer able to be ſent for to preache? we knowe well yt nother you ſyr / nor ony other biſhop of this lande will graunte to vs ony ſoche letters of licence but we ſholde oblige vs to you & to other biſſhopes

by vnlefull othes for to paſſe not ye bōdes & termes which ye ſyr or other biſhopes wil lymyt to vs. And ſins ī this matter your termis be ſome to large / & ſome to ſtreite we dare not oblige vs thus to be boūdē to you for to kepe ye termes / which you will lymitt to vs / as ye do to friers & ſoch other prechers: & therfor though we haue not your letter ſir nor letters of other biſhops writē with ynke vpō perchemēt: we dare not here for leaue ye office of preching / to which preching all prieſtes after there cōnyng & power are bounde by diuerſe teſtimonies of gods lawe & off great doctours without ony mēciō makīg of biſhopes letters. For as mekell as we haue takē vpō vs ye office of prieſthode (though we are vnworthy thereto) we come & purpoſe to fulfyll it with ye helpe of god by authorite of his owne lawe / and by witneſſe of great doctours & ſeintes accordingly hereto truſting ſtedfaſtly in ye mercye of god. For yt he commaundeth vs to do the office of prieſthode / he will be our ſufficient letters & witneſſe / if we by example of his holy lyuing & teaching ſpecially occupye vs feithfully to do our office iuſtly / ye ye people to whome we preache / be they feithfull or vnfeithfull ſhall be our letters yt is our witneſſe berers. For ye treuthe where it is ſowen maye not be vnwitneſſed. For all that are conuerted & ſaued by learninge of goddes worde and by working therafter are witneſſe berers / yt the trewith and ſothfaſtneſſe whiche they harde and dyd after is cauſe off

their ſaluacion. And ageyn / all vnfeythfull mē & womē which herde the treuthe tolde out to thē & wolde not do there after: alſo all they that might haue herde the treuthe and wold not heare it / becauſe that they wolde not do thereafter / all thes ſhall beare witneſſe ageinſt them ſelfes / & the treuth which they wold not heare / or els harden & deſpiſed to do thereafter thorow their vnfeythfulneſſe: is and ſhall be cauſe of their dāpnacion. Therfore ſyr / ſyns this forſeide witneſſing of god & of diuerſe ſeintes & doctours / & off all ye people good & euyll ſufficeth to all true prechers: we thinke that we do not ye office of preſthode / if that we leaue our preaching / becauſe yt we haue not or maye not haue dewly biſſhopes letters to witneſſe that we are ſent of thē to preache. This ſentence approueth ſeynt Paul / whe
                     •
                   he ſpeketh of him ſelfe & of feithfull apoſtles & diſciples ſaing thus. We neade no letters of cō
                  mēdacion as ſome other preachers do / whiche preache for couetouſnes of tēporall goodes ād for mēnes praiſing. And wher ye ſay ſyr yt paul biddeth ſubiectes obey their ſouereyns / this is ſoth / & may not be denied. But ther is .ij. maner of ſouereyns / vertuous ſufferēys & vicious tyraūtes. Therfore to thes laſt ſouereyns nother mē nor womē yt be ſubiecte owe to obey ī .ij. maners To vertuous ſuffereins & charitable / ſubictes owe to obey wilfully & gladly / in hearīg of their good coūſell / ī cōſentīg to their charitable biddinges / & in werkynge after their frutefull workes

This ſentence Paul approueth wher he ſaith thus to ſubiectis. Be ye mindefull of your ſouereyns that ſpeke to you the worde of god / and folow you the feithe of them whos conuerſacion you know to be verteuous. For as Paul ſaith after / thes ſouereyns to whome ſubiectis owe to obeye in folowing of their maners / worke beſily in holy ſtudiyng / how they may withſtande ād deſtroye vices firſte in themſelf / and after in all their ſubiectis / and how they may beſ
                     •
                  e plante in them vertues. Alſo thes ſouereyns make deuoute and feruent prayers for to purchaſe grace of god / that they ād their ſubiectis may ouer all thing dreade to offende hym & to loue for to pleaſe hym. Alſo thes ſouereyns to whome Paul biddeth vs obey as it is ſeid before lyue ſo vertuouſly that all they that will lyue well may take of them goode example to knowe and to kepe the commaundmentis of god. But in this foreſeid wyſe / ſubiectis owe not to obeye nor to be obedient to tyrauntis / while they ar vicious tyrauntis / ſyns their will / their counſell / their biddingis / ād their workis ar ſo vicious that they owe to be hatid and lefte. And though ſoche tyrauntis be maſterfull and cruell in boſtyng ād manaſing in oppreſſions & diuerſe punyſſhyngis: ſeynt Petyr biddeth the ſeruauntis of ſoche tyraūtis to obey mekely to ſoche tyrauntis / ſuffering paciently their malicious cruelnes. But Petyr counſellith not ony ſeruant or ſubiecte to obey to ony lorde or prince or ſouereyn in ony

thyng that is not pleaſing to god.
               And the Archebeſſhop ſaid vnto me. Yf a ſouereyn bidde his ſubiecte doo that thing that is vicious / this ſouereyn herein is to blame: but the ſubiecte for his obedience deſerueth mede of god For obediēce pleaſith more to god than ony ſacrifice.
               And I ſaid. Samuel the prophete ſaid to Saul the wickyd kyng / yt god was more pleaſed with the obedience of his commaundement than with ony ſacrifice of beſtis. But Dauid ſaith / and ſeynt Paul / and ſeynt Gregory accordingly to gither / that not onely they yt doo euyll is worthy of dethe ād dampnacion: but alſo all they that conſente to euyll doers. And ſyr ye law of holy chirche teachith in the decrees / that no ſeruant to his lorde / nor childe to the father or mother / nor wyfe to hyr huſbond / nor monke to his abot ought to obey except in lefull thingis & lawfull.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me. All thes allegingis that thou bringeſt forthe ar not els but proude preſumptuouſnes. For hereby thou enforciſt the to proue / that thou and ſoche other ar ſo iuſte / that ye owe not to obeye to prelatis. And thus agenſt the learning of ſeynt Paul yt teachith you not to preache but if ye wer ſent / of your owne authorite ye will go forthe and preache and doo what ye liſte.
               And I ſaid. Syr / preſentith not euery prieſte the office of the apoſtles / or the office of the

diſciples of Chriſte? And the Archebiſſhop ſaid ye. ¶And I ſaid. Syr as the tenthe chaptre of Mathew and the laſte chaptre of Marke witneſſeth / Chriſte ſent his apoſtles for to preache. And the tenthe chaptre of Luke witneſſeth that Chriſte ſent his two and ſeuentie diſciples for to preache in euery place that Chriſte was to come to. And ſeynt Gregory in the comon lawe ſaith / that euery man that goth to prieſthode takith vpon hym the office of preaching: for as he ſaith / that prieſte ſteirith god to great wrathe of whos mouthe is not herde ye voice of preaching And as other more gloſes vpon Ezechiel witneſſe / that ye prieſte that prechith not beſily to the people ſhall be parte taker of their dampnacion that periſſhe thorow his defaute: and though ye people beſauyd by other ſpeciall grace of god thā by ye prieſtis preachyng / yet the prieſtis / in ye they ar ordenyd to preache & preache not / as before god they ar mā
                  
                     ••
                  ears For as ferre as in thē is / ſoche prieſtes as preache not beſily ād trewly ſleeth all ye people goſtely in that they with hold from thē the worde of god that is lyfe and ſuſtenaūce of mēnis ſoules. And ſeynt Iſidore ſaith Prieſtis ſhall be dāpnid for wickidneſſe of the people / if they teache not thē yt ar ignorāt: or blame not thē yt ar ſynners. For all yt worke or beſineſſe of prieſtis ſtādith in preaching & teaching that they edifye all men as well by connyng of feithe / as by diſcipline of workes / that is vertuous teaching. And as the goſpell witneſſith:

Chriſte ſaid in his teaching. I am borne ād comē in to this worlde to beare witneſſe to ye trewthe and he that is of the trewthe hearith my voice. ¶Than ſyr ſyns by the worde of Chriſte ſpecially / that is his voice / prieſtis ar commaundid to preache: what ſo euer prieſte that it be that hathe not goode will ād full purpoſe to doo thus / and ableth not hymſelf after his conning and power to doo his office by the example of Chriſte and of his apoſtles / what ſo euer other thing that he dothe diſpleaſith god. For lo ſeynt Gregory ſaith / that thing lefte / that a mā is boūde chefely to doo / what ſo euer other thing that a man dothe / it is vnthankefull to ye holy goſte: and therfore ſaithe Lincoln. That prieſte that preachith not ye worde of god though he be ſiene to haue none other defaute / he is Antichriſte and Sathanas / a night thefe / and a day thefe / a ſlear of ſoules and an angell of light toornid in to derkeneſſe Wherfore ſyr / thes authorites and other well conſiderid / I deme my ſelf dāpnable / if Iother for pleaſure or diſpleaſure of ony creature applye me not diligētly to preache the worde of god. And in the ſame dampnaciō I deme all thoſe prieſtis which of goode purpoſe and will enforſe them not beſily to doo thus / and alſo all them that haue purpoſe or will to lett ony prieſte of this beſineſſe.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to thoſe thre clerkis yt ſtoode before hym. Lo ſyrs / this is ye maner and beſineſſe of this loſell ād ſoche other to

pike out ſoche ſharpe ſentencis of holy ſcripture and of doctoris to mainteine their ſecte and lore ageinſte ye ordinaunce of holy chirche. And therefore loſell it is that thou couetiſt to haue ageyn the pſalter that I made to betakyn from yt at Cāturbery / to recorde ſharpe verſys a geīſt vs. But thou ſhalt neuer haue that pſalter / nor none other boke / tyll that I know that thy harte and thy mouthe accorde fully to be gouernid by holy chirche.
               And I ſaid. Syr all my will and power is and euer ſhall be (I truſte to god) to be gouernyd by holy chirche
               And the Archebiſſhop aſkid me / what was holy chirche.
               And I ſaid / ſyr I tolde you before / what was holy chirche: but ſyns ye aſke me this demaunde: I call Chriſte and his ſeyntis holy chirche.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid vnto me. I wote well that Chriſte and his ſeyntis ar holy chirche in heuene / but what is holy chirche in erthe?
               And I ſaid. Syr though holy chirche be euery one ī charite / yet it hathe two partis. The firſte and principall parte hath ouer comen perfitely all the wretchedneſſe of this lyfe / and reigneth ioyfully in heuene with Chriſte. And the tother parte is here yet in erthe / beſily and continually fighting day and night ageinſt temptacions of the fende / forſakyng and hatyng the proſperite of this worlde / deſpiſing and withſtonding

their fleſſchely luſtis / which onely ar ye pilgrimes of Chriſte / wandering toward heuene by ſtedfaſt feithe / and groundid hope / and by perfite charite. For thes heuenly pilgremis may not / nor will not be lettid of their goode purpos by the reaſon of eny doctours diſcording fro holy ſcripture / nor by the fluddis of any tribulaciō temporall / nor by the winde of any pride of boſte or of manaſing of ony creature / for they ar all faſte grounded vpon the ſuer ſtone Ch
                     •
                  iſte / hearing his worde and louing it / exerciſing thē feithfully and continually in all their wittes to doo there after.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to his clerkis. Se ye not how his harte is endured / & how he is traueled with ye deuill / occupiyng hym thus beſely to allege ſoche ſentencis to mainteyne hys errours and hereſies? Certeyn thus he wold occupie vs here all daye / if we wold ſuffer hym.
               One of the clerkes anſwered. Syr / he ſaid right now that this Certificacion that came to you fro ſhrewiſbery is vntrewly forged ageinſt hym. Therfore Syr / appoſe you hym now here in all the poītis which ar certified ageinſt hym and ſo we ſhall heare of his owne mouthe his anſwers / and witneſſe them.
               And the Archebiſſhop tooke the certificaciō in his honde / and looked theron a while / & than he ſaid to me.
               Lo here it is certified ageinſt the by worthy

men and feithfull of Shrewiſbery yt thou preachedſt there openly in ſeynt Chaddis chirche / that the Sacramēt of the altare was materiall brede after the conſecracion. What ſaiſt thou? Was this trewly preached?
               And I ſaid / Sir I tell you trewly that I touchid nothing there / of the Sacrament of ye altare / but in this wyſe / as I will with goddis grace tell you here. As I ſtoode ther in ye Pulpet / beſiyng me to teache ye commaundement of god / ther knylled a ſacring bell / ād therfore mekill people toornid awaye haſtely / & with great noyſe ran fro towardis me. And I ſeyng this ſaid to them thus. Goode men ye wer better to ſtand here ſtill & to heare goddis worde. For certis ye vertue & the mede of the moſte holy Sacrament of ye altare ſtandith mekill more in ye beleue thereof / yt ye ought to haue in your ſoule / thā it dothe in ye outward ſighte thereof. And therfor ye were better to ſtande ſtill quietely to heare goddis worde / becauſe ye thorow ye hearing the rof men come to very trewe belefe. And other wyſe ſyr I am certein I ſpake not there / of the woorthy Sacrament of the altare.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me. I beleue the not what ſo euer thou ſaiſt / ſyns ſo worſhipfull men haue witneſſed thus ageinſt the. But ſyns thou denyeſt that thou ſaidiſt thus there / what ſaiſt thou now? Reſtith there / after the conſecracion in the ofte materiall brede or no?
               
                  And I ſaid / Sir / I knowe in no place in holy ſcripture / where this terme / materiall brede / is writen: and therfore Sir when I ſpeake of this matter / I vſe not to ſpeake of materiall brede.
               Than the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me. How teacheſt thou men to beleue in this ſacrament?
               And I ſaid / Sir as I beleue myſelf ſo I teache other men.
               He ſaid / tell out pleinly thy beleue hereof.
               And I ſaid with my proteſtaciō. Sir I beleue that the nyght / before yt Chriſte Ieſu wold ſuffer wilfully paſſion for man kynde on ye morne after / he toke breade in his holy and moſte worſhipfull handis lifting vp his eyes / ād gyuyng thankis to god his father / bleſſed this breade and brake it / and gaue it to his diſciples ſaiyng to them. Take and eate of this all you? This is my body: And that this is ād ought to be all mennis belefe Mathew / Marke / Luke / and Paul witneſſith. Other beleue ſir haue I none / nor will haue / nor teache / for I beleue yt this ſufficeth in this matter. For in this beleue with goddis grace I purpoſe to lyue and dye / knoleging as I beleue and teache other men to beleue / that the worſhipfull ſacramēt of the altare / ys the ſacramente of Chriſtis fleſche ād his bloode in fourme of breade and of wine.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me. It is ſothe that this Sacrament is very Chriſtis body infourme of breade. But thou and thy ſecrete

chiſt it to be ſubſtaūce of brede. Thynke you this true teachinge?
               And I ſaid. Nother I nor ony other of the ſecte that ye dampne / teache ony other wyſe thā I haue tolde you / nor beleue other wiſe / to my knowynge. Neuertheleſſe ſyr I aſke of you for charyte / that ye will tell me here pleynly / how ye ſhall vnderſtonde this text of ſaynt Paule / wher he ſayth thus. This thinge feale you in youre ſelfe that is in Chriſte ieſu / while he was in the fourme of god. Sir / calleth not Paule here the fourme of god / the ſubſtaunce or kynde of god? Alſo Sir: ſaith not the chirche in the houres of the moſt bleſſed virgine accordi
                     •
                  ly hereto / where it is written thus. Thou auctour of healthe remembre / that ſometyme thou toke of the vndefyled vyrgyne the fourme off oure bodye. Tell me for charyte therfore / whether the fourme of our bodye be called here the kynde of oure body or no?
               And the Archebiſhop ſaid to me. Woldeſt thou make me to declare this texte after thy purpoſe / ſyns the chirche hathe nowe determyned / yt there abideth no ſubſtaunce of breade after the conſecracion in the ſacrament of the altare? Beleueſt thou not on this ordinaunce off the churche?
               And I ſaid. Syr what ſoeuer prelates haue ordened in the churche: our beleue ſtandith euer hooll. I haue not herde that the ordinaunce off men vnder beleue / ſhulde be putt in to

beleue. And the Archebiſhop ſaide to me. Yf thou haſt not learned this before / learne now to knowe yt thou art out of beleue: if in this matter and other thou beleueſt not as holy chirche beleueth. What ſaye doctours treatinge of this ſacrament?
               And I ſaid. Syr ſeynt Paule yt was a greate doctour of holy chirche ſpeakynge to the people and teaching them the right beleue of this moſte holy ſacrament calleth it breade that we breake. And alſo in the Canon of the maſſe after the conſecracion / this moſt worthy ſacramēt is called holy breade. And euery prieſte in this lā
                  de after that he hathe receyued this ſacrament ſaythe in thys wyſe. That thynge that we haue taken with oure mouthe / we praye god that we maye take it with a pure and clene mynde. That is as I vnderſtonde / we praye god / that we maye receyue thorowe very beleue this holy ſacrament worthely. And ſyr ſeynt Auguſtine ſaith. That thing that is ſene is breade: but that mennys feithe aſketh to be informed of / is verye chriſtes body. And alſo Fulgence an ententyfe doctour ſaith. As it were an errour to ſaye that Chriſte was but a ſubſtaunce / that is very mā & not very god / or to ſay that Chriſte was very god & not very man / ſo is it (this doctour ſayth) an errour to ſay / that the ſacrament of the altar is but a ſubſtaunce. And alſo ſyr acordingly hereto in ye ſecrete of ye midde maſſe on Chriſte maſſe day it is writē thus. Idem refulſit deus / ſic

terrena ſubſtācia nobis cōferat qd diuinum eſt: which ſentence ſyr with ye ſecrete of ye forth ferye quatuor temporū ſeptembris. I pray you ſyr declare here openly in engliſh.
               And the Archebiſhop ſaid to me. I perceiue well ynough wher about thou art / & how ye deuell blyndeth the / yt thou may not vnderſtond ye ordinaunce of holy churche / nor conſent therto. But I commaunde the now anſwere me ſhorly. Beleueſt thou that after ye cōſecraciō of this forſaid ſacrament there abideth ſubſtaunce off breade or not?
               And I ſaid. Sir as I vnderſtond it is all one to graūte or to beleue / yt there dwelleth ſubſtaunce of breade / & to graūte & to beleue / yt this moſt worthy ſacramēt of chriſtes owne body is one accidēt without ſubiecte. But ſyr for as me kell as your aſking paſſeth myne vnderſtondīg I dare nother denye it nor graūte it / for it is ſkole mater / aboute which I beſyed me neuer for to know it: & therfore I cōmit this terme / accidēs ſine ſubiecto / to thoſe clerkes which delyre thē ſo in curiouſe & ſuttill ſophiſtrie / becauſe they determine oft ſo difficulte & ſtraūge maters / & wade & wāder ſo in thē / frō argumēt to argumēt with pro & cōtra / till yt they wote not where they are nor vnderſtonde not thēſelfe. But ye ſhame that thes proude ſophiſtrers haue to yelde them to men and before men maketh them ofte foolis / and to be concluded ſhamefully before god.

                  And the Archebiſhop ſaid to me. I purpoſe not to oblige the to the ſuttyll argumētes of clerkes / ſyns thou art vnable therto: But I purpoſe to make the obeye to the determinacion of holy churche.
               And I ſaid. Syr by open evidence and great witneſſe a thouſand yeare after the īcarnaciō of Chriſte ye determinaciō which I haue here before you reherſed was accepte of holy church as ſufficient to the ſaluacion of all them that wolde beleue it faithfully and worke therafter charitably. But ſyr the determinacion of this mater which was brought in ſyns the fende was loſed by frier Thomas agayn / ſpecially calling ye moſte worſhipfull ſacrament of Chriſtes owne body an accident without ſubiecte / which terme ſyns I knowe not that goddes lawe approueth it in this mater I dare not graunte / but vtterly I denye to make this friers ſentence or ony ſoche other my beleue / do with me god / what thou wilt.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaide to me. Well / well / thou ſhalt ſaye other wyſe or that I leaue the.
            
            
               BVt what ſaiſt thou to this ſecōde poynte yt is recorded ageinſt yt by woorthy mē of Shrewiſbury ſaing yt thou preachedſt opēly there ye ymages oughte not to be worſhipped in ony wiſe.
               And I ſaid. Syr I preached neuer thus / nor thorow gods grace I will not any tyme conſent

to thinke nor to ſaye thus nother pryuely nor apertly. For lo / the lorde witneſſeth by Moſes / yt the thinges which he made were righte good / & ſo than they were / and yet they are / and ſhall be good / and worſhipfull in their kynde. And therfore to the ende that god made them to / they are all preiſable and worſhipfull and ſpecially mā that was made after the ymage and likeneſſe of god is full worſhipfull in his kynde / ye this holy ymage that is man / god worſhippeth. And herefore euery man ſhulde worſhippe other in kynde / and alſo for heuenly vertues that mē vſe charitably. Alſo I ſaye / woode / tynne / gold / ſyluer / or any other mater that ymages are made of / all theſe creatures are worſhipfull in theire kynde and to the ende that god made them for. But the keruyng / caſtyng / nor peyntyng of ony ymagery made with mannes hande / all be hit that this doing be accepte of man of hyeſt ſtate and dignite / and ordened of them to be a kalendar to leude men that nother can nor will be learned to know god in his worde / nother by his creatures nor by hys wonderfull and diuerſe workīges: yet this ymagery ought not to be worſhipped in the forme nor in the likeneſſe of mannes crafte / neuertheleſſe that euery mater yt peinters peynte with / ſyns it is gods creature ought to be worſhipped in the kynde / & to ye ende yt god made & ordened it to ſerue man.
               Than ye archebiſhop ſaid to me. I graunt well that no body oweth to do worſhippe to any ſoche

ymages for thē ſelfe. But a crucifyxe ought to be worſhipped for the paſſion of chriſte that is peynted there in and ſo brought ther thorow to mannes mynde: and thus the ymages of the bleſſed trinite / ād of virgyn Mary chriſtes mother / and other ymages of ſayntes ought to be worſhipped. For lo earthely kynges and lordes which vſe to ſend their letters enſealid with their armes or with their preuy ſignet to men that are with them / are worſhipped of thes mē. For whā thes mē receiue their lordes letters in whiche they ſe & knowe the willes & biddīges of their lordes / in worſhippe of their lordes they do of their cappes to thes letters. Why not than / ſins in ymages made with mannes hande / we may rede and knowe many diuerſe thinges of god / and of his ſayntes / ſhall we not worſhippe their ymages?
               And I ſayde with my forſaid proteſtacyon. I ſaye that theſe worldly vſages of temporall lordes that ye ſpeake now of / maye be done in caſe without ſynne / but thys is no ſimilitude to worſhip ymages made by mānes hande / ſyns yt Moſes / Dauid / Salomon / Baruch / & other ſeyntes in the bible forbidde ſo pleynly ye worſhipyng of all ſoche ymages.
               Than the archebiſhop ſaid to me. Lewde loſell In the olde lawe before that chriſte toke mākind was no likeneſſe of any perſone of ye trinite nother ſhewed to mā nor knowē of mā: but nowe ſyns chriſte became mā / it is lefull to haue ymages

to ſhewe his māhode. Ye though many mē which are right greate clerkes & other alſo helde it an errour to peynte ye trinite. I ſay it is well done to make and to peynte the trinite in ymages. For it is great mouing of deuocion to mē to haue and to behold the trinite and other ymages of ſeyntes caruyd / caſte / and peynted. For beyonde the ſee are the beſte peynters that euer I ſaw. And ſyrs / I tell you this is their maner ād it is a goode maner. Whan that an ymage maker ſhall kerue / caſte in moulde / or peynte ony ymages / he ſhall go to a prieſte and ſhryue him as clene / as if he ſholde than dye and take penaunce / and make ſome certeyn vowe of faſtyng or of praiynge / or of pilgrimages doinge / praiyng the prieſte / ſpecially to praye for hym / that he may haue grace to make a faire and a deuoute ymage.
               And I ſaid. Syr I doute not / yf thes peynters that ye ſpeake of or ony other peynters vnderſtode truely the texte of Moſes / of Dauid / of the wiſe man / of Baruch and of other ſeyntes and doctoures / theſe peynters ſholde be moued to ſhryue them to god wyth full inwarde ſorowe of harte / takynge vpon them to doo right ſharpe penaunce for the ſynfull and vayne crafte of peyntinge / karuynge or caſtinge that they had vſed / promiſing god feithfully neuer to do ſo after / knowleging openly before all mē theyr reprouable earnīg. And alſo ſyr thes prieſtes yt ſhriue (as ye do ſay) peinters & inioyne thē to do

penaunce / and praye for theire ſpede promyſyng to them helpe of their prayers for to be curious in their ſynfull craftes: ſynne herein more greuouſly thā the peynters. For thes prieſtes do comforte and gyue them counſell to do that thynge / which of great peyne / ye / vnder the peyne of goddes curſe they ſholde vtterly forbydde them. For cerris ſyr / yf the wonderfull werking of god and the holy lyuynge and teachynge off Chriſte and off his apoſtles and prophetes were made knowen to the people by holy lyuynge and true and beſy teachynge of prieſtes: theſe thynges (ſyr) were ſufficient bokes and kalendares to knowe god by and his ſayntes without ony ymages made with mannes hond: but certis the vicious lyuynge of prieſtes and their couetouſneſſe are chefe cauſe of this errour and all other viciouſneſſe that reigneth among the people.
               Than the archebiſhop ſaid vnto me. I holde yt a vicious prieſt & a curſte / & all thē that are of thy ſecte: for all prieſtes of holy chirche / and all ymages that moue men to deuocion / thou & ſoche other go about to deſtroye. Looſell / ware it a feire thing to come in to a chirche / and ſee therin none ymage?
               And I ſaid. Syr they that come to the chyrche for to pray deuoutly to the lorde god may in their inwarde wittes be ye more feruent / that all their outwarde wittes be cloſed fro all outwarde ſeynge and hearing and fro all diſtroblaūce

and lettyngis. And ſyns Chriſte bleſſed them yt ſaw hym not bodely / and haue beleuyd feith fully in hym: It ſufficeth than to all men thorow hearing and knowing of goddis worde / and to doo there after for to beleue in god / though they ſee neuer ymagis made with mannis hande after ony Perſon of the trinite or of ony other ſeynte.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me with a feruēt ſpyrite. I ſay to ye Loſell / that it is right well done to make and to haue an ymage of the trinite Ye what ſaiſt thou? Ys it not a ſtiering thing to beholde ſoche an ymage?
               And I ſaid. Sir ye ſaid right now that in ye olde lawe or Chriſte toke mankynde / no likeneſſe of ony perſon of the trinite was ſhewid to men: wherfore ſir ye ſaid it was not thā lefull to haue ymagis / but now ye ſay ſyns Chriſte is becomen man / it is lefull to make & to haue an ymage of the trinite and alſo of other ſeyntis. But ſyr this thing wolde I learne of you. Syns the father of heuen / ye and euery perſon of the trinite was without beginnyng god almighty / & many holy prophetis that wer dedely men wer martireſed violently in the olde lawe / and alſo many men and women than died holy confeſſours Why was it not than as lefull and neceſſarie as now to haue made an ymage of the father of heuen / and to haue made & hadde other ymagis of martires / prophetis / and holy cōfeſſours to haue ben kalendaris to aduiſe men ād

moue them to deuocion / as ye ſay that ymagis now doo?
               And ye Archebiſſhop ſaid. The ſinagoge of Iues hadde not authorite to approue thes thingis as ye chirche of Chriſte hathe now.
               And I ſaid. Sir ſeint Gregory / was a great man in ye new lawe / and of great dignite / ād as ye comon lawe witneſſeth / he cōmendid greatly a biſſhop / in yt he forbadde vtterly ye ymagis made with mannis hande ſholde be worſhipid.
               And ye Archebiſſhop ſaid. Vngracious loſell thou faueriſt nomore trewthe than an hounde / Syns at ye roode at ye northe dore at London / at our lady at walſingam ād many other diuerſe placis in England ar many great and preiſable miracles done: ſhulde not the ymagis of ſoche holy ſeyntis and placis at ye reuerence of god and our lady & other ſeyntis be more worſhippid than other placis and ymagis wher no ſoche miracles ar done?
               And I ſaid. Sir ther is no ſoche vertue in ony ymagery that ony ymagis ſholde herefore be worſ
                     •
                  hippid / wherfore I am certein yt ther is no miracle done of god in ony place in erthe becauſe that ony ymagis made with mānis hā
                  de ſholde be worſhippid. And herefore ſir as I preached openly at ſhrewiſbery and other placis I ſay now here before you / yt no body ſholde truſte that ther war ony vertue in ymagery made with mannis hande / and herefor no body

ſholde vowe to them / nor ſeake them nor knele to them nor bow to them / nor pray to them / nor offer any thing to them / nor kyſſe them / nor enſence them. For lo the moſt worthy of ſoche ymagis / the braſen ſerpente by Moyſes made / at goddis bidding. The goode kyng Ezechie deſtroied worthily and thankefully: for bycauſe it was encenſed. Therfore ſir yf men take goode hede to the writing and to the lerning of ſeynt Auguſtine of ſeynt Gregory and of ſeynt Iohn Criſoſtome / ād of other ſeyntis & doctours how they ſpeake & write of miracles that ſhall be done now in ye laſte ende of ye worlde: it is to dreade yt for ye vnfeith fulneſſe of men & women the fende hath great power for to worke many of ye miracles yt now ar done in ſoche placis. For bothe men & women delyte now more for to heare & knowe miracles / than they doo to knowe goddis worde or to heare it effec
                     •
                  uouſly. Wherfore to ye great cōfuſion of all thē yt thus doo: Chriſte ſaith. The gnāciō of aduolteres requireth tokyns / miracles & wōders. Neuer theleſſe as diuerſe ſeyntis ſay / now whan ye feithe of god is publiſſhed in chriſtēdome / ye worde of god ſufficeth to mānis ſaluaciō without ſoche miracles: & thus alſo ye worde of god ſufficeth to all feithfull mē & womē without ony ſoche ymagis / but goode ſir / ſyns ye father of heuē yt is god in his godhed is ye moſte vnknowē thīg yt may be ād ye moſte wōderfull ſpyrit / hauyng in it no ſhape or likeneſſe of ony mēbres of oni dedely creature

In what likeneſſe or what ymage may god the father be ſhewid or peintyd?
               And the Archhebiſſhop ſaid. As holy chirche hathe ſufferid and yet ſufferith the ymagis of all the trinite and other ymagis to be peyntid and ſhewid / ſufficeth to them that ar membres of holy chirche But ſyns thou art a rotten membre cutt away frome holy chirche thou fauereſt not the ordinaūce therof. But ſyns the daye paſſith / leaue we this mater.
               ANd than he ſaid to me. What ſaiſt thou to ye thirde poynte yt is certified againſt the preching openly in ſhrewiſbery that pilgrimage is not lefull. And ouer this thou ſaidiſt / that thoſe men and women that go on pilgrimagis to Cāturbery / to Beuerley / to karlington / to walſingame and to ony ſoche other placis ar acurſed and made fooliſch ſpending their goodes in waſte.
               And I ſaid / ſir by this certificacion I am accuſed to you that I ſholde teache / that no pilgrimage is lefull. But I ſaid neuer thus. For I knowe that ther be trew pilgrimagis and lefull and full pleſaunt to god / and therfore ſir how ſo euer myne enemies haue certified you of me I tolde at ſhrewiſbery of two maner of pilgrimagis.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me / whome calleſt thou trewe pilgrimes?
               And I ſaid. Sir with my proteſtaciō I call them trew pilgremis trauelyng toward ye bliſſe

of heuen which in the ſtate / degre / or ordre ye god calleth them / doo beſy them feithfully for to occupie all their wittes bodely and goſtely to knowe trewly and to keape feithfully the biddinges of god / hatyng and fleyng all the ſeuen dedely ſynnes and euery braunche of thē reulyng them verteuouſly (as it is ſaid before) with all their wittes / doyng diſcretely wilfully & gladly all the werkis of mercy bodely and goſ
                     •
                  ely after their connyng and power / ablyng them to the gyftes of the holy goſte diſpoſing them to receyue in their ſoules and to holde therin the right bleſſinges of Chriſte beſeyng them to knowe ād to kepe the ſeuene principall vertues / and ſo thā they ſhall obteyne here thorow grace for to vſe thankfully to god all the condicions of charite / and than they ſhall be moouyd with the good ſpirite of god for to examyne ofte and diligently their conſcience / that nother wilfully nor wittingly they erre in ony article of beleue / hauyng continually (as frailte will ſuffer) all their beſineſſe to drede and to flee the offence of god / ād to looue ouer all thing and to ſeke euer to doo his pleſaunt will. Of theſe pilgremis I ſaid / what ſo euer goode thoughte that they ony tyme thinke: what verteuous worde that they ſpeake: and what frutefull worke that they worke: euery ſoche thoughte / worde and werke is a ſteppe noū
                  bered of god toward hym into heuene. Thes for ſaid pilgremis of god / delyte ſore whan they heare of ſeyntis or of verteuous men & women

how they forſoke wilfully the proſperite of this lyfe / how they withſtode the ſuggeſtion of the fende / how they reſtreined their fleſchly luſtes / how diſcrete they wer in their penaunce doyng how pacient they wer in all their aduerſites / how prudent they wer in counſeling of men & women moouyng them to hate all ſynne and to flye them / ād to ſhame euer greatly there of and to loue all vertues and to drawe to them / ymaginyng how Chriſte and his folowers by exā
                  ple of hym / ſuffered ſkornis and ſclaunders / & how paciently they abode and toke the wrongfull manaſyng of tyrauntis / how homely they wer and ſeruiſable to poore men to relieue and comforte them bodely and goſtely after their power and connyng / and how deuote they wer in praiers / how feruent they wer in heuenly deſyres / and how they abſented them fro ſpectacles of veyne ſeyngis and hearingis / and how ſtable they wer to lett and to deſtroye all vices / ād how laborious ād ioifull they wer to ſowe & to plante vertues. Thes heuenly condicions ād ſoche other haue ye pilgremis / or endeuer thē for to haue: whoſe pilgrimagie god acceptith And ageyne I ſaide / as their werkis ſhew / the moſte parte of men and women that go now on pilgrimagis haue not thes forſaid condicions / nor loueth to beſy them feithfully for to haue For as I well know ſyns I haue full ofte aſſaide / examyne who ſo euer will twentie of thes pilgremis: and he ſhall not fynde thre men or women

yt knowe ſurely a cōmaundmēt of god / nor can ſay their Pater noſter and Aue maria / nor their Credo redely in ony maner of langage. And as I haue learnid and alſo know ſomwhat by experience of thes ſame pilgremis rellyng the cauſe / why that many men and women go hither and thither now on pilgrimagis / it is more for the helthe of their bodies than of their ſoules / more for to haue richeſſe and proſperite of thys worlde / than for to be ēryched with vertues in their ſoules / more to haue here worldely and fleſchely frendſhip / than for to haue frendſhip of god & of his ſeintis in heuen. For what ſo euer thing man or woman dothe / the frendſhip of god nor of ony other ſeynt cā not be hadde without keaping of goddis commaundemē
                  tis. Forther with my proteſtacion I ſay now as I ſaid in ſhrewiſbery / though they that haue fleſchely willes trauell fer their bodies and ſpē
                  de mekill money to ſeake and to viſite the bonys or ymagis (as they ſay they do) of this ſeynte or of yt: ſoche pilgrimage goyng is nother praiſable nor thākefull to god nor to ony ſeinte of god: ſyns in effect all ſoche pelgrimes deſpiſe god & all his cōmaūdmētis & ſeyntis. For ye cōmaūdmētis of god they will nother knowe nor keape / nor cōforme thē to lyue verteuoſly by example of Chriſte & of his ſeyntis. Wherfor ſyr I haue prechid & taucht opēly / & ſo I purpoſe all my lyfe time to do with gods helpe / ſaīg yt ſoche fōde people waſt blamefully gods goods in their veyne

pilgrimagis / ſpending their goodes vpon vicious hoſtelars / which ar ofte vnclene women of their bodies: and at the leſte thoſe goodes with the which thei ſholde doo werkis of mercie after goddis bidding to poore nedy men and women. ¶Thes poore mennis goodes and their lyuelode thes runnars about offer to riche prieſtis / which haue mekill more lyuelode than they neade / And thus thoſe goodes they waſte wilfully and ſpende thē vniuſtely ageinſt goddis bidding vpon ſtraungers / with which thei ſholde helpe and releue after goddis will their poore nedy neighbours at home: ye & ouer this foly / ofte tymes diuerſe men and women of thes runners thus madly hither ād thither in to pilgrimage borowe hereto other mennis goodes / ye and ſome tyme they ſtele mennis goodes hereto / and they pay them neuer agein. Alſo ſir I know well that whan diuerſe men & women will go thus after their own willes & fynding out one pilgrimage / they will orden with them before to haue with them bothe men ād women that can well ſynge wanton ſonges / and ſome other pilgremis will haue with them bagge pipes / ſo that euery towne that they come throwe what with the noyſe of their ſyngyng / ād with the ſounde of their piping / and with the Iangelyng of their Canterbery bellis / and with the barkyng out of doggis after them that they make more noyſe than if ye kyng came there awaye with all his clarions and many other menſtrelles.

And if thes men and women be a monethe out in their pilgrimage / many of thē ſhall be an halfe yeare after greate iangelers / tale tellers and lyers.
               And the Archebiſhop ſaid to me. Leude loſell thou ſeeſt not ferre ynough in this mater / for thou cōſidereſt not the great trauell of pilgremys therfore thou blameſt that thing that is praiſable. I ſay to yt that it is right well done / that pilgremys haue with them bothe ſyngers & alſo pipers that whan one of them that goeth barfote ſtriketh his too vpon a ſtone ād hurteth hym ſore / and maketh hym to blede: it is well done that he or his felow begyn than a ſonge / or els take out of his boſome a baggepype for to dryue away with ſoche myrthe the hurte of his felow. For with ſoche ſalace the trauell and werineſſe off pylgremes is lightely and merily broughte forthe.
               And I ſaid. Sir ſeynt Paule teacheth men to wepe with them yt wepe.
               And the archebiſhoppe ſaide. What iangliſt thou ageinſt mēnis deuociō / what ſoeuer thou or ſoch other ſay / I ſay that the pilgrimage that now is vſed is to thē that doo it / a prayſable & a good meane to come the rather to grace. But I holde the vnable to know this grace: for thou enforſeſtthe to lett ye deuocion of the people: ſyns by authorite of holy ſcripture men maye lefully haue & vſe ſoche ſolace as thou reproueſt. For Dauid in his laſte pſalme teacheth me to haue

diuerſe inſtrumētes of muſike for to prayſe ther with god.
               And I ſaide. Sir by the ſentence of diuerſe doctours expounding the pſalmes of Dauid / ye muſike and menſtrelcy that Dauid & other ſeyntes of the olde lawe ſpake of / owe now nother to be taken nor vſed by the letter / but thes inſtrumē
                  tes with theire muſike ought to be interpreted goſtely: for all thoſe figures are called vertues and grace / with which vertues men ſhold pleaſe god and prayſe his name. For ſaynt Paule ſaith. All ſoche thynges befell to them in figure. Therfore ſir I vnderſtonde that the letter of this pſalme of Dauid / and of ſoche other pſalmes and ſentences dothe ſlee them that take thē now letterally. This ſentence I vnderſtond ſyr Chriſt approueth him ſelf putting out the menſtrelles / or that he wolde quycken the deade damſell.
               And ye archebiſhop ſaide to me. Leude loſell / is it not lefull to vs to haue organes in ye chirche for to worſhip therwith all god? And I ſaid
               Ye ſyr by mannys ordynaunce / but by the ordinaunce of god a goode ſermonne to the peoples vnderſtondyng were mekill more pleſaunt to god.
               And the Archebiſſhoppe ſayde / that organes and goode delectable ſonge quyckened and ſharpened more mennys wyttes than ſholde ony ſermonne.
               But I ſaid. Sir luſty men and worldly louers

delyte & coue
                     •
                  e & trauell to haue all theire wittes quickened & ſharpened with diuerſe ſenſible ſolace: but all ye feithfull louers & folowers of Chriſte haue all their delyte to heare goddis worde / and to vnderſtond it truely / and to worke therafter faithfully and continually. For no doute to dreade to offende god / and to loue to pleaſe him in all thing quyckeneth and ſharpeneth all the wittes of chriſtes choſen people: and ableth thē ſo to grace / that they ioye greatly to withdrawe their eares / & all their wittes ād membres frome all worldly delyte and frome all fleſchly ſolace. For ſeynt Ierome (as I thinke) ſaith. No body may ioye with this worlde ād reigne with Chriſte.
               And the Archebiſhop (as yf he had ben diſpleaſed with myne anſwere) ſaid to his clerkes. What geſſe ye this ydiote will ſpeke ther / wher he hath none dreade: ſyns he ſpeaketh thus nowe here in my preſēce? Well well / by god thou ſhalt be ordened for. And than he ſpake to me all angerly.
               WHat ſaiſt thou to this forthe poynte / yt is certified ageinſt the preching opēly ād boldely in Shrewiſbery / ye prieſtes haue no title to tythes.
               And I ſaid. Sir I named ther no worde of tithes in my preaching. But / more thā a moneth after that I was arreaſted / there in pryſone a man came to me in to the pryſone aſkynge me what I ſayde of tythes. And I ſaide to him.

Sir in this towne are many clerkes & prieſtes of which ſome are called religious mē though many of them be ſeculers. Therfore aſkeye off them this queſtion. And this man ſaide to me. Sir our prelates ſay / that we ar alſo obliged to paye oure tythes of all thinges that renewe to vs / and that they ar acurſed / yt with drawe ony parte wittingly fro them of their tythes. And I ſaid (ſyr) to that man / as with my proteſtacyon I ſay now here before you: that I hadde wonder that ony prieſte dare ſay / men to be acurſed with out grounde of goddis worde. And ye mā ſaid. Sir our prieſtes ſay that they curſe mē thus by authorite of goddes lawe. And I ſayde. Sir I knowe not wher this ſentence of curſing is authoriſed now in the bible. And therfor ſyr I praye you that ye will aſke the moſte connīg clerke of this towne / that ye may knowe where this ſentence curſynge them that tythe not now is writen in goddes lawe: for yf it were writen there I wolde right gladly be learned where. But ſhortely this man wolde not go from me / to aſke this queſtion of a nother body / but required me there / as I wolde anſwere before god / if in this caſe the curſing of prieſtes wer laufull and approued of god. And ſhortely herewith came to my mynde the learnyng of ſeynt Peter / teachīg prieſtes ſpecially to halow ye lord chriſt in their hartes: beinge euermore redye (as ferre as in thē is) to anſwere thorowe faith & hope to thē yt aſke of thē a reaſō. And this leſſon Peter

teacheth mē to vſe with a meke ſpyrite & with dreade of ye lorde. Wherfore ſyr / I ſaid to this man in this wiſe. In the olde lawe which endyd not fully till the tyme yt chriſte roſe vp ageyn fro dethe to lyfe) god commaunded tythes to be gyuē to the leuites for the great beſyneſſe & dayly trauell that pertayned to their office: But prieſtes / becauſe their trauell was mekyll more eaſy and light / thā was the office of the leuites: god ordeyned that prieſtes ſholde take for their lifelode to do their office / ye tenth parte of tho tythes that wer geuē to the leuites. But naw (I ſaid) in the newe lawe nother Chriſte nor ony of hys apoſtles toke tythes of the people / nor cōmaunded the people to pay tythes nother to prieſtes / nor to deacons. But Chriſte taught the people to do almeſſe / that is werkes of mercy / to poore nedy mē of ſurpluſe / that is ſuperfluouſe of their temporall goodes which they hadde more thā them nedid reaſonably to their neceſſary lyuelode. And thus (I ſaid) not of tythes / but of pure almeſſe of the people Chriſte lyued and his apoſtles / whan they were ſo beſyre in teachynge off the worde of god to the people that they myght not trauell other wyſe for to gett their lyuelode. But after Chriſtes aſcenſyon / and whan the apoſtles had receyued ye holy goſte / they traueled with theire handes for to get theire lyuelode / whan that they myght thus doo for beſye preachynge. Therfore by example of hymſelfe ſeynt Paule teacheth all the prieſtes of Chriſte for to

trauell with theire hande / whan for beſye teachyng of the people they myght thus do. And thus all theſe prieſtes whoſe prieſtehode god accepteth nowe / or will accepte or dyd in the apoſtles tyme / and after their diſceaſe: will do to the worldes ende. But (as Ciſtercienſis telleth) in the thouſande yeare of oure lorde Ieſu Chriſte / two hundreth and a leuenth yere / one pope the tenth Gregory ordened new / tythes fyrſt to be gyuen to prieſtes nowe in the newe lawe. But ſeynt Paule in his tyme whoſe trace or example all prieſtes of god enforce them to folowe / ſeyng the couetouſneſſe that was amonge the people deſyrynge to deſtroye this foule ſynne thorow the grace of god / and true vertuouſe lyuynge and example of hymſelfe: wrette and taucht all prieſtes for to folowe him as he folowed Chriſte paciently / wyllyngly and gladly in hye pouerte. Wherfore Paule ſaithe thus. The lorde hathe ordened that they yt preache the goſpell ſhall lyue of the goſpell. But we (ſaith Paul) that couet & beſy vs to be feithfull folowers of Chriſt / vſe not this power. For lo (as Paule witneſſeth afterwarde) whan he was full pore and nedy preaching among the people: he was not chargeous vnto them / but with his handes he traueled not onely to get his owne lyuynge / but alſo ye lyuyng of other poore & nedy creatures. And ſyns the people was neuer ſo couetouſe nor ſo auarouſe (I geſſe) as thei ar now it were good counſell / yt all prieſtes toke good hede to

this heuenly learnyng of Paul / folowimg him here / in wilfull pouerte / nothinge charging the people for their bodely lyuelode. But becauſe ye many prieſtes do contrary Paule in this forſayde doctryne: Paul biddeth the people take hede to thoſe priyſtes that folow him as he had geuē them example. As / if Paul wolde ſay thus to ye people. Accepte ye none other prieſtes than thei that lyue after the fourme that I haue tauchte you. For certeyn in what ſoeuer dignite or ordre that ony prieſte is in / yf he conforme him not to folowe Chriſte and his apoſtles in wilfull pouerte / and in other heuenly vertues / and ſpecially in true preachynge of goddes worde: though ſoche a one be named a prieſte / yet he is no more but a prieſte in name / for the worke of a verye prieſte ſoch a one wanteth. This ſentence approueth Auguſttne / Gregory / Chriſoſtome / & Lincon̄ playnly.
               And ye archebiſhop ſaid to me. Thinkeſt thou this holſome learninge for to ſowe openly or yet priuely among ye people? Certeyn this doctryne cōtrarieth playnly ye ordinaunce of holy fathers which haue ordened graūted & licenced prieſtes to be in diuerſe degres / & to lyue by tythes & offringes of ye people & by other deuties.
               And I ſaid. Sir / if prieſtes wer now in meſurable meſure & numbre / & lyued vertuouſly / & taucht beſyly & truely the worde of god by example of Chriſt and of his apoſtles: withouten tythes / offerynges / and other dewties yt prieſtes

nowe chalenge & take / y• people wolde gyue thē frely ſufficient lyuelode.
               And a clerke ſaid to me. How wilt thou make this good that ye people will gyue frely to prieſtes their lyuelode / ſyns yt now by ye lawe euery prieſte cā ſcarcely cōſtrayne ye people to gyue thē their lyuelode?
               And I ſaid. Sir it is now no wonder though the people grudge to gyue priſtes the lyuelode that they aſke: for mekill people knowe nowe how that prieſtes ſhulde lyue / ād how that they lyue contrary to Chriſte and to his apoſtles. And therfore the people is full heuy to paye (as they do) their temporall goodes to perſones ād to other vicares and prieſtes / whiche ſholde be feithfull diſpenſatours of the pareſhes goodes taking to themſelfes nomore but a ſcarce lyuīg of tythes nor of offrynges by the ordinaunce of the comon lawe. For what ſoeuer prieſtes take of the people: be it tythe or offering or ony other deutie or ſeruyce: the prieſtes ought not to haue thereof nomore but a bare lyuyng / ād to departe the reſidew to the poore men & women ſpecially of the pariſhe / of whome they take this temporall lyuynge. But the moſt dele of prieſtes nowe waſteth their pareſhes goodes ād ſpendeth thē at their owne will after the worlde in theire veyne luſtes / ſo that in fewe places poore mē haue dewly (as they ſholde haue) their owne ſuſtenaunce / nother of tythes nor of offerynges / nor of other large wages & foundacions yt prieſtes

take of ye people in diuerſe maners aboue it that they nede for nedefull ſuſtenaunce of meate and clothinge. But ye poore nedy people ar forſaken and lefte of prieſtis to be ſuſteinyd of ye paroſhenis / as if the prieſtis toke nothing of ye paroſhenis / for to helpe ye poore people with. And thus ſyr into ouer greate chargis of the paroſhenis they pay their tēporall goods twiſe / wher ones myght ſuffice / if prieſtis wer trew diſpenſatours. Alſo ſir the paroſhenis that pay their tē
                  porall goodes (be they tythes or offeringes) to prieſtis that doo not their office among them iuſtely / ar parteners of euery ſynne of thoſe prieſtis: becauſe that they ſuſteyne thoſe prieſtis foly in their ſynne with their tēporall goods. Yf thes thinges be well conſiderid what wonder is it than ſir / if the paroſhenis grudge ageinſt thes diſpenſatours?
               Than the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me. Thou y• ſholdeiſt be iudged and reulyd by holy chirche / preſumptuouſly thou demeſt holy chirche to haue erryd in the ordinaunce of tyhes ād other dewties to be payd to priſtis. Yt ſhall be long or thou thryue Loſell / that thou deſpiceſt thy goſtely mother. How dariſt thou ſpeake this Loſell among the people? Ar not tythes geuyn to prieſtis for to lyue by?
               And I ſaid. Sir ſeynt Paul ſaith that tythes wer gyuen in the olde lawe toleuytes ād to prieſtis / that came of the lynage of Leui / But our prieſt he ſaith came not of the lynage of Leui / 

but of ye lynage of Iuda: to which Iuda no tythes w
                     •
                  re promiſed to be geuyn. And therfore Paul ſaith / ſyns the prieſthode is chaūged fro the generacion of Leui to the generacion of Iuda / it is neceſſarie yt chaungyng alſo be made of ye lawe. So yt prieſtis lyue now without tythes and other dewties yt they now claime / folowing Chriſte and his apoſtles in wilfull pouerte / as they haue gyuen them example. For ſyns Chriſte lyued all ye tyme of his preaching by pure almoſe of the people / and by example of hym his apoſtles lyued in ye ſame wyſe / or els by the trauell of their hādis / as it is ſaid aboue Euery prieſte whoſe prieſthode Chriſte approuyth knowith well / and confeſſith in worde / & in werke that a diſciple owith not to be aboue his maſter / but it ſufficeth to a diſciple to be as his maſter / ſymple / and pure / meke and pacient: & by exāple ſpecially of his maſter Chriſte / euery prieſte ſholde reule hym in all his lyuyng / and ſo after his connyng & power a prieſte ſholde beſy hym to enfourme & to reule whome ſo euer he myght charitably.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me with a great ſpirite Goddis curſe haue thou and myne for this teaching: for thou woldiſt hereby make ye olde law more fre ād perfite than the new law. For thou ſaiſt that it is lefull to leuites and to prieſtis to take tythes in the olde lawe / and ſo to enioye their priuelegies: but to vs prieſtis in the new lawe thou ſaiſt it is not lefull to take tyhes.

And thus thou geuiſt leuytes of the olde lawe more fredome than to prieſtis of the new lawe
               And I ſaid. Sir I meruell / that ye vnderſtonde this playne texte of Paul thus. Ye wote well / that the leuites and prieſtes in the olde lawe that toke tythes wer not ſo fre nor ſo perfite as Chriſte and his apoſtles that tooke no tythes And ſir there is a doctour (I thinke yt it is ſeynt Ierome) that ſaith thus. The prieſtis that chalenge now in the new lawe tythes / ſay in effecte / that Chriſte is not becomen man / nor that he hath yet ſuffered dethe for mannis loue. Wherfore this doctour ſaith thys ſentence. Syns tythes wer the hyres and wagis limyted to leuites and to prieſtes of the olde lawe for bearing about of the tabernacle / and for fleayng and fleayng of beaſtis / and for burning of ſacrifice / ād for keping of the temple / and for tromping of battell before the oſte of Iſrael / and other diuerſe obſeruauncis that perteinyd to their office: thoſe prieſtis that will chalenge or take tythes: denye that Chriſte is comen in fleſſhe and doo ye prieſtis office of the olde lawe for whome tythes wer graūted: for els (as this doctour ſaith) prieſtis take now tythes wrongfully.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to his clerkes. Herde ye euer loſell ſpeake thus? Certeyn this is the learnyng of them all / yt wher ſo euer they come / and they may be ſuffered / they enforce

them to expugne the fredome of holy chirche.
               And I ſaid. Sir why call you the takyng of tythes and of ſoche other dewties that prieſtes chalenge now wrongfully the fredome of holy chirche: Syns nother Chriſte nor his apoſtles chalengid nor tooke ſoche dewties. Herefore thes takyngis of prieſtis now ar not callyd iuſtely the fredome of holy chirche / but all ſoche geuyng and takyng ought to be called and holden the ſclaunderous couetouſneſſe of men of ye holy chirche.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me. Why Loſell wilt not thou and other that ar confedered with the / ſeake out of holy ſcripture and of the ſentēce of doctours all ſharpe authorites agēſt lordis and knyghtis and ſquyeris and ageinſt other ſeculer men / as thou doeſte ageynſt prieſtes?
               And I ſaid. Sir what ſo euer men or womē lordis or ladies or ony other that ar preſent in our preaching ſpecially or in our cōmunyng after our connyng we tell out to thē their office ād their charges: but ſir ſyns Chriſoſtome ſaith yt prieſtis ar the ſtomake of ye people / it is nedefull in preaching and alſo in communyng / to be moſte beſy aboute this prieſthode / ſyns by the viciouſnes of prieſtis both lordis and comons ar moſte ſynfully infected and ledde into the worſte. And becauſe that ye couetouſnes of prieſtis / & pride and the boſte yt they haue & make of their dignite and power / deſtroieth not onely

the vertues of prieſthode in prieſtis them ſelfe but alſo ouer this / it ſtierith god to take greate vē
                  geaunce both vpon lordis and vpon comons which ſuffer thes prieſtes charitably
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me. Thou iudgeſt euery prieſte proude yt will not go arayed as thou doſte. By god I deme hym to be more meke that gothe euery day in a ſcarlet gowne / than thou in ye threde bare blew gowne. Wherby knoweſt thou a proude man?
               And I ſaid. Sir a proude prieſte may be knowen when he denyeth to folow Chriſte / and his apoſtles in wilfull pouerte and other vertues and couerith worldly worſhip / and taketh it gladly / and gatherith to gither with pletyng manaſyng / or with flattering or with ſimony ony worldly goodis: and moſte if a prieſte beſy hym not chefely in hymſelf and after in all other men and women after his connyng ād power to withſtond ſynne.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me. Though thou kneweſt a prieſte to haue all thes vices / ād though thou ſaweſt a prieſte louely lye now by a woman knowing hir fleſchly: woldeſt thou herfore deme this prieſte dampnable? I ſay to the that in the tournyng about of thy hande ſoche a ſynner may be verily repented.
               And I ſaid. Sir I will not dāpne any mā for any ſynne that I know done or may be done / ſo that the ſynner leuyth his ſynne. But by authorite of holy ſcripture / he that ſynneth thus

openly as ye ſhewe here / is dāpnable for doyng of ſoche a ſynne / & moſte ſpecially a prieſte that ſholde be example to all other for to hate ād flie ſynne: and in how ſhort tyme yt euer ye ſay that ſoche a ſynner may be repented: he oweth not of hym that knoweth his ſynnyng to be iudged verily repentaunt / without open euidence of greate ſhame & harty ſorow for his ſynne. For who ſo euer & ſpecially a prieſte that vſeth pride / enuy / couetouſnes / lechery / ſimony / or ony other vices: and ſhewith not as opyn euidence of repentaunce as he hath gyuen euyll example and occaſion of ſynnyng / if he contynew in ony ſoche ſynne as long as he may / it is likely that ſynne leaueth hym / and he not ſynne / ād as I vnderſtonde ſoche a one / ſynneth vnto dethe / for whome no body oweth to pray / as ſeynt Iohn ſaith
               And a clerke ſaid than to the Archebiſſhop. Sir the lenger that ye appoſe hym / the worſe he is: and the more that ye beſy you to amende him the waiwarder he is: for he is of ſo ſhrewde a kynde / that he ſhamyth not onely to be hymſelf a foule neſte: but without ſhame he beſiech hym to make his neſte fouler.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to his clerke
                     •
                   Suffer a while / for I am at an ende with him for ther is one other poynte certified ageynſt hym / and I will heare what he ſaith therto.
               ANd ſo than he ſaid to me. Lo it is here certified ageinſt the / that thou preachidſt openly at ſhrewiſbery / that

it is not lefull to ſweare in ony caſe.
               And I ſaid. Sir I preachid neuer ſo openly / nor I haue not tauchte in this wyſe in ony place. But ſir as I preachid in ſhrewiſbery / with my proteſtacion I ſay to you now here: yt by the authorite of ye goſpell ād of ſeynt Iames and by witneſſe of diuerſe ſeyntis & doctours I haue preachid openly in one place or other that it is not lefull in ony caſe to ſweare by ony creature. And ouer this ſir I haue alſo preachid ād tauchte by ye forſaid authorites yt no body ſhold ſweare in ony caſe / if yt without othe in ony wyſe he yt is charged to ſweare myght excuſe hym to thē yt haue power to compell hym to ſweare in lefull thyng & laufull. But if a mā may not excuſe hym without othe to thē yt haue power to cōpell hym to ſweare / than he owght to ſweare onely by god / takyng hym onely yt is ſothefaſtneſſe / for to witneſſe the ſothefaſteneſſe.
               Anb than a Clerke aſkid me / yf it wer not lefull to a ſubiecte at the bidding of his prelate for to knele downe and towche the holy goſpell booke and kyſſe it ſayng: So helpe me god and this holy dome / for he ſholde after his connyng and power doo all thyng that his prelate commaundeth hym. ¶And I ſaid to thē. Sirs ye ſpeke here full generally or largely What if a prelate commaūded his ſubiecte to doo an vnlaufull thing / ſhold he obey therto?
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me A ſubiecte ought not to ſuppoſe that his prelate will bidde

him doo an vnlaufull thīg For a ſubiecte ought to thinke / yt his prelate will bidde hym doo nothīg but yt / he will anſwere for before god yt it is lefull: & thā though ye bidding of ye prelate be vnliefull / ye ſubiecte hath no parell to fulfill it ſyns that he thinketh ād iudgeth that what ſo euer thing his prelate biddeth hym doo / that it is lefull to hym for to doo it.
               And I ſaid. Sir I truſte not hereto. But to our firſte purpoſe / ſir I tell you yt I was onys in a gentill mannis houſe / and there war than two clerkes there. A maſter of diuinite / & a man of lawe / which mā of lawe was alſo comuning in diuinite. And among other thinges thes mē ſpake of othes / and the man of lawe ſaid. At ye bidding of his ſouereyn which hadde power to charge hym to ſweare / he wold lay his hande vpon a booke and heare his charge / and if his charge to his vnderſtonding wer vnlefull / he wolde haſtely with draw his hande frome the booke: ād if he perceiued his charge to be lefull he wolde holde ſtill his hande vpon ye booke takyng there onely god to witneſſe / that he wolde fulfill that lefull charge after his power. And the maſter of diuinite ſaid than to hym thus. Certeyn he that leyeth his hande vpon a booke in this wyſe ād makyth there a promeſſe to doo that thing that he is commaunded / is obliged there / by booke othe than to fulfill his charge. For no doute he that chargeth hym to lay his hande thus vpon a booke / towching the booke &

ſwearing by it / ād kyſſing it / promiſyng in this fourme to doo this thyng or that / will ſay & witneſſe that he that towcheth thus a booke and kyſſeth it hath ſworne vpon that booke: and all other men that ſee that man thus doo / and alſo all tho that heare hereof in the ſame wyſe wyll ſaye and witneſſe / that thys man hathe ſworne vpon a boke / wherfore the maſter of diuinite ſayde. Yt was not lefull nother to gyue nor to take ony ſoche charge vpon a boke / for euery boke is nothing els but diuerſe creatures of whiche it is made of. Therfore to ſwere vpon a boke is to ſweare by creatures / and this ſwearinge is euer vnlefull. This ſentence witneſſeth Chriſoſtome playnly blaming them greatly that bringe forthe a boke for to ſweare vpon / charginge clerkes that in no wiſe they conſtrayne ony body to ſweare / whether they thinke a man to ſweare true or falſe.
               And the Archebiſhop and his clerkes ſcorned me & blamyd me greatle for this ſaiyng. And ye Archebiſhop manaſſed me with great puniſſhement and ſharpe / except I lefte this opinion of ſwearinge.
               And I ſaide. Sir this is not myne opinion / but it is the opinion of chriſt our ſauyour / and of ſeynt Iamis & of Chriſoſtome ād other diuerſe ſeyntes & doctours.
               Than the Archebiſhope badde a clercke rede this homely of Chriſoſtome which homely thys clerke helde in his hande writen in a roll / which

rolle the Archebiſſhope cauſed to be taken fro my felow at Canterbury: and ſo than this clerke redde this rolle till he came to a clauſe / wher Chriſoſtome ſaithe / that it is ſynne to ſweare well.
               And than a clerke Malueren (as I geſſe) ſaid to ye archebiſhop. Sir I praye you wete of hī how yt he vnderſtōdeth Chriſoſtome here / ſaing it to be ſynne to ſwere well.
               And ſo y• Archebiſſhop aſked me how I vnderſtode here Chriſoſtome.
               And certeyn I was ſomewhat afraide to anſwere hereto. For I had not beſyed me to ſtudy about the ſenſe thereof / but lyfting vp my mynde to god I prayed him of grace. And as faſte as I thought how Chriſte ſaid to his apoſtles / whā for my name ye ſhal be brought before iudges I ſhall gyue into your mouth wiſdome that youre aduerſaryes ſhall not ageynſt ſaye: & truſting feithfully in the worde of god. I ſaid. Sir I know well that many men and women haue now ſwearing ſo in cuſtome / that thei know not nor will not knowe that they do euell for to ſweare as they do / but they thīke & ſay yt they do well for to ſweare as they do / though they know wel yt they ſweare vntruely. For they ſaye / they maye by their ſwearing (though it be falſe) voide blame or temporall harme which they ſholde haue yf they ſweare not thus. And ſir many mē & women maynteyne ſtrongly that they ſweare well whan that thinge is ſothe that they ſweare for.

Alſo full many men and women ſay nowe / that it is well done to ſweare by creatures / whā they maye not (as they ſaye) otherwiſe be beleued. Annd alſo full many men and women now ſay that it is well done to ſweare by god / and by oure ladye / and by other ſeyntes for to haue thē in mynde. But ſyns all theſe ſaiynges ar but excuſations and ſynne / me thinketh ſir that his ſentēce of Chriſoſtome may be alleged well ageinſte all ſoch ſwerers / witneſſing that all thes ſynne greuouſly / though they thinke themſelf for to ſweare in this forſaid wyſe well. For it is euyll done and greate ſynne for to ſweare trewthe whan in ony maner / a man may excuſe hī with out othe.
               And the archebiſhop ſaid / that Chriſoſtome might be thus vnderſtonde.
               And than a clerke ſaid to me. Wilt thou tarye my lorde no lenger / but ſubmit the here mekely to the ordinaunce of holy chirche and laye thyne hande vpon a booke touching the holy goſpell of god / promyſynge not onely with thy mouthe but alſo with thyne harte to ſtande to my lordes ordinaunce?
               And I ſaid. Sir haue I not told you here / howe that I herde a maſter of diuinite ſay that in ſoche a caſe it is all one to touche a boke / and to ſweare by a boke?
               And ye archebiſhop ſaid. There is no maſter of diuinite in Englond ſo greate / that yf he hold thys opinion before me / but I ſhall puniſſhe

him as I ſhall do the / except thou ſweare as I ſhall charge the.
               And I ſaid. Sir is not Chriſoſtome an ententyfe doctour?
               And the Archebiſhop ſaide. Ye.
               And I ſayde. Yf Chriſoſtome proueth hym woorthy greate blame that bryngeth forthe a booke to ſwere vppon / it muſte nedes folowe that he is more to blame that ſweareth on that booke.
               And the Archebiſhop ſaid. Yf Chriſoſtome ment accordingly to the ordinaunce of holy chirche we will accepte him.
               And than ſaid a clerke to me. Ys not the worde of god & god himſelf equipollent / that is / off one authorite? And I ſaide. Ye.
               Than he ſaid to me. Why wilt thou not ſwere than by the goſpell of god / yt is gods worde / ſyns it is all one to ſweare by ye worde of god / & by god himſelfe.
               And I ſaid. Sir / ſyns I may not nowe other wyſe be beleued but by ſwearynge I perceyue (as Auguſtine ſaithe) that it is not ſpedefull yt ye that ſhold be my brothern ſholde not beleue me: therfore I am redy by the worde of god (as the lorde commaunded me by his worde) to ſweare.
               Than the clerke ſaid to me. Laye than thyne hāde vpō ye boke touching ye holy goſpell of god and take thy charge.
               And I ſaid. Sir I vnderſtonde that the holy

goſpell of god maye not be touched with mannes hande.
               And the clerke ſaide. I fonded / and that I ſayde not trewthe.
               And I aſked this clerke whether it wer more to reade the goſpell or to touche ye goſpell.
               And he ſaid / it was more to reade ye goſpell.
               Than I ſaid. Sir by authorite of ſeynt Ierome the goſpell is not the goſpell for reding of ye letter / but for ye beleue that men haue in ye worde of god / that it is the goſpell that we beleue / and not the letter yt we rede: for becauſe the letter yt is touched with mannes hande is not the goſpell
/ but ye ſentence that is verely beleued in mā
                  nis hart is ye goſpell. For ſo ſeynt Ierome ſaith The goſpell that is the vertue of goddes worde is not in ye leauys of ye boke / but it is in ye roote of reaſon. Nother the goſpell (he ſaith) is in ye writing aboue of the letters / but the goſpell is in the marking of y• ſentence of ſcriptures. This ſentence approueth ſeynt Paule ſaiynge thus. The kyngdome of god is not in worde but in vertue. And Dauid ſaith. The voice of ye lorde that is his worde is in vertue. And after dauid ſaith. Thorow the worde of god / ye heuens were fourmed / & in the ſpirite of his mouth is all the vertue of them. And I pray you ſyr / vnderſtonde ye well how Dauid ſaith / that in ye ſpirite of the mouth of ye lorde is all the vertue of angells and of men?
               And the clerke ſaid to me. Thou woldeſt make

vs to fonde with the. Saye we not ye the goſpell is are writen in ye maſſe boke?
               And I ſayde. Syr though men vſe to ſaye thus / yet it is vnperfyte ſpeche. For the principall parte off a thinge is properlye the hooll thynge· For lo / mannes ſoule that may not now be ſene here / nor touched with ony ſenſible thing is properly man. And all the vertue of a tree is in the roote thereof that maye not be ſene / for do awaye the roote / and the tree is deſtroyed. And ſyr as ye ſayde to me right nowe / god and hys worde are of one authorite / and ſyr ſeynte Ierome witneſſeth that Chriſte very god and very man is hidde in the letter of his lawe: thus alſo ſyr the goſpell is hidde in the letter. For ſir as it is full likely many diuerſe men and women here in the erthe touched Chriſte and ſawe hym and knewe his bodely perſone whiche nother touched nor ſawe nor knewe goſtely his god hede: right thus ſir many men now touche and ſee / and write and rede the ſcriptures of goddis lawe / whiche nother touche / ſee nor rede effecctuallye the goſpell. For as the godhede of Chriſte that is the vertue of god is knowen by the vertue thorow belefe / ſo is the goſpell / yt is Chriſtes worde.
               And a clerke ſaid to me. Thes be full myſtie maters and vnſauery that thou ſheweſt here to vs.
               And I ſaid. Sir / if ye that ar maſters know not playnly this ſentence ye may ſore drede that

the kingdome of heuene be taken fro you / as it was fro the princes of prieſtes & fro the elders of the iewes.
               And than a clercke (as I geſſe) Malueren ſayde to me. Thou knoweſt not thyne equiuocacyons / for the kyngdome of heuene hathe diuerſe vnderſtondinges. What calleſt thou the kingdome of heuene in this ſentence that thou ſheweſt here?
               And I ſaid. Sir by good reaſon & ſentence of doctours y• realme of heuene is called here ye vnderſtonding of gods worde.
               And a clerke ſaid to me. Frome whō thinkeſt thou that this vnderſtondinge is taken awaye?
               And I ſaid. Sir by authorite of Chriſte him ſelfe the effectuall vnderſtondinge of Chriſtes worde is taken awaye from all them chefely / whiche are greate lettered men and preſume to vnderſtonde hyghe thynges / and will be holden wiſe men / and deſyre maſterſhippe and hye ſtare and dignite / but they will not conforme them to ye lyuyng & teaching of Chriſte and off his apoſtles.
               Thā the Archebiſhop ſaid. Well / well / thou wilt iudge thy ſouereyns. By god the kyng doeth not his deutie / but he ſuffer the to be condempned.
               And than a nother clerke ſaid to me. Why on friday that laſt was / counſeldeſt thou a man off my lordes / that he ſholde not ſhriue him to man but onely to god?
               
                  And with this aſkyng I was abaſſhed / ād than by and by I knewe that I was ſuttely betrayed of a man that came to me in preſone on the friday before comunynge with me in thys mater of confeſſyon / and certeyn by his wordes (I thoughte) that this man came than to me of full feruent and charitable wyll: But nowe I knowe he came to tempte me and to accuſe me (god forgyue him yf it be his will). And with all myne harte whan I hadde thoughte thus I ſaid to this clercke. Sir I pray you that ye wolde fetche this man hither / & all the wordes as nere as I can repete them whiche that I ſpake to hym on fridaye in the pryſon I will reherſe nowe here before you all and before hym.
               And (as I geſſe) the Archebiſhop ſaid thā to me. They yt are now here ſuffyſe to repete them. How ſaideſt thou to him?
               And I ſaid. Sir that man came and aſked me of diuerſe thinges / and after his▪ aſkynge I anſwered hym (as I vnderſtoode) that goode was: and as he ſhewed to me by his wordes / he was ſory of his lyuynge in courte and right heuy for his owne vicious lyuynge / and alſo for the viciouſneſſe of other men and ſpeciallye of prieſtes euyll lyuynge: and herefore he ſayde to me with a ſoroufull harte) as I geſſed) yt he purpoſed fully within ſhorte tyme for to leaue ye courte / & beſye him to knowe gods lawe / and to conforme all his lyfe thereafter. And whan he

hadde ſaid to me thes wordis & mo other / which I wolde recherſe and he wer preſent / he praied me to heare his confeſſion. And I ſaid to hym ſir / wherfore come ye to me to be cōfeſſed of me / ye wote well that the Archebiſſhop puttith and holdith me here as one vnworthy other to gyue or to take any Sacrament of holy chirche. And he ſaid to me. Brother I wote well ād ſo wote many mo other / that you and ſoche other ar wrongfully vexed / and herefore I will comon with you the more gladly. And I ſaid to hym. Certeyn I wote well that many mē of this courte & ſpecially the prieſtis of this houſholde wolde be full euyll a payde both with you & with me if they wiſte / that ye wer cōfeſſed of me And he ſaid that he cared not therfore / for he hadde full litle affeccion in them: and (as me tought) he ſpake thes wordis and many other of ſo goode will and of ſo hye deſyre for to haue knowen and done the pleſant will of god. And I ſaid than to hym as with my fore ſaid proteſtacion I ſay to you now here. Sir I counſell you for to abſente you frome all euyll company and to drawe you to them that looue ād beſy thē to knowe and to keape the preceptis of god: and than the good ſpirite of god will mooue you for to occupie beſily all your wittes in gathering to gither of all your ſynnes as ferre as ye can bethinke you / ſhamynge greatly of them and ſorowyng hartely for them / ye ſir the holy goſte will than put in your harte a goode will & a feruen

deſyre for to take and to holde a goode purpoſe to hate euer and to flie (after your connyng and power) all occaſion of ſynne / ād ſo than wyſdome ſhall come to you frome aboue / lightenyng with diuerſe beamis of grace and of heuenly deſyre all your wittes / enfourmyng you how ye ſhall truſte ſtedfaſtely in the mercie of the lorde knoulegyng to hym onely all your vicious lyuyng / praiyng to hym euer deuoutely of charitable counſell and cōtinuance / hoping without doute that yf ye cōtynew thus beſiyng you feith fully to knowe and to kepe his biddīgis that he will (for he onely may) forgyue you all your ſynnes. And this man ſaid than to me. Though god forgyue men their ſynnes / yet it behoouyth men to be aſſoyled of prieſtis and to doo the penaunce that they enioyne them. And I ſaid to hym. Sir it is all one to aſſoyle men of their ſynnes / and to forgyue men their ſynnes: Wherfor ſyns it perteinyth onely to god to forgyue ſynne / Yt ſuffiſith in this caſe to counſell men ād women for to leaue their ſynne / and to comforte thē that beſye them thus to doo for to hope ſtedfaſtely in the mercie of god. And ageynwarde / prieſtis owght to tell ſharpely to cuſtomable ſynners / that if they will not make an ende of their ſynne / but contynew in diuerſe ſynnes while yt they may ſynne / all ſoche deſerue peyn without any ēde. And herefore prieſtis ſholde euer beſy them to lyue well and holily ād to reache the people beſely and trewly the worde of god / ſhewīg

to all folke in open preaching and in preuy coū
                  ſelyng that the lorde god onely forgeuyth ſynne. And therfore thoſe prieſtis that take vpō thē to aſſoyle men of their ſynnes / blaſpheme god: ſyns that it perteinyth onely to ye lorde to aſſoyle men of all their ſynnes. For no doute A thouſande yeare after that Chriſte was man / no prieſte of Chriſte durſte take vpon hym to teache the people nother priuely nor a pertly / that they behoouyd nedis to come to be aſſoilid of them / as prieſtis now doo. But by authorite of Chriſtis worde / prieſtis boūd indured cuſtomable ſīners to euerlaſting peynes / which in no tyme of their lyuyng wolde beſy thē feithfully to know ye biddinges of god / nor to keape thē. And ageyn all they that wolde occupie all their wittes to hate ād to flie all occaſion of ſynne / dreding ouer all thing to offende god / ād loouyng for to pleaſe hym cōtinually / to thes men & women / prieſtis ſhewid how ye lorde aſſoileth thē of all their ſynnes. And thus Chriſte promyſed to conferme in heuē all ye bindīg & looſyng / yt prieſtis by authorite of his worde bynde mē in ſynne yt ar indured therin / or looſe thē out of ſynne here vpō erthe yt ar verely repētaūt. And this mā hearīg thes wordis ſaid / yt he myght well ī cōſciēce cō
                  ſent to this ſentēce But he ſaid / is it not nedeful to ye lay people yt cā not thus doo / to go ſhriue thē to prieſtis? & I ſaid yf a mā feale hīſelf ſo diſtrobled with ony ſīne yt he cā not by his owne witte auoide this ſynne without coūſell of thē yt ar herein wyſer than he In ſoche a caſe ye counſell

of a goode prieſte is full neceſſarie. And if a good prieſte faile as they doo now comonly / in ſoche a caſe ſeynt Auguſtine ſaith that a man may lefully comon and take counſell of a verteuous ſeculer man. But certeyn that man or woman is ouer laden ād to beſtely / which can not brynge their owne ſynnes into their mynde / beſiyng them nyght and day for to hate and to for ſake all their ſynnes / doyng a ſighe for them after their connyng and power. And ſir full acordingly to this ſentence vpon midlenton ſonday two yeare (as I geſſe) now agone / I harde a monke of Feuerſam / that men called Moredō preache at Cāterbury at the croſſe within Chriſte chirche Abbey ſaiyng thus of confeſſion. As thorow the ſuggeſtion of the fende without coū
                  ſell of any other body that of themſelf many mē and women can ymagine and fynde meanys & wayes inough to come to pride / to thefte / to lecherie / and to other diuerſe vyces: In contrarie wyſe this monke ſaid. Syns the lorde god is more redy to forgyue ſynne than the fende is or may be of power to mooue ony body to ſynne / than who ſo euer will ſhame and ſorow hartely for their ſynnes / knouleging them feithfully to god / amending them after their power and connyng / without counſell of ony other body than of god and hymſelf thorow the grace of god all ſoche men and women may fynde ſufficient meanys to come to goddis mercie / and ſo to be clene aſſoilid of all their ſynnes. This ſentence I

ſaid ſir to this man of yours and the ſelfe wordis as nere as I can geſſe.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid. Holy chirche approuyth not this learnyng.
               And I ſaid. Sir holy chirche of which Chriſte is hed in heuene and in erthe muſt nedys approue this ſentence. For lo hereby all men and women may / if they will / be ſufficiently tauchte to know and to kepe the commaundementis of god / and to hate and to flie centinewally all occaſion of ſynne / and to looue ād to ſeke vertues beſely / and to beleue in god ſtabely / and to truſte in his mercy ſtedfaſtly / and ſo to come to perfite charite and contynew therein perſeuerancly. And more the lorde aſkith not of ony man he renow in this lyfe And certeyn ſyns Ieſu Chriſte dyed vpon the croſſe wilfully to make men fre / men of the chirche ar to bolde and to beſy to make men thrall / byndyng them vnder the peyne of endeleſſe curſe (as they ſay) to doo many obſeruances and ordinaūcis / which nother the lyuyng nor teaching of Chriſte nor of his apoſtles approueth.
               And a clerke ſaid than to me. Thou ſhewiſt playnely here thy diſceite which thou haſte learnyd of thē that trauell to ſowe popill amōg wheate. But I coūſell the to go away clene frome this learnyng / and ſubmyt the lowly to my lorde / and thou ſhalt fynde hym yet to be gracious tothe.
               And as faſte than a nother clerke ſaid to me

How waſt thou ſo bolde at Paulis croſſe in lō
                  dō to ſtōde there harde with thi tippet boūden about thyne hedde ād to repreue in his ſermonne the woorthy clerke Alkerton drawyng away all yt thou myghtiſt / ye and ye ſame day at after none thou metyng yt woorthy doctour in Watlyng ſtrete callidſt hym ſalfe flaterer & ypocrite
               And I ſaid. Sir I thynk certeinly that there was no man nor wooman that hated verely ſynne and loouyd vertues / hearing the ſermonne of the clerke of Oxforde / and alſo Alkertons ſermonne / but they ſayd or myght iuſtely ſay / yt Alkerton reproouyd the clerke vntrewly / and ſclaundered hym wrongfully and vncharitably. For no doute if the lyuyng and teaching of Chriſte chefely and of his apoſtl̄es be trewe / no body that loouyth god ād his lawe will blame any ſentēce that the clerke than preachid there / ſyns by authorite of goddis worde ād by approued ſeyntis and doctours and by open reaſon this clerke approued all thingis clerly that he preached there.
               And a clerke of the Archebiſhops ſaid to me. His ſermonne was falſe & yt he ſhewith openly ſyns he dare not ſtāde forthe & defende his preaching that hethan preached there.
               And I ſaid. Sir I thinke that he purpoſith to ſtāde ſtedfaſtely thereby / or els he ſclaūdereth foully hym ſelf and alſo many other that haue greate truſte / that he will ſtande by the trewith of the goſpell. For I wote well his ſermonne is

written bothe in latyne and in Englyſch / and many men haue it / and they ſett great pryſe thereby. And ſir if ye wer preſent with the Archebiſſhop at lambeth whan this clerke apered and was at his anſwer before y• Archebiſſhop ye wote well that this clerke denyed not there his ſermonne / but two dayes he maynteinyd it before the Archebiſſhop and his clerkis.
               And than the Archebiſſhop or one of his clerkis ſaid / I wote not which of thē. That harlot ſhall be met with for that ſermonne. For no man but he and thou and ſoche other falſe harlotis praiſith ony ſoche preaching.
               And than the Archebiſſhop ſaid. Your curſed ſec

                  e is beſy / & it ioiethe right greatly to contrarie & to deſtroye ye priuilege & fredome of holy chirche. ¶And I ſaid. Sir I knowe no men that trauell ſo beſely as this ſecte dothe (which you repreue) to make reſte & peace in holy chirche. For pride couetouſneſſe & ſimony which diſtrooble moſte holy chirche this ſecte hatith & fliethe & trauellith beſely to mooue all other mē in lyke maner vnto meakneſſe & wilfull pouerte & charite / & fre miniſtryng of ye ſacramētis: this ſecte louyth ād vſith ād is full beſy to mooue all other folk is thus to doo. For thes vertues owe all mēbres of holy chirche to their hedde Chriſte
               Than a clerke ſaid to ye Archebiſſhop. Sir it is ferre daies ād ye haue ferre to ryde to nyght / therfore make an ende with hī / for he will none make. But ye more ſir yt ye beſy you for to drawe

hym toward you / the more contumax he is made and the ferder fro you.
               And than Malueren ſaid to me. William knele downe and praye my lorde of grace / and leaue all thy fantaſies and become a childe of holy chirche.
               And I ſaid. Sir I haue praied the Archebiſſhop ofte and yet I pray hym for the looue of Chriſte that he will leaue his indignacion that he hathe ageinſt me / and that he will ſuffer me after my connyng and power for to doo myne office of prieſthode / as I am chargid of god to doo it. For I couete nought els but to ſerue my god to his pleaſing in the ſtate yt I ſtāde in and haue taken me to.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me. Yf of good harte thou wilt ſubmyt the now here mekely to be reulid fro this tyme forthe by my counſell / obeiyng mekely and wilfully to myne ordinaunce / thou ſhalt fynde it moſte profitable and beſte to the for to doo thus. Therfore tary thou me no lenger / graunte to doo this that I haue ſaid to the now here ſhortely / or denye it vtterly.
               And I ſaid to the Archebiſſhop. Sir owe we to beleue that Ieſu Chriſte was and is very god and very man?
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid. Ye.
               And I ſaid. Sir owe we to beleue / that all Chriſtis lyuyng and his teaching is trewe in euery poynte. And he ſayd. Ye.
               And I ſaid. Sir owe we to beleue / that the

lyuyng of ye apoſtles & the teaching of Chriſte & of all the proph̄etes are true which ar writen in the bible for the helth and ſaluacion of goddes people? And he ſaid. Ye.
               And I ſaide. Sir owe all chriſten men & women after their connyng and power for to conforme all their lyuynge to the teachyng ſpecially of Chriſte / and alſo to the teaching and lyuynge of his apoſtles and of prophetes in all thinges that are pleſaunt to god and edificacion to his churche? And he ſaid. Ye.
               And I ſaid. Sir ought ye doctrine / ye bidding or ye counſell of ony body to be accepted or obeid vnto / excepte this doctrine / thes biddinges or this counſell may be graunted and affermed bi chriſtes lyuyng and his teachinge ſpecially / or by the lyuyng and teaching of his apoſtles and prophetes?
               And ye Archebiſhop ſaid to me. Other doctrine oughte not to be accepted / nor we owe not to obey to any mānes bidding or counſell / excepte we cā perceyue yt this bidding or counſell acordeth with ye bidding & teaching of chriſt & of his apoſtles and prophetes.
               And I ſaid. Sir is not all the learninge ād biddinges and counſellis of holy chirche meanes and healfull remedies to know and to with ſtond the preuy ſuggeſtions / & the aperte tēptacions of the fende: and alſo wayes and healfull remedies to ſlee pride & all other dedely ſynnes & the braūches of thē / & ſouereyn meanes to purcheſe

grace / for to withſtonde and ouercome all the fleſchly luſtes and mouynges?
               And the Archebiſhop ſaide. Ye.
               And I ſaid. Sir what ſoeuer thing ye or ony other body bid or counſell me to do / accordī
                  gly to this forſaid learning / after my connynge & power thorowe ye helpe of god I will mekely with all myne harte obey therto.
               And the Archebiſhop ſayde to me. Submitt the than now here mekely and wilfully to the ordinaunce of holy churche / which I ſhall ſhewe to the.
               And I ſaid. Sir accordingly as I haue here nowe before you reherſed I will now be redy to obeye full gladly to Chriſte the hede off all holy churche / and to the learnynge and biddynges and counſelles off euery pleaſynge membre of hym.
               Than the archebiſhop ſtriking with his hande ferſelye vpon a cupborde ſpake to me with a greate ſpyrite ſayng. By Ieſu but yf thou leaue ſoche addicions obliging the now here without ony excepcion to myne ordinaūce / or yt I go out of this place I ſhal make the as ſure as ony thefe that is in ye pryſon of Lantern. Aduyſe ye nowe what thou wilt do. And thā as if he hadde ben angered he went fro the cupborde where he ſtode to a wyndowe.
               And than Malueren and a nother clerke came nerer me / and they ſpake to me many wordes full pleſantly / & a nother while they manaſed

me / and counſelled full beſily to ſubmyt me or els they ſayde. I ſholde not eſcape poniſhing ouer meſure / for they ſaide I ſholde be degraded / curſed and burned / and ſo than dampned But now they ſaid thou maiſte eſchewe all theſe miſcheues / yf thou wilt ſubmyt the wilfully and mekely to thys worthy prelate that hath cure of they ſoule. And for the pytie of Chriſte (ſaid they) bethinke the / howe greate clerckes the biſſhop of Lincoln̄ / Herforde / & Purney / wer & yet ar / and alſo. B. that is a well vnderſtondinge man / which alſo haue forſaken and reuoked all the learnynge and opinions / that thou and ſoche other holde. Wherfore ſyns eche of them is mekell wyſer than thou arte / we counſell the for the beſte / that by the example off thes foure clerckes thou folowe them / ſubmyttynge the as they dyd.
               And one of the biſhopes clerkes ſaid thā there / that he herde Nicoll Herforde ſay / that ſyns he forſoke and reuoked all the learning and Lolardes opiniōs / he hathe had mekell greater fauour and more delyte to holde ageinſt them / thā euer he hadde to holde with them while he helde with them.
               And therfore Maluerē ſaid to me. I vnderſtonde & thou wilt take yt to a prieſt / & ſhryne the clene / forſake all ſoch opinions / & take thy penaunce of my lord here / for the holding & teaching of thē / with in ſhorte tyme thou ſhalt be greatly conforted in this doing.
               
                  And I ſayde to the clerckes that thus beſyly counſelled me to folowe theſe forſaide men. Sirs if thes men of whome ye counſell me to take example / had forſaken benefyces of temporall profyte / and of worldly worſhippe / ſo that they had abſented them and eſchewed frome all occaſyons off couetouſneſſe and of fleſchely luſtes / and had taken them to ſymple lyuynge / and wilfull pouerte / they hadde herein geuen goode example to me and to many other to haue folowed them. But now ſyne all thes foure men haue ſlaunderouſly and ſhamefully done the contrarye / conſentyng to receyue and to haue and to holde temporall benefyces / lyuynge now more worldly and more fleſchely than they did before conformyng them to the maners off this worlde: I forſake them herein / & in all their forſaid ſlaunderous doynge. For I purpoſe with the helpe of god in re remiſſion of all my ſynnes & of my foule curſed lyuyng to hate & to flye priuely & apertly to folow thes mē / teaching & counſellyng whome ſoeuer that I may for to flye & eſchewe the waye that they haue choſen to go in / whiche will lede them to the worſte ende / if in conuenient tyme they repente them not / verely forſakynge and reuokynge openly the ſlaunder that they haue put ād euery daye yet put to Chriſtes churche. For certeyn ſo open blaſphemye and ſlaunder as they haue ſpoken and done in their reuokynge ād forſakyng of the trewthe ought not / nor maye not priuely be amended

dewly. Wherfore ſirs I praye you that ye be ſye you not for to mooue me to folowe theſe men in reuokynge and forſakynge of the trewthe and ſothefaſieneſſe as they haue done and yet doo / wherein by open euydence they ſteire god to greate wrothe / and not onely ageynſt them ſelfe but alſo a geynſte all them that fauoure them or conſente to them herein / or that comeneth with them / excepte it be for their amendement. For where as thes men firſte were perſued of enemyes / now they haue obliged them by othe for to ſlaunder and perſue Chriſte in his membres Wherfor as I truſte ſtedfaſtely in the goodnes of god / the worldly couetouſneſſe / and the luſtie lyuyng / and the ſlyding fro the treuth of theſe runagates ſhall be to me and to many other men and women an example and an euidence to ſtondethe more ſtifly by the trewith of Chriſte
               For certeyn / right many men and women doo marke and abhorre the foulneſſe and cowardneſſe of theſe forſaide vntrewe men / howe that they are ouercome and ſtopped with benefyces and withdrawen fro the trewith off goddes worde / forſaking vtterly to ſuffer therfore bodely perſecucyon. For by this vnfeithfull doynge and apoſtoſie of them ſpecially that ar great lettered men / & haue knowleged openly the treuth & now other for pleaſure or diſpleaſure of tyrantes haue takē hyer & temporal wages to forſake the trewthe & to holde ageinſt it / ſlaundering ād perſewing them that couete to folowe Chriſt in

the waye of rightuouſneſſe / many men and women therfore are nowe moued. But many mo thorow ye grace of god ſhall be moued hereby for to learne ye treuth of god / & to doo thereafter and to ſtond boldely thereby.
               Than the Archebiſſhoppe ſayde to his clerkes. Beſy you no lenger aboute hym / for he and other ſoche as he is are confedered ſo to gither that they will not ſweare to be obedient / and to ſubmytte them to prelates of holy chirche. For nowe ſyns I ſtode here / his felowe ſent men worde that he will not ſweare / and that he counſelled hym that he ſholde not ſweare to me. And loſell in that thynge that in the is / thou haſte beſyed the to looſe thys yonge man / but bleſſed be god / thou ſhalt not haue thy purpoſe of hym. For he hath forſaken all thy learnynge / ſubmyttynge hym to be buxum and obedient to the ordinaunce of holy churche / and wepeth full bitterly / and curſeth the full hartely for the venemous teachynge whiche thou haſte ſhewed to hym / counſellynge hym to doo thereafter. And for thy falſe councellynge of many other and hym thou haſte greate cauſe to be righte ſory. For long tyme thou haſte beſyed the to peruerte whom ſoeuer thou mighteſt Therfore as many deathes thou arte worthy of as thou haſt geuen euell councelles. And therfore by Ieſu thou ſhalt go thyther / where Nicoll Harforde and tom Puruay were herbered And I vndertake / or thys daye eyghte dayes

thou ſhalt be righte gladde for to doo wha
                     •
                   thynge that euer I bydde the doo. And loſell I ſhall aſſaye if I can make yt there as ſoroufull (as it was tolde me) thou waſte gladde of my laſte going out of Englond. By ſeynt Thomas I ſhall tourne thy ioye into ſorowe.
               And I ſayde. Sir / there can no body preue laufully that I ioyed euer of the maner of youre goynge out of this lande. But ſir to ſaye the ſothe I was ioyfull whan ye were gone / for the biſſhop of London in whos pryſon ye lefte me / founde in me no cauſe for to holde me lenger in his pryſon / but at the requeſte of my frendes he deliuered me to them aſking of me no maner of ſubmittyng.
               Than the archebiſhoppe ſaide to me. Wherfore that I yede out of Englond is vnknowen to the: But be this thinge well knowen to the / that god (as I wote well) hath called me ageyne and broughte me into this lande for to deſtroyethe and the falſe ſecte that thou arte off / as by god I ſhall perſue you ſo naroulye / that I ſhall not leaue a ſteppe off you in thys lande.
               And I ſaid to the archebiſſhop. Sir the holy prophete Ieremy ſaid to the falſe prophete Anany. Whan the worde that is the prophecye of a prophete is knowen or fulfilled / than it ſhall be knowen that the Lorde ſent the prophete in treutthe
               And the Archebiſhoppe as if he hadde no
                     •
                  
                  
ben pleaſed with my ſaiynge turned hym away warde hyther and thyther / and ſayde. By god I ſhall ſette vpon thy ſhynnes a paire of perlis that thou ſhalt be gladde to chaunge thy voice.
               Thes & many mo wōderous & cōvicious wordes wer ſpoken to me manaſſing me & all other of the ſame ſecte for to be puniſſhed & deſtroyed vnto the vttermoſte.
               And the Archebiſhop called than to hym a clerke / & rowned with him / & that clerke wēt forthe & ſone he brought in the Conſtable of Saltwode caſtell / and ye archebiſhop rowned a good while with hym / and than the Conſtable went forthe / and than cam in diuerſe ſeculers / and they ſcorned me no euery ſyde / ād manaſſed me greatly. And ſome counſelled the Archebiſſhop to burne me by and by / and ſome other counſelled hym to drounde me in the ſee / for it is nerehande there.
               And a clerke ſtandyng be ſyde me there knelede downe to the Archebiſhoppe praiyng hym that he wolde delyuer me to hym for to ſaye matenes with hym / and he wolde vndertake that within thre dayes I ſholde not reſiſte any thynge that were commaunded me to doo of my prelate.
               And the archebiſhop ſaid / that he wold ordeine for me himſelfe.
               And than after came in ageyn ye Conſtable & ſpake priuely to ye archebiſhop.
               
                  And than the Archebiſſhop commaunded the conſtable to lede me forthe thens with hym and ſo he did. And whan we wer gone forthe thens / we wer ſent af
                     ••
                  r ageyn. And whan I came in ageyne before the Archebiſſhop / a clerke badde me knele downe and aſke grace / and ſubmit me lowly / and I ſholde fynde it for the beſte.

Sir as I haue ſaid to you diuerſe tymes to day / I will wilfully and lowly obey and ſubmit me to be ordenid euer after my connyng and power to god and to his lawe / and to euery member of holy chirche / as ferre forth as I can perceyue that thes mēbres accorde with their hedde Chriſte and will teache me / reule me / or chaſtyſe me by authorite ſpecially of goddis lawe.
               And the Archebiſſhop ſaid. I wiſte well he wolde not without ſoche addicions ſubmit hym
               And than I was rebukyd / ſcornyd and manaſyd on euery ſyde / and yet after this diuerſe perſones cried vpon me to knele downe ād ſubmit me / but I ſtoode ſtill and ſpake no worde. And than there was ſpokyn of me ād to me many greate wordis / and I ſtoode ād herde them manaſe / curſe & ſcorne me: but I ſaid nothing
               Than a while after the Archediſſhop ſaid to me. Wilt thou not ſubmit the to the ordinance of holy chirche?
               And I ſaid. Sir I will full gladly ſubmit me / as I haue ſhewid you before.

               ¶Thus endeth the examynacion of Maſter Wyllyam Thorpe. And here after foloweth hys teſtamente.
               MAthew an apoſtle of Chriſte & is goſpeler witneſſith truly in the holy goſpell the moſte holy lyuynge and the moſte holſome teaching of chriſte. He reherſith how that Chriſte likeneth them that heare his wordis and kepe them / to a wyſe man that bildeth his houſe vpon a ſtone / that is a ſtable ād a ſadde grounde. This houſe is mannis ſoule in whome Chriſte deliteth to dwell / if it be grounded that is ſtabliſſhed feithfully in his lyuyng and in his trewe teaching / adourned or made fayre with diuerſe vertues / which Chriſte vſed ād taucht without ony medlyng of ony errour / as ar chefely the condicions of charite. This forſaid ſtone is Chriſte vpon which euery feithfull ſoule muſt be bylded / ſyns vpon none other grounde than vpon Chriſtis lyuyng and his teaching no body may make eny byldyng or houſyng / where in Chriſte will come & dwell This ſentence witneſſeth ſeynt Paul to the corinthians ſhewing to them that no body may ſett ony other groūde than is ſett / yt is Chriſtis lyuyng & his teaching. And becauſe yt all men & women ſholde gyue all their beſyneſſe here in

this lyfe to bylde them vertuouſly vpon this ſure foundacion: ſeynt Paul knouleging the feruent deſyre and the goode will of the people of Epheſy wrote to them cōfortably ſayng: Now ye ar not ſtraungeris / geſtis / nor yet comelingis but ye ar the citezyns and of the houſholde of god / byldyd aboue vpon the foundament of the apoſtles and prophetis. In which foundamēt euery byldyng that is byldyd or made thorow the grace of god / it encreaſeth or growith into an holy temple▪ that is / euery body / that is groū
                  ded or bylded feithfully in the teaching and lyuyng of Chriſte is there thorow made the holy temple of god. This is the ſtable grounde and ſtedfaſte ſtone Chriſte / which is the ſure corner ſtone faſte ioynyng and holdyng myghtely to gither two wallis. For thorow Chriſte Ieſu meane or middill perſone of the trinite / the father of heuen is pituous or mercifully ioynyd and made one to gither to mankynde. And thorow dreade to offende god / ād feruent looue to pleaſe hym / men be vnſeparably made one to god and defended ſurely vnder his proteccion. Alſo this forſaid ſtone Chriſte was figured by the ſquare ſtones of which the tēple of god was made. For as a ſquare ſtone / wher ſo euer it is caſte or layde / it abydeth & lieth ſtabely: ſo Chriſte and euery feithfull mēbre of his chirche by example of hym abydeth and dwellith ſtabely in true faithe / and in all other heuenly vertues in all aduerſites that they ſuffer in this valley

of tearis. For lo / whan thes forſaid ſquare ſtones wer hewen and wroughte for to be layde in the wallis or pillers of goddis tēple none noyſe or ſtroke of the worke men was harde. Certein this ſilence in workyng of this ſtone figureth Chriſte chefely and his feithfull mēbres / which by example of hym haue ben and yet ar / & euer to the worldis ende ſhall be ſo meke and paci
                     •
                  t in euery aduerſite that no ſounde nor yet ony grudging ſhall ony tyme be perceiued in them Neuertheleſſe this chefe and moſt worſhipfull corner ſtone whiche onely is grounde of all vertues proude beggers repreuyd: but this deſpite and reprefe Chriſte ſufferid moſte mekely in his owne perſon for to gyue exāple of all mekeneſſe and pacience to all his feithfull folowers. Certeyn this worlde is now ſo full of proude beggers which ar namyd prieſtis: but the very office of workyng of prieſthode / which Chriſte approuyth trewe ād acceptith / is farre fro the multitude of prieſtis that now reigne in this worlde. For fro the hyeſt prieſte to the loweſt / all (as who ſay) ſtudie / that is they ymagine and trauell beſely / how they may pleaſe this worlde ād their fleſſch. This ſentence ād many ſoch other dependeth vpon them if it be well conſidered / other god the father of heuen hath deceiuyd all mankynde by the liuyng ſpecially & teaching of Ieſu Chriſte / & by the liuyng & teaching of his apoſtles & prophetis: or els all the popys yt haue ben / ſyns I hadde ony knowlege or diſcretion / 

with all the college of Cardinallis Archebiſhopis & biſſhopis / Monkys chanons & friers with all the contagious flocke of the comunaltie of prieſthode whych haue all my lyfe tyme ād mekell lenger reigned & yet reigne ād encreaſe dampnably fro ſynne into ſynne / haue bene ād yet be proude / obſtinate heretikes / couetous ſymoners & defoulyd aduulterers in ye miniſtrīg of the ſacramentis / & ſpecially yn miniſtryng of the ſacrament of the altare. For as their workys ſhewe whereto Chriſte biddeth vs take hede / the hyeſt prieſtis and prelatis of this prieſthode chalenge and occupie vnlefully temporall lordeſhippes. And for temporall fauour and mede they ſell and gyue benefices to vnworthy ād vnable perſones / yethes ſymoners ſell ſynne ſufferyng men & womē in euery degre ād eſtate to lye & cōtinew fro yeare to yeare in diuerſe vices ſclaūderouſly. And thus by euill exāple of hye prieſtis in the chirche / lower prieſtis vnder them or not onely ſuffered / but they ar maynteined to ſell full dere to ye people for tēporall mede all ye ſacramētis. And thus all this forſaid prieſthode is blowen ſo hye ād borne vp in pride & vayn glorie of their eſtate & dignite / & ſo blindid with worldly couetouſneſſe yt they diſdeyne to folow Chriſte in very mekeneſſe ād wilfull pouerte lyuyng holily / ād preaching goddis worde treuly frely & cōtineually / takyng their lyuelode at the fre will of ye people of their pure almoſe / where and whan they ſuffyſe not for their trewe & beſy

But as their werkys ād alſo their wordis ſhewe / boldeli & vnſhamefaſtly thes for ſaid named prieſtis & prelatis couett / & enforſe thē mightely & beſely y• all holy ſcripture were expoūdid & drawne accordingly to their maners ād to their vngroūdid vſagis & fyndyngis. For they will not (ſyns they holde it but foly & madneſſe) comforme their maners to the pure and ſymple liuyng of Chriſte and his apoſtles / nor they will not folow frely their learnyng. Wherfore all the emperours and kynges / ād all other lordis and ladies / and all the comon people in euery degre and ſtate / which haue before tyme knowen or myght haue knowen / ād alſo all they that now yet knowe or myght knowe this forſaid witneſſe of prieſthode / and wolde not nor yet will enforce them after their connyng and power to withſtonde charitably the forſaid enemyes and traitours of Chriſte ād of his chirche all thes ſtryue with Antechriſte ageinſt Ieſu And they ſhall beare the indignaciō of god almightie withouten ende / if in conuenient tyme they amende them not / and repente them verely doyng therfore dew moornyng ād ſorow af
                     •
                  er their connyng & power. For thorow preſumptuouſnes & necligence of prieſtis & prelatis (not of the chirche of Chriſte / but occupiyng their prelacy

vndewly in the chirche & alſo by flateryng and falſe couetouſnes of other diuerſe namyd prieſtis) louſengers & lounderers ar wrongfull made & named heremites / & haue leue to defraude poore & nedy creatures of their lyuelode / ād to lyue by their falſe winnyng and begging in ſlouthe and in other diuerſe vyces. And alſo of thes prelates thes cokir noſes ar ſuffered to lyue in pride & hypocreſy / & to defoull themſelf both bodely & goſtely. Alſo by the ſufferyng ād counſell of thes forſaid prelatis & of other prieſtis / ar made vayne both brotherhodis & ſuſterhodis full of pride & enuye / which ar full contrarie to the brotherhode of Chriſte / ſyns they ar cauſe of mekill diſſenſion / & they multiplie & ſuſteyne it vncharitably: for in luſty eatyng & drinkyng vnmeſurably & out of tyme they exercyſe themſelf. Alſo this vayne confederacye of brotherhodis / is permitted to be of one clothyng ād to holde to gither. And in all thes vngrounded and vnlefull doynges / prieſtis ar parteners & and greate meddelers & counſellers And ouer this viciouſnes / heremitis & pardoners / ankers and ſtraunge beggers ar licenſed & admitted of prelatis & prieſtis for to begyle the people with flateringis & leaſingis ſclaunderouſly ageinſt all goode reaſon & trewe beleue / & ſo to encreaſe diuerſe vices in themſelf & alſo among all them that accepte them or cōſente to them. And thus the viciouſnes of thes forſaid named prieſtis & prelatis haue ben long tyme / & yet is / & ſhall be

cauſe of warres both withī ye realme & without And in the ſame wiſe thes vnable prieſtes haue bene / & yet are / & ſhall be chefe cauſe of peſtilence of men / & moren of beeſtes / & of bareneſſe of the erthe / & of all other miſchefes / to the tyme ye lordes & comons able them thorow grace for to knowe & to kepe the commaundementes of god / enforſyng them than feithfully & charitably by one aſſente for to redreſſe & make one this forſaid prieſthode to the wilfull / pore / meke / & innocent lyuyng & teaching ſpecially of Chriſte & his apoſtles. Therfore all they that knowe or myght knowe the viciouſnes that reigneth now curſedly in thes prieſtes & in their learning / yf they ſuffyſe not to vndſtond this contagious viciouſnes: let them praye to the lorde hartely for the health of his chirche / abſteyning thē prudently fro thes endured enemies of Chriſte and of his people / and frome all their ſacramentes / ſyns to thē all that knowe them or maye knowe they are but fleſchly deades & falſe: as ſeynt Cipriane witneſſeth in the firſt queſtion of decrees / & in the firſte cauſe. Ca. Si quis inquit. For as this ſeynte & great doctours witneſſe there / that not onely vicious prieſtes. but alſo all they that fauoure thē or conſente to them in theire viciouſnes ſhall to gither periſſhe with them yf they amende them not dewly: as all they periſhed that cōſented to Sathan & Abijron. For no thing wer more cō
                  fuſyon to thes forſaide vicious prieſtes / than to eſchewe them prudently in all their vnlefull ſacramentes

/ while they continew in their ſynfull lyuyng ſlaunderouſly / as they haue longe tyme done and yet do. And no dody nede to be afraide (though dethe did folow by one wiſe or other) for to dye out of this worlde without takyng of ony ſacramēt of theſe forſaid chriſtes enemies / ſyns chriſte will not faile for to miniſtre him ſelfe all lefull and healfull ſacramentes and neceſſarye at all tyme / ād ſpecially at the ende / to all them that are in trewe feyth / in ſtedfaſte hope / and in perfyte charite. But yet ſome mad foolis ſaye for to eſchewe ſlaunder / they will be ſhriuē ones in the yeare and comuned of theire proper prieſtes / though they knowe them defouled with ſlaunderous vices. No doute but all thei that thus do or conſente priuely or apertly to ſoch doynge ar culpable of great ſynne / ſyns ſeynt Paul witneſſeth that not only they that do euyll are worthy of dethe & dampnacion: but alſo they that cō
                  ſente to euyll doars. Alſo (as their ſlaunderouſe workes witneſſe) thes forſaid vicious prieſtes deſpyce and caſte from them heuenly connyng that is gyuen of the holy goſte. Wherfore the lorde throweth all ſoche deſpiſers frome hym that they vſe nor do ony prieſthode to hym. No doute than all they that wittingly or wilfully take or conſente yt any other bodye ſholde take / ony ſacrament of ony ſoche named prieſte / ſynneth opēly & dāpnably ageynſt all the trinite & ar vnable to ony ſacrament of healthe. And that this forſayde ſentence is all to gither trewe / into remiſſion

of all my ſynfull lyuyng truſtinge ſtedfaſtly in the mercy of god I offer to him my ſoule. And to proue alſo this forſaid ſentence trewe with the helpe of god I purpoſe fully for to ſuffer mekely and gladly my moſte wretched body to be tormented / where god will / & of whome he will / how he will / and whan he will / & as longe as he will / & what temporall peyne he will & dethe / to the praiſing of his name & to the edificacion of his churche. And I that am moſte vnworthy & wretched cay

                  yf ſhall now thorow the ſpeciall grace of god make to him pleſaunte ſacrifice with my moſte ſynfull & vnworthy body. I beſeche hartly all folke that rede or heare this ende of my purpoſed teſtament / that thorowe the grace of god they diſpoſe verely & vertuouſly all their wittes / & able in like maner all theire membres for to vnderſtonde truely and to kepe feythfully charitably & continually all the commaundementes of god / and ſo than to pray deuoutly to all the bleſſed trinyte / that I maye haue grace with wiſdome & prudence frome aboue / to ende my lyfe here in this forſaid truethe ād for this cauſe / in true feith and ſtedfaſte hope ād in perfite charite. AMEN.

            ¶The beleue of the Lorde Cobh̄am.
            
               BE it knowen to all men that in ye yeare of oure Lorde a thouſand foure hundred and thirtene / in ye firſt yeare of the reigne of kynge Henry the fifte. The kynge gaue to the biſſhop of Canterbury leaue to correcte the lorde Cabham. And becauſe no man durſte ſomone hym perſonally / the archebiſſhoppe ſet vp a citacion on his cathedrall chirche doore on the wenniſday nexte before the natiuite of our lady in the forſaid yeare / and that citacion was taken downe by the frendes of the lorde Cobham: and after that the biſſhope ſet vp a nother on oure lady day whiche alſo was rent downe / and becauſe he came not to anſwere on the daye aſſigned in the citacion the biſhop curſed him for contumacye. And the lorde Cobham ſeyng all this malice purpoſed ageynſt hī / wrote this beleue that foloweth with his owne hande and noted it hym ſelfe: and alſo anſwered to foure poyntes put ageinſt him by the biſſhop / & he went to the king ſuppoſing to get of him good fauour and lordſhip.
            
               ¶The beleue.
               I Beleue in god the father almightye / maker of heuen and of erthe / and in Ieſu Chriſte his onely ſonne oure lorde / which was conceyued of the holy goſte / borne of the virgyn Marie / and ſuffered dethe vnder Ponce Pilate / crucifyed / dede and buryed.

He went downe to helles: the thirde daye he roſe ageyn fro dethe: he aſcended vp in to heuenis he ſitteth on the righte hande of god the father almightie: fro thence he is to come to iudge the quicke & dede. I beleue in the holy goſte: all holy church: the comunyon of ſeyntes: forgeueneſſe of ſynnes / vpriſyng of fleſche / and euerlaſtynge lyfe. Amen.
               And for to declare more playnly my ſothfaſtnes in the beleue of holy churche. I beleue ſeithfully and verely that there is but one god almightie / and in this godhede and of this godhede ben thre perſones: the father / the ſonne / and the holy goſte / and theſe thre perſones be the ſame god almightie. Forthermore I beleue that the ſeconde perſon of this moſt bleſſed trinite in moſte conuenient tyme before ordened tooke fleſche and bloode of the moſte bleſſed virgine our lady ſeynte Marie for the redempcion and ſaluacion of mankynde that was loſte before for Adams ſynne. And I beleue that Ieſu Chriſte our lorde which is bothe god and man is hedde of all holy churche / and that all tho that ben or ſhall be ſaued ben membres of this moſte holy churche / which holy churche is departed in thre partes / of the which one parte is now in heuē / that is to fay / ye ſeyntes that in this lyfe lyued accordingly with ye moſt bleſſed lawe of Chriſt & his lyuīg / deſpiſing & forſaking ye deuell & his workes / ye proſperites of this world & the foule luſte of ye fleſch. The .ij. parte is in purgatory abidīg

the mercy of god / & purging thē there of their ſinnes / of ye which thei haue bē truely confeſſed in dede or els in will to haue bē. The .iij. part of this chirch is here in erthe / ye which is called ye fyghtīg chirch / for it fighteth euery day & night agenſt ye temptaciō of ye deuell / ye proſperite of this falſe failing worlde / & the proude rebelliō of the fleſch agenſt ye ſoule. This chirch is departed by ye moſt bleſſed ordinaūce of god into thre eſtates yt is to ſaye / prieſthode / knighthode / & comōs / to euery eſtate of ye whiche god gaue charge ye one ſholde helpe a nother / & none deſtroye other. As to prieſtes / they ſholde be moſte holy & leſt worldly ād treuly lyuyng as nere as they coulde after the example of Chriſte and his apoſtles. And all their beſyneſſe ſholde be daye and nyghte in holy example of lyuynge and trewe preachinge and teaching of goddes lawe / to bothe the other partes. And alſo they ſhold be moſt meke / moſte ſeruiſable / & moſt louly in ſpirite both to god & to mā. In the .ij. parte of this chirch yt is knyghthod ben conteyned all that beare the ſwerde by lawe of office / which ſholde mainteyne goddes lawe to be preached and taucht to the people ād principally the goſpell of Chriſte / and treuly to lyue thereafter: the whiche parte ſholde rather put them ſelfe to parell of dethe / than to ſuffer any lawe or conſtitucion to be made of mā / where thorow the fredome of goddes lawe myghte be letted to be preached and tauchte to the people / or whereof any erroure or hereſye myghte

growe in the churche. For I ſuppoſe fully that there maye come none hereſye nor erroure amonge the people / but by falſe lawes / conſtitucyons / or teachynges contrarye to Chriſtes lawe / or by falſe leſynges. Alſo the ſeconde parte ſholde defendethe comon people fro tyrauntes oppreſſours and extorcioners / and maynteyn ye clergy doyng dewly their office / in preachinge / teaching / prayng / and frely miniſtring the ſacramentes of holy chirch. And if this clergie be negligent in doing this office / this ſeconde parte of the chirche ought by their office that they haue taken of god to conſtreyne the clergie in dew wyſe to do their office in the forme that god hathe ordened it to be done. The thirde parte of this fighting chirch oweth to beare good will to lordes and to prieſtes / treuly to do their bodely laboure in tilling the earth / & with their true marchandiſe doing their deuties that they owe both to knyghthode and to prieſthode / as goddes lawe lymeteth keping feithfully the cōmaundmē
                  tes of god. Moreouer I beleue all ye ſacramētes of holy chirch for to be medfull & profitable to all that ſhall be ſaued / takynge them after ye entent that god and holy chirche haue ordened. And for as mekell as I am ſclaundered falſelye of my beleue in the ſacrament of the altar / I do all Chriſten men to witte / that I beleue verely that the moſte bleſſed ſacrament of the altare is very Chriſtes body in forme of bread / ye ſame body yt was borne of ye bleſſed virgin our lady ſeynte

Mary / done on the croſſe / dede / buried / & on ye thirde day roſe frō dethe to lyfe / ye which body is now glorified in heuen Alſo I beleue that all goddis lawe is trewe / & who that lyueth contrariouſly to this bleſſed lawe / & ſo contynewith to his lyues ende & dyeth ſo brekyng the holy commaundementis of god that he ſhall be dampnyd into euerlaſting peynes. And he that will learne this moſte bleſſed lawe & lyue ther after keping thes holy commaundementis of god ād endeth in charite ſhall haue euerlaſting blyſſe. Alſo I vnderſtonde that this folowith of beleue / that our lorde Ieſu Chriſte yt is bothe god & man aſketh nomore here in erthe / but yt he obey to hym after the fourme of his lawe in trewe keping of it. And if ony prelate of the chirche aſke more obediēce than this of ony man lyuyng / he exaltith hymſelf in that aboue Chriſte / & ſo he is an open Antichriſte. Alſo thes poyntes I holde as of beleue in eſpeciall. And in generall / I beleue all that god will that I beleue / praing at the reuerence of almighty god to you my liege lorde / that this beleue myght ben examyned by the wiſeſt & treweſt clerkis of your realme / & if it he trewthe / that it myght be confermyd / & I to be holden for a trew chriſten man: & if it be falſe that it myght be dampned / & I tauchte a better beleue by goddis lawe / and I will gladly obey therto.
               This forſaid beleue the lorde Cobham wrote & tooke it with hym & offered it to the kyng for

to ſee / & the kyng wolde not receiue it / but bad hym take it to them that ſholde be his iudges. And than the lorde of Cobham offered to brynge before the kyng to purge hym of all errour ād hereſy that they wolde put ageinſt hym an hū
                  dred knyghtes & ſquteres. And alſo he offered to fighte with ony mā chriſten or hethen yt wold ſay yt he wer falſe in his beleue / except the kyng and his brethren. And after he ſaid / he wold ſubmit hym to all maner correcciō that any mā wold correcte hym after goddis law. And not withſtanding all this the kyng ſuffered hym to be ſomoned perſonally in his owne chāber. And the lorde of Cobham ſaid to the kyng / that he hadde appeled to the pope fro the Archebiſſhop / wherfore he ſaid he ought not to take him for his iudge / & ſo he hadde there his appele redy written / & ſhewid it to the kyng: & therwith / ye kynge was more angry & ſaid. He ſholde not purſue his apele / but rather he ſholde be ī warde till his appele wer admitted: ād than wolde he or not / he ſholde be his iudge. And thus nothing of all this myght be alowed / but becauſe he wolde not ſweare to ſubmit hym to the chirche & take what penaūce the Archebiſſhop wold inioyne hym / he was areſted & ſent to the towre of London to keape his day that the biſſhop aſſigned hym in the kynges chamber. And than he made the beleue afore ſaid with the anſweres to foure poyntes that now folow to be written in two partes of an endenture. And whan

he came to anſwer he gaue that one parte to the biſſhope / ād that other parte he kept to hymſelf.
            
            
               ¶The endenture of the lorde Cobham
               I Iohn̄ Olde caſtell knyght & lorde of Cobham will yt all chriſtē men were / how yt Thomas of Arundell Archebiſſhop of Cāterbury hath now leyde maliciouſly & vntreuly by his letter & his ſeale written of me in ſclaunderous wyſe yt I ſholde otherwyſe feale and teache of ye ſacramētis of holy chirche / aſſyning in ſpeciall ye ſacrament of ye altare / the ſacramēt of penaūce / & alſo in worſhipping of ymagis / & in goyng on pilgrimagis: otherwyſe than fealeth and teacheth the vniuerſall holy chirche. I take almightie god to witnes yt it hath ben & now is / & euer with the helpe of god ſhall be myne entēt & my will to beleue feithfully ād treuly in all the ſacramētis yt euer god ordened to be done in holy chirche. And more ouer for to declare me in thes poyntes a foreſaid. I beleue that ye moſte worſhipfull ſacramēt of ye altare is very Chriſtes body in fourme of breade / ye ſame body yt was borne of the bleſſed virgin our lady ſeynt Marie done on ye croſſe / dede & buried / ād the thirde day roſe fro dethe to lyfe / ye which body is now glorified in heuē Alſo as for ye ſacramēt of penaūce I beleue yt it is nedefull to eueri mā yt ſhall be ſauyd to forſake ſynne / and to doo dew penaūce for ſynne before done / with trewe cōfeſſiō / very cōtriciō / & dew ſatiſfacciō / as goddis law limeteth & teacheth / & els may he not be ſauyd / which penaunce I deſyre all men to doo

And as for ymagis I vnderſtonde that they be not of belefe but they wer ordened (ſyns beleue was geuyn of Chriſte) by ſufferaunce of the chirche for to be kalenderis to lay men to repreſente & bring to mynde the paſſion of our lorde Ieſu Chriſte / and martirdome / & good lyuyng of other ſayntes. And that who ſo it be that doeth the worſhip to deede ymages that is dewe to god / or puttith hope feyth or truſte in helpe of them / as he ſholde doo to god or hathe affecciō in one more than in a nother / he doeth in that ye greate ſynne of ydolatrie. Alſo I ſuppoſe this fully / that euery man in this erthe is a pilgreme toward bleſſe or toward peyne. And that he that knowith not nor will not knowe nor kepe ye holy commaundementis of god in his liuyng here / all be it / that he go on pilgrimage into all the worlde / and he dye ſo / he ſhall be dampned And he that knoweth the holy commaundemē
                  tis of god and kepith them to his ende he ſhall be ſauyd / though he neuer in his lyfe go on pilgrimage as men vſe now to Canterbury or to Rome or to ony other place.
               This beleue indented conteinyng the forſaid beleue with thes forſaid anſweres he tooke to ye biſſhops whan he cam to anſwer on the ſaturday next befor Michelmeſſe in the yeare aforeſayd. And what ſo euer the biſſhopes aſked him he badde them looke what his bill ſaid therto / and therby wolde he ſtande to the dethe: other / anſwer gaue he not that day / but the biſſhopes

wer not quietyd herewith. And the Archebiſſhop badde hym take auyſement till moneday next folowing to anſwer to this poynte / Yf there remained materiall brede in the ſacramēt of of the altare after the wordis of conſecracion. And in the meane tyme he perceiuyd that the vttermoſte malice was purpoſed ageinſt hī how ſo euer he anſwered: therfore he putt his lyfe in goddis hande and anſwered thus as folowith
               This is the iudgement and ſentence geuyn vpon ſir Iohn Old caſtell knyght and lorde of Cobham the moneday next before michelmeſſe day at the friers prechers in London in the yeare of our lorde a thouſand foure hundred and thirtene? the Archebiſſhop of Canterbery / the biſſhop of London / the biſſhop of wincheſter / & the biſſhop of Bangar / Maſter Iohn̄ witnā / Maſter Iohn̄ whytehede doctours of diuinite Maſter Philip Morgan / Maſter henry ware Maſter Iohn̄ kempe doctours of lawe. And ſir Robert wambnell vicare of ſeynt Laurence in the iewrie / Maſter Iohn̄ Steuenes / Maſter Iames Colenotaries / with the foure orders of friers / and many other clerkis demyng and cō
                  uicting hym for an heretike and a curſed man. The Archebiſſhop made all thes clerkys and doctours both religious and ſeculers to ſwere vpon a booke that they ſholde not for loue or fauour of the one partie / nor for any enuy or hatrede of the other partie / ſay nor witneſſe but ye truthe. And the two forſaid notaries wer ſworē
                  
alſo to write & to witneſſe ye wordis & proceſſe y• wer to be ſaid on bothe the parties / and to ſay ye ſothe / if hit otherwyſe wer.
               After this the lorde of Cobhā came / ād was broughte before them all to his examinacion & to his anſwer.
               Than the Archebiſſhop ſaid to hym. Lorde of Cobham ye ben auyſed well ynoughe of the wordis and proceſſe that wer ſaid to you vpon ſaturday laſte paſte in the chapter houſe of Paulis / the which proceſſe wer now to long to reherſe. Than I proffered to haue aſſoiled you (for ye wer acurſed) of your contumacy and diſobediē
                  ce to holy chirche.
               Than ſaid the lorde Cobham forthe with. God ſaith. Maledicā benedictionibus veſtris that is to ſay / I ſhall curſe your bleſſinges
               Than ſaid the Archebiſſhop. Sir than I peroffered to haue aſſoiled you if ye wold haue aſked it / and yet I doo the ſame.
               Than ſaid the lorde of Cobham. Nay forſo the / I treſpaſed neuer ageinſt you / and therfore will I not doo it. And with that he kneled downe on the pauement / and helde vp his handis & ſaid. I ſhryue me to god and to you all ſirs / yt in my youthe I haue ſynnyd greatly and greuouſly in lecherie and in pride and hurte many men & done many other horrible ſynnes / good lord I crie the mercie. And therwith wepingly he ſtoode vp ageyn and ſaid. Here / for the brekyng of goddis lawe and his commaundementis

ye curſed me not / But for your owne lawes and tradiciōs aboue goddis law / ād therfore it ſhall be deſtroied.
               Than the Archebiſſhop examined ye lorde of his beleue. And ye lorde of Cobhā ſaid. I beleue fully in all goddis law / & I beleue yt it is all trewe / and I beleue all that god will that I beleue.
               Than the Archebiſſhop examined hym of the ſacramente of the altare / how he beleuyd therein.
               The lorde of Cobhā ſaid. Chriſte vpon ſhere thurſday at nyght ſitting with his diſciples at ye ſupper / after yt he hadde ſupped he tooke breade / & geuyng thankis to the fader he bleſſed it and brake it / & gaue it to his diſciples ſaiyng / take & eate ye of this all / this is my body yt ſhall be betraied for you / doo you this in the remembraunce of me. This beleue I ſaid he.
               Than the Archebiſſhop aſked hym / if it wer breade after the conſecracion and the ſacramē
                  tall wordes ſaid.
               The lorde of Cobham ſaid. I beleue that the ſacrament of the altare is very Chriſtes body in fourme of breade / the ſame body ye was borne of the virgin Mary / done on the croſſe / dede and buried / and the thirde day roſe fro dethe to lyfe which body is now glorified in heuen.
               Thā ſaid one of ye doctours of law After ye ſacramētall wordes ſaid / ther remaineth no brede

but the body of Chriſte.
               Than the lorde of Cobham ſaid to one Maſter Iohn̄ whitehede. You ſaid to me in the caſtell of Cowling / that the ooſte ſacred was not Chriſtes body But I ſaid / yt was Chriſtes body / though ſeculers & friers holde eche one agenſt other in this opinion.
               Than ſaid they. We ſay all that it is goddis body. And they aſkyd hym whether it wer materiall breade after the conſecracion.
               Than ſaid the lorde I beleue that it is Chriſtes body in fourme of breade Sir beleue ye not thus?
               And the Archcbiſſhop ſaid. Ye.
               Than the doctours aſkyd hym whether it wer onely Chriſtes body after the conſecracion and no breade.
               And he ſaid to them. Yt is Chriſtes body & breade: for right as Chriſte was here in māhode / and the godhede hidde in the manhode / ſo I beleue verely / that Chriſtes fleſche and his blode is hidde there in the fourme of breade.
               Than they ſmylde eche one on other demyng hym takyn in hereſy / and ſaid / it is an hereſy.
               The Archebiſſhop aſked hym / what breade it was / and the clerkis alſo whether it wer materiall or not.
               Than the lorde ſaid / the goſpell ſpekith not of this terme materiall / ād therfore I will not / but I ſay / it is Chriſtes body and breade. For ye goſpell ſaith. Ego ſum panis viuus qui de celo

deſcendi / th̄at is to ſay. I am quicke breade / that came downe frome heuen. For as oure lorde Ieſu Chriſte is very god and very man / ſo the moſt bleſſed ſacrament of the altare is Chriſtes body and breade.
               Than thei ſaid it is an hereſy to ſay that it is brede after the conſecracion & the ſacramentall wordes ſaid / but onely Chriſtes body.
               The lorde ſaid. Seynt Paul the apoſtle was as wiſe as ye bē / & he called it breade / wher he ſaith thus. The breade yt we breake / is it not the partetaking of ye body of the lorde?
               Than they ſaide. Paule muſte be other wyſe vnderſtanded / for it is an hereſy to ſay that it is breade after the conſecracion / but onely chriſtes body / for it is ageynſt the determinacion of the chirche. Than they aſked hī whether he beleued not in the determinacion of ye churche.
               And he ſaid to thē. No forſothe / but I beleue all goddes lawe and all that god will that I beleue / but not in youre lawe nor in youre determinacion / for ye be no parte of holy churche / as openly your dedis ſhewe / but very Antichriſtes contrary to gods law. For ye haue made lawes for youre couetouſnes.
               This they ſaid was hereſy / not for to beleue in the determinacion of ye chirche.
               Than the Archebiſhop aſked him / what was holy churche.
               He ſaid. I beleue yt holy chirch is ye number of all thē that ſhall be ſaued / of whom Chriſt is

hed / of yt which chirch one parte is in heuē / an other in purgatorye & the thirde here in erthe. This parte here ſtandeth in thre degrees & eſtates / prieſtehode / knighthode / and the comunalte / as I ſayde playnly in my beleue.
               Than the arbtſhop ſaid to hī. Wote you who is of this chirche / it is doute to you who is thereof / ye ſholde not iudge.
               The lorde ſaid. Operibus credite / iuſtū iudiciū iudicate / that is to ſay. Beleue ye the workes iudge ye rightfull iugement. And alſo he ſaide to them all. Where fynde ye by gods lawe / that ye ſholde ſit thus vpon any man or ony mannis death as ye do / but Anna & Cayphas ſat & iudged Chriſte / and ſo do you.
               Thā ſaid they. Yes ſir. Chriſt iudged Iudas
               The lord of Cobham ſaid. No. Chriſt iudged not Iudas / but he iudged himſelf / & went & hā
                  ged himſelf: but Chriſte ſaide. Wo to him / as he dothe to many of you. For ſyns ye venyme was ſhed in to ye chirche / ye folowed neuer Chriſt / nor ye ſtode neuer in perfection of goddes lawe.
               Than the Archebiſhop aſked him what was that venyme.
               The lorde ſaid. The lordſhippes and poſſeſſyons. For than cried an angell / wo / wo / wo / this day is venyme ſhed into the chirch of god / for before that tyme ther wer many martirs of popis / and ſyns I cā tell of none: but ſothe it is / ſyns yt tyme one hath put downe a nother / & one hath ſlayne a nother / ād one hath curſed a nother

as the cronicles tell / alſo of moch more curſedneſſe. Alſo he ſaid. Chriſt was meke / & the pope is proude. Chriſt was pore & forgaue / ye pope is riche & a māſlear / as it is opēly proued. And thus this is ye neſte of Antichriſte / & out of this neſte cometh Antichriſtes diſciples / of whome theſe monkes & friers ben the taile.
               Thā ſaid the priour of ye frier Auſtines. Sir why ſaye ye ſo?
               And ye lorde of Cobham ſaid / for as ye bē phariſies deuided / & deuided in habite: ſo ye make diuiſīon amōge ye people. And thus thes friers & mōkes with ſoch other / be ye mēbres of ye neſte of antichriſt. And he ſaid. Chriſte ſaith. Wo be to you ſcribes & pharifies ypocrites / for ye cloſe vp ye kingdome of heuē before mē / for ſothe ye enter not your ſelf / nor ye will nat ſuffer them yt wold to enter in / & thus ye be ye diſciples of Antichriſt For ye will not ſuffer gods lawe to go thorowe nor to be taucht & preched of good prieſtes / whiche will ſpeke ageinſt your ſinnes & repreue thē / but of ſoch yt bē flaterers whiche ſuſteyne you in your ſynnes & curſednes.
               Thā ſaid ye archebiſhop. By our lady ſir / there ſhall no ſoche preache that preacheth diſſenſyon & diuiſion if god will.
               Thā ſaid ye lorde of Cobham to ye archebiſhop Chriſt ſaith / yt ther ſhall be ſo greate tribulaciō as neuer was ſyns ye begīnīg. And this ſhalbe in your dayes / & by you: for ye haue ſlayne many mē & mo ſhall hereafter / but Chriſt ſ
                     •
                  ith excepte

yt thoſe dayes were ſhortened / no fleſch ſholde be ſaued / but haſtly god will ſhort your dayes. Forthermore biſhops / prieſtes / & dyacons ben grounded in goddes lawe / but not thes other religions / as ferre as I can wete.
               Thā a doctour of lawe one maſter Ihon kempe put to hī thes foure poyntes that folowe. The faith & the determinaciō of holy chirch touching ye bleſſed ſacrament of ye altare is this / yt after ye ſacramentall wordes ben ſaid of a prieſt in his maſſe / ye materiall breade yt was before is torned into Chriſtes body / & the materiall wyne yt was before is torned in to Chriſtes very blode / & ſo there remayneth in ye ſacrament of ye altare no materiall breade nor materiall wyne / ye whiche wer there before the ſayng of ye ſacramētall wordes. Sir beleue ye not thys?
               The lorde of Cobhā ſaid. This is not my beleue. For my beleue is as I ſaide to you before / that ye worſhipfull ſacrament of ye altare is very chhriſtes body / in fourme of breade.
               Than ſaid the archebiſhoppe. Sir Ihon / ye muſt ſay otherwiſe.
               The lorde of Cobham ſaid. Nay / yf god will but that it is chriſtes body in fourme of breade / as all the comon beleue is.
               The doctour ſaid. The ſeconde is this / yt holy chirche hath determined / yt euery chriſtē man lyuyng bodely vpon erth oweth to be ſhriuē to a prieſte ordened by ye chirche / if he maye come to him. Sir what ſay ye to this?
               
                  The lorde anſwered and ſaid A ſeake man and ſore wounded hadde nede to haue a ſure leche and a trewe / knowing his cure / and therfore a man ſholde principally be ſhreuen to god / and els his confeſſion is noucht. And a mā ſholde rather go & be counſellid with a good prieſte that knowith goddis lawe and liueth thereafter than with his owne prieſte if he wer an euyl man or with ony other ſoche.
               The doctour ſaid. The thirde is this. Chriſte ordenyd ſeynt Peter apoſtle to be his vicare ī erthe / whoſe ſee is ye chirche of Rome ordenyng and graunting that the ſame power that be gaue to peter ſholde ſuccede to all Peters ſucceſſours the which we call now the popis of Rome / by whoſe power in the chirche particulerly and ſpecially ben ordenyd prelates as Archebiſſhopis / Biſſhopes / & other degrees to whome chriſten men owe to obeye after the lawe of ye chirche of Rome. This is the determinacion of the chirche.
               To this he anſwered and ſaid. Who that foloweth next Peter in liuyng is next hym in ſucceſſion / but your liuyng refuſeth poore peters liuyng ād many other popes that wer martirs in Rome that folowed peter in maner of liuyng whos condicions ye haue clene forſakyn / all the worlde may knowe it well.
               The doctour ſaid. The fourth pointe is this. Holy chirche hathe determined / that it is medefull to a chriſten man to go on pilgrimages to

holy places / and there ſpecially to worſhip holy reliques of ſeyntes / apoſtles / martirs / confeſſours and all ſeyntes approuyd by the chirche of Rome.
               To this he ſaid. Yt wer ynough to bury ſaintes fayre in the erthe / but now ſayntes that be deade ben compellid to begge for couetouſnes the which in their lyfe hated couetouſnes and begging / but I ſay to you all / and knowe it for a treuthe / that with your ſhrynes and ydoles & your feyned abſolucions and indulgencis and your tēporaltes / ye drawe to you all the richeſſe of this worlde. Why ſir ſaid one of the clerkis / will ye not worſhip ymagis?
               What worſhip ſaide the lorde.
               Thā ſaid frier Palmer. Sir ye will worſhip the croſſe of Chriſte that he died on.
               Where is it? ſaid the lorde.
               The frier ſaid. I put caſe ſir that it wer here before you.
               The lorde ſaid. This is a redy man to put to me a queſtion of a thing / that they wote neuer where it is. And yet I aſke you / what worſhip.
               A clerke ſaid. Soche worſhip as Paul ſpekith of / that is this. God forbid me to ioye but in the croſſe of our lorde Ieſu Chriſte.
               Than ſaid the lorde / and ſpred his armes abrode. This is a very croſſe.
               Than ſaid the biſſhop of London. Sir ye wote well that he died on a materiall croſſe.
               
                  Than ſaid the lorde. Our ſaluacion cam in onely by hym that died on the croſſe and by the materiall croſſe. And well I wote yt this was the croſſe that Paul ioyed on / that is / in the paſſion of our lord Ieſu Chriſte.
               The Archebiſſhop ſaid. Sir Iohn̄ ye muſte ſubmit you to the ordinaunce of the chirche.
               The lorde ſaid. I wote not wherto.
               Than the Archebiſſhop redde a bill of his iugement and conuicted hym for an heretike.
               After the reding of the bill / the lorde ſaid. Though ye iudge my body / I hope to god that he will ſaue my ſoule and he ſaid that he wold ſtande to the death by theſe thinges before ſaid. With the helpe of Ieſu. And than he ſaid to all the people. Sirs for goddis loue be well ware of thes men / for they will begile you els / and lede you blyndelinges in to hell and themſelf alſo. For Chriſte ſaith if one blynde man lede a nother / bothe fall in to the ditche And after this / thus he praied for his enemies and ſaid Lorde god I beſeche the forgyue my perſewe
                     •
                  s / if it be thy will. And than he was ledde a geyne to ye towre of London / and thus was the ende.
               WHile the lorde of Cobham was in the towre he ſent out priuely to his frendis / and they at his deſyre enfourmyd and writ this bill that folowith next / commending it to ye people / that they ſholde ceaſe ye ſclaū
                  ders & leaſynges / yt his enemies made on hym.
               
                  FOr as mekill as ſir Iohn̄ Old caſtell knyght and lorde of Cobham is vntreuly conuicted and pryſoned / and falſly reported and ſclaundered among the people by his aduerſaries / yt he ſholde other wyſe feale & ſpeke of the ſacramentis of holy chirche / ād ſpecially of the bleſſed ſacrament of the altare / than was written in his beleue which was indented & takyn to the clergie ād ſet vp in diuerſe opyn placis in the cite of London Knowen be it to all the worlde that he neuer varied in ony poynte there fro but this is playnly his beleue that all the ſacramentes of holy chirche ben profitable and medefull to all thē that ſhall be ſauyd takyng them after the entent that god and holy chirche hath ordenyd. Ferther more he beleuith that the bleſſed ſacrament of the altare is verely and treuly Chriſtes body in fourme of breade Trewth long hyd now ys dyſcloſed / Prayſed be god. Amen.
