Be poore in Spyrite.
               ¶To the ende thou maiſt beare thy poouerty more patientlie,
enter into this conſideration.
               
                  1. Haſt thou not a houſe
to hold thy head in. Our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe had not wheron to reſt
his head. Math. 8. 20.
                  
                  2. Haſt thou little
foode or rayment. Paule ſuffered hunger & cold, & yet (ſaith he) I haue learned
in whatſoeuer ſtate I am in, therwith to be cōtent. Phil. 4.
                  
                  3. Haſt thou any
thing at all. Solomon ſaith, better is a little with the feare of GOD, then
great treaſure and trouble therewith. Prou. 15. 16.
                  
                  4. Haſt thou nothing
at all. Dauid ſaith, he that ſeeketh the Lord ſhall lack no manner of
thing that is good. 
                        Pſalm. 34. 10.
                  
                  5. Haſt thou a fewe croſſes
and cares in this worlde. We muſt by many enter the kingdome of heauen.
Acts. 14. 22.
                  
                  6. Haſt thou many miſeries
& afflictions. All that wee ſuffer héere are not counted woorthy the

                  ¶Seeing pouertie and riches come of God, vſe theſe
three things in thy extremitie.
                  1. Prayer. Not to diſpayre of
Gods prouidence. For he is faithful, & wil lay no more vpon thée
thē he will make thee able to beare. 1. Cor. 10. 13.
                  
                  2. Patience. to take thy croſſe
thankfully. For it is an eaſie thing in his ſight, ſuddainlye to
make a poore man rich. Ecclus. 11. 21.
                  
                  3. Labor. to get thy liuing
if it be poſſible. For better it were to die thē beg. Ecclꝰ. 40. 28 and it is
a bleſſed thing to giue rather then receiue. Act. 20. 35.
                  
               
               
                  ¶If thou dooſt conſider what inconueniences and euils be incident,
and come oftentimes with proſperitie and riches, thou wouldeſt
be better contented with thy poore eſtate.
                  
                     Dauid ſayde in his proſperitie hée ſhould not be mooued. Pſalm. 30. 6.
