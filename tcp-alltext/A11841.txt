the wurthy Captain. M. Thomas Stutely Eſquyer and others,
towards the Land called Terra florida.
            
               IF Fortunes force procure,
               The valiant noble hart:
               In trauail, pain & daūgers great,
               In warres to haue his part.
            
            
               If loſſe of goods inſue,
               Through valiant enterpriſe:
               Or for ſlaknes, or the foreſight,
               Of diligent aduiſe.
            
            
               Yet of his wurthy praiſe,
               I can not ſpeak tomiche:
               Who ventreth bothe his goods and life,
               His Contrey to enriche.
            
            
               The worldly wiſe doo muſe,
               And alſo doo invay:
               At noble harts when that their welths,
               Doo fall vnto decay.
            
            
               As now of late I knew,
               And ſaw the euidence:
               Of one whoſe part it was to ſhew,
               The like experience.
            
            
               A noble hart in deed,
               And wurthy great renowne:
               Whoſe fortune was not to remain,
               In Cittie nor in Towne.
            
            
               A yung Eneas bolde,
               With hart and courage ſtout:
               Whoſe enterpriſe was only pight,
               Straunge things to bring about.
            
            
               And though that all men ſeemd,
               His dooings to deride:
               Yet this his fact he would not leue,
               Nor throwe it ſo a ſide.
            
            
               But ſtil he dooth procure,
               With boldned hart and minde:
               That thing whiche erſt he had aſſayd,
               By trauail now to finde.
            
            
               Into a land vnknowne,
               To win hym wurthy fame:
               As exequies and memory,
               Of his moſte noble name.
            
            
               Whiche if it fall his lot,
               With fortunes helping hand:
               He may wel make a law hing ſtock,
               Of them whiche him withſtand.
            
            
               Same terme it Stolida,
               And Sordida it name:
               And to be plain they doo it mock,
               As at a fooliſhe game.
            
            
               If reaſons ſence be cauſe,
               Of this foreſpoken talke:
               Or fayned folly be the ground,
               Why mennes tungs thus doo walke.
            
            
               Then might it ſeem to me,
               The Frenches labour loſt:
               Their careful pain and trauail eke,
               That they therein haue toſt.
            
            
               The cronicles alſo,
               Whiche only ſeem as trew:
               And writ by them that of that place,
               Before did take the vew.
            
            
               The ſpaniards eke doo ſhew,
               And verify the ſame:
               To be deſcribed as a thing,
               Deſeruing ſuche a name.
            
            
               The Portingales doo ſay,
               The crownacles be iuſt:
               And all that trauaild haue that coſte:
               The ſame confes it muſt.
            
            
               If that in times before,
               Through talkes men haue refraind:
               Whiche for the loue of trauail ſore,
               Their harts haue long been paind.
            
            
               Columbus as I re
                     •
                  d,
               The ſpace of many yeeres:
               Was counted as vnwiſe alſo,
               As in writers appeeres.
            
            
               His erneſt ſute denied,
               Yet in the finall ende:
               His wurds & deeds did ſeem at length,
               On reaſon to depend.
            
            
               The like aſſay in hand,
               He did at laſt procure:
               Whoſe life and lucky viages,
               Good fortune did aſſure.
            
            
               At thend in ſauety home,
               At lenght he did retourn:
               And quenched all their mocking harts
               Whiche erſt did ſeem to burn.
            
            
               For fire of force muſt needs,
               Declare his burning heat:
               Though for a time ī ſmothering ſmoke
               It ſeemes it ſelf to beat.
            
            
               So talk of tungs may not,
               By ſmothering through be tame:
               But burſting out at length wil turn,
               Into a firye flame.
            
            
               And then the mallice gon,
               The fire falleth down:
               And quenched quite as by this man,
               Whiche was of great renowne.
            
            
               Now Stuetley hoice thy ſail,
               Thy wiſſhed land to finde:
               And neuer doo regard vain talke,
               For wurds they are but winde.
            
            
               And in reproof of all.
               I wil not once refrain:
               With prayer for to wiſh that thou,
               Maiſt ſafely come again.
            
            
               And that ſum frute at length,
               By trauail thou maiſt finde:
               With riches for to ſatiſfy,
               Thy manly modeſt minde.
            
            Finis.
            
               ꝙ Robert Seall.
