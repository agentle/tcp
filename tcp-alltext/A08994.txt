To all ſuch as ſhall intend hereafter to enter the ſtate of Matrimonie godly, and agreeable to Lawes.
            
               FIrſt, that they contract not with ſuch perſons as be hereafter expreſſed, nor with any of like degree, againſt the law of God, and the lawes of the Realme.
            Secondly, that they make no ſecret contracts without conſent and counſaile of their Parents or elders, vnder whoſe authoritie they be: contrarie to Gods
Lawes, and mans ordinances.
            Thirdly, that they contract not a new with any other, vpon diuorſe and ſeparation made by the Iudge for a time, the lawes yet ſtanding to the contrarie.
            MAriage is Honorable among all men, and the bed vndefiled. But Whormongers and Adulterers God will iudge. 
                  Heb. 23.
            
            To auoyde Fornication, let euery Man haue his Wife; and let euery Woman haue her Husband. He that cannot conteine, let him marrie.
For it is better to marrie then to burne.1. Cor. 7.
            
            Vnto the married I commaund; not I, but the Lord: Let not the Wife depart from her Husband: But if ſhe depart, let her remaine vnmarried, or be reconciled
vnto her Husband. And let not the Husband put away his Wife. 1. Cor. 7.

               None ſhall come neare to any of the kinred of his fleſh to vncouer her ſhame: I am the Lord.

               1 IT is to be noted, that thoſe perſons which be in the direct line aſcendent
and deſcendent, cannot marry togeather, although they be neuer ſo farre
a ſunder in degree.
               2 It is alſo to be noted, that Conſanguinitie and affinitie (letting & diſſoluing
matrimonie) is contracted as wel in them, & by them which be of kindred
by the one ſide, as in and by them which be of kindred by both ſides.
               3 Item, that by the lawes, Conſanguinitie and affinitie (letting and diſſoluing
Matrimonie) is contracted as well by vnlawfull companie of man
and woman, as by lawfull mariage.
               4 Item, in contracting betwixt perſons doubtfull, which be not expreſſed
in this Ta
                     ••
                  , It is moſt ſure, firſt to conſult with men learned in the
lawes; to vnderſtand what is lawfull, what is honeſt and expedient, before
the finiſhing of their contracts.
               Item, that no Parſon, Vicar, or Curat, ſhall ſolemnize Matrimonie out
of his or their Cure, or pariſh Church or Chappell: and ſhall not ſolemnize
the ſame in priuate Houſes, nor lawleſſe or exempt Churches, vnder
the paines of the Law, forbidding the ſame. And that the Curate haue
their Certificates, when the parties dwell in diuers Pariſhes.
               Item, the 
                     ••…
                  nds of Matrimonie ought to be openly denounced to the
Church by 
                     〈◊〉
                   Miniſter, three ſeuerall Sundayes or Feaſtiuall dayes, to
the intent, that who will and can alledge any impediment, may be heard, and
that ſtay may be made till further trial, if any exception be made there againſt
it, vpon ſufficient caution.
               7 Item, who ſhall malitiouſly obiect a friuolous impediment againſt a lawful
Matrimonie, to diſturbe the ſame, is ſubiect to the paines of the Law.
               8 Item, who ſhall preſume to contract in the degrees prohibited (though he do
it ignorantly) beſides that the fruit of ſuch copulation may be iudged vnlawfull,
is alſo puniſhable at the Ordinaries diſcretion.
               9 Item, if any Miniſter ſhall conioyne any ſuch, or ſhalbe preſent at ſuch contracts
making, ought to be ſuſpended from his Miniſterie for three yeereſ:
and otherwiſe to be puniſhed according to the Lawes.
               10 Item, it is further ordeined, that no Parſon, Vicar, or Curat, do preach,
treat, or expound, of his owne voluntarie inuention, any matter of controuerſie
in the Scriptures, if he be vnder the degree of a maiſter of Art, except
he be licenſed by his Ordinarie therevnto, but onely for the inſtruction of the
people, read the Homilies already ſet foorth, and ſuch other forme of doctrine
as ſhall be hereafter by authoritie publiſhed. And ſhall not innouate or alter
any thing in the Church, or vſe any olde rite or ceremony, which be not ſet
foorth by publicke authoritie.
