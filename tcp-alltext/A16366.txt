                  The Preface of the Bishop of London to the reader.
                  WHere as in the time of the late outragious and pestiferous 
                        〈◊〉
                     , being here in thys Churche, and realme of England al godlines, & good nes, was dispised, & in maner banished, and the catholyque trade, & doctrine of the church (wyth a newe enuyouse and odyous terme) called, & named papystry, like also as deuout religion, and honest be hauiour of men, was accounted and taken for super stition, and hipocrisye. And therevpon (by sundrye wayes and wiles pernicious, and euyll doctryne, was sowen, planted and set forth, sometimes by the procedyng preachers sermons, sometymes by theyr prynted treatyse, sugred all ouer with lose lybertye, a thing in dede most delectable and pleasaunt vnto the fleshe and vnto al vnruly persones, somtimes by readyng playing, singynge, and other lyke meanes and new deuises, by reason wherof, great insolency disordre, contention, and much inconuenience daily more and more: did ensue to the greate dyshonor of God, the lamentable hurte, and destructyon, of the

subiectes, and the notable reproch, rebuke, and slaunder of the hole realme. The people wherof, by sondri wycked persones, were borne in hand that they had gotten God by the fote, and that they were brought out of tirāny darckenes, and ignoraunce into liberti lyght, and perfytte knowledge, where in very dede, they were broughte from the good to the bad. And frō goddes blessyng (as ye prouerbe is) in to a warme sonne: infected with all errour, & noughtynes, drouned in sensualytie and malyce, and armed wyth vnshamfast boldnes, presumption, and arrogantye, takyng vpon them to be guydes, instructours, and tea chers of other, where they themselues were in very dede vtterly blind, ignoraunt, & void of knowledge, only bent to destroye al good rule, and order. I haue for these causes, and other honeste consyderatyons, thought (consyderyng the cure and charge I ha
                        •
                     e of all suche as are of my Dyocesse of London) it to be mete, conuenyent, and necessary for my part, earnestly to trauayle and laboure, wyth my chapleines and frendes, bothe that errours, heresyes, and noughtye opinions may cleane be weeded, pourged, and expelled out of my dyocese (a greate helpe whervnto is geuen by dyuerse prouysions made by the Kynges and Queenes mooste excellence Maiestyes, and especyallye by that godlye proclamatyon, whyche of late was sente forthe by theyr graces, concernynge the bryngynge in of certayne heretycall and noughtye bokes) and also that a verye pure syncere, and true doctryne of the fayth, and relygion of Chryst, in al necessarye poyntes of the same, faythfullye, playnelye,

and profytable, be set furth wythin my sayd dyocesse, to the good erudition, and instructyon of all the people wythin the same. And therefore haue at thys present, for mine owne diocesse, caused this present boke with homelies there vnto adioyned, to be set furthe: that the sayde people (accordyng to the wyl and commaundement of the great king and prophet Dauid) may declyne from euyl, and do that thyng whych is good. And the order of thys booke is thys. Fyrste because wythoute fayth it is impossyble to please God, there shalbe, in the begynning, some thyng spoken of fayth, to knowe what it is, and how it is to be taken here in thys boke. Secondly because the somme and pithe of our chrysten fayth is brefely collected, and cō
                     prysed in effect, in our commen Crede, therefore the sayde Crede, to teach vs what, and howe to beleue, shalbe playnely and truly set forth, and also declared. Thyrdely, because there are. vii. Sacramentes of Chrystes catholyque churche, wherein God doeth ordynarily worke and participate vnto vs hys speciall gyftes, and graces, here in thys lyfe, therefore in the thyrde place, the sayd. vii. Sacramentes shalbe set forthe, and expounded. Fourthlye, because the. x. commaundementes are the hygh way, ordeyned by God, in whyche euery one in this life must walke, yf he wyll come vnto the blysse of heauen: therfore the sayd .x. commaundementes, shal orderly be set furth, and haue also their declaratyon. Fyftely, because we ourselues, as of our selues are vnhable to doo good, and therefore nede alwayes the assistance, grace, aid and helpe of almyghty God, without whych we ne

                     
                        〈◊〉
                      can continue in this life, nether yet do any thing acceptable in the syght of God, whereby to attayne the lyfe to come: therefore in the 
                        〈◊〉
                      place ther is a rowine for prayer, as wherby to obtayne grace and helpe at Gods handes. And that prayer is there set forth, whiche Chryste hym selfe, beynge here in this worlde, did make and geue to his disciples, that is to saye: the Pater noster, whiche conteyneth in it al thinges necessary for a christen man here in this life: and thys Pater noster hath also his exposition.
                  Sixtelye, because the Aue Maria is a prayer taken out of Scripture, and conteineth in it a blessed mat ter, and a ioyfull rehersall and magnifienge of God, in the worke of Christes incarnation, wroughte in the wombe of the blessed virgin Mary, and she therby worthelye to be honoured and worshipped, therfore the sayd Aue Maria, with the declaration ther of, is in ordre folowyng the sayd Pater noster.
                  Seuenthly, because personnes, vicars, and curates, are commaunded by the lawe, to reade and declare vnto theyr paryshyoners the. vij. deadely synnes, the viij. beatytudes, and certayne other thinges, therefore in the. vij. and, viij. places, there are set forth at length the sayd thynges, with exposition and declaration of the same. And albeit these thynges so sette forth, beyng red and declared 
                        〈◊〉
                      the people, delyberately, and playnely, may seme sufficient, and the people thereby bound of reason, to be content therewithall, as hauing all those thynges, whych in 
                        〈◊〉
                      wise are requisite and necessary for theyr soule helth. yet to thintent they shall haue no cause to murmure

or grudge, for lacke of certayne bokes in the englishe tongue for theyr instruction, or yet for lacke of preachynge vnto them, they shall in the. ix. place of thys boke, thoughe they cannot rede, haue certayne homelyes, to be on the Sondayes aud holye dayes, by theyr personnes, vicars, or curates, redde vnto them in the Englyshe 
                        〈◊〉
                     , trustynge that the people thus ordered and taught, wyll take thys my doyng in good parte, and studye as well to profyt them selues therby, as I and my chapleynes haue ben studious and carefull herein to doo them good. And the Kyng of Kynges, and Lord of Lordes, geue vs also plentyfully of his grace, that euerye one of vs, in all partes, maye do oure dueties, and that we all maye lyue in rest and quietnes, and specially in the vnytye of Christes catholique churche, and his religion, louynge and seruyng God, with all our harte in holynes and ryghteousnes, all the dayes of this our lyfe, so yt finally we may attayn to the life that neuer shal fayle, but continue for euer, which graunt vnto vs the father, the sonne, and the holye gooste, preseruing our good kyng and queene in all ioye and felicitie, longe to continue, to theyr glory and oure comfortes.
                  Amen.
               
            
            
               
                  
                  
                  ¶ Concernynge fayth, what it is, and howe it is to be considered, and taken, here in this boke.
                  
                     ACCOMPLISHINGE the promys made in my preface, for as much as fayth is the fundation & ground of all oure Christian religion. I shal now intreate, and speake thereof. And knowe you, that althoughe this worde fayth, be diuersly taken, both in prophane Aucthors, and also in Scrypture, sometymes signifying trust, sometymes truth, sometimes conscience sometymes 
                        〈◊〉
                     , sometimes credulitie, sometymes credence, sometimes promys, sometymes profe, sometymes helpe, sometymes the gyfte or grace of God, and such lyke: yet here in this boke or processe, there shall not be cheifely and principallye intreated, or spoken of euery kynd of fayth, as in eue ry way it maye be considered: but onely of two kyndes or acceptions thereof.
                  And Fyrst do you vnderstand, that fayth maye be considered by it selfe, as it is a seuerall gift of god, separate, and distincte from hope, and charitie, and beinge so considered, and taken, it signifieth and importeth a perswasion, and beleif, wrought by god in mans harte, whereby man assenteth, graunteth, and taketh for true, not onely that God is (which knowledge

is taughte, and declared, by the maruaylous worke of the creation of the world, as S. Paul saith in his epystle to the Romaynes) but also that all the wordes and sayinges of God (whych be releued and opened in the scrypture) are of most certayne trueth, and infallible veritie. And not that these thyngs one ly are to be credyted and assented vnto, but also that all thynges els (which were taught by the Apostles, and whych haue bene by a whole vnyuersall consent of the Churche of Chryste, euer sythe that tyme contynually taught, and taken alwayes for true) ought to be receaued, accepted, taken and kepte, as a true and perfecte doctryne apostolique.
                  This then is the fyrst acception of fayth, whyche man hath of God, and wherein man doth not leaue to hys owne naturall knowledge (whych is by reason) but he leauethe to the knowledge attayned by fayth: wythout whych faith, man is ignoraunte and blynde, and cannot vnderstande, accordynge as the prophete Esay affirmeth in hys. vii. Chapiter, saying: Nisi credideritis, non intelligetis. That is to saye: onlesse ye beleue, ye shal not vnderstand. This faith is the beginnyng, the entry, and the introduction vnto all Christian relygion, & Godlynes: For as S. Paule sayeth in his. xi. Chapiter of his Epystle to the 
                        〈◊〉
                     . He that cometh to God must beleue that he is, and that he is a rewarde vnto them whyche do seke to please hym.
                  And thys fayth, although it be such a begynnynge such an entrye, and such an introduction, verye necessarye for the begynnyng of all ryghtousnes, yet yf

it do procede no farther, adioynyng with it, hope and charitie, it is called in Scrypture, a deade faythe, be cause it is voyde and destitute of lyfe, aud wantethe the helpe, and efficacie of charitie. And this much for fayth as it is considered in the fyrst acception.
                  Faythe as it is considered in the seconde acception, maye not be alone, but muste nedes haue hope, and charitie, annexed and ioyned vnto it. And faythe so taken, doth signify not onely the beleif and perswa sion whych was before mencioned in the fyrst acception, and taking of fayth: but also it signifyeth a sure confydence, and hope, to attayne all whatsoeuer god hath promised for Christes sake, and it signifieth, and comprehendeth also, a hartye loue to GOD, and an obedience to his commaundementes.
                  And faythe thus considered, is a lyuely faythe, and worketh in man a ready submission of hys wyll to Goddes wyll. And this is the effectual fayth whiche worketh by charitie, and whyche (as S. Paule testifiet), vnto the Galathians) is of value & strēgthe in Chryst Iesu.
                  By this fayth, Abraham, not knowyng whyther he shoulde go, went out of his countrye, and dwelte in the lande of beheste, or promyse, as in a straunge lande, lokyng, and trustyng for a cytye, founded, and buylded by almyghty God.
                  By this fayth also, Abraham, when he was tempted, was ready to offer vp his onelye begotten sonne 
                        〈◊〉
                     , in whome he loked for the promyse, nothynge doubting, but that God who made the promise, was able to rayse hym vp agayne from deathe.
                  
                     And in thys sorte and wyse, faythe is taken, in the moost parte of the examples, which be recyted of S Paule, in the. xi, chap of hys Epistle to the Hebrwes
                  And thys faythe so consydered and taken, euerye Chrysten man doth promyse, professe, and couenaunt to kepe, when he dothe receaue the Sacramente of Baptysme.
                  And here is to be noted and considered, that all the promyses of god, made at any tyme to man, after the fall of Adam, for Christes sake, are not absolutely and puerly made, but vnder thys condytyon, that is to saye: that man should beleue in God, and with the grace of God geuen for Chryste, endeuer hym selfe to accomplyshe, and kepe the commaundementes of God: so that yf man do beleue in God, and wythe the sayde grace, do endeuer hym selfe to the best of his po wer, to kepe and accomplyshe the sayd commaundementes, man maye iustlie then chalenge the sayd pro mises, so graciously made vnto hym on goddes part: and if on the other side a man wil not beleue in God, and with the sayde grace endeuer hym self to the best of his power, to kepe and accomplysh the sayde commaundementes, then man can not iustly chalenge in any wyse the sayde promyses, or the benefyte thereof, in asmuche as he hath not fulfylled and kepte on hys parte the sayde commaundementes, whyche were parte of the promyse and conuenante, made no other wyse by God vnto man, but vnder condytion, as the Prophete Dauyd playnely declareth, in the. lxxx. and lxxxviii. Psalmes, aud Chryst in the. xix. of Mathe w. 
                        
                           〈◊◊◊〉
                        , 
                           〈◊〉
                         mandata. That is to saye: 
                        〈◊〉
                      thou

wylt enter into lyfe, kepe the commaundementes. The Churche the refore, according vnto the same, intendynge that manne shoulde alwayes haue thys in good mynde, that is to saye: that the promises of god to man, be made but vpon condycion, and that with out kepyng of the condytyon, no man is partaker of Goddes promyses, hath taughte, and ordeyned, that men before they do receaue baptysme, shall promyse and conuenaunt, to fulfyll the sayd condytion, and to forsake the Deuyll, and the worlde, and to serue only GOD. Of which promyse and specyall conuenaunte, whereby man thus byndeth himselfe to God, man is called in Latyn, infidelis, that is to saye: Faythful: And on the other syde, yf he neuer made the promise or con uenaunt, or after yt he hath made it, he doth renoūce and refuse it, then that man in that case is amonges the Chrysten people, called in Latyn, Infidelis, That is to saye: Unfaythfull, or Heathen. And because God (as before is declared) hath made promyse and conuenaunt wyth man, and is euer in hys wordes & pro myses moost true, moost iust, moost constante, and wyll (as we must moost assuredly beleue and thynke) performe and accomplyshe the same, soo farre forthe as he hath promysed in any wise, therefore God is cal led (as he is in very dede) Fidelis et verax, that is to say: Faythful and true, obseruyng and kepyng his fayth, that is to saye: hys promyse to man: requyryng that man shoulde lyke wyse kepe hys faythe and promyse towardes hym.
                  Nowe of these thynges that are before spoken, it is manyfest that fayth as it is taken in the seconde accep

is the perfecte faythe of a true chrystian man conteynynge the obedience to the hole doctryne, and religion of Chryste. And after thys sorte is faythe taken of S. Paule in his epystle to the Romaynes, and in other places of Scrypture, where it is sayde that we be iustifyed by fayth. In whych places man may not thinke that we be iustifyed by fayth, (as fayth is a seuerall vertue, seperated from hope, and charytie, from feare of God & from repentaunce) but by fayth there is ment not the late inuented and deuised faith that is to say, onely faythe, or fayth alone, but faythe with the foresayde vertues, coupled, and ioyned to gether, conteinyng as is aforesaide the obedience to the hole doctryne and religion of Chryst.
                  And here by the way is to be noted, that euerye man that doth offend God, doth not vtterlye lose his fayth therby, for both they that do synne by frailtie & soden motions (from which euen the iust men ar not holly free, and be taught therefore of Chryste to saye with other. Forgyue vs our trespaces &c) And the other also whych aduysedly fall into deadely synne (as they that do committe murder, adulterye, and other abhominations, albeit they be fallen from the liuelye and perfecte fayth, for that they are disobediente to ye doctrine and religion of Chryste whyche they dyd knowe, yet there doth remayne in them so offēdyng, the certeine and assured knowledge of God, and his doctrine, whiche is the faythe, after the fyrste sorte and acception of fayth.
                  And that these. ii. thynges (it is to wytte, knowlege and obedience) are sometime seperated and a 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                     
Chryste in the. xii. chapiter of Saint Lukes Gospell, doth playnely declare it, speakyng of a seruaunt that knoweth the wyl of his maister and doth it not. And lykewyse S. James in his epystle sayeth, that fayth may remayne wythout charitie.
                  Wherefore the truth being thus, a transgressoure of the lawe of Almyghty God, after baptysme, dothe kepe a remorse of conscience & the light of knowledg by fayth, whereby he seeth the remedyes, howe to at tayne the remyssion of synne, and by a speciall gyfte of further grace, is moued to vse the same remedyes, and soo by faythe walketh the wayes ordeyned to at tayne remyssion of synne, as in the Sacramēte of pe naunce shalbe more perfytlye hereafter declared.
                  Thus haue you harde the. ii, acceptions or takynges of fayth, & that the fayth of knowledge, may remayne in hym that hath fallen frō the perfect faith of a Chrystian man. But whether there be any specyall, particuler knowledge, whych man by fayth hath certaynely of hymselfe, whereby he maye testyfye to hymselfe that he is of the predestynates, whiche shall perseuer to the ende in their callyng, there is not spoken as yet of, nor 
                        〈◊〉
                      can by the Scryptures, or Dectoures, be proued that any such fayth can or ought to be preached, 
                        〈◊〉
                      taught.
                  Truthe it is, that in the Sacramentes 
                        〈◊〉
                      by Chryste, and vsed in his Catholique Churche, here in earth, we may constantly and assuredlye beleue the workes of god in them, and the applycation of his grace and fauour therein (to oure presente comforte) with assuraunce also, that he wyll not faile

vs yf we fall not from hym: And therfore we so contynewyng in the state of grace wyth hym, haue warrante and may beleue vndoutedly that we shalbe saued.
                  
                     BVT FORASMVCH as our frayltye, & noughtines, ought euer to be feared in vs, it is therfore expedient for vs, to lyue in contyuuall watche, and in contynuall fight with our enemyes, the deuyll, the fleshe, and the worlde, and not to 
                        〈◊〉
                      to muche of our perseueraunce and contynuaunce in the state of grace (whych on our behalfe, is vncertayne & vnstable) but dilygently and ofte to remembre the godly and wyse lesson of S. Paule in the. x. chapiter of his first epistle to the Corinthyans, where he sayeth. Qui se existimat 
                           〈◊〉
                        , Videat ne 
                           〈◊〉
                        , that is to saye: he that thynketh or iudgeth him selfe to stande, let him take hede that he fall not. For all thoughe GODDES promysses made in CHRIST be immutable, yet (as it hath bene sayde afore) he doth not make them to vs, but with conditiō So that hys promyse standyng we maye yet fayle of the effect of the promyse, hicause we kepe not our promis. And therfore yf we assuredly do recken vpō the state of our

                      (as grounded vpon Goddes promisses) and do not remember therwyth that no man shalbe

                  Here foloweth thexposition, and declaratiō of this crede.
                  
                     AS concernyng this crede, there are. v. points generally to be marked and obserued, first that al chrysten people ought and must constantly beleue mayntayne and defende al those thinges to be true, whych be comprehended in this crede, & in the other two credes, whereo
                        •
                      the one is vsed to be sayde at Masse, beyng approued and establyshed by auncient generall counsayles, and the other was made by the greate clerke & holy man Athanasius. And likewise we must also constantly beleue, mainteyne, and defende, al other thynges whych are comprehended in the whole body, and canon of the Byble.
                  Secondely, that all thinges conteyned in thys crede, or in any of the other. ii. credes, or in the whole body and canon of the sayde bible, are so necessary to be beleued for mans saluation, that whosoeuer wyll not constantlye beleue those thynges, or wyll obstynately beleue the contrarye of them, cannot (in that state remaynyng) be the true and verye members of Chryste, and his espouse the Churche, but eyther are very infideles, or heretikes, and members of the Deuyll, with whome yf they repent not, they shalbe per petually dampned.
                  Thyrdely, that al Christen people ought, & must not onely beleue, mayntayne, and defende, al ye sayde thynges as moste certayne and infallible truthes of Gods worde, neuer by any contrary opinion, or aucthoritie, to be altred, or conuelled, but also must take and interprete, all the same thynges, accordyng to ye same sence, vnderstandyng and meaning, which the Holy ghost hath geuen thereto, and whyche also the

approued Doctours of the Catholike Churche, haue receaued and agreably defended.
                  Fourthlye, that all true Chrysten people, muste vtterlye refuse, and condempne all those opynyons whych were of long tyme past condempned in ye iiii, holye Counsayles. That is to saye: in the Counsell of Nyce. Constā
                        tynople, Ephese, and Calcedonense.
                  
                  Fyftly and fynallye. That althoughe all thynges as they are nowe pertyculerlye vsed in ye catholyque Churche here in Earth, are not so distinctly, particulerly, and expreslye in all wordes, fashions, cyrcumstaunces, and poyntes, set forth, taught and expressed in Scrypture, yet the pithe, the substaunce, ye matter, the foundation & grounde, with the effecte thereof in general wordes are not onely comprehended and conteyned in Scrypture, but also by expresse wordes confyrmed by other sufficient aucthoritie. And seynge the Catholyke Churche hath soo receyued, beleued, allowed, and approued, the sayde thynges, time out of mynde, therfore it shalbe a very great presumption and an vncomely parte, anye man to controll or contempne any such thinges so receyued, beleued, allowed and approued by the sayd catholique church, and in so doyng the same is in dede not worthy to be taken or reputed for a faythfull membre or obediente chyld of the sayd Church, but for an arrogant, noughty, and very wycked person.
                  
                     
                     ¶ Here foloweth the exposition or declaration of the fyrst article of the Crede, which is.
                     
                        I beleue in God the Father almightye, maker of heauen and earth.
                     
                     FOr the better, and more playne vnderstandyng of this article, ye muste knowe, that this worde (Beleue) taken by it selfe, generallye, and symplye spoken, is to haue fayth, after the fyrste acception, or takyng of fayth, as it hath bene before already decla red, and shewed vnto you, but these wordes (I beleue in) haue a farther, and more particuler vnderstandyng, it is to wyt, to haue fayth, after the second acception, maner, or takyng of fayth. And therefore when we are cōmaunded to beleue in God, we must not onely assent, graunte, and take for true, thys one thynge, that God is (which in dede the very deuiles them selues do acknowledge and confesse) or this second, that all the wordes and sayinges of God reueled in Scrypture, are of moste certayne trouthe, and vnfallible veritie, or this third, that al thinges whyche were taught by the Apostles, and whyche haue bene by a whole vniuersall consent of the Catholyke Churche, 
                           〈◊〉
                         taught, and taken alwayes for true, ought to be receaued, and kept, as a perfect doctrine Apostolyke. But also we must haue a sure confidence and hope, to attayne whatsoeuer God hath promysed for Christes sake, and we muste also haue an hartye loue to God, with obedyence to hys commaundementes,

& then we do not onely 
                           〈◊〉
                         God but also we do beleue in God. This manner of 
                           〈◊〉
                         that is to saye: I beleue in, we ought to haue on 
                           〈◊〉
                         in God, and not in any other creature of God els, be it neuerso excellent. And therfore in this crede, ye said maner of speakyng I beleue in is vsed only in ye. iii. articles which concerne the thre persons in trinitie, that is: the Father, the Sonne, and the holy ghoste, for we do, and ought to say: I beleue in God the Father: I beleue in God the Sonne: and I beleue in God the holi gost: & we do not so saye in any thyng els, as more at large shalbe said, whan it shalbe spoken of the Catholyke Churche.
                     We muste further note, that as by thys artycle we are bounden to beleue stedfastlye that both God is, and that he is true in al his wordes and promises and as we are bounden to beleue lyke wise that god is omnypotent, and creator of heuen and earth, and that we must with this our beleif, loue god, & cleaue onely to hym with al our harte and power, continuynge, and dwellyng styl with him in loue, and obey inge vnto hys will, aswell in al our inward thoughtes and affectiōs, as also in our outward actes and dedes, so must we abhorre, and forsake all vice and noughtynes. and not wysshe or desyre of God, anye euyll or vngodly thyng. And ouer this, we must con stantly betake, and commit our selues, and all ours wholy vnto God, and fixe all oure hole hope, truste, and confidence in God, and we must quiet oure selues in him: beleuyng perfitly, and assuredly, that he

                        
                           〈◊〉
                         in 
                           〈◊〉
                         shew no lesse goodnes, loue, mercy, grace and fauoure vnto vs, then he promysed by hys word to do wyth vs, vsynge oure selues, as afore is sayde.
                     
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         we muste note, touchynge thys article, that God is a spirytuall, and an inuisible substaunce or nature, of infinite power, & eternall, withoute begynnyng or endyng, and of incomprehensible knowledge, wysedome, goodnes, iustice, and mercye. We must also note for farther declaraiton of thys article, that albeit ther be but one very true God, beside, or without whiche there is no other God, yet there are in the Godhede three distincte persones, the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy gooste: and thoughe they are thre persons, yet they ar not thre goddes, but all oue God, one nature, one substaunce, all one euerlastynge essence or beynge, and all lyke and equall in might, power wysedom, knowledge, ryghtuousnes, and in al other thynges els, belonginge to the deitie. And moreouer we must knowe & beleue, that God the Father is the fyrst person in thys Trynitie & godheadde, yea, and the Father of hys onelye begotten Sonne, whych is the second person in Trinytie, and that he the sayd Father dyd beget of hys owne substaunce the sayde seconde person, by eternall generation, that is to saye: by generation that neuer had be gynnynge.
                     And where this article conteyneth farther, that God ye father is (almyghty) it is to be noted that thys worde almyghtye, is as much to saye as that God the fathere maye do all thynges that he wyll, in heauen, and in earth, and that nothyng to him is impossible,

and that his godly power and myght, doth, excell infinitelye, and incomparablye, all powers, in Heauen, earth, and hell: Soo that all other powers whyche be in Heauen, earthe; or hell, be nothynge as of them selues, but haue all theyr myghte, force, and strength of hym, and be all subiecte vnto hys power, and cannot resyste, or let the same.
                     And here with farther is to be learned, that althoughe God be omnipotent, and of infinyte power, yet he is not the aucthor, or worker of any synne, for whensoeuer any synne is done by anye creature, the same is wrought by the malyce of the deuil, or fre wil of man, or by both, God onelye sufferyng and permyttynge the same to be done, and not by his power and worke, styrryng vp, fertheryng, or assystyng, the malyce, or the euyll thought or dede in that behalfe.
                     Fynallye, concernynge those laste wordes of thys Artycle, it is to wytte. Maker of heauen, and earth. we are taughte and instructed thereby to be leue that God the father Almyghtye dyd at the begynnyng create, fourme, and make of noughte, Heauen, and Earth, and al thynges visible, and inuisible and that he dyd gyue vnto them al theyr power, and myght, and that he so, from time to tyme, continually doth preserue, gouerne, susteine, and maynetaine, the whole worlde, and all the creatures therein, by hys onely goodnes, and hyghe prouydence, that without his continuall workyng, nothyng is or can be able in any wyse to endure.
                  
                  
                     
                     ¶ The exposition or declaration cōcerninge the seconde Article of the Crede, whyche is.
                     
                        And in Iesu Christ, his onelye sonne oure Lorde.
                     
                     IN this article. iiii. thinges ar specially to be noted Fyrst that the second person in Trinitie, is verye Iesus, the second, that he is Christ. The third, that he is an onely Sonne, and ye fourth, that he is our lord For the better vnderstandyng of which foure poyntes ye shall know that Iesus is asmuche to saye, as a (Sauiour) S. Mathewe bearynge witnes therevnto in the fyrste Chapiter of his Gospell, where the Aungell of God appearynge to Ioseph in a vision or dreame, and speakyng to him of the blessed 
                           〈◊〉
                         Marye, and of the notable byrthe that she shoulde be beutified withal, doth saye: Pariet autem filium & uocabis normen eius 
                              〈◊〉
                           , ipse enim saluum faciet populum suum a

                            corun. That is to saye: She shall bringe forth a sonne and thou shalt call the name of hym Iesus, for he shall, make his people safe, from theyr synnes. Accordyng wherevnto S. Luke in the first chapiter of his Gospel sayeth, that the Aungel of god 
                           〈◊〉

                            est ab angelo priusquam in utero conciperetur. That is to saye: And after that eyght dayes were perfited or ended, that the chylde should be circumcised, the name of hym was called Iesus, which was called or named of the Aungell before that he the saide child was conceiued in his mothers wombe.
                     Nowe forasmuche as the second person in Trinite was eternally preordeyned, and appoynted, by ye decre of the whole Trinitie to be our redemer, and Sa uiour, therefore in this seconde Article here, he is called Iesus, And as concernynge this other name Chryst, (wherewith also the sayde seconde person in Trynyte is called and named) ye shall know that Chryst is asmuche to saye as annoynted, And by cause that God hath annoynted Chryst (as the great Prophete Dauyd in his. xliiii. Psalme, doth testyfye) with the oyle of gladnes aboue his partakers or felowes, and hath both anoynted him kinge and preist therefore the sayd second person in Trinytye, is and ought to be called Christe. And where the sayde second person is called also here in thys article, an one ly sonne, ye shall for the better vnderstandyng here of know, that although almyghty God the father, be

the father of al people, by creation, and general grace yea and the father of all christen people by creation, adoption and also speciall grace, yet concernyng the godhed of our Sauiour Christe, and the eternall generation of him (wherof mention is made amonges other places. Psalme. 2. Psalme. Cvi. and Ioh. i) god the father, in that respecte is the father of Chryst, only by dyuyne nature, begettynge hym of his godly na ture, and substaunce, eternally, Chryst beyng therein very God, and of the same substaunce with God the father, and with God the holy ghoste, vnto whome he is equall in all thinges of ye Godhed. Where as cō
                        cernyng the humanitie of Chryste, God the father is greater then Chryste, accordyng to chrystes owne sai yng, testified in the. xiiii. Chapiter of S. Johns gospell, Patermaior me est. That is to saye: The father is greater then I. meaning his own humanite. And in this respecte, God ye father, is the father of Chryste by creation also adoption, and grace.
                     And where moreouer the sayd seconde person is called here in this Article (Our Lorde) as in dede he is, ye shall nothing there at maruayle at al, conside ryng that by the sayd decree of the whole Trynytye, it was also eternally preordeyned, and appoynted, that the sayd seconde person, shoulde be oure Lorde, redemynge and bryngynge vs frome the thraldome of the Deuyll, and synne, vnto his kyngdome, Lordshype, and gouernaunce worthely therefore to be called a kyng, a pryest, and a Lorde, as hauynge done, and fulfylled, for all mankynde, the verye offyce of a

preist, of a kynge and of a Lorde.
                     Of a preiste for that he offered vnto Almyghtye God, a sacrifice, euen hys verye bodye and Bloude, which he beyng a preist after the ordre of Melchisedech, dyd at hys maundye (which was the nyght before he suffred death) offer, vnder the visible fourmes of breade and wyne, institutynge there, the Sacrament of his Body and Bloud (commonly called the Sacramente of the Aultare) and commaundynge his bodye and bloude, in the sayde Sacramente, to be offered vnto the worldes ende, fulfyllyng thereby the sayinge of God the father, spoken to Chryste the sonne. Tues Sacerdos in et ernum secundum ordinem Melchisedech. psal 106. That is to saye: Thou art a preist for euer af ter the order of Melchisedech. And Chryste dyd also fulfyll the offyce of a preist, in that he vpon good Fryday (which was the day next folowing) did offer the same Bodye and bloude vpon the Crosse, in the visible fourmes of fleshe and Bloude, sufferynge hys naturall body there to be slayne, and his bloude

And as for the offyce of a kynge and Lord, that he dyd fulfyll, & accomplyshe, in that he most myghtely conquered, ouercame, and vtterly oppressed his enemyes, & hath spoyled them of the

                        , and gouernour, and therefore in this Article, we call hym also: (Our Lorde.)
                     Fynallye there is to be considered in this matter, that althoughe this worde DOMINVS, dyuerse tymes is translated into oure Englyshe Tounge, (The Lorde) (which the place and circumstaūce of Scripture manye tymes so requyreth, and maye well beare) yet amongest vs Christen men, in our cō men speach, when we speake of Chryste, and do call hym Lorde, it is mooste mete, and conueniente, that we call hym: (Our Lorde) to

                        , and admonyshe vs that we be his peculier people, redemed by hym, and delyuered from the dominion, and the captiuitie of the deuyll, and be made his owne proper, & obedient seruauntes. After whiche forte the Heithen people (because of their infidelytie) be nether his sernauntes, nor partakers of his benefites, and therefore cannot saye and call him (as Chrysten men doe) (Our Lorde) And (the thing thus being, & so great pythe, effecte and comforte, consystynge in this word (Our) what an iniury do these newe fangled wyttes, who for a singularitie, or for a glorious badge of a protestaunt, do in all their talke (speaking of Christ our Lorde) vse this peculier fashion of speakyng, the Lorde, the Lorde, the Lorde?

                        Which was conceaued by the holy Ghost borne of the Uyrgyn Marye.
                     
                     IN this article two thynges are specially to be cōsidered, the first is, that Chryste was conceaued by the holye Ghoste. And the seconde is: that Chryste was borne of the Uyrgyn Marye. And concernyng the fyrste, ye shal learne that when we say, that christ was conceyued by the holy Ghost, we geue not ther in suche grosse and 
                           〈◊〉
                         vnreuerente vnderstandyng as though the holy Ghoste dyd therein worke as man do the with woman in carnall generatyon, (which God forbyd we shoulde conceyue or thynke) for his holye worke of the incarnation of Chryste, was not wroughte by the sede of man, but by the ver tue and power of the holye goste, in the sayde mooste blessed virgyn, without any motion of any concupiscence, or spot of synne, and was accomplyshed wyth oute any violation, or detriment, of the virginitye of that blessed vyrgyn S Marye, who both in the conception, and also in the byrth & natiuitie of her chyld our sauiour Iesus Chryste: yea and euer after, dyd retayne styll her pure and immaculate virginitie, as clere, and without blotte, as she was at the tyme yt she was fyrst borne. But when we do say that chryst was conceaued by the holy Ghost, we doo consyder therin as Scripture doth. That Mense sexto meaning of that sixt moneth that S. Elizabeth, S. Ihon Baptistes

                            & quod nascetur ex te sanctum, uocabitur filius dei Lucae primo That is to saye: In the syxt moneth the Aungell Gabriell is sent from God, into the citie of Galilee to whom the name was Nazareth, to a Uyrgin despoused vnto a man, whose name was Ioseph, of the house of Dauid, and the name of the virgin was Marye, and the Aungell entringe in sayd to her: All hayle, full of grace, the Lorde is with thee, blessed art thou among women. Which wor des when she had harde, she was troubled in his sayinge, and thoughte what maner salutation thys was. And the Aungell said vnto her. Feare not Mary, for thou hast founde grace with God: Beholde, thou shalte conceaue in thy Wombe, and thou shalte brynge forth a Sonne, and thou shalte call the name

of him Iesus, he shalbe greate, and shalbe called the Sonne of the hyghest, and the Lorde God shall geue to him the seate of Dauid his Father, and he shall reigne in the house of Iacob for euer, and no ende shalbe of his Kyngdome. And Marye sayde vnto the Aungell, Howe shall this be, for I knowe not a man? And the aungell aunswerynge, sayde to her The holye Ghost shall come from aboue into the, and the power of the most hyghe shall ouershadowe the, and therefore, euen that holy one which shal be borne of the, shalbe called the Sonne of God. Luke the fyrst. Accordyng whervnto, the Aungel of our Lord (as S. Mathew testyfyeth in hys Gospell. Math, 1) saith: Cum esset despō
                           sata mater IESV Maria Ioseph, ante quam conuenirent, inuenta est in utero habens de spiritu sancto. That is to say. When Marye the mother of Iesus was despoused to Ioseph, and before they came to dwell together, she was founde hauyng in her wombe of the holy Goost. And immediatelye it foloweth in the same place. Ioseph autem uir eius cum esset iustus & nollet eam traducere, uoluit occulte dimittere eam. Haec autem eo cogitante: Ecce Angelus Domini apparuit in somnes Ioseph, dicens: Ioseph fili Dauid, noli timere accipere Mariam coniugem tuam, quod enim in ea natum est, de spiritu sancto est. That is to saye: And Ioseph the husbande of her, when he was a iust man, and would not

sclaunder her, he purposed secretlye to leaue her. And he thus thinking: Beholde the aungell of the Lorde appeared to Joseph in a vision or dreame, saying, O Joseph the Sonne of Dauid, feare thou not to take Marye thy wyfe, for that which is borne in her, is of the holy Goost. So that the second person in Trinitie whych is the Sonne of God, by eternall generatiō, dyd, in the wombe of the blessed vyrgyn Mary, by ye vertue and workyng of the holy Ghoost, take vpon hym, of her verye fleshe, the nature and substaunce of man, and beyng conceyued by the holy Ghoste, was borne of her body, and dyd vnite, and conioyne together the same nature of man (so taking of ye substaūce of the sayd most blessed virgin) with hys Godheade in one person, with suche an indissoluble and inseperable knotte, and bonde, that he (beynge one person Jesus Chryste) was, is, and euer shalbe, in the same person, very perfecte God, and very perfect man.
                     Nowe concernynge the seconde thynge, whyche is consydered in this Article, that is to saye: that Christ was borne of the virgin Mary. Albeit in a great parte, it is proued already by such thynges as before haue ben rehearsed, yet for the more full declaration and exposition thereof, hauynge spoken of Christes cōception by the holy gost, ye shal now here how he was borne of the virgin Marye. For knowledge whereof ye shall vnderstande, that when the tyme was come, in the whiche it was before ordeyned,

and appoynted, by the decree of the whole Trynitie, that mankynde shoulde be redemed, and saued, then the Sonne of God, the seconde person in trynytie, beynge verye God, did discende from Heauen, into this worlde, to take vpon hym the verye nature, habite, and fourme of man, whiche he dyd of the verye fleshe and substaunce, of the blessed Uyrgyn Marye, and in the same nature dyd also suffer hys gloryous passion, for the redemption, & saluation of mankynd. For after the fall of Adam, and before the commynge of Chryste, (man beynge soo blynded, and drowned in sinne, that the true knowledge of God, was euerywhere in the world forgotten, and his lawes broken, not onelye by the Gentyles in all other natyons, but also by the Jewes, the chosen people of God to whō God by hys seruaunt Moyses, had geuen hys lawes, whereby they myght knowe howe to auoyde synne, and howe to please hym) almyghtye God hauynge from tyme to tyme, sente vnto his people hys aduertisementes, and admonitions by his prophetes, inspyred with his holy spyryte, both to admonyshe men of theyr sinnes, and also to teach them how they should truely vnderstande, and obserue the sayd lawes, geuen by hys seruaunt Moyses, dyd fynally after those lawes, aduertysementes, and admonitions, lytle regarded of the sayde people, send, of his infynyte goodnes, and inestimable mercy and loue, borne to mankynde, his onely begotten Sonne into thys worlde, (by whome in the beginning he had created ye world and all creatures in it) to take vpon hym mans nature, and to redeme man, who by disobedience, had

cast hym selfe into perdition. And for testimony here of, there are amonge other prophecies in Scripture expressed, the prophecy of 
                           〈◊〉
                         the. vii. And the prophecye of Ezechtel, the. xliiij. Chapyter. And ther are the testimonies of the Gospell (amongeste other) Math. i. and. ii. and Luk. i. and. ii: and so forth, by the whych appeareth clearely, that this thirde article of the crede is fully true, and approued by Scrypture.
                     And yf any man here for curiositie wold demaūd why Chryste entendynge to be borne of a Uyrgyn, woulde haue her yet despoused, and betrouthed he maye herein satisfye hym selfe, readyng the commen taryes of S. Hierome, vpon the fyrst chapter of S. Mathew, wher he sayth thus. Quare non de simplici uirgine sed de desponsata concipitur. Primum ut per generationem oseph, origo Marie monstraretur. Secundo ne lapidaretur a Iudeis, ut adultera. Tertio ut in Aegiptum fugiens haberet solatium. Martir Ignatius, etlam quartam addidit causam cur a desponsata cōceptus sit. Vt partus (inquiens) eius ce laretur Diabola, dum eum put at non de uirgine, sed de uxore generatum. That is to saye: Wherefore is he (meaning Christ) conceaued of a vyrgyn betrouthed or despou sed, and not of a virgyn vnbetrouthed? The fyrst reason is, that by the generatiō or genealogi of Joseph, the original of Mary might be shewed. Secondly that she shoulde not be stoned by the Jewes as an aduouterous person. Thyrdely, that fleinge into Egypte, she myght haue helpe or comforte. And the mar tir Ignatius hath added also a fourth cause,

why Chryst was conceyued of a person despoused, to thintente (saieth he) that Christes byrth myght be hyd from the deuyll, whiles he thinketh Chryst to be gotten not of a v yr gyn, but of a maryed wyfe. Thus sayth Saynt Jerome, in the place before rehearsed. And S. Augu styne very handsomely and in fewe wordes, in a cer tayne sermon made vpon Wytsonday, concernynge the expositiō of the Crede, saieth as foloweth. Natus est ex uirgine, ut nos nasceremur execclesiae uirginis utero, That is to saye. Chryste is borne of a Uyrgin, that we myght be borne of the wombe of the church beyng a vyrgyn.

                        Suffered vnder Ponce Pilate, was crucyfied deade, buried, and descended into hell.
                     
                     IN this forth article. vi. thynges are to be consydered. Fyrst, that Chryst our Sauioure Suffred. Second that he Suffred vnder Ponce Pilace Thyrd, that he Was crucifyed. Fourthe, that he Dyed Fyfte that he was Buryed. Syxte, that he Descended into hell. Concernynge the fyrste, we must vnderstand that Chryst very God, and very man, after he was cōceyued, and borne of his bles

sed Mother, dydde contynue heare in this world vntyl he came vnto the, xxxiii, yeare of his age, and that in all this tyme of hys lyfe, he suffered and endured for our sakes & our welth, and also for our examples, much bodely affliction, much labour, much trauayle, much hunger, thrist, and pouertie, much iniurye, and ignominie, and many such other miseries, and infyrmities, as all mortall men are subiecte vnto (synne & ignoraunce onely excepted) and so passed ouer all the whole course of his lyfe, euen from his natiuitie, vntil hys death, in such perfecte obedience vnto the lawes of god and man, accordyng to the wyll of hys father, and in such perfecte innocency of liuing, that no fault offence, or transgression, coulde iustly and truly be lai ed agaynst hym. And yet the blynde, ignoraunte, and obstynate Jewes, full of enuye, and malyce (as the verye members of the Deuyll, by whome they were prouoked and induced therevnto) laboured continuallye, by al meane and crafte they coulde, to destroye hym, and at length, conspyrynge together, they toke hym, serchynge and procuryng false witnes to accuse hym and after they had bette hym, and spytte in hys face, and vsed all the vylanye they could agaynst him they bounde hym and brought hym to iudgement, of all whych thynges ye shall fynde testymony in scrypture, redyng S. Mathew S. Marke, S, Luke, S. Jhon, in thys behalfe, And thus muche for the fyrste poynte.
                     For the seconde poynte ye shall vnderstande, that our Sauyour Chryst hauyng suffered dyuerse waies as before is declared, yet, concernynge that notable &

Enangelistes wholy, and S. Luke partely in the actes, do playnely testify and declare. ¶ And as concernynge the. iij. poynt in thys article (whych is of the crucifieng of Chryst, a thyng which was pronounced in the condempnaty on and iudgement of Pylate) you shal vnderstand that this kynd of death, was euer amongest the Jewes, most abhorred and detested, as accompted and taken for the most cursed and shamefull of other. And (the con demnation & iudgement thus geuen & past) the souldiers of the garyson dyd take Chryst, and dyd nayle hym throughe the handes and fete vnto the Crosse: And also dyd hange with hym vpon. ij. other crosses,

two theues, on a certayne hyll called Caluerye, and this to be true is testified by the sayd Euangelystes. And that Chryst dyd dye (which is the. iiii. point in thys article) it is euident also by the sayde Euangelist, for S Mathew in the. xxvii of his Gospell, speaking of this matter sayth.

                     Moreouer concerning the burieng of our blessed Sauiour Christ, (whych is the fyfte poynte in thys article) ye shall know that the Euangeliste S. Mathewe in the xxvii. of his gospell. S. Marke in the xv. chapyter, S. Luke in the xxiii, and S.

                     And fynally concernynge the discense or goynge downe of Chryst into hell (whiche is the last poynte of this article) ye shall knowe that thoughe to some

men vpon some theyr vayne and folyshe groundes, ymaginations and deuyses, it maye seme an absurdi tie, and a thyng vnsemely, that Christ, being vertue it selfe, and of all perfection and power, shoulde descende into hell, which is a place of wycked persons, and of punishmente for them, and a place finally, frō whence there is no regresse, nor yet redemptyon in, as who sayth, yf Chryst descended into hell, he shulde both there suffer punyshment, and also not retourne from thence, nor redeme there, yet if these men wold consyder, how diuersely in scripture hel is taken, and withall woulde consyder the wyl and omnipotency of Chryst, who is God and man, and who can do all thynges, in heauen, earth, and hel, that pleaseth him to doo (nothynge to hym beynge impossible) and fynallye woulde consyder withall, what the catholike Churche euer from the begynnyng, hath in thys behalfe beleued and taughte, takynge her beleyfe, of Chryst, and his doctryne, generally, and specially set forth in scrypture, this thing shoulde not appeare to them so straunge, or so incredible, as percase it doth.

                     Nowe the processe of the lyfe of our blessed sauyoure Iesu Chryste, thus declared, with his passyon, death, buriall, and descence to hell, it is specially to be noted, and to be beleued for a certaine truth, that our sauiour, in all the tyme of his moost bytter, and greuous passion, and in sufferyng his most payneful and cruell death, not onely dyd, most pacyently without resistence, and lyke an innocent lambe, endure and su stayne for oure redemption, all the paynes, and iniuries, and all the opprobries and ignominies, whych were done to hym: but also that he dyd wyllynglye

This Jesus hath God raysed vppe agayne wherof we all are wytnesses. Secondlye, actuum. iii. S. Peter there hath these wordes. Quem deus 
                              〈◊〉
                            a mortuis cuius nos testes sumus. That is to say, Chryst whome God hathe raysed from the deade of the whych we be wytnesses.
                     Thyrdely actuum. iiii. S. Peter there hath bothe these wordes, Quem deus suscitauit a mortuis (beynge Englyshed as before) as also these wordes. Et Virtute magna reddebant Apostoli testimoniū resurrectionis 
                              〈◊〉
                            Christo domini nostri. That is to saye, The Apostles with great power dyd gyue wytnes of the resurrection, of Jesu Chryst our Lorde.
                     Fourthly, actuum. v. S, Peter and the Apostles haue these wordes: Deus patrum nostrorum suscitauit Iesum 
                              〈◊〉
                            uos interemistis, suspendentis in ligno. That is to say, The God of our fathers hath raysed vppe Je sus, whome ye (the Jewes) dyd kyll, hangyng him vpon the tree.
                     Fyftelye Actuum. xvii. S Paule preachynge in the Synagoge of the Jewes at Tessalonyca, hathe these wordes. Quia oportuit Christum pati, et resurgere a mortuis. That is to say: That Chryst muste nedes haue dyed, and to ryse agayne from the deade.
                     Syxtely S. Paule in vys fyrst Epystle to the 
                           〈◊〉
                         rinthyans, & in the. xv. Chapter therof hath amōgest other these wordes. Si Autem Christus non resurrexit, inanis est predicatio nostra, inanis est & 
                              〈◊〉
                            vestra. &c. That is to saye: If Chryst hath not rysen agayne, then is our

preachyng vayne, and youre faythe is also in vayne. &c. And hereof also he speakethe, Ad Romanos. fourthe, et. ii. ad Timotheum. ii. and in manye other places. But what nede is it to heape any mo testimo nyes hereof, seyng all the Euangelistes doo clerelye testifye the matter, Mathewe the. xxviii. Marke the xvi. Luke the. xxiiii. and Jhon the. xx. By thys then it appeareth howe that our Sauyour Jesus Chryst after he had conquered and spoyled the Deuyll and hell, he retourned agayne from thense, lyke a mooste myghty Kynge and Conqueroure, in tryumphe and glorye and so reassumed and toke agayne hys blessed naturall Body, the third day after hys sayd deathe. And so doyng rose out of the Sepulture in his natu rall and parfect manhode. That is to say in his soule and in the selfe same body, whych was borne of the Uyrgyn Mary, and dyd hange vpon the Crosse. After whyche resurrection he was conuersaunte in the worlde, by the space of forty dayes, and dyd eate and drynke with hys Apostles, and his disciples and prea ched vnto them, and aucthorised them to goo fourthe into the worlde, to manifest and declare, that he was the very Chryst the very Messias, and the very God and man, whych was promised in scrypture to come to saue and to redeme al those, that beleuing in hym, ordered themselues in obeying and folowynge hys preceptes and commaundementes accordyngly. In thys artycle of Resurrectiō, it is to be noted, that there is nothyng that can in all aduersirye & trouble be more ioyefull and comfortable vnto vs, than the 
                           〈◊〉
                         of this artycle. That Chryste rose agayne from

corporall death to lyfe, and that we shall also do the same. The fayth and belefe of this (if we continue in lyuinge well) is our vyctorye and tryumph ouer the Deuyll, hell and death, and a specyall remedy, to put away the horroure and feare of them. Forasmuch as hereby we be assured that as death coulde not holde Chryste, euen so it cannot holde vs, whiche are by a chrysten fayth, the very members & body of Chryst, but that we shall ryse from deathe, and lyue agayne in glorye with hym euerlastynglye, yf we order and conforme our wyll in thys worlde to hys preceptes. And the onely hope here of, shoulde make vs not to feare the aduersities in this world, bicause we (
                           〈◊〉
                         as afore) be assured to haue a better and more gloryouse lyfe after this, as S. Paule writeth to the Corynthyans the. xv. sayenge: If we chrysten men had no hope of other lyfe, than thys that is present, than were we the most miserable, of all men. But nowe Chryste is rysen agayne from deathe. Whereby is declared that there is a lyfe after thys lyfe which all Chrysten men hope to come vnto. Accordyng where unto saynt Augustyne sayth. All the hope of our fayth stādeth in thys poynt that we shall ryse agayne. This made the faythfull and good men (of whome S. Paule the. xi. to the He brues speaketh) to refuse to be preserued from bodyly deathe, bycause they looked assuredly for a better resurrection. Whych Resurrectyon as it was by many and sondrye apparytions, and other infallyble argumentes declared and prouede vnto the Appostles, so

they being besydes other names perteynyng to their offyce specially called the witnesses of Christes resur rection, dyd in all places, and at all tymes, open and inculcate the same as a special, and a cheife artycle of Chrystes doctryne, wherin shoulde depend, and rest the greate comfort and solace of all trewe and fayth full beleuers in Chryste.
                     Fynallye, by this article is not onely confirmed vnto vs howe the naturall bodye of man, shall after the corporall death and departyng

                     IN thys. vi, article, ii thinges are to be considered ye fyrst is that Christ ascended into heauen, the second that he sitteth on the right hand of god the father almighty. Concernyng the fyrst ye shal note, that as we by dayly experience do see, when an embassadoure is sente from some greate prynce, to ac cheue any greate affayre or busynes, as for example, to conclude and make a peace, or any other such lyke

                         retourne agayne to God hys father, hauyng ouercome the olde enemy, by humilitie, pacience, and obedience Of whom, and hys sayd embassade, the greate kyng and Prophet Dauyd in hys. xviii. Psalme thus doth saye: Exultauit ad Gigas, ad currendam viam That is to saye: He (meanyng Chryst) hath reioysed or benne glade as a gyaunt to runne his course, or way. And immediately in the same Psalme the sayd Prophet doth farther saye: A summo coeloegressio cius & occursus cius, us

                     Beyng then conuenient (as is aforesayd) that Chryst should ascend into heauen (as also by this artycle it appeareth he did) wel it shalbe to declare how and in what forte that ascension was. For knowlege whereof you shal vnderstand, that our sauiour christ, after his resurrection and before he dyd ascende into heauen, dyd eate with his Disciples, aswell to shewe therein a very sygne and token of harty loue (whiche frendes departyng from frendes, are accustomed to do) as also for to declare vnto them, the veritie of hys fleshe after his resurrection (which was a thing then very necessarye to be done, aswell for that he woulde not afterwarde gyue vnto them any further sygne or token of his resurrection, as also for that some of the Disciples, not withstandyng that they had sene and felte hym, woulde not yet beleue that he was so rysen And therefore. s. Gregory in an Homelye made herevpon sayth: Christus comedit & ascendit, ut per effectum commestio 
                              〈◊◊◊〉
                            carnis That is to say. Chryste dydde

eate and ascende, that by the effecte of eating, the veritie of his fleshe myght be manyfested. And moreouer after the sayde resurrectiō, and before thys sayd ascension, our sauiour Chryste dyd rebuke and blame his disciples of theyr incredulitie, and 
                           〈◊〉
                         nes, or hardenes of beleuyng the sayde resurrectyon, whiche thinge he dydde, as 
                           〈◊〉
                         Gregorye sayeth: Vt

                            que recidens diceret, in corde audientium arctius impressa remanerent. That is to saye: To thintent that the wor des which he departinge would say, myghte remayne in the hart of ye hearers more depely imprynted. Besides this our sauiour Christ hauing opened theyr wytte or sense to vnderstand the scryptures, and hauinge inioyned vnto them the offyce of preachynge the Gospell throughoute the hole worlde to all creatures, he went fourth wyth them into Bethany vnto mount Olyuete, and lyfting vp his handes he dyd blesse them (whiche blessing was well fygured by the Patriarche Iacob, who when he shold dye, and leaue this worlde, did blesse hys chyldre, as appeareth Genelis. xlix. And likewise was it fygured by Moyses who before his death dyd blesse the chyldren of Israell, as appeareth. Deute. xxxiii) And thys beynge dooue, Chryste in the 
                           〈◊〉
                         syghte was lyfted vp and (a cloude takyng or receyuing him from their eyes) he was caried vp into heauen: ascendynge as the Psalmist in his. lxvii, Psalm, doth saye. Super 
                              〈◊◊〉
                            ad orientem. That is to say: Aboue heauens, vnto the Easte. And the sayd Difciples adorynge

hym, dyd retourne vnto Ierusalem. These thynges beforesaid are speciallye testified by S. Marke in the xvi. Chapyter. Luke in the. xxiiii. Iohn in the. xx. & by S. Luke also in the fyrst Chapyter of the Actes, and by sondry other partes of the scrypture.
                     By the way it may be noted that this eleuation of Chryste into Heauen dyd muche differ from hys eleuatyon vnto the Crosse, for there (as Esay in the. lxiii. Chapyter doth saye) Chryst alone dyd treade the Presse where here (as Dauyd in his. lxvii. Psalme and S. Paule in the. iiii. Chapiter to the Ephesians, doth saye) Christe ascending into Heauen, dyd leade captiuitie captiue with him, and gaue gyftes to men. Furthermore the eleuation vpon ye Crosse was with mooste bytter sorowe, and payne, where the ascension into heauen was wyth most vnspeakeable ioye and wonderfull gladnes. And it is not to be forgotten here, that amongest other causes why Chryst would no lenger tarye here vpon earthe, but ascende into Heauen, there are fiue speciallye noted. The fyrst, that Chrystes body beynge gloryfyed, Heauen and not the Earth, was a place conuenyent & mete for it to be cōuersaunt in. The 
                           〈◊〉
                         that by the sayde ascension he myght glorifye the humaine na ture whyche before that tyme was neuer admytted vnto heauen.

                     For the second parte of this article which is that Chryst Sitteth on the right hande of God the father Almyghtye, ye shall vnderstand, that to sit on the ryghte hande of God the father, is not after a carnall and worldely fashion to be vnderstanded, as who saith, that God the father, had (like men) a right hand, and a lefte hand, but by the sitting of Christ, on the ryght hand of God the father, is vnderstand and ment, that Chryste hath, and euer shal haue, communicated vnto hym, of God the father, glory, honoure, power, felicitie, and euerlastynge monarchye, gouernaunce, rule, and dominion, ouer all pryncypates, potestates, powers, dominions, and ouer all creatures that can be named, eyther in thys worlde, or in the worlde to come, ordeyned to be kynge of all kynges, and Lorde of all Lordes, and all thynges both in hea uen, and also in Earth to ve cast vnder his fete, and made subiecte to hym, and he appoynted to be the cheife and principall heade of the vniuersall and hole Catholyke Churche, which is his misticall Body, hauyng vnder hym in his Churche here in Earth suche ministers, and after such order and fashion, as lyked him to appoynt and ordayne in the same. And albeit that Chryste is ascended into Heauen, and syttethe on the ryght hande of God the father almyghtye, yet we maye not (as the

Cunque iutuerentur in coelum euntem illum, ecce duo uiri astiterunt iuxta illos, in uestibus albis, qui et dixerunt, uiri Galilei, quid statis aspicientes in celum? HicIESVS quia assumptus est a uobis in celum sic ueniet quē admodū uidistis eumeuntem in celum. That is to say: Whenthey dyd beholde, or loke vpon hym, departing or going into Heauen, Lo two men dyd stande by thē in whyte garmentes who also dyd say, 
                           〈◊〉
                         men of Galile, what do you stande lokynge vp into Heauen. This Iesus who is assumpted or taken vp from you into Heauen, shall

so come as ye haue sene him goyng or departing into heauen.
                     And so ye see, that into Heauen he is ascended, and from heauen he shall descende, or come. And here shall ye learne that there are two speciall commings of Chryste into the worlde, mentioned and spoken of in scripture, and they be very diuers in them selues the fyrst commynge of Chryste into this worlde, was to be borne of the virgyn Mary, and by his deathe & passion to redeme the worlde, of which is spoken fully and largely, in the exposition, or declaration of the thyrde Article of this Crede. The second commynge of Chryste into this worlde, shalbe to iudge, bothe the quicke and the deade, as is conteyned in this. vii. article. And concernyng the second parte whyche is his comminge to iudge the quicke and the deade, ye shall vnderstand that our sauioure and redemer Jesus Chryst, beyng ascended (as is declared afore) into heauen, shal come from thence, that is to saye: from heauen into this worlde, and he shall come in his glorye and maiestie, and shall then, in the verye visyble fourme of his naturall body, appeare vnto the bodely eyes of all the people of the worlde, in his perfecte manhode, and in the selfe same bodye, wherein he ascended, to the inestimable comforte and reioyse of the good, and the extreme terroure, and confusion of the wycked. Where being accompanied with hys holye Angells his ministers, waytynge vpon hym, he shall sit openly in the cloudes of the ayre, and shal iudge al, quicke and deade, accordinge to truthe and iustyce & accordyng to his holye worde expressed in scrypture,

that is to saye: accordyng to euery mans owne workes and dedes, done by him in hys lyfe tyme, whyche workes and dedes shalbe then examined dyseussed, & tryed, not after menes owne fantasye and inuention, wythout aucthoritie and grounde of Scryptur: but accordyng to the commaundement of God, and the teachyng of Chryste, and his Apostles: For at that day of iudgement, all the people of the worlde, quicke and deade, that is to say, aswell all those whiche shall be founde on lyue in the worlde at that daye, as also all those, which euer syth the creation of Adam, lyued here in thys worlde, and dyed before that daye shall come and appeare afore the presence of Christ, in their very bodyes and soules.
                     And when they shall be so gathered and assembled together, oure sauyoure IESVSCHRIST, shall pronounce the finall sentence and iudgement of euerlastyng saluation vpon all those persons, whyche in theyr lyfe tyme obeyed and confyrmed them selues vn to the wyll of God, and excused the workes of righte beleife and charitie, and so perseueryng in well doing sought in theyr hartes and dedes, honoure, glory, and lyfe immortall. And contrarywyse, vpon all those, which in theyr lyfe tyme were coutentions, and dyd 
                           〈◊〉
                         agaynst the wyl of God, and folowed in iustice, and iniquitie, rather than truth and vertue, our sauiour Chryst shal than and there pronounce the sen tence of euerlastynge punyshment and dampnation. In whyche sentence there shalbe made a perfect sepa ration or diuision, betwene these two sorts of people that is to saye: betwene the shepe and the goates, the

come and the chaffe, the good and the badde, the blessed and the cursed, the members of his bodye, and the members of the deuyll, and so the good and the blessed, being vpon his ryght hande he shall clearely, and perfectly delyuer them for euer, from the power & ma lyce of the wycked, and from all paynes and euyll: and so take them all vp with him into heauen, there to be crowned and rewarded in bodye, and soule, with honoure, and glorye, and euerlastyng ioye, and peace, which was prepared for them from the beginnynge of the worlde. And all the other whych shalbe iudged to euerlastyng payne, and death (beyng vpon hys lefte hande) he shall send them downe into Hell, there to be punyshed in bodye and soule eternallye, with fyér that neuer shall haue ende, whych was pre pared from the begynnynge of the worlde, vnto the Deuyll and his Angels.
                     And here it is speciallye to be remembred howe thys article was for great considerations added immediatelye, and conioyned vnto the former articles, and chiefly, to the intent that no man shuld in his life tyme, 
                           〈◊〉
                         vpon the sayde benefites of Chryste, or take occasion of carnal liberty or securitie, and so liue without feare to transgresse, or withoute regarde to obserue the commaundementes of God: but rather that euery good christen man, shoulde in euerye parte of his lyfe, haue a continuall remembraunce, and respecte, vnto the laste daye of iudgemente, and so be in continuall feare to commytte any thyng contrary to the wyll of God, for the whiche he myghte deserue to haue the sentence of euerlastynge dampnation pronounced

vpon hym. For thys is certaynely true, that at that daye, euery man shalbe called to an accompte of his lyfe, and shal be than fynally iudged, according to his workes, good or badde, done in hys lyfe tyme, that is (as S Paule sayeth, to them that perseuer in well doing, and laboure to attayne glorye, honoure, and immortalitie, shal be gyuen lyfe euerlastyng: and to them that be contentious, and obey not the truthe but folowe and do iniustice, shall come indignation, ire, afflyctyon, trouble, and paynes, euerlastynge.
                     In this article it is further to be noted, that like as there is nothynge more certayne vnto vs, than that we be all mortall, and shall once dye, and yet no man

                         knoweth the tyme whan he shall dye: euen so there is nothyng more certayne, than that thys daye of iudgement shal once come, and yet the houre, and tyme whan it shalbe, is hydden, and kept secret from the knowledge of all men and angels, and is reserued to the knowledge of God onely, whyche thynge precedeth onely of hys goodnes towardes vs, and is done, to the intente we should alwayes here in oure lyfe tyme, flee from sinne, and imploye all our hole stu dy and indeuour to walke in the wayes of God, that is to saye, in such fayth hope, and charitie, as God requireth of vs, and so prepare our selues, and order our

                     FOr the better vnderstandynge of thys article, ye shal note that as there is in the Trynitie, one 
                           〈◊〉
                         son, which is, and so also called, God the father, and as the same Trynytye, there is an other personne, whyche is and so also called God the sonne: soo in the same Trinitie, there is a thyrd person, whyche is and so also called, God the holye Ghoste. And knowe you also that it is not inoughe to beleue onely that there is an holy Ghost: but we must also beleue in him likewyse as we do concernyng God the father, and God the sonne, for it is not ynough for vs onely to beleue, yt there is a God the father, and that ther is a God the sonne. But we must beleue in them al, as is more specially and largelye declared before in thexposytyon of the first Article. And this holye Ghost beyng the thirde personne in Trinitie, is in dede, very God and Lorde, author, and former of al thynges created, and dothe procede bothe from God the father, and from

God the son, of one with thē in nature and substaūce and of ye same euerlastyng essence or being which the father and the sonne be of, and is equall also vnto thē both in almyghtynes of power, and in the worke of creation, and in all other thynges pertaynynge vnto the deytie or Godhed, wherefore he is also to be honored and glorified equally wyth them both.
                     This holy Ghost, which is the spyryte of God, is of his nature all holye, yea holynes it selfe, That is to say, he is the onely Ghost or spyryte, whych with the father and the sonne, is, was, and euer shalbe the author, causer, and worker, of all holynesse, purytye, and sanctimonye, and of all the grace, comforte, and spirituall lyfe, whych is wrought, and commethe into the harte of any man, in so muche that no man canne thinke well, or do any thinge that good is, but by the motion, ayde, and assistence of this holye spirite, neythere is it possible, that the Deuyll, or anye of those euel spyrites, which do possesse and reigne in suche per sons as be subiecte vnto 
                           〈◊〉
                        , can be expelled or put out of them, but by the power of thys holye spyryte, neyther is it possyble that the harte of anye manne beinge once corrupted & made as prophane by synne can be purged, purified, sanctified, or iustified, wythout the worke and operation of thys holye spyryte, neyther is it possible for any man to be reconciled vn to the fauoure of God, or to be made and adopted in to the number of his chyldren, or to obtayne that in comparable treasure, whyche oure sauioure Iesus Chryste 
                           〈◊〉
                         purchased and layd vppe for mankynd, oneles this holy spyryte shall first illumyne and lyghten

his harte, with the ryght knowledge and faythe of Chryst and stirre him by grace, to haue dewe 
                           〈◊〉
                        , & penaunce for his synnes, & shall also instruct hym, gouerne hym, aide hym dyrecte hym, and indue him, wyth such spiritual gyftes and graces, as shalbe requisite and necessary to that ende and purpose.
                     Moreouer thys holy spirite of God, is of hys owne nature full of all goodnes and benignitie: 
                           〈◊〉
                         goodnesse it selfe, from whome procedeth all and singuler graces & gyftes of feare, wysedome vnderstandyng, counsell, strength, faythe, charitie, hope and all other whych be geuen, conferred, and distributed, vnto vs mortall men here in the Earth, at his owne wyll and dispensation, and that no man canne purchase or obteyne, ne yet receaue, retayne, or vse anye of them, wythoute the operatyon of thys holy Spyryte, whych gyftes neuerthelesse he geueth not, nor dispen seth the same equally and to euery man a lyke, but he deuideth them particularly and speciallye to euerye member of the Churche, as is most necessarye for the hole body, and in suche plentye and measure, as vnto his Godly will and knowledge is thought to be most beneficiall and expediente for the same, All whyche thynges he doth of his mere mercy and goodnes frely and aboue our deseruyng.
                     Furthermore this holy spirit is of his owne nature ful of charitie & holy loue, yea charitie it self, frō whōe procedeth al charitye, & so by his godly operatiō is the bond & knot, wherewith our Sauioure Iesus Christ and his most dere espouse the Church (whiche is also hys misticall body) be vnyted, knytte and conioyned

together, in such perfect & euerlastinge loue and charitie that the same cannot be dyssolued or separated: And ouer this, is also the very bond and knot, where by all and euerye one of the verye members of Chrystes Churche and Bodye, be vnited, coupled, & conioyned, the one of them with the other in mutuall loue and charitie.
                     Also thys holye spyryte of God is the spyrite of truthe, and the aucthour of all holye scripture, conteined in the hole canon of the byble, and dyd not onely inspyre, and instruct all the holy patriarches and prophetes, with all the other members of the Catholike Churche, that euer were from the begynnyng of the worlde, in all the Godlye truthes and verytyes, that euer they dyd knowe, speake, or wrytte, but also descended and appeared in the similitude and lykenesse of fyrye tonges, and dyd lyghte vpon the Apostles & Dyscyples of Chryste, and inspyred them wyth the knowledge of all truth, and replenyshed them wyth heauenly gyftes and graces: and shalbe contynually present in the Catholyke Church, and shal teach and reuele vnto the same Church, the secretes and mysteryes of all truth, whych are necessarye to be knowen, and shall also continuallye from tyme to tyme, rule, dyrecte, gouerne, and sauctyfye the same Churche, & gyue remyssion of synnes, and all spirituall comforte aswell inwardelye by secret operations, as also outwardelye by the open mynystratyon and effycacye of the worde of God, and of the holy Sacramentes, in the sayd Churche: and shall endue it wyth all such spyrytual graces and gyftes, as shalbe necessarye for

the same.
                     
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         shall also note, that albeit holy Scrypture dothe worthely attribute, vnto the holy Ghost, our sanctification, our iustification and al other benefites which Chryst by hys passion hath meryted and deserued for vs, yet neuerthelesse the same be also the workes of the hole Trynitie, and be not to be seperated in any wyse, although Scripture commonly doth attribute them vnto the holy Ghost: For in lyke 
                           〈◊〉
                         dothe Scrypture artribute power vnto the father, and wysdome vnto the sonne, whyche neuerthelesse be common vnto all three.
                     
                        FINALLY ye shall note the maner of the speache here in thys article, where it is not sayde. I beleue ye Ghost or spirite, but it is sayd, I beleue in ye holy Ghost, and so holy is adioined vnto ye Gost, whiche is done not onely to declare that here is not mente of euery thynge that is or maye be called a spyryte or a Ghost, but here is onely ment of that spyryte, whyche by excellencye, and by peculyer name in Scrypture bothe is and so also called, the holy spyryte or Ghoste which is the thyrd person in Trynytie, and therefore thoughe manye tymes in Scrypture, an incorporall thing is called a spyryte, and also both Angels and ye myndes of men dyuerse tymes haue that appellation or name, yet here aswell for the sayde peculier name, as by a certen excellency, the sayd thyrd person in trinytie, is called the holy spyryte, or holy Ghost, for he it is that doth make holye or sanctifye all creatures, that are called holye.

                     IN these fewe wordes, of this nynthe Article foure thynges are to be considered, fyrste what heare is ment by thys worde, Churche. Secondely whye or for what cause the same Churche is called Holye. Thirdely why it is called, Catholyke. And forthely what it is To beleue the holi Catholike Churche Concernyng the fyrste ye must vnderstande that thoughe in oure Englyshe tonge we by thys worde Churche, sometymes do meane the place wherein the word of GOD is commonlye preached and the sacramentes mynistred, and vsed, yet in this present article it dothe sygnyfye the hole multitude of people, which being called of GOD do come, to one fayth, one doctryne, the selfe same Sacramentes accordyng to the Apostolyke, and catholyke tradition, in an indiui sible bonde or knotte of concorde, and vnytie, whether the sayde multytude be of the cleargye, or of the laytie. Concernyng the seconde ye shall consyder that albeit in the sayd church or multitude of people, there be many euyll men, many synners, many that tourne by true penaunce to grace, and sometymes yet do fall agayne: some after theyr tourne by true penaunce, styll perseuer and contynue in goodnes, manye also that fall and neuer ryse agayne, so that spottes, blots,

and imperfections, doo appeare 
                           〈◊〉
                         in thys Churche, and manye tymes in the more parte thereof yet neuerthelesse because the callyng is of it selfe holy the caller also most holy, and the ende of callynge, holynes it selfe, with this 
                           〈◊〉
                         that the people soo called do prosesse holynes, aud make a bodye, where of the cheife headde our Sauiour Chryste is mooste holye or rather holynes it selfe, by the merytes of whose 
                           〈◊〉
                         the sayde people are releued, and nouryshed with the seuen holy sacramentes, and be in theyr callyng endued with moste speciall holy gyftes, and gra ces of almyghtye God, beynge authoure thereof, and fynally by hys holy spyryte are directed, and gouerned in the saine, so longe as they (by folowyng theyr concupyscence, the Deuyll, or the worlde) do not fall from that state. For these causes, I say, the Church is called Holye, takyng this name Holye, of that, that Chryste the highe headde thereof is Holye, God the caller, Holye, The profession and callynge, Holye, & the ende Holynes. whych of very dewty, ought to be in all them that be called, and is in dede', in suche members as doo continue and perseuer in that holye callyng. Touchynge the thyrde ye must vnderstande that thys worde. Catholyke, being orygynally taken out of the Greke toungue, and nowe vsed in oure Englyshe tongue, is asmuche to saye as vnyuersall or whole. And forasmuch as God of hys goodnes dothe call al people (as is afore) withoute all acceptyon of 
                           〈◊〉
                        , or acception of Countrye, therefore thys Churche is called, Catholyke, in asmuch as all people

of all maner of estates, of all places and countryes throughout the hole worlde, may (professyng the foresayd one fayth, one doctrine, and the selfe same sacramentes, accordyng to the sayd Apostolique and catho lyke tradition) be of thys Catholyke churche, and cō
                        tynue in the same, excepte they wyllyngly, by heresy & scysme, do goo out of it, or for other theyr offences be cut of and cast oute thereof. And here by the waye is to be noted, that althoughe in the worlde ther be manye particuler Churches, and seuerall multytudes of people, hauing the sayd fayth, the sayd doctryne, and the selfe same Sacramentes accordynge to the sayde tradition, and therefore are commonlye called euerye one of them, catholyke, yet they all together make but one catholyke vniuersall Churche, of whyche one catholyke vniuersall Churche, al the rest be called catholyke, as beynge partakers and members, of the sayd one catholyke vniuersall Church, and fully agreing in al necessary poyntes with the same. And nowe as concernyng the fourth whyche is, What it is. To beleue the Catholyke Churche. Ye shal vnderstand that to beleue the Catholyke Churche, is not onelye to beleue that here in earthe is and shalbe continually to thend of the worlde, such a holy catholyke Churche (as before is declared commonly called the Church Mylytante) but also to gyue credyte and beleife vnto the whole Doctryne, fayth, and religyon of the sayd Church.
                     And for the farther vnderstanding of thys whole article, here maye moost frutefully and verye well to the purpose, be brought in one most notable place of

Thys churche he calleth catholyke, that is to saye, spredde thoroughout the whole worlde, because the churches of sundrye heretikes, be ynge but in perticuler places and prouinces, can in no wyse be called catholyke.

Exod .xxxiii. There is a place with or byme, and thou shalt stand vpon the rocke. &c. and by and by after he saieth. I will take awaye my hande, and thou shalt se my backe part. And because in dede out of this catholyke church alone, the truth is sene our Lorde sayeth, a place to be wyth him frō whych he may be sene, Moyses is sette vpon the rocke, that he maye beholde the forme of God, for onles a man haue and hold the stedy substanciales of faith, he knoweth not ye dyuine presence, Take away sayth he (meanyng S. Cyprian) the beame of the sonne from the body of the sonne, the vnitie of the lyght, can not suffer no diuision: breake a boughe from the tree, the bough so broken, can florishe and budde no more, cut of the riuer frō the spring, the ryuer so cut of, dryeth vp. In these wordes of Cypryan we perceyue that lyght doth not admytte any diuision in the sayntes predestinate to the Kyngedome of God, which can by no meanes be deuided frome the Churche, and that the bough broken of, can not budde with a budde of euerlastyng saluation. And fynally we knowe the drying vp of the riuer beinge cutte of from the sprynge or heade, in

that they are made voyde of the holye ghoste whych are seperate frō the vnitie. Thus muche sayeth S. Augustyne, wherby it appeareth yt though we muste beleue in God the father, in God the sonne, and in God the holy Ghost (as was declared here afore vnto you in the expositiō of the first artycle of this crede) yet concernynge the Catholique Churche, we must beleue it. That is to saye: geue credite to it, but not to beleue in it: for to beleue in it, were to make it God, as more at large shalbe declared in some Homelies, hereafter specially to be made thervpon, & also by what sygnes & tokens the true Catholyke churche is continually knowen.
                     And forasmuch as this catholyke militant church of which this article entreateth, hath for the preseruation of the vnitie thereof, by the ordinaunce, and appoyntment of our sauiour Chryst, one principall head or cheife gouernour, here vpon earth, whiche beynge the chief vycar, and substitute of Chryst, in hys sayde church, doth, and ought, with other ministers vnder him attende, and geue heade, to the good order, and rule of the said militant churche (S. Peter the Apostle being the firste generall vycar aud gouernoure, therein, and hauing to hym, and to all his lawful successours iu the Apostolique see, the gouernaunce, rule and charge thereof, cheifelye committed and geuen, whych in very dede, both he and they, by the continuall helpe, and assistaunce of the holye spyryte of God, from tyme to tyme in theyr succession, alwaies hither to haue done, and thereby haue preserued, and kepte the vnitie of the sayde churche) therefore all they whiche haue, or do refuse to acknowledge the said gouernoure,

gouernement, and aucthoritie, can not in anye wyse be accompted or taken for catholyke persones, but for suche as in dede are disobedient, seditious scismatike, and verye wicked people, as more at large shalbe declared in some homelies to be specially made therevpon.

                        The communion of saynctes, The forgeuenes of synnes.
                     
                     IN this article be taughte two speciall fruites and benefites, whiche all men called of God, and obeyinge to the same, callinge in their wyll and workes, doe obtayne by Goddes grace, in the sayd Catholyke churche, that is to say. The communion of saintes and forgyuenes of synnes. And here is to be noted, that although this worde, Sainctes, in oure Englyshe toungue signifieth properly them that be departed this life, and be established with glorye in Chryst. 
                           〈◊〉
                         the same worde Sainctes, (whereby in thys article we expresse the Latyn word, Sanctorum,) is here extended to signifye not onely those that be so departed this life and established, but also such as beyng in lyfe here in earth, be called into this holy assēble and Churche, and be sanctyfyed in oure Sauyoure Iesu Chryste. Accordyuge wherevnto S. Paule in sondry

hys epystles, to the Roma. 12. to the Epher. to the Philip. 4 to the Colos. 1. and to the

                     And as touchyng the fyrst of the sayd. ii. frutes or benefites, whiche is. The cōmunion of saintes. That is to saye the mutual participation of saynctes, ye shall vnderstande that lyke as al the 
                           〈◊〉
                         parts and members of the naturall body of man, do naturally communicate and be participante of one spirit or soule which gouerne the sayde bodye, and euerye lyuelye parte thereof, euen so doe all good Chrysten men, participate of one holy ghost, whyche alwayes gouerneth the catholyke churche, and allyuely mem bres of the same, and doth geue to sondrye members, sondry spirituall giftes, to the intent the whole body should therby be edified, accordyng to the sayinge of S. Paule in the, xii. Chapter of his fyrste Epystle to the Corynthians, where he sayeth in thys maner.

Hec autem omniaoperas tur unus a que idem spiritus, diui dens singulis prout uult. That is. The gyftes of the holye ghoste are geuen to euery man, to profyte other wythall, to one is geuen throughe 
                           〈◊〉

                         by the same spyryte to

another, fayth by the same spirite, to another the gifte of healinge by the same spyryte, to another power to doe miracles: to another prophecye, to another iudgement to discerne spirites, to another dyuerse tongues, to another interpretation of sayinges. And al these thinges worketh the selfe same spirite, deuydinge to euerye man as he wyll. By which place of Saynt Paule, it is euident that al the lyuelye members of the Churche doe communycate and participate of one common spiryte.
                     And this participation beinge one of the hygheeste benefites, that men receaue in the Catholyke Churche, is comprehended in this article of the communion of Saynctes. Of whyche communyon the Prophet Dauid in his. cxviii. psalmedoth also speake sayinge. Particeps ego sum omnium timentium te, et 
                              〈◊〉
                            man data tua That is to say. I am partaker wyth all suche as feare the, and kepe thy 
                           〈◊〉
                        . But besides this foresayd participation or communion of the holy ghost, beyng commune to all the liuelye members of the Churche, there is also an other communion comprehended lykewyse in thys article, whiche is the 
                           〈◊〉
                         or vnion that all good christen men haue with Chryste, who is the heade of the churche and who hath for his mystycall bodye the whole churche. And of this kynde of communion of Saynctes, S. Paule lykewyse speaketh,

in the foresayd twelth chapiter of hys fyrst epystle to the Corynthyans, saying. In uno spiritu omnes nos in 
                              〈◊〉
                            pus baptizati sumus, siue dei, siue gentiles, siue serui, siue liberi & omnes in uno spiritu potati sumus. That is to saye: In one spyrite are we all baptyzed to make one bodie, whether we be Iewes or Gentils, free or bonde, and haue all dronke of one spyryte. And lykewise doth he in the fifte to the Ephesians where spea kyng of the same he sayeth. 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                            sumus corporis eius, de car ne cius, et de ossibus cius. That is to saye: We are membres of his bodye (meanyng of the body of Christ) and of his fleshe and of his bones.
                     And forasmuch as the moste blessed sacrament of the aulter (wherein by the myghtye operatyon of Goddes worde, is really present in the fourmes of breade and wyne the naturall lyuynge bodye and bloude of oure sauyoure and redemer Iesu Chryste) doeth increase and worke in all them that worthelye doe receaue it, the communion and coniunction in bodye & soule of them to Chryste, and of Chryst to them, with a mutuall coniunctyon also in loue and charytye, of eche good man in Christ to other. Therefore the sayd Sacrament may also worthely be called the commu nion of Sayntes. And so hathe the fyrst parte of this article been by good deuoute and learned menne expounded longe ago.
                     Nowe touchy nge the seconde fruite or benefite in thys article whyche is the remission of synnes, you shall vnderstand, that onely in the catholyke church,

and no where els the remissiō of synnes is to be had. And there vndoubtedlye it is to be had: and that by two meanes, that is to wytte by baptisme, and after baptisme by due penaunce and 
                           〈◊〉
                         of the keyes, geuen vnto the churche. And as for baptisme it washeth cleane awaye al the former synnes as well actuall as originall: so that they shall neuer after that be imputed vnto vs. But in case after baptisme we fall into synne then the remedy must be by the wholsome sacramente of Penaunce, whiche sacrament is of so greate forse and vertue, that howe heynous so euer oure synnes and offenses be, yet by the meane of the same, the sayde synnes maye be and are released & forgeuen vnto vs. And for to take away all doutyng on our behalfe herein, and that no man shoulde nede to dispayre, oure Sauioure Chryste openlye and by expresse wordes, in the twentye of Sayncte Iohn af ter he had breathed vpon hys Disciples, sayde vnto them, and generallye to theyre Successours.

Tibi dabo claues regni celorum: quodcunque ligaueris super terram crit ligatum et in celis: et quodcumque solueris super terram erit solutum et in celis. That is to saye: Unto thee will I geue the

Keyes of the kyngdome of heauen, whatsoeuer thou doest bynde vpon earth, shall also be bounde in heauen, and whatsoeuer thou loosest vpon earth, shall also be loosed in heauen. Which

Wherefore good people (accordyng to the exhortation of the Prophete Ezechiell, in the eyghtenth chapter) Tourne and doe penaunce for all youre iniquities, and youre iniquitye shall not be your destruction. But youe shall vndoutedly (accordyng to thys article) be vnburdened of your synnes, and made partakers of the communion of saynctes bothe in thys worlde and in the worlde to come.

                     ¶ The exposition or declaration of the twelft Article of the Crede, whiche is.
                     
                        And the lyfe euerlastynge. Amen.
                     
                     In these fewe wordes is the moost comfortable and ioyous knyttynge vppe of this Crede that maye be. For two excellent thinges are here sette fourth to be beleued, the fyrst is Lyfe, whiche all thynges do desyre: the second, is the Eternitie, and continuall lastyng of it. which is a thyng that maketh it most pleasaunte, and most swete and most profitable. And when I do saye that ther is a lyfe, and also an euerlastyng lyfe, I doo meane both concernyng the body and also concernynge the soule, for vnto them bothe this euerlastyng lyfe shal without any endynge contynue and abyde.
                     
                        B V T H E R E muste ye marke, that lyke as the good shall enioye for euer, thys mooste

                         estate of euerlastyng lyfe to theyr vnspeakeable comforte and gladnes, so also the noughtye and wycked shall bothe in bodye, and also in soule receaue for euer punyshmente and tormente incessantly, accordynge whervnto our Sauiour Chryst in the. xxv. of saynte Mathewe sayeth. Et ibunt hi in supplicium 
                              〈◊◊〉
                            em in uitam eternam. That is to saye. And they (meanynge the noughtye and wycked) shall goe into euerlastinge punyshment, but the iuste shall goo

into lyfe euerlasting. And herevpon maye be 
                           〈◊〉
                        , that though the noughtye, and wycked shall continue for euer, and haue immortalitie, yet forasmuch they so contynuing shall neuer haue ioye but euerlastyng torment of body and soule, without hope of forgyuenes, and wythoute anye ende: Therefore theyr contynuaunce and immortalitie is rather to be called euerlastynge deathe, then euerlastynge lyfe, or lyfe at all, accordynge whervnto S. Paule in the. vi chapiter of his epystle to the Romaynes, doth saye. Stipendia enim peccatimors, gratia autem dei uita 
                              〈◊〉
                           , in CHRISTO IESV domino nostro. That is to saye: The rewarde in dede of synne is death, but eternall lyfe is the gyfte of God through Jesu Chryst our lorde. So that such as haue led theyr lyues, in obedience & obseruation of Goddes commaundementes. and die in true fayth and charitie, shall then be perfectly

                        , and shalbe perpetuallye glorified, and receaue both in bodye and soule together, euerlastynge lyfe, which lyfe euerlastyng, though it passeth all mennes wittes, to expresse howe pleasaunt and ioyefull it is, and that mannes capacitie, can not compryse and vn derstande the same (as S. Paule witnesseth in hys

                         holye scrypture speaketh of it, after our capacitie, and intelligence, but farre vnder the worthynes & excellency thereof. For the prophete Esay sayeth, in the. xxxv. chapiter. Euerlastynge gladnes shalbe ouer their heades, they shall haue ioye and gladnes, sorowe and wayling shall forsake them. And 
                           〈◊〉
                         Jhon in the seuenth chapyter of hys 
                           〈◊〉
                         sayeth, God that sytteth on his throne shal dwell ouer them They shall not hunger or thyrste anye more, neyther sonne nor heate shall hurte them, for the lambe that is in the myddes of the throne, shal fede them, and bryng them to the fountaynes of the water of lyfe: and God shall wype awaye all weapyng & teares from theyr eyes, death shall endure no longer. There shalbe no waylyng, nor crying, nor sorowe anye more, 
                           〈◊〉
                         there is no ioye or comforte, that can be wysshed for, but it is there moost plentyfully. There is true glorye, where prayse shalbe without errour or flattery. There is tru honour which shalbe geuen to none, onles he be worthye, there is true peace, where no man shalbe molested or greued, neyther by hymselfe, nor by others. There is true and pleasaunte felowshype, where is the company of blessed angels, and the elect and chosen 
                           〈◊〉
                         of God. There is true and perfecte loue, that neuer shall fayle. For all the heauenly companye is linked and fastened together, by the bonde of perfecte charitie, whereby also they be vnited and knitte to almyghty God euerlastynglye.
                     
                        Fynallye there is the true rewarde of all Godlynes, God hym selfe, the sight and fruition of whome, is the ende and rewarde of al oure beleife, and of all oure good workes, and of all those thynges whyche were purchased for vs by Chryst, He shalbe oure sacietie, or fulnesse, and desyre, he shalbe oure lyfe, oure helth our glorye, our honour, oure peace, oure euerlastyng reste and ioye, he is the ende of all our desyres, whome we shall se continually, whom we shall loue most feruently, whom we shall prayse and magnifye incessantly, and world without ende.
                     And forasmuch as most firmely and wythout all doute we beleue al the foresayd articles of this crede and euery thing concerninge the same, and in them comprehended to be moste true: And moreouer for yt we lykewyse beleue al thynges whiche concerne eyther oure creation, redemption, or sanctification, of the heuenly father, by hys sonne, and with the holye ghoste, to be fully wrought, and that they shall moste certenlye through the mercye of God, come vnto vs. Therefore in the ende of this crede we saye. Amen. Whiche is a worde confirmyng a sayinge, and a pray inge that it maye soo be allowed and establysshed, the verye signification of whyche worde beyng, be it so, moost certaynelye.
                  
               
               
                  
                  Of the seuen Sacramentes.
                  FOrasmuche as there are nowe two parts performed of the promyse made vnto you in the preface of thys worke, it is to wytte, of the acception or ta kynge of this worde Fayth, and also of the articles ofye 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      with expositiō, or declaratiō of the same. The nexte matter to be set forth and declared, is the treatyse of the. vii. Sacramentes, with theyr expositions. And forasmuche as it is expediente before the speciall intreatye therof, to speake somewhat, aswell of the signification of this word Sacrament being taken in his generaltie, as also to defyne in specialtie howe this word Sacrament, shalbe taken and vnderstanded here in this treatyse, therefore here in the begynning, these two thynges shalbe set fourth and opened vnto you.
                  And as concernyng the fyrste, ye shall vnderstand that this worde Sacrament, is diuersely takē, for amongest them that haue a respecte to the proprietie of the Latin tounge, & do seke the significatiō thereof in prophane writers. A sacramente amonge other 
                        〈◊〉
                     , is pryncipally called an obligation or

promyse made and confyrmed by an othe, of whyche thinge S. Augustine in his. clxxxi. Sermon maketh mention. And amonges them that haue a respect vn to scrypture, and the wryters thereof, a Sacrament doth signify a mistery, that is to saye, a secret or hydden thynge apperteynyng to the religion: and so beyng consydered, it is sometymes taken in a more larger signifycation, and sometymes in a more strayter: and beynge taken in the larger signification it doth signifye euerye secrete mysterye appertaynynge to religion, and euerye holy thynge hydden, thoughe it be not a sygne or token of another thyng, as whē we vse to name and say, the sacrament of the godheade, meanynge thereby the very godhead it selfe, whythe is a hyd and secrete thynge, and yet not a sygne or token of any other thynge. And in this signification also S. Paule doth vse it in the fyrste Chapter of hys epystle to the Ephesians, where he sayeth that God hath reueyled or opened vnto vs the Sacrament of his wyll, meanynge there (by the Sacramente of hys wyll) the secrete eternal wyl of God, whereby he appoynted from the begynnynge, that the Gentyles shoulde be incorporated, and made partakers of hys promyse in Iesu Chryste, in whome we al haue trust, and in truste, haue an accesse by fayth vnto him. And lykewise he doth in the thyrd chapter of his fyrst epystle to Tymothe, where be writeth 
                        〈◊〉
                      this maner. Et manifeste 
                           〈◊〉
                         est pictatis Sacramentum, quod mainfestatum est 
                           〈◊◊〉
                        . &c. That is to saye: And vndoubtedly, great is the Sacrament of godlynes, whiche is she wed in the flesh. &c. Meanyng therby, that Chryst

hym selfe is a great Sacrament of godlines, for that he beyng the inuisible sonne of God, is manifested or opened in the fleshe.
                  And this worde sacramente, beynge taken after the strayter maner or acception, (in which moost cō
                     monlye it is) it signifieth the sygne of a holye thynge, which beareth the similitude or likenes of the thyng, whose signe it is. After which sort the sygnes and fygures of the olde testamente are called sacramentes, & so the auncient fathers, speakynge of the sygnes of the olde testament, do vse commonly and frequently to name them. According whereunto S. Augustine in the. xiii. Chapiter of his. xix. boke agaynst Faustus doth saye. Prima Sacramenta gue obseruabantur & celebrabantur ex lege 
                           〈◊〉
                         erant Christi uenturi. That is to saye: The fyrste Sacramentes whyche were obserued and celebrated by the lawe, were prenunciatyue of Christe to come. Nowe to consider the signification of this worde sacrament, as it shalbe con sidered and vsed in this treatyse, (which is the moost straytest signification of al other) ye shall note, that it being so takē, is defined after this sort. That is to say Asacrament is a visible signe of an inuisible grace of God, whiche grace, God effectually and certenly, doth worke in it, so that the same be duelye handled, and not vnworthelye receaued. Accordyng to which diffinition, and the worde sacrament being so taken, there are. vij. sacramentes of the churche and no mo, it is to wytte, Baptysine, Confyrmation, Penaunce, Eucharistie (or the sacrament of the aultare) Order,

Matrimonye, and extreme vnction. And these seuen to be suche sacramentes, and mysteryes, and so truly and properly to be accepted and taken, the olde auncient fathers of the catholyke church, haue prudently and godly obserued, & noted especiallye, for that they so be sensible signes of the inuisible grace of God, that they both beare the ymage, or similitude, and be also the cause of the inuisible grace of God that is geuen, Which to make more playne and manyfest vnto you let vs for declaration hereof, consider external thynges. 
                        〈◊〉
                      know that externall thinges may sometims be considered as done for them owne selues, and the same external thinges may also be considered as dōe for other thynges, to be signified and noted by them in that respect in whiche they are in dede, and be called signes or tokens. As for example, a rynge is sometyme geuen not as a signe or token of an other thing but onely for it owne self, & sometymes it is geuē as a conuenient and fytte sygne or token of fydelitie, as whan the Lorde doth geue 
                        〈◊〉
                      his vassail a rynge, for a token of the inuestiture of possession or liuerye of his fee or gyfte, which rynge beynge so geuen and receaued, the vassall not onelye is asserteyned of the beneuolence or benefit receaued of his Lord, but also there is contracted and made thereby, betwene the sayd vassall, and his sayde Lorde, a certayne couenaunte and bargayne, so that the sayd vassal, hauing receaued the same rynge, maye saye, I haue nowe a tytle of inheritaunce, and not a rynge onelye. After the same maner must you thinke and beleue (whyche is the chefe poynte in this matter) that our lorde Iesus

Christe, did chose and ordeyne signes, by whiche God in the vertue of hys worde, myght cure or heale our synnes, and (as it were) inueste vs of hys grace, and bynde vs vnto hym by a spiritual bonde or couenaunte. For so commonlye it semed good to God almyghtye, by sensyble thynges, and signes to lead and traine vs to inuisible and spiritual thinges. And such also is the dulnes of our vnderstandynge (beynge deriued vnto vs from oure fyrste parentes Adam and Eue, throughe theyr transgression) that of our selues we are not able to ryse vp, or clymbe to the knoweledge of God, or by the forse of oure reason, to attayne to the knowledge of gods wyll, in releasynge or forgeuynge synnes.
                  Wherefore God alwayes bothe by wordes and also by outwarde or external signes, hath dealt with vs, whereby he myghte open or 
                        〈◊〉
                      hym selfe vnto vs, and also declare hys wyl by the same. In so much that where as in olde tyme God by many meanes & by sondry wayes did speake in his prophetes, & gaue counsayle as by worde, by the lawe, by sygnes aud wonders, he hath nowe last of all spoken in or by his onely sonne our lorde, whome hys wyll was to take our fleshe on him and be crucified for vs, that we castyng our eyes and consyderations vpon hym, beyng made lyke vnto vs visible, palpable, and as a mooste myghtye sygne, sent and geuen of god, and hearynge hym speake, myght begyn in hym to knowe god, beleue and put our whole confidence in god, & finallye to loue god aboue all thynges elles. For in hym the power, wysedome, and goodnes of God, doe shyne

most perfectly and clearely, in whome the fulnesse of the diuinitie doeth dwell corporallye. And by what signe els coulde God more myghtylye or effectuallye haue declared that he had a speciall care for vs, thē to send his son & declare that whosoeuer beleueth i him perysheth not, but hath eueriastinge life. And for that al the vertue & effect of the passiō of our sauiour Iesus Chryst (as muche as concerneth vs) doth consiste in the application thereof (that is to wytte, that we may be made partakers of that grace, which Chryst on the Aultare of the Crosse, deserued or meryted vnto vs by his death,) for thys sayde entente and ende, Christe hym selfe hath vouchesaued to leaue 
                        〈◊〉
                      hym certayne Sacramentes, whyche he hathe confyrmed and establyshed vnto vs by hys worde and promyse: that by the dewe and lawefull vse of them, we myghte knowe, and bee assured, the fruite of his passion effectualiye and moste certenlye to be imparted and communicated vnto vs. True it is that without any maner of visible forme he coulde indewe vs with his grace, but because we are carnal and very dull to comprehende spirituall thinges, and the force of oure soule beynge weakened and cō
                     bred with the clogge and busye workynge of our corrupte body, we often tymes fal from faith, hope, and charitie: Therefore the fraylcnes of our fleshe muste vnder a visible forme be repayred, styrred vp, enstruc ted, nourished and comforted. And leaste anye man shoulde doubte of the vertue and efficacye of the visible Sacramentes, God hath added to the visible

                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , his worde of promysse: and moreouer at the begynnynge when Sacramentes were fyrste ministred, he adioyned manifest visions and miracles, to the intent that such thinges as we once see done, we should with an earnest fayth beleue, by the same sprit of Christ. dayly to be done in the same Sacramentes As to induce the with most constant fayth to beleue, that when thou art baptized, the holye Ghost doeth come vpon the, the holy Ghost dyd therefore appeare vpon Chryste, in the fourme of a Doue when he was Baptised. And that thou shouldest lykewyse beleue, that when thou arte confyrmed, the holye Ghoste is geuen the for thy strength and force. Therefore vpon the Whytsondaye amonge the Apostels, there was made a greate sounde, and there did appeare clouen tounges as fyre, syttyng vpon the apostles. As lykewyse also (Actes the. ix.) by the imposition of Paules handes vpon such as were before that time baptized the holye ghoste came vpon them, yea, and they prophesyed. And so lykewyse concernyng the other Sacramentes: whiche euident tokens and sygnes daylye nowe to be repeted is not neede, for that a good and stronge faythe must here serue, whyche vtterlye woulde decaye and vanysh awaye, if that we would not beleue the force and vertue of the Sacramente, hauynge Chrystes wordes adioyned vnto it, vnlesse euer a manyfest myracle muste thereat be wroughte vnto vs.
                  The Sacramentes therefore of the newe testament, are especyallye for this intente instituted, that

they myghte be certayne and effectuall signes to oure outwarde sence, of the wyl and grace of god: (admonyshyng and instructinge vs, most firmelye to beleue that, that thing which we see out wardlye done by a visible signe, is effectually wrought inwardly by the vertue of God,) And they are also most readye remedies agaynst synne, and do farre passe those of the old law. For they were the shadowes of thinges to come and as sygnes and fygures were abolyshed, (Chryst after his comming hauinge fulfylled them) and they were therefore abolyshed, because they were fulfylled But these of the new testament were instituted, both as greater in vertue, better in profyt, easier in mynystration, and fewer in number (as beynge but seuen) and that they shoulde not onelye signifye, but purge and sanctifye also. In euerye of whiche seuen sacramentes, the minister or dispenser of the same, doth not execute in his owne behalfe or name, but doth represent the person of our sauiour Iesu Christ, to whome be honoure and glorye. Amen.
                  
                     
                     ¶ Of the Sacrament of Baptysme, and the exposition or declaration thereof.
                     BEcause the Sacrament of Baptisme, is in order the fyrst of al Sacramentes, and the gate or entrye, by whiche we must and doe entre into the churche and vnto the other Sacramentes thereof, to obteyne remission of oure synnes, and is a thynge so necessarye, that withoute it no man can enter into the kyngedome of God, as Christe in the thyrde chapiter of S. Johns gospell doeth playnlye testifie, sayinge: Nisi quis renatus 
                              〈◊〉
                            ex aqua 
                              〈◊〉
                            spiritu sancto, non potest 
                              〈◊〉
                            in'reg 
                              〈◊〉
                            dei. That is to saye. Excepte one be borne agayne of water and the holye ghoste, he can not entre into the kyngdome of God Therefore in this noumbre of vii. Sacramentes, the Sacrament of Baptysme for these respectes shal occupie the fyrste place.
                     For the better vnderstandynge whereof, ye shall emongeste other thynges consyder, and note foure poyntes.
                     Fyrste ye shall note that in the Sacrament of Bap tysine there are certayne formall wordes necessarye and requysyte to be vsed in the ministration thereof. Seconde that in the sayd Sacrament of Baptisme besydes the sayde formal wordes there is requyred al so an outwarde visible thing or element to be concur runt therewith. Thyrde is to be considered, the vertue, force, and effecte of the sayde Sacrament. And iiii. is to be declared, what rites solempnities, or ceremonies,

are required for the dewe administration of the sayde Sacramente. Nowe concernynge the fyrst of these foure thynges to be noted in Baptysme, ye shall knowe that oure sauyoure Chryste, when he dyd sende hys apostles to preach throughout the hole worlde, he dyd saye vnto them, as is testyfyed in the xxviii. Chapiter of Sayncte Mathewes Gospell. Data est mihi omnis potestas in coelo & in terra, euntes ergo docete omnes 
                              〈◊〉
                            baptizantes cos in nominc patris, & filij, ci spiritus sancti. That is to saye, All power is geuen vnto me in heauen and in earth, go you therfore and do you teache all nations baptizinge them in the name of the father of the sonne, and of the ho ly Ghost. By whyche playnly appeareth, that oure 
                           〈◊〉
                         Chryste, in hys commyssyon geuen vnto hys apostles, dyd prescrybe certayne formall wordes vnto them, whiche they in administration of Baptysine shoulde vse, accordyng whervnto the minister of the Churche being therein the successoure of the apostles, doeth and must vse in the administration of the Sacramente of Baptisme, these formall wordes, I doe Baptise thee in the name of the father, of the sonne, and of the holye Ghost, and thys muche for the fyrste poynte. For the seconde poynte consydered in Baptysme, ye shall note the specyall wordes of our sa uyour Christ in the foresayde, iii. Chapiter of Sainct Iohns Gospell, where speakynge of regeneration or Baptisme, he vseth these wordes. Aqua et spiritu sancto, say ing. Nisi quis renatus fucrit ex aqud & spiritu sancto non potest 
                              〈◊◊〉
                            regnum dei. Wherby it is euident that water, which is

a visible element, and an open thyng, is a substancial part of baptisme, & must nedes be concurrēt with ye formall wordes vsed in the administration of Baptisme. Accordyng wherevnto we

                         reade in the. viii chapter of the actes, that when Philip, which was one of the seuē deacons (actes: vi) had conuerted vnto the fayth of CHRIST a certayne noble man being in greate aucthoritie and offyce wyth Candate the Queene of Ethiope, he dyd baptyse the sayde noble man wyth water, so that water is required in Bap tisme. The lyke wherof appeareth the, x. Chapiter of the actes, where it is euidente that Saynte Peter, the apostle, baptysed in water one Cornelms a Centuryon and others with hym.
                     Touchynge the thyrd thynge to be considered in Baptysme whych is the vertue, force, and effect ther of, ye shall knowe, that the forgeuenes or remyssyon of synnes, and the grace of the holye ghost, is the vertue force, and effecte of baptysme, as is manyfeste in the seconde chapiter of the actes, where the blessed apostle S. Peter sayeth thus. Penitentiam agite. & baptizes tur unusquisque uestrum in nomine IESV CHRISTI, in remissionem peccatorum uestrorum, et accipietis donum spiritus sancti. That is to saye. Do you penaunce, & let euerye one of you be Baptised in the name of Iesu Christe in remission of youre synnes, and ye shall reccaue the gyfte of the Holye Ghoste. Thys effecte and grace hath thys Sacrament of baptisme by the vertue and workyng of almyghty God, there in by his minister, accordynge to his owne promyse

annexed & adioyned to this Sacrament, as playnly appeareth in the. xvi. chapter of S. Marke, where Christe geuinge commission to his Apostles to goe in the whole world to preache the gospell, sayth these wordes. Qui credideret & baptisatus fuerit saluus erit. that is to say. Who shall beleue and be baptysed, shalbe saued. And as concernynge the. iiii. thyng to be considered in baptysme, ye shall note that albeit of late, some haue vntruely preached, and reported that the maner of baptysinge or christening, nowe vsed in the Church, is not the same whiche was vsed in the prymatyue Churche, but hath ben of late yeares inuented and deuised, yet the auncient fathers bothe of the Greke & of the Latyn Churche, haue in theyr workes declared the contrarye, for profe whereof amonges many other, ye shal reade Denyce the Areopagyte in his boke De ecclesiastica hierarchia, in the tytle, De perficiendis in baptismate, of whose aucthoritie none nedeth to doubte, seyng that S. Luke in the. xvii. of the actes, maketh mention of him: ye may reade also S. Cyprian in his fyrst boke and. xii. Epistle where he sayth thus. 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                            uero mūdari & sanctificari aquā prius a sacerdote ut possit baptismo suo, peccat a hominis qui baptisatur abluere. that is to say. The wa: ter must fyrste be made cleane & sanctified of the priest that it may clense the synnes of him that is baptysed. Reade also S. Ambrose in hys treatise, De ijs qui initiantur misteriis, and in his fyrste boke al so De sacramentis. And if you list rede Chrisostome in hys Homely entituled of Adam & Eue, where amongeste diuerse other his notable sayinges ye shal fynde these

wordes folowinge. Illud etiam quod circa baptizandos in unluerso mundo sancta ecclesia, siue sunt paruulisiue iuuenes uniformiter agit, non ocioso contemplemur intuitu, quod cū ad regenerationis ueniunt sacramē
                           ium non prius fontem uite ingrediuntur quā exorcismis et exufflacionibus clericorum, spiritus ab eis immundus abigatur. That is to saye: This thyng also whiche the holye Churche through the hole worlde uniformelye dothe practyse in persones that are to be baptyled, whether they be litle children, or yong folke, let vs, not with idell consideration beholde, howe that when they do come to the Sacra ment of regeneration or baptisme, they doo not enter into the funt of lyfe before that the unclene spirite be dryuen awaye by the exorcisines, and exsufflations of the clerkes or mi nisters. Agreable wherevnto S. Austyne in his second boke. De gratia Christi. And in hys. xl. chapiter doth say thus. Ipsa sancte ecclesie sacramenta que tam prisce traditionis authoritate, concelebrat, satis indicant paruulos a partu etiam recētistimos per gratiam CHRISTI, de diaboliseruitio liberari, excepto enim quod in peccatorum remissionem, non fallaci sed fidcli misterio baptizantur, etiā prius exorcizatur in eis et exufflatur potestas contraria, cui, etiam uerbis eorum a quibus portantur, se se renunciare respondent. that is to say. The very Sacramentes of the holy Church which she by so olde or auncient tradition, to gether with other doth celebrate, sufficiently do declare. yonge chyldren, euen most newly or freshely cummen from byrthe, to be by the

grace of Chryst, deliuered from the seruyce of the deuyll. For besides that they be baptised, not with the deceatefull, but with the true misterye, there is also fyrst in them exercised, and exufflate the contrary power (meanynge there by the Deuyll) which contrary power, the childre (by the wordes of them yt did bere thē) make aunswere that they do renounce it. The same S. Augustine also in the. iiii. boke, & xxiiii Chapyter of his worke intituled, De baptismo contra Dona tistas, wryteth in this maner. Et sicut in illo latrone, quod exbap tismi sacramento defuerat compleuit omnipotentis benignitas, quia non 
                              〈◊〉
                            perbia uel contemptu sed necessitate defuerat. Sic in infantibusqui baptiza timoriuntur, eadem gratia omnipotētis implere credenda est, quod nō exa impiauoluntale, sed ex etatis indigentia, nec corde credere ad institiā possunt, nec ore confiteri adsalutem, ideo aliipro eisrespondent, ut impleatur erga eos celebratio sacramenti, ualet uti
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            ad eorum consecrationem, quid ipse respondere non possunt. That is to saye. And as the be nignitie of the almyghtye dyd fulfyll in the these (specyally mentioned in the, xxiii. of S, Luke) that thyng which wanted, as touchyng the sacramente of Baptisine, because it wanted not of pryde, nor of contempte, but of necessitie. So the same grace of the almighty, must be beleued to fulfyll that thyng in infantes, who do dye beyng baptised, which they not of wycked or noughtye wyll, but of lacke of age, neyther with hert were able to beleue to

iustice, nor with mouth confesse to saluation, by reason wherof other do aunswer for them that the celebration of ye sacrament (meaninge Baptysme) maye be fulfylled towardes them, whiche in dede is auaylable to theyr sanctification, because they cannot aunswere.
                     Nowe thys sacrament of Baptisme being instituted and ordeyned by oure Sauiour CHRISTE, in the newe testament: and the effecte and vertue of ye same being the forgeuenes of synnes: and it hauinge with it the grace of the holy ghoste: and fynally it not onely apparteynyng to all such as haue the vse of reason, who thereby haue all kynde of synnes, both originall and actuall, committed and done before theyre baptysine, clearelye taken awaye from them: but also ap pertaynynge and beinge offered vnto infantes, who being borne in originall synne, haue nede to be chrystened, and beinge offered in ye faythe of the churche, do both receue the forgeuenes of theyr synne, and also such grace of the holy ghost, that yf they dye in the state of theyr infancy, they shall by the sayd baptisme be vndoutedlie saued. Ye shall note (touchynge thys oryginall synne in infantes) that as the said infantes do take of theyr parentes theyr original and natural qualities, euen so they receyue from them, oryginall synne, by whyche they are made the chyldren of the yre of God, and by the same haue a natural inclinati on to synne, by lustes and desyres, whyche in fnrther age and tyme, sensibly doo moue and styrre them to wyckednes. For althoughe the parentes be neuer so

clene purged, and pardoned of theyr oryginall synne by baptisme, and grace geuen in the same, yet neuerthelesse the chyldren of them begotten, be conceyued and borne in original synne. Example we maye take of corne, whiche thoughe it be neuer so cleane wynowed and purged from the chaffe, yet if it be caste into the grounde and sowen, the newe whiche spryngeth of it, is ful of chaffe againe, vntyl it be also winowed and cleansed: So likewise the children of christen mē be ful of the chaffe and corruptyon of originall synne, vntyll that by baptysme, they be washed, clensed, and purged from the same as their parentes were.
                     
                        AND althoughe certayne heresies haue rysen vp and spronge in our dayes, agaynst the Chrystenynge of infantes, yet as the auncient fathers, and holy 
                           〈◊〉
                        , of the church do testify, the vniuersal consent of the churches in all places, and of all tymes vsynge, and frequentynge the Chrystenynge of infantes, is a sufficient witnesse and profe, that thys custome of the Churche in baptyzing of infantes, was vsed by Chrystes Apostles them selues, and by them geuen vnto the churche, and in the same hath been alwayes continued euen vnto these daies. And this custome and perpetual vsage of the churche euen from the begynning is agreable with the saying of S. Paule. Ephe v. Chryst loued his Churche, and hath geuen hym selfe to the deathe for his Churches sake to sanctifye her and make her holye, in cleansynge her by the fountayne of water in hys

worde. &c. So that no man is nor canne be of thys Churche, but he whych is clensed by the Sacrament of Baptysme: Lyke as the texte before alledged, sheweth, where Chryste sayethe: Whosoeuer is not borne againe of water and the holy Gost shall not enter into the Kyngedome of Heauen. Wherefore seing that out of the churche, nether infantes, nor no man els cā be saued, they must nedes be christened and clensed by baptysme, and soo incorporated into the Churche. And as the infancy of the chyldren of the Hebrues, in the olde testamente, dyd not let, but that they were made participant of the grace and benefytte geuen in Circumcision.
                     Euen so in the newe Testament, the infancye, of Chyldren doth not let, but that they maye and ought to be baptised and so receyue the graces and vertues of the same.
                     
                        AND albeit baptysme be of this great efficacye, yet ye shall vnderstande, that there remaineth in vs that be baptyzed, a certayne infirmitie, or inclination, to synne, called concupiscence whiche by lustes, and desyres, doth moue vs many times to synnes, and wickednes, neuerthelesse, almyghtye God of hys greate merci and goodnes, hath 
                           〈◊〉
                         vs such grace in this his holye Sacrament of baptysne, that suche carnall and fleshely lustes and desyres, shal not, ne can in any wyse hurte vs excepte we do fyrst consent vnto them By whiche grace also we be made more stronge, and able to resist, and withstand the sayd concupyscences

and carnall desyres, than another man is that neuer was christened.
                     
                        BVT this shall you note by the way, that chyldren, or men beyng once duley baptized, ought not in any wyse (as the Anabaptistes haue taught) to be baptized agayne, for Saynct Paule in the sixt chapter of hys Epistle to the Hebrewes sayth thus. Impossibile enim 
                              〈◊◊〉
                            qui semel sunt illuminati, gustauerūt etiā donū celeste, et participes factisunt spiritus sancti, gustauerunt nichilominus bonum dei uerbum, uir tutes que seculi uenturi, et

                            penitentiam. That is to saye: Impossible in dede it is, those who once be illuminate, and also haue tasted the heauenlye gyftes, and haue bene partakers of the holye Ghoste, and haue tasted besides the good word of God, & the vertues or power of the world to come, and be fallen: to be renewed agayne vnto penaunce. Where, (by suche renewynge) Saynt Paule vnderstandeth baptisme.
                     
                        AND because aswell this sacrament of baptysme, as all other sacramentes instituted by Chryste, haue all theyr vertue, efficacye and strength by the worde of God, whyche by his holye spirite, worketh all the graces and vertues, whiche bee geuen by the sacramentes, to all those that worthelye receyue the same: Therefore we muste vnderstande and knowe, that althoughe he whiche doeth minyster the sacrament, be of a synnefull and euyll conuersatyon, yet the vertue and effect of the sacramente, is thereby nothynge dimynished or hurted, neyther in infantes, nor yet in

them whyche beinge endued wyth the vse of reason, come there vnto truly contryte, and penytente of all theyr synnes done before, beleuynge and confessinge al the articles of the Crede, and hauyng a sure faithe and truste in the promysses of GOD of remyssyon of theyr synnes, and purposynge euer after to lyue a chrysten lyfe.
                     
                        FINALLY ye shall note concernyng thys Sacra ment of Baptisme, that it maye well be called, a coue naunte betwene GOD and vs, whereby GOD testifyeth, that he for hys sonne Chrystes sake, iustifyeth vs, that is to say: forgyueth vs our synnes, and indueth vs with his holy spiryte, and gyueth vs suche graces that there by, we be made able to walke in the workes of Justice, ordeyned by God to be exorcised of vs in thys presente lyfe, to the glorye and prayse of GOD And so perseuerynge, to inioye the fruite of the lyfe euerlastyng. And we agayne vpon our parte, oughte most diligently to remember and kepe the promysse, that we in baptysme haue made to almyghtye God, that is, to beleue onely in him, onely to serue him and obeye him, to forsake al 
                           〈◊〉
                        , and the workes of Sa tan, to mortify our affections of the fleshe, and to liue after the spirite in a newe life. Of which promise and conuenaūt by vs made to GOD S. Paule putteth vs in remembraunce, saying. Rom. vi. Knowe ye not that all we, whiche are baptyzed in Iesus Chryst, are baptysed to dye wyth hym? for we be buryed with him, by baptysme to dye, that likewyse as Chryste was raysed vp frō
                        
death by the glorye of his father, euen soo we shoulde walke in a newe lyfe. By the whyche wordes. S. Paule gyueth vs to vnderstande that al we whyche be baptized in Chryste, That is to saye whyche are incorporated into the misticall bodye of Chryst haue professed and

                        ; our selfe in Baptysme, to dye from synne, and vtterlye to abstayne from the corruption of our olde synnefull lyfe, and to walke and procede in a newe lyfe of grace, and the spirite, into the whych we are called by the word of God, and by fayth, and due receauynge of thys holy Sacrament, are brought and set into the same.

                        HAVINGE last entreated of the Sacra mente of Baptysme, by the which al maner of synne, aswell original as ac tuall, is remitted, and the holy ghost therein geuen, whiche doth regenerate vs into a newe creature, & doth thereby so weakē & attenuate ye fome, or rage of cōcu piscēce in vs, yea & so help ye weakenes of our corrupt nature, that the sayd fome of concupiscence can in no wyse hurt vs excepte we wyll againe consente vnto synne, mete and conuenient it shalbe to intreat of cō

the same, and bene therby regenerated by water and the holy ghost, is sufficient to saluation and to brynge them to heauen, if in that state of innocencye recouered and gotten by 
                           〈◊〉
                        , they shoulde by and by depart thys world. Yet yf they hauing passed the red sea shoulde entre into the greate wildernesse, and deserte of thys large and miserable worlde, in asmuche as they should encountre, & haue much to doo, wyth theyr outwarde and inwarde enemyes, aswell the fleshe, the deuyll, and the worlde, before they shoulde come to the land of promyse, requisite and expediente it, were for them to be armed at all pointes and made apte vnto the battayll, and to abyde all assaultes that theyr enemyes woulde goo aboute to make agaynste them.
                     In consyderatyon whereof, lykewyse as in the olde testament, almyghtye God, was benefyciall and good to the chyldren of Israell, whom he caused safelye to passe the red sea, drowning theyr enemyes, and confortyng the sayde Israelites manye wayes, aswell in spreadyng abroade ouer them the cloude in the daye, for theyr protection, as geuynge them fyre, to lyght them in the nyght, ouer and besydes the feadyng of them with celestiall fode, and refreshynge of them with water that yssued oute of the harde rocke. So oure blessed Sauyour Iesus Chryste, hauynge fulfylled the fygures and shadowes of the olde lawe, doth after baptysme, geue vnto his Isralites, the christen people, dyuers gyftes of the holy Ghost, and manyfoide graces, whereby he doth hold vppe, and confyrme, or make stronge his sayd people, that they are

able, to abyde & to ouercome all the assaultes of theyr

                           . That is to say. And it came so to passe when Apollo was at Corynth, that Paule (hauynge trauayled throughe or passed the ouer partes of the countreye) dyd come to Ephesus, and dyd finde there certayne disciples and he demaundinge sayde, vnto them. Haue you synce you beleued receiued the holy gost? And they aunswering saide no: nor yet haue heard whether there be any holy ghost at al.

                     By whych aucthorities, beyng of all catholyke wryters vnifourmely euer taken and vnderstand of thys sacrament of Confyrmation, it appeareth moste manifestiye that by the outward visible signe of imposytion or layinge on of the handes after baptysme, not onelye grace is geuen and conferred, but also the spirite of grace it selfe, accordyng wherevnto we reade in the. xx. chapter of Saint Ihons ghospell, that oure Sauiour Chryst, albeit after hys resurrection he dyd breath vpon his apostles sayinge, take you the holye Ghoste (whiche yet neuerthelesse in some degre they had receyued before in baptysme) yet for all that oure sayd sauiour being ready to ascend into heauen: dyd promyse to his Apostles and by them to all that by baptysme shoulde be regenerate, an other gyfte sayinge.

ye be indued with vertue from aboue. Lykewyse (as is testified Actorum. 1.) Our Sauiour (hauyng eaten with his apostles and hauing bidden them to tary at Iherusalem, and not to departe from thence, but looke for the promyse of God the father) sayeth: Accipictis uirtutem

                         shall receaue the vertue of the holy ghost commyng vpon you.
                     And this gyft so promysed, was perfourmed most eui dently vpon Whytsondaye, by visible sygnes and tokens feetlye resemblynge, and lyuelye answerynge, to thys sacrament: wherein ye may consider that as in baptisme the holye ghost came downe in the fourme of a Doue, declaryng thereby that as the Doue is of all other, simple and innocent, soo by Baptysme innocency is purchased and obtayned: So firy tonges be yng sent downe vpon the Apostles on Whitsondaye, dyd signifye the ardente zeale, and greate boldenesse that the apostles and christen people shoulde haue to expresse and declare theyr profession and fayth. Therfore, as in baptysme we are regenerate to lyfe, soo by confirmation succedynge baptysme, we are armed & strēgthened to fyght and battayle. In baptysme sinne is forgeuen and grace is geuen, in confirmation the grace geuē, is 
                           〈◊〉
                        . In baptisme we do professe the faythe and religion of Chryste. In confirmatyon we haue grace and 
                           〈◊〉
                         boldelye to mayntayne and to sticke to the same, so that he which is baptysed and confirmed hath more aboundaunt grace and glorye then he which is baptised onely. Example hereof we haue in the apostles. For Peter the heade of the apostles

although he hadde sene Chryste, tasted also of his glorye in the mounte, had harde the voyce of hys heauenly father, had sene with his eyes ye wonderfull workes that Chryst had wrought, and had hym selfe done myracles, walked vpon the water, and bene verye familier wyth Chryste. 
                           〈◊〉
                         and after that he was washed and pronounced also to be pure & clene, and finallye after he had made a bragge that he wold with Chryst go into prison and suffer death, yet after all these thynges the sayd Peter was afrayde at the voyce of a wenche, and did by and by denye Chryste, and the lyke also he dydde at the voyce of an other wenche: yea and moreouer after Chrystes resurrection, when he hadde sene Christe and receyued greate comforte at Chrystes handes, he dyd with the other Apostles for feare of the Iewes hyde hym selfe, and also when the sayde Peter with other the Apostles had sene Christ gloriouslye ascendynge, and had bene by the syghte of the aungeles greatlye comforted, yet he durst not shewe hys face abroade, but taryed and loked for the commynge of the holye Ghost, to make hym stronge and bolde. At whose commynge bothe he and the rest of the apostles were so confyrmed and boldned that they shranke not before all the Iewes, and all creatures vnder the skye, ye before the kynges & prynces, to preache the name of Iesus. And professyng theyr chrysten fayth, wyth all boldnes and constancye, did reioyce to suffer displeasures and rebukes inflicted and done vnto them therefore. And because we here doo speake of confirmation, some peraduenture do loke that we should geue some diffynytyon of

confirmatyon; wherin to satisfie theyr appetites, thys may be sayde. That Confirmation is a certayne, consignation or markyng, made with chrisme, in the foreheade of the persone that is baptyzed, wyth a certayne forme of wordes, to the intente that the person confyrmed, shoulde boldely geue the name of Christe: or els thus maye be sayde to them.
                     
                        CONFIRMATION, is an enoyntynge in the foreheade of the partye that is baptysed, made in the fygure or forme of the crosse by a Byshoppe, with holye chrysme for the strengthe, or encrease of the faythe, to be boldelye by the sayde partye confessed. And thys chrysme is made of oyle and balme. The sayde oyle (whyche is a cleare or cleane thynge of it selfe) to betoken, the clearenes or cleannes of the hearte, or conscience in oure selfe. The balme (whiche is a thynge verye fragraunt, and of a swete smellyng) to signifie ye swete and good sauoure, of good name and fame, towardes oure neyghbour, and the sayd oyle and balme beynge mingeled together to signifye, that the partye confirmed should haue truely in hym selfe, both clerenes of conscience and also wyth hys good workes to haue a good name, and to styrre there by hys neyghbours to the lyke.
                     And we ought not to thynke that thys enoyntinge is a new inuention, in asmuche as Dionyse and Clement, beynge in the apostles tyme, and besydes them, Fabian, and 
                           〈◊〉
                        , beyng very nyghe the sayde Apostles tyme, and Cypryan, Hierome, and Saynte Augustyne not being much from the Apostles tyme, with other 
                           〈◊〉
                         wryters, do vnyformely agree,

that thys sorte of enoyntyng came from the Apostles. For as concernyng Dionyse, he besydes manye other places doeth affyrme it in hys boke De ecclesiastica hierarchia, and in the. iii. chapter. And amongest many other notable thynges, doth saye thus Deinde chrisma summus sacerdos accipiens 
                              〈◊〉
                            ponit diuino altari. &c. That is to saye: The cheife preiste afterwardes takynge the chrisme, doth put it vpon the diuine aulter. &c And Clemēt doth speake hereof in the. iii. boke of his recognitions in the seconde epistle thereof. Fabiane also in hys seconde epistle wrytten to all the byshops of the Easte, doeth moste playnelye affyrme the lyke. Tertullian lykewyse in hys fyrst boke agaynst Martian doth the same.
                     And to speake of S. Cypriane, he also in hys sermon, De vnctione Chrismatis, in diuerse places doeth testifie it most largelye. Lykewyse S. Hierom most playnly in hys commentaryes vpon the xvi. chapiter of Ezechiel, and vpon the. xxxiii. of Iob.
                     And as for S. Augustine, he most largely, playnly, and effectually approueth it, specially in hys secōd booke and. iiii. chapiter, Contra literas 
                              〈◊◊〉
                           . And in hys xv. booke and. xxvi. Chapiter, De Trinitate. And so doeth Euse bius in hys. vi. boke, and. xliii chapter,

                        CONCERNINGE the latter wryters, in asmuch as they be innumerable, and vniformely do agre here vpon. I wyll not rehearse them at all, but by them, a greynge with the auncient and holye fathers of the churche, ye maye vndoutedlye see and perceaue, that thys sacrament of confirmation, or imposition of the Byshopes handes, is receaued, approued, and specyallye commended of all Catholique menne, and at al tymes.
                     Seyng then that thys Sacrament of Confyrmation, for many considerations is so gretly to be estemed and regarded, not onelye for the aucthoritie

of Chryste, that dyd institute it, and the aucthoritie of the churche and of the Apostles that dydde re ceaue and vse it, but also for the commoditie and profyt which the sayde Sacrament dothe brynge wyth it. Therefore they doo verye wyckedlye, that in anye wyse doo contempne it. And those maye be sene, and iudged to contempne it, whiche eyther do rayle at it or ells hauyng oportunitie to haue it ministred, do re fuse it, or wyllyngly neglecte it.
                     And the formall wordes vsed in Confyrmatyon, (whiche in olde tyme was called Impositio manuum) are these. Signo te signo crucis, & confirmo te 
                              〈◊〉
                            salutis, in nomine patris, & filij, & spiritus sancti. That is to saye. I sygne, or marke the with the sygne of the Crosse, and confirme the with the chrysme or oyntement of helth. In the name of the father, of ye sonne, and of the holy Ghost. And of this imposition of handes, we haue (besydes manye other places expressed in scrypture) a notable example in the. x. of saynte Marke, practised and vsed by Chryst hymselfe. And this Sacrament of Confirmation, or layinge of the byshops handes, was instituted ordeined, and vsed in the catholyke Churche, to remedye the weakenes that ryseth of the fome or rage of concupyscence, which weakenes remayneth in vs for oure exercyse, and is of two sortes, that is to say, inwarde and outwarde. The inwarde, is a certayne shamefastnes, or timerousnes, whereby we do not boldely confesse the name of Chryst, as Chryst requyreth of vs, sayinge in the tenth Chapter of Saynt Mathewe. Omnis qui

                            meo qui in coelis est. That is to saye. Euery one that wyll confesse me before men I wyll also acknowledge him before my father which is in heauen. And who wyll denye me before men, I wyl also denye him before my father which is in heauen. This inwarde shamefastnes rysynge withoute fayle of the inwarde weakenes, is taken awaye by confyrmation, wher in the forehead is made the sygne of the crosse, in whiche place is dysclosed our feare, and shame, in asmuche as we striken with feare, do waxe pale, and beyng ashamed, we do blushe and waxe redde. Wherfore he that is baptised, is afterwardes armed in confyrmation, with the sygne of the crosse, to the intente he may therby remē ber that he shal ouercum by vertne thereof, al maner his enemies, as before hym dyd his cheife capytayne Iesus Chryst, vnder whose 
                           〈◊〉
                        , he is now becom to be a souldiour, and lykewyse therby boldened and assured that as the distroyinge aungell, dyd forbeare and passe by those houses in Egypte, whose dore postes, and lyntell, he dydde see to be enointed with the bloude of the lambe, so the wicked spirite beholdynge the person baptised, and confyrmed wyth the tryumphante sygne of the crosse is discoraged to make anye hote assault agaynst hym.
                     And the other weakenes whyche is outewarde, is a certayne instablenes or 
                           〈◊〉
                        , to stand and abyde earnestlye, bothe in wordes and dedes, before

all persones, and estates, to the defense and mayntenaunce of the Chrystyan relygion and faythe, to the best of his power, that the saying of S. Paule in his epistle to the Romains, the tenth chapter, may be ve refied in hym, Where is sayde: Corde creditur ad adiustitiam ore autem confessio fit ad salutem. That is to saye: Beleyfe with hart, is to iustice, but confessiō is made by the mouth to saluation.
                     And this outewarde weakenes, is also expelled in confyrmation, by the Chrisme of health, which maketh the person ennointed, to be in courage, and boldenes, hauing therin the ayde and assistence of the holye Ghost: agaynste all maner of enemies bodely or ghostlye.

                        HAVINGE nowe spoken of the Sacra ment of Baptisme, wherby alsynnes orygynall and actuall, are remytted and forgyuen: And hauinge also spo ken of the Sacrament of Confyrmation, whereby the partye so baptyzed and confyrmed is made able to resyste and abyde, yea and to ouercome the assaultes of all his enemyes. It shall nowe be conueniente (Forasmuche as man hauynge all these greate helpes, and remedyes at Goddes handes dothe for all that manye tymes, by hys owne faulte, fall into synne, and then can neyther by baptysme, nor Confyrmation be pourged, or quytte hereof, but must nedes in that case haue the benefytte and helpe of Penaunce, whyche as S Hierome sayeth, is after shypewracke the seconde table or planke, to be holpen and socored by) that consequentlye, and kepynge the due promysed order, we do speake heare next of penaunce. For as it is necessarye for the bodye whan it hath surfyted and lost hys prystyne helthe, to haue physicke to restore the same agayne: so necessary it is for the soule, when by synne it is spotted or defyled, to be made cleane and bewtyfyed a freshe by penaunce. For an entrye vnto whyche matter of Penaunce and for the more clere vnderstandynge therof ye shall note. ii. thynges, the fyrste is how this worde Penaunce is here to be taken.
                     
                        THE seconde is, what is properlye mente by the

                        
                           〈◊〉
                         of Penaunce. And as concernynge the fyrste ye shall note that this worde Penaunce, as it is here in this treatise to be taken, doth signysye an inward sorowe, and greife of the harte for the sinnes 
                           〈◊〉
                         vs done and committed, and an hatred and detestation of the same, wyth an earneste desyre to be purged and ridde from them, and finallye to recouer and gette agayne the grace and fauoure of GOD, by such meanes and remedies, as God hath appoynted for the obteynyng thereof, with a stedefast purpose & mynde neuer to offende agayne. For withoute suche purpose and mynde, he that sayeth he is sorye for hys offences committed agaynste the hyghe maiestye of GOD, and yet still contynueth or intendeth to contynue in the same, is no penitent, but a 
                           〈◊◊◊〉
                         a deryder of Penaunce. And in this sorte & after this acception Penaunce is commonly taken, aswell in the new as in the old Testament. And this sort or kynde of Penaunce is so necessary for manes saluation, that without it no man that offendeth GOD, can be saued or attayne vnto euerlasting life. And as tou chyng the second thinge it is to witte, what is mente by The Sacrament of Penaunce, 
                           〈◊〉
                         shall vnderstand, that it is properly the absolution pronoūced by the preist vpon such as be penitent for their sinnes and so do acknowledge and confesse them selues to be. For the obteyninge of whiche absolution or sacramente of Penaunce, there are required, iii. seuerall thynges, it is to witte Contrition: Confessyon, and sa tisfaction, as beyng wayes, and meanes moste expedient and necessarye to obteine the saide absolutyon.

And here to begyn with Contrition, whiche is the firste parte to perfecte penaunce, ye shall learne that it is a sorowe willingly taken for our synnes, wyth a purpose and intent, to confesse them, and to satysfye for them, and neuer to commytte them agayne, with out which contrition it wyll not be that anye person can be truly and perfectlye penitent, or yet haue hope of remyssyon or forgyuenesse of hys synnes, nor yet oughte the preiste to absolue anye that wanteth thys contrition.
                     Wherefore necessary and expediente it is for the synner, wyllinge to haue absolution of his synnes, to consyder these thynges folowing. First to haue a contynuall remembraunce of hys synnes. Esaye, 38. and Psaline. 37. Seconde to consyder the vylenes of the synnes, and to haue therevpon a shame in hymselfe to haue committed them.

Accordyng aswell to the counsayl of Saynt James (Jacobi. 5) as also to thex ample of them that were conuerted at Ephesus, who beleuynge dyd come, confessyng and shewynge ther actes and dedes.

And because here we doo touche and speake of confession, which is the seconde thynge towardes parfytte Penaunce, ye shall therefore knowe, that albeit, thys worde Confessyon both in scrypture and in prophane authors doth sygnifye many thynges and in dyuerse sortes, yet Confession (as it is heare to be accepted and taken) is a voluntarye, lawfull, and sufficient declaratyon, or vt teryng of synne, to be made vnto the pryeste hauynge sufficyent aucthoritye to geue absolution therin. And when I do saye Adeclaration or vtteryng: I do vse the same to exclude mentall confessyon, whyche though it may and ought at all tymes to be made vn to God, yet that is not that sacramentall confessyon of which we heare speake. And when I do saye Uo

Uoluntarye, I do put in that to declare that lyke as wyllyngly the synne is committed, so also willingly and without compulsion the confession ought to be made. And when I do say, Lawefull and sufficient. I do put in that, to declare yt it is not I noughe to make a bare or naked confession not carynge how or after what sorte it be made, but to make it in suche wise that it may be lawefull and sufficiente, That is to say, after dewe deliberation and consultation for sene and had, to so order the same, that it may be done as is comprehended in these verses folowyng.

that we endeuor not our selues that it may be dulye applied vnto vs. For such is the mercy of CHRIST that he woulde haue all to be sauede, and therefore when he approched nigh vnto the citie of Hierusalem and sawe the great enormities and wickednes therof he wepte vpon it and sayde.

Let vs not be werye of well doinge, for in the conuenyente tyme we shall reape withoute ceassynge or wearynes. Therefore while we haue tyme, let vs do good vnto all folkes and specyallye vnto them which are of the houshold of faith. So that by all these scryptures it doth most euidēlye appeare, that besydes the passion of Christe, there is some what also required of vs: soo that we may not laye all the burden on Chrystes backe, thoughe he be able to beare it, but we must take parte of the burden our selues, and laye it also vpon our owne neckes to, as wherby we may be partakers and accepted to enioye that thing, which of Chrystes parte is fullye purchased all readye. The second thing most nedeful also here to be declared vnto you is, that although ye gylte

of synne, be in this sacrament of Penaunce throughe the bountifulnes of CHRIST, cleane taken awaye, yet by the iustyce of GOD there remaynethe a temporall payne. An example whereof we haue in the. ii. booke of the kinges in the. xii. chapiter (where not withstandinge that Nathan, the messenger, and prophete of GOD had declared to Dauyd, that hys synnes were forgeuen hym, yet for all that, temporall punshemente was inflicted. And so lykewyse Exodi. 22. & Numeri 14. Besides these, we haue an other euidente example in oure owne selues, for albeit all synnes originall and actuall be in our baptisme remitted vnto vs, as hathe bene before in the Sacrament of Baptysme declared vnto you: yet the paynes doo remayne whyche are inflicted by God hymselfe for originall synne, as all the incommodities we haue therefore in our bodye, and deathe also of the same, as appearethe Genesis tertio. And though this thyng thus playnely declared maye seme to suffyce for the full instruction of the ignorante in thys sayde Sacramente Penaunce, or in the partes thereof, or at all, yet if anye shalbe desyrous vpon promyse made before to haue further testimonyes of Scrypture and of the fathers, they shall here folowe orderlye.
                     And fyrst as concernynge penaunce in gerneall, we rede in the. xviii. of Ezechiel thus. Si autem impius egerit poenitentiam, ab omnibus peccatis suis quae operatus est, & custodierit pre

and kepe my commaundementes, and doe iudgement and iustice, he shall liue wyth lyfe and shall not dye. And in the. xi. chapyter of Sapience, is wrytten. Misereris omnium quia omnia potes, & dissimulas peccata hominum propter poenitentiam. That is to saye, Thou Lorde haue mercye vpon all, for thou canste doe all thynges, and doest make as thoughe thou dyddest not see theyr sinnes, for penaūce sake. And in the, viii, of the actes, Symon Magus goyng aboute, and thynkyng that he myghte bye the holy ghost for money, was by S. Peter rebuked therfore, and also after that was counsayled, or rather commaunded thus. Penitentiam age ab haec nequitia tua, & rogae deum, si forte remittatur tibi haec cogitatio cordis tui. That is to say. Do penaunce from this thy wickednes, and pray to God, yf peraduenture thys thoughte of thy harte maie be forgeuen thee. And farther in the seconde of the Apocal. the churche of Ephesus is admonyshed and prouoked vnto penaunce after thys maner. Memoristo, unde exideris, & age poenitentiam: & prima opera fac, sin autem uenio tibi cito & mouebo candelabrum tuum de loco suo, nisi poenitentiam egeris. Whych is to saye. Remember from whence thou hast fallen, and do penaunce, and doo thy firste workes, but yf not I come vnto the quickelie, and will remoue thy candelsticke from his place, vnlesse thou do penaunce.
                     
                        Of thys penaunce you may fyude other testymo nyes in the holy Scriptures, as Ecclesia, ii, Mat, iii, Luke, xiii. xv, xvii, Rom. ii, ii, Pet, iii, Apoca, ix. &c.
                     And as touchynge contrition, whyche is the seconde thynge here consydered, what more maye be sayde therein, then that whyche the holye Gost spake by Dauydes mouth (Psal, xxxi.) sayeng. Dixit confitebor ad uersum me iniustitiam me ā domino, & tu remisisti impietatem 
                              〈◊〉
                           
                         That is to say. I did purpose with my selfe and sayde: I will confesse vnto God myne vnrightfulnes agaynst my selfe and thou haste forgeuen the wickednes of my sinne. Accordyng to which sense the selfe same Dauyd (crauynge the

                            contritum & humiliatum deus non despicies That is to saye. A contrite and an humble hearte (thou God) wilte not dispise. Moreouer Achab, althoughe he was neuer so euyl a man, yet hauyng remorse of cōscience for his euyl dedes, and humblyng hym selfe wyth a contrite heart he dyd heare these wordes of Goddes mouthe, spoken vnto the Prophete Esaye. Nonne uidisti humilitatem Achab coram me? quia igitur humiliatus est coram me, non inducam malum in 
                              〈◊〉

                           . 3. Reg. 21. That is to say. Hast thou not sene Achab humbled before me? Therefore bycause he is thus humbled or contryte before me I wyll not bring this plage or euyll in his dayes, but in the dayes of his Sonne I wyl bringe mischiefe vpon hys house, or famylie.
                     
                        Of thys contrition and sincere sorowfulnes of hart a great number of places are in the holye scryytures and amongest the rest, ye may consider, the, ii, cor, vii. Pal. vi, xxxvii. cxviii, Iohel, ii. Math, v. &c.

And as for that place of the. xvi. of Saynte Mathewe, where the power of the keyes, is promysed to be geuen vnto preistes and mynisters to absolue and forgyue synnes and also for the place in the. xx. of Jhon, where Chryst after his resurrection breathinge vpon his dyscyples, and perfourmyng hys promyse dyd saye.

you withholde, they are with holden. These places I saye are so euydente, that no man can with any learnyng, or christen conscience, withstand or depraue them, but they must be most vay leable for this present purpose.

                     You adders broode, who hath geuen you warning to fly from the wrath of GOD to come, Do ye therefore ye worthy fruites of penaunce. Upon which place S. Chrysostome sayeth thus. We shall do the worthy fruites of penāce yf we do thinges contrarye to the faultes before committed, as if thou hast taken awaye other mens goodes, restore them, and begyn nowe to gyue thine owne, if thou haste bene a long time and aduouterer, suspend thy selfe from thine owne, and from the lawefull vse of matrimonie, and for a time bynde thy selfe to chastitie, if thou hast hurt thine neighbour either by worde or dede, make him a sufficiēt amendes, and speake wel by him, for it is not sufficient for a man that is wounded to pull out the darke out of his body, but he must also get medicines to heale the wounde.

And because that they all in effecte doo agree together, one here alone shall be alledged for them all, and that is the holye Martyr Cypryan who in his. v, sermon entytuled, de lapsis, sayth thus.

a generall lesson of all men easelye to be borne awaye in these wordes. Confiteantur singuli quaeso uos sratres delictum suum, dum adhuc qui deliquit in seculo est dum

In which two breyfe sentences of this mooste excellent and famous Martyr, ye do se comprised and conteyned, the hole and penitente conuersation of man to God, by contrition, Confession & satisfactyon, (which thre poyntes or partes must of necessitie be in the doer of true Penaunce, & so it is required of the said penitent, as we before haue proued) And the sacrament of Penaunce it selfe, being the absolution pronoū ced by the preist vpō such true penitentes in ye said sētēce of.

And in dede ryght conuenient &

mete it shalbe to entreate diligently and fully of thys sacrament, in asmuche as it bothe in worthynes, and dignifie, doeth greatly surmounte and passe al the other Sacramentes of the Churche, as also for that of late yeres it hath most of all other, bene assaulted, and impugned, and yet of no good manne, but of the wretched sort alone.
                     And to begyn, thys order, in some respecte, maye herein be thought conuenient: fyrst to declare the institution of thys sacrament. Seconde to set forth the vse of it.
                     And thyrdely, to declare the notable, or rather the vnspeakeable fruyte thereof.

Take and eate, thys is my Bodye whyche shalbe geuen, or deliuered for you. Lykewyse, He toke the cuppe, and gaue thankes, & gaue it vnto them saying: Drinke ye al of this for thys is my bloude of the newe testamente, whiche shalbe shed for many to the remission of theyr synnes Do this in the remembrance of me. These wordes, being spokē by ye mouthe of the

sonne of Gob, who is equall in Godheade wyth the father and the holye ghoste, and testifyed also by hys holye Euaugelistes, ouer and besydes the faythefull continual testimonye of Chrystes espouse, the Catholyke church, who is he that can with any good grūd of Scripture or lawefull aucthoritie saye, but that whyche Chryste gaue to hys Apostles, at the maundye, was Christes very bodye and bloude, yea that selfe same bodye and bloude whych was geuen and shed vpon the crosse, the next day for them and al mā

The veritie of whych Article, the Catholyke Churche, being ruled and gouerned by the holy ghost hath alwayes most constātly beleued, and taughte, declaring that in this sacrament of the Aultar there is, by the omnipotencye of God, and the vertue and force of hys word, the very body and bloude of oure Sauiour Christ, reallye, truelye, substantiallye, and in dede.

                            nonest? Contingat plane his, uerum nonesse, qui CHRISSVMIESVM uerum esse deum negat. That is to saye Of the veritie of the fleshe and bloude (speakyng of the flesh & bloud of Christ in thys sacrament) ther is not left a place to dout For now both by the professiō or declaration of our Lord, & by our faithe also, there is truelye fleshe, and there is truely bloude, which being receaued or taken & dronken, do cause or make thys, that bothe we are in Christe, and Christ also in vs. And whether is not thys the trueth? let it chaunce not to be true vnto them who doo denye Iesus Christ to be true God.
                     By al these most euident testimonyes af auncient fathers, it appeareth, that in the Sacramente of the Aultare are truelye and reallye conteyned the bodye and bloude of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, accordyng to the sayde institution of Christe. But because Christ toke breade into his handes, and Saynct Paule also calleth the sacrament bread, and that therevpon the heretikes haue groūded their opiniō that the thynge conteyned in the said sacrament is nothing but bread it shalbe meete to open and declare thys matter forther, and in what sort the Sacrament may be called bread: for the vnderstanding wherof you must know that albe it our Sauiour Christe toke very materiall breade into hys handes, yet by hys omnipotente power

he chaunged the nature and substaunce of bread, into the substaunce of hys dody. And lykewyse he chaunged the substaunce of wyne into the substāce of hys bloude, sayenge: Thys is my bodie, Thys is my bloude.
                     And thys is euidentlye proued fyrste by the. vi. of Iohn, where oure Sauioure Christe hymselfe thus sayeth. The bread that I wyll geue vnto you is my fleshe, which flesh I wyll geue for the lyfe of the worlde. In whyche wordes it is moste manyfest that Christ promysed two thynges: the one that he woulde geue a bread that should be his fleshe, and the other is, that he wold geue that fleshe for the lyfe of the worlde: Nowe yf Chryste gaue not at hys maundye a breade that was hys fleshe, and on good Fryday gaue the fleshe vpon the crosse for the lyfe of the worlde, then he kepte not hys promyse, for in no place els he dyd it, therefore, eyther must we say that Christ made a promisse and perfourmed it not (which is a wicked thynge to thynke or saye of Christe) eyther els must we say that keping hys promysse, he did at hys maundy geue a kynde of breade, whiche was his verye fleshe in dede conteyned vnder the forme of breade, and that the same fleshe he gaue the daye folowynge vnder the vysyble forme of fleshe vpon the crosse: & so he perfourmed both his promysses, that is to say geuyng a breade or 
                           〈◊〉
                         that was his fleshe, & also geuyng that fleshe for the lyfe of the worlde. And for a more playne & full declaratyon of Chrystes wordes herein, ye shall note, that in the sayde syxte

of Sayncte Iohn, there is mentyon made of fowre kyndes of breade.
                     Fyrst of the breade wherewith he myraculouslye sed fyue thousande in the wildernes, whiche was in dede very material breade and made of Barleye.
                     Secondly there is mention made of a bread called Manna, whiche was a kynde of fode that God sent from aboue, to the children of Israell, when they in the wildernes dyd trauayle towarde the lande of promyse, whyth thoughe it be there called breade, yet breade in dede made of any kynde of grayne or corne it was not.
                     Thyrdly there is mention made of bread, whyche is the seconde persone in Trinitie, that is to saye, the sonne of God sent downe by hys father from heauen hither into earth to be incarnate.
                     Fourthlye there is mention made of breade that oure Sauioure Christe promysed to geue, whych is his fleshe, and the selfe same in substaunce which suffe red for vs vpon the crosse, and yet there called breade thoughe in dede no materiall breade in substaunce. and as for the callynge of it breade it is not materyal, for the godhead of Christ, and also manna, in the sayd chapiter are called breade, and yet no breade in substaunce. And here is not to bee omitted that where our Sauioure Christe speaketh of the foresayd foure kyndes of breade he doeth not speake of them all 
                           〈◊〉
                         one fashion, for touchynge the fyrste saythe, that he hymselfe a lytel before had geuen that breade vnto the people, and touchyng the seconde the Iewes dyd

boaste that it was geuen by Moyses to theyr forefathers in wildernes, Lykewyse concernyng ye thyrd Chryst doth affyrme that it was at that presente sente from the father of Heauen downe to the Earth. But touchyng the fourthe, he sayd that it shoulde be of his owne gyuing vuto them, and that in tyme to come, yea and ferther that the same 
                           〈◊〉
                         be his fleshe, and least any man myght mystake this his saying, in such spirituall or mysticall sense, as thereby to exclude the very substaunce of his feshe and bodye, he addeth (to take awaye all doute and cauillation) that it shoulde be the same fleshe whiche shoulde be geuen for the lyfe of the worlde, as apeareth before. And hereby maye you learne that by this, worde breade mencyoned in the. vi. chapiter of Saint Ihon, & as it is here taken in this fourthe acception, and in the other two nexte goynge before, oure Sauioure Chryste dothe meane nothyng elles but a fode, and a fode may it be though there be no substaunce of materiall breade at all.
                     After which sort is the worde breade to be vnderstanded in the tenthe and eleuenthe chapiters of the firste epystle of Saynte Paule to the Corynthyans: where dyuerse tymes also he vsethe thys worde Panis, which ought to be Englyshed foode.
                     And that in verye dede there is not the substaunce of materiall breade remainynge in the sacramente of the Aultar, ye shall besyde those thynges whyche you haue hard all redy out of the scripture hear also oute of the aunciēt and catholike fathers, who do witnes as foloweth. Fyrst Chrysostome in his sermon made in

which is to saye: Howe greate then, and howe notable benefites the force and vertue of the diuin benedictiō doth worke, or bringe to passe, do thou consider, & to the in no wyse it ought to seme new or impossible, that into the substannce of Christe, earthly and mortal thinges are chaunged.
                     And with these two anncient and notable fathers of the greke churche, the blessed martyr Cypryā doth agre, saying in his sermon. De coena Domini in thys maner Panis istequem dominus discipulis porrigebat, non effigit sed natura mutatus, omnipotentia uerbi sact us est caro. That is to saye. That same breade or foode whych oure Lorde reached or gaue to hys dysciples beynge chaunged not in fourme or shape, but in nature, was by the omnipotencye of the word made fleshe.
                     And bycause Chryste hym felfe (who then dyd in the foresayd maner institute this Sacramente) dyd also at the same tyme appoynt and commaunde, bothe his Apostles, and in thē theyr successoures, to do the same which he himselfe then and there dyd sayinge, Luc. xxii. Hoc faciat in

                            commemorationcm. That is to say: Do you this in my remembraunce.

thankes, doth duely pronounce the wordes of Christe, sayinge. Thys is my body, and takinge the cuppe, and geuynge thankes, doth lyke wyse duly say the wordes of Chryste, Thys is my

                         of the newe testamente, so oft the substaūce of bread and wyne, by the wyll and power of Chryst, so commaundyng and aucthorisynge the saide minister, is turned into Chrystes very reall and naturall body 
                           〈◊〉
                         bloude: and the sayd body and bloude is there so present vnder the fourmes of bread and wyne. For it is not the visible preist, thatnowe worketh thys hyghe mysterye, by his owne power or strengthe, but it is Christ hym selfe, the inuysible preist, that dothe worke it by the misterye of the vysyble preist. Lykewyse as Chryst it is, and not the preiste, that geueth vertue in Baptysme, though the 
                           〈◊〉
                         of the preist, both in Baptisme and also here in the Sacrament of the aul tar be requyred, and that by the speciall appoyntinge and ordeynynge of Chryst, the same so to be.
                     And here do you note, that the aforesaide working of Chryst, and ministerye of the preist, here touchynge the Sacramēt of the aulter, is, and hath alwayes in the catholyke churche bene called Consecration.

                     To these before rehearsed testimonyes we maye adioyne two other testymonyes of Saynte Chrysostome, whereof the one is in hys. 83, Homelye vpon Saynte Mathe we where he wryteth in thys maner. Non sunt humane uirtutis haec opera: quae tunc in illa coena

                         of Chryste once in dede was spoken, and yet it, throughe out all the tables of the

                        , euen vntyll this daye, and vntyll hys commyng (meaning of Chrystes last comming) doth geue strength vn to the sacrifice. And thus much haue we spoken to declare vnto you bothe by the scriptures, and also by moste aunciente and playne aucthorities, that oure Sauioure Chryst in the institution of thys Sacrament, dyd tourne the substaunce of breade and wyne into the substaunce of hys owne bodye and bloude, & howe also he doeth the same daylye, by the mynysterye of the preistes in consecratiō. And now to come to the seconde part, whiche is concernyng the vse of this sacramēt, ye shall note that this vse doth cōsist speciallye in two poyntes. It is to witte, in the oblation or offeringe of the said sacrament by the preistes vnto al myghtye God, and in the 
                           〈◊〉
                         of the same. And here before we do entre any further, it semeth mooste conuenient to note vnto you one synguler priuiledge (emonge many other) where in thys 
                           〈◊〉
                        , passeth all other, and that is thys, where all other sacramentes do consist onely in the vse of them, that is to saye, in the very acte of ministration and receauynge of them, thys sacramente hath his perfection oute of hand euen as sone as the wordes of Chryst in the con secration be pronounced, 
                           〈◊〉
                         the sacramente be

offered nor receued, according as it is here before proued. And as touchyng the offering therof (commonly called the sacrifice of the masse) ye shall vnderstand that no one poynt of Christes relygion was more notably prophesied of, & set forthe in the olde testamente and before the commyng of Christ, then was the continuall oblation, that is to saye, this fore sayde sacryfice of the Masse: for the prophette Malachye in hys fyrste chapyter (speakynge in the name of almyghtye GOD, and declaryng that in tyme to come, the sacryfices of the olde lawe should cease, and no more to be receaued or allowed at Goddes handes, but that there shoulde another kynde of sacrifyce be througheout the hole worlde offered vp vnto hym) doth wryte in this maner.

That is to saye. And in dede I wyll adde plain lye a meruelous thinge, and yet do you not wonder, nor be you troubled. But what is that, wyl you say? The sacred or holye oblation, whether Peter doth offer it or Paule, or of what soeuer meryte the preist be, it is the verye same thinge whiche Chryste hymselfe dydde gyue vnto his disciples, and the same whiche the preistes nowe doo make. Thys hathe no lesse then it: And whye soo 
                           〈◊〉
                         men doo not sanctifye this but Chryste who sanctified or consecrated that before. For like as the wordes whiche Chryst dyd speake be the selfe same whyche the preistes nowe also do pronounce, euen so the oblation or sacrifice is the same.
                     
                        AND nowe to come vnto the other vse it is to wytte, of the receauynge of the Sacramente, ye shall note, that althoughe oure Samoure Iesus Christe, at the first institution of this sacramente, dydde minister it vnto his disciples, whiche were than presente, vnder both the kyndes of bread and wyne, Yet that fashyon and maner of ministrynge is not soo necessarye to the receauer (excepte it be to the preist, whan he doth consecrate) that without the due obseruation of that waye, man myght not receaue that blessed sacramēt to his saluation. For the benefyte or hurte that commeth to a chrysten man, by receauynge of this sacramente,

standeth not in the fashyon or maner of receauynge of it, vnder one or both kyndes, but in the wor thyor vnworthy receauyng of the thynge conteyned in the same. For he that receaueth this Sacramente worthelye, vnder the one kynde, as vnder the forme of breade onely, receaueth the hole bodye and bloude of Chryst, and as many and great benefittes of Christ as he that receaueth it in both kyndes. And therefore if any man should teache, that the laye people (which by the ordinaunce and auncient custome of the catholyke churche, haue vsed to receaue this holy sacramēt in fourme of breade onelye) be seduced and soo cause them to thynke, that the holle bodye and bludde of Chryst, where not comprehended in that onely forme of breade, as well as in both the kyndes, this doctrine ought vtterlye to be refused and abiected, as a verye pestiferouse and deuely she doctryne. For surely scripture teacheth the contrary, and also naturall reason, althoughe it cannot comprehende the hole mistery of this sacrament, yet herein it teacheth vs agreablye wt scrypture, yt that liuely body cannot be without bloud and therefore men ought to be ledde from that fonde opinion (yf any such be) both by that faith, and credit which they do owe vnto scripture, and in this poynt also by naturall reason. And chrysten men knowinge this, ought not to grudge at thys fourme and maner of receauyng of this sacrament vnder one kynd, vsed and allowed by the catholyke church, both to auoide that erroure afore rehersed, and also for manye other weyghtie considerations, concernynge bothe the honor of the sacramēte, and the libertye, and commoditie

of the hole churche, seyng that not onely lay men, but also prestes (sauinge whan they do consecrate) do vse to receaue thys Sacrament none otherwyse Let chrysten men therfore humbly apply them self, to put all erronious fantasies cleane out of ther hartes, and satisfye them selues with this, that when they receiue the sacrament worthely, though it be but in one kind they loose no parte of the profyt and benefyte promysed by vertue of the sayde Sacramente. And yet to stably she this poynte (touchyng the receauing of this sacramente vnder one kynde) both with testimonies of scripture, and also otherwyse, ye shall vnderstand, that whan our sauyour Christ did delyuer this sacramente vnder bothe kyndes, in the institution thereof, he of purpose had onely his twelue Apostles with hym, to declare vnto vs that he there dyd rather prescribe vnto them being preistes, how they and theyr successours should consecrate, and offer, and also they themselues in theyr ministery receaue the same, than howe it shoulde be receaued of other, not beynge of the same vocation as the Apostles were of. And therfore it was neuer yet lawfull, but very straytely to be punyshed yf a prest whan he dyd consecrate, and offer the same, dyd not withall receaue it vnder bothe kyndes. Wherein appearethe (the cyrcumstaunces of the institution beynge well marked and consydered, that the cammaundement and charge geuen at that tyme by oure sauioure Iesus Christ, doth not of necessitie bynde the laye men, noo nor yet the preiste, (but when he sayeth masse) to receaue vnder both kin des. Therefore many tyme in Scrypture, mentyon

is made but of one kynde onely, as apperteynyng generally vnto all men, it is to wytte, of the sacramente to be receaued vnder the fourme of breade, wythoute any mention made of the other kynde or forme. As in the. vi. of Iohn, where our sauiour in a greate multytude of people, (besides hys apostles) makynge promes of thys sacramente to be geuen by hym, in tyme then yet to come, sayeth. Panis quem ego labo caro mea est, 
                              〈◊〉
                            dabo pro mundi uita That is to say. The breade whiche I wil geue is my fleshe, whiche 
                           〈◊〉
                         I wyll geue for the lyfe of the worlde-Saynte Luke al so in hys. xxiii. chapter of hys gospel, telleth how that our sauiour Christ after his resurrection, dyd appeare in a straunge forme or shape, to two of hys dyscyples goinge towarde Emaus, and when he hade a good whyle walked and talked wyth them, and yet they knew him not, at length they came to Emaus, wher Christ syttyng with them, toke bread, blessed it, and brake it, and gaue it vnto them, and by and by theyr eyes were opened, and they knewe hym, and he vani shed out of theyr sight. Thys bread so geuē in Emaus to the two disciples, S. Augustine in his thyrd boke, Deconsensu euangelistarum And saynte Chrisostome in hys xvii. homilye vpon Mathewe, and Theophilus also, auncienter then any of them both, do expounde to be the Sacramente of Christes bodye? and yet ther the scripture (as in sundrye other places els) doeth make no mentiō of the other kinde or forme, (it is to wyt, of the Sacramente vnder the fourme of wyne) to haue bene geuen vnto them.
                     
                        To this consideration appertayneth also, the wonderfull fedinge of the chyldren of Israell, in wyldernes, the space of. xl. yeares, wyth a straunge breade called Manna, being a figure of this sacrament, as it belongethe to all chrysten people, who throughe the huge wildernes of this worlde do passe towarde the true land of promyse. And yet farther to confyrme thys thyng by an auncient and weightye testimonie ye shall here what is recorded by the excellente Author Nicephorus Calistus, who beynge aboute a thousande yere ago, in his worke called Ecclesiastica histo ria in the. xiii. boke and in the seuenth chapiter thereof (wrytynge of a certayne woman, who obstynate lye longe tyme refused to receaue the catholyke rytes, of Chrystes Churche, and so obstinately, that although hyr husband moste ernestlye labored with her in that matter, and dyuerse tymes sore dyd fall out wyth her yea and threatned her ferther displesure, yf she would not vniformely receaue the chrysten relygyon and saramentes, yet in her harte she woulde not be persuaded, neuerthelesse at length dissemblyngly, she fained herselfe to be by hym herein persuaded, and therevpon entendyng by fraude to cloke her doynges and to perfourme more easely her purpose, she made one of her maydes (whome she trusted verye well pryueye of her entent and purpose) he thus wryteth.

That is to saye: This wo man (after that she by dissimulatiō had graū ted, or agreed) did vnto one of her handmaydens (whome she thought to be faithfull vnto her) tell or shewe what she intended to do: to the intente that by fraude she myghte deceyue her husbande.

The Pyller and staye of truthe. do contente & satysiye vs well in thys behalfe. Hauyng nowe spoken of the institution of thys sacrament, and also of the vse therof, consequently there remayneth (accordynge to the promysed order) to speake of the thyrde and last part, whiche is of the inessimable fruite procedynge of the ryght vse of the sayde sacrament. And because the vse is (as we haue sufficientlye here before proued) in two fortes, it is to wytte in offerynge and in receyuyng

thereof, it shall therefore be expediente seuerally to entreate of the specyall fruite of them bothe. And fyrst touchyng the fruite of the sacrifyce of the masse, we must vnderstand, that

                         ye sacrifice which was made vpō the crosse, & the sacrifyce of the masse, as concernynge the substaunce of the thynge offered, there is no difference, for as muche as in that respecte, it is one and the same, though the maner of offerynge be diuerse, as hath bene shewed and proued heretofore vnto you. For in the sacrifyce made vppon the Crosse, there was the visible sorme and shape of Christes bodye beynge man, yea and the visible fleshe and

                         but herein this sacrament the same fleshe and bloude of Chryst being truely in substaunce, is set

                         not in the natiue formes of fleshe and bloude, but vnder the formes of breade and wyne. And therefore emongest the most aunciente fathers, beynge of the Greke churche, & also of the Latyn. The one sacrifyce (made vpon the crosse, is called a bloudy sacryfyce, because vi sibly, there, out of the syde of Chryst bloude was shed. And the other (whyche by the Preiste is offered at masse vpon the Aultare) is named. Incruentum sacraficium, that is to saye: A sacrifice vnbloudye or wythout bloudshedynge. not because there is no 
                           〈◊〉
                         there, but because there is no visible effusion

                         bloud beynge there neuerthelesse in substaunce (as we at large before haue proued) both the fleshe and bloude, of Christe.

                         of the very sacrifice, the persōs departed, are in their peculier place remembred & mētioned also to be made, that the sacrifyce is offered for them.

And when the workes of mercy are done for the departed, they thereby to be commended or betaken to the mercye of God who canne doute those workes to releiue them for whō prayer is not vaynelye alleged or made, it is not to be douted at all these thynges to profyte or auayle the deade, and yet but to suche who so haue lyued before their deathe, that these thinges maye be profytable vnto them after their departure or death. &c.

That is to saye. And it is not to be denyed that the soules of the deade, through the deuotyon of theyr frendes beinge yet aliue, are relieued or eased, whan as for them, eyther the sacrysyce of oure mediatoure is offered vppe, or almes is geuen in the churche. But these thynges are auayleable to suche, as in theyr lyfe tyme, dyd deserue. that the same myghte doo them good. For there is a certen maner of life and conuersation, neyther so good or perfytte that it requireth or nedeth not these thynges after death, nor yet so badde, that after the departinge out of this 
                           〈◊〉
                         lyfe, it maye not thereby haue profytte and commoditie. But there is suche state of life in the good man that it requireth not such thinges And again in the extreme wicked man, suche as the state of his lyfe, that whan he goeth oute of thys world he can not by anye deuotion of the lyuinge be holpen. Wherefore here in. thys lyfe, all deserte or merite is purchased. Wherebye a man after thys lyfe maye either be relyeued or greued. And let no man hope, that he can after his decease, obteine of God that thynge, which he here hath neglected. And therefore these suffrages which the churche dothe vse

or frequent for the deade to be receaued into more fauor or mercy with god, are nothynge contrary to that saying of the Apostle saynte Paule, where he sayeth: For all we shal stand before the iudgement seate of Chryst that eue ry oue of vs may receaue, (accordynge to the dedes which he him selfe heare in bodye dyd.) eyther good or euyll. Because euerye manne whyle he liued in the bodye, dyd procure to him selfe this merite also (it is to wytte) that these suffrages may be profitable vnto hym. For vndoutedly these thinges are not auailable to al men, and whye is that? But by reason of the difference in the life and conuersation of eueryche man, whiche he dyd vse while he here liued on the earthe, wherefore, when the sacrifices either of the aultar or of any maner of almes, are offered for all Chrysten soules departed, the sayde sacrifices for very good mē departed, are thankes geuings and for suche as deceased, beinge not verie euill, they are propritiations, and finallie, for the wicked or verye euill, thoughe they are no helpes to them, being deade, yet they are to them which are aliue, some kinde of comfortes.
                     
                        And nowe forasmuch as we haue thus fully & plainly by sufficient aucthorities declared, that the sacryfyce of the masse, or (as saynt Augustyne. in his foresayde proces doth call it) the sacrifyce of the Aultare, is a uayleable for the deade, no man oughte or can doute but that the same is also auayleable to men yet liuing which with fayth and deuotion moste humblye praye almyghty god especiaily in the tyme of thys sacrifyce to applye vnto them by Chryste, that remission and

Ye shall secondly also cal to your remembraunce the place of Saynte Paule in hys fyrst epystle to Tymothie, and the seconde chapyter

That is to saye. For al men, for Kynges, for all whyche are in hyghe aucthoritie, to the intente that we maye leade a quyet and peaseable lyfe, in all godlynes and honestye. And accordyng herevnto Saynt Basyll (be yng aboue an eleuen hundred yeare ago) in his masse setteth fourth (as vsed in the Churche at hys tyme) thys prayer folowing Da domine ut pro nostris

                        FORASMVCHE as oure promysed order doth now requyre that we should next speke of the sayde sacramente of Orders, fyrste of all touchyng the said sacramente, thys is to be noted, that thoughe sometymes in scrypture in some respecte all chrysten men and women are called preistes, for that they ought and muste contynuallye offer to almyghtye God the spirituall sacrifyces of fayth prayer and other godly vertues (whiche kynde of preisthode Saynt Peter speaketh of, in the seconde chapiter of his firste epystle, and Saynte Jhon lyke wyse in the, xvi. chapiter of the Apocalipse) yet is ther

And of thys special kynde of priest hode, Saynte Paule in his firste chapiter of hys Epystle to the Nebrues dyth speake saying. Nec quisdam

And secondlye in the. xx. of Jhon (appoyntynge to hys apostles thys specyal office or ministration, and authorisynge them in the same) he also sayeth.

                     The geuyng of this speciall auchoritie of ministra tion and priesthode by the byshoppe, vnto suche persons as by due examination shalbe thoughte mete for that bocation, is called here the sacrament of orders: and hath alwayes so bene called, taken, and reputed from the begynnynge of christen religion vnto thys day, as appeareth most euydently by saint Augustine who in hys seconde boke. Contra epistolam parmeniani, & the xiii. chap. thereof, doeth often times cal it by the name of a sacramente: and ioyntlye speakyng of it, and of the sacramente of baptisme, affyrmeth that bothe of them are geuen by a certayne sanctification, and that neyther of them can be iterated or agayne taken, sayinge thus

                        . Augustyne in the foresayde place sayeth that thys sacrament of orders is ge uen with a certayne sanctification, no better or playner profe thereof can be had, than out of the very scrip ture, as in the. xx, of Sainete Jhon, where our sauyour Chryst after his resurrection geuyng vnto hys apostles auethoritie to release or retayne synnes, dyd saye vnto them in thys maner. Accipite spiritum sanctum, quorum remiseritis peccata remittuntur eis, et quorum retinueritis

                            eataretenta sunt. That is to saye. Receiue ye the holie Ghoste, whose sinnes ye remitte, they are remitted are forgeuen them, and whose sinnes you reteyne are reteined. To thys purpose apperteyneth also that sayinge of S. Paule in his fyrst Epystle to Tymothe, and the, iiii, Chapter, where he sayeth thus, Noli negligere gratiam queinte est, que data est tibi per prophetiam cum imposuione manuum praesbiterij. That is to saye. Neglecte not the grace that is in the whyche is geuē vnto the through prophesye with the imposition of handes of preisthode, And againe in the seconde epystle to Tymothie and the first chapter thereof, the sayd Saynt Paule doth saye thus. Admonco te ut resuscitis gratiam dei, quae est in te, per impositionem

in the difinition of a sacramente before geuen was requyred, it is to witte, a visible sygne (whyche is the imposition of the handes) and therewyth effectuallye concurraunt and annexed grace.
                     And for the better vnderstandyng of thys grate, ye shall marke that the same dothe consyste in three generall poyntes. The one to praye in the name of the hole churche, and for the hole Churche. An other to preache and teache the worde of GOD to all people The thyrde to minister the Sacramentes, where ye maye note that the preistes beynge amongeste other thynges called to the minystration of the sacraments and the chiefest and most pretiouse of all sacramentes being the sacrament of the Aulter, in mynystratyon whereof (as before in the exposition of the same sacrament, is sufficiently proued, the preist ought bothe to consecrate, and to offer. Therefore the late made mynysters in the tyme of the scysine, in theyr newe deuised ordination, hauynge no aucthoritie at all giuē thē to offer in the masse the body and bloude of oure

and also of the sacrifice of the masse, and of the inestimable fruyte which commeth thereby. Of whych thynges the truth at large and sufficiently in thexposition of the sacramēt of the Aultar is already taught and proued. And seinge that euerye man (be he neuer soo simple) maye sufficientlye hereby perceaue howe these late counterfeted ministers, haue in so weighty a matter deceyued the people, concernynge eternall saluation, and greatly abused them and brought thē into a most lamentable state, you may thereby consyder both what thankes you owe to almyghtye God who hath restored vnto you, the ryght vse of the Sacramentes agayne, and also howe muche you oughte to esteme the ryght

                     HAuyng hy therto obserued and kepte the ordre promysed in the preface of thys boke, entreatyng of Baptysme, Confirmation, Penaunce, and of the Sacrament of the Aultar, which all in theyr due consideration, are sacramentes of necessytye, hauynge also spoken of ye sacra ment of orders, whereby a spirituall multiplication of the churche, is induced, thoughe no man herein be inforsed or compelled but of his voluntarye electyon and choyse doth take and receiue it. This place now requyreth that we shal here entreate of the sacramēt of Matrimonye, whiche doth folowe next in order, whereby a carnall multiplication, very expedient in a common welth is induced. And this sacramente of Matrimony doeth differ a great deale both in matter and fourme, and also in diuerse respectes els frō the other before sayde, and specially it differeth from Baptysme, Confyrmation, Penaunce, and the sacrament of the Aultar, for that this Sacrament of Ma trimonye is not of that necessitie as they are, but is in the free wyll of the manne, and also of the woman whiche frely maye chuse to marye, or not to marye, and neither of them is compelled of precise necessitie to come vnto it, and beynge besydes in that estate, that wythout it they maye be saued.
                     And verye expedient it shalve, diligently to speake of thys sacrament of Matrymonye, aswell for that

                     And when I doe saye Lawefull I do speake that to exclude such coniūctions as are made betwixt mā and woman contrary or agaynst the oroer of ye lawe cōprehended in effect in these foure verses folowing.

                     And when I doe saye coniunction, I do put in that to declare that in this coniunction betwene the manne and the woman, there must be a voluntarye consent of mynde betwene the sayde man & the sayd woman,

I doo declare therebye the offyce and duetye of the manne to the woman, and of the woman agayne to the manne accordyngelye, as that state of Matrymony

e doeth requyre, and albeit as touchynge the bonde, the man and the woman are sometymes vpō reasonable causes, approued by the lawe, separated, yet that separation breaketh not the bonde or knote of Matrymonye.
                     Nowethat ye knowe what Matrymonye is, ye shall also haue declared vnto yon, who was the authour thereof. For knowledge whereof ye shall vnderstande, that the blessed trinitie, hauynge newly made the world and beautified it with creatures, and laste of all made man, dyd consyder that it was not expedient man to be alone, and therefore as scrip ture doeth declare Genesis. ii. dyd put Adam to slepe & there in the tyme of his slepe, did take one of his rib bes, supplieng fleshe for it, and in conclusiō did make thereof a woman, called Eua, bringing her to Adam that by bothe their consentes (and the holye trinitie aydynge and assysting therein, and beyng the verye aucthor thereof) a bonde or knotte of Matrymonye myght be made betwyxt Adam and Eue, whervpō Adam beholdynge the sayde woman being brought vnto hym, and beyng vndoutedlye inspyred by the holy ghost, dyd saye these wordes folowyng.

By whyche wordes it euidentlye appeareth, that God is the author, inuentour aud maker of Matrimony: which thing to be so, Sainte Mathewe in the. xix. chapter of his ghospel, Saynct Marke in the. x. & S. Paule in the. vi. and. xi. of his fyrst epistle to the Corynthians, and the saide Saint Paule in his fyrst chapter to the Ephesians, do plainlye affirme and testifie, and so haue you thys poyncte suffyciently opened and proued vnto you.
                     And as touchynge the thyrde thynge, it is to wit, where Matrymony was instituted, ye shall soone learne that in the fyrste and seconde chapter of Genesis, where Moyses declarethe that almyghtye God hauynge planted paradyse, a place of great pleasure, and therein puttynge man, whome he had formed, dyd not onelye ioyne man and woman there together, as is before sayd, but also dyd blesse the sayde man and woman, sayinge. Crescite, & multiplicamini & replete terram. that is to saye. Doo you encrease, and be you multiplied, and doe you replinyshe the earth, or worlde. Whych wordes were ofsuche effecte and vertue, beynge spoken of almyghtye God, that alwayes contynuallye from the tyme that they were spoken, they doe and shall to the worldes ende worke, and be auayleable, in the generation of thynges, as the greate learned man Chrysostome in hys homilye, De proditione Iude. doeth playnely testifie.
                     Now concernyng the fourth poynte, it is to wyt, Wherfore was matrimonie instituted, ye shal

know that consyderyng the state of matrimonye, as it was in the tyme of innocencye, and before synne was committed by Adam and Eue, soo the cause of institution of matrimonye was double one concerning the persones maryed, and the other concerning the issue that shoulde come of them. And as touching the personnes maryed, the cause in them is that ther should be thereby, the fyrste and cheife copulation of humayne societie, hauyng a true and an amiable coniunction in it, of man and woman, the one to rule, & the other to obeye. And as touchyng the issue ye cause of marryage in that respecte, is both in honeste loue to brynge forth chyldren, and also Godlye and vertuously to bringe vp the same, both which causes we haue expressed and sette forth in scrypture, the fyrste Genesis, ii, where God sayeth. Faciamus ei adiutoriū simile sibi. That is to saye. Let vs make an ayde or help vnto him lyke vnto hym selfe. And the second Genesis. i. where God sayeth, Crescite & multiplicamini & replete terram. That is to say. Do you increase, and be you multiplied & replenishe youe the earthe. And consideryng the state of matrymony as it was after the synne or fal of Adam and Eue, then besides the foresayde .ii. causes there was a third, it is to wit to avoyde fornication and that humayne weakenes and infirmitie myght haue therfore, the honest remedye of mariage and lawefull copulation, accordyng wherevnto Saynte Augustyne. De Genesi ad literam. in hys nynth booke and seuenth chapter, sayeth thus. Deni
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            utrius
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            sexus infirmitas propendens in ruinā turpitudinis recte excipitur honestate nuptiarum, ut quod sanis possit esse officium, sit egrotis

medium. That is to saye. Finally or for conclusion, the infyrmitie or weakenes of both the kyndes (it is to wytte, of manne and woman) prone or readie to fall into the ruine or 
                           〈◊〉
                         of filthines, is well holden vppe or preserued by the honestie of matrimony, that that whi che myght be vnto the innocente or hole per sons an office or duetye, myghte be vnto the sicke or weake persones a remedy or helpe.
                     And here by the way ye shal note, that yf our fore fathers Adam and Eue had not sinned, thē they and theyr ofsprynge shoulde not haue bene troubled with the prickynge or styrrynge of the fleshe, nor wyth the feruor or rage of carnal lust, but should haue begottē or procreated chyldren without anye suche styrre or rage, and without any synne at all, yea and with me rite also, where after theyr fall, bothe they and theyr posteritie by the deadely lawe of concupiscence, inhe tynge vnto theyr members, (without the which car nall coniunction is not done) had not that liberty, so that nede it was, bothe them and theyr posteritie to haue some good ayde and helpe, to excuse carnal copulation (otherwyse culpable) and to make it laweful. And herevpon S. Augustine consideryng wel ye matter doth attribute two offices vnto matrimony before the fal of mā, and the thyrd he doeth attribute vnto it after the fal of mā. But yet besides these cause or endes, for which matrimony was by god in paradise instituted, there is another not ye least but rather

and principall (yf we consider and regarde the purpose of God herein) whyche is, that Matrimonye or maryage shoulde be a fytte sygne or mystical token, of that mooste assured and strong coniunction, that should be betwene Christ (yet, then to come) and the church, which churche euerlastyngly before the creation of the worlde, aud from the begynnynge, God dydde preordeyne, chose and electe vnto hymselfe: as Paule witnesseth in the fyrste chapters of his Epystles to the Ephesians and to Tyte. For the vnspeak able wysedome of God, forseyng and knowynge before, that man after his creation throughe the wylynes and deceate of the deuyl, woulde fal, and deserue eternall death, dyd most mercifully in thys hys foresyght 
                           〈◊〉
                        , caste, determine, and dispose wyth hymselfe, a meane, howe man beyng fallen, might againe be restored and regenerated. And therefore appointynge vnto Chryste (who shoulde be the father, and parent of thys generation) a maryage mete therevn to, dyd to mans great and marueylous comforte in the myraculous couplynge, and conioynynge of Adā (representyng Chryst, then to come) and Eue, being formed and made of the ribbe of Adames syde, Adā beyng a slepe, dyd (I saye) as in a shadowe, and a fygure, shewe before, and expresse the same knotte and bonde of mariage of Christ and the church. And this (as it were) plyghtyng of trouth, for thys marryage to come, was farther by a promyse made by God to man confyrmed and ratifyed, when he sayde in the thyrd chapyter of Genesis, that the sede of the wo man shoulde with his foote tread downe the

serpentes heade. Whyche promyse from the begynnynge, contynuallye, and from tyme to tyme, God almyghty renued to the holy fathers and patriarches, & wylled hys prophetes to open and publyshe it.
                     And to passe ouer al other testunonyes, how notably and playnely dothe the prophete Oze in his thyrd cha piter speake hereof, sayiug. Et sponsabo te mihi in sempiternum et sponsabo te mihi in iustitia, in iudicio et misericordia, et in miserationibus Et sponsabo te mihi sed. &c. That is to saye. And I wyll marye the vnto my owne selfe for euermore, yea vnto my selfe wyll I marie the in righte wysenes, in iudgement, in mercie and in com passion. And in faythe also wyll I marye the vnto my selfe. &c.
                     Accordyng whervnto Salomon, in his notable and excellent boke called Cantica Camicorum, dydde synge and prophecie of this maryage, then yet to come, where he declarynge the great desyre and longynge that the bride had, that the daye of solempnyzynge the maryage (standyng yet betwene hyr brydegrome and her, in onely handfastyng or plyghtyng of fayth & trouth) myght come sayeth thus 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                            me osculo oris sui. That is to saye. Oh that he woulde kysse me wyth the kysse of hys mouthe. But fynallye whan the daye drewe 
                           〈◊〉
                        , and the brydegrome was come downe into the worlde, howe dyd Ihon baptiste, the mooste holy brideman, reioyce of thys the brydegromes com mynge and that the tyme was full runne oute. And sayde as wytnesseth S. Iohn the Euangeliste in his

Gospell and in the thyrd Chapyter in thys maner. Qui habet sponsam sponsus est, amicus autem sponsi qui stat & audit. eum 
                              〈◊〉
                            gaudit, propter uocem sponsi: Hoc ergo gaudium 
                              〈◊〉
                            impletum est That is to saye: He that hathe the bryde is the brydegrome. And the frende of the bridgrome who standethe and hearethe hym, reioysethe greatly to heare the voyce of the brydgrome. This my ioye therefore is fulfylled. So that here 
                           〈◊◊◊〉
                         howe frome the begynnynge of the worlde, the churche hathe bene berrouthed to Chryste. Hys seruauntes the prophtes were sente, whyche should call them, that were bidden to the ma riage. At length came Chryste the brydegrome, more beutyfull then the chyldren of 
                           〈◊〉
                        , to whome whyle he dyd ascende or goo vp to the bryde chamber of the crosse, and there fallynge into slepe, the heauenlye father out of his sonnes syde, beynge opened wyth the speare of the souldier, dyd 
                           〈◊〉
                        , and as it were shape vnto Chryste his betrouthed bryde, the church, and so beautified her and coupled them two together in suche an indissoluble band or knotte, that euerlastynge they shall continue and cleaue together, as two in one fleshe. And so is fulfylled and consummate that maryage, so longe before prefigured, soo often promysed to the patriarches, so playnelye spoken of by the prophetes, and contynuallye in the laweful maryage of man and woman, mystycally represented and remembred, of whyche S. Paule sayeth. Ephes. 5. Sacramentum hoc magnum est: ego autem dico in Chisto et ecclesia.
                     
                     That is to saye. This (speakynge of Matrymonye)

is a high or greate misterie, I meane it truely in Christe and the Churche. And thus muche haue we spoken to declare, what matrymony is, who is author thereof, where is was fyrste 
                           〈◊〉
                        , and what were the causes of the institution. Nexte there fore accordyng to oure proposed diuision in the begin nynge of thys 
                           〈◊〉
                        , is to speake of the. v. poynte that is, who maye contracte matrymonye. For know ledge whereof ye shall vnderstande, that the lawe or ordynaunce made concernynge persons which are to be allowed vnto, or reiected from matrymonye, is an ordynaunce, or lawe prohibytorye, that is to saye, forbyddynge some, and permyttinge, suffryng, and al lowynge ail the rest not beyng forbidden, so that who soeuer is not forbydden specially, or generally, to contracte matrymony, the same is consequently to be ad mytted and allowed vnto it, and this resolutyon to be true, maye be proued by the rule of contraryes, whyche here also dothe take his place, for yf I do wel knowe who cannot marye (whyche knowledge I haue had all readye gyuen vnto me in the declaration of the impedymentes or lettes to contracte matrymonye) I shall by and by knowe who may contracte matrymony. Quia contrariorum cadem est disciplina & cognito 
                              〈◊〉
                            de contraijs cognoscitur et

                           . In dede certayne persons there are forbydden bothe by the 
                           〈◊〉
                         and also be the Canon lawes, to marye togethere, as appeareth emongest many other places in the tytles 
                           
                              〈◊◊〉
                           . et de consanguinitate et affinitate. In so muche that betwene those persones that are in linea ascendenti ucl descenden ti, Mariage is vtterly forbydden, and betwene those

persones that are in the collaterall lyne, maryage can not be made, yf eyther of the personnes whyche is to be maryed, be of 
                           〈◊〉
                         or allyaunce vnto the other in the forth degre or vnder. And of specyal prohybyty ons concerninge matrymony, ye haue mention made in Scrypture bothe in the, xviii. and. xx. chapyters of Leuytycus, and also in the. xxii. of Deuteronomij, whyche places shall sufficientlye and plainlye open & declare thys matter vnto you. And nowe concernynge the syxe poynte whyche is howe matrimonye is contracted, ye shall vnderstande, that yf matrymonye 
                           〈◊〉
                         consydered as touchyng the bonde and knotte thereof onely, so matrymony is contracted and made by the onelye lawefull consente of the man and of the woman, that may be coupled, and 
                           〈◊〉
                         together in matrymonye, for the profe whereof, words of the present tyme, or sufficient and equyualente signes, are by the order of the lawe necessaryelye requyred to testyfye that consent.
                     And yf matrymony be considered as touchyng the full and hole perfection thereof, then matrymonye maye be sene so contracted, when not onelye such con sente is hadde, but also carnall copulation, there vpon doth folowe. Example after the fyrste consyderatyon maye be taken of our fyrste parentes Adam and Eue, who by our Lorde in paradyse, were before thervpon and in the state of theyr innocencye, ioyned in matrymony, by coniunction of myndes, thoughe there then betwene them was no carnall copulation at all, and yet true matrimony, for as the lawe saythe: Nuptias non concubitus sed consensus facit. That is to saye, Consente

doth make matrimonie, and not the carnall copulation or lyinge together. And as for exam ple also the seconde consideration of matrymonye, it may also be taken of our sayd parentes after their fal and when they were for theyr transgressyon expulsed oute of paradyse, for beynge man and wyfe, they dyd then carnall knowe eche other, and had thereby generation of Chylder, as appeareth in dyuerse places of scrypture, and especially in the. v. and syxte chapyters of Genesys. And touchynge thys dyuersytie of considerations in matrymonye, with the dyuers sygnifications thereof, and of many thynges elles apper teynynge vnto the same, who lysteth, maye haue recourse to the. xxviii cause & second questyon, where he may see the iudgemēt of Saint Chrisostome S. Am brose, S. Augustyne and or manye other in this mat ter, and lykewise he maye haue in the Chapyter Expublico, de conuersione coniugatorum. And as touching the seuēth poynte whych is howe matrimony oughte to be vsed ye shall note herein the councel of S. Paule in the. vii chapyter of his fyrst epystle to the Corinthians, wher speakyng to maried persones, and exhorting them to vse them selues in theyr vocation after a good and per fecte sorte he doth say thus. Hoc ita

                           〈◊〉
                        , there remayneth that they which haue wyues be as thoughe they had 
                           〈◊〉
                        . And the same Saint Paule declarynge howe purelye and clenely maryed folkes

shoulde vse them selues in matrymonye, dothe in the fourthe chapyter of his fyrst epystle to the Thessaloni senses say thus. Hec est enim uoluntas dei sanctificatio uestra vt ab stineatis uos a fornicatione ut sciat unusquis
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            uestrum, uas suum possidere in sanctificatione & honore, non in passione desiderij sicut et gentes quae ignerant deum. That is to saye: This in dede is the wyll of GOD, youre sanctification, that ye do abstaine from fornication, that euerye one of you maye learne or knowe to possesse hys vessel in sanctification, and honour, not in the possion of desyre or luste, as the gentyles also who do not knowe GOD.
                     And the selfe same Saynt Paule also declarynge father howe maryed folkes should vse them selues ye one vnto the other, dothe in the fyft chapyter of hys Epystle to the Ephesians saye thus. Mulieris uiris suis subdita sunt sicut domino, quoniam uir caput est mulieris sicut Christus caput est ecclesiae, ipse saluator corporis, sed sicut Fcclesia subiecta est Christo ita et mulieris uiris siuis in omnibus. Viri diligete uxoris uestras sicut & Christus dilexit ecclesiam. That is to saye Lette women be subiecte vnto theyr husbandes as to oure Lorde, for the husband is the heade of the wo man, as Chryste is the head of the Churche, he is the sauiour of the bodye, and as the chur che is subiecte vnto Chryste, so let women be vnto theyr husbandes in all thynges. 
                           〈◊〉
                         husbandes doo ye loue youre wyues as christ hath loued the Churche.

Moreouer the same S. Paule in the syxt chapyter 
                           〈◊〉
                         the sayde Epystle, teaching maryed folkes to whome God hath sent chyldren, howe they shoulde vse theyr chyldren, doth saye thus. Educate illos in disciplina, & correptione domini. That is to saye. Bringe vppe your chyldren in the disciplin, and chastisement of oure Lorde. Dyuerse examples we haue of thys, in the ho lye scrypture as of Sara the doughter of Raguel, and of yonge Thoby her husband, of whom mention is made in the. viii chapyter of Thobye, and also of that godly and modest matron Sara, and Abraham her husbande, of whome S, Peter in the thyrd chapyter of hys fyrst Epystle, sayeth thus. Sit enim aliquando & sanctae mulieris, sperantes in deo, ornabant se, subiecta proprijs uiris, sicut Sara obediebat Abrahae, dominum eum uocans. That is to saye.
                     For so sometimes holy women also trusting in God, did 
                           〈◊〉
                         them selues, beynge subiecte or obedient to their owne husbandes, and Sa ra dyd obeie Abraham, callyng hym maister, or Lorde.
                     Lyke examples are of the godlye couples, Isaac, and Rebecca (Gene, xxv) Helcana and Anna (i. Re. i) with sondry other, whyche all dyd vse thē selues soo in the state of matrymonye, that they continuallye lyued in the feare of God in the chaste loue of wedlocke, in the honest affection or mynde towardes the bryngynge furthe of chyldren, aud dyd also diligently loke vnto the godlye education of the same. And as concernynge the. viii. and laste parte of our foresayde diuision, it is to wtte, of the treasures, gyftes, and

                        
                           〈◊〉
                         of maryage, ye shall vnderstande that S. Augustyne in his. ix boke vpon the Geneses, and the. vii. chapyter thereof, teacheth vs, that matrymonye conteyneth in it three gyftes, graces, or benefyts, it is to wytte a sacramente, a fayth, and an of sprynge or yssue.
                     Concernynge the Sacrament, he sayth that thys is speciallye herein to be obserued, it is to wytte, that betwene the man and the wyfe there be no separatyon and that nether the man or the wyfe, beynge eche from other dismised, doo marye or couple them selues with any other, and soo the vertue of this sacra ment doth consyste properlye, and specially in the inse perable, or vnbreakeable bonde of the maryage couenaunte, whyche (as we sayde before) is the 
                           〈◊〉
                         or cheife poynte belongynge to maryage. This couenaunt, God assysteth, and this knot he knittethe and beynge once knytte, he makethe it stronge, and establysheth it, yea, and further dothe geue suche grace with it, that they whyche abuse not that grace, maye be hable to kepe the marryage couenaunte vnuyolated, and mutually soo to loue one the other, as Chryst hathe loued, and dothe loue the churche, And by the ayde of the same grace, they shall and wyll frankelye, truelye, and moste louynglye, communycat one to an other, all thynges accordynge to Goddes lawe, and mans lawe, and al maner of chaunces, good or badde prosperitie, or aduersitie, they shall moste contentedly and quyetlye, receaue, beare, and vse together, tyll death them depart. Thys benefyte of thys sacrament doth engendre an assured boldnes, or confydence and

truste of good consience, by the whych both the man and also the wyfe, are made sure that the state of matrymonye (into the whyche they, in the feare of God, and for honeste and vertuous respectes onelye, haue entred and truelye and holylye obserued of theyr partes) is not voyde of the grace of God, but that GOD hathe a care ouer them, yea and that thys theyr state of Matrimony is also merytorious: according where vnto S.

That is to saye: Mariage in all is honorable: and a bedde vndefiled. And saynte Ambrose also in hys seconde booke of the Patryarche Abraham

                         the persons so maryed do thynke verely that thys maryage where in they are

                         is prouided, procured, and done of God. Thys gifte of thys sacramente to them that diligently wyll ponder and consider the same, will especyallye edyfye theyre consciences to them selues, and wyll also kyndle mutually the fyre of chast loue betwene them. The second benefite or gyfte of matrimonye (Saynt Augustyne sayth) is fayth, not meanynge that faythe and

                         confydence whiche we haue in God, but that faythfull true and honest dealynge, whyche is required

to be betwene man and wyfe, in not hauynge carnall knowledge wyth an e other: the man not with any other, then with his true and laweful wife, and the wife not with any other, then wyth her true and lawefull husbande: whiche synguler gyfte, onely God in thys sacramente imparteth and geueth of hys goodnes to them, whyche (in suche sorte as we haue declared) are maryed, or els what man or woman is there, of many thousandes, that beynge as they are

                     Nowe the thyrd gyfte or benefytte whyche saynete Augustyne say the to be in Matrunonye is islue or ofsprynge, for whych cause cheifely matrimonye is contracted, wherevnto the man and the

                        , commynge in the feare of God, oughte so to respecte and regarde theyr issue and of sprynge, that in chaste and mutuall loue, they may be get and brynge forthe chyldren, and in the saythe, feare, and relygion of God brynge vp, and instructe the same. And in soo doyng, matrymonye not onely is voyde and cleare from all maner of faulte, but also hathe hys certayne merite at Goddes handes. These three gyftes concurrynge in matrymonye, and causynge the accompanyenge of man and woman together in carnall knowledge, to be by thys meanes without sinne, yea, and well vsed to be meritorious to, howe greate a grace then is annexed

to thys sacramente of Matrymony, of whyche hytherto we haue intreated.
                     And here to conclude this counsell semeth good to be gyuen to those that hereafter shalbe minded and disposed to marye, that they do chuse to them suche a mate, as neyther Godes Iawe, nor mannes lawe doo prohibite them to take, and with whome they maye conceyue good hope that they beynge ioyned in matrymonye, shall leade an holye Godlye, and comelye lyfe, euer to contynue inseperablye, durynge theyr lyues, whiche is lyke they shall dooe, when they not rashelye and indeliberatlye but with good aduyse cō
                        sideringe equalitie and vertue more, then eyther carnall luste, worldly honoure or pryuate respectes, doo in the feare of God enter into this honest state of matrymonye, entendynge thereby to serue God there countrye and frendes, lyuing also them selues in honestie, iustice, and temperaunce, and finallye bryngynge vp their chyldren, and gouernynge there famylye in vertue and Godlynes.

                     ¶ Of the sacrament of extreme vnction, and thexposition or deciaration thereof.
                     HAuinge intreated sufficientlye of syxe of the sacramentes vsed in the catholyke churche, and none of them remaynynge indiscussed, sauynge one, whiche is the sacramente of extreme vnction, we wyll nowe of it, beynge the laste in number and order, speake lastely & breifely And thoughe it be laste in number and order, as is a foresayde, and also commonlye is called the extreme vnction, that is to saye: the laste vnction, yet ye shall not vnderstand thereby that this sacrament can not be ministred at any tyme, but when a man is cleane withoute hope of lyfe, and shall in no wyse escape the death: nor ye maye not thereby vnderstande, that after thys sacrament of extreme vnction, no other Sacrament, at any tyme els, can be ministered vnto the person so anoyled. For in dede this sacrainente maye be minystred in the entrye of the syckenes, and also manye tymes ells, whensoeuer anye greate maladye or peryllous syckenes, shall come to anye man, in soo muche that he who is daungerously sycke, and there fore anoylynge and anoynted, receyuing and vsynge this sacramente, may (yf he escape the daunger and after fall into it agayne, or into any other suche lyke) haue ministred vnto him agayne thys laudable and notable sacrament of extreme vnction, whiche of it selfe is both iterable (as Penaunce Euchariste, and Matrymonye is) and not alwayes mynystred in the

catholyke churche, that the sicke person so sone as he hath receyued it shoulde incontinentlye departe oute of thys worlde, and want his lyfe. But contrary wise that the sayde person both in soule, and also in bodye maye (yf it so be sene good vnto

                         God) recouer and gette healthe agayue. And thys to be soo those notable prayers full of all godlynes and sauourynge antiquitie vsed nowe in the catholyke churche agreinge with the counsell and commaundemente of S. James in the last chapiter of his epystle, do euidently, and playnelye declare and shewe vnto vs.
                     And although in oure wycked tyme smale is the nō
                        ber of them that do escape death, hauynge receyued this sacrament of extreme vnction, yet that is not to be ascrybed vnto the lacke or faulte of thys sacrament but rather vnto the wante and lacke of stedfast and constant fayth, which oughte to be in those that shall haue this sacrament mynystred vnto them: by which stronge fayth the power of almyghty God in the prymitiue churche, did worke myghtely, and effectuallye in the

                         persones enoynted, receyuynge thys holy and comfortable sacramente, and nowe for the lacke of lyke fayth in our tyme, dothe not worke after lyke sorte. Accordyng where vnto we reade in the. vi. chapiter of S. Marke after thys sorte, Et non poterat ibi uirtutem 
                              〈◊〉

                     And he (that is to saye Chryste) could not do any miracle there, sauing that he did cure a fewe sicke persones,

                         his handes vpon them,

                           〈◊〉
                         or vnbeleife of them. This sacrament 
                           〈◊〉
                         is not called the sacrament of extreme or last vnction for that that deathe alwayes dothe followe it, or for that that no sacrament can be minystcred after to the person enoynted, but for that speciallye that all other vnctions beinge vsed in the admynystratyon of the sacramentes, do go before, & this vnction doth folowe them. And here by the waye forasmuche as we doo speake of extreme vnction, ye shall vnderstande, that there are (as the maister of the sentence in hys fourth boke and. xxiii. distinctiou doth testifye) three kindes or sortes of vnctions, accustomed and vsed in ye churche, the first vnctiō, in tyme, is that where with yonglynges (comming newly to be instructed and taught in the fayth and religion of Chryste, called in Latyne Cathecumini) are by the preiste to be anoynted wyth all vpon the breast, and betwene the shoulders, and this vnction is made onely with oyle olyue, beynge, fyrste sanctified or consecrated by the byshoppe, and afterwardes vsed by the preist in mynystration.
                     The seconde vnction is, that whiche is made or done, notwith oyle alone, as the former is, nor wyth balme alone, but it is made and done wyth Chrysme, whych is made of oyle olyue and of balme, and soo of two lyquors myngled and myxte together, the oyle to signifye ye clensinge & purging of the conscience and ye balme to sygnifye the swete sauor of good name & same, required to be in the partie yt is there with to be anoynted. And this vnction, so made wt chrysine, is a principall, and a cheyfe vnction, and the holye ghoste

pryncipally, or chiefely, is geuen in or by it. And with thys 
                           〈◊〉
                         the heades of kynges and bysshoppes are to be anoynted, yea and the heades of the chyldrenne baptyzed, are here wyth aboue theyre foreheades by ye preiste to be anoynted. 
                           〈◊〉
                         and finallye the chyldren whiche by laynge on of the byshoppes handes, are by the sayde by shoppe to be confyrmed, muste also by the sayde bishoppe be signed with the crosse, and with the sayde Chrysme in theyr forehead be also by him anointed. And the thyrde vnction, of whyche we nowe haue to speake and to intreate vppon, is that wherewith sycke personnes in the places accustomed are to be anoynted withall. And thys vnction is made also of oyle olyue onelye, beynge sanctyfied or consecrated by the by shoppe whiche commonly and customablye the sayde by shoppe accordyng to the olde tradition of the churche doth in dic coenae domini As Saynct Cypryan in hys sermen de unctione doeth testifye. And Sayncte Dyonyse also in hys booke de 
                              〈◊〉
                            hierarchia in the fourthe chapiter. And nowe concernynge the institution of thys sacrament, we doe reade Marci. vi. how Chryste callynge vnto hym hys. xii. apostles, and sendynge them forthe by two and two, dydde prescrybe vnto them a certayne forme of embassadge or message and dyd also geue vnto them a certayn power, which they shoulde occupye and vse.
                     And we doe reade also there, that the Apostles so goinge forthe dy preach vnto the people penaunce, and that they dydde caste forth deuyles, and also that they dyd anoynte 
                           〈◊〉
                         oyle manye that were sycke, who there by were healed and cured. And we maye not

here thynke, as manye vayne folyshe persones, folowinge theyr owne fansyes and dreames, haue reported and sayde) that these apostles of Chryst were in thys behalfe as commone chyrurgions, and that by 
                           〈◊〉
                         they dyd heale and cure the sycke, for as ye shall perceyue anone by the testimonye of S. James, thys healynge and curyng was many times bothe concernyng the soule and also the bodye, wherefore the oyle, where wyth the Apostles dyd anoynte the sycke per sons, was sacramentall and mystycall sanctifyed oyle, and therefore dyd so worke bothe in the body and also in the soule o; the sycke personne. And after thys sorte the catholyke churche euen from the begynnyng hath accepted and taken thys to be a sacramente of Chrystes institution and ordinaunce, and so alwayes continuallye hathe reteyned and kepte it, takynge for a testimonye of the foundation and grounde thetof, the sayde. vi. chapter of Sayncte Marke, so by the auncient fathers of the churche most learnedly and godlye expounded and interpretated, where vnto is adioyned the testimonye of Saynct James in the last chapiter of hys canonicall epistle, wher he being a blessed apostle, & clearely expressynge and vtterynge the maner and fourme of the administration of this Sacrament, whiche he had receaued of Chryst, and delyuered vnto the people to be of them obserued and kepte, doth say thus.

Which wordes of S. James doo manyfestlye declare this vnction or anoylynge to be a sacrament, as hauinge a visible sygne, and a promyse of grace annexed therevnto. And yf ye besydes the thynges before rehearsed, and expressed in scrypture, be desyrous to haue the testimonyes also of the auncient fathers of the churche, concernyng this sacramente of

                     The Sacramente of Extreme Unction, is the dew annoylinge of the penitent sicke person doon by the preiste, with consecrated oyle, for the remedye or easyng of the sayd penitent, in soule, and for the recouery of corporall health if it be so thoughte expediēt to God. In which diffinition when we saye (the penytent sycke person) we do meane thereby that thys sacrament is mynistred frutefully, onely to those that be members of Chrystes churche, and to such as, beinge once fallen oute of the state of grace by deadelye synne, haue been by penaunce restored agayne to the sayde grace, and there vpon by thys sacramente are strenghethened and conforted in theyr agonye and fight agaynste the deuyll, who in the tyme of syckenes and vexation of mannes bodye, is moste busye to assaulte him. And albeit that thys sacramente be of thys notable effecte, yet no man oughte to conceyue thys vayne false hope of the effecte of the same, that he hauing lyued in 
                           〈◊〉
                         aud abhominable synne and not caryng to be from it delyuered by true penaunce shall by the onely mynystration of thys sacramente of extreme vnction, haue all hys synnes forgyuen hym.
                     And where further, in the sayde dyfinition, is conteyned, (for the remedye or easynge of the sayde

penitent) ye shall note that concernynge the soule, no man may doute, but that at all tymes the infirmytye thereof in the sicke person duely repentinge maye the soner by the vertue of thys sacrament be eased, according to the promyse of the holy Ghooste in the aboue rehersed wordes of Saynte James, And as concerning the infirmitie of the body, it also maye be hoped and loked for the soner by the worthye receyuynge of thys sacrament, yf God (who knoweth oure necessities, and can, and also will dispose all thynges swetely and also pleasauntly to the attaining of euerlasting comforte, whiche all good men cheifelye desyre and praye for) so thynke it expediente for the sycke person. And here to knytte vp the matter, where an ende is made of all the. vii. sacramentes, we can doo no lesse then of chrysten charitie to wyshe that all those (who in thys late scismaticall tyme haue vndoutedlye by ye instigation of the deuyll, eyther vtterlye contempned or litle regardrd these sacramentes, and emongeste them speciallye this sacramente of extreme vnction, will nowe after our ioyfull reconciliation to the vnytie of the catholyke churche, regarde all the sayde sacramentes as they ought to do, and soo lyue heare in thys transitory worlde, that they conunynge to there extreme passage, which at one time or other they can not escape, maye from deathe come to lyfe, and from death of the body haue euerlastyng lyfe of the soule, and in conclusion after the generall resurrectiō, haue the body ioyned vnto the soule, in blysse euerlastynge whiche almyghty God graunt vnto vs all.
                  
               
               
                  
                  ¶ Here nowe doo folowe the ten commaundementes of almyghty God, whiche are taken oute of Exodus the. xx. oute of Leuiticus the xxvi. and out of Deuteronomie the. v. chapiters.
                  
                     .i. Thou shalt not haue straūge Goddes before me.
                     .ii. Thou shalte not make to the anye grauen thinge, nor anye lykenesse of anye thynge that is in heauen aboue, aud that is in earth beneth, nor of them that be in the waters

                        ? der the earth, Thou shalt not adore them, nor honour them with godly honoure.
                     .iii. Thou shalt not take the name of thy Lorde God in vayne.
                     .iiii. Remembre that thou kepe holye the Saboth daye.
                     .v. Honoure thy father, and thy mother.

                     .vii. Thou shalt not commytte adultery.

                     ¶ The preface of the. x. commaundementes.
                     THree partes of oure promyse, beynge nowe perfourmed, it is to wytte, first what fayth is, and how it is to be taken in this boke, secondly the exposytion of the twelue articles of the chrysten beleife, theyrdely the declaration of the. vii. sacramentes, the promysed order nowerequyreth, that in this fourth place, the tenne commaun dementes, with theyr declaration, be set fourth vnto you, for an introduction vnto whiche ye shall note foure poyntes: Fyrste, what is the lawe, or the commaundemente of God, Secondelye, howe the commaundementes of God must be obserued, to the plea sure of God, and our saluation: Thyrdely, what gre uous punyshmentes God, dothe in holye Scripture threaten and manace vudoutedlye to be inflycted to the breakers of his commaundementes, and fourthlye, what greate rewardes the keapers of hys law, & cōmaundementes, shall receaue at Goddes handes. Touchynge the fyrst poynte, whiche is, what the law and commaundemente of God is you shall knowe that the lawe of God, is a rule gyuen to vs, of God for the good guydynge of our selues. Whiche rule declareth, and sheweth to vs, what is the wyll and plea sure of God for vs to doo, or not to dooe, in thoughte worde. and dede. And when I call it a rule, I meane that as the bryckelayer cannot make a wal euen and strayghte, withoute the direction of hys lyne nor a mason can not hewe any coygne or assler stone, with

                        
                           〈◊〉
                         the direction of his squyre and rule, nor the 
                           〈◊〉
                         master can guyde or styre his shyppe safely to good hauen, or harborough, withoute the direction of the compasse, so neyther man nor woman can order, guyde, and rule theyr lyfe euenly, dyrectly, & streightlye, to the wyll and pleasure of almyghty God, without the knowledge and direction of his lawe, and commaundementes, which are the lyne, rule, squyre, and compasse, whereby we maye reare our workes vpryghtly, frame our selfes in vertue constantly, and gouerne the course of lyfe into the hauen of felicitie prosperouslye. And where I saye, that the commaun dementes are geuen to vs of God, I declare thereby, that onely God hath, both (throughe the lawe of nature) in our hartes prynted them, and also in the law of Moyses with his owne fynger, (that is to saye, by the vertue of the holy spyryte) in two tables of stone wrytten them. And laste of all our sauioure Chryste, beynge both God and man, hath ratified and expoū
                        ded them in the newe lawe of the Gospell: to the intent that with all diligence we shoulde studye to obserue and kepe the sayd commaundements, not onely because they are so expediente and profitable vnto vs, but especially because that thei are geuen to vs of God, who therby doth declare to vs his godlye wyll and pleasure, vnto whom both we, and all creatures els, are bounde to be obedient.
                     And as touchynge the seconde poynte, whiche is howe we muste obserue and kepe the commaundementes of God to his pleasure, and thereby obtayne of him rewarde in heauen, ye shall here note, that we

must kepe the 
                           〈◊〉
                         three maner of wayes, first holy and 
                           〈◊〉
                         in theyr perfecte number, being ten, accordyng wherevnto in the first chapiter of S. Luke, in the high and greate commendation of Zachary and Elyzabeth, the parentes of Saint Ihon Baptyste, it is wrytten. Erant autem iusti 
                              〈◊〉
                            de um, incedentes in omnibus mandatis et iustificationibus domini, sine querela That is to say: And thei both were iust before GOD, walkyng or lyuyngem all the cō
                        maundementes & iustifications of GOD without any complaynte agaynst them.
                     And I do saye those wordes Holye and fully, forasmuch as it is not inough to kepe parte or some of the sayd commaundementes of God, and to leaue parte of them vnkepte: But as in a harpe, a lute, or a vyol (being instrumentes of 
                           〈◊〉
                        ) euery string with other must be tuned, and none lefte vntuned, leste thereby some vnpleasant soundes, and discords might be vttered, so we muste putte all and euerye the commaundementes of God, to theyr tuneable fashion and practyse, lest that yf any be left vnused or 
                           〈◊〉
                         of vs, there might to the pure and cleane eares and iudgemente of Almyghtye GOD, come thereby some vnpleasaunte sownde, and vnswete reporte of our lyues and doynges.
                     Accordyng wherevnto Saynt Iames in the. ii. chapiter of his epistle sayeth. 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                           ; totam legem 
                              〈◊〉
                            rit, offendat autem in uno, factus est omniū reus. That is to saye:

whosoeuer shall kepe the hole lawe, and yet offende in one poynte or parte thereof, is become gyltie of all.
                     The second way by whiche we must kepe ye commaundementes of God, is that we doo kepe them with a ryght intention: that is for the loue, for the honor, and for the glory of God onelye, and not for anye honoure or glorye, to be geuen to vs, of man in thys lyfe.
                     For whosoeuer in doinge of hys good dedes, intendeth principally to get honor, glory or reward of man, hath a wronge intention, and hys dede soo done (yea although it be commaunded of God) is not pleasaunte or acceptable vnto God. And of thys ryghte intention speaketh our sauiour Chryst in the vi. chapiter of Saynte Mathewe sayinge. Lucerna corporis tui est oculus tuus, Sioculus tuus fuerit simplex, totum corpus tuum lucidum erit. Si autem oculus tuus fuerit nequam, totum corpus 
                              〈◊◊〉
                            nebrosum erit That is to saye: The light of thy body is thine 
                           〈◊〉
                        . 
                           〈◊〉
                         thine eie be simple or 
                           〈◊〉
                        , then all thy body wilbe bright or cleare but yf thine eie be euill or nought, all thy bodye wilbe full of darkenes.
                     Heare by the eye is vnderstanded the intente, the regarde, or purpose of mans hart, and by the bodye, is ment the wordes, actes and 
                           〈◊〉
                         of man, procedynge from the harte, and by that intente directed and ordered.
                     
                        Therefore Saynt Paule agreing herevnto doth exhorte vs, in his first Epistle to the Corynthyans, and in the. x. chapiter, saying thus. Siue manducatis, siue bibitis, siue aliud quid facitis, omnia in gloriam dei facite That is to saye: Whether ye do eat, whether ye do drink, or whether ye do any other thinge ells, do ye all thinges vnto the glory of GOD
                     Nowe the thyrd way whereby we must obserue the commaundementes of GOD, is with constancye and perseueraunce to contynue in the doyng of thē. For as our Sauiour Chryst sayeth in the. x. of Mathewe. Qui perseuer auerit us
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            in finem, hic saluus erit. That is to saye: He that doth perseuer, or continue, vntill the very ende shall be saued. And in dede so constantlye we shoulde kepe Goddes commaundementes, that no temporall payne threatened or put vnto vs in this worlde, shoulde moue vs to breake any of them. Such a constant seruaunt to God was Susanna of whome we reade in the. xiii. chapiter of Danyell, that when she was prouoked to ye synne of adultery by two olde iudges, vnder no lesse paine then to be accused in open iudgement, whiche was death by the lawe, she woulde not graunte to that synnefull dede, but sayde these wordes. Angustie sunt mihi undi
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                           , sienim hoc egero, mors mihiest: siautem non egero non effugiam manus 
                              〈◊〉
                           . Sed melius est mihi abs
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            opere incidere in manus hominum, 
                              〈◊〉
                            peccare in conspectu domini. That is to saye: Alas I am in trouble on euery side, for yf I committe this dede it is death to me, and if I doo

it not, I cannot escape your handes. Well it is better for me to fall in to the hands of mē, than to synne in the syghte of GOD.
                     We wyll passe ouer the honorable auncyent father Eleazar mencyoned of in the seconde boke and the. vi. chapiter of the Machabees. We wyl not stay vpon the. vii. brethern and theyr mother, spoken of in the. ii. boke and seuenth chapiter of the Machabees, of whiche one of the chyldren sayde. Parati sumus magis mori. 
                              
                                 
                              
                              quam
                            patrias deileges preuaricari. That is to saye: We are redy rather to die, then to breake or transgresse the lawes of God which oure fathers kepte. But of late dayes, in the tyme of oure pestiferous scisme, the new broched brethern, rather woulde tumble to hel headelonge, then they would doo as the catholyke Churche from Chrystes tyme hetherto hath done, concernynge the lawes of GOD, and the rytes of the sayde catholyke churche. And yet forsoth they wyll chaleng martyrdome, but those seuen innocentes doo condempne them in this case. And thys nowe haue ye heard howe ye should kepe the commaundementes of GOD to his pleasure, firste in kepyng them all and euery of them, and not in kepyng some, and to offende in the other. Secōdly in kepyng them with a ryght intention, whyche is for the loue of God, and eternall rewarde, whych is God hymselfe. And thyrdly in obseruyng the same with constancye and perseueraunce to the 
                           〈◊〉
                         of our lyfe. In which doinge, ye kepe 
                           〈◊〉
                         to the pleasure of God, and to your eternall 
                           〈◊〉
                         & withoute

kepyng of them ye neyther can please him, nor haue lyfe euerlastyng, accordyng to Chrystes owne sentence and iudgement, when he sayd. Si uis ad 
                              〈◊〉

                           . That is to saye: 
                           〈◊〉
                         thou wylte entre to lyfe, kepe the commaundementes.
                     Nowe to come to speake of the thyrde parte or poynte of our diuision, made in the begynnynge of thys preface, it is to wytte, of the greuous paynes punishmentes, and afflictions that God in scrypture doth threaten and menace to be inflicted vpon such as breake hys commaundementes, ye shall vnderstand first that the trangressours of Goddes law, & commaundementes are generally accursed of gods owne mouth, as the Prophette Dauyd in the. 118. Psalme declarethe, sayinge: Maledicti qui declinant a mandatis tuis. That is to saye: Cursed be they which doo declyne or 
                           〈◊〉
                         from thy commaundementes. And of the particuler, sharpe, and dredfull scourges, punyshmentes, and plages, whiche do lyght vpon the trangressours of these commaundementes, ye may rede in the. 
                           〈◊〉
                         chapiter of Leuiticus, and in the. xxvii and. xxviii. chapiters of Deuteronomy. And howe that (to the terrible example of other) almyghtye God hath from tyme to tyme executed his Justyce vpon aswell pryuate men & women, as also vpon myghty rulers, prynces, kynges, and emperours, besydes thē vpon Townes, Cities, ye, & hole countryes and kyngedoms, in scourgyng, 
                           〈◊〉
                        , afflyetynge and plagynge them, for breaking & trangressing of his lawes & commaūdementes,

the scryptures most habundantly do testify. As that some were of the earth swalowed vp quicke euen vnto hell and euerlastynge payne, and that other some (yea fyne hole Cities) with fyre & brymestone, poured downe from heauen were quyte brent vp and consumed, and ferther that a greate number of chyldren by beares sent by God sodenly were deuoured, for theyr lewde and wycked behauioure, with very many other such lyke terrible examples in the Scryptures at large sufficientlye expressed, which were to longe, particulerlye here to rehearse, and are easye there to be founde. Wherefore to conclude thys thyrd parte, we aduyse all men to haue contynually before theyr eyes, that dreadeful saying of S. Paule in the. vi. to the Romaynes. Stipendia pecca timors That is to saye. The stipend or rewarde of synne is death. Meanyng thereby, not onelye here in thys worlde, temporall death of the body, but also after thys lyfe, death eternal & payne in hell fyre.
                     And as concernynge the fowerth and last part of our first proposed diuision, it is to wytte, of the great rewarde and blessynges which shall come to them that in such sorte as before we haue expounded kepe the lawes and commaundementes of allmightye God, fyrst ye shall note those comfortable words of almyghty God in ye twentyth chapiter of Exodus, where he sayth of hymselfe thus. Faciens misericordiam in millia, 
                              〈◊〉
                            qui diligunt me 
                              〈◊〉
                            custodiunt precepta mea. That is to saye: Doynge mercy vnto thousands, to thē that loue me, & kepe my commaūdements.

And agayne in the. xxvi. of Leuiticus, he sayth, Si in prae ceptis meis ambulaueritis. & mandatamea custodieritis & feceritis 
                              〈◊〉
                           : dabo uobis pluuias temporibus suis, & terragignet germen suum, & pomis Arbores replebuntur. That is to say. If ye walke in my preceptes, and kepe my commaundementes and do them. I wil geue vnto you raynes in their due seasons: and the earth shall bringe furth her sede, and the trees shalbe replenished with fruite. In the. vi. chapiter also of Ecclesiasticus, it is wrytten, Cogitatum tuum habe in praeceptis dci, & in māc datis illius maxime assiduus esto, & ipse dabit ubi cor, & 
                              〈◊◊〉
                            dabitur tibi, That is to say: Haue thy thought in the preceptes of God, and be thou contynuallye occupied in his commaundementes and he will geue the a harte, and desyre of wysedome shalbe geuen to thee. Whych thinge is well proued by the testimonye of kynge Dauyd, who sayth of hym selfe in his. cxviii. psalme. Super senes intellexi, quia mandata tua qu. esiui. That is to saye: I haue had vnderstanding more then the olde men, because I haue soughte thy commaundementes.
                     And here omittynge infinite testimonyes of scripture, whiche declare, that not onely in this worlde, all helth, welth, and prosperitie is promised to the kepers and obseruers of Goddeslaw, and commaundementes, but also after this lyfe acrowne of immortalitie, and eternall ioye and blysse: we wyl here conclude

repeatynge agayne one shorte sentence of oure sauioure Chryste in the. xix. of Mathewe, wher he saieth thus. Si uis ad uitam ingredi, serua mandata. That is to saye. Of thou wylt entre into lyfe, kepe the com maundementes.

                        HAVINGE in this matter fyrst set forth vnto you the number of Goddes com maundements, that perfectly knowinge them ye maye bothe kepe them your selues, and also of chrysten charytye teache them to other, especyally of your family and household. And hauyng in the pre face of these commaundementes declared vnto you, what is the lawe and commaundemente of GOD, howe also the commaundementes of God muste be obserued, what punyshmentes God dothe manace & inflicte to the breakers or

hys boke hathe bene promysed vnto you, and for the better knowledge of this matter, ye shal vnderstand that thys doctryne of commaundementes conteyned in Dicalogo, that is to saye in tenne sentenses, was fyrste wrytten in two tables of stone, by the hande and power of almyghtye God, and delyuered vnto Moyses in a mountayne Called Sauai, to be declared vnto the Israelites or Iues, whiche were forbydden to come vppe to the Mountayne, and were beneth standynge at the foote of the hyl, the cyrcumstaunce of whyche matter is wonderfull large and notablye sette fourthe in

that was a hygh place in whych the lawe was gyuen, and also there was fyre. In the olde testamēt the lawe was gyuen vpon a grosse and earthly moun tayne whyche was called Syna, or Synai, takyng the name of a preceptes or commaundemente, in asmuche as the preceptes or commaundementes were geuen in it, to brydle and kepe vnder the headye rebellions and styffenecked people, not suffered to come vp to it, but commaunded to be vnder it. In the newe testamente the lawe is gyuen in dede in a mountaine but yet not called Sina or Syani, but called Siō, whych by interpretation doth sounde or sygnifye a beholdynge place, from whense al

And therefore the blessed Apostles beynge, in theyr conclaue, in the sayde mounte Syon, were of one mynde and quyet, prayinge together and lokynge for the heauenly gyft promysed before vnto them by Chryst. In the geuing of the lawe in Mount Syna, there was fyre, lyghte nynge, and thunder, and dyuerse other thynges very terrible, to signifye the cheife strength of the lawe to consist in terror, and fearefulnes, accordynge wherevnto Saynte Paule in the forthe chapyter to the Romaynes, doth saye Lexiram oper. 
                              〈◊〉
                           . That is to saye:
                     The lawe doth worke or brynge fourthe wrathe. In the gyuynge of the lawe in Mounte Syon, ther was a vehemente spyryte or blaste, but yet bryngynge wyth it alacritie and Ioye, and a fyre

there was, but yet not brennyng the bodye, but lyght ninge the blynde harte or mynde of man, and kynde linge his slothful and dull will vnto goodnes, so that not by terror or feare compelled as in the olde lawe, but incited & moued by harty loue, he runneth in the waye of the commaundementes, forgettyng the thinges behinde, and stretchynge hym towarde the thinges beyng before hym, that pleasing God by kepyng his commaundemētes he may accordyng to christes promyse. Mathei Deeimo nono. entre into life and reygne wyth Chryste.
                     In the fyrste of these two tables there are conteyned in effecte all those thynges whiche we oughte to doo vnto god, and wherein we ought to be occupyed with god, that is to saye the very true seruyce of God aswell internall as externall. And in the seconde table are conteyned, all those thynges whych wee owe vnto our neyghboure, and howe wee on oure parte oughte to behaue oure selues to hym. And yet heare muste ye marke that thys seconde table dothe issue or comme from the fyrst table, so that the works of the seconde table cannot truelye be done wythoute the workes and dedes of the fyrst table. For then in dede we maye be sene ryghtly and well to loue our neyghboure, when wythout consyderation of anye priuate poffytte commynge vnto vs, and wythoute anye worldelye or carnall respectes, we do onely loue hym for Goddes sake, and doo embrace and cheryshe hym as oure owne selues, bycause that God, in whome is all oure hope and truste, and to whome in harte and

And as concerning the fyrste, that is to saye, feare, howe necessary

a part of oure secuyce & duety towardes God that is, Salomon in the. ix. chapiter of his prouerbs playnelye and breifely declareth, saying, Principium sapientiae timor domini, That is to saye. The begynnynge of wysedome, is the feare of God. And of this feare also our sauioure Chryste

                        , speaketh in the. xii of Luke, declaryng there that God chieflye and prin cipallye is to be dred and feared, where he sayth thus

But there is an other kynde or sorte of feare due vnto god, wher of the prophete Dauyd in hys. xviii, Psalme, speaketh saying: Timor domini sanctus, permanet in seculum seculi. That is to saye.

                     And as concernyng fayth, whiche is the seconde parte of our duetie towarde God, there is wryttē of it in the. ii. chapter of Ecclesiasticus, after thys sorte. Qui timetis dominum, credite ille, & non euacuabitur mercis uestra.

For whatsoeuer we loue aboue God, settynge oure myndes vpon it, more then we do vpō God, or for the loue of it, offending God truely we make that, for the tyme, oure God. As the couetous manne maketh his

                     Lette no manne aske councell of them, that vse false diuinations, or suche as take hede to dreames or chatterynge of byrdes. Let there be no wytche or enchaunter emongest you, or any that askethe counsel of them, that haue spyrytes, nor of southfayres, nor that seke the trougthe of them that be deade, for god abhorreth all these thynges. Fynallye al kynde of vnfaythfulnes, vnpacientnes, murmuryuge and grudginge againste God specially in tyme of aduersitie, is a manifest and open breakyng of thys commaundement. And though this much might seme sufficyente for declaration of this firste commaundemente, yet are there other thynges appertaynynge to the fuller vnderstandinge hereof, not to be of vs omytted. As firste to declare what is ment by the wordes, before me, expressed in thys commaundemente. The exposition whereof in fewe wordes is thys, because nothynge can be so secrete, pryuye, close or hid from god but that it is sene with his moste persinge eyes, who (as the prophete Dauyd in the seuenth Psalme doth say) is the sercher of manes harte, and of hys inward

lustes, and desyres, and who also eternally is presente euerye where, therefore we maye not eyther in dede worde, or in anye secrete thoughte, at anytyme, or in any place: committe or offende agaynst hys honoure and omnipotente maiestie. For yf we soo do, it is vndoutedlye done, before him, that is to saye, in hys sight, who wyll not faile, for oure so doynge, to power his wrathe and his indignation vpon vs. Secondlye you shall note that God begynneth his lawe or commaundementes at hym selfe, beyng the most worthy and wythoute all comparison, and afterward he procedeth to instructe vs in our duety toward our neigh boure. Thyrdely ye shall note, both touchyng thys, & the reste of the commauudementes, that they are for the mooste parte vttered in the negatyne and not in the affirmatyue speache, not onely for that the negatyue dothe bynde euer and for euer, and is more vehement then is the affirmitiue. But also for that the negatyue doth accustomably requyre, on the contrary syde the affirmatyue, and denying or forbyddynge doth imploye in it a contrary commaundement: and therefore in these precepts it is not alonelye to be considered what is forbydden and denyed vnto vs, but also what God (thoughe therein he 
                           〈◊〉
                         not vse for mail or expresse wordes) doth requyre in the contrary of vs. And therefore where in thys precepte in the negatyue speach it is sayde. Thou shalt not haue straunge Goddes before me There must by this negatyue, be vnderstande the affyrmatyue, that is to saye. Thou shalt onelye haue me for thy true God.
                     
                        And in dede yf this precepte hade bene 
                           〈◊〉
                         and made in an affyrmatyue speache onelye, then the Samaritanes woulde haue gathered here of some excuse, who thoughe they worshypped one God, yet withall they worshypped manye Goddes to, as appeareth: 4. Begum. 17. Lyke wyse mighte the Iewes the gentylles, the heretykes, yea and the noughetye persons of the world, who thoughe they dyd and doo knowe one to be God, as Saynte Paule in the fyrste chapiter of his epystle to the Romaynes doth testifye, yet they did not honor and worshyppe him duelye as they ought to doo, as Saynt Paule in the sayde epystle and chapiter doth euydently declare.
                     And fynallye ye shall vnderstand and note, that where thys fyrst

                         anye Image, for you must vnderstand, yt betwene an Image (whyche is a name of reuerence) and an Idol (whych alwayes wyth the good is abhomynable) there is a very notable and greate difference: and the difference is thys. The Drygynales, fyrste formes and parentes of Idoles, to represent by, are very vntrue and clerelye false, for hauynge the inscriptyon of goddes (as for example of god Iupiter of god Mars and of suche lyke) they are in dede the pyctures of deuyles, and not of Goddes (god being but one) and (as the Prophete sayth Psalme. cx) Ommes dii

                            demonia. That is to say. All the goddes of the Gentyles are dyueles and yet with foly she erronyous people one taken for God Iupyter, one for God Mars, and so forthe, all beynge false. But the origynales first formes or paternes of the ymages, to represente the very thynge signified by them, are faythfull and true thys of Chryst, that of Chrystes Mother, an other of Sayncte Ihon Baptiste, and of euerye Sayncte a peculier Image, and soo to be called, because in dede there is a Chryst to haue an Image of, and lykewyse there is a mother of Chryst to haue of her an Image, and so of the rest, which to be so, we can not deny, excepte we wyll falselye saye, that there is no Chryste at all, nor no mother of Chryste nor yet no Sayncte. And that the catholyke churche hathe alwayes euen from the begynnynge, put greate dyfference betwene an Idol and an Image, vtterlye abhorryng and

wyll consyder what the churche dyd in thys matter aboute eyght hundred yeares agoo: at whyche tyme there was greate controuersye in thys matter wher vpon the cheife aud most learned men of al christendome dyd assemble

                         of all partes of the worlde to the cytye of Nyce in the countrye of Bethinia, beyng in Asye the

                         by the auncient fathers, whyche were before those dayes, dyd conclude that the vse of ymages in the catholyke Church is in no wise repugnaunt, wich the seconde commaundemente, it is to wytte, Thou shalt not make to the any gra uen thynge. &c. Yea and further to open and confyrme thys poynte, they also dyd then playnelye declare that in the olde testament were manye ymages and lykenesses or similitudes, not onely wythout the tabernacle and the temple, but also wythin the same made, had, and vsed by Goddes expresse commaunde mente: at whyche assembly also was clearely proued that there is a greate difference betwene the Images, whych Chrysten men do vse in theyr churches, & the Idols vnto whych the Gentyles and some times also the Iewes them selues dyd geue Gods honoure and worship. And that the ymages vsed in the churche were sygnes and memorialles of Chryste and the holy saynctes. And that the reuerence whych is done before the ymages, is not done or mente to be done to the wood, stone, syluer, gold, or any other suche stuffe or matter where of anye Image is made, no 
                           〈◊〉
                         yet to the workemanshyppe or beautiful shape thereof as

though there were any suche worthynes or dignytye therin, but we beholdynge the pyctures or Images, myght be brought thereby in remembraunce of them, theyr lyues, doynges, and deathes, whose Images they are, or whome they represente, and there vpon imitate, and dilygentlye folowe to our power, all the same: as when we ernestlye and intentiuely doe behold the Image of the Crucifixe, we then haue good occasyon to remembre, the incarnation, lyfe, passyon, and deathe of our Sauiour Chryste. And when we beholde the Image of the blessed Uyrgyn Mary mother of Chryst, we then are styrred vp to thinke in our hartes how that blessed mother beinge of our mortal humayne nature, dyd in her wombe conceyue (by a meanes far passyng the capacitie of manne or angell, to comprehende) our sauyour Chryst being bothe god and man, and that therfore we do prayse, magnyfye, and extolle her aboue all creatures, visible and inuisible: and that for lyke reason and cause, the Images of the Prophetes apostles 
                           〈◊〉
                         & other 
                           〈◊〉
                         and derely beloued seruauutes of God, are certayne sygnes, by whych as in a glasse, we behold their godlye conuersation, lyfe, affliction, and deathe that by the beholdynge of theyr Images we may styrre vppe and renewe in vs that affection, and loue which we haue to the very Saynctes, for theyr godlynes and vertues sakes. And besydes thys in the sayd assēblye or general counsayle, thys similitude folowyng was then thoughte mete, to open and declare some what the matter and the maner of Images in the Churthes of Chrysten men, wyth the vse thereof. That

                        
                           〈◊〉
                         as when we do receyue letters from an emperoure, a kynge or greate prynce, we do kysse the seale of the sayde letters not for the waxe sake, but geuing therby our dewe honour and reuerence to the emperour kynge or prynce whose letters we doo receyue. Euen so when Chrysten men are before an Image, (as for example before the ymage of the crucifix) ther knelyng, or kyssyng the same hauynge in theyr heartes, and myndes godly intention and affection, they doe not entende or mynde thereby to adore or worshyppe the very Image selfe, being of wood stone

                         mouldered a way, for the oldenes of it, or other wyse beynge consumed or defaced they do regarde it nothynge at all, nor haue it in any estimation) but beholding the said Image of the Crucifix beyng as a seale, and a token or remembraunce of the passyon of Chryste, they are thereby admonished and 
                           〈◊〉
                         in remembraunce, to salute & adore him, who for alour sakes suffred death vpon she crosse, nayled and crucified, as the Image of thys

                        The same counsayle also hath this other example; that lyke wyse as when we do kysse the booke of the Gospels, we haue not suche affection, and loue, to the parchement, paper or letters made with ynke, as for theyr sakes to kysse the boke, but hauynge onelye respect to those holsome comfortable and holy sayinges whych are in the boke conteyned, do for that respect and for their sakes, with al our hole hartes & mindes kysse and embrace, the booke most ioyfullye. Euen so when we doo worshyppe the Images of Saynctes, we doo not worshyppe those outwarde shapes or fygures, but we do worshyppe the gyftes, graces, and vertues whiche god hath wrought in those saynctes whose Images they are: for we do prayse the godlynes of theyr lyues and styrre vp oure selues thereby, to imitate and folowe theyr fote steppes, and there withal we do make prayer vnto almyghty god that he wylbe mercifull and bountifull vnto vs, through the intercession and merites of them. And in dede we doe not speake to, nor praye vnto the Crosse of Christ, or the ymage of anye sayncte in thys wyse.

I reuerence also the holy Apostles, prophetes, and martyres, whiche do make intercession to God for me, that thorough their mediation, oure mooste benigne god may be merciful, & frely graunte vnto me remissyon of sinnes. For whyche cause I do honoure, and openlye adore also theyr Images, for this thinge beinge of the holy apostles deliuered vnto vs is not to be letten or bydden, but in all oure churches we erecte or set vp their Images.

                        . & was cured thereof by touchyng the hem of our sauiours garmet (as Marke in hys. v. chap. wytnesseth) there was an ymage of brasse erected, which was made according to the fourme and shape of Chryst, wearynge a longe garment, and that before the same ymage was sette direct ye the ymage of the sayde womā knelynge deuoutely and humblye holdynge vp her handes to the sayd ymage of Chryst, and that at the fete of Chrystes ymage a certen vnknowen herbe & of a straunge forme dyd growe, and that euer as it came in growing to touche the hem of the sayde longe garmente of Chryst, then had it the power and vertue to cure and remedy all maner of diseases. Further the fathers at the sayde seuenth counsayle assembled, doo in the actes and recordes of the sayde counsayle testify and re

corde that thys matter of ymages was entreated of and debated in the syxt generall counsayle, kepte, and holden at Constantinople, declarynge howe that in the sayde syxt generall counsayle, it was defyned and determined that it was a chrysten vsage to haue the Image of the crucifixe, to the intente that hereby we shoulde be broughte in remembraunce of Chryste, whych toke awaye the synnes of the worlde, And at length the sayde seuenthe generall counsayle, concludyng doth saye, that the honour and reuerence geuen to Images is not that kynde of honoure which is cal led Latria. That is to saye. Godes honoure. whyche onely is due to God, and muste of vs creatures be geuen to none other, but onelye to our creature, but it is another kynde of honoure done in remembraunce of theyr vertues, godlynes, and conuersation, and for other godlye respectes before expressed. And thys determination as concernyng Images, wyth all other thynges then and there agreed vpon, was of all and euery of the Patryarches, and catholyke byshoppes then and there beynge, aswell of the Greke, as of the Latyne Churche (beynge in all aboue three C.

to saye: Euerye thynge whatsoeuer ye doo in worde or in dede, do ye all thynges in ye name of oure Lorde Iesus Chryste, gyuynge thankes to GOD and the rather by or throughe Chryste. Whiche rule who that foloweth in the vse of these Images (as the hole Catholyke Churche, heretofore hath, and no we doth) can not iustlye, nor ought not to be reprehēded or misliked, nor rekoned to haue don a mysse, or to breake thys seconde commaū

For whyche causes, ymages maye be set in the churche, and oughte not to be despised, but to be vsed reuerentlye, althoughe we be forbydden to geue goodes hououre vnto theym.

knowe and vnderstande that suche thynges be not, nor ought to be done to the ymage it selfe, but to God & in his honor, although it be done afore the ymage whether it be of Chryst, of the Crosse or of our Ladye or of anye other Saynte. Agayne thys commaundement dyd offende generally before the commynge of Chryste, al gentylles, and people that were not of the nation of Israell, For they dyd geue goddes honoure vnto Idolles, and worshypped false godes some one some another, of the whyche forte there was a greate number. For besydes theyr common goodes, euerye countrye euery cytye or towne, euerye house and familye, had theyr prayer and peculyer gooddes, where of is much mention made in authors, both Chrysten and heathen. And these gentilles thoughe they hadde knowledge of a very god, yet (as saynct Paule sayth Rom.

So lykewyse in thys commaundement beynge also a negatyue, there is a prohibition to take the name of thy Lorde GOD in vayne, and therein is imployed thys affyrmatiue that we must take and vse the name of God ryghtely, and reuetently.

And openlye I saye, when the true ministers of Goddes worde doo preache and declare it syncerelye, and 
                           〈◊〉
                        , to the edifyenge of the people, in fayth, hope, and charitie, so that the glorye of God, and the verytye of hys worde maye be lyuely and frutefullye set forthe to the people After whych sorte Chryste dydde saying, (Ioannis. 17) I haue claryfied or glorified thee (O father) vpon the earth, And shortly after agayne, sayinge in the sayde chapter. I haue made open, or decla

red thy name vnto men, &c. And after the lyke sorte Saint Paule dyd sanctify the name of Chryste, (Chryste so testifyeng and bearyng wytnesse of him) Actuum. ix. where he sayeth. Vas electionis est mihi ut portet nomen meum coram gentibus, & regibus, & filijs Israel. That is to say.
                     He (meanynge and speakyng of Paule) is vnto me a vessell of election, or choyse to carye or beare my name before the Gentyles, and kynges, & chyldren of Israell.
                     The fourth sorte or maner of ryght vsyng and takynge of the name of God, is by adoration, and worshyppynge, or honourynge it, not onelye by inwarde, and mentall but also by outewarde and external ado ration. And of this sorte and maner, S. Paule in the seconde chapyter of his Epistle to the Phylypyans, doth meane sayinge. Dedit illi nomen quod est supra omne nomen,

                     The. v. sorte or maner of the ryghte vsynge, and takynge of the name of God, is by inuocation. And of

That is to saye. I wyll call vpon oure prayseable, or laudable Lorde, and I shal be safe from myne enemyes. I wyll inuocate, or call vpon our Lorde in my tribulation, and I wyll crie to my God, and he wyll heare my voice from his holy temple. Like wyse is it wrytten Psal. 4 7.

                     The nynthe or last sorte of the right vsing and takynge of the name of God, is whan we beynge constrayned (and especiallye whan we be put thereto by a magystrate, or offycer, hauinge

                         in aucthoritie) do swere by the name of God (makynge him by oure so doinge, witnesse of the thing

                         we do swere) the necessitie or weyghtynesse of the cause, requiring the same. And this our othe, besydes iudgement, must haue euer concurryng and annexed wt it (as god hym selfe by his prophet Ieremye doth testify & cōmaund) veritye and iustyce. For in the, iiii. chap of Ieremy it in wrytten thus, Et iurabis, Viuit dominus, in ueritate, in iudicio & iustitia, That is to saye: And thou shalt swere, oure Lorde lyueth, in trueth, in iudgement, and in iustyce. Whereby appeareth, that the first consydera tion of our othe muste be the Trueth, whych ought to be the cheife cause, and 
                           〈◊〉
                         foundation of our othe, that by such our othe taken, vntruthe (whyche is the worke of the deuyll) maye be destroyed, & the truth be broughte to lyghte, and opened. The seconde consideration in an othe is tl, at it be geuen in iudgemēt, and whan I doo say in iudgement, I do not only meane how yt it is sometymes, and many tymes geuē before a iudge, but also I do meane yt when and whersoeuer

an othe is gyuen, the sayde othe must be geuen with a greate dyscretyon and delyberation, that is to saye, whan we come to take our othe, we muste fyrste consider the trouths of the mater, and then cōsyder whether the weightines or necessitie of the matter doo requyre an othe, with the due circūstaunce of the tyme, and of the place, and withall, whan we doo gyue an othe, to consider whether we be hable, lawefullye to performe it or no, not omyttynge to consider, whether anye vncharytable or partiall affection, prouoke and induce vs thervnto. The thyrde consyderatyon to be had in an othe, is that we swere not but for Iustice sake. Equytye, honesty, and Ryghtewysenes.
                     And he that duely vseth these three consyderations, whan

He shall not doo euill or synne in takynge, or gyuynge the sayde othe, either in matters of religion, or ells in other worldelye affayres. Forasmuch as by suche a nedefull othe, Truthe, Peax, Concorde, and Iustyce, are maynteyned, and doubtefulnes, or

And the same Apostle hym selfe (Galathi. i) doth swere say ing Quae autem scribo uobis, ecce coram deo, quia nō mentior. That is to saye. The thynges whyche I doo wrytte vnto you beholde before God that I lye not. Agayne the same Apostle (ii. Cor. i) like wise swearing doth saye. Ego autem testem deum inuoco in animam mcam, &c. I indede do cal God vnto witnesse vpon my soule. &c. And agayne (ii. Corin. ii. he sayeth. Deus &

Seuenthly all they whych do disho neste or dyshonor the name of God, eyther their owne selues doynge it, or elles not agayne sayinge and rebu kynge other the doers. The commen flatterers also whych frame theyr toungue to talke as lykethe theyr lordes and Maysters, thoughe it be in verye balsphemy and horrible vyce. Preachers also, suche as onely be men pleaseres, and doo omytte to tell the people theyr faultes, such also as beyng not lawefully called and sent do thruste them selues in, to preach the word of God, yea and they whyche wraste and mangle the scrypture with vntrue and vncatholike expositions. They also that do deryde the holye mysteryes and sacramentes of Chryste. And briefely al they that ether doo thynke or teache otherwyse then the Catholyke churche (beynge decyued by succession from the Apostles vnto our tyme) hathe thoughte and taughte, or ells vnder the pretense of preachyng Goddes worde, do in theyr sermons and collations sowe dyssensyon, tumultes. and rebellion, especially agaynste theyr gouernours, do greuously abuse the name of God, and therefore worthy of greate punyshmente. The like pu nishmeut or rather greater the periured persones are worthy to haue, and they also (moste offendynge and worthye muche punyshmente) who in theyr common take, by an vngodly vsage, and leude custome, doo at euery other worde swere, eyther by god or his deathe or other such lyke greatly blaspheming ye name of god And who so lyst to haue this matter of swering fulli & lernedly

examined, dyscussed, and declared, Lette hym repare to the chapyter, Et si Christus de iureiurando, & ther at length he shall fynde howe the sayinge of Chryste, Mathew v and the saying of Saynt Iames cap. v. wyth other places, that seme to forbydde swearinge, maye stande with other places of Scrpture, that do suffer and allowe the gyuynge of othes.
                     They (fynallye do offend) and that very greuouse lye agaynste thys commaundemente, who do breake theyr vowes made to almyghty God. For it is wrytten in the xxiii. chapyter of Deuternomye after thys maner. Whan thou haste made a vowe vnto thy lorde God, thou shalte not slacke or make delaye to perfourme or paye it. And in the fyfte of Ecclesiasticus, it is wrytten thus. Multo melius est non uouere, quam post autem promissa non reddere. That is to say.
                     It is great deale better not to make a vowe then after the vowe made, not to accomplishe or do the thynges promysed. And because amongest other thynges whych christen men doo vowe to God, one is chastitie, you shall knowe, concernynge the same, that from the very beginnynge of Christes churche, suche kynd of vowe was taken, iudged, and estemed for lawefull, honest, and godly, and that not onelye by the determination of man but cheifely also by the determination of our Sauyoure Chryste hym selfe, as appeareth in the .xix. chapyter of Saynte Mathewe. And therfore they whyche of late contrary to theyr vowes dyd take women vnto them, vnder the name, and coloure of Matrymonye, haue

                        , from all bodelye sernyle laboure, that they were wonte to do. Thys rest & quiet nes, with the sayde Hebrues, or Iewes, was but the rest of the body, insomuch that yf an Hebreue or Iew dyd neuer so muche occupye, or exercyse his mynde in carynge, or thinkynge vpon worldely busynes, yet yf he dyd not there with exercyse and occupye hys body with all, he was accompted to kepe the letter of thys commaundement. But wyth vs chrysten men, there is requyred a greater perfection in thys behalfe, for we muste besydes the due obsering of the sabbote in abstainyng our selues from bodily laboure, haue also oure myndes quiet and free from all suche cares and gyue our sayde myndes intierly and holy vnto god, & the contemplation of godlye thynges, not onelye prynatelye

And as in ye churches we muste in the tyme of dyuyne seruyce on the sabbothe daye thus occupy oure selues deuoutlye, So in all other places, durynge the tyme of the sayde sabbothe day, we absteining from bodely labour, and other oure

And albeit thys commauddemente when it was fyrste gyuen to the Iewes, dyd fyrste bynde them, and theyr successoures, to kepe holye the Saturday, beyng then taken and accepted for theyr Sabotte daye, yet to vs chrysten men the Sondaye is oure Sabbote daye, called in latten Dominica dies, and so termed and named by Saynte Ihon, in the fyrste chapyter of his Apocalypse, or reuelatyon, wher he sayeth.

                        Sciendum est fratris charissmi, &c.

                        Most derely beloued brethern, it is to be knowen that therefore, of our holye fathers, it is ordened and commaunded to chrysten men, that in the solempnyties of Saynctes, and moste especiallye on the Sondayes, the sayde chrysten men shoulde take reste and cease from earthlye busynes, that they myghte be the more redyer, and prompter, to the dyuyne seruyce, as not hauynge anye impediment, or incommodytye whych myght staye, or withdrawe them from it, and myght leaue or forsake, at that tyme, earthlye care or thought, to the intente that more easely they myghte take

thynge oure lorde hymselfe by hys prophet. Psalmo. 45 dothe saye. Be you styll or quyet, and do you consyder or see that I am GOD. But they who beyng entangled with diuerse cares, and busynesses, doo dyspyse thys sentence, or sayinge of God, and wyll not gyue, or aplye them selues, to dyuyne contemplation, I feare me, that in the iudgmente to come when they shall knocke at the gate of our lorde and requyre to be opened, our Lord will aunswere, and saye, verelye I saye vnto you, I knowe you not departe from me al you that do worke iniquitie.
                        And suche as nowe do neglecte to seke God, are thē of hym to be refused. Therefore my brethren, let it not be paynefull, or greuouse vnto you, vpon the Sondayes, and vpon the festyuall dayes of the Sayntes, to gyue youre studye vnto the deuyne seruyce. The apostles in dede, and the apostolicall men, dyd therefore decree, or determyne, the sondaye to be kept, wyth deuout solempnitie, for that oure redemer dyd vpon that daye, ryse frome the deade. And that day therefore, is called in Latyn. Dominicus. That is to saye. The daye of our Lorde. That in it we absteyning from earthely workes, and the enticemētes or flatterynge pleasures of the world, may bende our selues to diuine seruyces onely, giuing I saye to thys daye honoure, and

And therefore the holye doctoures of the Church haue decreed, or determyned, to translate, or brynge all the glory of the iudaicall Sabbote (kept on the saturedaye) into the sayde sonday, that we myght celebrate in the veritie, or truthe, that whyche they dyd kepe in fygure, for then shalbe our true rest, when the resurrection shall be done, and perfecte rewarde, in bodye and soule together: therefore (brethren) lette vs obserue, or kepe the sondaye or daye of our Lorde, and let vs sanctifye it, as it was commaunded vnto thē of the olde tyme concernynge the Sabbot, the lawe maker saying (Exodi. 20) From euenyng to euenynge you shall celebrate youre Sabbottes. Let vs marke, or see, that oure reste by not vayne, or frutlesse, but that we, beinge fequestred, or separated frome all rurall workes, and frome all busynes, doo from the euenynge of the Saturdaye, vntill the eueninge of the Sondaye, gyue our selues to dyuyne seruyce onelye, and after such sorte we do duly or well satysfye the Sabbote of oure Lorde. Oure

lorde saying. Ye shall do no worke in it. Therefore let euery one to whome it is possible, come to the euensonge, and noctunall seruyce, and let hym there in the assemblye of the churche, praye to God, for hys synnes, and he that canne not thys do, let hym at the leaste, praye in hys house, and let hym not neglecte, to perfourme hys vow, and to yelde the dew or taske of hys seruyce vnto God. And in the daye lette none separate, or absente, hymselfe, from the holy celebration of Masses, nor let any remayne idle at home, whē other doo go to the churches, nor occupye

Submyt your selues to euery creatur, or ordinaunce of mā, for our lordes sake, whether it be to king as one that precelleth, vnto or gouernouresor rulers, as being sent of hym, to the punishmēt of euil doers, and the commēdation, or praise of the good.

And as concernyng the duetie of the seruaunte to the mayster, therof S. Paule speaketh, Ephe. vi. saing in thys maner. Ye seruauutes, be ye obediēt vnto your carnall maysters, wt feare & tremblynge, in singlenes, or simplicitie of your hart, as vnto Christ, not seruing in the eye syghte, or presence onely, as men plesers but as the seruauntes of Chryste, doyng the wyll of God, from the harte, wyth good wyl, doing your seruice as vnto God our Lord, and not vnto men. The like herof he hath also, in the thyrde cha. to the Collossenses: and in his seconde chapiter to Tite, he doth say thus.
                     
                     
                        Teache seruauntes to be obedyent vnto theyr maysters, pleasynge them in all thynges, not contraryeng them, not deceyuyng or defraudyng, but in all thynges, shewynge good faythe, that they maye sette furthe the doctrine of God our sauioure in al thinges

                     Thexposition or declaration of the sixte commaundement which is.
                     
                        Thou shalt not kyll.
                     
                     ENtendyng nowe consequently to declare vnto you thys syxte commaunde ment, we thynke it good, fyrst of all to note vnto youe, howe aptelye and in howe dewe place it foloweth immedi atlye vpon those goynge before, for in the commaundementes of the fyrst table, we are taught and instructed of our hole duetye towardes god whyche of all dutyes'is pryncypall at mannes handes required, and in the fyrst commaundement of the seconde table (whyche is nowe last expounded vnto you) we are taughte oure duetye towardes oure patentes both naturall, spirituall, Cyuyll, and other, to whome next vnto God, before al other men we ought to haue respect to perfourme our dutyes. And in this syxte, and the fower other that doe folowe, we are instructed, & warned that by no maner of meanes, we hurte or endamage our neygheboure. And bycause of all hurtes and displesures that maye of man to man be done, the greatest in some dewe respecte, is murder therefore or all hurtes that thyng is in the seconde table, fyrste and chyefelye forbydden vs in these wordes Thou shalte not kyll. In whyche wordes we are not onelye restrayned from Actuall murther, and vnlawefull kyllynge of the Bodye, but also we are forbidden from commytting the same

in worde or, thought yea and all the meanes leadyng or disposyng vs towardes the same, as malice, wrath enuye, disdayne, and other lyke euyl affections of the harte, and as they are prohibited so also is all sclaunder backebytyng, scoldynge, bannyng, raylyng, skornynge, or mockynge, and all other euyll behauiour of our tounge, agaynste our neyghboures, which all be forbydden by thys commannemente, as beynge the rotes and occasiōs of murder and other bodely hurt.
                     And by the rule of contraryes (spoken of before) lyke as these thynges are forbidden and prohybyted vnto vs, soo are theyr contraryes implyed and commaunded to be fulfylled and perfourmed of vs. It is to wytte. To loue our neyghboures lyfe and healthe wyth all our hartes, and with oure tonges to wyshe the same, and wyth our actes and dedes, to maynetayne and defend it. Of thys commaundement, and the duetye of vs chrysten men by the same requyred, our sauyour Chryste dothe speake in the fyfte of Mathewe sayinge. You haue harde how it was sayd vnto them of the olde tyme. Thou shalt not kyll, he that kyllethe shalbe in danuger of

                        , but I say vnto you, that euery one whyche is angry with his brother shalbe in daunger of iudgement, and he that sayeth to hys brother Racha shalbe in daunger of Counsayle, and he that sayethe vnto his brother thou foole, shalbe in staunger of hell fyre.

By these wordes of oure Sauyour Christe ye do vnderstande that hatred wrath, and Enuy, are as gretlye forbydden, and as greuoussye punyshed in vs Chrysten men, as was emongeste the Jewes verye bludshed and murder. For he that is wrathe or angri agaynste his neygheboure in hys harte and desyre, doth kyll him. And here doo you consyder well the wordes of thys precepte, for God dothe not saye, thy hand shall not kyll, or thy sworde shall not kyll, or thy gonne, or thy Crosbowe shall not kyll, or commyte murder, but he sayeth Thou shalt not kyll, That is to saye. Thou thy selfe, what soeuer thou arte, and which is properlye thyne, and of the as all the partes of thy body all thy inwarde thoughtes, thy affection thy wordes and thy dedes, shall not kyll. But some man maye heare saye, whye then, what shalbe done with theues, traytours eyther agaynst God, or theyr Prynce, and other suche wycked offenders, shall they not, nor maye they not lawefullye be putte to death.

                              〈◊〉
                            qui acceperint gladium, gladio peribunt. That is to say: Al they that take the sworde, shall peryshe wyth

And all that we hytherto haue spoken, is specyally by vs ment, of suche dammage, as by our woordes, thoughtes, or dedes, maye come to oure neyghboures body: but because the soule, beynge the cheyfe parte of man, dothe incomparablye

                         the bodye, therfore ye shall here note, that, by thys commaundement we are muche more forbydden to kyll or murder our neyghboures soule: whiche kynde of murder and slaughter of the soule, they doo commyt, who by pernytious, heretycall, and vngodlye doctryne, or by euyll counsayle, seduce the soule of theyr neyghboure, causynge it thereby to dye euerlastyngly in hell. And speciallye they herein doo offend, who not onely in theyr lyfe tyme, with theyr teachynge by mouthe, do infect theyr hearers, but wyth theyr moost venemous bokes lefte behynde them, doo styng to death the soules of as manye, as by the reading therof doo consente to theyr deuelyshe doctriue, and so long as such theyr bookes or wrytynges doo remayne, infectynge other, so long doth the dampnation of the aucthours of suche bookes, and heresyes, continuallye

more and more increase. The example whereof is put speciallye concernyng the dampnable and pernicyouse heresy of Arrius, the payne of whom shal not be fully determinate, vntyll the daye of Iudgement, but euer styll doth and shall vntyl that daye, increase more and more. And here is not to be omytted, that they also are manquellers, and moste myserably, and lamentably offende agaynst thys commaundement, who in worde, thought, or dede, desperatly doo murder them selues. And hauynge thus declared vnto you three seuerall kyndes of murder, forbydden by

                         commaundement, it is to wyt, the murderynge of our neyghbours body, the murderyng of hys soule and fynally of the murder wherby one doth kyll hym selfe, it shalbe conuenient to recyte here vnto 
                           〈◊〉
                         the terrible paynes whiche are in sondry places of Scripture, manaced for murders, and vpon seuerall murderers. And the fyrst shalbe taken furthe of the. iiii. of Genesis, where it appeareth that whan Cayn hadde murdered hys brother Abell, almyghtye GOD sayd vnto hym in thys maner. 
                           〈◊〉
                         voyce of thy brothers bloude, doeth crye vnto me frome the earth, wherefore thou shalte be accursed vpon the earth, who hath opened her mouth, and receyued thy brothers bloude of thy hande: when thou shalte laboure or tyll the earthe, it shall not geue to the her fruytes. Thou shalte be a wanderer and vagabunde vppon the earth. And in the. ix. also of Genesis it is thus writtē
                        
Whosoeuer shal shed the bloude of man vpon the earth, his bloude shalbe shedde, for man is made to the symilitude of God and in the, xxi, of Exodus, almyghtye God doth saye. He that shall strike a man, willinge to 
                           〈◊〉
                         him, shall dye the death.
                     Moreouer in the thyrde booke of the kynges, and the. xxi. Chapyter it is wrytten, howe that when kynge Achab by the deuelyshe counsayle of his wyfe Iefabel had procured the death of Naboth for couetousnes of hys vyneyarde, god sent the prophet Elias vnto hym, and bad hym saye these wordes.
                     Thys doth the Lorde say: Thou hast killed yea, and moreouer thou haste taken possessyon. And shortly after foloweth howe God bad hym saye. In this place in the whiche the dogges haue lycked the bloude of Naboth, they shall lycke thy bloude, and shortly after there foloweth Thus sayth the Lorde, I wyll brynge vpon the euyll or miserye, and will cutte downe they posteritie, aud wyll destroy of Achabes, euery one that pysseth against the wall. &c.
                     And touchynge wycked Iesabell hys wyfe, it there foloweth, Dogges shall eate Iesabell vnder the walles of Iesraell. And of Achab likewise is there sayde.

If Achab die in the citie the dogges shall eate him, and yf he die in the fielde, the fowles of the aire shall deuoure him. Moreouer in the seconde booke of the kynges, and the. xii. chapyter, almyghtye God sayde vnto kynge Dauyd by the Prophete Nathan in thys maner. Thou hast stricken with the sworde or killed Urias the Ethyte, and hast taken his wyfe to be thy wyfe and hast slayne him with the sworde of the chyldren of Ammon, wherefore the sworde shall not departe from thy house for euer.
                     These terrible threatnynges and punyshmentes ought to moue all men to be delygente and warye in obseruation of thys cōmaundement, and in no wyse eyther in thought, worde or dede, to commytte anye kyude of murder, beyng assured, that althoughe they may chaunce to escape the due ciuyll punyshement of magystrates, yet in no wyse shall they escape the greuous punishement at Goddes handes for suche theyr murder: yea they shalbe most well assured, that (vnlesse they, by due meanes, doo repente, and be reconcyled to God) they shall haue after thys lyfe (for theyr trangression) euerlastyng dampnation.
                  
                  
                     
                     ¶ Therposition or declaration of the seuenth Commaundement whyche is.
                     
                        Thou shalt not committe adulterye.
                     
                     AS the greatest iniurye whyche a man can do to hys neyghboure, is murder whereby he takethe awaye hys lyfe from him, so the next iniury or wronge is to vyolate, or to defyle hys neygheboures wyfe, whyche is become one fleshe wyth hym, throughe the sacramente of Matrimonye. And therefore in good order doeth here nowe folowe thys commaundemente. Thou shalte not commytte adultery. And thys commaundemēte our sauyoure Chryst hym selfe doth in dede expounde in the Gospell, as he dydde the syxte, teachynge vs in the fyfte of Mathew, that this commaundement not onely forbyddeth all outwarde adultery, commytted in dede, but also all inwarde occasyons of adulterye, as lecherous thoughtes, desyres, lustes of concupyscence, consentyuge in heart, and al other meanes enducynge therevnto. And here ye shal note yt although thys worde, adultery, doth sygnifie properly the vn lawfull comixion of a maryed man, with anye other woman, than wyth his owne wife, or els of a maried woman wyth anye other mā, then her owne 
                           〈◊〉
                         yet in 
                           〈◊◊〉
                        , it is not taken onely for that, but also for all maner vnlawefull copulation betwene man and woman, maried and vnmaried, and all maner of vnlawefull 
                           〈◊〉
                         of those partes whiche be

ordeyned for generation, whether it be by adulterye fornication, in crest or any other meanes.
                     And a man maye euen in lawefull matrymony with hys owne wyfe breake thys commaundemente, and lyue vnchaste, yf ye doo vnmeasurably or inordinatelye serue hys or her fleshly appetite or luste. And vpon such persones the deuyll hath power, as the aungell Raphael sayd vnto Thoby (Thoby. ix.) They that marye in such wise that they exclude GOD out of their hartes, and doo geue themselues vnto their owne carnall lustes, as it were an horse or a mule, whyche haue no reason, vpon suche personnes the deuyl hath power. Also all chrysten people ought hyghlye to regarde the obseruation of thys commaundement, consyderynge howe much God is displeased, and what vengeance he hath alwayes taken, and euer wyll take for the transgression of the same. For confyrmatyon whereof you shall vnderstande, that God in the tyme of Moyses lawe, commaunded that whosoeuer 
                           〈◊〉
                         adultery should be stoned to death. And that almygh ty God after the chyldren of Israell had commytted adultery wyth the women of Moab, and Madyan, commaunded fyrste, that the heades and rulers of the people shoulde be hanged, for that they suffered the people so to offende God. And afterwarde commaunded also euery man to sle hys neighboure, that had so offended. In so much that there was slayne of that people the number of. xxiiii. M. and 
                           〈◊〉
                         moo shoulde haue bene slayne, had not Phinees the sonne

of Eleazar the hygh preist, turned the indignation of God from the chyldren of Israell. For thys Phinees whan he sawe Zamry, cheife of the tribe of Simeon in the presence of Moyses, and all the people, goe vnto Cosby, a notable mans doughter of the Madyanities, to committe fornication wyth her, he arose from emongest all the multytude, and takynge a sworde in hys hande, went into the house wher they were, and thruste them bothe thoroughe the bellyes, whose feruente mynde and zeale, God dyd so muche allowe, that he dyd therfore bothe cease from the farther punishment of the Israelites, and also graunted to Phinees, and hys successours for euer, the dignitie of the highest preisthod.
                     Also the trybe and stocke of Beniamin was soo punyshed for the mayntenaunce of certayne persones of the Citie of Gaba, which had contrarye to thys commaundement, shamfullye abused a certayne mannes wyfe that of. xxv. M. and. vii. C. men of armes, there remayned on lyue but. vi. C.
                     Moreouer almyghtye God for the transgression of thys commaundement, caused brimstone and fyre to rayne downe from heauen, vpon all the

                         of Sodome and Gomor, and so distroyed the hole region, both menne, women, and beastes, and all that grewe vpon the earth, reseruyng onelye Loth & hys two doughters.
                     These terrible examples & many other lyke, almighty GOD dyd shewe in tymes paste, to the intente we should haue thē in oure contynual remēbraunce, and shulde euer stande in awe & feare so to offend god: for though be doth not presently punysh vs heare in this

                     Furthermore in thys commanudement not onelye the vyces before rehearsed be forbydden and prohybyted, but also the vertues contrarye to theym be requyred and commaunded, that is to saye. Fedelytpe and true kepyng of wedlocke, in them that be maryed, continence in theym that be vnmaryed: and generall ye in all persones, shamefastnes and chastenes not onelye of dedes, but of wordes and maners, coū
                        tenaunce and thought. And moreouer fastynge, temperaunce, watchynge, laboure, and all lawefull thynges that conduce and helpe to chastytye.
                     And therefore agaynst thys commaundemente they all doo offende who doo take anye syngle woman, or other manes wyfe, or that in theyr heartes doo couet or desyre vnlawefullye to haue them. For as Chryste sayth (Math, the fyste. Whosoeuer beholdeth a

                     They also doo offende agaynste thys commaundemente who doo abuse them selues, or anye other persones agaynst nature, or abuse theyr wyues in ye time of theyr menstruall purgation.
                     They also that doo nouryshe, stirre vp and prouoke themselues, or any other, to carnall lustes, and pleasures, songes, sightes, touchynges, gaye and wanton apparell, and lasciuious deckynge of themselues, or anye suche wanton, behauiour and intycementes.
                     And also all those, who do procure any suche acte, or that minister house, lycence, or place therevnto. And all counsaylers, helpers, & consenters, to the same, doe greuouslye offende, and do transgresse thys cōmaundement. Lykewise all they that auoyde not the causes hereof, so much as they conuenientlye may as surfeitinge, slothe, ydlenes, immoderate slepe, and company, of such, either men or women, as be vnchast, and euyll dysposed, they I saye be giltie of the trangression of thys commaundemente.

                     And here (not to omit oure accustomed maner in alledginge scripture for the confyrmatyon of assertyons made in thys booke) ye shall haue fyrste some testymonyes of holy scrypture, speakynge of thefte in generall, and afterwarde some other speakynge of certayne partyculer and speciall kyndes of theftes, and as concernynge thefte in generall, ye shall fynde thus wrytten in the fyrst chapiter of Ecclesyastycus.

And in the second chapter of Thoby we do reade howe that Thoby being blynde, and hea rynge the voyce of a kydde cryinge within hys house (whyche kydde hys wyfe had erned wyth her labour and he knowynge that he had no kydde of hys owne before dyd saye.

To whom wylyou runne for helpe, or where wyll you leaue your honour, that ye be not made stope vnder the bonde, and fall with them that are slayne. And in the, viii. chapter of Amos we do find this terrible sayinge. The ende is come vppon my people of Israel: I wyl no more geue my mind to come amongest thē, and the hingles of the temple doores shall make a krykynge sayth the lorde God, many shall die, and in euery place shalbe cast furth secretly.

blessynge shalbe vpon the heade of them that doo sell. And of another specyall kynde of thefte we doo reade in the, viii. of Iosue, a terrible example howe one Achan (whyche had contrarye to the commaundement of almyghtye God conueyed certayne thynges awaye at the destruction of 
                           〈◊〉
                        ) was stoned to deathe, and wyth al that euer he had burnt God commaundyng it so to be. Further in the. xxiii, of Exodus we reade of such as receyue brybes (& therby commyt theft) in thys maner. And thou shalte take nore wardes, for they doo blynde euen the wise and subuerte the wordes, or iudgementes of the iust. And in the, xvi, chapter of Deuteronomye, the lyke is wrytten. There is an other greuous kynde of thefte, and that (the more is the pitie) cōmonly vsed, whych is called Symonye takyng name of Symon Magus, who fyrst attempted with mony to purchase spirituall offyce or function (which eyther to sel or bye is dampnable) and was moste bitterlye reproued and accursed of the holye apostle S.

                         kyndes of thefe, none was euer more drede

fullye punished in scripture, than sacriledge (which is thefte, spoile, and robberye, committed in suche thynges, as are dedicated or geuen to the honor of GOD specyallye, as are all churches, and all the ornaments, plate, treasure, landes, and goodes to the same belongynge) as appeareth in the. v. of Danyell, by the example of kynge Balthasar, and in the seconde booke of the Machabees, and the thyrde chapiter, of Helyodorus, whoe goynge aboute the spoyle of the temple of Hierusalem, for the threasores sake of the same soodenlye was throwne downe to the grouude, and beynge sore stricken wyth blyndenes, was caryed spech les also oute of the temple halfe deade. Whych kynde of punyshment, yf it hadde bene vsed in Englande, so ofte as sacrylege hath bene commytted, what a number shoulde there haue bene of them that should haue bene punyshed. But the thyng beyng of that sorte that it hath bene, and we not able to amend it, we wil yet here admonishe al men from henceforth, to make, & kepe theyr handes pure from al sacrilege And thus we make an ende of the declaration of thys commaundemente.

                         Thexposition or declaration, of the nynthe commaundement which is.
                     
                        Thou shalt not vtter, or beare false wytnesse against thy neighboure.

                         neigh boures, thys commaundement being the. vi. of the seconde table, doth admo nyshe vs to auoyd and eschewe tbe do ynge of an other greate and greuous iniurye towardes our neyghboure, whiche is in bearynge false wytnes agaynst our sayd neighbour. And in this matter, there is here in kept a very good ordre for not onelye we are bounden to forbeare the huttyng or endamage of our neighbours bodye, the mysusynge of hys wyfe, and wrongefull takynge awaye of hys goodes, but also by the wyll, pleasure, and com maundemente of almyghtye GOD, we are boundē not once to open our mouth, to dyffame, or misreporte our neyghboure, or to beare vntrue wytnes or falsely to depose in anye matter agaynst oure sayde neygheboure.
                     And lyke as by thys commaundemente al euill vse of the tungue, to the hurte of our neyghboures, is forbydden, so o in, and by the same commaundemente (by the ofte mentioned rule of contraryes) there is commaunded the good and charytable vse of the tungue, all maner of wayes, to the benefytte of oure

neighbonrs, as to be true and playne in oure wordes wyth hym, and towardes hym, to be faythful to hym in all couenauntes, bargaynes, and promysses. To testifye the truthe in all courtes, iudgementes, and other places, to reporte well of them that be absente, to geue true and faythefull counsayle and exhortatyon to all goodnes, yea and to dysswade frome all euyll.
                     And here concernynge thys commaundement we haue mooste iuste cause to lamente and to be sory for ye malyce and euyll disposition that in these oure dayes raygnethe bothe in men and women, whose tounges are so venemous and wyeked, in

                     And to thintente that suche personnes maye hereafter (yf theye wyll not for Loue of Uertue, and Charytyes sake, yet at the leaste for the feare of punyshemente at GODDES hande) refrayne

and forbeare suche theyr dampnable, and wycked spe kynge, we wyll recyte here both in generall, and also in speciall, sundrye the offenders of thys commaundemente, and also the punyshmente hangynge therefore ouer theyr heades. And fyrste in generaltye we wyll brynge in the. xiii. of the prouerbes, where it is thus wrytten. Qui custodit os suum, cuctodit animam suam, qui autem inconsideratus est adloquendum sentiet mala. That is to saye.
                     He that kepeth his mouth, kepeth hys soule, and he that is vnaduised or rashe to speake shall feele hurtes or euylles. And in the thyrde chapter of the fyrste epystle of S. Peter, it is wrytten thus. He that dothe loue lyfe, and to see good dayes, let him refrayne his tongue from euil, and his lyppes, that they doo not speake de: ceyte. Also in the. xii. chapyter of the Prouerbes, the wyse Salomon wryteth in this maner. For the faultes of the lyppes, destruction or ruyne draweth nere vnto the euyll man. Moreouer in the. xviii. chapiter of the same boke, is this saying. Lyfe and death lyeth in the tongue, and they that loue it, shall eate the fruytes of it. And in the. xxvi. chapyter of the sayde prouerbes Salomon sayeth thus. A slipper toungue worketh ruines or destructyons. And to speake somewhat more in particuler of trans gressoures of thys commaundemente, you shall fyrste note, that somme of them doo beare fal se wytnes in open iudgemente, and of them

the wise Salomon in the. xix. chapyter of the prouerbes, doth speake thus. Testis falsus non erit inpunitus, That is to saye. A false wytnesse shall not be vnpunyshed. And yet more terribly he sayeth in the. xxi. chapter folowinge. Testis mendax peribit. That is to saye. A lyinge wytnesse shall peryshe. And further in the. xxv. chapyter of the same booke, it is wrytten in thys wyse.

                           , et gladius, & sagitta acuta, homo quiloquitur contra proximum suum falsum testimonium. That is to saye A darte, and swoorde, and a sharpe arowe, is that man that speaketh agaynst his neygheboure false wytnesse. Howe heynous an offence thys is, appearethe in the. xiii. Chapyter of Danyell, where the two false witnesses (who wickedlye deposed agaynste the Godlye Susanna) were bothe myraculouslye detected, and also of the people presentlye stoned to death. And no meruayle though bothe they and all other bearers of false wytnes be, by aucthoritie of scripture, punyshed in such greuous sorte, seyng that euery one soo offendynge, in bearynge false wytnesse, dothe trespasse agaynste three sundry persones. Fyrste agaynste almyghtye God, whose presence the false wytnesse bearer dothe contemne. Secondelye agaynste the iudge, whome by lyinge he dothe deceaue. Thyrdelye agaynste the innocente party, whō by his false wytnes bearynge, he dothe hynder and hurte.
                     Another sorte, and special kynde of transgressoures against this

his neigheboure, though it be not in iudge mente, of whych sorte and kinde of transgressours, the prophet in hys 100 Psalme dothe saye thus. Who that doth secretely backebite his neigheboure, him doo I persecute. And in the. 24. of the Prouerbes it is sayde thus. Abhominatio hominum detractor. That is to saye, A detractor or backebiter, is abhomination ainongeste men. And in the fyrst Chapter of ye boke of wysedome it is written. A detractione parcite linguae.

                           . That is to saye: Let no man say when he is tempted to euyll that he is tempted of God, for god temptethe not to euill, neither tempteth he anye man, but euerye man is tempted, drawne, and allurcd of hys owne concupyscence. Than whan concupiscence

                         conceyued, it bryngeth fourthe synne. This concupyscence (wherof the apostle Saynte James doth speake, whyche is a motion, stirringe prouokynge, or alluringe of man to synne) is routed in man from his infancye, and contynually doth remaine in hym, more or lesse (duryng the hole state of thys mortall lyfe) be he neuer soo perfyte, and yet is it no synne, so longe as he doethe not delyte therin, and consent therevnto. And therfore it is wrytten in the seuententh chap. of Ecclesiasticus,

in thys maner. Post concupiscētias tuas non eas, That is to say.
                     Doo thou not goe after thy concnpyscences, and in the same chapter it foloweth. Si praestes animaetuae concupsicentias eius, faciette in gaudium inimicis tuis. That is to saye.

Resistite diabolo & 
                              〈◊◊〉

                     And agreable herevnto sayeth Saynte Paule

in the, vi, chapyter of hys epystle to the Romaynes. Let not synne reigne in your mortall bodye, that you obey the concupiscences thereof.
                     But here may be moued a question, what shoulde be the cause that cōcupiscence beyng the mother and nouryce of synne, shoulde remayne in a chrysten man or woman, after baptysine or penaunce, howe good howe holy, or perfecte, soeuer they be, seyng it semeth to be an impediment to do the lawes of God perfectlye and full force to be agayne the wyll of good folke, who woulde fayne be quite of it, and canne not, and therefore doe lament and mourne daylye for the contynuall encombraunce they haue by it: for aunswere to whych question no doubte ye shall knowe that almyghtye God by hys ryghteous iudgemente and infinite wysedome doeth permitte concupiscens to remayne in vs after Baptysme, and penaunce, not for oure euyll or bynderaunce, but for oure good and furderaunce, not to oure destruction, but to be to vs an occasion of saluatyō. For none shalbe crouned in heauē with honor & glorye, excepte in thys lyfe they gette the victorye. 2 ad Timoth. 2. and vyctorye they can not get excepte they fyght stoutly and manfully, and no man doth fyght but wyth hys enemy. So yf there be no enemye there is no battayle, yf no battaile, no victorye, yf no vyctory, no Crowne, for thys cause god hath permytted concupyscence to remayne in vs, that we through grace ouer commynge the same, maye obteine the crowne of glory in heauē. And yt you may the better auoyde ye daunger of concupyscence (being alwayes so busye wt men) we wyll

here declare vnto you foure specyall meanes greately aydyng to the auoydyng of the sayde daunger. The fyrste is to vse earnest prayer, the second to forbeare al occasions of synne, as to flye euyll companye, and to haue regarde to the vse of oure senses, by whyche as by wyndowes death dothe enter into oure soule, arcordynge to the saying of Job, in his. xxxi. chapter. Pepegifoedus cum oculis meis ut ne cogitarem quidem de uirgine.
                     
                     That is to say. I haue made a couenaūte wyth myne eyen, that I woulde not once thynke of a Uyrgyn. The thyrde is to tame our fleshe and to kepe it vnder, and brynge it vnto bondage, accordynge to the example of Saynte Paule, declarynge in the ninth chapyter of hys fyrste pystle to the Corinthyans where he sayth of hym selfe thus. Subigo corpus meum, & in seruitute redicd, ne cum alijs predicem, ipse reprobus efficiar. That is to saye. I chastyce or tame my bodye, and bryng it in subiection or bondage leaste whyle I preache to other I my selfe become a cast awaye. The fourth is to auoyde Idlenesse, for Idle personnes are ful of lustes and cōcupiscence. And as it is wrytten in the. xxiii, chapyter of Ecclesyasticus. Multam malitiam docuit 
                              〈◊〉
                           . That is to saye: Idlenes hath taughte much euyll. As maye well be exemplyfyed in Sodoma, of whyche it is wrytten in the, xvi. chapter of Ezechyell. Beholde thys was the iniquitie of Sodom thy syster pryde, saturitie, or eatynge to the full, excessyue wealthe, and the ydlenes of her, and her

doughters. And here you shall note that when we aduyse you to flye euyll companye and Idlenes, we imploye therin that you shoulde alwayes haunte the companye of honest and godlye personnes, and also euer to be ententiuelye occupyed in some vertuous ex excyse or meditation. And by ye waye we thynke thys good to note agayne vnto you as cōcernynge concupyscence, that al be it not to haue it at al in thys lyfe, is a thinge to vs impossible, yet to consent vnto it, or by the grace of God to dissent from it, is a thing wel possyble vnto vs. And in dede to dissent frō or resyste concupiscence we owghte to the vttermooste of oure power, and vsyng the specyall meanes before rehearsed or some of them, we by the grace of GOD shalbe hable so to doo. And to procede further concernynge the declaration of this tenthe commaundemente, ye shall knowe, that all they be transgressoures of thys commaundemement who by delyberatiō and ful con sent, doo cast, or set theyr myndes, and bartes, to accomplyshe the concupyscence, and desyre whych they haue to obteyne, and gette vnlawefullye an other mans wyfe chylde, seruaunt, house, lande, cattayle, or any thyng that is theyr neyghboures. Secōdlye also they doo transgresse thys commaundement, who through enuy be sory for theyr neyghboures wealth & prosperitie, or be glade of theyr sorowe hynderaunce or aduersitie. Thirdelye and fynally all they do transgresse and breake thys tenth commaundemente who doonot sette theyr myndes and studyes to preserue maynetaine, and defende vnto theyr neygheboures, as muche as in them lyeth, theyr wyues, chyldren,

seruauntes, houses, landes, goodes, and all that is theyr neyghboures. And thus endeth the tenne commaundementes wyth theyr expositions, whyche almyghtye God graunte that we maye obserue and kepe, for then we shalbe sure to haue the kyngedome of heauen and to lyue eternally in ioye and felicitie.

                  And let vs not be ledde into temptation.

                     ¶ The preface to the prayer of oure lorde called the Pater noster.
                     BEfore we shall enter vnto ye speciall declaratiō of the petitions conteined in the prayer of oure lorde called the Pater noster, we (callynge to oure remembraunce the godlye coūsaile moste nedefull to be folowed in thys behalfe written in the. xviii. chapter of Ecclesiastycus, in these wordes. Before prayer prepare thy mynde, wyl (for your good instruction) declare fyrst of all vnto you in what sorte you oughte to prepare your mindes before you begynne to praye. Knowe ye therefore that concernyng our dewe preparation vnto prayer three thynges are (amongest other) specyallye requisite on oure behalfe, the fyrst is, Fayth, the second is Hope, and the thirde is Charitie, and as concernyng, Faith, Ye shall vnderstande that forasmuche as Praier is an eleuation, or liftinge vppe of the hearte to God, to aske of hym all suche thinges as be necessarye. And to lyfte vppe ones hearte or mynde is vnfruitefull and vnpossible wythout

faythe, accordynge to the sayinge of Sayncte Paule who in the tenth, chapyter to the Romaynes wryteth thus. Howe shall they inuocate or call vpon him, in whome they haue not beleued. Therefore aboue all thynges faythe, yea and stronge fayth must be in vs, whensoeuer we doo goo aboute to praye, for fayth teachethe vs, two thynges, the one to knowe our owne infyrmytie, and miserable estate both in bodye and soule, the other to knowe the maiestye of God hys almyghtye power, and good wyll towardes vs. And of faythe wyth the greate vertue thereof in prayer, our sauiour Chryste speakyng in the xxi. of Saynt Mathewe sayinge. Omnia quecunque petieritis in or 
                              〈◊〉
                           , credentis, accipietis. That is to saye. All thinges whatsoeuer you aske in praier, beleuinge or hauing faith, you shall receyue them.
                     And as concernyng Hope, Sayncte James in the fyrst chapyter of hys epystle wryteth thereof sayinge thus. Si quis autem uestrum indiget sapientia, postulet a deo quidat omnibus affluenter, & non improperat & dabitur ei, postulet autem in side nihil hesitans, qui enim hesitat similis est fluctui maris qui auento mouetur. & circumfertur, non ergo existimet homo ille quod aliquid accipiet a domino, That is to saye. Yf anie of you haue nede of wisedome, lette him aske of God (who giueth to al haboundantlie, and dothe caste no man in the teth) & it shalbe giuē vnto him But let him aske in faith, nothing douting, for he ye douteth, is like vnto ye waue of yt sea

which is moued & tossed of the wynde. There fore lette not that man thynke that he shall re ceaue any thing at Goddes handes.
                     The propertye of hope, in prayer, is to cause a man pa cientlye, wyth longe sufferaunce, to abyde the wyll & pleasure of God in the obteynaunce, & perfourmaunce of hys request, and prayer. For we may not prescrybe to God anye determynate, or specyall tyme to accomplyshe oure prayer, but we muste commytte vnto hys holy wyll, bothe the manner howe and the tyme whē to helpe vs. Accordynge as 
                           〈◊〉
                         prophete Dauyd doth counsayle vs in his. xxvi, Psalme sayenge:
                     
                        Expecta dominum, uiriliter ageconfortetur cor tuum, & sustine dominum. That is to saye: Looke for oure Lorde or abyde the pleasure of hym, do thou manfully let thy hart be conforted, and pacyentlye doo thou susteyne oure Lorde. And of thys patyence in hope, and of hope in prayer, we haue a notable example in the seuenth and, viii. chapyters of the boke called Judyth, where it is wrytten, howe that a certayne towne of Jewrye called Bethulia, was soore assaulted of the Assyryans, in so much that the people of the sayd towne, despayrynge of all ayde, and succor agaynste theyr enemyes, dyd ernestlye solicite, and moue Ozais theyr chiefe ruler, to render vppe the towne to the Assyrians, who than beseyged them.
                     And that the sayde Ozias dyd exhorte then the people to be quiet and patiente, and to abyde the mercye of GOD, duringe the space of

them that after fyue dayes yf God dyd not succoure or ayde them againste theyr enemyes, he then woulde accordynge to theyr desyres, render vppe the towne, vpon whych aunswere of Ozias, the Godly wydówe Judyth mislikyng greatly the same, dyd rebuke Ozias sharpelye for that he would and dyd presume to ap poynte God anye tyme, in whyche he shoulde deliuer them from the daunger that they were in, and howe also she sayde to Ozias and to other that were wyth hym, in thys maner.

Yf thou offer thy gyfte at the aultar and there dooeste remember that thy brother hathe anye thynge agaynste the, leaue thy gyfte ther before the Aulter, and goo and be fyrste reconciled to thy brother, and than come and offer thy gyfte. Thus you see, howe that yf you wyl haue your prayer harde and accepted of almyghtye God, you muste of necessitie be fyrst prepared thervnto, by faythe, hope, and charytie, More ouer in the scryptures lefte for oure instruction, and edifienge, there are sondrye examples, teachynge vs that prayer, accumpanyed wyth fastynge and almes dedes, is made therby a greate deale the more acceptable in the syghte of almyghtye God, as apearethe in the twelue chapiter of the boke called Thoby wher the Aungell of God dothe saye vnto Thoby thelder, as foloweth.

And to procede further Concernynge 
                           〈◊〉
                        , ye shall note that when

(when we do praye) our intent, and the hole desyre of oure harte ought to be ioyned alwaye with the praier of oure mouth, elles that reprochs, wrytten by the pro phete Esaye, in his. xxix. Chapyter, (recyted also in the. xv. chapyter of Mathew) may wel be verified on vs, whyche is. Populus hic lahijs me honorat, cor autem corum longe esta me. That is to saye. Thys people honourethe me with theyr lyppes, but theyr harte is farre from me. And to drawe nere to oure purpose, and speciallye to speake of oure Lordes prayer, called the Pater noster you shall vnderstande, that amongeste all the prayers, whyche a Chrysten man maye make to God, there is none soo worthy, and so excellent a pray er as it is. For it was not made, and taughte vs by anye earthlye creature, no nor by anye aungell of hea uen, but by the very sonne of God, our sauioure Iesus Chryste, who is the eternal wysedome of God the father. And the prayer is soo compendions and shorte, that it maye easelye be learned, and borne in mynd of all men, so that excuse of ignoraunce, or of not knowynge of it, or of omyttynge the frequente vse and sayynge of it, is cleane taken awaye from all personnes hauinge the vse of reason. And thoughe thys prayer be shorte in wordes, yet it is excedynge longe, and pro founde in sence. For in. vii. petytions comprysed in it, it dothe conteyne all thynges that we canne desyre of God, whether it be for the welthe of oure soule or of oure bodye or otherwyse, and not onelye concerning thys lyfe, but also concernynge the lyfe to come. And it dothe kepe the selfe same order whyche we oughte to kepe in alloure desyres, and petytyons. For fyrste

and aboue all other thinges we shoulde desyre that God be knowen, honoured, gloryfyed, and magnyfyed, bothe of vs, and also the people of the worlde.
                     And that is it, whych we do desyre of GOD, in the fyrste petition, sayinge. Hallowed be thy name, Secondlye, we shoulde desyre at Goddes handes, all thynges that are good, and that doo we in the three petitions nexte folowynge, for in the fyrste of the thre whyche is. Let thy kyngdome come. we doo aske eternall good thynges, in the seconde, whiche is, Let thy wyll be done in earth, as it is in heauen, We doo aske spiritual good thynges. And in the thyrde, whyche is. Gyue vs this day oure dayly breade. We doo aske temporal good thynges, appertaynynge to our bodely sustentation.
                     Thyrdelye as we oughte to desyre God, to delyuer vs from al euyll, soo doo we in the three last petitions, for in the fyrste of them, whyche is. Forgeue vs oure trespaces, as we doo forgyue thē that trespace agaynste vs. we doo desyre God to deliuer vs from synne and eternall deathe, whyche is the rewarde of synne. And in the seconde whyche is. And leade vs not into temptation, We do desyre to be deliuered from our spirituall enemyes, and in the laste, whyche is. But deliuer vs from euyll. We doo desyre (be sydes other thynges) that we may be delyuered from euyles temporall. Breifely thys prayer of our Lord is so profound, soo aboundaunt and so plenteous, that there is no prayer, whether it be wryttrn in the olde

testament, or in the newe; but the summe and effecte thereof is conteyned in some of these seuen petytyons Wherefore we exhorte all people to saye thys prayet ofte, distinctlye, and

                     WE cannot comprehend in our mynde the great goodnes of God towardes vs, in that he hath taughte vs here in the begynnyuge of oure prayer; to cal hym Oure father. Of truthe this was not vsed in the tyme of the olde testamente, amongeste the Iewes, for they lyued vnder the bondage of Moyses lawe, as seruauntes, and durste not call God, theyr father, but Lorde, whych is a

But ye wyll percase aske, howe hathe almyghtye God made hym selfe to be oure father? Trulye it is not by natural generation, for after that sorte he onelye is father vnto Iesus Chryste but he hath made hymselfe to be our father, by adoptinge vs

                         we doo crye Abba father. And in the

                         to the Ephesyans S. Paule sayeth. Be ye folowers of God as mooste dearelye beloued sonnes, and walke in loue as Chryst hath loued 
                           〈◊〉
                        . And in the fyft of Mathew, our sauiour. Christ saieth. Be ye perfit as youre heauenlye father is perfit. And here is to be noted a lesson, that as 
                           〈◊〉
                         worde father, doth declare the greate

                        , mercy, and loue of GOD towardes vs as well in creation as also in the redemption of man so it

                         sheth vs agayne of oure duetye towardes hym, and howe we be bound to shew agayne vnto hym our hole harte, loue

obedience, and redynes to fulfyll with all gladenes and humilitye all hys preceptes, and commaundementes. And therefore whosoeuer presumeth to come to God with this prayer, and to call hym father, and yet hathe not full intente, and purpose, to vse hym selfe in all thynges lyke a kynde, and an obedyente Sonne, he commeth to him as Iudas came to Christ wyth a kysse, pretendyng to be his frende and hys ser uaunte, in callynge hym mayster, and yet he was in dede a traytoure to hym, and a deadelye enemye. And for thys consideration euerye chrysten man that intendeth to make thys prayer, ought inwardly and throughly, to searche and examyne hym selfe, and yf he fynde in hymselfe, anye notable cryme, for the whiche he oughte to be ashamed to cal GOD his father, let hym accuse hym selfe therefore to God, and recognyse hys vn worthynes, saying as the prodygal sonne sayde father I haue offended the, I am not worthye to be called thy sonne. And wyth due repentaunce 
                           〈◊〉
                         purpose, and intente, to amende hys naughtye lyfe, let hym lyte vppe hys harte to God, and callynge for hys grace of reconciliation, let hym humbly say. Oure father. &c.
                     Neyther is it wythoute greate cause, that oure sauyour Chryste teacheth vs to saye. Oure father, and not My father, For thereby he geuethe vs clerly to vnderstande that as we our selues be the sōnes and chyldren of God, by adoption throughe faythe, so are all other Chrysten men and women the chyldren of GOD by the same faythe, and therefore we

ought to loue them all with perfecte loue and charytye, as brethen and systers in God. Oure heauenlye doctoure in thys worde doeth geue vs instruction of vnitye, concorde, and peace, and to praye to God for all chrysten people, knowen and vnknowen, for and frende. And for that purpose and effecte, he hath not learned vs to saye. My father whiche art in hea uen, but he hath taught vs to saye: Oure father whiche arte in heauen: Lykewyse we saye not gyue me thys daye my daylye breade, but Giue vs thys daye oure daylye breade, nor we say not forgiue me my synnes, and trespasses, but forgyue vs oure synnes and trespasses.
                     Lykewyse we saye not delyuer me from euyll, but Delyuer vs from euyll, To sygnyfye that throughe faythe in Iesus Christe, we are all the sonnes of God: and therefore shoulde not the gentleman dyspyse the yoman, nor the ryche the poore, Malachye (Malach. 2.) doth saye. Nunqui non pater unus omnium nostrum? 
                              〈◊〉
                            non unns deus creauit nos? quare ergo unusquis

                     The prayer in dede that the proude Pharisey made (Luke. 18) 
                           〈◊〉
                         not acceptable vnto God, bycause he dispised hys neighboure, the publican. Let vs al 
                           〈◊〉
                         knowe our selues to be brethren in god & through

sayth equally to be hys chyldren. And as concerninge these wordes, whych art in heauen. we maye not by theym vnderstande, that God is conteyned, and included wythin the heauenes, as the aungelles, and holy sayntes are, for (as Salomon sayeth in the thyrd booke of the kynges and the eyght chapyter.) The heauens of heauens doo not comprehende or include hym. But in thys respecte he is sayde to be in heauen, because he, by hys almyghtye power, doth conteyne, kepe, holde vp, and mayntayne, all the heauens, and also all other creatures, whyche are enclosed, and shutte vnder the cope, or compasse of heauen accordynge as S. Paule sayeth. Collos. i. Omnia in ipso constant. That is to saye: All thynges in hym haue theyr beynge. And therefore vnto god onelye we doo saye, whyche arte in heauen. Bycause that god onely as he hath made heauen, and all thynges vnder heauen, so he onely is in all the heauens, and wyth hys almyghtye power conserueth, and kepethe them in all theyr beyng. And here must we note, that we maye not thynke, that god is so in heauen, that thereby he can not be, or is not in earth also, as shall please hym selfe. For truelye he is in all places, by hys essence, by hys presence, and by hys power, accordynge as he sayethe (Hieremye. xxiii.) Nonne coelum & terram ego impleo? That is to saye, Doo not I fyll heauen and earth? and he is sayde specyally to be in heauen, for as muche as in heauen, he is manyfest, and sheweth hys godheade, hys dyuyne maiestye,

power, glorye, ioye, and blysse eternall, whyche he hath promysed to geue, as a rewarde, to al suche as doo perseuer in hys fayth, and obedience, accordynge as he sayeth, Math. v. Merces uestra multa est in coelis. That is to saye. Youre rewarde is greate in heauen. And here doo you marke that these wordes, whych arte in heauen, are so placed and set furth, to styrre vp our heartes to God, and to cause in vs an inward desyre, and a greate care, and studye to come to the place where our heauenly father is: yea, and muche to couete hys syghte and presence. For lyke as a louyng chylde is euer desyrous to be where hys father is, euen so oughte we euer to desyre to be wyth oure heauenlye father, and to endeuoure our selues, that our conuersation be al wythdrawen frō the worlde, the fleshe, and the deuyll, and be set vpon heauen and heauenlye thynges, as S. Paule teacheth, Phil. iii. And therefore we shoulde contynuallye wayle, and lament, because we be not wyth oure heauenlye father, saying with the prophet. Psal. cxix. wofull am I, that my dwellynge vpon the earth, is soo muche prolonged. And by these wordes shoulde there be engendred in vs, a stronge hope, of eternall glorye. And howe can we fayle thereof, yf we wyll, seynge oure heauenlye father hathe bothe the wyll, and also the power to perfourme it? Hys wyll we clearelye vnderstande, in asmuche as he made hym selfe to be oure father: hys power is well knowen, for that he is a God of power, and glorye, and maker, and preseruer of Heauen, Earthe, and of

all that in them is. And here shall you further note yt these wordes. Our father whych art in heauen. are put lyke a prologue before all the seuen petitions, (yea and euery one of them may haue prefixed, before them the same prologue) declaryng playnely, that no man can saye thys prayer truely, and duelye, that no pleasure of god, and hys owne meryte, excepte he haue fayth, hope, and Charytye, for wythout faythe, nor can say truelye, O father, and wy thoute charytye to hys neyghbour, no man cane say truelye and meritoriouslye, Oure father, and wythout hope, no man can saye truelye, Whyche arte in hauen doo thou remyt vs our synnes. And in these wordes Halowed be thy name, it is to be noted, that by the name of God, is vnderstande God hym selfe, the power of God, the myght, the maiestye, the glory, the wysedome, the prouidence, the mercye, and goodnes of God, and all such other good thynges, as in scrypture be attribute vnto God. And thys name is halowed, when it is praysed, gloryfyed, sette furthe, honoured, and magnyfied of vs, bothe in woorde and dede.
                     And where in thys petytyon we praye that hys name maye be hallowed, it is not to be taken or thoughte that thys name of God, whyche in it selfe is euermore moste holy, most glorious, most merueylouse and full of maiestye, can be eyther aduaunced or dymynished by vs, or any thyng that we can doo: but we desyre here, that thys moste holye name maye (accordynge as it is in it selfe moste holy) be so taken,

vsed honoured, and halowed of vs, and of all others as well heathen as chrystened, lyke as on the contrary parte, thys name is sayde to be polluted, and defyled, when we doo eyther in worde, or in deede, contumelyouslye, and contemptuouslye, or otherwyse dyshonor the same. We desyre therefore in thys petytion, that all false faythe, by the whyche men eyther mystrust god, or put theyr confidence in anye othere thyng more then in hym, may be destroyed. And that all wytche craftes and false charmes & coniurations, by the whyche Sathan and other creatures, be inchaunted, maye cease; and geue place, to goddes holy name: and so lykewyse, that all heresyes, and false doctrynes, maye vanyshe awaye, so that goddes holy worde may be truely interpreted, and purely taught and sette furth, vnto al the worlde, and that all infydels maye receyue the same, and be conuerted to the ryght catholyke faythe, whereby al disceyte, hipocrisye, and counterfaytynge of trueth, of ryghteousnesse or of holynes may clearely be extincted.
                     Furthermore, we do beseche, and praye god here that his name may be halowed, so that no mā should swere in vayne by it, or otherwyse abuse the same, to lye or deceyue hys neyghboure. And generallye that none shoulde fall into pryde, or ambition, into desyre of worldlye glorye and fame, into enuy malyce couetousuesse, adulterye, gluttonye, slouth, backbytynge, sclaunderynge of hys neyghbours, ne into any other euyll or wicked thoughtes, and dedes, whereby the name of god maye be dyshonored and blasphemed. In thys prayer also we doo requyre god to graunte

vs that in all perylls, and daungers, we ruime vnto hym, as vnto our onely refuge, and call vpon hys holye name, and that in oure good woorde and woorkes, we maye please and magnifye hym, and be by hym preserued from the mooste damnable synne of vnkyndnes towardes hym. And also that we whoo doo all readye professe the ryghte fayth, may styl continue therein, and maye doo, and expresse the same aswell in oure outwarde conuersation, as in confessynge it with our mouthe, so that by oure good lyfe, and oure good workes, all other maye be moued to good, and that by oure euyll woorkes and synnes, no man maye take occasion, to sclauuder the name, or dimynyshe the laude, and prayse of God, but that all our woorkes and doynges, may redoūd to the honor prayse, and glorye of Goddes name.
                  
                  
                     
                     ¶ The exposition or declaratiō of the seconde petition, which is.
                     
                        Thy kyngdome come.
                     
                     THys seconde petition verye orderlye, doth folowe vppon the fyrst, for as in the fyrst we do aske of God our eternall father, that hys gloryous name maye be knowen through out all the worlde, and be of all people, (whether they be turkes, Jues, or heathen) loued, magnifyed, and gloryfyed alwayes, aswell as it is of vs Chrysten men, which is a thynge aperteynyng to the dewe honor and glory of God, and whych we ought of dutye fyrste and pryncipallye to desyre, So in thys second petition we aske of God our heauenly father, that he wyll vouchsafe to brynge vs to hys eternall kyngdome, euermore to be wyth hym, and partycypante of hys enerlastyng glorye, and heauenly enherytaunce, wyth Chryst Jesu our Sauiour (whych is a thyng of al other that a mā may wysh to hys owne selfe, ye chief & most greatest.) And for the declaratiō of thys second peticion, you shall vnderstand that there are two kyngdomes, the one contrarye to the other, it is to wytte, the kyngedome of god, and the kyngedome of the Deuyll. For as concernynge worldelye kyngdomes and dominions, they

                         they be well gouerned, and guyded by order of Jystyce, doo perteyne to the kyngoome of god, as Saynte Paule testifyeth in the. xiii. chapter to the Romaynes. And 
                           〈◊〉
                         they be misordered, through want of

Tyranye they doo pertayne to the kyngdome of the deuyll. Nowe concernynge the kyngdome of god, it is of two fortes, it is to wytte, the kyngedome of grace in thys worlde, and the kyngdome of glorye in the worlde to come: and of the kyngdome of grace, S.

That is to saye: The kyngedome of God is iustyce, and peace, and ioy in the holy gost, for he that in thys serueth Chryste, pleasethe God, and is allowed with men. Lykewyse the sayd Saynt Paule speakynge of thys kyngdome of grace, doth in the fyrste chapiter of hys epistle to the Collossenses, say thus. He hath translated, or caried vs, frome the power or kyngedome of darkenes, into the kyngedome of his derelye beloued sonne, in whome we haue redemption, and remission of synnes. And moreouer we doo reade in the fyfte of the Apocalipse after thys maner, Fecisti nos deo nostro regnum. That is to saye. Thou haste made vs a kingedome vnto our God. For doubtles so longe as we remayne in grace, god doth raygne in vs, as in a spirituall kyngedome, and we as his faythfull people, doo obeye hym therein. And as concernynge the kyngedome of glorye in the worlde to come you shall vnderstand that oure Sauiour in hys second comminge, which shalbe at dōes day, shal giue entrance & perpetual possessiō therof, to 
                           〈◊〉
                         elect: whēhe shal say vnto them (as it is 
                           〈◊〉
                        )

Comeye the blessed of my father, doo you posselle the kyngedome prepared for you, before the creation, or beginning of the worlde! Nowe concernynge the kyngedome of the Deuyll, which is cleane contrarye to the kyngdome of God, that in dede is a dominion, or rule, and souerayntye, whych the deuyll hathe in the hartes of the wycked men and women, who accordyng to his pernycious wyll and entycynges, doo transgresse the commaundementes of God, and doo make them selfe bonde, and thrass to synne, wyllyngly consentynge to the denyles tentations, and drawen thereby to hys seruice, and holden also therein, by concupyscence of the fleshe by concupyscence of the eye, and by pryde of life. And of thys kyngedome of the deuyll, S. Paule. Ephe. ii. doth speake sayinge. He (God the father) hathe reuyued you al at ones, when you were deade thorough your trespasses, wherein, in tymes past, you did walke accordinge to the course of this worlde, after the prynce of the kynge dome, or power of this ayre, the spirite which nowe worketh vpon the children of vnbeleif. Accordynge wherevnto oure sauiour also, Jhon. xii. doeth call the deuyll the prynce of thys worlde, that is to saye, of all euyll and wycked people, lyuynge in the worlde. And in the. xli. chapter of Job, the deuyll is called the kynge of al proude men.
                     And forasmuche as it is not in oure power to delyuer our selues from the 
                           〈◊〉
                         of the Deuyll, but

onelye by Godes helpe (For oure perdition and vndoing is of oure selues, but oure helpe and faluation is of God. as sayeth the Prophete Ozee cap. 13.) therefore it is very necessarye for all true christen people, to make this petition, incessantlye vnto our heauenly father, and to beseche hym, according to this doctryne of Chryste, that by hys grace, & helpe we may escape the dominion and power of the Deuyll, and that we maye be made subiecte vnto hys heauenlye kyngedome. Therfore in this petytyon we dysyre God to gyue vs afore all thynges, true, and constant fayth in him, and in hys sonne Jesus Christ, and in the holye Ghoste, with pure loue, and charitie towardes hym, and all men, to kepe vs also from infidelitie, desperation, and malyce, whyche myghte be the cause of oure destruction, and to delyuer vs from dissensions, couctuousnes, lecherye, and euyll desyres and lustes of synne, and so the vertue of his kingdom to come, to reigne within vs, that al our heart, 
                           〈◊〉
                         and wyttes, wythall our strength inwarde and outwarde, maye be ordered and directed to serue GOD to obserue his commaundementes, and hys will and not to serue our 
                           〈◊〉
                        , the fleshe, the worlde, or the Deuyll.
                     We desyre also that this kingdome, ones in vs begonne, maye be daylye cucrcased, and goo forwarde more and more, so that all subtyll and secrete hate, or slouth, whych we haue to goodnes be not suffered to rule so in vs that it shall cause vs to loke back againe and to fall into synne, but that we maye haue a stable,

purpose and strenghte, not onelye to begynne the 
                           〈◊〉
                         of innocencye, but also to procede ernestly furthe in it, and to perfourme accordynge to the sayinge of Saynt Paule (Colosse. i.) where he prayeth that we maye walke worthelye pleasynge god in all thynges beyng fruitefull in all good workes, & growynge and increasynge, in the knowledge of god. Also (Eph. iiii) he doth saye. Worke and doo the truth in charite, and increase and goo forwarde in Christ. Therefore in this prayer desyrynge the kyngedome of god to come. we requyre also, that we beynge alredy receyued and entred into the kyngdom of grace and mercye of god, may soo contynue and perseuer therein, that after this lyfe we may come to the kyng dome of glorye, whych endureth for euer, and thys is that greate and feruent desyre, where with good men beyng mortyfyed from worldely affections haue bene and be alwayes kyndled and enflamed, as appeareth by Saynte Paule, when he sayd (Philip.)
                     I woulde be losed from this bodye and be wt Chryste. and he sayth (Rom. eyght) We that haue receiued the firste fruites of thy spyryte, doo wayle and mourne, in our selues,

                         and loking to be delyuered from the mortalitie & miserles of this body, into the glory of the children of God.

                         Thexposition or declaration of the thyrde petition whyche is.
                     
                        Thy wil be done in earth, as it is in heauen.
                     
                     AFter that in the seconde petition we doo aske of God oure eternall father that hys kyngedome of grace, maye come vnto vs in thys worlde, & that we maye finallye come to hys eternal kyngdome in heauen (whyche is the hyghest degree of mans filicitye) there doth by ryghte order folowe thys thirde petition, wherein we doo aske of God oure eternall father, that hys wyll maye be fulfylled here in earthe, by the fulfyllynge, and kepynge of hys commaundementes, whyche is the best and mooste perfecte meanes, to procure vnto vs the foresaide highe degree of our felicytie. And for the better and playner vnderstandynge of thys thyrde petition, you shall note that by disobedience, and synne of our fyrst father Adam, we be, as of our nature onelye, without the grace of God, vnhable to fulfyll the wyll, and preceptes of God, and so are enclyned to loue our selues, and oure one wylles, that we canne not hartely loue, neither god, nor man, as we oughte to doo. And therfore (we being once chrysten men) it is requisite for vs to praye, that lyke as the holye aungelles and saynctes in heauen (in whome GOD reygnethe perfectlye, and holye) doo neuer cease, ne shall cease, to gloryfye hym, to prayse hym, and

to fulfyll hys wyll and pleasure in all thynges, and that moste readylye and gladely, without any maner of grudgynge, or resystinge there vnto, knowyng certainelye and clearelye, that hys will is 
                           〈◊〉
                         the best euen so that we the chyldren of God, in earthe, maye daylye and continuallye prayse God, and by our holy conuersation in good workes, and good lyfe, honour and groryfye hym, and that we maye from tyme to tyme so mortyfye oure owne naturall corrupte and synnefull appetyte, and wyll, that we maye be euer redye lyke louynge children, humbly, lowely, and obe dientlye, to approue, allowe, and accomplyshe the wil of God oure father in all thynges, and to submytte our selues wyth all oure hearte vnto the same, and to acknowledge that whatsoeuer is the wyll of GOD, the same is moste perfecte, moste iuste, most holy, and mooste expediente for the health and wealthe of oure soules, we (I say) ought also for these things to pray.
                     Wherefore in this petition also, we desyre of God true and stable pacience, when oure wyll is letted or broken. And that whan anye man speaketh or doeth contrarye to our wyll, yet therefore we be not oute of pacyence, 
                           〈◊〉
                         curse, or murmure, or seke vengeaunce agaynste our aduersaryes, or them whyche let oure wyll but that we maye saye well of them, and doe well to them. We pray also that by goddes grace we may gladelye suffer all diseases pouerty, dispysynges, persecutions, and aduersities, knowynge that it is the wyll of God, that we shoulde crucyfye and mortyfye oure wylles. And whan any such aduersitie chaūceth vnto vs, to attribute al vnto the wil or sufferaunce

of GOD, and geue hym thankes therefore who doth order all suche thynges for oure weale and benefytte, eyther for the exercyse and the tryall of the good to make them stronger in goodnes and vertue, or ells for the chastysemente and amendemente of the euyll, to suppresse theyr euyll motyons and desyres.
                     And also we praye that whansoeuer it shall please god to call vs oute of thys transytorye lyfe, we maye be wyllyng to dye, and that consyrmynge our will to the wyll of God, we maye take our deathe gladely, so that by feare, or

                        , we be not made dysobedyent vnto hym.
                     We desyre furthermore, that all oure members, eyes, tonge, hart, handes, and feete, be not suffered to follawe the desyres of the fleshe, but that all maye be vsed to the wyll and pleasure of GOD, and that malycyouslye we reioyse not in theyr troubles, whyche haue resisted our wyll, or haue hurt vs, nor that we be enuyously sorye, when that they prosper and haue welfare, but that we maye be contented and pleased, with althing that is gods wyll.
                  
                  
                     
                     ¶ The exposition or declaration of the fourth petition which is.
                     
                        Gyue vs this day our dayly breade.
                     
                     AFter that in the three former petitions we are orderly taught fyrst to desire & praye for suche thynges, as do cōcerne God, to gloryfye, & hallowe his name Secondly to desyre and praye for the cheife and principall blysse that man may haue, whiche is the kyngedome of God. And Thirdelye to desyre & praye for such cheife meanes, by whiche that 
                           〈◊〉
                         blysse is obteyned that is to saye by the fulfyllynge here in earth of gods wyl and pleasure. Now next and fourthly we are here taught to desyre of God, thinges that be necessarye for the foode and 
                           〈◊〉
                         both of our bodye & also of our soule, so longe as we shall here 
                           〈◊〉
                         vpon the Earthe. And fyrste as touchynge the sustenance of the bodye you shall note fyue thynges in this petition. The first is that our lorde teacheth vs in this petytyon, not to aske any superfluouse thynge of pleasure, and vayne delite, but onely thinges necessarye, & sufficiēt & there fore he biddith vs aske onelye breade, wherein is not ment 
                           〈◊〉
                        , greate substaūce, or habundaunce of thinges aboue our state & cōditiō, but such thinges onely as be necessary for euery man in his degree that it should be one ordinary & dayly maner of sustenaūce 
                           〈◊〉
                        , & trade of liuing, & nether inordinat nor excessiue

And therefore yf we Chrysten men haue meate and drynke and cloth, that is to saye, thynges suffycyente let vs holde our selues content, for they that set there myndes on ryches, and wyll haue superfluities more than nedeth, or is expedyent to there vocatyon, they fall into daungerouse temptatyons and into snares of the deuyll, and into manye vnprofytable and noysome desyres, which drowne men into perdityon and euerlastinge 
                           〈◊〉
                        , for the spryng and roote of all euylls, is suche superfluouse desyre. The wyseman also makyng hys petition to our lorde. Prouerbe. 35. sayth. Gyue me neither pouertie nor excesse, but onelye thinges sufficiente for my liuinge, lest that hauinge to much, I be prouoked to denye God, and to forgette who is the Lord, and on the other syde, lest that by pouertie cō
                        strayned, I fall into thefte and forswere the name of my God.
                     Whereby is declared that we shoulde desyre onely thynges necessarye, signified here by breade, and refuse and renounce superfluities vnprofitable, daungerous, and noysome.
                     The second thyng to be considered in this petiti on is, that we doo desyre and praye, not absolutelye for breade, but we doo desyre and praye for. Oure breade. By whyche wordes appeareth, that, that breade onelye is oures, which we do get, by true iuste honest and lawefull meanes, for yf we doo get ought

by deceyte, fraude, crafte, or any vnlawfull or 
                           〈◊〉
                         wayes, that is in no wyse ours, but other mens. So that in thys worde Our, is most euidentlye implyed and conteyned a greate reproche to all those persons, which eate not theyr owne bread, but deuoure other mens breade: of whyche sorte be all those that lyue of theft, robbery, rauyne and spoyles, extortion, or craft and deceyte. They also are of thys sort who neyther doo laboure with their handes, nor otherwyse apply theyr study, theyr industry or diligence to some thinge whiche maye be good and profytable to the common wealthe, and to the honoure of GOD but doo lyue in case, rest, ydelnes, and wanton pleasure. They lykewyse are of thys sorte, and worthy therefore to be reproued, who beyng in any roume, or vocation of aucthoritye or seruice, do not fully truely and faythfullye fulfyl and performe the duetye of theyr vocation. The thirde thing to be noted in this petitiō touching our corporall sustenaunce, is, that we muste saye vnto almyghtye God, 
                           〈◊〉
                        , That is to saye: Geue thou, to the entente that we should not thinke yt out meate drynke, clothe, or any other worldelye sustenaunce is wonne or gotten onely by oure owne industry, wyt, and laboure (thoughe we be bounde by the lawe of God, to laboure and trauayle in our vocation, to the vttermost of our 
                           〈◊〉
                        , for the mayntenaūce & sustenaunce of our selues and all ours) but that when we haue played and done our parte, 
                           〈◊〉
                         we must firmely beleue that all thinges so commynge vnto vs, are geuen vs, by the liberal handes of almyghty God, who

doth fede both man and beaste: for of our selfe, we can not 
                           〈◊〉
                         nor assure or promysse oure selues anye thynge, but whatsoeuer we haue, we haue it in dede at the hande of almyghtye God, as the prophet Dauid doth saye in his. cxxx. psalme. All thynges doe wayte or looke for at thy hande that thou shouldeste geue them meate in tyme. And when thou doest geue vnto them, they shall gather. And when thou doest open thy hand, all thynges shalbe fylled with goodnes: and when thou doest tourne awaye thy face, they shalbe in trouble or distresse. And the same Prophette in the. cxliiii. 
                           〈◊〉
                         doeth saye. The eyes of all thynges trust in thee (o lorde) and thou geuest them foode in dewe seasonne: Thou doest open thy hande, and dost fyll euery ly uynge thynge wyth thy blessynge. Nowe the fourth thynge here in too be considered, is the worde Us, which noteth vnto vs that no man ought to say in prayer. Geue me my dayly breade but Geue vs our dayly breade. Beinge therby taughte that what thynges soeuer. God dothe gyue or sende vnto vs, he gyueth them not to vs for oure owne pryuate commoditye and vse onely, but that we also, shoulde gyue to other, some parte or portion, and some fruite therof, especially to such as 
                           〈◊〉
                         wayes by no menes possible can yerne or get theyr lyuynge. And therfore

                        
                           〈◊〉
                         suche wycked people doo praye in vayne, who knowinge thys to be the petytyon, Gyue vs thys day our daylye breade. do not onely refuse of that thing whiche God hath sent to them, to impart some what vnto the the pore. But also wyll and doo, rather robbe and spoyle them, by fraude, deceyte, extortyon or otherwyse, that they them selues maye encrease theyr pryuate wealthe, not caryng howe vniustlye, or vngodlye they come to goodes, nor howe they kepe them, or spende them, and thys sorte of people almygh ty God abhorreth greatlye. The fyft thing herein to be considered is this worde. Hodie, That is to saye:
                     Thys daye. Wherby is ment, partelye the hole contynuaunce & time of mans lyfe, 
                           〈◊〉
                         inuste be referred to the disposition of almyghtye God, concerninge his bodily sustenaunce, and partelye, (yea and that most speciallye) that we hauinge thinges sufficyente for our 
                           〈◊〉
                         necessytie, should not be ouer carefull for the tyme to come. Of which thing our Sauioure Chryst in the. vi. of Mathewe doth speake, sayinge.
                     I say 
                           〈◊〉
                         you, beye not carefull for youre lyuing what ye shall eate, ne for your bodye what clothes ye shall weare, is not lyte better then meate? and your body, better thē your clothing? 
                           〈◊〉
                         vpon the byrdes of the ayre: they 
                           〈◊〉
                         not, they reapenot, they bring nothing in ye barne, & yet your heauenly father fedeth thē, are not you of more price thē thei?

vpon the lylies of the fielde, howe they grow they laboure not, they spinne not, and yet I tell you Salomon in all his glorye, was not so clothed as one of them. Nowe yf god so clothe that, which to day is grasse of ye feild and to morowe is cast into the fornace, howe much more will he considre you, O ye of little faithe: Wherefore be you not carefull or pensiue, sayinge what shall we eate, or what shall we drinke, or where with all shall we be clothed, for all these thinges the heathen doo seke after. But your father, dothe knowe that ye haue nede of all 
                           〈◊〉
                         thinges, wherfore seke ye firste for the kingedome of god, & the rightuousnes thereof, and all these thinges shalbe giuen or caste vnto youe. Be ye not then careful for to morowe. For the morowe shall care for it selfe.
                     And secondelye as concernyninge the sustenaunce of the soule whyche also is ment and conteyned in thys petition, ye shall vnderstande, that this kynd of fode is of two sortes. The one is that incomperable and most excellente foode, wherof Christ maketh promise in the. vi, of Ihon saying. The breade or foode whiche I will geue is my fleshe, whiche I will geue for the life of the worde. Whyche breade or fode is conteined truely, and 
                           〈◊◊〉
                         the

blessed Sacramente of the aulter, wherin vnder the formes of breade and wyne (as we haue heretofore sufficientlye declared) is the very body and bloude of our Sauiour Christ, the other foode is the worde of God: accordyng as oure Sauiour doth testifye in the fourth of Mathewe saying. Not onelye wyth cor porall foode is the lyfe of man susteyned, but with euerye worde that procedeth from the mouth of God. And agreable to thys exposytyon Sayncte Augustyne in hys. 135, sermon, dc tempore, expoundyng this fourth petition of the, Pater noster, dothe saye in thys maner. Siquetur in oratione, panem nostrum

                     That is to saye. It doth followe in our Lordes praier. Gyue vs this daye our daylye breade, whether we do aske of our father, necessarye sustenaunce of the bodye: in, or by breade, meaninge, whatsoeuer is necessarye for vs: or whether that by our dayely breade, we do

                         from the aultar, we doo aske well of GOD, that he wyll geue it vnto vs. For what doo we pray, but that we commit not any offēce wherby we muste be separated from suche foode, or bread? And the woord of God, whiche is dayly preached, is breade, or foode. For it followeth not, that because it is not the breade, or foode of the belly, therefore it is not the bread or foode of the mynd, or soule. And whan this life shal be once passed, we neither doo seke that breade, whiche hunger seeketh for, nor we haue nede to receiue the sacramēt of the aultar, for there we shall be with Christ whose body we haue receaued, neyther these wordes are to be spoken vnto vs, whiche we doo speake, or vtter vnto you, nor the booke is there to be redde, bycause we shall see hym who is the worde of God, by whome all thinges ar made, on whom the angels doo feede, by whom the angels are illuminated, by whome angels doo receaue wisdome &c. And hereby ye doo playnelye perceyue that in thys petition, our sauioure teacheth vs, not onelye to aske our heauenlye father for dayly sustenaunce of the bodye, but also to aske for the sustenaunce of the soule.
                  
                  
                     
                     ¶ The exposition or declaration of the fyfte petition whych is.
                     
                        And for geue vs oure trespasses, as we do forgeue them that trespasse agaynst vs.
                     
                     FOr asmuche as the end, and scope, of all prayer, is onelye to obtayne thynges which are good, or to be pourged preserued or delyuered, from thynges whiche are euyll. And that thys oure Lordes prayer, is not onley a moste perfecte, fruiteful, and ample prayer in sense, but also a moste perfecte fourme, where by all maner of prayers, eyther in parte or in the hole, are framed, or shapen. Therefore after the former foure petitions, in whyche we doo aske all that good is, there doeth folowe in verye good order, the other three petitions, in whyche we doo aske the auoydynge of all euyll, as fyrst of synne commytted, and payne due to the same (it beynge the greatest euyll of all euyls). Secondlye of tentation, whyche is the chiefe meanes, whereby man is induced to synne. Thirdelye and lastlye, we do aske the auoydynge of all other thynges, that may be hurteful, dammageable, or 
                           〈◊〉
                         vnto vs, and especially for the auoydynge of the deuyl, who is to vs mooste daungerouse. And the order of the three laste petitions of the 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                            noster, beynge thus opened vnto you, mete it shall be nowe to entreate of the fyrste of them, whiche is. Forgeue vs our trespasses, as we forgeue 
                           〈◊〉
                         yt do trespasse againste vs.

In whych peticion we haue two proffitable lessones geuen vnto vs. The fyrste is that we should lerne alwayes to be lowlye, and meke in harte consideryng that we are all synners in the syghte of God. Sainct Iohn so testifyeng, in the fyrste Chapiter, of hys first epystle, and saying. If we saye that we haue no sinne, we do begyle our selfe, and there is no veritye or truthe in vs, whervnto agreeth Salomon in the. xx. of hys prouerbes sayinge. Who can saye my harte is cleane, and I am pure from synne. And agayne he sayth in ye. iiii. of Ecclesiastes. There is no manne, so good vpon the earthe, but that he synneth. And moreouer, in the. 24. of the pronerbes, he sayth. Aiuste man shall fall, seuen tymes a daye, and shall ryse agayne.
                     By consideration of whyche our owne infirmitie & 
                           〈◊〉
                         to synne, we shoulde humble our selues in ye syghte of God, knowing (as Saint James doth saye in the fourth chapiter of hys epystle) God will resiste the proude, and 
                           〈◊〉
                         the humble 
                           〈◊〉
                         doth giue grace. The seconde lesson whyche we shoulde learne in this petition, is that the forgyuyng of other mens offenses done agaynste vs, is a cause, & meanes to obteyne remissyon of our synnes, at Gods handes, accordyng where vnto our sauyoure sayeth in the. vi. of Luke. Forgeue and ye shalbe forgeuen.
                     And in the sixt of. Mathewe, he sayth. 
                           〈◊〉
                         you forgyue

to men theyr offences, than shall youre heauenlye father forgeue you, your offences and synnes. But yf you do not forgeue men neyther shall your father forgeue you youre synnes. And moreouer in the. xviii, 'of Mathewe it is wrytten howe when Peter came to our Lord, and demaunded of hym howe oft he shoulde forgeue hys brother, whyche had offended hym, and whether it was not sufficient to forgeue hym seuen tymes. Oure Lorde answered hym and sayde. I tell the Peter that thou oughtest to forgeue him not only seuen times, but seuentie times seuen times. Meanynge thereby that from tyme to tyme, we must continually forgeue oure brother, or neygheboure, wyth all our hearte, althoughe he trespasseth agaynst vs neuer so often. And Chryste also in the same place declareth the same by a parable. There was sayth Chryst, a kynge, which callyng hys seruauntes vnto an accompte, and fyndynge that one of them did owe vnto hym the summe of tenne thousand talentes, and had it not to pay, he cōmaunded that the saide debtor, his wife and his children, & al that he had 
                           〈◊〉
                         be sold, but when the debtour came vnto the kyng & praied him on his knees to haue paciēce whim, promising him to pay al, ye king had pitie of him, & forgaue him ye hole debte,

Nowe it fortuned afterwarde 
                           〈◊〉
                         thys man beinge thus acquited, mette wyth an other of his felowes, that ought hun but one hundreth pence, and wyth violence almooste he strangled hym and sayde vnto him. Paye that thou owest. And the sayde seruaunte his felowe, fell vpon his knees, and prayed hym to haue pacience, promysinge to paye all, but his felowe woulde not, but caste him in to prison, vntyll all was payed. And whan the reste of his felowes, seinge this crueltye, had tolde the kinge thereof, the kynge furthwith sente for this cruell felowe, and sayde to 
                           〈◊〉
                        . O wycked man, I Forgaue thee thy hole debte, at thy sute and request, it shoulde therefore haue beseemed the, to haue shewed like compassion, vnto thy felowe, as I shewed to the. And the kinge beynge sore dyspleased with this crueltye, committed hym to tormenters, that shoulde roughelye and straitelye handle him in prison, tyll he hadde payed the whole debte.
                     Upon this parable Chryst inferreth and sayeth. Euen so shall your heauenly father doo wyth you, if you will not forgeue euery one of you his brother, from the hearte.
                     
                        Thus it appeareth playnelye, that yf we wyll be forgeuen, and wyll escape euerlastynge dampnatyon, we muste putte oute of oure hearte all rancoure, malyce, and wyll to reuenge or to satysfye oure owne carnall affections, referrynge the punyshmente of the offenders, whyche in theyr offences haue transgressed the lawes of God or of the prynce, to the order of Justyce, where of vnder God, the prynces and rulers be ministres in earthe, in whyche doynge we vtterlye forgeue our owne priuate grudge and dyspleasure.
                     And yf anye peraduenture wyll thynke it to be an harde thynge, to suffer and forgeue hys enemye, whyche in woorde and deede hathe doone hym anye displeasures, lette hym consyder agayne, howe manye harde stormes oure Sauyoure Chryste suffered, and aboode for vs, what were we when he gaue hys moste precyous lyfe for vs, but horryble synners, and hys enemyes? Nowe mekelye tooke he for oure sake all rebukes, mockes, byndynge, beatynge crounynge wyth thorne, and the mooste approbryouse death, It is vndoutedlye aboue oure frayle and corrupte nature to loue our enemyes that dooe hate vs and it is a deade of greater perfection then man hath of him selfe, but GOD that requireth it, wyll gyue grace that we maye doo it yf we aske and seke for it. And therefore in thys petition oure Sauyour Christ teachethe vs to aske thys grace of our heauenlye father that we maye forgeue vs our enemyes, and that he wyll forgeue vs our trespasses, euen soo as we forgeue

them that trespasse agaynst vs.
                     It is farther to be noted, that to forgeue oure brother hys faulte, is also to praye to GOD that he wyll forgeue hym and wil not impute his offence to hym and to wyshe to hym the same grace and glorye, that we desyre vnto our selues and also our selfe when occasion shall comme to helpe hym, as we be bound to help our chrysten brother.
                     And here we thynke it expedient, that lyke as in the former parte of thys petition we haue declared, the parte and duety of hym, whyche should for charityes sake forgeue, so to declare the part and duetye of them to whom forgeuenes shoulde, be made, leaste euyll doers and noughtye mynded people myght, by the former declaration take occasyon styll to perseuer in theyr noughtye myndes an d doynges, and yet clayme for geuenes of theyr neyghbour.
                     Wherfore ye shal vnderstande, that forgeuenes afore spoken of, is not so mente in scrypture, that by it iustice, or lawes of prynces, shoulde be broken, condempned or not executed. For although our Sauyour Chryst in thys petition doth teache vs to remytte and forgeue al iniuryes and trespasses, done agaynst vs, yet he which hathe done the iniurye, or trespasse, is neuerthelesse bounde to acknowledge hys faulte, & to aske forgeuenes therefore not onelye of God, but of hym also, whom he hath offended, and to intende to doo no more so. And furthermore to recompence, and to make amendes, vnto the parties agaynst whō he hath trespassed, accordynge to hys habilytye, and

power, and as the greuousenes, and greatnes of the offence requyreth. And in case he whiche hathe commytted the offence, or trespasse, be obstynate, and wyl not doo these thynges before rehearsed, whyche he is bounde to doo by the lawe of God: than maye the partye whyche fyndeth hym selfe greued, not wythstandynge any thynge that is sayd before in this petition lawefully and wythout offence of Goddes commaundementes aske, and seke, recompense of suche iniuryes as be doone to hym accordynge to the order and prouysion of the lawes of the Realme made in that behalfe, so that he alwaye haue an eye and respecte vnto charitye, and doo 
                           〈◊〉
                         for rancor or malyce or for sinister affection, neyther beare anye hatred in hys harte towardes hym whome he sueth, but onelye vppon a zeale and loue, of the 
                           〈◊〉
                         of

                     As ye would that other men

                     And thus we christen folke, wayinge forgeuenes on the one partye, and the dewtye of hym that is forgeuen on the other partye (as here nowe we be taught)

                        ✚ The exposition or declaration of the syxte petition, which is.
                     
                        And let vs not be led into tentation.
                     
                     FOr the better vnderstandynge of this petition youe shall note fyrste that there be two maner of tentatyons whereof one commethe, and is sene to vs by GOD, who sufferethe those that be his, to be temted by one meanes or other, for there probation, or tryall, albeit he so assystethe and aydeth them in all suche temptations, that he turneth all at the ende vnto theyr benefyte, and profytte. For as the wise man saieth (Eccl. xxviii) Lyke as the ouen trieth the pottets vessell, so doth tentation of trouble trie the righteous man. And with this maner of tentation, God tempted sundry wise, oure holye father Abraham: he tented also Iob with extreme pouertie, horrible sickenes and sodayne death of his children, and daylye he tenteth and proueth all such as he loueth.
                     The other tentation commeth cheifly of the deuyll whyche lyke a furiouse and a woode lyon rageth, and runneth aboute perpetually sekynge how he maye deuour vs. And it commeth also of our owne concupyscence, which continuallye inclineth and styrrethe vs to 
                           〈◊〉
                        , as Saynt Iames sayeth. (Iacob. i.) Euery man is tented, drawen, and 
                           〈◊〉
                         'by hys owne concupyscence Of whyche concupyscence albeit, we haue somewhat spoken before, yet here in no wyse we maye omytte to speake of it agayne.

And therefore knowe ye that thys 
                           〈◊〉
                         is an inclination, and pronitie, of our inordinate nature to synne, whiche imperfection man hathe by the fall of Adam, so that althoughe originall synne, is taken awaye by baptysme, and the displeasure appeased betwixte God and man, yet there remayneth a dysorder and debate, betwene the soule and the fleshe, which shal not be extincte but onely by bodely death. For there is no man so mortifyed, so sequestred from the worlde, and so rauyshed in spiryte, in deuotyon or in contemplation, but that somme concupyscence is in hym, howe be it by goddes grace and mercye it reygneth not, nor is of God accounted for synne, nor is hurtefull, but onelye to them that by consente yelde vnto it. It wyll neuer cease but one waye or other it wyll euer assaulte vs, and yf we do not fyght with it and resiste it continuallye, it wyll ouercome vs, and brynge vs vnto bondage, so that by this oure concupiscence, and our consent, all vyce, and synnes be ingendred: accordynge to the sayinge of saynte Iames, (Iacob. i.) Concupiscence 
                           〈◊〉
                         she doth conceiue, she bringeth forth sinne, and that of all sortes, that is to sai, first actes and dedes, contrary to the lawes of God, and after that vse and custome of the same deedes, and at the length she bringeth furth blindnes and contempte. For so the wyse man sayeth (Prouer. xviii.) The wicked man when he commeth to the bottome of sinne, setteth nought thereby.

But blynded with euyll custome eyther thynke the synne, that he vsethe, to be no synne, or ells yf he take it for synne, yet he: careth not for it, but eyther vpon 
                           〈◊〉
                         trust of the mercye of GOD (which is in dede no ryght truste, but a very presumption) he wyll continue stil in purpose to sinne; or ells vpon vayne hope of longe lyfe, he wyll prolonge, dyffer, and delaye to doo penaunce for the same, vntill the last ende of his lyfe. And often times preuented with sodayne deathe he dieth without repentance.
                     Wherefore considerynge howe daungerouse it is to fall into synne, and howe harde it is to aryse, ye cheif and the best waye is, to resiste (wyth Gods helpe) the first suggestion vnto synne, and not to suffer it to preuayle with vs, but assone as maye be, to put it oute of our myndes. For yf we suffer it to tarye any while in our 
                           〈◊〉
                        , it is a greate peryll, lest that consente, and dede wyll folowe shortly after.
                     Secondly ye shall note, that our sauioure Iesus Chryste doth not teache vs in this sixt petitiō, to pray vnto God our father, that we shoulde be clerely wyth out all tentation: but that he wyll not suffer vs to be ledde into tentation, that is to saye, that whan we be tented, he wyll geue vs grace to with stande it and

                         vs to be ouercome therewith, accordyng where vnto Saynt Paule sayth (i. Corin. (x.) God is true and faythfull and will not suffer vs to be teneed, aboue that we maye beare, but he wyll so moderate the tentation, that we maye susteine and ouercome it. And S. Iames

sayeth (Iacob. i.) Thynke that you haue a greate cause to ioye, when you be troubled with diuers tentations. For the triynge of your faythe bringeth pacience, and pacyence maketh perfect workes, so, that you maye be perfecte and sounde lackynge in nothynge. And almyghtye God also exhorteth vs, and callethe vpon vs to fyghte agaynst tentatiōs saying (Apo. ii.) He that getteth the victorye agaynst them, I shall geue hym to eate of the tree of lyfe. And agayne he sayeth. He that ouercommeth them shall not be hurte with the seconde deathe. And Saint Paule sayeth (ii. Timothy. ii.) No

                         shalbe crowned excepte he fyght lawefullye. That is to saye. Excepte he defende hym selfe and resyste hys enemyes at al poyntes to hys power, & oure sauiour geueth vs a good courage to fyghte in thys battayle, where he sayeth, Ioan. xix. Be of good comforte, for I haue ouercome the worlde, that is to saye: I haue hadde the victorye of all synnes aud tentations, and soo shall you haue yf the faulte be not in youre selues. For ye fyghte wyth an aduersarye, whyche is alredye vanquyshed and ouercome.

                     WOncerning thys, vii. petition ye shall note, that lyke as in the. vi. petytyon Chryste taught vs to desyre and praye our heauenlye father that he woulde preserue vs from the daungerous tentations of the fleshe, the worlde & the deuyll, and not to be ouercome wyth them, euen so nowe in thys seuenth and laste petityon, he dothe teache vs to praye that yf by oure fraylenes and corrupte nature, we through tentation, doo fall into the thraldome of the Deuyll by synne, yet that he wyll sone delyner vs from it, not to lette vs contynue in it, not to lette it take roote in vs, not to suffer synne to reigne vpon vs, but to delyuer vs and make vs free from it.
                     Synne is the excedyng euyll, from the whyche in this petition we desyre to be deliuered: and though in thys petition, be also comprehended ail euylles in the worlde as syckenes, pouertye, deathe, wyth other lyke aduersitie, yet cheifely it is to be vnderstanded of synne, whych onelye of it selfe is euyll, & oughte euer withoute condition to be eschued. And as for other aduersities, neyther we canne ne oughte to refuse when god shall sende them, neyther we oughte to praye for the eschuinge of thē, otherwyse then with this condition, if gods pleasure so be. Many thynges we suffer in this worlde, & take them for euyl but they

be not euyll of them selfe: All afflictions, diseases punyshementes and tormentes of the bodye, all the troubles of thys worlde: and all aduersytyes, be good and necessarye instrumentes of God, for oure saluation. For God hymselfe, who canne not saye other then trueth, sayeth: Apocalip. iii. Those that I loue, I chastyse. And agayne the apostle, Hebre. xii. sayeth, He receyueth none but whom he scorgeth. Thys is a tyme of scourgynge, and the tyme to come, is the tyme of rest ease and blysse. And surelye it is a greate token, that we be in the fauoure of God when he doeth scourge vs, and tryeth & fyneth vs lyke golde in the fyre, whiles we be in thys world As contrarye it is a greate tooken of hys indignatyon towardes vs to suffer vs lyuynge euyll, to contynue in prosperitye, and to haue all thynges after our wyl and pleasure, and neuer to trouble or punyshe vs wyth aduersitye. Therefore oure sauyoure Chryste Iesus (who knoweth what is beste for vs) teacheth vs to praye and to desyre to be delyuered, not cheyfely from worldely afflyctions, trouble and aduersytye, (whyche GOD sendeth habundantlye euen to them whome he beste loueth, and wyth whome he is beste pleased) But the euyll whych we most chieflye should pray to be delyuered from, is 
                           〈◊〉
                        , whyche of it selfe is so euil, that in no wise god can be pleased ther with.
                     And because oure auncient enemy the deuyll, who is the well and sprynge of iniquitye and is not onlye hymselfe an homicide, a lyer, and hater of the trueth from the begynnyng: but also is the verye roote, and occasion of all synne, & the cōmon prouoker & styrrer,

of man to the same, yea and the letter or 
                           〈◊〉
                        , of all vertue and goodnes, because thys enemye neuer cesseth, but continuallye serchethe by all craftes and wyles to enduce vs to sinne, and soo to

                         vs, and to bring vs thereby to euerlastynge damnation: Therefore lyke as we desyre here to be delyuered from synne, soo also we desyre that oure heauenly father wyl saue vs, and defende vs from this euyll, the causer of synne, that is to saye, the Deuyll, and from hys powre, & tyrannye, so that he shall not by his malyce and gyles, entyce and drawe vs into synne, whereby we maye finallye be broughte vnto euerlastynge dampnation, from the whyche also we praye here to be delyuered. And fynallye touchynge thys woorde. Amen. ye shall note that it is here, added vnto the ende of thys most excellent prayer, to teache vs thereby, that yf we doo come soo as we oughte to be prepared for to make this prayer (whych due preparation we before haue declared in the preface of this Pater noster) that then vndoutedlye we shall receiue of our Lorde those thinges nedefull for vs, whiche in thys prayer of the pater noster, we doo aske, whyche that we maye doe, graunt vnto vs the father the sonne and the holye ghoste, to whome be all honoure and glorye worlde wythout ende.
                  
                  Amen.
               
               
                  
                  ¶ Here folowethe the Salutation of the archaungell Gabryell made to the blessed Uyrgyn Mary, taken out of the fyrst chapter of Saint Luke commonlye called the Aue Maria, with the exposition or declaration. thereof.
                  
                     Hayle Marye full of grace, oure Lorde is with the, blessed art thou amongeste all women. And blessed is the fruite of thy wombe.
                  
                  IT is not without greate and weyghtye considerations, that oure forefathers, throughoute the vniuersall or catholyke Churche haue nexte after the Pater noster, set fourthe and commended the Salutation of the Archaungell Gabryell, where wyth he saluted the blessed vyrgyn Marye, mother of our sauiour Iesus Chryst, called the Aue maria, the same to be frequented & deuoutely vsed and sayde of all 
                        〈◊◊〉
                     . For seynge that the hygh messenger of almyghtye God, and heauenly spirite Gabriel, did moste ioyfullye wyth thys salutation greete the Uyrgyn Marye, beynge then a mortall woman liuinge on the earthe, and not hauynge then conceyued in her 
                        〈◊〉
                     , and chaste wombe, our sauiour Chryst, howe much more oughte we mortall earthlye and synnesull creatures, with all promptnesse and 
                        〈◊〉
                     , to salute with the self same woordes, that 
                        〈◊◊〉
                      nowe, when as not

onely she hathe brought forth our sauyour & 
                        〈◊〉
                      Chryst, but also she herselfe is exalted in heauē aboue all aungelles, and archaungelles: Besydes thys also the matter it selfe conteyned in thys Salutation, is of such worthynes, comforte and spirytuall fruyte to the faythfull rememberer, and deuoute frequenter of the same, that all goode men haue alwayes founde them selues by meditation hereof greately edysyed.
                  And thys thinge to no man can seme straunge that wyll duely marcke the pythe, effecte and weyghtye sense in the same salutation conteyned, whyche 
                        〈◊〉
                      wyll here 
                        〈◊〉
                      declare vnto you. And fyrste you shall vnderstand how that it was decreed of the hole 
                        〈◊〉
                      that after the fall of 
                        〈◊〉
                      fyrste father Adam (by whiche mankynde was exiled out of heauen) the second person in Trinitye shoulde take vpon hym the perfecte Nature of man, to redeme mankynde from the power of the Deuyll, and to reconcyle the same agayne vnto hys Lorde God. And for thys purpose (as S. Luke in hys fyrste Chapyter declareth) the aungell Gabryell, was sente from God to the Uyrgin Mari, with the highest message that euer was, which was to treate and conclude a leage of peace, betwene God and manne. And when thys aungell came vnto thys blessed Uirgin, he sayde these wordes. Hayleful of grace oure lorde is with the, blessed arte thou amongest women. And truelye thys worde Hayle or be ioyfull, is a worde moste mete and conuenyent for the aungell, commynge on a message, to begynne hys Salutation wythall. For neuer was there Creature, that hadde soo greate and Iuste cause, to reioyse for anye Benefytte, receyued

at godes handes, as had the blessed byrgyn Marye, for that it pleased almyghtye God to chuse specyallye and appoynte her to that moste excellente and incomparable dignytye, that of her should be con ceyued and borne, Chryste beynge both god and man the sauioure and redemer of all mankynde. And not onelye for this cause or purpose, the aungell beganne with this worde of highe comforte, but also for that he perceyued the virgyn beyng alone would be much abashed and astonyed, at hys marueylous and sodayne comminge vnto her. And therefore thoughte it expedient fyrste of all to vtter thys worde of Ioye, and comforte, whyche myghte also put away al feare from the blessed Uyrgynne. And by these woordes Our lorde is wyth the, is signifyed that GOD, was in the vyrgyn Mary not onelye by essence, power and presence, (as he is in all creatures) nor onely with his speciall grace (as he is in all holye men and women) but he was also in her by receyuynge of oure nature and fleshe of her substaunce, yea the hole Trinitie was with her by a singuler and specyall sorte, for the sonne of god was with her in that she conceyued & bare him. The holye gost was with her for that she by hys power and vertue dyd conceyne. God the father was wyth her, because she in tyme conceyued hys sonne, being of him begottē by eternall generation before all tyme. And by these woordes, blessed arte thou amongeste all women, was mente that there neuer was, nor shall be woman soo blessed as she was.
                  
                     And truelye she maye well be called most blessed 
                        〈◊〉
                      gest all women for that she had greate and hygh prerogatiues whyche neuer other woman euer hadde, hath, or shall haue. Is not this a hygh prerogatyue, that of all women she was chosen to be a mother to the sonne of God? And what excellent honor was she put to whan not withstandyng the decree was made of Chrystes natyuitie by the holye Trinitie, yet the thynge was not done and accomplyshed, wythoute or before her consent was graunted, for the whyche so solempne a messenger was sente? and also howe hygh grace was thys that after the defaulte made throughe the perswasion of the fyrst woman Eue, by whome Adam was brought into disobedyence, and thereby all mankynde to state of dampnation, thys blessed Uyrgyn was electe to be the instrumente, of oure reparation, in that she was chosen to beare the Sauiour and redemer of the worlde. And is not thys a wonderfull prerogatiue, to see a Uyrgyn to be a mother and conceyue her chylde wythout synne? the archaungell myghte therefore worthely saye that she the sayde Mary, was the most blessed of all other women. And wyth these wordes the aungell Gabryell made an ende of this salutation. But yet yee shall note that the wordes folowynge. whyche are And blessed is the fruite of thy wombe. Be not the wordes of the aungell, but of S. Elyzabeth mother of Ihon Baptist, for whan after the departinge of the angel Gabriel the virgyn Marye beynge cōceiued 
                        〈◊〉
                      Christ, came to salute her cosē Elizabeth, she the sayde Elyzabethe beynge inspyred wyth the holy Ghost, & thereby knowyng yt the vyrgyn Mary

was conceyued wyth Chryste, spake the aforesayde wordes of the fruyte, being in the vyrgyns wombe, it is to wytte, of our sauiour 
                        〈◊〉
                     . And here is also an other wonderfull thynge to be noted, for (as it appeareth in the fyrst chapyter of Saynte Luke) the chylde in S. Elizabethes wombe, that is to saye, Saynt Ihon Baptiste (whiche yet had scant lyfe) gaue testimonye to thys frute, that it shoulde saue hym and all the worlde, and as a prophette he dyd lepe for ioye, in his mothers wombe, and althoughe he coulde not than speake, yet neuerthelesse he declared by such signes, and tokens as he coulde, that blessed was the fruyte of that wombe. And worthe ly the thyng is called ye fruyte of her wombe, in yt the substaunce of the nature of man, whych our sauiour Chryste toke vpon hym, was taken of the nature of the moste blessed vyrgyn, and of her wombe. And so therefore it is called the fruyte, of her wombe. And he maye well be called the blessed fruyte, for that he hath saued vs, and gyuen vs lyte, contrarye to the cursed fruyte, whych Eue gaue to Adam, by whiche we were dystroyed, and broughte to deathe: But blessed is the fruyte of thys wombe, whyche is the fruyte of lyfe euerlastyng. And it is here to be noted that althoughe thys falutatyon be not a prayer of petition, supplication, or request, or suyte: Yet neuerthelesse, the Churche hath vsed, to adioyne it to the ende of the Pater noster, as an hymne or prayer, of laude, and prayse, partely of our lorde, and sauyoure Iesus Chryst, for oure redemptyon, and partelye of the blessed virgin, for her humble consent, gyuen, and

expressed, to the auugell at hys salutation. In dede, laudes, prayses, & thankes are in thys 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         Maria, pryncypally gyuen, and yelded to our Lord, as to thauetor of our redemption: but yet here wythall the vyrgyn lackethe not her laudes, prayse, and thankes, for her excellent and synguler vertues, and chyefiye, for that she beleued, and humbly consented, accordynge to the 
                        〈◊〉
                      of the holye Matrone S. Elizabethe, whan she sayd to thys vyrgyn. Luce. i. Bessed arte thou, that dyddest geue truste, and credence, to the aungelles wordes: for all thynges that haue ben spoken vnto the, shalbe 
                        〈◊〉
                     . Who is there now that hathe a good Chrysten heart and considereth the meanyng, the effecte folowyng the aucthor, and other the cyrcumstances of the Aue Maria, that wyll not counte, and iudge them vnworthy of the name of Chrysten men, who of late yeres, not onely haue in all theyr bokes, and other prynted papers, of purpose lefte oute thys godlye salutation, disdaynyng at the honour of the blessed vyrgyn Mary here in conteyned, but haue also to the vttermoste of theyr power, by theyr enuyinge agaynste the common commendable and deuout: vse thereof, gone about to plucke it cleane ont of mennes heartes, and myndes, and so for euer to abolyshe the memorye 
                        〈◊〉
                      her blessednes, moste contrarye to the determination of the holy ghoste, by the mouthe of the same vyrgyn declared when she sayd (Luk. i.) Fece enim ex hoc 
                           〈◊〉
                         me dicent omnes generationes That is to saye, Beholde 
                        〈◊〉
                      from hence forth all generations shall

call me blessed, whyche thynge lyke as the aungell of God, and the godly matrone Elizabeth then dyd, the vyrgyn Marye, as then, beyng in mortall estate, and neyther Chryst of her then borne, nor man kynde then by Chryste redemed. So nowe, for that the sonne of thys blessed vyrgyn, hath bothe redemed vs, and also all mankynde, from eternall damnation, and she her selfe nowe is mooste gloriouselye placed in heauen, in state of immortalitie: And thyrdly that suche notable examples also herein set before our eyes, by the Aungell and Elizabeth: And fynally for that the holy goost dyd playnelye saye that all generations shoulde frome thenseforthe call her blyssed, for these respectes, I saye, the hole catholyke churche doth moost ioyfully vse and frequent the sayde salutation, and so must we do, yf we wil be true members of the Catholyke churche.

                  FOrasmuch as the people of my dioces, beyng within your seueral cures, & charge, do (as in dede of reason they maye) loke for to haue at theyr pastours hand, or at the least way, by his prouision, & meane, good instruction, and teachinge, especiallye howe to serue and please God, and how also otherwyse to do their dutie, as to any one of them in theyr degre doth appertayne. And forasmuch also as there is not now a dayes that multitude, and plenteth of preachers, whiche in tymes past hath ben, and by Gods grace, hereafter shalbe. And fynallye, for that euery one of you in your owne person, is not able to discharge the office of preaching, which many good folke do greatly wyshe, and desyre ye could, and woulde. Therfore desyrynge to haue somethyng doue onward, til God of his goodnes prouide something better, I haue laboured with my chapleyns, & frendes, to haue these Homelies prynted, that ye may haue somewhat to instruct, and teache your flocke withall, requyrynge, and charginge euerye one of you, that diligentlye, vpon the sondayes, and holydayes, ye reade to youre flocke, frutefully, and deliberately, one of the said Homelies.

                  ¶ An Homely, of the creation and fall of man.
                  THe Prophette, Dauid in his fore score and nintēth psalme, exhortyng all people to synge prayse to almighti god, to serue hī in gladnes, and re ioyse in his sight, alledgeth thys as a sufficient cause thereof. Scitote quoniam ipse est dominus, ipse fecit nos, et non ipsinos. which is to saye.Psalme, cxix. Know you that he is our Lord, it is he that made vs, and we made not our selfes. And in dede, who yt diligently wayeth ye creatiō of man, can not but therin most highly laude, & prayse almighty god, his creator. For wher in the creation of al other visible thinges, he did but onely commaunde, & will that they should be made, and incontinēt they were made; in the creatyng of man, he vsed great solempnitie, and many notable circumstaunces. Fyrst touchyng mā, he said, let vs make mā, which wordsGenes. i. be as it were the wordes of god the father, to God the sonne, & to the holy ghost, spoken after the maner of men, when they go about some great matter, at what time they take good aduisement or they begyn, and doo ioyne with the best, & wysest counsellours,

that they can get. Thys circumstaunce (not beyng necessary of goddes parte, as withoute the which he might haue created man) doth most manifestly declare the special fauour, of almyghty god towardes mankynde: but that nexte circumstaunce, which doth immediatly folowe thys fyrst, is a more surer profe, and declaration of gods tender loue, towardes mā, whē he sayth, Let vs make man to our owne similitude & likenes, Now mark, good people, howe much god dyd for vs in our creation. He made vs in very dede like vnto himselfe; & in so doynge what could he haue done more for vs? A wonderfull excellēt benefite & comfort is it vnto vs, to consyder that man was made like vnto god. And to vnderstand this thyng the better, you shall know that the similitude, and likenes of man to god, was not in the body of man (for this you must moost certenly beleue, yt the godhed is a spirite, & not a bodely substaunce) but this similitude and likenes was in ye soule, which was endued, with most heuenly & godlike qualities, as vnderstandyng, memory, and wil; with sondry gyftes also of grace. And here is to be noted by the way; that where almighty god sayeth, Let vs make man to our owne similitude, & lykenes, he geueth vs to vnderstād, yt there be three parsons in trinitie, & yet but one god. For in that he sayeth let vs make man, therein is signified, a pluralitie, or number of persones: agayne, in that he sayeth to our similitude and likenes, and not to oure similitudes and lykenesses, by thys is signyfyed the

vnitie also of one nature and substaunce. But to procede further concernyng the creation of man; ye shall vnderstand, that the second chapter of Moyses
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 2. boke, called 
                        〈◊〉
                     , in speciall maner doth recorde the seuerall making, as well of the bodye of man, by it selfe, as also of the soule by it selfe. And as touching the body, scrypture doth there say, that. God fourmed, or shaped it, of ye earthe Noting therby the excellēcy of mans body, aboue the bodyes of other liuynge creatures. For we rede not of anye other lyuyng creature, that god shaped, or fourmed, the body of it, but onely that he made it; and that at the cō maundement of almighty god, the earth broughtGenesis. 1. fourth foure foted beastes, & the water, in like maner, brought fourth fysshes, & foules. Only of yt body of mā scripture wituesseth yt God shaped it. And as cōcerning ye soule of mā, it is written of it, in the sayd second chapter of genesis, howe yt god breGenesis. 2. thed it into the body; which. ii. circumstaunces, as they import a marueylous excellency of man, aboue other bodely creatures, so they most clerely declare thexcedyng great goodnes of God, towardes man. Now when god had, in such a singuler fashion, creted man, he gaue hym souereigntie ouer all the fysshes of the sea, ouer the foules of the ayer, and ouer the beastes of the lande, yea and made him a Kyng, and Emperour on the earth. And yet not satisfyed with al this, he placed man in Paradyse, that is in a most pleasaunt garden, where he had planted all

kynd of frute, beautifull to beholde, and delicious to eate, for man to fede vpon; onely one kynde of fruyte he charged hym on payne of death, (and that not of the body alone, but of the soule also) vtterlye to refrayne from; which was the fruyte of the tree called in scrypture, the tre of knowledge of good, and euyl. And lyke as in a most maruelous sorte he made Adam the fyrsteman, so in as marueylous, & straunge a sort he made Eue the first woman, euen of a rybbe taken out of Adams lefte syde; and her he made parfytte, and furnyshed her with like gyftes as he had done Adame the first man: What canne we then thinke, or deuyse, that God might haue don more for vs in our creation, then herein he dyd: He made the soule immortall, that is such as shulde continue for euer without ende. He furnished it with moste singuler gyftes both of nature and of special grace also The body of man, in the estate of originall innocencie, had in it helth, strength, 
                        〈◊〉
                     , and other like qualities, in the highest degre of perfection; it had in it selfe then, no fond lust, or concupiscens; no pronitie or inclination to euyl; no 
                        〈◊〉
                      in doing good, no infirmitie or wekenesse, no lacke or want of any qualitie fyt and decent for it. The body of man was then obediente to the soule; the soule altogether obedient to God. So that on Gods parte, oure maker and creator, there is nothyng towardes vs but all perfection, all great kyndnes, al fatherly loue, & fauour, Holy scrypture most euydently affyrmeth yt al creatures were made good in their creation, saying. Vidit deus 
                           〈◊〉
                         fecerat et erant ualde bona,

is. God sawe al things which he had made, and they were very good. Which thyng as it is generally true in all creatures concerning their creation, so is it in a certen degre of excellencye to be verified in man touchyng the estate of his originall innocency. Thus we may perceaue yt in the creation of man, al was excellent & parfytte; whiche oughte greatly to inflame vs the more to loue and serue almighty God our most louynge creator. But for asmuche as that blessed estate is lost, & mankynd by yt losse thereof, fell into extreme miserie and wretchednes, it is consequently to be well considered of our part, by what meanes man was brought from soo good and blessed a case, to so euyll and miserable an estate; whiche poynte well wayed, is a sufficiente grounde to cause vs on the other syde vtterly to detest & abhorre al synne. For that greuous fal of man came of synne. Synne it was, for which God thrust man oute of paradyse; synne it was that caused the fleshe to striue agaynste the spirite, and the spirite, agaynst the fleshe; synne it was that broughte vnto mankynde necessitie of bodyly death, and all the infirmities and diseases, which man in thys transitory lyfe sustayneth; synne fynally it was, that cau sed all the posteritie of Adam and Eue to be borne in state of dampnation. But some perchaunce are desyrous fardar to knowe, by what meanes man was fyrst brought to commytte synne. For the vnderstandyng whereof, lette vs haue recourse to theGenes. 3. iii. chap. of Genesis, where it is wrytten: how that yt wyly serpent the deuyll came vnto Eue and sayde

vnto her: Why hath God gyuen you commaundement not to eate of euery tree in paradyse? where vnto the woman answered and sayde, of the fruyte which is in paradise we eate, but of the frute of that tree yt groweth in the myddest of paradyse, GOD hath charged vs not to eate or touche it? leste, per chaunce we dye. Then sayde the serpente to the woman: Naye, you shall not dye. For God knowethe that whatsoeuer daye you shall eate thereof, youre eyes shalbe opened, and you shalbe like Gods, knowynge good and euyll. The woman therefore saw that the tree was good to eate of, and beautifull to the eye, and pleasaunte to beholde, and she tooke of the fruite thereof and d d eate, and gaue part to her husbāde, who also did 
                        〈◊〉
                     .
                  Thus through the prouocation of the deuyll, man first fell into synne. Wherefore as we must alwayes abhorre synne and forbeare it, because of the greate misery it brought vs vnto; so shold we no les 
                        〈◊〉
                     , and to the vttermost of our power, fly the

                      made them disobey gods commauudement: by whych their doynge, they lost, the oryginal great innocency which they had at there creation; which being lost, nether the body woulde be obedient to ye soule, nor the soule to god, but al was in man turned vpsidoune: yea therby they fell also into necessitie of temporall death of body, and (which is worst of all) into the estate of eternall damnation, and euerlasting death, both of body and soule. But now, because it maye paraduenture seme in some mans iudgement, that seyng the thing that Adam and Eue did, was but the eatyuge of an appell, therefore their faut was not great, nor deserued so greuous punish ment; 
                        〈◊〉
                      vs consyder the cyrcumstaunces, and we shall sone perceyue the offence not lyght, but verye sore and heynous. Fyrst the thyng whych god commaunded man to forbeare, was a thyng moste easye for hym to forbeare, and so much was hys faute the greater. Besides this, whan a man is tolde before of great peryll and daunger that shall lyght vpon hym if he doo thys or that, in case after suche warnyng he offende therein, hys fault is thereby made the

                     . Thyrdly, the lesse inclynatyou a man hath to any synne, the more he synneth yfhe doo the same, Nowe Adam and Eue, had in them no inclynation

at al, nother to one vice nor to other. Fourthly, whē a man hath late receyued great benefites at hys soueraygns handes, if he incontmently breake his expresse wyll, the contempt and dysobedience is made therby the greater. The thyng that Adam and Eue dyd eate, was in dede but an appell, yet the eatyng thereof in that case, was an high disobediēce against god, and the corrupting of al mankynd, for as much as they two were the verye route, whereof all men muste ryse; and the route being once naughte, howe can the tree or braunches, cummynge of that route, be good?

                  ¶ An Homelye of the redemption of man.
                  IT was declared vnto you, good christen people, in ye last homelye, howe oure fyrste parentes Adā and Eue, were by the synguler goodnes, and especiall fauoure of almyghtye God, created ryghte worthye creatures, and in the estate of parfytte innocencye. It was also shewed howe thorought disobedience to theyr creator, they broughte them selues, and al mankind, into the estate of euerlastynge damnation. Now shall you consequentlye heare, of the delyueraunce of man, out of that dampnable estate, that is, of oure redemption. For the vnderstandynge whereof, you must perfytlye beare in mynde that the whole nature of man, both in bodye and soule, was thorough orygynall sinne, greatelye defiled. For the soule (whych is the cheyf part of mā) loste thereby the especiall gyftes of grace, wyth whyche it was indued in the creation; and besydes that, it was also 
                        〈◊〉
                      in the gyftes of nature, as in memorye, intelligence, wyll, and other lyke. And the body (whych is the inferior parte) it also was by the meanes of orygynall synne, brought to the necessarye estate of mortalitie, so that it muste nedes die,

and was throughe that synne of our sayde fyrste parentes made weke, and brought to be subiecte, to 
                        〈◊〉
                      drye kindes of infirmities, and syckenes: and nother coulde God, of his iustice, receaue man againe to fauor, and state of eternall lyfe (beynge thus in body and soule, by his owne defaulte desyled) vules he were first made pure, and cleane againe: nether man was able to helpe hym selfe herein, no, nor yet anye angell at al. Wherefore, almyghty God (whose mercy excedeth all hys workes) pytienge the wretched case that mankinde was in, dyd appoynt, euen from the begynnynge, his onely sonne, the seconde person in trinitie, to be the sauiour of the worlde, and to restore mā agayne, to perfit clennes, both in body, and soule; and that by the way of very iustice, in making a sull amendes, and payinge a sufficiente raunsome for synne. And thys sonne of God (accordinge to the wyll of his father,) dyd take vpon hym the nature of man, ioynynge to hys euerlastynge Godheade, the whole, and 
                        〈◊〉
                      nature of manhode; not making that nature of man, which he toke, a new of nothing as he dyd heauen and earth; nor yet makynge it, of a clod of earth, as he dyd yt body of Adam, but he 
                        〈◊〉
                      the nature of man, of the very substaunce of the vyrgyn Mary his mother; that like as Adam and Eue, brought them selues & all theyr posteritie, through synne, into the estate of eternal dampnatiō: so Christ takinge vpon him, the very selfe same nature, beyng descended from Adam and Eue, vnto the 
                        〈◊〉
                      Mary, and of her beynge taken, and ioyned in hym to the 
                        〈◊〉
                     , in 
                        〈◊〉
                      of person, should by his in,

nocency, & through death, wyllingly suffered in that his most innocent bodye, not only hym self, become immort 
                        〈◊〉
                     , & haue glory euerlasting, but make so many also, partakers of lyke blessednes, as shulde en ioye the merites of his passion. Wherefore, it is a very pernicious errour, to thynke that chryst toke not his fleshe, of the verye fleshe of the blessed Uyrgyne Mary his mother. How coulde his death haue done me good, yf it were not of the same nature that I am of? & therefore S. Paule in hys seconde chapyter ofHeb. ii. his Epistle to the Hebrues sayeth. Qui sanctificat, et qui sanctificantur, ex vno omnes, that is. He that santyfyeth, and they whych are sanctifyed, are all of one. and within a lytle after he sayeth farther, Debuit per omnia fratribus assimulari, vt misericors fieret, fidelis 
                           〈◊〉
                        , ad 
                           〈◊〉
                        ,

                         repropitiaret delicta populi, that is Christe muste in al poyntes, become like to his brethern, that he myght be a mercifull & fruithfull Bysshop to God ward, to procure merci for the sinnes of the people. If Chryst toke not the flesh of yt Uirgin Marye, howe is that promyse fulfylled, which God made immediately after the falle of our first parētes, when he thrust them out of paradise, at which tyme, he said vnto the serpente (as it is written in ye thyrdeGene. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . chapiter Genesis.) I wyll set 
                        〈◊〉
                      betwixt the, and the womans sede, and it shall treade downe thy hedde: Lo, how mercifully God dealeth wyth mankynde, He promysed that one shoulde be borne of the sede and stocke of Eue, which should

banquyshe our ghostly enemy the diuell. Nowe in that he calleth hym the sede of the woman, he moste playnely declareth, that he must nedes haue in hym the selfe same nature that the woman had. Agayne God makyng the second promyse of the same sede, to come of the stocke of Abraham the patriarke said vnto Abraham, (as is wytnessed in the. xxii. of Genesys) In thy sede shall all the nations of theGen. 122. world be blessed; & many hūdred yeres after yt, he promyssed lyke wyse to 
                        〈◊〉
                      Dauyd, that, the sede should come of hym to. Which promyses of al myghty God, were not to be verified in Chryst, if he toke not yt substaūce of his fleshe, of the Uirgin Mary his mother. But here it may seme straūge to some, yt almighty god (seing he intēded from ye beginninge, to sēd hys sonne into yt world, to be incarnate for mans redēption) did defer the sendinge of hym soo longe, that is, the space of foure thousande yeares or theraboute. To whome it is to be aunswered, that the long taryinge of Chryste, before he was incarnate, came not of lacke of good wyl in god, towardes vs; but of vnredines, and lacke of good disposytion, to 
                        〈◊〉
                      hym on oure partes. For if Chryste shoulde haue commen in the begynnyng of the worlde, men would haue thought, that if God had suffered them to vse theyr owne natural powers, thei would haue attayned 
                        〈◊〉
                      wel inough, wythout any other helpe on Godes parte. Agayne, thoughe after longe experience, and trauayle of man, folowing the onelye lyghte, of nature, it was euydente, that he ne ded a specyall ayde from God, to the attaynynge

of euerlastynge lyfe, yet the worlde myghte haue demed, that in case God of hys goodnes, had geuen vnto manne some speciall lyghte, and knowledge of hys wyll and pleasure, that then vndoughtedlye, wythout farther helpe, he folowynge suche specyall lyght, and knowledge, myght be able well inoughe to attayne to euerlastynge lyfe. Therefore, to take all suche excuses a waye, and that we should plainelye vnderstande, that after we once fell into synne, neyther the light of nature in vs neyther the knowledge of the wyll of God, by speciall reuelation opened vnto vs, was able to helpe vs; god suffred mankynde to trauel, fyrst by the light of nature, secondly by the lawe of Moyses, and yet man ranne styll farther, and farther, into damnation. Whereby it appereth, that thoughe knowledge of the truth be necessa ry, to the attayning of 
                        〈◊〉
                      lyfe, yet suche knowledge (be it neuer so great) beyng in a man cor rupted with sinne, is to feble and to weake to purge hym of sinne. For purgation & clensing of sinne, commeth by some other meanes, besides yt knowledge of the truth: aud therfore S. Paule in the fyrste chapiter of his epystle to the Romaines, most plainly 
                        〈◊〉
                      meth, that in the time of yt law of nature, men knew inough of God, but yet, not withstanding theyr kno ledge, they fell into abhominable idolatry. The wordes of S. Paule, in that place are these. So much as may be knowen of god, is manifest in thē (that is to saye, in those whyche liued vnder the law of nature, from Adam vnto Moyses) For his inui

sible thynges, euen his eternal power, & godhed were sene of thē, being vnderstanded by the works of the 
                        〈◊〉
                      of the world; so that they are without excuse, bicause, that when they knew God, they gloryfyed hym not as god, nether were thankeful, but becam ful of vanitie in their imaginacions. And as yt lyght whiche men had by the lawes of nature, was not of force, to kepe them from synne, so nether the lawe of Moyses, beyng opened from god hym selfe by special reuelatiō could suffice to ryde mā from sinne (as S. Paule in the second chapiter of hys foresayde epistleRoma, 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      testifieth saying) Behold thou art a Jew, and thou doest rest in the law, and doest glory in god, and doest know hys wyl and plea sure, & being instructed in the lawe, thou doest allowe that is best, and doest truste that thou art a guyde of the blinde, a light to thē which art in darkenes, an instructour of the foly she, a mayster of the ignorante, and that thou knowest by the lawe the fourine of sciens & truth: but yet thou that teachest other teachest not thy selfe; thou ye prechest against aduoutri, art an aduoutrer thy self, thou that dooest defye Idoles, commyttest 
                        〈◊〉
                      thy selfe; thou that doest glorye in the lawe, through transgressing of the lawe, doest dyshonor

God, for the name of God, throughe you, is blasphemed amongest the gentyles.
                  Thus it is 
                        〈◊〉
                     , by the doctryne of Saynte Paule, that nother by the common lawe of nature, nether by the special knowledge of the law of Moises, man was able to auoyde eternal dāpnation; but that he neded, besides such kōwledge, of some other helpe, that is, of amendes, to be made for hys sinnes, and thereby, to be reduced into the fauour of god againe, and to haue aboundaunce of grace 
                        〈◊〉
                      vnto hym, by whych grace he should both in hys know ledge be yt better established, & be able also, according to knowledge of ye truth, to walke in the truth. For thys amendes to be made, the second person in trinitie, being god immortal, became mortal mā, & was made in all partes lyke vnto one of vs (sinne only ex cepted) 
                        〈◊〉
                      he did vnite vnto his godhead, the body and soule of man, in vnitie of person, in such a merue lous sort, that as in vs, the body being of 
                        〈◊〉
                      nature and the soule being of an other nature, doo make yet but one person, so in hym the nature of God, and the whole perfect nature of man, doo make but one person. Of this

prophetes, whyche were to be fulfylled of hym before hys passion, then he suffred death willingly, yea the death of the crosse, by suche payne, (wrongefully procured of the deuil agayne him) to raunsome man kynde oute of captiuitie, whiche it sustayned vnder the deuyll moost iustly: and that thys ran̄some shold be perfyt, he suffred sondry sortes of mooste spytefui wronges, and intollerable paynes, & tormentes, in his most pure, and innocent body; as buffeting, bindinge, scourgyng, plattynge on his head, a crowne of thorne, hanginge on the crosse, pearcynge of his handes and fete with nayles, openynge of hys syde with a speare, and shedynge of his mooste precyous bloude; whiche passion of his, as it is a moost parfyt myrrour, and glasse for vs, there in to beholde the excedyng great loue of god towarde vs, whiche spared not hys onelye sonne, but for vs all gaue hym to dye, so it is a sufficient occasion, to brynge al men in extreme hatred of the deuyll, and synne: from daunger of whome, mankynde coulde not be rydde, but onely by so playnefull a death, of the sonne of God.
                  What can we loke for at gods handes, yf we synne from hence forth, but wrath and vengeaunce, seyng he hath once delyuered vs from synne, by so merciful a meanes: All that our sauyoure Christe suffered, he wyllingely suffered for our synnes, hym selfe hauing neuer deserued anye whyt of payne, as who neuer synned. And yet hys passion, though it be in it selfe a sufficiente raunsome, for the synnes of the whole worlde, yet it taketh not place in all men: not for insufficiencie in it selfe, but for defaulte in them, that

shoulde condignely receaue the merites therof. For this you must know; that God requyreth in vs certayne thinges, to be accomplished by our owne wiland consent, without the which, we can not ve saued, no more, than yf Christ had neuer dyed for vs. What thinges these are, shalbe hereafter declared vnto you. In the meane season, lyft vp your hartes, and open them awyde, to receaue in vnto them, a great loue towardes God, who so nobylye created vs and when we, through our owne default were fallen into the estate of endles miseri, and wretchednes, so mercyfully redemed vs, by the passion, and death of his onelye sonne our sauiour Christ.

For the flesh lusteth contrary to the spirit and the spirit contrary to the flesh. These are cōtrary one to another, so yt you do not what ye would: But and yf ye beled of the spirit, then are ye not vnder the law.

And in2 Peter. 3 the thyrde chapyter of the same Epystle, he sayeth further, that in S.

                      of theMath. 22. Pharises beyng a doctour of the lawe, tēping, did aske him and say, maister, what is the great cōman̄demēt in ye law? Jesus,

                      vnto him. Thou

                      loue thy 
                        〈◊〉
                      God, with al thy harte, wyth all thy soule, and with althy hole minde this is (sayeth he) the greateste, and firste 
                        〈◊〉
                     . And the seconde is like vnto it. Thou 
                        〈◊〉
                      loue thy neig hboure, as thy selfe and of these two commaundements al the lawe doth

                     , and the Prophetes. And forasmuch also, as we can not loue God well excepte we doo loue our neyghboure, in a due order ne yet loue our neyghboure, well, excepte we doo

                     
                        〈◊〉
                      God, in that due order, that we oughte to doo, (Sainct Jhon the euangelist so testifyeng, and declaryng,Iohn

                      in the thyrde and fourthe Chapiters of his fyrst canonical Epistle.) And finally, forasmuche as he that loueth not after this sorte, is (by the testimonye of the sayde sainct John, in the sayd thyrd Chapiter) iudged to be in death, therfore it is ryght expediente, and necessarye, to haue alwyes thys loue, whiche nowe in oure vulgare tonge, and common talke, is ofte named, by the name of Charitie, but ve ry megerly, and coldely practised, and set fourthe in dede, as it shoulde be. And of truthe, yf we woulde iudge vpryghtly, and well, we ought to saye, that of all thinges that be good, to be taught vnto Christen people, there is no thing more necessarye to be spoken of, and daylye called vpon, then charitie: as wel for that al maner of woorkes of righteousnes, be cō
                     teyned in it, as also, that the decaye thereof, is the 
                        〈◊〉
                      of the world, the banysh ement of vertue, and the cause of all vice. And forasmuch, as almost euery mā maketh, & frāeth to hym selfe a charity, after hys owne appetyte, and how 
                        〈◊〉
                      so euer his lyfe be, bothe vnto God, and man, yet he perswadeth with hymselfe styll, that he hathe chatitye: Therefore you shall here nowe a true, and playne descryption of charity, not of mens ymagination, but of the very woordes, and example of our sauioure Jesus Christe. In whyche description, euerye man (as it were in a glasse) may consider him selfe, and see plai nely, without error, whether he be in the true Charitye or not.

charitie is to loue God, with al oure harte, withall our life, with al our powers, & with al our strength Wyth all our harte. that is to say, yt our hartes, mynde, & studie, be set to 
                        〈◊〉
                      his woorde, to trust in hym and to loue him aboue all other thynges, whyche we doo loue best, in heauen or in earthe. Wyth all oure lyfe that is to saye, that our chief ioye, and delite, be sette vpon him and his honoure, and our hole lyfe gyuen vnto the seruyce of hym, aboue al thynges, wyth hym to lyue, and wyth 
                        〈◊〉
                      to dye, yea, and to forsake all other thynges, rather then hym. For he that loueth hys father or mother, sonne, or doughter, house or lād, more 
                        〈◊〉
                      me (saith Christ) is not worthy to haue me. 
                        〈◊〉
                      all oure powers. that is to say, that with our handes, and feet, wyth our eyes, and eares, 
                        〈◊◊〉
                      and tongues, and wyth all other parts & powers, both of body and of soule, we shoulde be gyuen to the 
                        〈◊〉
                      pynge, and fulfyllyng of hys commaundementes. This is is the fyrst, and the principal part of chariti but it is not the whole. For charitie, is also to 
                        〈◊〉
                      euery man, good, and 
                        〈◊〉
                     , frende, and fooe: And 
                        〈◊〉
                      cause be gyuen to the contrary, yet neuertheles, to beare good wil, and hart vnto euerye man, to vse our selues wel vnto thē as well in woordes, and countenaūce, as in all our outward actes, and dedes. For so Chryst hym selfe 
                        〈◊〉
                      & so also he perfourmed in dede. And of this loue that we ought to haue amōgest oure selues, eche to other he instructeth vs thus. (Mathewe. v.) You haue

harde it taught in tymes past? Thou shalte loue thy frende, and hate thy fooe: but I tell you loue your enemyes, speake wel of them that diffame you, & doe speake euil of you: doo well to thē that hate you, praye for thē that vexe & persecute you, that you may be 
                        〈◊〉
                      childrē of your father, that is in heauen. For he maketh the sunne to ryse bothe vpō the euyl, and good, and sendeth rayne to the iuste, & to the vniust. For if you loue them that loue you, what rewarde shal you haue. Doo not the publicans lykewyse? And yf you speake well onely of them, that be your brethren, and derely beloued frendes. What greate matter is that? doo not the heathē yt same also. These be the very woordes of oure saui our Chryst him selfe, touching the loue of our neigh bour. And forasmuch as the Pharisies (wyth 
                        〈◊〉
                      moste pestilent traditiōs, false interpretations, and gloses) had corrupted, and almoost clerely stopped vp, this pure well, of Gods iyuely word, 
                        〈◊〉
                      that this loue, and charytie, pertayned onelye to a mans frendes, and that it was sufficient for a man to loue them whyche doo loue hym, and to hate his fooes: therefore Christe did open this well agayne, purged it, and scourged it, by giuinge vnto his god lye lawe of Charitie, a true and clere interpretatiō, which is this: that we ought to loue euery mā, both

frende, and fooe: addyng thereto, what commodity we shal haue therby, and what in cōmodity by doynge the contrarye. What thynge can we wyshe so good for vs, as the heauenlye father, to repute, and take vs, for hys chyldren? And this shall we be sure of (sayeth Christ,) yf we loue euery man, without ex ception. And yf we doo otherwyse (sayeth he,) we be no better thā Phariseis, Publicans, and heathen persons, and shall haue oure rewarde wyth them: that is, to be excluded from the nūber of gods electe chyldren, and from hys euerlastyng inheritaunce in heauen. Thus of true Charitye, Christ taught, that euery man is bounde to loue God aboue al thinges and to loue euery man, frende, and fooe.
                  And thus lykewyse, he dyd vse hym selfe, exhortyng hys aduersaryes, rebukynge the faultes of hys aduersaryes, and whan he coulde not amende them, yet he prayed for theym. Fyrste he loued God his father, aboue al thinges, so much, that he sought not hys owne glorye, and wyll, but the glorye, and wyll of hys father: Iseke not (sayde he Iohn. v.) myne owne wyll, but the wyll of hym that sent me: Nor he refused not to dye, to satysfye hys fathers wyll, saying.

                        〈◊〉
                     , and in theyr actes, and dedes, pursued him wyth al their

myght, and power, euē vnto death. Yet al this notwythstanding, he with drewe not hys fauour from theim, but styll loued them, preached vnto them, of loue rebuked theyr false dortrine, theyr wycked lynynge, and dyd good vnto them, 
                        〈◊〉
                      acceptynge whatsoeuer they spake, or dyd, agaynste him When they gaue hym euell wordes, he gaue noue euyll agayne, when they did stryke hym, he did not

                      agayne. And when he suffred deathe, he dyd not 
                        〈◊〉
                      them, nor threaten them, but prayed for thē and referred all thynges to his fathers wyll. And as a shepe that is led vnto the shambles to be slaineEsai.

Thus haue I des cribed vnto you, what charitie is, aswell by the doc tryne, as by the example of Chryst him selfe, whereby also, euery man may without errour, know hym selfe, what state and condition he standeth in: whe ther he be in charitie (and so the chylde of the father in heauen) or not. For although almoste euery

For who soeuer dothe not loue hys brother, belongeth not vnto God. But yt peruerse nature of man, corrupte wyth sinne, and desti tute of Gods word, and grace, thinketh it against all reason, that a man should loue hys enemye, and hath many perswasions, whyche induceth hym to the contrarye. Agaynste all whyche reasones, we ought aswell to set the teachyng, as the lyuynge of oure sauioure Chryst, who louynge vs (when wee were hys enemyes) dothe teache vs to loue our ene myes. He did paciently take for vs many reproches

suffred beatynge, and moost cruell deathe. Therfore we be no memberes of hym, yf we wyll not folowe hym. For as S. Peter sayeth, Chryst suffered for vs, leauynge vs an example, that we shouldi.

                      folowe hym. Furthermore we must consider that to loue oure frendes, is no more but that which theues, adulterers, homicides, and all wycked persons doo: in so muche that Iewes, Turkes, Iufidels, and all brute beastes, doo loue them that bee theyr frendes, of whome they haue theyr lyuynge, or any other benefites. But to loue our enemyes, is the proper cō dition onely of them, that be the children of God, the disciples and folowers of Christ. Notwithstanding mans frowarde and corrupte nature, wayeth ouer depely many times, the offence and displeasure done vnto hym by enemyes, and thynketh it a burdenintollerabel, to be bounde to loue them, that hate hym. But the burden shoulde be easye yuoughe, yf (on the other syde) euery man woulde consyder, what dyspleasure he hath done to hys enemy agayne, & what pleasure he hath receyued of hys enemye. And yf we fynde no egall recompence, neyther in receyuing pleasures of our enemy, nor in rendryng dyspleasure vnto hym agayne: then let vs ponder the dyspleasu res, whyche we haue done agaynste almighty God Howe often, and howe greuously, we haue offended hym.

                  But here may ryse a necessary question, to be dyssolued. If charity requyre to thinke, speake, and doo well vnto euery man, bothe good and euyl, how can magystrates execute iustyce vpon malefactoures, with charytye? Howe can they caste euyll men into prison, take away theyr goodes, and sometyme theyr lyues, accordynge to lawes: yf Charytye 
                        〈◊〉
                      not suffer them so to doo? Herevnto, is a plaine and brief answer, that plages and punishementns be not euel of them selues, yf they be well taken of innocentes: and to an euyll man, they are bothe good and necessarye: and may be executed accordynge to charitye, and with charity should be executed. For declaracion whereof, you shal vnderstande, that charity hath two offices, the one contrarye to the other: and yet 
                        〈◊〉
                      necessarye to the vsed, vpon men of contrarye sorte, and dysposion. The one office of Charitye, is, to cherishe good, and innocent men. Not to oppresse them, with false accusations, but to incourage them wyth rewardes to doo well, & 
                        〈◊〉
                      in well dooynge: defendynge them wyth the sworde, frō theyr 
                        〈◊〉
                     . And the offyce of Byshops, and

pastours, is to laude good men, for wel doyng, that they maye perseuer therein, and to rebuke and correct, by 
                        〈◊〉
                      woorde of God, the offēces, and 
                        〈◊〉
                      of all euyll disposed persons.
                  The other office is, to rebuke, correcte, & punysh, vyce, without acceptation of parsons, and thys is to be vsed, against theim onely, that be 
                        〈◊〉
                      men, and malefactours. And it is aswell the offyce of charitie, to rebuke, punyshe, and corrocte them, that be euyll, as it is to cheryshe, and rewarde them that be good, and innocent. Sainte Paule soo declareth, writing to the Romaynes, and sayenge, the 
                        〈◊〉
                      poweres are ordeyned of GOD, not to be dreadefull to

                  So that bothe offyces shoulde be dylygently executed, to impuge the kyngdome of the deuyll: the preacher wyth the woorde, and the Gouernoure wyth 
                        〈◊〉
                      swoorde. Els they loue neyther God, nor them whome they gouerne, yf for lacke of correction, they wylfully suffer God to be offended, and them whom they gouerne, to perishe. For as euery louyng father correcteth his natural sonne, when he dothe amysse, or els he loueth hym not: So all gouernoures of Realmes, Countreys, Townes, and houses, should louynglye correcte them, who be offendours vnder theyr gouernaunce.

And cheryshe them who doo lyue innocently: yf they haue any respecte, eyther vnto God, and theyr office or loue vnto them, of whome they haue gouernauce,
                  And suche rebukes, and punyshementes, of them that doo offende, must be done in due tymes, least by delaye, the offender fall headlinges into al maner of myschiefe, and not onelye bee euyll theim selues, but also doo hurte vnto many men, drawynge other by theyr euyll example, to synne, & outrage, after them. As one theef maye bothe robbe manye men, and also make many theues, and one sediciouse persō may allure many, and noye a hole towne or countre. And suche euyl persons, that be so great offenders of god, and the common wealth, charity requireth to be cut of, from the body of the common weale lest, they corrupte other good, and honest persons: like as a good surgeon cutteth awaye a putrified, and festred mem ber, for the loue he hath to yt hole body, least it infecte other members, adioynynge to it. Thus it is declared vuto you, what true charitie, or christan loue is, so playnely, that no man nede to be deceyued.
                  Whyche loue whosoeuer kepeth, bothe towardes God (whom he is bounde to loue aboue al thinges) and also towardes hys neyghbours, aswell frende as fooe, it shal surely kepe hym frō al offence of God, and iuste offence of man. Therefore beare welaway thys one shorte lesson, that by true christian charitye God ought to be loued, aboue all thynges, and all men oughte to be loued, good and euyll, frende, and foo, and to al suche we ought (as we may) doo good those that be good, of loue we ought to encorag, and

cherysh, because they be good: And those that be euil, of loue, we ought to procure vnto them theyr correction, and dewe punyshement, that they may therby, either be broght to goodnes, or at the lest, that god, and the common welthe maye be the lesse hurte, and offended, hating alwaies, the vyce, or offence, but louynge the person alwayes, as the creature of God, and as one who by nature is ioyned in kynred vnto vs. And yf we thus directe oure lyfe, by christian loue and Charytye, then Chryste doothe promyse, and assure vs, that he loueth vs, and that we be the Chyldren of our heauenlye father, and reconsiled to his fauor, being very members of Christ, and that after the shorte tyme, of thys presente and mortall lyfe, we shall haue with hym, eternall lyfe, in his euerlastyng kingdome of heauen: Ther fore to hym, wyth the father, and the holy Ghost, be al honor and glorye nowe & euer

                  Ur Saiyour Christ in ye. v. of Mathew, setteth forth an vniuersalMath, 5 doctrine, that is, a doctrine, apper teyning indifferently to all Chrysten mē and there he declareth, how great per fection of lyfe, ought to be in one of vs, sayinge in thys maner. Nisi abundauerit iustitia uestra plus quam Scribarum, & pharisaeo rum, nonimrabit is in regnum

That is to saye: Except your ryghtuousnes excede the ryghtuousnes of the Scribes, & the Pharyseis, ye cannot entre into the kyngedome of heauē, For the ryght vnderstandynge: of which wordes, it is to be noted, that rightuousnes in thys texte, doth signisye all kynde of vertue, and goodnes, and that by the Scribes, and Pharyseis, Chryste doth here meane, certayne companies, whiche were amonge the Iewes, and dyd lyue accordynge to the letter of Moyses lawe, so vpryghtly, in the face of the worldOecumevpon the fift of Ma

tuousnes, shoulde passe the Scribes and Phariseis, he meaneth, that we Chrsten folke shoulde not onely outwardely, seme good in the sight of the worlde, (as dyd the Scribes, & the Pharises,) but inwardlye also in our hartes, shoulde be lyke wyse good, in the syght of almyghtye God, whiche they were not. And because no faute is more greuouse, then the breache of Christen Loue, and Charitie, therefore immediately after the foresayde generall sentence, he instructeth vs, after all other thinges, in our durye, touchinge Charitie, sayinge: Dictum est antiquis, non occides, qui 
                           〈◊〉

                        . That is to saye.
                  It was sayde to them of olde tyme, Thou shalfe not sley whosoeuer dothe sley, shalbe in daunger of iudgemēt. But I saye vnto you that whosoeuer is angry wyth his brother, shalbe in daunger of iudgement. Behold, good Christē people, how perfit a charity Christ requireth in vs. For to vs he maketh the leaste breache of Charitie, as daungerous, as in olde tyme, was the greatest breache to the Iewes, The greateste breathe of Charitie, is murdre, and the 
                        〈◊〉
                      thereof amongest the Iewes, was iudgemente. The leaste breache of Charyty, is anger, and yet the punishmēt appoynted for it to vs Christians, by oure sauyoure hym selfe, is lyke wyse iudgement. Howe great dyfference of lyfe then, I pray you, must be betwene vs, nowe lyuynge vnder the newe lawe, and them that of olde tyme, lyued vnder the olde lawe, that is vnder

yt lawe of Moyses, when as, the selfe same payne that was then prescribed vnto them, for the hyghest degre of vncharitablenesse, is nowe dewe to vs, for the lowest degre thereof? How is it that mē flatter them selues, wyth the pleasaunte name of ChristianMath, 11 libertye, and thinke that, because Christ saieth in the xi of Mathew. Iug in meum suaue est, et onus meum leue. That is to saye. My yoke is swete, and my burden lyghte: that therefore suche streytnes of lyfe, and playnefull trauell is not requyred of vs, as was before tyme of the Iewes? True it is in dede, that Christen men are not at thys presente, bounde to be cyrcumcysed, or to offer vp vnto almyghtye GOD, calues, oxen, shepe, and Gotes, or to goo thryse a yeare to Ierusalem, or to forbeare swynes fleshe, or to kepe other lyke obseruations of Moyses lawe, but as touchynge the tenne commaundementes, and all mortall Preceptes contained in the old testament, we Christyans are bounde to the obseruation of them, & of all other thynges, belongyng to the estate of the new testamente, and so bounde, as that in perfourmance, and fulfyllyng of them, we muste be muche more perfyt, and more exacte, then euer was the Iewes in obeyng Moyses lawe. Nether is the yoke of Chryste called swete, nor hys burden lyghte, for anye ease or remission, that we maye take in oure condition, but for two other consyderacions, of whiche the one is, the aboūdaunce of grace, gyuen nowe in the tyme of the newe testamente, farre excedynge, the measure of grace gyuen to the Iewees, folowinge Moyses lawe: the other is, the

greatnes of rewarde, promysed to vs, aboue the Iewes, as wytnesseth amonge manye other auncientOecumē vpon the fifte of Mathew fathers, Oecumenius also, who wrytyng vpon the v. of Mathew, sayeth after this sorte. Quoniā infantia in

For asmuch as nowe infancy is passed into mans age, and grace is plenteouslie giuen to men and moost greatest rewardes are promised (for now nether possession of earth, & earthelye goodes, nor longe lyfe, nor fecundite of chyldren. nor victorye agaynst oure mortal enemyes, is promised, but the kingdome of heauē, adoptiō to God, and victory against deuels therefore of good reason, great fyghtes are required of vs. Thus saith Oecumenius cōcludyng that we christen men must more paynefully, and manfully, fyght agaynst our ghostly enemye, then did the Iewes, because we receaue more grace then they receued, and haue promise made to vs of greater rewardes, thē they had made to thē. For these two causes, we christen men must thynke the yoke of Chryst, swete, and his burden easye, be the thinges which are requyred of vs, neuer so hard to doo, as this is one, that we may not breake charitie, so muche as in the lowest degree that can be, that is in anger, whych woord, in the foresaid place

of Mathew, dothe sygnify a violation of breache of charitye, not vttered or shewed forthe by any sygne but onely conceyued secretly in the harte, and there lyenge hyd, from knowledge of man, but open, and manifest to the eye of almyghty God, who seith euē the inwarde thoughtes of the harte: this breache of charitye, thoughe it seme to many a smale faute, yet Chryste declareth it to be a greuouse faute, and maketh it in the payne, equall with murder, committed of old tyme by the Iewes. Nowe yf Chrysten men, hauinge conceiued anger in theyr hartes, do not by and by suppresse the same, but proceade to a fardar breache of charitie, that is, to vtter theyr anger by any sygne or token, than is this ther faut greter then the other, and the punyshemente due for the same, greater also, accordynge to the woordes of Chryste who in the. v. of Mathewe saieth.

Qui autem dixerit fratri suo fatue, reus erit gehennae ignis, that is to saye. He that calleth his brother fole, shalbe in daunger of hell fyre.

beholde Chrystian people, your lyfe in thys lesson, as in a glasse, and you shall see what daunger you stande in. Who is there almoost emongest vs, but yt vncharitably calleth hys neighbour fole, or som like euyl name? yea who is ther in maner that doth not far passe thys degree of vncharitablenes? And yet our sauiour nameth no mo degrees, partely, bicause the payne of thys thyrde degree beinge hell fyre, no greater payne coulde be named, for suche as should passe the same degre: partly, because the Chrystyan man should at the least be soo wary, & circumspecte, in kepyng brotherlye loue, and charitie, yt thoughe he dyd, perchaunce so farre forgette hymselfe, as to call hys brother foole vucharitably, yet fardar than so, he should not so much as thinke thoroughout hisCicero

But the onely thing that is there forbydden, is the breache of charitie, when one man meaneth ne good at all, to an other but for the onelye satisfyeng of his vncharitable harte, wyshed hym hurte in his harte, or vtteryng his secret vncharita ble mynde, doth thou hym, or tush at him, or finally speaketh contumelious wordes, expresly vnto hym callyng him fole, ideot or by other lyke opprobrious names, Wherefore to conclude, seinge you nowe know what parfytte loue and charitie, our sauiour Chryst doth requyre to be in vs, let al accustomed

tancour and malice from henceforth be vtterly banyshed from emongest vs, that we dwelling in cha ritie, may dwell in God, and haue here in this lyfe, GOD dwell in vs, and in the worlde to come, dwell in heauen wyth hym for euer, which graunt vnto vs, the blessed trinitie, the father, the sonne, and the holye Ghoste, to whome be all honor and glory worlde without ende.

                      An Homelie of the church, what it is, and of the commoditie thereof.
                  WHosoeuer (good people) wyll call to hys remembraūce, yt inestimable good nes of almyghtye God, and his inesti mable mercye, towards vs nothing deseruing the same yf there be any spot of heuenly grace in that person, he shall be ashamed of hys owne vnthankfulnes, and disobediens, and be compelled to fall downe in body & soule, before our Lorde, to aske pardon for his trāsgression. Of the which goodnes, and mercy of god, you haue a sufficiente, and moste euident declarati on, in these godly, and deuout homelies, that are set fourth to you, of the creation, & redemption, of man Neuerthelesse, for your further instruction, & gostlye comfort in this behalfe, I haue thought good to lett you vnderstand, an other hye benefytte, geuen to vs, by our sauioure, and redemer, Iesus Chryste, that we, hauyng perfyt knowledge of God, maye euermore prayse, and magnifye hym, accordynge to our moost bounden duetye. And this hye, and heauenly benefyte, is the holye catholyke churche, whi che our deare, and dreadefull Sauiour, both before

and after his paynefull deathe, dyd ordeyne, and ap poynt, to be for euer to vs, a moost louinge, & tender mother, a perpetual preseruation for our soule helth and a pyller of truth, in all our doutefull daungers Which churche, forsomuch as he hath bene latelye assaulted, by sundry sectes, and heresies, and so sore shaken, that manye (more is the pitie) had separate them selues from the same, and wylfully haue rune astray, beynge ledde, and caried with euerye waue and wynde of newe lerning, I purpose, by Godes grace, to open shortly to you, what this churche is, what maner of church it is, and what commoditie we haue by it.
                  Fyrst, the churche is a conuocation of all people throughout the whole worlde, professyng one faith of God, and one vse of all the holy sacraments, whi che churche, because it is purchased, and sanctified, by the death of oure Sauioure Iesus Christe, it is most derely beloued to God the father, and is called in holy Scripture, by most hie, and excellent na mes, as Corpus Christi, Sponsa Christi, Regnum celorum. &c. that is to say. The body misticall of Chryste, the spouse of Chryst, the kyngdome of heauen.Ephes. 4. For S. Paule, speakyng of Chryste, sayeth, That he hath appointed sundry officers, to maintaine the holy ones, into the worke of ministration, to the edifieng of the bodi of Christ. And kyng Salomon, taught by the holy ghost dyd forsee the dignitie, and beutye of his holye Churche and sayde in the name of GOD thereby.

Marke here (good people) that Saynt Austen in this place, doth write, agaynst an heretike beyng one of the donatyste secte, who denying the catholyke churche, dyd ascribe the fayth, of Chryst, and al

He sayde vnto him feede my shepe. Thys processe of Scripture, hath in it, many circumstaunces to be noted. The fyrst is, that (other Apostles beynge than present, and amongest them, euē he of whom Chryst did euē make very much of, that is to say, S. Iohn) yet our Sauiour Christ, dyd dyrecte his speach, and talke, but to Peter onelye, sygnifyenge the matter, wherof he dyd speake, to appertayne to Peter chieflye, and pryncipallye, and not in so speciall a sorte, to anye one of the apostles els. Another, and seconde circumstaunce to be here considered, is that oure sauioure, dyd aske Peter moost earnestly, whether he loued him, more than did the other apostles. And the thyrde cyrcumstaunce is, in that Chryste dyd commytte both hys lambes, and his shepe, vnto hym. These cyrcumstaunce (I saye) and other suche lyke, well considered, doo conuince, and clearelye proue, that the hyghe charge, ouere all the church militant, was especially committed to Peter.

For in dede without the wyl of God yt Romayne Byshoppe, coulde not at anye tyme haue commē to this monarchy, or supreme rule, and the wyll of God, by what meane soeuer it be knowen is to be receyued, or taken with reuerence, and therefore it is not lawefull folyshly, or hedelye to make resystence

vnto the said Romayne Bysshope, in his Bysshoppryke. And this reason is soogreat, or of suche force, that althoughe noo scrypture, nor no other cause were, yet thys were sufficient ynoughe to brydle, or kepe vnder the temeritie, or madnes, of them, yt make resistance. And by this reason alone, the most glorious Martyr Cyprian, in many Epystles doth most boldely glory or reioyse, agaynst all the aduersaries of anye of the Bysshoppes, accordyng as we do reade in the third boke of the kynges. Where allthough the. x. tribes of Israell, dyd departe from Roboam, the sonne of Salomon, yet bycause it was done by the wyll of God, it was without other authoritie firme, & stable. For also emongest all the deuines, the will of the signe, whiche they doo call the workyng of God, is to be feared no lesse, thē other signes of the will of God as precepts and thinges forbydden &c. And therefore I doo not se howe they be excused from the offence, or synne, of scy sine, who doing, or cō
                     minge agaynst this will, doo withdrawe, or pull them selues, from the Authoritie of the Romaine Bysshoppe.

                  An homilye declaringe that in the blessed Sacrament of the aultare, is the very bodye, and bloude of our Sauioure Chryst.
                  AFter that men are once graft in Christ and be made partakers of his death & passion, amonge other theyr duetyes, one of the cheife is, diligētly to prepare them selues to the worthy receauyng of yt blessed Sacrament of the aultare where vnto are two thynges on our partes requisitBasill in 
                           〈◊〉
                         rules. (as sayeth saynt Basell, & good reason confyrmeth) the one, feare, the other, faythe. The feare whyche men must haue, when they prepare them selues to come to this sacrament, ought to be grounded vpō that terrible saying of saynt Paule, in the. xi, chapter of hys fyrst Epystle to the Corinthians, wher heaCorin. II sayth that whosoeuer doth participate therof vnworthely, doth eate and drinke his owne dampnation: The faith, which we must haue in our hartes, when we come to Gods borde, is to be buylded lyke wyse, vpon the vndonted aucthorities of scripture, whych declare moost playnlye vnto vs what meate it is, that we there eate. For the parfit vnderstandyng wherof, let vs consider, that our sauyour

Chryst, beynge here on earth, did fyrste make a solempne promyse of a meate, whyche hym selfe woulde geue vnto vs, and afterwarde in dede, he dyd geue the same, accordynge to hys promyse. In the promyse makynge he sayde (as it is wrytten in the. vii, chapter of S, Jhons gospell. The breade

                        〈◊〉
                      meat, and my bloud is ve rely drincke. And as he then promised, so he after ward perfourmed, euen the very laste nyghte that euer he companied with his Apostles, before hys death, at which tyme, he toke breade into his handes, and gaue thankes, and breake it and gaue it to his disciples, and sayde. Take eate, this is my body, whiche shalbe geuen for you. Yf we cō pare the wordes spoken by Chryst, when he made the promyse of a meat, to be by hym geuen vnto vs, wt those other wordes, which he vttered in giuing of yt same, we nede not doubt of the thinges whiche he gaue. In the promyse makynge, he sayd, that he woulde geue vs his fleshe, in the perfourminge of the promyse, he geueth the same, saying, take eate this is my body. Agayne, in the promise making he affirmeth, that the fleshe, whith he woulde geue vs to fede on, should be the selfe same fleshe, yt shold be geuen for the lyfe of the world, and in the perfor maunce of his promise, he said, that the thing which

gaue, was his bodye, whyche shoulde be geuen to death for vs. Nowe the circumstaunces beyng wel considered, which our sauiour vsed in the institution of this most blessed Sacrament, shal greatly cō
                     fyrme al godly hartes, in the true be lefe of the same The tyme was the night before he suffered deathe, to signifye vnto vs, that thys meate, being differred to the last day, that euer our Sauiour was conuersaunt with his Apostles, must nedes be his very body, and bloude in dede, and such ameate as no other can be in any wyse comparable vnto it. Agayne, in that our sauyour dyd eate of the pascall lambe with his Apostles, immediatli before he did institute this sacrament, it most playnely declareth vnto vs, that this sacrament is a marueylous worthey mysterye and that veri thing, which the eating of the paschal lambe, in the olde lawe did prefygurate, for whyche cause, whē this was instituted that was abrogated Nether is it withoute a meruelouse consideration, that Chryst at that heauenly banket, would of purpose, nother haue the blessed Uyrgin Mary his mother, present with hym, nor anye other of his dyseyples, saue onely the. xii. Apostles, whome he appoin ted to be the head ministers of al his misteryes here on the earth, and specially to be the ministers of this most blessed sacrament, and the iustructours of al other, touching the same. Now what meneth it, that our Sauiour was not content to offer them this sa crament onely, but with the offeryng therof, he said also vnto them. Take eate, take and drinke? Do mē vse, to offer to other, meate and drynke, for anye 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                     
purpose, but onelye that they shoulde eate and drynke thereof, but bycause it was hys bodye, and hys bloude, therefore he fyrste byddeth them take, and not feare to eate and drynke the same.
                  Besydes this, it is to be well noted, that yt thre Euangelystes, Mathew, Marke, and Luke, did al three agree in the maner of the institution of thys sacramēt they wryting all three their gospels at sō dry tymes, as Mathe we eyght yere after the ascencion

And where in doubteful speaches of our sauiour Chryst, some one or other of yt Euangelists, euermore openeth playnly the very meaning of the speches, yet touchyng these words, this is my body, no one of them, maketh anye declaration vpon the same, but they all leue them to be takē of vs, as they sound, and (as of most plaine words) they make no exposition or interpretation of them at all. Whyche poynt must be well consydered, And therefore note th at where Chryst sayde. It is impossible for a rich man to entre into the kingdō of heuen. (bicause yt meaning of these wordes may be dyuerslyMark. 10 taken, thereof) S. Marke in his tenth chapyter declareth the very meaning of them, saying: It is harde for them that trust in there substaūce to be saued. Agayne Chryst at another time said to the Iewes, loose you this timple, & in thre daies shal I build it againe, Andfor that the sense of these wordes is doughtfull, S. Ihon there expoundeth them and sayeth, that Chryst by the tē

ment his body, which should be by the Iewes put to death, and by him the thirde daye shoulde be raysed from death to lyfe. In the, viii. of Ihon, oure sauiour sayeth: He that beleueth in me, as theIohn, 7. scriptnre sayeth, there shall, ryuers of quyck water flow out of him, And because this saing is obscure. S. Iohn to make it open, sayeth, that he spake those wordes, of the spirit, which they that be leued in him should receyue. In the. xii. chapiter of S, Ihon, our sauiour sayth in this maner. If I beIohn. 12. lyfte vp from the earth, I wyl draw al thin ges vnto my selfe. And S, Iohn by and by geueth vs the exposition, saying, that hereby he signyfyed, what kynde of death he should suffer. Manye other lyke places are there in the newe testamente the matter of which places, is not so hyghe, nor soo nedefull to be ryghtly vnderstanded, as yt meaning of these wordes, this is my body, and yet of these wordes, no one Euangelist maketh any exposition bycause the wordes are playnely, and symply to be taken as they were spokē. Besides al this, we haue in S. Paule in the, xi, Chapiter of his first Epistle, to the Corinthians, a goodly, and a large processe touching thys Sacrament, and yet in that whole processe, no matter to instructe vs otherwyse to be leue of it, than that there is in it the very body and bloude of our sauiour Chryst. For fyrste he vttereth the wordes of oursauiour, euen as the Euangelists do, as that he sayd this is my bodye. and he maketh no declaration vpon ye same. Secondly where

none of the Euangelists make mentiō, of any paine due to the vnworthy receauer. S Paule affirmeth that the vnworthy receyuyng of thys Sacramente bryngeth iudgement, and dampnation, Thirdly, he telleth, that for the vnworthy receauing hereof, God plageth cities, and cuntryes, wyth sondrye greuous plages, as with infirmitye, with syckenes, and with death also. Forthely, he geueth vs counsell dylygentlye to examine and trye our selfes, before we come to gods borde. If the very body and bloude of oure sauiour Chryst, be not in dede in the sacramēt of the aultare, why shold our sauiour so speake as he spake in the promisse made thereof? why dyd he, as he dyd in the instituting therof? why dyd none of the Euā
                     gelists so declare christes wordes? why dyd sayncte Paule so terribly pronounce of the vnworthy receauynge of it, and so ernestly warne vs, of due preparation to be made therefore? It is then most vndoutedlye to be of all chrysten people beleued, that in the Sacrameut of the aultare, there is the verye body and boulde, of our sauiour Chryst, worthy of all honour and glory, the selfe same in substannce, that is in heauen: which thyng for Chryst to bryng to passe, is a thyng most casye, he being God almighty, maker of heauen and earth: and for hym to do, is moost semely, that as he gaue that bodye, 'to deathe to redeme vs, so he should giue the same in thys heauenly bankitte, to fede vs, that he myght be all in all. The body of our sauiour Christ to be in very dede in heauen, in the visible fourme of a mā, and in the Sacrament of the Aultare, inuisible vnder the visible

And why then shold christen men refuse to beleue it? why do we not rather embrace it, and gyue God moste hartye thankes for it, being the greatest iewell, that euer was amonge mortal men, why do we not prepare our selues worthely to receaue it, and as in all other poyntes of the christen religion, so in the belefe of it, geue credite to fayth and bryng reason, and our senses, in subiectiō vnder fayth, but suffer our ghostly enemy by carnall reasons, to bryng vs away into heresie, & quite and cleane to pull the ryghte faythe out of oure hartes? Let vs all, good people, from hence forth be constaūt in the trueth, and as all the catholyke churche beleueth, and hath alwayes beleued, let vs vndoutedlye perswade our selues, that in the blessed sacrament of the Aultare, there is vnder the fourmes of breade & wine, the seife same body of our sauiour Christ in sub staūce, whych was borne of the Uyrgin Mary, and suffered death on ye crosse for vs, to whō wt the father & the holy gost, be all honor & glory, world wythout ende

And yet, because some haue vainely, and curiously, of late yeares talked of thys seconde part, and haue put many fonde doutes, and scruples into peoples heades, concernyng the same, ye shall nowe at large, and fully (I trust) be instructed therin, And fyrst thys is to be noted, that God hath

For thoughe in oure common speach we vse to signify by thys word, bread, that one kinde of materiall substaunce which is made of corne or grayne, yet in scrpture, it signifieth all kynde of fode, whether it be the fode of the body, or the foode of the soule, and so dothe also the latyne worde, Panis, elles when we desyre god in oure Pater noster, to geue vs our dayly bread, we shold make an vnperfytte petition, whiche yet is a moosteIohn, 6. perfyt petition, wherby we aske of our heauenly father, all necessary fode.

For such a kynd of faith, doth god requyre of vs, and for suche kynde of faythe, good christen people, are in scripture called Abrahās children: which Abraham (as it is writtē in the fourthRomo. 4. to the Romaynes) cōtrary to hope, beleued in hope, that he should be the father of many nations, accordyng to that, which was spokē. So shal thy sede be. And he fainted not in the faith, nor yet cō sidered his own bodi, which was now dead euen when he was almost an hundred yere olde: nether yet that Sara was past childe bearyng, he staggered not at the promyse of god, through vnbelefe, but was strōg in the

faith, & gaue honor to god, fully certified yt what he had promysed, the same he was able to make good. Yf we then wilbe the childrē of Abraham, we muste not faynt in faith, nor consyder gods wordes after the course of nature. Saint Paule in the. x. chapiter of his second epistle to the2 Corin. x Corinthians, geueth vs an example in hym selfe, howe we should alwayes brynge reason in subiection to fayth, saying. The wepons of our warfare are not carnall, but mighty in God, to ouerthrowe stronge holdes, to destroy counseles, and euery hyghe thynge that exalteth it selfe agaynste the knowledge of God, & to brynge in captiuitie vnto the seruyce of Chryste, all vnderstanding: What (think you) is the cause why the Iewes beleue not in Chryste? Uerelye fyrste, because he was borue of a Uyrgyn, which is contrary to the course of nature. Secondly lykewyse, he was in vnitie of person, God & man whych howe it maye be, no mans wit is able, by natural power, to conceaue, thyrdly, because he being God and man, suffered the deth of the crosse, which for God to be content to do, semeth to natural reason a thyng moost absurde, but good chrysten folke geuyng place to faith, do most vndoutedly beleue in Chryst, God & mā crucified, according to yt s. Paule writeth in his first Chapter of his fyrste Epistle to2 Corin. 1 the Corinthians saying. We preach Christe crucified, to the Iewes a stumblyng blhcke. to

the gentels, a folishnes, but to so many of yt ie wes & gētels as ar called, Christ the power & wysedome of God. And agreably here vnto, he sayeth also in the nexte Chapiter folowynge.
                  My talke, & my preachyng was not in yt per suasible wordes of mans wysedome, but in shewynge of power, and of the spyryte, that your faythe should not rest in the wisedome of man, but in the power of God. This general aduise and counsel of S. Paule, may and ought so to staye vs in the faythe of the catholyke churche, that nether carnall reasons, grounded vpon the feble intelligence of mans natural wyt, nether the de ceatfull iudgement of our senses, shoulde make vs once to doute, of any one trueth in Chrystes religiō, were it neuer so contrarye to the course of nature, neuer so farre aboue our capacities, and neuer so absurde to the appearaunce of our outwarde senses.
                  But forasmuch, as through the iniquitie of these later euyll yeares, diuers haue hadde sondrye fonde dowtes and scruples, put into theyr heades, especyally, agaynst the presence of Chrystes body & bloud, in the Sacrament of the aultare, and through such dowtes haue swarued from the true belefe therein, therefore here shall folowe aunsweres, and solutyons to such dowtes as haue ben most commen, that from hence for the no man shal nede to be seduced by

As oft as you eate of that breade, and drinke of that cup, you shall shew forthe the Lordes death vntil he come So then the remembraunce whych oure sauyoure there requirethe of vs, is the remembraunce of hys death, which is past, and not presente, and therefore after most proper maner of speache, may well be remembred. Now this remembraunce, can in no wise possibly be so lyuely, and so effectually worke in our hartes, as when we most certenly beleue, that in yt sacrament of the aultare, is verely, the selfe same bo dy in substaunce, which died for vs, and therefore yt Prophet Dauid, foreseyng in spirit, this so excellēt a memory, sayeth in his

Besydes thys, the body and bloude of our sauiour Christ (as it is in the sacramēt vnder the fourmes of breade and wine) may in that respecte also very weli be a remembraunce of it selfe as it honge on the crosse, in the vysyble fourme of a mortal man, and as it is nowe in heauen, in ye forme of an immortall man. Farthermore, when our sauiour sayd. Do this in the remembraūce of me, he ment they should do the whol ministratiō, which he then dyd in remembraunce of hym, which whole ministration, cannot be accordynglye, doone otherwyse, but that there must nedes be present the very body and bloude of our sauyoure Christe.

                  ¶ Another common obiection, there is gathered of the wordes of Christ. Mathew. xxvi. when he sayd: Poore men ye shal haue alwayes with you, but me shal ye not alwayes haue with you. Some haue vpon these wordes concluded, that the body and bloude of our sauiour Christ, cannot be in the sacrament of the aulter, for then (say they) Christ

Christ, and by yt the one Euāgelist sayeth, would sincerely iudge what the other ment, they should sone perceue this ther obiectiō to be of no force or strēgth at al, to proue, that they thereby goo about to proue. For sainct Marke iu his. xiiii. Chapiter, fyrst tellethMar. 14. the story of the woman, whych cam to Chryste, and brought with her an Alablaster boxe of moost precious oyntment, and poured ye ointmēnt on his head next he telleth how certene of the disciples did murmure, and grudge at that facte of the woman, and sayd: What meaneth this losse, and waste of oyntment? Might it not haue bene sold for more then three. C. pence & geuē to the pore? Thyrdely he telleth, howe oure sauioure beynge offended wyth the dysciples, for theyr murmurynge agaynst the woman, and how withall he allowing and commendynge her facte, dyd say iu this maner. Let her alone: Why are ye greuouse vnto her? she hath done a good dede: for alwayes shal you haue poore men amongest you and when ye shal please, you may bestowe your charitie on them, but me shal ye not haue alwayes amongest you.

                     . By this processe of S. Marke, it is euydent, that our sauiour in al that his talke, had a respecte to the charitie, whiche that womau then shewed vpon hym, when she poured the precious oyntmente

on hys heade, the lyke whereof, he sayethe, no man should be able to shew on him in tyme to come, meaning, that when he should once ryse from death to lyfe, and haue an immortall bodye, that then he woulde not looke to 
                        〈◊〉
                      the lyke at anye mannes handes, but that then men myght at their pleasure bestowe on the poore, who alwayes are in the worlde in the mortall estate, and maye by charity of good folke, be releued and comforted. In such sorte in dede, oure sauiour is not nowe amongest vs, but the beynge of his body and bloud in the Sacrament of the aulter is atter another sorte. For in the Sacrament he is, to fede vs with his body and bloude, and not vysyble to shewe him selfe vnto vs, as he thē did to his apostles, nor to haue ointment poured on hym, as he then had. ¶ Another obiection is there

In the. vi. to the Galathians, sainctGala. 6. Paule calleth mortall men, liuing then on the earth, spiritual. Wherefore spirituall, is not so to be taken alwayes, as to exclude corporall, but that thynge whatsoeuer it be, may be called spirituall, wherein is a worke wrought by god, aboue nature. For as god is a spirite so are his supernatural workes called spi rituall, and the thinges also, on, and in whome, such workes are wrought, are named spiritual thynges: and therefore. Manna, though it were of a bodelye substaunce, yet for that it came myraculously from aboue, by the onelye power of God, and not of nature, is, and may wel be called, a spiritual meate. And the dryncke whyche issued oute of the rocke, albeit it was in substaunce very water, yet for that God by hys omnypotency, made it sodenlye to issue out of a rocke, it is armed a spirytuall drynke.

                      other lyke supernaturall qualities, and for that cause, they shall after the resurrectyon, be spyrytuall bodyes. Nowe then

what necessity is there, that because the body of our 
                        〈◊〉
                      Chryst in the Sacrament of the Aultar, is a spirituall meate, therefore it shoulde not be also the corporall substaunce of his body; When the catholyke churche dothe saye, that the bodye of Chryste in the Sacramente is a spirytaull bodye, it meaneth, that it is there onelye thoroughe the almyghtye powere of God, and not by the power, or manoure of nature, Lykewyse, when the catholyke churche sayeth, that the bodye of Chryste is to be receyued there spirituallye, it meaneth not that therefore the verye body of Chryst is not there to be receaued really & in very dede. For this worde, spiritually, dothe signifye onely the maner of the receauyng, and dothe not importe the substaunce of the thyng so receyued.
                  Besides this, the catholyke churche, beleuynge that in the Sacrament of the aultare, is alwayes reallye the body and bloude of our sauiour Chryst, doth yet put a difference in the maner of receauynge thereof, and vseth to saye, that when good men receaue the sacramente, that they receaue the bodye and bloude of Chryst, both sacramentally, and spiritually to, but when euyll men receaue that, they receaue the body of Chryst sacramentally only, & not spiritually, because they come vnto it vnworthely, and therefore do they procure thereby, to theim selues dampnation. But nowe to open fardar the very meaning of those worses of Chryst. It is the spirit that ge ueth lyfe, the fleshe profiteth nothing, you shal vnderstande, that these wordes are taken of the catholyke church, in two most godly senses, the one is,

to meane by the spirite, the godhed, and by the fleshe the nature of man, as yf he had sayde, it is the godhed that causeth my fleshe to be able to gyue lyfe, ne ther is my fleshe the fleshe of a bare man, for then it beyng eaten coulde not profyte you, but my fleshe is vnited in vnitie of persone to the godhed, so that it is thereby able to brynge lyfe to the worthy eater therof.Cirill. Thus doeth Cyryil vpon the. vi. of Saynte John expounde these wordes, And to lyke purpose sainct Augustyne sayethe vppon the. vi of John, that asAugussin knowledge beyng seperated from charitie, maketh men proude, but beynge ioyned wyth charytye dothe edyfye: euen so mans fleshe not vnyted to the Godhed, and byng eaten dothe not profytte, but the fleshe of Christ, whych is in hym, in vnitie of person, inseperably vnited to the godhed, beyng worthelye receaued, muste nedes hyghly profyt. The other sēse of those wordes, to meane by the spirite, a spirituall vnderstandyng of Christes promyse, made in Caper naum when he sayde, the foode that I wyl giueIohn 6. vnto you is my fleshe: whych wordes be then vn derstanded spiritually, whē they be taken, to meane that thing which passeth the power of nature to doo and manes wyt by naturall reason to comprehende lykewyse by the fleshe, is to be ment, a fleshely vnder standynge of the sayde promysse, as to vnderstande wythout faythe in Christes deitie, as the Capernaites dyd, whyche toke Chryst but for a bare man, & so conceaued no otherwyse of the eatynge of his fleshe, then of commen meate bought in ye shambles.

                  Doo we not read, I pray you in the fourthe of Mathew, how that our sauyour suffered the deuyll, to take hym, and carye hym vp into the pynacle of the temple, & afterward to the toppe of an high mountayne, and yet who doth not know that he suffered no vilany therby at al?

that Christ in euery dede, by that saying was a dore or a vyne, or such lyke, but speakyng after that figuratyfe speache, or maner dyd meane that he was a fygure of a dore, of a

                      it) dyd saye. This is my body, And takyng the cuppe, & gaue thankes, did say, this is my bloud of the newe testament, &c, hys speache soo pronounced, and vttered, dyd not importe, that Chryst thereby doth make of the breade and wyne, hys body, and bloud but eyther he ment, that the breade and wyne was sygnes, and tokens of hys body, and bloude, or ells that they should be

                      of thys argumente, or obiection, and trouthe it is also that the speach of Chryst I am a dore, I am a vyne, &c. doth not importe that Chryste, by that speakynge was in very dede a dore, or a vyne, but that he was a fygure of a doore, and of a vyne, and had the

Thys is my bodye, this is my bloud, that is neyther true, nor doth folowe, either by the rules of reason, or of scrypture, for concernyng reson, either muste we reason, and saye, that Chryst alwayes in hys speakynge dyd vse fygures, metaphores, and tropes, (whych to saye, is moost false, as it appereth

And in very dede, if in the sacramēt of ye aulter were not ye true bodi of Christ, but a figure, & a significatiō onely of it, thā ye sacramēts of ye new testamēt shold haue nothing more but rather lesse, thē ye sacra mēts of ye old testamēt had, which is against ye catholyke doctrine of the churche, & against al good reasō ¶ An other obiection is this, Christ at hys last supper,Obientiō
                      takyng the chalice, or cup into hys handes, dyd after yt he had blessed it, saye. Thys cuppe is the newe testament, in my bloud. And seing these woordes must nedes, as they say be taken fyguratiuely, inasmuch as the very material cup it selfe, was neyther the newe testamente, ne yet the bloude of Christ, therefore lykewyse, these wordes also whych Christ, takīg bread into his hādes, blessīg it, saying. This is my body. must nedes be takē figuratiue ly.
                  ¶ For answer whervnto, we may say, as we didAnswere say before, to the same obiection, yt this argument is noughte, & very euyl framed, for though we dyd admit a figure to be herein ye cuppe, yet it foloweth not therby, yt we must nedes take ye other speche, touchīg ye body to be fyguratyue also, especially for yt in ye one spache, it is to wit, touchyng ye body, al the circūst ā
                     ces of the texte, & course of scripture, do enforce vs to take the speache, properlye wherein ye other speache touching the cup, al the circumstances of the texte, and course of scripture doth importe the contrarye.
                  
                     ¶ An other obiection is, that Chryste hath but oneObiectiō
                      true natural body: nowe (say they) one true natural body can not truely be but in one place, therefore say they, seyng Christes body, is truely in heauen, it can not be truely also in the sacrament of the aulter.
                  ¶ For aunswere whereunto maye be sayde, that inAnswere dede it is true, that Christ hathe but one true naturall body, and where they saye, that one true naturall body, can not be, but in one place, it is also true, after one, & the selfe same maner of beyng, but after diuerse maners of being, one body, maye be sondrye wher, yea, and at one tyme to, it is to wyt, in heauē, in the visible fourme, and maner of man, and in the sacrament of the aulter, vnder the forme and maner of breade and wyne, and in eueryche of them, really and truely to, in those respectes, God beyng therein the doer, who is omnipotent.
                  ¶ Ther is also another obiection, and that is thys,Obiectiō
                      GOD can make man, but man cannot make God: now say they, if the true bodye of Christe were, really, and in dede, in the sacrament of the aulter, then the priest which is a man, should therby make God, but mā cannot make God, therefore in the sacramēt of the aulter, ther is not the very true body of Christ ¶ For aunswere whervnto, is to be sayd, that thisAnswere obiectiō procedeth of a great ignoraunce, for he that maketh this obiection, taketh that the priest saying masse, and pronouncing the woordes of cōsecracion doeth make God, where in very dede, the priest goeth aboute no suche thinges, and yf he dyd, nether be, ne yet god himselfe c
                        •
                     n make God, but the truth

is that the preist being the minister of God, and god beyng ther the worker with hys worde, by the preist pronounced there, is caused the very body of Chryst to be ther present, wher it was not ther before, & yet no new body ther made, but that bodye ther presente which lōg ago was borne of the Uyrgyn Mary, the same (I say) in substaunce, is there present onely vnder the formes of breade and wyne.
                  ¶ An other obiection there is, and that is thys S.Obiectiō
                      Luke, in the. xvii. chapiter of the actes, doeth testifye that S. Paule, beyng at athens, and in mars strete, before the councell there, dyd saye, amongest other wordes, that God doeth not dwell in temples made with handes, where vpon the 
                        〈◊〉
                     , vnlernedly doth gather, that seyng the material temple is made with handes, and the sacrament of the aultar is in ye sayd materiall temple, it foloweth (say they) that the body and bloude of Chryste, can not be in it, because God doth not dwell in temples made with handes, And thys obiection hath bene soo muche iiked, and commended amongest the procedyng prechers abusing ye ignoraunt, yt they thought it ineuitable, & therfore abusyng the sayd people they caused it to be sette vp, and paynted for a gaye shew in the temples.
                  ¶ For aunswere whervnto, this is to be tolde you, yt ther is a great dyfference betwene beyng, & dwellyng

there. In dede, God is properlye sayde to dwell in heauen, because he ther doth shew, and manifest his great glorye, and in the hartcs of iust, and good peo ple, he is also sayd to dwell by grace, but as for other places, he is in them beyng, but not dwelling. And as concernyng the beyng of God in the sacrament of the aultare, forasinuch as there is the very substaunce of chrystes naturall, and true body, and bloude, taken of the Uyrgyn Mary, and that the di uinitie is, in vnitie of persō, inseperably vnited, and ioyned to the sayd bodye and bloude, therefore we must saye and beleue, that the godhed of Christ is in the sacramēt of the aultar, with his humanitie, in a very specyall sorte, and dothe not thereby dwell in the sayde sacramente, and soo this obiection is not worth a
