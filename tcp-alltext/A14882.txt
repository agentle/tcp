            To the Right worshipfull and his verie good friend M. Robart Beale Esquier, one of the Clarkes of her Maiesties most honorable priuie Counsell, Iohn Banister wisheth dayly encrease of all vertuous knowledge and happie health both here and euerlasting.

Then the reason is plaine, the cause iust, the purpose necessarie which hath mooued me to offer this my simple trauail vnto you, sith I haue often tryed your singular loue, and vnfained friendshippe. I hope you will accept this signe of my continuall remembrance, and seale of my thankful hart, not regarding the gift, but respecting my good will. Some peraduenture will thinke I seke praise of o

togeather, but most harde to picke and to cul out the most profitable thinges in them, I trust they will not detract frō my labour. This I professe, that my care in beginning, continuing, and ending t

My desire is to furnish & profit a surgeon with the knowledg of the body in mine anatomy and with manifolde and plaine practise in this book. Whether I haue attained the marke at which I aymed, or shot wide: I submit my selfe to the censure of the learned, and chiefly to your iudgement. For as you are well knowen to be skilfull in the varietie of tongues, and

endewed with all other good learning: so haue you soūded the depth of this art. The consideration whereof hath much more pricked me forward to present this booke vnto you. For as it was due vnto you in regard of friendship: so it was most meete for you in respect of your knowledge. Lucilius would not haue his writinges reade neyther of the most ignoraunt no of

            The Translator to the Reader.
            
               OF two thinges (as it seemeth to mee) the reader will require a reckoning at my handes: in both which like
                  •

vndergone such a burthen. Of this sort perfourming it, my reasons thus I render. And first for setting that downe, in a continued tenor of stile (but sorted into Chapters) which standeth in diuisions and tables in the Author, whence I haue it: The occasion was in the mouers of this transla

Thus when I had trauailed a space in the traslation, and founde that parte of Wecker committed vnto mee, defectiue in many points, pertaining hither

From whence, an equall minde may see, I haue aymed both at comelines and profit. And verily I iudge him of too mean capacitie, for this calling, that cannot, by the light of these things, proceede into further particulers, when neede requireth. For the cataractes and manuall administrations about the eyes, I referre the Reader to a treatise of olde Penemicus, inserted and lately

annexed thereunto. For I protest, there is nothing on the earth, hath carried mee into this course saue onely, a iust and honest care of the readers commoditie. As for that learned man Wecker, if I haue any where either

               rested his meaning, vnreuerently taken him, or censured him without cause, then is there wherfore, I should iustly be blamed for him. But if in all these things, I haue caried my selfe in a reasonable course, let not that be imputed to mee for a fault, which is (if I could deserue any) my commendation. Neither can any man greatly marueile, that so much vnsoundnesse shoulde be founde in Wecker, considering that (except in the preparation of medicines) he hath too much tyed him selfe to antiquitie. I found cause

ynough likewise, to haue dealt with his methode, but leauing that to the censure of D. Brights arte, (a worke of more learning & iudgement, than manie will confesse) I content my selfe, in this treatise, to haue looked on

               I Receiued no sooner the report that your booke was readie for the printer, but I perceiued some priuily repined. I hope you regard not their words, but continue your grounded purpose. You know that enuie lyeth always at vertues gate, and treadeth on her heeles when shee goeth abroad. For as the deafe cannot discern the sweetnesse of musick: so the ignoraunt cannot looke into the excellencie of knowledge. Maruail not if they say, there are ouer many books. For either they can not read, or at least vnderstand none. They neuer tasted Latin, and if some of them haue tipped their tongues with French, and sipped thereon as the dogges do on Nilus, then they blase abroad their skil with H

They are as kinde as the cuckowe, which deuoureth the birde that brought her vppe, and with the male spider (as Aristotle sayth) they eate the pray, but take no paines. You haue felt these gnawing at your booke of vlcers, and deuising to cut your anatomy as small as mootes. Of this sort I say little, because all others say much. For as they haue stricken all writers on the head, so they haue by them againe beene wounded to the heart. This fruite I am sure springeth frō their continuall carping. They weaken the painefull hande, they make dull the sharpe witt, they poyson the well affected, they sowe contention amongst the learned, they seduce the simple. They haue the tongue of the horsleech, the eye of the cockatrice

                the talents of the tyger. Not vnlike are they to Procustes the curst hoast, whose guestes were euer too long or too short for his beddes: so to these

men all writers seeme too new or too old, too short or too long, too plaine or too obscure, too simple or too curious. They are alway aguish, for euery thing is bitter to their tast. And deadly sicke of a desperate consumption, for the more they eate, the leaner they are. If you tarie these mens leasure and liking, your papers, will perhaps be eaten with rattes and mothes. Whereas you feare the censure and iudgment of the learned you do well, if thereby you be made warie in your woorke not weary of your enterprise. For they hauing seasoned their censure with equitie, and their iudgment with discretion, will passe ouer small faults with silence, and reproue greater slips with modestie It is not vnknowen to them, that the wisest mā hath his wants, and the soundest writer his errors. Then you are not to feare the ignoraunt, which cannot iudge of your labours, nor to regarde the enuious, which will not like your endeuour, neither to shrinke for

the godly & vertuous, which will accept your good wil. Behold all hinderāces are plucked vp by the roots: wherfore thē do you doubt wherfore do you quaile? what do you require? what do you seeke?

But when it cōmeth to the abscesse, the Tumor decreaseth, yeldeth out to a sharp point, & is soft, & easily pressed: the paine is pulslike beating, mixt with pricking & some itching.

                  Def.
                  OEdema is a certaine loose, vnpainfull tumor, proceeding of flegmatike humors, flowing into any part.Causes & signes. It is therefore apparant, that the antecedent and conioyned causes are flegme, the one yet flowing, the other flowed, & heaped now, togither in the mēber: both which also may haue procurement from outwarde causes: as falles from height: strokes, surfeting &c. which are easily vnderstood by the patients relation. The Tumor is loose & soft, easily yeelding to the pressing of the finger, and retaineth the pit after the finger is remoued. The paine is little or none, the heate small, the colour whitish or pale.
               
                  Prog.The termination of Oedema is most by resolution, seldome by suppuration: and often, by changing into nodes & other abscesses. Winter is the chiefe time of their raigne. And olde age is oftest troubled therewith.
               
                  Cure.First for the antecedent cause,Diet. set downe your dyet contrarie in qualitie:

to wit, heating, drying, and making thinne: As thinne and dry ayre, moderate exercise, and specially of the contrarie partes: short sleepe, and only on nightes: if the bellie keepe not soft naturally, order it by art thereunto: as by giuing figges fasting. stuffed with the pulpe of sem. carthami.

                   this alwaies prouided, that you work not so roundly, as to rush thorough the thicknes of the skinne, at once, with one incision, but by leisure: for nothing is violently to be performed in this busines. & in the lesser sort of thē, which are also of the gentler conditiō, a simple lined sectiō wil serue, but in the greater sort, the incision must be made after the figure of a Mirt leafe: & the veines & arteries

gently, and by little and little, bared, must be put aside. After this, dilate, and stretch wide open, with mullets, or little hookes, the lippes or borders of the deuided skinne, and either with your fingers, lancet scale, or spatule, seperate the membrans, vntill by little and little the lump being deliuered from all his holds, may be taken foorth. But if it be enwrapped with vessels, with great heede then is the businesse to be handled, lest by any negligence committed, great fluxe of bloud should followe. In such a case therefore, it is best to drawe open with your mullets but one of the sides, & so with your lancet, by little and little seuer the same from the partes tyed to it. And this once done on the one side, perfourm so much after on the other side. There being special care taken, le

As for the fluxe of bloud, that is not verie forcible, but in meane sort, such (I say) you may easily stay, by medicines of drying facultie: as stuphes, spunges, or battes of cotten dipt, and againe wrong out in cold water, or vineger, or

Meliceris is a Tumor in like sort voyde of payne, but rounde, and containing in a sinewie coate, a thinne humor representinge the substaunce of Honey.
               
                  Steatoma, is likewise a Tumor in colour nothinge differinge from other partes: softe in feeling, small in the beginninge, but much enlarging and increasing in processe of time: the humor it containeth is like sewet, and is also incloased in his proper membran.

Now if the bone be foule, then is the cure the same, as in the corruption of the bone, thorow the frenche disease. In both which if the corruption be but small in compasse, deale with it by incision and mundification, ex melleros. terebinthina, puluere ireos, myrrhae, thuris: according to that is handled hereafter in the fracture of the skull: consuming the putrified flesh (if there be any) with merc. praecipit, or other such,

The original therof is commonly from the crowne of the head, and mould:Causes & signes. where vnder the skinne, humors lightly resort out of the skull: which thence distilling downe by pericranium into the adherent membran, doe at length issue out into the eye. Other times they come from the interiour veines of the head. The humor is sometime cold and plainly waterish, causing no paine, burning nor rednesse. And sometime againe hote biting or salt, with paine, fretting, burning, and rednesse in the eye liddes: whereof followeth itching and scabbednesse.Pruritus Scabies.

                  Def.
                  POlypus is a tumor beyonde nature, growing in the nostrels, of substāce loose and fungous, like the flesh of the fish called Polypus.
               
               
                  Causes & signes.The cause thereof is a thicke and viscous humor. The signes: a loose & fungie swelling in the nostrels, greater in the change of the Moone, but lesser in the declination. Sometime it appeareth betweene the nostrels, but not much: Sometime it hangeth quite out of the nostrels. Other some times also it lyeth more backwardes: as in the hollowe way betweene the nostrels and the mouth.
               
                  If it be a cancrous,Prog. or inueterated Polypus, it is hardly or neuer cured.

The 4. is iudged lightest

and safest of al the rest, this toucheth not the iaws within, but the outward throate only, and his muscles: by the swelling of which, notwithstanding, it commeth to passe, that the inner muscles of larynx, are compressed, & so the passage of aire straightned. The cause of these sortes is, a sanguine or cholerike Fluxion, which flowing into these partes, by the braunches of the iugular veines, pertaining vnto them doe bring forth eyther Erysipelas or Phlegmon. The euident causes are sundrie, to wit, colde rather then hote, either aire, or drinking: strokes fishe bones, or pinnes, &c swallowed: drunkennesse & all excesse. For signs, these kindes haue (besides those that are common to euery Angina) tumor, Heate, and Feuer, the laste of whiche signes, is a continuall companion of euery true angina.

difficultie in swallowing, (so as the drinke sometime leapeth vp into the nose) and great payn about the iawes.

Ruptures happen in the sides of the hucke bones, neere the setting to of the bellie, after some stroke, fall, leaping &c. the swelling thereof in the beginning, is not great, but only in proces of time. the paine is pricking. Relaxations ar alwayes about the hole, through which, the vessels and muscles cremasteres, descend to the testicles: this tumor is without paine, but (in some persons) of great quantitie, vneuen, encreasing, and decreasing. Now Enterocele, and Epiplocele are to bee distinguished, by the signes proper to them both. For in Epiplocele the tumor is small, and oftener in the bone pubis, then in scroto. In whether place soeuer it bee, it is like a sauftishe bounche, slipperie and vneuen: remaining after one manner alwayes, as well after, as afore meate. Neither doeth it swell more by the straining of the breath, as the manner of Enterocele is: neither doth it returne backwarkes. In Enterocele, the Tumor is sauft, and soudenly rising, encreaseth by strayning of the voice, or repletiō

                  HYdrocele,
                  Def. is when water descendeth into scrotum, or is therein gathered.
               The immediate causes are watrish humors,Causes & signes. contained either in all scrotū, or in the membran erythrois
                  
                     •
                   or dartum: either of which, you shall thus descrie from other: for if it bee in those membrans, then the tumor is rounde & with tension in the testicle only, scrotum being free & wrinkled, after his natural maner. Contrariwise when the matter possesseth all scrotū, the tumor is (the part being set betwixt you & the light) through shining, vnpainfull, firme, stable, & scrotum without wrinkles. It may come also of I cannot hereunto consent: that the resort of bloud should cause Hydrocele. All men knowe, rather, an inflamation & mortification: But here Wecker was borne downe in the streame of AEgineta. bloud, but then some stroke or fall hath bin the occasion: & then the tumor is ruddie, or blackish. Mediate or mean causes, conducing therunto, may be imbecilitie throgh cold distemperature, either of the liuer, or els of the vessels I vvould rather read contained vvithin scrotum. enwraping scrotū, by occasiō wherof, the bloud that cō
                  meth thither for nourishment, is chā
                  ged into a watrish or whaish & vnprofitable susbtāce. The tokens of a cold distēperature doeth bewray this case.

Further,*Amend this as before. you shall trye out, whether the partes enwrapping scrotum, be affected first, and by themselues, or else by consent of some other parte, after this sort. If there be any consent, as of the Liuer, or Splene, examine the state of those partes, by the proper signes and notes of the liuers affects, and of the dropsey: and if you finde faultinesse in those parts, then is there consent: but if those partes be sound, and there no signes of dropsey, the tumor also vnpainfull, firme and abyding, you easilie see where all the fault must be layde.
               To goe about this cure:Cure. foresee first, whether the part be affected by it selfe, or by consent of some other: as by colde distemperature of the liuer and Splene, which if you doe suspect, set an order, both by heatinge diet, and medicines, that may resist the same: diligently spending out the watrie matter, contained in peritoneū, by often purgations. In vaine else shall you go about to lay locall medicines to waste away the water in scrotum, when the same shall bee still supplyed out of the abundance in peritonaeum.
                  
Those things therfore thus prouided for: prooue if you may by medicines discusse the watrie humor in scrotum, as by this fomentation: Rec. lixiuij, li.iij.

Also yet foment the partes without vntil the vij. daye: for feare of inflamation: and apply aloft some plaister, to keepe in the tents.

                  Causes & signes.The immediate, winde: and that either in the foure nourishing vessels of the testicles, (the tumor then appearing harde and not vanishing by the pressing of the finger) or els in the arteries running betwixt the tunicles of Here stil you must vnderstād, according as is noted

                  dartos: in which case the tumor giueth backe, and vanisheth being pressed with the finger. Nowe, if the partes be affected first, & by them selues, then shall you see no signes of dropsie or timpanie, nor of any affect of the liuer, or stomacke, then by the proper signes of the affectes of those partes, as also by the notes of those named diseases, you shal descrie it. In briefe, the generall signes of windie rupture, are these: The

               If the affect be in the iiij. vessels, nourishing the testicle,Prog. it is curable, but in the arteries of dartos, vncurable. In new borne children also it oft happeneth, and is easily discussed.
               If it come by consent of the liuer, or stomack, it is to be dealt withal, as in the timpanie. So the dropsie is first to be cured,Cure. if this be occasioned ther by.

                  ut if the part first, and by it self haue receiued the affect, and be faultie alone, then is it thus to be dealt with.

                  Resolution of the glandulous inflamations.
                  
                     BVbo in his proper signification, is that inflamation that lighteth in the flanke: the tumor then bearinge the name of the parte, according to the Greeke originall. Notwithstanding late writers, takinge it some time in a larger signification, do vnderstande thereby anye of the late mentioned glandulous inflamations.

The same contagious humor (therefore) is to bee emptied partly by bloudletting, (if nothing hinder) and partly by purging medicins, instituted according to the nature of the bodie, and humors, &c.
               Finally, (to prosecute the cure by maturation, as is a little aboue saide) when it is ripe fully, and also opened, (either of it self, or by instrument, as neede requireth) it is to bee dealt withall, with clensing medicines, first of gentler sort, then stronger, after with incarnatiues, and so to cicatrization, as hath bene oft before remembred.

               The antecedent cause is bloud inflowing,Causes & signes. which you may descrie by the notes of abundance of bloud,

the conioined cause is the bloud contained in the part affected, &c. This tumor is about the rootes of the nayles, the paine is vehement, with pulsation, heate, &c.
               This tumor sometimes is founde with grieuous symptomes, as paine, so great, that it purchaseth a feuer, alienation of the mind, and sounding, and so endes by death sometimes. Againe, it vlcerateth, and bringeth an eating and corrupting both of the flesh, and bone, and so consequently a Gangraene, or Sphacele, and perdition of the whole finger, &c. The bloude inflowing (which is saide to bee the antecedent cause) is first to be driuen out,Cure. and that either from the region or seate, whence it floweth, whether it bee from the whole bodie, or a part, (as by bloudletting and dyet, as is sayde in Phlegmon) or else from the parte whether it doeth flowe

Myrmecia hath a broder root, and slenderer toppe then Thymon. It is lower, harder, fuller of paine, and lesse subiect to bleedinge then Thymon, and scarse, at anye time, exceeding the greatnesse of a Lupine. Acrochordon is slenderer in the bottome, broader in the toppe, alwayes standing out from the skinne, seeldome growing greater then a beane, moste commonly incident to children: sometime turning to matter, otherwhiles, suddenly going awaye: and nowe and then mouing in some measure an inflammation.

They growe commonly to the greatnesse of the AEgyptian beane,Prog. and are sometimes one, sometimes moe in number. Myrmecia goeth not awaye without curation. It is burned with medicines: it sticketh in with broade rootes, so that it cannot be cut out, without a great vlceration.

The

fewe fleshie parts and muscles, yet towarde the skinne remayning, were daily still in consuming (which wee might iudge by the aboundaunce of muscles, and fragmentes, some loose and swimming in the bloud, some separated, others halfe consumed, yet hanging by one end) so, as it seemeth the naturall ende would haue beene, by soudaine efusion of all this bloud and spirits, when (at last) the skin and fleshie parts had all beene worne and washed through. Thus muche I thought not in vaine in this place to be registred, (if there were no other vse of it) euen for the rarenesse of the obseruation.

               THE differences of woundes, are taken either frō their causes, by which they are inflicted: or frō their accidentes to wit, the place wherein they are situated
                  •
                the causes are either bodies with out life, or else liuing things. Things without life that wounde a man, doe it either by cutting, or brusing: if it be by cutting, wee call it simplye a wounde: if it be brusingwise doone, we call it a contused wounde, or Ecchymosis. Againe it may be of a liuing bodie as a wounde that is of biting. Nowe the place giueth difference in this sorte: some woundes chaunce in the similar, some in the

organicall partes. Of the similar, also, some are sanguin, some spermaticke, so the woundes in the sanguine parts, as in the flesh, are either, simple, deep, hollowe, plaine, or proude with flesh. The spermaticke partes, likewise are either harde or sauft: the sauft partes be, the sinewe, which being hurt, we call it a wounde in the sinewe: the veine, whose hurt we call a wound in the veine: the arterie, whose wounde wee call by the like name: the harde spermaticke partes
                  •
                are the bones, a wound in the which, we call a wound of the bones. Woundes of the organicall or instrumentall partes, are either of some whole bulke or trunk, or some more particular member or limme. Woundes of the trunkes are meant those of the heade, necke, brest and bellie, in the heade againe, there growe more particular names and differences, by reason of the parte

               A Wound is a breach of continuitie,Def. new, and bloudie, with out either matter or putrefaction.
               Causes are,Causes either sworde, or such weapons, as may be sent from farre to doe the hurt: of which kinde, there be diuers fashions, some long and slender, as arrowes, both with plaine and bearded heades: others broade, some againe rounde, as bullettes of leade, or y

               Signes of the wounde,signes. as also whether it be in a similar or instrumental part, ar easily discerned by common sense. The signes yet of the instrument that causeth the wounde, are not alwaies so manifest. For although (as is saide before) some are stricken at hande, as with the sworde, or such other weapon, yet we knowe also, that some hurts are sent further off, which being done by things of small compasse,

as a pellet or bullet, may be out of sight, lying hidden in the fleshe. The place thereof if you shall handle, you shall finde eminent, rough and vneuen. The diuision doeth not tende directly forwarde, but sheweth greater, and wider. The fleshe sheweth blackish, brused, and there is paine with certaine heauinesse. The woundes that are empoysoned you shall perceiue, in that the fleshe will shewe pale, of a bloe colour, and be deaddish, &c.

                   accidentes concurring. The cause, to wit, the outward thinges wherewith the wounde was inflicted, must (if they sticke yet in the same) by all meanes, be sought to be remooued. Which purpose to atchiue, you haue two notable waies to worke, that is to wit, by instruments, and by medicines: by instruments, in this sort: if it be a long and slender dart, cōsider, whether the head of it be euen and smooth, or else vneuen and bearded, if it be euen, it is to bee drawne foorth, either on the contrarie side, or the same waye it went in. You are to chuse the contrarie side, if so bee there bee

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   nowe when the dart head apeareth, & sheweth it selfe, into the place of your incision, if the steale or shaft be yet in the heade, it will helpe you the better, to thrust it thorough, to the other side, that so, you may there drawe it foorth. But if only the heade sticke within, then must you make shift, either with your fingers, or some conuenient instrument to take holde of it, and so drawe it forth. If you see it more conuenient, to draw it backe againe, the way that it went in, that must you also attempt by the like reason: to wit, the wound being enlarged, drawe it out by the steale, if it haue any, if it haue none, drawe foorth the yron either with the opening cane, or the crowe bill, or the darte drawer, or other like deuised instrument for the purpose: enlarging sufficiently the wounde, if otherwise, it bee to narrowe fo

the instrument. Nowe if the heade be spiked or bearded, if the beardes be small, breake them off first, and then drawe out the dart: but if the beardes bee large, conuaye quilles in that order betwixt them and the flesh, that the flesh may not be torne in their going out: but if the heade be bearded both forwards and backwardes, so that it can come out neyther waye, then must you needes open the place with a newe incision (without you knowe of a veine or such other vessell of daunger, in that place, that forbiddeth it) and so sufficient roome beeing p
                     •
                  ocured, take foorth the heade gently and without plucking. Some doe likewise bridle those beardes, with quilles, or peeces of reedes, that they may not teare, and so plucke them out that way that seemeth readiest. Broade dartes or speare heads being hiddē in the flesh, it is not expedient to thrust them out on thother side, for feare of making one great wound vpon another, they are therefore to bee pulled out with Diocles darte drawer. An instrument deuised by Diocles, and called of the

Greeks Eraphiscum. If a bullet of lead or yron, be lodged in the wound, first place the parties bodie in the same gesture (if it may be) in which it was when it receiued the wounde: and so search with a probe, which way the pellet is gone, (this obserue in the drawing out of all artillerie) if the case be such as the patient may not haue his bodie placed in that order, yet at least, so place him, lyinge, that, as muche as may be, he may come neere to the fashion. This doone, enlarge the wounde, and take out the pellet by the waye that it entred, with some hooke, probe, crowebill, or scissourlike mullet, or suche other, as the wounde is easliest able to receiue for that operation. If so be, the shotte bee in such sort hidden, as that it may in no wise be founde, or else may not safely ynough be drawen foorth, then is it to be let alone, till nature eyther thrust it foorth, or manifest it. And it hath beene seene sometime, that without offence of nature, a bullet hath tarried within, for a certaine space, after the

wounde was cloosed vppe and healed. And agayne, after a certaine space, to come foorth by waye of apostemation: after which the wound hath beene perfectly healed, the same cure being vsed thereto, as to other woundes. To speake generally of al sorts of engines inflicting wounds, if they sticke in but superficially, and haue not persed or broken anye great veines, then are they to bee drawen out, the same waye they went in. As also it falleth out sometime, euen in those that lye deepe: to wit, when manifest daunger, eyther through losse of bloud, or consent of some principall partes, is forespyed likelie to fall out, through the opening of the contrarie side. In such a case therefore, wee eyther drawe it foorth with our fingers, or by the steale of the shaft, or dart, (if it haue anye) or otherwise, by conuaying a steale into the hollowe of the yron, and so winde it foorth. But there is another case, wherein if it lye deepe, it is not to bee plucked out the same waye, but,

but, on the contrarie side, as when the way is longer for it to come backe againe then to be thrust through outright, and hath alreadie in going in, pearsed through veines and synewes: briefly, when but a little whole flesh remayneth to be pearsed through, & that nothing letteth, whereby incision might not be fitly made, on the other side against the point of it, in such a case, it is better to open that that remaineth, and thrust out the dart, on the other side. for so, it is both neerer hande to finde, and safelier taken out, as also in a great member, if the point haue once passed the midst of it, it healeth easilyer, if the way be made quit thorough, because it may receiue the helpe of medicines on bo

                  eth. Further note, that if it haue a sharpe point (which you shall finde by searching with your probe) then

you must vse the female propulsorie instrument, but if it haue a hollowe or socket, the male propulsorie: and so by such meanes, thrust it on forwarde, till you may easily take holde of it to plucke it forth. Alwayes hauing notable regard, that you deuide not a nerue or a tendon, either some great veine or arterie. As for those that sticke in the bone, it is not safe to plucke them out otherwise, then backe againe: shaking or moouing the darte, till the place bee loosed, wherein it was holden, and then with the hande, or instrument, drawe it foorth: which manner of dealing likewise is vsed in plucking foorth of teeth, and verie seeldome doeth the dart, not followe, if it be so vsed: but if it doe chaunce to staie, it may bee stricken out with some instrument. Some binde the bowe called Balista, to some of the mullet like instrumentes or pinsers, and so, the patient sitting fast in his place, by drawing and loosing againe the string of the same instrument, drawe foorth the darte: but if the darte sticke

But if the solution be great, it must be helped, by artificiall closing togeather the gaping sides and borders of the wound, to wit, either by seame

Moreouer, see that your needle be long, smooth, and threesquare pointed, with a guttered eye, that the threede, close couching therin, may giue no occasion of stickinge in the passing through of the needle. Besides, you must haue a stitchinge

quill, whereupon the lippe of the wound may leane, and stay it self stedily without slipping hither & thither whilest the needle is pearsing it thorough, and so, that through the little window or loope hole of it, you may spye when the needle hath pearsed through, that then you may drawe it on ende, with the threede. All the while that the threede is drawinge through, vnderprop the lippe of the wound, with your probe, that it tugg not outward in following the same. Let it be tyed first with ij. inuolutiōs or bowtes, the second time with one only, & so cut of the threed, somwhat distant from the knott. Thus when the partes are drawen togither by stitching, vse glutinatiue medicines, which may both consume and dry vp, the corruption of humors gathered, as also prohibite lest any more come thither. The second way of ioyninge is by claspes,Claspes, or tack

it towardes the other lippe, fastening therein the other hooke, as they vse to doe, that dresse clothes vppon the Tenters. These claspes whereby wee drawe togither the borders of gaping woundes, require no force or strayning, but onely are so farre profitable, as the skinne seemeth willinge, of it owne accorde, to followe that which leadeth or draweth it.

But if wee couet to haue the stitching holde a long time, take a writinge quill, in steede of the stupes, and doe as followeth. Drawe a stitche through both sydes of the wounde, and returne your needle through agayne by the same waye it came, so that you leaue youre threede in a loope, on that syde, whence the needle returned, in which loope, put one of the quilles, then take both the endes of your threede, to wit, both the beginning,

and that that came backe againe, and straine or vrge them so, as the sydes of the wounde maye drawe togitherwarde, and putting between them the other quill, tye them on a knott, and cut away the remnant of threede, so leaue it to the perfect healinge of the wounde. The fourth stitchinge,The drie stitch. is perfourmed by clothes, applyed on both sydes the wound, in fourme triangled, and of such greatnesse, as seemeth best agreable to the member that is hurt. Which kinde of stitche is most agreeable to such places, as we couet to heale, most without blemish or skarre as in the face. Those clothes must bee fastened on with some viscous or harde clea

And then spread vpon one side of your clothes, which clothes then must you laye on eche syde the wound, a thumb bredth distant from the same. Thus when that oyntment drying, the clothes become fastened in their place, make in them your

stitching, ingeniously to the purpose. by which meanes, the lippes of the wounde shall goe togither and glewe againe.
               Now when you haue wrought for the drawing togither of the wounde, you must after also carefully see to it, to preserue so, and keepe togither the partes that you haue ioyned: which is also done commonly by the continuance of the same meanes. That is to wit, decent bynding, apt placinge of the member, and stitching, if it shalbe thought necessarie.
               The thirde scope,The 3. intention in the cure. nowe is, to preserue the substance of the wounded part and prohibite, lest it come to be troubled with paine, inflamation, or other vntowarde accident. Inflamation is restrained by taking away the cause of his fluxion. And humors flowe to a place, either in that they are sent, or in that they are drawen. They are drawen first through paine, and then through heate of the member. But when they are sent, it is, as it were into a weake parte, as when the whole bodie is abundant with good or euill iuyce. Therefore to hinder

and take away the cause of the fluxion. three thinges are to bee attended vnto: the first is paine, which must be In this place, handling that scope of the cure, that respecteth the part affected, the Author was onely

cause, the humor alreadie contayned in the wounded parte, to the cutting off of both these we must labour with all our might: first for the defluxion, it is to be considered, whether it be of bloud, or other humors, if it bee bloude, it is to be euacuated, either from the point whence it floweth, or else from the place whether it floweth. The rage of the fluxion, cōming eyther from the whole bodye or part thereof, is to be bridled by bloudletting
                     •
                   or thinne cooling dyet. From the part whether it goeth, there are two wayes to dispatch it: one is by reuulsion, in withdrawing the humor to a contrarie part, either with phlebotomie, cupping, frication, or ligatures on the contrarie side: the other way is by repercussiues, when the matter is not drawen but sent, as with ol. rosaceum, ol. mirtinum, or an vnguent ex bolo armeno, cleo & aceto, wherewith the circūstant parts about the wound are to be annoynted, else a plaster ex puluere mirtillorum & oui candido. If the defluxion come not of bloud, but of other humors, then must it be taken away with purging medicines according

to the nature of those humors. which point is now set downe before in the curation of tumors beyond nature.

               VVHether the creature that inflicted the wound,Causes & signes. was venimous, as a madde dogge, a serpent, scorpion, basiliske, dragon, viper, shrew, spider, &c. or else not venimous: such as a domesticall dogge, ape, man, horse, sowe, catte, waspe

sometime slacketh, sometime renueth, now heate, now colde, &c. If the biting be not venimous, the accidents are lesser.
               A venimous byting is most perillous,Prog. especially if it be of cōtinuance, because poyson doth alway, naturally seeke the destruction of the heart, whence it is, that if the patient bee hydrophobus, (that is, though thirstie, yet fearefull of all water,) hee is incurable.

Manuall operation is perfourmed by cupping, sucking with the mouth, cauterie or cutting. The cupping must be done with much flame, and applyed to the verie wounde, the partes round about being first scarified, whereby the more vitious bloud may be drawen out. Mouthsucking is thought conuenient, if the disease, be but light: or in steede of it, the tayle of a henne applyed to the wounde. A ca

For the parte that first, and by it selfe is affected, it is sometime expedient to cutte off, chieflie when it is such one, as may not vnfitly admitte such handling, as the extreeme partes: as also when the wounde is knowen to haue such a conditioned venome, as bringeth vnauoydable daunger, such as are all

As for the first, if the Orifice of the wounde looke downwarde, and the bottome bee vpwarde, so, as the matter maye freely, and pronewise flowe out of the wounde, such a one is to be ioyned both by an orderly ligature, such as may beginne aboue, and ende belowe, where the orifice is, as also by stitching and glutinatiue medicines, such as afore are set downe in the cure of a simple wounde in the flesh. But if contrariewise the orifice bee vpwarde, and the bottome of the wounde tending to the lower partes, so as there is therein a restinge place for the matter: then here is vse for the seconde indication, which noteth

               CHAP. VII. Of a hollowe wounde, with losse of substance in both the skinnes, and in the subiect flesh.
               THE causes and signes hereof, being easily apprehended, as also the accidents manifest, wee will passe on to the cure, after the consideration of two notes that concerne iudgement in it. The outwarde comming causes,Prog. beeinge not remoued, doe hinder generation of fleshe and also healinge. Also accidentes comming vppon the wound and not remoued first, doe prohibite the curation.
               Let the firste intention therefore,Cure. in this case, bee, to remooue outwarde things incident to the wound, as dartes, or other thinges inflicted, hayrs, filth, &c. with instrumēts conueniēt. Then next to cure the wound it self, which being hollow, requireth

a filling with flesh, and that in regard of the qualitie of the wounde, and of the excrement: which in the generation of the flesh it engendreth
                     •
                   which excrement being of two sorts, a thicker called sordes, and a thinner called sanies, (the last making the wound to moyst, the other filthie) must be met withall, with medicines of a double qualitie, to wit, meanly drying and wyping, called commonly incarnatiues, of which sort are these simples: thuris lachryma, thus, cortex thuris, mastix, aloes, v

                  sease: so must you likewise further obserue, to intende or weaken the force of your medicine, accordinge to the state, both of the wounde and temperament, both of the whole bodie and wounded part, as thus: The naturall temperature, both of the whole bodie, and of the wounded part, must be conserued & kept, by things agreeable, or like vnto it
                     •
                   but that distemperature which falleth in, contrarie to nature, must

                     •
                   for it perisheth whatsoeuer is drawen into a contrarie plight, and by a contrarie thinge. Accordinglye therefore, a wounde, the moyster it is, the dryer medicine doeth it neede. But withall, the nature of the bodie, by how much the moyster, by so much the lesse drying medicine is required of it. Wherefore if there be wounds in diuers bodies, in which woundes, there is a like humiditie: that wound that is in a dryer temperature of bodie, needeth more drying, and that in the moyster, so much lesse, as there is difference betwixt those two natures: if so bee you meane to make the newe flesh aunswerable to the olde. Likewise
                     •
                   on the other syde, where the olde is dryer, it is conuenient, that the newe bee dryer also. And so this must haue drying medicines more plentiful, yea & by howe much more it is the dryer, by so much the more drying facultie must your medicine haue. And contrariwise, in a moister nature, so much the lesse of drying medicines need you, as the flesh in that partie, is lesse of

nature, drie. The same reason standeth whole, to be obserued in his diet also. Accidents, whether they be present, or you feare them: are to be either prohibited, either els remoued, as hath bene said in other places.

               THE signes of an equal, plain or filled wounde, are manifest, so as I neede not stande vpon thē. I wil therfore come

to the cure, after I haue layde downe this note, that may direct you, in the deliuerie of your iudgement concerning this case.Prog. it is this. The matter of the skin considered, which taketh it beginning frō the seede, it is euiden

                  Cure.In the cure hereof, are two generall scopes or intentions to bee had: The one respecting the wound it self: the other the accidents. The wounde therefore, being nowe plaine and equall, must bee cicatrized and couered with skinne. This is to bee perfourmed, by medicines, which doe consume not onely superfluous, but euen the naturall moysture also, and they bee such as haue some measure of astringent facultie, but verie much drying. of which sort here followeth both simples and compoundes.

                   is communicated to those that bee not cutte, and so againe the fibres that bee vncutte, stirre vppe a conuulsion. But if all the nerue be cutte a sunder, there is no further feare,

neither doeth any other daunger ensue, saue weakenesse of that part. If such a ligament be hurt as goeth frō bone to bone, to ioyne them togeather, it is most without daunger: and with whatsoeuer medicines you drie the same you shall not offend the partie. But if it be such a one, as inserteth it selfe into a muscle, looke how much it bringeth lesse daunger, then if it were a synewe or tendon, by so much the more (vnlesse it be rightly and diligently cured) is it more perillous then the other sorte of ligamentes. If in a wounde of the synewes a tumor appeare, and afterwardes vanish, it threatneth the perill of conuulsion or rauing.
               
                  Cure.First (as I haue oft admonished) prouide, that no outwarde thing remaine in the wounde.

And the deriuing of the course of it other-whither is done by opening a veine in some part neere vnto the wounde. The second meanes to worke withall, is to bridle and intercept the furious course of it, by things that may thicken, astonish, or coole. These thicken the bloud, to wit, len

               CHAP. XV. Of woundes in the face.
               
                  THE cure of woundes in the face is to be perfourmed according to two generall indications thereto belonging, to wit, the symptomes, & the wounde it selfe. The symptomes considered, as they are, either imminent, or present: if they bee but imminent, and in daunger to come, preuent them (as an inflammation) by bloud letting, such as doeth either drawe to the contrarie part, or deriue or emptie the humors, if nothing let: else by cupping with scarification vppon the vertebres of the necke. Also by diet, fit and conuenient: as spare quantitie, taking rest, keeping the bodie solluble, drinking sodden water, &c. auoyding colde aire, ouermuch mouing, plenteous meat, drinking of pure wine, binding of the belly, &c. The bodie also would be lightly purged with such medicines as be answerable to the nature of the abounding humors. If the accidentes haue nowe founde place alreadie, displace them: as, payne, by mitigatinge, bloudie fluxe by stayinge: inflammation by putting it awaye, as is often taught afore, &c.
               
                  The second generall indication is the wound it selfe, which requireth to be vnited: but in this doing
                     •

Somtime also when the first stitching proues not fast ynough, nor reteynes the lips sufficient close togither, but becommeth slack, then the later kind of stitching is to bee added to it. In places ordayned to moue, the stitching may be made by needles prickt through the lippes of the wounds, and left remayning with their threede wonne about both endes. No tent in this case is to bee vsed, except the wounde be verie deepe, or that there be losse of substaunce. as for medicines the same shall serue in this case as in other woundes.

               CHAP. XVIII. Of woundes in the nose.
               
                  IF the nose be wholly cut of,Prog. it cannot be ioyned togither any more: for vnition in the organical partes, is not possible. And if it be not wholy cut of, it mai be cured by stitching. In curing,Cure. first set an order for the accidentes after the same rate as is before spoken of in wounds of the eies. The second care is to looke to the vniting of the wounde, by conuenient stitching with a crooked needle, if it cannot be done with a straight: but see that the stitchinge bee deepe ynough. And before you take anye stitch: first see, by conueying your fingers into the nostrels, to place the sides togither in due order: afterward make a pipe of a goose quill, & arme it with saufte linnen clothes, conuaiing it so to lye within the nostrels, that there may be therby free passage for the breath. Of ligatures & rowling Hippochrates sayeth: they that are too curious in rowling, as they are without reason, hurtfull to manye other places, so especially to the nose. He saith furthermore, if that the inner part of the nose be brokē, it must be again restored, by putting in your

forefinger, or the patients, or a childes 
                     •
                  inger (for soft handes in this case, are necessarie) and so place eche parte in order againe. But if neither the forefinger, nor least finger can be put in, then do it with your probe: prouiding that this be don quickly, the first daye: or soone after: for that these bones, both admit there callous glewinge, and are hardened also, by the 11. daye, vnlesse they fall to be corrupted. And as within, so without like wise, the Artists hande must be working, to restore the seuered partes to their natural placing againe. It is manifest therfore, that to the nose, cannot a fit bynding be applyed: but after stitching, some glutinatorie water or other of that kinde, or albumen oui, with a

               If a nerue in the neck be cut, there followeth some maime.Prog. A wounde pearcing to the back marrow, is mortall & incurable. And if it come not at the marrow, though it then be curable, yet is there a feare of the losse of sense and mouing of those partes, which these wounded nerues, taking their originall from that hurt part of the back, do serue. A wound that toucheth the recurrent nerues, causeth hoarcenes. A wound in the great veines & arteries is perillous. A wounde in the gullet, or in the wesand, is perillous.

If the kell be hurt, it yeeldeth way through his substance and is full of bloud. Also it is blacke in colour or swartish. If the small guts be hurt, there is vtterance of the extrementes,

and the wounde is aboue the nauell. If the great guttes, the wound is beneath the nauell, with vtterance of excrementes. If the stomach bee hurte, Chylus goeth foorth, and the wounde is in the fore part. If the liuer: fluxe of bloud, the wounde beeing on the right side. If the splene: issue of feculent matter, and the wounde on the left side. If the kidneis: effusion of watrish bloud, the wounde being in the region of the kidneis
                     •
                   If the bleddar be pearsed, there is issue of vrine that waye, and the wounde is about pecten. If the matrice be hurt, there is fluxe of bloud, and the wounde is vnder the nauell.
               The great guttes are easier healed, the smaller sort more hardly,Prog. and the hungrie gutte is not curable. The stomach, liuer, &c. are scarce to be cured. Vnlesse there be speede vsed in the putting in of the intrels, they become inflate with winde, through coldenesse of the ayre, and so are harde to be reduced. So also, vnlesse the kell bee speedily preuented, for issuing out, it is verie soone altered and corrupted. Woundes & stitchings

about the middest of the belly are more difficult and daungerous then those about the sides.
               The impendent accidents

If paine doe come, it is to be mitigated as in other places is sayde. Also for a tumor, or bubo, here happening, you are to finde addresse in his proper place. If there bee tormentes in the guttes through their wounding, foment the bellie with wine, wherein hath boyled semen anisi, & faeniculi, with other thinges that discusse windinesse, and chamomilla, and melilo

                     um, with other mitigatiues. Nowe if the wounde pearse the kell, it must be vnited and restored to his place. If it hange out of the wounde, tie it with a threede, and so cutte off that which hangeth out, and after cauterize it euen to the ligature, and then put it in: but so as the threede may yet hange foorth at the wound: which, at the fall of the escar, may afterwarde be pulled foorth therewith. Some vse

no cauterie, because that which corrupteth, will in processe of time come fitly away with the threede. The kell being restored to his place, the outer lippes of the wounde are to be vnited and stitched, so as the stitch on one side be higher, on the other side lower. The manner of this stitche (in fewe wordes here passed ouer) I will plainelyer deliuer out of approoued practises.

To the heade, are Achor, or tinea, vlcer of the eie, tearie fistula, vlcer of the nose, mouth, and eares. To the brest, such as beare the name of the brest.

CHAP. XIIII. Alopecia, and Ophiasis.
               
                  Definition
                  ALopecia is a falling of the here, after which, certaine vacant places are left in the heade. It differeth from Ophiasis, both in figure, place, and age. For Alopecia keepes no propper figure, but indifferently sheweth it selfe in any, and is incident to the forepart of the head beard, eie browes, and any age. But Ophiasis euer appeareth in one certain figure,Differēce. namely, not exceeding the breadth of two fingers from the nape of the heade: it creepeth on with his two heads, to both the eares: in some to the foreheade, neuer ceasing, till it haue ioyned both his heades in the forepart of the foreheade. And this disease is incident (for the most part) to young children, and that to the heade onely.
               
                  Causes & signes.They are engendred otherwhiles, of the naughtinesse of some common matter, and other sometime, of some speciall & peculier matter. It is meant

to be of common matter, when it cō
                  meth of a common, and as it were, accustomed putrefying of humors, which eate awaie the rootes of the heares. For the heares doe come of certaine dryed vapours, resolued by moderate heate, which, whilest they passe out through the pores of the skin, are thrust out into their fourme, of length and roundnesse, and dryed by the ayre. Which againe doe easily fall, when as by some vitious humor they are stubbed vp. And this may be serous or thinne bloud: then is it with a redde colour in the skinne, and in a young flourishing age, a sanguine complexion: and in such one as hath vsed meates of much and good iuyce. Or it may be of choler, which you shall knowe by palenes of the skinne, cholericke complexion, hote and dry temperature, hote dyet, and youthful age. It maye likewise

                   proceede of flegme, eyther sweete or salt: the sweete, is apparaunt by whitenesse of skinne, boyish age, colde and moyst temperament, and colde and moyst nourishment. Salt flegme also bringeth foorth white colour ioynde with

dandroufe, ytching, &c. If it bee of melancholie: blackenesse of skinne, with melancholicke complexion and custome of dyet, will declare it.

cure or not, two thinges must bee considered: one is the time: for if it be of late growing, it may be cured, but if it be of long continuance, it is eyther impossible, or at the least verie difficult. The other thing is the affect or disease it selfe, & so Alopecia, which commeth of the leprosie is seldome, or neuer cured. Ophiasis sometime healeth of the owne accord, and with out application of any remedie: but Alopecia doth not so.

               CHAP. XXV. Of the filthie and putrified vlcer.
               
                  
                  Def.A Filthie and putrified vlcer, is that, which through his malitious nature, putrifieth the member, shedding out from it, either viscositie, soft flesh: or a stinking crust, from which vapoureth a filthie and carrennish fume.Frandulēt vlcer. Such an vlcer is also called fraudulent. But if it goe forwarde in his malice, and fall a creeping, it degenerateth into sphacelus. It commeth commonly after a Ca

                  Causes & signes.The cause is, sanguine humor depraued, thicke and boyling. The part affected is manifest, and the signes of the vlcer are euident by the definitiō.
               
                  Prog.If the malice of this vlcer

                   growe walkeripe, that is, fall a creeping, it turneth to Sphacelus, and so to the death of the partie.
               
                  Cure.First, the sanguine humor, which is thicke and boyling, and hath gotten a certaine venimousnes and malignitie, is to be euacuated by bloudletting, dyet, and purging medicines, as is before set down in the cure of phlegmon, Carbuncle and Gangraene. Then that in the parte affected is to bee

clensed, and done awaye, by medicines, such as, farina hordei, fabarum, cicerum, orobi, lupinorum, iris, apium, aristolochia, hypericum, centaurium minus, gentiana, marrubium, mel. aqua mulsa, aqua marina, lixiuium, &c. Wash therefore the filth away, with water and honie, or wine & honie, or with aqua marina: or a lee made ex ℥.iiij. cineris caulium, & corticis fabarum, cum aquae pluuiae li.j. or, ex lixiuij ℥.iiij. mellis ℥.j. & pulueris praecipita

               CHAP. XXVI. Of a deepe and hollowe banked vlcer.
               DEepe, cunniuaulted, or cauernous vlcers,Def. are those, which hauing straite orifices outwarde, and large scope &

profunditie inward, make many turninges and fouldinges, out of sight: some strayght, some crooked: yet without hardnesse or callous growing.
               They come commonly of apostemes not opened in dewe time,Causes & Signes. or woundes vnartificially handled. The reason is this, that matter which is retained longer time, in a ripe aposteme then is meete, becommeth sharpe and fretting, and so (at length) worketh corners and cauities to it selfe, which are verie hardly healed. For to the affected parte, which nowe is become weake, will all superfluous humors both of the next partes, and of the whole bodie, flowe, and by that meanes, the vlcer become hardly curable. The vlcers hollownesse is discernable by diligent sounding the same, eyther with tentes or probes of siluer or leade: or smal stalks or roots of herbes, or waxe candles: else certaine coloured iniections.
               The goodnesse,Prog. and litle quantitie of sanies, or pus, with the vanishing of paine & swelling, which first were present, shewe the hollownesse to fill

with flesh and be glutinated: or contrariwise.
               Appoynt a slender dyet, according to the nature of the bodie,Cure. & humors. And purging medicines after the like rate. If there be any distemperature, phlegmon, Erysipelas, or paine, first remooue them. For vnlesse the symptomes bee first doone away
                     •
                   the vlcers cauitie cannot be filled vppe. For it cannot be, that eyther the growing of fleshe, or ioyning of cauities, or inducing of cicatrices, cann
                     •
                   be rightly perfourmed, vnlesse the subiect fleshe comme first to his naturall state and condition. And howe these accidentes maye bee remooued, you shall obserue out of the curation of woundes. If the hollownesse of the vlcer reache downwarde, and the orifice bee aboue, eyther make incision from the orifice to the bottome (which is best to doe when the hollowe runneth by the skinne) or at least make a vent in the bottome, if it bee perillous to doe otherwise. But the best is alwayes, (if nothing gayne stande it) to dissect the hollownesse thoroughout,

rather then to make incision on the other side of the hollowe. For so shall the vlcer be brought to healing both easilyer and sooner. The cauitie being all layde open, by applying then, fitte medicines, on your lintes and plageates, so purge and dry the whole hollownesse, that at the length, flesh may grow again, the cauitie be filled, & the vlcer brought to perfect soundnesse: after the order set downe in the chap. of deepe and hollowe woundes. But if you make your incision on the other side of the hollowenesse, suffer first some sufficient store of matter to gather togither in the bottome of the cauity, to the making of the skinne both thinner, and

After this agayne, when neede requireth, put in a fresh ceton, armed with some mundifying medicine: which you shall the aptlier doe, by tying, or stitching it to the olde, when it is plucked out. Otherwise, if neither the cauitie can commodiously bee cut foorth, nor yet opened in the bottome: yet then haue you cure for it, by mundifying, incarnatiue, and glutinatiue medicines: thus, first mundifie it with iniections, made ex oxymel.

And those are alwayes perillous also, that tende to the guttes. A fistula in the fundament, lurking without an orifice, or that hath manifolde turnings, or endeth in the bone, is hardly healed. A fistula manifolde wise creeping, with many turning corners and crooked windinges, is cured only by the hande. If a fistula pearce deeper, then that a collirie can bee sent into it, it is curable onely by handie operation.
               First the cause of the fistula,Cure. to wit, hurtfull humors hindring the healing of it, are to bee diminished and taken away, partly by dyet, partly by preparing and purging medicines, according to the nature of the humors. Secondly the inner ꝑts must be strengthened as by these potio

The handie operation to bee perfourmed in this case, is eyther incision only, without cauterie, or else incision and cauterie togeather. The incision doone alone, is to be followed all along the hollowe, to the verie botome of the fistula: after which you must take out the callous, either with your nayles, or instrumentes, so as the place, may bee left pure and cleane from all filthinesse

& quick & perfect flesh euery where appeare: & this is the true cure of the fistula: which must be done by and by in the beginning, if nothing let. Incision and cauterie togeather is thus to be done, if nerues or arteries forbidde not. First trye, whether the fistula runne right forwarde, or crooked, by searching with a probe o

If there bee manie turninges or windinges, those prosecute in like sorte, with probe and kniffe. Nowe when you are come to the ende of the fistula, fill all the vlcer, so, with tentes, or lintes, dipte in the white of an egge, as the lippes of it may bee kept asunder for going togeather againe. The daye following, burne the place, either with hote yron, or causticke: to wit, cum puluere asphodelorum, vel arsenico, vel hydrar
                        •

incision, as deepe as can bee, and as is lawefull to goe, if it bee possible take awaye the callousnesse rounde about, as was sayde euen nowe: and if anye of it be left behynde, waste it afterwarde with some burninge medicine. If much callous haue remayned, and will not giue place to such medicines, burne it with hote yrons.

And thus the fistula being burned, and dryed, as it ought, must be attended the first dayes following, with some mitigatorie medicine: as oleo cum oui luteo mixto. After that, applying those thinges, that may loose the cruste: suche as butter or other like.

               A cancer that is in the veines,Prog. synewes and bones, is hardly cured. An aged cancer, and such as hath gotte a habite in the member, is vncurable. So also is a cancer hidden in the interiour partes.
               First take away the melancholicke humor,Cure. by diet, bloudletting, and purging, like as is afore set downe, in

the hidden, or not exvlterate cancer. Then for the cancer it selfe, if it bee externall, and superficially rooted, fetch it out, roote and all, with instrumentes or causticke medicines: to wit, cutte it wholly awaye, with an incision kniffe, and presse the thicke bloud, out of all the veynes neere to it, that it may flow forth. After again ioyne the lippes of the vlcer, and goe forwarde to cure it as another vlcer. Some consume it with a cautery. And others, after the cutting and pressing out the bloud, applye also a cauterie, with causticke medicines it maye be doone: as cum arsenico sublimato. But then the places about it, must be defended, with an vnguent de bolo, for auoyding inflammation. After procure the casting of the escar: and so proceede in the cure, as in other vlcers. Nowe if the cancer vlcerate, bee in some inner part, deepely rooted, and neere a principall part, so as it cannot be cured, yet then at the least, wee maye vse meanes to hinder his encrease: as letting bloud, if nothing hinder, and vsing such a dyet as may eng

                  Cure.Your patient being placed, according as his case requireth, appoynt two ministers to applye their handes to the fracture, one aboue, another beneath it, which may by pulling the member, one vpwarde, another downewarde, or the one to the right hande, the other to the lefte warde: in iust order, ioyne againe the broken partes of the bone, and fit them to their naturall fashion and placing. If you stande in neede of more force, or

                  tronger stretching, prepare large tyals of strong linnen, which being fastened aboue and beneath the

                  racture, with two assistantes, one drawing one waye, another another way, pull out the member as much as you neede: taking heede that you make not ouer violent extension in the member, specially in dryer bodies, lest vehement paine, feuers, conuulsion and resolutions bee procured. Beware also, that in the stretchinge of the mēber, none of the outstrouting bones be broken, which would make 
                     •
                  he cure more difficult to perfourme.

when the member therefore is somewhat more then naturally stretched out, applye your handes then to the fracture, and couch the bones in their places againe: after let those that stretch the member let go their hands by little and little, till the member be againe returned to his length. And thus you shall knowe whether the bones be right: if the paine do slacke, and the sense of pricking vanish. Hippocrates in his booke of fractures, teacheth another kinde of setting, by the instrument called glossocomium: which is doone, like as, by the sentence of a iudge, tormenters stretch vppon the rack, suspected persons: notwithstanding that this other wai is both more easie and familier. After nowe the bones are couched in their places againe, let your studie be, so to retaine and keepe them. Anoynt there

Galen calleth that the rightest figure, which hath the veines, arteries and muscles rightest. The cornered figure is rightest to the arme. Therefore to the conseruation of the rowled member, some fewe (most closely) strawe in a linnen cloth, and making thereof as it were a bed, doe place and tie the mēber therein. Others make a case fit For it, after the same maner.

As if ther be a contusion withal, your ligature shal not bee as aforesaid, but as Hippochrates counselleth; your roll must runne from either side of the contusion, slopewise along, after the fashion of the Greeke letter

                  , that the contused place may remayne vncouered, so as you maye alwayes come to dresse it, not vnrowling the member.

of it: for that sometime while the bones are placed, great perill, naye death it selfe is inferred. For when as the nerues and muscles thereabout lying, are by stretching easily enflamed, it followeth likewise that grieuous dolour, great conuulsions, and sharpe feuers must easely ensue, especially in the great ioyntes. For the nearer that the luxated ioynt with a wound, is to the principall members, the greater feare is it, of the comming of such accidents. Therefore according to Hippochrates iudgement, no ioyntes can bee safely set againe, besyde the handes, feete and fingers: in which also, he warneth of wise proceeding, and that nothing bee done headely or rashly. Therefore, to be shorte, the ioyntes luxated, must by and by, in the beginning (while the part is void of inflamatiō) be placed, but a ioynt displaced with a wounde also, must be assayed to bee set, by a meane intension, or stretching, because it cānot suffer much stretching, without daunger. If it succede aright, vse diligence, that no inflammation arise. But if there growe inflamation,

conuulsion, or other such, after the ioynt is placed, displace the same againe, if it may be done without violence, and if wee feare such a hazarde or perill (because peraduenture the ioynt inflamed, will no

                  , without force, bee driuen from his place againe. It shal be better, if (in the beginninge, in such cases of the great ioynts, as the thighes & shoulders) you leaue of, & deferre the placing of them. Afterwarde, when the inflammation is ceassed, (which is commonly the seuenth, or ninth daye after) vsing some preface to the patients frinds, of the daunger that is like to followe such reposition, as also on the other side, that lamenesse and weakenesse necessarily followe, if it be not set: endeuour safely, & without violence, to driue the bone into his place againe. As for the wounde, deale with it according as is taught afore in the fracture with a wounde. Also obserue that euerie displaced member, with a wounde. If it be not set againe, must so be placed, as may be most to the patients ease. Aboue all, see that it bee not mooued, nor

hang downwarde. If there be a fracture with the luxation, yet without a wounde, the member then is to be extended, according to the common manner, and so with the handes to be fashioned into his place, according as is taught in simple fractures before. But if there be a wound also, a conuenient cure thereof, is to be fetched from the instructions alreadie giuē, for the handling of fractures & luxations complicate with woundes. And to speake in a worde: if a luxation happen with a fracture, the luxation (if it may be) first, the fracture next is to be restored. If that cannot be, then compasse the cure of the fracture first, and after his Callus is growne firme, vndertake the luxation. Nowe concerning accidents:Acciden
