            I. WEBBE, D. OF PHYS: TO HIS MVCH ESTEEMED Friend, FRA: L. Esquire.
            
            
               YOur in-bred loue of knowledge, equaliz'd with able industrie; and your applause, and furtherance of a publicke benefit, brought vs acquainted.

In that an office freely done to any peculiar person, is very laudable; but extending it selfe to an vniuersality; obliegeth, and vniteth all men. For, as the mutuall participation of particulars, and their vse, and faculties in a body naturall: So breedeth it, a louing harmony, and perpetuity, in that which is politicall: harmony of minds, through vniting courtesies; perpetuitie of being so, by an affectionate acceptance, and gratefull acknowledgement. Whereupon, there is not onely an exchange of fauours, out of the endowments of fortune: but from th'elaborated experience also, of such as are not enuious, proceedeth a willing demonstration of all, either infused, or acquired sciences; euer binding, by reiterated offices, the receiuer to a

new addition of thankefulnesse, and the giuer to parti
                  •
               ipate through a former deseruing gratitude. And this was the mayne occasion that I, (true friend) breaking the ice of my long concealed blessings, and inuentions, laid open to your view those christall, and abounding fountaines, which, who so tasteth, so instantly be-deweth his vnderstanding, with so recreating a Balsamum, that it springeth in the coldest Winter, and is euer fruitfull. This powerfull and celestiall water, is (as you beheld) enuironed with a guard of auncient Authors, of the most admired perfection in all professions; and such, as from the riches of their wisedomes, haue left rules, precepts, and authorities; as legacies, regalities, and prerogatiues; by which all after-ages,

conditions of men, and dominions; haue beene, and must be instituted, maintain'd, and gouerned. All these, though they bewray'd a willingnesse, to embrace you, and graunt you accesse vnto that fountaine: yet through an auncient familiaritie, begunne in childhood, betweene your selfe, and Cicero, which was one of them, you sought this courtesie rather from him, and hee gaue rather way thereto, then any other. And as he was euer of an affable disposition, & had beene well read in the conditions of all men, and, delighted to be frequented, by the most illuminated vnderstandings; hee so tasted your inclination, that, calling me from clensing, (as my custome is) and purifying that fountaine, he requested me, in

token of his affection, to present you with one volume of his Epistles. I ask't him which? Hee answered; the Familiar. In what Language? English. Whereat I blush't, and smiled. Hee gathering, mine inward thoughts by mine outward carriage, sayd; Blush not to bee made a Translator of so ordinarie Bookes as mine Epistles; In that, things the more ordinarie they are; argue the more vniuersall acceptance: and besides, men of greater shew, haue held their translations of lesser moment, for their greatest ornaments: But blush to thinke that Cicero, whose letters bewray his conuersation, and whose conuersation was with Consuls, Kings, Imperator's, Praetors, Quaestors, Tribunes, Generals, and friends of his owne ranke,

               Caesar, Pompeius, Lepidus, Antonius, Brutus, Cassius, Cato, Plancus, Lentulus, Deiotarus, Octauianus, and such great Potentates; and at that time when all the world was subiect vnto one dominion, and himselfe in it a chiefe Commander; I say blush, to conceyte that he, should reduce such Epistles into Volumes, onely for little ones. And wrong not thine owne iudgement so farre, as to imagine, that euery man of thy Nation, and Countrie, which is desirous, and worthy to read mine Epistles, is able to vnderstand them in their originall: goe on then; for those that ruled all men haue beene rul'd by me; be thou then ruled; and goe on. When I heard this, my shamefull blush was turned to a daring boldnesse;

which made mee replie, Commaund: but, thou art the whole worlds greatest Orator; and I, when these are ended, shall be but a young Translator; Let me bring thee a Sydney, a Great L: Chancellor, or a Sandys; that can parallel thy Latine, with our English Language. No, sayd mine Author; they haue done; doe thou. With that, I asked him, how? Hast thou forgotten, sayd hee, that, Epistolas quotidianis verbis 
                     •
                  exere solemus? Here I grew silent: but not so silent, as presumptuous; For, hence came these Epistles. Neither did I forget a French Doletus, and Italie's Manutius, who had dared as much, and were applauded. But when I was almost at an end, and met with, aliter scribimus, quod 
                     •
                  os solos

quibus mittimus, aliter quod multos lecturos putamus. I was absolutely determined to commend my former labours, to the secretest of all friends, a fire. But you, at that very instant, sent by destinie, repriued them: and requested my patience once more to reade them, and returne you them. 'Tis done, and by these you shall receiue them. Send backe your censure; and Farewell.

               nge the iniuries of that King, whom the Senate and people of Rome had not long before graced with those attributes of Friend, and Companion. A decree of the Senate was forthwith enacted, That the Consulls should cast lots which of them should restore him to his Countrie. The first lot fell to Lentulus, together with the gouernment of Cilicia and Cyprus. For Spaine; that

fell to his Colleague Metellus, was too remote from Aegypt, and not to be annexed to the reducement of the King of Alexandria. Against this decree, and ballottation C. Cato Tribune of the people opposed; obiecting religion; and alleadging an Oracle out of the Sibyline verses. That, if the King were reduced by a multitude, it would prooue dangerous to the Common-wealth. Then, they deliberated, who should reduce him without an armie. Some stucke to Lentulus, whom they had formerly aswell by decree, as lot receiued: some thought it fit to send Pompeius; some, otherwise. The varietie of opinions prolonged the businesse: but Cato's audacitie ouerthrew it. For, from the beginning of his Tribuneship, hee by dayly detractions, prouoked enuie both against the King, and Lentulus. At length a law being diuulged,

to abrogate the gouernment of Lentulus in Cilicia; his friends withdrew their thoughts, from a lesser care, to a greater feare. And Pompeius, wa

Hee found his kingdome vnder the Dominion of Archelaus friend to Gabinius, in the right of his wife Berenice, eldest of the three daughters of the said Ptolemaeus: but he slue them both in his restoring.

                  Ammonius the Kings Ambassadour manifestly withstands vs by money; And the businesse is carried by those Creditors who had the managing thereof while you were present. There are but few, if any, that are inclining to the Kings suite, and they all will haue the businesse referred to Pompeius. The Senate giues way to the brute raised of the Religion, not for the Religion, but for iust disdaine, and hatred, taken against the Kinges briberie or corruption. We cease not to exhort and intreat Pompeius, and in conclusion, freely to reprehend him, and to admonish him that he draw not on him so great an infamie. But my entreaties and aduertisements are needlesse: for, as well in his priuate discourses, as openly in the Senate, he hath so carried your cause, that no man could with greater eloquence, grauitie, endeuour, or earnestnesse haue pleaded it; acknowledging your fauour to him; and his loue to you in the best fashion he was able. You know you haue displeased Marcellinus. Yet, this cause of the Kings excepted, h

                   makes plaine demonstration, that in any other occasion hee will fauour you to the vtmost of his abilitie. And we are contented with his pleasure. Ther

                   and I, and Lucullus, touching the Armie, let the religion carrie it: (for otherwise we should doe nothing,) yet remitting our selues to the order made when you propounded the matter; we stand for you: that the Senate may commit vnto you the charge of restoring the King without the Armie, as the Religion requireth: so that you may doe it without indangering the Common wealth. Crassus chooseth three Ambassadours, not excluding Pompeius: for my meaning is of such as haue publicke authoritie: Bibulus also three Ambassadours, priuate Cittizens, and with him agree the other Consulars, except Seruilius; (who holdeth that in no case he should be restored;) And Volcatius, (who consenting with Lupus chooseth Pompeius:) and Afranius, (who assenteth to V
                        •
                     lcatius:) which thing augmenteth the suspition of the intention of Pompeius. For it is found, that Pompeius friends agree vnto the opinion of Volcatius. The difficulties are manie; and the businesse beginnes to grow doubtfull: The manifest, and earnest practises of Libon and Hipsaeus, and the great desire of all Pompeius friends, bewray the hidden fire of his ambition, to haue the managing of this businesse. And they that contradict him, are not

friends to you, who haue so much extolled him. My authoritie herein is the lesse, by reason of my obligation to you. And the impression which men haue made touching Pompeius intention drowneth my fauours, they surmising, that they shall gratifie him by this occasion. Things are now in the same estate with vs, as they were long before your departure; being as w

               THE xiij. of Ianuary the Senate determined nothing: because the greatest part of that day was spent in Controuersies, betweene the Consull Lentulus, and Caninius Tribune of the people. At which time I also spak much on your behalfe, and by manifest tokens

                   Tribune of the people (because he had made the motion for Pompeius) began to contend, that it belonged vnto him rather than to the Cōsuls to command that euery one should goe to that side to which they were most addicted. But his speech was interrupted by the out-cryes of all men: because it was a

thing new found out, and without sence or reason. The Consuls neither assented vnto him, nor were they greatly repugnant. They were contented the day should be thus driuen ouer, and so it was. For they well perceiued that the greatest part would follow Hortentius: though they outwardly seemed to allow of the opinion of Volcatius. Manie were requested to giue their opinion, and that with great vexation of the Consuls, whose desire was that the opinion of Bibulu
                        •
                     
                   might be preferred. This controuersie endured till night, and then the Senate rose; and I, as it fell out, supt that night with Pompeius, lighting thereby vpon this occasion more fit than heretofore hath beene offered, as being the first Senate day, that hath since your departure prooued fortunate vnto vs. I so reasoned the matter with him, that he seemed to giue credite wholly to my discourse, and to deliberate how he might fauour you. Hearing his own tale, I must needs free him from the least touch of Ambition: but when I consider the carriage or passages of his familiar acquaintance, of what degree soeuer, I finde that assuredly true, that at length is manifested to all the world: that all this cause hath beene before this time by some corrupted, and not without the knowledg or priuitie of the King himselfe, and of

his Counsellers. These I wrote the 14. of Ianuarie before day, in which the Senate was to sit. We shall as I hope maintaine our reputation in the Senate so far, as is possible in this so persidious an age, and full of iniustice. As for the popular respects, I thinke we haue so carried things, that nothing can be done with the people, without the violating of diuine authoritie, or breach of lawes, no nor without compulsion. Yesterday the Senate ratified the things aforesaid, by interposing of their graue authoritie: to which though Cato, and Caninius opposed themselues, yet it was registred, and I thinke it shall be sent vnto you. I will not faile to giue you good accompt hereafter of euery thing that passeth: and I will engage all my thoughts, endeuours, diligence, and friends, in the effecting this businesse, to our owne contentment. Farewell.

And no man can report other than that the Senate, hath had good respect of you: for it is well knowne, that your aduersaries haue hindred the dispatch of your cause, but if they shall attempt now any thing by wicked and trecherous proceedings (as they haue done) vnder pretence or name of the people of Rome, it is sufficiently prouided,

                  er, to bring about the cause of the king; when on the sodaine Cato, beyond

all imagination, proposed a wicked law, which did not onely hinder the cause, but hath made that businesse, which was before light, and easie; to be very difficult, and desperate. But, though in so crosse an accident, we are to expect all mischiefe; yet wee feare nothing more than treacherie. Come what will come, let Cato be wel assured, we will resist him. About the restoring of the king, I promise you thus much, that I will so bestur me, that you shall rest fully satisfied. Yet I doubt, that either the businesse may be taken out of our hands; or that there will be no further proceeding in it: and I cannot well determine, which of these two courses will leaft content me. But if it come to this passe; there is a third way which neither Selicius, nor I dislike. That we neither suffer the King to be abandoned; nor let him be put ouer vnto that man for his restoring, who is alreadie thought, to haue obteined him. We will doe the best we can, that things may goe, as we would haue them: if not; we will so leaue off, that we may suffer no disgrace thereby. It is for a man of your wisedome, vnderstanding and valour; to be well assured, that all your greatnesse, and honour proceedes from your owne vertue, your noble actions, and graue proce

that, that the perfidiousnesse of any man can detract from you, in any thing wherein fortune hath inriched you. Knowing for certaine, that whatsoeuer is done in that kind, will turne to them more hurtfull, than to you hereafter. There is not an houre passes, but I am either doing something in your businesse, or contriuing how to doe it. And in euery thing I vse the helpe of Quintus Selicius: whom I esteeme as discreete, faithfull, and louing vnto you, as any of your other friends. I make accompt that you haue vnderstood both by frequent letters, and messengers, aswell what we haue now in hand, as that that hath beene hitherto effected. Of that, that is expected, I hold none fitter then my selfe, to send you mine opinion. I haue seene Pompeius vpon two occasiōs terribly troubled. First, for that on the

depth of the trouble I suffer about your businesse, my comfort is, that I hope assuredly, that the good Councell of your friends, and time it selfe, which discouereth the designes of enemies, and trecherous persons shal shelter you from their wicked pretences. One better comfort I haue more, calling to remembrance, my troubles past; whose very image I perceiue in your affayres, for although the blemish of your honor, is not to be compared with the losse of my well-fare: there is notwithstanding such a resemblance, that I cannot imagine, but you will hold me excused, if those things affright me not, which you your selfe neuer feared. But, be you that man, that I haue knowne you from your infancie; and credit me, the iniuries of men, shall make your greatnesse more illustrious. And expect from me the chiefest fauours, and offices that can be shewed you, for I will not faile your expectation. Fare you well.
            
            
               Cicero to Publius Lentulus Vice-consull. Ep. 7.
               
               I haue read your letters, in which you are thankfull vnto me, because I often acquaint you with all passages, and because

I make open demonstration to you of the affection I beare you. It was needlesse to thanke me, because I was oblieged to loue you, (if I would not appeare vnworthie of your good opinion:) and besides, I tooke delight in this frequent epistolar correspondence with you, seeing we could not in absence otherwise enioy one another. And when it fals out that I write not so often vnto you, it shall proceed from a distrust I shall haue to put my letters in euery mans hands. But alwaies, when I shal haue a faithful messēger, I wil not omit the opportunitie. Touching the particulars, which you desire to know, concerning your friends, they would be tedious to relate, but as for that, of which I haue often heretofore written vnto you, I can bid you now relie vpon it for a certaintie. That some, which both greatly could, and should haue fauoured you, haue enuied your greatnesse, and the course of your Fortunes. Although the case be not alike, yet it hath some equalitie with mine. For they that were offended with you, vpon an occasion that concerned the Common-wealth, haue openly withstood you; and those that were defended by you, haue not beene so mindfull of your valour, as hatefull of your commendation. At which time, as I haue heretofore at large written vnto you, I haue

knowne Hortentius, and Lucullus to be very affectionate towards you; and amongst those

Therefore know, that whatsoeuer I write, shall be written by his Councell, and opinion. I say then, till now the Senate hath not denied you the restoring of the King. Because that decree, that no man might restore him, was rather made out of furie then by reason; and the Tribunes as you know were thereunto opposed. You therefore hauing the gouernment of Silicia and Cyprus, may easily informe your selfe, whether your fo

                  er this manner, he shall be restored by you, as the Senate had in the beginning ord

                  ined; and restored without the armie, as these religious persons said, was according to the pleasure,

or liking of the Sibylla. And you shall thus doe a thing agreeable to the honour of your selfe, and of our Common-wealth. It is true, that the attempt seemes vnto vs, doubtfull, because wee know men will iudge according to the successe. And, if the matter should fall out as we would haue it, euery man will proclaime you wise, and valorous: If any misfortune should come betweene you and home, all men will say you were vaine, and ambitious. Wherefore, you shall better gather than we, whether the enterprise be secure, as hauing the estate of all Aegypt within your view. Our opinion is, that if you haue any certaintie, to possesse your selfe of that kingdome, that you defer no time in effecting it; but if the case be doubtfull, put not your selfe vpon it. This I assure you, that if you prosper in it, you shall be in your absence praised of many, and at your re

actions, not so much according to the counsell you haue embraced, as according to the end that shall ensue thereof. But if this way

                  hould appeare dangerous vnto you, we should like it well, that the king, (giuing assurance to those friends of yours, which in diuerse places of your Prouince, haue furnisht him with moneys;) should vse your ayde to returne into his kingdome. You being easily able to helpe him; aswell for the qualitie, as situation of your Prouince; he being destitute of a more sure meanes to returne withall. This is my opinion; now doe what you thinke best. Whereas you reioyce at my condition, at the familiaritie of Milo, at the vanitie and weaknesse of Clodius,

So that, hauing few or none against them, they haue fully obtained that of the Senate, which was neuer thought should haue beene granted by the people, without great commotion. And thus a stipend, with ten Ambassadors hath beene assigned and graunted vnto Caesar, and the time of his gouernment in France prolonged, contrarie to the Law Sempronia, which I write briefly vnto you, because the present state of the Common-wealth displeaseth me: yet I write it to aduertise you, that you may in time resolue your selfe to beleeue that, of which I by the studie of so many yeares, and much more by experience, am resolued; that, a man ought not to loue prosperitie without authoritie, nor it without prosperitie. Whereas you congratulate with me about my daughter, and Crassipes, I acknowledge your courtesie, and hope, that of such a marriage wee shall haue that content, which is desired. It resteth onely that I remember you, that you bring vp our Lentulus in all those sciences, to which you haue euer beene enclined: but aboue all things, that you put him vpon that course, which you haue holden: by which if he goe, there

Wherefore I, as well for the obligation that I haue to Pompeius, as to obey your comfortable, and safe Councels; and to maintaine my regained honour, together with my prosperitie; I fauour his

pretences, as he vpon your request hath fauoured me in my occasions. You know how full of trouble it is vnto a cittizen to change the habite of his mi

Notwithstanding I applie my selfe to this mans pleasure, not being able with honestie to gainesay him, neither doe I this as is peraduenture by some enformed, with dissimulation; because a naturall inclination, and loue, which I beare him, can doe so much with me, that I hold all things to be honest and

                  g. And in my iudgement his aduersaries also should doe well, if (not being able to withstand him) they should cease to contend longer with him. Verily this also giues me comfort, that euery man freely graunteth vnto me, as it were by a speciall priuiledge, either to fauour the disignes of Pompeius; or to be silent; or to retire me to our common studies, in which I take the greatest pleasure. And if his friendship forbid me not, I will by all meanes doe so; not being able to councell the common-wealth with that freedome I desire; nor with that authority, which I, after so manie troubles susteined in managing the gr

               YOur letters vvere very acceptable vnto me, because I vnderstood [by them] that you apparently perceiue how much I respect you; vvhich had not beene so well expressed, if I said I had loued you, because in my conceit,

that name of respect, although it be exceeding graue and holy; is notwithstanding of lesse vveight, and of much lesse price, then are the courtesies you haue done me. As for the thankes you render me, nothing hath thereunto more mooued you, then a certaine aboundance of affection; which giues occasiō, that you esteeme those things vvhich vvithout my vtter shame, and soule imputation cannot be pretermitted. But if all this time we haue beene separated, we had liued togither, and in Rome, I had made more manifest demonstration of my mind vnto you. For vvith equall commendation, in defence of the Common-wealth, vve should haue proceeded in euery action to one, and the selfe same end, and purpose.

And this disposition of mine I made knowne vnto the Senate, when you were Consull; and reasoned with your selfe often about it. Though from the beginning, when you sought that the Senate should restore my former losses, many things offended me; finding

                  iurie, equall vnto their merit past. Wherefore, although I knew my selfe much obliged to Pompeius; especially because you more then any man tolde mee, that you saw him very earnest in my cause; And although I loued him, not so much for hauing receiued curtesies from him, as because I haue beene alwayes inclined to affect him; thinking that he for his vertue had deserued it: yet without hauing any regard to what he desired, I followed my old custome, hauing in euery action, the good of the Common-wealth my sole obiect. And in token of the truth, Pompeius being of the Senate, when he went into

                  Rome, to commend Publius Sextius; and Vatinius one of the testimonies, had tolde, that I was become one of Caesars friends, moued thereunto by his happy fortune; I gaue him this answer. That the fortune of Bibulus, which hee esteemed full of misery, was greater in my estimation, then all the triumphs, and victories. And in another place, I said (euen in the presence of Pompeius,) that none but they thrust mee out of Rome, which where occasion that Bibulus feared to s

                     •
                  orget my owne calamities, and call to remembrance my owne actions? When I had spoken my opinion, there grew great alteration, in some particular persons, which had occasion; and in others also, which I

could neuer haue imagined. For the decree being made, after that manner that I had councelled; Pompeius, without making any demonstration vnto me, that he was displeased; tooke his iourney for Sardinia, and Africa: and went by Luca to meet with Caesar; who complained much of this deed of mine: as being incensed a little before in Rauenna, by Crassus, who had spoken much ill vnto him concerning mee: And, though I had vnderstood by many, that Pompeius was offended with mee; Yet my brother gaue mee the greatest notice, who meeting him in Sardinia, a little while after hee came from Luca, was thus saluted by him. In very deed, Sir, I desired to see no man rather then you: neither could fortune haue brought mee any man, with whom I could bee so much contented. If you take not such order, that your brother Marcus keepe the promise that you on his behalfe made vs, this debt will fall vpon you. What needs more vvords? He complained grieuously; hee made repetition of his deserts; hee called to memory the agreement made about the acts of Caesar; and follovved on yet further, that he knevv vvell, that Caesar lou'd my happinesse; p

                  he honour of the aforesayd [Caesar.] And that at the least, I should not

oppugne him, if I vvould not, or could not help him. When I had from my brother vnderstood these things, and Vibullius, by commission of Pompeius, hauing beene a little before to speake vvith mee, that I should in courtesie leaue, till his returne, the Campan cause, in the state it vvas in: driuen to bethinke me of my selfe, I turned me vvholly to consider mine ovvne affaires, becomming after a sort petitioner to the Common-vvealth: That in consideration of so much paines, as I had taken for it, it vvould be pleased to grant me, that I might shevv my selfe gratefull tovvards my benefactours, and continue the trust of my brother; and that it vvould suffer that man to bee good, vvhom in all occasions it had found to be a good Citizen. Novv in all my actions and sentences, vvhich seeme to offend Pompeius, I perceiued, that there vvere certaine persons vvhom you may imagine, vvhich, notvvithstanding they vvere of my opinion, and had alvvaies beene so, yet they reioyced, that I follovved not the vvill of Pompeius; hoping assuredly, that he, for that cause should grovv a cold friend vnto me, and Caesar a capitall enemie. I had iust occasion to be grieued hereat; but much more, that in my pr
                     •
                  sence, they did most familiarly embrace, vvelcome, and kisse mine enemie. But vvhy doe I say, mine

enemie? rather enemie of the Lavv, of the Courts of Iustice, of the quiet of his Countrey, and in conclusion, of all men of honesty. vvith that demonstration, they had an opinion they should mo

These passages therefore considered, and making a calculation, vvith that vnderstanding that God had giuen mee, I reduced into forme all my discourses: vvhich if I be able, I vvil briefly recount vnto you. If I should see the Common-vvealth to bee gouerned by vvicked & loose Citizens, as vve knovv falleth out in our times; and haue vnderstood, to haue at other times also occurred; no force, either of revvards, vvhich I slightly esteeme, nor yet of dangers, vvhich were vvont to feare the stou

                        •
                     cius Pompeius, vvho, vvith his great deserts tovvards it, and vvith his vvorthy actions, hath gotten this povver, and estimation; and I hauing from my youth fauoured, nay, I say more, hauing furthered him, both vvhen I vvas Praetor, and vvhen I vvas Consull, and he in like manner helping mee, as vvell

by councell, as by fauour; and vnvvilling to haue other enemy in the Citie, then that man that vvas to me an enemy; I thought not, that I should bee held for inconstant, if I had a little altered some of my opinions; inclining my vvill to that, vvhich appertained to the dignity, both of a man of his sort, and of such an one, as vvas my Benefactour. And being of this minde, it vvas necessarie for me, as you see, that I should also fauour Caesar, hee being invvard vvith Pompeius; to vvhich, partly ancient friendship much moued me, that I and my brother Quintus haue alvvaies, as you knovv, held vvith Caesar; partly, the humanity and courtesie, vvhich hee hath many vvayes in short time shevved vs. And to this, the respect of the Common-wealth, made great addition: seeming vnto mee, that it did not onely dislike, but strangely refused, that there should be any contention with men of that quality. Especially Caesar hauing performed many valorous actions thereunto behoofefull. And I being heretofore entred into such deliberation, was vpon the former occasions, altogether settled, by reason of the testimonie, that Pompeius had giuen of me to Caesar, and my brother to Pompeius. Moreouer, I should haue considered, that which is by our Plato written so diuinely; that, Citizens

were wont to bee such, as their Gouernours. I remember the first day of my Consulship, and often afterwards, that I might keepe the Common-wealth in a direct course, and at one stay, I layd so strong foundations, and in such a manner encouraged the Senate, that it was no maruell, though it carried it selfe so stoutly in December following. And in conclusion, I remembred: that from the time of our Consulship, vntill that of Caesar and Bibulus, men liued in exceeding peace, and vnity; And vpon any occasion wee had to speake in Senate, our opinions had that esteeme that was befitting: afterwards; at that time when you were Gouernour of the hither Spaine, the Common-wealth hauing no Consuls, but Merchants of Prouinces, and seruants, and ministers of seditions; fortune would, to giue occasion of war, throw mee into the midst of the Camp of discord, and ciuill contention. In which danger, the Senate hauing readily raised it selfe, and whole Italy, with the strength of the best men, in my defence and assistance: I will not relate what happened; because I should complaine of many; I will onely in briefe say, that I needed no army, but I wanted Commanders; And the fault was in generall of all those, which did not defend mee; but particularly of those,

which were tyed to defend me. And if they should bee reprehended, which were truely fearefull, they which counterfetted feare, are so much more blame-worthy. Certainely, that disposition of my minde was worthy of commendation; when seeing my Citizens most ready to succour mee, and desirous, to shew me their thankfulnes; yet because they were without Leaders, I would not put them to encounter with armed seruants. But it sufficed me, onely to sh
                     ••
                  , how much strength should haue beene by consent of good men gathered, if they had had occasiō of a battaile for me, when I was strong, and lusty; seeing they could afterwards, when I was at the weakest, giue mee succour. Whose mindes you did not onely know, when you took paines about mee, but also you confirmed and maintained [them.] And I will neuer deny; rather, while I breath, I will be mindefull, and report it willingly; that you vsed the means of some most noble personages, which were more strong in restoring me, then they were after in retaining mee. In which intention, if they had perseuered; together with my prosperitie, they had regained th

And afterwards, Milo, Tribune of the people, and with him many iust men, entreating, that this seditious Citizen might, according to his fact, bee punished; the Iudges, against all rights of Iustice, did acquit h

And afterwards, the very same Iudges permitted, that the name of Enemy, was with bloudy letters engrauen, in the house, that was not mine, (because it was no booty of mine, I hauing onely a hand in the building thereof) but did belong vnto the Senate, who payd the charges of it.

And because those that enuie me, and especially mine enemies, thought, that the blow giuen mee by banishment, had partly taken away my courage, you could not imagine how much I haue deceiued their expectation. Heretofore, of Quintus Metellus, son of Lucius, who was a stout man, and of a strong heart, and in my iudgement, for greatnesse, and constancie of minde surpassing all men; they reported, that they vnderstood, (though I hold it rather to bee a thing of their owne forging,) that hee being returned from banishment, made alwai

I had not the like libertie; because I could neither say, that the people of Rome, vvere so mad, as Plato once found that of Athens; and because, I hauing beene now long time conuersant in the Common-wealth, it seemed troublesome vnto me to take my selfe from it.

After that, Caesar sought me, with intreaties of greatest e

Whence it proceeds, that the malice of others cannot hurt me: by the which I should haue beene shrewdlie foyled, if I had not made me a buckler of those which are the most honoured, and potent Citizens: because my wonted guard was not sufficient to defend me.

Moreouer, I haue written in verse three bookes of my owne troubles, and calamities; and if I had thought good to haue devulged them, I had not deferred so long to send you them; because they are, and shall be perpetuall testimonies of your fauours towards me, and of my thankfulnesse and affection towards you. But I haue not sent them, for feare: not of those, which would hold themselues offended, (because of them I haue written both little, and sleightly,) but of my benefactors, who being in number infinite, it was impossible I should of euery one make mention.

For if you had but vsed them in a little more gentle manner, they would haue beene contented. I will not now bee slacke in defending what you haue decreed: but you know what manner of men these customers are: and you know, with what furie they were enraged against Quintus Scaeuola.

                  ose, me to be negligent in writing: yet it grieues mee not so much to bee accused of negligence, as it is pleasing vnto me, that you inuite me to put pen to paper: for in the one I am altogether blamelesse, and in the other you

shew me that affection, which though I haue formerly perceiued, yet in the acknowledgement thereof I receiue much contentment. I haue euer written, when I had oportunitie of sending: and who, in this kinde is more officious then my selfe? But from you I can sweare, that I haue not receiued aboue two, or three letters at the most; and very short ones. Wherefore, if you, as a strict Iudge, looke too narrowly to the matter, I will bee euen with you in the same errour: if you bee vnwilling, that I should vse you thus; you were best to iudge discreetly. But let this much suffice about letters: for I shall finde out meanes enough to giue you satisfaction herein, If I shall know how to please you concerning them. Your absence troubles, and contents me. It troubles mee; because it h

it is impossible, that I should euer 
                     •
                  orget your deserts: I would that you also should call to minde, that, if, when you were little, you had not obeyed my most

But I will not beleeue, that our friendship shall haue need of testimonies. God keepe you, and increase your patrimonie. And be assured I will hold you as

deare, and beare you the same affection, that was borne you by your owne Father. Farewell.

But I doe otherwise then I did at first make shew of. I said I would not write you mine opinion; yet I am entred vpon the particulars thereof.

If it were true, Curio, that you had such obligations to me, as you publikely speake of, which I hold nothing; I would with more respect seeke after you, when I should haue occasion to aske any thing of you. Because a modest man shunneth, as much as is

possible, to entreat a fauour from him, to whom he thinkes hee hath done any kindnesse; lest that, in place of a request, hee should seeme to receiue as a dutie, that which hee demandeth; and to take it rather for payment, then a benefit.

I spake vnto you hereof, at Rome, no wayes supposing, you should this yeere haue beene Tribune. And the same suit I often renewed by letters: but, then I sought your fauour, as a noble Senator, and a young Gentle-man generally beloued. Now I importune it, as from a Tribune of the people, nay, as from Curio the Tribune. I pray therfore be pleas'd, to vse all meanes, not of comming to new consultation, which ordinarily is the more

For now at length he holds that those are good, and those bad Cittizens, that we were wont to hold so. I stayed in Athens ten whole dayes, where our good friend Gallus Caninius kept me alwayes companie. Vpon this present, being the sixt of Iulie, I am to depart.

               THE great rumors, which, (as I heard) fell out in Rome, on the festiuall dayes of the goddesse Minerua, by reason of speeches made vnto the people; keepe my minde I assure you, in continuall trouble, because I could neuer heare further of it: and yet that which most grieues me is, that among these sturres, if there be any thing worthie of laughter, I cannot make my selfe merrie with you: for I well know, there are many [th

               WHEN I heard the wished newes, of your being elected my Quaestor, I was in hope, that from thence, so much the greater contentment should redound vnto me, by how much the longer you were like to continue with me in the Prouince: and it was very necessarie, that to the neare tye of amitie, by which fortune hath linked vs, familiar conuersation should also be annexed. Afterwards, because neither your selfe, nor any other wrote vnto me of your comming, I doubted (as still I doe) least I should depart from the Prouince, before you ariued there: I since receiued your letters, written with singular humanitie, which were deliuer'd me, the xxii. of Iune in Cilicia, where I was with the Armie.

You could not haue sent me a man that was more my friend, neither as I thinke more wise and discreete, to informe me of such matters, as I desired to vnderstand.

First therefore, I thanke you for so courteous an office, then I engage my faithfull promise vnto you, that with all endeuour and zeale, I will euer labour, that first your selfe, and all your friends, and others a

Then will I take my course towards the armie; so that in the middest of September, I make accompt to be at Iconium. But if I mistake my selfe in writing, (for I know not what may happen) whensoeuer I set forwards you shall be aduertised of my iournies from day to day, with all possible expedition, and diligence. I neither dare, nor willingly will impose vpon you any burden, but if it may be with your conueniencie, it greatly imports vs both, that we should meete, before you leaue the Prouince. If any euill hap, preuent this our interuiew, yet notwithstanding in the gouernment

of this Prouince, I will haue no lesse care of your honour, and reputation, then if I had seene you. I will not write vnto you, that you should performe any thing on my behalfe, till I be out of hope, of meeting you. Whereas you write, that you requested Scaeuola, during your absence, to gouerne the Prouince till my arriuall; I saw him in Ephesus, and he kept me company for those three dayes, that I stayed there, but he spake not a word, of your moouing him to any such matter. I would he could, for I cannot be perswaded, that he would not haue serued you. Farewell.

                     •

                     •
                  were thereunto implies. In doing this, I haue, as I suppose, discharg'd

my part, neither could I shew any greater kindnesse. Now with this, compare what you haue done. You did not onely not come thither, where you might with the soonest haue had sight of me. but you remooued into those parts, where I could not possibly arriue, within the terme of those thirty daies, which were assigned you, for your departure, as I suppose, by the law Cornelia. So that it seemed vnto them, who were not acquainted with our mutuall affections, that you seeke to auoid our meeting; and consequently (to say no worse) that you were but a cold friend vnto me: but on the other side, they iudge, me most louing to you. And in deed, before I came into the Prouince I receiued your letters, in which, though you certified me, of your going to Tarsus, neuerthelesse you gaue me assured hope of our meeting. Yet some persons afterwards, and as I beleeue, malicious (for many at this day are possest with that vice) hauing fit matter to talke of, and being no waies acquainted with the stabilitie of my mind, laboured to alienate me from your friendship, alledging vnto me, that you had some interest in Tarsus, that you establish't, and perform'd many things; whereas, you might haue considered, that when I was entred into the Prouince, it belonged not to you, further to gouerne it.

Which neither they were euer wont to doe, that within a short time expected the arriuall of their Successor. But these mens wordes neuer troubled me; rather, being true, I was beholding to you, for you eased me herein, of a part of my burthen; and I reioyced, that whereas the imployment of my gouernment was to continue for a whole yeare, which I thought ouer-long, I was by your means eased, of a moneths labour and trauaile. One thing, (to speake truth) displeaseth me, that, of those few souldiers, which remain'd in the Prouince, there wanted no lesse then three Cohorts, which were more entire then the rest; and,

But questionlesse, when, or where I may see you, except you certifie me by writing, I cannot so much as imagine. For that which belongs to me; both good, and bad shall apparently see, that my mind is as friendly addicted to loue you, as possiblie it can be. For yours, you haue giuen ill disposed men some occasion to surmise the contrary; doe but reclaime this errour, and I will hold you most deare vnto me. And because you might consider, or cast where we may meete, without the breach of the Cornelian law; I arriued in my Prouince on the last of Iuly: I goe into Ci

                  le write more at large; I wrote these in great hast, Brutus seruants being to depart for Rome without any stay;

so as, I had no time to write to any bodie else but to you, and Brutus. The Appian Legates, brought me, I cannot say a letter, but rather an entire volume, full of vniust complaints, because by my letters, I hindred their building. In the same epistle you intreated me, forthwith to giue them licēce to build, before the winter came vpō them: & withal, checking me couertly, you cōplained that I prohibited them, to collect the tribute: before my selfe, made acquainted with the matter, had giuen licence; you affirming that this was but a kind of crossing their courses; in that I could not informe me of this matter before the winter, after my returne out of Cilicia
                  
                     •
                   Now, conceiue rightly, whether you haue any cause to complaine of me. Diuers parties came crying out, and saying, They were grieuously exacted vpon, through the paying of intollerable tributes. I wrote, that nothing should be done therein, before I had well examin'd the matter: can any man say this was iniustice? Oh, but you'le tell me I could not be inform'd thereof before the winter: I grant it: but should I goe seeke my informations from them, or they come to me? What you'le say, so farre off? When you wrot vnto me that I should permit them to build before Winter: suppos'd you not that they were to come where I was? though in

deed, they committed an absurditie, worthie of derision. For, they sent me the letters when winter was almost

                  nded, importing a suit, that they might finish their worke in the Sommer that was past: but know, howsoeuer, I am readie to obserue your pleasure; although, they are far more in number, that refuse to pay such tributes, then those, that are therewith contented. Concerning the Appians this may suffice. Pausania, Lentulus free-man, and an officer of mine, tels me, that to him you seem'd offended, that I met you not. Did I this, thinke you, out of any disesteeme of you, and because I am the proudest man in the world? A man of yo
                     •
                  rs, came after midnight, and informed me, that you would be at Iconium before daie. When, being two seuerall waies, and not knowing by which you might haue come, I sent Varro, a familiar acquaintance of yours, one way, and Quintus Lepta, chiefe of the ingeniers of mine armie another: enioyning both of them, to come post before, that I might goe out to meere you: Lepta came running and told me, how you were gone beyond the armie: I came presently to Iconium. How the matter went afterwards you know: why should not I come and meete you? First being Appius Claudius, then being Appius Imperator. Moreouer, it being the custome

of our predecessors? and, which is of greater importance, you being my friend? especially, I hauing euer beene, more obseruant in such offices, then euer stood with mine honour and condition. But no more of this. The same Pausanius told me further; how you complained of me in these words: did Appius meete Lentulus, did Lentulus the like to Appius, and would not Cicero vouchsafe, to come and meete Appius? How comes it to passe? that you being a man, in my iudgement, of singular learning, and wisedome, greatly experienced in worldly affaires; and further, endewed with a pleasing affabilitie; which is a vertue, as the Stoicks deseruedly hold opinion; I say, how can it be then, that you should be carried away with these fopperies, supposing that either Appius, or Lentulus for their nobilitie, should be highlier esteemed of me, then the ornaments of vertue? Though I had not past those honours, which in vulgar esteeme, are glorious, yet could not I admire these your names: I rather valued those men highly, which left them vnto you. But after I was with much honour, elected to many offices of gouernments of great qualitie, wherein I bare my selfe so approuedly, that I cou
                     •
                  d not wish greater reputation, or glory [then was giuen me]; I neuer reputed my selfe your

superiour; but alwayes your equall. Nor could I see, that euer Cneius Pompeius, whom I prefer before all others, or Publius Lentulus, to whom I giue place, retain'd any other opinion. If you thinke otherwise, it would not be much amisse, (the better to vnderstand what Gentilitie or Nobilitie is) to consider a little, what Athenadorus son to Sandon, writes thereo

But to returne to our first purpose, beleeue most assuredly, that I am not onely your friend, but your most entire affectionate, and in all manner of proofe, I will contend, to possesse you of so much. But if you seeke occasions, that you may seeme not to be, so much obliged to labour aswell for me, as I haue laboured for you, from this time forward I free you of this trouble. I shall questionlesse finde out other Counsellers, or at least Ioue shall be my guide. If also your inclination be such, that you affect to conte

                  re now the twatling of these malignant people of the prouince, is somewhat cooled; yet you hauing written so copiously to mee touching their sinister relations, I thought it fit, brieflie to answer you. But I will not rip vp a new, the two first heads of your letter, because they comprehend no absolute, nor determinate points; except this, that in the place where matters are scand, and at some feasts, it was obseru'd by many externall signes, that I am not your friend. This, is as much as nothing; and being nothing, neither can I conceiue what these words of yours import; sure I am, that this might truely be spoken vnto you; that both on the seate of Iustice, and in priuate places, I haue many times vttered honorable and worthie reports of you, giuing manifest testimonie, of our familiar, and domesticall Amitie. And

as for the Legates, could I haue wrought more iustlie or equallie, then to ease poore Citties of a burthensome charge, without diminishing a whit of your reputation, especially being with great instance sollicited thereunto by the Cities themselues? For I heard nothing, that these 
                     •
                  mbassies went to Rome in your Honour. When I was in Apamea, the principalls of diuers Cities came & told me, that the ordina
                     •
                  ie charge of Embassies were so great, that the cities were not able to defray them. Then, I cast many things in my minde: First, I could not bee perswaded that you, who are not onely wise, but as the report now goes, a noble minded man, should be delighted in these Embassies: and as I remember once in Synnadis, vpon the publique Tribunall I spake much thereof; alledging in the first place, how Appius Clodius, without further testimonie from the Myndensians (for that City was then mentioned) was knowne by the Senate, and by the people of Ro
                        •
                     e: and moreouer, that I had obseru'd at other times, that the Legates that came to praise any man, neuer obtain'd audience of the Senate. And finally I concluded, that their good enclination lik't me wel, because they shewed themselues thankfull to you, who had bene fitt
                     •
                  d them; but that I thought this

course no wayes necessarie: and if needes they would demonstrate their good affection, I should haue thought well of it, if some one had done it of his owne charge: And haue granted it; so that the expence had beene reasonable; but not, if exorbitant. You cannot therefore in any reason, take this ill at my hands: except, (as you adde) that mine edict had beene past, vpon purpose, to crosse these legations; as some were of opinion. Now, in my iudgement, they beare not themselues so ill, who doe such bad offices, as they, 
                     •

                     •
                  nd an eare vnto them. While I was yet in Rome I drew the edict; afterwards, I annexed thereunto but one clause, which I tooke out of yours: and this at the importunity of the Tole-masters, who came to Samos to me, for this purpose; and touching the disburthening of the Cities of their charge, I wrote that article with speciall care
                     •
                   and I annexed thereunto some new conditions, which gaue me good satisfaction; being so beneficiall to the Cities, as if I had herein restored to them their liues. But this poynt, which occasion'd all the suspition, that I went about to wrong you; is an ordinarie thing, put in practice by others before my selfe. And I could not be so foolish to imagine, that the Embassadours came to Rome for any priuate occasion;

as being sent, not to giue thankes to a priuate man, but vnto you; not for particular interests, but publique; and in an assembly not priuate, but generall to the world, that is, in the open Senate. Neither when I interposed this

                     , where I was with the Armie. And that clause in your letters well deserues laughter. For, see

                  ies. In that it might iustly be feared, that by reason of vnnecessarie

disbursements, things might haue beene brought to that passe, that it had beene needfull to sell the tributes, and to haue layd an imposition, of so much by the powle, or by the house; which, as you know, would haue beene a very hard matter. And I being ca

or at least, as soone as you had seene your friends, you vnderstood of them my perpetuall loue and affection towards you, manifesting it selfe, vpon all occurrents, while you stay'd in your Prouince: wherefore imagine, how neere my heart those words went, you wrote vnto me
                     •
                   If any thing fall out for my aduancement and dignity, though it be vnpossible, yet render me equall kindnesse. This, you may easily doe; for, what is there in this world, which endeauour will not compasse? Neither can any attempt be so difficult, but a true affection may ouercome it. I euer thought, & so my friends write, that you should obtaine a Triumph, but yet I am exceedingly satisfied in the certainty you giue me thereof; and not bec

                  use I hope my selfe as easily to get it; (for this were but an Epicurean part) but in that your honour and dignity is of it selfe most deere vnto me. Seeing therefore, you haue greater conueniencie of messengers, then any other; for none would come hither, without giuing you notice; when my suit hath gotten that successe, which you expect, and I desire, I should bee very glad, to be therof aduertised. If through those long Sessions of the Senate, as our friend Pompeius was wont to terme them, you are delayed a day or two, (for there is no likely-hood it shall bee

longer,) your dignity will no wayes be impeach't by this deferring. But for the loue you beare mee, and for that, that you expect from mee. Vouchsafe to cheere me vp, with this acceptable information, and 
                     •
                  emember to keep promise with me about the present, which you promised to make mee. For besides, that I am desirous of the Science of Auguration; any gifts of yours infinitely please me, they being an apparant testimony of the loue you beare me. And because you demand some equall remuneration, I must ruminate well vpon it, that I may make you the like requitall: For, if I should not take the paines in this, that vsually I doe in my other compositions, which you are wont to thinke worthy of admiration. You might haue iust cause, to repute me not onely negligent, but vnthankfull. And of these matters enough. Further now, my desire is, that you bring to effect the offer which you made me; my meaning is, that you labor by all means possible, to compasse me my suites; vsing therein your wonted diligence, that the Senate may pleasure mee, and out of hand, with the honourablest demonstrations that may be. You promis'd it me; see you doe not faile: and doe it likewise, for the sake of our ancient am
                     •
                  tie. I doubt, I haue ouer-long deferred my writing thereof to the Senate,

and that my letters
                     •
                   through difficult passage by sea, came in time of the vacations. But herein I followed your example; and I thinke I did well, in not writing so suddenly after my being called Imperator, but after the end of many enterprizes, brought to passe in all this summer. Be therefore carefull of this, according to your promise; and so in all other occasions, vouchsafe to take my affaires, my selfe, and all mine, into your friendly protection. Farewell.

And many reasons perswaded me to think, that this trouble would rather augment, then extenuate your honor. It vext me much, that enuious men had found out a meanes, to depriue you of the glory of your Triumph, which questionlesse

you should haue obtained, conformable to your deserts. Of which losse, if you make the same reckoning, that I euer esteemed should be made; you shall do wisely, & triumph at last in the sorrow of your enemies. For I know you to be so strong in friends, and so prudent, that vndoubtedly it will greatly grieue them, that euer they run into such a leuity. For mine own part, I assure & promise you, calling all the gods to witnesse of my heart, that for your dignitie, (for so I will rather terme i

Command mee, and expect at my hand all [good] offices, for my endeuours shall surmount your imagination.

discern'd it by some other way, as no doubt but you shall. But seeing such an occasion is offered, if euer I faile in any thing, let me be reputed a dishonourable, and very bad man. Pontinius whom I know to be much bo

Hee was gone to Ephesus, vpon businesse of his owne, of no small importance, but when hee heard of this accident of yours, he presently returned to Laodicea. I knowing that you shall haue a number of such men to fauour you; I make no doubt but this present crosse will redound to your greatnes. But if you obtaine to bee Censor, and discharge the Censorship, as you ought, and can: I plainely discerne, that you will not be a perpetuall and firme defence to your selfe only, but to all your well willers also. Well, labour what you can, that there may be no prorogation of my office; that when we haue procured you all satisfaction from hence; we may also stand you in some steed there, if any thing happen wherein I may pleasure, or

also because by this I see, there is some esteeme made in our Cittie of valour and worth: which reward I alwaies receiued, in paiment of my trauell and paines. But me thought it verie strange, this young man should bee so rash and headstrong, to incurre your enmitie, without all regard of me; whom with singular endeauour, I defended twice in capitall causes: especiallie you being back't with manie qualities, and assistances, that to himselfe are wanting, for I'le speake no worse of him: and these words that slipt from him like a childe, and a foole as hee was; were first certified me in writing by my friend Marcus Coelius, and of the same, you haue also written to mee at large.

For now, 'tis no time for me to complaine. But tell me now? when prohibited I any embassie from comming to Rome, in your praise? see you not how I could haue done nothing of lesse preiudice to you then

this, if I had profest open hatred to you? And againe, in case I meant closelie to malice you, I could haue vndertaken no action, would more haue laid me open then this. Were I as persidious, as they that report this of me, I had not beene so palpably foolish, to breake out suddainly with you into so great enmitie; especiallie in a matter, wherein I might well discouer my desire, but that in effect I could no waies offend you. I remember diuers came and told me, that the rated charge of Embassies, farre exceeded the vsuall proportion; whom I did not enioyne to any thing, but onely said, I thought it fit, that the charge thereof, should mount no higher then was determin'd by the law Cornelia: And in this likewise, I referred my selfe to their pleasure; as the accompts of the Citie can testifie: by which it appeares, that the charge was such, as themselues thought good to be at; but, bad men haue striuen to peruert truth with a thousand lies; giuing you to vnderstand, that prouisions were not onely taken from those Embassadors, who were going to Rome, but were redemanded, and caus'd to be restor'd by their Agents, who were alreadie departed, and that this was the cause that many forbare comming to Rome. I could finde in my heart to bee verie

plaine with you, were it not, (as before I told you) that my meaning is, as reason requires; onely to iustifie my selfe, and not accuse you; no waies to aggrauate your minde, which is alreadie sufficiently disturbed. So that I condemne you not for beleeuing these mens words: but 'Ile not spare to set downe some reasons, why you should not haue beleeued them.

conclusion with what patience, with what humanitie, did hee once endure me to touch him to the quicke, in the defence which I made for Milo? with what a singular care prouided hee, that I might not runne into any popular disgrace, protecting me with his Councell, Authoritie, and in a word, with armes? at which time hee shewed, that magnanimitie, and grauitie, as hee would neuer beleeue the words, I will not say of a Phrygian, or a Lycaonian, as you did in the matter of Embassies; but of many great men, who spake ill vnto him of me. Now his sonne, being your sonne in law; and besides the respect of affinitie, I vnderstanding how deere, and acceptable you are to Pompeius: how ought I thinke you to bee affected towards you? especially hee hauing written vnto mee such letters, that if I were as great an enemie to you, as I am a friend, yet would I bee pacified, and suffer my selfe wholly to be directed, not onely by the will, but by the leaft winke, or becke of so great a benefactor. But of these matters let this suffice: and I feare I haue beene longer then peraduenture was requisite. You shall see, what I haue partly performed, and partly set on foote in your behalfe; the which I doe, and will vndertake, rather for your honour, then for any great danger, or doubt

I am glad, you haue two kinsmen so louing and noble: the one neither hath, or euer had in all the world his like; and the other hath now a long time enioy'd the chiefest place among the yong men of this Cittie; and shortly also, as I hope, shall carrie it from them, that in yeares farre exceed, and goe before him. Concerning the corrupted witnesses, if Flaccus cause not their infamie to be publickely proclaim'd in their seuerall Citties; when I passe through Asia, it shall be done.

                     •
                  phold her. For I know that both in, and after your Consulship, you affected nothing but peace. Foreseeing the euill that was to ensue. And though I commended your iudgement, and was of the same opinion my selfe; yet could I neuer procure the atonement of ciuill dis

                   For I came late; I was alone; and, as it seemed, but weakely informed of the cause. And finally, I found my forces vnable to alter their stubborne min
                     •
                  es, that desired warre. Now, seeing we are out of hope to assist the Common-wealth, if we may take some course for the safetie of our owne liues, not to maintaine any forme of our auncient state, but to mourne for the Common-wealth, so far as any wayes may stand with our reputation, I would rather consult with you then any other person in the world whatsoeuer. For I know you rich in the treasure of all learning, and deepely read in all auncient, and moderne histories. And know, that I had formerly written to you, that your going into the Senate, or rather, into the assembly of Senators, would

be to small purpos
                     •
                  , but that I was affraid to offend him, who (as you may conceiue) would haue taken it very ill, that I should di

                  swade your residence in Rome; when he so instantly requested me to doe as your selfe did. To whom, when he intreated me, that I would returne into the Senate, I answered: that I would say as you said, about the peace, or our going into Spaine. You see on what termes we stand: our Empire is diuided: warre is kindled in euerie quarter: Rome is abandoned, and expos'd to combustion: the lawes, iudgement, and finally all good customes are supprest. Whereupon, so farre I am from hoping after better, that I know not what I may presume to desire. But if it seeme good to your wisedome, that we consult together, though I resolu'd to remoue further off from Rome, then now I am, whose very name I cannot heare spoken without extreme griefe: yet I will come nearer hand. I haue bidden Trebatius, that, if at any time, you would send him to speake to me, he refuse not this endeuour: the which I pray doe: or else, you may if you please send some one of your owne people, whom you most t

                  usion of things is such, and the ruine so great, which this most wicked warre hath wrought: that euery man deemes himselfe vnhappie wheresoeuer: therefore you repent you of your owne opinion, and we at home, seeme happie men vnto you. But cleane contrarie, wee heere iudge you, not altogether to bee free from molestations; but in respect of our selues, fortunate, or blessed. And were it but in this, your condition is farre better then ours; for you may securely write the occasions of your griefe, which wee cannot doe, without danger: not through any vice of the Conqueror, who cannot possiblie be more clement, but in respect of the victorie it selfe, which in ciuill wars, is alwaies insolent. In one thing wee haue exceeded you, because a little before your selfe, we saw the grace, which Caesar did to Marcellus your Colleague, and withall, in that I beheld, how the matter was carried. For I may truely affirme vnto you, that since these miseries, that is, since that time that men began to striue for the Empire of Rome by armes, there hath passed nothing in

the Senate, with the dignitie of the common-wealth. For Eucius Piso making mention of Marcus Marcellus; and Caius Marc

me the question, whether you must remaine still in your Prouince, or depart. Hitherto my opinion is, that we dispose of our selues to Caesars will.

But the estate of the Common-wealth, is such, that you would rather desire to heare of it, then see it. This I speake against mine owne minde; because I desire to see you in R

And yet sometimes I am so ouerwhelmed with sorrow, that I can scarcely support it; wanting those comforts, which others in the like Fortunes fail'd not of, whose example I propound vnto my selfe.

               Cicero to Marcus Marcellus. Epist. 7.
               
               THough I will not presume to reprehend the courses, which hitherto you haue taken; not because I am likewise of the same opinion: but in that I repute you so wise, that I will not take vpon me to prefer mine own iudgment before yours: yet for our ancient loues

sake, and for the infinite good will, you haue borne me, from your child-hood, I could not but impart that vnto you, which I iudge most profitable for your life, without any preiudice to your honour, or reputation. I remember full well, you are the man, which in your Consulship performed wonderfull matters: I likewise call to minde, that you neuer approu'd, that a ciuill war should bee made in such forme and manner, as it hath beene. Neither did you euer like of Pompeyes Armie. And you alwayes fear'd the perils, which since haue hapned, as also you cannot forget, that my selfe was euen of the same opinion. And therefore, as you would be present in the war, but a small time: so I vsed all the meanes I could, to keepe from thence, because there was no fighting with counsell, authoritie, or cause, which were things wherein we excelled: but the buckling was by force and hand-blowes, wherein we were not equall: and therefore wee were vanquished; and if not vanquish't, (for it seemes, that a iust and honest cause can neuer be ouercome) at least, wee were disturbed, & discomfited. Wherin, not only your counsel is by euery man to be commended, in that together with the hope of victory, you gaue ouer your desire of fighting: giuing in this to vnderstand, that euery wise & good Citizen,

as he enters into a ciuill war against his will, so doth he as vnwillingly perseuere in the same, till it bee ended. I see that those, who followed not your aduise, are diuided into two sorts: For some of them, did what they could, to renew the war in Africa: And othersome haue cast thems

If you say, you meant to liue at Rome, because you would haue enioy'd your substance, and retain'd your dignitie: I will answere, that out of your vertue, you ought to haue contemn'd your owne respects, and to haue no other obiect, but the Common-wealth. Withall, what will the effect of your opinion be? For hitherto, your resolution is not onely commended; but considering the matter, your good Fortune also: your resolution; because necessitie draue you to a ciuill warre, and your wisedome retir'd you from the issue of it: your Fortune; by reason that in an honorable vacancie, you prese

minde, in not humbling your selfe to the Conquerour; take heed you be not censured proud, in refusing his courtesie. And if we repute him wise, that flies farre off, from his countries oppression; sometimes it is likewise esteem'd but wilfulnesse, not to affect it: and if we are denied to enioy publicke fortunes, yet let's make much of that, we are permitted to enioy priuatly. To conclude, I say, that if you thinke that you liue there more commodiously: yet ought you to consider, that you rest not peraduenture in any great securitie.

The Athenians would not grant me a place within the Citie where to burie him: For they excus'd themselues that they were prohibited by their religion, neither had they granted the like to any before; but they were content he should be buried, in any publique Schoole we best liked.

               Cicero to Publius Nigidius Figulus. Epist. 13.
               
               THE reason why I haue not written to you of long time, is first because I had no certaine subiect whereof to write; and secondly, because I could not vse those kinde of letters, which are ordinarie. For Fortune hath so taken from vs all kinde of cheerefull argument; that wee cannot onely not write, but not so much as thinke of any ioyfull matters. There remaines a kinde of writing, that's miserable and lamentable, and com

                     •
                   I liue: for

though I haue not particularly receiu'd any notorious iniurie by Fortune: and Caesar, without attending my supplication, hath conferred vpon mee, many reall fauours: yet haue I inwardly such discontentment, that mee thinkes I si

                  uously in remaining aliue. For many of my familiar friends are by death taken away, and diuers for feare of the victor, are fled into sundrie countries. And, of all those friends, which ioyned with me, and you, in defence of the Common-wealth, I haue not one that suruiueth: and I am enforst to behold the ruine and rapine of their goods: neither do I onely heare, but to my extreame hea

                  t griefe I see, their substance ill dispos'd of, by whose ayde wee heeretofore extinguished the flames of the Common-wealth. And where wee had before, fauours, authoritie, and great glorie; now wee 
                     •
                  inde no such matter: true it is, that wee enioy the grace and fauour of Caesar himselfe: but that can not preuaile, aboue the violent mutation of all things, and of the times. Being therefore de
                     •
                  titute of whatsoeuer I was accustomed vnto by nature, enclination, and vse; I am distastfull not onely to others, as I vnderstand, but to my selfe also. For being borne, to haue alwaies somewhat a foot, beseeming a man; now, I want not onely the meanes of employment,

but euen to ruminate, how I might helpe any one: And whereas before, I was able to pleasure persons ignoble, yea, and the guiltie; now, to Publius Nigidius my deare friend, who heretofore was so highly honor'd, and who excells all men, both for learning, and pietie; I cannot so much as offer my assistance. It therefore re
                     •
                  aines, that I labour to comfort you, and remo
                     •
                  e from you with liuely reasons, that griefe which oppresseth your minde. But if any man be of true force to comfort, either you or any other, it is your selfe: whereupon, I will not touch that point, which containes in it learned, and exquisite reasons; But I will leaue it absolutely to your selfe. Obserue you, that, which is requisite for a valiant, and wise man, exacted at your hands by your grauitie, height of spirit, life past, the studies, and Sciences, which you euer prosecuted with singular commendation. I'le deliuer vnto you, what I can know, remaining in Rome, and therunto bending my minde, as I doe. I therefore affirme vnto you, that you shall not long dwell in these molestations, wherein at this present you are inuolued; but in those which also oppresse vs, I feare, you will euer continue. First of all I conceiue, that hee which beares all the sway, hath a very good opinion of you. This I write

not without good ground. The lesse familiar I am with him, the more diligently I diue into his disposition. And therefore be secure, that he delaies your restitution for no other reason, but because hee would haue so much the iuster occasion, to denie their suits with whom hee is displeased. Besides, all his friends, I meane those in greatest opinion with him, stand greatly affected to your vertues, whereunto may bee added the peoples fauour vnto you, yea, and of all Rome besides. And moreouer the Common-wealth, which, to tell truth; at this instant, is but weake, (but of necessitie it must recouer it former abilitie) with the same strength it shall haue, will constraine her gouernours, to restore you to your countrie. I said in the beginning, that I could not offer you my endeauour, and yet now I'le presume to offer you it: for I will seeke by all ceremoniall obseruance, to gaine, and binde vnto me Caesars friends, who loue me well, and spend much time with me; and by all artificiall meanes, I will studie to insinuate my selfe into Caesars amitie; which hitherto hath beene denied me, through my ouer respectiue nature. In conclusion, take my faithfull promise, that I will leaue no waies vnattempted, by which I may thinke to compasse our ends: And in this I'le doe much more, then I

dare to write. In all other occurrents command me, for you shall see mee exceed the loue of all your other friends and kindred. I haue nothing in the world, which you may not esteeme as well yours as mine owne; But of this I'le dilate no further, being desirous that you should hope rather to helpe your selfe with your owne; as I hope you shall. Nothing remaines, but to exhort, and intreate you, that you would arme your minde against Fortune: and remember not onely those things which you haue learned of other g

                  eat men, but also those which haue proceeded from your owne studie, and vnderstanding. Which doing, you shall relie on good hopes: and with fortitude ouercome any aduerse accident. But who is better acquainted with these reasons, then your selfe? I will enterprise any thing, whereby I may yeeld you assistance: and I will pr

Whereas you reioyce for my new marriage, I know assuredly, that you affect my repose & quiet: but I had neuer taken any new course, in these so lamentable times, but that, at my returne I found mine owne estate, in as bad termes as the Common-wealth: For I was not secure vnder mine owne roofe: my whole house was full of entrappings and snares; I found gins laid euery where for me, euen by those, who for my singular benefits, should rather haue had a tender care, of my goods, and safetie. Whereupon I thought, by the trust of a new affinitie, to secure my selfe, from the perfidious practises of the olde: But enough hath beene said, concerning our affaires, and more peraduenture, then was requisite. As for yours, take a good heart, and feare no particular contrarietie: For ouercome who will, I see not how you runne into any great danger: Caesar, hauing alreadie as far I can conceiue, asswaged his anger towardes you; and the Pompeians hauing neuer

                     •
                  rdon me; For, no man can loue the Common-wealth, better then my selfe: but if I defended my reputation, from his violent passion towards mee; i
                     •
                   may suffice you, that I neuer complained to you, of the iniury hee did m
                     •
                  e: who, because I knew, that he prepared, and disposed the whole power of his Tribuneship to my destruction: I besought Claudia your wife, and Mucia your sister, whose good opinion towards me, I discouered in many things, for the

amities sake betwixt me and Pompeius, that they would diuert him from so wicked a determination. But hee, notwithstanding I had been Consul, & had preserued the Commonwealth, did me such an iniury, as was neuer offred to any Magistrate, of what mean rank soeuer; nor to the worst Citizen. For, at the last of December, as peraduenture you haue heard, he prohibited me, in the resignation of my Consulship, to giue account vnto the people of my proceedings: which iniurie notwithstanding, at last redounded to my great honour. For, hee permitting me no further intimation, then mine oath; I swore aloud, and the people with a loud voyce, and to my great glory, swore likewise, that mine oath was most true. Hauing receiued this grosse disgrace; yet the same day, I sent to Metellus, those that were friends to vs both; requesting him to remoue that resolution, he had vndertaken against me; To whom he made answer, That it was not in his power: because, speaking to the people, he had formerly implyed, that there was no reason, that he should haue authoritie giuen him to speake, who would not grant the same to others, but had punished them, without permitting them lawfull plea. Oh, what a graue Gentle-man, and braue Citizen was this! who, though I had deliuered the

Senate from death, Rome from combustion, and Italy from war, thought mee worthy of that punishment, which the Senate, out of the consent of all good men, had inflicted vpon them, who meant to set Rome on fire; hew the Magistrates & Senators in peeces; and to haue rais'd vp, a most bloudy or cruell war. Vpon this, I oppos'd my selfe to your brother, who was present. For, the first of Ianuary, I so buckeld with him in the occasions of the Common-wealth, as hee might perceiue, I wanted neither courage, nor constancie. And afterwards on the third of the same moneth, hee hauing conuocated the people, in the beginning of his Oration, he went about to depraue mee, naming, and threatning me euery third word, with full resolution, vtterly to sinke mee; not by way of Iustice, or equitie, but by bitter violence, and passionate outrage. Whose temeritie, if I had not stou
                     •
                  ly withstood; who would not haue thought, that in my Consulship, I shewed resolution, rather out of the benefit of my Fortunes, then either for vertue, or fortitude of mind: If you neu
                     •
                  r perceiu'd how ill Metellus stood affected to mee; this may bee an euident signe, that he little esteemes you; neuer writing vnto you, of a matter of so great importāce. But if he did impart his minde vnto you, you sho

                  ld thinke

me very milde, and tractable, in that I neuer complain'd therof to you, though I had all the reasons [in the world] to doe it. For, not onely in words, as yo
                     •
                   write, but with all manner of iniuries, he labour'd to persecute me. Now, obserue my humanitie, if it may be termed humanitie, when a man does not onely suppresse the choler of his mind
                     •
                   but further humbleth himself, to his enemie. I, though your brother had shamefully iniuried me, yet neuer shew'd my 
                     •
                  elfe to him, otherwise then fauorable. And, whensoeuer his name came in question in the Senate; I alwaies ioyn'd with them in opinion, that proceeded mildly with him. Neither content with this; although hee were mine enemie: yet in that hee was your brother. it did not onely displease mee, but further, I wrought by al my means, and power, that the decree enacted against him, might be cancell'd. So, as I oppos'd not your brother; but I haue resisted your brother, neither was I towards you, mutable, as you write; but so constant, that I haue perseuer'd in louing you, though you gaue me occasion to the contrarie. As also at this present, though you write to mee after a threatning manner, yet will I not complaine. Because I doe not onely pardon, but highly commend your passion 
                     〈◊〉
                   naturall affection intimating

in this, of what force brotherly loue is. But yet I entreat you, that you will also truely waigh my passion; allowing, that if your friends did bitterly, and with cruelty, persecute me without cause; I ought in this case, nor onely, not to giue them place, but make my repai

I euer desir'd to haue you my friend, as likewise, I haue omitted no endeauour, whereby it might appeare, that I was not your friend onely, but your most louing friend.

'Tis told me, that a seruant of yours, is run from you, and that now, he is amongst the Vardaei, whereof you wrote nothing to me; notwithstanding I haue commaunded him to be searcht for, by sea and land; and I'le finde him you out howsoeuer, except he be fled into Dalmatia: from whence I'le fetch him too, at last. Loue me and Farewell. In the Campe at Narona, this xiij. of Iulie.

               I Wonder not, though you accept so well of mine offices, hauing euer knowne you amongst others, for a most thankfull man: and I neuer forbare to publish it. For I haue not onely receiued thankes from you; but haue beene also plentifully requited. Wherupon in all your other occasions, you shall finde mee ready to pleasure you. Wheras you commend vnto me, Pompeia, your wife, a most noble Gentlewoman: hauing perused your letters, I presently spake with our friend, Sura, to tell her in my behalfe, that she should make me acquainted, what shee stood in need of; for I would willingly pleasure her. And I promise you to doe it, and if it be needfull, I'le goe in person to visit her. Neuerthelesse, I would that you should write vnto her, that she will esteeme nothing so great, or so trifling, that I shall thinke either too difficult, or vnbeseeming me. Whatsoeuer I can doe for you, will seeme easie, and conformable to my dignitie. If you wish mee well, procure that Dionysius may returne. Whatsoeuer you promise him, I'le performe: but if he will needs be a knaue, you shall lead him prisoner

in triumph. I beshrew these Dalmatians, that put you to so much trouble. But, as you write, in short time you will bring them in, and they will illustrate your victories. For they were euer reputed warlike. Farewell.

                   you would be pleased to celebrate my name, with the publication of your compositions: the which, though many times you told me, you would doe; yet I would haue you pardon mee, though I solicite you thereunto: For the 
                     •
                  orme of your writing, which I euer thought would bee excellent, goes beyond my expectation, and hath so won mee, that I am surprized with an exceeding desire, that my acts atchieud, may be written with your pen. Because I doe no

                   onely hope, that death it selfe shall not

                  xtinguish the memoriall of my

name; but further, in life I desire to enioy that reputation, which may accrew vnto me by your testimony; and to taste that sweetnesse, which I shall finde, seeing my selfe to be praised, and beloued, by one of your qualitie. And though I know how much you are employed: neuerthelesse, in that I see, you haue now finished the historie of the Italian, and ciuill warre: and you told me you pro
                     •
                  ected the rest; I would not omit for mine own sake, to admonish you, that you would bethink your selfe, whether you would connex our proceedings with others; or else to doe, as many Graecians haue done, Calistines the Troian war; Timaeus that of Pyrrhus; and Polybius the warre of Numantia: all which, diuided the foresaid wars; so you also might separate the ciuill conspiracie, from the wars externall. I see not certainely, that it greatly imports my commendation; yet respecting my great desire, surely it imports, that you doe not obserue the order of times, but that you rather anticipate, & first make mention of my actions. And withall, if you employ your wit vpon one subiect onely, and about one person; me thinkes I foresee, how much more copious and more adorned, the discourse wil proue in euery part. Neither am I so barren of vnderstanding, but that I perceiue, how impudent I am; First, in imposing

vpon you such a burden (which, in respect of your imployments, you might well refuse:) and then, to importune you, that you would commend me; in that you may thinke peraduenture I deserue it not. But hauing once begun to exceed the bounds of modestie, wee must absolutely laie aside all bashfulnesse. And therefore I request you earnestly, to set forth mine actions, and that with greater lustre, then peraduenture, you iudge to stand with their merit: and that you will not tye your selfe to the lawes of Historie, but to the desert of our friendship: which, I desire, should preuaile further with you in this; then truth. And because heretofore, you wrote, in a certaine Proeme, and indeed ingeniously, that euen as that Hercules in Xenophon, would not be mou'd a whit at the allurement of pleasures: so no respect of amitie should stir you. Now, 
                     •
                  or my contentment, I would haue you alter your minde, and in regard of our loue, that you would applie your selfe, to satisfie me in this request. And if (as I d

that [instant] when I return'd from banishment; you shall meet with so many accidents worthy of historie, as compiling them all together, you wil make vp a reasonable volume. And in this, you may make vse of the knowledge you haue, of the ciuill alterations, relating partly, the originall of discords, partly shewing the remedies against future mischeefes: discommending withall, things blame-worthy, and praising the cōmendable, with such reasons, as you iudge fittest. And if you would follow your wonted custom of speaking freely; you may note, many mens perfidious proceedings, plots, & trecheries against me. Withall, my disasters will minister vnto you great variety in writing, carying such a kind of contentment, as will inuite mē to read forward. For, nothing is more apt to delight the Readers, then the variety of times, & seuerall mutations of Fortune. The which, though in their triall, we found them troublesom, yet are we not sorry, to see them written. For, the secure remembrance of troubles past, bringeth contentment & others, that neuer sustain'd any greefe of their owne, reading the molestations of other men, without agreeuance, they feele a kind of compassion, which replenisheth the minde, with acceptable delight. Which of vs feeles not, both contentment, and compassion,

Wherefore, it will please me the better, if you resolue to distinguish this tale (as I may terme it) of our affaires, and successes, from the continued course o

by you celebrated. For, you are not a man, that's ignorant of your selfe. And who reputes them not rather enuious, which admire you not, then those flatterers, that doe praise you? Neither am I so foolish, to bee celebrated and eternized by one, who by celebrating mee, may not also himselfe purchase a particular renowne for his wit, and learning.

And questionlesse, hee may bee reputed wiser then all others, who is not gouerned; but gouernes Fortune; trusting onlie in himselfe, and of himselfe onely depending. This opinion I was euer of; and though it were well setled, and engrauen in my minde: notwithstanding the violence of vnhappie times, and the perpetuall shakings of aduersitie, haue somewhat displa'ct it, & made it almost to be forgotten. But now by your last letters,

I see you haue replanted it; and likewise, more by those, which to such a purpose you did write vnto mee, not long before. And therefore it is needfull that I speake not once alone, but often, and much
                     •
                   and that I assure you, that there is no iewell so precious, which I hold not base, in respect of your letters. And though those reasons, which with an artificiall forme, and in great abundance you haue collected, are of a wonderfull power to comfort; yet nothing hath more comforted me, then the constancie, and grauitie of your minde; the which in these your letters, I haue perceiued as in a looking glasse: and so much I prize it, as I am asham'd, I doe not imitate the same. I tell you more, that I hold my selfe more resolute then you, who talkes so much to me of forti
                     •
                  ude. For you seeme to haue some hope of better fortune, in that by diuers reasons you seeke to intimate vnto mee, that wee should not esteeme the Common-wealth so weakned, but that shee may rise againe; as we see, that one Fencer ouerthrowne by another, oftentimes recouers; ther
                     •
                  ore no maruaile, though you bee resolute, relying vpon some hopes: but yet I wonder, how you should haue any hope remaining. Tell me? What doe you see, which is not altogether wasted, and consumed?

Consider all the members of the Commonwealth, which are well knowne vnto you. Surely you cannot finde one which is not batter'd and broken: which things I would reherse yet further, if I knew them better then you; or if I could relate them withou
                     •
                   griefe: although according to the precepts you set downe, wee should whollie driue away, and banish all griefe. Whereupon I will support priuate discommodities, as you iudge them; and common, with greater 
                     •
                  ortitude then your selfe, who exhorts mee to suffer them. For, you are eased by some hope, as you write; bu

                   mine is the greater constancie, being supported by no hope at all And as you friendly aduise and put mee in minde, I will comfort my selfe, with thinking how much I euer loued the Common-wealth, and by reducing those times to memorie, In which I together with your selfe, so greatly assisted her; I hauing done fo

For, speaking of those things, on which for the ease of my minde you wish me to meditate, my griefe is made much lesser. And to obserue you, so fa
                     •
                  re as I am able, I will winde my selfe from cares

and passions, and I will returne to the studie of the Sciences; which in flourishing Fortune are an ornament, and in miserie a comfort; and I will remaine with you, so long as either of our ages, or health shall permit mee: and if we cannot bee together as wee would, yet the similitude of our studies, will make vs such a connexion of minde, that we shall neuer seeme to be wholly separated. Farewell.
            
            
               Lucius Lucceius, son of Quintus, to Cicero. Epist. 14.
               
               IF you bee in health, I am glad. I remaine as I was wont, and also somewhat worse then vsually. I haue many times enquired of you, desirous to see you; and I wondred as still I doe, how you can be so long out of Rome. I know not vndoubtedlie the cause, that detaines you so farre from vs. If you loue solitarinesse, for the better commoditie of writing, as you were wont to do; I am glad, and reprehend not your course; knowing that there can bee no greater delight; not onely in these miserable, and vnhappie; but also in peaceable, and quiet times; and especiallie to your minde: which being now wearie,

affects repose, after so manie agitations: and being replenished with Science, sends abroad dailie, some goodlie fruite, which pleaseth others, and augments your owne glorie. But if you haue giuen ouer your selfe in praie, as when you were heere, to sorrow and teares: I am sorrie for your griefe, and for your affliction. And if you'le giue me leaue to tell you my opinion, I cannot but reprehend you. Alas! what meanes this? will you alone, not discerne, manifest, and apparant things, who with the pregnancie of your wit, can discouer the most hidden? will not you vnderstand, that continuall lamenta
                     •
                  ion helpes nothing? will not you remember, that calamities are rather redoubled, which your wisdom would haue you to expell out of your minde? But if by waie of exhortation I can worke nothing with you, I request you by the loue you beare me, to free your selfe from these molestations, and returne to liue with vs, and to our common studies, or else to your owne, for you studie more then others. I am distracted with two contrarie things: I would not be burdensome to you, wi
                     •
                  h these my admonishments: and I would perswade you to giue ouer, the resolution you haue vndertaken. I beseech you, either in the one to follow my directions, or in the other not to trouble your selfe. Farewell.

               THE absolute loue you beare mee, appeares in euerie part of the letters which I last receiued from you. Of which loue though I was most assured before now; yet this demonstration was beyond measure acceptable to me; I would saie pleasing, but that I thinke I haue lost this word for euer: and not for the occasion you imagine, and in which, vsing most sweet and friendlie words, in effect, you grieuouslie reprehend me; but because for that deepe wound I cannot finde that cure, which may heale it. Alas! I praie tell mee? can I runne vnto my Friends? Where are they? you know of whom I speake; for wee haue found them common to vs both. Others, you know are dead; and others obdurate in their wil, neuer to come to Rome, liue in a remote countrie. I could willingly liue with you, and exceedinglie desire it: and, 'tis long since we knew, and lou'd one another. Our familiaritie is great: our studies alike: what band, or obligation is wanting to vnite vs? may wee then liue together? for my part, I know no impediment; but hitherto, wee haue not so done, though we be neighbours

about Tusculanum, and Puteoli: what should I say in Rome? Where the Forum being common, neighbourhood li
                     •
                  tle importeth. But our age, I know not through what wicked accident, is light vpon times of such disposition, that when we should taste of all contentment, wee are asham'd euen to liue. For what refuge had I left, being stript of all publike, and priuate good, together with all comfort? onely books: wherein, because I can doe nothing else, I exercise my sel
                     •
                  e continuallie: but 'tis a great matter, that they also denie mee their help, and me thinkes they exclude, me out of the Port of repose, and they reprehend me bitterlie
                     •
                   because I still remaine in this life. Which is no other then these present miseries, greater then euer were any. And do you wonder then, that I liue remote from that Cittie, where I finde no contentment from mine owne house? and where it is necess
                     •
                  rie to beare a great hatred to the times, to men, to publike places; of meeting, and to the Senate? Wherevpon I entertaine my selfe with r

                  ading, and spend therein all my time; not to finde any medicine, that might absolutely cure me; but to beguile onely that griefe, which lies heauie vpon me. And if we had had this aduertisment, as we had it not
                     •
                   thorough the continuall feares, that held vs in suspence:

We had been alwaies together; neither should your vnhealthfulnesse grieue me, nor should my heart sorrow offend you. And therfore let's vse all the meanes wee can, to liue together; seeing we cānot deuise any course, that will sort better with vs. Within these few daies therefore, I will see you. Farewell.

Law, we must not seeke to oppose our selues, in refusing that condition of life, wherein we were borne; rather with patience support those accidents, which humane wisedome cannot preuent: comforting our selues in calling to minde, that nothing happens to vs, that hath not befallen manie others. And though this may yeeld thee cōfort, yet I'le propound a thing to thee, that shall bee of greater force, then this or any other consolations, which haue bin euer practised, or written by the wise

                     •
                  tate of our cittie, and the wickednesse of these times, you will perceiue, that they are truely happie, who haue had no children: and th

                  y lesse vnhappie, who haue now lost them, then if they had lost them, when the Common-wealth flourished. It's true, that if thy great losse grieueth thee, in respect of the damage receiued; I see no course to diuert absolutely your griefe. But if naturall affection moue thee, to lament their miseries, that are dead: not to alledge now, what I haue often read, and heard vpon this argument: that there is no euill in death, after which if the soule liueth, it may ra
                     •
                  her be termed an immortalitie then a death: and if it die together with the bodie, we must not suppose that there is any miserie, because no sense: leauing I say, this

part aside, I will onely intimate vnto you one reason, which is very true: That such a danger is approaching to the Common-wealth, that euerie man should be glad to auoid with death. For what receptacle, shall honestie, bounty, vertue, laudable customes, good Arts, and finally libertie it selfe, and safetie, now finde? Questionlesse there is neuer a young man or childe, of whose death I haue heard, in this, of all others, most cruell, and pestiferous yeare, which seemes not to me by the gift of the eternall Gods, to haue beene released from these miseries, and from this so bad a condition of life? So that if I could beate into your minde this opinion; that they whom you haue lost met with no euill, it would in a great part diminish your afflictions. For so you should come to retaine onely that griefe, which you feele not for their death, but for your owne losse. And surely it befits not the grauitie, and wisdome, which since your childhood, you haue alwaies manifested, to despaire for the losse of them, that feele nothing. Remember how you haue liued hitherto, with so great moderation of minde, as it is necessarie for you to perseuere in the same constancie. And by wisedome and discourse, we must anticipate that in our selues, that at length time will bring vs: which by

the remedie of yeares, healeth euerie greene wound. For if there were neuer so base a woman, which in the losse of children, did not at last cease lamenting: surely we are bound to draw that from our prudence, which continuance of daies will bring vs; and not to expect the medicine of time, which reason first propounds vnto vs. If these letters take effect, I shall thinke that I haue obtain'd my greatest desire: If they worke nothing at all, yet shall I iudge, that I haue done the office, of that friend, which I haue euer beene, and promise during life to be vnto you. Farewell.
            
            
               Cicero to Publius Sextius. Epist. 17.

But now, supposing, that I had too long neglected this office; and the memorie of worth, & greatnesse of mind,

wherewith I know you to be endowed, vrging me thereunto: I thought good to breake of silence, with a firme opinion, that I shall commit no

                     •
                  ore hauing diligently, and religiously obserued all the offices of friendship, I would not likewise omit, to exhort, and entreat you, that you will remember, that you are a man, and a man of valour: which

is; that you will prudently support, this common, and doubtfull accident: common, because none of vs can auoid it; doubtfull, because no man knowes, whether it will be of little, or long continuance. Defend your selfe brauely from griefe, and oppose Fortune; reuoluing in your minde, that both in our Cittie, and in other Common-wealths, many valiant, and innocent men, haue beene vniustly sent into banishment. Let me also tell you this: and would to God, I might not speake true; That you are depriued of such a Countrie, which can procure no contentmēt to a wise man. Concerning your sonne, if I should write nothing, I feare that I might seeme ingratefull towards his vertue: but if I should tell you, all that I iudge of him, I feare I shall renue in you that desire, and griefe, which you were wont to feele for the priuation of so worthie a sonne. But neuerthelesse you shall doe exceeding wisely, to thinke, that his loue, his valour, and his industrie remaine alwaies with your selfe: those things being no lesse our owne, that we embrace with our mind, then the same, that we behold with our eyes. His high valour therefore, and the inexplicable loue he beares you, ought to giue you great consolation. And you ought to receiue no smal comfort, considering that we and many others, so

much esteeme you, for the rare qualities of your minde: & that this aduerse Fortune abates no whit, of our loue to you; or of our iudgement concerning you. Whereunto you may adde another reason; that as you haue not deserued this exile; so you should not much grieue therefore. For, wise men, when they are priuie to their innocentie, are neuer disturbed for any accident, that can happen to them. I, for the memorie I retaine of our auncient friendship, and for the vertue which shineth in your sonne, and for the obseruance he shewes me, will be most readie to yeeld you helpe, and comfort. If it happen that you write to me of any thing, I will so handle the matter, that you shall perceiue, your writing was not friuolous. Farewell.

Your owne valour hath giuen you more then Fortune tooke from you: hauing obtained that, which seldome strange, or ignoble cittizens are wont; and lost that, which Fortune hath taken away from many of greatest nobilitie. Besides I see, that Tribunals of iudgement, and commendable customes of our countrie will be so altred; that happie is he, that with least grieuous paine, is from such a Common-wealth departed. But you hauing both goods, and children, and vs, together with others, conioyned vnto you in the nearest of loue, being to make

My affection towards you, and your children, euen as you desire, and as it ought to be, so shall it euer continue. Farewell.

               I Did euer beleeue, that you loued me from your heart. But I am euery day

more confirmed in this beliefe: and I know that euidently, which sometimes you wrote vnto me; that your affection, would appeare so much greater to me, then it did in the Prouince

                   by how much the better it may be discerned, that it proceeded from iudgement, and not from obligation. Although my opinion is, that you cannot doe more then that, which you did in the Prouince, to demonstrate your loue towards me. I receiued a few daies since your letters, which were most acceptable to me; for you writ, that although you expected my comming with great desire, notwithstanding because matters went forward, otherwise, then you supposed, you reioyced at the course I tooke. Now, I haue receiued these other, which gaue me exceeding contentment, because I vnderstand, you are of the same opinion, that all good and valiant men ought to be of; that nothing is profitable, but that which is honest and iust. And besides th

                  ther so euer I goe, which is the most acceptable thing you can doe for me, and (if I be not deceiu'd) most honourable for your selfe. Till now, I neuer acquainted you, with my intention by writing; not because I would conceale my selfe from you, but in that communicating my aduise vnto you, it was but

a putting you in mind of the office of that good Cittizen, whereof you make profession; and an inuiting you, to run both my perill, and fortune. But considering that I see, with how much loue, and courtesie you offer your selfe vnto me: I willingly accept of your good minde; but without any binding you, to keepe promise with me. If you doe what you make shew of; I shall remaine greatly bound to you therefore: If you doe not, I will excuse you. And of these two elections, I suppose, that the first hath pleased you for my sake, and th'other for feare. For now, we truely debate of a most important matter. That which is honest, is plainely discerned. That, that is profitable is hidden from vs. Yet if we be the men we should be; that is, worthie of our studies, and of our profession; we need not doubt, but 'tis better to choose, that which is honest, then that, that is profitable. And if you be of this opinion, come to me presently. But if you thinke, you cannot presently come thither, whither honestie cals vs: I will aduertise you in what soeuer is requisite, and in conclusion, I say vnto you, that what course soeuer you take, I will be your friend; but if you be the man I desire, your best

man, that would be with you, at the drawing of the accompts: but left the charge thereof to my Notarie, appointing him expresly, that he should frame euery thing to your minde. I neither doe nor euer will repent me, of hauing that confidence in you, which I made shew of: but me thinkes it's strange, that you entred into a iealou

Whereupon to this part, I answer, that though I had many iust occasions, for which I could not vse anie delaie, in giuing vp my accounts in

                  : Neuerthelesse, I would haue stayed for you, had I not thought they could not haue beene reexamined after they were registred in the Prouince. And as for Volusius, I am informed by vnderstanding men, and especiallie by Caius Camillus my verie good friend, and most expert in such affaires; that wee could not change the course set downe, nor transferre Valerius debt, vpon the person of Volusius; because they that stood bound for Valerius, had beene neither more nor le
                     ••
                  e oblieged to payment. And the principall debt, was no
                     •
                   as you write, 900. crownes but 570. For, about the somme which came short of 900, we had receiued no assignations, in the name of Valerius. But certainely you seeme to repute me, both discourteous, and negligent; yea, (but I respect it not) and verie indiscreet. Discourteous, in that you imagine a Legate, and an officer of mine, were discharged, not for mine owne, but for my Notaries benefit; especially, when they were not to bee bound, to this inconuenience. Negligent; you supposing, that I neuer sought to bee acquainted with a matter, which did import my office so neerely, as it might proue preiudiciall to me: and that my Notarie, had set downe that, which he thought good, without speaking one word to me: alleaging, that if I had

thought thereon, I would haue proceeded more circumspectly. And I say vnto you, that I thought sufficiently of it, and I minded to haue eased Volusius, of so waightie a somme. And on the other side, I haue 
                     •
                  ound out a way, that Titus Marius, and others, which put in their securitie for Valerius, should not be in any danger to paie it: taking such a course therein, that no man found himselfe grieued, nay, all in generall highly commended mee for it. And I must tell you more: My Notarie onely, tooke it not well. But I thought it the part of an honest man, hauing reseru'd to the people, what was belonging to them, to preuent the particular losse of so many good friends, and Cittizens. As for the monies raised out of the Prouince, you know, that by the aduise of 
                     
                        •

                     •
                  uen as Sextus tooke yours, which you laid vp: But this imports not you. I may well grieue, that I had not the foresight to make a note; by which it might haue appear'd, that you left those sommes there, with my approbation: but that there are extant, the Senats decree, and both our letters. From hence it is manifest, that those monies were deliuered

to Publius Sextius: & I, seeing the matter so cleare, as no errour could ensue
                     •
                   I tooke no great care to make such a note: but now I wish, for your satisfaction, that I had made it. I am of your opinion, about giuing in of the accompts, which you are to make: Neither in this, shall your, and my accompts differ any thing: For you shall adde, that there you left those sommes by my Order; which I neuer put in. Neither haue I any reason to denie you this fauour: and though I had, yet to pleasure you, I would not denie it. As for the accompt of 2700 crownes, you cannot complaine; for it was set down as you pleased, or

But I must bee circumspect, that herein I cōmit no error, the tearm set downe by the Senate being past. But surely, you haue no reason to be so angry, for I could not otherwise behaue my selfe: although in this, I refer mee to their iudgements, that vnderstand it better then I doe. This I assure you, that I'le faile you in nothing, not onely wherein I see you deepely interested, but wherein soeuer I may doe you a pleasure. As for

Out of doubt, I am verie sorrie, that I left not this care to you, seeing you are so ambitious of it. For of my part, there is no ambition at all. But there remaine the Centurions names, to bee presented, and the Camerades of

Whereof, whether I complaine, or not, questionlesse, your losse being onely three thousand Crownes, you may endure it with the greater patience; imagining with your selfe, that the Senate allowed you not so great prouisions, as indeede it gaue you; or, that my selfe gaue you not so much, as I did. For, if you lent mee those three thousand Crownes, yet I am so confident in your good nature, and in the loue you beare me, that you would not now force me to sell somthing of mine owne, to haue them againe: for otherwise, I haue no meanes to restore you them. But all that I haue written, esteeme it to bee written by way of merriment: And the like doe I, by that you haue written to mee.

               I Haue read your letters with contentment, by which I vnderstood, that you greatly desire to see mee: Which I imagined, though you had not written it. Neither is my desire in this, inferior to your owne. And so let my thoughts obtaine their wished ends, as I heartily desire to be with you. For, when our Countrey did more abound, then now it doth, with men of valour, and true Citizens, and the number of my friends was greater; yet was there none, with whom I was more willing to conuerse, then with your selfe, and but few, with whom so willingly; but now, some being dead, other some in remote Countries, and others not bearing that mind towards mee, they were wont to doe; I should verily thinke one day better spent with you, then all the time I consume with many of those, with whom I conuerse out of necessitie. And I assure you, that solitarinesse would bee much more acceptable to me, (which, notwithstanding, is not granted mee)

                  ainements, that daily frequent my house; except it be of one, or two, at the most. Therefore I retire my selfe, as I would wish you also, to our pleasing studies: and withall, I comfort my selfe with the memoriall of my intentions, thinking to my selfe, that I neuer had respect, (as I suppose you conceiue) to priuate benefit, but to publique safetie. And if hee, whom you could neuer loue, because you loued me, had not borne me enuie; hee, and with him all other good men, had been happy. I would neuer consent, that the violence of any particular man should bee so powerfull, as to suppresse common libertie. And after I saw those armes, which I euer feared would bee able to doe more, then the consent of good Citizens, who, according to my directions, and examples, vndertooke to defend the Common-wealth: I was of opinion, that discords were rather to be compounded, though vpon vnequall termes, so it we

                  e with securitie, then to fight against those, who were stronger then our selues. But shortly wee'l confer, both of this, and many other things. And I remaine now in Rome, for no other end, but before my departure, to know the successe of the war, that is now on foot in Africa. For, I am of constant beleefe, that we shal shortly see an end thereof. And I am of opinion,

it imports me, I know not what, to delay my departure: that I may ioyne with my friends, to take some course, according to the newes, we shall receiue. Although I cannot tell you, what it is, that should so import mee; matters being growne to that passe, as ouercome who will, the victorie will be the same, though equitie, stand more with the one, then the other part.

But as in good fortune, wee bare our selues moderately, so ought wee to resist this constantly, which is the worst that could haue happened: That among so many euils, we may enioy this little benefit; that whereas in happie times; it was our dutie to contemne death, in which is felt no miserie; now, being plunged in so many tribulations,

we ought not so much to contemne, as to desire it. I request you, for the loues sake, that you beare mee, to embrace this quiet: and firmely to beleeue, that besides offence, and sin, from which you haue beene hitherto, and euer will bee exempted, there can nothing light vpon a man, how terrible soeuer, which should dismay him.

            THE SIXT BOOKE OF THE FAMILIAR EPISTLES OF M. T. CICERO.
            
               Cicero to Aulus Torquatus. Epist. 1.
               
               
                  THough there be such a confusion of all things, that euery one is discontented with his fortunes, and that there's no man, that would not rather be any where, then where he is: neuerthelesse, I make no doubt, but that in these times, it greeues euery honest man, rather to bee in Rome, then any where else. For, though there is great affliction felt in all places, for the great

losse, both publike and particular, neuerthelesse, the eies encrease greefe, when they are constrained to behold that, which others heare; neither doe they euer suffer vs to remoue our thoughts from miseries. Whereupon, though of nec
                     •
                  ssitie, seeing your 
                     •
                  elfe depriu'd of many things, you must needs be affected with great greefe: yet free your minde, from being gr
                     •
                  eu'd, because you are not at Rome; the which, as I heare, vexeth and troubleth you. For, though it may touch you neerely, that you are separated from your friends, and your owne fortunes; yet they st

                  nd in their vsuall state, nor would they be greatly better'd, by your being present. N

                  use that which is common. And, whensoeuer it happens, ô Torquatus, that you truely consider with your selfe; you shall not need to yeeld, either to desperation, or feare. For C

                     •
                  ecure; the end of all warres being doub
                     •
                  full. For the one victorie I cannot perceiue, that you are in any such danger, that is not as well euerie

mans ruine as yours. And for the other, I know you no waies stand in feare. It remaines that the generall perill of the Common-wealth, must needs peirce your heart; the which I turne to a kinde of consolation. And though learned men, prescribe many medicines, for this so growen a disease; yet I feare, there is no other true comfort to be found, then that, which is applied from the fortitude of a mans minde. For if to liue well, and happily, it sufficeth that a man haue a cleare conscience, and doe all things conformable to Iustice: I thinke we cannot properly terme him vnhappie, who is priuie to his owne heart, that his secretest thoughts had neuer other obiect, then honestie. For I cannot imagine, that we left our country, our children, and our fortunes, for any hope of reward: but therein we thought that we discharg'd a certaine iust, pious, and requisite office, for the Common-wealth, and to our owne honor; not being so foolish, that we should repute victorie certaine. Whereupon if the same ensued, which formerly wee supposed might happen, when we did enter into the enterprize: we must not abandon our selues, as if somthing had hapned, we thought would neuer haue come to passe. Let vs therefore beleeue (as in truth we may) that those things are neuer blam'd

in vs, which proceed from Fortune, and not from our selues: and being exempted from this blame, we ought patiently to vndergoe those disasters, vnto which, the life of man, is subiect. Out of which reasons I conclude, that there is no man so sunke in miserie, but that vertue is of power, to preserue him. But let the lot fall to whom it will, of euery side you haue hopes, if any hope remaine to publicke affaires. And here I remember, how you were wont, to reprehend my despaire; and to encourage me to that warre, whereunto you savv me going against my will. At which time I neuer condemn'd our reasons, but our course. For I saw, that we too late opposed those armes, which had been much strengthened by our selues. Wherefore I gaue counsell, that such a warre was to be auoided, wherein force preuailed aboue counsell; and violence, aboue reason. And when I said, that, that would ensue which did; I presaged not what would come to passe: but onely feared lea
                     •
                  t those miseries should happen, which I saw were likely to fall out: especially, that if I should haue giuen my censure of one, of two ends, I would surely haue promised that, which was most certaine. For we were superior in those things, which are not vsed in fighting; but inferior in the experience of armes, and resolution of

souldiers. Now, assume you, I pray ye, that courage, which then you thought I was to take. All the fore-mentioned I haue vvritten, because your Philargyrus discoursing before with me, and mou'd as I thinke, out of loyall affection, he told me, how sometimes you would be transported with griefe, which you should by all meanes bridle: being assured, that if the Common wealth returne to her former estate, you may certainely hope, that you shall liue as honorably in the same, as any way is conuenient: and if she remaine desolate and oppressed, you shall haue no worse conditions therein then the rest. And this time, wherein vvee all continue doubtfull, and daunted, ought hereupon to seeme vnto you lesse grieuous, because you are in that Cittie, vvhere vertue grew, and was borne; vvhich teacheth vs, how to dispose, and order our liues. Then haue you Seruilius Sulpitius, whom you alwayes loued dearely, whose louing and sage exhortations, you cannot want: and if we had followed his authoritie and counsell, vve should neuer haue lost vvith armes in hand; but we should willingly haue yeelded, without comming to them. I haue spoken too much, vvhere peraduenture 'tvvas not requisite; that which most of all imports, I vvill tell you briefly. There is no man, to whom I

am more bound then to you. The ruine of this warre hath depriu'd me of those friends, to vvhom I vvas deeply oblieged, as you can testifie. I knovv that at this instant, I beare no svvay. But because no man is so afflicted by misf

But no more at this present. I should be very glad, if you would write vnto me, what you doe, and where you will be: to the end I may know whither to write, and whither to come. Farewell.

               IN the last letters, I was somewhat long, not that there was any need, but to testifie the loue, which I beare you. For your valour is so solide of it selfe, that no exhortation is necessary to susteine it: neither am I in a state, to comfort another, being depriu'd of all consolation. Wherefo

                  e at this present, I must be briefe: for if then it was not requisite to write at large; much lesse is it now: And if it were then necessary; let that which I haue written suffice; the rather because nothing new hath since

occurred. For though we haue newes euery day, the which peraduenture you heare also: yet all sort to that end, which I discerne as well by my vnderstanding, as the things that we behold with our eyes. And yet I see nothing, the which I know not vnd
                     •
                  ubtedly that you likewise obserue. For though no man can presage, the euent of the battaile: yet me thinkes I see it: and if I see it not, neuerthelesse, in that of necessitie one or other must vanquish, I conceiue what victorie will come to, as well in the one, as the other. And let fortune bend to which side she will, I perceiue such a scourge thereon depending, that a man ought almost to seeke death to auoide it, with which some suppose to daunt vs. For a life depriued of Honor is no life: and death though it bring an end to a happie life, was neuer by wisemen reputed a miserie. But you are in that Cittie, where the wals themselues, can tell you these things, and that more aboundantly, and with greater eloquence
                     •
                   I assure you, though other mens miseries are but of small consolation, that you are in no greater danger, then any of those whosoeuer, which either forsooke the war, or of others tha

               Cicero to Aulus Torquatus. Epist. 4.
               
               THere is no newes at all; and if there were, I know your Friends certifie you thereof: but of the future though it be hard to speake: neuerthelesse a man may by imagination sometimes come neere it, when the matter is such, that a man may forecast the issue. At this time it seemes onely probable, that the warre will not long continue: though some are of contrarie opinion. I thinke that by this time some effect hath ensued: not that I know it certainely, but because wee may easily conceiue as much. First, euery man may expect the victorie; and of all battailes, the end is ambiguous. Then, the Armie both of one and other side is so

great, and so resolu'd to fight, as it is no great wonder though either of them vanquish. That opinion is euery day confirmed, that although the occasions of the warre bee different, yet betweene their victories there will bee no great difference. One side wee know, by experience: on the other part, if Caesar vanquish, there is no man who doth not forecast, how great feare the
                     •
                  e is like to be; both because it is prouoked, and in that it will haue armes in hand. And in relating this to you, if you think that I augment your griefe, whereas I should mittigate it with some consolation: I confesse, that I finde no comfort in the common calamities, besides one; the which if you could embrace, were very great, and such as I euerie day make vse of: and this it is. That a man, when hee hath wrought all the good hee is able, 
                     •
                  ought not to bee disturbed for any contrarietie, that may happen, not hauing deserued it. Therefore, wee hauing alwaies aduised

                  or the benefit of the Common-wealth, and being rather the blame of Fortune, then of our counsels, that things haue succeeded ill: and in a word; for so much as did belong vnto vs, we hauing neuer beene deficient; we ought to endure that patiently which hath happened. But yet I will not bee perswaded, that I am able to comfort you, in these

common miseries, wherein a greater wit then mine is required to giue it; and singular vertue, to support it. Neuerthelesse, euery one may easilie shew you, how in particular, you haue no occasion to complaine. For although Caesar hath beene more slacke in releasing you from trouble, then we supposed: yet I know he carries a good affection to you. For concerning others, I doe

                  ot beleeue you expect my opinion. It remaines, that you grieue, because for so long time, you are f

Although to my selfe, who deuise alwaies to com

Besides this: I am now old: and I thinke I haue spent my yeares so well, that in one respect, I should die with comfort; and in another, I should not take my selfe to be iniured, though I be forced to passe that period; whether nature her selfe hath almost conducted m

It displeas'd me that Seruius went from Athens; who because hee was your familiar friend, and one replenished with bountie, and wisedome, should I know, haue euer beene neere about you, and haue giuen you great comfort. My desire is, that as you ought, and your custome is, you would relie on your firme resolution. I will with all diligence, and care procure that, which I shall thinke to be beneficiall for you, and what may profitablie concerne, either your selfe, or yours. In doing whereof, I shall imitate your loue towards mee: but neuer arriue to [your] deserts. Farewell.

               I Know not how you remaine satisfied at my hands; in that I haue not written vnto you, as I stood bound; 
                     ••

                     •
                  ecause we were both of one, and the same Faction.

Questionlesse, both long since, and many times, I would haue written to you, but that expecting dailie better euents, I desired rather to reioyce with you, then comfort you. Euen as shortly I hope to doe; which will minister me occasion to write againe vnto you. Now, though I am inform'd and hope, that you contest with Fortune, out of a resolute minde: yet I'le see, whether with these letters, I can adde vnto your forces. I know I am not fit to doe it: but that Authoritie which deriues from great loue, ought to operate very much. Neither will I attempt to comfort you, as one afflicted, and depriued of all hopes of safetie: but as a person, of whose safetie, I promise my selfe neither more nor lesse, then you heeretofore were wont to promise your selfe of mine. I remember when I was expelled by them, who thought they could not

                  uine the Common-wealth, except I; were first supprest, that manie of my friends, who came out of Asia, where you were to see mee, told mee, how you affirmed, that I should be presently, restor'd, and with infinite honor. If you, through a certaine knowledge of Tuscan discipline, which you had learned from your Father, who was a noble, and honest Gentleman, tooke not your markes amisse: No more should my prognostication bee

false, being grounded vpon that, which many wise men haue written, and I haue read, as your selfe knowes, with exact diligence. Besides the apprehension I may haue therein, through my great experience in publike affaires, and for that which I haue obserued in my selfe; to which kinde of prognostication I giue so much the greater credit, because in present things, so obscure, and troublesome, it neuer deceiu'd me. I would speake of those things which I haue presaged, but that I will not seeme to haue now 
                     •
                  eyned that which is come to passe. Yet many can testifie, how in the beginning I aduised Pompeius, not to ioyne with Caesar: and afterwards that hee should not separate himselfe from him. perceiuing very cleerely, that ioyning with him, the authoritie of the Senate was much impaired; and being separated, a ciuill warre would grow. I was a great friend to Caesar, and I loued and honoured Pompeius: but a
                     •
                   my counsell was loyall to Pompeius, so both to one, and other it was profitable. Many other things passed, which I foresawe. Because I would not that Caesar, to whom I was much bound, should know, that if Pompeius had obserued my directions, he should haue beene in high state, and honoured of all the Cittizens; but yet hee should not haue had such a power, as now he

hath. I perswaded Pompeius to goe into Spaine. If he had gone thither, the ciuill warre had not ensued. I sought not to obtaine, that Caesar being out of Rome, might stand for the Consulship: but when the people (Pompeius the Consull hims
                     •
                  lfe, vrging it with great importunitie) had granted it him: I said 'twas good to satisfie him therein. And discerning that this was the seede of ciuill discords, with many reasons, I laboured to extinguish it; reprehending them which affected not peace: the which, though it were accompanied with vnequall conditions, yet I preferred it before warre, which on our behalfe was most i
                     •
                  st. Pompeius knew I spake truth: but there were some so blinde, that to enrich themselues, and effect their desires, holding victorie secure in that Pompeius was their Captaine, they saw not the benefit of my Councell. They came to armes: I stirred not: they went out of Italy, I staid as long as I could. In briefe, the care of my honor, wrought more in me, then the feare of life. I would not leaue Pompeius, because he had not forsaken mee in my necessities: therefore to shunne infamie, like that Amphiar
                        •
                     us in the Fables, I expos'd my selfe, to manifest ruine. In which warre no aduersitie fell out, which I had not formerly denounced. Seeing therefore

you may perceiue the truth of my reasons, you are bound to beleeue mee, as men vse to beleeue Augures, and Astrologers, when they haue once spoken truth. Neither, doe I now goe after dreames, as the Augures are wont to doe, nor doe I marke how the birds flie, nor hearken I how they sing, nor minde how they eate: but I obserue other signes: which if they be not more certaine then those, yet they are more easie to comprehend, and consequently, not so fallible. And my Prognostication is grounded vpon two reasons. On the one side I consider Caesars nature: on the other, that of the ciuill warres. Caesar is benigne and clement, iust as he is disciphered in that booke, where you complaine of him. Besides, he loues noble spirits, such as yours is: and finally, 
                     •
                  e will be ouercome, with many mens entreaties: seeing, that they are not mou'd out of vaine ambition, but out of office, and charitie. The which all Tuscanie doing, 'tis to be thought, shee will be heard. Now, what's the reason, that hitherto, these things haue done little good? For he thinkes, that granting your returne, with whom, it seemes, he hath some cause to be angry; he could not afterwards deny it many others. Oh, you'le say, what may I hope for then? if he be angry with me? he conceiues, that he

may extract his praises from the same fountaine, by whose drops, hee was formerly made wet, or dashed. Finally, he is a man of great wit, and prudent discourse. He see'th plainely, that he cannot long keepe you out of your Countrie, you being in Tuscanie, which is no base part of I
                        •
                     alie, but amongst others, the most noble: and equall to any in Rome, of the more honourable sort of cittizens of your age, for wit, fauour, and iudgement. He will not that hereafter you should acknowledge this benefit rather from the time, then now from him. I haue spoken of Caesar: Now I'le speake of the nature of the ciuill warres. There is no man such an enemy to that enterprise, which Pomp
                        •
                     ius, with great courage, but small preparations vndertooke, that can say, that we haue eyther beene bad cittizens, or bad men. Wherein I am wont to admire the grauitie, iustice, and wisedome of Caesar: He neuer speakes but honorably of Pompeius: Oh, but he hath perform'd against him, many terribly actions. The blame is not Caesars, but of armes, and of the victory. Doe but marke vs: how hath he embraced vs? He made Cassius his Legate; He hath giuen the gouernment of Fraun
                        •
                     e to Brutus, and to Sulpicius that of Gracia: he restor'd Marcellus, against whom, he was wonderfully incenst, with as great honor, as could be

wisht. What can I therefore inferre? Take the world what forme it will, the nature of things, and of ciuill warres, will neuer permit, but that in one, and the selfe same cause, all may haue the same condition: and that good men, and good cittizens, that are innocent, may returne into that Cittie, whereinto so many guiltie banished men are returned. This is my prognostication: of which if I made any doubt, I would rather vse that consolation, with which you being a valiant man, as you are, I might easily suppose to comfort you: That if you had taken vp armes, for the Common-wealth, (for so you then thought) with certaine hope of victorie, you should not haue beene much to be commended; but had you imagined, it might so come to passe, that we should be vanquish't, the end of warre being vncertaine: it would haue beene a thing most vnbeseeming you, not to haue beene constant in aduerse fortune; as you would haue beene discreet, and moderate in prosperous.

                  ull your studies would be vnto you in aduersities. I could rip vp vnto you, the fearefull accidents, not onely of auncient, but also of moderne Captaines, that haue beene in this war,

with you. For other mens examples, reducing that law to memorie, whereunto all men, are constrained to obey, extenuate our griefe. Besides this, I would aduertise you, in how great an hauak and confussion of things we liue: in that we should lesse grieue to be depriu'd of our countrie, when it is in ill state, then when it is well: but I would not haue you thinke of this reason. For out of hand, as I hope, nay, rather as I plainely discerne, we shall see you, in honor, and safetie. In the meane while, although I haue at many other times performed this office: neuerthelesse, because Caesar, and his friends do shew me euery day better countenance, I more confidently promise you, my paines, my endeuour, my loue, and my labour. And be assured, that what authoritie or fauour soeuer I doe obtaine, I'le employ it all for your benefit: as formerly I offer'd to your sonne, the true image, no l

               Aulus Caecina to Cicero. Ep. 7.
               
               I Vnderstand, that my sonne hath not let my booke be seene, doubting (and not without cause) lest he might foolishly erre to our preiudice: considering that, the same which was written, with a sincere meaning, may bee wrested to a contrary sense. And therefore if you haue not had it, ascribe the blame to feare, and to the qualitie of our state, worthie doubtlesse of compassion. This my misfortune which st
                     •
                  ll continues, grew by writing: and in this I know my selfe, more vnfortunate then others. For when a writing is vncorrected, by cancelling the error, there is remedie: and when on is a foole, fame giues him due chastisement. But my error is amended by banishment: the sum of which offence is; that being armed I spake 
                     •
                  ll of my aduersary. According to my opinion, there is none of vs, which prayed not for victorie: and which desired not also, when he sacrificed vpon any other cause, that Caesar might be suddenly discomforted: If himselfe thinke no
                     •
                   so; he is truely happie: if he know and conceiue as much; why is he angry with me, for hauing written somewhat, that he would not haue [to be written], he hauing pardoned

others, who sent vp their prayers to the gods for his ruine. But to returne to the purpose, the reason you had not the booke was this; because I haue written of you, but yet sparingly, and with respect; desire spurring me forward, but feare keeping me backe: whereas, it were requisite, that he that wrote of such an argument should not onely be free from all respects, but be of wit also, and of a valiant, and resolu

thing with restraint, what contentment can he giue the reader? And when I but name Caesar, I feele my selfe tremble; not for feare of punishment, but of his iudgement, because I doe not entirely know his nature. How thinke you, that my minde may stand, when it reuolues with it selfe, reasoning almost after this manner? This word will please h

                   What will he do now, that I am vanquished, and banished?

If you, doe this, who were wont to assist euery one with your high eloquence: What opinion should I conceiue of my selfe, who for so many years, vs

it; in that a man must not write to satisfie his owne iudgement, but in such a sort, as he esteemes may please others: how difficult it is to doe anie good thing, if you haue not found it by reason, Nature hauing giuen you a singular wit, apt for euery great enterprise; we now find it. Neuerthelesse, I enioyn'd my sonne, that he should read the booke to you, without leauing it in your hands: except you would promise to correct it; that is, wholly to change it. Touching the going into Asia, though great necessitie vrged me, yet I haue followed your aduise. About my returne, 'tis superfluous to entreat you: you see the time is come, wherein it must be dilated of. It is needles my Cicero, for you to haue any regard to my sonne [herein,] his age, too much affection, and feare, take from him those aduertisements, which in that respect, are requisite. 'Tis fit that you take vpon you, all this enterprise. I haue placed all my hope in you. You absolutely know, out of your wisedome, what things wil delight him, and with what, one may reconcile his fauour. It is requisite that from you, all things should haue their beginning, and all b

must not onely take vpon you the charge imposed, though this were indeed too much; but that the whole burden is yours: you may easily obtaine whatsoeuer is desired. And if this securitie which I intrude vpon you, make me seeme either too

               HAuing vnderstood by Largus, who is your kinde Affectionate: how on the Calends of Ianuary, your safe conduct was expired: I spake with Balbus, and Oppius, knowing that euerie thing was well done, which was acted by them in Caesars absence: and I earnestly entreated, both the one and the other, that they would grant mee, that you might remaine in Sicilia at your

pleasure: who being wont, either to promise mee willingly, whensoeuer I demanded any thing of them, that stood not against their mindes; or else to denie me, and tell mee the reasons, why they did so: at that instant they gaue me no absolute answer: but y

                  t the selfe same day, they returned to me, and granted me, that you should continue in Sicilia, as long as you would: for they would so vse the matter, that Caesar should bee content.

This being done, I receiued your letters: wherein you consult with mee, whether you should stay in Sicilia, or goe into Asia, to set in order some busine

But whether the one or the other bee true, my opinion is, that you should not stir from thence. You shall bee neere to Rome; and hauing opportunitie of often writing, and

I would not wish you, to depart from thence, in anie wise. I will commend you to my friends, Titus Furfanus, Posthumius, and his Legates, when they come, for they were al at Mutina. They are men of great bountie, and much affected to those of your qualitie, and my verie inward acquaintance. Wherin soeuer I see that I may do you good, I will doe my endeuour, without being required thereunto. And what I of my selfe vnderstand not: if it be told me, I'le exceed anie mans labour, or diligence therin, whatsoeuer. And though I meane to speak so effectually with Furfanus, that letters shall not be very needfull: yet some friends of yours thinking good, that I should write a word vnto him, for you to deliuer: I desired herein to content them.

To offer you comfort, seem'd not necessarie, vnderstanding by many, how resolutely, and wisely you support the iniutie of the times; and how much the sinceritie of your owne operations, and counsels doe comfort you. And if you doe this, you reape great fruite from vertuous

For first hee, who can doe what hee will, becomes in my iudgement euery day more reasonable, and discends further into the nature of all things: besides the cause is so iust, that it necessarilie, together with the Common-wealth, which cannot alwaies languish, will rise vp againe, and resume vigor: and euery daie wee finde, more benignitie, and fauour then wee hop't for.

                  ue cogitations. And therefore, to rid you of all griefe, that might ceaze on your minde, I iudge no remedie could be better, then to giue you full notice of your deliuerie: which is most certaine. You know, that before, when I wrote vnto you, I onely comforted you, as an inuincible, and wise man, but I gaue you no certaine hope of returning into your countrie, till the heate of this warre were quenched. Remember your letters, wherein you shewed a great minde, & fi

                  me, and constant to endure all accidents. Which seem'd no wonder to me, when I call'd to minde, that from a youth, you did negotiate in the Commonwealth; and it fell out that you had all your M

                  gistracies, in the greatest dangers of the same
                     •
                   and you entred into this warre, not onely with an intention to be happie, if you prou'd victor, but to bee wise, though you were vanquish't. Besides, spending all your studies, in celebrating the worthie acts of valiant men: you must consider, that you ought to do nothing, in which

you should shew your selfe, vnlike to them. But these instructions were rather to bee vsed, if you were in those miseries, from which you are now free'd. But now, resolue onely to tolerate with vs these [inconueniences] which at this instant oppresse vs: to which if I found any medicine, I would also giue it vnto you. But there
                     •

But to returne to the beginning, be assur'd, that your restitution is obtained. Farewell.
            
            
               Cicero to Quintus Ligarius. Epist. 14.
               
               THough in these your molestations, it was my part, to write vnto you sometimes, to comfort you, and to giue you assistance: neuerthelesse, I did it not hitherto, supposing that I could not either with words mitigate, or in any other maner extenuate your griefe. But seeing I conceiue great hope, that within a short time, you may compasse your returne into your country: I could

not, but signifie vnto you, my opinion and desire. First therefore I will write, that which I discerne, and see clearely; that Caesar will not be so bitter to you, as he hath beene hitherto: because not onely the matter it selfe, the times, and the opinions of men; but, as I perceiue, his owne nature also, doth euery day, more and more mollifie him. This hope I conceiue, for all men, but for your person, I may haue it farre greater, being secured thereof, by his nearest fauorites: to whom since newes first came out of Africa, I haue not ceased to sue, together with your brothers: who are so carefull to procure your returne, as I constantly beleeue, that Caesar seeing their valour, and singular affection towards you, will graunt what they would: and if the matter suffer some longer delay, then we could wish; it is, because we cannot haue audience from him, being exceedingly busied, in that hee must giue answere to so many demaunds. And moreouer, being prouoked against them, that haue renued the warre in Africa, it seemes he hath a purpose to punish them longest, from whom he hath rec
                     •
                  iued longest trouble. And yet against these men also he growes euery day more pacified. Whereupon I promise you, (and keepe in minde what I say) that you shall not continue in these

perplexities any long time. Thus much touching my opinion. My loue I had rather should be manifest vnto you, by effects, then by words. And were I able to doe as much as by right I should, in that common-wealth, of whom I haue so well deseru
                     •
                  d as you suppose: you should not remaine in so miserable an esta
                     •
                  e. But the same occasions haue depriued me both of power & fauour, which were vnto you the cause of you
                     •
                   afflictions. Neuerthelesse, looke what the shaddow of my former dignities can compasse; what I am able to per

                  ell, with my endeuour, with my fauour, and with my affection; I will not faile to apply it whollie to you

                   benefit. Be of an inuincible spirit, as

                     •
                  rst, for the reasons aboue mentioned: and then, because you haue alwayes both counselled, and wrought so well for the Common-wealth, that now, you may not onely hope, for better fortune: but if you did meet with it quite contrarie, yet knowing that your counsels and actions haue alwaies beene laudable, you ought to support it, with valour, and constancie. Farewell.

I spake whatsoeuer I thought fitting for your purpose: and not onely by Caesars answere, which truely, was fauourable, and courteous, but by his eyes, his countenance, and many other signes, which I could better discerne, then set downe in writing, I tooke such a conceit, as I esteeme your returne most certaine. Be of good cheere therefore, and seeing you wisely supported, the more tempestuous times; beare these also chearefully, that begin to be more temperate. Yet beleeue not, that I w

Farewell.

Whereas you write vnto mee, that I should procure you to haue the charge, of some of those festiuities, which are to be celebrated in the countries: I haue talked therof, with Oppius: for I saw not Balbus, since your departure, being so troubled with a paine in his feet, that he comes not abroad. But you should doe much more wisely, not to seeke these employments; for you cannot by this, colour your designes: Caesars friends being multiplied in such aboundance, that hee rather leaues some, then lets any new ones take place; especially if hee bring nothing but endeauour. wherein he will think, that hee hath done you a fauour, yea, though hee should know, that you did not receiue it. Neuerthelesse, wee'l see what hope there is: for if there be none, I would aduise you rather, to estrange your thoughts from it, then to haue a desire thereof. I thinke to stay some daies in Astura, till Caesar comes thither. Farewell.

               Cicero to Toranius. Epist. 22.

                  iferous warre is now at hand, or that some effect hath ensued; yet I cannot, but daily thinke, how you alone, in so great an armie, should be of the same opinion I am: And that wee onely, saw wha

                   ill was in that warre; wherein, all hope of peace excluded, the victorie it selfe must needs be terrible, which brought death, if you were vanquished; if Victor, the yoke of seruitude. Whereupon I, whom those valiant and wise men, the Domitij, and Lentuli, then said was timorous (as indeed

I was; for I fear'd what came to passe) doe now feare nothing, and am prepared against euerie accident. when I supposed, that some part of the losses, which afterwards wee sustained, might haue beene preuented; th

And I knowing, that I haue laboured to maintaine the dignitie of the Common-wealth, so long as I could; and able to do no more; I haue endeuoured at least, the preseruation of her safety. This I haue written, not to vse speech of my selfe, but to giue you occasion to think theron; you euer hauing wished, & aduised the same, that I did. For 'tis a singular comfort, when a man cals to mind, that though the contrary hapned, neuerthelesse, that he alwayes perswaded that, which reason & conscience did read vnto him, And I would to God, that we might once see the Common-wealth, in some state; and that enioying each other, we may compare our afflictions together, which we then suffered, when we were reputed timor
                     •
                  us, because we foretold those things which haue ensued. As for your affaires, be assured, that you haue no

cause, to feare any other thing, but the generall ruine of the Common-wealth. Of me constantly beleeue, that wherein I may be assisting to you, your safetie, and to your children; I will euer be readie, with the greatest care, and diligence possible. Farewell.

               IF I haue not written to you, since your comming into Italie; the reason onely was, because I could promise you nothing; being in so miserable an estate: neither could I aduise you, my selfe wanting councell: and in so grieuous tribulations, I found no m

And I grieue the lesse, for your comming so seldome to see vs, for if you vvere at Rome, neither could I enioy your sweete conuersatiō, nor you make vse of mine, be it what it will be, by reason of my troublesome negotiations: from which if I can but ease my selfe, (for I seeke not to be altogether free'd,) I haue a mind not onely to teach others, but your selfe also; vvho for so many years, haue studied nothing else, what that life is, which may truely be call'd a life. Attend you as you doe, to maintaine, and preserue your selfe, in this your weake constitution: to the end that we may visite our countrie houses together, and at ease, range vp and downe, here and there, in our Litters. I haue beene longer then I vse to be; not through the aboundance of my time, but out of loue: you hauing halfe inuited me in a certaine Epistle, to write somewhat, which might make you not repent, that you were not at the sports.

                  e him, to draw the warre out at length. Whereunto sometimes hee consent

With a new Armie, raised in diuerse places, hee ioyned battaile, with tough and lustie souldiers. Whereupon remaining vanquished, and hauing lost, euen his lodging Tents, alone reproachfully, hee betooke himselfe to flight. And this was my end of the warre: it appearing vnlikely to mee, that being so broken, wee could rest victors, in 
                     •
                  hat wee were not equall, when we were most entire. I departed from that warre, wherein it was necessarie, either by fighting to die; or to light vpon some trecheries; or fall into the hands of the vanquisher; or haue recourse to King Iuba; or to bee retir'd into voluntarie banishment; or else make choice to kill my selfe. Certainely nothing else could thereon ensue; being neither willing, nor daring, to put thy selfe into the Conquerours hands. But of all the foresaid discommodities, there was none more tollerable then exile; especiallie to him that is innocent; when no further infamie concurr'd therein: and when you are depriu'd of that Cittie, where you can behold nothing without griefe. I made choice to liue amongst my friends, (if one may say, that any man hath now right in any thing) & yet I was pleas'd, to be with my friends. I prognosticated what did afterwards ensue. I came home, not with hope to remaine there

very contented; but so there were any forme of a Common-wealth, to be resident as it were in my countrie: if there were not; to liue as it were in banishment. Me thought I had no occasion, to offer my selfe death; yet many, to desire it. For we commonl

and now if this be a Citie, I make account to be a cittizen; if it bee not, I suppose my selfe to bee an exile, in a place, where I remaine in no worse condition, then if I were in Rhodes, or Mitylene. I desir'd rather to haue discoursed of these things with you face to face; but because I saw, I should not so soone finde opportunitie, I thought good now to write them: to the end that if you chance to bee in any place, where any speake sinisterly of me, you may know how to defend me. For there are some, who, though my death would no waies aduantage the Commonwealth; yet they thinke it a great sinne, that I doe liue. And these men, I am certaine, thinke the number of them that were slaine in this warre, to be very small: who if they had followed my aduise, though with vniust peace, yet with honour, they might haue liued. For they should haue beene inferior in armes onely, but not in equitie. Heere is a longer Epistle then peraduenture you d

But I pray you, shake off these fantasies, and that same humour of returning to a Citie life: and with care, and resolution, striue to obtaine that you hoped for, vpon your departure. And wee your friends will as readily pardon this, as those noble and rich Matrones pardoned Medea, that inhabited in the high Castle of Corinthus: whom, with her white hand, she made beleeue, that they ought not to reprehend her, because she liu'd remote from her Countrey.

Through which aduertisement, I feared much your occasions. But you are much more circumspect in the Art of war, then in pleading. For, though you can swim excellent well, yet you were not willing to swim in the Ocean, nor to see the Charretiers of Britannia: although, when you were at Rome, you neuer fail'd to goe see them run, and manage horses. How effectually I haue written to Caesar in your behalfe, your selfe knowes: how often, I know.

gladder, that he tooke counsell of himselfe, to doe you some good. And if he doe it, or that you hope he will doe it, beare with this warre, and leaue it not. For I, with the hope of your benefit, vvill moderate my desire of seeing you.

I pray tell me my Tribatius, is it money that makes you so presumptuous? or is it because Caesar, so great a Captaine employes you? I would I might die, if I doe not thinke, (such is your vaine-glorie) that you had rather be employed by Caesar, then to bee gilded ouer with gold.

               I Receiued at one instant some letters of yours, that were written at diuerse times: Euery thing pleased me: that you prepare your selfe for this warre; and that you are a worthie fellow. And though at the first you seemed to me somewhat vnconstant; yet I thought not, that this proceeded from a wauering minde, but from an ardent desire to be with me. Giue not ouer therefore, so promising a beginning; passe thorough this warlike employment with an inuincible minde. Assure you, you'le gaine much thereby. I'le renue your commendation: but vvhen the time

shall be fitting. Build vpon this, that you cannot desi

And in testimonie thereof, conceiuing that your lawes doe not helpe you much, I sent you some few daies since, a letter in Greeke, by vvhich you might be ayded. I pray write vnto me, of the successe of the warres of Gallia. For I giue credit, to euery foolish and idle fellowes reports. But as I said, all that you wrote pleased me; onely I maruailed, that you wrote against all common vse; many letters with your owne hand, of one, and the same tenor. For, as for writing to me, vpon r

For I cannot be perswaded, that you would raze out my letters, to insert your owne. Was it happily your meaning to let me know, that your employments, were vnfruitfull, and that you get not so much, as may buy you paper? This is your owne fault, who carryed with you shamefastnesse, and would not leaue it behind you here with vs. I'le commend you to Balbus, when he comes thither, after the Romaine manner, that is, with all efficacie:

I answer'd him, that I was desirous to pleasure him; but that it vvas not possible: and vpon any other daie, when he thought good, I would not faile him. He, knowing that he had a Nephevv, which play'd sweetly, and sang very well, departed from me, so farre as I could perceiue, halfe angrie. You may see the na

haue had no great need of the Sulpicius offices; because your matters were so shefled vp together, that they haue as you write, neither hands nor feete. I would they had their feete, to the end that you might once returne, because you see, that those wittie and ingenious mottoes, so long in vse, are euery day more and more decaying, if wee few, preserue not the auncient Atticke glorie: as Pomponius, who next to you, in promptnesse of wittie sayings, is the chiefest; and I after him, might deseruedly say. Come therefore, I pray you, to the end that the seed of wittie iests may not be destroyed, as the Commonwealeh is extinguished. Farewell.

vnderstand euerie little matter that occurreth. Neuerthelesse, I earnestly entreat you, to hold me for a man, that sets not too much by himselfe, though the paines be not mine, but committed to others: not because, it is not pleasing vnto mee, to be often mindefull of you: notwithstanding all my employments, and naturall slothfulnesse, in writing to my friends, which you are priuie to.

only, and no further, about those conuentions of people beyond Poe; at my returne to Rome, I heard no bodie speak a word of it. Withall, Marcellus propounded not in the Senate, that there should a new gouernour bee sent into the Galliae. He told mee, that in the Calends of Iune, he would propound it. But certainely, hee came very much short of that feruencie, which he shewed, when wee were both in Rome. I would bee glad to know, if you haue found Pompeius, as you desired: what your opinion of him is? what discourses you haue had? and what minde, and resolution it seemes to you, I will not say, that hee hath, but what hee makes s
                     •
                  ew to haue? For, hee vseth to speake one thing, and reserue in his minde to doe another. Although he is not of so circumspect a wit, that hee can so disguise his thoughts, that they may not outwardly appeare. Of Caesar, there is euerie moment some ill newes: but nothing ver

                  fied. True it is, there is great muttering. One saies, hee hath lo

                  t his Cauallerie: which I take to bee most true: Another affirmes, that his seuenth legion was discomfited, and that the Bellouaci haue closed vp the passage, that hee cannot returne to the other peopl

                  e bee no certaintie; neuerthelesse, not being contraried; the vulgar speake thereof: and

some, who you know, withdraw themselues to reason together: and I can tell you, that by this time, Domitius laies his hand on his mouth. On the 13. of May, a rumour was raised by the men of newes, at Penny-lesse Bench, that you were dead: which returneth vpon his head, that dispersed it: so that ouer all Rome, a report was divulged, that you were slaine on your iourney, by Quintus Pompeius. I, that know how Quintus Pompeius is at Bauli, in so great miserie, that hee maintaines his life, by carrying men for hire; was not much moued thereat, and I desired, that all perils that may accrue to you might proue like to this. Your Plancus is at Rauenna, and though Caesar gaue him a great present, yet is hee not in prosperous estate, nor furnished, as it were requisite. Your bookes, wherein you frame the state of an excellent Common wealth, are read of euerie one with admiration. Farewell.

               VVEll, he is absolued. I was there when his absolution was published, and that not onely by

one part of the three, which are to iudge; but by them all: and by all sentences he is absolued. Oh! will you say; speake you in good earnest? 'tis as I tell you. None would haue beleeued it, and it seemes a thing very strange. I, who grea
                     •
                  ly desired, for the amitie betwixt vs, his absolution, rather prepared my selfe to condole with him: but seeing sentence past, in his fauour, I was altogether a
                     •
                  tonished, & it seemed to me a miracle: Then imagine, vvhat it seemed to others. With great exclamations the iudges replied, shewing 
                     •
                  uidently, that it was not a thing to be supported. Whereupon, though he be 
                     •
                  ree'd by the Law Licinia, he seemes to be fallen into a greater danger. Withall, the day after the said absolution, Hortensius presented himselfe in Curio's Theater, as I thinke to be seene, and because we should reioyce with him in his ioyes. But, as many as were there, began to 
                     •
                  rample, rore, to make a thundring, to cry out, and keepe a buzzing: which was the more obserued, because Hortensius was come to old age, without euer hauing beene whistled at
                     •
                   But on that day, he was so soundly handled, as it might suffice any man, for all the daies of his life. Of the Common-wealth, I can write nothing to you. Marcellus irruptions are pacified; not out of neglect, but in my opinion, for

some secret respects. Of the creation of Consuls, not knowing the time, I can giue you no certaine aduertisement. Marcus Octauius, sonne to Cneius, and Caius Hirrus, are competit
                     •
                  rs with me, in the petition for the Aedileship: the one is really noble; the other pretends to be noble, but is not. I was desirous to write this, to put you into greater expectation of the issue, hearing that Hirrus is my concurrent. Neuerthelesse as soone as you are aduertised of my creation, I pray, remember the Pan
                  
                     •

               VVHat will you say now? doe I not write vnto you? doe I not quite contrarie to that you said? Yes certainely, so that my letters come to your hands. And in this, my diligence is the greater; because when I haue time to spare, I cannot haue a better recreation. When you were in

                  Rome, and I had no businesse, I vsed to come, with great contentment to your house, and to passe the houres with you, in sundrie discourses. I would I could now doe so? for in truth, since your departure, me thinkes I am not onely left alone, but that Rome remaines voyd. And wheras before many times (such was my negligence) I let slip many daies without comming to see you. Now in conclusion, I am readie to teare my selfe with my 
                     •
                  eeth, because I cannot be euery day with you. But Hirrus my competitor is the greatest cause, that I desire you, day and night. Oh! if you knew, how this your concurrent in the Augurship, is vexed; and faynes not to see, that my plots take better effect, then his: of which I desire you may be aduertised, for in truth, you would wish it more for your owne respect, then mine. For if I remaine A

                  dile; it may so be, that I shall be created, with some rich associate: But if Hirrus get it not, we shall haue such sport, at his repulse, that for all the time of our life, we shal neuer want matter to laugh at. May this be? so 'tis certainely. Neither can Marcus Octauius in any sort pacifie their hatreds, that are opposite to Hirrus, who are many. As for Milo's goods: I haue so wrought, that Philotimus your wiues free-man hath restored them to his kindred;

Now, it remaines, that I entreat you, that if you haue spare time, as I hope you shall, to direct vnto me some worke: that by this I may know, you are mindfull of me. Questionlesse you'le say; your request is not foolish, but how came this into your minde? I would, that among so many compositions of yours, some one might come to light, which might also be a testimonie to posteritie, of our friendship. For the qualitie of the worke, I referre it to you: for you hauing all knowledge, can best determine of the subiect: In generall I tell you, th

               Marcus Caelius, to Cicero. Epist. 4.
               
               I Enuie you, because you haue euerie day so great newes, as makes you wonder: first, that Marcus Messalla, was absolu
                     •
                  d, and afterwards condemned: that Caius Marce
                        •
                     lus remaines Consull: that Marius Calidiu
                        •
                     
                   after his repulse,

was accused by Marcus Gallius, and Quintus Gallius, brethren: that Publius Dolabella is one of the fifteene. But I enuie you not, because you did not see, how many colours came into Lentulus Crusc
                        •
                     llus countenance, when he had the repulse. For certainely there was neuer a more delight some thing to behold: and peraduenture he thought it would not so haue past with him: and Dolabella himselfe had little hope thereof. But if our Gentlemen had not had their eyes open; vndoubtedly, he had ouercome his sute: and his opposite would almost voluntarily, haue giuen ouer the enterprise. I doe not thinke you wonder, that Seruius, chosen Tribune of the people, should be condemned. Whose place Curio hath demanded: and in their hearts, who know not his gentle disposition, he hath imprinted a strange feare. But as I hope, and desire, and as he makes shew, he will not start an inch from the Senate; nor from the partie of good men: he is now wholly for this. And that he tooke vpon him such a resolution, Caesar was the occasion, who not vsing to respect money for the obliging of euery man to him, how base soeuer he were; seemed to make little reckoning of him. Wherin I thinke, as also by others he hath beene aduertised, that a matter of pleasant admiration ensued, Curio who euer

before had carried himselfe inconsiderately, hauing vsed all his wit, and cunning, to frustrate their designes, which made opposition to him in his Tribunship: I speake of the Laelij, Antonij, and other bragadoshi's. I deferred to write vnto you, because the creation of Magistrates hanging in suspence, I was enforced continually, to attend vnto negotiations: and partly I was desirous to tarry the end; that so I might aduertise you of euery thing; and supposing they would presently be dispatcht, I expected till the first of August. The creation of the Praetors, was prolonged, through certaine impediments. I know not how fauourable fortune will be to me, in the creation of the Aediles Curules. It is true, that in that of the Aediles of the people, manifest signes appeared more in fauour of me, then Hirrus. Of Marcus Caelius Vicinianus I haue no feare. You know how we made a scoffe of him, when he said, that he would put on for the creation of a Dictator. The foole propounded it, and remain'd vilified: and many cries were heard against him. The same people afterwards seemed to haue an extreame desire of Hirrus: I say to pleasure him ouer the shoulders. I hope 'twill not be long, ere you vnderstand that from me, vvhich you expect, and that of him, which I durst scarcely hope for. As for the state

of the Common-wealth, we did not hitherto looke for any new matter. But the one and twentith of Iuly, the Senate being assembled in the temple of Apollo, and debating of the stipend that should be giuen to Pompeius, there was speech also of those souldiers, which formerly Pompeius had lent Caesar: how many they were; and how many they should be: so that Pompeius being ouercome by a continuall importunity, that some ill tongued followes made to him, was vrged to say, that by all meanes he would call backe the said souldiers out of Gallia. Afterwards he was demanded his opinion, about sending a successor to Caesar: who replied that generally the matter of the Prouinces, should be put off till the said Pompeies return: who was to go to Ariminum, to the Armie: and presently he went thither. I think it will be treated of, on the xxiij. of August: and without doubt, something will eyther be concluded, or some Tribune shall be nominated, that will not refuse the charge. But such an one will be blamed, because Pompeius in consultatation hath said, that it were fit, that euery one should obey the Senate. Neuerthelesse, I am certaine, that nothing will be done, se

               I Know not what your minde is, about the peace of your Prouince, and the countries adiacent. Certainely I stand in great doubt thereof: For, if we could order the matter so, that the greatnesse of the warre, might not exceed the forces of your Armie; and that we might obtaine so much victory, as might serue to get the triumph; and that we might auoid that dangerous, and terrible battaile: great would our happinesse be. Now, if the Parthians stir at all, I know there will be no small matters to doe; and your armie is scarce able to defend

a Passage. But none considers 
                     •

I know you well perceiue, how easie it will bee then to crosse euery thing, and what strife will by Caesar, and those that fauour his cause, and not that of the Commonwealth; be introduced.

               I Know certainely you haue vnderstood, how Appius was accused by Dolabella; but not with that popular disgrace, which I expected. For Appius did not like a foole; but presently when Dolabella came before the Tribunall, he went into Rome, and gaue ouer demanding Triumph: by which he silenced what was spoken of him, and shewed himselfe more expert, then his accuser look't for. Now he hath great hope in you. I know you are rather a friend to him then otherwise: this is an occasion to binde him to you, as long as you list: and, if some enmitie had not fallen ou

                   betwixt you, you might now at your pleasure helpe him; but,

if you be so rigorous to handle him as he deserues: I can tell you, many will thinke, that you haue not conc

                  aled your wrath, with that pur

                  tie of minde, which is expected from a sincere, and faithfull man. And on the contrarie; If you

                     labella. I will not forbeare to certifie you, that Dolabella's wife departed from him, at the same time, when Appius was accused by him. I remember that, which you said to me, when you departed: and I suppose you carrie in minde that which I wrote vnto you. It is now no time to write, more at large: only I would admonish you, that if the course dislike you not, yet shew no signe of your inclination, while you see, what successe he hath in this cause: to the end that the matter being knowne, you incurre not some blame: and assuredly, if you manifest your selfe, it will neither bee with your praise, nor profit; and hee cannot conceale it, for the conueniencie of the thing, conformable to his hope; and because in the present enterprise, it will augment his reputation, especially he being a man, that though he knew it would draw some extreame hurt vpon him if he spake thereof, yet could he hardly k

                  epe it secret. It is said that Pompeius is very fauourable to

                  Appius, so that men thinke, he will send one of his sonnes to speake to you. Here, we absolue euery bodie. And certainely heere haue beene some of the

                     . Our Curio is cold in his Tribuneship as Ice, and I cannot possiblie giue you to vnderstand, how euery one here, stands with their hands at their girdle. If I had not found something to doe, with hosts, and watermen, a great lethargie would haue ceazed vpon al Rome. And, if the Parthians set not you one heate in those parts, we shall still be colder, and colder. Neuerthelesse, whatsoeuer our sleepe be now, I would be loath the Parthians should awake vs. It is said that Bibulus encountred with the enemie, on Mount Ama
                        •
                     us; and that he hath lost, I know not how many companies of souldiers. I told you Curio was as cold as Ice; now, I tell you, he begins to be heated, and so toyles himselfe, that he is enflamed. For when he saw he could not obtaine time to pay his debts, hee plaide a prettie pranke: he is gone from the Senates side, to the people, and hath vndertaken to speake in sauour of Caesar. Besides hee hath

diuulged, how he determines, to enact a law vpon the waies, not vnlike to that of Rullus, about the deuision of ground; and another vpon meates: conformable to which the Aediles must beare themselues: which yet he had not done, when I wrote the first part of this present epistle. Be pleased to interesse me in Appius fauour, by this occasion of assisting him; and as for Dolabella, I aduise you to let the matter hang doubtfull, both in respect of the same Appius; as also for your honour; and not to bring you into ill opinion with men. It is, and will be your disgrace, if I haue not Panthers out of Graecia. Farewell.

And hee knew verie well, what would ensue thereon. This presentation hee would not put vp against others, but onely against his accuser. And, although he had none, that would subscribe to the accusation, yet hee came before the Tribunall, and accused him.

Afterwards comes Appius the younger, driuen, as it were, with a most violent winde of feare, lest Seruilius should bee left so bare, that hee could not pay him 24. thousand Crownes, which hee pretends to be due vnto him by this right; that his father being accused by Seruilius, & comming to an agreement with him, gaue him the said summe; to the end, he should not proceed against him in worser matters.

                  ore the Calends of March: but that after the Calends, hee would thinke thereupon: And being demanded, what if any man should then oppose? he answered; that it should be as much as if Caesar should suborne one, not to suffer the Senate to delib

                  rate; as if openly hee should deny to obey it. And what if he, (said another) would be Consull, and keepe the Armie too? he replied, free from choller. What if my sonne, would

giue me the bastanado? By these words it was collected, that Pompeie, and Caesar were not of accord. Whereupon, Caesar, as I perceiue, will now discend to one of these two conditions; either to remaine in the gouernement of the Gaules, and so being absent he cannot demaund the Consulship: or else obtaining it, he will depart. Curio sets himselfe wholly against him. I know not what he can doe. But I see, that he aymes at a good end, and therefore cannot be ruinated. He shewes me great courtesie. But the present hee made me, will redound to my losse. For if he had not giuen me those Panthers, which were brought out of Africa, for his sports; peraduenture I had neuer entred into this dance. But seeing I am entred, and that I must celebrate my sports: I put you in mind of that, which so often I haue written; that you'le procure me some Beast, from those parts. And I commend vnto you the credite I haue with Sitius. I haue sent Philo thither my free-man, and Diogenes Graecus: who will speake to you in my name, and deliuer you my letters. I recommend them both vnto you, and the cause for which I sent them: the which, how much it imports me, you shall see in the letters, that they shal present you.

               DOe you thinke that Hirrus remain'd scorned? but you doe not well know all. For if you knew how easily, and with how little paines I put him downe, you would blush; calling to mind, how he was sometimes so impudent as to concurre with you. And after this repulse, he laughes with euery man: to counterfeit a good Cittizen, he speakes against Caesar: he blames the Senate, for being so slacke to deliberate: he followes Curio with ill words: what needes more? this repulse hath made him change nature. Besides this; though he neuer appeared in the Forum, and hath little practise in pleading: yet is there not a more courteous aduocate then he. He entertaines and followes euery cause, but seldome after noone. I wrote vnto you, that on the xiij. of August, the matter of the Prouinces would be determined: but because Marcellus chosen Consull for the yeare following, was of another opinion, it is put ouer to the first of September. The Consulls were so farre from doing any thing els, that they could not bring many Senators to Counsell. I sent not these, before to day, which is the second

of September: and hitherto no course at all is taken. For any thing I see

I would not haue you thinke, that Fauonius hath not had their fauour, who sell their voyces at a price, but he found none of the better sort of Cittizens fauourable to him. Your Pompeius sayes openly, that he will neuer permit, that Caesar shall hold his Prouince, with an Armie and be Consull: neuerthelesse, he gaue councell, that the Senate should not for the present, enter into any other deliberation; and

Calidius in defending himselfe, was most eloquent, in accusing another, rather cold then otherwise. Farewell.

                     •
                   the newes, which by the letters of Caius Cassius, and King Deiotarus, we vnderstood. Cassius writes, that the Parthian souldiers haue passed Euphrates: Deiotarus, that they came into our Prouince, by the countrey of the Comagens: There was none more vexed then my selfe, and that for your cause: knowing that you are ill prouided in your Armie, and fearing least this commotion, might cause some preiudice to your honour, for I should feare your life, if you had a greater Armie. But because it is but little I imagine, you will not ioyne battaile, of which necessitie, I know not what construction will be made. I c

                  nnot certainely, rid my mind

of this care, till I vnderstand that you are come into Italie. But this newes of the Parthians passage, hath raised vp diuers opinions. Some giue counsell, to send Pompeius thither: others, that he should be retain'd at Rome: othersome, that Caesar should be sent with his Armie: and others, that the Consuls should repaire thither. But no man is of opinion, that this enterprise is to be committed to priuate Cittizens. And the Consuls fearing least, the Senate should send them, or conferre this charge vpon some other to their disgrace, vse all meanes to preuent a session of the Senate. So as they appeare not to be very careful, in the necessities of the Common-wealth. But this negligence, or cowardise, or feare, whether we may call it, is couered with reasonable pretexts, making shew that they refuse the Prouince, out of modestie. Your letters are not yet arriued, and, if those of Deiotarus, had not come so suddenly, men were about to beleeue, that Cassius had fayned the Parthian warre, and caused the Arabians to ouer-runne his Prouince, to the end it might seeme endamaged not by him, but by the enemie. Whereupon, by my aduise, you shall write with diligence, and warily, how matters there passe: to the end it may not appeare, that either you haue followed any mans humor,

or concealed any particular of importance. Now the yeare is at an end; for the xviij. of Nouember, I wrote these presents, I see not how any thing can be concluded before Ianuary. You know how cold, and slow Marcellus is: and in like manner, how sl

So that hauing respect to the nature, and fashion of euery one; you should thank the three forementioned, and Curio: them, because though they spake not in your fauour, yet they shewed a good minde, and being able to offend you, entred into no opposition: Curio, because he interrupted the course of his owne actions for your sake. Furnius,

Curio is resolued to expose himselfe to any disaster, rather then suffer this: and hath giuen ouer all his other enterprises. But our friends, whose humor you well know, dare not come, to the triall. The somme of all is this. Pompeius, to shew that hee labours

not against Caesar, but constitutes that which he thinkes to be but reason, saith, that Curio seekes to raise discords. But he will permit by no meanes, and feareth much, that Caesar will be elected Consull, before he haue left the Army, and the Prouince. Curio treates him very crossely: and speakes hardly of his second Consulship. I conclude, that if the Senate extend the vttermost of their authoritie to suppres

But what did I? I spake presently with some Friends, who were witnesses of my deserts towards him: And when I saw my selfe of so little esteeme with him, that he would not vouchsafe to come vnto me and excuse himselfe.

Pompeius hath now such a weake stomacke, that almost nothing can bee

                  ound to please him. The Senate had decree'd, that hee who would not dismisse

his armie, & the prouinces, could not stand for the Consulship: which, how it will please Pompeius, when hee perceiues, what will become of the Common-wealth, if he either cannot, or care not; I leaue for you old, rich men to consider.

               IF you had taken the King of the Parthians, and vanquished the Citie of Seleucia, it were nothing, in respect of the being present at these things. Your eyes would neuer haue pained you more, if you had but seene Domitius countenance, when hee had the repulse for the Augureship. The contestation was great, each party hauing many fauours. Few respected merit; euery one assisted his kinsman, or friend. So that Domitius is my great enemy: insomuch, as hee hates not that acquaintance of his, whom you wot of, as he doth me: and the rather, because he thinkes he had wrong done him; and that I was the principall occasion of the iniurie. Now, he is starke mad, that men so reioyce at his crosse, and that I was so fauourable

to Antonius. Afterwards, he accu
                     •
                  ed Cneius Saturninus, the younger; one, questionlesse, for his life past, infamous. And now the issue of this triall is expected. And he conceiues good hopes, because Sixtus Peducius was absolued. Concerning the sta
                     •
                  e of the Common-wealth, I haue written many times to you, that I can yet discerne no peace. And the more this controuersie encreaseth, further then is conuenient, so much more imminent the danger appeares. Pompeius is resolued, not to suffer Caius Caesar to bee made Consull by any meanes, before hee leaues the armie, and the Prouinces: vpon which the cheefe of the Citie will contest, that Caesar, except he first giue ouer his armie, and the one, and other G
                        •
                     llia, shall not bee created Consull. On the contrarie, Caesar is of a constant opinion, that he leauing the armie, his ruine will ensue. Yet he offers this condition, that both of them should leaue off their armie. And so, that loue, and discommendable vnion, turnes not into secret hatred; but to a manifest war. I know not what side to take, and I thinke for the same cause also, you will be much perplexed. For one part I loue, and am beloued: in the other, I hate the opinions, not the men: and I think you know, that euerie one followes the more honest part, while they proceede

without armes: But when they come to a war, the strongest; supposing that to be most honest, which is most secure in this discord: I see, that Cneius Pompeius will haue the Senate and Iudges of his party; and to Caesar, all those will apply themselues, that liue in feare, or with cold hopes. The armies will not be equall: but there will bee time enough, to consider the forces of either part, and to choose the best. I had almost forgot to write one thing to you, which was not to bee omitted. Know you, that Appius the Censor does miracles? Know you, that hee abates the pompe of statues, and pictures? that hee allots the measure of land? that hee constraines debtors to pay? hee thinkes the Censorship, is either paste of beane-floure, or niter: but in my opinion, he is deceiued: for, minding to purge himselfe of filthinesse, he opens all his veines, and all his bowels. Run, I beseech you, for Gods and mens sake, and come quickly to laugh at these nouelties; that Drusus is constituted Iudge of the accused, by the Scantinean Law: and Appius is about statues and pictures, I'le promise yee, you haue cause to come in haste. 'Tis thought Curio hath done very wisely, in permitting a stipend to be giuen to Pompeius. To conclude, will you know, what I iudge must fall out? If one of them go

not against the Parthians, I see cruell discords will arise, which must bee ended with the sword. Either of them hath a great minde, and great forces. If infinite danger had not therin concurred, Fortune had prepared for you, a great, and pleasant spectacle. Farewell.

               When did you euer see a more foolish man then Cneius Pompeius; who vsing to promise so many things, hath raised so many disorders? But when did you either read, or heare, of one more prompt, and couragious in an enterprize, then our Caesar, and more temperate after victorie? But what will you say to this other thing? If you did but see our souldiers now, who haue done nothing all the winter, but march in the raine, and winde, thorow difficult and cold places; you would thinke they had eaten of the most delicate apples, that could be gotten.

I haue a thousand things to tel you. I am afraid, lest, as many times it fals out, I shall haue forgotten them all, when I see you. But what offence haue I committed, that I must now goe towards the Alpes? And to goe thither about the Intimelij, who, for a matter of nothing are vp in armes? Bellienus, seruant somtime to Demetrius, borne of a mayd seruant; who was there with some strength, tooke one Domitius, a Gentle-man of that towne, and a friend to Caesar: and hauing receiued money of the contrarie party, caused him to be strangled. The City rose vp in armes; whereupon I must now goe thither thorow the snow, with two thousand Foot. Certainely, will you say, the Domi

who was borne of an hand-mayd, was against this other. Salute your son in my name. Farewell.
            
            
               Marcus Caelius, to Cicero. Epist. 16.
               
               I Felt my life leaue mee, in reading your letters: by which I vnderstood, that none but melancholly thoughts possest your minde. And though you haue not cleerely layd open your meaning; neuerthelesse, you haue made manifest, what your disposition was. I presently wrote these letters vnto you. I pray you, my Cicero; I coniure you; by the care you haue of your own state, by the loue that you beare to your children, that no resolution come into your minde, by which your own safety, or that you possesse, may incurre any danger. For, I call Gods to witnesse, I call men, and our entire amitie; that I neuer foretold, or put you in minde of any thing, which proceeded not from deliberate counsell: but since I spake with Caesar, and by him vnde
                     •
                  stood, what his determination was, after victorie obtained: I gaue you therof aduertisement. If you suppose, that what

                  Caesar was in the prosecution of his courses, the same he will bee in pardoning his aduersaries; your conceit deceiues you. Euery thought of his, is cruell and rigorous, and also euery word. Hee departed angry with the Senate. These oppositions of the Tribunes of the people, vext him verie much. I assure you, hee will open his eare to no humiliations. Wherefore, if any affection towards your selfe, or to the onely son you haue; if of your family, or any other thing within your hopes moue you; if you haue any respect to vs, or your son in law, so honest a man; you should not disturbe their fortunes, by imposing a necessitie vpon vs, of hating or abandoning that part, on whose victorie our saftie depends; or, by being an occasion, that against your preseruation, we beare wicked resolutions. Finally, you must consider, that what displeasure soeuer you could shew to Pompeius, you haue absolutely done it him, in this your delay. Now, if you thinke to stir against the Conquerour; whom, while euents were doubtfull, you neuer went about to offend; and to accompanie them that are now put to flight, whom you would not follow in time, when they made resistance: 'tis the greatest folly of the world. Take heed, whilest you count it shame, with little care to prosecute

the office of a good Citizen, lest you be carelesse of your owne good. But if I cannot absolutely perswade you to what I would; at least attend, till aduertisements come, of the successe in Spain: the which I can tel you, at Caesars arriual will be ours. Wheron their hopes will depend, when Spain is lost, I cānot perceiue. And being so; what reasō should perswade you, to ioyne with desperate people, I cannot with my selfe imagine. This your intention, which, without telling it, you intimated to mee, was now come to Caesars eare: and as soon, as hee had saluted mee; what hee had heard of you, he presently told me. I said, I knew nothing. Yet I entreated him, that he would be pleased to write vnto you a letter, which might perswade you not to leaue Italie. He takes me along with him into Spaine. For if this were not, before I went to Rome, I would come poasting to you wheresoeuer; and being present with you, I would feruently haue discharged such an office; and with all my power r

                     •
                   and that you put not your selfe wittingly into that danger, out of which you see there is no hope for you any way to escape. And if the cries of Cit

If you thus dispose of your selfe, I shall iudge that you haue done wisely, and you shall not herein offend Caesar. Farewell.

But I would to God, that either Appius Claudius had not beene of your part, or Caius Curio of ours; whose friendship hath drawne me to that side, which maintaines the more vniust cause. For I know, that hatred, and loue haue bereaued me of my best senses. And you also, when I came to you by night to Ariminum, performed the office of an excellent Cittizen, but not of a Friend; giuing me commission to treate of peace with Caesar, without aduising me at all in that, which concerned me. Neither thinke I speake this,

as fearing that our part shall not vanquish: but certainely 'tis better to die, then see these men. And were it not for feare of your crueltie; we had long time since, beene expelled from hence

Because, you go before me, and euery man else in prudence. I thinke all secret things are manifest to you: you neuer erred. Who is so

quicke-sighted, that walking through such darkenesse, may not stumble somtimes? and yet I bethought my selfe long since; that it had beene good, to goe into some part; not to see, nor heare, what is heere done, and spoken

                   But after I had considered with my selfe; I imagined, that whosoeuer met me, would surmise at his pleasure; or else, if he suspected nothing, he might say; This man either feares; and because he is afraid flyeth: or he hath some proiect in his head; and a ship readie prouided. In conclusion, hee that suspected least ill, and knew me peraduenture more inwardly; would thinke that I bare hatred to certaine persons, and that I left Rome, for no other cause, but by reason I could not suffer mine eyes to behold them. These cogitations haue detained me in Rome hitherto: besides, that leng

                  h of time, hath by little and little caused as it were an insensibilitie of minde to grow in me, so that it feeles no longer. You haue vnderstood the reasons that kept me in Rome. Concerning your courses, I am of opinion, 'twere good for you to staie where you are, till this exultation be somewhat abated: till it bee knowne what end the warre hath had: for I make no doubt but ended it is: and it auailes much to vnderstand, after victorious successe; what disposition

the Conquerour manifested. Though I may imagine it: yet I expect to vnderstand it. If you will follow my counsell, you shall no

                  parting from hence, it be thought we are retired into those places, rather to mourne, then to bath our selues. But herein, I referre my selfe to your wisedome: I thinke good that we tie our selues to this resolution, to liue together in our studies, and so much the rather, because whereas before, we studied onely for contentment of minde, now we are reduced to such a point, as without the sustentation of letters, our life would faile vs. If any would make vse of our counsell, and endeauour, to recouer the consumed bodie of the Common-wealth; then indeed, leauing studies, wee must runne to the performance of so worthie an office; And fortune denying vs this wished occasion, to practise in the Senate, and Forum; wee will

                  race the foot-steps of those so learned, ancients, partly composing as they did, about the true form, of liuing well, and gouerning iustly: partly also in reading their workes. By which studie, if we cannot otherwise, we shall benefit the Common-wealth. This is my opinion. I should be glad, that you would write vnto mee,

what resolution and opinion you are of. Farewell.

                   But what should I write vnto you? that which I thinke you desire; that I will shortly come to visite you. Although 'tis a matter to be considered of, how conuenient it is; that now when the Cittie is so ouerladen with miseries, we should goe to the Bathes; which are places of solace. We shall minister matter to them to talke of, who know not; that by changing of place, we neither change life, nor

But what remedie? in retiring our selues to a reposed life, now when all men are employed in wicked and bad actions, should we regard the being censured? I resolue constantly to contemne the ignorant vulgar, and to follow your footsteps. For though our m

of the infirmity makes vs the better to know the necessitie, or want of Physicke; whose efficacie we did not discerne, while we were healthfull. But what do I? The writing of these things to you; in whose house they properly growe, is a carrying (as they say) of Owles to Athens. But I wrot them for no other end, but to giue you an occasion to write vnto me something backe againe; and to acquaint you with my comming. Therefore answere, and expect me. Farewell.

               KNow, that of things possible, I hold the same opinion with Diodorus: and therefore if you are to come: I say it is necessary that you come: and if you are not to come; on the contrary; I say, that it is impossible you should come. Now to this purpose, examine whither be the better opinion, this of Diodorus: or that of Chrisippus, which pleased not our Diodorus very well. But wee'le discourse together of this argument, at a more conuenient time. Which according to Chrisippus, is possible to happen; but it is not for all that, necessarie. As for Costius, it contented mee well, and I had giuen commission also

therein to Atticus. If you come not to vs, we wil come to you flying. Let there be a garden in your Librarie, [and] it is no matter for the rest. Farewell.

               YEs indeed will it be a very fit time on the seuenth of the moneth, both in respect of the Common-wealth, and for the season of the yeare. Therefore I am pleased, that you made choice of this day, to which I also referre my selfe. They who followed not our course, we see they now repent them: and though they should doe otherwise, yet should not we repent vs. For wee went to the warre, not out of hope to ouercome, but through a desire, to discharge our duties to our Countrie: and when we left it, we abandoned not our duties, but a desperate enterprise. And so we had a greater care of our honour, then they that neuer stir'd from home: and more wisedome then those, who being vanquisht, and defeated, would not returne home. But aboue all things, it grieues me to see our selues so bitterly checkt by them, that neuer went out of Rome: and howsoeuer the matter be: I more esteeme those, that were slaine in

the warre, then these men, who repine, that we suruiue. If I haue any time to come to Tusculanum, before the prefixed day, I will see you there: if not, I will finde you out in Cumanum: and I will send you word thereof before, that the Bathe may be readie, at my comming. Farewell.

But notwithstanding he hauing written that he would come, as I remember, into the Alsian territory: his friends wrote backe againe to him, that he should not come: For many would disturbe him, and he many: and that it were better for him to arriue at Pontinum. I knew not, wherefore it imported him more, to arriue at Pontinum, then about Alsia: but Hirtius told me, he had vvritten of it to him: and that Balbu

you. I meant to aduertise you of his comming, to the end, you might know in what place, or rather in which of these two places, you should prouide you of a lodging: for it is not certainly knovvne, where he will arriue. And I did it also, to informe you, that I am familiar with these men; and that they make me partaker of their counsels. Which, I cannot perceiue, why it should not like me. Although I support what is necessarie to be supported: yet it followes not, that I should commend that, which is not praise worthie. Though I know not, what I may not commend; besides the first occasions. For, what afterwards ensued, f

Oh, we liue, in a turmoyled Common-wealth. I cannot denie it; but let them take care, that haue not prouided for any kind of life. And to come to this point, I haue extended my selfe, further then I would.

resigne ouer vnto others, all the riches of the world. But I doe what I can to imitate you, and with singular contentment, I liue in the repose of studies. And why should not euery man graunt vs, now the Common-wealth, neither can, nor will employ vs, that we may retire to letters? The which, I know, by many learned men, (vvith what reason I cannot tell) were preferred before the Common-wealth. If therefore in the iudgement of famous men, we may rather applie our mindes to these studies, then to the gouernment of publicke affaires: how much more now, when the common-wealth her selfe is content therevvith, may vve follow them hourly?

themselues to your occasion, giuing ouer, while you are there, their ordinarie disposition. Which, if it be true; I maruaile not, though euen heauen, & earth leaue their vsuall properties, for your commoditie. I send you the briefe Oration, which I made in defence of King Deiotarus: which I knew not to be about me. The subiect is very mean, and almost vncapable of ornaments; nor verie worthie to be set downe in writing. But because Deiotarus is my guest, and a friend of many yeares standing; I thought good to send him, this poore present, as a garment of a grosse graine; like those presents, he was wont to send to me. I aduise you to shew, wi

               I will answer two of your Epistles: one, that I receiued three daies since from Zethus; another, which Philerus the Poaste brought me. By the first, I vnderstood, that you were well pleased, to heare me so inquisitiue of your sicknes. And I am glad, that you conceiue my affection towards you: though I assure

you; that you could not so well apprehend it by my letters, as it is in effect. For, perceiuing my selfe to be honoured, and beloued of many; (for I cannot say otherwise;) amongst all those, there's not any one, more deare vnto me then you are: not onely because you lou

                  nceipts, especiallie with ours of Rome: which heretofore lost a great deale of their lustre, when our Citie came to be ouer-thronged with forraine nations; in that the tittle of Cittizens, which then was belonging only to the Latin

I see you, me thinkes I see all the Grani

                     , all the Lucilij, and also to speake, as it is, all the Crassi, and Laelij. I would I were dead, if besides your selfe, I see any left me, in whom I can discerne any similitude of those ancient pleasant straines of wit. Whereunto adding, so great loue, as that is, which you beare mee: doe you wonder, that I was so t
                     •
                  oubled for your grieuous, and dangerous maladie? And whereas in the other Epistle you excuse your selfe, by saying, that you neuer diswaded me, from the purchase that I would haue made at Naples, but that you aduised mee to continue at Rome: neither did I euer vnderstand it otherwise. In deed I conceiued that, which by these letters I apprehend, that you 
                     •
                  hought it was not good for me, as I also thought, to depart from hence; not altogether; but yet with a determination, to returne hither seldome. You speake to me of Catulus, and of those times. What conformitie is there? Then, it disliked me to remaine long time farre of, from the custodie of the Common-wealth. For we sate in the sterne, and gouerned the Rudder: but now we haue scarcely any place about the pumpe. Do you thinke now, though I shall bee at Naples, that for this cause they will forbeare, to passe decrees in the Senate? when being at Rome, & attending to publicke affaires;

the decrees of the Senate are registred in a friends house of thine, my familiar; and when they please, they subscribe my name thereto, as if I had beene present. And I sooner heare of some decree, transported into Armenia, and Syria, which seemes to be passed according to my minde, then word is deliuered to me thereof. And thinke not, that I speake this in 
                     •
                  east: Because you must note, that letters are alreadie brought mee from the farthest distant Kings that are; wherein they thanke me, for giuing them in the Senate, the title of Kings: the which I had not onlie, not done; but scarcely knew there were any such in the world. What must be done then? So long as this our master of ceremonies remains heere, I will neuerthelesse doe as you counsell me: when he is gone, I'le come to your Mushromes. If I shall haue an house; the charge which the law limiteth vs for one day, I'le distribute into ten: but if I cannot meet with a scare, that contents me; I am determined to lie with you. For I know I cannot better gratifie you. About Silla's house, I had now almost lost all hope, as I last wrote vnto you: but yet I haue not altogether lost it; I should be glad, that you as you write, had viewed it in the companie of some Masons, for if there be no fault in the

walles, or the roofe, the rest will like me well enough. Farewell.
            
            
               Cicero to Papirius Paeto. Epist. 16.
               
               YOur letters pleased me: and first, I was glad to vnderstand, that the affection you beare me, induced you to write vnto me, doubting lest Silius, with the newes he brought m
                     •
                  e, might haue put mee to some trouble of minde. About which thing, you wrote before vnto me, twice after one manner: so that I easily conceiued your dislike: and I had diligently returned answer thereunto, to the end, that so well as in such an occasion, and time I was able, I might, at the least, in part, if not altogether dispossesse you of your sorrow. But seeing in these last letters also, you shew what a care you haue of it: be assured of this, my Paeto, that, whatsoeuer could bee done with Art, (for now councell s

                  ed, and procured with all diligence possible: and in my opinion, very successefully.

For, I am so honoured, and reuerenced by them, to whom Caesar wisheth well, that I beleeue I am beloued of them. For, though I could hardly discerne true loue from fained, except vpon some occasion, wherein, as gold by the fire, so true loue may bee tried, and knowne by some danger; for other, are but common signes: neuerthelesse, I build vpon this, rather then any other thing, to thinke, that I am heartily, and 
                     •
                  ruely beloued: that, both my fortune, and theirs is such, as there is no cause to dissemble. Then, as for him, who is Lord of all, I see not why I should feare; except in that, there is no security, where reason hath no authority. Neither can one promise any thing certaine to himselfe, where, on others will (not to terme them appetites) euery thing dependeth. Notwithstanding, I haue not offended his minde in any thing: and therein I haue carefully vsed all my dexterity and prudence. For, as other whiles I thought, that it rather appertain'd to mee, then any other, to speake freely; as to him, that had beene a preseruer of the common liberty: so now, seeing it is lost, I thinke it not fit for me, to speak any thing, wc may offend either Caesars minde, or his friends. But, if I should omit the occasion, of some excellent saying, I should lose the opinion conceiued of my wit: the which,

if I could, I would not refuse to doe. But yet Caesar himselfe hath a very good iudgement. And euen as your brother Seruius, whom I take to haue beene very learned, would readily say, this verse is not of Pl

them, I say, that a wise man should not bee bound, to render accompt of any thing, but of offence: from which I perceiue my selfe free, two wayes: First, because I alwaies had an vpright mind: next, in that when I saw, there was no meanes to defend our opinions, my conc

Neither am I displeased, that like a bad souldier, you haue loaded me with apples: but I am sorrie, that I could not come thither, as I determined. For, not for few daies, but continually, I would haue lodged with you. And thinke not, that your dish of wine and honie, should more haue seru'd my turne; From an egge to roasted veale, that is, from the beginning of supper, euen to the last, you should haue seene me rauen like a

Wolfe. You were wont to commend me as a man easily to be satisfied, and with a slender meale: now, I am whollie chang'd. For now, I thinke no more on the Common-wealth; nor, what opinion I

So that, bee prepared: you haue to doe with a man, that can eate soundly, and that now at length vnderstands somewhat: and men that haue learned late, you know how troublesome they are to content: and you must forget your banqueting dishes, and daintie Cakes.

troth, verie courteouslie, and louinglie entertaine me. After this my visitation, I shut my selfe vp to my studies: either I compose something, or else I read. Some also come to heare me, as a learned man, because I am a little more learned then they are. Afterwards, all the rest of the time

               Cicero to Papirius Paeto. Epist. 22.
               
               I Loue the modestie; but rather the libertie of speech. And Zeno was of this opinion, a very ingenious man questionlesse; but greatly opposite to our Academians: But as I say, the Stoicks are of opinion, that euery thing should bee called by it owne name: affirming, that in it, is neither obscenitie, nor inciuilitie: and they proue it by this argument. If there be any obscenitie in speech, it must needs be either in the thing signified; or the word signifying; it can be no where else. In the thing signified it is not; And therefore we see, that not onely in Comedies, the act is plainely expressed, as it is: whereupon Lucilius in his Demiurgus, brings in one vttering these words: which peraduenture you haue heard vpon the stage, & you may call to mind Roscius, when he recited them. He left me lately naked in such fas
                        •
                     ion: where the speech in respect of the words, is altogether modest; as for the matter, a little inmodest. But in Tragedies

also: what thinke you of that verse;

                     What woman's that, that I seelie with him?

                     Who with another did desire to lie?
                  
               
               And of this;

                     How could this man, be so presumptuous:
                     As to enioy great King Phereus wife?
                  
               
               Or of these other:

                     Though I vnwilling, once in maids estate,

                     •
                  her word, signifying the same thing: but it would haue sounded too immodest. You see therefore, that a thing is not dishonest that is vttered with honest words: and yet the words alter not the signification: which is a signe, that euery thing is honest by nature. And therefore, if there be no dishonesty in things, much lesse in words. So that, if the

                  hing signified be not dishonest, the word that signifies, cannot be dishonest. You doe not say anus, but you

                  Cauda, or taile: but at this day, the word Penis, is accoūted among strude words, or dishonest: & Piso Frugi in the book

                  s of his Histories complaines, that young men are dedicated to [that] Penis. That which in your Epistle, you terme by it proper name, hee couertly cals penis. Which word being growne common to so many; is now accounted as dishonest, as that you vsed. Now, what shall we thinke? Whereas vulgarly men say: Cu
                        •
                      noste volumus conuenire. Appeares it not obscene to say, Cum nos? I remember that a wise Consular, speaking in the Senate, vttered these words: Hanc culpam maiorem, an illam dicam? Could he haue fallen into greater obscenitie? You will say it was no obscenitie: b

                  : and, that things make it not, it is manifest by that which I haue before deliuered. We must therefore conclude, that the same not being in words, nor in things, is no where. To endeuour to get children, is so honestly spoken, that Fathers themselues are wont to put their children in minde thereof: but the proper

                  Terni, we speake not vnmannerly; but when Bini, it is immodest. To the Graecians, you'le say. There's therefore no dishonestie in the word: For I vnderstand Greeke also: and yet I say vnto you bini: and you performe it, as if I had spoken it in Greeke, and not in L

                      Ruta, and Menta be honest words: but if I would terme the little Menta, after the same manner as we say Rutula, it would not doe well. You say, bell

                      tectoriola: giue me therefore the diminutiue of pauimenta, 'twill sound ill. Now you see, al these are but fooleries: & that there is no obscenitie in words; much lesse in things; from whence it followes, that it's no where. Therefore let vs couch dishonest things vnder modest words. For I would know; is not Diuisio a modest word? but some immodest sence is included in it: and Diuisio belongs to the agen

                  ; intercapedo to the patiēt. Are such words vpō this occasion, dishonest? And we cockscombs, if we say, This man strangled his Father, we put not in before, Sir reuerence: but if we would nomina

                     ini cannot bee so modestly spoken. And not onely words, but things also, are sometimes honest, sometimes dishonest. To say, suppedit, is an obscene speech: but let a man speake it of one, that is naked in a Bathe, and 'tis not obscene. You haue heard the Stoickes reasons. If you bee wise, you'le speake ciuillie. I haue made a long tale, vpon one word onely of your Epistle: I am glad, that you take leaue to speake with me, without respect. I like, and euer will like to follow the modestie of speech: as Plato accustometh. Whereupon I haue treated of this argument, with shrouded words, which the Stoickes handle very openly: but these men affirme also, that farting should be as free, as belching. I haue therefore vsed

               THough I had bin offended by this Rufus, your friend, of whom you haue now twice written vnto me: yet would I not forbeare to fauour him, in what I were able; seeing you are so

carefull of his occasions: but hauing now both by your letters, and also by those which he sent me, gathered and iudged, that hee entirely affected my safetie; I cannot but be a friend vnto him; not onely for your recommendation, the which, as reason requires, is of great force with me; but wi

                  alousie, and the diligence, that I vsed in looking carefully to my selfe; grew from your letters: to which the letters of many others, were afterwards conformable. For both in Aquinum, & Fabrateria, there were practises against me; which I see, you came to knowledge of. And they, as it were, presaging, how troublesome I should be vnto them, minded nothing, but to oppresse me. Whereof, I hauing no iealousie, peraduenture I might haue fallen into some danger, if I had not beene by you aduertised. And therefore this your friend, with me, needs no recommendation. I desire nothing now, but that the fortune of the commonwealth proue so, as he may acknowledge me for an excellen

you, to your old custome of seasting? Regard your health: wherein nothing will more helpe you then to go often abroade to supper. But if you wish me well, suppose not, though I write ieastingly, that I haue laid a

Be perswaded of this my Paeto, that day, and night, I attend and sollicite, no other thing; but that my Cittizens may be safe, and enioy their libertie. I omit no occasion to admonish, endeauour, and prouide. I haue finally propounded to my selfe, to repute it for my greatest Fortune, if need were, to lay downe my life, in this care, and administration. Once more Farewell.

Whereupon I am resolued to obey your precepts: and moreouer, to haue a little barke readie vpon the coast. And they say against the Parthian Cauallerie,

there cannot be found a better armour. But why iest we? You know not with what a Captaine you are to buckle. I haue put in practise, whatsoeuer I read in Xenophons Cyrus, which booke I had worne out with continuall reading. But wee'le ieast another time at our meeting; and ere it be long, as I hope. Now come to be commanded, (as the old saying was) or (to speake more plainely) to obey me. I hold an inward amitie, with Marcus Fabius, as I thinke you know: and I loue him exceedingly; first, for the rare bountie, and singular modestie, I discerned in him; then, because in these controuersies, which I entertaine, with the Epicureans, your table associates; I am wont to reape from him great furtherance. He comming therefore to me at Laodicea, and I desiring, that he would remaine with me; he was presently stroken with terrible letters; wherein was written: how the H

Now, see if you can lead a better life then this? You once brake a iest vpon a Philosopher, who exposing himselfe to resolue any doubt should bee propounded to him: you demanded of him, where you might get a supper, that might dure as long, as from morning to night. The silly man thought, that you would haue demanded of him, whether there were but one, or innumerable heauens: What good was that to you? But tell me truely, did the supper doe you good? especially from a Philosopher? Now this life passe wee: euery day, we read, or write somewhat: then; to entertaine time also with our friends, we meale together; yet not so, that our inu

insolent, (for many haue this defect) but so wicked, and cruell, as hee would not, that any man, not onely in words, but not so much as in shew, should enioy a freedome. Whereupon, I remaine in great perplexity; not about my life; to which, by yeeres, and endeuours; and, (if it ought auailed) I may tell you, that euen with glorie also, I haue giuen satisfaction: but I greeue for my Countrey, and principally, for the expectation of your Consulship: which is so prolonged, as wee may desire, [but] to liue till that time. And what hope remaines, if all matters bee bee ouerswayed by the armes of

                  he most insolent, and most vnbridled man that liues? If the Senate, and people, be of no force? If the authority of the Lawes, and Tribunals, is fallen? If there bee no more, either forme, or foot-step of a Common-wealth? But because it imports not, that I should write vnto you all particulars: they hauing been specified vnto you by others: I will acquaint you with that, which loue moues mee to tell you of, which I haue borne you from your child-hood; and haue euer, not onely preserued, but augmented it: remembring, and exhorting you, to embrace with all study and care the Common-wealth: which, if it continue till the time of your Consulship, it will be no great trouble to gouerne

it: but to procure, that it may so long continue; there is required, not onely speciall diligence, but also no little fauour of Fortune. Y

And besides that I am bound, to giue assistance to the Common-wealth; your honor doth so neerely touch mee, that I will therein employ all my councell, endeuour, offices, labour, paines, and diligence, to augment your reputation. By which meanes, I know I shall easily discharge my selfe, both to my Country, which to me is most deere; and to our amitie; which in my esteeme, ought by vs most sacredly to be obserued. I wonder not, but reioyce, that you carrie your selfe towards our friend Furnius, as his courtesie, and place requireth. And be assured, that I will hold that esteeme, of whatsoeuer you doe in honouring, or benefitting him, as if you had honoured, and benefitted mine owne person. Farewell.

your childehood, you bare towards me; and somewhat more, which you haue written to that purpose, afforded me infinite contentment. On the other side, it was pleasing to me, to behold; how well you were disposed, both now, and euer to assist the Commonwealth. And this my contentment was the greater, because it was annexed to the masters aboue mentioned. Wherfore, I doe not onely exhort you my deare Plan
                        •
                     us; but effectuallie I entreat you; as I did in those letters, to which you so courteouslie made answer; that, with all your vnderstanding, and the whole force of your minde, you will studie to procure the good of the Commonwealth. There is nothing, that can redound to your greater benefit, and glorie. And of all worldly things, there is not any one more excellent, and honourable, then to be beneficiall to our countrie. I speake freely to you, because I thinke that you, like an affable and wise man, will accept of it as hitherto you haue done. By the helpe of Fortune, it seemes you haue obtained great honors. The which, though without vertue, you could neuer haue atchieued: yet, in all mens opinion, Fortune, and the qualitie of the times, haue had the greatest hand therein
                     •
                   But now, that the commonwealth stands so afflicted; euery helpe which you

shall administer, will only be attributed to your selfe. It is an incredible thing, how odious Marcus Antonius is to all Cittizens; except to those, who together with himselfe, haue betrayed their countrie. We hope much, in you, and your armie, and promise much to our selues vnderstand, I beseech you, how to apprehend the oppor
                     •
                  unitie of such a Fortune, and so great glorie. I admonish you as a sonne: I wish the same to you, that I doe to my selfe: If I incite you to Action, my countrie, and the great loue I beare you, moues mee thereunto. Farewell.
            
            
               Cicero to Plancus Imperator elected Consull. Ep. 6.
               
               THe matters which our Furnius hath deliuered touching your affection towards the Commonwealth, were verie acceptable to the Senate, and highly pleasing to the people of Rome. But the letters openly read in the Senate, seemed not to confront with Furnius speeches: For in them you exhorted to peace; now, when Decimus Brutus your colleague, a 
                     •
                  enowned person, is beleaguered by wicked Cittizens: who; armes being laid apart, either ought to

seeke peace; or, if they demand it with armes in hand, this peace must be obtained with victorie, and not by way of accord. But Lepidus letters, and yours, concerning the perswasion of peace; how farre they were accepted of, you shall vnderstand from your brother, an excellent man; and from Caius Furnius. I, for the affection I beare you; although you neither want counsell, neither is the loue and prudent fidelitie, of your brother, and Furnius, euer like to faile you: neuerthelesse, infinite reasons of 
                     •
                  ur Friendship leading me thereunto, am also mooued, out of the interest I haue in you, to set you downe some instruction. Beleeue therefore, my deere Plancus, that all the degrees of honour, you haue hitherto obtained, (and you haue enioyed the greatest) will be no true honours, though they carrie the title, If you ioyne not your selfe with the libertie of the people of Rome and the authoritie of the Senate. Many in the commotions of our Common-wealth, were Consuls: but he that wrought nothing worthy of his Consulship, was neuer held for Consull: Such an one therefore, it is fitting that you should be. First, that you fall off from the league of wicked c

                  tizens, much vnlike your selfe; Then, that you resolue, to be head, principall, and conductor of the Senate, and all

good men: [and] lastly, that then you iudge it to be a peace; not when armes are laide downe; but when all feare of armes, and 
                     •
                  eruitude is remoued. If you performe, and approue of these things, you shall then not onely bee Consull, and Consular; but also a great Con
                     •
                  sull, and a great Consular. But if otherwise; these so much reputed titles of honor, will not onely not honour you; but call vpon you great dishonor. The loue I professe vnto you, hath made me peraduenture, to write too freely; but you shall vnderstand, that I haue spoken the truth, if you make thereof but that triall, which is requisite. Farewell.

Certainely I felt extreame griefe, seeing others enioyed the possession of praise: But I would attempt no enterprise, determining to prepare my selfe thereunto after such a manner, that I might atchieue something, which might be worthie of my Consulship, and your expectation. And if Fort

I beseech you be fauourable to my dignitie; and endeauour, that those rewards may bee yeelded me, which you propounded vnto me in recompence of my commendable labours: which doing, you shall more incite me heereby, to the defence of my countrie.

the Common-wealth; and in not laying my selfe open, I might haue greater oportunities to doe you seruice; I made choice to haue a regard to common safetie, more then to mine owne estimation.

                  y: which I know now, to be very eminent, and will also be so hereafter. For I assure you, that more acceptable letters then yours, were neuer recited in the Senate. And this happened, both through a singular greatnesse, of the good, that you haue done in the Common-wealth; and also, through the grauitie of the words, and sentences. Which questionlesse, seem'd

no new thing vnto me, who was well informed of your valour; and called to minde, what you promis'd me, in the letters you sent me; and had fully also by our Furnius beene aduertised of your designes. But the Senate, apprehended greater matters, then were expected: not that it euer doubted of your disposition, but it had not full information, neither what you were able to doe, nor what you intended to attempt. Wherefore Marcus Varisidius, hauing deliuered me your letters, on the vij. of Aprill in the morning; I tooke, in reading them, infinite contentment: and a great multitude of excellent Cittizens accompanying me out of my house, I presently made them all partakers of my contentation. Afterwards came our Munatius, out of his wonted custome, to see mee, and I shewed him your letters; for as yet he knew nothing, because Varisidius came first to me: and he said, that so you appointed him. A little after, Munatius gaue me those letters to read, which you sent both to him, and to the publicke state. We thought good presently, to goe and present the letters to Cornutus, Praetor of the Cittie: who, because the Consuls were out of Rome, according to the auncient custome, supplyed their place.

The matter was referred ouer to the next day. Seruilius came prouided with an vniust minde, euen against Ioue himselfe: in whose T

               HAuing written these letters, I thought it imported the common-wealth, that you should vnderstand what followed. My carefulnesse, as I hope, hath produced good effects, both to my selfe, and to the commonwealth. For by daily meanes, I wrought with Lepidus, that al priuate contestation laid apart, and being reconciled with me; with ioynt affection we might succour the commonwealth; and that he should make more account of himselfe, of his children, and of his countrie; then of a wretched, and base robber: and that in so doing, he should dispose of me in all things at his pleasure. I haue therefore obtained my purpose by the meanes of Laterensis. He hath giuen me his fidelitie, that he will persecute Marcus Antonius with armes, if he cannot keepe him farre from his Prouince. Entreating me withall, that I would approch, and ioyne my forces with his. And so much the rather, because it was reported, that Antonius was strong in Cauallerie, and Lepidus hath but a small troope of horse: and of those few he had; not many dayes before, ten of the best came away from him, into my

Campe. Which when I heard, I made no delay, supposing it requisite, that I should ayd Lepidus, while he had so good an intention. I saw, what benefit my arriuall would procure, either because with my Cauallerie, I might pursue, and defeate Antonius horse; or because that part of Lepidus armie, which had beene seduced, and alienated from the Common-wealth, by the presence of my Armie, might be bridled, and kept vnder. Whereupon, making a bridge, in one day, ouer Isara, a great r

If the fortune of the common wealth afford vs neuer so little fauour, we shall here make an end of the insolencie of these rascalles, and our owne trouble. If that theese, vpon our comming begin againe to retire himselfe into Italie; It will be Brutus part to confront him: to whom I know, neyther courage nor counsell will be wanting. Notwithstanding my selfe, if this happen, will send my brother with the

horse, to pursue him, and to defend Italie from forraging. Haue a care of your health, and as I loue you, loue me. Farewell.

                  ANtonius the xv. of May, came with his vaunt-guard into Forum Iulij. Ventidius lies two daies iourney from him. Lepidus is expected at Forum Voconij. Which place from Forum Iulij, is foure and twentie miles distant. There he meanes to attend me, as he hath written to me. Whereupon, if no alteration

grow, either from him, or Fortune; vpon my credit, I promise you, presently to accomplish this enterprise, according to your desire. I wrote last vnto you, how my brother, ouercome with continuall trauaile, and posting vp and downe, was grieuously sick: neuertheles so soone as he was able to march; esteeming that he was recouered, not so much for himselfe, as for the Common-wealth, he refused not to be the formost in all dangers. But I haue not only exhorted, but enforced him, to repaire thither: first, because being yet weake, he might rather preiudice himselfe, then further me: and then; because I thought that the Commonwealth remayning naked by the lamentable death of the Consuls, might haue need of such a Cittizen to be Praetor in the affaires of the city

Lucius Gellius, one of the three Segauian brethren, hath made me vnderstand his good disposition therein: and last of all I haue vsed him as a meanes with Lepidus. Of whom I willingly

giue testimony, and will euer render it to them that deserue well. Be carefull of your health, and loue me in the same manner, that I loue you: and take my honour to your protection, as hitherto most louingly you haue done.

               I Should bee ashamed of the inconstancie of my letters, if it had not growne from anothers leuitie. I haue assayed all meanes, to vnite my selfe with Lepidus, in defence of the Common-wealth: to the end, that with your lesse mol
                     •
                  station, wee might bee

able to resist wicked Citizens. All things he demanded, I haue promised, and proferred him of mine owne good will. And I wrote vnto you two dayes since, how I trusted, that Lepidus would helpe me; and follow the warre with common consent. I gaue credit to the letters of his hand, vpon Laterensis affirmation, being present: who then was with mee, and entreated mee to bee reconciled to Lepidus, and to giue him credit I could not long conceiue this good hope of him. I looked narrowly to the matter; and will bee carefull, that through my credulitie, the State of the Common-wealth suffer no detriment. Hauing passed the riuer Isara with my armie, a bridge being in one day made ouer the same, and vsing expedition therein, according to the importance of the businesse; hee hauing requested mee by letters, that I should hasten my comming; his messenger came to me, with other letters; wherin he aduised me, that I should not come: for, hee could performe the seruice of himselfe: [and] in the meane while, I should stay for him, at Isara. I will lay open vnto you the rash course I had meant to haue vndertaken. I, notwithstanding was resolued to goe; imagining, that he was not desirous to haue anie companion in the glorie [of the seruice. Yet] conceiuing that he

was beyond measure, ambitious of this honour: I would not attempt any thing therein, but onely lye in places neere hand; to the end, that if need required, I might be able without delay to succour him. This I simply cast in my head: but behold, Lat

               I Will neuer repent, my Cicero, to haue vndergone great perils, for my countrie; so that, when any misfortune befals me, I may not be taxed with temeritie. I would confesse I had erred through in discretion, if I had euer of mine own head giuen credit to Lepidus: for credulitie is rather an error, then an offence: and indeede it easilie fals into the minde of all honest men. But this was not the defect that had almost deceiued me. For I knew Lepidus too well. What was it then? the regard of my honor, which in the warres, is of great importance, vrged me to expose my selfe to this danger. For if I should not haue vnited my selfe with Lepidus, I feared, least some maligne fellow might haue suggested, that I made more account of that priuate enmitie which was betwixt vs, then of the interest of the Commonwealth; and also

that I nourished the warre, by my protraction. Whereupon, I lead my men, almost in sight of Antonius, and L

when hee offered to come, if hee had come; the warre had either now beene finished, or out of Italie; and to their great preiudice reduced into Spaine, which is their greatest enemie. Now, what reason mou'd Octauianus: or who aduised him, that from so great a glorie, and so necessarie for himselfe, and his securitie, he fell off, and turn'd his minde, to demand so foolishly [or with such an insulting importunitie] the two moneths Consulship, to the great amazement of men; I cannot imagine. And as for the present necessitie, I am of opinion, his friends may moue him greatly, no lesse to his owne, then the ben

                  fit of the common-wealth. Your selfe may also doe much, as I thinke: from whom he hath [receiued] as great benefits, as any man liuing, except my selfe. For I will neuer forget, how I stand bound vnto you, for infinite respects, and of greatest moment. I haue enioyned Furnius to treate with him of these things. And if he will beleeue, and follow my counsell, as hee ought: he shall thereby reape a great aduantage. In the meane while wee sustaine the warre, vpon hard conditions. For neither doe we iudge, that we may very securely come to battaile; nor yet, by auoyding it, would we giue occasion, that the Common-wealth might receiue greater preiudice. But if Octauianus
                  
haue any regard of his honour; or that the African Legions come out of hand; Wee will worke so, that you shall bee secure in these parts. I pray you loue me, as you haue begunne; and perswade your selfe, that I am yours as much, as your owne neerest proprieties. This xxviij of Iulie, from the Campe.

And when you think you haue giuen full satisfaction to the Common-wealth; then, I would counsell you, to come out of hand, and demand the Praetorship; in that Praetors are shortly to bee created. But take heede, that this ambitious haste, diminish nothing of that glorie wee haue attained. Manie men of renowned fame, being abroad in the seruice of the Common-wealth, forbare to come to Rome, that yeere, that was allotted them, to stand for Magistracie. Which you should so much the rather do, because this is, not your proper yeere: but if you had been Aedile two yeeres since, then this had beene your yeere. Now, though you should forbeare to demand the Praetorship, it will not seeme that you haue omitted a moment, of the vsuall and ordinarie time of demanding it. And when Plancus shall bee Cousull, though without his helpe, you might easily obtaine it; neuerthelesse, I see, that then your demand will bee, with far greater reputation; so that, matterrs

there succeed, as they are wished. I know 'twas not necessarie, for mee, to speake much to this purpose; knowing you to be wise, and of profound iudgement: but I was desirous y

                  ue shunned it. As

touching that you write vnto mee, about the concord of Plancus and Brutus: I herein repose great hope of victorie. Of the affection of the Galli, wee shall one day vnderstand, as you write, who was the principall occasion. But, I assure you, wee know it alreadie. Whereupon, reading your most pleasant letters, I was, towards the end, a little moued, in that you wrote; that if the creation of Praetors were put ouer to the moneth of August, you would come out of hand: and sooner, if they were created alreadie; not to appeare more foolish with your owne perill. Oh, my Furnius, how ill, you mannage your owne occasions. Considering, that you so easily learne to prosecute another mans. You suppose now, that you are to bee one of the elected, to stand for the Praetorship: and you resolue, either to come in all poste, to be at the Creation, or else it being past, to come, to remaine at your owne house. And this you write, you'l do; affirming, that to proceed anie further in the dangers of the warres, were but a meere folly, for it would cost you too deere. I thinke you speake not in good earnest, knowing you, to bee desirous of true praise. But if your minde bee answerable to your words, I reprehend not so much you, as my selfe, which before this time, could no better looke

into you. To obtaine then a Magistracie before the time, which is ordinarily bestowed on euerie man; and is of no great repu

                  ation, being attained vnto, as the most part doe; would you lose so manie attributes of houor, by which euerie one d
                     •
                  seruedly, extols you to the skies? It precisely importeth you, rather to be made Praetor at this creation, then at that which is to come. The maine point is, that you so steed the Common-wealth, that afterwards, all honour and Magistracie may bee due vnto you. Doe you not see now, to what an high degree you are mounted? or care you not 
                     •
                  or it? If you perceiue it not, I hold you excused: the blame is mine. But if you discerne it; how is it possible, that you can prefer this Praetorship, either before a dutie, which euerie man stands bound to pay vnto his Countrey? though few doe pay it; or to renowne? which vsually is deerest to all men. In this, I, and Caluisius, a verie wise man, and your great friend, condemne euerie day your iudgement. And yet with all our power, wee labour, to prorogue the Creation, till Ianuarie; we iudging, that for manie res

and my courage transporting mee further then my wit, I so effected, that the Senate, now crazie, & languishing, seem'd to reassume its former vigor, & custom. This was the first day, that the people of Rome, moued by the efficacie of my words, and actions, conceiued som

And, if I thought not, that you had particular aduertisement, by some other meanes, of that which passeth in Rome: I, though most busied, would not bee wanting therein, to giue you satisfaction. But I know you shall haue notice thereof, by the letters of some of your other friends: from mee you shall vnderstand some few matters, and that briefly. We haue a worthie Senate; the Consulars partly fearefull, and partly ill affected. Great preiudice did accrue by the death of Seruius Sulpicius. Lucius Caesar carries a verie good mind: but because hee is Antonius Vncle, hee proceedeth not so freely. The Consuls can be no better then they are. Decimus Brutus beares himselfe wondrous well: and so does Caesar the yo

wherein were two cohorts of the Martian Legion, and the Praetorian cohort, beganne to retire, being inuironed with the Cauallerie, wherein Antonius is very strong. When all our squadrons were retired, I my selfe also began to retire vnto the Campe. Antonius as Conquerour, thought he might haue ceased on our Tents: whereunto being come, he there lost many of his men, and did otherwise no good. When Hirtius heard of this successe, with twentie olde cohorts, he came and assailed Antonius, as he returned to his Campe: and hewed all his men in peeces, and put them to flight, in the same place, where they fought at Forum Gallorum. Antonius foure houres after Sunne-setting, with his Corne

               Caius Asinius Pollio to Cicero. Epist. 31.
               
               YOu need not maruaile, that I haue not written any thing vnto you, about the Common-wealth, since the warre beganne. For

Now, hauing found opportunitie, in that they begin to goe by sea, I will very willingly, and as oft as I can write vnto you. There is no feare that I should be moued to discourse of his workes, who, though there be none, that can abide to see him, yet is he not so hated of men as he deserueth. For I so abhorre him, that I account euery thing odious, in which he hath a finger: and my nature, & studies draw me to a desire of peace, and l

                  nning of the ciuill warre. But being enforced to betake my selfe, to one of the parts, for I had great enemies of all sides: I fled that

Campe, wherein I knew I could 
                     •
                  ot be secure, from the complots of mine enemie. Being driuen thither, whither I would not: not to be in the number of the last, I couragiously exposed my selfe to daungers. But because Caesar, in so great a Fortune, hauing knowne me but a little before, held me in that esteeme he held his auncientest familiars, I loued him with the greatest affection and fidelitie I could. Those things which I could discharge according to mine owne minde, I so performed, that euery honest man commended me: and that which was imposed on me, I effected after such a fashion, as it was well knowne, that I did it as constrained, and against mine owne inclination. The hatred of which actions, vniustly borne me, might well teach me, how faire a thing libertie was, and hovv vnhappie that life, which is led vnder an Aristocracie. And therefore if now men striue, that once againe, euery thing should be reduced vnder a Monarchie: whosoeuer hee bee, I protest my selfe an enemie to him: neither is there any daunger, from which I withdrew my selfe, in the prosecu

As also Lepidus, hath vrged me both by his owne, and Antonius letters, to send vnto them the thirtieth Legion. Whereupon, if this Armie which I haue, I would neither sell for rewards, nor diminish, for feare of those daungers, of which, Antonius, and Lepidus, remaining Conquerours, I m

For, I haue kept the Prouince in quiet, and the armie vnder my power. I neuer went beyond the extent of my Prouince, to goe any whither. I neuer sent a souldier into any part, not onely of the Legions, but not so much as of strangers, or those that haue colleagued themselues: and, if I found any horsem

               Caius Asinius Pollio to Cicero. Epist. 33.
               
               
                  LEpidus, by hauing detain'd my posts for nine dayes, was the occasion, that I had more late aduertisement of the battailes fought vnder Mutina; although we ought to desire, that the newes of so great a losse to the Common-wealth should arriue very slowly; especially to them, that can no wayes helpe vs, nor giue vs any remedie. And I would to God, that by the same decree of the Senate, with which you called Plancus, and Lepidus into Italie, you had likewise imposed vpon me to come thither. Vndoubtedly the Common-wealth had no
                     •
                   receiued a wound so dangerous. Whereat, if any at this present reioyce, for it seemes that the Captaines, and old souldiers of Caesars partie are dead: neuerthelesse, they must afterwards needs lament, when they shall behold the ruine of Italie. For the very strength and race of good souldiers is extinguished; if the nevves we heare be in any part true. And I knew it euidently, that if I had ioyned with Lepidus, I should wonderfully haue assisted the Common-wealth. For whereas he hunge off, and was doub
                     •
                  
                  full, what part to cleaue vnto, I would

by all meanes haue perswaded him, to haue resolued on a course, especially with the ayde of Plancus. But he writing vnto me such letters, as you shall peruse; and like to the open speeches, which they say, he vttered at Na

                     •
                  e words, if I meant to get prouision, marching through his Prouince. Besides this, if the battaile had beene fought before I had effected my determination, I doubted that my good intention might by mine aduersaries haue been discouered, & misconstrued; considering the acquaintance I haue had with Antonius: which notwithstanding, was no greater then what Plancus had also with him. Whereupon, at Gades, in the moneth of Aprill, I embarqued two messengers, in two ships, and I wrote vnto you, to the Consulls, and to Octauian, that you would informe me, how I might be best seruiceable to the common-wealth. But according to my accompt, on the same day that Pansa ioyned battaile; on the very same, the ships set out from Gades: For since the Winter, there was no setting of Saile before that day. And in truth not supposing, that any ciuill tumults would haue growne, with a setled mind, I had bille

sought to fight, as if their greatest feare had beene, that the warre could not be ended, without the vtter ruine of the Common wealth But, if the

                  Lucius Antonius possesseth the Alps. Which things if they be true, it is not fit that any of vs, should stand at the gaze, or expect, what the Senate will determine. For euery one that affects the safetie of the Empire, or finally the Romaine name, is enforced to giue present succour; seeing Brutus, as I heare, hath no more, but seuenteene cohorts, and two imperfect Legions of new souldiers, which Antonius had entertained. And yet I make no doubt, but all the remainder of Hirtius Armie will make head with him. For of leuying of new forces, I thinke there is no great hope: especially there being nothing more dangerous, then to giue Antonius time, to be refortified: and the season of the yeare, the rather inuites me thereunto, because the corne is either in the fields, or in the villages. Therefore in my first letters, I will set downe, what I meane to doe. For I will neither be wanting, to the Common-wealth, nor suruiue her. But yet I grieue without measure, that my iourney will be so long, and dangerous; for all aduertisements come to me aboue fortie dayes after the execution. Farewell.

Wherefore, I beseech you, and entreat the gods (O conscript Fathers) that, laying apart all particular hatred, you will prouide for the State of the Common-wealth, and not repute our clemencie, and the mercie of our Armie in a ciuill discord, for disloyaltie.

               IF you be in health, I am glad, for so am I also: Hauing heard, that Antonius, with his forces, sending Lucius Antonius, before with a part of the Cauallerie, came into my Prouince; I departed with my companies from that place, where Rhodanus meetes with other streames, and tooke my way towardes them. And so by a continuall march I came to Forum Vecontij: and a little beyond, along the riuer Argentea I encamped against the two Antonies. Publius Ventidius ioyned with him his three Legions, and pitched his Tents aboue me. He had before that, the second Legion, and out of other Legions a great multitude, but disarmed. He hath a strong Cauallerie: for he lost but few of them, in the battaile: in so much, as they are aboue thirtie thousand horse. So that diuers of his souldiers, both foote and horse, departing

from him, are come to my campe. And day by day, his men diminish

               IF we made any question of your loue and fidelitie towards vs, we would not haue written these things vnto you: the which we are assured you will take in very good part: being, as you are, our friend, and a man of sincerest loyaltie. We are informed by writing, that a great multitude of old souldiers, are now come to Rome, and that the first of Iune there wi

                  l be a farre greater number. If we either doubted or suspected you, we should doe contrarie to our iudgement, and vsuall custome. But certainly, we hauing been in your power; and by your aduise dismissing our municipall friends; and performed this not only by edict, but also by letters; we are worthie to be made partakers of your intention; especially in a matter wherein we are interres

                  ed. Wherupon we request you, to let vs vnderstand, how you stand affected towards vs; and whither you thinke we may liue secure, in so great a recourse of old souldiers: who, as we heare, are determined to set the pillar vp againe. Whereunto if you consent; it seemes not that any man can thinke it well done, that hath any

respect of our honour, and safetie. The successe hath shewed, that from the beginning wee aimed at quietnesse; and sought no other thing but common libertie. None can deceiue vs heerein, but your selfe; which were farre from your worth, and fidelitie. Neither hath any man else any meanes to deceiue vs. For in you onely we haue, and must put our confidence. Our friends though they well know your constancie, yet they are much perplexed for vs; considering that the multitude of old souldiers, may more easilie by any other be excited, then by you curbed. I pray be pleased to answer vs particularly to euery thing. It were a great follie to beleeue, that these old souldiers are called to Rome, because in the moneth of Iune, you were to take order in the Senate, about their aduancement. For, what can you thinke should hinder you herein, being assured, that in this we no waies meane to oppose you? Wee ought not to seeme ouer desirous of life to any man; in that no mischiefe can fall on vs, without the ruine, and confusion of all things. Farewell.

But how this may be supported, Imagine you: that, the Praetors resoluing, for concords sake, and libertie, by

way of Edict; may not leaue their own right in the gouernment they haue, but the Consull should threaten them with armes. It importeth not, that you through confidence you haue in them should goe about to terrifie vs. For it is not well done; nor is it fitting that we vpon any danger whatsoeuer should be frighted. Neither should Antonius seeke to command them, by whose action he himselfe hath freedome. If we were induced by others occasions to raise a ciuill war; your letters could be of no effect: they, bearing little respect to threats, who preferre libertie before all things. But you know well, that we cannot be prouoked to any noueltie. And peraduenture you threaten vs, by reason that what we doe out of iudgement, you suppose proceedes f

But doubtlesse that is true, which I perswade my selfe; which is; that I haue a great place in your heart. I went against the Transalpini with mine Armie, not so much to obtaine the title of Imperator, as to satisfie the souldiers, and confirme them in defence of our cause: the which in my opinion I haue obtained. For they haue had a triall both of our liberalitie, and affection. I haue encountred with people warlike aboue all others: I haue there taken many Castles, and sacked many, I wrote not to the Senate, without iust cause, that they would affoord me the honour of that I sue for by supplications. Helpe me to obtaine it: for you shall performe a matter profitable

                  LVpus our familiar friend being come from your parts; and remaining at Rome some pretie time; I was [retired] in a place, where I thought my selfe secure. For which cause Lupus returned to you, without my letters, hauing neuerthelesse procured me to haue yours. Now, I am come to Rome the ninth of December, and I desired nothing more, then to go presently and finde out Pansa: from whom I heard those things of you, which I desired greatly. Whereupon, though I know that I neede vse no prouocation of words to incite you, hauing of your selfe effected such a matter, as in the memorie of man, there was neuer any more famous: yet I thought good to certifie you briefely, how the people of Rome, expect all things from you; and that in you it reposeth all hope, that once it shall recouer it lost libertie. Now, I make no doubt, that, although day, and night you should call to minde, (which I am

sure you doe) how great a matter you haue accomplish'd; [yet] you cannot be forgetfull, how great those things are, which you must yet compasse. For if it should so come to passe, that Antonius, should depriue you of Gallia; (to whom doubtlesse, I was euer a friend, till I perceiued, that he not onely openly; but also wilfully, makes warre against the Common-wealth;) there would remaine no refuge for our safety.

Finally, you should make shew, that first you held all the olde souldiers, your war-associates, for fooles; rus

                  end the safety of the Common-wealth. The will of the Senate must bee held for authority, when authority is by feare hindered. Last of all, you haue now twice taken the enterprise vpon your selfe: Wherefore, you must sticke to what you haue done, First, the thirteenth of March; and then againe lately; because you assembled a new Armie, and new forces. And therfore you must be so prepared, and prouided for euerie thing, that you stand not vpon commission, in performance of euerie seruice: but, that you effect those matters, that may with wonderfull admiration, of euerie man, haue allowance.

I will take a course, that Antonius shall not be able to stay in Italy. I'le pursue him without delay. These two things I hope to compasse: That neither V

Aboue all, I entreat you, that you would send to that same wauering, or inconstant Lepidus, to the end he may not renew vs the warre, by colleaguing himselfe, with Antonius. For, touching Pollio Asinius, I suppose you conceiue, what he resolues on. The Legions of Lepidus, and Asinius, are verie manie, and mightie. Neither write I these things vnto you, because I know not, that you in like manner haue them in consideration; but, because I am assured, if peraduenture you should be doubtfull; that Lepidus will neuer perfo

And if it seeme, that I speak this, to apply my selfe to the qualitie of the times; I desire your iudgement, rather then all theirs of th'other side. For you, without all passion, and according to truth censure me: which they, hindred by extreme malice, and enuie, doe not. But let them gaine-say at their pleasure, that I may not bee honoured: so they prohibite not, that I may conueniently execute the affaires of the Common-wealth. The which, in how great danger it is, I will explaine vnto you, with the greatest breuitie I can possible. First, what a confusion growes in the Citie, by the death of the Consuls, and what a passion

men enter into, when that Magistracie is uacant, you know sufficientlie. I make account I haue written to the full of those matters, that may bee committed to letters, for I know to whom I write. Now I returne to the businesse of Antonius. Who, after the discomfiture, finding his power to be but a small band of disarmed foot: by setting the bondmen at libertie, and pressing by force all sorts of men, hee hath drawne together a good number of souldiers. Whereunto the force of Ven

                  llerie, which he hath in abundance, to sacke those parts, which hee scowreth: or to retire againe into Hetruri
                        •
                     , because that quarter of Italy, is without anie Armie. But if Caesar had past the Appenni

                  ght Antonius to that streight, that hee should rather by famine, then by sword, haue perished. But neither can wee command Caesar, nor Caesar his Armie: which are two difficulties of

great consequence. Now matters standing in these termes, I care not though men, in respect of my selfe, as before I wrote, doe crosse me. But yet I feare, that either fit prouisions cannot bee made, or, that when you shall make them, some obstacle will bee interposed. I can no longer pay the souldiers. When I took in hand to free the Common-wealth, I had more then foure millions in readie money. Now, I haue not onely not anie part in mine owne substance; but all the friends I had, I haue engaged. I giue maintenance to seuen Legions; with what difficultie, imagine you. If I had Varro's treasures, I could not defray the charges. As soon as I haue anie certaintie of Anton

               FRom this time forward, it will not be fit, that I should thanke you with words. For, if I can hardly with effects, returne you equall merit; how should I thinke with words, euer to be able to requite you? I pray you consider well, how matters now stand: for, being wise, as you are; reading diligently my letters, you shall vnderstand euerie thing: I could not, my Cicero, pursue presently Antoniu
                        •
                     , for the reasons I shall alledge vnto you. I was without horse; without beasts for carriage; I knew not that Hirtius was slaine; I

could not bee confident of Caesar, before I came vnto him, and had talked with him; The first day passed after this manner. The day following I was by Pansa called earely to Bononi
                        •
                     . Being on the way, newes came, that hee was dead. I posted presently to my poore companies; for, so I may truely terme them. They are wondrous bare, and through want of all things, in maruellous ill condition. Antonius got two daies iourney before me, making much more way in his flight, then I, in his pursuite: for, he fled at randome, and I followed in warlike ordinance. Wheresoeuer he passed, he set slaues at libertie, and tooke by force, whomsoeuer he could: hee staid in no place, till he came to Vada: which place I wil discypher vnto you. It lies between the Appennine and the Alpes, and is almost impassable. I being some 30. miles off him, and he hauing alreadie combined his forces, with those of Ventidius, an oration of his was brought vnto mee: wherein hee began to entreat the souldiers, that they would follow him beyond the Alpes, by reason he held correspondencie with Lepidus. At this, shouts were raised, and principallie by Ventidius souldiers, (for, of his owne, he hath verie few) that they were resolued to die, or vanquish in Italy. And moreouer, they began to importune

him, that hee would goe towards Pollentia. He, not being able to withhold them, gaue order for his going thither, the day following. When I heard this newes, I presentlie sent fiue cohorts to Pollentia, before they should arriue there, and tooke mine owne way thitherwards. Trabellius arriuing with his horse at Pollentia, found my men, which I sent to defend it, there, an howre before: whereat I much reioyced. For, herein I thinke, consists the victorie. They conceiued some good hopes: for, they neither supposed, that Plancus fowre Legions, were equall to all their forces: neither did they thinke, that an Armie could so speedilie be conducted out of Italy. Against whom the Townes-men hitherto, ioyned with the horse I sent before, haue of themselues couragiously resisted: and at my arriuall, I hope they will yet more valiantlie oppose themselues. But if peraduenture Antonius should passe the riuer Isara, wee will labour with all our power, to make such defence, that hee may doe no hurt to the Common-wealth. Be of great courage, and good hopes, about the interests of the Common-wealth, seeing, that both we, and our Armies, vnited with singular concord, are prepared for all enterprizes, in your behalfe, and seruice. Neuerthelesse, you must vse your wonted diligence,

and procure, that there want neither men, nor anie other thing, which the necessitie of war requireth, to the end, that with better confidence, we may fight for your safetie, against this impious conspiracie of our enemies: who, on a sudden, haue turned those forces against their Countrey, which in long time, vnder colour of the Common-wealth, they had collected.

Neither doe I doubt but you are quicker sighted. But, the festiuitie being so fresh in memorie,

which by vs in your name, through all the temples of the gods was celebrated; the renouation of feare, brought great disturbance. And therefore, I could wish, as I hope it will succeed; that Antonius were wholly abandoned and ouerthrowne: but if by misfortune, he hath recouered any force; that he might be made to perceiue; That, neither the Senate wants counsell, nor the people of Rome courage; nor, (while you liue,) the Commonwealth a Generall.

                      Segulio, a man most like himselfe, told me he had been with Caesar, and how they had a long discourse of you: that Caesar did not any thing complaine of you; but onely sayd that you should say, that the young man was to be praised, honoured, and taken off: And that he would not suffer himself to be taken off. But I beleeue

that either Labeo reported these wo

                  ds vnto him, or else, they were not vttered by the young man, but rather feyned by himselfe. Besides this, Labeo would needes make me beleeue, that the Veteranes, spoke hardly of you, and that some ill would happen you by their meanes: and how they tooke it in despight; that neither Caesar, nor I, were elected among the Decemviri: and all things went onelie thorow your hands. Hearing this, and being vpon my waie, I thought good not to passe the Alpes, before I first knew, what was done there amongst you. For, of your perill, be assured, that if they can but daunt you wi

And all this deuise, depends on the designe they haue, to gaine much. I would therefore haue you circumspect, and keepe your selfe from all embushments. For nothing can be dearer, nor sweeter to me, then your life. But take heed, that feare, be not occasion of a greater feare: and be fauourable to the Veteranes, wherein you may. First, concerning the Decem-viri, doe what they would haue you. Then, for the remunerations, if you thinke good, procure that I, and Caesar, ma

To the foure Legions, to whom you minde to allow partitions of land, or grounds, I see you may well allot them those of Silla, and the Territorie Campanum. I am of opinion, 'twere good to distribute vnto the Legions their lands equally, or by lot. And thinke not, that I am mooued to write these things vnto you, to shew my wisedome.

I hope to haue a braue armie, for all accidents whatsoeuer, and to resist any violence that shall occurre. Caesar sends me not backe, that Legion of the armie which Pansa had. Answere me presently to these letters: and if there be any secret of importance, which you thinke fitting for me to know. Send to me of purpose one of your people. Farewell.

But neuerthelesse, my Brutus, I thinke my selfe as I ought much bound vnto you; in that you would haue mee know of these fables, be they whatsoeuer. For this was a speciall note of loue.

to his hand, he hath deuoured, and digested with a witnesse. Then, whereas you write, that being no wayes affraid for your selfe, yet you feare for my sake. I, my Brutus, whom I esteeme the best man, and dearest friend that can be found, will not haue you feare any thing at all for me. For in those things which may be foreseene, I shall not be deceiued: and for those, which cannot come to notice, I care little.

                     me, which was for a long time, & the course of my life vnlike to yours,

(I hauing liu'd in pursute of honours) permitted not, that our mindes might with stronger knot be vnited through conuersation. Neuerthelesse, I knew well your good affection towards mee many yeares before the ciuill warre, when Caesar was in Gallia. For you procured, that he wisht me well; honored me; and held me for his owne: the which you thought, could not but turne to my great benefit, and to Caesar himselfe rather profitable then otherwise. I omit, many things, which in those times, we were wont most familiarly to talke of, write of, and communicate. Because there are other poynts of farre greater consideration. I remember also that in the beginning of the ciuill war, when you went towards Brundusium, to finde out Caesar, you came to me in Formianum. First, what esteeme ought to be made of this onely demonstration, especially in those times? Then, doe you imagine, I can forget your discourse; councell; and affection? At which, I remember, Trebatius was present. Neither are your letters out of my mind, which you sent vnto me, at that time when I came to meete Caesar, (if I be not deceiued,) in the territory of Trebula. Then ensued that time, when I was constrained either by the zeale of mine honour, my dutie, or fortune, to goe to Pompeius. What office,

or fauour left you vnperformed, eyther towards me absent, or my friends present. Whom did all my friends finde more kind to me, and them, then your selfe? I came to Brundusium: Now thinke you, that I haue forgotten with what celeritie you came flying to me, so soone as you knew it, from Tarentum? How great loue shewed you me, in your societie; discourse; and rectification of my minde; which was ouerlayed with extreame affliction, for the miseries of my countrey? Finally we began againe, to be resident together in Rome, where, in matters of great consequence, about the manner, how I should proceed with Caesar, according to your aduise, I demeaned my selfe. And in other offices, you did afford this fauour to Caesar, and my selfe onely; to come daily to our houses; and often to spend many houres, in acceptable discourse. At which time, if you remember, you vrged me to write these Treatises of Philosophie. And after Caesars returne, you intended nothing more effectually, then to make me domesticall with him: Which you obtained. Now, to what end haue I made this discourse, larger then I thought to haue done? For this respect; because I much wondred, that you who cannot but remember these things, could beleeue, that I had wronged our friendship.

For besides these which I haue related, which are cleare, and euident, I haue many secret passages, which with words, I can scarcely explicate. Your whole carriage giues me satisfaction; but aboue all, I am best pleased, partly [with] your singular fidelitie in friendship; your councell; grauitie; and constancie: and partly [with] your mirth; humanitie; and learning. Wherefore now I returne to your complaint. First, I did not thinke, you had giuen your consent to that Law. Th
                     •
                  n; had I so thought, [yet] I should neuer haue thought, you had done it, without some iust occasion. Your dignitie is so eminent, that all mens eyes are fixed on you; and mens malignitie is the cause, that there is more liberall speech of you, then were befitting. And, if you doe not heare of these mutterings, I know not what to say. I, for my part, when it is my chance to heare them; defend you so farre, as I am sure, you are wont, to defend me against my aduersaries. And I defend you two wayes. Some things there are, which I am accustomed absolutely to denie: as particularly; for this giuing of your voyce: some, which I demonstrate that you haue out of zealous loue, and tendernesse performed: as in that, about the charge of publicke sports. But you, who are most learned, know well, that

if Caesar were a King, as I suppose he was, you may for the office you vndergoe be both praysed, and blamed: praised; because your faith, and humanitie is to be commended, for louing your friend after death; which reason I am wont to vse: blamed; because our Countries libertie should be preferred before the life of a friend; vpon which your aduersaries ground themselues. I much desire, that the controuersies I haue had about these clamors, might be related to you. But amongst others, there are two speciall particularities in your commendation; which no man infe
                     •
                  s more willingly, or oftner then my selfe: which is, that you perswaded more then any other, that the ciuill warre might be withstood, and the victorie moderated. Wherein I neuer found any m
                     •
                  n, that was not of my opinion. Wherefore I thanke our Treba

                     ius, who was the cause, that I wrote vnto you these letters. To which if you giue no credite, you must needs iudge me very discourteous, and inhumaine: which would wōdrously displease me; and differ much from your owne disposition. Farewell.

Neither, did I euer approue the ciuill warre, much lesse the occasion thereof: hauing in the very infancie o

(say they) because you dare question that, that we haue acted: Oh pride, neuer heard of! that some may vaunt in their impietie, [and] others cannot so much as mourne without their ouerthrow. And yet in all ages, seruants haue beene allowed, to feare, to reioyce, and to grieue, rather when they sawe good, then any other. The which libertie, they now, which make profession, to haue giuen it vs, (for so they often report) seeke violently to depriue me o

                  , by threatnings. But they labour in vaine. There shall be no danger so terrible, that shall make me halt in my dutie, or humanitie. For I haue alwaies held, that an honorable death, should neuer be auoided, but rather oftentimes desired. But why should they be angrie with me, for desiring them to repent them of what they had committed? I confesse, I would haue euery man to be greeued for the death of Caesar. Oh, But I am enioyned by the office of a good Cittizen to desire the safetie of the Commonwealth. That this desire is in me, if it be not knowne without my relating it, both by those things which h

                  BE assured Cassius, that I neuer cease to think vpon you, and our Brutus, that is, of the whole Cōmonwealth; which hath reposed all her hope, in you, and Decimus Brutus. And certainly from this time forward, I begin to conceiue better hopes: seeing may Dolabella hath performed such materiall seruice to the Common-wealth. For that euill, which sprung vp in the Citie,

continually dispersed it s

                  lfe, and euerie day so encreased, that for my part, I held both the Citie, and the peace of Citizens, vtterly lost. But it is so stop't, that, as for that reprochfull danger, I suppose, wee may liue for euer secure. Other th

                  ngs, that yet remaine to bee acted, are important and many: but you must be the man, that must effect them al: Though we are intentiue to dispatch those, which are of greatest moment. For, touching that which hath hitherto beene done; wee haue freed our selues of the King; but not of the Kingdom. For, though the King be slaine, yet we put all that in execution, which the King appointed to be performed. And not onely this; but some things also, which hee himselfe, if hee had liued, would not haue acted; wee approue because hee designed them. And of this, I know not when wee shall see an end. New Lawes are propounded: exemptions are granted: great taxes imposed: banished men are restored: [and] false decrees of the Senate are produced: so as it seemes, that the hatred onely of that wicked man, and the greefe of seruitude is remoued; but the Common-wealth is still torment

Great commendation is ascribed to you, and Brutus; because men iudge, that you haue, beyond all hope, raised an Armie. I would write more at large, if I knew how things stood, and in what estate you were. And what I now write vnto you, I write out of the opinion of men, and according to fame.

               I Suppose, that hitherto the winter hath beene some hinderance, that we could not heare certainely, what you did; and least of all, where you were: neuerthelesse, euerie one affirmed, (out of their desire, as I suppose) that you were in Syria, and had forces. Which, was the more easily beleeued, in that it seemed probable. Our Brutus hath made

                  urchase of singular praise: hauing performed such great ma

                  , besides their being acceptable of themselues; they are, for the expedition vsed therein, much more welcome. Wherefore, if those places bee in your power, which wee suppose; the Common-wealth is fortified with great defences. For, euen from the first limits of Greece, as far as Aegypt, wee shall be assisted, by excellent Citizens, that gouerne those quarters; and by their people. Although (in my opinion) matters were at that passe; that all the danger of the warre seemed to bee in Decimus Brutus: and we hoped, that hee would free himselfe from the asseige, by which hee is inuironed; and valiantly come out into the field; which, if it fall out,

the war will be thought ended. Howsoeuer, he was now at length beleaguered but by a few men. For, Antonius had a great garrison in Bononia; and at Claterna, was our Hirtius; and Caesar, at F

And the Transpadani, your Clients, stood wonderfully for vs. The [whole] Senate, (besides the Consulares,) was most resolued: of whom, there is onely Lucius Caesar, that is most constant, and who aimes directly at the publique good.

               Cicero to Caius Cassius. Epist. 7.
               
               WIth what care, both in the Senate, and with the people, I haue defended your honour, I had rather you should vnderstand from other friends, then from my selfe. Which sentence of mine, in the Senate, would easily haue preuailed, if Pansa had not violently opposed it. This sentence being deliuered, Marcus Seruilius, Tribune of the people, brought mee to speake vnto the assembly. I deliuered of you, what I could, in the audience of so great a multitude, as the Forum was able to containe; with such a shout, and consent of the people, as I neuer saw the like I desire that you would pardon me, though I did in this against the will of your mother in law. She, being fearefull, as women are wont to bee, doubted lest Pansa might haue beene offended. True it is, that Pansa speaking to the people, alledged, that your mother, and your brother, were not willing, that I should haue denounced such a sentence. But I was not moued with these things: my minde was of another matter: I sought the good of the Common-wealth, which I euer affected, together with your honour, and

estimation. But of that, which I both largely discoursed, in the Senate, and deliuered to the people; I would haue you, to acquit my promise. For, I haue promised, and in a manner confirmed; that you neither did, nor would expect our decrees; but that of yourselfe, according to your custome, you would defend the Common-wealth. And though wee had not yet vnderstood, either where you were, or what Forces were with you: yet I presupposed, that all the Forces, and people, of those quarters, were in your power. And I held for certaine, that the Prouince of Asia, was ere this, by your means recouered. Now beare your selfe so, that in augmenting your owne glorie, you goe beyond your selfe. Farewell.

to war, more then euer. All our hope consists in Decimus Brutus, and in Plancus: but, to speake truth, we haue greater in you, and in my Brutus; hoping that you will not onely preserue vs, if matters here, which God forbid, succeed not; but also establish vs in perpetuall libertie. We heard of Dolabella, that which we desired: but we had no certainetie thereof. For your selfe, be out of doubt, that hitherto you are reputed, a great man: and it is expected, that hereafter likewise, you will make your selfe, knowne for such. Proposing thus much vnto your selfe, labour to come on a pace, to the height of enterprises. The people of Rome, are of o

aduises; and of yours, in these parts, we heare nothing. For as if Asia, were on euery side shut vp, there come no aduertisements vnto vs, but onely a rumor, that Dolabella is vanquished: which hitherto is not verified: though they still talke thereof. When wee supposed the warre ended, vpon a suddaine through your Lepidus, we are fallen againe into exceeding great trouble. And the greatest hop

                  LEpidus your kinsman; [and] my familiar friend; together with others, that revolted against the Common-wealth; were, by common consent of the Senate, the last of Iune, denounced rebells. To whom notwithstanding,

all August was graunted to be thinke themselues. The Senate, questionlesse, is full of courage, and the rather by reason of the hopes they conceiue of your succour. The warre at the writing hereof was very hot: for which we may 
                     •
                  hanke the wickednesse, and inconstancie of Lepidus. We heare euery day that newes, which we desire of Dolabella. But as yet they haue no ground; nor come they from any person worthie of credite. There is onely a muttering thereof amongst the multitude. Neuerthelesse, by the informations of your letters, written from the Campe the seuenth of May; the Cittie was of firme beliefe, that he was by this time suppressed. And that you would come into Italie with your Armie. To the end, that if things here had the same issue, which we desired, we might employ your councell, and authoritie: But if through hard Fortune, they were doubtfull, as it ordinarily falls out in warres; we might be assisted by your armie; which I will helpe to the best preferment I am able. About which, it will then be a fit time to negotiate, when it shall be knowne what ayde it will [now] afford the Common-wealth, and what formerly it hath afforded. For hitherto, their endeuours onely haue beene heard of; extraordinary doubtlesse, and generous: but, the

effect is that, that is expected. Which, I trust, hath in some sort alreadie succeeded: or will succeede very shortly. For valour, and magnanimitie you are aboue all men esteemed. And therefore we desire out of hand to see you in Italie. If we haue but you, we shall thinke we haue a Common-wealth. The warre had beene altogether finished, if Lepidus had not receiued Antonius, who disarm'd, and spo

               IF you be in health, I am glad; my selfe am so. I redde your letters, wherein I perceiue your singular loue towards me. For, you seeme not onely to fauour vs; as, in respect of the common-wealth, and for our owne sakes you euer did: but further; to be verie carefull in our behalfe, and to remaine much perplexed. Whereupon, I supposing you thought, that while the Common-wealth was supprest, we could haue no repose; and that you were much troubled, in that you doubted of our safetie: I had no sooner receiued the Legions, which Aulus Allienus conducted out of Aegypt, but I presently wrote vnto you; and sent many post's to Rome. I also wrote vnto the Senate; but, I appoynted that my letters should not be presented, till you had red them, if my people haue obserued what I commaunded.

souldiers what I promised; [yet] now at length, I find my selfe ridde of care. But, because you know, that I haue refused no perill, nor labour in the seruice of the Common-wealth; And that perswaded, and aduised by you, I haue taken vp Armes, against a faction of wi

                  ll tyrants; (whereof, if Dolabella had bin Commander, he would haue encreased the forces of Antonius; not onely by his going; but with the fame, and expectation of his armie:) let me intreat you to take mine honour to your protection. And, if you conceiue, that the deserts of the souldiers towards the Common-wealth be of exceeding importance: for this, and the causes before alledged, be carefull to ayde, and fauour them. And so procure, that no man may repent him of choosing rather to follow the Common-wealth; then hope of spoyle, and rapine. In like manner, take vnder your pro

                  ection, so far as in you lyes, the honour of Marcus, and Crispus, Imperator's. For, that retchlesse Bassus, would not assigne ouer vnto me his Legion. So that, if the souldiers in despight of him, had not sent me Ambassadors; he would haue kept Apamea beleaguered till by maine

force, it had beene taken. This I request of you, not onely for the Common-wealth's sake, which was euer most deare vnto you; but also in regard of our amitie; which I assure my selfe, you greatly estimate. And be secure, that, this Armie which I haue, is for the seruice of the Senate, and euery honest man, but principally for your selfe. And it both loues, and esteemes you, hearing daily of the affection which you beare it: but if it vnderstand that yo

                   are carefull of their profit, it will also thinke it selfe bound to doe what it is able in your behalfe. After the writing hereof, I heard that Dolabella was come into Cilicia, with his forces. I will make towardes him, and endeuour to certifie you of the issue. I would fortune would graunt me such happinesse, as is answerable to my deserts towards the Common-wealth. Looke to your health, and loue me. From the Campe this seuenth of May.

               I Hope you are in good health, as I was at the writing hereof. First, wee reioyce for the safetie; and victorie of

the Common-wealth; and then, in that your praises are euery day renewed. For, you proouing a powerfull Consular, and greater then when you were Consull, you haue gone beyond your selfe. Whereat wee doe reioyce, but cannot sufficiently wonder. There is annexed to your vertue, something that is fatall, which we haue now many times discerned by experience. For your gowne is more fortunate, then th'armes of other men. Which at this present also, hath wrung the Commonwealth, out of the hands of enemies, and restored it. Now, therefore we shall liue in libertie. Now, we shall haue you, most eminent Cittizen; and my dearest, and (in the aduersities of the Common-wealth) approued friend, I say, we shall now haue you, a testimonie of our loue, both to your selfe, and to the Common-wealth, which is so neere vnto you. And those things, which you haue many times promised, both to conceale, while wee were in seruitude; and to disclose in my behalfe then, when they might be auailable: I now, desire not so much that you should vtter them: as that your selfe would but repute them what they are. For I more esteeme of your iudgement then any mans whatsoeuer: neither desire I that you should commend mee aboue my deserts.

And these our last exployts will not I hope, seeme dissonant from the rest; nor performed vnaduisedly, and without counsell: but conformable to those cogitations, whereof you are witnesse. Wherefore, you ought to adde no little to my esteeme, that my countrie may entertaine the best hope of me. You haue O Marcus Tullius, children, and neighbours beseeming you; and to you wor
                     •
                  hilie most deare. You must also in the Commonwealth, next af

                  o great a number, that I must be excluded; and that you haue no place left you, wherein you may embrace mee, and put mee vpon all things which concurre with your pleasure, and my desert. I haue peraduenture laide open my minde vnto you: but what my wit is, cannot through long seruitude, be perfectly apprehended. Wee haue, from the Maritime coast's of Asia, and the Islands, taken all the shipping we could. The presse of such as were to rowe, though with great opposition of the Citties, was not long in compassing. We followed the Armada of D

himselfe with vs; and oftentimes departing from vs; at length bare in with Corcyrus, and began to keepe himselfe within the port. Leauing it, wee went to Cyprus; because we thought it better to returne to the Campe, in that an other Naui

                   came after; which Tullius Cymber had the yeare before, gathered together in Bithynia, which was commanded by Turulius the Quaestor. And from thence; wee thought good with all speed, to giue you notice of what had happened. The Tarsenses most disloyall associats, and the Laodiceni farre more foolish, haue voluntarily call'd vnto them Dolobella. By the aide of which Citties

With better then an hundred great ships to embarque his armie. And that Dolobella had made these preparations, to the end, that if his hopes in Syria were frustrated, he might get aboord, and make for Italie; to ioyne with th'Antonij, and residue of Rebells.

I was so fearefull, that laying aside all other care, with a few small shipping I made towards him. And, if the Rhodi

And it is not onely profitable to our Common-wealth, but also necessarie, that such insolencie should bee chastised; which will grow greater, if by impunitie it be supported. As for our honor, I desire, you would haue a care thereof: and when you haue any occasion, either in the Senate, or in any other occurrent, vouchsafe to fauor me. Seeing Asia is deputed to the Consuls, and they permitted, that till they come themselues, they may place a Lieuetenant in the gouernment; entreat them, at my request rather to conferre this dignitie vpon my selfe then any other, and that they will constitute me Lieutenant, till either of them comes vnto their gouernment. For they haue no occasion to hasten their comming, or to send hither any Armie. For Dolobella is in Syria, and will, before these men come, be supprest by Cassius: as you diuinely foresaw, and did prognosticate. For Dolabella, being beaten from Antiochia; and in the assault he gaue, ill entreated; distrusting euerie other Citie, is retir'd to L

he will be rowsed, and hauing no place of refuge left him: nor being able to withstand so great an Armie, as that of Cassius; I make no doubt but that ere this time, he is defeated, and subdued. Whereupon I thinke Pansa, and Hirtius, need not hasten, in their Consulship to come vnto their Prouinces; but rather discharge their Consulship at Rome

For vnto me, it hath euer beene very troublesome, dangerous, and expensiue. But because I would not haue suffered in vaine, so many discommodities, and be vrged to depart from hence, before I reape the last fruites of my laborious industrie. For, if I could send home those somms which I had gathered; I would require a successor: but to get in that which I disboursed to Cassius; and that which we lost by the death of Trebonius; and by Dolabella's crueltie; or by their per

                   this Prouince, but as much as Cassius, and Brutus: not onely, in that I was an associate with them, in that same action, and daunger; but also because now, I am not wanting, in any valour, or industrie. For I was the first, that brake the lawes of Antonius; the first that drew Dolabella's Cauallerie, to take part with the Common-wealth; and that surrendred it to Cassius; the first to presse souldiers for generall safetie, against that most wicked conspiracie; and that onely vnited Syria, and the Armies that were there, with Cassius, and the Common-wealth. For, if I had not giuen so much treasure to Cassius; so many men; and with that expedition I did; he would neuer haue attempted to goe into Syria. Which if it had not beene, the Common-wealth should by this time haue had no lesse cause, to feare Dolabella, then Antonius. And all these things I did, notwithstanding, I was a familiar friend, and companion to Dolabella; and by neare affinitie

allied to the Antonij; and had also by their meanes, gotten my Prouince. But because I bare greater loue to my countrie, I was the first that rais'd war against mine owne familiars. And though I finde, that for these things, I haue not hitherto, had any great recompence: Yet am I not altogether out of hope: nor will I hold it troublesome resoluedly to perseuer in the desire of libertie only: but in labour also, and in dangers.

into a good way: neuerthelesse, I will not cease to encourage him therein, to the end, that day by day learning, and exercising himselfe, he may goe forward. At the date of these, I knew not what was done about the Common wealth I heard certaine rumors, the which God graunt, may be false; that once we may enioy a quiet libertie: which hitherto I neuer could. Notwithstanding, in my Nauigation, hauing found a little vacancy, I haue compounded a trifle, according to my manner, to present you with. And I haue collected together certaine sayings, deliuered by you, to my great honour, which I haue here vnder written. Wherein, if I seeme vnto you in some words a little too free; excuse me, in that he, against whom I speake, is such an one, as deserues worse, then I haue spoken. Let me request you also to pardon our choller, wc is but iust, against such men and Cittizens. And then, why should Lucilius rather be permitted to take vpon him this libertie, then my selfe?

But wise men, and of good disposition, hold the matter for truth, and allow thereof. What should I say more? There is great hope in him. 'Tis thought hee will enter into any enterprise, that may procure him praise and glory. But Antonius, our familiar friend, obserues himselfe to be so generally hated, as hauing

This is, as it were, a modell of the Common-wealth; if it be any Cōmonwealth at all, where all matters are carried by Armes, and Soldiers. And I am much vexed, to think, that you could not for yeeres, relish the

Common-wealth, in a time, when it was entire, and out of danger: and yet in former times, there was some hope: but now, euen hope it selfe is taken away. And what hope can there be? seeing Antonius durst tell the people, that Canutius sought to obtaine their fauor, who could not, with his safetie, be permitted to remaine within the Citie. For mine owne part, I patiently endure (thankes to Philosophie) these, and all things else, which are incident to man. For, she doth not onely free mee from griefe, but also armes me, against all the assaults of Fortune. And I aduise you to doe the like, and to make nothing in the number of euills, wherein your selfe haue had no hand. In which point I will no further extend my selfe, because I wil not speake of those things wc you know better then my selfe. Our Str

                   conceiues not, what familiaritie I retain with Lucius Lamia: For it was manifested to all Rome, at the same time, when by Aulus Gabinius the Consull he was confined, because valiantly, and freely he had defended my safetie; Neither did our loue grow onely from this; but from an affection which was great, and of long continuance. Whereupon hee refused not to vndergoe any daunger vpon mine occasion. To which offices, or rather deserts, so pleasing a cōuersation is to be added, that there is no man with whom I ought to be more delighted. Now the reason of so speciall loue being made manifest vnto you; I imagine you looke not with what words I recommend him. I would haue you know thus much onely, that if you defend Lamia's occasions, his agents, his Free-men, and his very slaues, wherein it shall bee requisite; it shall more satisfie me, then if you had vouchsafed me this courtesie, in defence of mine own proper substance, and interest's. And I m

of men is such, that for Lamia's owne sake, you will doe any thing very willingly. Although 'twas said, that you were perswaded, that he was present, at the recording of a decree of the Senate, made in preiudice of your honor: whereas he was neuer present at the passing of any decree, vnder those Consulls. And besides this, all the decrees that then came from the Senate were false. Except you also, bele

               DOe I then write to you for none, but such as are contentious? And though this be true, yet you cannot say, but I write often to you. For you haue

vs'd the matter so, that no man thinkes he can obtaine your fauour without my letters. But which of your men euer told me, that he came from thence as a messenger, by whom I haue not written backe againe? Or else, being denied to talke with you face to face, what greater recreation doe I finde, then either in writing to you, or reading your letters? I am rather greeu'd, that I am hindred by so many employments, that I haue no conueniencie to write vnto you, as often as I would. For then I would invite you not with Epistles, but with whole volumes: with which in all reason you s

If you haue no time to spare, be not so shamelesse, and troublesome in importuning me, to write often to you; considering that you write so seldome to me. For if heretofore I haue beene encumbred with many occupations, (for I was busied in defending the Common-wealth with all care;) much more am

labour to perswade your selfe, that I am not of so weake an affection, not to say inhumaine; as that I can be out-gone by you, either in loue, or courtesie. In truth I no wayes doubted of your loue; and yet C
                        •
                     erippus hath made it me much more manifest. Oh what a man is this! I alwayes tooke him to be fit for my conuersation; but now I apprehend him to be delightsome. As I liue, he hath not onely reuealed your mind vnto me, with your owne words, but with your gesture also. So as, doe not feare, that I am offended with you, because you wrote vnto me in the selfe same forme, as you wrote vnto others. True it is, I was desirous you should write vnto me in another fashion then you wrote to others: but this I did, rather excited by loue, then choller. Touching the charge, you say you are, and haue bin at, in respect of the warre; verily, I cannot ease you. For besides that the Senate by the death of the Consulls, remaines, as it were, without a guide; and there is no way to raise any prou

For your Legates, being men that deserue honour: you should not value them with base fellowes. And I am of opinion, that not by any authoritie of the Senates decree, but by maine violence, you haue enforced

their departure. This in briefe, is an answere, to the two letters I receiued from you, of one tenour. I haue nothing else to deliuer vnto you, but that your honour shall be as deare vnto me, as mine owne. Farewell.

                  he behalfe of my dignitie, against your owne liking. But, if you thinke you shall doe it willingly; then let me requ
                     •
                  st you to doe that, which I am to require of you; especially being such, as highly concernes me, and is to you, no way preiudiciall. Patro Epicureus, is wholly mine, and I his: saving that in Philosophie I greatlie differ from him. But both in the beginning, when at Rome he obserued you, and yours, he honoured me aboue all others: and lastly, when about his benefits and rewardes, he obtain'd those things which he desired, he preuail'd more by my meanes, then by any other defender, or friend he had: and besides this, he was commended vnto me by Phaedrus: who, when I was a child, before I knew Philo, I much esteemed as a Philosopher, and afterwards, notwithstanding

[our difference of opinions] as an honest man, verie facete, and officious. Now, this Patro hauing written to me at Rome, that I would procure him your fauour: and request you to graunt him certaine ruines of the house that belong'd to Epicurus: I wrote nothing to you thereof; because I was not willing, that your d
                     •
                  signe of building, should be hindred, by my recōmendation. The same partie, when I came to Athens, entreating me once more to write vnto you, about the same matter; obtain'd his request

                  pon this occasion; in that amongst your friends, it was verily thought; that you had giuen ouer that determination of building. And if it be so: and that now you make no reckoning of it: my desire is, that, if you by other mens peruersitie haue beene a
                     •
                  y wayes prouoked (for I know the condition of that people) you would pacifie your minde, by doing something which may be either answerable to your courteous disposition, or 
                     •
                  ending vnto my grace, and honour. I for mine owne part (if you will haue me tell you my opinion) doe not perceiue, why either he should bee so impo

                  tunate; or you so vnwilling to graunt it: except it may be farre lesse allowed in you, 
                     •
                  o regard so cōtemptible a matter, then in him to craue it. Although I am sure you vnderstand, both with what

words Patro excuseth himselfe, and vpon what he groundes. He sayes, hee cannot herein neglect his reputation; the Testament, and authoritie of Epicurus; the 
                     •
                  arnest entreaties of Phaedrus: and that he is engaged, to maintaine that place, where famous men frequented, inhabited, and conuersed. If wee should reiect this his instant importunitie, we must needs deride his whole course of life, and the profession he maketh of Philosophie. But because we are neither enemies to him, nor to others of that Sect; I am of opinion, that he is excusable, though he be herein so deeply touched. Wherein, if he offend 'tis rather out of follie, then malice. But not to be ouer-long, (for I must at length vtter it,) I loue Pomponius Atticus as a brother. I haue not a dearer, nor more acceptabl
                     •

                     •
                  heth well to Patro, and loues Phaedrus exceedingly: hath beene so wondrous earnest with me herein. And, though he be a man, that is not mou'd to doe these offices, out of ambition; neither vseth to be ouer-burdensome in his requests, yet he neuer required any thing of me more eff
                     •
                  ctuallie. And he assures himselfe, that I may obtaine this

fauour from you, with a becke onelie; yea, though you had a mind to build there. But when he shall vnderstand, that you haue giuen ouer your intention of building; and (yet for all this,) that I was not by you herein satisfied; he will not suppose, that you were to me discourteous; but that I in his occasions haue bin carelesse. And therfore I entreat you to write to your friends, that you are content, that the same decree of the Senate about the Areopagitae, which they call a certaine monument, should be disanulled. But to returne to our beginning: before you doe this, I would haue you resolue in mind to doe it willingly. Conceiue therfore, that in shewing me this fauour, you shall doe me a verie acceptable pleasure. Farewell.

him with a place of residence. Because, for the multitude of businesse, which he hath for many vndertaken, hee will be much hindered by his sodaine remoue vpon the calends of Iulie. I am ashamed to vse much entreatie: but, I make no doubt, being little or nothing at all preiudiciall to you, you will deale with me, as I should doe with you, if you demanded at my hands any courtesie. I assure you, it will giue me very singular contentment, Farewell.

So as, I may be secure, that he, who was pleas'd to purchase new friends, would continue his old benefits.

And, I am wont to assist, as much as my power, and fauour will permit me, his courtesie towards them. Wherefore I haue thought good, to manifest vnto you in this Epistle, the cause, why I recommend vnto you, all the Cuspians. In other letters, I will onely put that marke, or token, that wee haue agree'd vpon; and withall, I will signifie vnto you, that hee is one of the friends of Cuspius.

In a word I shall be enform'd of what force these letters were with you; and as I hope, I shall haue occasion to thanke you. And in the meane while, in any thing wherein I thinke you would be glad that I should vse mine endeuour, I will not faile withall effectuall diligence, to employ it. Respect your health.

               WHen, vpon your departure for Gallia, moued by our interchanged affection, and the great respect you beare me; you came home to visit me. I spake with you about the A

                     ellani, who pay tribute for that part of their Countie which lies in Gallia; intimating vnto you, how neerely I was touched with their interest's. And after your departure, the matter being such, as it mainly imported a towne of that worth, and which I so much esteemed; being confident in your good inclination towards me, I thought my selfe obliged, to write vnto you thero

                   with all possible diligence. Though I am not ignorant, either of the condition of the times, or of your power.

And I vnderstand but too well, that the charge y• was giuen you by Caius Caesar was not to iudge, but to execute. Wherfore I request you, to do only so much, as I thinke you can, and will for my cause willingly. And, first I would haue you to conceiue it to be true: that all the busines of this towne or Incorporation is, that there maine interest lies in this County which paies tribute: and now, through the burdensome impositions it hath endur'd, it is 
                     •
                  alne into extreame pouertie. Which inconuenience, though it appeareth that many other haue equally suffered: neuerthelesse I assure you, that this towne in particular, hath suffered mo

                   then other. Which I forbeare to re

                  e vnto you, least in complaining of my friends miseries, I may seeme to distaste those persons, whom vnwillingly I would. Wherefore, were I not confident in my hopes, that I can manifest vnto Caesar, how that towne vndeseruedly, was ouercharg'd with such a burden: I would neuer haue sollicited you, vpon this occasion. But because I am assur

                  d, and perswaded, that he will haue respect vnto the worth of the Towne; to the equi

                  ie; and also to the good affection, the inhabitants thereof beare towards him: I thought good, to request and entreat you, that you will reserue this cause to him to bee dispatched.

Which though I would not forbeare to entreat of you, though I had not heard that you euer granted so much before: yet I entertaine more liuely hopes of obtaining it, seeing 'twas told me, how the Rhegienses had obtained from you the selfsame fauour. Who, though they be linked in friendship with you, yet your loue towards me, bids me hope, that what courtesies you haue done for your owne, you will also performe for mine acquaintance. Especially considering, that, hauing many friends, which would sue for the like at your hands by my meanes; I request this kindenes only, for these men. And though I assure my selfe, you vnderstand, that I discharge not this office, without cause; and that no vaine ambition hath tickled me on with so great instance, to sollicite you; yet would I haue you giue credit to my sincere speeches, that I am to this towne much obliged: it hauing euer; aswell in time of my prosperities, as disasters, made knowne their singular affection to me. Wherefore, in respect of the viscerall amitie we hold together, and for that great loues sake which you haue euer borne me, I do in the greatest earnest I am able entreate you, that you, considering, that the estate of

And wee shall so value your fauour, if wee obtaine from Caesar, as, our expected grace, wee shall repute it granted, by your benefit: if otherwise; wee shall notwithstanding remaine in the same obligation; in that you labour'd to procure it vs. And besides the singular pleasure, you shall doe me thereby: you shall by meanes of such an important fauour, further oblige vnto yours

But it being Caesars pleasure, that the sales, and assignements made by Sylla should stand good: to the end that his, might be thought more durable: if the same Farmes be diuyded, which Caesar himselfe hath sold, what securitie can there bee in his sales? But how much this point imports, let your wisedome consider. I request you, and request you after such a manner, that with greater affection, iuster cause, and hartier desire I cannot request you; that

you would haue respect vnto Albinus, and not meddle with those Farmes, once in possession of Laberius. For it will not bee onely a ioy vnto mee, but after a sort a glorie also; if Publius Sextius, to whom I am so deepely engaged, can by my meanes giue to so neere a

                     rentius Varro, when hee first began to plead, entred into friendshippe with mee; afterwards when hee grew to riper yeares, two respects occurred, of encreasing my loue towards him: one was,

because he followed those studies, wherewith we are at this day much delighted; & he followed it, as you know with vnderstanding and diligence. And withall, because he entred betimes into the societie of the Tole-masters; which notwithstanding I liked not: in that he suffered great losses. Neuerthelesse, he being one of that order, whom I euer receiued to speciall protection, our amity grew more cōfirmed. Besides this, he hauing beene an aduocate, and Iudge, with apparant fidelitie, and good esteeme, before this mutation of the Commonwealth, hee applied himselfe to demand a Quaestorship, supposing that this honorable degree, would be a recompence of his trauailes. And not long since, I sent him from Brundusium to Caesar, with letters of tru

                  t: wherein I euidently perceiued, how much he loued me, in taking willingly this charge vpon him, and how faithfull a friend hee was, in bringing the matter to effect. I was determined, hauing layd open the occasion of my loue towards him, to informe you particularly, of his honestie, & good conditions: but hauing declar'd the reason thereof, I thinke I haue sufficiently intima

which will accrew vnto you therby. For you shall discerne him to be a man, both prudent, and farre from all auarice, or ambition: and besides, of singular endeuour, and industrie. Neither should I intimate vnto you these thinges, which you will obserue, when you haue

                     •
                   being a sufficient induction; the which neuerthelesse, may the more moue you, annexing thereunto my letters. Wherefore if you make that esteeme of mee, which Varro beleeue

               AMongst all the mobilitie, I lou'd no young man so well as Publius Crassus; and hauing conceiu'd great hope of him in his tender yeares, I began to hope better, seeing my iudgement of him, to be verified. Now, you shall vnderstand, that euen when he liued I much esteem'd, and made great accompt of Apollonius his Free-man: because he was affected to Crassus; and Crassus in his vertuous studies made so good vse of him, that he lou'd him dearely. Then after the death of Crassus, I thought him also for this cause more worthie of my loue, and to be receiued into my protection; in that he held himselfe bound, to obserue, and honour those, that Crassus lou'd, and loued Crassus. Whereupon he came to me in C
                        •
                     licia, and seru'd me in manie occurrents, both faithfully, and prudently. And as I thinke, in the warre of Alexandria, hee neuer fail'd you, in whatsoeuer he was able to compasse, either by his fidelitie, or industrie. And hoping that you also had the same opinion of him, he came into Spaine; first questionlesse, vpon his owne deliberation, but next for your assistance. Neither

did I otherwise promise to recommend him vnto you: not but that I suppos'd my commendation would be of some effect with you; but in that I thought he needed not be to you commended, hauing beene with you in the warre; and you for the memoriall of Crassus, reputing him in the number of your owne. And, if he would haue sought recommendation, he saw that other men also, would haue done him this pleasure. For the iudgement I made of him, I haue willingly passed my word; both because he esteem'd much thereof, and in that I knew my testimonie would be of some credit with you. I say therefore, that I haue found him a learned man; and studious of all 
                     •
                  xcellent sciences; and that euen from his tender yeares. For, when he was but a childe, he remain'd a good while in my house, with Diodo

                     s, the Stoick, a person in my iudgement very learned. Now, set on fire, with the affection which he beares to your worthie acts, he desires to write them in Greeke, and I think he can performe it. He hath wit, and experience in humain
                     •
                   actions, hee hath beene long time exercis'd in these manner of studies, and learning: and he desires to giue life, and perpetuitie to your prayses. This is the testi

                  onie of my opinion. But you that are most wise, may giue a sounder iudgement

hereof. And, though I said, I would not, yet I recommend him: and whatsoeuer fauour you shew him, it shall vnto my selfe be aboue measure acceptable. Farewell.

And being so, it cannot but bee

acceptable of necessitie. But for all this; seeing by our domesticall amitie it is permitted me, that I may also commit a sinne in writing; both those offices, which I haue hitherto denyed, shall bee now performed. I desire therefore, that to the s

                  ull of courtesie, and bountie, and readie to honour any man: he is also studious in that learning with which being hertofore delighted, our life also is now nourished. In a word, I would haue you augment your benefits, in all his occurrents, when you may performe it with your honor: but in two things I namely entreate you. First, if in making an acquittance to the partie, any securitie be required, that you will vse the meanes, securitie may be giuen him in my name. Then, considering the whole enheritance in a manner consists in those goods, which Oppia, sometimes Mindius wife hath purloyned; that you procure and find a meane, that this woman may bee brought to Rome. Which when shee perceiues shall come to passe, I am of opinion we shall end the businesse: let me therefore r
                     •
                  quest you to giue vs this contentment. What I haue heretofore written I confirme vnto you, and vpon my credi
                     •
                   assure you, that the pleasures which

                     ssinius, shall be so well bestowed, that yourselfe will iudge, that you haue shewed fauour, to a very gratefull person, and ingenuous. For to that which you haue perform'd for my sake, I would also haue this addition. Againe,

I doe not thinke that the Lacedaemonij any waies doubt, but that you wil so receiue them vnder your protection, as befitteth your faith, and equitie; and as their predecessors dignitie deserueth. And I, as he that knowes you well, neuer doubted, but that you are fully enformed of the rights, & deserts of each people. Whereupon when Philippus, the Lacedaemonian requested me, that I would recommend vnto you the cittie: though I call'd to minde, that I was bound vnto that Cittie; yet I answered him, that the Lacedaemonij, with you, needed no recommendation. So that I would haue you build vpon this; that I, considering the present troubles, repute all the Citties of Achaia happie, that you gouerne them. And likewise I suppose, that you hauing not onely read ouer our Records, but those also of the Graecians, out of your voluntary accord, you neither can, nor will be other then a friend to the Lacedaemonians. Wherefore I onely request you, that when you shew the Lacedaemonians those fauours, which stand with your credit, dignitie, and equitie; if you thinke good, cause them to vnderstand, that you are desirous to heare, that the pleasures which you doe them, may by me also be approued. For it concernes me, that they should beleeue, that I haue a care of their Interests. This, I request you, with

the greatest zeale that I am able. Farewell.

               I Make no question but you conceiue, how, amongst all those friends your Father left you, I am nearest vnto you; not onely for those reasons, which carrie a great apparence of alliance; but also for those, that consist in familiaritie, and conuersation. The which you know, betweene your father and mee were the greatest, and most delightsome in the world. From these beginnings spring the loue which I beare you. Which loue made our amitie greater, then that wee held with your Father. And so much the more, because I perceiued, that so soone as you attain'd to the yeares, to be able to iudge, in what proportion euery one deseru'd to be esteemed of you; that you began to honor, obserue, and loue me aboue all others. Besides all this, we were knit together with a farre firmer knot; as by the knot of studies: which of it selfe greatly imports; especially being of those studies, and those vertues, which of themselues procure, that the parties

which are of one minde, are also conioyn'd in familiaritie. I suppose you expect, what this far-fetcht discourse will tend vnto. First therefore, you shall vnderstand, that I haue not ript vp this commemoration, without great and worthie respects. I frequent most familiarly with Ca

All the fauours, which in this high renowne, and esteeme you are in with Caesar, I could haue had graunted from you vpon request: I will thinke conferred vpon me, out of your owne voluntarie free will, if you doe but graunt me this petition. And because you may the more readily encline, to comfort him herein, behold one reason well knowne to Caesar himselfe; that Capito euer bare wonderfull loue, and great respect to Caesar. But Caesar himselfe can testifie thus much. I know he hath a verie good memorie, and therefore I'le mention it no further. I require nothing else, but that you will moue Caesar in the cause of Capito, with equall zeale, to the memoriall you shall perceiue, that he retaineth of Capito. I'le deliuer vnto you, what experience I haue made of him: of what validitie it is, your selfe shall iudge. You vnderstand what part I tooke, & what cause was by me defended. You are priuie, what men, and what societie of men I followed. Of thus much be assured: that if in this warre, I perform'd any thing against Caesars mind, I was aduis'd,

And besides, that he was the man, who gaue mee entertainment in the same Citie; his customes also were very conformable to my condition: and he gaue mee much satisfaction, both in his life and conuersation. And, as I lou'd him heretofore: so now, since I departed from mine office, my loue's redoubled: because I had found him, in manie occasions, thankefull and mindefull of mee. Insomuch, that I cheerfully entertain'd and respected him here in Rome, in acknowledgement of the honour, which I receiued from him in Laodicea. This I I haue written vnto you, both to intimate, that I recommend him not without a cause; and, that you may thinke him worthie of your hospitalitie. You shall therefore doe mee a singular pleasure, if you make him conceiue, how much you loue mee; that is, if you receiue him to your protection; and, assist him, wherein soeuer honestly you may,

And yet mee thinkes, I conceiue some hope, that Caesar, our Colleague, would, and now intends, we should haue some forme of a Common-wealth. At whose counsels, it much imports, that you were present: but, if it turne to your greater benefit, that is to your greater glorie, to gouerne Asia, and to cure that weake and ill-conditioned part of the Common-wealth; there's no reason, but I should abate my desire, vpon the hope of your benefit.

               BEfore you departed from Rome, I recommended vnto you in your garden, as effectuallie, as I could, the goods, moueables, reckonings, and possessions that my necessarie friend Caerellia hath in Asia; and you, according to your custome, and continuall waightie courtesies, freely tooke vpon you to doe any thing. Now, I hope, you are as mindfull of the said businesse, as you were wont to be of other matters. Notwithstanding, Caerellia's Solicitors, haue written to me, that it were good to giue you often, remembrance thereof, being for the greatnesse of your Prouince, and the multitude of affaires much employed. I desire therefore that you would be mindfull, how freely you promised me all those fauours, which your dignitie might affoord. I am fully of opinion, that you haue ample authoritie of satisfying Caerellia, out of that decre of the Senate, which was enacted in that cause of the heires to Caius Vennonius. Wherein notwithstanding, I referre my selfe to your councell, and iudgement, as being to e

that you haue euer highly esteem'd the authoritie of that order. It onelie remaines, for me to tell you, that wherein so euer you fauour Caerellia, you shall doe me a singular pleasure. Farewell.

who are vnder your power, especially, at my intercession. If you thinke it not preiudiciall to your owne reputation; I

But I verily beleeue, (yet I may be deceiu'd) that by such an act you shall rather get prayse, then infamie. About this matter, what may be done, and what you may doe for my sake, (for I make no doubt of what you would doe) I desire, (so it be not troublesome vnto you,) to be further certified.

If thou hast any care of our miserable fortunes, looke that woes do not vtterly cast away our wretched son. Let him not want while there is any thing left: hee needes but some good qualitie, and a moderate estate to raise himselfe to the rest of his fortunes. Looke to your health, and let me heare from you, that I may know wh

               I Am come to Dyrrhachium, because it is a free Cittie, and kinde to me, and not farre from Italie. But if the great concourse of people there, shall dislike me, I will repaire, to some other place, and giue you notice.

               DOe not suppose that I vse to write very long Epistles to any man: except he write at large to me. And I thereupon iudge it reasonable, to make him alike answer. For first, I know not what to write; and then, at this time, there's nothing that I vndergoe more vnwillingly. And if this happen to me when I write to others, what may it doe now thinke you, when I write to your selues: to whom I cannot endite a letter, which is not accompanied with many teares: knowing you to be fallen into extreame miserie, whom I was euer desirous to behold in great felicitie; which I was bound to endeuour; and had I not beene so tymerous had effected.

                  fered. Although in this respect I am more miserable then thou, who art most miserable. For the bitternes of this fortune is equall to vs both, but the blame is only mine. I should either haue accepted of the embassies, by meanes whereof I might haue shunned the danger; or by my friends endeauours haue constantly resisted the iniuries of mine enemies; or else haue dyed with resolution. To a worser state, then that wherein I now stand, I could neuer haue been reduced. Which is the cause, that I greeue not more for the euill, then for the repro

how weake you are of sexe: the more am I sorrowfull, considering that you cannot vndergoe so many troubles without great danger. And besides, I perceiue no hope of my safetie. There are two things, which oppose our desires: the hatred of many; and the enuie almost of all men. And as to preserue our former state, little was requisi

Neuerthelesse, while you are hopefull; I will also support, this my wearie, and languishing body with some hopefulnesse: that in being wanting both to you, and to my selfe, as I haue beene hitherto, despaire may not augment our euills. As for that point, where you write, that I should be wary to remaine in a place of s

I haue thanked my friends, as you enioyn'd me in your letters, and touching their friendly procurements about my safetie, I haue written, I was therof by you aduertised. The conueyer of these letters was Dexippus. For our Piso, I haue heard by all men; and I plainely my selfe perceiue it; that he beares vs wond

hauing had a very daungerous Nauigation, and very slow, through contrarietie of Winds. At my landing, Acastus came vnto me with letters, one and twentie dayes after their date. Questionlesse he came verie speedily. I receiued yours; And I answere, that whereas you doubted, that those you 
                     •
                  ormerly wrote, had neuer beene deliuer'd me, you shall vnderstand, I haue receiued them all: and I take great contentment, that you haue so diligently aduertis'd me of euery thing. The last, which Acastus brought, are briefe: neither doe I wonder at it: for, it may bee you daily expect my comming; or to say better, that we shall come together. And questionlesse, we are also very desirous, to see you with the first opportunitie. Although, hearing in what state the Common-wealth now stands, I see too euidently, that we shall come in the midst of great troubles: and by the letters of sundrie friends, sent vnto me by Acastus, me thinkes, I perceiue, that this ciuill controuersie must be ended with Armes. So that as soone as euer I come, I shall be enforced to discouer my affection. But, seeing we are to come, we will vse all diligence to come most speedily, to the end we may haue more time, to deliberate about this matter; and consequently to resolue with greater wisdome. I desire,

that you would come as farre hitherward as you can, to meete me; so you may doe it, without your inconuenience. Touching the Praetian inheritance, (which doubtlesse, is an occasion to me of great griefe, considering this benefit accrews vnto mee by the death, of a man whom I heartily loued) Take order, in case the outcrie be made before my arriuall, that Pomponius may take into his hands the portion that belongs to vs: and if Pomponius cannot attend it, procure Camillus to take vpon him the charge thereof. What remaines further to be done, we will performe at our comming. And though peraduenture at the receipt of these, you are vpon the waie to meete vs; yet forbeare not to procure the performance of what I haue written. We by gods helpe hope to be in Italie about the midst of Nouember. You, my sweetest and most desired Terentia, and you Tulliola; if you loue vs, endeuour to preserue your selues. From Athens, the xviij. of October. Farewell.

the Senate, of the euents of Syria. And because I see all other meanes excluded, of defending these Countries; I labor to purchase the loue, & good will of the people, and to keepe our Colleaga

And I oppugn'd it with Countermures, shelters, and tourrets. And so, battering it with diuers engins, and assailing it with Crosse-bow shot, with great labour, and without any disturbance, or charge to our Associates, I tooke it, within the space of lesse then two moneths. For they within, perceiuing the Cittie burnt, and ruined on euery side, out of necessitie yeelded themselues. A little beyond, are the Tibarani, as wicked and audacious as the former. Who hearing of the taking in of Pindenissus, sent me hostages. And then I dismissed the Armie, (winter being now come on,) to their seuerall quarters.

But because in all ages, there was a lesser number of those that could subdue their owne appetites, then of those, that knew how to vanquish an enemie; certainely, you ought to repute my operations the greater, and more iust, comparing with the excellencie of armes, these parts which are more rare, and found with greater difficultie.

               HAuing vnderstood of the vigilant care you haue taken of the people committed to your charge, and the Iustice you haue executed in your gouernment: & your zeale, in procuring their happines. I haue found such contentment therein, as our friendship, and the loue I beare vnto my Countrey, requireth.

Which, notwithstanding, to me is no new thing, nor to anie that haue knowne the diuine forme by you obserued, in the Regiments of Rome. wherefore, not thinking it fit, that your praises should bee concealed, hauing with innocencie, and good counsels, defended the Prouince, preseru'd the Kingdome of Ariobarzanes, with the King himselfe; & recalled to the obedience of our Empire the Confederates; I spake openly in the Senate, in testimonie of your vertues, which had produced so happie effects. The Senate vnd

                  berate, that all the Temples of the Citie should bee visited. And, if, for that which you haue effected, not by anie fauour of prosperous Fortune, but by meanes of your owne moderation and prudence, you had rather, the people of Rome should giue thankes to the immortall Gods, then acknowledge it from your selfe: I in like manner reioyce thereat. But if you affect this honour, esteeming it an earnest of your Triumph; And would for this, haue vs more bouud to Fortune, then to your selfe; Know, that Triumph doth not alwaies second such honor. In my opinion, 'tis farre greater glorie, when the Senate iudges, that the Prouince was maintain'd and preseru'd rather

by the clemencie and sinceritie of the Captaine, then either by the force of Souldiers, or the Gods benignitie. And about this point, I haue been longer then vsuall, to make you conceiue the great desire I haue, to settle you in this opinion; that I haue both procur'd that for you, which in my iudgement did accrue most vnto your greatnesse: and that I reioyce, that you haue obtained, what you most desired. Farewell. Loue vs, and as you haue begun, prosecute the affaires of the Common-wealth, and our Associates, with diligence, and seueritie.

               Cicero Imperator, to Lucius Paulus Consull. Epist. 13.
               
               FOR diuers respects I could haue wished, I had beene in Rome with you; but principally, that both in demanding and managing your Consulship, you might haue discern'd the good affection, that deseruedly I beare vnto you. True it is, that I was euer certaine, that in your petition you would finde no obstacle at all: but yet I would haue beene glad vpon such an occasion, to haue manifested some louing demonstration. And in your consulshippe, though it be my desire, that you should not incounter with many troubles: yet doe I much distaste, that in exchange of so many fauours, which being a young man I haue receiued from you, I at these yeares should not haue the power, to returne you some such gratitude, as is befitting. But I thinke it was a certaine influence of the heauens which alwaies opened the way to you,

in oblieging me; and clos'd it vp when I should shew my gratitude vnto you, in that I euer had aprompt and readie will thereto; but meanes that were slow, and vnable to accomplish. You assisted me to attaine to the Consulship; and to returne into my countrie, from which I was vniustly banished. And now the happie times permits, that vnder your consulship, it hath be
                     •
                  ne my fortune, to compasse some laudable effects. Wherefore seeing you are placed in so high, and honorable a dignitie, and occasions are presented vnto me, of being honoured: on the one side I am instigated humblie to intreat, and vrge you to endeauour so, that the Senate may establish a decree vpon my Fortunate successes, with all the fauour & regard yt can be imagined: on the other; I dare not with you vse ceremonies, least I should make you conceiue, that either I haue forgotten the forme which you haue heeretofore vsed in doing me courtesie; or, that I might imagine you are forgetfull. Wherfore, laying aside (as I thinke you desire) all circumstances of faire words, I will breefely demand a fauour of him, whose deserts towards me are knowne to all nations. If your selfe were not Consull (O Paullus) I would vse your meanes, that you might procure mee their affection, who had that dignitie:

but because this great honor and authoritie placed in your selfe, and our intrinsicall amitie, is hid from no man, I entreate you in the best manner I am able, to procure, that with all fauourable interpretation, and possible expedition, my actions may be scanned and gratified. Wherof I write to you that are Consulls, and to the Senate. You shall vnderstand, that they are worthy to bee accounted of, and such, for which thankes are deseruedly to bee rendred vnto the gods. And not only in this, but in any other occasion, wherin the interest of my honor represents it selfe, I request you to vouchsafe your vndertaking the defence thereof. And aboue all bee carefull to cut off euery designe, which is intended for the prolongation of my gouernment. I desire to see you Consul, and to obtaine from you being Consull, both absent & present, the end of mine intentiōs. Farwel.

                  s you, hath so much the rather recommended him. In conclusion, I will labour hard for the dignitie of Fabius, as you entreat me. For diuers reasons, I would we could meete together: first, to satisfie the longing I haue had to see you, to whom these many yeares, I haue beene well affected; and that in presence, I may reioyce with you, as I haue done in letters. Withall, that we communicate betweene our selues, you, yours, I, mine occurrents: and finally, to weaue the web of our friendship, which wee haue framed with sundrie obligations: but, through instabilitie of the times, could neuer arriue to it full perfection.

You in your tender years affectionately sought my amitie: and I was euer of beleefe, that your conuersation, was an ornament vnto me. Afterwardes you were the secure Port, in my terrible stormes, and safe shield, against the trecherie of mine enemies. And after your departure, I contracted friendship with Brutus your kinsman: so as I perswade my selfe, that from so noble a wit, and absolute learning as yours is, in all times, great honour and contentment will accrew vnto me. And I request you as earnestly as I may, to worke so, that you confirme me in this beleefe, and aduer

                  . Epist. 15.
               
               THough each of vs departed from the warre vpon like deliberations, with hope of peace, and hatred of ciuill bloudshed. Yet, being the first, who retired, I am peraduenture the more bound to defend the course that wee had taken: though many times I call to minde, how being together, and consulting of sundrie, and great matters betweene our selues, to prouide for our safeties, we held one opinion, and made one conclusion. Which was; to attend what successe the first battaile would haue; after which, of necessitie it was expedient, that either the whole cause should be determined, or at least our iudgem
                     •
                  nt resolued. Which resolution was neuer reprehended, but by those, who maintained, that it was better for the Common-wealth to be absolutely dissolued
                     •
                   then to remaine weakned, and dismembered. And I saw, that if she once perished, al hope of reducing her to her due state, went with her. But if shee were but languishing, there would be yet some comfort. But things haue happened, so farre beyond all mens opinion, as it is a greater miracle, that 
                     •
                  uer they could fall out, then

that we were not able to foresee, or being men to presage them. Questionlesse, I confesse, that I supposed, that after the fatall battaile fought, the victorious would prouide for common safetie, and the vanquished for themselues. But I likewise iudged, that these effects could not grow from any other root, then from suddaine victorie, and humilitie of the vanquished: and had this humilitie beene; they who were in Africa, had found in him the same clemencie, which they that went into Asia, and Achaia had experienced. And that without any other mediation, but his owne. But the euill proceeded from this, that times were carelesly let run on; which greatly imparts in ciuill warres. For a yeare and an halfe running on in this manner, some conceiu'd hope to ouercome, others without hope of victorie, choose rather to die fighting; then to liue, by comming to their enemies for mercie. And of all these disasters, Fortune beares the blame. For who would euer haue thought, that the Alexandrian warre, would euer haue drawne to such a length, the warre ciuill? And that one Pharnaces, could haue strokē such a terror into all Asia? We concurred all in one election, though with a diuersitie of Fortune; you went into a part, where you might consult, and dis

But I could not doe as I would, because he pursued his enemie, and went farre from these parts. Now, in what state I liue, coniecture you. I heare on euery side, of the deepe woes, and direfull lamentations of miserable Italie, and our distressed Cittie. Whereunto both you, and I, and euery man, according to his Forces, might peraduenture haue found some remedie, if the chiefe Commander had arriued. Wherefore I request you by all the loue that you haue euer borne me, to write vnto me what successe things haue, what foundations you lay, what may be hoped for, and how we should carrie our selues. I will performe whatsoeuer your letters enioyne me. And I would to God I had followed the councell which you gaue me in your first vnfortunate letters, which you sent me from Luceria: for then; I had without any mol

But I write not these to vrge you to so small a matter, for I expect, nay, I challenge longer discourses from you. If I had opportunitie, I would send you euery houre three letters.

should haue this priuiledge, that as soone as I thinke of you, your Spectrum should present it selfe vnto my minde? And not onely of yours, who are seated, in the most secret cell of my memorie; but if a conceipt should rise in my imagination, in what forme the Island of Britannia lyeth, should I beleeue that the Idoll of it, would be presented vnto me?

thereinto. But what new conceit leads thee, O Cicero? Why I'le tell you the truth: It neither being secure, nor I being willing, to write what I thinke, about the Common-wealth, I entred into these phantasies, thinking it better to write of them then nothing. Farewell.

               I Protest, I haue no greater comfort in this my absence, then to write vnto you. For me thinkes I talke, and toy with you, as if we were together. And yet this proceeds not through the Spectra of Catius; in whose fauour I will by my next, produce you so manie rusticall

                  Stoicks, that I will driue you to affirme, that Catius was borne in Athens. I am much contented, that our Pansa, with the wonderfull satisfaction of all men, hath obtain'd so honourable a charge. And I vow to God, I doe not reioyce for him alone, but for all of vs. Hoping that it will be discerned, how much euery man naturally shuns, and abhorres tyrannie

                  ull; and that those honors which wicked men, labor and desire to obtaine, are distributed to honest and good men. It's a great matter, that it should be so difficult to perswade men, that vertue of her selfe is amiable, and an excellent rewarder of her followers: being truer, then truth it selfe, that vertue, iustice, and honestie, are those seedes which produce the true repose and peace of minde: as Epicurus himselfe (from whom all the Catij, and Amasinij his erronious interpreters are derived:) beareth wi

               Cicero to Caius Trebonius. Epist. 20.
               
               I Haue commended my Orator, (for so I stile him) to your Sabinus: whom I should euery way thinke well of, for his nations sake; had he not also vsurped their libertie, which hunt after honors, and therby assum'd that surname vpon himselfe, out of his owne braine: but yet his modest countenance, and solide discourse, shew him to retaine some thing, of those ancient customes. Thus much of him. Now that which toucheth me more neerely. My Trebonius, if God prosper you, to your hearts desire, seeing after your departure with new courte
                     •
                  ies, you haue a little kindled the flame of my loue; to the end wee may endure the thirst of your absence, with lesser difficultie, afford vs by your dailie letters some refreshing. But not vnlesse we truly and vnfeynedly do the like, Though you should do it oftner then our selues for two reasons. First, because they which remained in

                  Rome were wont, to write vnto their friends, that were in the gouernment of Prouinces, the accidents of the Commonwealth; now 'tis requisite you should write them vnto vs, the Commonwealth being there: and then, because wee may pleasure you by other offices; in that for any thing I perceiue, you can stand vs in no other sted, then to send vs letters. First, therfore I would vnderstand, what iourney you haue had: where you saw our Brutus, and how long you were togeather. If you haue proceeded further, I would haue you aduertise vs, how the warre is managed, and vpon what tearmes matters stand: to the end we may apprehend, in what state we are. So much as your letters informe me of, so much I shall hold myselfe to bee certaine of. Be carefull of your health; and loue me with your accustomed sincere affection.

                   of me. I am readily perswaded, that the affection you beare vnto mee is no lesse, then that which is borne by euery man to his owne person. To which affection, would I had no lesse abilitie in deeds, then I haue in loue to be answerable. Wherein notwithstanding I hope you shall remaine well satisfied. Now to your letter: Which pleas'd me exceedingly: for besides that, it was ingenuou
                     •
                  , and copious: it was also in euery part full of affection. I answer thereof, first, I wrot that Epistle to Caluus, thinking it should no more haue come to light, then this which you now read: For a thing mnst

be otherwise written, which wee determine should be onely read of those, to whom 'twas sent; then that which is to passe through the hands of many. Then, where as you meruaile that I exalted his wit with such great commendation, you supposing that they exceeded the bounds of veritie: I answer, that I thought fitting so to doe. Hee shewes great promptitude in writing; hee prosecutes a certaine method of his owne, conducted by a kinde of error in iudgement; wherein notwithstanding he doth very well; he is full of learning, but does not liuelie expresse his conceipt: therefore I exhorted him thereunto. For if you would put spirit into any man, or sharpen his vnderstanding, there is no better way in the world, then to commend him. This is my iudgement, and counsell about Caluus: Counsell; in that I prais'd him, to exhort him: Iudgement; in that I h

                  ld him to haue a wit worthie to bee esteemed. It remaines that I pray, that your iourney may proue happie; that I expect your returne with hope, that I visite you oftner in my thoughts, and betweene writing to you, and reading your letters that I mittigate the insatiable desire I haue to see you. My desire is, that you should often call to memorie, your owne officious endeauours for mee. Of which if it bee lawfull

to be mindefull; 'twere base in me to be forgetfull. For I would not onely haue you to esteeme me for an honest man, but one, of whom your selfe may haue opinion, you are much beloued. Farewell.

                  eof. I should bee glad, if you finde your selfe any thing better,

that you would remoue to Leucas; that there you might whollie be recouered. Take counsell of Curio; and Lyso, and the Phisition. I thought to send Mario backe vnto you. Whom you might haue returned when you had found you
                     •
                   better cheared. But I be thought me, that Mario could bring me but one letter: and I expected many. You may therefore procure (and will doe it you, if you loue me,) that Acastus may be euery day abou

Therefore expect all courtesie from him: and bee not yo

                   too hastie to follow me; for I had much rather see you come late cured, then presently infirmed. Labour therefore onely to recouer, and leaue the rest, to my prouidence.

Wee were maruellous carefull about your health, neither doe I wonder, that wee receiue no letters from you; For, with those windes that should serue you hither, we should saile from hence; which if they had serued, we would not haue lien waiting at Corcyra. Looke therfore vnto your selfe, and get strength: and when co

                   I thought you were firmely resolu'd, not to put your selfe vpon the voyage, before you were well recouered. I approued your determination, as now I doe, if you be also of the same opinion. But, after you haue recouered your appetite, if you finde your selfe in state to follow mee, doe your pleasure. I haue sent Mario to you, that if you thinke good to come, he may beare you companie. If not, I would haue him presen

Bee assured, I desire nothing else, but that you should come with your owne ease, if it be possible: but if you perceiue it requisite, to remaine some daies in Patrae, for your better recouerie; Know, that I desire nothing more, then to haue you cured.

With a verie vnquiet minde, I expect, especially your selfe, and then Mario with your letters. Wee long all, but I aboue the rest, to see you presently, but in no case without your health, good Tiro. And therefore make no haste, I shall thinke I haue euerie daie seen you, so you come lustie and strong vnto vs. I can doe, what is to bee done, without your helpe, and therefore suppose not, that mine owne benefit driues mee, to desire your health, so much as the loue I beare you.

Though Asclapo the Physician assures me, that you shall in short time be cured. Now I must a little exhort you, to bee verie carefull, to recouer your forces. I know your prudence, I know your temperance, and the loue you beare me. I conceiue, you will vse all meanes, to bee speedily with vs, which I excedingly desire, so you may take no hurt thereby. I would not haue you carried away with Lyso's harmony, lest you lie by it for a whole month. But seeing you would needes rather satisfie his kindnesse, then obserue your owne health, from this time forward take better heed. I haue vsed meanes to Curius, that he should satisfie the Physician, and that hee should supply your wants: And I will pay it here, to whomsoeuer

hee appointeth. I haue left an horse, & a mule for you in Brundusium. I am much affraid, that in the beginning of Ianuarie, there will bee great tumul

It would be good (if you could) to associate your selfe with Messinius, for he was wont to bee warie in voyages. If not, then ioyne with some honorable personage, whom your Pilot may vse respectiuely. If in this, you vse all care, and comfort your selfe in your health, you shall giue me great satisfaction. I haue written to the Physician, to Curius, and Lyso, and recommended you. Farewell: And with safetie.

You would not imagine, with what ioy, both his, and your letters, haue possessed me. And I thankefully congratulate with you. For if the fidelitie of Statius, please me so well: how much more esteeme doth the same propertie deserue, being accompanied with knowledge, dis

Yet if you haue a desire vnto it, let vs, to shunne that enuie you speake of, leaue it out; though I alwayes contemned such like enuie. I am verie glad, your breathing did you so much good. And if the ayre of Tusculanum would bee also helpefull, O Gods! How it would content me. But if you loue me, (which surely you doe, or at least after a cunning manner, you dissemble: yet howsoeuer) attend your recouerie.

Whereupon I repent no longer my silence, but am glad thereof. In that it brought mee wondrous encrease of the fruite of your humanitie: Whereby you haue made good my excuses. I am sure my sweet Tiro, that the good reports, which according to your desire, were spread of me, did highly please you. And I will employ all my endeauour, that this growing opinion of me, may euery day bee more established. Therfore you may securely promise of me, heereafter, a more reformed life, then that which is past, hath at any time beene. Wherein, if I was drawen from the tru

you haue suffer'd for my sake. Vnderstand that I conuerse with Cratippus in an inward fashion, not as a disciple, but as his childe. He hath a sweet manner of discourse, which delights me greatly: Wherefore I am with him all the day, and often, part of the night also. For hee many times meales with mee. And our familiaritie hath proceeded so farre, that many times on a suddaine, he takes vs before wee haue halfe dyned: and laying aside philosophicall conclusions, hee entertaines vs with pl

Whom I neuer suffer to be from me: so modest, and loyall he is. Whose disposition though it be to bee thriftie and graue, yet is he most pleasing companie; and alwaies in matters of learning. Within the compasse whereof wee lay the boundes of our contentments. I haue rented a place for him neere hand, and according to my abilitie, I supplie him.

Besides I conceiu'd, how 'twas not a thing fit, that I should oppose my fathers iudgement; notwithstanding, your office heerein, and counsell, was acceptable to mee.

It is requisite, that the counsell either of the Tribunes, or of some priuate person, should defend the common-wealth. For these two are scarce worthy,
