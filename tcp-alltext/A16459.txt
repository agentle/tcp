               To the Right Honourable, his verie good Lorde, the L. Fraunces Ruſſell, Earle of Bedforde, Knight of the moſt Noble order of the Garter, and one of her Maieſties moſt Honourable priuie Councell, T.

               AS our Sauiour Chriſt (Right Honorable) hath buylded his Church, which he hath ſo1. Cor. 3. 11. Eph. 2. 20. Math. 16. 18. dearely bought, and purchaſed, vpon him ſelfe the onely ſure rocke, and foundation thereof, then the which (as th Apoſtle ſayth) no other can be layde: So on the other ſide, hath Satan alwayes ſought nothing more, then to vndermine, ſhake, and (if it were poſsible) to ouerthrow the ſame. For he well perceiueth, that ſo long as this ſpirituall houſe, & glorious buylding ſtandeth firmly, and ſurely grounded, and founded vpon Chriſt the euerlaſting trueth, the way, and theIo. 14. 6. life, contayned in the doctrine of the Prophets, and Apoſtles: (whiche they not onely haue deliuered to the Church by liuely voyce: but as the faithfull Notaries, and Secretaries of the holy Ghoſt, haue alſo regiſtred, and cōmittedRom. 15. 4. to writing in the ſacred Scriptures, for the

continuall comfort, and inſtruction thereof:) it remayneth vnremoueable, and inuincible agaynſt hell gates, and all the formes, and tempeſts rayſed agaynſt it, by him, and all hisMath. 7. 24. 25. Io. 8. 44. inſtruments. Wherefore he layeth all his batterie, and bendeth all his forces agaynſt this foundation, labouring by falſehood, and lyes, whereof he is the father, to corrupt, depraue, alter, obſcure, and deface the Goſpell of Chriſt, and the worde of life: and thereby to ſubuert, and ouerturne, or at the leaſt, to weaken, and ſhake the fayth of the faithfull, reſting wholle therevpon. This hath bene euer from the beginning his practiſe, and is at this lay, and ſhal be vntill his kingdome be vttterly remoued, and taken away. Wherefore he is fitly namedIo. 8. 44. by Chriſt, a lyer, and a murtherer from the beginning. For as by lyes he laboreth eyther to extinguiſh, and aboliſh, eyther to diſcredite, and peruert the trueth of the worde: So doth he therby intende, and purpoſe the murdering, and deſtruction of mankinde both body, and ſoule. For the which cauſe our Sauiour Chriſt, as a moſte wiſe, and prouident, and therwithall louing, and carefull head, and gouernour of his people: foreſeeing the daungerous, and malicious attempt of his, and their aduerſaries, giueth warning thereof vnto them before hande, that they might not be founde vnprouided, and vnfurniſhed, when they ſhould be aſſaulted, and ſo by ſecuritie, and careleſnes, looſe the field, and the victorie. Therefore asDeut. 13. well Moſes, and the Prophets, before the comming of Chriſt, inſpired with his ſpirite, as alſo at his comming in fleſh, he him ſelfe, and

his Apoſtles do giue vs a watchworde, and often admoniſhe vs to auoyde, and take heede of falſe Prophets, falſe Apoſtles, and falſe teachers,Math. 7. 15. though they worke ſignes, and myracles, and come in ſheepes clothing, that is, make neuer ſo great a ſhewe of the true Prophets of God in outward apparāce: yea though they (following the ſteppes of their father Satan, who transformeth him ſelfe, the ſooner to2. Cor. 11. 14. 15. deceiue, into an angell of light,) turne them ſelues into the Apoſtles of Chriſt. Herehence is it, that the Apoſtle▪ Paule chargeth the GalathiansGal. 1. 8. 9. not to beleeue an Angell cōming from heauen, but rather to holde him accurſed, if he ſhould teach vnto them any other doctrine, then that which at his mouth they had recevued. In which words he implieth a high, and a waightie reaſon, to wit, that the trueth of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt is ſuch, and ſo great, that not onely no humayne authoritie, and waye of perſwaſion whatſoeuer, ſhould moue vs to forſake the ſame: but that no angelicall, or heauenly meſſenger whatſoeuer ſhoulde perſwade vs to the contrarie thereof. To the ſame purpoſe Iohn willeth the faithfull no
                  •
                to1. Io. 4. 1. beleeue euery ſpirite, but to trye the ſpirites whether they be of God, becauſe many falſe Prophets are entred into the world. But albeit this warning, and ca
                  •
               eat agaynſt falſe Prophets be in diuers places giuen vnto vs: yet then eſpecially doth our Sauiour Chriſt, and his Apoſtles labour to ſtirre vp the godly to a more continuall, and earneſt watchfulnes, and warynes, when they foretell of the ſtate of the later dayes, wherein we liue: by howe muche

they foreſawe thoſe times ſhould be more perilous, then any other, in the which Satan, perceiuingApo. 12. 12. his time, and kingdome to be ſhort, ſhould rage moſt violently, and vſe moſt extreme tyrannie, and put in vre moſt ſtraunge, and vnwonted practiſes to driue them from the onely foundation Chriſte. Take heedeMath. 24. 4. 5. 11. 23. 24. 25. 26. Mar. 13. 21. Luke. 17. 23. (ſayth our Sauiour, ſpeaking of theſe later times) that no man deceiue you, for many ſhall come in my name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceiue many, and there ſhall ariſe falſe Criſtes, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſignes, and wonders, ſo that (if it were poſsible) they ſhould deceiue the very elect, beholde I haue tolde you before. Paule the Apoſtle likewiſe ſayth, that in the later tymes,1. Tim. 4. 1. 2. 3. 2. Tim. 3. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. which he therfore calleth perilous, men ſhould depart from the fayth, and ſhould giue heede vnto ſpirites of error, and doctrines of diuels, which ſhould ſpeake lyes through hypocriſie, and haue their conſciences burned with a hote yron: that moreouer ſome ſhould haue a ſhewe of godlines, but ſhould denie the power thereof, from which he willeth vs to turne awaye: that as Iames, and Iambres reſiſted Moſes, ſo ſhould theſe reſiſt the truth, being men of corrupt mindes, and reprobate concerning the fayth. Peter alſo, & Iude, declare that there2. Pet. 2. 1. 2. 3.

                  nd. 4. 18. ſhould be falſe teachers, which ſhould priuily bring in damnable hereſies, euen denying the Lord that had bought them, and that many ſhould folow their deſtructions, by whom the waye of trueth ſhould be euill ſpoken of, and ſhould turne the grace of God into wantonnes, and deny God the onely Lordae, and our

Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. But that is chiefly to be2. Theſ. 2. 3. 4. 8. 9. 10. 11. conſidered, and marked, which the Apoſtle Paule writeth of Antichriſt, and his comming. For before the later day, he ſheweth that there ſhould come an Apoſtacie, and departing fromAntichriſt. the faith, and that the man of ſinne ſhould be diſcloſed, euen the ſonne of perdition, which is an aduerſary, and exalteth him ſelfe agaynſt all that is called God, and is worſhipped: ſo that he ſhall ſit as God, in the temple of God, ſhewing him ſelfe that he is God, that euen in his time the myſterie of iniquitie began to be wrought, that his comming ſhould be with the effectual working of Satan, with al power and ſignes, and lying wonders: and in all deceaueablenes of vnrighteouſnes among them that periſhe, becauſe they receiued not the truth, that they might be ſaued: and that therfore God ſhould ſende them ſtrong illuſions, that they might beleue lyes, that all might be damned, which beleeued not the trueth, but had pleaſure in vnrighteouſnes. In theſeThe liuely deſcription of the kingdome of Antichriſt. words the Apoſtle doth moſt fully, and liuely ſet foorth the whole kingdome of Antichriſt, to wit, that he ſhould bring with him a departing from the fayth, as the word doth ſounde, that he ſhould be openly diſcouered to the world to be the man of ſinne, full of all abhominall and haynous attempts agaynſt the maieſtie of God, that he ſhould be the childe of perdition, working his owne and others deſtruction: that he ſhould not onely directly ſet and oppoſe him ſelfe, but alſo exalt and lift vp him ſelfe agaynſt God: that he ſhould ſitte with authoritie in the Church of God, and aduaunce

him ſelfe as God: he declareth further, that euen from the time of the Apoſtles, Satan hath priuily ſought to laye the foundation of this his Antichriſtian kingdome: and the meanes to bring the ſame to paſſe, he alſo deſcribeth, to wit, that it was done by the effectuall and mightie working of Satan, with all power, and lying ſignes, wonders, and myracles, and all ſubtiltie, craft, and deceite. Finally he ſheweth who they are that ſhall be ſeduced, and deceiued thereby, namely, they that are caſtawaies, and ordeined to deſtruction: and he addeth therewithall a reaſon thereof: the contempt of the trueth, whereby they might be ſaued: and that this ſhall be the iuſt iudgement of God, to giue them therefore ouer to the ſtrong illuſion of ſeducing, and erroneous ſpirites, to their vtter confuſion, & deſtruction.
            Theſe things (Right Honorable) beeing conſidered, and layde together, and compared both with the former, and the preſent ſtate of the Church of Chriſt on the one ſide, and the pernitious practiſes of Satan in both: we ſhall eaſily perceiue that in the later, he hath farre paſſed the former: and that in both, he hath euer ſtriuen agaynſt Chriſt the foundation of his Church: and the very effectes do declare the ſame, if we looke but a litle therevnto. For immediatly at the firſt publiſhing of the Goſpell,1. Cor. 1. 23. he brought to paſſe, that Chriſt became a ſtumbling blocke, and a rocke of offence vnto the Iewes, as he is alſo at this day: and toIewes. the Greekes and Gentiles fooliſhnes, as likewiſeGentiles. in their ofſpring, the Cerinthians, Marcionites, Maniches. Arrians, Neſtorians, Eurichians,Heretikes. and ſuch like heretikes oppugning his

diuine and humaine nature: and at laſt in the Turkes we ſee it euidently come to paſſe. All which waying the doctrine of Chriſt crucified, with the balances, and waightes of humayne reaſon, the courſe of nature, Philoſophie, and mans wiſedome, haue accounted it but mere folly and playne vanitie. Neuertheles theſeAntichriſt and his doctrine. being open, and profeſſed enemies, and caſte out of the body and bowels of the Churche, haue not bin ſo hurtfull and daungerous, asConcil.

By this Romiſhe Antichriſt, and his members, Satan

hath more mightily preuayled agaynſt theAntichriſt a more deadly enemy to Chriſt and his kingdome, then all other. Church of Chriſt, and ſhaken the foundation thereof, more daungerouſly, ſubtilly, ſecretly, and continually, then euer he did before. For although he hath not in flat wordes with the Iewes, Turks, Arrians, and ſuch like heretikes, denied the Godhead of Chriſt, or his manhood: yet in effect hath he done the ſame, in depriuing him of his office, as I haue ſayde, and the end and ſcope of his comming, which is, to be the onely Chriſt, the annoynted, and holy one of God. Therefore Iohn deſcribing1. Io. 2. 18. 22. 23 Antichriſt, ſayth, he ſhall denie Ieſus to be that Chriſt, and that therein he ſhould deny the father, and the ſonne, becauſe whoſoeuer denieth the ſonne, the ſame hath not the father. And agayne, Euery ſpirite that confeſſeth not Ieſus Chriſt to haue come in the fleſh, is not of1. Io. 4. 2. 3. God, and this is the ſpirite of Antichriſt, of whom ye haue heard, howe that he ſhoulde come, and now already he is in the world.
            But to omit the monſtrous▪ and manifoldeThe means vſed by Antichriſt to ſet vp his kingdome. errors, drawen from the ſinkes and puddles of all heretikes, wherwith this confuſe, and huge Babell of this Antichriſtian kingdome haue bin buylded vp: the meanes, and inſtruments wherby the ſame haue bine brought to paſſe, are rather at this time ſhortly to be noted and marked, as ſeruing moſt vnto my purpoſe. The Apoſtle Paule, as I haue touched before, ſheweth,2. Theſ. 2. that Satan ſhould to the accompliſhing therof, vſe all power, falſhood, deceit, & ſtrange illuſions. And the ſame doth the ſpirit of GodApo. 17. 1. 2. 3. 4 ſet foorth in the Reuelation, by the image of a whore gorgeouſly arayed with purple, and

ſearlet, & attyred with golde, precious ſtones, and pearles: hauing a cuppe of golde in her hande, full of the abhominations, and filthines of her fornication, wherewith ſhe maketh drunken the kings and inhabitauntes of the earth. Hereby the ſpirite of God paynteth out the hypocriticall, and goodly outwarde ſhew, which as well Antichriſt, and his miniſters, as his doctrine ſhould make vnto the world, therby to ſeduce, and deceiue the ſame. This although it may be perceiued to be moſt true frō time to time, in the hypocriticall ſwarmes of Popiſh Abbots, Monkes, Fryers, and ſuche other religious orders, as likewiſe in the ſcholmen, and Canoniſtes, the ſpirituall enchauntments, and bewitchings of whoſe gloſes, diſtinctions, definitions, and concluſions, haue as ſtrong illuſions beguiled the world, and not onely the ſimple ſort, but the very wyſeſt them ſelues, and moſt learned: yet eſpecially the ſame is to be ſeene at this daye, in the new, and lately inuented Secte of the Ieſuites which the Romiſhe Antichriſt hath ſet foorth as the laſte proppe, and ſtaye of his totering, and ruinous kingdome. For he perceiuing, (that as the Apoſtle Paule hath foreſhewed,) Chriſt hath begonne2. Theſ. 2. 8. to conſume it with the breath of his mouth, and aboliſhe it with the brightnes of his comming, that is, the preaching of his glorious Goſpell: and ſeeing moreouer the world to growe to a diſliking, and contempt of the ignoraunce, ſluggiſhnes, and lewdnes of their other orders taken from men, as Dominicke, Benedict, Fraunces, and ſuche like: hath ſent abroade into Chriſtendome this newe Secte,

hypocritically adorned with the name of Ieſus, & furniſhed with more ſhew of learning, holines, & godlines, thē their other Popiſh fraterternities: to the entent that Ieſus Chriſt mayMat. 26. 49. be the ſooner betrayed, while theſe holy Ieſuites giue him a Iudas ſalutation, and kiſſe.The Ieſuits giue Ieſus a Iudas ſalutation and kiſſe. And becauſe he ſtandeth in good hope that theſe be the men, by whom he ſhall recouer agayne, that ſo large a circuit of ground, which hee hath loſte, and Chriſte by his Goſpell hath gotten in Germany, Fraunce, Englande, Scotlande, Denmarke, Swethlande, and other countries in Chriſtendome: he maketh great account of them, and chiefly fauoureth, cheriſheth,The Ieſuites the Popes chiefe hope. encourageth, and aduaunceth them: beſtowing vpon them to the mayntenaunce, and increaſe of their nurceries and Seminarie houſes, great Abbaſies, lands, liuings, & ſumptuous buyldings, in Italy, Fraunce, and ſome partes of Germany. Furthermore, he vſeth this ſpeciall policie, to cauſe them by al meanesOur Vniuerſities of Oxforde and Cambrige haue had to muche experience thereof. priuily to allure, and entice the youth of the Vniuerſities, and countries, where the Goſpell is preached, to depart from the places where they are, vnto theſe their Seminary houſes, to the ende, that being there for a time nouſeled, and trayned vp, vntill they be hardened in hypocriſie, obſtinacie, and malice agaynſt the trueth, and poyſoned with the peſtilent errors of the Romiſh Antichriſt: they may be ſent out as newe falſe Apoſtles into their owne countries, or els thither, where it is thought they may do moſt harme. Whenn they folow their forefaithers the Scribes, and Phariſes, the like hypocrites, who (as Chriſt ſayth) compaſſedMat. 23. 15.
               
the ſea and land, to make one proſelite, or of their profeſsion: and when he is made, make him two folde more the childe of hell, then they them ſelues: And therfore that heauy woe which Chriſt pronounced agaynſt the Phariſees, muſt needes, if they repent not, light vpon theſe Ieſuites, whoſe wicked example, as in diuers other things, ſo in this they doe embrace.
            The conſideration of theſe ſpirituall practiſes of Satan in this newe ſupplye of falſe Prophets of Antichriſt, wherewith he oppugneth our fayth, beſides the outwarde forces, and worldly policies and enterpriſes, which he ioyneth therewithall: as alſo the peſtilent ſeedes of Arrianiſme, Anabaptiſme, Libertiniſme, the Familie of Loue, Epicuriſme, and Atheiſme, which he hath euery where ſowen, (I feare me,Math. 13. 24. while the Shepheards of Iſraell were a ſleepe:) ought to awaken al the profeſſors of the Goſpell, and to make vs to looke about vs, and to ſtande continually (as it were) vpon watch and ward, eſpecially thoſe whom the Lorde hath appoynted to be watchmen, & ouerſeers of his people. Nowe the waye to withſtande theſeThe waye to auoyde Satans & his miniſters temptations & aſſaltes. ſtrong temptations of Satan, and his miniſters, is to ſticke faſte vnto Chriſt the foundation of our fayth, deliuered vnto vs by the Goſpell of trueth: and (as he giueth vs warning) as good Eagles to flee to the carkaſe, and therevpon toMat. 24. 13. 28. reſt and perſeuere vnto the ende: ſtopping our eares at the voyce of all falſe prophets, and lying ſpirites, which goe about to withdrawe vsIo. 10. from the ſame, and acknowledging onely, as the good ſheepe of Chriſt, his voyce beeing

our true and onely head ſhepheard, ſpeaking vnto vs in his holy worde. And to the intente our countreymen, which as yet are not ſo wel acquaynted with the name, profeſsiō, doctrine, and purpoſes of theſe Ieſuites, (and therefore are the ſooner to be deceiued thereby) may be the better armed, and prouided agaynſt them: I haue thought good to tranſlate this little Treatiſe into our mother tong, written in Latine by a learned, and godly man, beeing publike profeſſor of Diuinitie in the Vniuerſitie of Heidelberge, who as wel for that he remayned in that place, neare vnto the whiche they haue buylded ſome of their 
                  •
               eaſtes: as alſo for that he had diligently read ſome of their bookes, had good cauſe to knowe them. The methode, and order which he vſeth, and the matter therein conteined, I truſt is ſuch as can not miſlike the godly: and I had rather the ſame ſhould be gathered by the reading therof, then by my report. Only this I will ſay, that I thinke it to be very neceſſarie, and profitable for this preſent time, and occaſion: wherein we are newly and freſhly aſſaulted by theſe Antichriſtian Champions, albeit with the olde and rouſty weapons, ſomewhat ſcowred and burniſhed: but of the ſame edge and force that the other were of. They maye be perhaps terrible to thoſe, which only looke vpon the brightnes thereof, but not to them which haue more regard to the ſharpnes, & ſtrength of the ſame, as in the late combate with them by triall it was founde. As for the cauſes which haue moued me to dedicate this ſmall labour vnto your Honour, they are two. The one,

becauſe the Author making his choyſe, hath offered the ſame vnto a moſt godly Earle: and therefore hath moued me to tender the ſame, to a perſonage of no leſſe honor and godlynes: that it may come into the hands of men, with the better acceptation, and liking. Secondly, for the priuate duetie, and thankfulnes, which I owe vnto your Honor, in reſpect of that courteſie, and good will your Honour hath extended as vnto all other, of my calling, ſo alſo vnto me. And becauſe I was not able to do that which other haue done of their owne abilitie in this matter, I haue (rather then I would doe nothing) borowed of an other to ſupplye my want. Howſoeuer it be, my good will hath not wanted. This onely is my deſire, at the Lords hands, that, as I hope, your Honour will not refuſe this ſo ſimple a duetie of my parte: ſo the fruite and benefite thereof may come vnto many. The Lorde encreaſe his ſinguler giftes, and bleſsings in your Honour, to his glory. From London the thirde of Nouember. 1581.

               I 
               Am perſuaded with ſome of my friendes often exhortations (noble Earle) to ſuffer to bee publiſhed, ſuche thinges as I haue thought vpon, touching the newe order of Monks, which Italy an other Affricke in this kinde, hath lately brought into Chriſtendome. For ſithens I hard both of the title wherewith this newe army of Satan bewtifieth it ſelfe, as alſo the ſuttletie with which it inſinuateth it ſelfe to the worlde: many thoughtes entred into my minde, as well of the continuall hatred of this enemy againſt Chriſt: as of his craft, and power in aſſaulting the Church. For
               The conſideration of Satans continuall hatred, and craft againſt the 
               as he ſheweth a ſingular wylines in his deuiſes: So in the execution, and performance thereof, hee declareth a maruellous
               
               power, wherewith he is endued: the
               Church profitable to the godly. 
               earneſt meditation, and conſideration whereof, I thinke to be a great helpe, and furtherance vnto godlines. VVherefore I ſuffered my ſelfe the rather to bee perſuaded, to communicate to the gentle readers (for others I make no account of,) ſuch things as came into my minde. And whereas I ſee the cuſtome of dedicating, and inſcribing vnto ſome man newe workes, to haue bene receiued of all men: and the ſame to be both ancient, and not vngodly, it may be perceiued by the onlie example of our Euangeliſt Luke: who
               Luk. 1. 4. Act. 1. 3. 
               doubted not to dedicate his hiſtorie of the Goſpell, and the Actes of the Apoſtles, to a man which in deed loued God, & godlines: I thought good to follow him. Now while I conſidered, vnto whom I ſhoulde offer this my labour, who might bee not ſo much a Patron, as an indifferent iudge thereof: you eſpecially (noble Earle) for your ſingular godlines, learning, and curteſie, ioyned with great wiſedome came vnto my minde. For I knowe your iudgement to be ſuch, and ſo ſound: that thoſe which profeſſe them ſelues to loue, and fauour the trueth, and godlines: may ſafely,
               
               and worthilie reſt in him. Therefore I truſt, you will accept the ſame, according to your curteſie, with the like minde, I preſent it vnto you: that is to ſay ſincere, and well meaning. And ſo you ſhall haue me now alreadie ſundry wayes indebted vnto you for your ſingular gentlenes, hereafter moſt beholding vnto you.

               THey that earneſtly conſider the ſtate, & condition of the Churche of Chriſte vvhile it is a ſtraunger in this world, & doe diligently marke the courſe, and proceeding thereof: doe eaſily perceiue, howe truely, and aptly it is commonly compared to a ſhipThe Church of Chriſt like a ſhip in the ſea. toſſed with diuers windes in the midſt of the troubleſome ſea, and ſhaken with many tempeſtes following one the other: & how rightly alſo it is called of ſome the militant, or warfaring Church.

For it neuer enioyeth ſure peace, no not ſo muche as ſafe truce: but if there ſeeme to bee any, the ſame is full of treachery.

For that perpetuall enemye of Chriſt, is neuer quiet, is neuer weary, doth alwayes enuy his dignitie, glorie, and power: and hee neuer ceaſeth to lye in waite for the life, and ſaluation of the godly, and is neuer ſatisfied with their blood. And although he may ſeeme ſometime to abate, and ſlake a litle of the fiercenes of his endeuour, yet hee ſtill remaineth one, nothing ceaſing his hatred, and deſire to worke miſchiefe. Therefore he raiſeth vp euer nevv ſouldiors againſt the hoſt of Chriſte, and ſendeth thē forth furniſhed with new weapons,Satan raiſeth enemies out of the Church, againſt the Church. & deceits. And that which is more to be maruelled at, this enemy and wonderfull practiſer, euen from the beginning hath craftily ſought out of the verie boſome, and as it were the verie bowels of the Church, thoſe by whome hee might vnder the pretence of truth, and godlines, trouble, ſhake, and labour to ouerthrow the kingdom of Chriſt, to wit, his church. Which thing they that are readers of antiquitie, and skilfull in the Church

hiſtories, doe well knowe. Yea, and our age is full of plaine, teſtimonies, and examples thereof: inſomuch that there is nothing to bee wiſhed, but that we diligently conſider of theſe thinges. NeitherChriſt for good cauſe exhorteth vs to watchfulnes, eſpecially the ſhephcards of the flocke. ought any man to maruel that our beſt guide Chriſt, doeth ſo often and ſo earneſtlye exhorte his vnto continuall watchfulnes: eſpecially thoſe, whoſe duetie it is to watch, and to haue charge ouer the ſaluation of the people. Vnto the which care euen their Captaines continuall preſence, and defence ought to edge them, and to ſturre them vp. For as he is neuer abſent, ſo he neuer either ſleepeth, or ceaſeth, beeing much more readier, and abler to giue ſaluation promiſed vnto thoſe that beleeue in him: then the enemy is to bereaue them of the ſame. Wherefore if any thing be wanting in this behalfe to them that fight vnder his banner, the fault is altogether in them ſelues: neither haue they to blame any thing, but their owne either perfidiouſnes,

either ſlouthfulnes. Verely it were a ſhamefull thing, and worthie grieuous puniſhment in this caſe, to bee ouercome, or yeld to the enemy. For what can bee more blame woorthie, then that there ſhould bee more endeuour, diligence, & paines taken in mainteining of falſhood, then in defending the trueth, in eſtabliſhing vngodlines, thē in vpholding of godlines: in procuring an others deſtruction, then in preſeruing our owne ſaluation? Many examples we haue old, and newe of the diligence, and faithfulnes, that as well all Chriſtians, as chiefly they that ſuſteine the perſons of teachers, ought in this behalfe to render vnto Chriſt. That ſome are ignorant of the old, I eaſily doe beleeue: but that any almoſt ſhould not knowe the newe, I can not bee perſuaded.The attempts of the miniſters of ſatan, and Antichriſt to put out the light of the Goſpell lately by

For they know which are rightly inſtructed in theſe miſteries, that God by theſe ſignes, as it were viſible wordes (asAuguſtin. Sainte Auguſtine is wonte to call thē) doth ſpeake vnto thoſe that haue their eyes to ſée, and by theſe meanes doth teache them that are willinge to be taughte. Like as then theſe ſacramentall ſignes hath euerye one their ſignifications apte, and agréeable to the inſtitution of God: ſo by theſe titles, they that are choſen, and placed in thoſe functions, are put in mind of their dueties. Wherefore euen as in the ſacraments, they that vnderſtand not what the ſignes meane, doe receaue

them to their deſtruction, as prophaners thereof: ſo they that vſurpe the titles of theſe orders and adorne themſelues therewithall, and yet performe not the things ſignifyed thereby: doubtles they ſhall be iuſtly puniſhed in their due time of God the reuenger of ſo greate wickedneſſe, as vniuſt vſurpers of holy thinges. And let theſs iolly fellowes tell me (I pray you) which no leſſe fondlye, or rather unpudently, then boldly, do faine and take to themſelues names at theyr pleaſure: if any man in a well ordered common wealth, ſhould take vpon him, any name belonginge to the chéefe Magiſtrate, as of a kinge, or ſuch like, or ſhould vſe the title appertayning to any other dignitie: ſhould not he (vnleſſe hee were holden of all men for a foole,) be ſayd to haue vſurped the magiſtracie, and bée proclaymed giltie of high treaſon?

ſo peculiar vnto the ſonne of God, that not ſo much as the leaſt parte thereof, can without greeuous ſacriledge, be turned ouer vnto any other: hereaſter I hope it ſhal moſt clerely be declard. As for the title Chriſt, the writingesChriſt. of the Prophetes, and Apoſtles doth with one conſent witneſſe, that it hath bene geuen vnto him by the ſame authoritie, For whatſoeuer hath bene, by the one foreſhewed, and promiſed of the Mesſiah: the other ſheweth euery where, after his comming to haue bene performed. But to what purpoſe ſhoulde I rehearſe theſe thinges beinge ſo wel knowne. I will onely ſpeake a fewe words, which ſemeth to me, to ſerue to the fuller openinge of my purpoſe. Firſt that the nameI of Ieſus, is the proper name of theIeſus the proper name of the ſonne of God, Chriſt the name of his office. Sonne of God, manifeſted in the fleſhe: as the name Iohn is the proper name of the forerunner. For in Luke it is certaine, that both theſe names were geuen vnto them both, by the commaundement of God, and warninge of the Angell. But the worde Chriſt, is a title of dignitie, noting his

office, geuen as the wordes Prophet, Forerunner, Baptiſt, ſignifieth the office laid by God vpon Iohn: which thing as not vnworthie the marking, is of learned and godly Fathers oftenTertull. od

Tertullian, to paſſe ouer other, writeth againſt Praxaes, that the worde Chriſt, is rather a terme of office, then a name, and doth ſignifie a thing which is accidentall vnto the name. Secōdly we muſt vnderſtand alſo that this title, before the comming of the ſonne of God in fleſhe, was without controuerſie geuen vnto diuers other: in as much as they bare the figure of him, in ſome part of his office. By the ſame reaſon Moyſes,The title Chriſt geuen vnto the old kinges and Prophetes as figures of Chriſt. Aaron, Dauid the prophets were in olde time called Chriſts, but he for an eſpeciall cauſe was with this title honoured of his Father, as the head,Pſal. 105. ver. 15 fountaine, and ſcope of all other. As touching the name of Ieſu, ſome learned men doubt, and hold not only the thing ſignified by the name to be proper altogether to this only Sonne of God by nature, but alſo the verie name it ſelfe. And albeit this controuerſie

may ſeme to be of no greate waight: yet it ſerueth to encreaſe their wickedneſſe, which euen ſine the opening of this miſtery, and the moſt cleare reuealing of the Fathers counſaile: are not affraid to take this name vnto them ſelues as chieke mates with the Sonne of God. Thirdly it3 is more to be noted, that the vnbelieuing Iewes did moue no queſtion againſt Chriſt touchinge the name of Ieſus, yea rather they yéeld it willingly vnto him as apeareth by the ſtorye of the Goſpell namely after Iohn. But as for the tytle of Chriſt, ſo farre of was it, that they yeelded it vnto him: that they excōmunicated from theire Sinagoges, all that gaue the ſame vnto him: whereof there is a plaine decrée of theirs in the 9.

Out ofProfitable doctrine may be gathered out of this reprehenſion of Paule. which ſo ſharp and earneſt complaint of the Apoſtle, a man may gather and learne diuers and profitable thinges. Firſt, we ſée Sathan the ſworne enemie of Chriſt & his church, to be moſt buſily bent, ſo ſoone as any companye

is gathered together vnder the name & banner of Chriſt, to trouble, deuide, ſunder and ſcatter it. Verely it is moſtSatan readie to ſet vp his Synagogue where Chriſt hath his Church. fitly & moſt truely ſaid, as ſone as this enemie perceyueth that there is any church ſet vp in his name, that he byldeth neare thereunto a chappel to him ſelfe, to worke the ouerthrow thereof.
               Secondly, we learne how tender a thing the vnitie and conſente of the church in Chriſt is, and how eaſilye it is ſhaken and diſſolued, if once any chinke be made: and this enemie get in by neuer ſo litle a creuice, he ſodēly breaketh the whole lincking together thereof.

               Laſtly, to paſſe ouer many other thinges which this plentifull and godly place of the Apoſtle doth offer. It is euidently perceaued by the reaſons

which he bringeth, and vttereth with great vehemencie: that they which cleaue not wholy vnto Chriſt, & depēdThey that ſtick not wholy to Chriſt, deuide him and deceue themſelues. not altogether of him, but are caryed with affection els where, and doe glorie as the Apoſtle him ſelfe ſaith in men, doe deuide him and breake their promiſe made vnto him: and moreouer doe cut of themſelues from him, and therewithall he cleerely ſheweth, euen by the things which he chargeth them with, to their ſhame, for attempting thereof: that they knew nether fully, neither rightly, Chriſt crucified, notwithſtāding they were baptiſed in his name. But in ſtead of very Chriſt, to ſpeake plainly, that they had deuiſed vnto themſelues a certain ſhadow, and a very image or idole of him.

                  s together, is not only to match ſmal thinges with greate, but alſo the leaſt with the greateſt, to be ſhort, it is to match a flye with an Elephant. But to the intent all menSathans ſuttle beginnings, and proceedings in vnderminig the church of Chriſt. may ſomwhat better iudge of the matter, let vs a while conſider the ſleight and cunning of this deceiuer Sathan.

Let vs beholde, as it were through a window, what hath bene his beginninges, and his procéedinges, when he purpoſed to weaue this long web, to wit, when he once determined with him ſelfe either to ouerthrow or ſhake the kingdome of Chriſt, which againſt his will he ſaw cōtinually to encreaſe: he woulde craftely begin with ſmall beginninges, that hys craft might not eaſily be eſpyed.
               Moreouer, he woue his web ſuttlely,Satan began with ſmall beginnings to hide his intent. Satan made his way vnder the pretence of rare holines and godlines. vnder the colour and ſhew of godlines. For this deceauer knew that religion could not be more ſharplye aſſaulted, then vnder the viſor of religiō. He knew that the deſire of honeſt ſolitarines, hatred of the world, or (as Iohn deſcrybeth it) of the things that are in the world, made a goodly ſhew in mennes eyes: that ſecrete places gaue great oportunitie to the reading and meditation of holy Scripture, to continuall prayers, and the endeuour of all kinde of good works. All which things ſeme to geue a taſte as it were of the heauenly and euerlaſtinge life. With this pretence of religion departing

into ſolitarines, men began toThe ſimplicitie and puritie of the Goſpell forſaken. departe from the ſimplicitie, and therwithall the puritie of chriſtian religiō. The way was forſaken which Chriſt and his Apoſtles by worde and déede ſet forth. And the eyes of many being bewitched with theſe ſleightes of Sathan, and their mindes being mooued with noueltie, (ſuch is mans vanitie and curioſitie) they ſuffred themſelues wholy to be ouertaken, and poſſeſſed of the enemie of true godlines. For after he had once made his way, vnder this goodly cloake, to change, and innouate thinges, he ſo procéeded inThe proceedings of Satan in corrupting the Goſpel more and more. changing, innouating, and adding to, that at laſt he lefte nothing of the olde trade, and made all thinges new: the thing it ſelfe ſheweth how true that common ſaying is, A little error at the beginning, proueth to be greate in the end. Becauſe theſe beginnings were not ſtopped, and ſuch remedy was not applyed as Paul vſed in the church of Corinth: this peſtilent diſeaſe ouerran welnere ye whole church of Chriſt For ye enemy ſo by litle & litle brought in, and ſet out to lyking, his darcknes,

Moſt euident truely it is, and can not be denied, but thoſe that are obſtinately lewde, that they haue bin ſo as it were by litle and litle encreaſed, and heaped vp, ſome being partly borowed of the Iewes, by fond imitation: and partly receiued of prophane Gentiles, inſomuch that the ſtate of the olde Iewes in this behalfe is more tollerable then of the newe Chriſtians. And the trueChriſtian religion became rather Heatheniſh then Chriſtian. worſhip which Chriſt with his owne mouth had taught, and the Apoſtles both by voice deliuered vnto ye church, and lefte in writing to the poſtoritie,

At length chriſtianitie thus being vtterly ouerthrowen, mē ſel ſo to lothe the very name, ſo that many began to bée aſhamed, and weary thereof, and other titles were ſought out from the names of men, being partly vngodly, partly obſcure, and to ſay nothing bitterly, fooliſhe. Therfore this marueilous practiſerThe name of a Chriſtian loathed, and the names of men receiued. Sathan hath by his ſubtleties brought to paſſe that Chriſt ſhould be baniſhed out of his owne kingdome: ſhould be a ſtranger in his own houſe: and ſhoulde be withdrawen and quite taken away from their eyes, eares, and mindes whiche pretended themſelues to fight vnder his banner. ForChriſt by theſe practiſes made a ſtranger in his owne kingdom. they that were baptized in the name of Chriſt: & had made promiſe vnto him, woulde neuer either take vnto themſelues, either ſuffer themſelues to be called by the names either of Angels, or men, or any other thing were it of neuer ſo great value: if they had truly knowne him to whom they had

addicted themſelues: and if they had rightly vnderſtood what he required of them, and had couenanted with them: or what they had promiſed vnto him. For it coulde not haue come to paſſe, that they ſhoulde haue ioyned themſelues vnto any other, vnleſſe firſt they had departed from him. Uerely this may thereby be plainly perceiued, which is writter of ſome auncient writers: that the Emperour TyberiusTertul. in Apo. Auguſt. de ci

For the Senate caſtly perceiued that they were to let goe all their other Gods, whom they had receiued, if they ſhoulde receiue him. Which reaſon if the Romiſhe churchThe Heatheniſh Romaines may teach the Romiſh Church to worſhip Chriſt alone. had diligently wayed, it woulde neuer haue entertained ſuche a company of Mediators, as it doeth nowe. For it would lightly perceiue, that it coulde not holde Chriſt together with them. For chriſtian religion acknowledgeth

and worſhippeth as one God, ſo one Mediator, and doth adorne or honour with the onely chriſtian name all thoſe that worſhip him.

               DIuers thinges haue heretofore of ſome bene written touching the originall, the reaſon, and ſundry alluſions of the name Ieſuite, whiche I néede not to repeate. What I thinke I will vtter ſimply, and without cauils. For to ieſt, much leſſe to cauil, it liketh me not in ſo earneſt a matter. I will eaſily graunt vnto the deuiſers thereof, that they haue deriued it, from the name of Ieſus after the ſame maner, by which ſometimes they yt canie of Iſrael were called Iſraelites: and at this day they are called Ioanites, and Iacobites whiche will be called, and thought to be followers of Iohn and Iames. For the knot we nowe ſeeke, lyeth not in that thing. For we

are in hande nowe not with the propertie of the worde, but with the truth and godlines of the Ieſuites profeſſion. Firſt as I doe like very well that theſe newe fellowes (that I may notThe Ieſuites wherein to be liked in taking their names of Ieſus, & wherin not. defraude them of their praiſe) by this name fained of themſelues, doe plainly ſignifie that they doe reprooue, and condemne the authours of former Sectes which gaue them names, taken from mens names (by whiche thing it is manifeſt that they ſpread abroad no ſmall ſéedes of S

their owne heades, take vnto themſelues an other, hitherto vnheard of, and nothing agréeing with them, and which is ioyned with no ſmall reproch of Chriſt the Sauiour of all the faithfull. Euerie man knoweth that the name of Ieſuites is newe. Now thatNoueltie in religion to be auoided. noueltie as in all other things, ſo eſpecially in the cauſe of religion, is greatly to be auoided, all the godly and learned doe well warne vs, which thing the Apoſtles, by their example haue approoued. For when the doctrine of the Goſpell was at the firſt ſlaundered by the enemies, with the name of Noueltie, we plainly perceiue by their writings: that they, eſpecially Paule did diligentlyendeuour to ſhake of this ſlaunder. And in ſuche why ſhoulde newe names be deuiſed, but to ſignifie newe thinges? it is not miſliked of the learned, that newe names, be deuiſed for newe thinges.

But where as theſe of this fellowſhip,When it is lawfull to inuent newe names to newe things. will ſéeme for that purpoſe, to haue flockt together, and to haue come forth into the worlde, that they might reſtore the auncient godlines: what eyther profite could leade, or neceſſitie force them to deuiſe this name? Firſt1 of all by that newe name they promiſe an other thing then they perfourme, and ſo it commeth to paſſe that they themſelues are cōtrarie to themſelues. Secondly, howe agreeth this newe2 name with the auncient doctrine, and religion? Truely no more then a péeceMath. 9. verſ. 16 of newe or rawe, and vndreſſed cloth, with an olde garment, as Chriſt ſaith.

               Furthermore this late ſect vndertaketh either to ſet forth, the doctrine and religion of the Prophetes, and Apoſtles: either ſome other contrarie thervnto. If it profeſſe that it bringeth the ſame, what fondneſſe is it, to make that thing ſuſpicious, and odious, with a new name, which as it is moſt true, ſo is it moſt ancient? But if it bringeth a contrarie, there is no cauſe why it ſhould be offended with vs, if we bid it to be gone with his forgeries, and pronounce it to be accurſed: ſéeing the

Apoſtle of Chriſt, Gal. the firſt willethGal. 1. verſ. 28. vs to doe the ſame, yea againſt an Angell of heauen. For as Chriſt is ſayde to haue made newe all things, and the world it ſelfe with his firſt comming: ſo before his returne againe, the doctrine of the Apoſtles promiſeth, or willeth vs to looke for no newe change in this reſpect. Let vs alſo ſée, whetherThe Ieſuires newe name a marke of Schyſme. this newly deuiſed name, doe not manifeſtly marke in the forhead with the print of Schiſme this newe ſect? For God who is moſte deſirous of peace, concord and vnitie, hath endeuoured to commend the ſame by all maner of meanes vnto his Church: as the place of Paule to the Epheſians, 4. ChapterEpheſ. 4. verſ. 3. 45. doeth moſt plainly teach. For thoſe whom he had choſen before the foundations of the world, in his moſt deare Sonne, he would gather together at his appointed time béeing ſcattered through the whole worlde, and aſſemble them vnto him, his firſt begotten Sonne, as the Captaine, and ſhepheard of all: and couple them as members of one bodie vnto their head. Hée commaunded nothing ſo diligently as

vnitie, which he hath eſtabliſhed with a fellowſhip of all thinges amongeſt them, whiche appertaine vnto godlineſſe: as with the word, faith, the Sacramentes, the ſpirite, and ſuch lyke: in the which, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, there is no difference betwéene the Iewe, and the Gréeke, the wiſe and the ignorant, the maiſter and the ſeruant, man and woman, but all are one, that is one Chriſt. And who ſo ſeeth not herehenſe, that it came to paſſe by the wil and counſell of this father: that all were called by the onely name of Chriſtians, euen from the beginning of this aſſembling together by the preaching of the Goſpell? Therefore it is plaine, that this name is as it were a certaine othe, and band of that vnitie: which he vtterly breaketh, and looſeth, that taketh to him ſelfe any other, vnder whatſoeuer pretence hée doeth it: which thing alſo the place before cited out of the firſt Epiſtle and1.

admoniſhing vs of naturall loue, it appeareth that there is alſo contained a profeſſion in religion: to deuiſe therfore any other without neceſſitie, is it not a certaine kinde of denyall, and forſaking? There is extant in Gratians decrées 11. Cauſe. and 3. Queſt.Gra. d

What ſhall I ſay, that thoſe of this felowſhip will ſéeme for that cauſe to haue bin aſſembled, that they might gather, and ioyne together others, and to ſeparate themſelues. If this be their purpoſe, as they beare in hand, why doe they not firſt in themſelues ſhew a token of vnitie, and not hauing neyther author nor cauſe, by euill and hurtfull example, further diuiſion and breaking aſunder. Why doe they by deuiding, ouerthrow that which hath beene ordeyned by the authoritie of our maſter Chriſt, and is confirmed by the conſent and example of all the godly antiquitie? I rememberThe Sorboniſts ridiculous articles. when as our maſters the Sorboniſtes

were once very careful and circumſpect on euery ſide to prouide, not for the common good of Chriſtendome, but for their own bellie and authority: did publiſh articles (for ſo theſe Prophets forſooth did call thoſe oracles, to witte, their determinations & decrees ſet forth againſt them whom they call Lutheranes) In one of the which, the laſt ſauing one to my remembrance, it was flatly forbidden, that any man in teaching ſhould vtter Chriſt ſeuerally from Ieſus. Which decrée were it neuer ſo fooliſh, was vrged ſo ſtraitly, that I being accuſed by four FranciſcanThe Authors danger for naming Chriſt without Ieſus. Fryers, and hauing the biſhop of Claremount the chiefe Patrone of the Ieſuites, plaintiffe againſte mee, was conſtrayned with danger of my life, to anſwere at the bar, before Peter Lizet, that worthy preſidente forſooth, a litle before hee was made of Preſident, Abbot. Neuertheles we ſée Peter and Martha in their confeſſiōs, and Paule euery where in his Epiſtles, to haue offended againſt that article▪ without any cōtrolemēt. I marnel therfore that theſe worthy watchmen,

doe not rather bende their lightnings againſt theſe of this felowſhip: which contrarie to the oracle and decree of the holy Ghoſt, and the auncyent cuſtome of the church, call themſelues Ieſuites, rather then Chriſtiās.Why the Ieſuites and Sorboniſtes doe ſhun the name of Chriſt. But perhaps betweene theſe two orders of theſe good men, there is this agréement, that they being niece, and deyntie, doe ſhun the croſſe of Chriſt: which we perceaue to haue beene in times paſt, ioyned with the profeſſion of the chriſtian name: But wee reade not any where that I know, that the name of Ieſus carryed with it anye ſuch thing.

But peraduenture they will ſay, that they haue deuyſed and taken that name, to ſignifie and to profeſſe by the name, that they are worſhippers of Ieſu: that is, to beleeue in him, to truſt in him, and to ſeeke for all their ſaluation of him. I anſwere,Anſwere. what, not only curioſitie and vanitie, but alſo what wrong is it for a few to challenge to themſelues that which is common to all the godly, and is conteyned vnder the name of a Chriſtiā, and is intimated by the reuelation of the heauenly Spirite: and for y• cauſe vpon priuate authoritie, to inuent and chuſe to thēſelues a new title: ſhould not this in prophane thinges be accounted theafte? why then in holye thinges ſhould it not be counted ſacriledge? If this new order pretende any priuiledge or prerogatiue, let itThe Ieſuites haue no priuiledge aboue other Chriſtians, to take vpon them the name of Ieſus bring forth a true and very Apoſtolike charter: that is, brought not from the courte of Rome, but from the court of heauen: and let it delyuer it to be examined

and ſcanned of al that hath to do therewith, as euery one hath. Now if it pleaſe them to take this their new title not paſſiuely, but actiuely, that is, to ſpeake plaine, not for ſuch as are ſaued, but are Sauioures, as which profeſſeWhat the Ieſuites doe meane by their name. that they bring helpe to thoſe that otherwiſe being in heauy, and as it were in deſperate caſe, are like to peariſh, as we reade, that God in times paſt, rayſed vp, and ſent ſauioures, or deliuerers to his people of Iſrael, oppreſſedIudg, 3. 15 with their enemies, they goe, as the prouerbe hath, from the lymehouſe, into the colehouſe: that is, fromWhether the Ieſuites be Sauiours or no. one ill defence to another. Neuertheleſſe, the lately inuented deſcription of this name, and which of ſome is ſet before their wrytinges, to qualifie the hardneſſe and abſurditie thereof, as far as I coniecture: to wit, the ſocietie of Ieſus ſéemeth to come neare to this interpretation: as though Ieſus had lately choſen thē to be his colleagues,How the Ieſuites be felowes of Ieſus. and fellow companions, to help wretched men.

As many as haue it, muſte néedes haue receaued it at his handes: and he that receaueth it from him, receaueth it for him ſelfe, not for another. In this behalf he accepteth no vicars, or none in ſteade of other, much leſſe deſireth them. For faith, the only fitte and meete inſtrument to obtaine ſaluation, reacheth vnto him alone, andThe founders of popiſh ſectes iniurious to Chriſt the only foundation. 1. Cor. 3. 11 therefore I ſayd, that the former ſectes were worthely condemned of this latter ſecte, in that reſpecte, that they turned

ouer vnto their fathers, or founders,The founders of popiſh ſectes iniurious to Chriſt the only foundation. 1. Cor. 3. 11 that which the heauenly father would haue to belong only to Chriſt.

Notwithſtanding, leaſt I ſhould ſéeme to conſider other mennes words either too hardly either maliciouſly, I will folow the interpretation, which is both moſt gentleſt, and alſo draweth with it fewer inconueniences: to wit, that they profeſſe this only, that they haue felowſhippe with Ieſus, to the intent they may obteyne ſaluation of him, which the holy Scripture promiſeth to all that beléeue in him.

                  CAP. VI. That without the felowſhip of Ieſu, there remayneth no hope of ſaluation.
               I Truſte that they with whome I deale, wil not deny, but that a man muſt otherwiſe reaſon againſt them, which openly profeſſe themſelues to be enemies of the name of Chriſt, and chriſtian Religion: then with them which will ſéeme to be called, not only mainteyners and defenders, but alſo reſtorers and delyuerers thereof, therfore I will be cōtent at this time with the only example of Paule, in ſteade of many argumentes, to prooue the matter. For it is moſt plainly perceyuedAct. 13. 14 15. 17. 18 by the Actes of the Apoſtles, that this moſt skilfull diſputer, did otherwiſe handle the cauſe of Chriſt with the Iewes, then the Gentiles. I therefore following the ſteps of this excellent Doctor, as well as I can, will reaſon againſt theſe reformers of chriſtian doctrine, and vpholders (forſooth) of true Religion, out of theſe onelye principles, & poyntes of this doctrine,

which are common to both partes, and granted, and receiued of all men. Firſt I doubt not, but the Authours, and Patrones of this new ſellowſhip, hold for a true and vndoubted ground, that which in the ſecond chapiter hath bene rehearſed out of the Euangeliſts Mathew, and Luke, touching the name of Ieſus, and the reaſon thereof giuen by the Angell. It remaineth therefore, that I ſhewe the thing both conteined in the name, and vttered in the reaſon layde downe, not only to agrée with the name, but alſo, to belong onely to this perſon, no leſſe then the name it ſelfe. Peter being fill of the holie Ghoſt, as Luke the fourth of the ActsActs. 4. verſe 10. 12. writeth, was a moſt faithfull witnes, and beſt expounder of thoſe wordes: when being demaunded of the counſell of the high Biſhops of the Iewes, a reaſon of the myracle wrought, and the benefite beſtowed vpon the lame man: did no leſſe plainly declare, then conſtantly confeſſe, that it was all done by the name of Ieſu: whom they had crucified, but God had raiſed from the dead: adding with all▪ that ſaluation

is ſo offered and geuen through this man: that he denyeth the ſame, may be giuen by any man vnder heauen. What could be ſayd more pithely and expreſly. The vniuerſall negatiue cutteth of all occaſion of cauilling, or quarrelling, ioyned twiſe to that ſo waightie an affirmation.
               The ſelfe ſame doth Paule almoſteRom. 5. 17. 18. 19 1. Cor. 15. 21. 22 euerye where in his Epiſtles make good: and doth alſo in ſome places ſet foorth with a very proper contrarietie of a twofolde Adam or man. Hee ſetteth theſe fathers one againſt another, as two contrary fountaines, which beget two contrary ofſprings: to wit, him whom he nameth olde & earthlye, thoſe that are infected and altogetherAdam & Chriſt compared together as two contraries, with their effectes. defiled with ſinne, and therfore are in danger of the wrath of God, and euerlaſting death: The other, which on ye contrarie ſide he calleth new, and heauenly, thoſe that be garniſhed with righteouſneſſe, and foreappoynted to euerlaſtinge and happy life. For as children doe ech of them retaine the nature and propertie of their parents, ſo whatſoeuer belōgeth to the fathers,

commeth at length alſo to the children, for as deſtruction, and euerlaſting death is the iuſt rewarde of ſin: ſo ſaluation, and a bleſſed life, is by the goodnes of God, annesed vnto righteouſnes.Rom. 6. 23 Wherefore, euen as whoſoeuer is borne of that firſt man, for as much as he bringeth with him originall ſinne, cannot auoyde the puniſhment of euerlaſting damnation: wher by it commeth to paſſe, that as one well ſaith, euery man is firſt condemned before he be borne: ſo, for as much as none, but thoſe that beinge elected, adopted, and borne a new of the heauenly father: are iuſtified, or made righteous in the latter man, to witte, Chriſt. It is meete alſo that thoſe only be made partakers of euerlaſtingeIohn. 5. 3 ſaluation, which thing Chriſt himſelfe moſt clearely witneſſeth. As, ſaith he, the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo likewiſe hath he geuen to the Sonne, to haue life in him ſelfe: and for that ende, as in another place hee addeth, that he that beléeueth in him, ſhoulde not peariſh, but haue euerlaſting life. Wherunto agree thoſe things, which

Mathew and Luke doe write, that he ſaide of his comming into this world. The ſonne of man (ſaith he) came toMat. 18. 11 Luke. 19. 10 ſéek, and to ſaue that which was loſt. Therefore without▪ him there is nothingWithout Chriſt there is no life, nor ſaluation. els but death and deſtruction, and in him alone is life and ſaluation, and into him muſt all thoſe be ingraffed, which will receaue life of him, and they muſt put on him, as many as deſire to haue their filthines couered and wiped away: which thing is moſte plainly ſhewed of Iohn alſo the firſt Epiſtle, and fiſt chapter. This is the teſtimonie of God, that he hath geuen1. Ioh. 5. 11. 12. vs life euerlaſting, and this life is in his ſonne. He that hath the ſonne hath life, he that hath not the ſonne, hath not life. Chriſt alſo himſelfe hath ſo depaintedIohn. 15. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. and expreſſed it, in that proper allegorie of the vine and the braunch, that euerye man may eaſelye perceyue it.
               And hetherunto doth plainlye belong, that the Apoſtles call him in ſome places, the ſauiour of the world. Now this title in Gréeke, as it very well agreeth with the Hebrue name

name, whereof I haue ſpoken before, ſo is it ſo great (if we beléeue Cicero, a fitte witneſſe herein) that it cannot be vttered and expreſſed with one latine worde. For it noteth him that bringeth health, or ſaluation. Neither forceth it that this title is geuen ſomtime to the father, and is alſo yeelded vnto men, as to the Iudges of the old people,Rom. 11. 14. 1. Tim. 4. 16 and the miniſters of Gods word. Rom. 11. and 1. Tim. 4. For that which draweth nothing eyther from the office or honour of Chriſt, but rather ſtreyneth that which hath beene ſayde hereof. For it is manyfeſt, that the Father, as the chiefeſt fountayne of ſaluation, from whom all ſaluation floweth vnto the Sonne, and is as it were committed vnto him, of veryeHow men are called ſauiours in the Sctiptu
                        •
                     es. good right is called a Sauiour. But as touching men, this honour is for no other cauſe geuen vnto them, then for that they are choſen and appoynted by our Sauiour Chriſt, that he might diſtribute and poure abroade vpon others, by them as his in ſtrumentes, that power of ſauing which he hath of his own, and reſting in himſelf, which

thing the author of the Epiſtle to the Heb. 2 Chap. ſéemeth vnto me veryeHeb. 2. 10 fitly to haue noted and layd downe in naming him the Prince of our ſaluation. Now that which this wryter vſing a manner of ſpéech which the Hebrues are acquainted with, doth ſignifie as it were with one word. We reade that Peter Act. 5 ver. 31. did partAct. 5. 31 in two, when he had mainteyned this cauſe before the high Prieſtes of the Iewes. Him hath God lifte vp with his right hand, to be a Prince and Sauiour, and ſo foorth.
               By theſe moſt ſure groundes (for to alleadge any more it is néedeleſſe) I thinke that doth ſufficiently appear, which I purpoſed to declare: that without the felowſhip of Chriſt, there remayneth no hope of ſaluation vnto any man. Wherby it is euidently proued, that they are vtterly deceiued, and erre very farre, which ſéeke elſwhere, or otherwiſe, ſaluation. Wherefore I neyther muſt, neyther will reprooue this new order of Friers, if they ſpeak in earneſt, and beléeue that they ſee

                  e ſaluation in Ieſu, and bee willinge to

draw it thence, as from a continuall welſpring: but I accounte it a very vnreaſonable thing, for a man to goe about to drawe all that to himſelfe alone, and to challenge it as his owne, which is common with him to al mē, of what ſtate and condition ſoeuer they be: and therewithall, that they are fowly deceyued, if they thinke it cannot be had without that kinde of life, which they haue newly deuyſed vnto them ſelues.
               Laſtly, I take them to be very far deceyued in this, that they take anotherNo other way to obtayne ſaluation, then that which Chriſt hath deliuered. way to obteyne ſaluation of Ieſus, then he himſelfe hath layd downe and declared.
            
            
               
                  CAP. VII. That to the intent true felowſhip be had with Ieſus, the way that he hath declared is to be followed.
               IT is the part of a truſtye and wiſe Phiſition, not only to ſhew the ſick perſon a fitte and wholeſome medicine, but alſo diligently to delyuer the

maner, and how to receaue the ſame: eſpecially if he perceiue he hath to doe with one that is vnskilfull, and ignorant of Phiſicke. For as it is an eaſie matter herein to miſſe, ſo it is well knowen, to be very dangerous, and dayly experience prooueth the ſame. Therfore the holy Ghoſt to the intent he might performe the parte of a true teacher, and moſt faithfull Phiſition vnto the elect, and ſufficiently prouide for their ſaluation: vnderſtandinge well how great, not only the vanitie▪ but alſo the blindnes of mannes mind is, eſpecially in ſeking, and prouiding for their own ſaluation, thought it not ſufficient to ſet foorth and poynte out, a true, ſure, and neceſſarye medicine: but alſo thought good to declare plainly and largely how the ſame is to be vſed. Wherfore it behoueth al thoſe that are in déede deſirous of their own ſaluation, to reſolue with themſelues that not only the remedy againſt ſin,Chriſt the only way to God, all other are bywayes. which the heauenly Father doth offer in Chriſt, is to be unbraced of them: 
                     ••
                  t that therewithall they muſt in euery poynt folow the way to receyue

the ſame which he hath layde downe. For they are very much deceiued, and altogether erre, which imagine other wayes and meanes, or being deuyſed of others, ſéeme they neuer ſo plauſible and playne, accepte of the ſame. Certainlye they tyre themſelues in vayne, which runne out of the way, and as he ſayd, it is better to haſte in the way, then to runne space out ofAuguſtine. the way: for it is ſo farre of, that they ſhould euer come vnto the true ende, that in ſteade of ſaluation, they procure to themſelues grieuous deſtruction.

For ſo the ſame ſpirit teacheth, that no mar comineth, or is receiued into the fellowſhip, or communion of the ſonne, but by the motion, and leading of the Father.Mat. 11. 27 God is faithfull (ſaieth Paule to the

Corinthians) by whom you are calledIo. 1. verſe. 4. into the fellowſhip of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde. Herehence it appeareth,Io. 14. verſ. 6. that there is no comming to this fellowſhip for any man, but by the Fathers calling. And it is not1. Cor. 1. verſe 9. méete that any ſhould be called, but hée that heareth his voice, and foloweth it: that is to ſay, that heareth him ſpeaking, and obeyeth his counſell, and goeth after him, being guided, as it were, by his hand. Which thing Iohn1. Io. 1. verſ. 1. 2. 3. doeth plainly ſhewe, in the beginning of his Epiſtle, teaching that he declareth to the Church, that which he had ſéene, and heard, that they might haue fellowſhip not onely amonge themſelues, but alſo with the Father and with his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt. TheGod salleth vs by the voice of the Goſpell, vnto Chriſt, and by no other way. voyce therefore of the Goſpell is the way, whereby we haue enterance vnto this holie and healthfull fellowſhip. By it the Father calleth thoſe, whom he hath giuen vnto his Sonne, before the foundation of the world was laid: and bringeth, and aſſembleth them vnto their ſhepheard. And that voyce of the Father ſoundinge▪ clearely from

heauen, conteineth the effect of the heauenly voice: This is my welbeloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed, heare him. By theſe fewe wordes, butMat. 17. 5. verie ſignificant, hee noteth both the end, and ſheweth the way. For the end or ſcope, vnto the which wée muſt leauell, as it were, with both eyes, ought to be that deare Sonne vnto his Father, in whom onely he is ſo appeaſed: that he is offended, with all thoſe, whom he doth not reconcile vnto him. The way whereby we muſt goe, is euen his voice, and word whereunto we muſt altogether giue eare. Therefore Chriſt the guide, the waie and end, of our ſaluation. this Sonne alone, and no other, is both the way, the end and the Guyde.

Firſt he confeſſed that that Etymologe was laught at by ſome, then by and by he ſecretelye reprooueth it, bringing the true interpretation out of Hierom. But on the other ſide, fearing leaſt he ſhould offend his gods, as ſome are wonte to ſay, that is, purchaſe no thankes of them, whoſe good will and fauor he endeuoureth by all meanes to procure, immediately he doth after a ſorte, excuſe Anacletus, and almoſt diſcharge hym, bringing foorth an example of like errour in Optatus the Affricane a man otherwiſe both godly and learned.

Secondly, they2 deſcribe him, as a moſte ſingular example, and paterne of a godly, and holie life, ordered, and framed vnto the moſt ſtraight, or exact rule of the lawe of God: which as by his wordes hée taught, and preſcribed: ſo did he by his

For hee hath not, as Paule ſaith, called his vnto vncleanes, and looſeneſſe of life, but vnto holines. Neither was he made only vnto the faithfull (as he writeth to the Corinthians,) their wiſedome,1. Cor. 1. 30. and righteouſnes, but alſo their ſanctification, and redemption.

                  CAP. XI. That there appeareth not in this newe fellowſhip of Ieſu, any endeuour of holie life.
               I Doubt not but the title, or drifte of this chapter, will ſeeme vnto many at the firſt ſight, not only ſtrange, but alſo vnreaſonable, and no leſſe, then if I ſhoulde goe about to proue, heauie things to go vpward, and light things

downward. For where as I ſay, thatThe Ieſuites no ſuch men as they beare the world in hand. I doe not finde in this vpſtart kinde of monkes, integritie of life, and endeuour of holines: I ſhall ſéeme vnto a great many, to doe no otherwiſe, then if I ſhould ſay that I finde no light in the Sun or whitenes in Snowe. So verely is the outwarde viſor, or ſhewe wont to daſell their eyes, which gaſte thereupon, and doe not withdrawing the ſame, looke into the matter more narowly. Of theſe therefore I requeſt, that they would ſuſpende their iudgement a while: and remoue all preiudices out of their mindes, and to iudge of the matter, hearing attentiuely the reaſons, which I ſhall bring. Firſt ofThe Ieſuites in their dealing againſt the profeſſours of the Goſpel in the point of Iuſtification, malicious and ſlaunderous. all, I ſay that I do worthily find wanting in theſe brethren, plaine dealing, and good meaning, namely, in thoſe thinges that they write againſt vs: as which in the moſt waightie controuerſie of iuſtification, ceaſe not wrongfully to burthen vs, or rather the truth it ſelfe, to the intent to make it not only ſuſpected, but alſo hated of all men: with that hainous, and rancke ſlaunder, of naked, or bare fayth, and voide

of good workes. And yet theſe men cannot but know what our mind and iudgement is, which haue by flattery

They doe eaſilie perceiue that we doe allow that faith, and doe attribute vnto it onlyWhat iuſtifiing faith the profeſſours of the goſpel teach. that effecte of iuſtifying, which the Apoſtle doth define to be effectuall by loue, and fruitfull by good works, and ſo, that we doe not ſeparate the goodGal. 5. 6.

When one reaſoneth of the ſun, fire, and a man, doth not he reaſon of the ſunne that ſhineth, fire that heateth, and a man that liueth, albeit in flatte wordes it be not added: neuertheles, euery man doth diſtinguiſh them one from another by their effectes. TherforeLyes and ſlaunders the notes of the enemies of truth and godlynes. let theſe maſters ceaſe to ſlaunder vs, if they will perſwade vs, that they are louers of the truth, and deſirous of holynes, for to cauill, much more to lie and ſlaunder is the part of the enemies of godlyneſſe and trueth. But letting this paſſe, let vs come to the examination of the reſt of their life.

I will not here charge them all by rehearſing thoſe thinges, which I haue oft times heard and vnderſtoode to be almoſt in euery mans mouth, before their eyes, and in their handes: that certaine gréeuous offences haue bene lately committed of ſome, which are of this order of companions. They would perhaps make anſwere, that the wickednes of ſome ought not to be preiudiciall to the whole felowwippe, euen as no wiſe man doth condemne the Apoſtleſhip, for the falſhode & treaſon of Iudas.
               Moreouer, I am not ſo curious, and deſirous to prie into other mennes liues, that I ſhould deſire to touche thoſe thinges that are done within priuate walles. I leaue ſuch things, firſt,1. Cor. 4. vnto God, who will once make manifeſt things that are hid in darcknes, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, nexte, vnto time, the mother of truth, as they vſe to ſay: laſtly, vnto them that are in thoſe cloyſters or dennes, and abide willingly amongeſt them: which if they would, happely alſo might bring to light thoſe thinges, that as they are

ſoule to commit, ſo ſhould be ſhamefull to ſpeake and to heare: I will onlye make mention of thoſe thinges, which the very Sun doth behold, and are in euery mannes eyes.
               Firſt, that the hatred of the worlde is ioyned with the true loue of godlynes,
                     Iac 4. ver. 3. The loue of the world, & y• loue of god lines can not agree. it is as certaine, as that the Sun doth ſhine at high noone. For God and the world are of ſuch contrary deſires one to ye other, that Iames doubteth not to ſay, that the friendſhippe of the world is enimity with God, and that whoſoeuer deſireth the friendſhip of the world, is made an enemie vnto God. Whoſoeuer therfore is not an aduerſary vnto the world, and hath not bidden battel vnto it, and doth not declare the ſame, rather in deede, then in word, is not to be counted ye friend, much les ye felow of God. For Chriſt alſo hath ſufficiently ſhewed, that no man can be addicted to them both, and
                     Math. 6. 2. Timoth. 4. ver. 10. loue them both. Paule allegeth no other reaſon, why Demas forſooke him, but that hee had imbraced this preſent world.
               Furthermore, Iohn in his firſt Epiſtle,

and ſecond chapter, hath liuelye paynted out the nature of the world, and what his luſtes are, wherein alſo he confirmeth the former ſentence of Iames. Whatſoeuer (ſaith he) is in the world▪ the luſte of the fleſh, the luſte of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the father.

If there be any that dare denye, that they are chiefly to be ſéene in the courtes of the Biſhops of Rome, of Cardinals, and of Biſhoppes: I will not doubt to affirme, that hee is touched with no féeling of conſcience, and with no ſhame. For who, vnleſſe he be marueylouſly ſhameles, wil deny, that their palaces, or houſes more ſtately then kinges, are ſchooles of all kinde of pleaſures? Who knoweth not, that they, and their reteyners, doe liue in exceſſiue ryot, and do fare moſt delycately and dayntely? Truely thatPontificalis cana. olde prouerbe, a Prelates feaſt, did neuer ſo well agree vnto any, as vnto theſe men. I ſpeake nothing of the monſtrous outrages, which are done

in ſecreate: thoſe that are openly done, do ſuffice and giue euident teſtimony thereof. If it hath bene heretofore truly, and worthily ſaide, let him depart from the courte, that mindeth to bée godly, howe much more truely, and rightly, I pray you, may it be ſaide of theſe men: whoſoeuer deſireth to haue fellowſhip with Chriſt, and friendſhip with God: Let him beware, flée, and abhorre theſe companies, and fellowſhips? For he that goeth about to ioyne the one of theſe with the other: he thinketh, and doeth as wiſely, as if he ſhould endeuour to make fire, and water agrée together. If theſe neweThe Ieſuites in hauntinge the popes & prelats courtes & kitchinges, ſhewe what hatred they beare to the worlde. fellowes are ſo deſirous of the Apoſtolicall temperance, continence, and abſtinence, as they profeſſe them ſelues in their apparell, ieſture, wordes, and writinges: howe commeth it to paſſe, that they couet ſo much, to neſtle thē

But theſe vpſtart fellowes, of whom it is reported▪ that they meane to raiſe vp the godlye antiquitie, beinge as it wereThe Ieſuites for ſake not the worlde but imbrace it and run into the middeſt of it. buried, take a cleane contrary way from it.

Now who would not beleue, much more ſuſpecte, that thoſe which follow the ſauour of the kitchen, be rather geuen vnto voluptuouſnes, then to temperance: and albeit they fayne themſelues to be abſtinent, yet that they do liue ryoteouſly? For it is not ſaid for nought, if thou dwell by a lame man, thou ſhalt learne to be lame. But theſeObiection. men wil ſay, that their purpoſe, and end is, to cure the diſeaſes of ye church, and that they doe follow cunning and wiſe Phiſitions, which doe verie well thinke, that it ought to be the chiefeſt endeuour, to take away the cauſes of the diſeaſes: & for as much as they perceiue

the Biſhops of Rome, and Prelates to be the fountaines of all thoſe euils wherewith the church is greatly preſſed, and well neare oppreſſed, (as all men likewiſe doe confeſſe,) that therefore they haue moſt iuſt cauſe to beginne amongeſt them their cure.Anſwere. Theſe thinges are well ſaide, but their déeds muſt anſwere their ſayings. VerelyHow the Ieſuits play the Phiſitions in curing the diſeaſes of the ſicke popiſhe church. they are but vaine bragges, whether they holde their peace, or ſay any thing to the contrarie. For it is no wiſe mans part, as one well ſaieth, to beléeue more thoſe thinges which thou heareſt, then which thou ſeeſt. Neyther are there more ſure teſtimonies of our intentes, and willes, then the effectes thereof. Therefore we do then eſpecially beléeue, and confeſſe that the cauſes of diſeaſes are cured, when wée ſée the diſeaſes to be aſſuaged, and diminiſhed. But now, what ſignes, and tokens of this aſſuaging of the diſeaſes doe there appeare vnto vs, or what can theſe newe Phiſitions ſhewe vs? whom haue they of ſo many naughtie and leaude perſons, brought vnto a better trade, or a ſounder minde? Errours

and naughtines amongſt them are not only not diminiſhed, but more, and more increaſed. In ſome of theſe gouernours of their church, ſuperſtition together with ignorance of heuenly doctrine groweth daily more ſtronger: in other ſome, the contempt of true religion waxeth greater, in moſt part either Atheiſme, or Epicuriſme doe openly raigne. Their maners are verie corrupte, all diſcipline, yea, that which the Popes themſelues haue inuented, and deuiſed, is quite decayed. And what ſhoulde I bring any witneſſes hereof, ſéeing the thing it ſelfe ſoundeth it out? Who knoweth not

Chapter, was neuer more iuſtly eyther ſpoken, or heard of, then at this daye: to witte, There is no trueth, no mercy, and no knowledge of God in the lande, by ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and whoring they breake out, and blood toucheth blood: for theſe thinges are done without controlement, and theſe wounds are ſéene, both euerie where,

ButObiection. againe me thinkes I heare them ſay, that in déede they doe apply remedies, neuertheles they finde by experience the force of the diſeaſes to be ſo great, that no remedies can preuayle with them, and that they are without all fault, ſéeing they doe their duetie truely.

Againe where is that fréedome, continuance, frankneſſe of ſpéech, and holy boldnes, which the ſame Apoſtle commandeth, in teaching, exhorting, reprouing in ſeaſon, and without ſeaſon: where is the feruencie of Spirite, and zeale of the houſe of God? Briefly, where are the fire, and burning yrons agaynſt dangerous diſeaſes, and ſuch that can not bee cured with lighter remedies? And if they are not able to cut them of by excommunication from their churches, by reaſon of the great power they haue, why do not they cut themſelues

of from them: that is, why doe they not forſake them, as Phiſitions doe thoſe ſicke folkes which are wilful, and paſt all hope? So Paule ſéemeth to haue excommunicated the Iewes, whiles forſaking them, he turned him ſelfe vnto the Gentiles, as the Lorde commanded him. If a man may iudgeAct. 13. ver. 46 by the effectes, (which is a readie rule in this kinde of matter) theſe gadding, or rouing Marchants haue ſome other purpoſes in their mindes, and do followe ſome other reſpectes. It is not the deſire, and hope to cure euils, not the loue of trueth and godlines, not the endeuour of holy life, which draweth them to the porches & precinctes of Prelates: but the ſame deſire that allureth Dogges, and Rauens to ſeeke carcayſes and carraine. For the thingThe true cauſe of the Ieſuites frequenting the palaces of popiſhe prelates. it ſelfe witneſſeth, that the wickednes, ryot, and ſluggiſhnes of the Popes, are not amended, and diminiſhed by the endeuour of theſe teachers: but rather nouriſhed, & eſtabliſhed by their flatterings. So farre of is it, that they doe bridle the olde riot, and madneſſe, that they incite them, being of them

ſelues forward enough, thereunto. For they haue brought to paſſe by theyr counſels, and incouraginges, that in ſtéede of an whoriſh, they haue put on an yron forhead. What ſhould I ſay? we finde by experience that the former tyrannie is ſo increaſed, and confirmed, that it may ſéeme that theſe new counſellours were heard, and accepted of the Popes, euen as the hiſtorie of the olde Teſtament declareth, that Roboam ſometime accepted the counſell1. Reg. 12. of young men. And as Ezechiel inEze. 34. the 34. Chapter doeth ſet out in the perſon of the Iewiſh ſhepheardes, the ſlouthfulnes, ryot, and tyrannye of theſe of our time: So in the 13. Chapter, vnder the diſcription of falſe Prophets, teaching the people the counſelsThe Ieſuits purpoſes bewrayed by their doings. of their owne heartes, hee ſéemeth to haue painted out in their colours theſe newe Foxes. All things truely do verie well agrée together. But what néed many wordes? the endles hatred they beare, and warre they bid, and vndertake againſt all thoſe, whiche can not winke at, and away with the Popes diſorder, and diſſolutenes, and doe labour

to ſhake of his wicked yoke, doth moſt plainly argue, and declare, what minde and purpoſe theſe men are of. And whether they doe allowe, or diſalowe their diſpoſition, maners, and kinde of life, hereby it may certainly be determined. Paule the firſt to the Romanes,

Not onely the doors, but alſo the allowers and incoragers of wickednes, giltie before God. doth end a recitall, or bedroll of moſte gréeuous, & hamous ſinnes, with this concluſion: They doe not only the ſame them ſelues, (ſpeaking of the Gentiles) but alſo like, and allowe of them that doe the ſame. In which wordes he ſheweth manifeſtly, that they that further, & fauour ſinnes, whether it be by allowing, or flattering, or mainteining them which commit the ſame, do ſinne more grieuouſly, and are more wicked, and worthie a greater puniſhment. Salomon alſo the 17. of the Prouerbes witneſſeth,Prou. 17. ver. 15 that he that acquitteth or iuſtifieth the wicked, & cōdemneth the iuſt, are both an abomination vnto the Lord. Now that theſe men doe commit both theſe offences, the hatred they vſe againſt thoſe, that teach, that both ſuch vngodlines, and alſo naughtines is not to

be borne with, doe euidently declare. Who, I pray you, would not thinke, that thoſe ſhepheardes, which kéepe of, and beate away dogges, when they barke againſte Wolues, doe conſpire with the Wolues againſt the flockes: and that they are more dangerous, and therefore more to bee auoyded of the flocke then the Wolues them ſelues. To conclude, there muſt bee eyther ſome ſecreat vertue, ſuch as they ſay is in the loode ſtone, to draw yron to it: eyther ſome very greate likenes of diſpoſitions, maners, and counſailes, which hath ſo ſodenlye, ſo quicklye, ſo ſtraightly lincked theſe Ieſuites vntoThe Ieſuites & popiſh prelate

The moſt wiſe God therfore when he would haue his Churches, to wit, Chriſts, and all the elects felowſhip to be moſt nere, and ſure: he alſo would, that there ſhould be in the ſame both a verie great likenes, and equalitie, ſauing that there ſhould be a certaine diuerſitie, and difference, which we ſe likewiſe to be neceſſary to make, & kepe ſocietie. As in ye bodie ofſimilitude. man there is diuerſitie of members, ſo in a common wealth, and a familie there is a difference of offices, and degrees, which doth ſo appertaine vnto good order, that thereunto it is altogether neceſſarie▪ but in all other things there ought to be verie great equalitie, and likenes.

Now after what maner, and how he is willing, and wont to bring this to paſſe, he hath expreſſed and declared in him ſelfe, to wit, his fleſh and bloud, which he hath taken of vs. The author of the Epiſtle to the Heb. the 2. cha. verſ. 10.Heb. 2. ver. 10. ſheweth, that it became the Prince of the ſaluation of the elect, to be conſecrated or made perfect through afflictions. And Chriſt him ſelfe declared vnto his diſciples béeing heauy for his croſſe, and death, that he muſt ſo ſuffer, and dye, that he might enter into his glory. Wherfore he made the fleſhLuk. 24. ver. 25. that he tooke vpon him, to become like the elect, to wit, his brethren: fit, and méete for the euerlaſting glory, and heauenly dwelling, by the croſſe and afflictions. But if this were the ſtate of him which is the firſt begottē, who

is the head, the captaine, yea the kingThe croſſe the way to be like vnto Chriſt. and author of euerlaſting ſaluation, and life: what ſhall we thinke that their ſtate ought to be, which are called, adopted, and engraffed, to the entent they may be partakers of ſaluation? And Chriſt did playnly ſignifie the ſame, what time he gathered, and choſe his diſciples into his family, cō
                  pany, and ſchole: and they themſelues as beſt witneſſes therof, do in diuers places report and teſtifie, that he ioyned and bound them to himſelfe: making in playne and flat words, as it were, a couenaunt with them, and adding expreſly a condition that they ſhould beare his croſſe. Afterwards

By theſe places, which I haue nowe alleaged, and diuers other, which I do willingly paſſe ouer, it is playnly proued, that none belongeth vnto Chriſt, which is not partaker of his croſſe: for as much as that is the mark, as it were, of the children of God, wherewith the moſt deareſt of all was chiefly marked, and honored. Yea the author ofHeb. 12. ver. 8. the Epiſtle to the Hebrues ſticketh not to call them baſtards, and no true children, which are not partakers of diſcipline, and chaſtiſement. As therefore; to conclude this part, they that are geuen of his father vnto Chriſt, béeing firſt ingraffed to him by fayth, haue fellowſhip with him: and are made partakers of all gifts, and goodnes, which otherwiſe are proper to

him onely: and then by the endeuour of a holy life, doe continue this felowſhip, and kéepe the right of the ſonnes of God: ſo by the bearing of the croſſe, they doe both teſtifie vnto all men, and perſwade their own minds more and more: yea and doe ſeale vp in their conſciences, that they are the members of Chriſt, and doe belong to that fellowſhip, whereof he is the head: and thereby doe conceiue moſt aſſured hope, that they ſhall be heyres of the kingdome of God with Chriſt, whom with great ioye of mind they looke for.
            
            
               
                  CAP. XIII. That in the newe felowſhip of the Ieſuits, there appeareth no ſigne of the croſse of Chriſt.
               I Doubte not but that theſe men, whom I impugne, will ſaye, that they ackowledge, like, and embrace as moſt true, whatſoeuer nowe hath bene ſayd, touching the bearing of the croſſe of Chriſt: but that it is ſo farre

of, that they make agaynſt them, that they make moſt for them. So in moſt points of doctrine we agrée in words, but we diſagrée very much in vnderſtanding, and ſenſe. Wherefore we muſt haue a touche ſtone, which may diſcerne the true ſenſe from the falſe. The doctrine therefore of the croſſe of Chriſt, is to be diſcuſſed in a few more words: and this croſſe is to be ſeuered from all other. And they are to be diſcerned the one from the other chiefly by their cauſes. For that ſaying of Cyprian that notable writer, is noCyprian. leſſe true, then common: The cauſe,The croſſe of Chriſt is to be diſcerned from all other by the cauſe. Auguſtine. and not the puniſhment, maketh a Martyr. Whiche alſo was vſed after of moſte godly writers, namely of Auguſtine agaynſt the Donatiſtes, which did falſly chalenge vnto them ſelues the name, and prayſe of the Martyrs of Chriſt, vnto whome alſo Auguſtine doth very well obiect, that Chriſt did not ſimply pronoūce them bleſſed which ſuffer perſecution, but therwithall did adde, for me, for righteouſnes, and the truthes ſake, and ſo foorth. Moreouer Peter alſo doth moſt

clearely diſſeuer them in his firſt Epiſtle1. Pet. 2. ver. 19. & 4. Ca. ver. 15. the ſeconde Chapter, verſe 19. and the 4. Chapter, verſe 15. not only bringing in the true cauſe, to wit, the profeſſion of the name of Chriſt, but alſo forbidding the contrarie, and remouing it away by an oppoſition: what praiſe is it, if when yee be buffeted for your faultes, ye ſuffer it paciently? whereunto likewiſe that ſeemeth to pertaine, which Paule the firſt to the Corinthians the 13. Chapter1. Cor. 13. writeth of him, who being voyde of charitie, doeth deliuer ouer his bodie to be burned. But here chiefly ſtandeth the doubt, that our aduerſaries doe chalendge to them ſelues, the place, and part of Auguſtine: and aſcribe vnto vs the part of the Donatiſtes, and ſuch like. Neuertheles they that ſee not, howe farre the doctrine, and religion of Auguſtine doeth differ from the doctrine, and religion of theſe vpſtartes: and which can not iudgeWhere the true croſſe of Chriſt is to be found. howe vnlike our cauſe is to the Donatiſts: it is maruell if they knowe howe, and are able to diſcerne a coale from ſnow. Whereſoeuer the name

of Chriſt is, there is ye croſſe of Chriſt, and where Chriſt is rightly knowne, or rather acknowledged, there it is to beléeued that the name of Chriſt is. But it is euident, that theſe men doeThe Ieſuites haue not true Chriſt, but an Idoll of him. not know Chriſt, and that they haue, and doe worſhip a painted, and phantaſticall Idoll, in the ſteade of the liuing, and true Chriſt. Then they only can be afflicted for righteouſnesPuritie of doctrine a ſigne of the trueth. ſake, which follow true righteouſnes, which thing they only doe, which hold the trueth, and followe it as a light going before them. And who they be which haue the trueth on their ſide, the puritie of doctrine declareth: which as it is, the ſoule of the church, as it were, ſo is it a light to diſcerne, and finde out darkneſſe: the Rule which teacheth vs to trye ſtraight thinges from crooked: the touchſtone alſo, which ſeuereth true things from counterfait. Furthermore, what doctrine this newe faction doeth profeſſe, and followe, and contrarily, what we doe, partly it hath bene ſhewed before: and partly a litle after ſhalbe ſhewed, for it is not vnknowne. For they differ

as much as mens inuentions do from Gods decrées, that is, as much as darkneſſe differeth from light. Thus much touching the diſcerning the cauſes of affliction. Nowe let vs entreate of the diuers, and ſundry kindes of the croſſe of Chriſt, leaſt we ſhould wrōgfully exclude any man from the ſame, by the fleſhly vnderſtanding of man. Cyprian a true Doctour, and PaſtorCyprian. of the church, and a moſt faithfull, and conſtant Martyr of Chriſt, hath lefte behinde him to the poſteritie, a learned and godly booke of two ſortes of martyrdome, the reading whereof, I iudge moſt profitable for all men. Out of it I will gather ſome flowers, but chaunging the order which he kepte. For in the firſt place. I thinke beſte, that we conſider of that kinde of Martyrdome, which he calleth ſecrete, and is common to all times. For it belongeth alſo vnto all perſons, whichTwo ſortes of martirdome, inward and outward. do come vnto that age, in which iudge ment is ripe, and the diſcretion, or diſcerning of good, & euill, is gotten. Neyther can there bee any place for that kinde of martyrdome, which we may

call outward, and manifeſt, neyther isThe inwarde martyrdome muſt go before the outward. it for all either perſons, either times, vnles that, firſt goe before. Neroes, Diocletians, Decians, or Maximians doe not alwayes rage, as he ſaith, neuertheles the Deuill neuer ceaſeth to trouble them, that are the profeſſed ſouldiours of Chriſt. They are neuer without an enemy, which do loue Chriſt, godlines, and righteouſnes. For euen the moſt holieſt, doe carrye with them, whether ſoeuer they goe, a familiar enemy. We muſt alwayes fight that battell, which Paule liuely
                        Rom. 6. ca. 7. cap. 8. cap. Gal. 5. painteth out, the 6. 7. and 8. Chapters to the Rom. The warre is continuall, whereof he ſpeaketh the 5. Chapter to the Galathians, in the which the godly oftentimes receiue woundes, & ſometimes alſo doe take the foyle: So that they doe that, which they woulde not. Moreouer whither ſo euer they cōme, that are deſirous to defend and ſet foorth the trueth, they light vponThe inwarde martyrdome & conflicte in the godly continuall. the worlde, which can not hearken therunto without repining, and grudging. Whoſoeuer is not willing to forſake it, and to depart from it, (as

all thoſe ought to be willing, which will haue any felowſhip with Chriſt,) he muſt alwayes vndertake the combat with it, he muſt alwayes looke for, and beare the hatred, reproches, and aſſaultes thereof. By theſe exerciſes2. Tim. 3. verſe. 4. they are eaſily knowne, who are, (to vſe the Apoſtles wordes) louers of God, rather then of pleaſures. Nowe of which part, theſe new confederates are: the tentes, which they follow do manifeſtly bewray. Beſides the enemies which conſiſt of fleſh, and blood, they that haue felowſhip with Chriſt, are alwayes beſieged with the powers of darkeneſſe, the rulers of this worlde, and ſpirituall wickedneſſes, whiche doe alwayes lye in waite for them: with theſe enemies all the children of God doe continually wraſtle, and ſtriue. All that are of this number and band, doe prepare, ſenſe, and defende them ſelues with the weapons, and armour which the Apoſtle noteth out, and deſcribeth the 6. to the Epheſians.
                     Epheſ. 6. The godly neuer want their ſpirituall combats with Satan. Hereby, as by ſure marks, they that fight vnder the banner of Chriſt in this fielde, are knowne. They that

drawe vnto themſelues a croſſe, or deuiſeWhat is the true croſſe of Chriſt, and what not. vnto them ſelues armour of their owne making, haue no cauſe at all to ſay, that they beare the croſſe of Chriſt. For that only is to be ſaide to be his, which he layeth vpon our ſhoulders: and whiche they ſhall neuer wante: which make account to liue godly. For the only ſight of the wicked life of the vngodly, doeth oftentimes bring vnto the godly a hard, and bitter croſſe: as it befell ſometime to Noe, and Lot, as Peter witneſſeth the 2. Epiſtle and2. Pet. 2. 2. Chapter. Briefly the life of a godly Chriſtian, is a continuall combat in this our exile, or baniſhment, as IobIob. truely witneſſeth, who was greatly, and long practized in this warfare. Neyther doth Chriſt grant vnto thoſe that are his ſouldiours, any releaſe, or time of eaſe, and giuing ouer: but ſoDum ſpirant, non modo ſperare, ſed etiam ſuſpirare eos vult. long as they breath, he woulde haue them not only to hope, but alſo to ſigh, and grone. Therefore then at length ſhall they haue fully ended the fight,The godly muſt alwayes in this life beare the croſſe of Chriſt. when they haue likewiſe ended their liues. It is wel ſaid alſo, that the life of godly men is a continual repentance:

whiche if it be true, neuer lacketh a croſſe of Chriſt.
               Now whereas theſe newe felowesThe life of the godly a continual repētance. do not know, what true repentance and turning to God is, (as it is playn by their owne writings) neither vnderſtande by what meanes the mortification,The Ieſuites ignorant of true rapentance and mortification. and burial of the olde man, and quickening of the new is brought to paſſe, they haue no cauſe why they ſhould ſaye they beare the croſſe of Chriſt: and chalenge to them ſelues a place in his felowſhip.
               Beſides this kinde of Martyrdome,The outward martyrdome what. which partemeth to all the godly, and is chiefly wrought inwardly in the theatre of the minde onely: there is an other, which belongeth neither vnto all times, neither all beleeuers, but to them alone which endure tormēts euen vnto the death for the profeſſion of the name of Ieſu Chriſt: and haue as it were ſealed vp with their bloud amongſt vnbeleeuers, the Indenture of the Goſpell, as Cyprian ſpeaketh:Cyprian. whoſe captayne is the finiſher and accompliſherInſtrumentum Euangelicum. of our fayth Chriſt, as the author of the Epiſtle to the HebruesHeb. 12. ver. 2.
                  
the 12. chap. verſ. 2. doth very notably ſet him foorth, to be followed of all the godly. And they onely follow him, whom there vnto he chooſeth, and calleth, that is, whom he vouchſafeth of that honour. For to ſuffer reproches in this behalfe, the Apoſtles by their example haue taught, Acts 5. ver. 41.Act. 5. ver. 41. to be reckoned a matter of great honour, and gayne. The ſame alſo haueThis martyrdome for Chriſt glorious. they taughte in wordes, eſpeciallye Paul, whoſe life apeareth to haue bin a continuall Martyrdome.

It is not, in ſooth, the part of a godly, & wiſe man, to drawe

vnto him raſhly the hatred of the world, or without iuſte occaſion to enter into daunger vnder the pretence of trueth, or religion: but to reiect & refuſe it, béeing offered of God, it is the parte of a faynt harted and faythles man. Wherefore although it be not neceſſary that al men ſhould witneſſe their profeſſion of the Goſpell, by outward ſuffering and torments, muche leſſe ſeale it vp with the ſheadding of their bloud: neuertheleſſeThe godly ought euer to be willing to ſuffer this martyrdome, when iuſt occaſion is offered. all thoſe that will be accomted of the heauenly father, and Ieſu Chriſt, for ſonnes, and brethren, and not be throwen into vtter darknes, and euerlaſting fyre with faith breakers, and hypocrites, ought at leaſt to ſeale the ſame, with the preparation of their minds thereunto, as ſome ſpeake: that is, ought ſo to haue their mindes bent, or ſetled, that they be ready not onely to enter into daungers, but alſo ſuffer death, if the glory of Chriſt, the ſaluation of the Church, and cauſe of the trueth doth require the ſame. Whether theſe newe companions of Ieſu, cary ſuch mindes or

no, it is not harde to iudge, by theſeThe Ieſuites haue not this willingnes to ſuffer this martyrdome for Chriſt. thinges that they haue hithervnto done, and yet doe. For they that are always preſent with the ſworne enimies of Chriſt, and doe take ſecrete counſell with them, doe encourage tyrants, are to tormentors as it were bellowes to kindle flaming fyres, againſt the ſonnes of God, the brethrē, and members of Ieſu Chriſt: finally which apply all their intentes, and purpoſes to that ende, that they maye crucifie the true profeſſors of Chriſt, howe can they haue minds prepared, and ready to beare the croſſe?
            
            
               
                  CAP. XIIII. That the Ieſuites haue a great reſemblaunce, and likenes with theſe heretikes which are called Nazarites, the enimies of the croſſe of Chriſt.
               IT is euidently knowen by the hiſtorie of the Actes of the Apoſtles, that aſſoone as the light of the Goſpel began to ſpread abrode his beames, Satan rayſed vp agaynſt it diuers

kindes of enimies: which althoughe they were very vnlike one the other amongſt them ſelues, yet they did all conſpire together in this, that they hated Chriſtian religion, and laboured by all their deuiſes, and endeuours, eyther wholly to let, eyther to hinder the courſe of the G

                  ll. Amongſt the Iewes there were eſpecially the High Prieſts, the Phariſees and the whole ſcomme of y• Prieſthode. There were alſo amongſt the people very many, which were oftentimes ſtirred vp by thoſe bellowes. Amongſt the Gentiles there were diuers kindes and ſtates, as thoſe times did require, of the which perhaps ſomewhat ſhal be ſpoken at an other time. Now I will ſpeake of a certayne kind, which that perpetuall enimie of Chriſt, and hys Church had ſet foorth by a ſpeciall deuiſe, and inſtructed with a peculiar ſubtiltie. It was a kinde of men both very craftie and very peſtilent: theThe Nazareans deſcribed, and their practiſes, agaynſt Paule. which as it did the more ſecretly vndermine the Church, ſo did it hurt it more daungerouſly. Firſt it crept in ſubtilly to the duetie of teaching: for

it inſinuated it ſelfe, as it appeareth, vnder the colour of ſpreading abroad the Goſpell. And for as muche as the name of Paule was very famous, for his marueilous dexteritie in preaching the Goſpell, and his happy ſucceſſe in publiſhing thereof, (whiche thing alſo gote him the hatred of very many) theſe hypocrites thought beſt chiefly to ſet them ſelues agaynſt him: thinking that to be very profitable for their purpoſes, and deuiſes. For they thought that to be the readyeſt waye for them to come to glory, and gayne, which they onely regarded, and whervnto they turned all their doctrine. Therfore taking vpon them the perſonThe Nazareans tooke vppon them to be Apoſtles. of Apoſtles, they ſought by all kinde of lyes & trecheries, to remoue Paule from his place, and to thruſt him from his ſeate: that is, to take away all authoritie from him, and they troubled him wonderfully with diuers ſlaunders. Nowe as they had taken vpō them to vexe, and to backbite him aboue others: ſo he dealing with a good conſcience in this his vocation, did ſet him ſelfe ſtoutly, and

conſtantly agaynſt theſe miniſtersPaules conſtancie and boldnes in the defence of the Goſpel agaynſt them. not of Chriſt, but of Satan: well perceiuing what this enimie by them did goe about to bring to paſſe. As therefore he well vnderſtoode the craftineſſe of theſe deceiuers, ſo he moſte clearely diſcouered them vnto all congregations, paynting them out, as it is ſayd, in their owne colers, and that not in worde onely, but alſo by writing, that ye memory therof might remayne with the poſteritie, to their great profite. For the Church hath inPaule in theſe paynteth out al falſe teachers to the poſteritie for euer. that deſcription of the Apoſtle a liuely picture of all falſe teachers, and heretikes: whiche if all that profeſſe the name of Chriſt, did marke, and note, it would be farre better with a great number, and the Church of Chriſte ſhould féele leſſe hurt. Verely in that picture of the Apoſtle, theſe new kind of deceiuers of whō we now ſpeake, ſéemeth vnto me moſt of all to be expreſſed. For there is ſuche a likenes betwéene them bothe, that the one may worthily ſéeme to be, and to be called▪ not onely the image, and liuely portrature, but the fathers alſo of the

Herein they doe agree well firſt, that as that enemie of Chriſt, ſo ſoone as the Goſpell began to be publiſhed amongſt the Gentiles, brought them in ſubtelly vnder the pretence of the lawe, and religion of Moſes: So immediatly when the light of the goſpel began to ſhine again, & to be reſtored, craftily he ſtirred vp, & not onely conueighed into the Church, but alſo by, and by aduaunced theſe, béeing couered with the title of Ieſus, and decked with the ſhewe of godlynes, and furniſhed with many practiſes to deceiue.

And to the entent that euery man may the ſooner vnderſtād, what great likenes and agréement there is betwéene bothe the ſortes, I haue thought good to laye before all mens eyes a compariſon of them.

together, if we will iudge aright. Neither is any mans doctrine ſo muche to be wayghed, and eſtéemed by his tong and talke, as by his life, & déeds. For of ſuch deceiuers writeth Paule, Tit. 1.

It is alſo well written of Cyprian,Cyprian. that the teſtimonie of the lifeMens doctrine to be iudged by their life, not by their tong. is more effectuall, then of the tong: and that workes hath their tong, and their eloquence, yea when the tong kéepeth ſilence. For as there can not be a holy life, which is not ordered according to the rule of holy doctrine: ſo it commonly commeth to paſſe, that he which leadeth a life not agreable vnto this rule: is willing, and endeuoreth to breake, and corrupt (if he were able) the very rule of good liuing: as euery naughtie man deſireth that good lawes might be baniſhed, and deſtroyed, although he prayſe them ſometime in his talke. Briefly, the record of the life doth notThe tong doth ſooner deceiue, then the life. ſo muche deceiue, as of the tong: the whiche the ſentence of Chriſt dothe confirme, willing vs to trye out falſeMat. 7. ver. 15.

Tim. 1. & 6. 2. Tim. 2. places, noting this eſpecially in falſe teachers, renegates, & deceiuers: that they erred from the marke, and turned aſide els where.

But it is a common thing with falſeteachers, to turne the heauenly doctrine to the marke, which they haue ſet before them ſelues: to the intent they may force it to ſerue their owne purpoſes, commodities, yea and their

owne luſtes. The ſame doth Paule writing to the Corinthians the firſte Epiſtle, and 14, chapter, ſharpely reprehendé,1. Cor. 14. ſpeaking of them which abuſed the gifts of tongs: the whiche place of the Apoſtle, ChryſoſtomeChryſoſt. ho. 35. that godly Biſhop, and good interpreter of Paule expounding, ſayth: Mark howe here agayne he ſquareth the ſtone to the ſquier, ſeeking euerye where the edification of the Church. So that the Apoſtle doth teache both in this place, and els where, that all things are to be referred to the edification of the Church. Which marke, who ſo will regard, ſhall not eaſilye erre, but he that hath any other reſpect, muſt néedes miſſe often times.
               Nowe let vs conſider, vnto whiche ſort theſe newe Apoſtles do belong, and vnto whom they are more like, eyther Paule, or thoſe diſguiſed Apoſtles. What the doctrine of Paule was, his Epiſtles doe witneſſe: but what his aduerſaries was, it maye certaynely bee knowen, partely by Luke, Acts 15. chapter: partely by Paule him ſelfe, namely out of the

Epiſtle to the Galathians: and partly by Hierom, eſpecially out of his commentaries vpon Ezechiel, 16. chap. and certayne other olde writers. The effect is, they went about to couple the keeping of the olde lawe (theſe are Hieromes owne wordes) with the grace of the Goſpell, and to ioyne Moſes vnto Chriſt. But howe ſmallThe Ieſuits not like Paule, but the Nazareans, in their doctrin. a matter is this, I pray you, if it bee compared with the riffe raffe of the Ieſuites doctrine, in the which there is ſcarce a leafe, wherein there is not read ſome, much more gréeuouſer reproche againſt Chriſt, then that was? If for that doctrine the Apoſtle doubted not, and that with indignation, to call them the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt, which inuerted the goſpell, which he hauing receiued of Chriſt, had preached: are not theſe to be takenThe Ieſuits deface God, and his glory, in ſanctifying, and deifying men. for the very ſworne enemies of Chriſte, and his Goſpell, of all thoſe that haue profeſſed Chriſte, that loue him, and are carefull for his glorye? For what Chriſt, I pray you, ſhoulde we haue, if we harlten to theſe newe maſters, and folowe them? For almoſt

all the ornamentes whiche the father hath beſtowed vpon him, are pluckt from him: and turned ouer, not vnto Moſes the rare Prophet of God: but vnto infinite obſcure, and vnknowen, eyther Saintes, as theſe men tearme them, eyther falſe gods, which haue b

For what, I pray you, doth that huge heape of euils, that ſhoppe of wickednes, and nurſe of miſchiefes,The Maſſe iniurious to the grace of Chriſt. the Maſſe leaue vnto it? Againe what ſoeuer theſe men teache of the fyre of Purgatory, prayer to the dead, worſhipping of images, pardons, the Popes ſupremacie, the authoritie of the church, and ſuch other like matters: what els are they but mens dreames, and deuiſes more vayner then old wiues tales? Is it not meere vayne babling the greateſt parte, of

thoſe things, which vnder the title of the traditions of the Apoſtles, are deliuered as the Oracles of God, vnto Chriſtian people, and are thruſt vpon them both to be beléeued, and obſerued? What néede I to ſpeake of many ceremonies? For it is certayne,Iewiſh, & heatheniſh ceremonies broght into the Church of Chriſt, by the Papiſts, and Ieſuites doctrine. that almoſt all the Iewiſhe ceremonies, except circumciſion, which theſe aduerſaries of Paule, or rather of Chriſt, and the truth, did chiefly vrge: are rayſed vp, and brought againe into the church of Chriſt, many thinges alſo therewithall mingled out of the ſuperſtition, and vngodlynes of the Heathen. And when at length men began to beléeue that religion conſiſted in them onely, their heape with continuall additions grewe ſo great, that it was altogether intollerable, & began with the hugenes therof to fall to the ground. Neuertheles as if thoſe things which were inuēted, & brought in by the predeceſſors, were not ſufficient: theſe newe workemen doe labour to adde to the former, ſuche as they haue lately coyned in their owne ſhoppe. Is not this to teache other

doctrines, and to bring in darknes at the noone light, yea, and to call againe bōdage, libertie being once obtained? Moreouer, that vnlearned, brabling, hurtfull, yea pernitious queſtions are ioyned with the Ieſuites doctrine, it is thereby well knowen: that they embrace all the conſuſe heape of the Popiſh diuinity: nor do ſignify in any place, that I know, that they miſlike the thorny or ſubtil trifles of ye ſcholemen.

The maner of their countenance, of their voyce, of their geſture, and the behauiour of their whole body, was ſo ſquared and framed to the time, and all occaſions: that many began to hope, that all thinges that were decayed, and corrupted, ſhould ſhortly be reſtored, and repayred by the faithfulnes, paynes, and diligence of theſe newe teachers. And herein ſtoode not the leaſt parte of Satans ſubteltie, that they did diſſēble finely, that they and the Monkes did not ioyne hands

together, whoſe ſlouthfulnes, and rioteouſnes had nowe already brought them into hatred, and contempt with all men. They ſignified plainly, that they had no dealing, nor conference with the Prieſts, whō they knew to be infamous with all mē, for their notorious ignorance, & filthines of life. But now it is knowen in very déed, that they intend this one thing, to enriche them ſelues with their ſpoyles, and decke them ſelues with their feathers, and place them ſelues in their ſeates, and roomes.

Hereby it ſufficiently appeareth, that it is no newe, but an olde policie commonly vſed of the corrupters

Is not this a common endeuour, and practiſe with theſe men, to make ſuche as they ſmel to be little fauored of them, for their free & franke profeſſion of the trueth, and godlynes, more odious vnto them by inuenting of ſlaunders agaynſt them?

Hierome amongſt other things,Hicrome. writeth of thoſe whom he calleth (as I haue ſayd) Nazareans, thus: a teſtimonie which in his right place agreeth with one ſence, or meaning, they labour to make to ſerue to an other. The which not onely agreeth with the words of Paule, but doeth alſo in a manner expound them, eſpecially that which was ſpoken of before out of the 2. to the Corint. 2 that they vſed to ſet to ſale, and to corrupt the worde of God.
               In this poynt, theſe newe huckſtersThe Ieſuites chop & change and corrupt the worde of God, to get the fauor of men. doe diligently followe them, when eyther they ſpeake of the ſcriptures to pleaſe the Popes: eyther tickle the eares of Princes, whom they haue bewitched with their inchauntments, eyther labor to ſtirre vp, and inflame the rage of the furious vulgare people agaynſt vs, whom they knowe as well as thoſe that inhabite thoſe regions of the earth, whereinAntipodes. they goe directly foote to foote contrary vnto vs. Certaynly they doe then declare how truely they call the Scripture a noſe of waxe. For they turne,

or rather wreſt it, whither it pleaſeth them. The words of the Scripture ſounde with them what they liſte, and therein they ſee, what their affection leadeth them vnto, and what they like, is a matter of religion, and holines. But they are greatly deceiued, if they iudge vs by their owne diſpoſition. We haue learned out of Paul, to handle the holy oracles more religiouſly. Verily we acknowledge the minde of the holy ghoſt to be contayned in the words, wherevnto we are wont to ſubmit our iudgement, will, and affections.
               It remayneth, that we looke vpponThe ende of the Ieſuits doctrine the ſcope and ende of their doctrine. Wherevnto the vile and ſlauiſhe flattery, and cruell backbiting of theſe newe maſters doth tende: their lyfe and doings, as effects therof do plainly declare. For we finde dayly by experience that very manye purpoſes are not knowen but by the euentes. It is reported, that a certayne FryerA Franciſcane Fryers hypocriſie to climbe to the Popedome. of the order of the Franciſcans, which bredde vp hither vnto many cruell wolues, and ſuttle foxes: came vnto

the Popedome by a wonderfull practiſe. At the time of his meales, he cauſeth his table to be couered with a fiſhers nette: which fact of his, diuers did take to be a ſigne of rare holmes. But what came to paſſe? When this notable hypocrite had gotten the pray he hunted after, that is, was mounted to that lofty ſeate: then at the length he ceaſed to couer his boorde with that myſticall nette, and it was vnderſtoode what minde, and purpoſe that Foxe had. So if there be anye man, which eyther knoweth not, eyther doubteth, to what ende the title of the Ieſuites, being no leſſe holy in ſhewe, then ſtraunge, haue bin inuented, and vſurped of theſe confederates: and why they haue taken vppon them this color, or rather viſor of godlines, and learning: let him conſider what hath bin brought to paſſe, within theſe few yeres, by theſe maſking religious men, and where vnto they are come within ſo ſhort a ſpace, from very obſcure, and ſclender beginnings: and he ſhal eaſily perceiue, if he haue but a ſparke of iudgement,

Contrarily theſe men, euen as did thoſe Iewiſh Chriſtians, doe holde that they are to be kept: and doe diſanull thoſe thinges that Chriſt by his Apoſtles hath placed in their roome, that they mighte ſhewe them ſelues two manner of wayes, to be enemies of God, and of Chriſt: in that they not only ordaine that whiche is not lawfull by Gods worde: but ouerthrowe, and repeale, that which is lawfull, or rather, that which is ordayned, and eſtabliſhed. The thing therefore it ſelfe ſheweth,The Ieſuites ſtirred vp by Satan, and why. that they haue bin ſuborned, and ſubſtituted by Satan, not to call backe agayne the auncient, and true religion: but to nouriſhe the confuſion

which he hath brought in this laſte, and as it were, olde age of the church: partly by cōſidering the errors, which he hath already ſpread: partly by encreaſing them: and by corrupting more and more the face of true religion deformed many wayes by their predeceſſors: to eſtabliſh ſuperſtition, and Idolatrie: and that according to the maner of this Iuggler, vnder the color of reformation, & buylding vp. But it is well, that this enemie did ſomewhat lately thinke of the muſtering of this ſupply of ſouldiers. For the lighte of the Goſpell hath nowe ſpread his beames ſo farre, and wide, that it is no eaſie matter for them to extinguiſhe it: the truth hath taken ſuche deepe rootes in the minds of many, that it is an hard matter to pluck it out.

Truely it is a wonderfull, and a pityfull thing, that theſe vagrant, and wandring perſons, thruſting vpon men, vnder the pretence of the traditions of the Apoſtles, moſte abſurde things, and moſt contrary to the true, and auncient forme of godlines: ſhoulde be harkened vnto, and embraced: and in the meane time thoſe things ſhould be let paſſe with cloſed eyes, and ſtopped eares, which Luke in the hiſtorie of the Actes of the Apoſtles, hath as faythfully deliuered, as he wrote the hiſtory of Chriſt: to wit, the Goſpel, concerning the infanc

Neither is there any doubt, but that this ſpirite, the gouernor, and guider of the Church of Chriſt, would haue that maner, and forme committed to writing, to be deliuered, and leaft to the poſteritie: to the intent it mighte haue continually a paterne to looke vnto, and folowe.
