            To the Reader.
            
               IGnorance as Diuines doe teſtifie, is one of the
plagues put vpon man the creature, for tranſgreſſing
of the commaundements of God his
creatour from which we are to come, (as the
patient from his diſeaſe) by degrees. Mans vnderſtanding
is likened by Ariſtotle to the eies of the Howlet
in the day-light. Salomon ſayth: Dedi cor meum vt

            The fame of our anceſtours that diligently laboured to
bring vs, and in many things brought vs from ignorance to
knowledge, ſhall neuer be forgotten ſo long as thoſe things
wherein they laboured, be in eſtimation, and (in mine opinion)
ſo farre forth as we may, we ſhould Imitate the ſteps of
them, for this plague of ignorance is ſo great, that neither
did they neither ſhall we finde ſo much: but that we muſt
leaue ſufficient, for our poſteritie to be found.
            Wherefore ſeeing ſufficiently others to labour and trauell
in other Sciences, I thought good to beſtow my labour in
Muſicke, ſeeing that paines might ſo much preuaile, as by
the fruit of my labour may plainly appeare. I tooke the matter
in hand vpon this occaſion, though it were far diſtant
from my profeſſion, being deſired by a gentleman, to inſtruct
him in ſong, I gaue him ſuch rules as my Maſter gaue mee:
Yet could I giue him no ſong ſo plaine, wherein there chanced
not ſome one thing or other, to which none of thoſe rules
could directly leade him. Marking then how in minde, I
did know what by rule I could not teach, I perceiued how

vnder the ſhade of rule, I attained to many things by rote▪
and how pleaſant, ſpeedie and ſure it is to runne by rule, I
tooke this labour in hand, and brought it to this paſſe. Olde
Muſitions laid downe for Song, manifold and crabbed,
confuſe, tedious rules, as for example: though there be in
all but ſixe names, Vt, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, hauing amongſt
them an eaſie order, yet could not they by rule declare, whether
of theſe ſhould bee attributed to euery Note, vnleſſe
they had firſt framed the long ladder or skale of Gam-vt,
to which ſome added, thinking the ladder too ſhort, ſome
hewed off a peece, thinking it too long. Then would they
haue the learner be as perfect in comming downe backward,
as in going vp forward, leaſt in his practiſe he ſhould
fall, and breake his neck. Then must he learne, Gam-vt, in
rule, Are, in ſpace, b my in rule, C faut in ſpace, &c. Then
muſt he know Gam vt, how many cleues, how many notes.
Are, how many notes, &c. Then muſt he know b, quadrij,
proper chant and bemul, re in Are, whereby vt in Cfaut,
whereby mi, in Alamire, whereby &c. And when all haue
done, after their long circumſtances of time, whereby they
ſhould be often driuen to millibi, for Notes ſtanding in diuerſe
places of Gam-vt, haue names that the place where
they stand comprehend not. Touching all the prolixe circumſtances,
& needleſſe difficulties, that they vſe, it loathes
me greatly that heere I ſhould write them: & much more
would it grieue the Reader to learne them. Alſo many
things are vſed in Song, for which they giue no rules at all,
but committed them to dodge at it, harke to it, and harpe
vpon it. Now (Reader) th'effect of my pretended purpoſe,
and fruit of my finiſhed labor is this, where they gaue prolixe

rules, I haue giuen briefe rules, where they gaue vncertaine
rules, I haue giuen ſure rules, and where they
haue giuen no rules, I haue giuen rules. After all this that
I haue ſaid of their rules, I doe affirme that they deſerued
greater commendations aboue mee, for finding out the long
way, then I aboue others for laying down the ſhort way. For
had not they opened the gappe, touching mee, it might very
well hap that I ſhould in no ſort enter my ſelfe, and much
leſſe in any ſort inuite others: nothing can at the beginning
be perſected, and therefore are they to bee holden excuſed
as the old verſe hath:

                  But ere the Painter can ſure his craft attaine,
                  Much froward facion transformeth hee in vayne,
                  By rayſing ſuperfluitie, and adding that doth want,
                  Rude Pictures are made both perfect and pleaſant.
                  For ſuch things by negligence are left vndone,
                  That by good diligence might be wonne.
               
            
            There be ſufficient, many, and firme prooues had of this
that I ſay, which may by my rules be done, of which I will
heere put downe ſome of them, though I get as little by being
beleeued, as I ſhould looſe by being belyed.
            In a moneth and leſſe I instructed a child about the age
of eight yeeres, to ſing a good number of ſongs, difficult
crabbed Songs, to ſing at the firſt ſight, to be ſo indifferent
for all parts, alterations, Cleues, flats, and ſharpes, that he
could ſing a part of that kinde, of which he neuer learned
any ſong, which child for ſtrangeneſſe was brought before
the Lord Deputie of Ireland, to be heard ſing: for there
were none of his age, though he were longer at it, nor any
of his time, (though he were elder) knowne beefore theſe

rules to ſing exactly.
            There was another, that had before often handled Inſtruments,
but neuer practiſed to ſing (for hee could not
name one Note) who hearing of theſe rules, obtayned in
ſhort time, ſuch profit by them, that he could ſing a difficult
ſong of himſelfe, without any Inſtructor.
            There was another, who by dodging at it, hearkning to
it, & harping vpon it, could neuer be brought to tune ſharps
aright, who ſo ſoone as hee heard theſe rules ſet downe for
the ſame, could tune them ſufficiently well. I haue taught
diuerſe others by theſe rules, in leſſe then a moneth; what
my ſelfe by the olde, obtained not in more then two yeeres.
Diuerſe other proofes I might recite, which heere as needleſſe
I doe omit, becauſe the thing will ſhew it ſelfe. Diuerſe
haue repented in their age that they were not put to ſing in
their youth; but ſeeing that by theſe rules, a good skill may
be had in a moneth: and the wayes learned in foure or fiue
dayes: none commeth too late to learne, and ſpecially if this
ſaying be true: That no man is ſo olde but thinketh he
may liue one yeere longer. As Ariſtotle in ſetting forth
his predicaments, ſaw many things requiſite to be entreated
off: and yet vnfit to be mixed with his treatiſe: he therefore
made ante predicaments, and poſt predicaments: ſo I
for the ſame cauſe (deſirous to aboliſh confuſion) haue added
to my rules, ante rules, and poſt rules. Vale.

And the F: cliefe of F fa vt the lower in the ſcale.
                  Now in this ſort you may finde by the cliefe where euery
note ſtandeth: and leaſt there ſhould ſeeme any
difficultie, I will begin from the firſt ſight of the booke,
that all things that doe belong to their knowledge, may
bee the better vnderſtoode. Firſt when a man ſeeth the
booke before him he may ſee certaine rules which goe
along lineally by 5 and 5 which number of 5 is called a
ſet of prick ſong (for a ſet of plaineſong hath commonly
but 4. rules,) then he may ſee in the firſt of the ſet alwayes
one of the foreſayde cleifes vpon ſome rule, and
whatſoeuer note ſtandeth vpon the ſame rule with the
cliefe, is ſaid to be in that place whereof that cleife which

he ſeeth is the marke, and if any note ſtand in the next
ſpace aboue, it is ſaid to ſtand in the next place aboue
that place, whereof that cleife is the marke. And ſo vpward
and downeward continually counting from the
cloſe as in this example.
                  
                     
                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
                  The firſt note ſtandeth in C ſol fa vt, becauſe it ſtandeth
vpon the ſame rule with the clief which is the mark
of C ſol fa vt, the ſecond in D la ſol re, becauſe D la ſol re
is next aboue C ſol fa vt in the ſcale of Gam vt: the third
in B fa b mi, becauſe it is in the next place beneath C ſol
fa vt: the fourth in E la mi, becauſe E la mi is the next
place ſaue one to C ſol fa vt, & the ſaid fourth note ſtandeth
in the next place ſaue one to the cliefe which is the
mark of the place C ſol fa vt. And ſo of all other notes:
then in the ende of the ſet, hee may ſee a thing thus 
                        〈♫〉
                     
marked, which is called a direct, becauſe it is alwayes
put vpon the rule or ſpace wherein the firſt of the next
ſet ſtandeth, and doth ſo direct a man, euen as in bookes
the word that is loweſt vpon euery ſide of the leafe doth
direct a man to the word next following.
               
               
                  The rule of Vt.
                  The next thing neceſſary to be knowne for the right
naming of notes, is the place where that note ſtandeth
which is named 
                        Ʋt. And as by counting vpward and
downeward from the cliefe it is to bee knowne where
euery note ſtandeth, ſo it is to be knowne by counting
vpward and downeward from that which is called 
                        Ʋt,
what the right name of euery note is: but firſt let vs ſet
downe how the place where the vt ſtandeth is knowen,

which is thus. There be three places, in one of which the
vt muſt alwaies be: that is to ſay, in G. which is Gamvt
and G ſol re vt, when there is no flat in C, which is C fa
vt, C ſol fa vt, and C ſol fa, when there is a flat in b mi,
or b fa b mi. In F which is F fa vt, when there are two
flats, one in b mi or b fa b mi, the other in E la mi, or E la.
                  
                  As for example.
                  
                     
                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
                  Now thevt is in G. Now in C. Now in F.
                  
                  ¶No b flat, the (vt) in G. The b flat in b onely, the
(vt) in C. The b flat in b and E, the (vt) in F.
                  
                     1 G putteth Vt to the ſame place.
                     2 F and B to the next vp, as.
                     3

                           〈♫〉
                        
                     
                     
                        4 C putteth Vt to the fift place vp, and from C down
to the fourth. B, taketh place of the reſt.
                        B, is placed laſt to ſhew that it taketh place of the reſt.
                     
                     5 If there commeth two, b. b. being a fourth, the vpper
taketh place.
                     6 And being a fift, the nether taketh place, as:

                           〈♫〉
                        
                     
                     
                        
7 D. putteth Vt to the fift place downe, but it is ſeldome
vſed.
                     8 If there commeth two b. b. being a ſecond a ſunder,
the vpper taketh place, which chanceth very rare.
                     More ſhall be ſayd of naming in the chapter of tuning.
                  
                  When you haue in this ſort found out the vt, you
muſt vnderſtand that euery note that ſtandeth in the
next place aboue it is named re, euery note that ſtandeth
in the next place to that is named mi, in the next to that
fa, then ſol, then la, then fa, aſcending vp alwaies orderly,
counting the rules, and ſpaces: then next aboue that againe
is vt: for you ſhall finde that place, which is the
eight place from that wherein your other vt ſtood, to
begin with the ſame letter: So that if the rules & ſpaces
were infinite, you might in this manner giue euery
note his right name: and as you did count vpward 
                        Ʋt,
re, mi, fa, ſol, la, fa, and ſo come againe to vt: ſo muſt
you come downeward from vt, the ſame way backward,
by fa, la, ſol, fa, mi, re, vt. And ſo come to fa, againe.
And in this ſort the right name of euery note is knowne.
Two things from theſe rules are excepted, the one is,
that euery re, ſhould be named la, when you aſcend to
it, or deſcend from it: and that euery vt, ſhould bee named
ſol, which two things are vſed euphoniae gratia, and
yet this name of vt, is moſt proper to the baſe or loweſt
part in the firſt place.
               
               
                  Obiection againſt the latter exception.
                  In the latter exception it is ſaid, that vt ſhould be alwaies
changed into ſol, therefore ſeeing it is neuer vſed,

it is in vaine placed in all this former tractation.
                  
                     Solution. It is placed in all this former tractation for
two cauſes, the one is, that it ſhould be diſtinguiſhed by
that name from the other ſol, and the other is, becauſe it
hath bene a name vſed from the beginning, and now
commonly changed into ſol, euphoniae gratia: it may
ſometimes neuertheleſſe be vſed, for (as I ſayd before)
the cunning ſinging man keeping euery note in his right
tune, may name it according to his pleaſure, for theſe▪
names be no neceſſary accidents, for you ſee daylie that
when any ſong is lettred, theſe names be not attributed
to them, though then they be ſung in their owne order,
according to the opinion of many, yea very many. I
know I ſhould adde a third exception, that is to ſay, to
except alſo, that euery note hauing a ſharpe beefore it,
ſhould be named mi, as in this example,
                        〈♫〉
                     
the third note. And becauſe that of that opinion there
bee ſo many, I will for them ſhew a probable reaſon as
by our principles may be ſhewed: then after by reſoluing
them, ſhewe what is moſt profitable, not refuting
the opinion as an errour, beecauſe that looking to the
matter, wee may finde that they may bee named as well
mi, as fa, inſomuch as the names (as I ſayd before) are no
neceſſary accidents, but neuertheleſſe, becauſe heere we
ſeeke the moſt apt name, it were vnfit to paſſe it ouer.
Wherefore the principall argument for them wee may
in this ſort forme.
                  
                     Obiection. We ſhould name all notes ſo neare as wee
can, according as ſuch notes are named in the gamvt, for
it is certain, that theſe are the names which are moſt fit,

for ſo in the beginning by the firſt inuentors of Muſick
they haue bene ſet downe: but no note that is ſharp in
the gamvt is named fa, therefore no note made ſharp by
a collaterall reaſon, ſhould bee named fa. Secondly,
throughout all the gam vt, from ſol to fa. Next vnder it
is a whole note, but from that ſol to that fa, if we ſhould
call it fa, is but halfe a note, therefore if we call it fa, wee
breake altogether the rule of gamvt, which wee ſhould
obſerue: thirdly euery place in the gam vt that is ſharp,
is named either mi or la. Therefore this note (beecauſe
not ſo aptly la) muſt be named mi. Before we fully ſatiſfie
theſe arguments, one thing muſt neceſſarily be knowen:
that is to ſay, that in naming the notes in gam vt the
firſt inuentors did obſerue two things, whereof the one
was, to name the notes according to the vt: the other,
to name euery note which is ſharpe (as the argument
proueth) mi, or la: and it falleth out ſometimes, when
notes flat by collaterall reaſons are made ſharp, that one
of theſe two muſt neceſſarily be violated, that is to ſay,
that eyther the note muſt not bee named according to
the vt, or a note ſharp muſt bee named fa, ſo that the
controuerſie lyeth in knowing, whether of theſe two
ſhould ſooneſt be obſerued: ſo according to this we anſwere
to their arguments. To the firſt, where they impute
a fault in vs for naming a note ſharp, fa, ſeeing that no
ſharp note in all the gam vt is named fa, we may impute
an other abſurditie to them, ſeeing they would haue the
next note vnder ſol, mi, which is not found in all gam vt,
which is the more abſurditie (as we will proue in the ſolution
to the third argument) To the ſecond, the ſolution

is eaſie, that euen as euery ſol to fa, next vnder it is
a whole note: ſo from euery ſol to mi, next vnder it is
more: ſo that according to the gam vt, in that reſpect
none of them is true. To the third wee anſwere, that it
may bee as well la, as mi, becauſe that if ther were any
reaſon why it ſhould not be as well la, it might well be,
to eſchew this abſurditie, that then in two places together
there ſhould bee one name, becauſe the next vnder
it is alſo la, but by naming it mi, the ſame abſurditie
commeth in another place, therfore the one is as abſurd
as the other, as in this example, where two 
                        〈♫〉
                     
places together muſt according to them bee named mi,
but to name two places together with one name, there
is none but will think more diſſonant, then to name
them with diuers, whatſoeuer: for if a man did name
mi, ſix times together in one place, beeing quauers, the
one comming faſt vpon the other, would make them
ſeeme as though it were mim, mim, mim, as for example,

                        〈♫〉
                      wherby it plainely appeareth
that this is moſt abſurd. But becauſe that it were as good
that our ſelues ſhould bring that, which others may do,
by ſharp grating vpon our ſolutions, in this ſort we may
frame a reply. Let vs ſuppoſe, that in the middle of a
ſong which had fa in C ſol fa vt, there came two notes,
one in C ſol fa vt, & another in B fa b mi, hauing a flat
before it, then if the latter note in B fa b mi, hauing the
flat before it, be not called fa, it is againſt the order of
the vt, which by the ſolutions ſhould moſt be kept, if it
be named fa, then commeth the abſurditie proued in the

laſt example: that is, that two places together ſhould
haue one name, and likewiſe if ſixe quauers did come in
that ſort, the faſt comming of the one vpon the other,
would make them ſeeme to be faf, faf, faf, which is as
abſurd and diſſonant, as mim, mim, mim.
                  
                  
                     Reſolution. Of the flat ſo comming, and of the ſharp,
there is not like reaſon, becauſe that the flat ſo comming
ſhould alter the vt, ſo that as many notes as had come
in C ſol fa vt, after the flat, ſhould be named ſol, and not
fa, but for the firſt note, & the ſecond, they muſt be both
fa, neuertheleſſe becauſe there may not be many of them
together, as there may be of mi, & becauſe that in quauers,
twiſe fa, in that ſort likely neuer chanceth, the one
is not ſo abſurd as the other.
                  
                     Replication. It is graunted by the laſt ſolution, that the
flat ſo comming ſhould alter the vt, but to alter the vt,
doth alter the key (which is in muſick a great abſurditie)
therefore by the laſt ſolution, there is a great abſurditie
graunted.
                  
                     Solution. It is graunted conditionally, that is to ſay, if
the like happened (as in the argument obiected) though
ſometimes in the middeſt of a ſong, to change the key,
and come into it againe, is allowed. Wherefore for the
names being the leaſt neceſſary and moſt troubleſome
accident, let this ſuffice.
               
            
            
               For Quantitie. Cap. 2.
               There be eight quantities whereof euery one hath
his proper marke, and proper reſt, as followeth.
               
                  
                  Large. 
                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
                  Longe. 
                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
                  Breefe. 
                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
                  Semibreefe 
                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
                  Minim. 
                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
                  Cratchet. 
                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
                  Quauer. 
                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
                  ſemiquauer 
                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
               
               The proportion that theſe quantities hath one to another
is that there ſhould goe two of euery one to the
next vpward as two ſemiquauers, to a quauer, two quauers
to a cratchet, two cratchets to a minim, &c.
               To theſe are reduced the quantities of proportions, as
where there goeth three cratchets to a minim length of
which the black ſemibreefe comprehendeth two, & ther
the minim reſt is but as long as one of theſe cratchets.

                     〈♫〉
                  
               
               Heere note that the prick is in quantitie half ſo long
as the note before it: as a prick after a large, is in quantitie
as a long. &c.
               Prickes of diuiſion are vſed to ſeperate diuerſitie of
kindes in quantitie.
            
            
               For Time. Cap. 3.
               There be 2. kindes of time, Semibreefe time, & three

minim time. Semibrefe time is the ſtriking vp & downe
of the hand equally in length continuing. Three minim
time is the ſtriking downe & then vp of the hand
equally in length, making each latter ſtroke, iuſt halfe
the former.
               The marke of the former kinde of time is.
                     〈♫〉
                  
The marke of the latter is. 
                     〈♫〉
                  
               
               In tuning Songs of Semibreefe time, you muſt put
of the notes, as much as maketh a minim lēgth to euery
mouing of the hand, likewiſe in the minim time, ſaue
that to euery ſtroke there goeth but a minim length.
               Heere note that theſe two kindes of time, may be deuided
into minim time, by keeping all ſtrokes equall in
length, putting a minim length to euery whole ſtroke.
            
            
               For Tune. Cap. 4.
               There be eight notes, whoſe aſcention, and deſcention
doe comprehend all tunes, as the roote doth the tree,
be they neuer ſo difficult, with flats and Sharps, who ſo
knew how to vſe them, the notes are common, the vſe is
rare, or not yet found, which being knowen, will giue
great light to Muſitions, & breed great eaſe to Singing
men, the eight notes are theſe that follow, as:
               
                  〈♫〉
               
               The tune of theſe eight Notes is to be learned by
practiſe, and to be beleeued as a principle in Muſicke.
               Tune the firſt Note of any ſong as it ſerueth beſt
for the voyce.
               
                  
If the Note from which and to which you goe, be
both according to the Ʋt, of the Song, count according
to the eight notes altogether.
               If the note to which you goe bee altered by ſome
intermingled flat, then for comptings ſake name the
Note from which you goe, as well as the note to which
you goe, according to the Vt, of that intermingled flat,
and in ſo doing take great care not to looſe the tune of
the note from which you compt, as,
ſol fa ſol fa fa fa

                     〈♫〉
                  
               
               Firſt ſing thus: then compt thus: and ſo proceede thus.
               If the Note to which you goe, be altered in tune by
ſome intermingled ſharp, obſerue both in the note from
which and to which you goe, this Rule.
               Compt to the tune of ſharps by the Vt, put down to the
third place, when you haue thus compting by wrong
names gotten the right tunes, giue the right names after,
as:
la ſol fa mi ſol fa

                     〈♫〉
                  
               
               Firſt ſing thus: then compt thus: and ſo proceede thus.
               The ſharp may be put in the vpper fa, in the nether
fa, and in Vt.
               The ſharp in the Vt, taketh place of the ſharp in the
vpper or nether fa, for by the Vt of it, the other two places
ſhould be ſharp, the reſt of the places remaining naturally

as,

                     〈♫〉
                  
               
               
                  Vt for compting.
                  Likewiſe the ſharp in the nether fa, taketh place of
the ſharp in the vpper fa, for by the Vt of the ♯ in the
nether fa, the vpper fa muſt bee ſharp, the reſt remaining
naturally: as,

                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
               
               
                  Vt for Compting.
                  The flat may be put in two places, in Mi, and in La,
alſo it is common in Mi, but not ſo common in La: alſo
if the flat be in La (according to the Vt of it) Mi muſt
be flat: as,

                        〈♫〉
                     
Heere note that for to tune ſharps, put downe Vt, to
the third place.
                  If the note to which you goe may neither in tuning
nor naming belong to one order of aſcention, go back
to the note before, and ſo Compt: as,
ſol fa fa mi ſol fa

                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
                  Firſt begin thus, Then go back thus, and ſo proceed thus.
                  
                     
As men name according to the Vt, of the flat, ſo there
be, that (for facility & fitneſſe of the name to the tune)
do name according to the Vt of the ſharp ſomtimes: as,
mi re mi.

                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
                  Heere note, that the intermingled flat beareth force
but whileſt notes as appendant come in the ſame place,
though for handſomneſſe men name beefore or after
according to it: Likewiſe the ſharp, as,
la

                        〈♫〉
                     
                  
                  Thappendancy of the flat by the ſharp, and of the
ſharp by the Flat is taken away, though by negligence
and ignorance of prickers, we are oft driuen to gather
thappendancie by the courſe of the ſong. Looke in the
laſt example.

with the note before it.

               For naming. Cap. I.
               
                  THe exceptions from the order of aſcention
& deſcention are diuerſely vſed
according to the diuerſitie of place, and
accordingly, they are to bee giuen, for
each order in naming ſeemeth beſt
to them that haue beene brought vp
withall.
               D, is ſometimes vſed in old ſongs as a Cleue, and
putteth Vt downe to the fift place.
               In Italy (as I vnderſtand) they change Vt into Sol:
In England they change Re, into La: when the next
remouing Note before or after be vnder.
               Some there bee that vſe ſometimes in defending at
this day, the names of Re, and Vt, there be that name at
randon, ſome for pleaſure, and ſome through ignorant
imagination, often times beareth great force in making
a thing ſeeme comely, or vncomely, as if in comming
downe, Sol, Fa, La, Sol, a man ſhould name the firſt
two notes Re Mi, it would ſeeme to a ſinging man very
vncomely: yet if the ſinging man did imagin, that the
ſinger were putting a dittie, or word of foure ſillables,

as: Remigrare, to theſe foure Notes, he would not think
it vncomely, & yet in doing the deed, both waies are all
one, for the firſt two ſillables of, Remigrare, are Re, Mi.
            
            
               For Quantitie. Cap. II.
               TO make one and the ſelfe ſame mark of quantitie
ſometimes long, and ſometimes ſhort, Muſitions in
old time, borrowed colours of the Painters, ſometimes
making it red, and ſometimes black, &c.
               They borrowed numbers of Arithmatike, ſomtimes
making this, and ſometimes that figure, &c.
               They borrowed Circles and Semicircles of Geometrie:
ſometimes putting in the Center or a lyne, & ſometimes
leauing it out, &c. Sometimes alſo thereby ſignifying
alteration in time.
               They borrowed ſimilitudes of Philoſophie, ſometimes
leauing fulneſſe, and ſometimes Eclips, as appeareth
in the Moone, ſometimes knitting and ſometimes
looſing, as in generation and corruption.
               They vſed moreouer many ſignes and tokens and
marks of Quantitie, that are cut off as ſuperfluous.
               They vſed alſo manifold names to diſtinguiſh theſe
things one from another, to the wonderfull peſtering of
the memory, & great toile of the vnderſtanding, though
ſome of them wer neceſſary, yet many were ſuperflous.
               The Quantities in Proportion are diuers, according
to the diuerſitie of Proportions, which are infinite in potentia,
that is to ſay, in poſſibilitie of increaſe, as nūber is.

hold the ſtone vp by the ſide of the ſtick: then as you
let fall the ſtone, inſtantly begin to ſing one Note, and

of anoher: ſome vſe helpe of an Inſtrument,
which is the better way.

                     Ʋt of the
ſong, before they practiſe intermingled Flats or ſharps.
               Heere note, that C. called Cſolfavt cleue, is a fift beneth
G. called Gſolrevt cleue, and F. called F favt cleue,
is a fift beneth C. called Cſolfavt, Cleue.
               Alſo a man may compt from any cleue, by the letters,
compting them forward when hee goeth vpward,
and acompting them backward when he goeth downward,
telling but the firſt ſeuen letters: by the knowledge
of this, men may giue their tunes to the parts
without knowledge of the Gamvt. Yet for the common
vſe, it were not amiſſe, that learners ſhould ſometime
or other commit the Gam-vt to memory.
               Many things are heere taught by rule, for which

teachers heeretofore, gaue no rule, and if they were aſked
how ſhall a man know the like? they would anſwere,
that is according to the courſe of the Song, but

                  THis preſent table, may ſerue alſo, who ſo
marketh it well, for 2 parts in one, without a
plaine ſong, of all kinds, & in all waies for 3
parts in one, without a plainſong, or ground,
the third part being vnder: of all kindes & of all wayes
for 2 parts in one, vpon 2 plain ſongs, or groūds at once,
for maintaining reports, & other ſuch things as theſe be.
               Firſt it is to be vnderſtanded by this word place, is
ment the diſtance of the following part, to the former
part, as the ſame place or vniſon, is called the firſt place,
the next or ſecond place is called the ſecond place, whether
it be vp or downe, &c.
               Next heere is to be vnderſtanded that by this word,
Courſe, is ment the diſtaunce of that which followeth
iuſt ſo long after, as the following part reſteth
to that which goeth beefore, in the plaine Song or
ground, as if the following part haue a Semibreefe
reſt, then the Note of the ground is in the firſt courſe,
which hath in the ſame place that which followeth,
iuſt a Semibreefe length after, and that note is in the
ſecond courſe, which hàth in the ſecond place that
which followeth iuſt a Semibreefe length after, whether
it bee vp or downe, &c.
               This beeing knowne, firſt looke in what place vp
or downe, you would haue the following part to bee,
which is according to the pleaſure of the maker, and ſo
it is how long the following part ſhall reſt. Then looke
in what courſe vp or downe is the note of the ground,
for which you would make, then looke what ſquare of
the table meeteth with the place and courſe, and there

you ſhall finde noted by figures, what concord ſerueth
for that courſe.
               All Concords next expreſſed in the ſquare, make
diſcords betwixt the vpper part and the plaine ſong or
ground. Neuertheleſſe, they may be brought in, when
they may be garded by the place next adioyning, for
whatſoeuer maketh a diſcord, the next place to it maketh
a concord.
               Note alſo that iuſt ſo long before the cloſe, as the
following part reſteth, you make not that which breedeth
a diſcord, betwixt the vpper part and the ground,
not that which to the cloſe of the ground is one more
in number then the ſecond figure of obſeruation.
               Note alſo, that if iuſt ſo long before the cloſe as the
following part reſteth, you make that which to the cloſe
is two more in number then the firſt figure of obſeruation,
then then the beſt way is to make it ſharp.
               Note alſo, that from the beginning forth, of ſo farre
before the cloſe, as the following part reſteth, all concords
ſerueth.
            
            
               The expoſition of the figure
of obſeruation.
               
                  THe firſt and ſecond figures ſheweth what
diſtaunces (in reſpect of the latter notes of
the courſe) ſhould not come twiſe together,
remouing one way with the latter notes, and
alſo where in reſpect of the latter note of the courſe, a

flat for a ſharp, or a ſharp for a flat, contrary to the order
of the place ſhould not bee.
               The third & fourth ſheweth what mouing one way
with the place, iuſt ſo long after as the following part
reſteth, maketh diſcords.
               The fift and ſixt ſerueth wherein the diſtance, there
ſhould not be like mouing one way with the place iuſt
ſo long after as the following part reſteth, and the fift figure.
Alſo where ſharp for flat, or flat for ſharp, contrary
to the order of the place ſhould not bee iuſt ſo long
after as the following reſteth.
               Heere note, that vnder each number are comprehended
all thoſe that maketh eights, or concords, of that
kinde to it, except that vnder the laſt figure of obſeruation
ſuch as make eights to the number one way with
the place, and ſuch as make ninthes to it in the contrary
way are comprehended.
               Heere note that two parts in one in the vnizon,
fourth, and fift, doe differ from the reſt, for in the reſt,
both parts are tyed, to like order of aſcention, but in theſe
both parts do keepe like order according to their place.
               Note alſo, that in two parts in one, in the fourth vp,
and in the fift downe, the vpper fa, kept flat in the nether
parts cauſeth a ſtrange flat to be brought in the vpper
part, therefore the beſt way is to make it ſharp, vnleſſe
it bee in ſuch places as a ſtrange flat will doe well
to come in.
               
                  
                  
                     Two verſes comprehending the foreſaid Table,
which for neceſsities ſake of the matter, muſt
be vvritten croſsing one another:
                     Gladius Muſicus.
                     Aggredior quo aderis cado cernis adeſto mi Iheſu
                     
                        Ʋnum addas tollas
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         loco stet quatuor addas
                  
               
               
                  
IN this Table or figure aforeſayde, foure things are
comprehendend, the places, the 6. figures of obſeruation
belonging to them, the courſes and concords ſeruing
for them, for the ſeuen places, there be ſeuen words
in the blade of the Sword: the firſt word, Aggredior, is
alwaies for the firſt place: the ſecond word downward,
quo, is for the ſecond place downeward, &c. And the
ſecond word vpward, mi, is for the ſecond place vpward,
&c. This word, Iheſu, is cut off from the reſt, to ſignifie
that it beelongeth to another kinde, for in it the letters
numerable being 5. doe fignifie the firſt and ſecond figures
of obſeruation, and it is written one way with the
verſe, to ſignifie that it goeth according to the woord
of the verſe, which is for the place, for it ſignifieth one
number with the word of the verſe, that ſtandeth for the
place, as if the world bee the fourth world of the verſe,
then it ſignifieth, 4. &c. and 5. ſignifieth the fift number,
to that, as the fift number to foure is 8. and ſo are
the firſt and ſecond figures of obſeruation found. Then
are the other foure figures of obſeruation to bee found
by the croſſe verſe, which ſayth: adde one to the place,
take one from the place, let the place ſtand, adde foure
to the place, and ſo ſhall you finde the third, fourth, fift,
and ſixt figures of obſeruation.
               Heere note, that if the place be the vnizon, becauſe
you cannot take one from a vnizon, take it from eight,
which is of the ſame kinde, when you haue thus done,
tourne the poynt of the Sword downe, and then the ſeuen
woords, ſerueth for the ſeuen courſes in this order:
Firſt the word that ſerueth for the place, ſerueth for the

firſt courſe, the ſecond woord vpward, for the ſecond
courſe vpward: the ſecond woord downeward, for the
ſecond courſe downward, &c. As the Sword now ſtandeth,
compting about vpon the ſeuen words, when you
haue found what woord ſerueth for the courſe, looke
what vowels bee in it, and thereby you ſhall know the
concords, that ſerueth for that courſe, as if the vowell
bee A. it ſignifieth the vnizon. If it be E, it ſignifieth the
third, If it bee I, it ſignifieth the fift. And if it be O, it
ſignifieth the ſixt. Lo, thus are all the things expreſſed at
large in the table, briefely contriued in the compaſſe of
two verſes.
            
            
               
               The names of the Cords for Counterpoint, Deſcant,
