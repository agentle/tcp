               IN old World, The Biſhops of Rome preached
painefully, and ordinarily, as may
appeare by the Homilies which are extant
vnto this day, vnder the names of
Leo the Firſt, and Gregory the Firſt:
But à multis ſeculis vix quiſquam (ex
Romanis Pont.) reperitur è Cathedra docuiſſe:
It can hardly bee proued, that any one Biſhop of
Rome, for many of theſe hundred yeeres laſt paſt, were
ſeene in a Pulpit, asDe Rege ex li. 3. cap. 2. p. 225. 
               Ioh. Mariana confeſſeth.
            In old World, The Biſhops of Rome were Cenſu pauperrimi,

                Poore in purſe, but rich in wiſdome
and goodneſſe: But, nunc aliquoties contingunt Rom.

haue many Biſhops of Rome, rich in purſe, but as poore in

            In old World, All Biſhops, and ſuch Presbyters who
were of any ſpeciall note for their honeſty and learning
were called Popes, asPanopl. lib. 4. cap. 80. fol. 4

Biſhop of Rome claymes it in his ſole right to be called
Pope.Ad ſin. Epiſt. 55. Greg. 7. apud Binn. To. 3. Conc. part. 2. pa. 1196. 
               Gregory the Seuenth, about the yeere 1073. (a
little after the Diuell was let looſe) made a Decree to that
purpoſe, prouiding: Vt Papae nomen vnicum eſſet in vniuerſo
orbe Chriſtiano, nec liceret alicui ſeipſum vel alium eo nomine
appellare: That there ſhould bee but one man in all
Chriſtendome called Pope: and that no man ſhould dare
to ſtyle himſelfe, or any other, with the name of Pope.
            In old World, The Biſhops of Rome were ſtyled by other
Biſhops with ſuch Titles as argued good fellowſhip
among them, and no ſuperiority in one ouer another.
Ep. 52. Anton. Saint Cyprian tearmed Cornelius Biſhop of Rome, frater,
Collega, Coepiſcopus, Brother, Colleague, and fellow Biſhop.
TheTheodor. Hiſt. lib. 2. cap. 8. Biſhops aſſembled in Councell at Sardica, ſpeaking
of Julius Biſhop of Rome, gaue him no other titles, than
that of Brother, & Colleague: which they gaue indifferently
to Athanaſius, Aſclepas, and all other Biſhops to whom
they writ, and of whom they had occaſion to ſpeake. In
like manner, theTheodor. Hiſt. lib. 5. cap. 9. Biſhops of Conſtantinople vſed Damaſus
Biſhop of Rome, Brothering him, and Colleaguing him, as
they did others, to whom they writ as well as to him.

they ſet their names after the Emperours: But hic ſtylus

            In old World, the Cardinals of Rome were inferiour
to Biſhops: in ſo much, that a Cardinall-ſhip was but a
ſtep to a Biſhopricke▪ But now Cardinals are ſuperiours
to all Biſhops. A Biſhopricke is a ſtep to a Cardinal-ſhip,
