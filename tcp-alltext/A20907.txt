               SO oft as I call to minde (deare friend and choſen Brother) the dreadfull and fearefull ſayings of God, that he which layeth hold vpon the plow and looketh back againe, is not meet for the kingdome of heauen. And on the other

ſide to remember the comfortable words of our Sauiour Chriſt, to all thoſe that forſaking themſelues do follow him: I cannot but maruell at thée, and lament thy caſe; that thou which ſomtimes wert the liuely member of Chriſt, but now the deformed impe of the diuell; ſometimes the beautifull temple of God, but now the ſtinking and filthy kenell of Sathan; ſometimes the vnſpotted ſpouſe of thy Sauiour, but now the vnſhamefaſt paramour of Antichriſt, ſomtimes my faithfull brother, but now a ſtranger & Apoſtata, yea ſometimes a ſtout chriſtian ſoldior, but now a cowardly runaway. So oft as I conſider the threatnings and promiſes of the diuine Iuſtice to all thoſe which faithfully loue him: I cannot but ſpeake to thée, yea rather cry out and exclaime againſt thée, thou ſéed of Sathan, and not of Iuda, whom the Diuell hath deceiued, the world hath beguiled, and deſire of life hath ſubuerted, and made of a Chriſtian an Infidell.

How canſt thou, hauing knowledge, or how dareſt thou neglect the law of the Lord, and follow the vaine traditions of men? And whereas thou haſt been a publique profeſſor of his Name, become now a defacer of his glorie.
               I will not refuſe the true God, and worſhip the inuention of man, the golden Calfe, the whore of Babylon the Romiſh religion, the abhominable Idol, the moſt wicked Maſſe: wilt thou torment againe, rent and teare the moſt precious bodie of our Sauior Chriſt with thy bodily and fleſhly téeth, without the breaking whereof vpon the croſſe, our ſins and tranſgreſſions, could els no way be redéemed? wilt thou take vpon thee to offer vp any ſacrifice vnto God for our ſinnes, conſidering that Chriſt offorod vp himſelfe (as S. Paul ſaith) vpon the Croſſe, a liuely ſacrifice once for all.
               Can neither the puniſhment of the Iſraelites (which for their Idolatry ſo oft they receiued) moue thee; neither the terrible threatnings of the ancient Prophets ſtirre thée, nor the croſſes of Gods own mouth feare thée to honor any other God then him? wilt thou ſo regard him that ſpared not his deare and onely ſonne for thée, ſo diminiſhing, yea vtterly extinguiſhing his glory, that thou wilt attribute the praiſe and honor to Idols, which haue mouths and ſpeake not, eyes and ſée not, eares and yet heare not, which ſhall periſh with them that made them: What ſaith the Prophet Baruck, where he reciteth the Epiſtle of Ieremie, written to the captiue Iewes, did he not forewarne them that in Babylon they ſhould ſee Gods of Gold, Siluer, Wood and Stone, borne vpon mens ſholders to cauſe a feare vpon the Heathen? But

be not you afraid of them (ſaith Ieremy) nor do as other doe: But when you ſee others worſhip them, ſay you in your hearts, It is thou (O Lord) that oughteſt only to be worſhipped: for as touching the timber of thoſe Gods the Carpenter framed them, and polliſhed them, yea guilded they be and laid ouer with ſiluer and vaine things and cannot ſpeake: he ſheweth moreouer, the abuſe of their deckings, how the prieſts tooke off their ornaments, & apparelled their women therewithall: How one holdeth a Scepter, another a ſword in his hand, and yet can they iudge in no matter, nor defend themſelues, much leſſe any other, from either hatred or murther, nor yet from gnawing wormes, duſt, filth, or any other euill thing: theſe and ſuch like words ſpeaketh Ieremy vnto them, wherby he proueth them but vaine things, & no Gods, and at laſt hee concludeth thus; confounded bee thoſe that worſhip them.
               
               They were warned by Ieremie, and thou as Ieremie haſt warned others, and art warned thy ſelfe by many Scriptures in many places.
               God ſaith he is a iealous God, which will haue all honor, glory, & worſhip giuen to him onoly. And Chriſt ſaith in the fourth of Luke to Sathan which tempted him: euen to the ſame Sathan, the ſame Belzebub, the ſame Diuell which hath preuailed againſt thée: It is written (ſaith he) thou ſhalt honour the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerue.
               
               Theſe and ſuch like do prohibit thée, and all Chriſtians to worſhip any other God then he which was before al worlds, and laid the foundations both of heauen and earth, and wilt thou honor a deteſtable Idol inuented by the popes of Rome, and the vncharitable colledge of politick Cardinals?
               Chriſt offered vp himſelfe once for all, and wilt thou offer him vp againe dayly at thy pleaſure? But thou wilt ſay thou doeſt it for a good intent? Oh ſinke of ſinne! Oh child of perdition! canſt thou dreame of any good entent therein, when thy conſcience beareth thée witnes of the wrath of God promiſed againſt thée?

Doeſt thou not remember the ſaying of Dauid, a notable King, which teacheth thée, a miſerable wretch, in his 104. Pſalme, where he ſaith, When thou takeſt away thy Spirit (O Lord) from men, they dye, and are turned againe to their duſt, but when thou letteſt thy breath go forth, they ſhall be made and thou ſhalt renew the face of the earth.
               
               Remember the ſaying of Chriſt in his Goſpel, whoſoeuer ſeeketh to ſaue his life ſhall looſe it, but whoſoeuer will looſe it for my ſake ſhall finde it: And in an other place: Who ſo euer loueth Father or Mother aboue me, is not meet for me, for he that will be my Diſciple, muſt forſake Father and Mother, and himſelf, and take vp his croſſe and follow me: what croſſe, the croſſe of infamy and ſhame, of miſery and pouerty, of affliction and perſecution for his Names ſake.

               Marke my deare friend (yea friend if thou béeſt not Gods enemy,) there is no vnitie but when Chriſt knitteth the knot amongſt ſuch as be his, yea bee you well aſſured that where his truth is reſident, there it is verified, that he ſaith: Non veni mittere pacem in terram ſed gladium, that is, Chriſt came to ſet one againſt another▪ the Sonne againſt the Father, the Daughter againſt the Mother: Deceiue not thy ſelfe therfore with the gliſtring & glorious name of vnity▪ for Antichriſt hath his vnity, yet not in déed, but in name, for the agréement of euill men is not an vnitie, but a conſpiracie.
               Thou haſt heard ſome threatnings, ſome curſes, and ſome admoniſhments of the Scriptures to thoſe which loue themſelues aboue Chriſt.
               Thou haſt heard alſo the ſharp and biting words to thoſe which deny him for loue of life, ſaith hee not, that hee which denieth mee before men, I will deny him before my Father which is in heauen: And to the ſame effect writeth S. Paul in the 6. to the Hebrewes, ſaying, It is impoſſible, that they which haue been once lightned, and haue taſted of the heauenly gift of grace, and beene made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, & haue relliſhed of the pure word of God, if they fall
                  
                  and ſlide away, it is impoſſible that they ſhould bee renewed againe by repentance, crucifying againe to themſelues the Son of God, and making him as it were a mocking-ſtock, or gaud of their fancies. And againe (ſaith he) If we ſhall willingly ſin after we haue receiued the knowledge of the truth, there is no oblation left for ſin, but the terrible expectation of Iudgement and fire which ſhall deuour the aduerſaries. Thus S. Paul writeth, and thus thou readeſt, and doſt thou not quake and tremble? well, if theſe terrible and thundering alarums cannot ſtir thée to ariſe and cleaue vnto Chriſt, and forſake the world, yet let the ſwéet conſolations and promiſes of the Scriptures: let the examples of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, both Martyrs and Confeſſors encourage thee to take faſter hold by Chriſt. Hearken what he ſaith againe in his holy Goſpell; Bleſſed are you when men reuile you, and perſecute you for my ſake, reioyce and bee glad, for great is your reward in heauen, for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets before you.
               
               Heare what Eſay ſaith; Feare not the curſe of men, be not affraid of their blaſphemies and reuilings, for Wormes and Mothes ſhall eat them vp like cloath and wooll, but my righteouſneſſe ſhall endure for euer, and my ſauing health from Generation to Generation: What art thou then (ſaith hée) that feareſt a mortall man, the Child of a man, which fadeth away as doth the flower, and forgetteſt the Lord that made thee, that ſpread out the heauens like a curtaine, and laid the foundations of the earth ſo ſure, that they can not be remooued: I am the Lord thy God, which maketh the Sea to rage, and to be ſtill, who is the Lord of Hoaſts; I ſhall put my word in thy mouth, and defend thee with the turning of a hand. And our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples: They ſhall accuſe you, and bring you before the Princes and Rulers for my name ſake, and ſome of you they ſhal perſecute and kill: But feare you not (ſaith he) neither care you not what you ſhall ſay, for it is my Spirit that ſpeaketh in you, the hand of the higheſt ſhall defend you, for the haires of
                  
                  your heads are numbred, and none of them ſhall periſh. I haue laid vp treaſure for you (ſaith he) where no theefe can ſteale, nor Moth corrupt, and happy are you if you endure to the end. Feare not them (ſaith Chriſt) which haue power ouer the body onely, but feare him that hath power both ouer the body and the Soule; The world loueth her owne, and if you were of the world the world would loue you, but you are mine, and therefore the world doth hate you.
               
               Let theſe and ſuch like conſolations out of the ſcriptures, ſtrengthen you to God-ward: let not the examples of holie men and women go out of your mind, as that of Daniel, and the reſt of the Prophets; of the thrée Children of Eleazarus, that conſtant Father; the Machabees Children, that of Peter, Paul, Stephen, and other Apoſtles and holy Martyrs, in the beginning and infancy of the Church; as of good Simeon Arch-biſhop of Seloma and Zetrophon

Feckenham, then Chaplaine to Queene Mary, was ſent vnto her about ſome foure dayes before her death, who had with her a long and tedious diſputation, but as the reſt found himſelfe in all holy gifts ſo ſhort of her excellence, that he acknowledged himſelfe fitter to bee her Diſciple, then Teacher: And thervpon humbly beſought her to deliuer vnto him ſome briefe ſumme of her Faith, which hee might hereafter keepe, and as a faithfull witneſſe publiſh to the world; to which ſhee willingly condiſcended, and bad him boldly queſtion her in what points of religion ſo euer it pleaſed him, and ſhe would giue her faithfull and beleeuing anſwere, ſuch as ſhee would euer bee ready to ſeale with her deareſt blood: The ſumme of which conference you ſhall heare read as it was written with her own hand, and her name ſubſcribed therevnto, as followeth.
            
            
               A conference Dialogue-wiſe held betweene the Lady Iane Dudley and M. Feckenham, foure dayes before her Death, touching her Faith and Religion.

                  VVHat thing is required in a Chriſtian?
               
               
                  Iane.
                  To beleeue in God the Father, in God the Sonne, in God the Holy Ghoſt, three perſons and one God.
               
               
                  Feck.
                  Is there nothing elſe required in a Chriſtian, but to beleeue in God?
               
               
                  Iane
                  Yes: We muſt beleeue in him, wee muſt loue him, with all our heart, with all our ſoule, and all our minde, and our Neighbour as our ſelfe.
                  
               
               
                  Feck.
                  Why then Faith iuſtifieth not, nor ſaueth not?
               
               
                  Iane.
                  Yes verily, Faith (as S. Paul ſaith) onely iuſtifieth.
                  
               
               
                  Feck.
                  Why S. Paul ſaith, if I haue all the Faith of the world, without loue, it is nothing.
                  
               
               
                  Iane.
                  True it is, for how can I loue him I truſt not,

or how can I truſt in him whom I loue not, Faith & Loue euer agree together, and yet Loue is comprehended in Faith.

                  Iane
                  To loue our Neighbour, is to feed the hungry, cloth the naked, and to giue drinke to the thirſty, and to do to him as we would doe to our ſelues.

                  Why then it is neceſſarie to ſaluation to doe good workes, and it is not ſufficent to beleeue?
               
               
                  Iane
                  I deny that I affirme that faith onely ſaueth: But it is méet for all Chriſtians, in token that they follow their Maſter Chriſt, to doe good works: yet may we not ſay, nor in any wiſe beléeue, that they profit to ſaluation: for although we haue done all that we can, yet wee are vnprofitable ſeruants, and the faith we haue onely in Chriſts blood, and his merits ſaueth.

                  By the Sacrament of Baptiſme I am waſhed with Water, and regenerated in the Spirit, and that waſhing is a token to mee that I am the Child of God: The Sacrament of the Lords Supper is offered vnto me as a ſure Seale and Teſtimonie, that I am, by the blood of Chriſt which hee ſhed for me on the Croſſe, made partaker of the euerlaſting Kingdome.

                  No ſurely, I doe not beleeue ſo I think
                        •
                      at that Supper I receiue neither fleſh nor bloud, but onely Bread and Wine, the which bread when it is broken, and the wine when it is drunke, putteth mee in minde how that for my

ſinnes the body of Chriſt was broken, and his bloud ſhed on the croſſe, and with that bread and wine I receiue the benefits which came by breaking of his body, and by the ſhedding of his bloud on the Croſſe for my ſinnes.

                  Why but (Madame) doth not Chriſt ſpeake theſe words; Take, eate, this is my body: can you require any plainer words: doth he not ſay, that it is his body?
               
               
                  Iane
                  I grant he ſaith ſo; and ſo he ſaith likewiſe in other places, I am the Vine, I am the Doore, it being onely but a figuratiue borrowed ſpeech: Doth not S. Paul ſay that he calleth thoſe things which are not as though they were: God forbid, that I ſhould ſay that I eate the very naturall body and bloud of Chriſt: For then either I ſhould plucke away my Redemption, or confeſſe their were two bodies, or two Chriſts: two bodies, the one body was tormented on the Croſſe, and then if they did eate another body, 
                        •
                     ow abſurd: againe if his body was eaten really, then it was not broken vpon the Croſſe, or if it were broken vpon the Croſſe (as it is doubtleſſe) then it was not eaten of his Diſciples.
               
               
                  Feck.
                  Why is it not as poſſible that Chriſt by his power could make his body both to be eaten and broken, as to bee borne of a woman without the ſeed of man, and as to walk on the Sea hauing a body, and other ſuch like myracles which he wrought by his power onely.
               
               
                  Ian.
                  Yes verily, if God would haue done at his laſt ſupper a myracle, he might haue done ſo: but I ſay he minded nor intended no worke or myracle, but onely to breake his bodie, and ſhed his bloud on the Croſſe for our ſinnes: But I beſeech you anſwere me to this one queſtion; where was Chriſt when he ſaid: Take, eate, this is my body: was not he at the Table, when he ſaid ſo hee was at that time aliue, and ſuffered not till the next day? Well, what tooke hee but bread? And what broke hee but bread? And what gaue hee but bread? Looke what hee tooke hee brake, and looke what hee brake hee gaue, and looke what hee gaue that did they eate, and yet all this while hee himſelfe was at

Supper before his Diſciples, or elſe they were deceiued.

                  You ground your Faith vpon ſuch Authors as ſay and vnſay, both with a breath, and not vpon the Church, to whom you ought to giue credit.
               
               
                  Iane
                  No, I ground my Faith vpon Gods word, and not vpon the Church: for if the Church bee a good Church, the faith of the Church muſt bee tryed by Gods word, and not Gods word by the church, neither yet my faith: Shall I beléeue the church becauſe of antiquitie? or ſhall I giue credit to that church which taketh away from mee a full halfe part of the Lords Supper, and will let no lay-man receiue it in bath kinds, but the Prieſts only themſelues, which thing if they deny to vs, they deny vs part of our ſaluation: And I ſay that it is an euil and no good Church, and not the ſpouſe of Chriſt, but the ſpouſe of the Diuell, which altereth the Lords Supper, and both taketh from it, and addeth to it: To that Church I ſay God wil adde plagues, and from that Church will he take their part out of the Book of Life: you may learne of S. Paul, how hee did adminiſter it to the Corinthians in both kindes, which ſince your Church refuſeth, ſhall I beleeue it, God forbid?

                  That was done by the wiſedome of the Church, & to a moſt good intent to auoid an hereſie, which then ſprung in it.

                  O but the Church muſt not alter Gods wil and ordinances for the colour or gloſſe of a good intent, it was the error of King Saul, and he not onely reaped a curſe, but periſhed thereby, as it is euident in the Holy Scriptures.
                  To this M. Feckenham gaue me a long, tedious, yet eloquent reply, vſing many ſtrong and Logicall perſwaſions, to compell me to haue leaned to their Church, but my Faith had armed my Reſolution to withſtand any aſſault that words could then vſe againſt mee: Of many other Articles of Religion we reaſoned, but theſe formerly rehearſed were the chiefeſt and moſt effectuall.

The tenor of the exhortation was this which followeth.

               I Haue heere ſent you (my deare Siſter Katherine) a booke, which although it be not outwardly trimmed with gold, or the curious imbroderie of the artful'ſt needles, yet inwardly it is more worth then all the precious mynes which the vaſt world can boaſt of: It is the booke (my only beſt and beſt loued Siſter) of the Law of the Lord: It is the Teſtament and laſt Will, which hee bequeathed vnto vs wretches and wretched ſinners, which ſhall leade you to the path of eternall ioy: And if you with a good minde reade it, and with an earneſt deſire follow it, no doubt it ſhall bring you to an immortall and euerlaſting life: It will teach you to liue, and learne you to dye: It ſhall win you more, and endow you with greater felicitite, then you ſhould haue gained by the poſſeſſion of our wofull fathers lands: for as if God had proſpered him, you ſhould haue inherited his hon

               My good Siſter once againe more let mee intreat thee to learne to dye; deny the World, defie the Diuell, and deſpiſe the Fleſh, and delight your ſelfe onely in the Lord: be penitent

for your ſinnes, and yet diſpayre not: be ſtrong in faith, yet preſume not, and deſire with S. Paul, to bee diſſolued, & to be with Chriſt, with whom, euen in death there is life.

               AFter the Lady Iane had finiſhed this exhortation to her ſiſter, and ſent it away by her ſeruant, there came vnto her two Biſhops and other learned Doctors, who likewiſe held with her more then two howers conference, ſtriuing with all their powers to haue drawne her to haue dyed in the obedience of their Church and fellowſhip, but found themſelues infinitely deceiued: for her faith beeing built vpon the rock of Chriſt, was by no worldly perſwation or comfort to bee either mooued or ſhaken, ſo that after the expence of time and the loſſe of much ſpeach, they left her (as they ſayd) a loſt and forſaken member, but ſhee, as before, prayed for them, and with a moſt charitable patience endured their worſt cenſures.
               The next day ſhe was called downe to goe to the place of execution, to which ſhée had prepared her ſelfe with more diligence then either the malice of her aduerſaries could deſire or the vigilance of any officer for the diſcharge of his duty expect, and being come downe & deliuered into the hands of the Sheriffes, they might behold in her a countenance ſo grauely ſetled with all modeſt and comely reſolution, that not the leaſt hayre or mote either of feare or griefe could be perceiued to procéed either out of her ſpéech or motions, but like a demure body, going to bee vmted to her hearts beſt and longeſt beloued: ſo ſhewed ſhe forth all the beames of a well mixt and tempered alacrity, rather inſtructing patience how it ſhould ſuffer, then being by patience any way able to indure the trauell of ſo gréeuous a iourney, with this bleſſed and modeſt boldnes of ſpirit vndaunted and vnaltered, ſhe went towards the ſcaffold, till whether through the mallice of ſome great aduerſary or the indiſcretion of the officers (but the latter is more credible,) ſhee incountred vppon the way (as ſhee went) the headleſſe trunke of her new dead Lord and Huſband the Lord Guilford Dudley, at that inſtant returning from the Scaffold to the Tower to bee buried, this ſpectacle a little ſtartled her, and many teares were ſeene to deſcend and fall vppon her cheekes, which

her ſilence and great heart ſoone dryed, and beeing now come vppon the Scaffold, after reuerence done to the Lordes and others in Commiſſion, (turning her ſelfe round about to the people) ſhee ſpake theſe wordes as followeth.
            
            
               The Lady Iane Dudleys words vpon the Scaffold before her death.
               MY Lordes, and you good Chriſtian people, which come to ſee me dye, I am vnder a law, and by that law (as a neuer erring Iudge) I am condemned to dye, not for any thing I haue offended the Quéens Maieſty, for I will waſh my hands guiltles thereof, and deliuer to my God a ſoule as pure from ſuch treſpas, as innocence from iniuſtice, but onely for that I conſented to the thing which I was enforced vnto, conſtraint making the law beleeue I did that which I neuer vnderſtood: notwithſtanding, I haue offended almighty God in that I haue followed ouermuch the luſt of mine owne fleſh and the pleaſures of this wretched world, neither haue I liued according to the knowledge that God hath giuen me, for which cauſe God hath appoynted vnto me this kind of death, and that moſt worthily, according to my deſerts, how bee it I thanke him hartily that hée hath giuen me time to repent my ſinnes heere in this world, and to reconcile my ſelfe to my redéemer, whom my former vanities haue in a great meaſure diſpleaſed. Wherefore (my Lords, and all you good Chriſtian people) I muſt earneſtly deſire you all to pray with me and for mée whilſt I am yet aliue, that God of his infinite goodneſſe and me
