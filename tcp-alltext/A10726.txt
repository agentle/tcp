               And flie to Wakefield ſtraight.

               So lookes the pent vp Lion on the lambe,
               
                  
And ſo he walkes inſulting ouer his praie,
               And ſo he turnes againe to rend his limmes in ſunder,
               Oh Clifford, kill me with thy ſword, and
               Not with ſuch a cruell threatning looke,

               Then let my fathers blood ope it againe? he is a
Man, and Clifford cope with him.

               Had I thy brethren here, their liues and thine
               Were not reuenge ſufficient for me.
               Or ſhould I dig vp thy forefathers graues,
               And hang their rotten coffins vp in chaines,

               Therefore till I root out that curſſed line

               After the bloudie fraie at Wakefield fought,
               Where your braue father breath'd his lateſt gaſpe,
               Tidings as ſwiflie as the poſt could runne,
               Was brought me of your loſſe, and his departure.

               Bearing the King in my behalfe along,
               For by my ſcoutes I was aduertiſed,
               That ſhe was comming, with a full intent
               To daſh your late decree in parliament,
               Touching king Henries heires and your ſucceſſion.
               Short tale to make, we at Saint Albons met,
               
                  
Our battels ioinde, and both ſides fiercelie fought.
               But whether twas the coldneſſe of the king,
               He lookt full gentlie on his warlike Queene,
               
               That robde my ſouldiers of their heated ſpleene.
               Or whether twas report of his ſucceſſe,
               Or more then common feare of Cliffords rigor,
               Who thunders to his captaines bloud and death,
               I cannot tell. But to conclude with truth,
               Their weapons like to lightnings went and came.
               Our ſouldiers like the might Owles laſie flight,

               With promiſe of hie paie and great rewardes,
               But all in vaine, they had no harts to fight,
               Nor we in them no hope to win the daie,

               Thankes gentle Warwike.
               
               How farre hence is the Duke with his power?
               And when came George from Burgundie to England?

               Some fiue miles off the Duke is with his power,
               But as for your brother he was latelie ſent
