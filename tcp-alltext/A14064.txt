                  To the ryght honorable & my ſpeciall good Lord & Maſter, the Lord Paget of Beudeſert. Chap. 1.
                  
                     MI Lord your father loued me,
                     and you my lord, haue proued me,
                     And both your loues haue moued me,
                     to wright as here is donne:
                     Synce God hath hence your father,
                     ſuch flowers as I gather,
                     I dedicate now rather,
                     to you my Lorde his ſonne,
                  
                  
                     Your father was my founder,
                     till death became his wounder,
                     no ſubiect euer ſounder,
                     whom prynce auauncement gaue:
                     As God did here defend him,
                     and honour here did ſend him.
                     ſo will I here commend him,
                     as long as life I haue.
                  
                  
                     His neighbours then did bliſſe him,
                     his ſeruants now do miſſe him,
                     the poore would gladly kiſſe him,
                     aliue agayne to be:
                     But God hath wraught his pleaſure,
                     and bleſt him out of meaſure,
                     with heauen & earthly treaſure,
                     ſo good a god is he.
                  
                  
                     His counſell had I vſed,

                        I nede not thus haue muſed,
                     nor droope as now I do:
                     But I muſt playe the farmer,
                     and yet no whit the warmer,
                     allthough I had his armer,
                     and other comfort to.

                     whoſe glory ſo did blinde him,
                     till taile cut of behinde him,
                     no fare could him content:
                     euen ſo, muſt I be prouing,
                     ſuch glory I had in louinge,
                     of things to plough behouinge,
                     that makes me now repent.
                  
                  
                     Loytrers I kept ſo meany,
                     both philip hob & cheany,
                     that that waye nothing geany,
                     was thought to make me thriue:

                     was neuer none aliue.
                  
                  
                     Great fines, ſo nere did pare me,
                     great rent, ſo much did ſkare me,
                     great charge, ſo long did dare me,
                     that made me at lēgth cry creak:
                     Much more of all ſuch fleeſes,

                     Though countrey helth long ſtaied me,
                     yet leaſe expiering fraied me,
                     and (ictus ſapit) praied me,
                     to ſeke more ſteady ſtaye:
                     Newe leſſons than I noted,

                     for that ſhe dailie ſpide me,
                     with countrey how I ſtood:

                     this Riddle thus ſayth.
                  
                  
                     I Seme but a drudge, yet I paſſe any king,
                  to ſuch as can vſe me, great welth I do bring.
                  Since Adam firſt liued, I neuer did die,
                  when Noe was a ſhipman, there alſo was I.
                  The earth is my ſtorehouſe, the ſea my fyſhponde,
                  what good is in eyther, by me it is fonde,
                  What hath any life, but I helpe to preſerue,
                  what wight without me, but is ready to ſterue.
                  In woodland, in Champion, City or towne,
                  if long I be abſent, what falleth not downe.
                  If long I be preſent, what goodnes can want,
                  though things at my comming, were neuer ſo ſcāt.
                  So many as loue me, & vſe me aright,
                  with treaſure & pleaſure, I ritchly acquite.
                  Great kings I do ſuccour, elſe wrōg would it go,
                  the king of all kings, hath appointed it ſo.

                     Of huſband, doth huſbandry challenge that name
                     of huſbandry, huſband doth likewiſe the ſame.
                     where huſwife & huſwifery, ioyneth with theaſe:
                     there welth in abundance, is gotten with eaſe.

                     of wife & the houſhold, the band & the ſtaye.
                     Some huſbandly thriueth, that neuer had wife,
                     yet ſkarce a good huſband, in goodnes of life.
                  
                  
                     The huſband is he, that to labour doth fall,
                     the labour of him, I do huſbandry call.
                     If thrift by that labour, be any way caught:
                     then is it good huſbandry, elſe is it naught.
                  
                  
                     So houſhold & houſholdry, I do define,
                     for folke & the goods, that in houſe be of thine.
                     Houſe keping to them, as a refuge is ſet:
                     which like as it is, ſuche report it doth get.
                  
                  
                     Be houſe or the furniture, neuer ſo rude,
                     of huſband & huſbandry, (thus I conclude)
                     with huſwife & huſwifery, if it be good,
                     muſt pleaſure together, as coſins in blood.

                     who fondly in doing, conſumeth his ſtock:
                     in thend for his folly, doth get but but a mock.

                     But ſhameles & craftie, that deſperat are:
                     make many full honeſt, the worſer to fare.
                  
                  
                     27
                     At ſometime to borow, accoumpt it no ſhame,
                     if iuſtly thou kepeſt, thy touch for the ſame.
                     who quick be to borrow, & ſlow be to pay:
                     their credit is naught, go they neuer ſo gay.
                  
                  
                     
                     28

                     truſt ſuch with a ſuertie, if ye be wiſe.
                     Or if he be angry, for aſking thy due:
                     once euen, to him afterward, lend not a new.
                  
                  
                     29
                     Accoumpt it well ſold, that is iuſtly well payd,
                     & coumpt it well bought, that is neuer denayde.
                     But yet here is tone, here is to ther doth beſt:
                     for buyer & ſeller, for quiet & reſt.

                     & tend to ſuch doings, as ſtandeth thee on.
                     In ſubſtance, although ye haue neuer ſo much,
                     delight not in paraſites, harlots & ſuch.
                  
                  
                     31
                     As Intreſt or vſery, plaieth the dreuel,
                     ſo, hilb ack & filbelly, byeteth as euell.
                     Put dyeſing among them, & docking the dell,
                     & all thy lyfe long, of a begger go ſmell.
                  
                  
                     32
                     Once weekely remember, thy charges to caſt,
                     once monthly ſe how, thy expenſes may laſt.
                     If quarter declareth, too much to be ſpent,
                     for feare of ill yere, take aduiſe of thy rent.

                     for lingring is hindrance to many a man.

                     The ſtone that is rowling, can gather no moſſe,
                     who often remoueth, is ſure of loſſe.

                     The eye of the maſter, enritcheth the hutch,
                     the eye of the miſtris, auayleth as much.
                     which eye, if it gouerns with reaſon & ſkill:

                     Who ſeketh reuengement, of euery wrong,
                     in quyet nor ſafety, continueth long.
                     ſo he that of wilfulnes, tryeth the lawe:
                     ſhall ſtriue for a coxcombe, & thriue as a dawe.

                     ſhall hardly in quiet, keepe that is his owne.

                     As Chriſtmas is onely, a figure or trope:
                     ſo onely in Chriſt, is the ſtrength of our hope.

                     as onely of whom, our comfort is had.
                     At Chriſtmas we ioy, altogether with mirth:
                     for his ſake that ioyed vs al, with his birth.

                        FRende, where we mette this other day,
                     We heard one make his mone and ſay,
                     Good Lorde, how might I thriue:
                     We heard an other anſwere him,
                     Then make the handſome trick & trym:

                     As touching thrift, I ſtand in doubt,
                     If men were beſt to wiue.
                  
                  
                     Affirmation.
                     There is no doubt, for proue I can,
                     I haue but ſeldome ſeene that man,

                     I ſhould not then be quit with menny,
                     In bondage for to wiue.

                     the wife of the houſe, to the huſband a ſtay.
                     If huſwife doth that, as belongeth to hir:
                     if huſband be wittye, there needeth no ſtir.

                     then is it good huſwiferie, elſe is it not.
                  
                  
                     The woman, the name of a Huſwife doth win,
                     by keeping her houſe, and of doings therein.
                     And ſhee that with huſband, will quietly dwell:
                     muſt think on this leſſon, and follow it well.
                  
                  FINIS.

                     Another good leſſon, of huſwiferie thought,
                     is huſwife with huſband, to lieue as ſhe ought.

                     3
                     Though trickſy to ſee to, be gallant to wiue,
                     yet comely & wiſe, is the huſwife to thriue.
                  
                  
                     4
                     When huſband is abſent, let huſwife be chiefe,
                     and looke to their labour, that eateth her biefe.

                     there ſeruants do loyter, and reaſon their caſe.
                  
                  
                     6
                     The huſwife ſo named (of keping the houſe)
                     muſt tend on her profit, as cat on the mouſe.

                     8
                     though home be but homly, yet huſwif is taught
                     that home hath no fellow, to ſuch as haue aught.

                     Good vſage with knowledge, & quiet with all,
                     Makes huſwife to ſhine, as the ſun on the wall.

                  the euill in him, we ought to hate, becauſe it is a ſin.
                  So doth thy dayly ſinnes, thy heauenly lorde offend:
                  but when thou doſt, repent the ſame, his wrath is at an end.
