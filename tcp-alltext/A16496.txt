               o ſtay.
            
               
                  
                     A LARKE ſomtimes did bréed,
               within a field of Corne:
               And had increaſe whē as yt Grayne
               was redy to be ſhorne.
               Shée wary of the tyme:
               and carefull for her neſt,
               Debated wiſely with her ſelfe.
               what thynge to doo were beſt.
               For to abyde the rage,
               of cruell Reapers hande,
               Shée knew it was to perillous,
               with ſafetie for to ſtande:
               And to diſlodge her Broode,
               vnable yet to flye:
               (Not knowing whither to remoue,)
               great harmes might hap therby
               Therfore ſhee ment to ſtaye,
               tyll Force cenſtraynd to fléete:
               And in the whyle for to prouyde,
               ſome other place as méete.
               The better to prouyde,
               the purpoſe of her mynde:
               She would forthwith go ſéeke abroad,
               and leaue her Yong behind:
               But firſt, ſhée bad them all
               attend their Mothers wyll,
               Which carefull was for to eſchewe
               each likelyhood of yll:
               This Corne is ripe (quoth ſhée,)
               wherein we neſtled are:
               The which (if héede preuents not harmes,)
               may cauſe our mortall care.
               Therfore to fence with ſkyll,
               the ſequeall of miſhappes:
               I wyll prouyde ſome other place,
               for feare of afterclappes:
               Whilſte I for this and Foode,
               am flowen hence awaye:
               With héedefull eares attentiue bée,
               what cōmers by doo ſaye.
               Thus ſayde, ſhée vaunſte her ſelfe,
               vpon her longeſt 
                     •
                  oe:
               And mounted vp into the Skies,
               ſtyll ſinging as ſhée flowe:
               Anone ſhée home returnde,
               full fraught with choyce of meate:
               But loe, (a ſuddaine change) her Byrdes
               for feare could nothyng eate.
               Therwith agaſt, ſhe cryed:
               what how? what meaneth this?
               I charge ye on my bleſſyng, tell:
               what thyng hath chaunſt amis?
               Are theſe my welcomes home,
               or thankes for Foode I haue?
               Ye wonted were with chirping cheare,
               to gape before I gaue:
               But now ſuch Quawmes oppreſſe
               your former quiet kynde:
               That (quite trāſformd) dumb mute thīgs

               The Prime and eldeſt Birde,
               (thus checkt) began to ſay,
               Alas deare Dame, ſuch news we hard,
               ſence ye were flowen awaye.
               That were it 
                     •
                  ot the truſte

               Our liues were loſt remediles,
               we know it well ynow:
               The Owner of this Plot,
               came hither with his Sonne,
               And ſayd to him, this wheat muſt down
               t'is more then time t'were don:
               Go get thee to my friendes,
               and byd them come to morne,
               And tell them that I craue their helpes,
               to reape a péece of Corne:
               The Larke that was the Dam,
               ſtood in a dump a whyle,
               And after ſaid, his Frindes (ꝙ hée)
               and then began to ſmile.
               Tuſh, Friendes are hard to finde,
               true friendſhip ſe

                  d appeares:
               A man miſſe to haue a Friend,
               that liues olde NESTORS yeares,
               True DAMON and his Friend,
               long ere our time were dead:
               It was in Gréece, a great way hence
               where ſuch two friends were bred:
               Our Country is to colde,
               to foſter vp a Friende:
               Tyll proofe be made, eche one wyll ſay,
               ſtyll yours vnto the ende.
               But trye in time of néede,
               and all your friends are flowen,
               Suche fruitleſſe Séede, ſuche fickle ſtay
               in faithleſſe Friendes, is ſowen:
               Therfore be of good chéere,

               Expell the Care, that cauſeleſſe thus,
               bereaues you of delightes:
               Let no ſurmiſed feare,

               My ſelfe wyll be amongſt ye ſtyll,
               that ſafely ſhall ye keepe.
               And ſweare

               If all his helpe be in his Fréendes,
               this Corne ſhall not goe downe.
               The Yong aſſured by her,
               That ſuch an Othe dyd ſweare:
               Dyd paſſe the time with wonted ſléepe,
               and baniſht former feare.
               And when the drowſie Night,
               was fled from gladſome Daye:
               Shée bad them wake and looke about
               for ſhe muſt go her way.
               And ſaide, I warrant you,
               theſe friendes wyll not come héere:
               Yet notwithſtandyng, liſten well,
               and tell me what you heare.
               Anone, the Farmer came,
               enraged wellnie madde:
               And ſware, who ſo depends on friends
               his caſe is worſe then badde.
               I wyll go ſet my Kinne▪

               In things of greater weight then this,
               their kindred ſhall appeare,
               The Larkes, their Dam returnd,
               informed her of all,
               And how, that he hymſelfe was gone,
               his kindred for to call:
               But when ſhe hard of Kinn

               This man him ſelfe is poore,

               And kindred now a dayes doth quaile,
               when néede compelles to craue.
               No, no: he ſhall returne,

               They all are ſo addicte
               vnto their priuate gayne,
               That if ye lacke power to requite,
               your Sutes are all in vayne.
               My ſelfe am ouerchardgde,

               ſo ſaye I nowe of Kin:
               Wée ſhall receyue no hurte by them,
               nor he no profite win.
               Yet liſten once agayne,
               what now is Refuge is,
               For kinred ſhalbe lyke to Friendes.
               be well aſſured of this:
               I muſt go furniſh vp,
               a Neaſt I haue begone:
               And wyll returne and bring ye meate,
               aſſoone as it is don.
               Then vp ſhe clam the Clowdes,
               with ſuch a luſty Laye:
               That it re
                     •

               And muche they did cōmende,
               their Mothers lofty gate,
               And thought it long til time had brought
               them ſelues to ſuch eſtate.
               Thus whilſte their twinkelynge eyes,
               were rouyng to and fro:
               They ſaw where as the Farmer came.
               that was their mortall Foe.
               Who after due complaintes,
               Thus ſaid in the ende:
               I wyll from hencefoorth truſt my ſelfe,
               and not to kinne nor Friende.
               Who geues me gloſing wordes,
               and fayles me at my néede:
               May in my PATER NOSTER bée
               but neuer in my CREEDE,
               
               My ſelfe wyll haue it downe,
               ſince néedes it muſt be ſo,
               For proofe hath taught me too mutch wit
               to truſt to any mo.
               The Birdes that liſtenyng laye,
               attentiue to the ſame:
               In
                     •
                  ormde their Mother of the whole,
               as ſoone as ere ſhe came.
               Yée mary then quoth ſhee,
               the caſe now altered is:
               We wyll no longer heare abyde,
               I alwayes feared this,
               But out ſhe got them all,
               and trudged away apace,
               And through the Corn ſhe brought them ſafe,
               into another place.
               God ſend her lucke to ſhun
               both Hauke and Fowlers Gin,
               And mée the hap to haue no neede,
               of Friends, nor yet of Kin,
               ¶ FINIS.
