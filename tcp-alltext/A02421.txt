                  Certaine Engliſh verſes, preſented to the Queenes moſt excellent Maieſtie, in the Parke at Saint Iames, on Sunday the xviii. of Auguſt 1588.
               
               
                  SVch Rebels as do meane to ſell,
               their crowne to forreine foes:
               Againſt their Queene for to rebel
               whoſe ſecrets God diſcloſe.
               Marke well, and read this ſtory mine,
               though ſimple and rude it be:
               And to your Queene with heart encline
               let treaſon from you flee.
               For I am one that captiue am,
               and know the Spaniards heart:
               Although he loue the traitors name,
               at length hee makes him ſmart.
               He giues the traitor daily pay,
               while treaſon is a working:
               But afterwards to his decay,
               he cuts him ſhort from barking.
               Which is the due and iuſt reward,
               that doeth belong to treaſon:
               The hangman takes him by the beard,
               to cut his head with reaſon.
               
                  Examples many I could bring,
               which lately hath bene prooued:
               Of thoſe that wrote to Philip king,
               whoſe hearts to treaſon mooued.
               The youthfull Duke of Bragan ſoile,
               
                  Barganſiae cald by name:
               Who gaue the Portugall the ſpoile,
               and brought himſelfe to ſhame.
               Alſo the Coundie of Caſkails,
               did ioine with him in treaſon:
               Pretending for to purchaſe vailes,
               being void and cleare of reaſon.
               And ſo they ſold their natiue land,
               to Philip king of Spaine:
               Who hauing Portugall in hand,
               as king therein did raigne.
               Who ſudainly did turne his face,
               from this good duke and Coundie
                     •
                  
               
               And gaue no credit to their race,
               wherein they knew the follie.
               Therefore good Chriſtian countrimen,
               take heed, beware betime:
               Let no falſe treaſon mooue you then,
               to Pope, nor Spaniſh king.
               
                  Let not affection blind your eies,
               nor popiſh tales deceiue:
               Let not the Spaniards tales nor lies,
               conſtraine you to beleeue.
               For they are deuils, and are not gods,
               ſeeing people they deceiues:
               I wiſh you well, beleeue him not,
               if you will liue at eaſe.
               Therefore you Saxon ſorte,
               that rebels meane to liue:
               Marke well, and reade the euill report,
               that Portugals do giue.
               The Southerne Spaniſh race,
               that mankinde would ſubiect:
               To turne vs all from Chriſtes lawes,
               to liue in Popiſh ſect.
               Repent therefore in time,
               and call to God for grace:
               To Queene Elizabeth doe incline,
               and flie from Spaniards race.
               Be true vnto the Engliſh Crowne,
               and doe the Pope deteſt:
               Procure to beat the Spaniards downe,
               the Romanes, and the reſt.
               
                  Examples good you may well take,
               of Italie, and Cicilia ſoyle:
               By ſpaniards, Flanders all doth quake,
               they Portugale did ſpoyle.
               Therefore, good Engliſh knightes,
               be true vnto your Queene:
               In noble mindes ſet your delights,
               and flie from treaſon cleane.
               Marke well a Captiues plaint,
               that doth lament your caſe:
               To Queene Elizabeth be you not faint,
               and call to God for grace.
               And thus with mournefull heart,
               from Galley I doe end:
               Where I doe feele the bitter ſmart,
               of Popiſh Spaniſh men.
               Farewell good natiue ſoyle,
               farewell good Countrey mine:
               Defend your land from Spaniſh foyle,
               and flie from Spaniſh line.
               I write with dolefull pen,
               my leaue of you to take:
               My life I lead in Galley cheyne,
               from whence my moane I make.

               An other at the ſame time deliuered to her Maieſtie by DAVID GWYN.
               THe Eagle and the Lyon fearce,
               doe ioyne their ſubiects all:
               Againſt the Saxon ſoyle to pearce,
               their counſell they doe call.
               To knowe the way for to obteine
               their long deſired will,
               In iudgement ſeate they ſit againe,
               to vtter all their ſkill.
               And as the commons bragge and boaſt,
               a fleete they meane to make:
               To ſaile vnto the Engliſh coaſt,
               the Queene and land to take.
               With helpe of Rebels they doe thinke,
               the Saxon land to ſpoyle:
               If Queene and Counſell do not winke,
               the land can haue no foile.
               But thoſe that lurketh in the denne,
               and did not know the ſmart:
               I meane ſome kinde of Engliſh men,
               which beares a Spaniſh heart.
               
                  They thinke the Crowne of ioy to win,
               by treaſon and by guile:
               Againſt the Chriſtian Engliſh Queene,
               to pleaſe the Spaniards wile.
               Therefore good nobles play your part,
               defend your Queene and land:
               Againſt the Spaniards ſhewe your art,
               your force and mightie hand.
               Good Chriſtian Clergie, ſend abroad
               your preachers for to ſhowe:
               Howe bondage is a deadly rodde,
               in winters time you knowe.
               The Spaniardes make the Chriſtian ſlaue,
               and bondmen vnto thrall:
               Their heads & beards they daily ſhaue,
               which is a dreadfull fall.
               They meane with force of fiery ſword,
               your Saxon land to runne:
               They ſay it is for Chriſtes word,
               and Romaines lawes among.
               They ſweare by Chriſt, and by their beards,
               the Engliſh Queene to take:
               The Counſell and the Nobles heads,
               to make them all to quake.
               
                  The merchant and the venterers,
               with Spaniſh bragge they threate:
               The officers and the labourers,
               with fiſts they meane to beate.
               Therefore you worthy wightes,
               that paſſe the ſoutherne ſeas▪
               
               Man out your princely ſhippes,
               your foes for to diſpleaſe.
               And keepe your Engliſh coaſt,
               from Phillip King of Spaine:
               And from all thoſe that daily boaſt,
               to put you all to paine.
               I write no more, I wiſh you well,
               my minde you may well knowe:
               From captiues chaine where I do dwel,
               with bitter paynes and woe.
            
            
               
               An other preſented to her Maieſtie by Dauid Gwyn in commendation of Sir Francis Drake.
               
               O Noble knight, O worthie wight,
               O prince of nauigation:
               In martiall affaires is thy delight,
               for countries preſeruation.
               Thy noble fame like Phebus trim,
               in all the world is ſpread,
               As eclipſe the ſun and moone doth dim,
               ſo Spaniards do thee dread.
               Thy valiant actes and worthie hart,
               deſerues eternall fame:
               Thy knowledge and Aſtrologies art
               doth verifie the ſame.
               Thy happy courſe that thou didſt runne
               vnto the weſterne land.
               Did make the Spaniards all to ſhunne,
               as fearing of thy hand,
               
                  Sanda Domingo makes great mone,
               
                  Carthagena eke doth crie,
               The weſterne Iles do greatly grone,
               thy force hath bin ſo nie.
               
                  
                  Kalles likewiſe doth greatly feare,
               with reaſon thereunto.
               The narrow ſtraites do daily care,
               becauſe thou art their foe.
               Thy enterpriſe hath bin ſo high,
               that Turkes could not compare,
               Nor with his gallies come ſo nigh,
               which makes them all to feare.
               The Graund Engliſh they thee doe call
               of famous good report,
               The Spaniards and the Portingall,
               to England will reſort,
               To ſerue the Queene & thee, good Drake
               
               for thy good famous acts,
               The Spaniſh King they will forſake
               with England to compact.
               Thou art ſo dread as God is feard,
               in ſoutherne coaſt and land:
               The Spaniard daily ſhakes his beard,
               and feares thy mightie hand.
               Therefore good worthie Drake,
               
               ſerue thou thy ſoueraigne Queene,
               And make the Spaniſh foe to quake,
               and Engliſh force be ſeene.
               
                  For helpe and aide thou ſhalt not want
               thy vertuous queene is bent,
               Money and victualles is not ſcant,
               and men will not repent.
               If thou wilt follow victorie,
               as firſt thou diddeſt begin:
               All Proteſtants will pray for thee,
               and for our gracious Queene.
               The Spaniards brag and make greate boaſt
               as thou doſt partly knowe,
               A huge great fleete they make in haſte,
               as letters mine did ſhowe.
               Wherein I writ a warning good,
               to thee and to the queene,
               Rehearſing all both bad and good
               that in their fleete was ſeene.
               Alſo I wrote the ſumme of men,
               as neare as I could learne,
               And ſent it by an Engliſhman,
               whereby thou mighteſt diſcerne.
               To knowe thy foes, and what they be,
               all kind of generation:
               The dukes and earles in their degree
               rehearſed by relation,
               
                  Their ſhips and force I daily wrote,
               and all their preparation:
               To name them all I miſſed not,
               as void of deſperation.
               And thus, good noble knight,
               my ſimple verſe I ende,
               Vnto thy hand good worthie wight,
               my helpe I do commende,
               And wiſh all Engliſh chriſtian men
               to pray for me poore Gwyn,
               
               That lieth in bondage and in chaine
               with popiſh Spaniſh king.
            
            FINIS.
