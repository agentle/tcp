            ¶The prologe of Richarde Tauerner
to the reader.
            DEmosthenes the renowmed Orator
defyneth law in this wise.
The law (sayth he) is y• thing that all
men ought to obey for many skylles,
but in especial bicause law is ye inuē
               tion
& also the gifte of god, the decree
of prudēt men, ye chastisement of wilful
& vnwilfull offenses, & finally the
common suretie of a realme wherby
it becommeth al men to liue which be
conuersant in ye same. Chrysippus also
an excellēt philosopher thus beginneth
his boke of lawes. The lawe is
kinge of all aswel diuine as humane
affaires, the presidēt and comptroller
of thinges honest and dishonest, the
prince, captaine and ruler of the iuste
and iniust, & it is of ciuile-creatures
aswell the commaunder, what they
ought to do, as the forbydder, what

they ought not to do. These auntike
sayenges of wise mē assuredly ought
moch to inflame vs to the knowledge
of those thinges, wtout which we shal
be estemed no men but as brute and
sauage beastes. Let vs not commyt,
that it be sayd of vs English men, as
it was ones said of ye men of Athens,
that is, that we make very goodly &
profytable lawes, but we vse thē not.
Certainly there can be no greater reproche
to a common weale then thys.
One lesson I wolde we lerned of the
auncient lawyer Romain named Celsus,
and that is this. The knowledge
of lawes is not to beare awey ye wordꝭ
but the pyth & power of them. This
he wrote bicause there be many which
when good & holsom lawes be made,
seke not to se them executed, & obserued,
but rather how to defraude them

and to haue them vnexecuted, whiche
kinde of people after the sentence of
most ancient lawmakers be no lesse
worthy of reprehensiō thā they which
do expresly against ye law. Now, they
do (say they) against the law which do
the thing that ye law forbyddeth. And
they defraude a law or statute, which
the wordes of the law saued, do circū
               uent
the meaning and sentence of it.
Let vs thā so read the lawes, that we
may beare awey the sentence & mynd
of them, and so fulfyl and obserue the
lawes, that it maye appeare that they
were not made in vayn. Thus doing,
we shal please god, we shal be obedient
subiectes to oure
prince, and finally we
shall seke our own
weale and
sauetye.

                  THe law is the direction &
ministratiō of iustice, &
iustice is as Iustinian
sayth in hys institutions a constante & permanent
minde and will to render vnto euery
persone his right and duty. The prudencye
of lawe is a knowledge of diuine
and of humane thynges, a science
and perfyte notice of equite and
iniquitie, of rightuousnes and vnrightuousnes.
And forasmoche as a
great porcion of the prudencie or science
of the lawes of this realme consisteth
in the perfyte knowlege of estates
that men haue in landes and
tenementes: we shal first as compendiously,
and as simply and playnlye
as we can, treate of estates.
            
            
               
                  ❧ A diuision of estates.
               
                  
YE shal therfore vndersand, that
who so euer hath anye estate in
landes or tenements, either he hath
in the same onelye a chatell, or a free
holde, or an inheritaunce. Yf he hath
an estate in any landes or tenementꝭ
but for terme of certayne yeares, or
at his landlordes wyll: so is it called
a chatell, if for terme of his life or of
an other mans lyfe, it is called a free
holde, or franke tenement. And if he
hath it to hym and to hys heyres in
fee simple, or in tayle: then we saye
he hathe an estate of inheritaunce.
            
            
               
                  ❧ Tenaunte for terme
of yeares.
               TEnaunte for terme of yeres, is
he to whome landes or tenementes
be dimised and lessed for the
terme of certayne yeres, as is agreed
bitwene the landlorde & the tenaunt.

And when the lessee I meane him to
whom such lease is made doth entre
by force of the sayd lees, and is in actuall
possession of the same: than he
is called tenaunt for terme of yeres.
               And here ye shall note, that if the
lessour that made the lees hath reserued
vnto him a yerely rent vpon the
sayd lees (as it is accustomably vsed
to be done) yf the rent be behynd vnpayde,
it shalbe in his free libertie &
election either to entre and distrayne
for the rent, or to brynge an action of
dette againste him at the law for the
arreragies of the same. But in this
case it is requyred, that the lessoure
were seased of y• landes or tenemētes
at the time of the makīg of the lease,
for otherwise it shall be a good plee
in the action of dette for the tenaunt
to saye, that the lessour had nothinge

in the lande or tenement at the time
of the lease made: excepte the leas
                     •
                  
were made by dede indēted, for than
the plee shall not lye in the mouthe
of the tenaunte or lessee to plede.
               And it is to be knowne that in a
lease for terme of yeares, by dede or
without dede, there nede no lyuerye
of seasone to be made to the lesse, but
he may entre when he wyl by vertue
of his lease, wythout any further ceremonye
of lawe.
               Note also, that yf a man lesseth
landes for terme of yeares, thoughe
the lessoure chaunceth to dye before
the lessee doth entre, yet the maye entre
well ynoughe. Otherwyse it is
where as lyuerye of seasone is to be
made: as in free holdes, and in inheritaunces.
               Also yf the tenaūt for yeres doth

waste, the landlorde maye brynge an
action of waste agaynste hym, and
shall recouer the place wasted, and
his treble damages.
            
            
               Tenaunte at wyll.
               TEnaunte at wyl, is he to whom
landes or tenementes be lessed
to haue & holde the same at the wyll
of the lessoure. And in this case the
lessoure may put out his tenaunte at
what tyme hym lysteth. But yet neuertheles,
if the tenaunte haue sowed
the groundes with corne, in thys
case if the lessoure wyl entre and put
out his tenaunte before haruest, the
lawe wyll gyue hym free commynge
and going to repe and cary his corne
awaye wythout any punyshment or
dammage to be susteyned for his sodoynge
bicause he knew not at what
time the lessoure wolde entre. But

otherwise it is of the tenaunt for certeine
yeres, for if he soweth y• ground
and the terme of hys lease be come
out and expired before the corne be
type, in thys case that lessoure or he
in the reuersion maye entre and take
the corne, bycause it was the folye of
the tenaunte to sowe the grounde,
knowynge the ende of his terme.
               In lyke wyse tenaunte at wyll shall
haue free commyng and going after
the time of the lessoures entree, to carye
awaye hys housholde stuffe and
goodes for a reasonable space.
               
                  ❧ Ye shal also vnderstande, that he
that maketh a lease at wyll, maye reserue
an annuell or yearely rente, in
whiche case if the rent be behynde, he
may entre very well and distreyn the
goodes and catells of the tenaunte,
or at his election bryng an action of

dette agaynst him.
               Also it is to be knowne that tenaunt
at wyl of a mese or tenemente
is not bound by the order of lawe to
susteyne and repaire the houses that
be ruynouse, as is the tenaunte for
yeares, and therfore none action of
waste lyeth agaynst him. Yet if he do
wylful waste: as if he plucketh down
the houses, or cuttethe downe the
trees: it hath bene thought by the sages
of the lawe that the lessoure may
brynge an action of trespace against
hym and recouer hys losses therby
susteyned.
            
            
               
                  ❧ Tenaunt by copy of
courte rolle.
               THere is an other kynde of tenaunt
at wyll, whiche is called
tenaunt by copy of the courte rolles.
And this is when a man is ceased of

a maner wythin whiche, it hath bene
vsed tyme out of mynde, that the tenauntes
within the precincte of the
said maner, haue holden landes and
tenementes to them & to their heyres
in fee simple, fee tayle, or for terme of
life, at the wyll of the lorde according
to the custom of the maner. And such
a tenaunte can not aliene or sell his
land by his dede, for if he do, the lāde
or tenemente that is so aliened and
sold, is forfayted into the lordes handes,
but if he wol alien his copy hold
lande to an other, he must according
to the custome, come into the lordes
courte, and there surrender it vnto
the lordes hande, to the vse of hym
that shall haue the state. The form
                     •
                  
of which surrender is cōmonlye vsed
to be this.
               Ad hāc curiam uenit A. de A. & sursum

reddit in eadem curia unum
mesuagium. &c. in manus domini

redditus, seruitia, & consuetudines
inde prius debitas & consuetas. &c.
Et dat domino pro fine. &c. Et fecit
domino fidelitatem.
               These as I said be called tenauntes
by copye of courte rolle, bicause they
haue none other euidence to shewe
concernyng theyr landes, saue onely
the copies, of ye rolles of theyr lordes
courte.
               
                  
Neyther can these tenauntes sue or
be sued for such landes, in y• kynges
courte by wryte or otherwyse, but if
they wyll implede or sue others for
suche copye landes, they must do it
by way of playnt in the lordes court
after this sorte.

                  ❧ Nowe althoughe some suche tenauntes
haue an inheritaunce accordynge
to the custome of the maner,
yet in very dede they are but tenantꝭ
at the wyll of the lorde. For, as some

men thynke, if the lorde wyll expell
them and put them forth, they haue
no remedy at al, but to sue vnto their
lorde by weye of peticion, desyrynge
him to be good vnto thē. For if they
myght haue any remedye by the law
then shulde they not be called (saye
they) tenauntes at the wyl of the lord
after the custome of the maner. But
other men of no lesse lernynge and
prudency haue bene of contrary sentence:
as lorde Bryan chiefe iustice,
in the time of king Ed. the iiij. whose
opinion was alwayes, that if suche
tenaunt by the custome (payenge his
seruices) be eiected and put forthe by
his lorde without cause reasonable,
he maye very wel bryng and maynteyne
an action of trespace agaynste
his lord at y• cōmon law: as appereth
termino Hilarij anno. xxj. E. iij. Also

lorde Danby chiefe iustice in likewyse,
was of the same iudgement: as
appeareth Termino. Mich. anno. vii
Ed. iiij. where he saith that the tenāt
by the custome is as wel inheritable
to haue his lande after the custome,
as is he that hath a free holde at the
common law, but the determination
of this question I remit to my great
maysters, which cā solue the knottes
and enigmaes of the lawe.
               For asmoche as yet styl of this matter,
Causidici certant & adhuc subiudice
li
                        •
                      est.
               
               
                  ❧ Also ye shall vnderstand, that the
vsage of some Manour is, when the
tenaunte wyll surrender his land to
the vse of an other, that he shall take
a wande in his hande, and deliuer it
to the stewarde of the court, and the
stewarde shal deliuer the same wand

in name of seisin to him that shall
take the lande: and suche a tenaunte
is called, tenaunte by the verge. Diuerse
other customes there be of surrendryng
of copy hold landes, which
here for tediousnes I wyll omytte.
And forasmoch as tenauntes by custome
of the Manoure, haue by the
course of the common lawe no free
holde: therfore they be called tenaū
                  tes
of base tenure.
               Hytherto I haue treated of the first
membre of oure diuision, that is to
wytte, of chatelles, for as I sayde, all
leases for terme of yeres, and at will
be accōpted in the law but as cateles
and be comprysed vnder that name,
saue that they be called cateles reals
where as kyne, oxen, horses, moneye,
plate, corne, and suche lyke be called
chatell personalles. Nowe we wyll

procede to thexplaniciō of the second
membre, that is to say, of free holdes
            
            
               
                  ❧ A diuision of free holdes.
               FRee holdes or franke tenemētes
a man may haue in sūdry wyses,
for ether he is seased for terme of his
owne lyfe, or for terme of an other
mans life. Yf he be sesed for terme of
his owne life, either he haue gotten
such estate by way of purchase, or els
the law hath entiteled him therunto.
I call it by purchase, whether he commeth
vnto it by his owne barganing
and procuremēt, or by the gyft of his
frende, and I call it by the operation
and intitelynge of the lawe, whan a
man maryeth a woman that is an in
heritres, and hath issue by her, and
she dyeth, nowe shal he haue the landes
durynge his life by the course of
the lawe, and shal be called tenaunte

by the curtesye of Englande.
               In likewise, yf a man be seased in fe
                     •
                  
simple: or fee tayle of landes, and taketh
a wyfe, and he dyeth, the law giueth
vnto the wyfe the thyrde parte
of her husbandes lādes for terme of
her life, and she shal be called tenaūt
in dower.
            
            
               
                  ❧ Tenaunt for terme of life.
               TEnaunte for terme of life, is he
that holdeth landes or tenemētes
for terme of his owne life, or for
terme of an others lyfe. Howe be it
the most frequent and common maner
of speakynge is to call him that
hath estate for terme of his own life,
tenaunte for life, and him that hath
estate for terme of an others life, tenaunt
pour terme dautre vie, that is
to saye, tenaunte for terme of an others
life.
               
                  
Ye shal note, that like as he that maketh
the lease is called the lessoure, &
he to whome the lease is made is called
the lessee, so he that maketh a feffement
is called the feffoure, and he
to whome the feffement is made, the
feffee.
               Also if tenaunte for terme of lyfe, or
tenaunte for terme of an other mans
life do wast, the lessour or he in the reuersion
shall maynteyne very wel an
action of waste agaynste hym, and
shall by the same recouer treble damages.
               Finally, ye shall vnderstand that
by an acte of parliamēt made in the
xxvii. yere of oure Souerayne lorde
that now is, king Henry the eight, it
is enacted that no free holde, nor estate
of inheritance shal passe ne take
effecte but by dede indented, sealed &

enrolled in one of the kynges courtꝭ
at Westmynster, or els wythin the
same countie where the lande dothe
lye: as by the sayd acte more at large
appereth.

               TEnaunt by the curtesye of Englande,
is he that hath maryed a
wyfe inherited, and hath had issue by
her, and she is deade, in this case the
lawe of Englande permytteth and
suffreth the husbande of suche wyfe
to reteyne all his wyues landes that
she had either in fee simple, or fee
tayle so longe as he lyueth: And this
is by the curtesye and vr
                     •
                  anitie of
Englande, for this thing is vsed in
none other region.
               But in thys case it is requyred
that the chylde ve vitall, that is to

saye, be borne and broughte forth i

to this worlde aliue, and therfore the
common sayeng hath bene, that onles
the chylde be harde crye, the father
shall not be tenaunte by the curtesye,
for the onelye proue and argument
of lyfe in an infaunt new borne
is the vagite and cryenge.
               Ye shal furthermore vnderstand,
that onlesse the husbande be in actual
and reall possession of his wyues
landes, & seased of them in her right,
he shall not be tenaunte by curtesye
after her death. And therfore yf landes
descende to a mans wyfe, so that
she is tenaunt in the lawe, and to euery
mans accion, yet if the husbande
haue not made an actuall entreedurynge
the couerture and matrimony
betwene the

and iugged his foly and negligence
that he wolde not entre in her lyfe

               Otherwyse it is of aduousons,

or further ceremonye of lawe.
               Note, that if tenaunte by the curtesye
of England wyl suffre or make
any wast in the landes or tenemētes
that he so holdeth, he is punyshable
therfore by action of wast.
               Also it is to be knowne, that of
thinges that be in suspense, a man
shall not be tenaunt by the cur
                     ••
                  sye,
and therfore yf a man be the tenaunt
in fee simple of certayne lande, and
doth entremary wyth a woman that
is the seignoresse or lady of the same
and hath issue by her, and she dyeth,

yet he shal not be tenaunt by the curtesye
of the lordshyp of seignorye, bycause
himself is tenaunt of the land,
and therfore the lordeship is suspended
for the time, for a man can not be
both lorde and tenaunt of one thing
but if he had not bene tenaunt of the
lande, he shulde haue had the lordeshyp
after the deathe of his wyfe by
the curtesie of Englande very well.
            
            
               Of tenaunt in dower.
               TEnaunte in dower, is she that

                   by the lawe, so that the law calleth
him tenaunt to euery mans action,
it suffiseth for the woman to demaunde

that the negligence

                  .
               Otherwise it is, as I sayde before,
of tenaūt by the curtesy, for if landes
descende to a woman couert and the
husbande for slouthfulnes or negligence

doth not entre in his wyues life
he shal not be tenaunt by the curtesi

                     〈◊〉
                   by all lawes the wyfe oweth obedience
and subiectiō to her husbande
and therfore she can not compel him
to entre, but when landes descend to
the wyfe, the husbande onelye haue
power to entre at his pleasure.
               And ye shall vnderstand, that onlesse
the wyfe be passed the age of ix.
yeares at the tyme of her husbandes
deathe, she shall not be endowed by
the common lawe.
               But it is to be knowen that a womā
maye by diuers wayes estoppe and
preuidi
                     •
                  e her selfe of her dower: as if
she commyt any crime for which she
is atteynted of treasone, murdre or felonye, 
                     •
                  he gett
                     ••
                  no dower, not wythstandyng
she hath obteyned her pardone.
               
                  
Also yf after the deathe of her
husband she taketh a lease for terme
of lyfe of the same landes wherof she
is indowable she losed her dower of
the same. Moreouer yf she departethe
from her husbande and lyuethe
in aduoutrye wyth an other man,
and not reconcieled agayne to her
husbande wythout coercion of the
ecclesiasticall power, she lesethe her
dower after her husbandes deathe.
               She shall be also barred of dower
yf she wyll wythholde from the heire
the charters and euidence concernynge
that lande wherof she asketh
dower: But none other saue the
heyre can wytholde her dower for
thys cause.
               It maye not be vnknowne also of
what thynges she maye demaunde

dower, and of what thinges not. Of
landes messuagies, aduousons, rent
charges, rente seruyses, or signories
in grosse or otherwyse, of villaynes,
of cōmons certayne, of estouers, certayne,
she is dowable. But of commons,
and estouers sans nombre, also
of annuities, of homage, of thingꝭ
of pleasure, as of seruyces of paimet
of roses, and semblable she shall not
be endowed.
               There be yet two other kindes of
dower, the one is called dowment ex
assēsu patr
                     •
                  is, and the other is called
dowment de la plus beale ꝑtie.
that is to saye, of the fairest parte.
               Dowment ex assensu patris, is
whan the father is seased of landes
in fee, and his sonne whiche is heyre
apparaunt endoweth his wife at the
churche dore, whan he is espoused, of

parcell of hys fathers landes, wyth
the assente of his father in wrytinge
testifienge the same assent, if in thys
case her husband dye, she may forthwyth
entre into the laudes so assigned
vnto her wtout further app
                     •
                  yntynge
or proces of law, although the
father of her husbande be yet aliue &
in actual possession of the lande. But
if she thus do, and take her to thys
endowment at the churche dore she
can not haue her dower by the common
lawe of the thyrde parte of all
her husbandes landes, or any parcell
of them how be it if she wyll refuse
this assignement made vnto her at
the church dore, and demaund dower
at the common lawe, she maye verye
well.
               A man maye also endow his wyfe at
the time of the spousailes of his own

landes, whiche he hath in his owne
possession, and that dower is called
dower ad ostium ecclesiae
               
               Dowment Dela plus beale, that
is to saye, dowmente of the fayreste
parte shall be in thys case. Whan
a man is seased of landes whiche he
holdethe of an other man by knyghtes
seruice, and of other lādes which
be of socage tenure, and hathe issue,
whyche is wythin the age of .xiiij.
yeares & dye, and the lorde of whom
the lande is holden by knyghtes seruyce
entrethe in to the lande holden
of hym, and the mother of the chylde
entrethe in to the socage tenure as
gardeyne in socage, yf in thys case
the woman wyll brynge a wrytte of
dower agaynste the lorde whyche is
gardeyne in cheualrye, he may plede
the speciall mater and shewe, howe

she as gardeyne in socage hath so
moche lande and pray the court that
she maye be suffred to endowe her
selfe of so moche lande beynge in her
owne custodie, as amounteth to the
thyrde parte of the hole landes. And
than the iudgemente shall be, that
the gardeyne in chyualrye shall reteyne
the lande holden of hym quyte
from the woman duerynge the non
age of the warde. After which iudgement
she maye go and in presence of
her neighboures endowe her selfe of
the beste parte of that whyche is in
her custodye, amountynge to the
thyrde parte of the hole, and than is
she called tenaunte in dower de la
plus beale.
               
            
            
               A diuision of inheritaunces.
               
                  
HYtherunto I haue spoken of
free holdes, nowe, it remayneth
to treate of inheritaūces, not that inheritaūces
be no free holdes, for they
be free holdes also, but the other estates
of whiche I haue here tofore
treated be onely free holde, and of no
hygher nature, where as a state of in
heritance, although it 
                     •
                  e a free hold,
yet it is not to be called by yt name,
sythe it is a farre more excellent and
greater estate. But ye shall vnderstande
that of inheritaunces some be
of more amplitude and excellencye
than other some be, as that inheritaunce
whyche is pure, simple, and
without limitacion of what heyres,
is it called fee simple. But when I
make a limitaciō of what heyres, thā
is it called fee tayle, of which also be
two sortes, as herafter more at large

shal be declared. Nowe the nature of
fee simple is to be setforth wyth oure
accustomed compendiousnes.
            
            
               Fee simple.
               FEe simple is (as I sayd) the most
ample & large inheritaunce that
can be in this realme diuised or excogi
                     •
                  ate,
as that whiche a man hath to
hym and to his heyres simply without
any further limitacion, for whether
they be of his owne bodye begot
ten or not, so that they be the next of
his kinne, and wythin the degrees it
suffiseth.
               So then tenaunte in fee simple is he
that hath landes or tenementes (whether
it be by purchase or by discent)
to him & to his heires for euer. For if
a man will purchase landes in fee
simple, he must nedes haue these wordes,
his heyres, in his purchase, for

these be the onlye wordes that make
an estate of inheritaunce. Therfore
yf landes be gyuen to a man for euer
& no mencion be made of his heyres:
he hath an estate but for terme of his
lyfe, bycause these wordes (his heyres)
do lacke.
               Yet neuertheles, if a mā by his testament
doth deuise landes to an other
in suche where the custome wyl serue
so to do, though he maketh no mencion
of heyres, but saythe that he bequethethe
to suche a personne such
                     •
                  
landes, to haue & to hold to him and
to his assignes for euermore: here a
state of inheritaūce doth passe, for in
testamentes the wil and intent of the
testaour is to be pondred, & not the
formal & prescripte wordes of y• law.
               Also these termes in the lawe,
franke mariage, and franke almo
                     •
                  e

that is to saye, free mariage and free
almose do include in them wordes of
inheritaunce. And therfore if I giue
landes to a man wyth my daughter
in franke mariage wythout further
addicion or mēcion of heires, this is
an estate of inheritaunce, as we shal
hereafter declare more plentiouslye.
In likewyse it is of landes giuen to
an house ecclesiastical in pure & frāk
almes. Moreouer if landes be giuen
to a mā & to his blode, or to him & to
his seed, he hath in both cases a state
of inheritaūce for in y• one he hath a
fee taile, & in thother a fe simple. For
this word seed, and bloud, and suche
lyke do implye wordes of inheritāce.
               But nowe it is to be sene who be
sayde a mannes heyres in the lawe.
Ye shall therfore knowe, that my
brother or syster by the halfe bloude,

that is to wytte, by the fathers syde,
and not by the mothers, or contrary
wyse by the mothers and not by the
fathers, shall neuer be myne heyre,
nor none that come of them.
               Neither my bastarde can be myne
heyre, nor myne owne naturall father
ne mother, nor grandefather ne
grandmother can be myne heyre.
               For it is a principle and grounde in
the lawe, that inheritaunce may linially
descend, but ascende it may not.
And therfore if I haue landes in fee
simple and dye wythout issue of my
bodye, my father can not be myne
heire, but my fathers brother or syster
shal, and then if my vncle or aunt
dye seased wythout issue, my father
shal haue the landes as heir to myne
vncle or to my aunte, but heyre to me
he can not be. But it maye go from

me to myne vncle or aunte well ynoughe,
for that is not called a linial
ascension but a collatrall.
               And ye shal note, that by the commō
lawe of this realme, my eldest sonne
shall haue the hole inheritaunce, and
after hym if he hathe no issue, the seconde
sonne, and so forth. And if I
haue no sonnes but daughters, than
shal al the daughters togither inherite,
if I haue no issue at all, neither
son
                     •
                  es ne daughters, than shall my
eldest brother in heritage succede me
but if I haue no brother, than my
systers if I haue any, if not my vncle
by my fathers syde, if the landes be
of myne owne purchase. And to be
shorte if there be none in lyfe of my
fathers syde, it shall goo to my mothers
syde, and if there can be found
no heyre neither by fathers syde ne

yet by mothers, then shall it reuerte
and eschete (as they call it) to the lord
of whome it was holden, for euerye
lande must nedes be holden of some
lorde, as shall be here after shewed.
But if landes descende vnto me by
my mothers syde, than if I fayle of
issue, the landes shall descende onely
to my heyres of my mothers syde, &
neuer to myne heyres of my fathers
syde: as on the contrarye syde, yf I
haue landes or any hereditamentes
by discēt frō my father or his blode,
they shal neuer descend to my heires
by my mothers syde.
               Thus ye se a greate difference in
this behalfe, bitwene purchased landes
and landes which descende from
my auncestoure.
               Yf there be thre sonnes, and the
myddell sonne purchaseth landes &

dye wythout issue, the heldeste shall
haue the lādes and not the yongest.
               Also it is a principle in oure law,
that none can be myne heyre of landꝭ
that I holde in fee simple, onles he
be myne heyre by the hole blode that
is to say, both by father and mother,
for if a man hathe issue two or thre
sonnes by sondry wyues, and the eldest
purchaseth landes in fee and dyeth
wythout issue, his halfe brethren
I meane those yt be not his brethren
bothe by the fathers syde & mothers
syde shall not haue the lande, but it
shall go to his vncle. Lykewyse if a
man hath by his fyrste wyfe a sonne
and a daughter, and by his seconde
wyfe an other sonne, and the sonne
by the fyrst wyfe purchaseth landes
in fee, and dyethe wythout issue: the
syster german shall haue the landes

by discēt as heyre to her brother, and
not to the yōger brother. Otherwise
it is of landes or other hereditamētꝭ
entailed as shalbe herafter specified.
               Also if a man be seised of landes
in fee simple, and hathe issue a sonne
and daughter by one wyfe, and afterwarde
a sonne by an other, and dyeth,
and the eldest sonne entreth in to
the landes, and after dyeth wythout
lawfull issue of his body, the daughter
shall haue the landes and not the
yongest sonne, and yet the yongest
sonne is heyre to his father, but he is
not so to his brother. But if in thys
case the eldeste sonne had not entred
after the death of his father but had
died before any entre made by hym,
than shal not the syster germaine entre
but the yonger brother is heire to
his father, bicause the eldest brother

was neuer in actuall possessiō, which
is requisyte to yt personne that claymeth
to be heyre collaterallye. But
to the lyniall heyres, it suffiseth that
the auncestour shuld haue bene heyr
yf he had liued, I meane as thus. A
man is seased of landes and hath issue,
a sonne & daughter by one wyfe,
and afterwarde a sonne by an other,
he dyethe, the eldeste sonne entrethe
not, but dyeth wythout issue before
he can make any actuall entree, hys
syster shall not haue the landes as
heyre to her brother, bycause her brother
was neuer actually possessed,
but y• yōger brother shall haue them
as heyre to his father. Yet if theldest
sonne in that case had lefte behynde
him issue of his body, whether it had
bene sōne or daughter, this issue not
wythstandyng that the father of the

issue was neuer possessed either actually,
or in ye law, shal haue the lādes,
and shal conuey his discent from his
father, for the sonne or daughter is
linial heyre, where as the brother, sister,
vncle, aunt. &c. be heyres collaterall,
and so obserue a dyuersitie.
               I call an actuall possession, whan
a man entreth in dede in to landes to
him descēded, but a possessiō in lawe,
is called when landes be descended
to a persone, ann he hath not yet real
ly and actually ētred in to them. For
notwythstandydge that he is not in
actuall possession yet he is possessed
in the lawe, that is to say, in the eye &
consyderation of the law, for asmuch
as he is tenaunt to euery mans action
that wyll sue for the sayd landes,
for els there shulde insue an intollerable
inconuenience, as we shal more

copyously open in an other place.
               Ye shall vnderstande that thys
worde inheritaunce is not onelye to
be accommodate and applied to that
whyche commeth by discente from a
mannes auncestours: but also to euery
purchase in fee simple, or fee taile.
            
            
               Fee tayle.
               Ye shall vnderstande, that before
a certayne statute called the statute
of Westminster seconde, there
was no state tayle, but all was fee
simple, eyther purely that is to saye,
wythout condition or condicinallye:
as appereth by the pretence of y• said
statute, but now sythens the promulgating
of that statute diuers formes
of state tayles haue rysen.
               Fee tayle is whan it is prescribed
and lymytted in the gifte, what heyres
and by whome engendred shall

inherite. As for exemple I gyue landes
to a man and to his heyres and
go no further, this is fee simple: but
if I make a limitation, and adde of
his hody begotten, now is it fee taile
that is to saye, a fee or inheritaunce
limitted, prescribed, determinate, or
assigned. So that if I gyue landes
to a man and to his heyres, he hathe
fee simple, but yf I gyue landes to
hym and to hys heyres of hys bodye
lawfully begotten, he hathe but a fee
tayle, for asmoche as I appoynte, lymytte,
prescribe and determyne the
heyres, and for lacke of suche heyres
the gyfte shall be expired and worne
out, & the landes shall reuerte agayn
to the gyuer or his heyres.
               But ye muste obserue that there
bo two kyndes of fee tayle. There is
a generall tayle, and there is a speciall

tayle. Fee tayle generall is as
where landes be giuen to a man and
to his heyres of his bodye begotten,
without anye mencyonynge and expressynge
by what woman they are
to be begotten. And therefore yfa mā
be tenaunte in the generall tayle of
landes, and taketh a wyfe and hathe
issue by her, and she dyeth and afterwarde
he takethe an other wyfe, of
whom he hath also other issue, here
either of these issue is inheritable to
this land entayled. But if I expresse
in the gifte by what womā the heires
shall be procreate and ingēdred, then
is it an especiall tayle, as for exemple
to make the thynge playne, if landes
be gyuen to a man and to the heyres
of his body lawfully begotten by Katherin
his wyfe, this is an especiall
tayle, for the issue of him begotten by

an other woman, shal neuer inherite
by force & vertue of the tayle. Lykewyse
it is, if landes be giuen to a woman
and to y• heires of her body law
fully begotten (& shewe not by what
man) this is a general taile, but if I
adde & saye by suche a man her husbande,
than is it an especiall taylle.
               Also yf I gyue landes to a man
and to hys wyfe, and to the heyres
of there two bodyes lawfully begotten:
thys ys an especyal tayle, as wel
in the husbande as in the wyfe,
               Semblably it is, yf a man gyueth
landes to an other man wyth hys
daughter or kynswoman in francke
mariage, thys emplyeth a state tayle
especiall, and in thys case as wel the
man as the woman hathe estate in
in the speciall tayle.
               But yf I gyue landes to a man

and to suche a woman, and to hys
heyres that he shall begette of her:
here the woman hathe estate but for
terme of her lyfe, and the husbands
an estate in the especyall tayle. In
lykewise it is on the womās behalfe,
as if I gyue landes to a man and to
hys wyfe, and to her heyres of the bodye
of her said husbande engendred,
he hathe an estate but for terme of
lyfe, and she an estate in the specyall
tayle. But in bothe cases, yf I hadde
sayde to the heyres and not hys or
her heyres, than shulde eyther of
them haue hadde an estate in the specyall
tayle, bycause thys worde heytes
is as well referred to the one as
to the other.
               Ye shall also vnderstande, that yf
landes be giuen to a man, ond to the
heyres males of his bodye, this ys a

state tayle, and in this case the heyre
femalle shall neuer inherite.
               Finally it is to be noted, that of
landes whych a man hath in fee simple,
the possession of the brother shall
cause the syster germayne that is to
saye, the syster bothe by the fathers
syde & mothers, to inherite, and not
the brother by the halfe blod, as here
tofore was said, but of landes which
be entayled otherwise it is. Therfore
if a man be seysed of landes in the
generall tayle, and hath issue by hys
furst wyfe, a sonne and a daughter,
and also a sonne by an other wyfe, &
dyeth, and the eldest sonne entreth in
to the landes & after dyeth, the suster
germayne shall not haue the landes
but the yonger brother of the halfe
blode, bycause whosoeuer shall inherite
landes in taile, must claym them

as nexte and immediate heyre, not to
hym that dyeth last seased of ye landꝭ;
but to hym vnto whome the landes
were fyrst gyuen, whyche in the case
before remembred, is the sonne and
not the daughter.
               Thus ye shal marke obserue a great
diuersitie bytwene the forme of successyon
in landes of fee simple, and
the forme in fee tayle.
            
            
               Tenaunt after possibilitie
of issue extincte.
               WHan landes or tenementes be
giuen to a mā and to his wife,
and to the heires of there two bodies
lawfully begotten, yf in thys case either
of them chaunce to dye before
they haue issue betwene them, he or
she that ouerlyueth hys styl tenaunt
in tayle, but wythout all possibilitie
of any issue that can be heyre to these

landes entayled, and for thys cause
he or she thus ouerlyuynge is called
tenaunte after possibilitie of issue extincte,
for in suche a tenaunte is all
possibilitie of issue that maye be inherytable
to these landes by force of
the gyfte in tayle vtterlye extincte
and quenched, and by his or her deth
the state tayle shall expyre, cease, and
be abolyshed for euer and shall reuerte
agayn to the gyuer or donoure
from whence it came.
               Yet forasmoche as thys tenaunt
after possibilitie of issue, hadde ones
an inheritaunce in hym, he shall not
be punyshede by an action of waste,
though he makethe neuer so moche
waste in the landes and tenementes,
whereas yet in effecte he is but a tenaunte
for terme of lyfe.
            
            
               Of perceners.
               
                  
Hitherunto I haue made a compendious
and short declaracyon
of estates of al sortes. But where
I sayde that among susters there is
no prerogatyue or preminence concernyng
the inheriting of theyr auncestoures
landes, but that they shall
be al togither inheritours, and make
as it were but one heyre: it is expedient
to make a further processe in this
behalfe, and to shew howe & in what
maner this partition shall be made.
               But ye shall vnderstande that
there be besyde parceners at the common
lawe, whyche be onelye susters,
also parciners by custome, whiche is
amonges brothers contrarye to the
course of the common lawe, and this
custome is in Kent, and in other places
where landes and tenemētes be
of the tenure of Gauel kynde.
               
                  
Ye shall thefore knowe y• whan a mā
is seised of landes in fee simple or see
tayle, and hath no issue but doughters,
and die, and the doughters do
enter in to the landes thus descēded
vnto them, nowe they be called parceners,
or coheyres, & by a wryt called,
De ꝑtitione facienda brought by on
of them agaynst the others, they shal
be constrayned by the lawe to suffre
an egall particion to be made of the
landes bytwene them.
               Nowe partycion maye be made
in sundrye wayes. One waye is whā
they them selues do make particion
bytwene them of the hole herytage
and do agree vnto the same and entre
euery one in to her parte so alotted
vnto her.
               An other is whan by all theyre
agremente an consente one common

frende do make the particion. In
whych case the eldest syster shal haue
the fyrst election, and after her the seconde
suster, and so forth. But if they
agree that theldest suster shall make
the particion, and she maketh it, then
theldest shal not chuse fyrst, but shall
suffer all her susters to chose before
her, as it is thought.
               There is also an other forme of
particion, whiche is egally to diuide
the landes into so manye partes as
there be coheires or parciners, and to
wryte euery parte so diuided in a seuerall
scroule of paper, and to putte
the sayde scroulles in to a bonette, or
to enclose them seuerally in balles of
waxe, and than the eldeste suster to
chuse whyche balle she wyt, or to put
her hande in to the bonet and to take
a scroule, & to holde her to her chaūce

and allotment, and so consequentlye
euery suster after other.
               And ye shall note, that particion
by agrement maye as well be made
by nude and bare wordes wythout
wrytynge as by wrytynge.
               That yf any of the parceners wil
not suffre any particion to be made
than may the other that wolde haue
partition, purchase a write called De
partitione facienda agaynste them
that refuse partition, to compell the
same to suffer partition to be made
accordyngly, and than by the iudgement
of the courte the sheryfe by the
seremente of twelue men shall make
particion bytwene them, and shal assigne
to eche suster her porcion, as he
shall thynke good, wythout gyuyng
anye election to the eldeste.
               And if two Manours of meeses

descende to two susters, and the maners
be not of egall value, than may
she, to whom the lesse maner is allotted,
haue assigned vnto her a rente
proportionably out of the others maner.
               Finally, ye shall vnderstande, that if
a man be seased of landes in fee semple,
& hath issue two daughters, and
giueth wyth one of his daughters to
an other man that is to mary her the
thirde or fourth parte of his lande in
franke mariage, and dyeth, if in thys
case the daughter that is in this wise
auaunced, wyll haue her porcyon of
her fathers heritage, she muste putte
her lande gyuen vnto her in francke
mariage in hochepot newe agayne.
I meane she must be contēted to suffer
her sayde landes to be commixte
and mengled wyth the other landes

of whyche her father dyed seased in
fee simple, so that an equall diuision
maye be made of the hole, or elles she
shall haue no parte of those landes,
of which her father died seased. But
if her father had made vnto her but
a common gifte in taile, or a feffemēt
in fee, she shulde not nede to put her
landes in hochepot, but may retayne
them styl, & also haue as good a part
of the rest of the landes of which her
father dyed seased, as her other sister
or sisters. For a gyfte in francke maryage,
is accompted the moste free or
moste liberall gyfte that can be, and
that whyche the lawe iudgethe to be
onelye for the aduauncement and be
stowynge of the daughter, where as
feffementes in fee and also common
giftes in taile be accustomably for other
causes, and for the aduauntage

rather of the gyuour, or feffour then
of the taker.
            
            
               Of condicions.
               FOrasmoche as euery estate is either
pure, or condicionall, it were
not amysse somwhat to make a declaration
of the nature and efficacye of
condicions. Wherfore ye shal vnder
stande that of condicions, some be actuall
condicions, & be called expresse
condicions or cōdicions in dede, and
other some be cōdiciōs in law whych
be called also in latine, Condiciones
tacitae, siue condiciones implicitae,
bycause they be secretely implyed by
the lawe and not expressed.
               Condicions in dede be such as be
knyt and annexed by expresse wordꝭ
to the feffemente lease or graunter either
in writing or without, as for exē
                  ple

if I infeffe a man in certayne landes
reseruynge to me & to my heires
so moche rente yerlye to be payde at
suche a feast, and for defaute of payment,
that it shalbe lawfull for me to
reentre, thys is a feffement vpon condicion
of paymente. For the not payment
of the rent shal dissolue the fefment.
Semblably it is of gyftes in
tayle, leases. &c.
               But yf the condicion be, that for defaulte
of paymente of the rent, it shal
be lawfull for the feffoure to entre agayne
in to the landes, and to holde
them tyll he be satisfied of the rente,
this condition not performed dothe
not dissolue the feffement, but only
gyueth to ye feffour an authorytie to
reteine the landes (as it were by way
of distresse) tyll he hath leuyed the arr
                     •
                  ragyes
of the rent.
               
                  
And ye shall obserue, that condicions
be somtyme made to be performed
on the feffees behalfe, and somtyme
on the feffours behalfe.
               On the feffees behalfe, as whan I
infeffe you of landes vpon cōdicion
that ye shall do suche an acte, as to
pay vnto me or to myne heyres such
annuall rent.
               On the feffours behalfe, as whā
I make a feffement vnto you vpon
cōdicion that yf I pay or cause to be
payde vnto you before suche a daye
suche a somme of money, than it shal
be lawfull for me to entre agayne &
retein my landes in my former estate
In this case ye that be the feffee, are
called tenaunt in morgage, which is
as moch to saye as a dede gage, and
it semethe that the cause why it is so
called, is for asmoche as it is doubtfull

whether the feffoure wyll pay at
the daye prescribed suche somme of
monye for the redemption of hys landes
or no, for if he do not, his title or
intresse in the landes thus gaged, &
oppignorated is vtterly extinct with
out all hope of renuynge.
               Ye shall note that yf the morgageoure
dyeth before the daye of payment,
hys heyre maye redeme the lād
very well euen as well as his auncestoure
that morgaged the land might
haue done although there be no mencion
made of heyres in the wrytinge.
               And yf whan the monye is lawfully
by the morgageour or his heire
profered, and the feffee refuseth to receyue
the same, the feffoure or hys
heyre maye entre, and then hath the
feffee no remedy for his mony at the
common lawe.
               
                  
Ye shal vnderstād also that some
condicions be vtterlye voyde in the
lawe, and of none efficacy or strēgth,
as if a feffement be made of landes
in fee simple vpon condiciō that the
feffee shal not alien or put awey this
same to none other, this condicion I
saye is voyde, bycause the feffee is restrayned
of hys hole poure that the
lawe giueth in suche case vnto hym,
and whyche power and libertie, is in
maner included in euery feffement.
Yet I maye abbrydge hym of parte
of his powre, as to condicion wyth
hym that he shal not aliene the landꝭ
to suche a personne or suche. But of
gyftes in tayle other wyse it is, for yf
I gyue landes to a man and to the
heyres of his body lawfully begottē
vpon condiciō that he nor his heires
shall aliene the landes to none other

persone, this condicion is good and
effectuall in the lawe, and if he or his
heyres contrary to the condicion do
aliene them, than the gyuer or hys
heyres maye very well entre and reteyne
the lādes for euer, bicause this
condicion doth stande wyth the forenamed
statute of Westm̄ seconde
whyche prohibiteth suche alienaciōs
to be made.
               Hitherunto I haue spoken of condicions
in dede, now will I shew what
be condicions in lawe that be annexed
to any estates.
               Knowe ye therfore, that if the office
of a parker, or stewarde, or suche
lyke office be graunted to a man for
terme of his lyfe, though there be no
cōdicion at al mēcioned in the graūt,
yet the lawe speaketh a condicion in
thys case, whiche is that yf the partye

to whome suche offyce is gyuen
shall not execute all poyntes apperteynynge
vnto hys office accordingly,
it shalbe lawfull for the graūtour
to entre and dyscharge hym of hys
offyce and thys condicion is called a
condicion in lawe.
            
            
               Of lyuery of season, and
of atturnement.
               IN al feffemētes, giftes in tayle leeses
for terme of lyfe, or for terme
of an others lyfe of landes or tenementes,
there can be no alteration or
transmutacion of possession by the
aunciente lawes of thys realme, on
lesse there be a certayne cerimonye
adhibited and solempnised in the presence
and syght of neyghbours or others,
whych ceremony is called liuerye
of seasone.
               
                  
And ye shal vnderstand, that this
ceremonye of lyuerye of seasone is
done, whan the feffoure, donour, lessoure
or theyr deputy come wyth the
neighboures solemply to the landes
or tenementes, and there put the feffee
donee or lessee in possession of the
said landes or tenementes by deliuering
vnto him a clod of earth, or the
ring of the dore, orsome other thyng
in the name of seasone, & for this self
cause this ceremonye of lawe is called
lyuerye of seasone, that is to witt
a tradicion or gyuynge of seasone.
               But this ceremony is not required
in lessees for terme of yeares, or
in leeses at wyll, in as moche as the
lessoure in suche case remaineth styll
seased, and the lessee hath onelye the
possession wythout the seasine and

                     〈◊〉
                   the termes of the lawe be,

that suche a man is possessed, where
as in feffementes, giftes in taile, and
leeses for lyfe, he is called seased.
               Wherfore yf a feffemente or lees
for life be made of lādes or tenemēts
and before that the liuery of seasine
be made the feffoure dyeth, the heyr
of the feffoure shall haue the landes
per summum ius, yt is to lay by the rigoure
of the lawe, notwithstandyng
that the feffee hath payde to the feffour
the price of the land, & although
the feffee be in possession. But otherwise
it is of a lese for terme of yeres.
               I lyke ceremonye is vsed whan
rente charges, whan rente seruyces,
and suche other thynges as passe by
wey of graunt, be graunted, for it is
no full and perfyte graunt tyll it be
consygnate as it were wyth the ceremonye
of atturnement.
               
                  
This atturnemente is nothynge
elles, but whan the tenaunte of the
land of which the reuersion is graū
                  ted,
or out of whyche a rente is graū
                  ted,
do make some euident signification
and token that he accepteth the
persone to whom the graūt is made
to be in the same respecte vnto hym
that the grauntoure was. As for an
exemple if the tenaunte of the lande
after he haue herde of the graunt cō
                  meth
to the grauntee, that is to wyt,
to the persone to whom the graunte
was made, and saye in thys wyse, or
in lyke effecte.
               I agree me to the graunte made
vnto you by suche a man, or I am
well a payde and contented of the
graunt that suche a man hath made
vnto you. But the moste vsuall and
frequent forme of atturnement is to

saye: Syr I atturne vnto you by
force of the said graunt, or I become
your tenaunt, or to delyuer vnto the
grauntee a penye or a halfe penye by
waye of atturnemente.
               Yf a man maketh fyrst one graūt
to one persone, and after an other to
ane other persone, that graunte shal
stande to whyche the tenaunte wyll
atturne, althoughe it be the latter.
               And ye shal note, that if a man be
seased of a Manoure whyche is percell
in demene, and percell in seruice,
and doth aliene the same Manoure
to an other, onlesse the tenauntes of
the Manoure do atturne, the seruices
shal not passe only tenauntes at
wyll excepted for it nedethe not to
cause them to atturne.
               Note furthermore that there is a
greate difference bytwene giuynge a

penye in name of seasin, and gyuyng
it by waye of atturnement, for whan
it is gyuen of the tenaunt to y• graū
                  tee
in name of seasin, it dothe not only
implye an atturnement, but also it
gyueth him suche a seasin, that if the
rente afterwarde be behinde and not
payd, he may now vppon y• seasin of
the penye, after a lawfull distres and
after rescus made, brynge an assyce
of nouel disseasin, where as if it were
gyuen only by waye of atturnement
he coulde not brynge the assyse, but
hys wryt of rescus onely.
               Also ye shall vnderstande, that wher
landes be deuisable by testamente
by the custome of any auncyent boroughe
or cyty, yf there the reuersion
of any landes be by testament bequethed
to a man in fee, and testatour
which we call the dyuysour dyeth y•
                  
deuisee, that is to wytte, he to whom
the deuise was made hath forthwt y•
reuersion in hym wythout further ceremonye
of atturnement. Lykewyse
it is if a man by testament dothe bequeth
a rent charge that he is seased
of, or a rēt seruice, there nedethe none
atturnement at all.
               Yf two ioyntenauntes be of land
and the lorde graunteth the seruyces
to an other, if one of y• ioynte
                     •
                  aū
                  
                     •
                  ēs
atturneth it is ynoughe. Finally, if a
lease be made for terme of lyfe, the remayndre
to an other in tayle, the remayndre
ouer to the ryght heyres of
the tenaūt for terme of lyfe, if in this
case the tenaūt for terme of lyfe wyll
graunte hys remayndre in fee to an
other by hys dede, thys remayndre
passeth forthwyth without any atturnement,
for if any atturnement were

requisite, it shulde be made of the tenaūt
for terme of life, whyche in this
case is the grauntour hym selfe. And
in vayne it is that the grauntoure
shulde be enforced to atturne, sith an
atturnement is adhibited to none other
purpose than to haue the consēt
and agremente of the particular tenaunte,
to the intent that it may appere,
that he hath notice or knowlege
of this graūte, but here where as the
particular tenaunte hymselfe is the
grauntour, an atturnement were superfluous,
and more than neded.
            
            
               Of seruices.
               HYtherunto I haue brefely touched
and ouerrun the sundrye
kyndes and formes of estates. Now
forasmoch as there is no tenure, but
hathe vnto it some seruice knyt and
annexed, it were very necessary to declare

howe many kyndes of seruices
there be, and what seruyce is due to
euery tenure. For the knowledge her
of ye shal vnderstande, that the principall
and moste common kynde of
seruyce that the tenaūt oweth to hys
lorde, is called knyghtes seruyce.
            
            
               Knyghtes seruice.
               KNyghtes seruice includeth homage,
fealeie and for moste ꝑte
escuage, and whosoeuer holdeth his
lādes by knyghtes seruice, is bound
by the law of this realme to do vnto
his lorde homage and fealtie, and to
paye for most parte escuage, when it
shal be assesed by authoritie of parliamente
as hereafter more playnlye
shalbe declared vnto you.
               Homage is the most hūble and reuerent
seruice that a man of free condition
can do, for whan the tenaunte

shall do homage to his lord, the lord
shal sytte, and the tenaunt shal knele
before hym vpon bothe knees, and
shall holde his handes bitwene hys
lordes handes, and saye in this wise,
I become your man from this daye
forthward of life and of membre and
of earthly honoure, and to you shall
be faythfull and loyall, and faithe to
you shall beare for the landes that I
clayme to holde of you, sauynge the
faythe that I beare vnto oure soueraigne
lorde the kynge, and than the
lorde so syttynge shal kysse him. But
if an ecclesiasticall persone whych by
hys ordre and profession hath addicted
himselfe to the seruice of god in
especiall shall do homage to his lord
he shall not say: I become your man
bycause he hath professed himselfe to
be the onely man of god: but shal say

I do to you homage, and shall be to
you faythfull and true, and fayth to
you shall beare for the tenementes y•
I holde of you, sauynge the faythe
whyche I do owe to our soueraygne
lorde the kynge.
               Ye shal note also, that when a woman
not maried doth homage to her
lord, she shal not say: I become your
woman, for it is not conuenient that
a woman shulde be the woman of any
other than of her husbande that
she shall mary, but she shal saye euen
as the ecclesiasticall persone sayeth:
I do vnto you homage. &c.
               That yf perchaunce a man holdeth
sundry landes and tenementes
of sundrye lordes, and euery of them
by knyghtes seruice, than in the ende
of his homage makinge, he shal say,
sauynge the fayth that I owe to our

soueraygne lorde the kynge, and to
myne other lordes.
               And it is to be knoewn, that none
is bounde to do homage to the lord,
onles it be suche a tenaunte as hath
in the tenauncye an estate of fee simple,
or fee tayle, eyther in hys owne
ryght, or in the ryght of an other.
               For if a woman haue landes or tenementes
in fee simple or fee tayle,
whyche she holdethe of her lorde by
knyghtes seruice, and taketh an husbande
and haue issue, in this case the
husbande in the lyfe of his wyfe shal
do the homage, bycause he hath a title
to haue the landes by the curtesy
of Englande yf he ouerlyueth her, &
also he holdeth them nowe in his wiues
ryghte, yet before issue had bytwene
them, y• homage shal be made
in theyr both names. But if the woman

dieth before any homage made
by her husbande in her lyfe, and the
husbande kepeth styll the landes as
tenaunt by the curtesye, now he shall
not do homage to hys lorde bycause
he hath nowe an estate but for terme
of lyfe.
               Fealtie is as moche to saye as a
fidelitie or faythefulnes, in doynge
wherof the tenaunte shall holde hys
hand vpon a boke, & say thus, Heare
you this my lorde, I to you shall be
faythfull and true, and fayth to you
shall beare for the landes and tenementes
whyche I clayme to holde of
you, and duelye shall do you the customes
and seruices whiche I owe to
do you at the termes assigned, as me
helpethe god and hys sayntes. And
than he shall kysse the boke, but he
shal not knele as he ye doth homage.
               
                  
And ye shal obserue that homage
can not be done but to the lorde hym
self, where as ye steward of the lordes
courte or the bailife may take fealtie
for the lorde. Also tenaunte for terme
of life shal do fealte, but homage (as
is sayde) he can not do.
               Nowe as concernynge escuage
that is to saye, the seruice of the shild
ye shal vnderstand, that he that holdeth
his lādes by escuage, whan the
kynge makethe a viage royall in to
Scotlande for the subduynge of the
Scottes, is bounde to be wythe the
Kinges Maiestye by the space of .xl.
dayes well and conuenientlye arayed
and appointed for the warre. And
he that holdeth his lande but by the
moitie of the fee of knightes seruice,
is bounde by the force of his tenure
to be wyth the kynge by the space of

xx. dayes, and so proporcionably accordyng
to the rate and quantitte of
hys tenure.
               But now to our institute and purpose,
after thys viage royall in to
Scotlande (in whyche the kynge goeth
in persone) and after the retyre in
to Englande agayne, a parliamente
is wont to be sommoned, in whyche
shal be prescribed & asseised what euerye
persone that helde hys lande by
homage and went not wyth the king
neither by hymselfe, nor by his deputye,
shall paye to hys lorde in satisfaction
of his not seruynge, and accordynge
to the taxacion herof, euery tenaunte
shall paye to hys immediate
lorde, whether it be the kyng or other
after the rate and porcion of hys tenure,
if he holdeth by an hoole fee, he
shall paye the hoole escuage, if by a

moitie, the halfe, yf by the fourth ꝑte
of a fee, the fourth parte. &c. and this
money thus asseysed, is called scurage
or escuage, for whyche the lorde
to whome it is due, maye verye well
for the non paymēt therof distreyne.
               But here it is to be noted, yt some
tenaūtes by custom vsed tyme out of
mynde are bound to pay but the moitie,
or the thyrde parte of that which
shall be asseised and limited by acte
of parliament.
               Yea, and the custome is in some
place, that to what somme of money
so euer escuage is asseised, y• tenaūtꝭ
shall paye neuer but such a certeyne
somme of mony, and this escuage is
called escuage certeyne, where as the
other is called escuage vncertayne.
               Finally ye shall vnderstande, that
escuage vncertayne is alwayes adiuged

to be knightes seruice, and draweth
vnto it warde, mariage, & reliefe,
but escuage certaine is no knyghtes
seruice but is of the tenure of socage
as shall be herafter more amplye
shewed.
            
            
               Of warde mariage and reliefe.
               EUery knyghtes seruice draweth
vnto it, warde, mariage, and releife.
Wherfore it is now ryght expedient
somewhat to entrete of them.
               Ye shall therfore be admonished,
that whan the tenaunte whyche holdeth
hys lande by knyghtes seruyce
dyeth, his heyre male beynge at that
tyme wtin thage of .xxj. yeares, the
lorde shall haue the warde, that is to
saye, the custodye or kepynge of the
landes so holden of hym to hys own
vse and profyte, tyl the heyre cōmeth
to the full age of .xxj. yeares. For the

law here presumeth that tyl he cōme
to this age, he is not able to do such
seruice, as is of this tenure requyred
Furthermore yf such heyre be vnmaryed
at the tyme of the deathe of the
tenaunte, than the lorde shal haue also
the warde and bestowynge of the
maryage of hym.
               But yf tenaunt by knyghtes seruice
dyeth, hys heyre female being of
thage of .xiiii. yeres or aboue, thā the
lord shal haue the ward neyther of ye
lande ne yet of the bodye of suche an
heir, and the reason herof is bycause
a woman of that age maye haue a
husbande hable to do knyghtes seruice,
that is to saye, to wayte vpon
the kynges maiesties persone whan
he auaunceth into Scotlande wyth
hys armye royall.
               But if suche an heyre femalle be

within the age of .xiiii. yeres and not
maryed at the tyme of the deathe of
her auncestoure, than the lorde shall
haue the warde of the lande holden
of hym, tyll suche heyre female commeth
to the age of .xvi. yeres, by force
of an acte of parliamēt in the statute
of Westm̄ the fyrste.
               Note that there is a great diuersitie
in the lawe bytwene the ages of
females and of males, for the female
hath these manye ages apoynted by
the lawe. Fyrste, at .vii. yeares of age
the lored her father maye distreyne
his tenauntes for ayde to mary her.
Seconde, at .ix. yeares of age, she is
dowable. Thyrdlye, at .xii. yers she is
hable to assent to matrymonye.
               Fourthly, at .xiiii. yeares she is able
to haue her lande, and shall be oute
of warde if she be of thys age at the

geantye, but of the kynge onelye.
            
            
               Homage auncestrell.
               TEnaunt by homage auncestrel
is he whyche holdeth his lande
of his lorde by homage, and bothe he
and his auncestours whose heyre he
is haue holden the same lande of the
saide lord & of his auncestours tyme
out of mynde by homage, and haue
done vnto them homage, and this is
called homage auncestrell, by reason
of the longe continuaunce whyche
hath bene by title of prescription as
well concernynge the tenauncye in
the bloude of the tenaunte, as concernynge
the lordeshyp in the blode of
the lord. And this seruice of homage
auncestrell drawethe vnto it warrantye
(that is to saye) yf the lorde which
is nowe in lyfe hathe ones receyued
the homage of his tenant, he oughte

to warrant the same tenaunte, what
tyme so euer he shal be impleaded or
sued for such lande so holden of him
by homage auncestrell.
               Moreouer suche seruice of homage
auncestrell draweth to it acquitall
(that is to saye) the lorde oughte
to acquyte the tenaunt agaynste all
other lordes yt can demaūd any maner
of seruice out of the tenauncye.
               Wherfore yf in thys case the tenaunte
whyche holdethe by homage
auncestrell be impleaded of hys landes,
and voucheth his lorde to warrauntye,
who commeth in by processe
and demaundethe of the tenaunte
what he hath to bynde hym to the
warrantye, and the tenaunt sheweth
howe he and his auncestours, whose
heyre he is, haue holden his lande of
hym and of his auncestoures tyme

ease or continuall infirmitie. All
these and suche lyke be dispargementes.
But here also ye shal vnderstande,
that it shall be sayd no dispargement,
onlesse the heyre be so maryed
when he is wythin the age of discretion,
that is to say, within the age
of .xiiii. yeres. For if he be of that age
or aboue and consenteth to such mariage,
it is no dispargement, neyther
shall the lorde for suche mariage lose
his warde, bycause it shal be reputed
and assigned to the folye of the heire
beynge of age of discretion to consēt
to suche mariage.
               Now, yf the gardeyne offre to the
heyre beyng in his warde a conuenient
mariage wythout dispargement,
and the heyre refuseth it, as he maye
very wel do, than ye lord shall haue ye
value of the mariage of suche heyre,

whan he commethe to hys full age.
But yet yf he marye hymselfe being
so in warde agaynste the wyll of hys
gardeyne, than he shal paye the double
value by force of the statute of
Merton before remembred.
               And ye shall note that if landes
holden by knyghtes seruice descende
to an infaunte from hys mother, or
from any of hys auncestours, his father
beyng yet alyue, in thys case the
lorde shall not haue the mariage of
this heyre, for during the lyfe of the
father, the sonne shall be in warde to
no man.
               Finally, it is to be knowne, that
he whyche is gardeyne in cheualrye
in ryght, maye after he hathe seased
the warde, graunte the same eyther
by dede or wythout dede to an other
man & than he to whom suche graūt

is made is called gardeyne in fayte.
               Now as touching reliefe, ye shal
knowe, that yf a man holdethe hys
lande by knightes seruice and dyeth
hys heyre beynge of full age (the full
age of ye male is .xxi. yeares, of the female
.xiiii.) then y• lord of whome the
land is holden shal haue of the heyr
reliefe.
               Reliefe of a hole knightes fee is .C
s. & of halfe a knightes fee fyftye .s.
               Also a man maye holde landes of
a lord by two knyghtes fees, and thā
the heyre beynge of full age at the
death of his auncestoure, shal paye
to his lorde for reliefe .x. poundes.
            
            
               Seruice of castel garder.
               YE shal vnderstande that a man
may holde by knyghtes seruice
and yet not hold by escuage, nor shal
paye no escuage, for he may holde by

castell garder, that is to saye, by seruyce
to kepe a tower of hys lordes
castell, or some other place, vpō a reasonable
warnynge, whan hys lorde
heareth that enemyes wyll come or
be alredy come into Englande.
               Thys seruyce is also knyghtes seruice,
and drawethe to it warde mariage
& reliefe, as the common knyghtes
seruyce dothe.
            
            
               Of graunde sergeauntie.
               THere is also an other kynde of
knightes seruice, called grande
sergeantye, whyche is where a man
holdeth is landes or tenementes of
the kynge by suche seruice as he oweth
in proper person to do, as to bear
the baner of oure soueraigne lorde
the kynge, or his spere, or to conduct
hys hoste, or to be his marshall, or to
be the sewar, caruar, or butler at the

feaste of the coronation, or to be one
of the chamberlaynes of the receypt
of his eschequere, or to do lyke seruices
to ye kyng in propre persone, such
maner of seruyce I saye, is called
grande sergeantye, that is to saye a
greate or hygh seruice, and the cause
why it is so called, is bicause it is the
moste honorable and moste worthye
seruice that is, for he that holdeth by
escuage is not appoynted by hys tenure
to do anye other more specyall
seruice than an other is bounde that
holdethe by escuage, but he that holdeth
by grande sergeantye, is bound
to do some speciall seruice to ye king.
               Also if he that holdeth of the king
by grante sergeanty dyeth, his heire
beyng of ful age, than the heyre shal
paye to the kynge for reliefe, not onlye
.C.S. as he that holdethe by escuage

shall do, but moreouer the clere
yearly value of those landes and tenementes
whych he so holdeth of the
kynge by grande sergeantye.
               Furthermore ye shal obserue that
in the marches of Scotlande some
men holde of the kynge by coruage,
that is to say, by blowing of an horn
to the intent to warne the men of the
contrey whan they heare that the
Scottes or other theyr enemyes be
commynge, or be alreadye entred in to
Englande, whyche seruice is also a
kynde of grande sergeantie.
               Grande sergeantie therfore is as
moche to saye in latyn, as magnum
seruitium, that is to saye, a greate
or hyghe seruice, lyke as petite sergeantye
is called paruum seruitium, yt
is to saye, a lytle or smale seruice.
               But to reuerte agayne to the mamatier

ye shall note yf any tenaunte
holdeth of any other lord than of the
king by such seruice of cornage, then
it is no graunde sergeantye, but yet
neuertheles it is knyghtes seruice, &
draweth to it ward mariage and reliefe,
for this is a rule infallible that
none can holde by grande sergeanty
but of the kynges owne maiestie.
               Finallye ye shall vnderstande,
that al they whych holde of the king
by thys seruice called graunde sergeauntye
do holde of the kynge by
knyghtes seruyce, and by vertue of
thys tenure the kynge shall haue of
them warde mariage and reliefe, but
escuage yet he shal not haue of them
oneles they holde by escuage of him
by expresse and speciall wordes.
            
            
               Petite sergeantie.
               
               TEnaunte by petite sergeantye
is he yt holdeth his land immediatly
of oure soueraygne lorde the
kynge by thys maner of seruice, to
paye to the kynge yearelye eyther a
vowe, a spere, a dagger, a swerde, a
payre of gantlettes, a paire of spores
of golde, a shafte or such other smale
thynges apperteynyng to the warre,
& this seruice is in effect but socage,
bycause that suche a tenaunte is not
bounde by hys tenure to go ne do anye
thing in his owne propre person
touchyng the warre, but only to rendre
and pay yerely certayne thynges
to the kynge, as a man ought to pay
a rente wherfore thys seruice of petite
sergeantye is no knyghtes seruyce,
but yet ye shal note, that a man
can not holde neyther by petite sergeauntye
neyther by graunde sergeantye,

                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
out of mynde, surely the lorde yf he
can not denye this, and if he hath receiued
the homage of such a tenaūt,
is bounde by the lawe to warrante
hym his lande, so that if the tenaunt
lose his lande in defaute of the lorde
thus vouched (that is to saye) called
to warranty, he shal recouer against
hym so moche in value of those landes
and tenementes whyche the lord
had at the tyme of callynge to warrantye
or at any tyme after. But yf
the lorde neuer receyued the homage
of hys tenante, than he maye verye
well whan he is thus vouched disclaime
in the lordeshyp or seignorye,
and so put out the tenaunte of hys
warrantye. Where ye shal note, that
in euery case where the lord disclaim
in his seignorye in courte of recorde,
his seignorye or lordeshyp is extinct,

and the tenaunte shall holde from
thensforthe of the nexte lorde to him
that thus disclaymed.
               Thus ye perceyue that homage
auncestrell is not but where as is a
long cōtinuaūce, as well in the blode
of the tenaunte in respecte of hys tenauncye,
as in the bloude of the lord
in respecte of his seignorye. Wherfore
if the tenaunte doth ones aliene
hys landes to an other, although he
purchasethe the same agayne, yet he
shal not hold any longer by homage
auncestrell bycause of thys discontinuaunce,
but shall holde it nowe by
the vulgare & accustomed homage.
            
            
               Of socage.
               SOcage is properly, where the tenant
is bound to come wyth his
soke (that is to saye) with his plough
to eare and sowe parcell of the demene

landes of hys lorde, which seruyce
in aūcient tyme was very commen
& frequēte but nowe by the mutuall
consent bothe of the lorde and
of the tenant yt ys conuerted for the
moost parte in to a yerely rente. How
be it the name of socage abideth styll
wherfore now al yt is not knyghtes
seruice is caled by y• name of socage.
               So y• yf a man holdeth by fealtye
onely, or by fealtye and homage for
all maner of seruyce, it is but socage
tenure for homage alone makith not
knyghtes seruyce, yea yf a man holdeth
by escuage certayne, as I haue
said here tofore, he holdeth in effecte
but by socage.
               Nowe where a man holdethe
hys landes by socage and dyeth, hys
heyre beynge wythyn thage of .xiiii.
yeres the lord shal not haue y• warde

but the next of kynne to the heyre to
whome the heritage can not descend
shall haue the wardeshyp as well of
the lande as of the heyre, tyll the heir
come to the age of .xiiij. yeares, and
suche gardeine is called gardeine in
socage, and shal rendre accomptes to
the heyre for the issues and profytes
that he hathe receiued of the landes
durynge suche tyme, hys reasonable
costes and expēses deducted, so that
he shall not haue the wardeshyp to
his owne vse & profyte as gardeine
in cheualrye hath.
               Finally ye shal vnderstande that
whan tenaunte in socage dyethe, the
lorde shall haue reliefe, that is to say
the value of the rent that is yearlye
due vnto hym of the tenauncye besyde
the yerly rente: so that in effecte
after the death of his tenante he shal

haue of the heyre .ii. rentes, saue that
for the reliefe, he may distreyne forth
wyth, but for the accustomed rent he
can not distreyne tyl the vsuall daye
of payment be come.
            
            
               Francke almoyne.
               TEnaunte in francke almoygne,
that is to saye in free almesse is
where a byshop, deane, or any other
ecclesiasticall persone holdeth of his
lorde in pure and perpetuall almes,
and suche tenure began firste in olde
time after this maner. Whan a man
was seased in ancient time of certain
landes or tenementes in his demene
as of fee, & of the same tenementes
enfeoffed an abbot & his couent or a
priour & his couent, or any other persone
ecclesiastical, as a deane of a colege
mayster of an hospitall, or suche
like to haue & to hold the same landꝭ

to them and to theyr successoures for
euer in pure and perpetuall almesse,
or in francke almes, in these two cases
the tenementes shulde be holden
in franke almoyne.
               By force of whyche tenure they
that holde in francke almoyne after
thys sorte be bounde of ryght before
god to make orisones and prayers,
to celebrate masses and to do other
diuine seruices for y• soules of their
graunters and feffers, and for the
soules of theyr heires whych be dead
and for y• prosperous estate of their
heyres that be nowe alyue. And bycause
of ryghte they be bounde to
thys diuine seruice, they be discharged
by the lawe to do any other prophane
or corporall seruice, as fealtye
or suche other lyke.
               But neuerthelesse if suche as hold

theyr tenementes in franke almoyne
do omyt and leaue vndone these deuine
seruices wherūto they be boūd
before god, the lorde can not distrein
them, ne yet compell them by any other
meanes by the course of the cō
                  mon
lawe, but the onelye remedy is
to complayne of them to theyr ordinarye,
who of ryght ought to compel
suche ecclesiasticall persones to do
the deuyne seruice due as afore said.
               But here ye shall note that yf a
persone of a chyrche or any other ecclesiasticall
persone holdethe of hys
lorde by certeyne diuine seruice to
be done, as to synge masse euery frydaye
in the weke, or placebo and 
                     •
                  irige,
or to fynde a preest to synge masse
or to distribute in almes .C. pence to
a hondred men at suche daye: in all
these cases, yf such diuyne seruice be

vndone, the lorde mayne very wel distrayn,
bycause the seruice is put here
in certayntye.
               Now I sayde, that if in olde time
a man dyd infeoffe suche ecclesiasticall
persone after such sorte, he shuld
holde hys lande in franke almoyne,
but at this day it is otherwise, for by
the reasone of a statute called, Quia
emptores terrarum, no man can aliene
ne graunt landes or tenementes
in fee simple to holde of hym selfe, so
that nowe yf a man beynge seased of
landes in fee simple graunteth the
same by licēce to an ecclesiastical person
in franke almoyne these wordes
franke almoyne be voyde, & the ecclesiastical
persone shal holde them immediatlye
of y•, lorde of the feoffer by
the same seruyces y• the feoffer helde,
so that no man can hold in franke almoyne,

but by force of a grante made
before the sayd statute, onely the kinges
maiesty excepted, for he is out of
the compasse of the-statute.
               Finally, ye shall note that where
as a man holdeth in frank almoyne,
his lorde is bounde by the lawe to acquite
him of al maner of seruice that
any other lorde can haue or demaūd
out of the sayde landes.
               That yf he dothe not acquyte him
but suffre him to be distreyned, than
he shall haue agaynst his lorde a certayne
wryt, called a wryt of meane,
and shall recouer agaynste hym hys
damages and costes of his suite.
            
            
               Of burgage.
               
                  A Tenure in burgage, is where
an aūciēt broughe is, of which
the kynge is lorde, and they whyche
haue tenemētes wtin y• same brough

holde the same of the kyng, payenge
a certeyne yearly rent, whych tenure
in effecte is but socage tenure. Lykewyse
it is, where as any other lorde
spirituall or temporal is lord of such
broughe.
               Here ye shal note that for the most
parte suche auncient burghes haue
dyuers customes and vsages which
other townes haue not. For some
burghes haue a custome, that ye yongest
sonne shal inherite before the eldeste,
whyche custome is called commonlye
broughe Englyshe.
               Also in some burghes by the custome
the woman shall haue for her
dower al the landes and tenementes
wherof her husbande was seased at
anye tyme durynge the couerture.
               Moreouer in some burghes a mā
may deuise his landes or tenemētes

by testamēt at the tyme of his death,
and by force of suche deuyse or legacye,
he to whome the bequeste was
made, after the death of the testatour
maye by force of thys auncient custome
entre in to the landes so to him
bequethed or deuised without anye
lyuery of seasone to him made or further
ceremonye of lawe.
               Dyuers other customes in Englande
there be contrary to the course
of the common lawe, whyche if they
be anye thynge probable and maye
stande wyth reason are good and effectuall,
not withstandynge they be
agaynste the common lawe.
            
            
               Of villenage or bonde seruice.
               
                  A Tenant in villenage is proper
lye whan a villayne, that is to
saye, a bondman holdeth of his lord,
whose bondman he is, certayne landes

or tenementes, accordynge to the
custome of the Manoure or otherwyse
at the wyll of hys lorde, and to
do his lorde villayne seruice, as to
beare & to carye y• donge of his lorde
out of ye citie or out of hys lordꝭ Manoure,
& to lay it vpon the demeane
landes of his lorde, or to do such like
seruyle & villayne seruice. How be it
fre men in some places holde theyr tenementes
& lādes of their lordes by
custome, by such sorte of seruice, and
theyr tenure is called tenure in villenage,
& yet they themselues be no villaines
ne of seruile condicion but fre mē.
For the land holden in villenage
maketh not the tenant a villayn, but
contrary wyse a villayne may make
fre land to be villayne land vnto his
lorde. As if a villayn purchaseth lād
in fee simple or in fee tayle, the lorde

of the villayne maye entre into the
lande so purchased by hys bondman
and put hym and his heyres out for
euer, and this done, the lord if he wil
maye lease the same lande to his villayne
to holde of hym in villenage.
               And here ye shall vnderstande,
that seruitute or villenage, is the ordinance,
not of the law of nature but
of that law, which is called Ius gentium,
by whyche a man is made subiecte
(contrary to nature) vnto an other
mannes dominiō. For he that is
a villayne or bondman, eyther he is
so by title of prescription (that is to
saye) he and hys auncestoures haue
bene villaynes tyme out of minde, or
elles he is a villayne by his owne cō
                  fession
in court of recorde, so that all
villaynes either they be borne villaynes,
or elles they be made so. They

be borne villaines when theyr father
beynge a bonde man himselfe begetteth
them in lawfull wedlocke, either
of a fre woman or of a bond woman
for so that the father be bonde, the issue
of him lawfully begotten muste
nedes be bonde by the lawes of Englande,
hauynge no regarde to the cō
                  dicion
of the mother, where as in the
ciuill lawe it is clene contrarye. For
there partus sequitur ventrem (that
is to say) the seruitute or bondage of
the mother maketh the chylde bonde
and not of the father. Howe be it the
bastarde sonne of a bondeman shall
not be bonde, bycause a bastarde is,
nullius filius in the law, that is to say
nomans sonne.
               They be made vyllaynes two
wayes, eyther by theyr owne propre
acte, as whan a free man beynge of

full age wyll come into a court of recorde,
& there confesse himselfe bon
                     •
                  e
to an other man.
               Or elles by the lawes of armes, called,
Ius gentium: as whan a man is
taken prysoner in warres, and is
compelled to serue and become the
thrall and bondeman of hym that
toke hym: the lawe calleth suche persone
a villayne.
               And ye shall note that vyllaynes
be properly called in latyn serui, bycause
that whā they be taken in war,
the captaynes be wonte not to kyll
them, but to sell them, and so to saue
theyr lyfes, so yt they be called serui
a seruando, that is to say of sauyng.
They be also called Mancipia, a manu
capíendo, bicause that they be taken
by hand & poure of the enemies.
               
                  
Nowe as I sayde by the lawe o
                     •
                  
nature we are al borne free, but after
that by the lawe of Gentilitie seruit
                     •
                  te
inuaded the worlde, than ensued
the benefyte of manumission. Manumission
is de manu datio, that is to
saye a gyuynge out of the hande or
power. For so longe as a man is in
bondage and seruitute, he is subiecte
to the hande and power of an other,
and whan he is manumissed he is
made free & delyuered from the sayd
power, so that a manumission is nothynge
elles than an enfranchisemēt
that is to saye, a wrytynge testifieng
that the lorde hath enfranchised his
villayn & al his offpring and sequel.
               Also yf the Lorde maketh to hys
villayne an obligacion of a certeyne
summe of money, or grauntethe to
him by his dede an annuitie or yearly

pension, or leaseth to hym by dede
landes or tenementes for terme of
yeres, any of these actes do imply an
enfranchisement.
               Lykewyse yf the Lorde maketh
a feoffement to his villayne, and maketh
vnto hym lyuery of seys
                     •
                  , thys
also is an enfranchisment and secret
manumissiō. Brefely to speke, where
so euer the lorde compelleth his vyllaine
by the course of the lawe to do
that thyng that he myght otherwyse
ēforce him to do or to suffre without
the auctoritie and compulsion of the
lawe, he doth by implication enfranchise
his villayne, as if the lorde wyl
bryng agaynst his villayne an action
of det, an action of accompt, of couenant
or of trespace, these and such
lyke be in the eye of the lawe enfranchisementes
and manumissions, bycause

that the lorde in all these cases
may haue the effecte and purpose of
his suite (that is to saye) the goodes,
catels, and correctiō of his bondman
without the compulsion of the lawe
euen by his owne propre power and
authoritie whyche he hath vpon hys
villayne. But if the lord doth sue his
vilayne by an appeale of felonye, the
villayne beyng lawfully endyted of
the same before, this is no tacite manumission
or infranchisemēte, for the
lorde though he haue power to beate
his villaine and to spoyle him of his
goodes, yet he can not by the lawe of
this Realme put him to deathe.
               Ye shall also vnderstande, that if
a mannes villayne purchaseth landꝭ
or acquyre and gette vnto him anye
other thynge, the lorde maye by and
by entre, and sease the same in to hys

owne handes. Wherfore if the lorde
wyll brynge agaynste hys villayne a
praecipe ꝙ reddat, by whyche he demaundeth
agaynst his villayne any
landes or tenementes, this implyeth
an enfranchisemente, for asmoche as
he byndeth himselfe to the prescripte
and authoritie of the lawe, where as
he might vse his owne authoritie, by
entring and seasing the said landes.
               Finally ye shal marke that some villaynes
be called villaynes in grosse,
and other some be called villaynes
regardāt. In grosse be they of which
the lorde is seuerally seased, and not
by reasone of any lordeshyp or maner,
but they be called regardaunte
whiche do belonge to a Manoure, of
whyche the lorde is seased, and the
sayd villaynes haue bene regardant
(that is to saye) expectant and attendante

tyme out of mynde to the lorde
of the sayde Manour, in doing vnto
him suche seruices as to a villayne
appertayne.
            
            
               
                  ❧ Of rentes. ❧
               
               FOr asmoch as vpō euery tenure
there is commonly reserued one
rente or other: therefore I thynke it
good sumwhat to treate of rentes.
But ye must vnderstande that there
be sundry sortes of rentes. There is
one kynde of rente whyche is called
rent seruice. 
                     •
                  n other whiche is called
rent charge, and the thyrde which
is named in frenche rente secke, that
is to saye in latyne redditus siccus,
a drye rente. Nowe rent seruice is so
called, bycause it is knyt to ye tenure,
and is as it were a seruice, wherby a
man holdeth his landes or tenemētꝭ,
or at lest way when the rente is vnseuerably

coupled and knyt wyth the
seruice, as for an exemple, where the
tenant holdeth his lande of the king
or of any other lorde by fealtie and
by certaine rente, or by homage, fealtie
and certaine rent, or by any other
sortes of seruices & by certaine rent,
this rent is called rente seruice. And
here ye shal note, that if this rent seruice,
be at any time when it ought to
be payed, behynde and vnpayde, the
lorde of whom the land or tenement
is so holden, whether it be in fee simple,
fe taile, for terme of life for yeres
or at wyll, may of common right entre
and distraine for the rent, though
there be no mencion at all, ne clause
of distresse put in the dede or lease. I
said before, that y• nature of this rent
seruice is to be coupled and knyt to
the tenure. For where no tenure is,

there can be no rent seruice. And therfore,
if at this day I be seised of landes
in fee simple, and make a dede of
feffement of the same to an other in
fe simple, reseruing by the same dede
a rente, thys can be called no rente
seruice, bicause there can be nowe no
tenure betwene the feffoure and the
feffee. Otherwise it is of feffementes
in fee simple, made before the statute
of Westmester the thirde called Quia
emptores terrarū. For before the making
of y• statute, if a man had made
a feoffement in fe simple, reseruynge
to him a certayne rent, yea though it
had bene wtout dede, here had bene
created a new tenure betwene the feffoure
and the feffee, and the feffee
shuld haue holdē of the feffoure, who
by vertue of the same myght of common
right haue distreyned for suche

rent. But at this daye, by force of the
sayde acte, there can be no suche holdyng
or tenure created nor begonne,
and consequently no rent seruice can
be at this daye reserued vpon anye
gyfte in fee simple, except it be in the
kinges case, who being chiefe lord of
all euer might and may giue landes
to be holden of him. Thus ye se, that
at this day, no subiect can reserue any
rente seruice vnto him, onles the
reuersiō of the landes or tenementes
that he shall graunt, be styll in him,
as where he grauntethe them in fe
                     •
                  
tayle, or maketh but a lease for terme
of lyfe or for certayne yeares or ells
at wil. For in al these cases the reuersion
of the fee simple remayneth styll
in hym, and therfore if here be anye
rent reserued, it is to be called a rent
seruice, and is of common right distreynable,

though there be no clause
of distresse in the dede of feffemente
or lease.
               But here ye wyl aske me, when in
the case before remembred, a man at
this daye gyuethe cleane aweye the
lande or tenement from himselfe in
fee simple, so that there is no maner
of reuersion of the same remaynyng
in him at all, and yet neuertheles reserueth
vnto hym by hys dede a certaine
rent: what maner rent this shal
be called? I answer, if there be in the
dede indented any clause of distresse
put, that is, that if the rent be behind
vnpayed, it shalbe lawful for the feffoure
to entre and to distreyne, it is
called a rente charge, forasmoche as
the lande is charged therwyth, but
howe? of common right? no, but only
by vertue and force of the wrytynge.
               
                  
But on the other syde, if there be no
suche clause of distresse put in the indenture,
thā the rent so reserued shal
be called a rent secke.
               Likewyse, if a man that is seised of
certaine landes, wyll graunte eyther
by indēture or by his dede polle that
is to saye single and not indented, a
yearly rent out of the same landes to
an other, whether it be in fe simple, fe
tayle, for terme of lyfe, for yeares, or
at wyll, wyth clause of distresse, then
this rent is called a rente charge and
he to whom suche rente is graunted
may for defaulte of payment therof,
entre and distreine. But contrarely,
if the graunte be made wythout any
such clause of distresse, it is called rēt
secke that is to say a dry rent, bicause
he can not come to it in case it be denied,
by way of distresse in so moch that

if he were neuer seysed of it, he is by
the course of the common lawe without
remedie. Otherwise it is of a rent
charge, for here he to whō the graunt
is made, whā the rent is behinde may
chose whether he wyll sue a wrytte of
annuitie againste the grauntoure, or
distreyne for the rent behynde, and reteine
the distresse tyll tyme he be paid
accordingly. But he cā not haue both
remedies to gither, but muste take
him to the one, for if he ones recouer
by a wrytte of annuitie, then is the
lande discharged. And if he sewe not
his writte of annuitie, but distrayne
for the arreragies, and the tenau
                     •
                  te
seweth a 
                     •
                  epleuin, wherupon y• other
auoweth the taking of the distresse in
court of recorde: then is the land charged
and the person of the grauntour
discharged of the action of annuitie.

Ye shal also vnderstand, that if a mā
wyll, that an other shall haue a rent
charge cōmyng out of his lande, and
yet wyll not that his person shuld be
by any meanes charged by wrytte of
ānuitie, he may thā haue such clause
in ye ende of his dede. Prouiso ꝙ praesens scriptum, nec quic
                        
                           
                        
                        quam
                      in eo contē
                     tum
ullo pacto se extendat ad onerā
                     dam personam meam per breue seu
actionem de annuitate, sed tantū modo ualeat ad onerandum, terras, fū
                     dos,
& tenementa mea de annuo redditu praedicto, If thys or suche lyke
clause be added, then the land is charged
and the person of the grauntour
is discharged.
               Also if a man wyll make a dede of
graunte in this wise, that if Iohn at
Style be not yearly payd at the feast

of Christms for terme of his life .xx.
shillinges sterlyng, that then it shall
be lawfull for the sayd Ihō at Style
to distreyne for it in the Manoure of
Dale: this is a good rent charge, bycause
the Manoure is charged with
the rent by wey of distresse, and yet neuerthelesse
in this case the persone of
him that made such dede is discharged
of any action of annuitie, forasmoch
as he graunted not by his dede
any ānuitie to ye sayd Ihon at Style
but onely graūted, that he might distreyne
for suche yearly rent.
               Furthermore ye shall note, that if
a man hath a rent charge to him and
to his heires cōmyng out of certeyne
landes, and doth purchase any parcel
of this land to him and to his heires,
in thys case the hole rente charge is
qwenched and gone, and the annuite

also, the cause is this, ye a rent charge
can not be in suche case apporcioned.
Otherwise it is of a rent service, for if
one whiche hath a rent seruice as for
exemple, xx d. by yeare doth purchase
parcel of the lande out of which this
yearly rent of, xx d. is commyng, this
shal not extinguish ne drowne y• hole
rent, but for that parcell only. For rēt
seruice in suche case may very wel be
apporcionate and rated according to
the value of the lande. Yet there be
some sortes of rentes seruices which
in no wyse can be apporcioned. As
where a tenaunt holdeth his lande of
his lorde by the seruice to rēdre to his
lorde yearly at suche a feast, an horse,
a ring of gold, a redde rose, a gylouer

                     〈◊〉
                   suche lyke, if in this case the lorde
doth purchase parcell of y• land thus
of him holden, this seruice is gone, bicause

such seruice can not be seuered
ne apporcioned. Also escuage is a seruice
that may very well be apporcioned
accordinge to the afferaunce and
rate of the lande.
               But where any lande is holden by
homage and fealtie, if the lorde purchaseth
parcel of the land, yet he shal
haue hys homage and fealtie styll of
his tenaunte.
               Ye shall marke also, that if a man
maketh a lease of landes to an other
for terme of lyfe, reseruing to him certaine
rent: if in this case he graūteth
the rent to Iohn at Style sauing to
himselfe the reuersion of the said lād,
thys rente is but rente secke bycause
Iohn at Style y• hath the rent, hath
nothing in the reuersion of the land.
But if he graunteth the reuersion of
the lande to Iohn at Noke for terme

of lyfe and the tenaunt atturneth accordingly,
then hath Iohn at Noke
the rente as rente seruice bycause he
hath y• reuersion for terme of his life.
               Lykewise it is, if a man giueth lā
                  des
or tenementes in taile, reseruing
to him & to his heires certaine rente,
or maketh a lease of ye land for terme
of life, reseruinge certayne rent, if he
graunteth the reuersion to an other
and the tenaunt atturneth accordingly,
the hole rent and seruice shal passe
by this worde reuersion, bicause the
rent and seruice in suche case be incident
to the reuersion and do passe by
the graunt of the reuersion. But if he
had graunted the rent only: the reuersion
had not passed.
            
            
               ¶ What remedy a man hath
to recouer his rent when
it is behynde.
               
                  
I Shewed you before, that for a rēt
seruice if it be behynde, ye may distrayne
in the grounde euen of common
ryght thoughe there be no suche
clause of distresse mēcioned in y• dede
of feoffement, graūt or lease. Also for
a rente charge ye maye distreyne or
bryng your wryt of annuitie at your
choise and election, as before is declared.
But of a rent secke if ye were neuer
seised of it nor of any parcel therof,
ye be without remedy by course of
the comō law, for ye can not distreyne
for it, nor yet bryng your wrytte of an
nuitie, but if ye were ones seised of it
or of parcel therof and it is estsones
behinde, then youre remedie shall be
this. Ye must go either by your selfe
or by your deputye to the lande or tenement
out of which the rent is commyng,
and there demaunde the arreragies

of the rent, whiche if the tenāt
denye to paye, this denyal is a disseisin
of the rent. Also if the tenaunt be
not then ready to pay it, this counter
uayleth a denyal which is a disseisin.
Moreouer if neither the tenaunt nor
none other man be remayning vpon
the grounde to pay the rent, when ye
demaund the arreragies, this also is
a denyall in the law, and is in very
dede a disseisin. And of these disseisinꝭ
ye may haue an assise of nouell disseisin
against the tenaunt, and shal recouer
seisin of the rent aud the arreragies
and youre damagies and costes
of your wrytte and of your plee. And
if after suche recouery and execution
had, the rente be agayne at an other
tyme denyed you, then ye may haue a
redisseisin and shal recouer your double
dammagies. &c.
               
                  
It shalbe therfore good wisdome
for a man when a rent is graūted by
any persone vnto him, to take of the
tenant of the land a peny or an halfepeny
in name of seisin of the rent, and
then if at the next day of paiment the
rent be denyed him, he may haue an
Assise of nouel disseisin.
               And ye shall note, y• there be thre
causes of disseisin of rent seruice, that
is to wete, rescouse, repleuin & incloser.
Rescouse is, when the lorde vpon
the lande holden of him, distreyneth
for his rent behynde, and the distresse
is rescued from him, or if y• lord come
vpon the land and wyl distreine, and
the tenant or any other man for hym
wyl not suffre him, this is called Rescouse.
               Repleuin is, when the lorde hath

distreyned & repleuin is made of the
distresse by wryt or by playnt. Encloser
is when landes or tenementes be
so inclosed that the lord can not come
within the landes or tenementes for
to distreyne. And the chefe cause why
suche thinges so made be disseisins
to the lorde is for asmoch as the lord
is by this wey disturbed of the mean
and remedy wherby he ought to com
and haue his rent, that is to wete, by
distresse.
               And there be iiiij. causes of disseisin
of a rent charge, ye is to wete, rescous,
repleuin, encloser, and denyer.
For denyer or denyal is aswell a disseisine
of a rente charge, as it is of a
rent secke.
               Finally ye shal vnderstande, that
there be two causes of disseisin of a
rent secke, that is, denyall & en
                     •
                  loset.
               
                  
And is semeth that there is yet an
other cause of disseisin of all the three
rentes aforesaid, that is to wete this,
when the lorde commeth to the lande
holden of him, or when he that hath
a rent charge or a rent seck commeth
to the lande to distreyne for the rente
behynd, and the tenant hearing this,
encountreth him, and forstalleth him
the weye wyth force and armes, and
manaceth him in such sort as he dare
not come to y• ground for to distreine
for his rent behynd for feare of death
or of mutilatiō of his membres: this
is a disseisin bicause the partie is disturbed
of his mean & lawful remedy
wherby he ought to come to his rent.
               Finally ye shall obserue & marke,
that by an act of parliament made in
the xxxij. yeare of oure soueraygne
lorde king Henry the eight, it is lawful

for the executours and administratoures
of tenantes in fe simple, tenantes
in fee tayle and tenantes for
terme of lyfe of rent seruices, rēt charges,
rent seckes and of fee fermes, for
the arreragies of suche rētes as were
due vnto theyr testatoures in their
liues, either to distrayne for the same
or at their election to brynge an action
of dette, sauyng in such lordshipes
in Wales or in the marches therof,
where the tenauntes haue vsed tyme
out of mynde to pay vnto euery lord
at his fyrst entry into the lordshyp any
sumine of money for the redemption
of all maner duties and penalties
incurred at any tune before their
lordes entry.
               Also by force of the sayde arte the
husbande whiche was seysed in the
right of hys wife may after the death

of his wyfe either distrayne or bryng
an action of dette for the arrerages
of such rentes as were due & vnpayd
in her lyfe.
               Likewise it is of him that hath a
rent for terme of an other mans lyfe,
if he for terme of whose lyfe he hath
the rent dyeth, yet by vertue of y• sayd
acte he or his executoures and administratoures
may either distrayne or

               IT is called a discontinuāce by the

in his own right only maketh an alt
                     •
                  
                  enation
of the same lādes to an other
person, by reasō wherof, he that shuld
haue them after him, and which then
hath right vnto them, can not entre
into them, but is driuen to his remedy
by wey of action, in such wise that
the sayd landes be not vtterly shifted
and gone trō such person of persons
as haue right vnto them, but be alō
                  ly
discontinued for a time, til the person
which after the death of such discontinuer
hath right vnto them, do
recōtinew & bring them home againe
not by entrye but by sute and wey of
action. As for exemple, if tenāt in taile
of certaine landes doth infeffe an other
in the same, in se simple or fe taile
and hath issue and 
                     •
                  peth, his issue can
not entre into the landes, though he
hath title and right vnto them, but is

put to his action, whiche is called

formedone in the descendre. And if
such tenāt in taile which maketh such
a feoffement, hath no issue at tyme of
his death, it is yet neuerthelesse a discontinuance
to him which is either in
the reuersion or in the remaindre, so
that neither thone nor thother can entre,
but they be driuen to their action
he in the reuersion to his formedone
in the reuertir, and he in the remaindre
to his formdone in the remaindre.
               In like maner if a bishop doth aliene
landes which be parcel of his bishoprich,
and dyeth: this is a discontinuance
to his successour, forasmoch
as he can not entre, but is driuen to
his writ of entre sine assēsu capituli.
               Semblably, if a Deane be sole seised
of lādes as in y• right of his deanrye

and maketh suche an alienation,
this is a discontinuance to his successour.
Also if the maistre of an hospital
alieneth certaine lād
                     •
                  s of his hospital,
this is a discontinuāce and his
successour can not entre, but is put to

will alien any landes or tenementes,
whiche be parcell of his glebe landes
to an other in fe simple or in fe taile,
and dyeth or resigneth his benefice:
this is no discontinuance to his successour,
but that he may very wel entre,
not wtstandinge suche alienation
made by his predecessour. The cause
of this difference Master Litletonne
doth largely declare in his boke of Tenures,

you, that in the .xxxij. yeare of
this kingꝭ most noble reigne, it is inacted,
that no fine feffement or other
acte to be made or suffred by the husband
only, of any landes or tenemētꝭ
being the inheritāce or frehold of his
wife, duringe the couerture betwene
them, shalbe any discōtinuāce therof,
or be preiudicial or hurtful to the said
wife or to her heires, or to such as shal
haue right title or interest to the same
by the death of such wife, but that the
same wife and her heires, and such other
to whom such right shall apperteine
after her decesse, shal & may thā
lawfully entre into all such landes &
tenemētes according to their rightes
and titles therin.

of certaine doubtes and ambiguities,
it was inacted, that al fines

                  ❧ Of testamentes or last willes.
               
                  TEstamentū
                   in latyn is as moche
to say as mentis testatio, that is
a declaratiō or witnessinge of a mans

mynd. And there be two sortes of testamentes.
The one is called testamentum
scriptum, that is, a written testament,
or a last wil by writing, and the
other is called testamentum nuncupatū
                  
a testament nuncupatiue, which
is when a man wyl expresse by mouth
his last wil and testament wtout wryting,
onely by calling before him certayn
of his neighbours in whose presence
he doth signifie by wordes his
last minde and wil. And this for most
parte men vse to do when for feare of
sodennes of deth, they dare not abyde
the writing of their wil. And this wil
(onlesse it be in certaine cases) is as
strong and as sure, as is a testament
or laste will put in writing and sealed
with the seale of the testatour.
               Also ye shal vnderstād that though
a testament by writinge be not sealed

with the seale of the testatoure, yet is
the testament good & effectual in the
lawe.
               And ye shal also marke, that where
a man maketh ones his testament &
wil, and afterwarde maketh an other
wil by wordes: if his laste will be proued
before the Ordinary, and by him
put in wryting and insealed with his
seale, such last wyl shal auoid the first
wil, onles it be in special cases, and so
alweyes the latter wil and testament
shal auoyd the former.
               Finally ye shal obserue, that by an
acte of Parliament made in the .xxi.
yeare of our soueraigne lorde Kinge
Henry theight, it was ordeyned that
where part of therecutours named in
the testament of their testator wherin
any landes or tenementes be willed
to be solde by them: refuseth to take

vpon them the administration, & the
residue do take the charge and administration
therof vpon them: in thys
case al bargaines and sales of the said
landes made only by those executors
that toke the administratiō of y• testament
vpon them, shalbe as good and
as effectual in the law, as if as the residue
of y• same executors so refusing
had ioyned with them or him, if it be
but one person, in the makinge of the
bargaine and sole.
