RECANTATION
OF MAISTER PATRIK
ADAMSONE, ſometime
Archbiſhop of SAINT-ANdrowes
in Scotlande.
            1598.
         
         
            
            
            Pſeudoepiſcopomaſtix. THE PRINTER TO
THE READER.
            
               AFTER that the iuſt copie of this
Recantation, good Reader, came
ſundrie times to my handes in
writt, I wes moued at laſt, for the
great benefite of many, to put it in
print, as a worthie monument of Gods mercie
towarde his Church, in iuſtifying the righteous
cauſe thereof, and in condamning the crooked
courſe of all ſortes of adverſaries, and that ſo
plainelie and mightilie, that it can not be denied
bot to be done by the verie fingar of GOD him
ſelfe, and not by the witte or policie of man.
For howſoeuer ſome euill affected perſones, adverſareis
to Chriſtian Diſcipline, ſurmiſe this
Recantation to haue bene craftelie procured, or
rather violentlie inforced by the policie of the
contrarie partie (as they ſpeake) yet the credite
of the worſhipfull and faithfull witneſſes, yet
aliue, that testifie the trueth hereof by their
hande-writtes and ſubſcriptions, according as
the thing with the haill circumſtances thereof
wes done in their ſight and hearing, as hereafter

truely is ſet downe, plainlie proueth the work
to be of God, and not of man. Which thing as it
ought to mooue the godlie to an earneſt thankeſgiuing,
for ſo rare & great a benefite: ſo it ſhould
worthilie terrifie the adverſareis of all ſortes,
from further ſtriuing againſt the trueth of chriſtian
Diſcipline, no leſſe iustified here by their
owne mouth, as it were, then wes Davids innocencie
by the mouth of Saul, when he ſaide: Is
this thy voyce, my ſonne David: Thou art more
righteous then I: whiche more cleared Dauid,
and condemned Saul, then if either David himſelfe
or any of his friendes or fellowes, by worde
or writt had taken vpon them to make his Apologie.
For this recanter wes no meane adverſary
to true Diſcipline, or one of the cōmon ſorte, but
a chiefe Ringleader, & one that as in ſtyle moū
               ted
to the hiest Antichriſtian (if not heatheniſh
after the maner of Flamine and Archiflamine)
digniteis in Scotlande: ſo in will, diligence and
all induſtrie negotiating againſt trew reformation,
none either did or wes able to matche him.
Whoſe extorted and cōſtrained confeſſion by the
hand of God, though volūtarie in regard of mē,
as wraſted out of the mouth of one of the chiefeſt
in name of all the reſt, ſhould worthily moue
all of his coate and complices, to kicke no more
againſt prickes, leaſt otherwiſe continuing with

Saul in perſecuting David, againſt their owne
conſciences, they be brought (in Gods righteous
iudgement) at last to ſome tragicall and miſerable
end in this life, and to eternall torments in
the world to come: which is ſpokē not ſo much in
regard of ſuch graue and learned fathers, as not
of ambition, but through the iniurie of the time,
for holding out euill perſons from thoſe dignities,
who would make hauoke of the Church, &
for ſtaying the furie of the ſtorme of perſecution
of the brethren, which otherwiſe no doubt would
enſewe, are cotented (being called) for the quietnes
of the Church to accept for an interim and
time, till God ſend further reformation, that vnpure
and monſtruouſly mangled Miniſtrie of
thinges that otherwiſe are meere aſuſtata, as
we ſay, and not competent in one perſon, to witt,
a cōtemptible miniſteriall ſeruice, making men
to be compted the ofſcourings of the world, and
a lordlie pompeous gouernement like to that of
the nations plainlie forbidden by Christ in theſe
words, vos autem non ſic, but ȝe ſhall not be ſo:
To theſe men I ſay, who wilbe readie vppon all
occaſions, to farder reformation, the former
threatnings apperteineth not ſo much as to the
malitious perſecutours of the true Miniſtrie vnder
the name of fathers of the Church, for maintenance
of their ambition.
         
      
      
         
            
            
               8. Aprilis 1591.
            
            
               
                  BRETHREN, vnderstanding
the proceedings of the Aſſemblie
in my contraire, and beeing nowe
withholden by ſeiknes from preſenting
my ſelfe before you: that I
might giue cōfeſsion of that doctrine quhairin
I howp that God ſall call me, and that at his
pleaſure I might depairt in ane vnitie of chriſtian
faithe: I thowght gud by wreitt to vtter
the ſamyne to ȝour wiſdomes. And lykewayis
to craue ȝour godlie wiſdomes aſsistance, noth
for the reſtitution of any warldlie pompe or
preeminence, quhilk I little reſpect, bot to remooue
from me the ſlanderis quhilkes are raiſed
in this countrie concerning the variance of
doctrine, ſpeciallie on my pairt, quhairin I protest
befoir God, that I haif onlie a ſingle reſpect
to his glorie, and by his graice I ſall abyd heirin
vnto my lyves end.
            
            
               
FIrſt, I confes the trew doctrine of
chriſtian religioun to be publiklie
tawght & rightlie annuncied within
this Realme, and deteiſtis all papiſtrie
and ſuperſtition, like as (bliſſed be God)
I haif deteſted the ſamine in my heart,
the ſpaice of 30. ȝeires, ſen it pleaſit God
to giue me the knowledge of the treuth,
quhairin I haif walkit vprightlie aſweill
heir as in vther countreis, as the Lorde
beires me record, vntill theiſe laſt dayes,
quhairin partlie for ambition and vaine
glorie, to be preferred befoir my brethren:
and partlie for couetouſnes, I haif
poſſeſſed the pelf of the Kirk: I did vndertake
this office of Archbiſhoprike
quhairwith iuſtlie the ſyncereſt profeſſors
of the worde haif funde fault, and
haif condemned the ſamine, as impertinent
to the office of a ſincere paſtor of
Godis word. And albeit men wold colloure
the ſamen, and the imperfections
thairof by diuers clokes, ȝit the ſamine
can noth be conciled from the ſpirituall

eyes of the faithfull. Nether ȝit can the
men of God, quhen they ar putt to thair
conſcience, diſſemble the ſamine.
            Nixt, I confes, that I was in ane erronious
opinioun, that I belived the gouvernment
of the Kirk, to be likevnto the
kingdomes of the earth, plaine cōtrairy
to the commaundement of our Maiſter
Chriſt, and the monarchie quhairby the
Kirk is gouerned, not to be onely in the
perſoun of our Sauiour Chriſt (as it is)
bot in the miniſteris, quho are nothing
bot vaſſalles vnder him in an equalitie
amang tham ſelfis.
            Thirdlie, That I married the Earle of
Huntle, contrair to the command of the
kirk, without the cōfeſſion of his faith, &
profeſſion of the ſincere doctrine of the
word, I repent, and craves God pardon.
That I traveled both by reaſoning and
vther ways to ſubiect the kirk-men vnto
the Kings ordinance, in things that aperteine
to eccleſiaſticall matters, & things
of cōſcience, I aſke God mercie, quhair-vpon

grait enormiteis haif fallen furth
in this countrie.
            That I belived and ſo tawght, the preſbitreis
to be a fooliſhe inuentionne, and
wold haif it ſo eſtemed of all mē, quhilk
is ane ordinance of Chriſt, I craue God
mercie.
            Forder, I ſubmit my ſelf to the mercie
of God, and iudgemēt of the Aſſemble,
not meaſuring my offences by my owne
ſelf, nor infirmiteis of my awin ingine,
bot vnto the gud iudgement of the kirk,
to the quhilk alwayes I ſubiect my ſelfe,
and beſeekis ȝou to make interceſſionne
to God for me, & to the King, that I may
haif ſum moyane to liue, & conſume the
reſt of this my wretched tyme, for winning
of quhois favors (quhilk fooliſhlie
I thoucht thairby to obteine) I committed
all theis errours.
            As quhair I am burdened, to haif ben
the ſettair furth of the buke called The
Kings declaration, quhairin the hol ordor
of the kirk is condemned and traduced,

I proteſt before God, that ſo I was commandit
to wreitt the ſame by the Chancellair
for the time, bot chieflie by N. (an
vther grait courteor) quho him ſelf penned
in the ſecond act of parliament, cō
               cerning
the powar and authoritie of Iudicator
to be abſolutelie in the Kinges
powar, and that it ſuld not be lawfull to
any ſubiect to reclame fra the famin, vnder
the penaltie of the act, quhilk I ſuppoſe
was treaſoun.
            Item quhair it is alleagit that I ſuld
haif condemned the doctrine annunced
& taught by the Miniſtrie of Edinburgh,
and to haue allowed onely concerning
obedience to the Prince, I confes & proteſtis
before God that I never vnderſtud
nor ȝit knew any thing bot ſinceritie &
vprightnes in the doctrine of the Miniſteris
of Edinburgh in that point, nor in
any vther.
            Forder, I confes I was the authour of
the Act, diſchargeing the Miniſteris ſtipends,
that did not ſubſcribe thoſe actes

of Parliament quhairwith GOD hath
iuſtlie recompenſed my ſelf.
            As for any violent courſe, it is knawen
wel ynough quho wes the author thairof,
and my pairt was tryed at the impriſonment
of Maſter Nicol Dalgliſche, Mai.
Patrik Malvill, M. Thomas Iak, & vthers.
            Moreover I graunt I was moir buſſie
with ſum Biſhops of Englande in preiudice
of the diſcipline of our Kirk, partlie
quhen I was thair, & partlie by our mutuall
intelligence ſenſyn then, became a
gud chriſtian, mikle leſſe a faithfull Paſtor.
            Nether is thair any thing that moir
eſhameth me then my often diſceauing
and abuſing of the Kirk heir to foir by
confeſſionnes, ſubſcriptionnes, proteſtationnes,
&c. quhilk be far from me now
and evir hereafter, Amen.
            
               
                  Sic ſubſcribitur,
Ȝour Brother in the Lord
M. Patrik Adamſonne.
               
            
         
         
            
            AS quhair ȝour wiſdomes deſires to
haif mine own opinion cōcerning
the buke of the Declaratiun of the
Kinges intentioun, the ſamen is at moir
length declared in the confeſſion quhilk
I haif exhibit alreadie, quhairin I haif
condemned all the hole artikles thairin
contained, like as by theis preſentes I cō
               demne
thame.
            As quhair ȝe require quhat became of
the bukes of the aſſemble, all quhilkis I
had preſerued hole vnto the returning
of the Lords & Miniſtrie out of England,
and if I had noth preſerued thame, my
Lord of Arrane intendit to haif maid thā
be caſt into the fire: and vpon a certane
day in Falkland, befoir then war, deliuered
to the Kings Maieſtie. The Biſchope
of N. accumpanied with M. Henry Hamiltonne
rent owt ſum leafes, & deſtroyed
ſic things as maid agains our eſtaite,
and that not without my awn ſpeciall
allowance.
            As for the bukes quhilk I haif ſet furth,

I haif ſett furth no thing except a commentarie
vpon the firſt chapter of Paule
to Timothie, quhilk I did direct to the
Kings Maieſtie, & kept no examplar beſide
me, and vnderſtandes that M. Iohnne
Geddie gat the ſamyn from the King, and
lent it to M. Robert Hebpurne.
            
            Farther I wrote nothing, but onelie
maid mention in my preface vpon the
Apocalypſe, that I ſuld write a buke called
Pſyllus, quhilk (being prevented by
diſeaſe) God would not ſuffer me to finiſhe,
and the litle thing that wes done, I
cawſed to deſtroy it.
            And likewayes I haif ſet furth the buke
of Iob with the Apocalypſe, and the lamentationnes
of Ieremie, all in verſe, to
be prented in Englande: as for my intention
I am not diſpoſed or in abilitie
to writte any thing at this tyme, and if
it pleaſed God I were reſtored to my
health, I wald change my ſtyle as Caietanus
did at the councill of Trent.
            
            As for Sutcliuins buke agains the forme

and ordour of the Preſbitreis, ſo farr am
I from being partenar in that warke, that
as I knowe noth the man, nor had neuer
any intelligence of the warke befoir it
was done: ſo if it pleaſe God to giue me
dayes, I will wreit in his contrarie to the
mantenance of the contrarie confeſſioun.
            Prayes the Brethren to be reconciled
and to be at vnitie & peax with me, and
in tokē of thair forgiuenes, becaus health
ſufferis me noth to goe over to the College
quhair ȝe are preſentlie aſſembled
(quhilk I wold gladlie doe to aſke God
and ȝou forgivenes) that it wold pleaſe
ȝou to repair hither, that I may doe it
heir.
            Moreover, I cōdemne by this my ſubſcription
quhatſoeuer is contaned in the
Epiſtle Dedicatorie to the K. Maieſtie,
befoir my buke on the Reuelation, that
is either ſlanderous or offenſiue to the
brethren: Alſo I promiſe to ſatisfie the
brithren of Edinburgh or any vther Kirk

of this Realme, according to a gud conſcience
in quhatſoevir they finde thamſelfes
iuſtlie offended, & contrarie to the
word of God in any of my ſpeeches, actions,
or proceedings quhilk haif paſſed
from me.
            And concerning the commentarie vpon
the firſt Epiſtle of Paule to Timothie,
Becaus ther are diuers things thairin
contained offenſiue, and that tendis
to allowe of the eſtait of Biſhops, vtherways
then Gods word can ſuffer, I condemne
the ſamen.
            The pages befoir written, dytted by
me Maiſter Patrike Adamſone and written
at my command by my ſervitor Maiſter
Samuel Cunninghame, and by his hande
drawin in the blankes, I ſubſcribe with

            Maiſter Patrike Adamſones
owen anſwere and refutation
of the Buke falſlie called The
Kings declaration.
            
               IHaif interpriſed of mere
remorſe of cōſcience to
wreitt againſt a buke called
The Declaration of the
Kings Maiesties intention.
Albeit it conteanith litle
or nothing of the Kings awin intention
bot my awin at the tyme of the writting
theirof: and the corrupt intentionnes of
ſic as for the tyme wer abowt the King
and abuſed his minoritie. Of the quhilk
buke and contents thair of compyled by
me at the command of ſum chiefe courteours
for the time (as is befoir wrettin)
I ſall ſhortlie declair my opinioun, as the
infirmitie of ſicknes and weaknes of memorie
will permitt.
            Firſt, In the hole buke is no thing cō
               tamed

but aſſertionnes of lies, aſcribing
to the Kings Maieſtie that quhairof he
was not culpable: For albeit as the tyme
went, his Maieſtie could haif ſuffered
theis things to haif bene publiſhed in his
Realme, ȝit his Maieſtie wes nevir of that
nature to haif revealed ony manes perſoun,
or to vpbraid any man with calumneis,
quhairof thair is a nomber contained
in that buke.
            Secondlie, In the Declaration of the
ſecond acte of Parliament thair is mention
made of Maiſter Andro Melvill, and
his preachinges moſt wrangfullie condemned
in ſpeciall, as factious and ſeditious,
albeit his Maieſtie hath had a livelie
triall of that manes fidelitie & trewth
in all proceedinges from tyme to tyme.
Trew it is, he is earneſt & zealous, quho
can abyde no corruption (quhilk moſt
vnadviſedlie I attributed to a fyrie & ſalt
humor) quhilk his Maieſtie findes by experience
to be trew, for he alloweth weil
of him, and knawith thinges that wer alleaged

vpon him to haue bene fals and
contruved treacherie.
            Thair ar contained in that ſecond act
of Parliament diuers vtheris fals intentions
for to defame the miniſtrie, and to
bring the Kirk of God in hatred & invie
with thair Prince and Nobilitie, burdening
and accuſing the Miniſteris falſlie
of ſedition & other crimes quhairof they
war innocent, as likeways it is wrettin in
the ſamen Act and Declaration thairof,
that ſoverane and ſupreme powar, partaineth
to the King in materis eccleſiaſticall,
quhilk is worthie to be condemned,
and not to be cōtained amang chriſtian
actes, quhair the powar of the word
is to be extolled, aboue all the powar of
Princes, and them to be brought vnder
ſubiection to the ſamen.
            The ferd acte condemned the Preſbiterie
as ane iudgement not allowed by
the Kings law, quhilk is a very ſlender argument,
for as cōcerning the authoritie
of the preſbyterie we haif the ſamen expreſſed

in the Goſpel of Saint Matthew,
cap 18. quhair Chriſt cōmandes To ſhewe
the Kirk, quhilk authoritie, being cōmanded
by Chriſt, and the Actes of Parliament
forbidding it, we ſhuld rather obey
God than man. And ȝit the preſ-byterie
lackith nevir the Kings autoritie for the
allowance thairof from the beginning,
ſave onlie at that houre of darknes, quhē
he was abuſed through evill companie.
            As for any vther thing that is contained
in this act agains any order or proceding
of the preſbyterie, it is to be eſteemed
that no thing was done by the preſbyterie,
without wiſedome, diſcretion and
iudgement, and ſo hath receaved approbation
againe by the Kirk, quhairvnto
alſo I vnderſtand his Maieſtie hath giuē
allowance, ratified & approvid the ſame,
quhilk ſhuld be a ſufficient reaſon, to repreſſe
all mennes curioſitie, that ather
haue or ȝit wold finde fault with the
ſamme.
            The laſt article containes the eſtabliſhing

of ane Biſhop quhilk hath no warrand
of the word of God, but is grunded
vpon the policie of the invention of mā,
quhairvpon the primacie of the Pope or
antichriſt is riſen, quhilk is worthie to be
diſallowed & forbiddē, becaus the nomber
of the Elderſhip that hes iuriſdiction
and overſight aſwell of viſitation as admiſſion,
will doe the ſamyn far mair authenticklie,
godlie, & with greater zeale,
then a Biſhop, quhoiſe cair commōlie is
not vpon God and his dewtie, bot vpon
the warld, quhairvpō his chief attendāce
is. Conſider how that office hes bene vſed
theſe fiue húdreth ȝeiris begon, with
quhat crueltie and tyrannie it hath bene
exerciſed, ȝe ſall finde it to haif bene the
chief cauſe that hath in euerie countrie
ſuppreſſed the word of God: quhilk ſalbe
euident to all that read the hiſtorie of
the Kirk. As for my awen opinion, it ſeemeth
to be neareſt the trueth & fordeſt
from all kinde of ambition, that the Brithren
in equall degree, aſſemble thāſelfes

vnder thair head Chriſt, and thair everie
man diſcharge his office cairfullie as he
is commanded. And becaus weaknes of
memorie and ſeiknes ſuffer me noth at
length to diſcourſe theſe matters, as I
wold, I muſt requeſt the good reader, to
aſſure him ſelfe, that I haif written this
without cōpulſion or perſuaſion of any
man with ane vpright heart, and haif deliuered
the ſame with a perfit ſinceritie
of minde ſo farr as infirmitie of fleſhe
and blood doth ſuffer, as God ſhal iudge
me at the latter day, and that the ſame
reader accompt of quhat ſoevir thinges
are omitted, that then are to be imputed
to my imbecillitie of memorie, and
the preſent ſicknes, and not to my goodwill,
quhilk was (I proteſt) to half condemned
everie point, ȝea evin to the
falſe narration of the Bankit, and all the
reſt contained in that litle treatiſe called
The Kings Maieſties intention, according as
(I acknowledge) yen deſerue to be condemned
by the cenſure & iudgement of

the Kirk, To the quhilk always I ſubmit
my ſelfe in quhatſumevir thing I haif either
in word or wreitt attempted, either
in that forſaid Declaratioun or vtherwayes.
