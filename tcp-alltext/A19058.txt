            Of Humane Passions. The Preface.
            
               AS Prouident Nature hath prescribed certaine ends to all the Creatures of this Vniuerse, whom She hath clothed with certaine qualities and allurements fit to inflame them with their Loue; So there is not any one in this world but doth endeuor by all meanes to attaine vnto those ends which are propounded. As the Sunne hauing bin placed in the firmament, to contribute to the birth

and preseruation of Beasts and Plants; runnes continually from one Hemisphere to the other, to poure out the beames of his influence and light ouer all. So after his example, there is not any other cause in all this great World, but is carefull to seeke and pursue her end, according to the motions which Nature hath ingrafted. But to make them c
                  •
               peable, it was necessary that the same Nature which hath prescrib'd them their ends, should also giue them as it were two wings to raise them vp: That is to say, it was needefull she should impart vnto them the knowledge, and ingraf
                  •
                in them the inclination and desire to pursue them. Desire alone were not sufficient, for that is fashi
                  •
               
               ned in the Appetite; which is a blind power, and requires some

light to guide and conduct it in its motions; Euen as they say the Whale, which hath a weake and heauy sight, hath need of a guide to conduct it through the waues of the Sea, lest that this great and weighty masse which she drawes after her, should strike against some rocke and be crusht in peeces. Neither were knowledge alone sufficient, for that it proceedes from a faculty which being borne to giue light, doth necessarily presuppose another power, which doth receiue the beames of her light, and as we may say, suffers it selfe to be guided by that light. As for example, to cause the King (being incited by the glory of his Ancestors, or induced by the greatnesse of his courage) to vndertake the sacke of Constantinople, or to repl
                  •
               nt the Cross
                  •
               
               
in Palestina; it were not sufficient that he knew where Constantinople stood, or in what part of the world Palestina were; but besides all this it were needfull, that with this knowledge the heat and ardor to carry him to so glorious a Conquest should breede a desire. As in old time to thrust on Alexander to vndertake the voyage of Persia, or of the Indies, it was not onely requisite this Prince should haue some knowledge of that st
                  •
               tely Empire and of those rich Prouinces; But it was also necessary his generosity should beget in him a passion and will to conquer them. So as no man imbraceth any designe whatsoeuer, vntill that knowledge be vnited with desire, and desire ioyned vnto knowledge. In this manner then if things knewe

their ends and did not desire them, or if they desired them without the knowledge, they could not be drawne to endeuor to get them: For as much as through the want of those helps, they should be in danger to labor in vaine, and to lose all the paines of their pursuites. So as to effect it they had neede of knowledge and desire. The proofes hereof are seene in all the Creatures which make a part of this Vniuersall world. For leauing apart the Angels of heauen, whose actions show sufficiently that their substance is indued with an vnderstanding full of knowledge, and a will capable to frame diuers desires; if we will fixe our eyes vpon visible nature, we shall find that there is not any Creature, not onely among those that haue

life, but euen among those that haue no soules, in the motions and course of whose actions this truth doth not appeare and demonstrate it selfe plainely. It is true, that in things which are insensible and without life, it is not necessary that the knowledge of their ends should remaine in themselues, as the desires and inclinations to attaine vnto them do reside; but it sufficeth that they bee guided and conducted by a cause conioyned to their actions. And to returne to our last example, as it was necessary (to draw Alexander to vndertake the voyage of Asia and the Indies) he should haue knowledge of the Prouinces, yet he might borrow this knowledge from those which had seene them, and obserued them▪ euen as blind men, who led by their

guides go where their affaires do call them; euen so, although that naturall things which of themselues are not indued with any knowledge, besides the inclination which they haue vnto their end, haue yet some need to know it, to the end they may affect it and seeke it; yet hauing a desire▪ it imports not whether the knowledge be precisely in themselues, or that some other cause supplies this defect, and insinuates it selfe into this action to guide it. The reason whereof is, that although they be depriued of knowledge, yet it hinders not the force of their motions; for that they are vnited to that great intelligence which knoweth all things, and cannot erre in her knowledge, but guides all the naturall causes to their ends by her wise prouidence. But these

things haue alwayes neede of knowledge and desire, to put them into action, although that in regard of knowledge it is not absolutely necessary it reside in them, but it sufficeth that it be imparted vnto them by the influence and assistance of a more eminent cause. As for those which haue life, it may be plainly obserued in the course of their liues. But we must remember that the soule being the forme of liuing thinges, and naturall formes hauing this in particular, that the more Noble containes the perfection of that which is lesse Noble, as a quadrangle comprehendes with a certaine eminency, all that enters into the composition of a Triangle; and as the formes of beasts containe the formes of the Elements; It followes that

there beeing three degrees of Soules; that is to say, that which giues life, which is the lesse perfect; that which giues sense; which is the second ranke, and the Reasonable which is the noblest of all; this Reasonable soule which is peculiar onely to Man, containes all the powers and perfections of the other, and can effect as much as all the rest together. By reason whereof man hath a Vegetatiue soule, which is common with plants; he hath the sensitiue, which he hath common with bruit heasts; But he alone is in possession of the Reasonable soule, whereby he hath nothing common with the rest of the Creatures. After this, either of these soules hath a number of powers befitting the operations which must arise. The powers of the Vegetatiue

soule are principally those which nourish, which contribute to the growing and increase, and which serue to Generation: And those haue other powers for instruments to their actions, as the power to draw, the power to retaine, the power to expell the excrements, the power to disgest the nourishment, and others which Philosophers assigne vnto them.
            Moreouer, there is a power which is as it were the Queene of all the rest, to whose command and conduct they referre all their actions: And that is the power of the naturall Appetite, the which (as wee haue sayd) is one of those two things necessary to accomplish the actions of Nature. According vnto these Lawes we see that the power

we call Attractiue, drawes the nourishment vnto her, for that the Naturall Appetite doth presse and command her; and in like manner the power which they call Expulsiue, doth cast forth and expell those things which the same Natural Appetite doth abhorre; and so of the other Powers which are ordained to diuerse ends. But for that the Appetite which is blind and voyde of all Knowledge, is not sufficient in Vegetatiue things to exercise their action, but withall it is requisite that they be accompanied with Knowledge; it therfore happens that the Vegetatiue soule being not so Noble that among all her powers, there is not any one indued with Knowledge: the vniuersall Nature which prouides for all,

supplies this defect, and conducts by her Light the inclination of Vegetatiue substances to their ends, and by the same meanes guides all the other powers which follow her motions in their actions. So as Nature knowing the substance fitting and proper for the Nourishment, shewes it and instructs the Naturall Appetite, and ordaines that it shalbee drawne and disgested, and conuerted into Nourishment for the preseruation of the Vegetable Indiuidue; and the like may bee sayd of the other actions; wherein doubtlesse liuings things diff

               r not much from those that haue no life, And we must not obiect that Plants seeme to bee indued with Knowledge, for that they can distinguish a Iuic
                     •
                  
                which is proper for them, from

that which is pernitious, the which seemes to bee a marke of Knowledge; for although there were Pilosophers which did a
                  •
               
               tribute vnto Plants a feeling of things, which they sayd was lesse pure and lesse actiue then that of Creat
                     ••
                  es: Yet it is most certaine that the Nature of the Vegetatiue soule is too earthly, to bee fit for the functions of the Sences, which require oth
                  ••
                
               Organs then those of the Plants. And therefore although they draw vnto them good Iuice, and reiect the bad, it proceeds not from any Knowledge wherewith they are indued, but from their Naturall vertues
               ▪ and properties, guided by that Soueraigne Intelligence which disperseth her care ouer al the Creatures how base and abiect soeuer: And it is also by

her motion that the same Plants fly their Contraries, as the Vine shunnes the Bay tree; and that they shew such grace & beauty in their workes, as we see in the Spring time; So as all these things bind vs not to beleeue▪ that they are indued with Knowledge.
            
            But let vs returne to our discourse, and (leauing the Vegetatiue soule) ascend a degree higher, and come to the Sensitiue. This as the more Noble hath in her selfe the possession of Knowledge and hath no need to borrow it, like vnto the Vegetatiue soule,

            The Knowing powers are of two sorts, that is to say, the Exterior and the Interior. The Exterior are the fiue sences of Nature, as Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting, & Touching; the which as messengers

qualities wherewith they are clothed. The Interior powers capable of Knowledge are three, whereof the first is the Common sence, the which is called by that name, for that it is as it were the Center, to which doe flow the formes which are sent vnto it from the other sences: So as from the Eyes it receiues the formes of Colours which they haue seene: From the Hearing the formes of Sounds which haue toucht the Eare; from Smelling the formes of Sauors which it hath sented; from the Tongue, the forme of Sweetnesse or Bitternesse which it hath tasted; and from the body the formes o

               to

it, but it also Compares them, Discernes them, and Iudgeth of them; the which the particular sences cannot do, for that they are limitted and tyed to their particular obiects, and neuer exceed the bounds thereof.
            For the Eyes are onely imployed to iudge of the difference of Colours, as betwixt White and Blacke, and neuer seeke to 
                  •
               eddle with that which concernes the Sound, Smelling, or the other Qualities which haue nothing common with Colours. The Common sence then is necessary to iudge thus generally of all the obiects of the other Sences, that by meanes thereof the Creature may distinguish that which is healthfull from that is hurtfull.
            
            
               But to the end the Knowledge, which this sence doth gather from the Obiects
               ▪ whose formes are presented vnto it by the Exterior sences, be not lost by their absence, it sends all it hath gathered Compared and Distinguished, to another Power meerely Knowing, which is called the Imaginatiue; as that wherein are grauen the formes of things which are offred vnto it by the Common sence, to the end the Knowledge may remaine after they are vanished away. Besides this Imaginatiue, there is another power proper to preserue things, which is the memory, the which although it bee not directly ordained to Iudge but rather to serue as a Store-house and Treasury to shut vp, and to preserue the formes of things

which are imprinted in her; yet for that she doth continually represent vnto the Common sence the formes which are consigned vnto her, she may well bee sayd also to helpe to Knowledge. These then are the three Interior powers capable of Knowledge, to the which although that some adde others, yet I wil hold with their opinion who not willing to multiply the powers without necessity, reiect them as superfluous, seeing the Imaginatiue power sufficeth to do all the offices which are attributed vnto them. There are then in the Sensitiue soule eight knowing faculties, fiue Externall, and three Internall as we haue shewed.
            As for the Appetitiue powers where the desires are formed, there are but two, that is to

say, the Concupiscible or desiring power, and the Irascible or Angry power: The one of which without the other sufficeth not for the health of the Creatures. For if the Lyon had no other inclination, nor any other spurre of desire then to runne after meate fit for his nourishment, doubtlesse the least difficulty and obstacle he should incounter, would hinder the pursuite of his prey; for that hee should be without any desire to surmount this difficulty, and so he should not be able to preserue his life for want of nourishment.
            In like manner men would bee daunted for the least crosses they should finde in the pursuite of any good thing, or in the auoiding of euill; and although the danger were not great nor vrgent,

yet would they not dare to oppose themselues and incounter it: And so they would yeeld to these difficulties, and not pursue the obiects of their desires, how great soeuer their inclination were to seeke them. Wherefore prouident Nature to preuent this inconuenience, besides the other powers, hath giuen vnto the Sensitiue soule two Appetites, that is to say, the Concupiscible and the Irascible; whereof this last, when as any difficulty ariseth and opposeth it selfe to the desire of the Concupiscible, comes presently to succour it; and inflaming the blood, excites Choler, Hope, Courage, or some other like Passion destinated and ordained to make him surmount the difficulties which crosse the contentment of the Soule. For

that which concernes the powers of the Sensitiue soule, there remaines none but the faculty mouing from one place to another, which is disperst and resides in the sinnewes, Muscles and Ligaments, and which is dispersed ouer all the members of the Creature. This Power being commanded by the Appetite, doth presently exercise his office, seruing for an instrument to that part of the blood which for the great subtility and purenes thereof hath gotten the name of Spirit.
            
            To come now to the Reasonable soule, it hath two principall Powers, the one indued with Knowledge, which is the vnderstanding; and the other capable of Desire, which is the Will; the which being blind as all the Appetites are naturally,

she followeth in the pursuite of her obiects, the light of the vnderstanding, by reason whereof she is termed the Intellectuall Appetite, but more properly the Will. The office of our vnderstanding, particularly of that which we call possible, is to receiue, and in receiuing to know, and in knowing to offer vnto the will those kinds or formes, which are sent vnto it from the Imagination. It is true, that being a more Noble power then the Sensitiue, it cannot receiue those Images and formes, so materiall, grosse and sensible, as they are of themselues in their particular being, for that they are not proportionable to the purity and excellency of her condition. By reason whereof the Philosophers haue placed in our soules another

               power wonderfully Noble, whose office is to purge and to clothe as it were with a new Lustre, all the Images or formes which are found in the Imagination or fantasie; and by the meanes of this Light, to cause those formes which were Materiall, Sensible, and Singular, to become so purified from these earthly conditions as they seeme Vniuersall, and so well proportioned to the purenesse of our vnderstanding, as they easily receiue the impression. Thus then the powers of all the three Soules concurre in man in regard of the Rationall, the which as more Noble then the Sensitiue or Vegetatiue, comprehends all their powers, and withall addes many things to their perfection. In the meane time, wee must consider that

man hath no kind of command, neither ouer the powers of the Vegetatiue soule, whose actions are meerely naturall; nor ouer those of the Sensitiue soule, which are destinated to Knowledge, as the Interior and Exterior sences; vnlesse it bee by accident, when as by a resolution of his will; hee denies these powers the meanes which are necessary to put them in action; but hee may well haue power ouer those of the Sensitiue Appetite, which are proper to obey the discourse of reason, and the command of the Will, as ouer the Irascible and Concupiscible.
            
            To the end then that amidst the bond of the Intellectuall powers with the Sensitiue; and the communication, and correspondency which is betwixt

them for the exercise of their functions, we may the better see how the lesse Noble, obey and serue the more Noble, and execute their offices, wee must heere represent the forme. As soone as the Exterior sences, busied about the Obiects which are proper for them, haue gathered the formes of things which come from without, they carry them to the common sence, the which receiues them, iudgeth of them, and distinguisheth them; and then to preserue them in the absence of their obiects, presents them to the Imagination, which hauing gathered them together, to the end she may represent them whensoeuer need shall require, she deliuers them to th
                  •
                custody of the Memory; from whence retiring them when occasion requires, she propounds

them vnto the Appetite, vnder the apparance of things that are pleasing or troublesom, that is to say, vnder the forme of Good and Euill; and at the same instant the same formes enlightned with the Light of the vnderstanding, and purged from the sensible and singular conditions, which they retaine in the Imagination, and insteed of that which they represented of particular things, representing them generall; they become capable to be imbraced by the vnderstanding; the which vnder the apparance of things which are profitable or hurtfull, that is to say, vnder the forme of Good and Euill, represents them vnto the Will: the which▪ being blind referres it selfe to that which the vnderstanding proposeth

vnto it: And then as Queene of the powers of the soule she ordaines what they shall imbrace, & what they shal fly as it pleseth her▪ whereunto the Sensitiue Appetite yeelding a prompt obedience to execute her command from the which it neuer st
                  •
               aies, so long as it containes it selfe within the bounds and order prescrib'd by Nature, quickneth all the powers and passions ouer which shee commands, and sets to worke those which are necessary to that action, and by their meanes commands the mouing power; dispersed ouer all the members, to follow or fly, to approch or to recoyle, or to do any other motion which it requireth. And shee obeying suddenly if shee bee not hindred, moues, the whole body with the Organs which reside in the

parts, and induceth them to fly or imbrace things according to the command which she hath receiued.
            After this manner Man proceeds in his free operations, if he will obserue the order which he ought. The which I say, for that oftentimes 
                  •
               ee ouerthrows and peruerts this order, either by bad education, or by custome, or the organs being vnsound, or for that his will hath bad inclination; so as reason cannot enioy her power, & subiect the Sensuall Appetite vnto her; but contrariwise hee abandons himselfe in prey vnto this disordered Appetite, and suffers himselfe to bee transported by his furious motiōs. So as suddenly when as fantasie offers to the Appetite, the formes which shee receiues from the

               Sences, vnder the shew of Good or Euill; he without stay to haue them iudged by the discourse of vnderstanding, and chosen by the will, comm
                  •
               nds of himselfe the mouing power, & makes it to act according to his pleasure. And herein consistes the disorder which the passions cause in the life of man, which diuert him many times from the lawes of Reason. But wee haue spoken enough hereof, let vs now enter into the subiect, and beginne by the definition of passions to know their Nature and Essence.

            A Table of Humaine Passions.
            
               CHAPTER 1. Wherein is expounded what Passion is.
               
                  SEeing there can be no better order obserued, to expresse the nature of things, then to beginne by the definitions, which haue vsually giuen vs a full light of their essence, wee must enter into this treaty of passions, by the definition which Philosophers

giue. That which is called passion, say they, is no other thing, but a motion of the sensitiue appetite, caused by the apprehensiō or imagination of good or euill, the which is followed with a change or alteration in the body, contrary to the Lawes of Nature. Whereby it appeares, that passions, to speak properly, reside onely in the sensitiue appetite, and that they are not fashioned but in the irrationall part of the soule: so as if we should giue the name of passions to the motions of the vnderstanding, or of the will; it is by a kind of improper and figuratiue speech, alluding to the passions of the senses, with the which they haue some resemblance. The reason why

passions are not found in the rationall part of the soule, is, for that this part doth not imploy any corporeal organs in her actions, and that her office is not to alter or bring any change vnto the body; the which notwithstanding, is an action which doth accompany the passions inseparably. But seeing they are not to be found in any other part of the soule, but in the sensitiue appetite: there riseth heere a great question, whether this appetite shalbe diuided into the irascible & concupiscible or desiring power, as into two different and distinct powers, or whether it makes but one power of both. The common opinion is, that as their obiects are diuers, so they are two

distinct powers: whereof the reason is gathered, by that which experience doth shew vs in all other things subiect to corruption; for we see in other corruptible creatures, that they haue not onely an inclination and power to seek after those things which are fit and conuenient for them, and to flie those which may hurt or anoy them; but moreouer, they haue another faculty or power, to resist and fight against that which may crosse their actions, or destroy their beeing. As for example, fire is not onely indued with lightnesse, to flie vp high, but it hath also receiued heate from nature, by meanes whereof, it doth resist and fight against any thing that is contrary to

his action. In like manner it was necessary for the good of man, that hee should haue two kindes of inclinations, the one to pursue those things which are pleasing & agreeable to the senses, and to auoyde those which may any way anoy him: and this we call the concupiscible or desiring power; and the other, by meanes whereofhee may incounter and vanquish whatsoeuer opposeth it selfe, crosseth his inclinations, or that tends to the destruction of his being, or the decay of his contentment, which is that wee call the irascible or angry power. This differs from the concupiscible, for that the concupiscible tends to the sensible good, absolútely considered, and without

any crosses; whereas the irascible doth alwayes aime at the good which is inuironed with some difficulty, the which she striues to vanquish to the end shee may take all obstacles from the concupiscible power, which crosse her content, and hinder her from enioying the good which she desires to attaine vnto: so as the irascible is as a sword and target to the concupiscible, for that she combates for her content, and resists any thing that may crosse her.
               There are many things proue, that they are two different and distinct powers: For as Mathematicians hauing noted diuers apparent irregularities in the Planets, and obserued, that they seem sometimes to hasten their

course, and sometimes to slacke it; sometimes they stand as it were fixed, and sometimes to returne backe in the Zodiaque; sometimes they seem neare to the earth, & sometimes they appear far off; they haue held it necessary to multiply their heauens, and to giue them many to auoyd all disorder in these excellent bodyes of the Vniuerse. In like manner the diuersity of passions in man, the contrary motions & desires, wherewith his soule is tost, haue let philosophers vnderstand, that there is in him not onely a concupiscible power, but also an irascible: for that many times we haue a desire of that which wee striue against, and resist with vehemency; and if wee suffer

our selues to be vanquished, wee are grieued; as hee who desiring to see the bodies of such as had beene executed, suppressed this desire, and diuerted his eies from this infamous spectacle, yet suffering himselfe to bee vanquished by his curiosity, and hauing cast his eyes thereon, witnessed his griefe and sorrow which remained, to haue giuen so brutish a contentment to his eyes. Whereby it appeares, that desire and anger are two diuerse faculties, seeing that one power is not carried at one instant to contrary desires. And we finde in our selues, that often times wee are inclined to angry passions, & are not much mooued with those of the concupiscible, or to the contrary.

In like manner there are creatures which haue desires, but no motions of choler: as for example, Sheepe, Pigeons, and Turtles, make shew to haue impressions of desires, and yet there appeareth in them no signe of anger. So as to obserue their dispositions well, we may call in question that which Aristotle saith, that there is no creature but hath some touch of choler: finally wee may obserue, that sometimes the irascible makes vs to pursue things which are absolutely contrary to the concupiscible, as when with the hazzard of life (which is so deere and precious to all creatures) we seeke to reuenge our selues of a powerfull enemy which hath wronged vs. For this

reuenge which puts our life in danger, cannot proceede from the same power which desires passionately to preserue it: and so the irascible and concupiscible, are two different powers. And there is no part of passion properly taken, but in these two sensitiue faculties, which is one of the things wee gather from the definition wee haue giuen.
               It appeares also by the same definition, that the passions of our soule should alwayes bee followed with a sensible alteration in the body, by the impression of the sensitiue appetite, touched with the imaginatiō of good or euill, which presents it selfe. And here first we must not wonder if the 
                     •
                  oule doth

impart her motions, and causeth such great alteration in the body, seeing that the body doth impart his paines, when as it suffers any violence. For if it be laid on the racke, broken on a wheele, or cast into the fire, the soule grones vnder the burden of his torments: the which happens, for that beeing vnited as forme and matter, and making but one body which growes from their vnion; of necessity all things must bee common vnto them, except those things which repugne, and cannot agree with their particular natures; and therfore by a certaine contagion they communicate their passions one vnto another. But in this subiect there is a stronger reason for the which

the soule excites these alterations in the body by her passions, that is to say, for that the soule doth not onely reside in the body as the forme, but doth preside there in quality of the moouing cause, by meanes whereof, she doth change and alter it at her will. For as the intellectuall power, which mooues a heauen, applying her vertue to mooue it, makes it to change place, and drawes it from East to West, or from West to East, euen so the soule which hath a moouing power commanding ouer the body, changeth his naturall disposition, and by her agitation puls him from his rest, wherein hee was before shee troubled him; in this manner.
               
                  Moreouer, wee must not wonder if the sensitiue appetite in particular, make so great an impression in the body. This proceedes from the sympathy which is found in those powers, which are gouerned by the same soule which imployes them: so as the sensitiue appetite, comming to play her part, shee doth stirre vp the mouing faculty of the heart, the which dilates it selfe, or shrinkes vp, according to the nature of the obiects which haue made impression vpon the sensitiue appetite, whence grow al the alterations which are made in the body of man. And here we must remember, that nature hath fashioned the heart in such sort, as it is in perpetual motion, according

vnto which it sometimes extendes it selfe, and sometime retires of it selfe, with a certaine measure and proportion; the which continuing within the bounds which nature hath prescribed it, as conformable vnto the condition of the creature, this motion is wholy naturall: but if it once come to breake this law, and shew it selfe more violent, or more slow, then the nature of the creature requires, the naturall harmony is broken, and there followes a great alteration in the body of the creature.
               Of all the powers of the soule, those of the sensitiue appetite onely cause the alteratiō of this motion, whose actions alone may make it more violent, or more slowe,

then the lawes of nature doe allow. And hence it comes, that none but the actions of the sensitiue appetite are made with a visible change of the body, and with a sensible alteration of the naturall constitution. Yet as in this change the heart receiues an alteration, so the spirits, the blood, and other humours, are agitated and mooued beyond ordinary, the which doth wholy trouble the naturall constitution of the creature. The which happens after this manner: The obiects of the senses strike first vpon the imagination, and then this power hauing taken knowledge of thē, conceiues them as good or bad, as pleasing or troublesome, and importune: then

afterwards propounds them as clothed with those qualities to the creature, which apprehending them vnder this last cōsideration excites the concupiscible, or irascible power of the soule, and induceth them to imbrace or flye them, and by the impression of its motion, agitates the spirits which we cal Vitall, the which going from the heart, disperse themselues throughout the whole body, and at the same instant the blood which deriues frō the liuer, participating in this agitatiō, flowes throughout the veynes, and casts it selfe ouer all the other parts of the body: So as the heart and liuer beeing thus troubled in their naturall dispositions, the whole body f
                     •
                  eles

it selfe mooued, not onely inwardly, but also outwardly, according to the nature of that passiō which doth trouble it. For in motions of ioy and desire, the heart melts with gladnesse. In those of sorrow and trouble, it shrinks vp and freezeth with griefe. In those of choler and resolution, it is inflamed and all on fire. In those of feare, it growes pale and trembling. A Louers words are sweete and pleasing, and those of a cholerick man are sharpe and rough: Finally, there riseth no passion in the soule, which leaueth not some visible trace of her agitation, vpon the body of man.
               Lastly, wee may gather from the definition of passion that this alteration which

happeneth in the body, is contrary to the lawes of nature, for that (as we haue said) it transports the heart beyond the bounds, which nature hath prescribed it, and doth agitate it extraordinarily.
               Hence it growes, that amōg al the motiōs of the sensitiue appetite, those only are prop
                     ••
                  ly called passiōs, which are accompanied with some notable defect. For as we call passions of the body diseases, wounds, paines, inflammations, incisions, and all other violent accidents which happen extraordinarily: So wee properly call passions of the soule, those infirmities wherewith she is afflicted and troubled; as pittie, feare, bashfulnesse, or shame, loue, hatred,

desires, Choler, and the rest.
               For, in this subiect the word Passion, is not taken in that sense, whereas wee say that a subiect suffers, when as it receiues some new forme, bee it that at the comming of this forme, it lose any thing of its owne or not, as when the ayre is enlightned with the Sunne beams, without losing any thing of her first constitution: nor in that sense, wherein we say, that a subiect suffers, when as it receiues a new quality which doth expell another, whether it bee concurrent to its nature, or contrary vnto it, as when water growes cold, or is made hot.
               
                  But the word Passion is taken here for a change, which is made in man, contrary to his naturall constitution and disposition, from the which hee is as it were wrested by this change. In which sense the Phylosophers say, that things suffer, when as they are drawne from their naturall disposition, to a course that is contrary to their nature.
               In the mean time you must not wonder, if we ground the irregularity of the change, which these passions breed, vpon the disorder which the sensitiue appetite (stirred vp by the sensible obiects) casts into the heart, being a thing which wee must constantly beleeue, that this power of the soule, bee it the irascible

or cōcupiscible, hath its se at and mansion in the heart: The which cannot be denied in the subiect of feare, for that such as are transported therwith, call back the blood and heate vnto the heart, as to the place where feare doth exercise her tyranny, therewith to defend themselues: considering also that those creatures which haue the greatest and largest hearts, are most fearefull, for that their heate is more dispersed, and consequently lesse able to resist the assaults of feare. Some haue not beleeued, that it was so of other passions, but haue appointed thē their seates else-where, and haue maintained, that some did reside in the liuer, others in the spleene, and some in

the gall; & as for anger, they haue lodged it in the gall, whereas choler resides, which doth inflame it. But they haue giuen loue his quarter in the liuer, for that the sāguine cō
                  plexion is inclined to loue: & for ioy, they haue seated it in the Spleen, for that melancholy proceeds from the distemperature of this part. But notwithstanding this, it is most certaine, that both the powers of the sensitiue appetite, I mean the Irascible, and Concupiscible, reside in the heart; the which beeing the fountaine of life, & of all vital operations, must also bee a lodge & retraite to those appetites which nature hath gigiuē the creature to preserue his life, & to chase away those perils which may threaten it.

Wherby we see, that the passiōs of desire or anger, are felt presētly in the heart, & trouble the natural cōstitution as soon as they rise; wherby followeth a strange alteration throughout the whole body, for the springs cānot be troubled but the streams wil feele of it. And therefore the passions being too vehement, and making a violēt impressiō vppō the hart, they cause strāge accidents in man. As for exāple, a furious anger drawing the heate violently from the heart, to those parts which are most remote frō the Center of life, and by the same meanes inflaming choler, which by her naturall lightnes mounts vp to the braine, may depriue mā of the vse of reason, & make him furious and mad.
               
                  In like manner an extraordinary feare, drawing the spirits and heate forcibly to the heart, whereas she meanes to fortifie her selfe against her enemy, may quench the natural heate, and suffocate the man: shame may doe the like, whereof we haue prodigious examples in histories, which testifie, that great personages haue died with shame and griefe, for that they could not find the knot, or expound certaine riddles or difficult questions, which had beene propounded vnto them: yea, they say, that great ornament and Gemme of Phylosophy Aristotle, died with griefe, for that he could not finde the cause of the flowing and ebbing of Eurypus. Whereby it appeares,

that the heart which is thus opprest by Passions, when they are violent, is the seate of both the powers of the sensitiue appetite, that is to say, of the Irascible, and Concupiscible. And whereas they obiect to the contrary, that Choller resides in the Gall, inferring thereby that the Irascible power should reside there also: It is easily answered, for that the Choller which remaines in the Gall, is not the reason for the which Anger is inflamed, but for that it is a hot and dry humor, the which are fit qualities to produce that effect. The like may be sayd of Loue, and that the aboundance of bloud doth not make men more inclined to the Passions of loue, forthat the Concupiscible
                  
power resides in the liuer, which is the place where the blood takes his forme; but for that they which are of a sanguine complexion, haue a hot and moist temperature▪ which is proper to that passion. And as for ioy wee cannot conclude that it resides in the Spleene, for that it being infirme, many are opprest with melancholly; for the reason why melancholly doth torment them which are troubled with the Spleene, is not for that ioy resides there, but for that adust choller preuailing, causeth a troublesome and importune heauines.
               Yet we will not so restraine these two powers, within the bounds and extent of the heart, but wee will confesse,

that although they haue their chiefe residence there, yet they disperse themselues through the whole creature; whereof wee haue good proofe in Lizards, which being cut in peeces, feele paine in all the parts where they are offended. For the last of our obseruations vpon the subiect of passions, it remaines to shew, whether of the concupiscible and irascible powers, bee the more noble and excellent: some giue the preheminence to the concupiscible, for that it is destined to serue the soule, and to make it enioy the obiects of her passions. The which made Aristotle to say, that beasts put themselues into choller, and fight for their desires. But this reason doth nothing

abase the Irascible power, but contrariwise it shewes how much it is more excellent then the Concupiscible.
               
               For as those souldiers are most valiant which maintaine the shocke of a battaile, and defend the weaker; euen so by consequence, the Irascible power must haue more generosity then the concupiscible, seeing she is ordained by nature for her defence. And as the noblest vertues, are formed in the most excellent powers, so we see that force or valour, which resides in the Irascible, is a more worthy and more commendable vertue then temperance which hath her seat in the Concupiscible. We finde also that it is more shamefull not to bridle the

motions of the Concupiscible, then those of the Irascible, for that these are lesse offensiue to reason. In regard whereof we blame them more which abandon themselues to pleasure and voluptuousnes, then those which are subiect to motions of choller.
               
            
            
               Of the Number of Passions. CHAP. 2.
               
                  AS they that haue treated of the Nature of the Winds haue written diuersly, some setting foure, others eight, some eleauen, and some two and

thirty, to the which they assigne diuers points in the horizon: So the Philosophers which discourse of the Passiōs of the Soule, agree not of the number, some naming more, some lesse. Yea there was an Ancient affirmed, that as there are many Passions, whereof we know the names, so there are an infinite number which we know not.
               Wherefore hee compared man to one of the monsters of antiquity, which they represent vnto vs, composed of the members, and formes of diuers creatures: for that his Cupidities and Passions are so prodigious, and so many in number, as they are able to amaze any one, that shall iudiciously consider of the multitude and diuersity.
               
                  First of all, there were some which haue beleeued, that as there were foure chiefe winds which excite diuers stormes, be it at land or sea; so there are foure principall Passions which trouble our Soules, and which stir vp diuers tempests by their irregular motions, that is to say Pleasure, Paine, Hope, & Feare: and in truth these foure haue as it were the Empiry ouer all the rest, which propound themselues as the obiects of their motions; for whatsoeuer men do, either they feare or desire, or afflict themselues, or are contented; which be the effects of these Passions. Others will haue onely two, that is to say, Pleasure and Paine; and some assigne but one, and that is

                  Loue, to the which they refer all the rest as to their center and roote. Others haue multiplied them, and haue made twelue, and some eleauen. Amidst this diuersity of opinions, that is the tr
                     •
                  est which is receiued at this day, and imbraced by all those that make an exact profession of Philosophy: that is to say, that there are eleauen primitiue and generall Passions, whereof all the rest are but as it were budds and branches. These generall Passions are, Loue, Hatred, Desire, Flight, Pleasure, Paine, Feare, Courage, Hope, Despaire and Choller. And thus the Philosophers finde out the number. Of Passions, say they, some regard the good or euill absolutely and simply

considered. And these belong to the Concupiscible power. Others regard the good or euill accompanied with some difficulty, and they appertaine vnto the irascible: those of the Concupiscible power, are six in number, whereof three haue for their obiects the good, that is to say, Loue, Desire, and Pleasure; and the other three haue for their obiect the euil, that is to say, Hatred, Flight, and Paine: for presently that the obiect which hath the forme of good, offers it selfe vnto the Concupiscible power, shee presently feeles herselfe surprized, and Loue is framed. If this obiect bee present, she receiues Pleasure and Delight: if it bee absent, she is toucht with a Desire to enioy it. And in like manner

as soone as the obiect presents it selfe vnto the selfe same power, vnder the shew of euill, it doth presently stirre vp a hatred contrary to loue: and if during this horror it bee absent, then Flight or Au
                        •
                     rsion, contrary to desire discouers it selfe: but if it bee present, she then conceiues griefe. In this manner we finde out the number of the passions which reside in the concupiscible power: those of the irascible are but fiue, as feare, courage, hope, despaire, and choller: for if the obiect which hath some shew of good, presents it selfe being accompanied with difficultie, and that man conceiues with himselfe that notwithstanding all that, it is in his power to obtaine

it, then hope is framed; but if there bee no likelyhood, despaire pulls him back and diuerts him. And touching that which regards the good wee enioy, there is no passion in the irascible that concernes it, seeing that which is in our power is not accompanied with any difficulty, neither is it needfull the irascible shoulde mooue or worke for this subiect. But if the euill which presents it selfe, be ful of horror and difficulty, it must either be present or absent; if it be absent, it excites courage or feare; Cour
                        •
                     ge, if wee striue to surmount it; and feare, if we apprehend it as too doubtfull. If it bee present, it inflames choller which carries vs to reuenge, to repell the iniurie

that is done vs. And thus wee finde out the number of the Passions of the irascible power, the which with the six of the Concupiscible, make eleauen in a
                     •
                  l. But wee must remember, that notwithstanding this determined number, yet wee finde as it were a swarme of others, which notwithstanding take their beginning, and spring from these, as we haue obserued. In this number the Philosophers put Bitternes, Enuy, Emulation, Shamefastnes, Impudency, Mercy, Humanity, and a thousand others which were too long to relate. But for that there are some, without the knowledge whereof this treaty were imperfect, wee will speake of them according the exigence

of the subiect, when occasion shalbe offered: here it shall suffice to obserue, that as the generall Passions, regard their obiects without any restriction, but that of good or euill, which presents it selfe; so the more particular Passions, contained vnder these generall, regard the same obiects limitted to some speciall condition: as for example, Desire taken absolutly is a generall Passion, which regards the obiect of good, without any other limitation then vnder the apparance of good: but if wee come to prescribe bounds to this good, and that wee consider it vnder the forme of some particular good, be it of H
                        •
                     nor, of Riches, of Beauty, or of any other thing; the desire
                  
must also bee limited, and then it shall bee a desire of honor, which is called ambition; or a desire of riches, which we call couetousnes, or a desire of beauty, the which attributes vnto it selfe, the name of the gender, and is called loue. And the like may bee sayd of the other limitations of this obiect: so as these Passion of Loue, Riches, and Honor, are more particular Passions then the desire, which is as it were their gender and spring. So griefe taken absolutely is a Passion, which regards the obiect of euill in its generall extent, without any other limitation then that of euill. By reason whereof if this obiect come to bee restrained by vs to some speciall condition, as

to the misery or prosperity of another man, or to our owne infamy; then this griefe shall also be limited and restrained, and shall become a griefe for another mans misfortunes, and then it shalbee a compassion; or it shal bee a griefe for another mans prosperity, and then it sha
                     •
                  bee called an indignation or an enuie and despight: or else it will become a griefe for our owne infamy, and then it is a shame, and so of the rest. These Passions may bee infinite vnder the diuers limitations of obiects which are infinite, and therefore they can hardly bee rancked vnder a cert
                     •
                  ine science: neither haue they particular names, but borrow them from the limitation

which the obiect giues them; yet there are some which haue their proper names, as Enuy, Iealousie, Compassion, Shame: but the rest many times carry the name of their Genders.
               
               In the meane time a question is heere propounded, whence it comes that considering the obiect of the Concupiscible appetite, which containes the good and euill simply taken, that is to say, without shew of any difficulty added vnto it; wee haue put ioy as a Passion, which ariseth from the presence and enioying of the good, and griefe as a Passion which growes from the present euill which cannot be auoided; and yet considering the obiect of the Irascible power, which comprehends

the good which cannot be obtained but with difficulty, and the euill which cannot be auoyded but with paine, wee haue not set any Passion that riseth from the enioying of that good, or from the presence of that euill which cannot bee eschued. Whereunto we answere, that this difficulty were allowable, if these two appetits had their actions separated one from another; but they are alwayes vnited, and march ioyntly to the pursuit and enioying of good, and to the flight and auoyding of euill. So as the Irascible appitite neuer stirres but ioyntly with the Concupiscible, for that it is ordained to succor and assist it, whensoeuer there appeares any difficulty in the

obiect which he is to pursue or auoyd. In regard whereof, notwithstanding any difficulty that may be incountered in the fight or pursuite of this obiect, yet when it is obtained or auoyded, all the paine or difficulty which did enuiron it, vanisheth away, and is dispersed. It is not therefore necessary to ascribe any other Passions, which grow from the enioying or flight of this obiect, then the same which arise from the enioying or flight; when as there is no apparent difficultie which doth crosse the possession or make the auoyding difficult: and to the end wee may the better know what order these two appetites obserue in the execution of their offices, wee may

thus represent their motions, and the order of the Passions which are framed in the one, and the other. As soone as any obiect presents it selfe vnto the sensible power, vnder the forme of an apparent good: as for example, the beauty of a faire Hellen, whether that the acquisition be accōpanied with any difficulty or not, this beauty doth first of all stirre vp a passion of loue, from the which presently doth grow a desire which makes him seeke to enioy her; and if in this pursuite there appeare no difficulty, the possession wil be obtained without the assistance of the irascible appetite, whence will arise ioy or pleasure. But if during the heate of desire, there appeares

any difficulty to obtaine it, then if the Concupiscible appetite were not assisted, it would be danted with the least difficulty that should present it selfe, and would cease to desire the thing, or striue to enioy it: for this reason the Irascible to preuent this, causeth hope to arise to succour the concupiscible, which supports desire and makes him striue to attaine vnto it; and in this case it breedes no other ioy then that which had succeeded if it had bin obtained without any difficulty, considering that the enioying makes him forget all the precedent paines. But from the beginning and breeding of desire, or during the whole continuance thereof, bee it with hope, or without expecttance

of the enioying of the obiect, if it appeares to bee a thing absolutely impossible to enioy, then not to suffer desire to consume it selfe in a vaine pursuite, the Irascible stirres vp despaire, to the end the Concupiscible power may not spend it selfe in a designe which cannot succeed. And in like manner if an obiect presents it selfe vnto the appetiue power, vnder the forme of euill, as for example, a powerfull enemy prepares himselfe to wrong vs, then first of all hatred riseth in vs, and makes vs apprehend the euill which doth threaten vs apparantly, and then inclines vs to seeke the meanes to auoyd it, bee it in putting our selues in defence, or in retiring our selues and seeking

some shelter for this storme, or else in auoyding it by some other meanes, the which breeds in vs the Passion of flight, by the which wee vnderstand no other thing here▪ then our striuing to flie the euill. But in case that in this seeking of meanes to auoyde it there appeare not any difficulty, then the irascible power doth not trouble it selfe to assist the concupiscible. And for that to escape a danger and to auoyd a mischiefe is a kind of good, this happening it begets ioy. As on the other side if we fall into a misfortune which threatens vs, although there appeare not any difficulty in the auoyding, it will cause griefe. But if whilst I seeke meanes to auoyd the storme which

threatens me, I finde that I cannot doe it without paine and difficulty; then for that the least obstacles amaze and hinder the concupiscible power which neuer striues to surmount them, the irascible excites courage which goes to succour it, and supports the motion of this Passion, which wee terme flight or auersion from the thing, vntill the euill bee wholy auoyded and dispersed; and then ariseth the same ioy which had happened if it had not incountered any of these difficulties. And if amidst this resistance and striuing of courage, the euill doth notwithstanding ariue, then griefe is framed after the same manner as if this accident had happened without any incounter or difficulty.

But if whilest wee seeke the meanes to auoyde the euill, wee discouer much difficulty to preserue our selues, and that there approcheth an eminent danger to our persons, then the irascible doth succour vs with feare, which makes man discreet and aduised, to the end that his too great hardines may not precipitate him into the danger which hee would auoyd. Besides al this, when as the obiect which presents it selfe vnder the forme of good, seemes at the same instant impossible to be attained vnto, then not onely hope dies, but euen desire is banisht, so as the first Passion which then springs vp in vs is despaire, which the irascible stirres vp, to the end there should

grow no vaine desire, for that naturally no man desires things which are impossible, and vaine and vnprofitable actions are enemies to nature.
               As for the contrariety which may bee found betwixt some of these Passions, we must vnderstand that this contrariety may be considered after two manners, that is to say, either by reason of the diuers motions of the appetite which is inflamed; as for example, wee say that hope and despaire are contrary Passions, not in respect of their obiects, seeing they both regard the apparant good, vnder the condition of difficult obtaining, but by reason of the diuers motions they excite by their nature

in the appetite, for that hope striues to seeke and enioy the obiect, and despaire to flie from it and auoid it. Whence it growes that if we compare hope and cour
                        •
                     ge, we shall find them contrary Passions, not in regard of the motion of the app
                        •
                     tite, seeing that both agitate and stirre vp the spirit, and serue it as a spurre to make it more ready in the pursuit of th
                     •
                  ir obiect, but in respect of the obiect, for that hope lookes to the apparent good, and courage to the euill.
               
               In like manner fe are and despaire are contraries, by reason of their obiects, and not in regard of their motions, for that both serue rather to retire and stay the striuing of the appetite, then

to excite and stirre it vp. Next, desire and flight are contrary Passions, by both reasons together, considering that the one hath the good for obiect, and the other the euill. And moreouer desire stirres vp the appetite to seeke the obiect, whereas flight makes it retire to auoyd it. We may make the same comparisons of the rest of the Passions. But this will appeare more plainely when wee shall treat of them in particular.
            
            
               Of the quality of Passions, whether they be good or bad. CHAP. 3.

                  ▪ & dissenting from the common opinions of the world, haue maintained, that a Soul

                   in which vertue hath taken deepe roote, and which enioyes all the ornaments of true wisedome, should haue gotten such a power ouer all her motions, as it should neuer be transported with any perturbations. The reason

which moued them to this opinion, was, for that they held it an vnworthy thing for a wise and vertuous man to see himselfe subiect to the infirmities of the soule, which is the name they giue to Passions. But the Peripatitians haue held the contrary opinion, and did beleeue that it could not bee denied, but that the greatest Spirits, and most accomplished in vertue and wisedome, had sometimes a feeling of these Passions, the heate whereof wisemen knew how to bridle and restraine. And they ground their reason, for that they rise not in vs▪ by our election, but are as it were siences of Nature, which spring out of themselues. This controuersie hath seemed

to many great Personages to be more verbal then materiall. But whatsoeuer it bee, it is certaine that the wisest cannot exempt themselues from the motions of naturall Passions, and yet their vertue is nothing diminished or made lesse perfect. We must then remēber that these kinds of Passions may be considered in two manners, first in their particular extent, that is to say, as motions of the sensitiue appetite, which of it selfe is not indowed with any reason, and which is common to vs with beasts; and in this consideration they are neither commendable, nor blame worthy, seeing that the weight and merit of that which parts from our soule, depends

of reason: secondly, they may be considered in as much as reason may subiect them to her command and prescribe them a Law. And in this consideration they may bee good or bad, according to the quality of the will that gouernes them. So wee see both good and bad, feare, desire, and reioyce alike. But the wicked haue bad feares, wicked desires, & bad ioyes, whereas the good haue none but good feares, good desires, and good ioyes, for that the branches do alwaies participate of the nature of the roote. For although the sensitiue appetite of her owne quality be destitute of liberty, yet by reason of the strict vnion that it hath with the intellectuall and reasonable, it

doth participate as it were with a beame, and some kind of borrowed liberty, in regard whereof some haue maintained that it is capable of vertues, as of temperance and fortitude, which reside in this part of the soule.
               If the Stoicks had well obserued this consideration, they should haue seene that a wise man by the guide of reason may so moderate his Passions, as they may be commendable and worthy the profession hee makes of vertue. The which is nothing doubted of by Christian Philosophers, seeing that he who was neuer subiect to sinne, and whose soule was aduanced to the height of graces and vertues, had Passions and humane affections, the which

could neuer command ouer reason, or transport it, but receiue a law from it. But on the other side wee want no reasons to conuince and ouerthrow the opinions of the Stoickes. For first of all, vertue (how eminent soeuer) neuer ruines that which is wholy conformable to reason. But what is more reasonable then to see a man moued with pitty and compassion of his like, of his friends, or of his kinsman? what inhumanity were it for a mother to see her child in the throat of wild beastes, or exposed to shipwracke, or broken vpon a wheele, or torne in peeces by tortures, or only sicke of some violent infirmity, and not to haue her soule sensible of griefe?

would wee that a vertuous man should not bee touched with indignation to see crimes honored, and the wicked aduanced to the height of dignities? Shall we condemne the spurres of an honest emulation, wherewith he is toucht that reades the glorious exploits and vertuous actions of great Person

And who will beleeue that euer vertue (like vnto Polipus which eates his owne armes) will euer ruine her proper obiects? Who doth not know but the Passions of our soules are the obiects of many excellent vertues, which doe moderate them, and reduce them vnto reason when they seeke to flie out? Fortitude is nothing but a mediocrity betwixt feare & hardines: That is to say, it is nothing but a vertue by meanes wher

                  of we do moderate

our exceeding feare, and our immoderate boldnesse. Take then feare and hardines from fortitude, and it is no more a vertue. And by the same reason you ouerthrow all courage and magnanimity, whereof the one makes vs to vndertake the most terrible and difficult things with resolution, and the other giues vs a lustre in our greatest actions. You shall in like manner ouerthrow all patience, and perseuerance, whereof the one makes vs constantly and willingly to endure all the miseries of this life; and the other confirmes vs against all the crosses of this world, so as wee remaine inseparably 
                     〈◊〉
                   to that which wee hold conformable to reason; for

all these vertues haue for their obiect the Passions of the Irascible appetite. Temperance is no other thing, but a mediocrity which wee keepe in the pleasures of tast and feeling, and in the griefes and sorrowes which befall vs. That is to say, it is a vertue by meanes whereof wee gouerne our pleasures and paines. If then you take all pleasure and Paine from temperance, you giue it the name of vertue in vaine. And withall you put modesty and honesty out of the number of the vertues, whereof the one makes vs apprehend infamies and reproches; that is to say, induceth vs to flie whatsoeuer hath any shew of dissolution. And the other filling our soules with goodly

things done with a certaine grace, makes vs to flie whatsoeuer is filthy and worthy of reproch. You shall also put out of the same number of vertues, abstinency, Sobriety, chastity, and pudicity, whereof the two first moderate the delights of the mouth, and the other the pleasures of generation: For that all these ver
                     •
                  ues haue for their obiect the Passions of the concupiscible appetite.
               
               After all this the sensitiue appetite is a present of nature, which God (who is the Author) hath freely bestowed vpon vs; but vertue neuer destroyes nature, but addes vnto it the perfection which it wants. It must then suffer the sensitiue appetite to act according to his inclination,

yet moderating his motions and restrayning them vnder the lawes of reason. And without doubt it seemes the Stoicks haue not obserued in man any other composition then that of the body and the soule, and that they were ignorant of the diuersity of the intellectuall and sensitiue powers of reason, and of sensuality. For otherwise they would neuer haue suffered the sensitiue appetite to haue bene idle in man, as it must of necessity remaine, if it bee once freed from all motions of Passions. And as for those wonderfull praises they giue to a wise man, whom they imagine to bee freed from Passions, they are like vnto the stately titles which are giuen to great shipps, and to

all that rich equipage, and furniture wherewith it is adorned, and yet it is subiect to the fury of stormes, and suffers shipwracke as well as the smallest vessells. Wee haue alwayes seene those which haue made profession of this sect, grow pale and wanne, aswell as other men in dangers at sea or land; they are alwayes seene subiect to the common desires of men, and they haue in that regard more vanity then constancy. So as they haue bene forced to excuse these first motions, and to confesse that it was not in the power of man to suppresse them, but they would sometimes breake forth. What remaines then but to confesse that reason must gouerne them, and reduce

them to a mediocrity which is found in vertue? For as health doth not consist in the ruine of contrary qualities which are found in man, but in the temperature which a good constitution giues them: And as to make a perfect musique, wee must not take away the diuersity of tunes, but reduce them to a good accord to make the harmony perfect; so the striuings of vertue consistes not wholy to roote all naturall Passions out of the soule, but to moderate and gouerne them by the rule of reason. It is true, there are some Passions full of offence, and which wee detest to heare named, as Impudency, Enuy, Hatred; and these wee make no question but they

ought to bee supprest. But there are others whose very names are pleasing, as Pitty, Modesty, Honest Loue, and the like; and these need not any thing, but to receiue a tincture from reason and vertue, to make them altogether commendable.
               But to prescribe vs a man that is not moued with any Passion, were to depriue him of all humanity, and to make him a stone or a god. They that make profession of this proud and arrogant Philosophie, cannot but laugh when as they reade in the writings of Poets, that there hath bene men of that constitution, and as we may say, of that temper, that no swords, lanc
                     •
                  s, or other armes, could pierce them or wound their bodies.

And they that haue had most credit among them, haue derided those Philosophers which beleeued that there were certaine Ilands and Countries in the world, as Delos and Egypt, which had neuer felt the violence of earthquakes, and which had continued for euer immoueable, amidst the motions of all the other parts of the world. And these people paint vs out a wise man so perfect, so eminent, and so fortified with vertue, as all the stormes of Fortune, yea the most violent, Shipwrackes tortures, and infamies cannot make any impression in his soule; so as he continues immoueable in the midst of flames, wheeles, gibbets and all the fearefull horrors of death

and shame. What is hee that will not laugh at this strange vanity? But the Stoickes say, that it is a thing vnworthy of a wiseman adorned with perfect vertue, to see himselfe transported with passions, which are the diseases of the soule. Whereunto we answere, that Passions considered as they submit themselues vnto the lawes of reason, are no infirmities of the soule, but in that sence they are the instruments and obiects of vertue, and as it were liuely sparkes which inflame desires in our soules; and as Aristotle speakes, they are the armes of reason. It is true that (as one saith) the flowers of Egypt being continually charged and watered with the

Vapor of Nilus (which are grosse and earthly) ye
                     ••
                  d not such pleasant smelles as they would do without this obstacle: euen so soules troubled with Passions, cannot produce the vertuous actions which they would do without this agitation: for that the motions and impressions which they make in our soules are like vnto the force of a violent torrent, which teares vp stones, ouerthrowes plants, and drawes after it whatsoeuer opposeth it selfe against his violence; for that they quench the reason, depriue vs of iudgement, smother the vnderstanding, and suffer not any image of vertue in a soule that is transported. But this happens to those which abandon themselues

wholy to Passion; and not vnto these who like vnto wise pilots prepare against a storme, and when it comes endeauour to auoid it, not loosing his iudgement in an accident which terrifies others. Wee tame Elephants, Tigers, Lyons, Panthers, and other sauage beasts, and are not moued: and will they not allow vs a power to suppresse the brutishnesse of the sensitiue appetite, and to moderate the Passions when as they aduance themselues against reason, without great perturbation?
               Finally, when as these motions of Passions preuent the reason and anticipate all the resolutions of man, wee cannot hold them bad, seeing they are meere motions of

nature without any shew of liberty. And it is most certaine that not onely an ordinary wisedome is subiect thereunto, but euen the most excellent soules, (I speake not of those which haue speciall guifts from God) yea those that are indued with Heroicall vertues, feele agitation; seeing that vertue how eminent soeuer, cannot so subiect the sensitiue appetite, (ouer which she doth not command as a slaue, but as a Cittizen) but it will anticipate the Empire of reason. And this the Stoickes are forced to confesse, seeing they affirme that it is not in the power of a wise man to free himselfe from perturbation, when as some fearefull formes presents themselues

suddenly to his eyes, so as whatsoeuer he doth in those accidents, hee will grow pale, he will be amazed, and his heart will shrinke vp. Yet, say they, all this will happen without consenting to these motions, for that it is in his power not to consent. They adde, that there is this difference betwixt a wiseman and one that is distracted: for that an vnreasonable man yeilds to passions and obayes them wholy; whereas the wiseman although he suffers the motions, yet hee resists them still, and generously preserues in his soule the lawes and loue of vertue; heerein truely they approach neere to the doctrine which we teach. But we must still remember that the office of

reason is not to pull out of the soule of man, all the rootes of Passions, neither were it expedient or necessary she should do it: But her duty is to prescribe them their bounds, and to reduce them to a mediocrity as vertue requires. As for example, let vs presuppose a brother which hath lost his brother whom hee loued passionately, and they coniure him not to lament for this losse, not to afflict himselfe, nor to shew any signe of mourning to preserue the reputation of a wiseman and absolutely vertuous. Is it not rather a meere stupidity then a true constancy? They that make these discourses shew that either they haue no naturall disposition, or

else they neuer fell into these calamities: otherwise so sensible a griefe wold haue pulled out of their spirits this arrogant Philosophie; and had forced them to confesse that humanity cannot suffer them to remaine insensible at such cruell accidents. In the meane time as these Passions preuenting reason, cannot be held good nor bad, so when as they suffer themselues to be moderated and gouerned by reason, they get vs great commendations; whereas when they flie out and exceed the bounds of vertue, they procure vs nothing but blame and infamy. To conclude, Passions are in the soule, as the sinnews in the body; for as by meanes of sinnewes we extend

the members
                  ▪ so by the operations of Passions, wee carry our selues to good or euill, and if wee will imploy them to good, they are as it were spurres and obiects: But if wee turne them to euill, our sensuality makes vse of them; like vnto him that keepes a slaue, who makes vse of his chaine to draw him where he pleaseth. So as the triumph of vertue consists not in pulling away or rooting out the Passions, as monsters; but in ruling and reforming them like vnto insolent and disobedient children▪ for they grow in vs and are as the fruits & buds of our sensuality, which haue onely need to be made subiect vnto reason. Finally, they that haue any other opinion must remember,

that wee cannot wholy pull away the defects which proceed from nature: And that may by our industry correct and moderate that which is borne with vs, but not vanquish it and suppresse it wholy; wherefore wisedom may not promise vnto it selfe any thing in this subiect, seeing she hath no power. The Passions are absolute and depend not on the Empire of vertue. They present themselues vncalled.
            
         
         
            
            Of Loue. The Preface.
            
               AN Ancient sayd, that to expell Youth out of our townes, were to cut off the Spring time of the yeare. But we may maintaine with no lesse truth, that to banish Loue from a ciuill life, and the conuersation of men, were not only to depriue the yeare of her goodliest season, but also as it were to pull the Sunne out of the firmament, and to fill the whole world with horror and confusion. For

what is there in this life, bee it amidst honors and glory, in riches and treasures, yea in delights and pleasures, that can giue a full and sound content vnto man, without the communication of the sweetenes thereof to friends? Wherefore an excellent Philosopher said, that if any one were raised aboue the heauens, from whence he might behold all the wonders of nature and of the world, and see with amazement the reuolutions, periods, order, diuersity, & beauty of the Planets and Stars, and had no friend to whom hee might impart this admiration; all these things in steed of fulnesse of ioy, would become displeasing and importune to his thoughts. For as colours which are the most exquisite ornaments of nature, how liuely and

glistring so euer they be, wil notwiths
                  •
               āding be darkned & giue no pleasure to our eies, if they were not enlightned, and as it were inspired by the light which discouers vnto vs the singularities, and perfections: so what wealth or honor soeuer we enioy in this life, we cannot tast the sweetnes therof but in representing vnto our selues the contentment which comes to thē we loue, and whom we thinke haue an equal Passion on our behalfe. Epaminondas gloried to haue won 2 battels, his Father & mother being yet liuing; as if the ioy that those persons conceiued which were so neere to him, had made his victories more stately, & increased the glory & pompe of his triumphs. In like manner there is no man liuing, which in the cours of his prosperities doth

not feel as it were an increase of happinesse, when as he imagines that his friends are spectators & partakers of his felicity. And moreouer what can be sweeter to our thoughts then the image of a true & constant loue, which we are assured our frend doth beare vs? What happinesse to haue a friend to whom we may safely open our hart, and trust him with our most important secrets, without apprehēsion of his cōscience, or any doubt of his fidelity? What content to haue a friend whose discourse sweetens our cares? whose counsells disperse our feares? whose conuersation charmes our griefs? whose circū

contents in the society of men, we will endeauour to shew what his beginning is, wherein his essence consists, to what Persons it extends, and what the effects bee.
            
               
               Of the beginning of Loue. CHAP. 1.
               
                  AS it is the custome of men to refer the noblest effects to the most excellent causes; many considering the dignity of loue, haue imagined that this Passion came from a particular impression, which God makes in our Soules, inspiring into them with the nature, the affections which transport them, and which makes them seeke the

obiects which are pleasing vnto them. The which they striue to proue by the example of the naturall inclinations which he hath giuen to other Creatures. Wee see, say they, that God as the Author of nature, hath ingrafted into light things an inclination to rise vpward, to seeke the place of their rest, by reason whereof the fire doth alway send his flame towards heauen. And in like manner hee hath imprinted in heauy things a naturall inclination which makes them tend to the center: so as stones, marbles, and such like, do alwayes bend downeward, & do not hang in the aire, but with violence and contrary to their inclination. In the same manner,

say they, God hath ingrafted in man a certain inclination to those things which haue some beames of beauty or bounty, so as when these obiects come to incounter his eyes or minde, he is rauished, and then presently there is framed in his heart an ardent desire to seeke and pursue them. They confirme this opinion by the diuerse inclinations which shine in the life of men from their birth. For wee see some loue painting naturally, others take delight in Geometry, some are passionatly affected to the Liberall Arts, others imbrace the Mechanicks; some loue Hunting, others burne with a desire of Play; some are borne to War; & others are inclined to Mildnes and

peace; some haue no contentment but in solitarinesse; and others cannot liue without the mannaging of affaires. And whence, say they, proceed these so different inclinations, but from the author of nature? The which they confirme againe by the example of things which happen often in the loue which men beare one vnto another; for that it will sometimes fall out, that by a certaine simpathy of mindes, wee shall loue at the first incounter a man whom we haue neuer before seene nor knowne. So as it seemes, this affection doth not then disclose it selfe in our soules, taking forme so suddenly and sweetly, but it is rather quickned and awaked by the presence of the obiect,

which makes vs to see that which we loue instantly without delay, for that wee knew him not, finding him so conformable to our humors and inclination. The which hath made some presuppose, that the beames of their eyes, which loue incountering with the beames which proceed from the obiect which inflames them, makes so sweete a mixture, as their vnion is as it were the fulnesse of al the delights which may be tasted in this life: And contrariwise at the first incounter wee shall haue a distast of some other person whom we had neuer seene before: Doth not this proue (say they) that it is nature which frames in vs this Passion? and so they conclude, that it cannot proceed

but from the Author of nature: others prefer the cause of loue to the Planets, Starres, and constellations, and presuppose that the reason why Achilles loued Patroclus, Alexander Hephestion, and the Queene of the Amazons, Alexander; And to come to moderne examples, that Charles the ninth loued the Marshall of Rais, that Henry the third loued the Dukes of Ioyeuse, and Espernon, and Monsier de Termes; that Henry the fourth loued the Duke of Suilly; and that the King now gloriously reigning loues the Duke of Luines and his brethren; are all effects of the aspects of the Planets, which incountered at the natiuities of these Princes and Noblemen. Others seeke the cause

in the Parents, as if they which bring vs into the world, with our being did transfer and infuse into vs their Passions. Others refer it to the good or bad education we receiue, according to which wee frame our desires and affections. The Platonicians imagine that wee must seeke it in the degrees of the harmony which is found in Soules; which they beleeue are compounded as of a consort and proportion of numbers, the which incountering equally in two persons, incites them to loue one another. But this is very mystical, and requires a spirit accustomed to the imaginations of Plato.
               
               To come then to the point, it is certaine that God hath infused into our soules the

seedes of loue, seeing that he hath giuen vs the powers which are capable. It is also certaine that the influence of the Planets may cōtribute to this Passion; for that it resides in the concupiscible appetite, the which is a sensitiue power, and depends of the body, ouer whose motions the Planets haue a kind of power. It is also visible, that nurture & education, & sometimes the inclinations which our Parents haue ingrafted in vs, may haue a share in the motions of our affections. But to speake according to the rules of Philosophy, wee must say precisely and absolutely, that the bounty of things, whether they bee found in them, or that wee imagine them to be, is the Spring, beginning,

and mouing cause of the loue wee beare them. For God the Author of nature, who hath created all things in number, weight, & measure, hath also imparted to all Creatures, inclinations and motions necessary to attaine vnto their ends. So hee hath infused into his vnderstanding an inclination which makes him passionately to seeke the truth, and to imbrace it when hee hath found it. And in like manner hee hath ingrafted in the wil a desire and loue of good, which is the only obiect which may moue it and enflame it to pursue it. And as colours are the obiect of the sight, which drawe it by a certaine attraction, which growes from a naturall simpathy

which is betwixt them, like vnto that which is betwixt our vnderstanding and truth, betwixt the eye and colours; and betwixt the hearing and sounds. Hence it growes that there is so strict a cōnexion betwixt the will and the good, as the will cannot loue any thing which hath not a shew of good. So as if it bee at any time deceiued, and imbraceth the euill, it is vnder a veile and shew of good, which is imployed to abuse it; and the like may bee sayd of the sensitiue appetite, which in its motions follows the same instincts that the will doth. But when as wee say, that the good is the obiect of our will and loue, vnder this good wee comprehend that which is faire, for

that goodly things haue an equall power with those things that bee good, to inflame our wills: as also beauty and bounty in effect are all one, and differ not but only in our imagination. The which the Platonicians demonstrate by excellent reasons, calling loue simply a desire of beauty. Yea to shew that beauty is louely of it selfe, as well as bounty, they adde that beauty which shines in the body, is as it were a beame or image of the infinite beauty which is in God; wherefore we admire it and loue it passionatly, when it presents it selfe vnto our eyes; and then, say they, the beauty of the body is also an image of the beauty of the mind: for that the internall

perfections ingender the externall, as the lustre of pretious stones & pearles growes from the perfect mixture of the foure Elemēts which are found in their constitution, as flowers and leaues of trees borrow their beauty from the roote; and as in beasts the good interior constitution is the cause of the beauty which appeares in the countenance. So then wee conceiue that the external beauty of the body proceeds from the internall bounty of the mind, so as bounty seemes to bee the roote of beauty, and beauty the flower of that bounty which shines in creatures. And therefore hee that containes himselfe within his bounds and in the innocency of loue, seeing the beauty of

the body, imagines (as it is true) that this pleasing obiect is a beame of the infinit and immense beauty, whereof the essence of God is as it were the center, from whence shee deriues and takes her beginning: and consequently, that it is as it were a sience of the interior beauty which shines in the soule, from whence the body hath taken life. Thus the Platonicians proue that beauty as well as bounty makes an impression in our wills, and proportionably inflames our desires, & begets affections and Passions, which makes vs to seeke it. But leauing all other reasons to proue this assertion, wee will content our selues with the saying of Aristotle; That to demaund why wee

loue beautifull things, were a question fit for a blind man, for that the eyes feele and know how powerfull the charmes are to make an impression in the Soule. By this which wee haue spoken it is easie to bee gathered, that loue hath for obiect and mouing cause the bounty and beauty of things, which by the sweetnes of the beames they cast forth, make so powerfull an impression in our soules, as they remaine as it were rauished or rather charmed with so pleasant a lustre; so as to ascend vnto the Spring & fountaine, we must eleuate our selues to that great and immortal Essence, which is as it were a notion of all the graces, of all the beauties and of all the bounties

which are infused into al the creatures. We must, I say, raise vp our selues to that infinite and most happy Essence, which is as it were the center, from whence all the perfections which represent themselues so goodly vnto our eyes, and so pleasing vnto our sense, borrow their lustre and take their beginning. And in this manner wee shall tie our affections to an obiect worthy of the generosity of their motions, which should alwayes imitate the nature of fire, which remaines vnwillingly in the earth, and striues continually to mount towards heauen.
               Finally, wee must remember that Loue is deuided into fiue branches, and that there are fiue kinds which differ

much one from another: for there is a loue of naturall things, there is a loue of creatures; there is a loue of men; there is a loue of Angells; and there is a loue of God. The Loue of naturall things is nothing else but the inclination which things destitute of knowledge haue to vnite themselues vnto their ends, and to attaine the perfections of their nature; to which sence an Ancient sayd, that the loue of the bodies was nothing else but the weight wherewith they are ballanced, bee it that the weight keepes them downe, or that the lightnes raiseth them vp on high: for God hath ingrafted these inclinations into all naturall things, to the end they may attaine to

their perfections, and preserue them when they haue once gotten them. The loue of creatures is nothing else but a vehement impression made in their sences, surprized with things which they conceiue to be pleasing. This Passion is many times blind, importune, obstinate, and insolent, and is common to men, & brute beastes, which suffers themselues to bee transported with the motions of a dishonest pleasure.
               Humaine Loue is a Passion which should follow the motions of reason, and which being guided by the light of the soule shold only imbrace the true good, to make it perfect: for containing himselfe within these bounds, it should no more be a violent

& furious passion, which filles the world daily with so many miseries by her exorbitant and strang disorders. The Loue of Angells flies yet higher, for that those happy spirits enlightned with a more excellent light, and illuminated with a more pure & perfect splendour, loue the soueraigne Good more ardently then all the creatures, and by a reflux of this great Loue take an incredible care of the affaires of men; and being neuer wearied in the seruice they do them by the cōmandement of God, assist them, & procure their safety, with constancy, and ioy full of amazement and wonder. The Loue of God enters not into comparison with any other, for that as there is no proportion

betwixt things finite, and infinite, his motions being infinite, they appeare with another lustre, and shew themselues with a greater endeauor towards that he loues, then the creatures can doe. From this spring flow the admirable beauties which shine in the heauens, in the Starres, Planets, Elements, in bodies both simple and compound, and in great, meane, and small things; all which do feele the effects of his bounty, and the perfect assistance of his prouidence. From this spring proceedes the care which hee hath of men, the graces which he imparts vnto them, the good desires wherewith hee doth inspire them, and the meanes which

hee offers them to raise them vp to the height of his glory, and to make them enioy the felicity of Angells. But we will not treate of this kind of loue, whereof wee had rather feele the flames then describe the perfection. Neither will wee discourse of that of Angells, which wee may better admire then set forth: wee will not in like sort busie our selfe with that of naturall things or of creatures, which is too base for our subiect, but wee will represent the Loue which is a humaine Passion, whereof morall Philosophy teacheth vs to discourse, and whose essence we meane now to set downe.
            
            
               
               Wherein the Essence of Loue doth consist. CHAP. 2.
               
                  AS in other subiects we dovsually ascend vnto the knowledge of the cause by the search of the effects, so in this matter to attaine vnto an exact knowledge of the nature of Loue, we must first vnderstand what it is to loue, to the end the branch may discouer the nature of the roote. Loue then is no other thing, but, To will good to some one, not for our owne priuate interest, but for the loue of himselfe; procuring with all our

power what we thinke may bee profitable for him, or may giue him content. Whereby it appeares, there are foure things to be considered in Loue. The first is, that wee be carefull of his good whom we Loue; the which growes, for that loue vnites the wills perfectly, and makes vs esteeme the good which befalls him we loue, as our owne particular: wherefore the Ancients sayd, that Loue was one soule in two bodies. The which it seems that Alexander would giue Darius mother to vnderstand, when he sayd that Hephestion was another Alexāder: For he vsed this speech in regard of the great affection hee bare him, the which was such as he held him another himself, so as he would haue him a partaker of

all his honors & glory. After this manner then wee should desire to our friends the same honors, the same glory, and all other felicities which we wish for our own proper contentment. And when they succeed, wee must reioyce as if wee our selues enioyed them, seeing that all things are common among friends.
               But secondly we must wish al this good to those we loue for their ownesakes, and not for any priuate interest of our owne, or for any profite wee expect to reape by them; for the Epicures opinion (who wil haue men loue for profit, or pleasure) is infamous, and makes Loue either mercenary or of small continuance. Wee must then remember that there are three kinds of

friendship; that is to say, honest, profitable, and pleasing. Betwixt the which there is this difference, that the two last kinds are no true affections; but rather shadowes of Loue; whereas the first, that is to say, honest friendship, which hath vertue for her obiect, is solid and true, and moreouer it is constant and of long continuance; whereas the profitable and the pleasing last little, and are dissolued vpon the first alteration which happens in the subiect whereunto they are tied. As for example, they that loue only for profit, continue no longer in this affection, then they whom they loue, may be beneficiall vnto them; the which ceasing, they renounce the duties of friendship

which they had formerly shewed; for that the cause ceasing, the effect of necessity must cease. Hence it growes that the friendships of Court are so inconstant and variable, for that Courtiers commonly 
                     ••
                  e their affections to those which are in fauour, & haue some kind of credit, to the end it may bee an entry, for them to offices in the Estate. But if there happen any alteration in their fortune by a disgrace with the Prince, and that they see them vnable, and incapable to assist them, they presently abandon them, and make no more account of them then of an image ouerthrowne; yea they would haue men thinke that they neuer obserued them. So in Tiberius
                  
time, Seianus possessing his maister absolutely, & receiuing the fauor of this Prince with full sailes, so as all the honors, all the dignities, and all the offices of the Estate, depended of the inclination he had to those that courted him; all the world adored him, the people and Senate erected statues vnto him, hee was publiquely praised, his house was neuer empty, all the Orders went to consult with him as with an oracle, or rather as the soule of the Empire. But as soone as his fauour began to shake, presently hee saw the affections of such as had so shamefully flattered him, decay and die; and when it was wholly falne, there followed so prodigio
                     •
                  s a change in the affections

of the Court and people, as after they had vnworthily massacred him, they drew his body through the streete into the riuer of Tiber, his statues were beaten downe, all his kinsfolkes persecuted, his memory detested, and the name of Seianus was held in execration to all the world. But this is the ordinary course in Court, whereas Fortune is alwayes adored.
               As the affections which depend vpon profite decay as soone as the profite ceaseth, in like manner that friendship which is supported only by pleasure, continues no longer then the subiect of pleasure indureth. For they that loue in consideration of beauty, when as age or

infirmities makes it to wither and decay, their affection is gone, and they esteeme no more that which they had formerly honored. So as there is no true nor solid friendship but that which is grounded vpon vertue and honesty. The rest hauing inconstant and wandring obiects, are also inconstant and mutable, and the interest and pleasures ceasing, they die: whereas honest loue propounding vnto it selfe a constant and durable obiect, knowes no change. They that Loue in this sort wish all good to him they loue, for his owne sake, and not for their priuate interest. The third thing wee must consider in Loue is, that wee are bound to imploy all our

meanes to procure good to them wee loue. For as the Sunne should not deserue the name of Sunne if it gaue not light to the whole world, so wee cannot esteeme him a true friend which doth not imploy himselfe with all his power and meanes to bind him whom he makes profession to loue. And this admits no limitation nor bounds, for there is not any thing which Loue will not make him do that loues perfectly, euen to contemne his owne life for the safety of him hee loues. It is true, that a perfect friend should wish that he to whom he hath ingaged his affection, should haue all things happy and prosperous in the course of his life, that hee be neuer shaken with any

storme, and that hee neuer feele any crosses of fortune; but as the condition of man is fraile and exposed to a thousand calamities, if it chance that hee fall into any infirmity, he must participate of his paine. If a tempest carries him through the waues of the sea, hee must hoist saile to follow him; yea if the billowes ouerset his ship, he must seeke him in this shipwracke. If Tyrants seaze vpon him, if they cast him into prison & loade him with chaines, hee must offer his owne body to free his bonds; and if they send him to execution, he must present his head to redeeme his friends. If hee see him assaulted by his enemies, who seeke to murther him, he must present

himselfe to beare their blowes. And if he see him in the throat of lions, exposed to the rage of wild beasts, hee must hazard himselfe to free him from danger; and if he die, he must in like manner abhorre life. Hee that loues perfectly, sayd Plato by the mouth of Phedro, will rather abandon himselfe to death, then expose that he loues to dangers. And there is no man so faint hearted, whom Loue doth not fill with courage and inflame with a force, to make him in this subiect equall to the most generous soules. For that which Homer saith, that the Worthies are inspired with a diuine force and furie, is more truely verified in those that loue, whō loue hath often inspired with a diuine fury, which hath made them to contemne

death, to preserue the life of those they haue loued.
               
               The last thing that is to be considered in Loue, is that we wish vnto our friends; the things which we thinke truely are good for them, that is to say, that we desire for them the things that are iust, and that are adorned with all the circumstances of vertue. In regard whereof hee spake wisely, which answered his friend, who would haue him forsweare himselfe, that hee was a friend euen vnto the altars, hauing no intent to serue his friend against his conscience. In this case then Loue admits bounds & limitations, and it were to abuse the name, to bind him that loues, to commit vniust things in fauour of them to

whom he wisheth well. So when as Charles of Burbon (to reuēge his priuate discōtent) abandoned France and his King, and imbraced the party of Spaine & the Emperour, the Princes & Noblemen his friends, (whereof he had many in Court) did not hold themselues bound to follow him, and to make themselues confederates of his despight and rebellion. So as these words which are at this day in the mouth of many, that they are ready to turne Turkes for their friends, yea and to follow them into hell, is the speech rather of a fury, then the discourse of men transported with true Loue: for Loue must cōtaine it selfe within the bounds of iustice, honesty, and vertue, and not

make vs do any thing which may breed vs shame. And moreouer, they that make these impious protestations, haue them more in their mouthes then in their harts; and I know not how they can make them without blushing. By al this which we haue sayd, it is easie to gather wherein the essence of Loue doth properly consist, the which we may define in this manner.
               
                  Loue is a wellwishing, which we testifie with all our power to those, to whom we haue an inclination, procuring them for their owne sakes, all the good we think may giue them content. According to which hee is a friend that loues, and is reciprocally beloued; for loue being as it were a torch which

lightens another, friends must beleeue that affections are reciprocall, and that as they loue, so they are beloued; wherein they must not shew themselues vnpleasing or importune, to sound the hearts one of another, which will bewray a diffidence and distruct: But content themselues with the true signes of loue, which their friends shew them. These signes of true Loue are reduced to three principall heads. The first is, that friends reioyce & grieue for the same things: wherfore Homer describing Agamemnōs affliction, when as he was forced to sacrifice his daughter Iyhigenia, he represents al his friends accompanying him to this sacrifice, with mournefull countenances &

full of sorrow; and at Rome, when as any one was accused and brought in question for his life, al his friends changed their robes with him, to shew that they did participate with his affliction. The reason is, for that sorrow and ioy are the markes of our affections, and of that wee haue in the soule, which reioyceth or afflicts it selfe, as the obiects which present themselues are pleasing or distastfull. And for this reason, sorrow and ioy discouer the inclination we haue to any one.
               The second is, that friends share equally betwixt them the good and euill. They say that there are images of wax, vpon the which inchanters deliuer such powerfull spells, as being made to represent

any person, as soone as they are wronged, the body of him for whom they were fashioned, feeles paine. In this sort there is such a bond of affection betwixt friends as the harme which happens to the one, afflicts the other, and fills him with bitternesse, so as many times we haue seene true friends die with sorrow, for the losse of their friend. Yea, prophane histories are full of Persons which haue slaine themselues, for that they would not suruiue them whom they haue loued dearely. In like manner the prosperity of friends passeth from one to another, so as the tryumphs of Alexander are the cōtentments of Ephestion, and the glory of Ephestion is the ioy of Alexander.
                  
The third is, that they which loue should haue the same friends, and the same enemies. They say the Adamant or Loadstone doth not only make an impression vpon iron which it drawes, but doth also impart his vertue by his touching; so as the iron which it hath toucht, drawes other iron vnto it, and makes as it were a continued chaine. In the same manner, a friend brings his friends to him he loues, and he reciprocally imparts vnto him his friends; whereof there is framed a common bond, which makes them ready to succor one another, as if they were members of one body.
            
            
               
               To what Persons Loue extends. CHAP. 3.
               
                  ALthough that loue hath for his generall obiect the bounty and beauty which shines in those things which present them selues vnto our eyes and soules; yet there are diuerse particular considerations, and diuerse beames, which excite this Passion and fashion it in the hearts of men. Aristotle numbers fifteene causes, the which are also diuided into other branches, whereof we will treate as briefely as wee

may, taking only that which shall belong vnto our subiect. First, sayth he, men loue them which do them good, or whom they thinke haue a will to do it, or to their friends. In truth there is nothing that more bindes the hearts of men, and induceth them more to loue then benefits. For euen bruite beasts feele the good which they receiue from men, and there is no creature so wild, whom good vsage doth not make gentle and tame. They that gouerne Lyons feare not their rage, but play about them without any apprehension of their fury, for that this generous Creature knowes him that hath a care to feede him. By continuall feeding they bring Elephants

to do what seruice they desire. And wee must not obiect against it, that it hath beene a common complaint in the mouth of men in all ages, that most of the benefits that are bestowed in the world are lost, for that they fall vpon vngratefull soules, who do not acknowledge themselues in any sort bound. For (as an Ancient hath obserued) this proceedes not from the nature of the benefits, which contrariwise haue a particular vertue to draw the affection and to charme the will: but most commonly the fault proceeds from our selues, for that wee either erre in our election, doing good to vnworthy persons: or we distribute it ill, if we take away the

grace. For wee must not think that our benefites bind a friend, if we suffer our selues to be too much courted, if we make him to languish in the pursuite, or if we do it with a kind of vnwillingnesse; for by these meanes wee take away all the merrit and bond of the benefit, for that no man will thinke himselfe beholding for that which hee hath purchased so dearely: wherefore an Ancient called benefits of that nature, a loafe filled with stones, which no man can vse. Men therefore thinke themselues bound to those from whom they receiue benefits, whether they be great and worthy to bee acknowledged, in regard of their greae shew and magnificence; or that they which

are the authors, bestow them freely without importunity, and with a singular demonstration of Loue; or that such as giue, haue made a sit choice of time to bind them, assisting them when as they or their friends had extreame neede, and when as they thinke that for their owne sakes they haue bound them by these benefits.
               They also Loue the friends of their friends, and such as haue any conformity with them in the subiect of their affection, and that Loue those whom they Loue, and who also make profession to be enemies to their enemy. The reason is, that reputing their friends good as their owne, they beleeue, that the good which is done vnto their

friends extends vnto them
                     •
                  selues, and that they do participate wholy thereof. In regard whereof they loue the spring and fountaine. And contrariwise they beleeue, that the auersion and distast they haue of their enemies is a token of the loue they beare them. They also loue those that succour them with their meanes, or bind them with the hazard of their liues. For first of all, men loue bountifull friends passionatly, imagining that they are borne for the good of mankind. As for the second, men loue great courages, imagining that they are supporters of their liues; & that they will neuer suffer wrong to bee done vnto the weake and feeble. They also loue

such as they hold to bee iust, and resemble not the Harpeys or rauening birds, which liue of spoyle, but content themselues with their owne fortunes, committing no outrage, nor offering violence to any. And in this rancke they put labourers and handicrafts men, to whom all the world seemes to beare an affection, in regard of the innocency of their profession. They also put in the same rancke, temperate persons, in whom they see some great modesty to shine, which shew that their soules are not inclined to any kind of iniustice. They againe esteeme those that leade a peaceable life, which haue no curiosity, and which pry not into the liues of other men,

but content themselues to order, & gouerne those that are submitted to their care and charge, presupposing that such as containe themselues within these bounds, thinke not of any iniustice or wickednesse. Men also Loue famous persons, who by their vertue haue attained to an eminent glory, and an extraordinary reputation, bee it generally in the world, or only among good men, or among such as they haue in admiration, or by whom they themselues are admired; and they especially make great shew of their affection, when as they presume, that these Persons in all their dignity and greatnes disdaine them not, but are wel pleased with the testimonies of their Passion;

so wee haue seene people runne by whole troupes from all the corners of the world, to see conquerours & such as did triumph; men of holy life, and Persons indued with rare knowledge or wisedome, aboue the common sort of men. The reason is, for that vertue, generosity, sanctity, and eminent knowledge, are not only louely things of themselues, and which haue powerfull allurements to cause them to bee affected and admired in the subiects where they reside, but also men beleeue there is a kind of glory to bee admitted into the fauour of such illustrious persons, whose glory seemes to communicate with those that haue the honor to come neere them. But men

                  Loue particularly these famous and vertuous Persons, when as they discouer, that they disdaine not the affection and Loue of those, which make shew to honor them with Passions; for it is a testimony of their moderatiō & of the bounty of their nature, not to be puft vp with the glorious aduantages which they haue gottē aboue the ordinary sort of men. They also Loue such as are of a sweete conuersation, and that haue a milde and pleasing humor, that is to say, they Loue those that are not fantasticall, and of a troublesome and importune behauiour. They also Loue such as reproue them not odiously of their faults, they loue those whom they see enemies of contention,

and which make shew, that they haue not a desire to bee superior in al disputes which rise in companies; but accōmodate themselues wisely and moderately to that which is contested. The reason is, for that these wayward spirits, they that are licentious in their answeres, and such as will alwayes in their arguments haue the vpper hand, seeme to bee borne to contradict and controule the opinions of the whole world: the which is a signe of the alienation of wills, and dissenting from others; which makes them to be hated: whereas contrariwise they Loue such as haue none of these bad humours, and which accomodate themselues in company, without

making any shew to bee selfe conceited. Moreouer men haue as it were a naturall inclination to Loue those which haue a quicknes and grace in their incounters, or to iest pleasantly, but withall can indure to heare a witty returne: hence it comes that in Court, buffoones and ieasters, which haue biting and Satiricall spirits, are so much esteemed; and yet many times these people, bite priuate Persons too sensibly and indiscreetly, and draw vpon them the iust wrath of those whom they haue licentiously offended. In the meane time the reasons why they Loue such as are sudden in their incounters and sharpe in their ieasts, is, for that it seemes this quicknesse, & wittinesse

to incounter, proceeds from the subtilty and force of their spirits. And then we are inclined to heare men euil spoken of; wherefore we Loue them that do it with a good grace. And for that we Loue particularly such as take liberty to iest at others, & are content to be iested withall; that proceedes, for that wee beleeue that such as will indure that which they themselues practise to others, haue no bad intent nor any bitternes in their hearts, but are carried to these incounters, more through a quicknesse of wit, then by any spleene. Moreouer they loue such, as seeme to make great esteeme of the good partes and qualities which they beleeue they enioy. Wherefore wee suffer

our selues to be surprized by flatterers, who insinuate into our fauours, couer our defects, & seeme to admire our actions. This misery happēs particularly to such as distrust themselues, and who feare to want those vertues which they desire to attaine vnto. For this distrust b
                     •
                  ing dispersed by the praises which they giue them, they thinke themselues bound to such as bring this support vnto their weaknes.
               They also loue those persons which affect neatnesse in all things, who take delight to carry a pleasing countenance, and to attire themselues properly: for that this neatnesse and hansomenesse is as it were a signe of the desire they haue to insinuate

themselues into the hearts, and to gaine the affections of men, who f
                     •
                  r this cause think thēselues boūd to loue them: they in like manner loue them, that lay not their faults before them to shame them, nor reproche them with the benefits wherwith they haue bound them. The reason is, for that both the one and the other redounds to our disgrace; and it seemes, that such as enter into these reproaches, will make vs contemptible, either by discouering our defects, or in accusing vs of ingratitude. They also loue such as remember not iniuries past, which are not obstinately bent to reuenge, and who are alwaies ready to pardon such as haue offended them.

Wherefore the Romaines did wōderfully admire the first of the Caesars, for that he forgat nothing but iniuries, the remembrance whereof he held vnworthy the greatnesse of his courage. Wherefore when as this Prince had erected againe the statues of Pompey, Cicero (that great ornament of the Romaine Eloquence) pronounced to his commendatiō, that in erecting the statues of Pompey, he had assured his owne, as hauing wonne the Loue of the whole world, by this act o
                     •
                   humanity, which hee shewed to his enemy opprest with misery. The reason of this Loue which men beare to those which forget iniuries in this manner, is, for that they presume when they haue

offended them, they will shew themselues in like manner to them, as they haue done to others.
               They also loue such as are not il tongued or detractors, which obserue not their imperfections, nor those of their friends, but only regard their vertues, either to admire them, or to frame themselues after their example. For that these things are the offices of good men, and of persons indued with singular integrity, and great probity. Moreouer, they loue such as resist them not when they are in choler, or that importune them not in the middest of their most serious imployments: for that they which take pleasure in these oppositions and importunities,

seeme to loue contention, and to be enemies to all society. They also loue those that admire them, which haue an opinion that they are vertuous, and make shew that they take delight in their conuersation, and are officious vnto them: But principally, when they make shew of this affection and liking in those things wherein they would haue their industry admired. As for example, a man that loues Philosophy, takes delight to heare his profession praised: he that takes delight in Armes, hath a singulat content to heare his exercise commended: wherefore both the one and the other loue those tha
                     •
                   giue glorious testimony of that which concernes their profession. Aboue

all, they haue an inclination to loue their like, being a thing which nature teacheth vs dayly, that resemblance ingenders Loue, not onely among men, but also among other creatures: for euery creature loues his like: Tygers & Panthers troop together with beasts of their owne kind: And birds of one fether fly willingly together; such power hath resemblāce to vnite affectiōs: the which we must beleue is more powerful in man, who can haue no sweeter conuersatiō thē with his like. The reasō why euery man loues his like, is, for that mā louing passionatly aboue other things, loues consequently any thing that hath any corresponcy with him; so as respecting him whom

he loues as another himselfe, hee cannot but bee inflamed with this consideration. The Platonicians had another reason, the which in my opinion concurres with this. Loue, say they, makes an impression in the soule of him that loues, of the Image and forme of the thing beloued. But man loueth not onely his being, and his true and reall forme, but also his imaginary forme; as appeares by pictures, and looking-glasses, in which we behold with content our portraicts & formes. Wherefore there is a certaine Passion for the thing beloued, in whose soule he doth contemplate his forme which Loue hath ingrauen. After this manner, resemblance breedeth Loue, and vnites the affections

of men. The truth hereof appeares, for that men do commonly loue those, that are allyed vnto them in neernesse of blood, so as Kinsmen doe commonly loue one another: or by some conformity of humours and complexions, which maketh melancholy men loue the company of their like, and Iouiall spirits delight in the company of them that are pleasant: Or by some commerce of profession, which maketh Philosophers to loue Philosophers; and Painters delight in Painters: Or some equality of age, which makes young men delight in the company of youth, and olde men to conuerse with them that are graue: Or some coherence of manners, which makes good

men loue the vertuous, and the wicked seeke after such as are wickedly affected. But notwithstanding that which we haue said, that cō
                  monly men of one profession loue one another, must bee vnderstood according to the true nature of things, for by occasion and accident, this cōformity of professions may ingender hatred and enuy, that is to say, when as they of one trade and profession, liuing of their art and labour, hinder one another: as for example, when as a tradsman hauing gotten some reputation, doth hinder the profit of his companions, then iealousie riseth amongst them, according to the saying of an Ancient, The Potter enuies the Potter. The Philosophers giue

an excellent reason hereof: He that loues, say they, loues himselfe more deerely then all other things besides: for that he is vnited to himselfe by Essence and Nature, whereas hee is not conioyned to him that he loues, but by some accidentall and externall forme. And therefore if this conformity crosseth his priuate good, and be preiudiciall vnto him, hee findes himselfe more strictly tied vnto himselfe, then to his like: wherefore seeing his losse concurring with his passion, he whom hee loued, being an obstacle to his desire, he growes odious vnto him, as opposite to his good.
               Men doe also loue those that aspire to the same honors and dignities, at the least

when they may attaine vnto them, and enioy them together, without any obstacle or wrong one vnto another. For competency causing an hinderance, as it did in the pursuit of the Consulate at Rome, it happeneth (as wee haue said of men of the same profession) that it excites enuy and hatred: Wherefore in the loue of women they can endure no corriuals, for that with honesty they cannot be enioyed by two. They also loue those with whom they haue any familiarity, which is not scrupulous, hauing free liberty without apprehension of disdaine, to doe and say things in their presence which they would not act or speake before the world. As for example, they affect those

before whom they may freely discourse of their loues, of their pursuites, and of their other Passions. But wee must remēber that there are some things which are dishonest of themselues, the which a good man may neither do, or speak before the world, or before his friends. But there are others which are shameful only in the opiniō of the world, and not according to the truth of things: and these a good man, vsing an honest familiarity with his friends, may doe and speake in their presence, although he would not doe it in publike before the world: like vnto King Agesilaus, being in priuate with his children, playd with them with a fatherly liberty, but beeing surprized by one,

who knew not how farre the loue of a father might extend, he was discontented.
               Men also testifie, that they loue those before whom they are ashamed to doe or say those things which are of themselues shamefull or dishonest; wherein wee may say, that the Persians gaue good testimony of their loue to their wiues, when as they caused them to retire from their banquets, being vnwilling that their eies shold be spectators of their excesse, & admitting none but their Concubines. For this respect and reuerence which they gaue them, was a signe of true Loue, for that wee are ashamed to commit any vnworthy Act before them wee affect. They also willingly

imbrace such as they haue seene faithfull, and constant in their affections, and who loue equally both present & absent. For which consideration they desire to insinuate themselues into their friendship which testifie their loue vnto the dead, who adorne their Tombes, erect Statues, and make other monuments for them, to preserue their memory among men. They also affect such as abandon not their friends in the crosses and iniuries of fortune, whereof wee haue a worthy example in the subiect of Damon and Pithias, whereof the one beeing condemned to die, by the tyrant Dionisius, and desiring some respite, to goe and settle the affaires of his house, his companion

yeelded himselfe a pledge for his returne, with this condition, that if hee returned not backe within the prefixed time, hee should vndergo the rigour of the same sentence: but the condemned man presenting himselfe at the day appointed, the tyrant was so rapt with admiration, to see the faith which he had vnto his friend, in a matter of that importance, and of so great danger, that in stead of putting him to death, he coniured these two perfect friends, to accept of him as a third man in their friendship. Behold how the most sauage and vntamed spirits are forced to loue those, that shew an vnuiolable constancy in their affectiōs. Men doe also loue such as they see

full of freedome, and without dissimulation towards them. In which ranke they nūber such as make no scruple to discouer their errors vnto them, and who entertaine them freely with their priuate passions: For, as wee haue shewed before, we blush not to say or doe in priuate with our friends, that which we would not doe publickely before the world. Wherefore, as he that is ashamed to doe any thing before another, shewes that hee loues him not perfectly; so he that hath not this apprehension, giues a manifest testimony that he hath a full confidence in his friendship: wherefore, wee loue such as make shewe to rely vpon vs, euen discouering their imperfections

vnto vs. Againe, they affect those whose authority is not fearefull vnto them, & whose power they thinke they shall haue no cause to apprehend: for no man euer loued him whom he feared seruilely; and herein Tyrants abuse themselues, thinking to se
                     •
                  le their Authority by the terror of Armes, and the terror of punishment: yea, they haue alwayes detested the furious words of him that said, I care not to be hated, so I may bee feared. It were good among bruit beasts, but men must be managed and gouerned by mildenesse. And they willingly embrace such as they may trust; and whose power is not fearefull vnto them. Behold the persons to whom the Loue of men doth commonly

extend.
               In the meane time the true means to purchase Loue, is to bind those whose friendship we affect, by all sorts of benefites and good offices. And to this end they must do good before it be demanded or that they bee forced to discouer their wants vnto vs: for that were to put them on the racke, to make them confesse our magnificence & bounty. Moreouer he must be carefull neuer to reproach the fauours which hee hath done them, nor proclaime them to others, with a vanity which seems to turne to their contempt. He that obserues this mean in the benefits and fauours which hee bestowes, seemes to haue propounded vnto himselfe, the onely good

of him whom he hath bound, without any other particular interest: In regard whereof he is also bound to acknowledge and Loue his freedome, and bounty.
            
            
               Of the Effects of Loue. CHAP. 4.
               
                  AS the Ancient Romanes obseruing of the one side, the conquests, victories, triumphes, and glory, which Caesar by his valour had purchased to their Empire; and on the other side weighing the ruines, miseries, massacres, and slaughters, which he had caused in their Estate,

they were wont to say, that it was difficult to iudge whether his birth had bene more fortunate or fatall to their Common wealth. Euen so it is hard to say, whether that Loue causeth more good or euill in the world. It is true, when as this Passion containes it selfe within the bounds of honesty, it is a liuely spring and fountaine of all good things in the life of men. It is also true, that the author of nature hath ingrafted in vs the first motions and beames; and it is true, that it is borne with vs, that it increaseth with vs, & that it doth alwayes accompany vs, so as it cannot subsist without vs, nor we Loue without it. It is an immutable law, which men haue not

                  
                     •••
                  nd out, lawgiuers haue not prescribed; neither doth it depend vpon the examples or customes of nations, but was grauen, as we may say, by the hands of nature in our Soules. But when like a wild and vntamed beast it exceedes the bounds of reason, there is no misery which it brings not into the world, nor any disorder which it causeth not in our liues. It is as it were a fatall source, from whence flow all kinds of horror, vncleanenes, adulteries, incests, sacriledges, quarrells, warres, treasons, murders, parricides, cruelties, and violences; besides the particular torments it giues vnto the soules of such as giue themselues to be surprized, filling them with enuies,

iealousies, cares, melancholies, terrors, yea and madnesse; drawing them many times to despaire, and to do things whereat heauen and earth blush and are ashamed: wherein it is the more to bee feared, for that as the first heauen by his motion doth violently draw whatsoeuer is beneath it, so Loue prescribes a law to our other desires, & to all our other Passions; so as we may tearme it the key and beginning of our tho
                     •
                  ghts, of our words, of our actions, and of whatsoeuer wee do in this life: So it makes the first impression in our soules, where it excites the desire of that which we resolue to pursue; & then it fortifies this desire by hope, which inflames vs to the pursuite of that

we desire; and if there appeare any obstacle, it imbraceth Choller, and hath no rest vntill it hath vanquished and surmounted all lets, wherein she settles her cōtentment & rest. And as the thunder breakes whatsoeuer resists it, so this furious Passion, being once inflamed, striues to ouerthrow whatsoeuer opposes it selfe against her rage and violence. Yet as the winds fill the sailes of Pyrats shippes, but are not the cause of the murthers and thefts which they commit at sea; But all these miseries proceed from the bad inclination and couetousnesse of these infamous Pyrats: So although that Loue bee an assistant in many villanies which men commit, yet it proceedes not

from the malice of this Passion, which contrariwise is framed to bring all good to the society of men; but it growes from the liberty and excesse of men, who peruert the vse of all things, and conuert the causes of their felicity, into instruments of their misery. Let vs then see what bee the proper effects of Loue, not staying at those which rise from the meere malice of men. We will reduce them to three or foure heads, the explanation whereof will giue sufficient light to the rest of the subiect.
               The first effect they attribute to Loue, is, that it hath an vniting vertue, by meanes whereof it causeth him that loueth to aspire to vnite himselfe

to the thing beloued: whereunto we may refer the fable of Androgenes, where of Plato doth so much triumph; but we must swallow so many fopperies, before wee shall come to the mysteries of this fiction, as it were better to passe it ouer in silence, then to spend time to explicate it. So it is that prophane and vnchast Loue seekes the vnion of bodies, which is found euen among brute beasts, and for this reason may be called brutish, if it bee not sought with an honest intent by a lawfull marriage. But chast and honest Loue seekes the vnion of affections and wills, and exceeds not that which is decent and vertuous. They which loue, sayd Aristophanes, would passionately desire to

be trāsformed, & chāged one into another, & of two bodies to become one. But for that this transformation cannot be without the destruction of their being, they striue to recompence this defect, by a ciuil and honest vnion, which tēds not to the ruine of their nature, but contents their affections; that is to say, they conuerse continually together, entertaine their Passions, and are as little absent as may bee one from another: Moreouer they haue the same thoughts, the same desires, the same affections, the same wils, the same delights, & the same distastes, & seeme to be but one soule in two bodies. So as that which is pleasing to him that loueth, is in like manner to the party beloued,

what he affects the other imbraceth; and what hee reiects the other flies, and doth abhorre. So as their willes being thus strictly vnited, all their actions and carriages conspire to the same end, and propound vnto themselues the same obiect. For when as we haue graft the sience of one tree vpō another stocke, the fruits which grow follow the nature of the graft, and sauor nothing of the stocke: so the will of the louer, being transported into that of the party beloued, takes the tincture, and doth not any thing but what is conformeable to his desires and intentions. But whence comes the power which this Passion hath, thus to vnite the subiects where it worketh? This

cannot well bee explicated without the aide of Philosophy. First of all, Loue, say the Philosophers, is a desire to enioy the good wee propound vnto our selues, as proper for our content, and capable to make vs in some sort better by the fruition. But this enioying & participation cannot bee effected but by vniting the obiect to our affection, which is the same good we propound vnto our selues; wherefore it is of the Essence of Loue that it produceth this vnion. Hence it proceeds, that the presence of the party beloued is so deare and pretious vnto vs, and that we feele our selues filled with content, when as we may enioy him to entertaine our thoughts, to taste the sweetnesse

of his company, and to discouer our Passions: whereas his absence and separation giues vs a thousand torments, and afflicts vs with a thousand sorrowes and discontents, which wee would redeeme with our liues. Wherefore when as death doth take violently from vs those whom wee loue dearely, and by this meanes hath condemned vs as it were to a perpetuall absence, we striue to ease our griefe, and sweeten our losse, by transporting our selues often to the places where we were accustomed to see thē, representing vnto our selues their portracts and images, reading ouer their letters, & stil handling al the gages and monuments they left vs of their affection.

Sometimes the same gages and the same momuments of their affection displease vs, and wee do so abhorre them, as wee cannot indure to see them, nor handle them, but this growes from the griefe of their absence, for that we then represent them as infallible signes of our losse, which they figure vnto vs as irreparable; by reason whereof their pictures fill vs with bitternes. But on the other side when as the same things seeme vnto vs to supply the presence, wee Loue them dearely, and cannot bee weary to entertaine our selues with those thoughts. And if amidst all this we can inuent any thing that may serue to preserue the memory more liuely in our soules, wee imbrace

the inuention, and are wonderfully pleased with this art. Wherein doubtlesse Artimesia Queene of Caria, shewed an act of wonderfull Passion towards her husband Mausolus. For death hauing taken him away, this desolate Princesse not knowing how to pull the thornes of her sorrow out ofher soule, she caused his body to be reduced to ashes, and mingled them in her drinke, meaning to make her body a liuing tombe, whereas the reliques of her deare husband might rest, from whom shee could not endure to liue separated.
               The most subtile Philosophers giue a second reason of this vnion which ariseth frō 
                  Loue. Loue (say they) hath her feate

in the Will (they doe not consider it as a Passion onely, which riseth in the sences, but also as a quality which in the end becomes spirituall;) but there is this difference betwixt the vnderstanding and Will: the vnderstanding goes not out of it selfe to ioyne with his obiect, but rather he drawes the obiect vnto him, whereof the Image is framed to produce his action, like vnto a seale which prints its forme in the waxe. But the Will being toucht with the Loue of her obiect, suffers it selfe to bee drawne to his Image; and going out of it selfe, vnites it selfe vnto him to take his forme; like vnto the waxe which receiues impressions of the seale. So as by this reason, Loue is thoght

to cause the vnion of him that loueth with the party beloued; for that his will rauished by his loue, hath no other Passion but to see her self vnited vnto her. But these meditations are too nice for our subiect.
               The second effect they attribute to Loue, and which is as it were, a branch and bud of the first, is, that it causeth the soule of him that loues, to bee more where it loues, then where it liues, and that reciprocally the soule of the party beloued, is more with the louer then with his owne body. The reason is; for that the soules of such as loue, are perpetually attentiue to cō
                  template the image of that they loue, and haue no other thoght nor greater pleasure,

then that they receiue by this sweete entertainment: By reason whereof the soule making shew of a more exact presence, where it doth most frequently worke, it followes thereby that it is more with the party beloued, then in its owne body.
               But let vs heare the opinion of the Platonicians vpon this point: The soule, say they, which is toucht to the quicke with Loue, dying in i
                     •
                  s owne body, findes life in that it loues. And when this Loue is reciprocall, it dies but once, wheras it reuiues twice. For he that loues dyes truly, when as Loue makes him neglect and forget the causes of his life, to thinke wholly vppon the party beloued; but hee recouers his life doubly

when as he sees himselfe imbraced and entertained by the party beloued; and that he finds in his armes his deer Image; which hee preserues more carefully then his own life. Who will not then, say they, hold this death happy, which is recompenced by two such sweete liues? But this discourse of the Platonicians presupposeth an equall correspōdency in Loue, without the which they maintaine that this Passion is full of despaire, & leaues nothing in our soules but importune and troublesome thornes. Wherfore the Ancients said, that to make Loue grow, shee had neede of a brother. But wee haue treated sufficiently of this Subiect.
               They attribute other effects

to Loue, that is to say, languishings, extasies, and amazements; but that Loue must bee very violent which doth produce them. And moreouer wee may consider these extasies, and rauish
                     •
                  ments which may happen in a violent Loue, after two sorts. First, we may obserue them as a true alienation of the sences, which ariseth, for that the spirit and will of him that loueth, being wholy imployed in the contemplation and enioying of the thing beloued, suffereth himselfe to bee so transported with this content, as the soule remaines as it were quencht and without motion. The which may also proceed from a more powerfull cause, that is to say, either

from God or from euill spirits, which somtimes stirre vp these rauishments and extraordinary extasies. Secondly we may consider these extasies & rauishments, as a kind of madnes, which transports them that Loue, and makes them to commit many follies; wherefore an Ancient sayd, that Iupiter himselfe could not be wise and loue at one instant. These extasies and rauishments produce sometimes prodigious effects in their soules that are afflicted with this Passion. For that his soule that loues intirely, is perpetually imploy
                     •
                  ed in the contemplation of the party beloued, and hath no other thoughts but of his merit, the heate abandoning the parts, and retiring into

the braine, leaues the whole body in great distemperature, which corrupting and consuming the whole bloud, makes the face grow pale & wanne, causeth the trembling of the heart, breeds strange convulsions, and retires the spirits in such sort, as he seemes rather an image of death, then a liuing creature. These accidents are followed with passionate and heart-breaking sighes; as it appeared in young Antiochus at the sight of Stratonice: Or when as they only make mention of her, as if the spirit were eased and free from a heauy burthen, and receiued content by this thought or presence. Teares in like manner fly to succor this afflicted soule, for that the heate

which is mounted vp to the braine, causeth the humor to dissolue and discharge it selfe by the eyes. But this poore soule thus agitated, hath no certaine consistence, but floting betwixt hope and feare, she sometimes giues signes of ioy, sometimes markes of sorrow; she is sometime frozen and congealed, sometimes all on fire: she goes, she comes, without any stay or rest, and doth many things which shew that shee is as it were incensed. For she proclames the merit and glory of that she loues, and giues extraordinary commendations, which are the signes of her rauishment. Suddenly changing her humor, shee makes her griefe and discontent ascend vp into heauen,

shee accuseth the innocent Starres, she complaines of destiny and fortune, and blames that which she loues; and suddenly returning to herselfe, shee condemnes herselfe of wrong. Then she powres forth her spleene against such as she thinks haue crost her rest and hindred her content, so as she suffers cruel tormēts in this agitatiō. Many times euen in the heat of his Passion, the party toucht with loue can indure no lōger discourse; his words are short & scarce intelligible, for that the soule being thus tied to the obiect which it loues, it cannot giue it self the leasure to speake of any other thing. And that which is full of admiratiō, this Passion doth so chāge & trāsform men, as it

makes the wisest to commit great follies; it humbles the grauest to seruices vnworthy of their rancke, it makes the most glorious to become humble and meeke, the couetous to be profuse and prodigall, and cowards to shew themselues hardy and valiant. But for that some of these effects exceed the ordinary of a morall Passion, we will leaue them to discourse particularly of Iealousie, vpon which subiects there are great controuersies and disputes, that is to say, whether it bee one of the effects of Loue, as the Vulgar sort imagine; or whether it be rather the poyson of Loue, as others presuppose; but we will referre the discourse to the following Chapter.
            
            
               
               Of Iealousie, whether it be an Effect and signe of Loue. CHAP. 5.
               
                  THE Vulgar sort thinke, that as the Sun runnes not his course without light, so Loue cannot bee without Iealousie; and they adde, that as lightning is an infallible signe of Thunder, which breakes forth, so Iealousie is a certaine signe of Loue, which desires to shew it selfe powerfully. But they that haue a more exact and particular

knowledge of Humane Passions, maintaine, that as the Sunne beeing come to the South (which is the point of the perfection of his light) casts no shadow, but spreads his beames all pure vpon the earth; so a true and perfect loue is not subiect to the inclinations of Iealousie.
               
               And they say moreouer, that this vniust Passion is no more a signe of Loue, then stormes and tempests are shewes of faire weather; this opinion is more probable: for to begin with the proofs, how can Iealousie subsist and remaine with Loue, vnlesse we will ouerthrow the Lawes of Nature, which suffer not two contraries to subsist in one subiect? Is there any thing more contrary to Loue then

                  Iealousie? Can the world see a greater Antipathy, then that which is obserued in these two qualities, whereof the one doth participate with the condition of monsters, and the other is the very Idea of perfection? Loue vnites the wils, and makes that the desires of them that loue, striue to take, as it were, the same tincture, to the end they may resemble one another. And contrariwise, what doth so much distract the Wills, and diuide the hearts, as Iealousie? Loue binds vs to interpret fauourably of all the actions of the party beloued, and to take in good part that which we ought to beleeue she hath done with reason: whereas Iealousie makes bad interpretations, not onely

of her actions, but euen of her very thoughts? Is there any innocency that can bee sheltred from the outrages of this inhumane fury? If the party beloued hath any ioy, it then presupposeth a riuall; if she be pensiue, they are suspitions of contempt: if shee speakes to another, it is Infidelity; if she haue wit, they apprehend practises; if shee be aduised, they imagine subtilties; if she be plaine, they call it simplicity; if shee bee well spoken, it is affectednesse; if she be courteous, it is with a designe. So as Iealousie is like vnto those counterfeit glasses, which neuer represent the true proportion of the face: and what more sinister iudgements could the most cruell enemy

in the world giue of the party beloued? But not content thus to blemish the particular perfections of that shee seemes to loue, she seekes to depriue it of the sweetest content in this life, which is by communicatiō with men of honor and merit, who doe not visite her but for the esteeme they make of her vertues: So as many times to please an importune, who is himselfe a great burthen to them that suffer him, shee must forbeare all good company. What iustice can force a soule well bred, to indure this brutish rigot? Loue is a liuely fountaine of ioy and contentment, which banisheth all cares and melancholy; but Iealousie, what is it else but a nursery of grief
                     •
                  
                  
and waywardnesse, whereas wee see thornes of despaire and rage, to grow vp among the sweetest and most pleasing flowers that Nature can produce? How then can any man beleeue that these two contrary Passions can subsist in one subiect? If they oppose heereunto experience, and the testimony of many persons worthy of credite, which protest that they haue loued sincerely, and yet were neuer without Iealousie; and will thereby inferre, that at the least, Iealousie is a signe of loue; which is the second thing we must incounter, to satisfie that which hath bene formerly propounded: it sufficeth to answer, that although for respect we yeelde to those personages what

they publish of their Passions: yet as one Swallow makes no Spring, so that which happens to particulars, cannot prescribe a law to the generall. But to containe our selues within the bounds of our first proposition, we say, that these persons are much deceiued in this subiect: and their error growes, for that they cannot giue proper names to things, for that of a respectiue feare competible with loue, whereof it is full, they make an vniust Iealousie, with the which Loue can no more subsist, then water with fire. They that loue intirely, are in truth, full of respect to the party beloued; honor her with all the passions of their soules, fight for her honor, and hold it a punishment

to offend her. But these are not the effects of Iealousie, which contrariwise violates the honour which is due to the party beloued, and by a prodigious manner to blind the world, will haue her fauour by wronging her, treading her merits vnder foote. We must then put a difference betwixt a respectiue feare, which always doth accompany those that loue perfectly, and Iealousie which is neuer found but with an imperfect passion, which cannot iudge of the perfections of the party beloued. They which know that these things are diuerse, and as remote one from another, as the earth is from heauen, wil easily passe on this side, and yeelde, that Iealousie is neither

competible with Loue, nor is any signe thereof. Yet if wee shall yeelde any thing to the opinion of the Vulgar, we may freely confesse, that Iealousie, in truth is a signe of Loue, but as the feuer is an argument of life. It is vnquestionable, that a feuer is a signe of life, seeing the dead are not susceptible of this bad quality. But as a feuer shewing that there are some reliques of life in the patient that is tormented, accompanies him to his graue; so Iealousie is I know not what signe of Loue, seeing they which loue not, cannot haue any Iealousie. But it is certaine, that if wee expell it not, it will in the end ruine Loue, like vnto a thicke smoake which smothers the

brightest flame. This is all we can yeelde vnto the Vulgar, so as according to this opinion which we haue held the most probable, Iealousie is to Loue as thicke mists are to flowers, haile to haruest, stormes to fruites, and poison to our liues.
            
         
         
            
               Of Hatred or Enmity. CHAP. 1.
               
                  AS the Lawes of Loue and Hatred are directly contrary; by that which wee haue spoken of Loue, it will be easie to iudge, wherein Hatred consists, and how farre her effects extends. Hatred then is

                  An auersion and horror which man hath of all that seemes contrary to his good, or preiudiciall to his contentment: Or else Hatred is an horror which the appetite hath of that which seemes pernicious vnto it, so as the sheepe hate the wolfe, as the enemy and persecuter of his life.
               But wee must heere obserue, that as all that is befitting Nature is put in the rancke of good, so on the other side, whatsoeuer is opposite vnto it, must be placed in the rancke of euill. Wherfore as the good is the obiect of Loue, so the euill is the obiect of Hatred. To vnderstand this, we must remember, that whether it be in the minde or in the body, there is a befitting estate, and as it were a

naturall harmony, which makes vs to abhorre that which may dissolue this consort. This harmony considered in the body, is no other thing then the good constitution, by meanes whereof, we enioy a perfect health; the which being impayred, our nature receiues pain, as when we indure great hunger and thirst, or when as wee receiue any hurt or wound. As for the soule, this same harmony may bee considered: first in the senses, as well externall as internall, & cōsist in the proportiō they haue with their obiects; which is such, as they hate whatsoeuer puls them away, or which diuerts them by any kinde of violence. As for example, the eyes hate darkenesse and obscurity,

and our imagination is terrified and troubled by the fearefull apprehensions of dreames, which it frameth during our rest. This same harmony considered in reason, either it regards the simple knowledge of the truth, which our vnderstanding conceiues with pleasure; or the vse and execution of things which depend on wisedome, which wee doe with content. In regard of the first, our spirit is enemy to lying, although at some times it takes delight in the art wherewith they colour a thing to giue it some shewe of truth: So as the wisest are delighted in the reading and report of fables, when as the intention hath any grace. And as for the second, there

is such diuersity of iudgements in humaine actions which are as it were the Element of prudence, as it is a thing in a manner▪ incredible: for hardly shall you see two persons which haue the same feeling and apprehension of affaires, in regard whereof this life is full of Hatred and factions which grow from these diuerse opinions.
               As for that which concernes the will, her harmony consists in the proportion & Loue which she beares to the good, which makes her detest and abhorre whatsoeuer presents it selfe vnto her, vnder the shew of euill, as pernicious and hurtfull to her content and rest. And therefore the harmony of the sensitiue appetite consisting in the

familiarity and concurrence it hath with the good of the sences, it doth abhorre and beares an irreconciliable hatred, to whatsoeuer shall offend them; hence it comes that wee so much abhorre whippes, tortures, punishmēts, hunger, thirst, wounds, & such like which tend to the destruction of our being. This Passion was ingraft in vs by nature, to the end that at the first approach, at the first taste and imagination of euill, wee may retire our selues and flie it, lest wee runne into ruine. This kind of hatred then is proper to the concupiscible which is offended at diuerse things, yea at small things, and many times at those which haue no subiect of offence, for you shall see some

which cannot suffer the presence of certaine creatures, & others cannot endure the sight of certaine fruites, though otherwise they be exceeding pleasant. Finally there is no creature so fantasticke in his Appetite, nor so sudden in the motions of Hatred and distastes of things which present themselues vnto his senses, as man, who not able to endure any thing, makes himselfe insupportable in a like manner to all creatures: but principally to his like.
               But to giue more light to this discourse, we wil obserue that there are diuerse sorts of Hatred and Enmities, which may bee referred to foure chiefe heads: for there is a natural Hatred, and a brutish

                  Hatred, a melancholy Hatred, and a humaine Hatred. The naturall Hatred takes her beginning from a certaine antipathy, and contrariety of nature which is found in creatures, the which as it were abhorre one another, and cannot frequent or conuerse together, although the subiect of this Hatred appeare not, and that shewes it selfe more in the effect then in the cause; whereof wee haue prodigious examples in nature, in plants, in beasts, and in men. Brutish Hatred is rather a rage then a Passion, for that it seekes a furious destruction of that it hates, and to see the last relliques consumed; so as it is more fitting for rauening wolues, or for monsters then for men. Such is the

                  Hatred of those who not satisfied to haue slaine their enemies, make their bodies to feele their fury, practizing a thousand cruelties vpon their carcasses, and making them to suffer after death, all the indignities their rage can deuise. This detestable Hatred sometimes passeth to such a furious transport, and so full of excesse, as they eate the flesh of their enemies, & haue a brutish delight in the fume of their members being cast into the fire: This onely befits Canniballs and those monsters which haue layd aside all humanity. Melancholly Hatred growes from the great aboundance of adust choller, the which doth so torment and agitate those miserable wretches which are

afflicted therewith, as they abhorre all the honest pleasures of life, fly the light of men, and wish euill vnto themselues, so as they cannot indure to bee seene, neither will they speake to any man, but seeke desarts & solitary places, where they confine themselues, and consume themselues with the discontent and Hatred they beare to mankind: like vnto that cursed Athenian, who had conceiued such a mortal Hatred against all men, as he imagined it was not in his power to binde his fellow Cittizens vnto him more strictly, but in planting of trees which might serue them as Gibbets to hang themselues.
               Some among the Idolaters

would haue tied this aspersiō & infamy to the profession of religious men amōg Christians, comparing these holy soules, to birds which fly the light, and neuer shew themselues but in the darknes. But these reproaches are the fruites of impiety, which is not capable nor can comprehend the motions, nor force of the inspirations of the spirit of God, who drawing his elect from the vanities and pleasures of the wo

to blemish and defame this holy profession, which beginnes his paradise on earth, would haue taken the paines to search into and sound the condition, the manners, and the life, of those which renounce the world, & the pleasure thereof; they shold haue found, that the Sun in the whole world doth not behold soules more contented then those, in whom there appeares no signe of sadnesse, nor any shew of melancholy: But a perpetuall ioy which no troubles interrupt, nor any discontents do crosse. But this belongs not to our subiect.
               It rests that wee speake of that Hatred which plants her rootes simply in the harts of men. This is an infirmity

of the soule as wee haue described it, which hath humaine causes, and to the which also they bring humaine remedies to seeke to cure it, of the which we now treat. In the meane time there is great difference betwixt Choller, Hatred, and Enuy. And first of all there is this difference betwixt Choller, and Hatred, that Choller growes from iniuries which we haue receiued, and which offend vs in our owne particular; whereas Hatred may spring from things which concerne not vs in particular; but which touch the Publique. As for example, we may hate and detest those which kindle a fire of discord in the remotest parts of the Estate. We may hate such

as commit villanies a hundred leagues from vs; but to inflame our Choller, the iniury must touch vs and offend vs, either in our owne person, or in that of our friends. And Choller doth alwayes presuppose particular men; but Hatred may extend it selfe to all mankind, there being no man but doth detest and generally abhorre all theeues, al murtherers, and all slanderers▪ Moreouer Choller may bee cured with time, for that it is a short fury which may bee pacified with patience. But Hatred is in a manner incureable, and growes more bitter with time and remedies. Wherefore the Poets describe Etrocles: and Pollinices, continuing the effects of their Hatred euen in their

tombes: For when as their sister Antigona had cast their bodies into the fire, to performe their ordinary obsequies, they could not remain together, but the flame diuiding it selfe cast their bodies one from another; whereupon miserable Antigona cried out, that their Hatred suruiued their death.
               Moreouer, he that is transported with Choller, not only desires to be reuenged of the party that hath wronged him in making him to feele the effects of his wrath▪ But withall will haue him know that hee is the author of this reuenge, and of the paine hee feeles. But he that is possest with Hatred, desires onely to see his enemy ruined, and doth not care to haue him

know that hee is the Author thereof, so as he may behold his destruction. Besides, Choller is accompanied with paine, by reason of her vehemency: But Hatred is without paine, neuer filling her subiect with this extreame ard or, but suffers him coldly to attend the ruine of his enemy. Finally, Choller hath bounds, for if hee that is incensed against any one, sees any great calamity befall him, which exceedes the limits of a common reuenge, he hath pitty, and doth wish that his misery had not mounted to that height. But the man that is full of Hatred, neuer sees his bad inclinations satisfied; and how great soeuer the calamity be which befalles his enemy, hee hath

no feeling nor pitty: the reasō of this differēce is, for that he which is in choller, desires only that the party against whō he is incēsed shold know, that it is in his power to reuenge the wrong he hath done him. But he that meerly hates, seeks absolutely the ruine of his enemy, and is not satisfied vntil he see him vtterly lost: let vs now obserue wherin Hatred differs frō 
                  Enuy. The diuersity appeares first, in that hatred hath for obiect the euill which wee conceiue of the party whom wee hate, presupposing him to be wicked, either in our owne respects, or generally toward all men. For we finde it dayly by experience, that men are disposed to hate those, from whom they thinke they haue receiued some iniury,

or whō they know are accustomed to outrage all the world: whereas Enuy hath for obiect the felicities and prosperities of another: the which is most apparent, for that wee neuer enuy the miserable. And Hatred also extends euen to bruit beasts, for as we haue said before, there are some which naturally hate certaine creatures; yea, we haue seene a great Prince who could not endure the singing nor sight of a Cocke. But Enuy powres forth his poyson only among men: for wee doe not enuy birds for their goodly fethers, nor Lyons for the greatnesse of their courage; nor Stags for their swiftnesse; 
                     •
                  or Elephants for their greatnesse and force: but we onely enuy the glory

of our like. Moreouer, enuy is alwayes vniust; for what shew of reason can be found in a passion which doth afflict vs for the prosperities of another man, as if hee did vs some iniury in being happy? But there may be Hatred full of iustice as those which make vs abhorre the publike plague, and troublers of the peace of the State, the enemies of the Countrey, men desperately wicked and vicious, and the enemies of God and religion: yea, this Hatred of the wicked is a signe of a good soule, as the enuy wee beare to them that are fortunate, discouers a wicked dispositiō: wherfore we dissē
                  
                     •
                  ble not the Hatred we beare to such as wee know are wicked, whereas wee disguise all

we can the enuy we conceiue against them that are happy. Againe, Enuy kindling in our hearts by the great prosperity of another, when as they decline, and that we see them ouerthrowne by some notable accident of misfortune, it relents, and is by little and little quenched: yea, it is most certaine, that enuious men are glad to haue some cause of pitty; whereas Hatred and enmities neuer ceas
                     •
                  e for all the calamities which befall their enemies; but when they are once framed and fixed to any one, they neuer abandon him neither in good nor bad fortune. Moreouer, Hatreds and enmities are sometimes cured and quenched, by letting the party (that is tormented

with this passiō) know, that he to whō he wisheth euill, hath not done him any wrong, or that he hath changed his inclinatiō, & is become a good & vertuous mā; & moreouer, that he hath done him some kind of pleasure, in occasions which haue bin offered to oblige him. But althogh you perswade a man, that hee hath not receiued any wrong from him that is happy and fortunate, yet it doth not quench his enuy; and in stead of suppressing it with this consideration, that he is a good man and that hee hath indeauoured to doe him fauours, yet he will shew it the more, and let the world see, that he can neither indure his prosperity nor his benefits; for that the one proceeds from the good

fortune which doth accompany him, and the other is an effect of his vertue, which are two recommendable things, & cōsequently subiect to Enuy. Lastly, these two Passions differ, in regard of the diuerse ends which they propound vnto themselues: for Enuy hath that in particular, that shee doth not alwayes cause vs to wish great miseries to those we enuy: for wee see it dayly by experience, that there are some which enuy their own kinsmē or friends, yet they would be loth to see any great misery befall them, or an affliction which might tend to their ruine; contenting themselues to crosse their prosperities, and to hinder the lustre and glory of their fortunes. But Hatred
                  
passeth further, still watching for an occasion to ruine his enemy, and is neuer satisfied with his miseries vntill they haue brought him to the period of his downefall: So as shee induceth vs to procure irremediable mischiefs, and extreame calamities to those whom shee pursues with obstinacy.
               Wee must now seeke the source and fountaine of Hatred, and shew what the causes be that frames it. As she consists in the auersion of things which are contrary to our senses, it may spring from three causes principally; that is to say, from choler, from reproches, or slanders, and from the crosses or discommodities which wee receiue. As for the first, an Ancient

had reason to say, that hatred is an inueterate or rooted choler; not that time doth change one of these passions into another: for the Philosophers will neuer confesse, that one kinde may passe into the nature of another but for that choler hauing exasperated our courage, if wee entertaine long the forme of an offence which doth gall vs, in the end wee lay aside choler, and beginne to hate him against whom our wrath was kindled: So as choler is not of the Essence of hatred, but many times the cause.
               As for the second, it is certain, that nothing doth more excite our Hatred then slanders & reproches, the which may euen trouble the wisest and most vertuous; for wee

haue seene great Personages, who had, as it were, renounced all feeling of the other Passions, yeelde o the griefe of detraction, and haue suffered themselues to haue beene so caried away with griefe of minde, as they haue fallen into a generall disdaine of all the world, and to abhorre all Mankind, by reason of the fury of such as had defamed them. So as slander is like to a huge waue which wrests the helme out of the Marriners hand: for that she troubles the most vertuous, and makes thē to giue way to the griefs of Hatred. Besides, if they which slander vs, giue vs other crosses, and are the cause of some notable preiudice; as if they accuse vs before the Magistrate, if they bring vs

in questiō of our liues, if they cause vs to lose our goods, if they persecute our kinsmen, if they torment our friends; all these causes together frame a deepe Hatred in our soules, the which retaine for euer the forme of these bloody iniuries, vnlesse they make some great and solemne satisfaction.
               Finally, the reasons why choler, detraction, and crosses, or discommodities, ingender Hatred, is, for that all these things tending to the destruction of the being, or honour of men, they are so many subiects and spurres of Hatred against those that procure them those displeasures. Yet Hatred is not framed in our hearts by these causes onely, but there

are other particular motiues from whence it may proceed, as when we see our selues deceiued in our trust, and of the good opinion we had of men to whom we were tied by affection. Wherefore an Ancient had reason to say, that Hatred is commonly framed in our soules, by our bad elections, for that wee loue before we know, and before wee haue tried the merit and fidelity of those to whom we will trust so rich a treasure as friendship. We are too easily perswaded that they are vertuous, and worthy of all fauour and confidence, and in the meane time wee finde them treacherous and vnworthy: so as wee fall into such a disdaine, and do so abhorre them, as we cannot inindure

to heare them spoken of. Finally, to draw to a head the causes of this Passion; wee hate vgly and deformed things, as the monsters and scorners of nature and arte, and those which are filthy, troublesome, and importune: for that wee esteeme them as enemies to our senses and content. As for those which are subiect to the motions of this Passion, wee obserue, that faint and base mindes, are sooner mooued then generous spirits: The reason is, for that Cowards feare euery thing, so as their hatred is inflamed against all such as they thinke may hurt them, bee it in their person, in their goods or in regard of their friends. Hence it growes, that great men

which haue no courage are commonly cruell, as we haue monstrous examples in Nero, Caligula, and other effeminate Princes, whose rage no murthers could satisfie. And for the same reason they that haue offended a great Personage, who hath meanes to reuenge himselfe, hate him irreconciliably; which makes them to desire his death, to see themselues freed from feare. Whence groweth that famous saying, He that offends neuer pardons. The proud and enuious are also subiect to the motions of Hatred. The first, for that they thinke they are not honored as they should be; and the last, for that all the prosperities of their equalls offend them.
               
                  They that loue themselues too much, are wonderfull apt to the same motions, for that they take euery thing as an iniury, and are so nice as they cannot endure any man. But as Loue springs from a feeling of good, and Hatred from an apprehension of Euill, it happens that for that the good things we enioy in this life are neuer pure, nor much durable, they make no great impression, neither do they leaue any great remembrance nor Loue of them in our soules: But contrariwise euill things being very sensible & long, take deepe rooting in our hearts, where by reason of our corruption, they are are as it were in their proper Element, so as we do more easily preserue the seeds

of Hatred then of Loue: Wherefore an A
                     ••
                  ient sayd, that he whic
                     •
                   
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   with griefe, remembers it; but hee that enioyes pleasure, forgets. Finally if wee would make good vse of our Hatred, wee must imploy it against vice, and against those obiects, the Loue and pursuite whereof may pollute our hearts, and blemish the Image of God which shines in our soules. This Hatred must take her course from causes contrary to those, which we haue formerly said, are proper to induce Loue. As for example, to roote out of the soule a dishonest Loue, we must leaue to thinke of it, and diuert our minds and sences from the continuall contemplation of the image

which beginnes to make vs to feele her power, lest that the beames of so pernitious an obiect, kindle and nourish in our hearts bad desires: and moreouer, to fortifie our Hatred, we must iudiciously weigh the defects which may incounter in the subiect which we Loue. And of this sort, from the most perfect creature in the world, being subiect to great imperfection, we may easily if wee will, finde occasion to separate our selues.
               Wee must in like manner represent the miseries which do commonly accompany the pursuites of Loue; we must also set before our eyes the shipwracke of so many famous pe
                     •
                  sonages, which haue lost themselues vpon

this shelfe: We must represent the infidelities, cares, crosses, paine, and torments, which this wretched Passion doth cause. And aboue all, a Christian should apprehend the wrath of God, and the horror of his iudgements which hee powres out vpon vncleaenenesse. But this belongs to another Discourse.
            
         
         
            
               Of Desire or Cupidity: and of the flight and horror we haue of things. CHAP. 1.
               
                  AS NATVRALL things being farre from their center, haue no rest vntill they

attaine vnto it; so man hauing a particular inclination to good, as soone as he propounds vnto himselfe the obiect, and ties it to his imagination; if the enioying bee denied him, he feeles himselfe surprized with a certaine vehemency, which makes him to seeke it passionately. And if it bee a good of the mind, his will is inflamed; and if this good concernes the contentment of the body, his sences receiue the impression and long to enioy it. According to this last motion, Philosophers affirme that there is Passion in man which they call Cupidity or Desire, which concerneth those things which we possesse not, and which we thinke are fit and proper to giue vs content

This Cupidity or Desire is no other thing, but a Passion wee haue to attaine vnto a good which we enioy not, & which we imagine is fitting for vs. It differs from Loue and Pleasure, for that Loue is the first inclination, the first taste, or (as we may say) the first sweetnesse we feele of good things, or of those which are goodly or faire: which rauish our sences, and breed in vs this desire and longing to enioy them; after which, hope doth arise, the which succeding, the effect filles vs with ioy, and contentment, which is properly the pleasure wee conceiue when the thing hath succeeded. Or to deliuer it more plainely, Desire, differs from Loue, and Pleasure, for that Loue is the first

motion, and the first Passion we haue of any good thing, without respect whether it be present or absent; Desire is a Passion for a good that is absent, and pleasure a contentment wee haue to enioy when wee haue gotten it. Whereby it followes, that Desire as we say, is a particular Passion, for that it regards a sensible good, vnder a sensitiue consideration, that is to say, vnder this consideration that it is absent, and that in this absence it drawes vnto it the affection of man to pursue it. For the sensible good which is the obiect of the sensuall appetite, moues otherwise when it is present, then when it is absent.
               For when it is present, the Appetite is at rest by the presence

of the thing beloued, whereas being absent, the Appetite is moued and agitated with a desire and longing to pursue it and get it. But there are two kinds of Desires and Cupidities, which may make impression in our senses, the one is naturall, the other rise from our choice; the naturall are those which agree with the nature of the creature, as drinking, eating, sleeping; and these are common to men & brute beasts, for that both the one and the other, haue obiects befitting their nature. Those which arise from our election, are such as regard the things which are not altogether necessary for the creature, but man hath inuented them for his greater ease and

commodity, as the delights of drinking, & eating, baths, play, sights, riches, honor, reputation, and such like. As for naturall desires they are not infinite, but haue their bounds; for that as nature contents it selfe with a little, so shee prescribes vnto her selfe certaine limitts, within the which she containes herselfe, tying herselfe to the obiect which is fitting, without any diuersion.
               But those which follow our election haue no bounds, so they grow infinite. For as they depend of the imagination of man, as this power represents the formes and images of infinit obiects; so these desires multiply infinitely to pursue all those good things which the imagination hath

propounded. Whereby it happens that representing at one instant any thing that seems pleasing or profitable, we desire it passionately, and then changing opinion wee wish another, and after it a third.
               So as we feele as it were a swarme of desires disclose themselues in our thoughts, which draw vs to diuerse obiects, without rule or measure. For as no aboundance of water can satisfie them that are sicke of the dropsie, so there is no kind of goodnesse or pleasure that may content our desires. The ancient Philosophers compared the first matter to an infamous strumpet, who is neuer glutted with present pleasure, but doth still meditate

vpon new imbracings; for that the first matter is neuer content with the formes which she enioyes, but still desires new, not caring whether they be more noble then that wherewith she is adorned. But we haue more reason to apply this comparison to our Cupidities and Desires, which shew themselues insatiable in all they pursue, with what kind of Passion soeuer. And herein appeares the great misery of man, who hauing meanes to passe with few things necessary for the entertainment of his life, plungeth himselfe in superfluities as into a gulph, whereas hee findes neither bottome nor bancke, and afflicts himselfe with a thousand torments in the pursuite

of his vaine desires, making his condition much more miserable then that of other creatures. For they hauing quencht their desires by the enioying, remaine fully satisfied, and torment themselues no more, vntill that nature quickens againe their appetites.
               
               When as the Lyon hath pursued a Bull or a Goate, he deuoures what is necessary to satisfie his hunger; but he hides not the remainder in the ground. The Bore drinkes vntill hee hath satisfied his thirst, and then leaues the water. The Wolfe (though a rauening beast) runs after his prey, when hunger driues him; but being satisfied hee leaues his chace. Leopards and Tygers being

prest by necessity, kill their prey, but hauing fedde they are quiet. Bulles hauing taken their pasture, returne content. But there is nothing able to satisfie the desires of man, his imagination being alwayes fertile and intentiue to furnish him with new toyles and cares to seeke for new, by the distaste hee hath of those which hee enioyeth.
               So as to comprehend them all together, there is not glory enough, nor wealth sufficient, nor obiects of pleasure and delight in the whole world, that can make him absolutely content. Whereby we may see a man growne from a base estate to a glorious fortune, complaine of his estate; neuer looking to

them that are inferiour vnto him, but onely to such as exceed him. Let him be aduanced to the first office of estate, yet this glory will be a spurre vnto him to aspire vnto a greater. He would play the prince, he wold contemne his King, and would enioy the glory of his Diademe.
               Finally, he would see how high fortune can raise him, and doth not consider that she growes weary, and that her consistence is as brickle as glasse, and that her lustre is like vnto those false lights, which deceiue Seafaring men, and guide them vpon Rocks and Shelfes, whereon their ships are broken, and they suffer shipwracke. Ambition hath no bounds, if she hath surmounted the earth,

she wil defie heauen. So those proud Princes of Antiquity, not satisfied with the glory of their Crownes, and hauing nothing more on earth to be desired, wold counterfeit the thunder and lightning, to haue themselues held powerfull in heauen. But if euer Prince made shew that Ambition is insatiable, it was Alexander; for that after so many battels, after so many glorious conquests, hauing past from Macedonia through Asia, euē vnto the red sea, yet he sent forth his Lieutenants to discouer new worlds, there to finde out a new haruest of triumphs: the Scythians though Barbarians, could wel reproach him with this in
                     •
                  atiable passion of glory. If the gods (say they) had giuen thee

a body equall to thy courage, the whole world would bee too little for thee: with the one hand thou wouldst touch the East, and with the other the West: and after all this, thou woldst yet know where the brightnesse of that great Diuinity were hidden. But wee must not imagine, that this passion is proper onely to Alexander, for there was neuer great Monarch whose abundance of treasure, and extent of Empire could limit his Ambition. There was neuer any one whom death hath not found plotting of new designes, and making of new proiects for conquests. The cupidities and desires of riches are no lesse insatiable: the more we enioy, the more wee desire, and the Passion growes more violent by abundance;

like vnto the flame of a great fire, which increaseth whē they cast wood into it. Giue mee a man in whose house (to speake with the world) fortune hath heaped vp all the treasures of Perou, to whom shee hath imparted so much gold, siluer, and pretious stones, as he not onely enioyeth it, but also treads vnder his feet Pearles, Rubies, and Diamonds; yet amidst al this riches and glory, I dare boldly affirme, that his soule is not content, but in this abundance hee represents vnto himselfe other riches, which he imagineth are more exquisite, & more pretious then those which hee enioyes. So as in being rich, we doe not learne to leaue to be passionate for the loue of

riches, nor by enioying many superfluous things, we do not get the contentment not to desire more. And when will mighty men ceasse to extend the boūds of their possessiōs? The lands, the houses of their neighbors, do they not stand in their light? & do not their Desires enflame them to buy thē, or take thē away by vioence? If there be a branch of a riuer that may fit their buildings, must they not haue it either by loue or force? Doe they not cut down moūtains & Rocks, diuert the course of riuers, make valleis euen; yea, & remoue the very foundations of the earth to satisfie their desires? Poore men, which hauing but so little a body to lodge, build such ample Pallaces.
               
                  And for al this are their desires satisfied? nay rather, the end of one is the beginning of another. This is a miserable Passion, seeing that shee her selfe fights against her owne satisfying and content: and seeing that by a prodigious violence shee enflames vs to the pursuit of riches to inioy them; and when wee haue gotten them, she forbids vs the vse: she begets a longing in vs, and denies vs the pleasure And as we more abhorre the Cantharides and Tarantules, then Lyons, Tigers, and Beares; for that they kill men and reape no fruite of their death, whereas sauage beasts doe feede themselues, and satisfie their hunger: so of all the Cupidities and Desires, there is not any one that we

should so much detest, as that of Couetousnesse: for that this monstrous Passion draws no contentment from that it gathers together, nor suffers him rhat is possest with it, to take any pleasure: wheras other desires, at the least, aspire to the enioying and content which may grow by the possession of their obiects. Interdicting thus the enioying, shee stirres vp new Desires, to get newe treasure; and hauing gotten it, wee finde, that the paine we haue taken to enioy it, is nothing in regard of the torment it giues vs after that we are owners. And yet wee stay not there, but plunging our selues still in this gulph, wee finde sooner an end of our liues, then of our Couetousnesse.

These are the thornes which spring from riches, which are gotten with paine, preserued with care, and lost with griefe. Pleasures and delights are also infinite, not onely for that they cannot giue a full contentment to our desires, but also for that the number is so great, as we can hardly reckon them, or at least giue them names. There are Desires of the eyes, which represent sensible beauties, of which we finde a thousand fashions, the search whereof should be innocent if it had any bounds; but the excesse of our Desire doth blemish the pursuit. As for example, Pictures, Images, Statues, Porphyrie, Marble, Amber, C
                     •
                  ystal, Iuory, Flowers, tapistries, Diamonds, Rubies, &

all other things, where the eye discouers the wonders of nature and the Art of man, are the obiects of an innocent pleasure, if we could vse them moderately. But wee suffer our selues to bee transported with so furious a Desire, and we seeke them with such an inraged heate, as it is rather a madnesse then a Desire. An Ancient said, That nothing had more distasted him from loue, and the Passion of all those things, then to see the stately Triumphs of Rome where they exposed to the sight all the gold and siluer of that great City, to serue for an ornament; and carried the Pictures, Images, Armes, plate, pretious stones, Treasure, Tapistry, and the Mooueables of vanquished

Kings, & the spoyles of their rich Prouinces, to encrease their glory. And his reason was, for that (said he) all this pompe, all this lustre, all this glory, and this abundance of treasure, was seen in one day, and then vanished: So as in a short time our eyes might behold all the pride not only of Rome, but of the world. This was to make a man wise by sights, whereas others become mad.
               There are other pleasures of the eyes, which pollute by the excesse of our cupidities, and by the disorder of our desires: as when our eyes not content to behold the beauty of a woman, conceiue an vnchaste desire. Besides these diuers pleasures of the eyes, there are others of smelling,

hearing and feeling; wherein wee obserue as little measure as in the rest. Perfumes are exquisite presents of Nature; but our effeminate delicacy hath made the vse infamous and shamefull. Musick, consorts, and the sweetnesse of Instruments, were things which wee might vse honestly without offence; but we haue conuerted all into Luxury, which prophanes the vse. And amidst all this abundance, neither doe our eyes satisfie their Desires, by so many obiects which they behold; neither doe our eares finde their heate quenched, nor our other senses their passions, by whatsoeuer offers it selfe to their desires. The other pleasures wherunto man is addicted, as play, combats,

huntings, exercises, companies, and whatsoeuer he doth to ease the cares of this life, cannot satisfie nor giue any full contentment to man: but amidst all these roses hee stil meets with some thornes, and seekes dayly after newe contentment; so insatiable are his Desires.
               
               The same Cupidities also vary according to the ages, complexions, and humours of those which are toucht with this Passion. Yong men are passionate after play and women, and exceede in these pleasures. The sicke wish for health, as the souereigne good of his life; old men desire good wine, and good fare, which seemes to make them liue againe, & to adde new vigor to their

bodies. Princes and generous spirits breath nothing but glory, tryumphs, and trophies, which serue to aduance them beyond the ordinary of men.
               They which are of a sanguine and hot complexion, haue a Passion fit for all things, and they pursue them with great heate; but it lasts not long, and is like a fire of straw, inconstancy & change accompanying them still in their pursuites. Whereas they that are of a cold constitution, haue no great desires, by reason of the heauinesse of their humors: But they are obstinate in their pursuits, and can hardly bee diuerted from the obiect, whereunto they are tied. They which haue the least

feeling of the motions of Desire, are such as haue no apprehensiō of the discōmodities and miseries of this life, as they that are young; great spirits; men ouertaken with wine; and finally all such as haue much blood and heate gathered together about the heart. As in like manner, they are not much transported, which haue neuer felt any vrgent necessity. For as feare and distrustes increase Desire, to prouide all things necessary for the preseruation of this life, they which haue tasted of crosses, apprehending to fall into their first miseries, do Desire infinite things, to fortifie themselues against all accidents; supposing still that nothing can secure them sufficiently.

They also which haue little blood about their hearts, & that but luke-warme, haue naturally cares and ardent desires to gather; for that they feare to see themselues fall into want and pouerty; and the importune care they haue to preuent this misery, afflicts their soules, and tortures their minds. Hence it comes, that we often see men who haue bene prodigall and very profuse in their youth, so change their inclinations, as when they come to age, there can be nothing noted in them but base couetousnes in all their actions: whereas on the other side wee commonly see that wine and Loue make couetous men bountifull.
               Finally when we haue gotten

with much paine the goods which we enioy, wee shew more vehemency to keepe them. The which may arise from two causes, either for that we feare to fall againe into the necessity in which we haue bene, and apprehend to see our selues forced to take new paines, and to vndergo new toyles to recouer our estates. Or else for that the things which we haue gotten with sweat and danger, are more deare vnto vs, then those which come without labour and paine. So we see a young Heire, which comes to a great Estate by the death of his father, will bountifully bestow his gold and siluer, and dissipate within few dayes, what his miserable father had bene long a

gathering, and which he had not gotten but with infinite torments both of body and mind. Whereas a Merchant, who hath tried the dangers of traffique; who hath grown pale a thousand times at Sea during his voyages; who hath seene himselfe often neere death, and ready to fall into the hands of Pyrates or theeues, will not thrust his hand rashly into his coffers, nor distribute his mony but with great stayednesse, and wonderfull discretion, which may make him to bee held base and couetous. Doubtlesse wee haue seene in our times the most generous Prince of the world, who shewed no such magnificence in the bestowing of his excessiue treasures, as the

glory of his birth and the splendor of his other actions seemed to require. So as many had a conceite that he feared to fall into his first necessities; but doubtlesse his good husbandry was far better then our profusions.
               Wee haue spoken sufficiently of this Passion of Desire, the which hauing in a manner all things common with Loue, it shall not need any longer Treaty, nor more words to explaine it. As for the Passion which is contrary vnto it, as it hath no name, (although it bee the same which makes vs abhorre and fly that which wee thinke is hurtfull to our nature,) so it is not needfull to seeke out the conditions and particularities, seeing they

are in a manner the same which we haue obserued vppon the subiect of Hatred. Moreouer, that from the nature of Desire, we may gather what that of horror is, seeing that one contrary deciphers another.
            
            
               Of Pleasure or Delight. CHAP. 1.
               
                  AS this great Fabricke of the heauens makes his motion vppon the two Poles of the world, which are as it were the two points where it beginnes and ends: So it seemes that all the Passions of our soules depend vpon

                  Pleasure and Paine, which grow from the contentment or distaste which we receiue from the diuerse obiects which present themselues vnto vs in the course of this life. If we loue, it is for that wee finde a sweetnes in the subiect that doth rauish vs. And if we hate, it is in regard that wee imagine the obiect which presents it selfe vnto our imagination, is full of griefe, contrary to our apprehension. The pleasure wee take in the Idea of a good thing, which we enioy not, and yet promise to ourselues the possession in pursuing it constantly, begets hope: as contrariwise, when we think it is not in our power to obtaine it, the griefe wee haue afflicts vs, and leades vs to

despaire. Desires in like manner are framed in vs by the imagination we haue of a benefit which may giue vs content; and the distaste wee haue of things which we flie, is, for that we imagine they may cause our discontent and vexation. So as in all the other Passions wee still finde Ple
                        •
                     sure and griefe intermixt, in regard whereof, wee may rightly tearme them the two springs and fountaines, from whence deriue and flow all the other Passions. Yet they haue their particular reasons and considerations, which giue them their rancke, and put them in the number of other Passions duly & exactly considered. Wherefore Pleasure or Delight is a Passion & motion, which is framed in our

soules with a certaine sweetnes which filles our senses with contentment and ioy, when as they receiue the impression, by the enioying of a good which is pleasing vnto them: Or else, Pleasure is a Passion which proceedes from the sweetnesse which our senses receiue from the obiects which delight them. Or to vse Aristotles definition; Pleasure is a motion of the soule, which putts it suddenly and sensibly in an estate fit for the nature of man. Whereupon wee must first obserue, that as things meerely naturall tend to their perfections, by those meanes which nature hath prescribed; so all creatures striue to attaine vnto those which are proper vnto them, by the meanes which the same nature hath

made subiect to their power. But there is this difference betwixt insēsible creatures & those which haue sense, that the insēsible hauing attained to the height of their perfection, feele no ioy. So as it seemes, the Sun is vnhappy in that respect, that being indued with such a shining brightnesse, and such perfect beauty, yet it hath no feeling nor knowledge of his glory; whereas creatures haue a feeling of their good when they haue gotten it. So as this feeling filles their senses with ioy, and causeth pleasure, which makes their nature cō
                  tent: let vs now see what conditiōs are necessary to frame this delight, & to beget in vs the pleasure of things which touch our senses.
               
                  First of all, the good must be vnited to our senses, be it really & in effect, or in thought and imagination. For wee must remember in all this Treaty of Humaine Passions, that it imports not for to stir them vp, that the obiect which incites the motions be really in the nature of things, or simply in the imagination: for that there are some men which suffer themselues to be more transported with the images which Fancy frames in their braines, then by the true obiects of things which subsist really. As we reade in Histories, that a certaine Athenian called Thrasillus had a certaine foolish conceite, that all the shipps▪ with their loading, which came into the Port

of Pyrea were his. But when as his friends had caused his braine to be purged, and had brought him to his right senses; he complained of them, and blamed them for that they had depriued him of an infinite content.
               Moreouer it is requisite in Pleasure, that the obiect of good which makes an impression in our senses, should be agreeable to our nature.
               The which cannot be, if it be not in some sort agreeable vnto their capacity. Wherefore there must bee such an agreement and proportion betwixt the senses and obiect, as there may bee betwixt them a certaine resemblance and affinity, so as that which caused the Pleasure must neither bee too

strong nor too weake, to make his impression. Wherefore a moderate light is more pleasing to our eyes then that which is more glistring. And in like manner a sweete sound cōtents the eare more then that which is loud.
               And we take more delight in a speech which we vnderstand, then when wee vnderstand not the words; for that this intelligence wee haue of the words, frames a kind of conformity betwixt them and vs, whereby the speech doth insinuate sweetly into our eares, and makes a more pleasing impression in our soule.
               Thirdly, it is requisite to breed delight in our senses, that wee haue knowledge of the good which breeds the

impression, and that we find it is fit for vs, & that we enioy it either in effect, or by imagination: For that we cannot receiue any ioy of a thing vnknowne, or which we find not that it is good for vs, or are ignorant that it is in our power. So a hidden friendship doth nothing touch vs, and yet if we had any perfect knowledge, we should be rauished with ioy, and burne with desire to imbrace it. Finally, it is requisite to beget Pleasure in our soules, that our Appetite (from whence desires do arise) should receiue an alteration or change by a sweet impression, which the obiect (being the cause) makes in our senses. For this sweetnesse is of the Essence of Pleasure,
                  
which cannot subsist without her: wherefore shee consists rather in the end of the motion then in all the rest of her progresse; therefore Aristotle tearmes it, not onely a motion, but also a rest of the soule. In the mean time there are two kinds of appetites in man, that is to say, the intellectuall, which is the reasonable will, and the sensitiue, which is diuided into the Irascible and Concupiscible, as we haue said: the intellectuall reioyceth at good things which are conformable to reason, whereof the vnderstanding is iudge.
               And the Sensitiue takes delight in things which concerne the senses. We also obserue this difference, that those things which delight

the senses, cause a sensible alteration in the body. As in ioy wee feele our heart open and dilate it selfe; especially if this ioy proceede from an vnexpected thing which concernes vs much, it may be so mooued and agitated, as death may follow. As it happened in those women of Carthage, who hauing newes that their sonnes had beene slaine in battaile, when as they saw them liuing before their eyes: this ioy happening contrary to their hopes, they dyed suddainely. But the pleasures of reason cause no other thing then a simple motion of the will, which reioyceth the minde without any alteration of the body, vnlesse it extend vnto the senses. Wherefore some affirme

that this kinde of ioy is found in the Essence of God, and in the nature of Angels. And they are accustomed to propound a question vpon this subiect, which be the greatest pleasures, and delight most, whether those of reason, or those of the senses. But the answer is easie, for that vndoubtedly, the intellectuall and those of the minde (if we consider them in themselues) are more delightfull then those of the senses. And this made Aristotle to say, that the sweetest and most pleasing content, wee can haue in this life, is that which proceedes from the exercises and actions of wisedome, which is spent in the contemplation of the first causes. The reason why

the pleasures of the minde haue an aduātage ouer those of the body, is, for that to cause pleasure or delight in vs, there must concurre three things; that is to say, the obiect vnited to the power; the power to the which it is vnited; and the actuall vnion of the one with the other, which presupposeth knowledge of this good. As for example, to beget the pleasures of our taste, there must bee delicate meates, a taste well disposed, and moreouer the vnion of these two things must bee made by the naturall organs, with his knowledge, that must receiue the impression of this pleasure. For if the most exquisite meates were put into the mouth of a man that slept, hee should receiue

no pleasure, for that hee had no feeling nor knowledge. And first of all, the goods of the minde (in the enioying whereof consist the intellectuall pleasures) are more noble and more louely then all the goods of the senses and body: whereof we haue a notable proofe in that wee see men (yea, most abandoned to vice) depriue themselues of the sweetest pleasures of the body, to purchase glory, which is a good of the mind. So they sayd of Caesar, who in his great inclination to loue and women, renounced all his pleasures to get the honor of a Triumph.
               Moreouer, the power of the will, in which is made the impression of these kinde of Pleasures, being intellectuall:

and much more excellent then the senses which are corporeall, the actions which she produceth and which are followed by these Pleasures, are also more noble then those which deriue from the senses. And by consequence, the vnion which is made of spirituall obiects with the will, is farre more strict; more worthy, and more durable, then that which happens betwixt the senses and the obiects, which they pursue. It is more strict, for that the senses regard onely the superficies of things, and doe not busie themselues but to consider the accidents which inuiron them: as colours, smelling, noyse, sweetnesse, and the like; whereas the vnderstanding pierceth

into the Essence and substance of the obiects. It is more worthy, for that it is made without any alteration or corporeall change: whereas the obiect pleasing to the senses, cannot be vnited with them, but it will cause some kinde of change which is full of imperfection.
               It is more durable, for that the obiects of the sēses are of perishable goods which soon faile, whereas the obiects of the minde are of eternall felicity which continues for euer. Yet it is true, that the obiects of the senses make a more violent impression in our soules, and that the pleasure which we receiue, toucheth vs much more then that which the spirits gathers from the obiects which

are pleasing vnto it. The which happens first, for that the goods of the body are borne with vs, encrease with vs, and are preserued with vs· So as handling them daily and hourely, we haue a more exact knowledge then of the goods of the vnderstanding, which are remoued from vs.
               We haue said, that knowledge is necessary for the enioying of pleasures: wherefore, where this knowledge hath least power, there the pleasures are least sensible. This also happens, for that we vse pleasures as remedies and cures against the crosses, troubles, and cares of this life, which are sweetned, and as it were charmed by their presence. But most men being

either indisposed, or not capable to raise themselues vp to spiritual consolations, seeke and tye themselues to pleasing obiects, which present thēselues easily to their senses. The which is fortified, for that the sweetnesse of obiects which delight our senses, are suddainely tasted, and doe not much trouble vs to seeke them. It is an infallible Maxime in Philosophy, that the obiects by their presence, make a more powerfull impression in our soules, then when they are absent. And those things which giue vs least paine, are most sweete in their acquisition: so as for all these considerations, the Pleasures of the body seeme vnto vs greater then those of the minde. We may say in

a word, that those of the senses are more sēsible, but these more perfect, & more excellent. In the mean time, all the wise men of the world exhort vs to set a careful guard ouer the Pleasures of the senses, which they call the poyson of the minde. For the which wee must the more carefully prouide; for that these Passions are accompanied with a certaine sweetenesse which flatters vs at her first approach, and surprizeth our iudgement, and charmes it in such sort, as it helpes to deceiue it selfe. So as in this subiect wee must imitate those wise old men of Troy, who counselled Priam to send backe Hellen to the Grecians, and not suffer himselfe to be any longer abused

with the charms of her great beauty: for that keeping her within their City, was to entertaine the siege of a fatall and dangerous warre, and to nourish a fire which would consume it to ashes.
               The euent did shew, that it was wisely fore-seene, and pronounced as an Oracle▪ for in the same manner wee should chase from vs the obiects of Pleasures, lest they be the cause of our ruine. To which purpose an Ancient said, That nature had engrafted no such pernicious Desires, as those of the Pleasures of the body: for that these desires growing vnbridled, doe so enflame the courages where they get possession, as they leaue nothing vndone to content their Passion.
                  
Whence spring treacheries and treasons, which make men to sell their friends and countrey: from thence proceedes ruines and defolation of Estates, & the conspiracies against Common weales. As it appeared in that of Catilyne, who practized the ruine of Rome: from thence the murthers, violences, burnings, and all the miseries of this life, take their spring and beginning. The reason is, for that pleasures quench the Iudgement, and smother all the seedes of vertue and wisedome in man; the which they effect more powerfully, when they are most violent: as it appeares in those which are transported with Loue, who are not maisters of themselues,

but suffer themselues to be wholy guided by their Passions: wherefore a wiseman of the world was wont to say, that he had rather fall into frenzy, then suffer himselfe to bee surprized with Pleasures; for that, sayd hee, Physitians may cure madnes, by purging the braine with Helleborum, whereas Pleasures depriue man of his iudgement, without hope of remedy for his infirmity.
               But for that there are Pleasures not only of the mind, but of the body and senses, which are meerely innocent, as the Pleasure we receiue by Pictures, Perfumes, honest exercises, and other things which bring a chast content; it shall bee conuenient to know what the causes and

obiects bee, to the end wee may of our selues iudge, which are lawfull, and which are interdicted, and to bee abhorred. First then, things necessary for preseruation of our nature, as drinking, and eating, are pleasing vnto man, and the which he vseth with a delight, which moderation and temperance make innocent. Secondly, men take a singular delight in things to the which they haue beene long framed and accustomed, for that custome is as it were another nature, considering that the things whereunto wee haue bene accustomed, and whereof there is framed a long habite, by continuall exercise, haue a great affinity with those of nature. Thirdly, the

things which are conformable to our nature and disposition, are pleasing; for that they force vs not in any sort, but insinuate sweetely into our senses: Whereas on the other side, whatsoeuer brings any constraint vexeth vs, as studies, serious affaires, disputations, and such like, are importune and troublesome; for that they constraine and force our inclinations, vnlesse that custome hath taken away the bitternes. Whereas their contrary please vs, as rest, sleepe, play▪ cessation from labour, sights, and such like, in which wee finde not any constraint. Fourthly, whatsoeuer flatters our desires, giues vs ioy and Pleasure, for that these kinds of Cupidities, are properly the desires of

things which we imagine are pleasing, and rauish our senses: For whatsoeuer flatters our senses, and delights our imagination, causeth Pleasure and content. So euery kind of good, bee it that which is present, or past, or to come, doth giue a content by the presence or by the imagination; for that it delights our senses, and is pleasing to our fancy, which is a delicate power, & easily toucht with the sweeetnesse of her obiect, how small soeuer. Wherefore they that remember the good things which they haue tasted▪ and those which they hope for in future, hauing these things imprinted in their fancy, feele a ioy. Whereby it appeares plainely, that all Pleasure and Delight
                  
consists either in the feeling of things present, or in the remembrance of things past, or in the hope of those which are to come. For we taste and feele the present, we remember those that are past, and we hope for the future. And doubtlesse the things which are grauen in our memory please vs much, not only those which were sweete in the action, but euen those which we haue tasted with some bitternesse, especially when as the paines and toiles we haue indured are ended to our profite & honor: which made an Ancientto say, that it was a sweete thing to remember trauailes past. So souldiers glory of their dangers past, and relate with singular content, the wounds

they haue receiued in combatts.
               They which haue escaped dangers at Sea, or made great and desperate voyages by land, haue the same content to relate the hazards and fortunes which they haue runne and surmounted. The reason of this ioy, and the cause of this content, is, for that it is a sweete thing to be freed from a mischiefe, especially when it hath giuen vs great afflictions and apprehensions.
               But as for that which regards things which depend of hope, all those things whose presence and enioying we imagine will bee pleasing or profitable, and which will cause vs no kind of discontent, excite Pleasure in our

senses, be it when we remember them, or when wee hope for them. So as whatsoeuer we imagine as a good which may befall vs, is pleasing vnto our thoughts: By reason whereof, (as wee will shew hereafter) we feele a content in choller, for that no man is angry, but with hope to bee reuenged, the which hee reputs for a great good. Wherefore Homer made Achilles to say, that choller disperst it selfe in a great courage, more sweetely then hony.
               For as much then as what we remember or hope for, as a thing pleasing and sweete vnto our thoughts, excites ioy in our hearts, therefore most of the desires of men are accompanied with some Pleasure
                  
and delight: For when as they remember how they haue plaied, or when as they imagine after what manner they hope to play, they feele a sensible content and a new ioy, which represents vnto them the image of the true enioying. As it happens to those which haue drunke with delight during a burning Feuer, for they haue a certaine kind of ioy when as they remember to haue so drunke; or when as they promise vnto themselues to drinke againe after the same manner.
               So they that are tormented with Loue, be it that they speake of the party beloued, bee it that they write or make verses of that subiect, they feele a wonderfull content,

for that in all those things, they conceiue that whom they loue is before their eyes, as in their thoughts.
               Wherefore they hold it for a certaine signe of Loue, when as any one afflicts himselfe for the absence of another, and when he takes Pleasure in the teares and complaints of their separation. And it is certaine, that euen in cares and vexation, there is also a content in the teares and sighes wee powre forth for the absence of that wee loue.
               There is doubtlesse a griefe for that we see not the party wee Loue; but there is also a sweetnesse, for that her image presents it selfe vnto our thoughts, and sets before

vs all the motions, gestures, actions, speeches, smiles, grace, sport, and whatsoeuer wee haue obserued in her when shee was truely present.
               Reuenge also, as wee haue formerly toucht, is a sweete thing, the which doth well appeare by her contrary; for if wee see that wee cannot reuenge the iniury which hath beene done vs, and which hath inflamed our Choller, wee feele a wonderfull discontent: whereas wee are transported with ioy when as wee hope and see some appearance of reuenge.
               Moreouer, it doth much content, and giue a singular pleasure, not onely to the ambitious, but indifferently

to al sorts of persons, to vanquish and surmount those, against whom they haue any contention or dispute: for in this concurrence it seemes they dispute of the excellency and superiority, and that it is as it were, adiudged to him that obtaines the victory: and all men liuing, bee they great, meane, or base, desire, (though some more ardently, and others with lesse Passion) to excell and surmount others. By this reason we finde there is pleasure in sports, in which there is any cōtention, as at Chesse, Tennis, Cards, and Dice; and likewise in more serious exercises where there is any dexterity to obtaine the victory; as in fighting at barriers, running at the Ring,

and Tilt, or such like. Wherof some are pleasing as soone as they apply themselues vnto them, and others growe pleasing by custome: as for example, they that giue thē
                  selues to the exercise of hunting, although it bee somewhat violent; yet they receiue a singular content, for that they must fight against sauage beasts, and aspire to get the victory. And according to that which wee haue said, that victory breeds delight, it is easie to iudge why the exercises of schooles, disputations among learned men, and the pleading of Lawyers at the barre, giue a content to them that imploy themselues: the reason is, for that in these exercises, there is also an image of victory

which presents it selfe vnto our eyes.
               Glory in like manner is in the rancke of those things, which causeth delight and Pleasure; for that it consists in a certaine opinion, to be more eminent, and more excellent then other men, by reason of the esteeme the world makes of vs: for euery man imagines himselfe to bee such as others esteeme him; especially, if they bee men which he holds to be ful of truth. Wherein wee giue more credite to neighbours then to those which are remote, who can haue no exact knowledge of our merit. And wee referre more to out fellow Citizens, to our household seruants, and to our familiar friends, then vnto

strangers: yea, wee yeelde more to them that liue, then to posterity: we esteem more the iudgement of wise men, then of them that want wit; and we preferre the testimony of many, before the applause of some few particulars: for that it seemes they whom we preferre, for the aboue mentioned reasons, are better informed of the truth, and more to bee credited in their dispositions. Wherefore wee are better satisfied and contented, to bee in reputation with them, then with the rest of the world: for no man cares to be honored by such as are contemptible, and not regarded.
               Wherefore if we hide our selues from Infants or beasts, it is not for any fear of shame

we haue of them, seeing wee know they are without iudgment, and cannot dishonor vs. It is also a sweete thing to haue a friend, seeing that the very action of Loue, what obiects soeuer she propounds vnto her selfe, is wonderfully pleasing. For no man loues wine who takes not delight to drinke it. No man delights in Armes which takes no pleasure in the exercise; no man loues Philosophy which is not pleased to discourse thereof. In like manner no man loues another, but hee takes pleasure in his friendship.
               And moreouer, it is a sweet thing to see himselfe beloued, for it is as it were a presage, that hee is indued with qualities which makes a man

louely, and to be esteemed by such as haue any feeling of reason. Also euery man thinks he is beloued for the loue of himselfe: The which puffes him vp, and makes him more glorious, & by consequence, fuller of content. For the same reason it is a sweete thing to excite admiration of vs in the hearts of men, for that the honor they yeeld vs, maks vs to haue a good conceit of our selues, which fills vs with ioy and Pleasure: In regard whereof, flatterers charme our mindes, for that these kinde of people offer themselues vnder a shew of friendship, and admirers of our vertues. Moreouer, it is a sweete thing to doe an action often that pleaseth vs, for that custome makes

things easie vnto vs, & consequently pleasing.
               Change is also delightfull vnto vs; for that it is as it were, an imitation of nature, which is pleased in variety, & in the diuersity of things: for that which persists alwayes in one sort, frames an importune custome in its subiect, which continuing too long, comes to corrupt. Where
                     •
                  ore it was wisely said that alterations and changes make all things more sweete and pleasant to our senses. So as they also which come againe by interualls and respits, are more pleasing vnto vs: as the returne of the Spring after the sharpenesse of winter, and the arriuall of our friend after along voyage: for that these things

are not onely done with a change which causeth delight, but also for that they happen rarely, and not at all times, nor in all seasons. Moreouer, it is a great content to behold things which giue vs a subiect of admiration: for the wonder which they stirre vp in our soules, inflames vs, and makes vs desire to know them, and the cause of our admiration. But wee cannot learne any thing of that wee desire to know, but with extreame pleasure; seeing it is as it were, to mount vp to the highest degree of our nature, and to eleuate it to her perfection: wherefore this admiration causeth ioy.
               Againe, they be things full of sweetnesse and Pleasure, to

impart and to receiue benefits; for that in receiuing you obtaine that which men desire; and by giuing, you shew your selfe to haue that which others want, and that you exceede them therein; the which we see with delight as a marke of our excellency. And as to do good is a sweet thing, it followes, that it is pleasing to ease the misery of another, to draw him out of captiuity, and to change the face of his fortune, by making him happy, who was formerly miserable.
               And for that any thing that breedes admiration in our soules, and giues vs any subiect to learne, is followed with pleasure: it therefore happens, that whatsoeuer consists in imitation, brings

contentment, as painting, caruing, and Poesy, which are all professions whose exercises are pleasing, although the things which they imitate be not alwayes delightfull. As for example, the painter leaues not to please himselfe in his Art, although he drawes the portraict of a Moore: Nor the Caruer to content himselfe in his work, althogh he cut a Chimera, or that he fashiō a monster: nor a Poet forbeares not to take delight in his verses, althogh they bee made vpon a Mushrome, a Sparrow, a flea, or some such ridiculous subiect: for that which stirres vp pleasure in the spirit of man, is not the obiect, which hath propounded it selfe, but the knowledge and iudgement

hee makes to haue so well exprest this obiect, as his industry approcheth neere the truth, and is a liuely Image: For that this perfect resemblance betwixt the Image and the Originall, teacheth him some thing which hee knew not before; and withall, it makes him see his industry, and his labour, whereby he enters into admiration of his worke, and pleaseth himselfe to beholde the perfection of his Arte.
               For the same reason, the euents of things not hoped for, nor expected, and the care to bee freed from those wherein there are great dangers, are accompanied with ioy, for that they happen not without amazement.
               
                  In the meane time (for that we haue said, that what is cōformable to the inclinations of nature, is pleasing) we see, that the things which are tied by any bond of Nature, & that haue any affinity one with another, as those which are of one kinde, or which haue any other naturall conformity, are delighted in the company one of another: as Eagles loue Eagles, Lions take pleasure to bee among Lions; and men loue to see themselues among men: and for that euery thing loues that which resembles it. All men loue themselues, althogh some with more vehemency then others; and by consequence they commend their owne workes, they esteeme their discourses, they loue

commonly flatterers, who praise them, they are passionate for glory, for their friends, and for their children who are (as wee may say) their owne workes.
               And by the same reason they are pleased to finish that which they haue begunne; which is to giue perfection to the labour of their hands.
               Wisedome which consists in the knowledge of many excellent & admirable things, procures ioy to him that is adorned, for that it raiseth him aboue the ordinary of men, and giues him a kind of power ouer others, which man desires naturally; and for that men are naturally ambitious of honor, they take delight to shew their authority in commanding others,

and in reprehending them, they make demonstration that they cannot allow of their actions.
               Moreoue, rman hath a singular delight to practize those things wherein he thinkes to excell; for he is neuer tired to shew his industry, & doth willingly spend dayes and nights to become more perfect and to exceed himselfe. The which we haue seene in Apelles, Zeuxis, Protogenes, and other excellent Painters of antiquity. Finally, for that the sports and recreations of the minde are pleasing, and that wee take delight to laugh, and to spend the time Iouially, it followes that all the things which may ferue to that end, as iesters, their actions and words, giue vs

content, and procure delight to behold them.
               These in some are the obiects of Pleasure, which wee feele in this life; we must now see what kind of Pleasures are allowed, and which are iustly forbidden. For the explaining whereof, we must vnderstand that there haue beene Philosophers, who not knowing how to set a difference betwixt the vnderstanding and the senses, and imagining there were no other Pleasures but those of the body, haue condemned them generally as detestable and pernitious. But they had no reason for their assertion, seeing there is not any man that can liue without some kind of sensible and corporall Pleasure; seeing the author of nature

hath vnited this kind of Pleasure and sweetenesse to the actions of this life, to the end wee might with more courage indure the toyles and paines, and that they might bee as salt which seasoneth meate, and which makes it more pleasing to our taste. Wee must then know that Pleasure being a rest of the soule which she hath gotten by some kind of operation, there are some which being conformable to the rules of reason, and to the eternall law which God hath established among his creatures, cannot be held bad, but are meerely innocent; as those which God hath tied to the procreation of children, when as they are tasted in a lawfull marriage, such as hee

hath ordained for the preseruation of mankind. Yet we must confesse, that the discordes of men do commonly peruert the vse, not keeping thēselues within the bounds of reason nor of the law of God; the which is visible in the excesse they commit in drinking, and eating, in women, perfumes, play, dancing, and other Pleasures of the body, which are seene at this day to be no other then subiects of offence: whereby we may see how infamous the opinion of the Epicures was, (from the which notwithstanding many great Personages did beleeue that Epicurus himselfe much dissented, affirming that hee made no account but of the Pleasures of the mind,) who with a visible

reproach to humaine nature, haue placed the soueraigne good of man in the Pleasure of the senses, which notwithstanding are common with bruite beasts. In like manner wee may gather what wrong they did vnto vertue, who by a notable effeminacy, represented the image of Pleasure sitting in a throne like a great Queene, which had vnder her the vertues, as slaues to attend her commandements.
               As if a man in the course of this life, should haue no other obiect in all his actions, yea in the most vertuous, then the satisfying of his Pleasures, and the contentment of his senses. Our resolution then is, that we must not imagine that all the Pleasures
                  
of the senses are to bee reiected as pernitious, neither all to bee imbraced as beames of our soueraigne good.
               But as Pleasure is a rest and contentment to the soule, which enioyeth some good whereof she tastes the sweetnesse; if it bee an absolute good without exception, the Pleasure is innocent and allowable to man. But if it bee a good pleasing only to the senses, and contrary to the rules of reason, and the law of God, as the Pleasures of the flesh out of a chast marriage; the effect is pernitious, and the enioying damnable.
               But for that we haue formerly sayd, that Pleasures regard either the remembrance

of that is past, or the enioying and feeling of a present good, or the hope of a future, it shal bee fit to shew which makes the most powerfull impression in our senses, and delights vs most. We must then know that Pleasure taking her beginning in our soules, by the presence of a good which incounters our senses, or which vnites it selfe vnto vs by some other meanes, this presence or imaginary good is framed by the simple knowledge, and the only Idea which wee haue of this good, so as the obiects wherof we haue knowledge, make an impression of their formes in our soules▪ or else this presence consists in a real vnion of the good with our senses, whether that wee do

actually enioy it, or that wee haue a certaine hope to get it.
               Wherefore as the reall vnion of the obiect with the power is greater and more strict then that which is but imaginary; and as the actuall vnion is stronger then that which is but in power, wee must necessarily conclude, that the sweetest Pleasure is that which proceeds from the feeling and actuall enioying of the good which is really present with our senses.
               But the ioy which springs from hope is greater, and the Pleasure more sweete, for that in this kind of ioy, there is an vnion b
                     •
                  twixt our soule, and the good which pleaseth vs; Not only according to

the imagination, which represents vnto vs the perfections, but also with this condition, that the possession is in our power, for that otherwise wee could not hope for it. Wee put in the last rancke the Pleasure wee feele of good things which are past as the least of all, for that those good things not being vnited to our senses, but by the imagination and memory, which is the weakest vnion that can bee betwixt our senses and the obiects which delight them; the ioy which we receiue must also be lesse sensible.

                  st of all, there is not any man which doth not feele in the midst of the ioy which hee receiues, his heart to dilate it selfe and as it were open with gladnesse, from whence it sends the signes & tokens to the countenance, by the laughter whic

                  irres vp in the

mouth, where it causeth a visible change. They that are tender hearted, are apt to receiue the impressions of ioy and heauines, like vnto soft wax, wherein they do easily imprint the formes which are laid vpon them. They that haue them firme and hot by reason of the heate, conceiue ioy easily, & by reason of their constancy preserue it longer.
               Whereas contrariwise they that haue it cold and hard, are capable of heauinesse & melancholly, which makes an impression easily, by reason of the coldnesse, with the which she hath an affinity, & maintaines it selfe long by reason of the hardnesse, as we see happen vnto melancholy men. For sadnesse is an earthly

                  Passion cold and dry, whereas ioy is moist and hot. And therefore it is easily framed in the hearts of children, of young men, and of those which are of a good complexion: from this ioy which makes the heart to spread and dilate it selfe like vnto a flower, growes laughter, which is no Passion, but an exterior effect of an interior Passion.
               
               For the sweetnesse of Pleasure, makes the heart to moue and open to receiue the forme, euen as when wee go to meete a friend, and open our armes when he presents himselfe vnto vs. And this his motion and interior ioy ascends vp vnto the countenance, but it appeares chiefely in the opening of the

mouth, whereas laughter is framed, and hath his seate, & from thence disperseth it self to the eyes and the rest of the face, although that some hold it hath his seate within man, and about his heart. But to take away all kind of difficulty, wee must vnderstand that sometimes laughter comes meerely from a corporall motion, as that which proceeds from the tickling of the arme holes, so as there haue bin seene sword players die laughing, for that they haue beene wounded in that place.
               Sometimes it riseth from indignation and despight, which we haue conceiued of any thing we behold vnwillingly; as we reade of Hann

                     bal, who seeing the Carthaginians
                  
lament their estates, for that the Romaines were maisters of their fortunes, beganne to laugh

                  d, said vnto him, that it was an act of great inhumanity to laugh at the teares of his fellow Citizens; to whom he answered, that this laughter was no signe of his ioy, but a token of his despight, for that he scorned the fruitlesse teares of those, who lamented rather their particular losse, then the misery of their common weale. But when it is an effect of our passion, and a signe of pleasure which our heart receiueth from pleasing obiects, which present themselues vnto our senses: it comes from a quicke and suddaine motion of the soule, which

desiring to expresse her ioy, excites a great abundance of hot blood, and multiplies the vitall spirits, which agitate and stir vp the muscles which are about the heart, & those raise vp the muscles which are of either side of the mouth, which vpon this occasion opens with a visible change of the whole forme of the face. But it riseth from the pleasure and ioy which our soule conceiueth, by reason of the pleasing obiects which present themselues vnto our sense.
               It is certaine that as new things and not expected, prouoke most ioy in our hearts, so they stirre vs vp sooner to laughter. For proof whereof, hauing once accustomed our selues to see spectacles

and sights, how pleasing soeuer they be, they doe not moue vs to laugh, as they did when wee first behelde them. And in like manner profound cogitations and meditations, hinder laughter: wherefore wise men doe not laugh so easily as others, as well for that they haue alwayes their spirits busied and imployed about some serious meditations, which will not suffer them to regard such triuiall things as commonly make the Vulgar to laugh: As also for that the great knowledge they haue of things, hinders them from esteeming many of those things newe or strange, which the common sort admire. And withall, their complexion do
                     •
                  h contribute

thereunto: for that most commonly it inclines to melancholy, which makes them pensiue, and more difficult to moue to ioy.
               The reason why many things please at the first approach, and afterwards lose this grace by custome and continuance, proceedes from nothing else, but that at the first sight our thought is 
                     •
                  ied vnto it with a certaine vehemency, which yeelding by little and little, makes the pleasure decay. The which is not onely seene in the obiects of the sight, whereof our eyes growing weary by little, begin to slacke in their action, and to become more negligent in beholding them; but also in the obiects of all the other senses, wherewith

our soule is loathed in the end after too long a continuance. The reason is, for that as in the action of the eyes, the vitall spirits consume by the vehemency of the attention: so in all other operations of the senses, the disposition of the Organs alter, and are changed by the motion, and by the impression which the obiects that vnite themselues vnto our senses, make: so as it is impossible that the creature should long enioy one kinde of pleasure, or suffer the same griefe.
               And moreouer, as we haue sayd before, that diuersity, as an Image of the changes of Nature, is pleasing; hath also a place in this subiect: for that men are weary alwayes to enioy the same pleasures,

and see the same obiects. Wherefore the continuance causeth distaste, how sweete soeuer the possession be. And therefore Lucian brings in a man, who beeing made a god, was weary of his diuinity, and desired to dye, that he might bee no more: and his reason was, that the life of men did not seeme tedious vnto him, but onely for that hee still beheld the same things, one Sunne, one, and the same Moone; the same Starres, the same meates, and the same Pleasures, which change not their face: wherfore, sayd he, tasting nothing but the same thing in this Diuinity where I am, I am weary, and thereupon would needes dye to change. Moreouer, there are men who are

wonderfull sensible of ioy, which bee they to whom all things seem new, as children, and the ignorant multitude, whom any sights prouoke to laugh: whereas wise men are nothing mooued. The complexion doth also helpe much to ioy, as they which abound in blood, and haue it not cholericke and adust, but pure and sweete, are Iouiall by nature, and loue to laugh. Whereas mellancholy men are hardly mooued to ioy.
               The delight or pleasure which wee conceiue of the obiects, which are agreeable vnto vs, doth vsually stirre vp in vs an ardent desire, and as it were, a thirst of a new, or a more full enioying. The which proceedes either from

the condition of the thing which is not capable to satisfie our desire at one instant.
               As we see in drinking and eating, to which we must returne diuerse times to entertaine life: Or from the imperfection of enioying, as they which haue but tasted the first sweetnes of friendship, desire to haue a fuller content: Like vnto those which loue Poësie, who hauing heard a peece of a goodly verse, such as Vergil wrote, wish to heare the rest to make their pleasure perfect; Or else it growes from the nature it selfe of Pleasure, which is so sweete as it inflames the soule to desire the continuance: The which is seldome seene in the pleasures

of the senses and of the body, but which is felt with infinite delight by those which drink of that torrent of Pleasure, which the Scripture describes vnto vs in heauen; for they drinke eternally, and are neuer satisfied.
               We must also remember, that there is great difference betwixt the Pleasures of the senses, and of the minde; for the delights of the senses charging and as it were importuning our naturall dispositions, becomes troublesome and tedious; as it falls out when we suffer our selues to be surprized with the excesse of eating and drinking. Whereas those of the mind neuer exceed the carriage nor capacity of the naturall disposition of the soule, but rather

adde perfectiō to her nature: wherefore when they are fully enioyed they delight most. And if there be at any time a distaste, it is for that the actiō of the mind is accō
                  panied with the action of the inferior powers, the which being corporeall, they are tired with the cōtinuance of so long an imployment. Wherefore they call backe the spirit that it may giue some rest vnto the body. And doubtlesse it is the onely reason why those happy soules are neuer weary to behold the diuine Essence, for that the contemplation of this pleasing obiect doth not ouercharge nor weaken the spirits, but doth ease and fortifie them. And moreouer, she doth not worke by the meanes of the senses, and corporeall

Organs, which are subiect to grow slack in their actions.
               I might adde, that this happy contemplation of the diuine Essence, is alwayes accompanied with new subiects of admiration, in regard wherof, it can neuer be troublesome: and moreouer, although the obiect bee soueraignely simple, yet it comprehends all the good things which may fall into the thought or desire of man, so as it can neuer cause any distaste: But this belongs vnto another discourse.
               The pleasure of the senses produceth a pernicious and dangerous effect in vs; it binds our reason and takes away the vse, the which happens by three occasions. The

first, for that imploying the soule wholly in the feeling and enioying of the sweetenesse which doth accompany it, she retires it from the consideration of all spirituall goodnesse, and makes it lesse capable of reason, in regard of the heate of the passion which doth agitate it. Secondly, for that most part of the pleasures of the body, at the least when they tend to excesse and disorder, are contrary to the motions of reason. And it is an vndoubted truth, That one contrary doth alwayes expell and destroy another; wherefore pleasure yeeldes no place to the motions of Reason. The which made Aristotle to say, that although that pleasure corrupts not the Theory and

simple knowledge wee haue of things; as for example, she doth not hinder vs from knowing, that a Triangle hath three corners, and that the whole is bigger then its parts distinctly comprized; yet shee depraues the iudgement, and hinders the esteeme wee should make by the lawes of wisedome, of that which is good: For that although we know well that temperance is a vertue, yet we flie it, for that it is cōtrary to the pleasures of our senses, which suffers vs not to esteeme it as we ought. The third is for that the pleasures of the senses cause a greater and a more violent alteration and change in our bodies, then that of the other Passions.
               
               
                  The reason is, for that wee imbrace with more vehemency, and tie our selues more strictly to the obiects which please vs, when they are present, then when they are absent. These changes and sensible alterations in the body, cause trouble to the soule: As it appeares in those which are surprized with wine, in whose actions there is no shew of reason; the excesse of wine hauing altered their braine, and made them incapable of the functions of the mind. But honest and moderate Pleasure, addes perfection to her actions, as beauty and a good grace giues the last ornament to youth; aswell for that she is the end and scope which wee propound vnto

our selues when we meane to worke: as also for that shee makes her actions agreeable by the content she ingrafts in our senses: So as to entertaine this Pleasure shee causeth vs to imploy our selues with more heate and attention to accomplish them. Wherefore an Ancient sayd, that nature had ioyned Pleasure to actions necessary for the entertainment of the life of creatures, or for the preseruation of their kinds, as eating, drinking, and generation, to the end it might bee as salt which seasoneth meate: That is to say, to the end it might make those actions delightfull, and that the creatures might not bee drawne vnto them with distaste. And touching that

which concernes the allurements and inticements of honest Pleasures, we must still remember the wise counsell of Aristotle, who perswades vs not to obserue them at their first approach, but at their parting; for that although the entry bee sweete and pleasant, the end is alwayes bitter and tragicall. They say that among the Pagans there was a Temple of Diana, whose image did shew a sadde and seuere countenance to those that entred to worship it, but at their departure it seemed more pleasant and smiling: But it is contrary in Pleasures, for at their first approach they present nothing but roses and sweete contents; and in the end they leaue vs nothing

but thornes and importune griefes; especially for that they diuert vs from the soueraigne Good, and from the loue of spirituall delights, without the which our soules can finde no solide nor soueraigne content.
            
         
         
            
               Of Griefe and Heauinesse. CHAP. 1.
               
                  AS among all creatures there is not any one exposed vnto so many outrages of Fortune as man, whom we may rightly tearme an image of misery and weaknes▪ So it is most certaine, that there is not any Passion wherewith hee is more afflicted in this

life, then with Griefe and Sorrow, whose obiects present themselues continually to his sense and mind. Wherefore although that by the light which we finde in contrary things when they are opposed, and compared one with another, we may iudge of the condition of Griefe and Sorrow, by that which we haue spoken of Pleasure and Delight; yet for a more ample knowledge of a thing which is so common vnto vs, it shall be fit to treate more exactly vpon this subiect. Griefe then is a violent Passion of the Soule, entertained by some sensible discontent: Or else, Griefe is a torment of the mind and body: Or againe, Griefe is a Passion of the mind afflicted by some kind of euill which presents it

selfe: Or to describe it more particularly; Griefe is a Passion of the Soule, which riseth from a discontent she receiueth from obiects contrary to her inclinations, which present themselues vnto the senses, and afflict them.
               
               But wee must obserue that there are two kinds of Griefe: The one which resides in the sensuall Appetite; and the other hath his seate in the rationall. This last which afflicts the minde, is properly called heauines, and differs from the other, for that a sensible Griefe is alwayes accompanied with a visible alteration and change of the body which is moued; whereas the Griefe of the mind hath not alwayes an agitation of the body, but

most commonly containes it selfe within the bounds of the power where it is framed; in regard whereof it is sometimes attributed to God and the Angells. These two kinds of Griefe differ also one from another, for that the cause of the sensible Griefe resides in the body, which suffers some violent impression that alters it. But the cause of the intellectuall Griefe resides in the rationall part and in the mind, which represents vnto it selfe the euill which she receiues from the obiects which present themselues vnto her thought. They differ againe, for that the apprehension and knowledge which the exterior senses haue of things, they do only regard the present obiects

which make an actuall impression in them; but the vnderstanding not only conceiues things present, but euen those that are past, and which may happen, or fall vnder the imagination of man. Hence it comes that corporeall Griefe which followeth the apprehension, which present things make in the senses, growes onely from the presence of obiects contrary to their inclinations.
               Whereas the Griefe of the mind following the knowledge of the vnderstanding, may grow from obiects that are present, past, or to come, and from those which man doth presuppose may succeed vnto him. So as the noblest powers of our soule,

and those which are the richest ornaments of our nature, as the vnderstanding, imagination, and memory, helpe to increase our paines, and to augment our afflictions: As if the presence of heauen which giues vs some prerogatiue ouer beastes, should make vs more miserable. For the most sauage beastes flie dangers, when as they present themselues vnto their eyes: But being escaped they remaine quiet and assured; whereas we not only torment our selues▪ for the euill which doth oppresse vs; but euen for which is not yet happened.
               But you must vnderstand that to speake properly, Griefe which is one of the Passions of the soule, is that

which is framed in the sensitiue appetite, with a visible alteration of the body, which is agitated and moued exteriorly by the euill or paine which it suffers: So as the cause doth reside in the body which receiues some kind of outrage. But the motion of Griefe is alwayes framed in the soule, for that the body is not capable but by the presence of the soule. Wee must also remember, that as to excite Pleasure in our senses, the pleasing obiect must not only be vnited, but also knowne and perceiued by the senses, as we haue formerly obserued; so to cause Griefe, the afflicting obiect must touch our senses, so as by the imp

For it is certaine that as there is no good but that which is sensibly present, can cause Pleasure to the senses, so there is not any but a present euill can procure a sensible Griefe. But vnder the obiect of Griefe we comprehend not only the euill which afflicts vs, but also the good which we haue lost. For euen as the weight of bodies causeth that not only they haue an inclination to rest in the center▪ but also is the cause that they are neuer farre remote without suffering a visible violence in their nature: So men are naturally carried not only to Loue, but with a sensible Griefe of their losse. So the couetous man torments himselfe for the losse of his wealth; The voluptuous is

grieued to see an end of the obiects of his content; The mother afflicts her selfe for her only son▪ & we see many who after good cheare, great feasts, and dancings, hauing spent the time in all kind of Pleasures, suddenly grow heauy and pensiue; and yet can giue no reason of this sudden change, which proceeds only from the disquietnesse of our minds, which grieues at contentments past, and afflicts it selfe, the which makes him heauy; and this heauinesse conuerts into melancholy, which augments his anguish, and torments him without any other forme of euill, that presents it selfe vnto his senses. As for the causes of griefe and Heauinesse, being consisidered

in regard of their subiects where they incounter, we obserue three. For first of all, our Cupidities and Desires, do many times cause great vexation and discontents, as when any one is surprized with the Loue of a pleasing obiect, if they hinder the enioying, or but only delay the possession, they are so many thornes of Griefe which pierce his soule. For as the hope to obtaine the possession causeth Pleasure and Delight; so the despaire to attaine vnto that we passionatly desire, giues cruell afflictions and insupportable torments.
               Moreouer, the Loue wee beare to the preseruation of our bei
                     •
                  g, doth oftentimes cause sorrow and 
                     〈…〉
                  ,

for that we apprehend the destruction; euen as wee see all creatures afflict thēselues for that which offends them, and are very carefull to shelter their bodies from all outrage. Wherefore wee may say, that Griefe is no other thing, but an apprehension and feeling of the destruction of our good, which makes vs impatient. Thirdly, the soule helpes to afflict herselfe, whether that melancholy workes this effect, or that the continuall afflictions oppresse her in such sort, as she doth nothing but sigh vnder the burthen of sorrow, and like vnto a bad Pilot which abandons his ship to the waues and storme, shee suffers her selfe to be so ouercome with Griefe, as she augments her owne paine and increaseth

her misery. For we often see men who in the middest of their afflictions and discontents do nothing but sigh and powre forth teares, and will not yeeld themselues capable of any kind of consolation. But although wee shew our selues more sensible of the Griefe of the senses, then that of the mind, yet it is most certaine, that the interior Griefes which afflict the soule, are much greater then the exterior paines which torture the body. For that the apprehension of the mind and imagination, is much more powerfull, and more noble then that of the senses, and especially then that of feeling which hath the greatest share in corporeall paines. For

proofe whereof, wee see great courages to auoyd inferior Griefe, expose themselues voluntarily to the exterior paines of torments and punishments, which are in some sort pleasing vnto them, for that the interior ioy doth mollifie their paine: Whereof wee haue glorious examples in the constancy of our Martyres, who to auoyd the blame and aspersion which had bene layd vpon them, to haue offended God in burning incense to Idolls, haue exposed themselues to the fire, to tortures, to wheeles, and to the rage of wilde beasts, for that they would not bee subiect to that ignominious reproach.
               Finally, heauines hath troublesome effects, for that

first of all, if it be excessiue, it quencheth the spirit, and takes from it all meanes to attend the search of truth. The reason is, for that all the powers of our soule, being tied vnto their essence, as the branches vnto the tree, it doth of necessity follow, that when shee is wholy busied in the functions of one of her powers, shee abandons the rest, and cannot assist them in their actions.
               Wherefore when as any thing drawes the soule wholy vnto it, and imployes her whole action, shee cannot attend any thing else: by consequence whereof, an exceeding heauines seazing vpon her, it drawes her away; so as shee cannot thinke of any thing else, feeling her selfe

opprest with Griefe as with a heauy burthen, which beares her downe and hinders the liberty of her functions. It is therefore generally true, that there is no action of the soule whereunto heauines is not a hindrance and let. The which we find verified in our selues, for wee neuer do any thing so well being possest by cares as when we are in ioy; whereof the reason is visible; for that the will is the cause which excites vs to act, the which hath the good for obiect, and makes the more powerfull effect, when it appeares pleasing and is accompanied with delight. It is true, that when there remaines any hope to surmount the causes of our displeasure, then heauines may

serue to fortifie our action and to inflame our courage; for that the more we feele any Griefe, the more wee striue to bee freed from it. But if there be no hope remaining, we become as it were senselesse, and abandon our selues in prey to Griefe.
               
               We flee the company of men, we hate the light, wee find the comforts and consolations of our friends importune, and we haue no content but to feed our selues with bitternesse. Besides the torments which heauines giues vnto our spirits, she doth also produce fearefull effects vpon our bodies; for that it is a maligne, colde and dry Passion, which wasteth the radicall humor, and by little and little quenching the naturall

heate of the body, thrusts her poyson euen vnto the heart, whose vigor shee causeth to wither, and consumes the forces by her bad influence; whereof wee see the signes after death, when as they come to open those that haue beene smothered with melancholy. For insteed of a heart, they find nothing but a drie skinne like to the leaues in Autumne. So as all things exactly considered, we may say, that there is not any thing that doth so much aduance our dayes as this cruell Passion, which thus consumes our forces, causeth our heart to languish, and makes our life short, but extreamely miserable.
               There are many remedies against this Passion, but most

commonly the Griefe is so obstinate, as all applications are vnprofitable. To cure it, we must first take away, or at the least diminish the opinion of the euill which afflicts vs: the which is easie to do, seeing it depends of our opinion.
               For as dignities, honors, crownes, and triumphs, giue vs no content, but what wee take our selues when as they arriue; for that we haue seene many weepe euen in the middest of all this pompe: so the paines of this life, ignominies, banishment, the losse of goods and kinsfolkes, with all other miseries, afflict vs not extraordinarily, vnlesse wee our selues make them more bitter and violent by our owne weaknesse; for that

we haue seene many laugh in the middest of all these miseries: wee must then represent these things otherwise then the Vulgar esteeme them; for that the true cure of the euill must not bee expected from time, but by our reason, which must preuent it. Otherwise wee shall receiue this disgrace, that it will cause vs to do that we would not, although it were in our power. For there is no Griefe so bitter but time doth moderate, seeing that, as wee haue sayd, the greatest pleasures decrease by too long enioying, which causeth our soule to grow slacke; so it is most certaine that excessiue sorrow by little and little decayes, by the continuance and custome which the soule takes

of the Griefe. The which may also happen, for that time doth change the condition of things and giues them another face, and so doth mollifie or wholy take away the sorrow.
               But not to yeeld to the euill when it comes to seaze vpon vs, we must foresee the accidents of this life, not as if they should happen infallibly, for that were to make vs miserable before the time; but as incident to all men, and that being of this number, if any crosse or misery shall fall vpon vs, we may bee the lesse amazed. For the crosses of Fortune which wee haue foreseene, strike vs more gently, and make a weaker impression in our soule. Wherefore a wiseman of the

world, who had prepared himselfe for all the accidents of this life, receiuing the heauy newes of the death of his sonne, was no otherwise moued, but only sayd, I knew I had begotten a mortall creature. Doubtlesse it is the effect of an exact and singular wisedome, to haue this feeling of humaine accidents, not to bee amazed at that which happens, nor to see any thing befall him, which he hath not foreseene. So as a wiseman must alwaies remember, that dangers, losses, banishment, infirmities, yea the death of his children, wife, and that which he holds most deare, are things which may happen dayly, and which threaten all men; and therefore if hee bee exempt,

it is the benefite and guift of God; and if they befall him, that they are the miseries of his nature. For hauing this consideration of the common miseries of men, he finds himselfe bound 
                     •
                  o suffer constantly and with patience, the necessities and crosses of this life: Least he should seeme to fight against God, who hath layd this yoake vpon him, to punish his offences, or to keepe him in awe.
               But to mollifie our sorrowes, wee must remember that the miseries of this life giue vs a glorious subiect to exercise our vertue, and to shew our constancy before the eyes of heauen and earth, which are witnesses of our combatts. For as Pilots cannot

shew their art and industry but in stormes, nor soldiers giue proofes of their valour but in the middest of dangers: So a vertuous man hath no meanes to make his vertues shine, but amiddest the aduersities which befall him in this life; as for example, wee should haue knowne nothing of the great resolution of Sceuola, if hee had not fallen into danger before the King of the Tuscanes, who was rauisht with admiration, seeing with what constancy he burnt his own hand, & suffered without amazement the violence of the fire, into the which hee thrust it, for that he had fa
                     •
                  ld of his enterprize. Neither should wee know the notable temperāce of Fabrititus, nor the moderation

he shewed in refusing the gold and presents of Pyrrhus King of Albania, if pouerty had not bene familiar vnto him. So Regulus being pierced with nailes, and torne in pieces with punishments, seruing as a spectacle of the Carthiginians in humanity, purchased an immortall name for his constancy. So Socrates seeing himselfe condemned to drinke poyson, and beholding the cup into the which the hangman powred that mortal draught without any palenesse or amazemēt, deserued to be admired by his enemies. After their example, then a wiseman will conceiue, that the afflictions of this life offer him a goodly occasion to shew his constancy, and to

make his vertues shine; and therefore they shall not be able to afflict him immoderatly, nor to torture his minde extraordinarily: But that which should most fortifie him in this thought, is, that God which doth cast him into the middest of these combatts, will crowne his constancy, and not suffer him to remaine without reward. Moreouer, we may also striue to diuert it by some pleasing imployment, which may cause vs to turne our eyes from the fearefull image of the euill which afflicts vs, representing vnto our selues obiects which are more sweet and delightfull, then those which torture vs so cruelly.
               Finally, to draw together as it were into one body, all

the meanes wee haue to charme our cares & griefes; heauines is disperst, ether for that wee see our selues freed from the euill which did persecute vs, or that wee recouer the possession of the good which had beene wrested from vs, and wee had lost: or else for that the misery wherewith wee haue beene crost, is as it were recompenced by some other felicities which befall vs; as the sweetnesse of these last contents, takes away all the bitternesse of our forepassed afflictions, as would befall him that should be drawne out of prison and from bonds, to bee set in a royall throne, and to haue a scepter put into his hand, and a crowne vpon his head.
               
                  
                  Griefe is also dispersed by diuertisments, by affaires, by the entertainment of wisemen, by the discourse of such as are learned and feare God, and by the force of our owne iudgement, conceiuing with our selues that we should not suffer any misery to triumph ouer our constancy; that to suffer our selues to bee vanquished by Griefe, were to shew the weaknesse of our courrage; and that to bee toucht with afflictions, is a thing common to all men, but the glory of this constant oppositiō
                  ▪ belongs only to an eminent vertue. And lastly, that he who sends vs these afflictions, is a Father, and no executioner: That it is that great God, without whose decree there falls not a haire

from our heads, & whose will no man may contradict, vnlesse hee will shew himselfe desperately mad. After all this we must remember, that Griefe is neuer cured, but rather inflamed by Griefe. And therefore as in other infirmities of the soule, a greater euill makes the lesse to be forgotten, so wee may disperse a present heauinesse, either by shewing that it is not the present misery which we must lament, but others that are more cruell, which threaten vs: As if hee who is afflicted for the losse of his goods bee in danger to lose his life, by publicke iustice: Or else in fortifying our resolutions with a better hope, as in representing vnto himselfe the glory of paradise, after the

miseries of this life, and the crownes of heauen after the combatts of the earth. All these things make great impressions in religious soules, capable of the feeling of piety.
               Besides all this, there are remedies which are taken from the obiects of the senses, which recreate the mind and body in the middest of Griefe. For first, whatsoeuer delights and giues ioy vnto the senses, causeth ease to the heauinesse of the soule; for that ioy is to the soule that which rest is to the body. So as they which rest repaire their forces, mollifying the paine which hath tyred thē; so they which begin to taste any sweete pleasures, feele their Griefe to decay by

little and little, and their heauinesse to vanish away & go to smoake. Wherefore it is fit to draw them that are afflicted, into the fields, to enioy a free aire and the sight of heauen.
               It is good to shew them haruest, riuers, meadows, and hills; for that these diuerse obiects diuert the afflicted soule, and make it forget a part of its Griefe, so as all hideous shapes are defaced by the presence of these sweeter obiects. Some haue thought that musique consorts and instruments, are fit to charme our melancholies, whereunto they referre that which the Scripture sayth, that Dauid by the sound of his harpe did pacifie the euill spirit which tormented Saule, but experience

hath taught vs, that all these things do many times rather entertaine melancholy then disperse it. Wherefore in this subiect wee must obserue the nature of the infirmity, and the quality of the musique, which must be cheerefull to driue away heauinesse.
               The vse of wine hath also a particular vertue to expell cares: And we haue seene in our time a great Prince desperately afflicted for the death of his only sonne, could finde no other remedy for his Griefe, then to vse the strongest wine that could be gotten. The reason is, for that wine being moist and hot, it doth at one instant both water sweetly, and heat that bilious humor, which is

as it were the center & roote whereunto melancholy doth fixe it selfe. Sleepe also and the vse of Bathes, are very behoouefull; for that both the one and the other reduce nature to her first habite, and restore her good constitution which Griefe had corrupted; the which disperseth heauinesse, and causeth ioy to enter into the afflicted soule.
               Teares are also proper to disperse heauinesse: yea wee finde many times in our bitterest griefes, that teares diminish our paine, and mollifie our miseries how sharpe soeuer.
               The which happens for two reasons. The first, for that the things which are pernitious vnto vs and remaine inclosed within vs,

hurt vs more then when they are without: But when wee powre forth teares, we cast out that which afflicts vs, & emptying the humor which oppresseth vs, and smothers vs within, by this meanes we free our selues from a heauy burthen which lay vpon our hearts, by reason whereof our soule helping her selfe to cast out the enemy of our life diuerts and frees her selfe from the importune thought of Griefe, and imployes her imaginatiō in this diuertisement, the which for this occasion is pleasing vnto her, and doth ease her in her afflictions.
               The second reason is, for that it is a contentment to man, to do an act befitting the estate wherein hee finds himselfe. So as if amiddest

the mourning of our friends, we chance to laugh vnaduisedly, when wee enter into consideration with ourselues, this lightnesse doth displease vs, for that laughter agrees not well with mourning; and there is nothing doth accord and concurre better with the condition of miserable men thē teares, wherefore they are pleasing vnto them, and by consequence sweeten their torments.
               And not onely the teares which afflicted persons poure forth are sweete vnto thē, but euen those of their friends do comfort them: whereof wee may yeeld two reasons, the one, for that naturally they who grone vnder any burthē, feele his hand sweete, which labours to discharge them, or

which helpe to support them. So friends from whom pitty and compassion wrest teares in the middest of their friends misery, endeauoring as it were to ease him of the burthen which doth presse him downe, sweeten his paine, and make him endure his affliction with more constancy and resolution. The other, for that he that sees his friends participate with his Griefe, knowes thereby that their affections are sound, and that they loue him sincerely; which is the sweetest thing that may happen in this life: wherfore this thought makes his affliction more supportable; whereby hee comforts himselfe in his discontent.
               But all these remedies are not so powerfull against

                  Griefe, as the contemplation of the first truth, which dispersing her beames in our soules, fills them with so pleasing a splendour, as they remaine rauisht with ioy and content. For it is certaine that this kind of contemplation is so sweete and delightfull of it selfe, as it expells and disperseth all his cares and Griefe that applies himselfe vnto it. The which shee workes the more powerfully, if the soule be enflamed with the loue of true wisedom, which consists in the contemplation of the first cause, which is God. So as the soule reioyceth in the middest of the afflictions of this life, thinking still of the sweete Idea's of the glory of heauen.
               In regard whereof some

Martyres haue giuen a thousand testimonies of ioy in the midst of their torments: And some marching barefooted vpon burning coales, haue protested constantly and truely, that they thought they trod vpon Roses. But we haue spoken sufficiently of Griefe in generall, let vs now come vnto the buddes which she produceth, and to the species in particular, which are contayned vnder the generall, as miserie, indignation, enuy, and emulation, without the explayning whereof this treaty would be imperfect.
            
            
               
               Of Mercy and Indignation. CHAP. 2.
               
                  ALthough there bee some Philosophers who obseruing the impression and wound which the pitty wee haue of another mans miseries makes in our hearts, haue absolutely condemned al the motions of this Passion, as vnworthy the greatnesse of our courrages: Yet we must confesse, that amidst so many strange accidents which happen in the course of this life, amiddest the great pou
                     •
                  rties and miseries of men,

the cruel infirmities, banishments, tortures, punishments, shipwracks, burnings, slaughters, and all other calamities aswell priuate as publicke which makes them miserable; they must haue abandoned all feeling of humanity if they should not be toucht with Griefe when as these miseries offer thēselues vnto their eyes. For notwithstanding the saying of these Philosophers, that great spirits in the which vertue hath taken deepe roote, see all things without perturbation, and wipe away the teares of those that weepe without any motion: that is to say, that men perfectly vertuous giue almes to the poore, stretch forth their hands vnto him that is in danger of

shipwracke, vntie the bonds of those that are in seruitude, giue liberty to a sonne for the teares of his mother, interre the bloody carcasse of him who hath bene transpierced with wounds, and yet his heart is not toucht with any feeling of all these miseries; yea and in these accidents they retaine still the same countenance with the which they behold playes & shewes vpon a theater. These are words which haue more shew and pompe then solide truth. Let vs then leaue this inhumaine Philosophy which makes men rather stupid then constant, & to become insensible of the miseries of this life; and let vs consider more exactly of the true nature of this Passion, which

giues vs a commendable feeling.
               
                  Mercy is a Griefe or feeling which we haue of another mans miseries, whom we hold worthy of a better fortune. This feeling and Griefe is framed in our soules, for that we consider, that what hath befallen him may happen to all the world: And particularly for that wee imagine that the like misfortune may ouertake vs, or some one of our friends: for it is most certaine that such as feele their hearts toucht with pitty, must bee in that estate as they thinke that either themselues or their friends may fall into the like accident, and runne into the same misfortune that he hath done, whose misery doth moue them to

this commiseration. Wherefore first of all, they that are at the height of humaine miseries, and cannot feare a more wretched condition then that whereunto they are reduced, are neuer toucht with any kind of compassion, for that no kinde of Griefe presents it selfe vnto their eies but they think they haue tried it. And also for that they imagine that all the afflictions which may happen, are as it were mixed with those they suffer. Secondly, they that at the height of worldly felicity, haue no feeling of pitty, but are rather transported with insolency and contempt, then to haue any compassion of the miserable. For imagining themselues to enioy all kind of

ioyes & contentments, they presume that no disaster can befall them which may ouerthrow their fortunes, for that this confidence is as a part of their felicity.
               This second consideration made Aristotle to say, that Mercy had no place in the diuine Essence; for that it is soueraignely happy, and that nothing is able to trouble or diminish her felicity. But here he considers Mercy as a sensible Passion which doth moue and mollifie the heart, and doth imprint a feeling of another mans misery in his soule which desires to releeue him. And of this sort without doubt there can bee no Mercy found in God, who is as free from Humaine Passions, as the heauens and plannets

are exempt from the qualities and impressions of the Elements: but taking Mercy according to her effect, which is to releeue the miserable, were to ruine mankind which subsists by his bounty, to deny that it is in him: For this soueraigne felicity which hee enioyeth from all eternity, without any apprehension that he may euer lose it, doth not hinder him to releeue vs in our afflictions, & to draw vs out of our misery, by the sole inclination of his bounty, who hath nothing common with the hardnesse of Tyrants, nor with the stupidity of the wretched. But let vs returne to our discourse.
               They that are capable of Mercy, are such as first of all

imagine themselues to bee subiect to the accidents of this life, and who haue already tried and escaped them, or which apprehend to feele the rigor. And for this reason they which haue liued long are commonly inclined to pitty, both for that experience hath taught them that neither Diademe nor Crowne, nor riches, honors, health, nor present prosperities, can shelter man from the stormes and tempests which assaile his life; as also for that age filles them with iudgement and makes them wise, not to trust to fortune, which seemes to haue no other constancy, but alwayes inconstant in the fauours which she bestowes vpon vs. In like manner men subiect

to infirmities, weake persons and destitute of meanes, who see themselues exposed to all kinds of outrages; yea and learned men who haue the knowledge of the accidents and miseries of this life, are easily moued to pitty, for that they can duely consider of things, and iudge vprightly of the affaires of the world. Wherefore an excellent and wise Romane Captaine, hauing defeated a mighty King of Macedon in battaile, when as they brought this miserable Prince prisoner vnto him, hee rose from his seate, and with teares in his eyes went to meet him, as a great personage fallen by some misfortune, or by the wrath of the gods, into that lamentable accident:
               
                  And hauing cast himselfe at his feete, hee could not endure it, but raisd him vp with all humanity. Afterwards retiring himselfe, and thinking deepely of the miseries of this life, he made a speech vnto his children and to the young men that were about him, to purge their soules from all insolency and vanity, by so prodigious an example of humaine frailty. But wee must returne to our discourse.
               They that haue wife, children, and a great number of friends, are also inclined to pity, for that as we haue said, they still apprehend the common miseries, and think that the like misfortunes hang ouer their families. But they that are transported with a

violent Passion of Courage, Choller, or Hardinesse, are nothing moued; for that the heate of their blood▪ and the excesse of their Passion, will not suffer them to thinke seriously of these things, and to care for future euents. An extraordinary feare doth also hinder the feeling of pitty, for that they which are seazed therewith, being tied to their priuate miseries, haue no time to thinke of another mans. So he that hath lost his children, or seene his house burnt, thinkes not of him that is led to the gallowes, or to bee broken on a wheele.
               But we put in the ranke of those which are touched with pitty, those soules which haue not yet lost all feeling of

mankind, but beleeue that there are yet good men liuing in the world. For they that imagine there are no vertuous persons vpon earth, perswade themselues also that all men deserue the miseries they suffer, and by that reason beleeue that they are vnworthy of compassion: Whereof we haue a monstrous example in that Athenian, who had no Pleasure in this world but to see the 
                     ••
                  ine of mankind. Finally men suffer thēselues to be moued 
                     •
                  o pitty, when as they remember that they haue groned vnder the burthen of afflictions which they see other men endure: Or when as they apprehend the 
                     •
                  ike calamities may befall them or their friends.
               But let vs see what things

are worthy of pitty and compassion. They are generally all those which cause Griefe to the mind, or torment to the body: Those which take away life; make families desolate, and cause some gre at changes and alterations in the fortunes of men. As for example, punishment, violent deaths, disgraces, pouerty in age, incureable diseases, great languishings, & insupportable want, or extreame pouerty, treachery, or losse of friends, burnings, and shipwracke, are all miserable things and excite to pitty. Wee may also put in this rancke the monstrous deformities of counterfaite bodies, the accidents of limmes lamed, or benummed, and the ruines which happen to

men by the treachery of those from whom they should expect all support. Wee may also comprehend the miseries which befall vs often, or which happen after other accidents. And in like manner the benefits which come out of season: As if a Prince should send presents of gold and siluer to one that were dead of hunger.
               Finally, it is a miserable thing neuer to haue felt any good or contentment in this life, or if any hath happened, not to haue had meanes to enioy it.
               But for that these obiects of misery do not alwayes make an equall impression in our senses, we must now know who they bee whom wee do chiefely pitty, when we see

them ingaged in any misery. First of all, wee are greatly moued to compassion and mercy to those persons whom we haue knowne familiarly, and with whom we haue had some kind of friendship, at the least if they be not strictly tied vnto vs by naturall affinity and blood: For as for those which touch vs so neere, we haue a feeling more violent then that of pitty. In regard whereof wee reade of Amasis King of Egypt, who seeing his own son drawne to execution, he neeuer shed one teare, as if he had had no feeling; whereas perceiuing one of his friends opprest with pouerty and begging his bread, hee wept bitterly, thinking that teares were not sufficient to witnesse his

first Griefe, but they were due vnto the second. In like manner those strange accidents which happen to those of our blood and which touch vs so neere, are full of horror & amazement, and by their excesse suppresse our teares, yea and depriue vs of our speech, as if the spirit were wholy retired to consider of the violence of our Griefe; whereas the miseries of our other friends mollifie our courrages, and by the wound they make in our hearts, send teares vnto the eyes, which we powre forth, and are as it were the blood of that part wounded and opprest with affliction.
               Moreouer, men haue pitty of those whom they see neere vnto some great misfortune:

As when they are ready to be buried in the waues of the sea by some accident of shipwracke; or of those who are to haue a member cut off, or to receiue some notable violence, yea or some indignity. Particularly men are toucht with pitty, when as they that are exposed to outrages, or endure great calamities, are their equalls in age, in humors, in quallities, in exercise, or in breeding. For all these things make deepe impressions in the thought, that they are subiect to the like miseries; wherefore they are moued to take cōpassion of their miseries, being an ordinary thing to pitty those which suffer any affliction, which we ourselues apprehend. And to the end we may be sensible

in the feeling of a misfortune which befalls another, wee must haue it as it were present before our eyes: for that we are not much moued with those miseries whose forme is remote from vs. As for example, wee are not much moued to teares by the relation of the miseries which the slaues of Byserte and Algier endure.
               And in like sort our hearts are not much mollified for any tragicall accident which happened a thousand yeares since, neither do we care much for that which shal succeed after the reuolutions of many ages. Wherefore in old time the Romans to moue the Magistrates to mercy, striued to make a more sensible impression of their miseries, by

causing their wiues, children, and families to come desolately vnto the place of iustice: And as for themselues they appeared in iudgement with garmēts befitting their fortunes, all filthy and torne; they opened their breasts & other parts of their bodies, to shew the wounds they had receiued in the seruice of the common wealth: Yea they caused tables to bee drawne where their misfortunes were painted▪ the which they presē
                  ted vnto their Iudges, to the end that hauing before their eies so mourneful a spectacle, they might take cōpassion of their misery; being most certaine that the voice, attire, carriage, countenance, gesture, and presence, of the miserable, make powerfull impressions

in our hearts, and incite men more to pitty: The which happens for that these things make vs as it were present by the sight of another mans misery. And therefore a bloody roabe, (as that of Caesar murthered in the Senate) being showne to expresse the misfortune of a Prince, did not onely wrest forth teares, but euen inflame the people to reuenge so pittifull an accident. For the same reason wee feele our selues much touched with griefe and pitty, when as wee heare the complaints, sighes, teares, and lamentation, of these which are opprest by some notable calamity: As when we behold the Agonies of those that are exposed to a cruell and shamefull death:

And we are the more moued to pitty and commiseration, when they are worthy and vertuous men, whose vertue and glory past, makes their ends the more lamentable and tragicall,
               For this consideration moues vs the more, both for that the euill is neere vs, and that our eyes are spectators, as also for that the Image of their vertue, and the glory of their precedent liues, increaseth the indignity of their punishment.
            
            
               
               Of Indignation. CHAP. 3.
               
                  AS Mercy or pitty is a signe of a good soule, so this other Passion which we cal Indignation, and which is no other thing but a grieuing & repining wee haue at the good Fortune which befalles the wicked, who are altogether vnworthy, is very commendable in vs. For as pitty is framed of the Griefe which we feele for the miseries of good men, or whō we iudge worthy of better fortunes; so Indignation proceeds from the discontent we receiue to see the wicked

flourish and enioy the worldly blessings which they haue not deserued; so as either of these Passions is commendable, for that as wee should afflict our selues to see vertuous men ouertak
                     •
                  n by mi
                     •
                  
                  fortunes, from the which their vertue should exempt them: so we should bee greiued to see men execrable for their crimes, aduanced to the height of honors and wordly dignities, which good men should enioy. For whatsoeuer befalls a man contrary to his merrit, is full of outrage and iniustice; wherefore Aristotle did not forbeare to say, that Indignation is a thing which is found euen in the diuinity, to the which the prosperities of the wicked cannot be pleasing.
               
                  But to enter into the matter, you must vnderstand, that as Indignation is a griefe which wee feele, & a despight which we conceiue at the great prosperity of those whom wee hold vnworthy for their crimes, yet this Passion is not framed in our soules for all kind of prosperities which may befall them: For that no man hath any reason to bee troubled to see the wicked change their life vnto a better, to imbrace piety, to become iust, valiant, moderate, wise, and adorned with other vertues. Yea, the most innocent soules reioyce whensoeuer they see a man who was formerly vicious and disordered, become vertuous and temperate. There being no man liuing that is vnworthy

of vertue, seeing that vertue by her presence doth extinguish vice, and makes man worthy of the blessings of this life; whereas they that are destitute of this ornament, deserue them not. So as if hee who was formerly wicked, becomes vertuous, by this change hee makes himselfe worthy of all good fortune, and therefore if any happen vnto him we should not be grieued; as in like manner wee should not take pitty of those who remaine obstinate in their crimes, and glory in their vices.
               The goods then which we grieue and disdaine to see the wicked enioy, are the goods of the body and those which we call of Fortune, that is to say, nobility, beauty, honors,

scepters, Crownes, Empires, and such like. As for example, there is no good man but doth grieue and tremble to see the Tyrants of the East, the cruell and infidell race of the Ottomans hold the goodliest scepter, enioy the richest citties, and command ouer the most powerfull prouinces of the world.
               And in like manner there are no vertuous soules that can without griefe & Indignation see other wicked men to flourish and abound in all sorts of honor and riches. But especially our despight is inflamed, when as they are men who haue crept vp to the height of glory in an instant, and when they are very prodigies of Fortune, being aduanced before they were in

a manner knowne to bee in the world, or at the least were in any sort respected. For as for those which hold their Nobility from precedent ages, who are rich by succession and inheritance, and who hold all the aduantages they haue from nature, although they be altogether vnworthy, yet wee endure them with lesse impatiency then we do new men, who are risen to a monstrous prosperity in one day. The reason is, for that they which enioy their glory and riches from their ancestors, seem to haue nothing but what belongs vnto them by the right of nature and blood; whereas men aduanced to new honors, without merite, seeme to bee rich with the spoyles of vertue,

and to enioy the goods which in no sort belong vnto them.
               And for the same reason, although that sometimes the goods of the body, as beauty, health, and disposition, meeting in men which deserue them not, may raise in our soules some clouds of Indignation and despight to see these presents of nature so vnworthily prophaned; yet wee do not conceiue so galling a discontent, as when we see them enioy the goods which we call of Fortune, as charges, dignities, offices, the gouernment of state, and the mannaging of great affaires; all which things seeme to bee due to vertue. For this cōsideration it is an insupportable thing, to see a

man of the common sort, wholy destitute of vertue, and full of all vice, attaine to the first dignities of a Realm, and in the twinckling of an eye to become as powerfull as the greatest Princes. And there is no doubt but all good men tremble when they see these prodigious aduancements of persons taken from the scumme of the people, without any consideration of merit.
               Yea these sudden changes are as it were odious, & contrary to nature which requires time in her actions. And for the same reason wee see, that the people submit themselues willingly vnder the obedience of a Prince who holds the scepter of his Ancestors, and is come to

the Crowne by the right of succession; but when they seeke to giue them a new maister, which is not issued from the extraction of their Kings, they cannot endure him, but easily shake off the yoake whereunto they haue not bene accustomed. And in like manner, no man is grieued to respect them that are descended from ancient Nobility, but they can hardly yeeld honor to those whose nobility is but newly discouered. The reasō is, for that men beleeue, that the ancient Nobility being in possession of this glory, no man should repine to yeeld him that which time hath gotten him, which is a right in a manner equall to that which nature giues; for that the things which we

enioy by a long continuance of yeares, seeme to be gotten and held as it were inpropriety, not by the indulgence of men, but by the bounty of nature. And withall that which hath continued so long, hath a greater affinity with the truth, whose lasting is eternall, then that which is but newly sprung vp within few dayes.
               But there is one thing that filles our soules with Indignation, when as wee see any one enioye those goods, which haue no coherence with his quallity: As when (to the great reproach of piety) wee see a Knight, a Captaine, a Souldier, or any other making profession of armes, to hold bishopprickes, to enioy Abbeys, and to possesse other

dignities of the Church; we hold this much more vnworthy, then if they gaue the charge of Campe-maisters, and of Colonels of foote or horse to religious men or Bishops. Or if they made a singing man or Clarke of the Kings Chappell, Generall of his armies. Finally, we hold it a thing very vnworthy, to see a yong man inferior in all kind of qualities to a reuerent old man, contest with him of merit and glory; especially when it falles out betwixt men of the same profession, betwixt whom this inequalitie is remarkeable. And admit they be not men of the same profession, yet we hold it an vnworthy thing that one who is inferior in all poynts to another, should

contest against him. As if a Musitian would equall himselfe to a President or Counsellor of the Court, remembring not that the charges of Iustice are farre more honorable then the profession of Musicke; this would make all men to tremble which know what difference there is betwixt gold & lead. They which easily conceiue indignation, are first of all men indowed with some eminent quality, who see themselues reiected from dignities and offices, or which see men altogether vnworthy, aduanced to the same honours whereunto they haue attayned by their vertue: For doubtlesse it is no iust thing to place so vnequall persons in the same ranke. Moreouer

vertuous soules and adorned with bounty, haue a great disdaine to see good men depriued of the iust reward of their vertue, and the wicked raised to honours which they could not hope for. The cause is, for that those soules haue their iudgement pure, and can esteeme things according to their weight and value: And therefore they abhorre vice, and haue vertue in singular recommendation. Againe, they that loue honors and charges, are subiect to indignation, especially when as they aspire to those places which are held by vnworthy persons. In like manner, they that haue a good opinion of themselues, and 
                     •
                  ho beleeue they deserue 
                     •
                  ore then all the world besides,

are subiect to the motions of indignation, when as any one enters into comparison with them. Whereas contrariwise▪ seruile soules, men borne in barbarisme, and grosse spirits, are not transported with any thing, hauing nothing in them that may quicken this passion. Yet there are some which do rather referre the motions of ambitious & presumptuous men to meere enuy, then to a iust indignation: For that indignation being a commendable passion, & which proceeds from the feeling of vertue, it cannot subsist with the vanity and arrogancy which accompany those men, but it must bee another passion which kindles in their soules this kind of despight.
            
            
               
               Of Enuy and Emulation. CHAP. 4.
               
                  AS Crocodiles haue their breeding, and liue in the goodliest and richest riuer in the world; and as other venemous beasts are commonly found among the most exquisite and sweetest flowers, whose grace and beauty they pollute and corrupt; so Enuy which is a venemous and maligne Passion, doth commonly assaile the most vertuous men, and such as haue attained to the greatest honor & glory in the world. Wherefore one of the most famous

Captaines of antiquity, being yet in the flower of his age, was wont to say, that he knew hee had done nothing that was generous or commendable, for that he did not find any man that did Enuy him: which shewes that there can bee nothing imagined in this world more vniust or more wicked then this infamous Passion, which seekes her owne torment, and finds her punishment in the glory and contentments of another.
               It is also the reason why men are ashamed to confesse openly that they are troubled with this Passion: And being conuicted, they labour to palliate their error, yea, they had rather accuse themselues of all other imperfections

then to iustifie this; And therefore they giue it other names, excusing themselues that it is not Enuy, but hatred, feare, or choller, which transports them: the which is a silent confession they make, that of all the infirmities of the soule, they should most dissemble it, least they expose themselues to a visible shame and disgrace. But before we blame it, we must first know it with her nature and properties.
               
                  Enuy then is a griefe, which is framed in our soules by reason of the prosperities which we see happen to our equalls or such as be like vnto vs; not that wee expect to reape any fruite by our Passion, but for that wee cannot endure the glory of another man without Griefe. It riseth first

betwixt equalls or such as are alike; that is to say, betwixt those of the same blood, of the same age, of the same profession, of the same wealth, and betwixt those that aspire to the same honors. So as we see, kinsmen Enuy their kinsmen, and are grieued at the increase of their fortunes.
               Young men also cannot suffer with griefe that they of their age should be aduanced before them. In like manner Philosophers are iealous of the glory of Philosophers; and Painters Enuy the reputation of Painters; great Commanders in the warre cannot behold but with impatiency the tryumphes of their companions; rich men in like manner crosse the rising of

such as are their equalls; and finally, they that affect the same offices do what they can to keepe backe their companions. The reason is, for that Enuy being alwaies accompanied with a certaine competition and contention, which riseth betwixt those that do passionately desire the same thing, it is necessary it should rather be among equalls▪ then where there is no equallity nor comparison: for that men being naturally desirous to excell in all things, and to exceed their companions, this desire doth alwayes breed a contention betwixt such as pretend the same thing, and from this contentiō 
                  Enuy is ingendred; and therefore the Philosophers did rightly teach, that this

                  Passion was alwayes found among equalls. And therefore they which do much exceed others in glory, being aboue their Enuy, feele not themselues to be crost.
               And wee obserue that as the Sun at noone day makes no shaddow, so eminent vertues are exempt from the iealousies of Enuy, and yet they cannot auoyd the assaults of Hatred. As for example, Cyrus and Alexander the Great in their ages, and in our time Henry the Great being raised to the height of worldly glory, by the greatnesse of their courages haue so surmounted Enuy, as in the end they found themselues without concurrence: But they could not so vanquish the Hatred of the wicked, but they were exposed

to their rage: Especially this last, the loue and delight of Princes; whō an execrable parricide depriues of his life, when as the whole world honored his Vallour. Moreouer, that which made these inuincible resolutions to tryumph ouer Enuy, was for that no man could contend any more with them of glory, whereof hauing attained the full; despaire to surmount them or to equall them, did shaddow them from the iealousie of all the world.
               And for the same reason, they which haue attained to that height of glory, seeing their vertue raised and aduanced to so high a degree, as all they that would bee their concurrents cannot attaine vnto it, they enuy no

man, but rather disdaine and contemne all the world, as incapable to mount vnto that height whereunto they haue raised themselues. As for example; there is no priuate Knight that doth enuy the power and lustre of a Kings Diadem, neither doth the King enuy his fortune. In like manner, there is no Capuchin, or simple religious man, that doth beare enuy to the Popes Authority or Crowne; or whose condition also the Pope doth malice: but if by some notable disaster a potent King or a great Bishop should decline, and bee reduced to a more base fortune and condition, in which they that were before their inferiors, might hope to become their companions

and equalls; then there were no obstacles, but Enuy might rise betwixt them, seeing that there might bee a concurrence.
               Enuy then discouers it selfe betwixt equalls, and those that are alike: the which must bee vnderstood of those which are alike, according to their degrees and power, but are vnlike in their fortunes and prosperities; considering that in this last point, hee which beares enuy is alwayes inferior in some kinde to him whom hee enuies, at the least, in those things which cause this torment.
               In the meane time there is not any thing that doth so much beget Enuy, as those things which concerne honour.

Whereby the ambitious are perpetually affected, for that they are alwayes in contention with some one for preheminence and glory. Yea, what glory soeuer men enioy, yet for that they imagine the honour they haue not, is due vnto them, and that it is as it were rauisht away by such to whom the world hath giuen it, they doe commonly beare Enuy to all those that haue any lustre or share of it. They also which haue a conceit of their wisedomes, or which think themselues to bee vertuous, are wonderfully subiect to enuy. I say, those that imagine and suppose these things; for that they which are truely vertuous, and truely wise, content themselues with their proper

vertue, and with their owne wisedome, & knowing themselues to be truely worthy of honor, affect no other glory, neither doe they feede themselues with winde and smoke: whereas such as haue but the name of wise and vertuous, hunt passionately after this vanity, and desire to bee honoured and praised of all the world; shewing a wonderfull despight against those that contemne them: and for this reason they are enflamed with Enuy against such as are aduanced to great honours. Cowardly mindes are in like manner subiect to Enuy, for that beeing faint-hearted, when as they see things of small price shine in others, they esteeme them great and worthy to bee enuyed: like

vnto little children, who seeing a piece of glasse or a pin in the hands of those of their age, afflict themselues, and striue to take it away.
               They also which haue attained to some good with wonderfull paine, are enuious to see another attaine vnto the like without any difficulty, and especially if the facility which hee hath found be preiudiciall or dishonorable vnto them. As they which haue spent many yeares to learne painting and Philosophy, enuy such as are growne perfect in a short time, especially when they are to make profession in the same City.
               Finally, they against whom we conceiue any Enuy, must not be farre distant from vs,

either in place, time, age▪ dignity, honour, or such like: So as the inhabitants of Paris and France, doe not enuy those of the great Cayre or China. In like manner, wee beare no enuy to those who had fauourable fortunes two or three thousand yeares since. Neither doe wee see that Kings enuy the fortune of Alexander or of Caesar, although they may enter into some emulation of their valour. In like sort, wee enuy not the dead, or those which are not yet come into the world. And there is no apparence that a yong man, though issued from a noble Family, should enuy graue old men, which enter into a Councell of State. In like manner, an Attorney of the

Court cannot enuy a Chancellor of France, being so farre short of his dignity. Neither doe shepheards enuy the Crownes and Scepters of Kings: nor Merchants malice Generalls of Armies, with whose charges their qualities haue so little proportion. But our Enuy is kindled against those, whose glory doth as it were dazell our eies with their continual presence, which makes vs to thinke of the basenesse of our condition, the which wee see deiected vnder theirs. But especially when as they possesse a good which wee haue enioyed, and which is no more in our power to recouer. By reason whereof, it often happens, that old men enuy the younger sort, for

that beeing in Companies, they see that their age takes from them the vse, or forbids them the enioying of those sports and exercises, wherein young men take delight. And this Enuy which they beare them, appeares in the rigors which they shew them, in their reprehensions which they make them, and in the hinderances they giue them, when as they may crosse them.
               Moreouer, the things that may bee profitable or commodious vnto vs, stir vp more Enuy then those which are onely proper to him that enuies them. Wherefore wee do more enuy our equalls for their beauty, riches, knowledge, and honours, then for their health or long life,

which are particular vnto themselues. And the reason is, for that Enuy rising from this desire to bee esteemed in the world, and from the Passion we haue to see our selues more respected then other men; the qualities which recommend them, make the deeper impression of Enuy in our soules, the more capable they are to purchase reputatiō to him that enioyes them. And there is no question but the things which may bring pleasure, profit, or honor, not only to him that enioyes thē but also to all men that shall possesse them, are euer esteemed more honorable, and more glorious then those, whose pleasure, profit, or glory, extend but to one in particular: wherefore they doe

also stirre vp more Enuy.
               
               There is another Passion which is also a bud or branch of Headinesse, as well as Enuy, and that is Emulation, which hath some affinity with it, but yet they are very different Passions. For although that Emulation bee A griefe which we haue conceiued for the prosperity of our equalls, yet it riseth not from any bad affection wee beare them, but onely from a desire wee haue to see our selues attaine vnto the like felicities. Wherefore Emulation doth not merit the blame which Enuy doth, but many times it is commendable in vs. As for example, when as wee see some vertue shine in one of our equalls, we striue in imitation of him to attaine vnto it. This Emulation
                  
is worthy of praise. So Caesar is commended, to haue propounded Alexander for a patterne, as Alexander did Achilles: And Themistocles did shewe that hee was borne to great matters, when as he said that the triumphes of Miltiades would not suffer him to sleepe: for that it was a testimony that hee was troubled with an honest Emulation of his vertue. Emulation then is found among equalls, or at the least among those which are almost alike, for that this Passion stirring vp a desire in vs, inciting vs to seeke the perfection which shines in those, whose glory hath made this impression in our soules; wee must of necessity imagine that it is in our power to attaine vnto them,

for that we neuer desire those things which are impossible.
               Wherefore wee haue no Emulation of those, who haue so great an aduantage ouer vs, as it is not in our power to come neere them. Reciprocally we haue no Enuy in regard of those that be so farre inferior vnto vs, as we see no commendable quallity in them, which wee enioy not with much eminency. Among the rest, young men are naturally inclined to Emulation, for that by reason of the heate of their youth, they are found more hardy, and being full of good hopes, they shew themselues more actiue to vndertake; for that all things how difficult so euer, seeme easie vnto them. And for

the same reason great and couragious spirits, are very capable of Emulation, by reason of the greatnesse of their minds, which makes them conceiue that there is no designe aboue their valour, and that there is nothing so difficult but they may surmount.
               Among other things which may induce vs to Emulation, those which may make a man necessary or profitable to many, hold the first rancke. As for example, learning, eloquence, riches, power, the mannaging of affaires, and such like, are greatly subiect to the force of this Passion. And therefore it is often commendable; that is to say, when shee propounds vnto her selfe no sort of externall goods, but the only treasures

of the soule and the riches of the mind, which shee sees to shine in another subiect, whose glory inflames her, and makes her aspire to the possession of the same graces. For this consideration also we haue a particular Emulation, and desire passionately to equall, or to imitate those who are respected throughout the world, whom all the world commends, and al men loue, and especially when their vertues are honored by excellent pennes: For that all these things are so many glorious testimonies of their merits.
               These bee the Personages whose vertue makes so glorious a shew, as wee desire earnestly to imitate them: As contrariwise wee contemne

and are ashamed to resemble those which are destitute of all these goodly qualities. Wherefore as man should carefully free his soule from Enuy, which doth but trouble his rest, and afflicts him more then the party against whom it conspireth; so in some sort hee should giue way to an honest Emulation, which proceeds not from any euill will hee beares to another, but from the good hee desires to himselfe, to the end that in propounding to himselfe the examples of magnificence, valour, Iustice, modesty, prudence, wisedom, and of the other vertues which shine in the liues of great Personages of his condition, he may become magnificent, valiant, Iust, moderate,

prudent, wise, and endowed with all the other qualities which make them glorious which are adorned therewith. But wee haue spoken sufficiently of the Concupiscible Passion, we must now treate of those which make their impressions, and stir vp the Irascible.
               
            
         
         
            
               Of Hardinesse or Courage. CHAP. 1.
               
                  AS in the ancient sacrifices of the Pagans they did carefully obserue the generosity of the beasts that were to bee sacrificed; so as 
                     •
                  he priest comming to passe

a naked sword before their eyes, if they were affrighted with the brightnesse thereof, they were chased from the Altar; whereas if they stood stil without amazement, they were held worthy to bee offred to the diuinity. So base and deiected minds which grow pale at any danger, were alwayes held in great contempt; whereas generous and resolute spirits, whom no kind of perill could terrifie or amaze, haue euer beene held in singular admiration. This resolution and courage proceeds from an excellent nature wherewith they are endowed, which makes them to looke vpon all the accidents of the world without any alteration, being resolued to vanquish whatsoeuer

presents it selfe to encounter their constancy: Shewing thereby, that they apprehend a disgrace more then a misfortune, and that they had more care to preserue their honors, then to prolong their liues.
               Seeing then that true Hardinesse and Courage is so commendable a thing, and that many of the most excellent men of antiquity haue preferred it before riches, the disposition of the body, beauty, and the other ornaments, whereof men do vsually glory; we must seeke out the Essence, and shew what courages she doth accompany, and in what soules shee is found.
               
                  Hardinesse then is no other thing, but a resolution of courage,

whereby promising vnto himselfe to be able to surmount the calamities which threaten him, he sees them comming without amazement, and is not terrified when they are befallen him: Or else according vnto others: Hardinesse is a Passion of the soule, which doth fortifie it, and makes it assured against the miseries which are most difficult to auoyd, and which doth encourage it to pursue those good things which are most painefull to obtaine.
               
               Whereby it followes, that Hardinesse is alwayes accompanied with a certaine hope to bee able to vanquish and disperse those fearefull things which present themselues vnto the imagination of man. This confidence may grow from the opinion wee haue,

that the euill which treatneth vs is far from vs; or from our beleefe, that if it should present it selfe, we should bee able to surmount it. As when a Citty hath a conceit that no man will attempt any thing against the peace of her Cittizens; and if they should, they were able to repell the iniury, and to endure the attempts of their enemies; this beleefe makes them hardy and assured. Secondly, it may grow, for that although wee finde our selues weake, and vnable to resist our enemies, yet wee beleeue that wee shall bee powerfully assisted by our Allies, with whose ayde wee hold our selues inuincible. As for example, although the Duke of Saiwy bee not able of himselfe

to resist the Armes of Spaine; yet being fortified with the alliance of this Crowne, hee doth not apprehend them, neither is hee affraid to incense them, knowing that the assistance of the Christian King protects him of that side.
               Thirdly, this confidence may grow, for that wee beleeue, wee haue neither receiued nor done iniury to any man, which should make vs apprehend reuenge. And againe, for that we thinke wee haue no enemies, or else that they are so feeble and weake as they cannot annoy vs. It may also grow in regard that they who haue power to hurt vs, are our friends, and liue in good correspondency with vs, and haue assisted vs

in our occurrents, as for our part we haue endeauored to bind thē vnto vs by al occasions which haue bene offered. So the Allies of great Kings feare not their power, although it be fearefull to the rest of the world.
               By this meanes wee find that there are diuerse sorts of persons which are full of Hardinesse and assurance. First, they are hardy, which imagine that all things shall succeed happily in regard of their former felicities. So Alexander vndertaking the conquest of India, apprehended nothing; by reason of the happy victories, and tryumphes which he had gotten ouer the Persians. So Caesar being ouertaken with a cruel storme and in a small barke,

feared nothing, but to confirme the resolution of his Pilot whom the storme had amazed, he wisht him not to feare, seeing hee carried Caesar and his fortunes. Secondly, they are hardy who hauing beene ingaged in great dangers, haue yet escaped; for they imagine that good Fortune which hath beene so fauorable vnto them in so many other occasions full of despaire, will not abandon them in that present danger. Finally, men are not troubled in dangers for two reasons, either for want of experience, or for the hope they haue to be speedily releeued. As for example, they that go by sea, hauing neuer seene the horror of tempests, imagine that the maisters and such as

guide the ship, are expert in their facultie, and that they will easily preserue them from shipwracke; so as they are not amazed, although the stormes and waues seeme to threaten them their death.
               Thirdly, men are full of assurance when as they see such as equall them not, or do not exceed them in power, make no demonstration of feare; conceyting that they are assured, they haue more cause to continue constant. Men not only hold them inferior vnto them whom they haue exceeded, but also such as cannot enter into comparison with them, or at the least are not more pow
                     •
                  rfull then those whom they haue vanquished,
               Againe men are full of Courage
                  
and resolution, when as they see themselues furnished with all those things which may make thē feareful to their enemies. Among the which we put store of coyne, disposition of body, greatnesse of minde, extent of Empire, support of friends, the power of Armies, and a great prouision of all that is necessary for the maintenance of a war.
               Moreouer, men hold themselues assured when they haue not offended any man, or when such as they haue offended are not able to reuenge the iniurie. And withall, men are much assured, when as they thinke that God is fauorable and assistant in their designes. Wherefore, in old time great Captaines of war were not wont to giue battaile,

before they had sacrificed vnto their gods, and had seene in the intrailes of their sacrifices some happy presage of diuine assistance. For the same occasion they consulted with Oracles, attended the answers, and were carefull to obserue the signes which were seene before the battaile: so that sometimes the flying of an Eagle hath assured Armies that were amazed.
               But without all these signes and presages, men thinke that God is fauourable, when as they thinke they fight for a good cause: As when they haue taken Armes for religion; for the seruice of their Prince; for the maintenance of his Crowne; and for their Countrey: yea,

when as they imagine, that the reuenge they pursue is iust, and that they haue beene vnworthily abused. The reason is, for that Choler which is alwayes enflamed by the iniury receiued, and not by that which wee doe vnto others, makes men hardy, perswading themselues, that God assists them that are wronged and vniustly persecuted. Lastly, they that begin a warre are commonly hardy, especially when they haue a conceit that the action will succeed, and that the euent will answer the expectation.
               As for the constitution of the body, which may contribute to the Hardinesse and resolution of man: It is certaine, that such as haue much

blood and spirits, and which abound in heate, are most commonly hardy and valiant. For they haue great mindes and full of generosity, which makes them to cō
                  temne dangers. And if in the middest of hazards some part of the blood retires inwardly, yet the better part keepes her seate, and remaines firme and constant: so as they neuer grow pale, nor tremble like to other men. But if before they fight the apprehēsiō of dāger, makes any impression in their soules, they recouer themselues suddainely, and expell the feare which would surprize them. And for the same reason, they which are full of wine, may become more hardy: not that this defect of it self doth

contribute any thing to the greatnesse of Courage, but for that wine enflames the blood, & by accident makes men valiant; and withall, they that are ouertaken with wine, haue their reason captiuated, and their iudgement troubled: so as they cannot consider duely of the greatnesse of perill, but imagine, that all dangers are inferior to their force and resistance.
               In the meane time we obserue, that many which shew a great Hardinesse and courage to cast themselues into danger, as soone as they finde themselues engaged, are often amazed; as we see in those that go valiātly to a charge, but finding resistance, they turne their backs to the enemy: where of wee can giue no

other reason, but that they are not valiant by iudgment, but by the bounty of nature. So as apprehending not the greatnesse of the danger before they enter, but imagining that they shall vanquish whatsoeuer opposeth it selfe against them; when as they finde resistance which they did not expect, they are amazed at the strangenesse of this accident, and their hearts grow cold and relent in such sort, as sometimes they flye before their enemies. But the contrary happens to those that are truely valiant; for when as they gouerne their courages by wisedome, and measure their forces, attempting nothing aboue their strength or against reason, there is no sudden accident

that may befall them, that can trouble them in any action of Armes; whereas commonly they finde lesse resistance then they expected before they entred the fight, so as their resolution is alwayes fortified and neuer decayes. And then propounding honor only before their eyes, the feare of the losse of life cannot amaze them, but their vertue surmounting all accidents, it causeth them (notwithstanding all hazzards) to persist couragiously in that which they haue gloriously begunne. Yea, commonly they shew themselues more cold in the beginning, then at the ending; for that it is not the Passion that doth animate them, but it is iudgement which doth act

in their courages. By reason whereof, in the beginning of the actiō they are more cold, & are not enflamed but with fighting. But it hath bin obserued in many valiant men, which had their hearts all couered with haire: whereof wee haue a famous example in that couragious Lacedemonian Leonidas, who with fiue hundred men kept the streight of Thermopiles against that huge Army of Xerxes, & who had the courage and resolution to passe through the midst of his armed souldiers, to wrest the Diade
                     •
                  e from his head. For when as after his death the King of Persia (amazed at so great a resolution) had caused him to bee opened, his heart was found all couered

with haire. Some, it may be, would put this among the prodigies, or rather among the scornes of Nature; but the reason is easie to bee giuen, for they that are extraordinarily valiant, haue an exceeding heat, which drawes from their heart a fume of excrements, which thickens, and is conuerted into haire; the which is a marke of their courage, and a signe of valour.
            
         
         
            
               CHAP. 1. Of Feare or Dread.
               
               
                  ALTHOVGH it seems that feare is a dead Passion & that it shold not make any great impressions in our

soules, nor cause any strange alterations in the world: yet as there bee certaine starres, which beeing in a manner continaully hidden, haue notwithstanding very maligne and pernicious influences: so although shee seeme not to bee so actiue as the rest, and remaines as it were couered & hidden, yet she doth cause strange accidents in the life of man; for that shee hath sometimes ruined powerfull Armies, brought Kingdomes and States into dangers, and ouerthrowne the fortunes of priuate persons. Wherefore wee haue seene great Commanders in warre, who troubled by some sinister and vnexpected accident, in a day of battaile, haue had recourse to vowes and prayers, and

haue promised to build temples to Feare and palenesse, to diuert the ruine that threatned them, if the amazement spread ouer the whole Army, had not beene as it were miraculously dispersed.
               Wherefore seeing that Feare doth produce such powerfull changes in the affaires of men, and withall, that this life is dayly threatned with infinite miseries, which giue vs still cause to feare; wee must see wherein shee consists, how shee is framed, and in what soules she doth reside. Feare then is no other thing, but A griefe and distresse of the soule, troubled by the imagination of some approaching Euill, wherewith man is threatned, without any apparence to be able to auoyd it easily,

although it tend to the destruction of his being, or cause him some strange calamity in the course of his life.
               
               It is first of all a griefe and a distresse; for that as pleasures fill the senses with delight and ioy, so the imagination of an infallible euill, which cannot bee auoyded, fills vs with griefe and heauinesse. But secondly the causes of this griefe, are not alwayes solid nor true, but many times they are vaine and imaginary: for that wee doe frame or rather forge to our selues the miseries, whereof the apprehension afflicts our mindes, and torments our senses.
               The which made an Ancient say, that there are more things which amaze vs, then

that presse vs: and that most commonly opinion and apprehension, doth vs more harme then the thing it selfe. Wherein doubtlesse the condition of man is lamentable, for that as if he were not inuironed by a sufficient nūber of true miseries, he forgets others which are not in nature, to encrease his miseries.
               For wee see daily that although there appeare no presages, nor any signes of a calamity that doth threaten vs, yet our minds do frame false imaginations, and vaine feares, which many times are the causes of our ruine.
               There are some things which torment vs more then they should do, others trouble vs before the time, and some afflict vs without cause

or subiect, for that we either increase our griefes and paines, or we forge them our selues, or else wee run before them and anticipate them: And whereas wee should striue against these iealousies and false opinions which cause them, wee suffer our selues to be vanquished, resembling therein certaine Soldiers who being amazed at a little dust raisd by a flocke of sheepe, turned their backes, as if the enemy had beene at their heeles.
               These vaine feares may sometimes grow from the ignorance of things which they imagine to bee of bad presage, although they bee meere effects of nature which they should obserue without trembling, as we haue many

times seene an Eclipse of the Sun or of the Moone which haue their naturall causes, trouble whole Armies and terrifie their Commanders. Thirdly, wee must obserue that to cause Feare, the euill that doth threaten vs must not bee present but to come; for that when it is present, it is no more a Feare but a meere heauinesse. And then the euill which wee doubt must bee full of horror, and threaten vs with the losse of life, or some other great preiudice: For things of small weight, are not capable to make any impression of Feare, at the least if there remaine any sparke of generosity in our hearts.
               Yea all kind of calamities how great so euer, are not able

to cause Feare, if it be not accompanied with a certaine horror which amazeth the sences. As for example, men apprehend not to become vniust, or wicked, although they be things more to bee feared then all the miseries of this life. But the nature of vice is such, as the horror of her presence is not sensible vnto vs, for that shee seemes not to destroy our being, nor to cause in vs any great alterations that should afflict vs. Moreouer, to bee terrified with any euill, it must bee as it were hanging ouer our heads, and threaten vs with a ruine at hand; for when as we imagine that it is farre from vs, how fearefull soeuer the forme be, yet we are not amazed. Euen so although that

death bee the most horrid & fearefull thing that may fall into the thought of men, yet for that euery man presumes it is not ready to seaze vpon him, we do not apprehend it as we ought, but wee suffer it to come and prepare not our selues.
               There rests now to see what things wee haue iust cause to apprehend. An Ancient makes three sorts, that is to say, pouerty, diseases, & the outrages of the mighty. The two first, that is to say, pouerty, and diseases, make the least shew; but the outrages of the mighty present themselues vnto our sences with much bruite, and terrifie our eyes and eares. For euen as an executioner is the mor
                     •
                   fearefull when he

brings forth diuerse instruments to torture & torment the patient, so as many times they which would haue endured their punishment patiently, are dismayed, seeing so many deaths at one instant before their eyes; euen so among the calamities which oppresse our spirits, those cause most terrour which march with the greatest shew, for that they represent vnto our thoughts irons, fire, chaines, prisons, gibbets, wheeles, and whatsoeuer is most horrible and fearefull in this life. But let vs heare Aristotle, who also sets three kinds of things which giue vs apprehension and feare. In the first rancke he puts those which tend infallibly to the destruction of our being. For

this reason, we do iustly feare thunder and lightning; for that the life of man is full of the examples of such as haue bene miserably burnt. We Feare in like manner great inundations, and deluges of water, which are the cau
                     •
                  es of so many ruines vpon earth. For the same reason, being in Forrests and deserts, wee apprehend the encounter of sauage beasts, which are enemies to the life of man. And for the same subiect wee apprehend to fal into the hands of those whom we thinke we haue offended.
               In the second rancke of fearefull things, he puts those which cause pinching vexations and griefes, as the losse of our kinsfolkes and friends, banishment, imprisonment,

and other punishments. In the third hee placeth those which are as it were the signes and presages of these kind of miseries. Not that these signes of themselues cause vs any preiudice, but for that they are as it were the forerunners of the danger into which wee feare to fall. The which makes kings and Princes apprehend the rising and apparition of Comets, for that they haue beene perswaded they are foretellings of the death of great men. These signes which amaze vs, may bee reduced to foure heads, which are found in the course of this life, and in the affaires of the world. For we are accustomed to Feare the wrath, and hatred of those which haue power to

bee reuenged; for that their wrath and hatred is as it were an infallible signe of our ruine; seeing that hauing power to vndo vs, there is no question, but (by a disease commune to all men,) they will be naturally inclined to reuenge.
               But secondly, wee apprehend our enemies more, when they are not stayed by some honest Feare of Iustice, or some other respect, but are ready to tread all diuine and humaine lawes vnder foote to satisfie their reuenge. For men which haue thus renounced all the feelings of vertue, wanting no power, & hauing a wicked inclination, are alwayes ready to do euill; and apprehend not to shew their valorous disposition. So

we haue great reasō to Feare such as in the liberty of crimes, find themselues aboue the lawes, and cannot bee punished by any man. As for example, Tyrants which haue seazed vpon Estates & Empires, are much to be feared; for that hauing force & power to oppresse whom they please, there is no doubt but they will speedily put it in execution; for that these sauage spirits, knowing that those whom they haue made subiect to their Empire, (hauing iust cause to hate them,) haue no other dessigne but to take from them al meanes to hurt thē, by weakning them, and terrifying them with the Feare of punishments. They are also to be feared, not only for that they haue power,

but also for that to settle their Empire, they are inclined to commit all outrages and violence.
               It is true on the other side, that the same Tyrants should apprehend the fury of the people, who do but seeke occasions to roote them out, and to abate their power. Wherefore wee see the life of these plagues of mankind, is ful of Iealousies and distrusts, which torment them day and night more cruelly, then those which they make their miserable subiects to suffer, who grone vnder the burthen of their Tyranny. For although they bee inuironed with their guards; that they haue powerful alliances; that they command great Armies; and haue strong townes

& Forts at their command, yet nothing can assure their consciences, but they are in perpetuall terrour; which makes their condition like to that of sauage beasts, which flye all the world, and all men abhorre them.
               Thirdly, we haue cause to feare resolute men, who make profession of honour, when we haue offended them: for that beeing sensible of iniuries, it is certaine their courage will carry them to reuenge.
               Lastly, wee should apprehend those which haue iust cause to feare vs, at the least, if they haue power to hurt vs. For beeing in continuall apprehension, lest wee should attempt something against their liues, they had rather

preuent vs, then suffer vs to surprize them. From hence it followes, that there are diuers persons whose enterprises we should feare, and haue a speciall care of. First, wee should feare those to whom we haue imparted some great and important secret, which beeing reuealed, may bee the cause of our ruine: for the weakenesse of mans minde is such, as it may bee, they will either be corrupted, or induced by promises to discouer vs; or the feare to bee found confederates if the matter should be reuealed, they will seeke to iustifie themselues in accusing vs, and ruine vs to saue themselues. Secondly, we should apprehend such as haue power to hu
                     •
                  t vs, for that commonly the will followes

the power, and they will easily take liberty to effect that which is in their power. Thirdly, wee should dread such as we haue offended, or that thinke wee haue wronged them, beeing likely, that they will not leaue this iniurie vnreuenged, but will endeauour to take reuenge when occasion shall be offered. Fourthly, wee should feare those which haue wronged vs, and which are subiect to feare vs: for that doubting lest wee should apprehend the iniury wee haue receiued, and hauing forces at command, it is likely they would free themselues of this feare by preuenting vs, as we haue formerly said. Fifthly, we shold distrust those which dispute or contend with vs,

for honour, or for any good thing, which wee cannot enioy ioyntly together. For to take away this obstacle in their pursuites, it is to be presumed that they wil attempt something against vs. Sixthly, wee should dread such as are fearefull to greater personages then our selues. For that if they may strike a terror into the mighty, they wil more easily doe it in them that are weake. Seuenthly, wee should bee watchfull of those, which haue already tried their forces against such as are more powerfull then our selues, and haue preuailed; or that haue vsed some surprize or treachery, to bee reuenged of such as were not equall to vs in power. For that the first may easily perswade

themselues to bee able to master vs, hauing vanquished those that did exceede vs. And the second, seeing their successe against the weaker, they will take courage in their crime, and promise themselues the like successe against them that are more powerfull; to whom they imagine they should be fearefull, by reason of that which they had formerly done. Eighthly, we should apprehend the friends of those whom wee haue offended: not such as are prompt to choler, and which speake much, for that it is easie to discouer them, & to beware of them; but those that are close, dissembling, and full of arte, for that it is a difficult thing to knowe what is in

their soules, and to discouer if they practise any thing against our liues.
               Among the things which make an impression of Dread, the most fearefull are those which surprize vs, and which wee had not fore-thought. The which happens for two reasons: the one, for that befalling vs thus vnlooked for, they take from vs the meanes to thinke of the remedies, whereof wee doe commonly make vse against the disasters that doe threaten vs: and the other, for that speaking of the accidents of this life, bee they good or bad, the more wee consider of them, the more the opinion which we had formerly conceiued, is extenuated. In regarde whereof, as there is no griefe

so violent, but time doth mollifie, so there is no apprehension so great, which is not in some sort diminished by preparing our selues for the miseries which threaten vs. Wherefore Feare increaseth when we are surprized, and haue not meanes to thinke of the remedies.
               Secondly, those things are most fearefull, when as if wee commit a fault, it is no more in our power to repaire the error, but if there bee any remedy, it depends wholly on the will of our enemies. For this reason wee haue often seene generous resolutions, and great Captaines, apprehend much to giue battaile, for that as the euents of war are doubtfull, so if he chance to lose it, there is little means

to repaire the error, but most commonly he must receiue a law from the Victor, in stead of giuing it him.
               Thirdly, among fearefull things, wee apprehend those which stirre vp compassion in our soules, and mollifie the heart with griefe, if wee see them befall other men: as shipwrackes, burnings, racks, tortures, executions, desperate diseases; the losse of goods, kinsfolkes, or friends, and al other accidents which may make men miserable. Wee must not forget that 
                     
                        •
                     eare augments in vs, when as the causes which produce it come to increase. Wherefore as it riseth from the consideration of dangers which threaten vs: so many times, they which doe exactly consider

the hazards and dangers which threaten this life, are most subiect to Feare; as wise and discreete men, such as haue had a long experience of worldly affaires: whereas fooles, drunkards, and young men apprehend nothing, but hope for all.
               Moreouer, the excesse of danger encreaseth Feare, especially when it is neere vnto vs, when it presseth vs, and when wee see no remedy nor meanes to auoyd it; as when an Army or a City is surprized, and neither Captaine, nor souldier endeauours to repulse the enemy. Yea, after that any one hath escaped a great danger, the very imagination to haue beene freed from so great a misfortune, is able to kill him; for that

the imagination hath that force, to represent vnto vs the thing, as if it were yet present, and as if wee were in the midst of the danger. As they report of a Iew, who hauing by night past a bridge, whereas no man did passe by reason of the danger; who when hee came to thinke of the perill wherein hee had beene, was so surprized with Feare and horror as he died.
               On the other side, it helpes much to dissipate Feare, to imagine there is no kinde of danger in that where-with they would terrifie vs. The which may proceede from two causes, that is to say, either from an exact knowledge of the nature of the things which wee haue carefully obserued and knowne,

and find therein no subiect of Feare; and this course is ful of discretion: Or else from meer ignorance, which makes vs to iudge of things otherwise then wee ought; imagining, that there is no danger in places or things which are full of amazement; which is a signe of want of iudgement.
               Finally, there is a kinde of people which feare nothing; that is to say, such as haue renounced all feeling of things, whereof we haue iust cause to apprehend the losse.
               As they which haue lost all honor, abandoned all shame, wasted their fortunes and their goods, and those whose liues are tedious vnto them. For what can they feare, who

haue nothing remaining to trouble them? For this reason wee must greatly apprehend desperate persons, and such as haue abandoned the loue of this life: for as an Ancient said, Hee that contemnes his owne life, is master of another mans. Yet there are diuers things which may free our soules from all Feare whatsoeuer presēts it self. For as they that are perswaded that nothing can hurt them, haue no apprehension nor Feare: yea, if the heauens should fall, they would not be amazed at their ruines: In like manner men do not feare to lose those things, which they thinke are safe from the outrages of their enemies. As wise and vertuous men doe not feare that the rage

of Tyrants can preuaile ouer their minds to blemish their constancy.
               If Tyrants threaten them with any shamefull death, they are ready to say, as a resolute spirit did once vnto a Prince who threatned to hang him: This (sayd he) would amaze the gallant Courtiers, but as for mee, it is indifference whether I ro
                        •
                     te in the Ayre, or in the Earth.
               
               Thirdly, men Feare not those whom they think haue not power to hurt them, although in effect they should apprehend them. This false perswasion hath o
                     •
                  ten ruined great Commanders in the warre, who contemning the enemies, and making shew not to Feare them, haue lost the victory, and fallen miserably

into their power. In like manner, men Feare not when as they conceiue that the occasions which should make them Feare, are taken away: As they which apprehend the persecution of a Tyrant, lose all Feare when as they see his power ouerthrowne: Whereby it appeares that men Feare, when there is apparence that they may suffer some iniury: Or when as hee that is threatned is exposed to outrages: Or when as they that threaten are powerfull: Or that time and occasion fauours him that would do an iniury.
               By all this we may gather, that there are two kinds of men which are aboue all feared. The first are such as are very happy, which haue many

friends, abundance of wealth; great Spirits, great power; and which haue not yet tryed the miseries of this life. For this great felicity, this immoderate wealth, this exceeding power, and the other aduantages of nature and Fortune, make men hardy, insolent, outragious, and to contemne all the world. Whereas on the other side, pouerty and weaknesse make men fearefull, for that the callamity which doth presse vs, being the obiect of Feare, they which neither haue meanes nor power to defend themselues, haue cause to apprehend.
               The second sort of men, are they which thinke they haue suffered the cruellist afflictions that can bee endured in

this life, and whom the custome of forepas
                     •
                  ed miseries haue made insensible of future calamities, as they that are led to execution, after that they haue bene tortured in prison.
               But the chiefe reason why these men haue abandoned all Feare, is that which Aristotle alledgeth, that To haue an apprehension of the things which afflict vs, there must bee some hope or some shew, to be freed from it by industry. And therefore Feare makes vs fly to Counsells, and to seeke out remedies: For no man consults of a businesse that is desperate. So as these men seeing no reliefe in their affaires, as they haue no more hope, so they cannot Feare. And touching that which

                  Aristotle saith, that Feare makes vs flie to Counsells; some one may make a question, whether that Feare doth contribute any thing to make men more wise, and more disperse their Feare. Whereunto the answere is easie, that Feare makes an impression in vs of greater care to seeke for Counsell to fortifie vs against the calamities that do threaten vs; but many times it doth hinder vs from reaping the fruits which we might gather without this apprehension.
               The reason of the first is, that Feare representing the danger hanging ouer our heads, and hard to be auoyded, it binds vs to seeke the meanes to diuert it, and makes vs to craue aduice of

our friends, to supply our weaknesse. The reason of the second is, for that they which are troubled with Feare, or transported with any other Passion, imagine things to be greater or lesse then they are; so as they that loue, value the things beloued much; & they that Feare, represent them more horrible. Wherefore in that regard all Passions are enemies to wise Counsells, and good resolutions.
            
            
               
               Of the Effects of Feare. CHAP. 2.
               
                  THE Effects of Feare are diuerse & strange; for to leaue the impression which it makes in the mind of man, (whereof we will speake hereafter,) she doth produce all these effects vpon his body. First, shee shrinkes vp his heart, and doth weaken it by the liuely apprehension which she doth giue it of the affliction; By reason whereof all the heate that is in his face is forced to flie vnto it to succour it: and when as that sufficeth not,

the blood of the other parts flow also vnto it: So as they that are affrighted grow pale. For prouident nature to preserue the life of man, hauing thus call'd backe the blood and spirits from all the parts to succour the heart which is the fountaine, speedily leaues the other parts wholy vnfurnisht and naked. In regard whereof the blood being that which giues colour, and makes man to haue a sanguine hew, it being fled, his complexion fades, and hee growes pale. For the same reason they that are amazed, are presently surprized with a continuall shaking, for that the heate which resides in the blood and spirits, being that which supports and fortifies the members of man;

being destitute thereof they can hardly support themselues, but tremble and shake in that manner. And whereas the hands and lippes shew greater signes of alteration then the rest, the reason is, for that those parts haue a more strict bond with the heart, and haue lesse blood then the rest; and therefore cold doth more easily make an impression vpon them.
               Finally, the members which haue a particular connexion with the heart, haue also a particular feeling of his agitation: wherein it is strange, that as trembling is an effect of the want of heate, and that Feare chaseth the heate vnto the heart, to preserue the center of life; yet they that are terrified, haue their hearts agitated,

and they beate in them, as if they were destitute of heate.
               The reason is, although that prouident nature to preserue the heart sends downe the heate from aboue, yet Feare doth not suffer it to subsist long there, but doth chase it lower; for that in them that feare, their spirits grow thicke, and become more heauy by reason of the cold which imaginatiō doth produce, that they are not able to resist the danger which doth threaten them: So as the spirits being growne thus heauy, by reason of the cold which this imagination leaues, tends downeward, and remaines not about the heart. They that are surprized with feare,
                  
feele strange alteration; and are wonderfully dry; for that the heate which nature hath drawne about the heart, burnes and filles the bowells with an exceeding heate, which makes him to desire cold and moist things, wherein thirst consists, to quench this troublesome alteration, to refresh the Creature, and to free it from this insupportable heate.
               And for that in this motion of feare, the heate descends, it made Homer to say of him that was without courage, that his heart was fallen to his heeles, after which there commonly followes many accidents which slacken and vnknit all the ioynts and ligatures of the body; but especially they that

are terrified haue their tongs tied & can hardly speak, causing them to 
                     •
                  umble in their discourses: yea their voyce is very shrill and weake, for that it is abandoned by the heate which should entertaine her force; whereas in choler it shewes it selfe more strong, for that the heate which ascends fortifies it, & makes it more powerfull. Moreouer feare makes the hayres to stand vp with horror, for that in the absence of hea
                     •
                  e, the cold congealeth, and stoppes the conduicts by which it passeth: So as the haire as it were opprest in the rootes, by the cold which diuerts their naturall nourishment, for that they cannot suffer a strange humour full of excrements which doth

rot them, they stand vpright with horror; the which sometimes workes so strange an effect by her vehemency, as they make young men grow graye in an instant: whereof wee haue a memorable example in the age of our fathers, during the reigne of the Emperour Charles the fift. For Francis Gonzague, hauing caused a young man of his house to bee committed to prison, for that he suspected hee had conspired against him; this miserable young man was so terrified with his affliction, as the same night hee was cast into prison, his haire grew all white. In the morning his Keeper seeing him thus changed, went and made report thereof to Gonzague,
                  
who being amazed at this prodigie, cōceiued that it was a testimony of his innocence; whereupon he pardoned him.
               This sudden change of the prisoners haire, proceeded without doubt, for that the vehemency of his feare caused the heate retire from his braine: As in like manner old men grow white, for want of heate, which decayes with age: Finally, they that haue little hot blood about the heart are naturally fearefull: So as those Creatures which haue great hearts to the proportion of their bodies, (as Stagges and Panthers) are more subiect to feare; for that hauing little heate, it is weakned, dispersing it selfe into a large extēt, euen as a litle fire cannot so warme a large

roome, as it would do one that is lesse. So as the blood growes cold, & is lesse able to warme the heart, which is the seate of courage.
               Whereas other creatures which haue more heat, and the heart proportionably lesse, are more hardy and couragious. For that the heat abounding in them, it is more actiue, and the subiect where it workes, dispersing not her action by extent, shee workes more powerfully: so as she enflames them to all generous enterprizes, and glorious designes.
               But let vs come to the effects which Feare breedes in the minde of man. Besides all these strange accidents which she doth produce in the body, shee causeth other disorders

in the soule, filling it with such confusion, as shee leaues him neither memory, nor iudgement, nor will, to encounter any danger that threatens his ruine. Wherefore it is not the worke of an ordinary courage, to haue a constant resolution in the middest of greatest dangers, and suddenly to finde remedies against the mischiefes that threaten him. As histories giue this commendation of Hannibal, Iugurth, Caesar, Alexander, and some few of those great spirits of former ages; whose iudgements were neuer danted with apprehension of any danger, but in the middest of combates they could speedily redresse all accidents, which happening suddenly, might amaze their

Armies, and depriue them of the victory.
               Moreouer, Feare (like a feruile and base Passion) depriues man of all courage: and whereas the apprehension of danger is a spurre to generous spirits, to fortifie them, and to make them seek powerfull meanes to auoyde the danger; it doth so deiect faint-hearted and fearefull men, as they remaine, as it were, immoueable, and vncapable of all action.
               Moreouer, it makes a man ashamed and confounded, and to contemne himselfe; he crosseth his armes, and flatters them basely and vnworthily, whom hee thinkes may ease his griefe. It fills him also with amazement, and as if it were able to conuert him

into a rocke, it reduceth him to that stupiditie, as hee forgets himselfe, and becomes, as it were, insensible of the miseries which oppresse him, althogh they vexe him worse then death.
               But you must remember that wee speake of a disordered Feare, which doth wholly trouble the imagination of man: for there is a kinde of moderate feare, which striking reason but gentlely, makes vs aduised (to the which the Stoickes giue the name of circumspection) to prouide with iudgement for that which concernes vs: for that it makes vs carefull and atentiue to looke to our affaires, and to giue order for that which is necessary to shelter vs from stormes.
            
         
         
            
               
               Of Shame. CHAP. 1.
               
                  SEEING that Shame is, as it were, a shoote or a Sience of Feare, wee must shew wherein it consists, and what effects it doth produce, to the end we may leaue nothing behinde that may concerne this subiect. Shame then is, A griefe and a confusion, which growes from the apprehension of some crosses, which may make man infamous: And vnder this kinde wee comprehend those calamities which are presēt, past, or yet to come; so as they bee

of that nature, as they may trouble and breed a confusion in the soule of man. And impudency on the other side, is a contempt of the same misery, for want of feeling. By the definition of Shame, we may gather, that men are ashamed of those things that they thinke will breed them infamy, or lay some aspersion vpon them, or their friends, or vpon such as belong vnto them. So as first of all, all vices, and all things that doe resemble or haue any shew of vice, are capable to breede Shame in our soules. As for example, it is a shamefull thing to flye from the Army in a day of battaile; for that this flight is a signe of basenesse and want of courage. In like manner it is a shamefull

thing to refuse to restore that, which hath beene left with vs in guard, and which hath beene consigned to our fidelity; for that this refusall is a proofe o
                     •
                   our iniustice & disloyalty. It is also a shamefull thing to run indifferently into all dishonest places, in the which (as Diogenes said to a young man) the farthe
                     •
                   he enters, the more his infamy encreaseth; for that it is a testimony of intemperance and dissolutenesse. And againe, it is a very shamefull thing to seeke to reape profite from all base and abiect things; like 
                     •
                  o that Romane Emperour, who said, The fauour of gaine was alwayes sweete, from whence soeuer it came: for it is a signe of a prodigious couetousnesse.

Moreouer, it is a shamefull thing to refuse to releeue them that are in misery, and implore our aide, with money or any other thing; for it is a signe of our inhumanity: yea, it is a Shame not to assist them bountifully according to their meanes. But especially when they are our kinsfolkes, our Allies, our friends, or such persons, as at another time may require the offices wee haue done them in their necessity. It is a Shame to begge for fauor or to borrow money of an inferiour, or that is poorer then our selues; and wee cannot but blush to require money of him in lone, who hath first demanded it of vs; or to require of him, who would gladly bee payd that which

we owe him.
               All these things cannot proceede but from a base minde, and voyde of integrity. Moreouer, wee blush when as wee praise any one aboue his merit, and when as we seeke to excuse in him the defects that are inexcusable, to the end that wee may obtaine some fauour, some present, or some assistance from him. And in like manner we cannot but blush, when as to insinuate our selues into the fauour of any one, wee abandon our selues to impudency, to extoll his good fortune, and the successe of his prosperity, without measure. As also wee are ashamed of the extraordinary demonstrations we do vsually make to men afflicted, to witnesse

vnto them the feeling wee haue of their griefe: as when to comfort our Friend for the death of some one that was deere vnto him, we wish (although it bee farre from our thought) that we were able to redeeme him whose losse is so bitter vnto him, with the losse of our owne blood or life▪ for all these are signes of insupportable flattery, which cause euen our friends to blush when they heare vs.
               Wee blush in like manner, when as wee refuse to endure the toyle of honorable imployments which are offered vs; and that men of greater age, more vnable, more tender, and of another quality then our selues, accept them freely: for that this refusall

is a signe of our effeminacy. Moreouer, wee blush to receiue benefites and fauours continually from the same person; and wee cannot without some Shame reproach them we haue bound vnto vs by our fauours, for that it is a signe of great basenesse.
               Finally, we are ashamed when as we attribute praises vnto our selues which are not due vnto vs; or that we brag vnseasonably, or challenge the glory of goodly actions, which other men haue ended: for that it is a note of our arrogancy and vanity. So al vices, and all the marks of vices, make an impression of shame in all those which are infected with them.
               Secondly, we are ashamed

to see our selues destitute of all honest qualities, which recommend all our equalls generally, or at the least most of them. As for example, it is a great shame not to bee adorned with valour, wisedome, knowledge, modesty, and other excellent parts; which shine commonly in those of our profession, of our age, of our blood, or of our quality. So Caesar seeing himselfe two and thirty yeers old, and hauing made no shew of the greatnesse of his courage, nor done any great exployt, hee grew ashamed, and began to weepe, beholding the Image of Alexander who seemed to reproach him. All these defects are full of Shame and infamy, especially when as they proceede

from our negligence, which shewes that we haue no cause to accuse any man but to blame our selues.
               Thirdly, men blush when as they are forced to do or suffer things which are vnworthy either of their condition, or of the nature of man. As for example if they would force a man of quality to do seruices vnworthy of his rancke, this fills him with Shame, and he cannot endure it, but with great griefe and distaste: yea we reade in Histories of generous spirits, who in the middest of their captiuity remembring that they were borne free, had rather precipitate themselues and chuse a voluntary death, then bee forced to do seruices vnworthy of their births.

And therefore Nero should die for Shame to commit that excesse which he did with the scumme of the people vpon the Altars and in the publique places of Rome: But what graue or serious thing can wee attend from that infamous monster, who hath dishonored mankinde with his impudencies? In like manner it is a matter which causeth extraordinary Shame in men of note and quality, when by the iniuries of Fortune, or by their own basenes they see themselues reduced to that extreamity as to suffer indignities and outrages which blemish their first lustre and glory: As those kings who hauing lost battailes, & seene their Estates ruined & spoyled, to crowne their miseries

were led in triumph to Rome, to serue as a spectacle to that world of people, and to be the Images and shewes of humane misery, and of the inconstancy of the world. Wherefore they branded them with infamous basenes, which did prostitute themselues to this Shame either through couetousnesse, or for want of courage. Contrariwise according to the custome of the time, when as Christian religion had not yet dispersed the vanity of Pagan errors, nor conuerted reproches into exercises of patience, they obserued great beames of generosity in a woman borne to pleasures, and bred vp in the middest of all delights: For that being in the power of her enemy,

shee chose rather to kill her selfe by the biting of Aspicks, then to bee led in shew, to serue as a fatall ornament to his tryumph.
               But generally it is a very shamefull thing in all conditions to do or to suffer things full of indignitie and reproch: yet we must set a difference betwixt those that suffer them by their owne basenesse, and such as endure them by a violent constraint. For they that suffer them by their owne basenesse, are infamous; for that they expose thēselues volūtarily to those affronts.
               But wee must againe set a difference betwixt those that suffer them by constraint: For either they resolue though timerousnesse

and by an apprension, which should not fall into a constant soule; and then it is a signe of their weaknesse: Or else for that they cannot resist, being forced by such as are become maisters of their persons; and then it is rather an effect of their misfortune then a signe of their basenes: As wee see in those that suffer some indignity by them that are more powerfull.
               But for that Shame riseth from a beleefe which wee haue to bee wounded in our reputation, the which wee measure according to the iudgement & esteeme which men make of vs; it falls out many times that we are ashamed of the disgraces we suffer in the presence of persons which we respect much, and

whose blame and censure we apprehend.
               In which ranke wee put those which haue in their power the good chances whereunto we aspire, and of whom depends the honour or contentment which wee affect with Passion. As for example, a souldier will bee much more ashamed to haue fled from the enemy in the view of his Captaine▪ then to haue committed this basenesse in his absence; and a Louer will endure an iniury done him in the presence of his best beloued, more impatiently, then all the affronts that can bee done elsewhere. For the same reason our Shame increaseth, when as wee receiue any reproach before vertuous persons, and such as are

held to be iust: As when they are wisemen or reuerent old men that accuse vs; for that wee thinke men will easily giue credit to what they say of vs. Wee are also ashamed if any infamous thing befall vs in the presence of our equalls, and of such which are as it were emulators and riualls of what wee pursue; for that contending with them of honor, it is a wonderfull griefe vnto vs to see this breach made in our reputation in their presence. And generally wee are ashamed of that which is done in the sight of men which obserue it, or which haue a malicious disposition, & which interpret all actions sinisterly.
               For wee conceiue, that if

they do not pardon innocence, they will not spare vs. Shame in like manner shewes it selfe in the presence of such which are adorned with vertues contrary to the defects which appeare in our actions, especially if they bee seuere men, who are not accustomed to pardon or excuse the errors which they see committed: As the Romans were ashamed to do any vnworthy act before Cato, both for that he was a seuere censor of the actions of the Cittizens, as also for that he pardoned no man. It troubles vs also to see our selues reproued & scorned by ordinary Iesters, and by such as make profession to shew themselues in Theaters; for that wee conceiue it is a testimony that

we are publikely defamed, or at the least wee feare that these people to the eternall infamy of our name, will teare our reputation in publique assemblies. We are also ashamed to shew our defects before those whom we thinke wee haue offended, and are not our friends: For that we know they will not faile to publish our imperfections. Finally, wee blush when as any thing vnworthy of our condition befalls vs in the view of such whose fauour & friendship wee seeke ambitiously; apprehending that this misfortune will bee an obstacle to our pursuites, and a subiect to make vs be reiected.
               As in like manner we blush to see our selues surprized in

some notable fault, by such as had vs in good esteeme, especially if they be our familiar friends, or of our owne family, which discouer the error, into which we had neuer before fallen, or had alwaies cunningly concealed it.
               There are also diuerse other subiects which make an impression of Shame; and for example, at our first speech to any one whom we know not well, we blush, for that being ignorant what account hee makes of vs, or how hee is affected to vs, wee are in suspence betwixt hope & feare, and know not how hee will entertaine our discourse. And in like manner we are surprized with Shame, when as wee are to speake before a great multitude and a concourse of

people: For that in this great diuersity of minds and humors we thinke it impossible, but there is some one who hath no great disposition to fauour vs. Moreouer, when as we are to speake before a person of eminent quality, of exquisite knowledge, or of exact iudgement, wee blush and are amazed, by reason of the great respect wee haue of him; which makes vs feare to fayle before him, and this feare fills vs with Shame, and makes vs blush. Wee are also not only ashamed of our defects, but euen of all the signes and tokens of our vices and bad inclinations: As wee blush not only at vncleannesse, but also at all the signes of wantonnesse; especially we are ashamed at licentious

words, which offend chaste eares. Wherefore Alceus hauing opened his mouth to speake to Sapho, & then staying himselfe, and pretending for his excuse, that Shame had hindred his speech, she answered; If you had not had some bad desire, but had meant to speake that which was honest and not licentious, Shame had not appeared in your eyes, neither had it tyed your tongue, but you would haue deliuered your thoughts freely.
               
               By all that we haue sayd, it followeth, that men are not ashamed to do or say any thing whatsoeuer before such as they do not esteeme, but contemne: Whereby it followes, that they neither respect nor feare the eyes of

children nor beasts. But those before whom wee are most ashamed to shew our selues in our misfortune▪ are our enemies, to whom wee know our miseries are a sweete and pleasing spectacle: As Caesar seeing himselfe a prisoner in the hands of Pirats, said, That his enemy Crassus would be glad of the misfortune which had befallen him.
               To cōclude, mē are ashamed to see thēselues defamed publikely; as to be led to execution in the midst of a multitude of people, to bee witnesses of their ignominy. And yet the Poet Antiphon being condemned to dye with many others, by Denis the Tyrant, when as hee saw his companions going to execution,

& passing before a great multitude to hide their faces, as being ashamed; beeing come out of the City, he said vnto them, What my friends, dee you feare that some one of these Gallants will see you againe to morrow, and reproach you with your misfortune? But doubtlesse euery man hath not this resolution, nor so great a courage in the last indignities of life.
            
            
               CHAP. 2. Of the Effects of Shame.
               
               
                  AS there are certayne Plants whose roots are venemous and mortall to such as vse them, but their leaues

are indued with excellent qualities, and proper for the preseruation of the health of man: So there are Passions of the soule, which on the one side serue man as a spurre to vertue, and on the other side precipitate him to vice. And this is particularly incident to Shame, the which doth sometime induce men to decline from wickednesse, and sometime shee diuerts them from commendable & vertuous actions, by the apprehension of an imaginary dishonour.
               
                  Timoleon conceiuing that all the world did hate him, for that he had consented to the death of his brother, who was a plague to his common Wealth, wandred vp and down the fields twenty years

together, and could not resolue to embrace the defence of his Citizens generously. Others beeing ashamed to abandon their Countrey in publike calamities, haue carried themselues couragiously to vndertake things, for the which they knew, they shold bee vnworthily recompenced by the ingratitude of their Citizens.
               But before wee come to the effects which Shame produceth in the soule, let vs see what impressions shee makes in the body: for it seemes shee stirres vp an effect farre different from the cause from whence it proceedes. Shame, say the Philosophers, Is a kinde of feare, which ariseth, for that man doubts some blame and some censure of his actions.
                  
As Feare then retires the blood, and makes it descend about the heart, how comes it that Shame should cause the blood to ascend vnto the countenance, and make the face to blush? Whereunto they answer, that men may be threatned with two kinds of miseries, whereof the one is not onely contrary to the inclination of their senses, but also tends to the destruction of their nature and being, as extreame dangers and perills of death. Others are onely contrary to the desires of the senses, but doe not threaten man with death or the decay of his being: As for example, the blame and dishonour which wee apprehend for something we haue done. When man then propounds

vnto himselfe the forme of these first kindes of obiects, that is to say, of those calamities which tend to the dissolution of his being: Nature beeing amazed by the impressiō which she receiues from the senses, striues to succour them, and drawes the blood and heate vnto the heart, which is (as wee haue said) the fountaine of life; whereupon the countenance being destitute of blood, man growes pale in these great terrors. But when as he apprehends onely the calamities of the second kinde, that is to say, those which tend not to the destruction of his beeing, but onely to the decrease of his glory; Nature is not so powerfully mooued by the senses, for that the ruine

of her consistence is not directly in question; but leaues the griefe in the senses, whose amazement doth not send the heat and blood into the body, but causeth it to mount into the face, which becomes all red and sanguine.
               Some beleeue that this blushing is as it were a veile, which Nature extends before her to couer her shame; as wee see commonly, they that are ashamed carry their hands before their faces and eyes, for that those parts are most afflicted with shame, in regard they are the most noble. And the impression is particularly made in the eies, which the Ancients haue called the seate of modesty: and therefore Plato brings in

                  Socrates couering his eyes, when as hee would make a discourse of Loue, wherein hee thought there was some shame for a man, making profession of deepe wisedom. The reason therof is, for that wee are ashamed to see our defects knowne to men, whō we greatly respect and reuerence.
               The Ancients did alwaies hold it for a good signe and presage in young men, to see them blush easily; wherefore they called this blushing The colour, or vermillion of Vertue. Yea, that great Romane Censor said, that hee loued them better that blusht, then such as grew pale, for that to be pale, is a signe they feared some danger: So as they that grow pale, seeme to haue an

apprehension to be called in question for some crime, and punished: whereas they that blush, shew they are ashamed, and apprehend euen the very suspition of doing ill.
               But there is no kinde of people in whom an honest bashfulnesse is more commendable; yea, vpon the lightest occasions, then in Virgins, and Women: for to blush for words, for motions, and for the least licencious actions, is a signe of an exact modesty, which is the rarest and the most rich ornament of their sexe.
               But to returne to young men, as it is a good signe to see them blush, for that being naturally inclined to follow their passions (by reason of this great heate of blood

which abounds in them, and enflames them) it is a commendable thing to see that Shame is, as it were, a bridle to retire them from vice. But this kinde of shame is not much commendable in men of ripe age, who haue not this spurre to incite them to euill; and moreouer, vertue should haue taken deep root in their hearts, whereby all their actions should be commendable and full of glory, so as they haue no subiect to blush. But if they fall into this defect, it is a signe that they iudge themselues, and that their vertue is not perfect nor compleat proportionable to their age.
               Let vs now come to the effects which Shame produceth in the soule: there are

some good, as we haue sayde in the beginning, but she also produceth badde. Many times shee hath made them valiant, who were faint-hearted and feareful; yea, we haue seene whole Armies beeing amazed and terrified, haue resumed courage by the presence of Caesars, Alexanders, Scipioes, & other great Commanders, who haue brought backe their souldiers in battailes; for that the great esteeme they had of such excellent Captains, made them blush to flye before them; yea, to chuse a most certaine death, rather then to be held cowards by such wotthy men.
               Moreouer, there haue beene souldiers, who hauing faintly maintained an encounter,

the next day to wipe away this shame, haue performed wonders, whereof the Greeke and Romane histories, furnish vs with many examples. Besides, Shame doth retire vs often from dishonest things, as appeared in him who confessed freely that he plaid not at dice, for that he was ashamed any one should see him lose his time in so bad an exercise.
               But on the other side, Shame diuerts vs many times from commendable things; yea, and from those which are profitable, and which concerne the preseruation of our liues. As for example, you see at banquets, some being prest to drink extraordinarily, are ashamed to refuse them which inuite them; and

ouer-ruled by their vniust entreaties, fall into surfeits which ruine their health.
               Others in like manner seeing thēselues importuned or coniured in bad companies, not to bee so modest before their friends, suffer themselues to be carried away, to commit great disorders, as with women, or at play, or to do other execrable villanies, for the which they are grieued in their soules, but they haue not the courage to refuse such as presse them: whereby it happens often, that flying the smoake they runne headlong into the flame, that is to say, for that they are not able to resist an imaginary Shame, they fall into an eternall reproach, being blamed by all vertuous

men, when they heare of their basenesse.
               There haue bene some also who fearing that there haue bene plots laid to kill them, or to poyson them, yet surmounted by Shame, haue abandoned themselues to the danger.
               So Dyon being aduertized of the conspiracy which was practized against him, and his host and friend Calippus; being ashamed to refuse to go whither they were both inuited, which was the place where the murther was intended, he went rashly to his death.
               So Antipater the sonne of Cassander, lost himselfe for that he durst not refuse to suppe with Demetrius, where he was slaine. Young Hercules,
                  
the sonne of Alexander the Great, was surprized by Polipherchon and Cassander, being ashamed to refuse their requests to suppe with them, who tended only to haue a meanes to murther him. By all that we haue sayd, we may gather that Shame is sometimes profitable, and sometimes pernicious; but it is alwayes commendable, when it serues vs as a bridle to retire vs from vice.
            
         
         
            
               Of Hope and Despaire. CHAP. 1.
               
                  HEe which sayd that Hope was a dreame which presents it selfe to them that wake,
                  
hath excellently described the nature and effects of this Passion. For as dreames in the night fill vs with illusions and vaine formes, which abuse vs, and which make vs imagine that wee are rich in our extreamest pouerty, that we are happy in our greatest misery, that wee enioy Scepters and Crownes, in the midst of bonds and irons, that wee command great Empires when we are restraided in a hard and slauish captiuity; in like manner, Hope, abusing our imagination, fills our soules with vaine contentments, and represents vnto vs that all things are subiect to our power, that the whole world should receiue a law from vs; and if that there appeare any obstacle

to hinder our dessignes and desires, that we are able to surmount them. Yea in the middest of our greatest disgraces, wee flatter our selues with this conceit, that humane calamities and miseries haue their bounds, and that they are weary to be alwayes about one man; as the winds and stormes in the end breake, and are pacified after the most violent gustes. Wee represent vnto our selues the constitution of heauen and earth; wee call to mind that the Starres which are in the West returne suddenly to the East, that the day followes the night, that a calme season succedes a storme, and that faire weather followes thunder and raine: Finally, we beleeue that wee must assure

our selues to see a change in the course of this life, and that the day which wee attend will make our condition better, and conuert our misfortunes into incomparable felicities: So as I doubt not but euen among those wretched slaues whom miseries consume in the Turkes gallies, there are some which dreame and thinke of the Scepter of the Empire of Asia.
               
               Wherefore an Ancient sayd, that there was nothing so common in the life of men as Hope, which remaines euen to them that are depriued of all other good and content: For that the miserable after an absolute shipwracke, entertaine Hope, as the last anchor of their ruined fortune.

But to leaue the illusion and deceipts which wee frame in our selues; who knowes not that when they are well ordered, they serue to mollifie the paines, and to incounter all the crosses and accidents of this life? What had become of the Romans after the battaile of Cannas, wherein they lost the flower and chiefe of their men of war, if a better Hope had not reuiued their courages, to reuenge the losse and disgrace which they had receiued? Had not their common-weath without it, bene a prey to Hanniball, and the Carthaginians? Had not their Estate beene ouerthrowne, and their rich prouinces made desolate? But these great personages representing vnto themselues

that many suffer shipwracke in the Port; and contrariwise others, saue themselues among rockes; fortified them selues with Hope, which made them not only repaire this losse, but also to giue a law vnto the victors. How many other Estates, Empires, and Kingdomes, through Hope haue maintained themselues against the iniuries of Fortune?
               During the reigne of Charles the sixt, in that great deluge of English, which ouerflowed in a manner all France; in those domesticke treacheries, in that generall reuolt of all the Orders of the Realme, what had become of the fortune of France, if those great ornaments of our History, those worthy men,

which liued at that time, by an infamous basenesse had abandoned the ship in the middest of a storme, and had lost all Hope to preserue the King, and his Crowne? Was not their hope seconded by a thousand miracles which God wrought to preuent the shipwracke of the State? And in our dayes, amidst the powerfull conspiracies of Spaine, and the violent factions of the League, into what misery had this goodly Crowne falne, if great Henry, the miracle of our age, full of good Hope, which neuer abandons great resolutions, had not supported it, and by his va

                     •
                  r ouerthrowne all the obstacles, which his enemies had set before his throne to hinder his rising? But if Hope
                  
hath great power to maintaine publique fortunes, it hath no lesse to assure those of priuate mē. So as we may say, that most men liue by Hope, & entertaine thēselues with the future, this Passion neuer abandoning any man vntil he goes to the graue. Wherfore if we shold search out the nature of any Passiō
                   exactly, it is of this in particular, which hath such power ouer the other affections of our soules. We must then gather the definitions dispersed here and there in the writings of Philosophers. Hope, said an ancient, is an expectation of good: Hope, sayd another, is a cert
                        •••
                     e cōfidence which we haue, that what we imagine shal befal vs. And a third writes, that Hope is a motion and passion of the soule,

by the which, vpon the impression which wee haue of a future good, which presents it selfe to our imagination as difficult to obtaine, we endeauour to pursue it, conceiuing that we are able to attain vnto it, and in the end to get the possession. From this last Definition, which doth explicate the true nature of Hope, wee gather that there are foure conditions required in the obiect. First, it must haue bounty, for that Hope tends alwayes to that which is good. Wherein it differs from feare, which hath for obiect the euill wherewith man is threatned. Secondly, this good which wee hope for must bee to come, for that the presence and enioying of this takes away the Hope. So Alexander going

into India hoped to conquer it, but hauing finished his conquest, this Hope vanished, and was conuerted into the enioying and possession of that which hee had hoped for. So in this life we hope for the glory of heauen, but when we shall enioy it▪ this hope shall bee quencht and extinguished. And therein Hope differs from Ioy, which is a contentment of a good which we possesse.
               Thirdly, there must bee a paine and difficulty to attain vnto the good whereof wee haue conceiued an Hope, for no man hopes for that which is in his power. And therefore the Philosophers obserue, that Hope is alwayes mixt with some feare, by reason of the obstacles which

present themselues, and may hinder mans enioying of the good hee hopes for; wherein she differs from Desire, which extends generally to all kinde of good, without any apprehension of difficulty: And therefore Desire belongs to the Concupiscible appetite, whereas Hope is subiect to the Irascible.
               
               Fourthly, amidst the difficulties which man doth apprehend in getting the good which he hopes for; yet notwithstanding hee must imagine, that it is in his power to preuent all the obstacles which might hinder his enioying; for no man did euer hope for things which hee holds impossible. So Caesar would neuer haue hoped to finish the conquest of Gaule,
                  
if he had not first perswaded himselfe that the industry of a generous Captaine, might bring that enterprize to a good end, although it were difficult and dangerous. Whereby wee may gather, that although Hope hath her seat in the Irascible appetite, which hath the good for her obiect: yet as it is the property of powers indued with knowledge, to excite those which are capable to desire, representing their obiects vnto them; her motions depend of the imagination which man frames in himselfe of a good which he beleeues confidently to obtaine, notwithstanding that he apprehends great crosses in the pursuit. For man, who is a credulous creature, and alwayes

flatters himselfe in his hopes, doth also assure himselfe to compasse that which he thinkes is not aboue his forces, although hee bee not ignorant that hee shall finde some resistance. So as this beleefe begets in the Irascible part a certain confidence, which makes him vndertake that which he desireth, assuring himselfe to surmount all obstacles which may crosse him and hinder his enioying. And it is certaine, that euen bruite beasts haue motions of hope and despaire as well as men. For the interior passions of creatures discouer themselues, and are knowne by their exterior motions, wherewith they are agitated; whereof we haue daily experience, in the Sparrow-hauk,

Tassel, Sacre, Lanner, and other Hawkes, who seeing their game farre from them, and not in their power to ouertake it, they neuer bate after it, nor offer to pursue it; whereas if they see it in a reasonable distance, they presently take their flight to seaze vpon it. And in like manner the Lyon going to hunt after his prey, to satisfie his hunger, runnes not after those beasts which hee thinkes can easily flye from his fury, but sets vpon those which hee imagines cannot escape him.
               But wee must vnderstand, that to frame the Hope of aany thing in our soules, it is not necessary that wee know euidently that it shall happen, and that it is in our

power to attaine vnto it, but it sufficeth that wee haue some opinion and coniecture grounded vpon the apparēce, which makes vs beleeue that there is meanes to obtaine it: for that when wee perswade our selues vpon any reason whatsoeuer, as imagining that others haue attained vnto it, that it hath at other times succeeded, and that the same euents attend vs; that time assists vs, that the place is fauourable vnto vs, that we haue friends, or that wee are able enough of our selues to compasse our designes; we fill our selues with Hope, and doubt not but all will succeede happily. So as there is no reason how light soeuer, but it is sufficient to make vs hope for that

which we propound vnto our selues; wherein it seemes, that amidst the miseries of this life, and all publicke and priuate calamities, which otherwise would be intollerable, the wise prouidence of God hath prouided vs this remedy, to fortifie our constancy and to keepe vs from shrinking, and falling vnder the burthen of aduersities. The which the Poets would represent vnto vs, vnder the fable of Pandora, in whose boxe (beeing emptied of all good things) there remained nothing but onely Hope vpon the brimme of the vessell.
               And therefore a Rhodian being cast into an obscure and cruell prison, among serpents and venemous beasts,

and coniured by some of his friends, to make an end of so many miseries by a voluntary death, he answered wisely, that man hopes still whilst he breathes: as if he would say, that death onely could depriue man of the hopes of life, and a better fortune.
               The persons which fill themselues with Hopes, are first of all those which haue had a long experience and a perfect knowledge of the affaires of the world. As for example, such as haue beene in many incounters, and haue gotten great victories, promise still vnto themselues a power to vanquish, yea, when they haue beene beaten. And therefore that Romane Consull which escaped from the battaile of Cannas, where his

companion had beene slaine, and the whole Romane Army defeated, was commended for that he hoped well of the Common-weale.
               And heere wee must remember what wee haue formerly said, that the obiect of Hope is a difficult good, but yet possible to attaine, for thereby followes, that one thing may contribute, and serue to entertaine our Hope after two manners; that is to say, either in making the thing truely possible, and put the effects into our power: Or at the least, in making vs beleeue that it is not impossible, and that we may attaine vnto it by meanes, which are not aboue our forces. In the first sort, whatsoeuer makes vs more powerfull increaseth

our Hopes. And in this kinde wee put riches, Armes, Courage, Crownes, Empires, yea, and a long experience of things: for so we see that men powerfull in wealth assure themselues to compasse any thing.
               As Philip of Macedon said, that hee could force any place whereas money might enter. And great Kings measuring enterprizes, rather by their power and courage, then the obstacles which present themselues, haue an imagination to accomplish them happily.
               And in like manner experience, by meanes whereof man hath gotten the knowledge of meanes fit to procure things to succeed easily, makes him cōceiue a certain

                  Hope, to haue good successe of that which hee proiects. Wherefore an Ancient said, that no man apprehends to vndertake that which hee hath learned well and can do accordingly,
               In the second sort, whatsoeuer makes vs esteeme things easie, or which diminish the difficulties, may also serue to fortifie our hopes. And of this sort an exquisite knowlege, or a powerfull remonstrance may contribute much. And therefore in great battailes, Generalls haue beene accustomed to represent vnto their souldiers their valours tryed in many occasions, the little courage of their enemies; and whatsoeuer may assure them of the victory.
               
                  In this manner their experience may preuaile much: for by the experience which a man hath of things, he perswades himselfe that what others hold impossible, may notwithstanding succeede happily. It is true also that experiēce may weaken Hope, according to the resolution or want of courage where it resides. Wherefore Aristotle said, that old men haue weak or bad hopes, for that the long experience they haue of things, the changes they haue seene, the deceits which they haue tried, the fraudes wherewith they haue beene circumuented, the practises wherewith they haue beene abused, and the little integrity and sincerity they haue found in the actions of men;

fills them with iealousie and distrust. Adding moreouer, that they liue rather by memory then Hope; for that they haue a small share in future things, which is the ground of Hope, and that they haue a great Idea of what is past, which serues to entertaine the memory.
               But contrariwise young men are full of Hopes, for three reasons grounded vpon three conditions, required in the obiect of this Passion, which we haue sayd should bee a good not yet present; difficult, but yet possible to obtaine; for young men haue little knowledge of what is past, and haue a great part in the future, by reason of their age: In regard whereof memory being of things past,

and Hope of things to come, they do not much build vppon their memory, but feed themselues with hopes, which are many times vaine. And moreouer young men haue much heate, and aboundance of spirit, which puffes vp their hearts, and makes them aspire to great matters, little esteeming any difficulties which present themselues.
               Thirdly, as they that haue receiued no repulse in their enterprizes, nor found any obstacles in their dessignes, they perswade themselues easily that they shal attaine vnto their desires, young men hauing no experience of the crosses, and hinderance which are found in affaires, imagine that all will succeed happily, and therefore they

are still full of Hope.
               
               They also which are surprized with wine conceiue great hopes, both by reason of the heate and aboundance of spirits, caused by the excesse of wine, as also for that their spirits being drowned in wine, cannot apprehend the dangers, nor foresee the obstacles which they may find in their dessignes. For the same reason mad men, who are neither capable of counsell nor iudgement, are easily carried to Hope, for all that which they imagine; and they vndertake foolishly whatsoeuer comes into their fancies; for as Aristotle sayth, to speake of all things and leaue nothing vncensured, is a marke of folly; so to attempt all things, and to

                  Hope for all, is a signe of little iudgement.
               If against this which we haue propounded, (that young men, such as are ouertaken with wine, and madmen are commonly full of great hopes) they obiect, that neither the one nor the other haue any kind of experience whereof they may make vse, nor any firme resolution, neither yet any great power to effect their dessignes, all which are necessary conditions to frame hopes; they must remēber that although these men in effect haue none of these qualities, but are for the most part vnprouided, yet they are rich in imagination, and thinke they enioy them.
               And we haue sayd, that the

obiects of Hope, make not their impression in our soules, by the truth alone of things, but also by the vaine imaginations which wee frame in our selues. Wherefore although they bee without experience, without resolution, and without great meanes to effect what they haue propounded, yet they do promise much vnto themselues, and Hope for all.
               And although that loue be the fountaine of all the Passions of the soule, yet Hope may be the cause that we loue any one. For Hope may propound vnto it selfe two things, that is to say, the good which wee hope for, and the meanes to obtaine it. Wherefore an obiect of good presenting it selfe vnto vs, which wee are

not able to attaine vnto, but by the assistance of some other; for this reason, Hope doth also regard those that assist vs, and make the thing easie.
               Seeing then that Hope regards the obiects which wee propound vnto our selues, vndoubtedly loue is the root and cause of Hope; for that we hope not for any thing but that wherewith wee are in loue, and whereunto we haue tied our affections, desiring passionately to enioy it. But for that hope regards him which doth open to vs the meanes, and makes the thing possible; loue is a bud of hope, seeing that we loue him, for that we hope to attaine vnto our desires by his assistance. So as the first impression

which the obiect wee pursue makes in our soules, is an effect of the loue wee beare it, conceiuing it to bee a good fit for vs. But the consideration of the meanes to attaine vnto it, which comes from others, makes a second impression in vs, and induceth vs to loue him that doth procure it, representing him vnto vs as profitable vnto our dessigne, and therefore worthy to be beloued.
               Touching that which concernes the effects of hope, we will not make any particular discourse, but content our selues to say, that as the North Star is the marriners guide who looke continually vpon her light to assure their nauigation: so Hope is that which inflames vs to all the

difficult actions wee vndertake.
               And as the brightnes of this Star doth fill them with ioy that saile by sea, but when as it shines not they are dismaide, & feare hourely to perish by the violence of some storme, or to see their ship split vpon some rocke: So whilest wee haue any remander of hope, our soules are content; but if it bee quite vanished, we hold out selues miserable, and begin to neglect and forget our selues.
               The first effect of Hope is, that it breeds a singular contēt in vs, which makes our pursuites pleasing. Wherefore all the Philosophers concurre in this Maxime, that hope fortifies our resolutions, and makes them more prompt in

their actions. The which is for two reasons. The first, for that she hath for her obiect a good hard to bee obtained. But the apprehension of the difficulty, which presents it selfe in the pursuite of the good whereunto wee doe aspire, doth vsually make vs gather our forces together, to vanquish all obstacles, and to attaine vnto it, notwithstanding all the difficulties that may bee encountered: And therefore wee imploy more care and diligence, by meanes whereof wee attaine more easily to the end of our dessignes.
               Secondly, Hope breeds this pleasure and sweetnes whereof wee haue spoken, which makes vs more actiue and more ready to pursue that

which we desire; for that we behold nothing painful wherin we take deligh
                     •
                  
                  ▪ Wee must then remember here, what we haue spoken elsewhere, that Hope is a sweete imagination which we frame in our selues, of a good whereunto wee aspire. And that this imagination begetts in our soules a second contentment, for that it is accompanied with this beleefe, that wee may attaine vnto it.
               Wherefore as pleasure makes all actions delightfull vnto men, so the content we receiue from our hopes (according vnto the Philosophers) makes vs to pursue with more heate and lesse paine, that which wee haue once conceiued in our thoughts. This ioy which proceeds

from a certaine hope we haue of enioying, deriuing from the soule, disperseth it selfe into all the members of man, the which do ioyfully receiue the impressions of the mouing faculty, yeelding vpon this occasion a more prompt obedience to execute the commandements of the Irascible, the which of the one side is inflamed with desire to incounter & vanquish whatsoeuer opposeth it selfe against her, and on the other she is sweetly entertained in this resolution, by the pleasure which imaginatiō giues her, representing that shee may vanquish all these obstacles, and be victorious in this combate, and in the end obtaine the good whereunto she aspires.
               
                  But particularly, this ioy falles about the heart, which sends it backe againe and makes it ascend vnto the eies and countenance. Wherefore we reade in their faces that are full of good hope, the contentment which their imagination giues them.
               In regard of the ioy and cōtentment which hope giues vs, wee do easily deuoure all the toyles and paines which present themselues in our pursuites, especially when the good which we pursue is endued with some excellent perfection, which makes vs to esteeme it greatly, or to loue it ardently. As for example, at the seege of Troy, the Grecians were not discouraged with the tediousnesse of the time, nor with

the toyles and dangers of warre; for that they imagined the beauty of Hellen deserued their long labor to restore her to her husband, and to reuenge the reproach and infamy of Greece.
               
               So Iacob being passionately in loue with faire Rachell, hee patiently endured the rigors of her father, the toyles of his seruice, and the afflictions of his mind, for that he liued daily in hope of this in comparable beauty: And therefore Hope hath so great power in humane affaires, in which there is found some kinde of difficulty. The laborer would not expose himselfe so freely to the rigor of the aire, nor endure with such patience the iniuries of times, in tilling his land, if hee did not

promise vnto himselfe a rich haruest for the fruit of his labour: the souldier would not cast himselfe into dangers, he would not mount vp to breaches, nor thrust himselfe into the fury of combates, if the expectance of glory, or hope of booty did not animate his courage.
               The Merchant would not passe through rockes, fires, waues, and stormes, running from Sea to Sea, and from Port to Port, if hee did not promise vnto himselfe great wealth, in recompence of his voyages and trauailes. Yea, Alexander himselfe going to the warre of Asia, where hee should expose himselfe to a thousand dangers, protested that he was wholly thrust on by Hope to enioy all the glory

and treasures of the East, by subduing those Barbarians. So as hope is as it were, the soule of goodliest actions, making vs to surmount all the difficulties and obstacles, which might hinder the execution by the mollifying of our resolutions. Yea, it is certaine, that Courage hath alwayes beene held an effect of good hope: for when as man hopes to surmount those fearefull things, which seeme to threaten him, he goes couragiously to encounter them; whereas when he is surprized by feare, he faints, and abandons himselfe vnto the misfortune, his despaire rising from the difficulties which he apprehends in the good which he should hope for.
               But to haue full knowledge

of this subiect, and of the whole matter, we must in the end of this chapter shew, how despaire is contrary to hope, and seek the reason why it may sometimes make men valiant, and to winne great victories. First of all, you must remember what wee haue formerly sayd, that among the Passions of the soule, they obserue two kinds of opposition. The first is found among those that haue contrary things for obiects: and that is onely aamong the passions of the Concupiscible part: as for example, betwixt Loue and Hatred, whereof the one regards the good, and the other the euill. The second is obserued betwixt those that in truth regard the same obiect,

but with diuerse considerations, and that is found among the Irascible passions, whereof the one seekes the good, and the other flies it, by reason of the difficulty which doth inuiron it. As for example, Courage and Feare do both regard an imminent danger, which presents it selfe to the imagination; but courage lookes vppon it to encounter and vanquish it, and feare regards it to auoyd it and flye from it, if it be in her power. After this manner then despaire is contrary to hope, for that the obiect of hope which is a good difficult to obtaine, drawes vs of the one side, that is to say, so farre as wee doe imagine a power to obtaine it. But it doth reiect vs

on the other side, as when we apprehend, that wee haue no meanes to enioy it: for this apprehension daunts our resolution: or that, as Aristotle teacheth, the impossibility which wee imagine in things, makes vs to giue ouer their pursuit.
               Wherefore in this consideration, despaire is quite contrary to hope. But some one may say, How comes it that many times in warre, despaire makes men valiant, and giues them great victories, as well as Hope, for that it is not the custom of nature to produce the like effects from contrary causes? To which we answer, that when in the midst of despaire men resolue to fight valiantly, as we reade of the English in the plaines of

                  Poictiers, where they tooke one of our Kings prisoner; it happens for that they haue not lost all hope: for they that see no apparence of safety by flying, and apprehend that it cannot preserue them from falling into their enemies hands, but will purchase them eternall shame with their miserie; losing all hope of that side, they resume new courage, and resolue to sell their liues dearely, and to reuenge their deaths gloriously. Wherefore great Captaines haue alwaies held opinion, that enemies should not bee thrust into despaire beeing put to flight, but rather make them a bridge of gold, & to giue them meanes to passe riuers, lest that finding themselues staied, and

despairing of all safety, they should take more courage, and generously reuenge their first basenesse, by a cruell slaughter of their enemies.
            
         
         
            
               Of Choler. CHAP. 1.
               
                  OF all the passions of the soule, there is not any one that takes such deepe root, or extends her branches farther then Choler; wherof, neither age, condition, people, nor nation, are fully exempt. There are whole Countries which liuing vnder a sharp & rough climate, are not acquainted with pleasures:

There are others, who contenting▪ themselues with those benefits which nature presents vnto them, are not enflamed with any ambition. Some there be, to whom misery is familiar, as they fear not any accidents of fortune. But there is not any, ouer whom Choler doth not exercise her power, and shew the excesse of her rage: Yea, she enflames whole kingdomes and Empires; whereas the other passions doe onely trouble and agitate priuate persons.
               Wee haue neuer seene a whole Nation surprized with the loue of one woman. It was neuer foūd, that a whole City hath beene transported with a desire to heape vp treasure: Ambition doth

puffe vp but certaine spirits. But we see Cities, Prouinces, and whole States, enflamed with Choler, and transported by this fury, with a publicke conspiracy of great & small, young and olde, men, and children, Magistrates, and multitude: we see Commonalties, whom this fury hath incensed, runne all to Armes, to reuenge a disgrace, or a wrong, which they pretend hath beene done them. Wee haue also seene great and powerfull Armies, which haue bene the terror of the world, ruine themselues by this fury, which hath thrust them into mutiny against their Commanders. Wherefore if there be any passion which is pernicious vnto man-kind, it is this, which seemes neither

to haue bounds nor limits, nor any shew of reason. It shall bee therefore fit to know the nature, properties, and effects thereof; to the end, wee may finde out some remedy, to diuert the miseries which shee brings into the world.
               Let vs begin by the Definition, which giues a full light of the Essence of the thing, and makes vs to know perfectly.
               Choler is an ardent passion, which vpon the apparence there is to be able to reuenge our selues, incites vs to a feeling of a contempt and sensible iniury, which we beleeue hath been vniustly done, either to our selues, or to those we loue. Whereby it appeares first, that Choler is accompanied with a heate,

which is framed and ingendred in vs, for that this passion enflames the blood and spirits, which are about the heart, by meanes of the gall, which in this heat exhales it selfe, and ascends vnto the braine, where it troubles our imagination. This heate differs from that which proceedes from loue, for that the heate which is found in loue, tending to the thing beloued to vnite it selfe with it, is mixt with a certaine sweetenesse, so as the Philosophers compare it to the moderate heate of the ayre or blood.
               Wherefore we say, that sanguine complexions are most capable of loue, & that the bounty of the liuer wheras the blood is framed, induceth to loue. But the heate of

                  Choler is boyling, full of bitternesse, and accompanied with sharpenes, which tends to the destruction of the obiect which it pursues, and is properly like to the heate of a great fire, or to adust choler extraordinarily mooued, which consumes the subiect whereunto it is fixed, and therefore the Philosophers maintaine, that it proceedes from the gall.
               It appeares also by the Definition of Choler, that she hath alwayes for obiect the particular persons which haue wronged vs. Wherein she differs from hatred, which extends to a multitude of men. As for example, wee detest all murtherers, all theeues, all poysoners, and all slanderers: euen as wee abhorre

all serpents, vipers and venemous beasts. And therefore it is not sufficient to satisfie our Choler, that he that hath done vs wrong fall into some disaster, which might suffice to giue satisfaction to our hatred: But moreouer (to giue vs full contentment) hee must know that we haue procured him this crosse, and that wee are the authors of the reuenge and afflictions which he endures.
               So Vlysses hauing put out the eye of Cyclops, dissembled his name no longer, as he had done before, but would make himselfe knowne vnto him; as if he had not bene sufficiently reuenged of this monster, vnlesse hee had let him know that he was the author of his disaster. We learne

also by the same definition, that to incense vs to Choller, it is necessary, that he who is theobiect haue done vs wrōg; or to some one whō we loue, or that belongs vnto vs. As for example, wee are discontented with those that wound our reputation, which attempt against our liues; which crosse our pleasures, or vndertake any thing against our kinsfolkes or friends: But wee cannot bee angry with him which causeth a Iew to be put vnto the chaine at Constantinople, or a Moore to be whipt at Rome; for that the outrage done vnto these persons doth nothing concerne vs. But if it doe casually happen that one man is angry against another, hauing receiued no

cause of distaste from him, only by a certaine antipathy and contrariety of humors▪ the reason is, for that in this naturall antipathy, he that is angry against the other, conceiues in his imaginatiō that hee is able to do him some wrong, or at the least he hath such a distaste of him as it is troublesome vnto him to looke on him.
               So as this antipathy supplies the place of an iniury, and workes the same effect that the imagination did to haue receiued some wrong.
               Wee gather also from the same definitiō, that to excite Choler we must imagine that wee are able to execute the reuenge whereunto we aspire: And therefore wee dare not be angry, or at the least verie

lightly, against kings, and great personages that haue wronged vs; for that wee know their authority protects them from our reuenge.
               Yea there hath bene a father, whose son a great King hauing slaine in the middest of his cups with the shot of an arrow, supprest his griefe in such sort (seeing hee could not reuenge it) as forbearing to complaine of this monstous cruelty, hee commended the Princes dexterity in shooting. But we may say, that this actiō sauored more of flattery then of constancy,
               For the last obseruation we must remember that the causes which excite Choler are not alwayes true, but many

times are such as we frame in our owne imaginations; for this Passion with her other defects hath also that euill, that she is witty to finde out meanes to cloake her violence and fury. As it appeared in that Roman, who transported with this fury, supposed three crimes to put three innocents to death, vnder some colour of Iustice. By that which we haue formerly sayd, it may be gathered that Choler is alwayes accompanied with some kind of pleasure, which proceeds from the hope we haue to reuenge the wrong which hath beene done vs. For there is a content to promise vnto our selues to bee able to attaine vnto that which wee desire passionately; whereas no man

man wisheth for those things which he thinkes are aboue his power. Wherefore as he that is incensed against any one, pursues a reuenge whereunto hee thinkes hee may attaine, this hope fills his soule with ioy, and giues him a singular content; wherefore Homer makes Achilles to say, that Choler disperseth it selfe in the hearts of generous men, with a sweetnes which exceeds that of hony.
               But this great content doth not only arise from the hope wee haue to bee able to reuenge our selues; but it also proceeds from the working of our imagination, which thinking continually of the same obiect of reuenge, breeds in vs a pleasure like

vnto that which they feele that haue delightful dreams, and which take pleasure in their vaine apparitions. Yet we must remember that Choler is also full of griefe and bitternesse, for that it propounds the iniury receiued, the which shee cannot easily disgest, presupposing that it is accompanied with some notable contempt which tends to the impayring of his honor and reputation. So as the sweetnesse which is found growes from the opinion of reuenge; and the bitternesse proceeds from the conceite of the iniury which we cannot endure. Finally, as our Choler is inflamed by the contempt and bad opinion which they seeme to haue of vs; as there are diuerse

kinds of contempt, so it may grow from diuerse subiects. For many times although the contempt be not accompanied with any iniury, making only a shew that they do not hold vs in such esteeme as we thinke wee are worthy of, this simple contempt prouoketh vs to Choler, holding our selues wronged, for that wee are not honored as we thinke wee haue deserued.
               As if we should yeeld to a King all the honors of the world, and yet forbeare to giue him the title of a King, this were sufficient to enflame his Choler: At it appeared in Alexander, to whom Darius hauing written a letter full of great and large offers, but had forgot to giue

him the title of King; this generous spirit bare it so impatiently, as in the end of that which he sent for an answere, hee added for the last conclusion of all their conferences by writing, Finally, when thou writest vnto me, remember that it is not only to a King, but euen to thy King that thou writest. The which hee added for that hee had defeated Darius in battaile. In truth he that yeelds not to any one the honour that is due vnto him, makes shew to contemne him, and that he deserues not the honor which he doth enioy: For that if hee regarded him as hee ought, hee would not seeke to diminish those honors which all the world besides yeeld vnto him. And therefore we may prouoke any

one to Choler by our silence, for that it may bee a signe of our contempt. But the wrong wee receiue from those which depraue vs openly, and dishonor vs either in deed or word without any cause, is more hard to disgest. For that he which doth this outrage without any subiect, makes a visible demonstration that he doth not esteeme vs: it being most euident that when as wee hold any good regard of a man, we are careful not to offend him without cause; yea wee endeauor to insinuate our selues into his friendship.
               There is another kind of contempt which prouokes Choler more then that whereof wee haue spoken; as when any one takes a pleasure to

wrong vs and to crosse our dessignes, reaping no profit by the crosses which he giues vs, but the contentment to haue crost vs, and to haue hindred the course of our intentions. For it is an apparent signe of a wonderful contempt, seeing that he wrongs vs in a thing whereof hee reapes no profit but the discontent hee giues vs, & withall he shewes to haue an opinion that wee are not able to hurt him; otherwise he would apprehend to wrong vs vpon so weake a subiect: and that hee attends no kind of goodnesse from vs; for if hee did hope to reape any profit by our friendship, hee would seeke it and cherish it by all good offices, and not take that liberty to discontent vs.

So as hauing so many testimonies of contempt, and of the little esteeme hee makes of vs, we thinke wee haue iust cause to bee moued, and to reuenge our selues of him. But when as this contempt proceeds to outrages, and that any one without cause seekes to blemish our reputation by scandalous reports made in companies: Then our Choler hath no bounds, but is inflamed beyond measure, and makes vs burne with desire to reuenge so great an affront.
               In like manner he, who without prouocation doth vs wrong both by word and deed, and who dissembles not his bad disposition, but doth publish it in all places, makes shew that hee doth wonderfully

contemne vs. For as he is not ignorant, that so sensible an iniury deserues reuēge, seeing that he makes no difficulty to doe it, but in despight defames vs in all companies where he comes; hee shewes plainely how basely he esteemes vs, and that hee thinkes wee are either too faint-hearted to vndertake, or to weake to execute the reuenge, which so sensible an affront deserues.
               In the meane time we suppose that hee which hath wronged vs in this manner, doth it for his pleasure, hauing not giuen him any apparent subiect of discontent: for if it were to repell a former iniury which hee had receiued from vs, it were no more a contempt or an outrage,

but a reuenge which he would take of vs.
               But you must not wonder at that which we haue said, that there are some people, which take a delight to commit outrages: and the reason is, for that naturally men cannot endure that any one should exceede them in those things wherein they take delight: yea, they desire to excell those whom they thinke are competitors with them in that which they vndertake. Wherefore if they encounter any one that is able to oppose himselfe against thē, they contend with him, and vpon the first occasion doe him some affront, to the end they may shewe how much they exceede him in power. And therefore yong

men, and such as are rich and powerfull, doe most commonly fall into this excesse. For young men, and such as haue their blood hot and boyling, are wonderfully ready to commit insolencies: and as if they wanted better imployments, they busie thē
                  selues to doe harme; yea, vnto those which haue not offended them. Whereof wee haue great and notable examples in the life of Alcibiades, who scandalized the whole City of Athens, by the insolency of his actions.
               Rich men in like manner, and such as are powerfull, are full of this vaine ambition to seem great, by the outrages they doe to their inferiours, imagining that this insolency is a marke of their

greatnesse. For they presuppose that they are farre aduanced aboue those, whom they dare so visibly wrong. And therefore they take a certaine kinde of content, to do them some affront, which is also the ordinary end that they propound vnto themselues, which take a delight to wrong others.
               Finally, we must remember, that men are commonly moued to Choler, when as they see themselues contemned in any of those manners which we haue related. And if we shall seeke the cause in the Center, wee shall finde that the reason is, for that men desire passionately to see themselues honoured, and they beleeue, that such as are inferior vnto them, bee it

in nobility, power, vertue, or any other eminent quality, are bound to yeeld them all sorts of duty and respect.
               Rich men also will bee reuerenced and respected by the poorer sort, who are inferior vnto them in the goods of fortune. And hee that is indowed with singular eloquence, desires that such as haue not attained to the like perfection, should acknowledge the aduantage he hath ouer them.
               In like manner men of authority and command, will haue such as are subiect to their gouernement, honour them with their seruice. And if their inferiours faile to yeeld them the honor which they think is due vnto them, they cannot endure this iniury,

but fall into rage; which makes them to seeke all occasions to punish this contempt.
               And therefore it was truly said, That the indignation of a King is great and fearefull; for that when as a great king is incensed against any one that is not of his quality, although he temper and moderate his choler for a time, yet hee smothers it in his brest, and is neuer satisfied vntill hee hath made him feele the effects of his power, that durst presume to offend him.
               Wherefore an Ancient said, that Choler encountering with a great power, was like a thunder-bolt, which breakes in peeces whatsoeuer stands in its way. But not

onely Kings, but euery priuate person is impatient to see himselfe contemned by those which are his inferiours. And to speake truth, there is nothing but the wisedome of God, and the Law of Iesus Christ, that can pull out of our soules, this feeling of a contempt, or of an iniurie receiued vnworthily.
               For a conclusion of this chapter, we will obserue, that Philosophers make three kindes of Choler: and that as among serpents, there are Aspickes, Vipers, and Dragons, whose poyson encreaseth daily; so they hold opinion, that of these diuerse kindes of Choler, some are accompanied with more violence, and shew more fire then the rest. For there is a

kinde of Choler, whose motions are sudden and prompt and which enflame vpon the first occasions, and the first obiects which present themselues.
               
                  Aristotle calls those that are subiect to this passion, sudden, actiue, cholerick, and adust; for that this suddennesse to bee mooued, riseth from the abundance of adust choler, or from the gall. But as it is kindled suddenly, so it is quencht with little paine, like vnto the waues of the Sea, which rise and breake at the same instant There is another kind of Choler, which takes roote, and is fashioned in the soule, by a long continuance of time, during the which, man doth represent vnto himselfe the forme of

that party which hath wronged him, and preserues the memory of the iniury he hath receiued.
               
                  Aristotle tearmes these men sharpe, bitter, and secret: Such was the choler of Achilles, which the death o
                     •
                   so many braue Princes slaine at the siege of Troy, during his despight, could hardly mollifie. There is a third kinde (although it differs not much from the second) the which doth wholly transport men, torments them perpetually, and neuer giues them any rest, vntill they haue satisfied their reuenge. Aristotle calls those that are agitated-with this frenzy, violent, outragious, and insupportable. The first is found in the best dispositions, but the two other

are signes of bad inclinations. To conclude, there is not any one of them, but we should auoyde and flie from, as a poyson which kills charity, which should shine in all the motions and actions of Christians. And if we are at any time surprized, let vs bee angry, but sinne not; let Nature worke her first effect, but let vs stay her violence, and aboue all, let not the Sunne go downe vpon our wrath.
            
            
               
               Of those against whom we are angry. CHAP. 2.
               
                  HEe which said that man was a creature which is passionate for glory, seemes to haue discouered all the roots of Choler: for if we obserue the obiects which excite it, and against whom we are angry, we shall finde it generally true, that it neuer discloseth it selfe in our hearts, nor is framed in our soules, but vpon a conceit we haue, that they seeke to diminish our glory, and to blemish our reputation,

with some notable contempt, or by some great outrage which wee cannot beare: so as this passion is kindled first, by a contempt and an iniury which we imagine we haue receiued, the which maketh an impression in our soules: the griefe and discontent to haue beene wronged, makes vs to seeke meanes for reuenge, beeing thrust on by the nature of griefe, which alwayes seekes ease, and which in this occasion cannot finde it but onely in reuenge, the desire whereof makes his heart to swell, and stirres vp his courage. For it is certaine, that reuenge quencheth the heate of Choler, and we are pacified, when as wee see the wrong which we haue receiued, sufficiently

punished: For that we conceiue by this meanes that our reputation is repaired, and the contempt reuenged. But before this reuenge, the griefe of the iniury stickes fast vnto our soules and imflames, vs to seeke reparation.
               An Empresse of Constantinople hauing let slippe certaine words of contempt against Narses that generous Captaine, who had reduced Italy vnder the obedience of the Empire: and sayd in disdaine that they must send for that Eunuch and make him spinne amongst her women; this valiant man being incensed at this outrage, protested in the middest of his griefe, that hee would weaue such a webbe for the Emperour and

his Empresse, as all their power and industry should not be able to vndo: And thereupon he drew the Lombards into Italy, and dismembred those goodly prouinces from the Empire: whereby it appeares how dangerous it is to incense a great spirit. Secondly, when we are much transported with Passion, and do vehemently affect any one thing, wherein we are crost & haue some obstacle giuen vs, be it directly or indirectly, by ouert meanes, or secret practizes, our Choler is inflamed against those that are the authors of this let: And therefore sicke men are angry with such as to repaire their health, refuse them water or fruits, or some other thing which they earnestly desire:

And they that are in loue, frowne on them that flatter not their Passion, and which seeke to diuert them from the pursuite of that they loue. But aboue all, men are bitterly incensed, when as they contemne their present condition, and the estate whereunto some calamity or their owne indiscretion hath brought them.
               Hence grow the complaints and vexations of the miserable, of poore people, of the diseased, of those which apprehend some notable afafliction, and of those which see themselues exposed to the violence of the mighty, yea there haue beene men which haue died of sorrow & griefe, for that they were reprocht with an imperfection

of nature which they broght with them into the world. Moreouer we are discontented against those who wee thinke are the authors or abettors of any disastrous accident which wee expected not, holding them for our friends.
               For as any great felicity which befalls vs beyond our expectation, fills vs with extraordinary ioy; so great misfortunes which happen, not foreseene, and contrary to our expectance, afflicts vs strangely, and excites vs wonderfully to Choler. And sometimes the circumstance of places where wee are, the humors, wherein we are, the time wherein they take vs, with a thousand such like serue to prouoke vs to wrath.

As for example when wee are sad and full of sorrow, Choler doth easily become mistresse of our senses opprest with griefe: And in like manner, if they giue vs any words of cōtempt in cōpany or before such persons as we loue, we beare thē impatiently, and let slippe the reines to Choler. These are the chiefe roots of anger which breeds in our soules, and these are the powerfull obiects that may excite it.
               But moreouer there are other mouing causes which haue power to prouoke it, although they bee alwayes grounded vpō the contempt which is done vs: For men are also discontented against those that cause them to suffer some indignity, or that

scoffe at them, or at such persons whose reputations are as deere vnto them as their owne. So the Cittizens of Millan being beseeged by the Emperour Frederike, hauing spoken something against the honor of the Empresse, the Emperour bare it so impatiently, as hauing them in his power, he caused them to suffer all the indignities that might bee inflicted vpon the vanquished; yea hee ruined their Citty and sowed it with salt, to take from them all hope of rising or to see it built againe. The reason of this extraordinary Choler is, for that these opprobrious scoffes are signes of a notable contempt. Men are also moued against those which do them some sensible

outrage, the which brings no profit to the author, but dishonors him that receiues it. Wherefore Choler made a powerfull impression in the soule of the Emperour Iustinian the second, by reason of the outrage which they of Constantinople (deposing him from the Empire) caused him to suffer, in cutting off his nose; who being restored to his estate, whensoeuer there distilled any humor from his wound, hee sent for some one of them whom he thought to haue had a part in the conspiracy, and put him presently to death, or sent him into exile.
               The reason is, for that these kinds of outrages blemish the things wherein they take any kind of content, as they that

are passionatly affected to armes, canno
                     •
                   endure to heare the profession taxed without Choler: Neither had it bene the meanes to winne any great fauour with Caesar, Alexander, and Great Henry, to haue made discourses vnto them in disgrace of Martiall exercise.
               And in like manner they that loue Philosophy, cannot see it contemned without perturbation. Yet wee must obserue, that such as thinke they haue attained to the perfection of any thing, are not so apt to bee moued for words that are spoken to the disgrace of their profession, as they that haue but weake beginnings, and are but new apprentices; and which thinke they haue no

great opinion of them, or which know their owne defects: For these men are easily incensed for any thing that is spoken against the profession they imbrace: Whereas the others being assured by the knowledge they haue of their owne merits, make shew to neglect the blame is giuen thē without iudgement. But there is no contempt more insupporable then that we receiue from our friends, and from such as wee thinke are bound to contribute to our glory: for when as wee see that insteed of aduancing our honour they seeke to blemish it, we can no longer maister our despight.
               Wherefore we haue seene great personages, who finding

themselues vnworthily intreated by their commonweale, or by their Cittizens, for whose preseruations they had exposed themselues to a thousand deaths, haue borne this iniury so impatiently, as they haue giuen way to despight; and hauing no other meanes to reuenge this ingratitude, for the last monument of their wrath, haue denied their ashes vnto their Country, desiring to be buried in other places. Wherefore the Ancients held opinion, that the Choler of brethren was cruell and hard to pacifie: For that the loue of brethren being tyed by the most powerfull bonds of nature, being once broken, Choler turnes into fury, which continues euen after death.
               
                  Againe, men are mooued against those which hauing made profession to honour them, grow cold againe, and yeeld them not that respect which they had formerly done: For that they imagine this coldnesse proceeds from some kind of contempt, as if they had discouered some imperfection in them, the which they had not formerly obserued: for they discourse in themselues; if these men had not changed their opinions, and if they had not conceiued some new contempt, which withdrawes thē from vs, they would liue as they had formerly done; the which they neglecting, they attribute it to an opinion which those men haue conceiued, that insteed of honoring

them, they should bee honored by them.
               Men are also incensed against such as they hold ingrateful, and who they think haue no feeling of the benefits they haue receiued from them: For they imagine that this ingratitude is a meere contempt both of them and of their fauors, as if they had bene due vnto them, or that they were much their inferiors. They are also discontented against those which take a contrary part to that which they imbrace, which contradict their counsells; oppose their resolutions, and which are of another opiniō in all occasions which are offred: for they conceiue that this contradiction proceeds from the little esteeme the

opponent makes of their sufficiency & industry, and also from a concyit they haue to bee more capable and sufficient, which is a visible contempt.
               But men are wonderfully incensed to see themselues disdained by the baser sort, which are in no estimation, holding this contempt to be much more insupportable, then that of eminent persons, and which are in reputation. The reason is, for that as wee haue said, Choler riseth from the indignity of the contempt; but we cannot endure a contempt accōpanied with a greater indignity, or a more sensible outrage then that which comes from base persons, and which are our inferiours, who should yeeld all

honour and respect to those that exceed him in dignity and merit. Wherefore men of honor cannot endure but with much impatiency, to see themselues contemned by the scum of the people.
               Men are also discontented against their friends, if they refuse to commend them, or to oblige them by their courtesies and fauours, but especially if they doe the contrary: that is to say, if they braue them, and reiect them, seeming to bee ignorant of their necessities, or if they accommodate not themselues to their desires and passions. And in truth it is a great signe of contempt, when as any one feignes not to know that which his friend desires and

affects with passion: for that we striue to know the affaires and inclinations of those, of whom we haue any care and loue dearely.
               Men are also incensed against those which reioyce at their calamities, or haue not the true feeling they ought. For to scorne, or take delight in them, is a marke of Hatred; and not to care for them, is a signe of contempt. Men are also discontented with such as neglect them, and hold it an indifferent thing to displease them, or to doe an act that may offend them. Wherefore we doe commonly hate such as bring ill newes, conceiuing that if they had borne vs the respect they ought, they would not haue beene the

messēgers of that which they knew wold afflict vs, lest they shold giue vs occasion of discontent, but would haue left the cōmission to some other.
               In like manner they are mooued against those which take delight in scandalous speeches made to the preiudice of their reputation, or which laugh with the rest, or take pleasure to be spectators of their miseries: for that the first argues a contempt, and the second shewes an hatred. So as wee see true friends vndertake wordes of reproach deliuered in the absence of their friends, and are mooued with griefe, when as they happen to be spectators of their misfortunes. As it chanced to that poore man, who held himselfe happy to

be vpon the coast of Egypt, not farre from Alexandria, where as Pompeys slaues performed his last funerall rites, to the end hee might witnesse his griefe, and pitty for the misery of so great a Personage. But men are particularly mooued against those which contemne them before foure kindes of people: that is to say, before those with whom they contend for honour and glory. As Alexander could not endure the contempt of those which preferred Darius before him: Nor Caesar such as equalled Pompey vnto him. Or before such as they admire, or by whom they desire to be admired: As Alexander could not without griefe endure they should blemish the glory of his conquests before

the Athenians: for that hauing their vertue in singular recommendation, he desired in like manner to bee admired by them, and attended from them the most glorious ornaments of his triumphes. Or before such as they loue and honour, as children grow into choler against those that contemne them before their parents; and he that is passionate in loue with a woman, cannot endure an affront which is done him in her presence. Or else before those by whom he will be reuerenced: As fathers grow bitter against such as discouer their imperfections to their children, by whom they cannot endure to be contemned.
               Moreouer, men are discontented with those that

contemne or offend such as are deare vnto them, whom they are bound to assist, vnlesse they will be partakers of their disgrace: the which hath bene the cause of great warres to reuenge an iniury done to the wiues, daughters sisters, and mothers of Kings: Princes hold thēselues interessed to reuēge the reproch done vnto those persōs, that Nature hath tied vnto them by so powerfull bonds.
               Moreouer, they are angry with such as doe not thanke them, nor acknowledge the fauours they haue receiued from them: for when as they see themselues depriued of this iust acknowledgement, which they had propounded vnto themselues, for the fruite of their good turnes;

or at the least, which they expect from the good disposition of those they held obliged vnto them, they attribute it vnto a meere contempt. And their choler is kindled against those which haue depriued them of an honour whereof they helde not themselues vnworthy.
               They are angry also with such as dissemble things, and make a ieast of that which they haue done seriously: for this dissimulation and diuersion of their intensions, is a signe of scorne.
               Finally, men are discontented with those which doe good to all the world, yet do none to them in particular: for they are conceited, that such as haue no care to bind them vnto them, shewing an

inclination to oblige all the world, witnesse thereby, that they esteeme them not as they do other men, but haue a most base conceit of their merit.
               This consideration hath bred discōtents in the courts of great Princes; for euery one holding himselfe as worthy as his companion to attain vnto the offices of State, when as any one is aduanced without mention made of them, they conceiue that his good fortune is a blemish to their glory, & makes them to be esteemed inferiour to his merite. To cōclude, forgetfulnesse prouokes choler, for that forgetfulnesse is a signe of the little care they haue of men. And this little care is a mark of contempt, for that the

things whereof they make account, are most carefully recommended to memory.
            
            
               CHAP. 3. Of the Effects and remedies of Choler.
               
               
                  AMONG all the Passions that trouble & transport the soule of man, there is not any accompanied with so great violence, which shewes such brutishnesse, or that produce such fatall and tragicall effects, as Choler; which seemes properly to be the spring frō whence flowes

all the miseries and ruines which happen in the world. For whereas other passiōs, as Loue and Ioy, Desire and Hope, haue certain beams of sweetnesse, which makes them pleasing; Choler is full of bitternes, & hath no sweeter obiects thē punishments, blood and slaughter, which serue to glut her reuenge.
               These be her delights, these are her ioyes, these are the sweetest and most pleasing spectacles which she can behold. But if you desire to see how shee is the fountaine of all the horrors which are dispersed ouer the world, and make it desolate: reade in histories of the sacking of Townes, of Prouinces ruined and made deserts, obseruing the euersion and ouerthrow

of Empires; Diademes troden vnder foote; Princes basely betrayed, and smothered by poyson; Kings murthered; great Commanders in Warre cast into chaines; and seruing as an example of humane miserie. Consider that whole multitudes haue beene put to the sword, or made Gallyslaues; whole Natiōs rooted out; the Temples (wheras Diuinity dwels) prophaned; the Altars beaten down; and whatsoeuer was most holy and most reuerend among men, vnworthily violated, and they shall find that all these tragicall spectacles are the effects of that cruell and inhumane fury. But setting apart the horror of the effects which shee produceth generally, let vs obserue

the miseries whereof she is the cause in priuate persons that suffer themselues to bee transported with this Passion.
               First then if the saying of Physitians be true, that of all the infirmities wherewith we are afflicted, there are none worse nor more dangerous then those which disfigure the face of man, and which make it deformed and vnlike vnto himselfe; we must conclude by the same reason, that of all the Passions of man, there is not any one more pernitious, nor more dreadfull then Choler, which alters the gracefull countenance and the whole constitution of man. For as furious and mad men shew the excesse of their rage, by the

violent changes which appeare in their bodies; euen so a man transported with Choler giues great signes of the frenzie that doth afflict him: his eyes full of fire and flame which this Passion doth kindle, seeme fiery & sparckling; his face is wonderfully inflamed as by a certaine refluxe of blood which ascends from the heart: his haire stands vpright and staring with horror, his mouth cannot deliuer his words: his tongue falters, his feete and hands are in perpetuall motion. He vomits out nothing but threats, hee speakes of nothing but blood and vengeance: Finally, his constitution is so altered, and his lookes so terrible, as he seemes hideous and fearefull euen to his dearest

friends. What must the soule then be within, whose outward image is so horrible? Wherefor an Ancient sayd, that Choler was a short fury: And another maintained, that all violent Choler turned into madnesse: The which we may confirme by that which is written of Hercules, who growing furious knew not his owne wife and children, vpon whom he exercised his rage, tearing them inhumanely in peeces; euen so they ouer whom Choler hath gotten absolute power, forget all affinity and friendship, and without any respect make their owne kinsfolkes and friends feele the effects of their fury. For it is a Passion which growes bitter against all the world, which springs

aswell from loue as from hatred, and is excited aswell in sport as in the most serious actions.
               So as it imports not from what cause it proceeds, but with what spirit it incounters: As it imports not how great the fire is, but where it falles; for the most violent cannot fire marble, whereas the smallest sparkles will burne straw.
               Hereby wee gather, that this Passion domineers principally in hot and fiery constitutions; for that heate is actiue and wilfull, and giues an inclination to these kinds of violence, making vs to grow bitter easily, yea vpon the least subiect that may be. Finally, to returne to our first purpose, Choler doth not only

disfigure the body, but many times it ruines it wholy: For some being extraordinarily moued, haue broken their veines, and vomited out their soule with the blood; yea they which haue slaine themselues, owe their misfortune to Choler which hath forced them to this last fury: hauing then left such cruell signes of rage vpon the body, she assailes the mind, shee doth outrage to the soule, and smothers reason in man, and like vnto a thicke cloud, will not suffer it to enlighten him, and by this meanes fills him with disorder and confusion. So as hee begins to shut his eare to all good aduice, he will no more heare speake of that which may helpe to mollifie his

courage, which is full of bitternesse and violence; so as taking pleasure in his owne affliction, he abhorres all remedies, and flies the hand of the Physitian which might cure him: yea in this transport hee is offended at any thing, and imitates the sauage beasts, whom the most cheerefull colours thrust into fury: An innocent smile, a shaking of the head which signifies nothing, a glance of the eye without dessigne, is capable to draw him to the field.
               But how often haue wee seene this inhumaine fury dissolue euen the most sacred friendship vpon very friuolous subiects? hath shee not prouoked dearest friends to duells, and made them serue

as spectacles of infamy both to heauen and earth, for quarrells imbraced without any ground? It is then very apparant, that this Passion is not only infamous, but also most wretched, seeing that vnder an weake pretext of reuenge she doth precipitate men into most horrible villanies, & makes them tread all diuine and humaine lawes vnder feete, to satiate her in
                     •
                  olency and rage. Wherein doubtles she is more to bee blamed then all the other Passions wherewith the soule of man is afflicted: For that the other Passions haue this property, that euen at the very instant when as they are as it were in the height of their transport, giue way somewhat to reason, and yeeld in

some sort vnto her commandements, when as shee presents her self to pacifie them▪ Whereas Choler doth like vnto Marriners which are amazed or corrupted, and will giue no eare to the voice of their Pilot: Or as mutinous souldiers, which will not heare the aduice of their Leaders: Yea shee despi
                     •
                  es truth if shee opposeth against her rage; and although she come to know the innocency of the party whom shee persecutes, yet she holds obstinacy more honorable then repentance: So as nothing shalbe able to make her desist from her vniust and violent pursuites.
               And continuing this Iniustice against himselfe, shee sometimes constraines the

most couetous profusely to cast away their most pretious treasure, and to make a heape of their wealth, and then to set fire on it; and many times also shee forceth ambitious men to refuse and reiect the honours which they had passionatly affected before their despight: who doth not then see that this Passion, (more then any other) quencheth the light of reason?
               The cause is, for that of all the Passions, whether they haue the good for their obiect, or regard the euill, those cause the greatest perturbations in our soules which are the most violent; there is not any that doth exceed or equall Choler in violence, which doth inflame

the whole blood, and all the spirits which flowe about the heart, which is the most powerfull organ of Passions: by reason whereof there followes a wonderfull disorder not onely in the sensible and corporeall powers, but euen in the reason. For although she vse no corporeall organs in her proper functions, yet to produce them forth shee hath need of the powers of the sences, whose actions are crost and disquieted by the trouble which riseth in the heart and the whole body; by reason whereof Choler doth darken, yea hinder the whole light which she striues to cast forth: whereof wee haue two apparant signes, for that the members, wherein the image of the heart

doth most shine, as the tong, the eies, & the countenance, feele the most violent force of this fury.
               It is true that Aristotle sayth, that Choler doth in some sort giue eare to reason: But that must be vnderstood touching the report which she makes of the iniury receiued, wherein shee takes a singular content; but shee giues no 
                     •
                  are vnto her, but reiects her aduertizements in the measure and moderation which shee ought to hold in the reuenge. So as in truth there must bee some kind of reason to prouoke Choler; for that men which are stupid & dull are not capable of these motions; but when this Passion is fully inflamed, then she doth wholy darken reason.
               
                  And as the same Philosopher sayth, that they which are full of wine and drinke, are not mooued with any thing for that their reason being drowned in wine, they are not capable to ballance an iniury, or to obserue a contempt: But such as are not fully drunke, are moued to Choler, for that there remaines some weake beames of iudgement to discerne that which hath an apparance of iniury or outrage; but this Passiō
                   riseth in them without subiect and without any great occasion, for that their reason is captiuated by the wine which hath gotten the maistry.
               Euen so in the beginning of Choler, reason may giue some light to the Irascible
                  
power; but whē she hath gotten the absolute cōmand, and is become Mistresse of the senses, Reason is darkened, and is of no vse in a soule thus transported.
               But we must not conceiue that this mischief is absolutely incurable, but wee must rather imagine, that as Helleborum hath power to cure mad men, so there are remedies against Choler. The most powerful are those which are taken from the Law of God, who teacheth vs nothing but patience, charity, mildenesse, humanity and sufferance. But wee will rest satisfied to set downe the instructions of Philosophy, which may serue to this effect: First of all, Philosophers aduise vs to entreate this passion as they do

monsters and serpents, whom they striue to smother as soone as they are disclosed: for they will that man should haue a care to the beginning of Choler, which many times ariseth from so light an occasion, and so poore a subiect, as it is vnworthy a great spirite should bee transported therewith And as it is easie to quench a fire of straw in the beginning, but if we suffer it to take holde of more solid matter, it passeth all our labour and industry, and makes a pittifull ruine: euen so, he that will obserue Choler from the beginning, seeing it beginne to fume and kindle for some light quarrell and small offence; it is easie for him to suppresse it, and to stay her course. But if shee

be once setled and beginnes to swell, and that he himselfe blowes the bellowes; that is to say, if hee stirres it vppe and enflames it, it will bee hard for him afterwards to quench it, whereas he might easily haue done it before by silence,
               Wherefore as Pilots foreseeing a tempest, doe vsually retire themselues into a road or vnder the Lee of some rock, before the storme come; so he that feeles the first motions of Choler, should haue recourse to reason, and oppose it to the passion, to controule her violence. For the first meanes to vanquish Choler as an vniust tyrant, is not to yeelde any obedience to her, nor to beleeue her in any thing she saith or doth, to inflame

vs to reuenge, we finde in other Passions, that the liberty wee giue them, brings some ease. As when young men which are enflamed with Loue, goe in maske, make dances, combates, or feasts, in fauour of the party they loue; all this giues some ease vnto their passion: and when as they suffer those that are afflicted to weep in the midst of their afflictions, the teares they powre forth, carry with them a part of their griefe, But Choler hath nothing of al this, she growes bitter, and is incensed by the liberty wee giue her, and is enflamed the more in that we giue way to her fury. And as they that are subiect vnto the falling sickenesse, hauing any signe or beginning of their fit, retire

themselues suddainly, and take all the remedies which may diuert so troublesome an accident, or at least, hide the shame; so they which see themselues transported with Choler, should retaine themselues, and striue to moderate their passion, and diuert the infirmity which seekes to seaze vpon them. Wherevnto they should the more willingly resolue, for that all other passions doe but draw men to euill, but this doth precipitate them; those doe shake them, but this doth ouerthrow them; Those when they haue the vpper hand, suffer themselues to bee curbed, but this beeing mistresse will obey no law; like vnto the thunder-bolt, which being once falne from the cloud

wherein it was enclosed, can no more bee stayed. Other Passions stray from reason, but Choler treades it vnder feete, and leads it as it were, in triumph. Wherefore by all these considerations, men should be carefull not to fall into the hands of so furious a mistresse.
               The second remedy that may be giuen, is to represent the defects of this passion, & the miseries wherewith she is accompanied; the which are such, as it seemes they carry the Palme of vice, and to bee more detestable then all other crimes, wherewith the soule may be polluted. Auarice, in truth, is a shamefull greedinesse of getting, but yet it sometimes gathers together that, which falls into

the hands of a good man that succeedes a miser: whereas Choler scatters all. For what expences, what profusiō doth she not to attaine vnto the reuenge which shee doth meditate? How often doth shee make a man ruine his owne fortune? the husband to separate himselfe from his wife; the sonne abandons his father; the people arme against the Magistrate; and he which aspired to honour, checks himselfe, and giues ouer his pursuite.
               
                  Choler is also worse then voluptuousnesse, for that lusts make men to plunge themselues in particular plesures; whereas Choler makes them of so bad a disposition, as he is delighted in another mans miseries. It is much

more wicked then Enuy: for that if Enuy desires to see any one miserable, it is Choler which procures the misery.
               But we must not continue our great desires in the reuenges of Choler, for generous spirits are as it were, impenetrable to offences; whereas they that cannot resist, shew their weakenesse; whereby we see that women, children, sicke folkes, and olde men are most subiect to these motions and impressions.
               The highest and goodliest part of the world, and neerest to the firmament and starres, is neuer couered with clouds; and in whose bosome there is neuer any haile, rain, windes, nor other tempests congealed: there is neuer any

thunder nor lightning, although the thunder-bolts fal from thence vpon the earth. In like manner, a spirit truely eleuated, a generous soule, is alwayes quiet, moderate, and graue, neuer suffering it selfe to bee transported with the furious motions of Choler; shee represents vnto her selfe the defects of this passion, shee sees that they which abandon themselues vnto it, disrobe themselues of all shame, and lose all reason: for who is he that in the middest of his despight & wrath, seems not to haue renounc'd all moderation, and modesty? Can hee refraine his tongue, or containe the other parts of his body in their duty? But how many great personages haue we seene expose

themselues to bee a scorne of the world by the excesse of their Choler? Witnesse that famous Prince, who wrote letters to a Mountaine, and who caused a Riuer to bee whipped, which had beene an obstacle to his passage.
               Wherefore as in seeing the shamefull motions of them that are drunke, we conceiue a certaine horror of the excesse of wine: so great spirits seeing the deformity of Choler, endeauour what they can not to bee infected with a vice, which is as it were a reproach to humane Nature. But to preuent it, wee must first flye all affaires that are aboue our reach, lest that finding our selues opprest, as with an insupportable burthen, griefe kindle our waywardnesse

and Choler. We must also flye the company of quarrelsome persons, lest by a certaine contagion they poyson vs with their Passions.
               Drunkards prouoke to drinke, voluptuous men mollifie the most couragious, and auarice poysons those that haunt the couetous. In like māner, cholericke men infuse into vs their troublesome humours, or at the least in frequenting them, wee expose our selues to the dangers of quarrels with them; whereas conuersing with quiet men (besides the good example) we are freed from that danger.
               Philosophers produce other remedies to cure Choler, aduising them that haue any

inclination to this passion, to leaue al great and waighty occupations of the minde, yea, the most serious studies: and they exhort them to imitate those that are weake sighted, who ease themselues in fixing their eyes vpon the most cheerefull colors; aboue all things they coniure them to auoyde the occasions and subiects which are giuen thē, to remember that it is not expedient for man to see all nor to heare all, and that wee must let many things passe which are spoken against vs; for that many times hauing neglected them, it is a kinde of iustification. That which prouokes vs to Choler (say they) is the opinion we haue to haue beene outraged; but we must not so suddenly giue

credit to this opinion, nor presently receiue the reports which are made vnto vs, how cleere and euident soeuer the proofes of the iniury may seeme vnto vs; for there are many things which hauing a shew of truth, are notwithstanding false; so as wee must reserue one eare to heare the reasons of him that is accused, or else shut them both to the reporters, who many times take a delight to sowe discord, and to breed quarrells for their owne pleasures.
               And doubtles we may many times repent to haue run rashly to reuenge, whereas we haue cause to bee glad to haue deferred it. For the same reason wee must flie suspitions and iealousies, which many

times incense vs, as well as the iustest subiects of Choler; for that taking in ill part a looke, a smile, or some other light action, wee conceiue a despight, and runne to field against those that are innocent, and which had no desire to wrong vs.
               Finally of things that offend vs, some wee haue by report, others wee haue either seene or heard ourselues. As for those which are reported wee must not easily giue credit vnto them, considering the practizes which are vsed at this day to abuse the most credulous: A flatterer will seeke to insinuate himselfe into fauour by accusing an innocent; he wil suggest an outrage & make a bad discourse to perswade that hee hath

heard it with griefe of mind; another will seeke an occasion to dissolue the most sacred bonds of friendship: Another full of venome & poyson will desire to haue the sport of a quarrell, and will bee glad to bee spectator of a combate which he hath kindled, so as he be none of the party. It is then a notable lightnesse to condemne a friend suddenly before he be heard, and without an exact knowledge of the matter whereof he is accused; and it is a prodigious iniustice to bee incensed against him before that hee know who accuseth him, or what crime is imposed vpon him.
               As for those things whereof we our selues are witnesses, we must cōsider the disposition

& will of those that haue committed them; if it bee a young man, let vs impute it to his age and beare with his youth. Is it a father? Hauing receiued so many other benefits from him, it is reason wee should endure, and that remembrance of things past should mollifie our present bitternesse; and we must duely consider with our selues whether hee hath not iust cause to entreat vs with that rigor, whereof wee now complaine.
               If it be a woman, this sexe doth not alwayes follow the motions of reason, and her weakenesse should serue her for an excuse. If they bee persons subiect to a greater power, it may be they haue bene forced, and being solicited

by such as they could not disobey, would you then bee angry against necessity? another may offend vs after that he hath bene outraged by vs: and what wonder is it if hee requite vs with the like? If he be a Magistrate or a Iudge from whom wee pretend to haue receiued some iniustice, his sufficiency must bee of more weight then our priuate opinion, and wee should rather accuse our owne crime then suspect him of corruption. If it bee a King or Prince, that punisheth some malefactor, we must beleeue that hee doth it iustly: But if hee oppresse an innocent, we must not complaine, but giue way to the miseries of humane nature, remembring that the weaker are

subiect to the lawes of mighty.
               If it bee a bruite beast or a peece of timber or stone that hurts vs, we must beware that we become not more stupid then sencelesse things, thinking to reuenge our iniuries of them. If it be a good man, we should not thinke that he had any will to hurt vs, beeing confident of his innocency. If hee bee a wicked man, why are wee amazed if the effects resemble the cause? Moreouer if we thinke that wee are wrongfully opprest, let vs remember that many times wee thinke that vniust, which is not so in effect: This proc
                     •
                  eeds from too great a loue which wee beare vnto our selues: and in a word, it is ignorance or insolency

that thrusts vs into Choler, neuer remembring that humane nature (like vnto a field full of weeds and thornes) brings foorth spirits that are ingrate, trecherous, enuious and wicked. Hee that shall duely consider this, will not easily giue way to Choler.
               
               These are parts of the remedies which Philosophers propound against this furious Passion. There are others which were too long to relate; and to say the truth, most of them are rather remedies of Emperickes which palliate the euill, then solide medicines which cure our Passions. The soueraigne remedy is to cast our eyes vpon the examples of patience which the seruants of

God and the Saints haue taught vs in this world, and especially to fixe them vpon those which the Sonne of God hath left vs, who being outraged by men did not curse them; being persecuted, hee did not threaten his excutioners; being crucified, hee prayed for his enemies; and who in the end by a Philosophy farre different from that of the world, hath put our saluation in his crosse, our triumphs in his reproches, and our glory in his punishments.
            
         
         
            
               
               Of Mildnesse and Gentlenesse. CHAP. 1.
               
                  AS CHOLER enflaming man to reuēge, transports him in such sort as many times he seemes to be depriued of all kind of humanity; and that it hath conuerted him into a sauage and cruell beast, which breathes nothing but blood & slaughter, so there is a motion contrary to this Passion which restores man to the estate of man, and casting as it were water vpon the fire of his wrath, makes him tractable

to pardon the outrages which hee pretends to haue beene done him vnworthily. This Passion hath no proper name, but may be called Gentlenesse, Mildnesse, or clemency, according to the subiects where it encounters; and it is no other thing but a motion which reduceth the soule to a quiet estate, and makes him forget all kinds of iniuries & reuenges.
               Wherefore as men are ordinarily incensed against those that contemne them, & this contempt being an iniury which proceeds from the will of him that offends vs, it is visible that our Choler is easily pacified when as wee see there is no cause of contempt in vs; for that they of whom we might complaine,

haue done it against their inclination, and not by any affected malice: And the reason is, for that humane actions depend of the intention of him that doth them. Wherefore imagining that they haue no bad intention against vs, we hold them free from crime.
               By the same reason we do easily forget the Choler which wee haue conceiued against those, who being mistaken shew their griefe, and desire to liue otherwise; for that this desire is a testimony that their will hath beene surprized. As for example, a friend in our infirmity may giue vs a receipt which hee thinkes fit to cure our disease, but hauing taken it, our paine increaseth; yet wee are not bitterly

incensed against him, for that it appeares his will was to giue vs ease, although our paine increased. And particularly wee shew our selues easie to pardon those which doe vnto themselues what they haue done vnto vs: For that we cannot conceiue that they haue contemned vs in those things wherein themselues are ingaged; being apparent that no man contemnes himselfe. We also pardon those easily which confesse their faults freely, and shew repentance for their offences; for that wee imagine this griefe is a sufficient punishment for their wrong.
               Whereof we haue a familiar example in our seruants; reprehending more sharply,

and punishing more seuerely, those that palliate their offences, or that answer vs arrogantly; and we entreat them more graciously which acknowledge their faults and demand pardon. And the reason is, for that it is a signe of impudency to maintaine an error which is apparent, and th
                     •
                  s impudency is a notable cōtempt of him against whom they contest so boldly: for that wee contemne those with whom we shew no respect or reuerence.
               We are easily pacified, when as they whom we pretend haue offended vs, humble themselues before vs, endure our reproofe, and doe not contradict vs; for that this submission is as it were, a signe of feare or reuerence

which they beare vs, whereby they silently confesse, that they are our inferiours: so as we conceiue they doe not contemne vs: for that no man contemnes him whom he feares. Wherefore euery man layes aside all choler against those that humble themselues: we haue an example in the Lyon, a generous beast, who neuer shewes his fury, but pardons those that lye prostrate vpon the ground to saue themselues. We also shew our selues mild to those which making the same profession, honour vs, and speake not slanderously of vs: for that this respect shewes they haue vs in good esteeme, and that they contemne vs not.
               Wee also pardon those

willingly, from whom wee haue receiued some notable fauour, & particularly when they entreat vs and coniure vs with passionate prayers, to forget the iniuries they haue done vs, and not to take reuenge of them; for that these kinde of 
                     •
                  ntreaties are signes of their submission.
               Wee also pardon those willingly, which are not reputed to be insolent, slanderers, mockers, or contemners of others, but are knowne to be good men, doing outrage to no man vnlesse it be to the wicked, among whom we desire not to sort our selues. Wee checke and controule our choler, when as we know that they that haue offended vs are powerful persons, from

whom wee might feare some greater iniurie, if wee should attempt to reuenge that which they haue done vs▪ for wee seldome make demonstration of choler against those whom we feare, beeing vnpossible that at the same instant wee should feare any man, and yet bee in choler against him. Yea, wee passe ouer their faults lightly that haue wronged vs in the heate of their choler: so as if wee are incensed against them, it is with lesse feeling and bitternesse, for that we conceiue that what they haue done, was not through contempt, seeing that no man euer contemned him whom hee held worthy of his choler: for that contempt is without griefe and apprehension, but choler

is full of griefe and feeling of the iniury receiued.
               Places, times, imployments, companies, helpe many times to make vs mild and quiet, and to keepe vs from being transported with choler, if it bee not for some outragious iniury: for in sports, at banquets, and publique feasts, among our friends, in the midst of our great prosperities, during the happy successe of our affaires, and in the midst of our good hopes, we doe not easily receiue any impressions of choler, vnlesse (as we haue sayd) they do vs some notable outrage which exceedes all patience.
               In like manner, when as we suffer much time to passe before wee seeke reuenge of the iniury, by little and little

we forget it, and time hauing asswaged our heate, wee lose all desire of reuenge. But one of the things which helpes most to quench our choler, is, when as some other then that party against whom it is enflamed, hath beene seuerely punished or sent to execution, before wee could satisfie our reuenge against him.
               Wherefore Philocrates, being demanded why hee did not purge himselfe of the crimes whereof he was accused, during the time the people were in choler against him; answered, that the reason was, for that he expected some other should be vniustly accused and condemned before him; imagining (as it is true) that when as men

haue powred forth their choler and splene vpon any one, then they grow more milde, and their rage is turned to pitty. As it happened to Ergophilus, against whom although his iudges were more incensed then against Calisthenes; yet they pronounced him innocent, and freed him from punishment; for that the day before they had condemned Calisthenes.
               
               Moreouer, men shew themselues milde and tractable to those ouer whom they haue gotten some fauourable decree, and also to such as they see exposed to more cruell afflictions, then they would haue imposed vpon them for their reuenge: For they conceiue that they are punished sufficiently for their

offence, and that for their part they are fully reuenged of the iniury they haue receiued.
               But particularly our choler is not often enflamed when as we conceiue the iniury that we suffer is done vs iustly, & that wee haue well deserued that chastisement; for then it rather makes shew of a reuenge iustly pursued, then of a contempt or iniury vniustly procured. Choler hath iniustice for her obiect, bee it true or apparent: for that as we haue obserued in the Definition, it is a feeling of an indignity which wee thinke we haue receiued wrongfully, and without merite: wherefore when as we apprehend there is no iniustice in the wrong wee receiue, our

choler breakes not forth and runs not hastily to reuenge. And therefore when we will reprehend any one, it is fit to represent vnto him the subiect wherefore we vse this seuerity, that making him know wee haue iust occasion, it may stay him from choler. The which wee should practise particularly with our seruants, who will take our reprehensions in better part, and serue vs with more affection when wee shew them that they haue erred, and let them know the offēce which hath moued vs to this rigor. Our choler is not easily moued against such as wee hold insensible of any thing that we shall doe or say; for that Choler will haue her effects knowne. Wherefore no man

of iudgement will bee angry against insensible things. But the choler which we shew against the liuing, is mortified in regard of the dead, for that they haue endured the last misery of life, and they haue no more feeling nor knowledge of iniuries, which choler doth wonderfully desire. Wherefore Homer to pacifie Aclilles, who insulted ouer the dead body of Hector, let him know, that he did but beate the earth, and outrage an insensible thing. These are briefly the persons to whom Mildnesse or clemency extends, and which can command their choler.
               This Mildnesse is commendable in all men, for that it is a bud of true humility, or rather a true character of

the children of God. But it hath a greater lustre and a more eminent shew when it is found in the soules of kings and Monarchs of the earth: For what praise, what triumph, and what glory is it to a great Prince, to haue the command of so many millions of men, to bee arbitrator of their liues, to be master of their goods and fortunes, to be able in an instant to leuy fearefull Armies, and in the twinckling of an eye to ruine Townes & Countriee, without the feare of any Lawes? And yet in this prodigious power, not to suffer his eyes to be daxeled with so great a splendour, nor to bee transported with choler, and in offences not to vse seuerity; to spare blood, to containe

his Passions, and to make it his whole glory to doe good to those that are subiect to his authority.
               Wherefore this bounty and clemency in Princes, makes them not onely to bee beloued, but euen to be adored by their subiects, who are rauished with a sweete excesse of ioy, when as they see themselues subiect to a power which hath nothing insolent, but all things tend to their preseruation, and propound vnto themselues no more glorious obiects then their safety.
               Subiects hide not thēselues from these good Princes, and flye not from them, as if a Tiger, a Lyon, or some other sauage and cruel beast, did present it selfe; but they runne to

meete them, to behold them, and admire them, as starres of good influence, of whom depend all their happinesse. The subiects runne vnto their Temples for such good Princes, & poure out their vowes and prayers for their honors and safety. It is for them they watch and are in care, and it is for them they are ready to suffer a thousand deathes, rather then any attempt shold be made against their liues, whereunto they know their safeties are tyed: For their mildenesse and clemency, as a powerful charme bindes the affections of their subiects vnto them, and doth purchase their loue, which is the most powerfull bond and the safest guard wherby Monarches may assure their estates:

For there is no Empire nor gouernement, more firme then that which pleaseth the subiects; whereas those that are odious, are soone ruined: yea, they that could temper their authority by Clemency, haue alwayes enioyed a happy successe in their gouernement. And to speake in a word, clemency is as a soueraign ornament to all the other royall vertues; yea; it is to Princes as a way to heauen, and immortality to vse so eminent and fearefull a power moderately; to loue their subiects, to pardon the humble, to abstaine from all cruelty, to do no violence, not to bathe their hands in blood, to let their time passe, to pacifie their choler, and to procure peace and quietnesse

to the world. For these reasons their subiects apprehend not them, but apprehend onely for them: whereas the violence of Princes striks a terror into the minds of their subiects, but it makes them neither more powerfull, nor to be more respected by them.
               And these feares and terrors of the subiects are weake tyes and bands of their affection and loue: for when as they imagine they haue no more subiect of feare, they beginne to hate. But admit that the horror of punishments and tortures were able to settle Empires: who knows not, that as it is an incomparable shame for Phisitians to fill vp graues, putting their skill in practize: So it is a

great reproach to Princes to mainetaine their greatnesse by tortures. They should vnderstand all the defects of their estate, but wisedome binds him to excuse some: and if they be forced to vse seuerity, they must doe it in punishing crimes which deserue no pardon; yet with a testimony of griefe and remorse. And finally, they must shew their clemency to those where there is some hope of amendement, not alwayes seeking to inflict punishments, but sometimes to bee satisfied with the repentance of them that haue offended.
               They must remember that it is a glorious thing to pardon him whose offence hath already made miserable, and

that it is a seuere punishmēt to be forced to craue pardon for his crime. They must imagine that cruell and violent commands are more sharpe then durable; that no man can bee feared of many, but he must feare much: and that the life of Princes, is as a perpetuall warre, and a perpetuall death, if they bee forced to distrust, and to guard thēselues from so many millions of men which hate their power, if it bee insolent and insupportable.
            
         
         
            
               
               CHAP. 1. Of the diuerse Passions of men, according to their ages and conditions.
               
                  AS all the Countries and parts of the world, are not equally shaken with the tempests of the aire, yet there is not any corner of the earth, nor portion of the Vniuerse, in which there riseth not some little winde, or some small stormes: Euen so, although that all men are not subiect to the furious motions of the same Passions, yet there is not any age nor condition

which doth not feele some effects, & is not in some sort agitated. Onely there is this difference, that the one haue a feeling of one sort, & the other of another: some are more violent, and other haue them more quiet and temperate. For some are Passions befitting yong men; others are incident to men of perfect age; and some are those of olde men: Some the rich and mighty are subiect vnto, and others transport the poore and miserable.
               And first touching that which concernes the Passions of young men, they are hot and fiery by reason of the blood which boyles in their veines; and what they once desire they affect with vehemency. Yet they shew this

heate more particularly in the motions of Loue, whereunto their age which is in the flower, giues them a violent inclination, which appeares in the heate of their pursuites. But they are subiect to all kindes of changes, and haue no constancy in their affections; so as their Passions are properly like to the hunger and thirst of sicke persons, which passe away with the fit of their disease. Or to speake more properly, they resemble Meteors, or wandring fires which are kindled in the aire, and suddainely extinct.
               They are in like manner very ready to the motions of Choler, and are easily transported with disdaine, especially when as they seek to blemish

their honour, or to doe them any kinde of outrage. They are also ambitious, and loue glory passionatly, so as they preferre victory before any other thing, for that it is the highest degree of excellency whereunto they aspire. But they are not couetous, neither doe they loue money, for that they haue not yet tried the miseries of pouerty: like vnto him whom an Ancient reproached, that the contempt hee made of gold, was a signe that hee had not yet felt the sweetnesse thereof; for if he had tasted it, his hands would be more ready, and he would bee more diligent to gather it together. Neither are they maliciously disposed, but shew more plainenesse then cunning in

their actions, for that they haue not yet learned the subtilties, nor tried the malice of the world. But they are credulous, and doe easily beleeue what is said vnto them: for that they haue not yet tried the fraudes of men, nor haue bin often abused.
               Moreouer, they are full of great hopes, like vnto thē that are surprized with wine; both in regard of the heate which abounds in them, as for that they haue not yet felt the iniuries of Fortune: And therefore they liue in hope; for that Hope regards future things, as memory is imployed about that which is past. And as for them, they apprehend, that the time they haue to liue, is long; and they make no account

of that which is past. And for the same reason in the flower of their age, they remember not what is slipt away before their time, but hope for all that is to come, so as they are easie to bee deceiued: for that hauing this beleefe and hope, it is easie to make them beleeue and hope for that which is not. By consequence they are valiant and hardy, both for that they are cholerick, and also for that they are full of good hopes: for Choler takes from them al feare, and hope makes them hardy; whereby they haue a great confidence of the successe of that they vndertake.
               Moreouer, yong mē are bashfull, knowing nothing in this life, but what they haue learned

from the Lawes, or from their education: wherefore when as any thing presents it selfe, of whose nature they are not well instructed, they remain as it were in suspence, and know not what to resolue, and therefore they are commonly subiect to blushing. They are also magnanimous and generous, both for that they haue a good opinion of themselues, as also for that they haue a proud conceit of their courage, holding themselues fit for any great action: and in like manner, for that they haue not yet tried the calamities and miseries, which ouerthrow the fortune and constancy of men, but are ignorant of the afflictions whereunto this life is subiect.
               
                  Finally, they desire rather to vndertake those things which are honorable, then that which concernes profit. For that they gouerne themselues rather by their owne courage, and the bounty of their nature, which hath the honesty of things for obiect, then by the discourse of reason, which doth commonly propound for end, that which is most profitable. Young men doe also loue indifferently the company of such as are of their age and condition, not making any curious choyce of their friends; the which shewes, that they haue more curiosity then care of that which may auaile them in the course of their liues.
               They are also violent, and

obserue no moderation in their motions and actions: so as if they loue, they loue furiously; and if they hate, it is extreame: and so in all other things they keepe no mediocrity. The which grows from their presumption, and for that they haue a conceit to know any thing; which makes them to speake boldly, and to defend their impertinencies wilfully. They commit many errors, but commonly they are the defects of youth, which proceede from the heat of blood, so as there is more insolency in their actions, then affected crimes.
               They are moreouer pittifull and gentle; for that measuring others by their own innocency, they beleeue that al the world is good; and

that they which suffer any extraordinary miserie, haue not deserued it: and for that reason they haue compassion of them.
               Finally, young men are pleasant, witty, and loue to laugh, and to heare a witty ieast, which they thinke is a signe of a good spirit, and therefore admire him. They also loue horses, dogges, huntings, combates, and other exercises, which haue some kinde of violence or pleasure.
               To conclude young men are commonly rich in inuention, but poore in matters of iudgement: they are fit for execution, but incapable for any great dessigne. They are borne to excite troubles, but are not able to pacifie them:

they imbrace much, but hold little: they aspire to the end, but looke not to the meanes: and when they haue committed an error, they will hardly acknowledge it and leaue it; like vnto those resty horses, which leape and bound▪ and will neither stand still nor go forward.
               As for those that grow to age, they haue Passions in a manner quite contrary to young men: for hauing liued long, and beene often deceiued, hauing themselues committed many errors, and knowing also that the world is full of subtilty and villainy; they are not assured of any thing, but looke vpon all things with distrust: and if they deliuer their opinion in any businesse, it is with a kind

of feare: so as it seemes they will make it knowne, that in all things there is more coniecture then certainty: wherfore their ordinary restriction in their answers and discourses, is, It may be, peraduenture it is true. The which proceedes frō the great Idea they haue of the inconstancy of things, & the deceits of men. For the same reason they are malicious, being a meere malice to interpret, as they doe, all things in the worst sence; and for the same reason they are also distrustfull and suspitious: suspitious by reason of their distrust, and distrustfull, in regard of the experience they haue of things. Finally, they neuer loue entirely, neither is their hatred furious, but they loue commonly

as if they should hate, and they hate as if they shold he moued to loue.
               Moreouer, their courage is weake, both in respect of the coldnes of their blood and spirits, as also by reason of calamities past, and the miseries which they haue tried. And for this reason, vnlesse they haue some spice of folly, they doe seldome attempt any hardy enterprizes, nor hazard their fortunes and honors, but they are content to seeke that which may protect them from necessity: whereby they are couetous and fast, fearing to diminish that which they thinke is necessary for them: whereunto they are drawne by experience which hath taught them, how hard a thing it is

to gather great wealth, and how easie it is to lose it. They are in like manner fearefull, and encrease their apprehensions by imagination, and by the fore-sight of the future: wherewith they are alwayes troubled; the which proceeds from the coldnesse of their blood. For this coldnesse which is common to olde men, makes them enclined to feare, whereas heate incites courage and resolution.
               Moreouer, they loue life much, and especially vpon the declining of their dayes; for that men desire that naturally, whereof they haue great neede; and when as they feare it should fly from them, then they desire it more passionately. They commonly powre forth cōplaints, which

are signes of their weaknesse, and which makes them importune: And then they rather imbrace that which is profitable, then what is honorable: wherein they shew themselues commonly extreame, euen base, the which growes from the loue they beare vnto themselues: For profit is the good of that priuate person that doth enioy it, but honour tends to good absolutely, without consideration of the interest of any particular.
               After this they are rather impudent then bashfull; for respecting not honour so much as their owne commodities, they care not for the opinion of the world, but contemne it. Finally, they renounce in a manner all good

hopes, and haue none but bad, both for that they are distrustfull and fearefull; as for that experience hath taught them, that most things are bad, and that they impaire daily: so as they liue rather by memory then hope, for that they haue not long to liue, and haue liued long: for hope is of future things, and memory of what is past.
               And this is the cause that old men are great talkers, for that they take a singular content to commend the times past: In our times (say they) we did this, wee did that: taking a wonderfull content to remember what is past. As for their choler, it is sudden and violent; but it is like a fire of straw, that is soon quencht. Their desires are mortified

or weake, and cannot bee quickened, or receiue any vigor, vnlesse the loue of money possesse them. And therefore they are temperate, and loue frugality, which is a kinde of sparing, for that they gouerne themselues rather by the discourse of reason, then by their owne genius, or their proper inclination: for (as wee haue said) discourse aymes at the end; and courage hath a respect to honesty as a companion to vertue. Their faults sauour more of iniustice then insolency or outrage. They are inclined to mercy, yea, more then young men, but for diuers reasons; for young men are pittifull by humanity, and old men by weaknesse, whose age makes them apprehend

the miseries wherewith they see other men afflicted, as if it hung ouer their heads; which is a consideration (as wee haue said else-where) moues to mercy and pitty: And for this reason they doe nothing but complaine, and they loue not to see any one laugh, neither doe they willingly frequent any that are pleasant and Iouiall; for that their age hath cooled the blood, and made an impression of melancholy which loues seuerity.
               As for vigorous and perfect men, such as are betwixt these two ages, they participate of both their humours, yet they prune of
                     •
                   that which proceedes both in youth and age. Wherefore they obserue a mediocrity in all things, so

as they are neither too audacious nor too timerous, but they hold a meane, neither trusting in all the world, nor distrusting euery thing, but they examin al affaires by the rules of wisdom & truth. And in like manner they are neither, miserable nor prodigall, but measure their expences by the lawes of their power & by honesty. And in like maner they obserue this mediocrity in the other motions of the Irascible and Concupiscible powers. Their valour is tempered, and their temperance is accompanied with courage, wherein they participate both with young and old: For yong men are valiant, but without moderation; and old men are temperate, but full of apprehension

and feare. And to say in a word; all the good qualities which are found diuided both in young and olde, are as it were vnited and tied together in a middle age, which containes it selfe within the bounds of his temper, and naturall inclination: And as for those which haue any excesse or superfluity, either in youth or age; a man that is in this middle age, checks them and cuts them off, reducing them to the point of vertue and honesty.
               We must now see what the Passions of men be, in regard of their fortunes: that is to say, wee must know the Passions of Noblemen, of Rich, and of the powerfull of the Earth; namely of Kings, and Princes. Noblemen haue

this particular Passion, to desire honors vehemently: For as all men naturally wish to encrease the goods they enioy; Noblemen seeing themselues rich in glory, and full of honor, desire to augment their treasure, to the end they may not seeme to plant their triumphes vpon that which their Predecessors haue left them. But as they haue giuen them light by their glory, so they desire to transferre the same beames of brightnesse to their posterity: and commonly, Noblemen hold it a generous vanity not to continue in the same ranke, with those which haue beene equal to their Ancestors; yea, many times they contemne them. Wherefore they desire to adde some thing to

the ornaments of their birth, and to haue a subiect to recommend themselues aboue others. For in truth, the trophees of Families are sometimes so ancient, and so worn with time, as it is an easie thing to surmise any thing. Wherefore generous spirits should preserue that which nature and their birth giues them; otherwise, if they degenerate, it is a famous spectacle of infamy & reproach. As in truth there are some, which degenerating from the magnanimity of their fathers, make vs to see thicke clouds in the midst of their shining glory, as it was said of the sonne of Great Scipio.
               
               This misery happens to Families as to fieldes where

corne and fruites grow; for whilest the soile is good, it yeelds good fruites and rich haruests, but growing barren, it yeeldes nothing that is pure and excellent. So good Families continuing in their vigor, produce worthy plants for a time: But this generous vigor decaying by little and little, they yeelde not such braue and valiant men as formerly they did. In this Realme alone, how many great and worthy Families (whose names are so many starres, and so many flowers which beautifie our ancient Histories) are extinct and lost? Or if there remaine any Reliques, they rest vnknowne.
               Finally, when as Nobility comes to degenerate, it

giues vs monsters of fury: for he that is puft vp with the glory of his Ancestors, and will stray from their vertues, imagineth, that hee cannot make better shew of the splendour of his birth, then by the insolencies and violencies which accompany their actions: Whereof wee haue seene prodigious examples in the carriages of the descendants of Dionysius the Tyrant, and Alcibiades. And it is a misery in humane things, that as good trees grow wild and sauage, either for want of pruning and manuring, or for that the soyle is not fauourable: So great Families lose the glory of those that were their founders. And as Philosophers affirme, that there is no worse corruption

then that which growes from things soueraignly excellent, as we finde in the corruption of perfumes: so it happens that Families full of magnanimity and courage, degenerate into dull and stupid spirits, as wee haue seene in the posterities of Symon, Berides, and Socrates, forbearing to speake of our owne age.
               As for the Passions of rich men, they are knowne to all the world, for that euery man sees that these menare proud, insolent, and outragious. For feeling themselues supported by their wealth, they imagine that all things are in their power. For that riches, through the couetousnesse of men, set as it were, a price of all other things which they may buy.
               
                  Rich men are also voluptuous, effeminate, and full of ostentation, and vanity, that makes them to glory of their treasure; they are voluptuous and effeminate by reason of the cōtinuall delights wherein they plunge themselues: they are vaine, and glory of their wealth, for that their thoughts are perpetually imployed in the imagination of their aboundance, whereof they are rather slaues and Idolaters, then true possessors and masters. And moreouer they imagine, that all the world loues what they loue. Wherein they are not much deceiued, for that infinite numbers of persons haue neede of the assistance of riches. Wherefore a Philosopher beeing demaunded by a

Princesse, whether it were better to be rich or wise: he answered, that it was better to be rich; for, said hee, wee commonly see wise men at rich mens gates to beg their fauours. Rich men also haue commonly this vanity, that they hold themselues worthy of great imploymēts, because they are rich, in regard wherof, they thinke it reasonable they shold command others: And to speake in a word, the riches of a happy man (destitute of wisedome) discouers his inclination. But there is great difference betwixt the Passions of those that are newly raised to great fortunes, & such as haue enioyed them long: And we must not doubt, but that they that haue newly gotten their

wealth, are more vicious and more insolent, then such as haue enioyed it from their Ancestors; for they enter into their riches as into a new possession, in the which they are altogether ignorant. As for the crimes which either of them commit, they sauour more of insolency & incontinency, then of malice; for commonly they are polluted with adulteries, and doe outrage to such as resist their desires.
               It rests now to speake of Princes, Kings, and the great men of the earth, whose Passions also are well knowne, for that they much resemble those of rich men; yet wee must confesse, that they haue sometimes bin more moderat and more milde; for great

men are commonly more iealous of their honour, and more generous then the rich: for that they are imployed in greater actions, and haue a more eminent glory to preserue. Wherefore they are contented to mainetaine their dignity, not caring for any affected grauity: for that dignity giues a greater splendour vnto men. And therefore they shew themselues temperate, and hold a mediocrity, for that dignity is sweete, and grauity is reuerend.
               Finally, when they once breake out, they commit no small mischiefes; For that commonly the effects are proportionable to their causes; and finding themselues armed and powerfull, they

execute their Passions violently, and doe vnspeakeable wrongs; like vnto great riuers, which breaking forth spoyle the haruest, and ruine the labourers hope. Whereunto we may adde, that prosperity doth also make them more insolent; for that seeing thēselues powerful in means, and fortunate in their dessignes, they grow proud, and liue without any consideration of vertue or vice, by reason of the fauours of Fortune which blind their eyes. And yet there are some good natures, who in steed of growing proud, or forgetting themselues in the height of their fortune, become more temperate, more religious, and more fearing God: for that they acknowledge their

greatnesse as a guift and fauour of his prouidence, to the which for this consideration they are more affectionate, and more deuout then other men, considering the great benefits they haue receiued.
            
            FINIS.
