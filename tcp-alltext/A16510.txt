               RIghte honorable and my ſingular good Lord and Maſter, vvhen I had often repeated and called to my remembraunce the opinion and ſayings of the ſage and auncient VVriters, that one man ſhould be an inſtructer to an other, by ſeeking and paynes taking to doe them good: ſo at ſundry times haue I ſtudied and deuiſed vvith my ſelfe vvhat thing to take in 
                  ••
               nde that might moſt profite my friends, and my 
                  〈◊〉
                countrey: and at the length it came vnto my remembrance hovv neceſſarie a thing it vvas for Seafaring men to haue ſome good inſtructions, vvhervpon I haue vvritten this baſe and ſimple Regiment for the Sea, and Rules of Nauigation, for that I knovve it to be ſo needefull and neceſſarie for all ſortes of Sea men. Therfore at ſundrie times as I haue had leaſure, I haue compyled and vvritten this baſe and ſimple vvorke, calling to remembraunce the ſaying of Plinie, vvho

thought all that time loſt vvhich he did not beſtovve at his booke: I beeing of all other moſt ſimple, yet notvvithſtanding this enterpriſe haue I taken in hande, to publiſhe this ſimple booke vnto all men. And for that, all my labours be due vnto your Honorable Lordſhip, according to my bounden dutie I preferre it vnto your Honor, hoping that your Lordſhip vvill voutchſafe to take it in good parte, and to receyue this barbarous vvorke, more to take it as my good vvill (vvhiches is to offer things of much more excellencie) than the fineneſſe of the vvorke, for that it is but ſimple. AÂnd ſo ſhall I not onely be ſatisfied, but alſo further encouraged heereafeer to trauell, according to the ſimple gifte and talent that God hath giuen vnto me: for that it is not altogither gathered out of other bokes, but that the greateſt part is deuiſed and practiſed by me. Therefore I truſt my labours (ſuche as they be) ſhall not hynder the cunning and learned ſorte, but further the late beginners that are as yet not vvell inſtructed. And thus I ceaſſe to trouble your honorable Lordeſhip any longer, deſiring you to take this ſimple thing in good part, as a true token and ſigne of my good vvill, beſeeching God of his grace to proſper your Lordſhip in honor and vertue, vvith perfect health. Amen.
            
               By your Honors poore ſeruant William Bourne.
               
            
         
         
            
            
               ❧The Preface to the Reader.
            
               IN my opinion (gentle Reader) which alſo is the ſaying and writing of all the Philoſophers, thoſe thinges are moſte principally to be taught and maynteined, whiche in the common wealth are moſte profitable and neceſſarie. Then may I boldely ſay (without iuſt cauſe of reproofe) and affirme, that Nauigation is not the leaſt but one of the principal matters to be knowne, as this time dothe require: Conſidering the ſtate and ſcituation of our countrie, for that we be inuironed rounde aboute with the Sea, ſo that we neither can go out of our countrie, neyther they that are of other countries can come at vs, but onely by Sea. Theſe things (I ſay) conſidered, what can there be more neceſſarie to be taught in our common wealth than Nauigation, conſidering alſo what Nauigation is: as Nauigation is how to direct ones courſe vpon or thorow the ſea, where he findeth no path to any place aſſigned, and how to attayne the porte or place appointed in ſhorteſt time, how alſo to preſerue the ſhippe and goodes in al common diſturbances, as ſtormes, daungers by the way, and ſuch other like &c. Moreouer and beſides that, it is not vnknowne howe neceſſarie Nauigation is, both for the tranſportation of our commodities, to find vent for them in other countries (whereby no ſmall numbre of people is ſet a

worke in England) and alſo the bringing of other commodities (that we haue neede of) vnto vs, by which meanes the Queenes Maieſtie receyueth no ſmall benefite for hir cuſtomes. &c. And furthermore, for that Nauigation is the chiefe force and ſtrength of our countrie, which whether it be true I referre to the iudgement of all men, and although I be but ſimple (gentle Reader) & a great number of excellent learned men in the Mathematicall Science haue written diuerſe bookes of Coſmographie and Nauigation, yet notwithſtā
               ding I haue written this Regiment for the Sea with a fewe rules of Nauigation, as it were a noſegay whoſe floures are of mine owne gathering. And albeit the learned ſorte of Seafaring men haue no neede of this booke, yet am I aſſured that it is a neceſſarie booke for the ſimpleſt ſort of Seafaring men: for that they ſhall finde here the names of the circles in the ſphere, with the names of diuerſe things meete for Nauigation, togither with their vſes, which the moſt parte of Sea men do miſtake or miſſe call: neyther do they know the vſe of them being yet moſt neceſſarie for them that vſe Nauigation, in whiche alſo there is a table of declination calculated for .4. yeres, (that is to ſay, for the yeare of our Lord .1573. the firſte after Biſſextilis, the yeare .1574. beyng the ſecond yeare, & the yeare .1575. which is the third yeare, with the yeare .1576. whiche is the yeare of Biſſextilis or leape yeare it ſelfe) whiche the Sea men do call a Regiment, and will ſerue for .24. yeare without

any great errour: and is exactly calculated for the Longitude of London for the inſtāt time of noone, and will ſerue all Europe and Affrica, neare vnto the coaſt of America without much errour, ſauing in Februarie, Marche or September, whileſt the ſunne hath ſwifte declination. But in Iune and December it will ſerue al the world ouer: bycauſe the ſunne hath but ſlowe declination, &c. And alſo there be other neceſſarie rules of Nauigation to know how to handle the Sunnes declination, to knowe the altitude of eyther of the .2 Poles, (as the contentes of the booke do ſhewe) with other neceſſarie things meete to be knowne in Nauigation, and not mentioned in the booke of Martin Curtiſe called the Arte of Nauigation. Neyther doe I meane to write of any thing mentioned in that booke: for that it is there ſufficiently declared already. And thus (gentle Readers) I deſire you to beare with my rudeneſſe, that I ſhoulde take vpon me to open any ſcience, for that I am vtterly vnlearned, and without helpe of any learned perſons, deſiring you not to conceyue any euil opinion of me, but to take it as my good will, minding to profite my natiue Countrey as muche as lyeth in me. Notwithſtanding it is poſſible that ſome people will be offended with me, that I ſhoulde write this ſimple Treatiſe, but then I conſider agayne, and knowe, that vertue lacketh no enimies and defacers, and vyce lacketh no friendes and maynteyners, ſo that knowledge lacketh no contempt, neyther ignorance lacketh furtherance,

& eſpecially among all people there is none more ready to contemne, than the ignorāt ſort: for ignoraunce is the father of all errours and the mother of contention. And thus I drawe to ende, deſiring you to take this ſimple worke in good part, being willing to pleaſure my natiue countrie according to the ſimple talent that God hath giuen me And whereas you finde any errour I pray you let me gently vnderſtand, for I thinke not that I cauſe circumſpectly worke but I may be deceyued, for man cannot be ſo preciſe but he may erre, and I haue ſeldome heard of any the beſt Authours but he hath erred in ſome poynt: therefore in thoſe things that he knoweth not of himſelfe he muſte needes follow his Authour, and if his Author doe erre he muſt needes fall into that errour that his Author dothe. And furthermore, a numbre of people there be that deuiſe nothing els but lies and ſlaunders, yea, and thoſe which cannot attayne to any thing themſelues, doe hate all thoſe that be not ignorant as they themſelues be: for the corrupt nature of man is ſuche, that it is a corſey to their harts that any ſhould be commended before themſelues, for generally amongſt all people of the earth (whiche is innumerable) euery ſeuerall perſon thinketh himſelfe moſt worthie, imagining themſelues to haue no fellowes: ſuche is the Diuill in the harte of man, pampering mans hart ſo with pryde to thinke he hath no fellow, whereas man of himſelfe is not able to do any good thing, no not to thinke one good thought, but by the only

might and prouidence of almighty God, therefore of our ſelues we can do nothyng that is good. And thus gentle Reader I make an end. If this ſimple and barbarous thing be taken in good parte, then looke for other of my workes ſhortly, and beare him good will that ſtudieth for the benefite of his natiue countrie, deſiryng God of his grace, that I and you may do that thing that may be to the laude, prayſe and glory of God, to our commoditie and ſoules health, to the profite of our brethren, and the common wealth of this our realme. Thus I betake you to Almightie God the creator of all things, praying him that both I & you may after this life reſt in the kingdome of heauen, with Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob, there to remayne world without ende. Amen.

               WHo ſo thou art that mindſt to paſſe the ſeas,
               By Compaſſe, Carde, the Sunne, or ſtarrie ſkie,
               Marke well this worke, and gayne thereby ſuch eaſe,
               As ſhall attayne thee profite great perdie,
               Such rules hath Bourne directed to thine eye,
               That euen by them, if ſaylings art were gone,
               Thou mightſt by theſe direct thy courſe alone.
            
            
               
               T. H. In prayſe of the Author.
               WHo trauels Countries gaine is worthy of great prayſe:
               as thoſe yt were before our time & yy in ſundry ways.
               Whoſe actes do ſo excell, they pierce the loftie ſkies
               that in good artes for cōmon weale, both wit & will applies
               For thoſe that were tofore, haue bene aduanſt by fame,
               by due deſert, by doing well, haue merited the ſame.
               As Authors old can tell, who liſt in them to reade
               who were inuēters of the ſame which dayly now procéede
               In rule of publike weale, our Ioue it firſt began
               and plaſt it here in all eſtates, for the behoofe of man.
               So now thou Seamen eke, that ſpredſt abroad thy ſayle
               be thankfull for thy Author here, whiche is for thy auayle.
               Whoſe trauaile and whoſe toyle is thy behoofe and gayne,
               if thou doſt reape what he did ſow, it quiteth wel his paine,
               And thankfulneſſe is due, to euery liuing wight,
               and doth perteyne to euery man, but yet to God by right.
               To whō be praiſe for euermore, which ruleth globe & ſphere,
               who graūt vs grace to do his will, while we be liuing here.
               FINIS.
            
            
               A. R. To the Author.
               WHy doeſt thou Bourne thy ſelfe hold backe
               not doing what thou ſhouldſt?
               Me thinkes I heare thée Anſwere make
               that if thou durſt thou wouldſt.
               Whereof art thou afrayde? tell forth
               to me thy doubtfull caſe:
               To vtter truth no man there is
               that ones will hide his face.
               
                  Perhaps thou fearſt the ſcoffing kin
                     •
                  
               
               of Momus dearlings deare,
               Perhaps againe thou ſtandſt in doubt,
               and art now daſht with feare.
               To ſee theſe ſhaking quaking réedes
               that bend with euery blaſt,
               Looke frowning on this booke, in which
               great paine beſtowd thou haſt.
               Why did not then Demoſthenes
               
               his workes hide out of ſight?
               Why did not Tullie ſtay his pen,
               when he began to write?
               If taunting tongue of Momus then
               had bene ſo rife as now
               Thou thinkſt perchance they would haue fear
                     •
                  
               
               the ſame as well as thou.
               No ſure thou art deceyud: there were
               as many lightbraynes then,
               As there be now in theſe our dayes
               to carpe at painfull penne.
               But Countries profite lo it was
               that cauſed them to write,
               And prayſe of good men did prouoke
               their workes to come to light.
               And haſt not thou ſpent all the time
               of writing this thy booke
               For countries ſake, to profite all
               that will vouchſafe to looke
               Thereon? behold what prayſe he reapt
               that ſhip did firſt inuent:
               It cannot be but they which reade
               perceiue ſhall thine intent.
               Can any deeme amiſſe of thee
               that vſe of ſhip haſt told,
               When ſhips inuentor gayned hath
               ſuch prayſes manifold?
               
                  Doeſt thou not know inuention
               what of it may be thought,
               When vſe and ſauegarde of the ſame
               there is none knoweth ought?
               The Prouerbe ſayth, a thing that is
               to big to gripe in hand,
               Can not be holden lenger than
               the ſiefe can holde the ſand.
               In booke it cannot be denied
               but thou haſt taken payne
               To ſet forth playne the vſe of ſayle
               for Countries common gayne.
               Although I know how odious
               compariſons be ſtill,
               Be ſure examples take thou mayſt
               and vſe them at thy will.
               Sith therefore thou example haſt
               of famous memorie,
               
                  Demonſthenes and Tullie eke
               extold vnto the ſkie,
               Wh' excelling farre all other men
               in Gréeke and Latine phraſe
               Were ſubiect yet to Sicophantes
               
               and vnder Momus blaſe.
               Thou haſt beſides all this, the truth
               by practiſe truly tride,
               Whereby if any kicke at thée
               they may be ſoone eſpide.
               Of good men I dare boldly ſay
               that good will thou ſhalt haue,
               For euill of thée they none will ſpeake,
               and prayſe thou doeſt not craue.
               Therefore I wiſhe thee naught to feare
               the force that tongues can bende
               But ſtill the worke thou haſt begonne
               to bryng to perfect ende.

            FOr that the common people do fall into ſuche a numbre of errours as touching the length of the day, holding an opiniō that in euery .15. dayes, the day is an houre longer or ſhorter, the truth is this: the day dothe keepe no ſuche proportion in the lengthening and ſhorting, but dothe length and ſhorte according vnto the ſwiftneſſe and the ſlowneſſe of the ſunnes declination, for when the Sunne hath ſwifte declination, then doth the day lengthen and ſhorten apace: and when that the Declination is ſlowe, then dothe the day lengthen or ſhorten but ſlowly. And yet the moſt parte of the common people do holde an opinion, that at Chriſtmaſſe or els at New yeares day at the furtheſt the day muſt néedes be an houre longer, & yet the Sunne hath not declined or come towardes the Equinoctiall .2. degrées and a halfe, whiche will not make halfe an houre in the length of the day. Wherefore I do thinke it good to declare thorowe the whole yeare when the day is an houre longer or ſhorter here in this place for the Latitude or heigth of the pole Articke at London, the Pole beyng rayſed .51. degrées and .32. minutes, or .34. minutes: and our longeſt Somer day is .16. houres and a halfe, and our ſhorteſt winter day is .7. houres and a halfe from the riſing of the Sunne vnto the ſetting of the Sunne: and firſte this, the ſhorteſt winter day is the .11. or .12. day of December, and then the Sunne riſeth a quarter of an houre after .8. and ſetteth a quarter of an houre before .4. of the clocke, and then the Sunne hath his greateſt declination vnto the Southwardes. And then the .29. day of December the day is a quarter of an houre longer, then riſeth the Sunne at .8. of the clocke and ſettes at .4. And then the 17. or .18 of Ianuarie the day is an houre longer and not before, for the Sunne muſte be declined from hir Solſtick of winter .5. degrées and .12. minuts before the day is lengthned an houre, ſo that I do affirme, that from the .4. or .5. day of Nouember, vnto the .17. or .18. day of Ianuary, in all that time the day is but one houre ſhorter and longer, which is the time of 10. wéekes. And then the .27. or .28. of Ianuarie the night is 
                  •
               5. houres long, then riſeth the Sunne half an houre after .7.

and ſetteth halfe an houre after foure of the clocke. And then the .11. or .12. day of Februarie the day is .10. houres long, then riſeth the Sunne at .7. and ſetteth at .5. of the clocke. And then the .26. day of Februarie the day is .11. houres long, then riſeth the Sunne halfe an houre after .6. and ſetteth halfe an houre after .5. of the clocke. And then the .11▪ day of Marche the ſunne is vpon the Equinoctiall and the day iuſte .12. houres long all the world ouer. And then the .24. day of Marche the day is .13. houres long, and then riſeth the Sunne halfe an houre before 6. and ſetteth halfe an houre after .6. of the clocke. And then the .7. day of Aprill the day is .14. houres long, and then riſeth the Sunne at .5. of the clocke iuſt, and ſetteth at .7. of the clocke iuſte. And then the .23. day of Aprill the day is .15. houres long, and there riſeth the Sunne halfe an houre before .5. and ſetteth halfe an houre after .7. of the clocke. And then the .15. day of Maye the day is .16. houres long, then riſeth the Sunne at .4. of the clocke and ſetteth at .8. of the clocke iuſte. And then the .11. of Iune the Sunne hath hir greateſt declination to the Northwarde, and then is our longeſt Somer dayes, and then it is .16. houres and a halfe from the Sunne riſing vnto the Sunne ſetting, ſo that the Sunne riſeth a quarter of an houre before .4. and ſetteth a quarter of an houre after eight of the clocke. And then the .10. day of Iulie the day is .16. houres long, then riſeth the ſunne at .4. and ſetteth at .8. of the clocke. And then the laſte of Iuly the day is .15. houres long. And then the .16. day of Auguſt the day is .14. houres long. And then the laſte day of Auguſt the day is .13. houres long. And then the .13. or .14. of September the ſunne is vpon the Equinoctiall, and the day iuſte .12. houres long. And then the .27. day of September the day is .11. houres long. And then the 11. of October the day is .10. houres long. And then the .26. day of October the day is .9. houres long. And then the .15. day of Nouember the day is .8. houres long, and ſo vnto the .11. or 12. of December, and then the day is at the ſhorteſt (as before is declared.) Thus much haue I ſayde as touching the length of the day by euen houres, whiche ſome people will haue at

the entrance of the Sunne into the .12. ſignes, of which in the lengthing and ſhorting of the day there is no ſuch matter, but onely this looke, when that the Sunne hath declined .5. degrées and .12. minutes in this our Latitude, then is the day an houre longer or ſhorter, as you ſhall finde this matter more larglier ſpoken of in all places thorowe the worlde, in the .

            ¶An Introduction vnto the Regiment for the Sea.
            The names of certaine things neceſſarie to be known of them that are Mariners or Seafaring men, meete to bee knowne of them that doe practiſe Nauigation, as this: the names of the circles of the Sphere, and what they are, and their vſes: and alſo the names of other things belonging therevnto, and what they are, and their vſes.
            
               Firſt vvhat the Horizon circle is.
               
                  THe Horizon is the parting of the earthe or the Sea and the ſkye, that is to ſay, the halfe of the heauens being aboue ouer your heade, and the other halfe hidden with the earth or Sea vnder them: and this Horizon circle dothe moue as you doe moue: for as you doe by trauell chaunge your place, ſo doth the Horizon chaunge in all points.
               
                  The vſe of the Horizon circle.
                  THe vſe of the Horizon circle is this, to take the heigth of the Sunne or any ſtarre, with the croſſe ſtaffe, ſetting the one ende with the Horizon, and the other ende with the Sunne or ſtarre, ſo that you haue a true Horizon: and that muſt be doone vpon the Sea, or elſe it muſt be a very playne grounde vpon the toppe of a hill, elſe it is no true Horizon. And alſo if the Sunne or Moone, or any ſtarre be to be ſéene, thē they be aboue the Horizon: if they be not to be ſéene, then they be vnder the Horizon.
               
            
            
               2. VVhat the Meridian circle is.
               THe Meridian is a circle beginning due South, and ſo paſſing by youre Zenith that is right ouer the crowne

of your head, and ſo by the two Poles of the worlde: and if you doe trauell due South and North, you doe not chaunge youre Meridian: but in the going or trauelling any other way, you do chaunge it.
               
                  The vſe of the Meridian circle.
                  THe vſe of the Meridian circle is, to knowe the iuſt tyme of noone by the Sunne: for as ſoone as the middle of the Sunne is vpon the Meridian, then it is noone, and when the Sunne, Moone, or any Star is vpon the Meridian, then they be fartheſt from the Horizon, and it is a meete time to take their heigth for to know the altitude or heigth of the Pole of the worlde, whereby you may perfitly knowe howe farre you bee too the Southwardes or Northwardes of any place.
               
            
            
               3. VVhat the Equinoctiall circle is, being a Paralell line or circle fixed.
               THe Equinoctiall is a fixed circle in the Heauens equally diſtant from both the Poles, and doth paſſe directly ouer the middle of the earth rounde about, and is called the Equinoctiall, for that if the Sunne be there, then thorowe all the whole world the Sunne is twelue houres aboue the Horizon, and twelue houres vnder the Horizon ſauing vnder the two Poles, and there the Equinoctiall is with the Horizon. So they ſhal ſee half the Sunne and no more, till the Sunne be departed from the Equinoctiall. And alſo to them that do inhabite or dwell in any place vnder the Equinoctiall, the Sunne, Moone, and all the Starres be twelue hours aboue the Horizon, and twelue houres vnder the Horizon.
               
                  The vſe of the Equinoctiall circle.
                  THe vſe of the Equinoctiall, is to knowe what declination the Sunne or any other Starre hath from it, and of whiche ſide, and by that is known the heigth of the Equinoctial,

and by the heigth of that is known the heigth of either of the two Poles of the world.
               
            
            
               4 VVhat the circle or Tropicke of Cancer is, being a Paralell circle fixed.
               THe Tropicke of Cancer is the greateſt declination that the Sunne doth come vnto the Northwards, and then is our longeſt Sommer dayes, and ſhorteſt nights.
            
            
               5. VVhat the circle or Tropick of Capricorne is, being a Paralell circle fixed.
               THe Tropicke of Capricorne, is the greateſt declination that the ſunne doth go vnto the Southwards, and then is our ſhorteſt Winter dayes, and longeſt nights.
               The vſes of theſe two circles be but ſmal, but that the days béeing at the longeſt or ſhorteſt, the Sunne dothe returne backe againe. &c.
            
            
               6. VVhat the Articke circle is, beeing a Paralell circle.
               THe Articke circle doth touch the Horizon due North, and is according to the place that you are in, of any place vpon the face of the earth, and doth wyden and narrow according vnto the altitude or heigth of the Pole: for as you doe goe vnto the South partes, then dothe your Articke circle growe narower and narower, vntill you come right vnder the Equinoctiall line, and then haue you no Articke circle: and if that you do goe vnto the North partes, then doth your Articke circle growe wider and wider: and where the North Pole is rayſed .66. degrées and a half, there the Artick circle is iuſt with the Tropick of Cancer, and then vnder the north Pole, there your Artick circle is with the Equinoctial.
               
                  The vſe of the Articke circle.
                  THe vſe of the Articke circle, is to knowe what Starres doe neuer ſet vntoo you, for all thoſe Starres or lyghtes that you doe ſée vnder the Pole, doe not ſet: and if that you bee vnto the North wardes, of the height of the Pole, more

than .66. degrées and a halfe: if that the Sunne or Moone be in the Tropick of Cancer, they ſhall not goe downe vnto you vnder the Horizon, but ſhall bée ſtill in ſighte vnto you, ſo that they be not let by the cloudes and other accidentes.
               
            
            
               7. VVhat the Antarticke circle is, beeing a Paralell circle.
               THe Antarticke circle doth touch the Horizon due South, and is oppoſite or right agaynſte the Articke circle, and dothe wyde and narrowe in all poyntes, and dothe not differ from the Articke circle, ſauing the Articke circle is aboue the Horizon, and the Antartike circle is vnderneath the Horizon.
               
                  The vſe of the Antarticke circle.
                  THe vſe of the Antarticke circle is as the Articke is in all poyntes, to knowe what ſtarres will not appeare aboue your Horizon, and in like manner, to the Northwardes of 66. degrées and a halfe, (the Sunne or Moone being in the Tropicke of Capricorne) then they wyll not ryſe aboue the Horizon.
               
            
            
               8. VVhat the Zodiacke is, beeing a circle.
               THe Zodiacke is the greateſt circle in all the Heauens, wherein all the wandering lightes or Planets doe kéepe theyr courſes, that is to ſay, the Sunne and Moone, and the other fiue Planets or Starres, that is to ſay, Saturne, Iupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. &c. whiche circle is deuided into twelue equall partes, called the twelue ſinges, as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagitarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Piſces, the which circle ſtandeth oblique equinoctiall or awrye, croſſing in the middle at two places: the Northermoſt parte is the middle of the Zodiacke, and that is the Tropicke of Cancer: and the Southermoſt

parte is the tropicke of Capricorne, the very midle of the zodiack: and that line in the midle of the zodiack, is called the ecliptick lyne, and the zodiack is .21. degrees broade, that is to ſay, ſixe degrées from the eclipticke line vnto the north parts, and ſixe degrées vnto the South parts.
               
                  The vſe of the Zodiack.
                  THe vſe of the Zodiack is, through the mouing of the Sunne and Moone & the other planets, to know in what ſigne they be, and alſo to know the time of the chaunge of the Moone, with all the other reſpectes: and in like manner to know the aſpects of all the other planets vnto the Moone, and alſo the planets amongſt themſelues: and by the aſpectes in the .12. ſignes is gathered their effects, and in what countrey it may happen.
               
            
            
               9. VVhat the line Ecliptick is.
               THe line ecliptick, is a circle in the very middle of the Zodiack, the whiche the very midle or center of the Sunne doth go vpon.
               
                  The vſe of the line Ecliptick.
                  THe vſe of the line Ecliptick is this, if that the Moone or any other ſtarre be vnto the North part therof, then it is ſayd that they haue North latitude, and if vnto the Southe part, then they haue ſouth latitude: and alſo by this circle called the line ecliptick, is knowne the eclipſe of the Sunne and the Moone.
               
            
            
               10. VVhat the artick polare circle is, being a paralell circle fixed.
               THe artick polare circle is made by the pole of the Zodiack, or pole of the circle ecliptick .23. degrées and a halfe in the heauens from the poles of the world aboue the horizon.
            
            
               
               11. VVhat the antartick Polare circle is, being a Paralell circle fixed.
               THe antartick Polare circle is iuſt oppoſite vnto ye artick polare, made by the antartick pole vnderneath our horizon. The vſe of them I will declare, when I ſpeake of the poles of the Ecliptick or Zodiack.
            
            
               12. VVhat the two circles called Colures be. &c.
               THe .2. circles called Colures, be thoſe that do deuide the Zodiack, and all the other paralell circles into .4. equall parts, the one of the circles doth croſſe the Zodiack in the firſt point of Aries and Libra, and ſo paſſeth by the .2. poles of the world, and is called the equinoctiall colure: and the other colure circle doth croſſe the Zodiacke in the firſte pointe of Cancer and Capricorne, and ſo paſſeth the .2. poles of the world, and there at the .2. poles the one circle doth croſſe the other: and that is called the Solſtitiall colure.
               
                  The vſe of theſe two circles.
                  THe vſe of the .2. colure circles is this, the Sunne placing by them doth deuide the yeare into .4. partes: as this, the Sunne in the firſt point of Aries, is Spring time. &c.
               
            
            
               13. VVhat the .2. Poles of the world is, imagined to be as an axiltree.
               THe .2. poles of the world, imagined to be as an axiltrée, (that is to ſay, the North pole called the pole artick, and the South pole called the pole antartick) the one is directly againſt the other: the North pole alwayes aboue our horizon, and the South pole antartick always vnder our horizon, being fixed faſt in the heauens, and the equinoctiall iuſt and equally betwéene them: and the cauſe why that it is imagined too bee an axiltree is thys, for that the whole heauens and all the lyghtes of the Firmamente be caried rounde aboute from the Eaſt vnto the Weſt in .24. houres:

ſo that no light nor place remayneth vnremoued, but onely the .2. poles of the world.
               
                  The vſe of the Poles of the world.
                  THe vſe of the .2. Poles, is this, to knowe how farre we do tranſporte our ſelues, and to know what climate, and temperatneſſe we be in as touching heate and colde.
               
            
            
               14. VVhat the .2. Poles of the Zodiack is, imagined to be an axiltree in the heauens.
               THe .2. Poles of the Zodiack, or Ecliptick, imagined to bée as an axiltrée, (the artick pole of the Zodiack, or rather the Ecliptick, and the Antartick pole of the Zodiack) the one being directly againſte the other, and the Zodiack or rather the middle thereof, called the ecliptick, to be iuſt or equall betwéene them, are called the Poles of the Zodiacke: for that the Sunne and the Moone, and the other planets and fixed ſtarres do moue vnto the eaſtward, according to the ſtanding of the Zodiack. &c.
               
                  The vſe of the Poles of the Zodiack.
                  TThe vſe of the two Poles of the Zodiack is this, (as it is before declared) that the Zodiack is deuided intoo 12. equall partes, called the .12. ſignes, and thoſe diuiſions by imagination do paſſe vnto the poles of the Zodiack, in ſuche forme as the meridian lynes do all meete at the poles of the world, and ſo do all thoſe diuiſions méete at the two poles of the Zodiack, and then any ſtarre, that is out of the Zodiack, eyther vnto the ſouthwards, or northwardes, (according vnto thoſe diuiſions) they be called in the ſignes.
               
            
            
               15. VVhat the Zenith or verticall point is, imagined to be as an axiltree.
               
                  THe Zenith or vertical point, is imagined to be a pricke in the heauens right ouer the crowne of your head, and is moueable as we our ſelues be, and is as an axiltrée vnto the horizon circle: and as you do tranſport your ſelfe from one place vnto another, ſo doth your Zenith or verticall poynte, and your horizon circle alſo.
               
                  The vſe of the Zenith or verticall poynt. &c.
                  THe vſe of the Zenith or verticall point is this, to knowe howe néere or farre off any ſtarre is from your zenith, by taking the true heigth of any ſtarre with an inſtrumente, for that from your zenith is always .90. degrées down vnto the horizon on euery ſide round about you, as it ſhall more plainely appeare hereafter where I ſpeake of degrées.
               
            
            
               16. VVhat a Degree is.
               A Degrée is the part or diuiſion of a whole circle, into .360. equall parts, how bigge or ſmal ſoeuer the circle be.
               
                  The vſe of the Degrees is manyfold.
                  THe vſe of the degrées is to knowe by the Sunne and Moones courſe in the zodiack, or any other of the planets or mouable ſtarres, how many degrees they be aſunder: whereby is knowne at what time they haue any aſpecte the one with the other. And alſo by the degrees it is knowne, what latitude and what declination any light or ſtarre hath from the ecliptick or equinoctial: and alſo the degrées wil ſhewe vnto you, howe many myles that you do tranſporte your ſelfe vpon the earth to the South or North partes, for that euery degree doth aunſwer vnto .60. engliſh miles, in the going South and North: which is knowne by the altitude of the North pole or the numbre of degrees betwene the equinoctiall and your zenith or verticall point, for from your zenith vnto the horizon, is .90. degrees to the ſouthwards, and 90. degrees vnto the Northwards, whiche is halfe the compaſſe

of the heauens for twice .90. is .180. and then the earthe doth hide the other halfe of the heauens: and twice .180. maketh .360. the whole contents of the compaſſe of euery greate circle in the heauens.
               
            
            
               17. VVhat a Minute is.
               OF Minuts there be two ſortes, minuts of time, and minuts of meaſure, and is no other thing but the leſſer parte of tyme or meaſure, whiche is the .60. parte of a degree, or the .60. parte of an houre: and all the diuiſions in theſe matters, is by .60. For as .60. Minuts is a degrée or an hour, ſo .60. ſeconds is a Minute, and .60. thirds is a ſeconde, and .60. fourths is a third. &c.
            
            
               18. Altitude is heigthe: the vſe thereof.
               ALtitude is the heigthe of any thing taken, as the heigthe of the Sunne, or any Starre, or the heigth of the Pole, aboue the horizon: or the heigth of a ſteeple, or a tower, or ſuch other lyke.
            
            
               19. Latitude is wideneſſe: the vſe thereof.
               LAtitude is in the heauens: if the Moone, or any other Starre be vnto the South parts or the North partes of the ecliptick, that then it is ſayde, to be ſo manye degrees in latitude or wideneſſe, from ye line ecliptick to the South or North part: and alſo latitude is counted vpon the earthe in like maner, if that you be in any place betwéene, from vnder the equinoctiall, either to the South or North part, betwéene any of the .2. Poles, that you are ſo many degrées in latitude from the equinoctiall. &c.
            
            
               20. Longitude is length: the vſe thereof.
               LOngitude in the heauens is, if the Sunne or Moone or any other Starre, be in ſuche a ſigne, & ſo many degrées: that then it is ſaid: that they haue longitude, in ſuch a ſigne and ſo

many degrées. And alſo longitude vpon the earth, is counted from the Canarie Ilands vnto the Eaſtward, as this, if that any towne or cittie be vnto the Eaſtwards ſo many degrées from the Canarie Ilands, then it is ſayde, that the cittie or towne is ſo many degrées in Longitude, whereby is knowne the time of the chaunges of the Moone, or any other aſpecte, or anye Eclipſe of the Sunne or Moone, at the cittie or towne.
            
            
               21. Declination is leaning: the vſe thereof.
               DEclination is counted in the heauens, if that the Sunne or any other Starre be vnto the North part, or South part of the equinoctiall, then it is ſaide, that the Sunne or Starre hath ſo many degrees of declination to the South, or to the North parts, as it happeneth. &c.
            
            
               22. Circumference is the compaſſe of a circle by the outer edge.
               DIameter is the bredth of a circle, paſſing right ouer the center or midle thereof, from outſide vnto outſide.
            
            
               23. Center is the middle pricke in any circle, equally diſtant from the edge of the circle in euery place.
               AParelell line or circle is, if two lines or more (how many ſoeuer there be) be equally diſtaunt in euery place alike, being right lines.
            
            
               24. Auge what it is.
               AVge is a point in the heauens, whē the Sunne or Moone is excentrick, going neerer vnto the heauens, and further from the earth than hir common order is: and the oppoſition thereof is, when that the Sunne and Moone do come nearer vnto the earth than they do at any other time.
               
                  The vſe thereof.
                  
                     THe vſe thereof is, to knowe when that they be in theyr ſwift motion, or in their ſlow motiō: in the point of Auge, they be in their ſlow motiō, in the oppoſition thereof in their ſwift motion.
               
            
            
               25. VVhat the head or tayle of the Dragon is.
               THe head of the Dragon, is the place where that the Moone dothe come ouer the line Ecliptick, from the South part, vnto the North part: and the tayle of the Dragon is, where the Moone paſſeth ouer the line ecliptick, from the Northe part, vnto the South part.
               
                  The vſe of the head and tayle of the Dragon.
                  TThe vſe of the head and tayle of the Dragon, is to know, when that there is any eclipſe of the Sunne or Mone: and of what quantitie or greatneſſe the eclipſe is.
               
            
            
               26. VVhat Nauigation is.
               NAuigation is this, how to direct his courſe in the Sea to any place aſſigned, and to conſider in that direction what things may ſtande with him, & what things may ſtand againſt him, hauing conſideration how to preſerue the ſhip in all ſtormes and chaunges of weather that may happen by the way, to bring the ſhip ſafe vnto the port aſſigned, and in the ſhorteſt time.
               
                  The vſe of Nauigation.
                  THe vſe thereof is this, fyrſte too knowe howe that the place dothe beare from him, by what winde or poynte of the compaſſe, and alſo how farre that the place is from hym, and alſo to conſider the ſtreame, or tide gates, Currents, which way that they do ſet or driue the ſhip, and alſo to conſider what daungers is by the waye, as rockes and ſandes, and ſuche other lyke impedimentes, and alſo if that the wynde chaunge or ſhifte by the waye, to

conſider which way to ſtand, and direct his courſe vnto the moſt aduantage to attayne vnto the port in ſhorteſt time: and alſo if anye ſtormes doe happen by the way, to conſider how for to preſerue the ſhippe and the goodes, and too bring hir ſafe vnto the porte aſſygned. And alſo it is moſte principally to be conſidered and foreſéene, that if they haue hadde by occaſion of a contrarye tempeſt, for too goe very muche out of the courſe or way, too knowe then howe that the place dothe then beare, that is to ſay, by what poynte of the compaſſe the place dothe ſtande from you: and alſo how farre it may be from you. Whyche way to bée knowne is this: firſte to conſider by what poynte that the ſhippe hath made hir way by, and how faſt and ſwiftly that the ſhippe hathe gone, and to conſider how often that the ſhippe hathe altered hir courſe, and how muche that ſhe hathe gone at euery tyme, and then to conſider all thys in youre platte or carde, and ſo you may gyue an néere geſſe, by what poynte or wynde it beareth from you, and alſo howe farre it is thither. And alſo you may haue a greate helpe by the Sunne or Starres, to take the heigthe of the Pole aboue the horizon, and alſo in ſome place you may geſſe by the ſounding, bothe by the depth, and alſo by the grounde. And alſo it is verye meete and neceſſarye to knowe any place, when that hée dothe ſée it.
               
            
            
               27. Of inſtrumentes to vſe at the Sea for to take he heigthe of the Sunne or any Starres.
               ALl inſtrumentes too take the heighte of the Sunne or anye Starre, the originall of the making thereof, it is eyther a circle or the parte of a circle, whoſe diuiſion is the .360. parte of a circle, what forme ſoeuer that it hathe, as your croſſe ſtaffe, it is marked according vnto the proportion of a circle, and euery one of the

degrées, is the equall parte of a circle, the thrée hundred and ſixtie part. &c.
               
                  The vſe of the Inſtruments.
                  THe vſe of the Inſtrumentes, as Aſtrolobes or common Kings, or the croſſe ſtaffe, is to take the heigth of the ſūne or other ſtars, whoſe vſes doe folow héere after in the boke.
               
            
            
               28. VVhat maner of perſons be meeteſt to take charge of Shippes in Nauigation.
               AS touching thoſe perſons that are méete to take charge, that is to ſay, to be as maiſter of ſhips in Nauigation, he ought to be ſober and wiſe, and not to be light or raſh headed, nor to be to fumiſh or haſty, but ſuch a one as can wel gouern himſelfe, for elſe it is not poſſible for him to gouerne his cō
                  pany well: he ought not to be to ſimple, but he muſt be ſuche a one as muſt kéepe his companie in awe of him (by diſcretion,) doing his companie no iniurie or wrong, but to let thē haue that whiche men ought to haue, and then to ſée vnto them that they doe their laboure as men ought to doe in all points. And the principall point in gouernment is, to cauſe himſelf both to be feared & loued, & that groweth principally by this meanes, to cheriſhe men in well doing, and thoſe men that be honeſtly addicted, to let them haue reaſonable preheminence, ſo that it be not hurtfull vnto the Marchaunt nor to himſelfe, and to puniſhe thoſe that be malefactors and diſturbers of their company, and for ſmal faults, to giue them gentle admonition to amende them: and principally theſe two pointes are to be foreſeene by the maiſters, (that is) to ſerue God himſelfe, and to ſee that all the whole companie do ſo in like maner, at ſuche conuenient time as it is meete to be done: the ſecond point is, that the maſter vſe no play at the diſe or cards, neither (as near as he cā) to ſuffer any, for ye ſufferance therof may do very much hurt in diuers reſpects: And furthermore, the maiſter ought to be ſuche a one, as

dothe knowe the Moones courſe, whereby he doth knowe at what time it is a full Sea, or a lowe water, knowing in what quarter or part of the ſkye, that the Moone doth make a full Sea at that place, and alſo the maſter ought to bée acquainted, or knowe that place well, that he doth take charge to goe vnto (except that he haue a Pilot) and alſo he that taketh charge vpon him, ought to be expert, how the tydegates or currentes doe ſet from place vnto place: and alſo not to bée ignorant of ſuch daungers as lyeth by the way, as rocks, ſandes, or bankes, and alſo moſt principally he ought to bée ſuche a one, as can very well directe his courſes vnto any place aſſigned, and to haue capacitie howe for to handle or ſhift himſelfe in foule weather or ſtormes. And alſo it behoueth him too be a good coaſter, that is to ſay, to knowe euery place by the ſight thereof. And alſo he that taketh charge for long voyages, ought to haue knowledge in plats or cardes, and alſo in ſuch inſtruments as be meet to take the heigth of the Sunne or any Starre, and to haue capacitie to correcte thoſe inſtrumentes, and alſo he ought to be ſuche a one, that can calculate the Sunnes declination, or elſe to haue ſome true regiment, and alſo he ought to knowe howe to handle the Sunnes declination, when that he hath taken the heigth of the Sunne.
            
         
         
            
            ¶Nowe beginneth the Regiment for the Sea, the firſt Chapter or rule of Nauigation, and ſheweth what the .32. pointes of the Compaſſe is, and to what vſes they do ſerue.
            
               THe firſt & moſt principall thing for any ſeafaring mā or traueller, is to know toward what part of the Earth he meaneth to go, & then being vpō the ſea, ther he ſeeth no path nor mark to trauell by, but only the vſe of the Needle or compaſſe. And to ſhewe the cauſe how they in olde time did finde them or called them, is ſufficiently declared by other, but this is to be noted:8. Capitall or head pointes. There be eight capitall or head windes or poyntes, and foure of them haue their names properly of themſelues, and the other foure of them, are deriued, or take their names of the other foure, as this, South commeth directly from the Meridian, and North is directly againſte it, and Eaſt commeth from the Equinoctiall poynte, towardes the partes of the Sunne ryſing, and Weaſt is right againſt it, Northeaſt is in the midway betwéene the Eaſte and the North, and Southeaſt in the midway betweent the Eaſt and the South, and Southweſt betwéene the Weaſt and the South, and Northweaſt in the middle betweene the North and the Weaſt.8. Inferior pointes or winds. And then there be eight inferior points, or winds, halfe way betweene euery one of thoſe .8. capitall or head poynts or wynds, and that is Northe Northeaſt, Eaſt Northeaſt, Eaſt Southeaſt, and Southe Southeaſte, and South Southweaſt, and Weaſte Southweaſte, and Weaſte Northweaſte, and Northe Northweaſte: and nowe betweene euerie one of theſe inferioure poyntes, and euerye one of the heade wyndes

there is a by poynt or winde, and he is called a by point, for that he is not named but by the name of one of the head
                  •
                points next adioyning.16. by pointes or windes. There be .16. of them in nūber, ſo that there be .8. capitall or head points, and .8. inferior points, and 16. by pointes or windes, ſo that in all there be .32. of them. The vſe of theſe points is, to direct the ſhippe to what quarter of the world you do aſſigne, to keepe that courſe to find the place ſo aſſygned, for that the propertie of the Needle or Flye, is alwayes to ſtand due South and North.
            
            As touching Nauigation, for the inſtructions of the meaneſt I haue ſet this figure or compaſſe, where firſt is to be noted the .32. winds and poynts of the compaſſe aboue made.

Furthermore, the .32. pointes containe .24. houres, that is to ſay, one point containeth .3. quarters of an hour .45. minutes: and .2. pointes one houre and a halfe .4. pointes .3. houres:The .32. pointes brought into .24. houres. 8. poyntes .6. houres .12. poyntes .9. houres .16. poyntes .12. houres, and ſo to the reſt of the poyntes.

            ¶The ſecond Chapter or rule treateth of the Golden number or Prime, ſhewing the Epacte, and by the Epacte to knowe the Age of the Moone.
            IT is neceſſary and conuenient for the Seafaring men, to knowe the Prime or Golden number: for by the Golden number is knowne the Epacte, and the Epacte ſheweth the age of the Moone or chaunge day, within .12. houres vnder or ouer: and by the age of the Moone, you may know at what a clocke it doth flowe in any place that you doe knowe what Moone doth make a full Sea: therefore it is méete too know the Epacte, and that is knowne by the Pryme, or Golden number.The cauſe why that it was called the Pryme or Golden number. The cauſe why it was called the Golden number, was bycauſe it was ſent out of Egypte in letters of golde, too the Romaines or Citie of Rome. The cauſe why that it is called the Pryme, was for that it was the firſt order that the Moones courſe was known by, and it is thus knowne. Adde one to the yeare of our Lord that you would knowe the Golden number or Pryme of, then deuide the number by .19. the remainer is the Pryme:To knowe howe many the Epact is. and multiply that by .11. and looke what the number commeth vnto, deuide that by .30. the remayner is the Epact. Then when you haue once the Epact, adde .11. to your Epact for euery yere more, and looke what that commeth to, that is your Epact: and if it do paſſe .30. put that away, and keepe the remainer for your Epact. And thus this rule will ſerue for euer, ſauing when the Pryme beginneth at one, for then the Epacte is .11. and then doe (as aforeſayde) as you may perceyue by this table héere following.

            THe Prime or Golden number, is the time of .19. yeares, in the which time the Moone maketh all hir chaunges or coniunctions with the Sunne, and when all theſe .19. yeares be expired, then ſhe beginneth againe: as for example.The pryme is the time of .19. yeres This yeare being the yeare of our Lord .1574. ſhe chaunged the .22. day of March, and euery yere doth alter .11. days of hir change till the yere .1593. and then ſhe chaungeth the ſayd .22. daye of March againe, as I ſhewed you before. The Epacte is the putting to .11. for euery yeare. Nowe furthermore to knowe the age of the Moone, do thus: take the number of the Epact for your yere (beginning at March alwayes) and recken how many monthes it is from March, (counting March for one)

then recken howe many dayes of the moneth it is in whiche you would knowe the age of the Moone:To knowe the age of the Moone by the number of the Epact. Then put all your numbers togither, (that is to ſay, your Epacte, your moneth from March, and euery day of the moneth,) then looke howe many it amounteth vnto, that is the age of the Moone, but if it paſſe .30. throwe all the .30. away, and kéepe that that will not be .30. for when the age of the Moone is iuſt .30. then is it the chaunge daye: and if it be the fiftéenth daye of the age of the Moone, then the Moone is at the full. When the age is betwéene ſeuen dayes and eight, then is the firſt quarter. And if it be .xxij. dayes olde, then the Moone is at the laſte quarter: as for example, this yeare .1574. I looke and finde the Epacte .7. for the yeare, nowe I woulde knowe the age of the Moone, the .13. daye of Iune. Nowe I recken how many monthes it is from March, reckning March for one, and I finde it is foure monethes, then I take and adde all theſe togyther, that is to ſay, ſeuen for the Epacte, and foure for the monethes (that is to ſay, March, Aprill, May, Iune) and then .13. for the dayes of the moneth, and all commeth to .24. So that you may conclude that the Moone is .24. days olde, and was at the laſt quarter two dayes before.
         
         
            ¶The thirde Chapter or rule treateth, hovv to knovv by the age of the Moone what houre it dothe flowe, or is full Sea at any place, where you doe knowe what Moone maketh a full Sea.
            NOwe by the age of the Moone you may knowe at what houre it floweth in any place, where you do know what Moone maketh a full Sea, whiche rule commonly the Sea men cal the ſhifting their Sunne and Moone: and many wayes there be too doe it, for thus they may doe it: Let them

deuide one houre into .5. parts, and thē take .4. of thoſe parts, and put the fifth part away,To knowe the alteration of the

                  ides in .24 houres. that ſerueth for the alteration of 24. houres, & the foure fift parts of an houre, are .48. minuts, and the .5. part of an houre is .12. minuts. A floud and an ebbe, dothe alter .24. minuts forwards: as this for example: it floweth at .12. of the clocke at the Lands end vpon the chaunge day, the Moone being in the South: at all times a full Sea▪ The Moone being one day old, it floweth at .12. of the clocke. 48. minuts .2. dayes olde it floweth at one of the clock .36. minuts .3. days old it floweth at .2. of the clock .24. minuts: four dayes old it floweth at .3. of the clocke .12. minuts: fiue dayes old, it floweth at .4. of the clocke iuſt: Sixe dayes old, it floweth at .4. of the clocke .48. minuts: Seuen dayes old at .5. of the clocke .36. minuts:An enſample for the full Sea vppon the

For the courſe of the tides is nothing elſe but to adde for euery day
                  •
                of the age of the Moone one houre, pulling backe the fifth par

Now furthermore the Seamen vſe to make their accompt by this meanes (but it is all one) they do allow for euery day of the age of the Moone, one point and .3 minuts: for a point of the compaſſe conteineth. 45. minuts that is .3. quarters of an houre. Then they put .3. minuts to .45. minuts, which maketh .48. minuts, the ſayd .3. minuts be the .15. part of a point, and from the chaunge to the full is .15. days, ſo that (the halfe compaſſe being .16. pointes) they breake the odde point into .15. partes, and that commeth

to .3. minuts, ſo that the alteration of the tides, for euery .24. houres, be .48. minuts, or ye 
               .4. fifth parts of an houre. Wherfore there ſhall follow a table of tides about certain places of this realme: for euery Moone conteineth .29. dayes .12. hours .44. minutes from chaunge to chaunge:
                  The contente of the numbre of dayes and houres in one moone: ye houres in euery mone be .708.44 minuts.
                  The contente of a year is .365 dayes .5. hours .55. Minuts. How the mooneths tooke their names.
                the whole contents of the houres of the Moone, be .708. houres, and .44. minuts. And there is in euery yeare .12. changes of the Moone: and the yeare conteineth .365. days .5. houres .55. minuts .13. ſeconds. Yet ſome do affirme to be adde .6. houres, but there lacketh .4. minuts .47. ſeconds in the tropicall yeare. Likewiſe in the yeare be .12. moneths agreable to the .12. Moones: the 12. Moones conteine but .354. dayes, ſo that there be .11. dais more in the yeare, than there be in the .12. moones. The yeare alſo is deuided into .12. moneths, which mooneths haue taken their names at the will and pleaſure of menne: as firſt Ianuary, was ſo called, of Ianus bycauſe of .2. heades, for the month of Ianuary beholdeth the end of the yeare paſt and the beginning of the yeare to come. February tooke his name of certaine romaine ſacrifices called Februa. March is ſo called of Mars, for Romulus ſo named it after his father. Aprill cōmes of Aperio, bycauſe that then the earth is opened. Maye of Maia, the mother of Mercury, Iune ſo called by preparing to the warre. Iuly of Iulius Ceſar, and Auguſtus of Auguſtus Ceſar for in that month he entred the cōſulſhip: then the reſt of the months toke their names of their numbre frō March. Now theſe .12. months which maketh the yeare, the Sunne dothe paſſe or go through the Zodiack called the .12. ſignes, which is the occaſion of the yeare, for this is to be noted, that the ſunne as I ſaide before, doth go by his naturall mouing in .365. days .5. houres .55. minuts .13. ſeconds,The Zodiack conteyneth .360. degrees. through the Zodiack, conteining .360. degrées, his courſe being againſte the 24. houres, going from the Weaſt into the Eaſt, againſt the courſe of primum mobile, or firſt mouer, being moued by the mighty prouidence of God,The moouing of .24. houres. which maketh the .24. houres: and ſo dothe all the ſeuen lights, or planets, (except) that it be in

their retrogratiō: but the Sunne and the Moone, be neuer retrograt, as the other .5. planets or lights be. And this is to be noted, that the Moone goeth faſter thā the Sunne, for ſhe goeth through the whole Zodiack in .27. dayes and .8. houres.The tyme that the Moone goeth thorow the .12. ſignes. Now in that ſame time the ſunne is remoued by his natural mouing from that place of the Zodiack neare .27. degrees: and then bycauſe that the Moone hath not found the Sunne ther, it is .2. dayes foure houres foure and forty minuts more before that the Moone ouertaketh the Sunne againe, ſo by that meanes it is .29. dayes twelue houres and .44. minuts betwéene the chaunge of the Moone and the next chaunge, one Moone with an other thorowe the yeare, although that the Moone may chaunge ſometime in leſſe time and ſometime in longer time, that is by the meanes of the .3.
               The .3. motions of the Moone. motions of the Moone, that is to ſay hir ſwift motion and hir midle motion and hir ſlow motion, whiche groweth by the meanes of the moones Auge or oppoſition thereof.Of Auge. The Moone being in Auge, goeth but little more than .12 degrees in .24. hours. And in the oppoſition of Auge néere .15. degrees in .24. hours, and in hir middle or equall motion .13. degrées .12. minuts. So this is the occaſion why ſometime the Moone may chaunge ſooner or be detracted longer than the time of .29. dayes .12.
               The cauſe why the Moone chaungeth rather or later. houres and 44. minutes. This point of Auge is mouable, and doth paſſe thorough the Zodiack in the time of .19. yeare: and it cauſeth ſometime the full of the Moone to happen ſooner and later. In like manner alſo the quarters of the Moone, with al the other aſpects that the Moone hath with the Sunne, or any other of the planets, according to the moones motion. In like maner (by the meanes of the .3. motions of the Moone) ſometime the Moone goeth more thā one point and .3 minuts in .24. hours,The mone goeth in .24 hours ſomtimes more degrees and ſometime fewer degrees. and ſometimes leſſe than one point and .3. minuts, as this for example: the Moone being in hir ſlow motiō, goeth but little more than .12. degrées in .24. hours, and then the Sunne in that time doth go one degree: and then is there but .11. degrees betwéene the Sunne and the Moone (that is but .44. minuts)

So that the Moone is not one point in .24. houres from the ſunne.The moue is not one point aſunder from the Sunne in .24. houres. But being in hir ſwift motion ſhe goeth néere .15. degrees in .24. houres, and the Sunne goeth one degree in that time: ſo that there is .14. degrees in .24. houres, betwéene the Moone and the Sunne, (that is .56. minuts) which is a pointe and .11. minuts .23. But notwithſtāding I would not wiſh the common Marriners to trouble themſelues with theſe matters,The mone is in .24. houres a point and .11. minuts aſunder frō the Sunne but to followe their accuſtomed order, to allowe for euery day of the age of the Moone, one pointe, and .3. minuts, &c. And thus muche haue I ſaid of the Moones motion: for that ſome Sea men will take vpon them to correct ye Almanacks as touching the chaunge and quarters of the Moone: holding this opinion, that euery Moone ought to be equal in the number of the dayes and houres: and the full moones to be iuſt the halfe contents. And the quarters in like manner, the iuſt .4. parte in days and hours,Error of Marriners ſo that ſome of them will take vpon them to tel (by the rule of the epact,) the true houre of the change, quarters and full of the Moone. Wherein they are notably deceiued. Againe, ſometime in the yeare you ſhall ſée the Moone rarer thā at ſome other time, as this for example: from Ianuary to Iune you ſhall ſée the Moone within .24. houres after the chaunge: bycauſe ſhe hath North declination of the Sunne, and maketh a bigger arche thā the Sunne. From Iuly to December you ſhall not ſée the Moone .3. dayes after the change: bicauſe hir declination is to the South part of the Sunne: but you may ſee hir in .24. houres, before hir chaunge. Now, the Sea men do imagin a prime day, which is the halfe quarter of the Moone, that is: when the Moone is thre days and .8 houres old, (the Moone being then .4. points to the Eaſtward of the Sunne, whiche is 3. houres) the ſame rule may they in like caſe obſerue when the Moone is paſte the full .3. days and .18. houres, and alſo in the middes of the quarters.

               The Moone South ſouthweſt: betwéene holy Iland and Tinemouth full Sea.
               It floweth betwéene Tinemouth and Flambrough head, Southweſt and Northeaſt Moone.
               It floweth betwéene Flambrough head and Bridlington in the bay: a South weſt and by Weſt Moone.
               The Moone in the Weſt Southweſt: betwéene Bridlington and Laurenas full Sea.
               It floweth betwéene Laurenas and Cromer all along the well: an Eaſt and Weſt Moone.

               It floweth at the Spittes and at the Sheue and al alongſt the Swinne: a South Moone.
               At the Weſt end of the Norre: a Southe and by Weſt Moone, full Sea.
               It floweth at Graueſend: a South Southweſt Moone.
               It floweth at London Bridge: a Southweſt Moone.
               It floweth at the North forlande: a South Southeaſt Moone, & ſo alongſt the coaſt till you come to Bechy. And in the ofton from the North forland to the South forland: it runneth halfe tide. And frō the South forland to the Nas:

the tide runneth halfe tyde halfe quarter. And from the Nas to the Fairely: it runneth halfe tide, and from Fairely to Beche: it runneth quarter tide vnder other.
               It floweth to the Weaſtward of Beche, a kenning: a Southeaſt and by South Moone.
               It floweth at Porteſmouth: a Southe and by Eaſt Moone.
               It floweth at S. Elens: a South Southeaſt Moone.
               It floweth on the Sea ſide of the Iland: a Southeaſt and by South Moone: and ſo on the Lande, and at the Needles, and runneth quarter tide in the oftonne.

               It floweth at Portland a Southeaſt Moone.
               It floweth from the Weaſte parte of Portlande, till you come vntoo Plymmouth: an Eaſt and Weaſt Moone.
               It floweth on the ſhoare from Plymmouth to the Lizard: a Weſt and by Southe Moone. And in the oftonne a Southeaſt Moone.
               It floweth at Mountes baye: an Eaſt and Weaſte Moone.
               It floweth at Selly: a Weſt and by South Moone.
               It floweth at the Landes ende of Goolfe: a Weſt Southweſt Moone.
               It floweth all alongſt the coaſt vp to Briſtowe, and the coaſt of Ireland, from Waterford to Kinſale: a Weſt and by South Moone.
               Furthermore it floweth (for the moſt part) from the poll head of Burdeaux all alongſt the coaſt of Biſkey, Galiza, Portingale, till you come to the ſtraightes of Maliga, a Southweſt and Northeaſt Moone.
               It floweth at Fluſhing: a Southweaſt and by Southe Moone.

               It floweth all alongeſt the coaſt of Flaunders, from the Wyldings to Calys: a Southe and by Eaſt Moone: and ſo runneth halfe a tide vnder the other.
               Nowe heere is one ſpeciall thyng too bée noted,It will now a point of the compaſſe more in ye ſpring tides than in the neap tides in a Riuer that hath any diſtance vnto the Sea. and that is thys: it floweth one poynte of the compaſſe more in the Spring ſtreames, than it doothe in any of the quarters of the Moone (ſo that it be a riuer where there is any indrafte, hauing diſtaunce from the Sea) when there is neyther rage of wyndes nor anye cauſe eyther too hinder or further the ſayde effect. As for example thus: it floweth at Graueſend at the chaunge of the Moone or full: a Southe Southweſt Moone. But in any of the quarters of the Moone it ſkante floweth a Southe and by Weſt Moone: and this is generally for euer.
            
         
         
            The fourth Chapter treateth of the Sunne & moones courſe in the Zodiack: and hovv you ſhall knovv vvhat houres the Moone ſhall riſe and ſet at: and at what poynte of the compaſſe: vvyth other neceſſarye thynges.
            FVrthermore the Sunne (by hys naturall moouing thoroughe the twelue Signes in the Zodiack,

in the yeare) dothe cauſe the heigth and loweneſſe of his declination: whiche is neceſſarie for the Seafaring men to knowe, in whiche declination they do take from equinoctiall to equinoctiall: and this is to be noted, that as the Sunne hathe declination, ſo in like manner hathe the Moone, for by hir declination, and the Sunne, is knowen the tyme of hir ſhyning or abiding aboue our horizon.To know how long the Mone ſhineth. The Sunne or Moone in the firſte minute of Aries do riſe Eaſt, and ſet Weſt, and ſhyne .12. houres. In the firſt minute of Taurus they riſe néere the Eaſte Northeaſt, and ſet néere the Weſt Northweſt, and ſhyne .14. houres. In the ſigne of Gemini: they riſe neere the Northeaſt and by Eaſt, and they ſet néere the Northweſt and by Weſt, and ſhyne .16. houres. In the ſigne of Cancer the firſte minute: they make their greateſt declination to the Northwards, and they riſe neer the Northeaſt, and ſet neere the Northweaſt and ſhyne néere .17. houres. In the fyrſte minute of Leo (diſcending towardes the equinoctiall,) as they dyd in Gemini. And in the ſigne of Virgo, as they dyd in Taurus. And in the firſte minute of Libra, equinoctiall: beginning South declination, as in Aries. And in the fyrſte minute of Scorpio: they riſe néere the Eaſte Southeaſt, and ſette néere the Weaſt Southweaſt, and ſhyne .10. houres. In the fyrſte minute of Sagittarius: they riſe neere the Southeaſt and by Eaſt, and ſet néere the Southweſt, and by weaſt, and ſhyne .8. houres. In the fyrſte minute of Capricornus, they haue their greateſt declinatiō to the South, and begin to returne to the equinoctiall, riſing neere the Southeaſt and ſetting néere the Southweſt, and ſhyne more than .7. houres. In the firſte minute of Aquarius: as in Sagittarius. In the firſte minuts of Piſces: as in Scorpio. Nowe by this rule you may knowe the riſing and ſetting of the Moone for euer: as thus: I haue ſhewed you before in the ſhifting of the Sunne and Moone, that for

euery day of the age of the Moone,To knowe what houre or point the Moone ryſeth or ſetteth. the Moone goeth Eaſtward one point & .3. minuts: in .2. days .2. points and .6. minuts. &c. Nowe when you liſt to knowe the very houre and time of hir riſing: Looke howe many dayes the Moone is olde, then put ſo many points, and ſo many .3. minutes, and looke what it amounteth vnto. Which for your better vnderſtanding, I will ſhew by example: and firſt of the Moones being South, by euery day of the age of the Moone. The Moone being one daye olde: is South at .12. of the clocke .48. minutes.To knowe what houre the Moone is South for euery day of the age of the Moone. The Moone being .2. dayes olde, is South at one of the clocke .36. minuts in the after noone. Three days old: South at 2. of the clock .24. minuts .4. days olde, at .3. of the clock .12. minutes .5. days olde: at .4. of the clock iuſt .6. days olde at .4. of the clock 48. minuts .7. days olde at .5 of the clock .36. minutes. When the Moone is iuſt a quarter old, ſhe is South at .6. of the clock at night. at .8. dayes olde: the Moone is South at .6. of the clocke .48. minutes. at .9. dayes olde at .7. of the clock .12. minutes. at .10 dayes olde: at .8. of the clocke iuſt. At .11. dayes olde at .8. of the clock .48. minutes. at .12. dayes olde at .9. of the clocke .36. minutes, at .13. dayes olde at .10. of the clock .24. minutes. at .14. dayes olde at .11. of the clocke .12. minutes. at .15. dayes olde (being the full Moone) ſhe is then South at midnight. One daye after the full Moone: ſhe is South at .12. of the clocke .48. minutes at midnight. Two dayes after the full: at one of the clocke .36. minutes. Three dayes after, at .2 of the clocke .24. minutes. Foure days after, at .3. of the clock 12. minutes. Fiue dayes after at .4. of the clocke, iuſt in the morning. Sixe dayes after, at .4. of the clock .48. minutes .7. dayes after, at .5. of the clocke .36. minutes. When the Moone is thrée quarters olds, ſhe is South at .6. of the clocke in the morning. At .8. dayes after the full (being the firſte daye after the quarter) at .6. of the clocke .24. minuts .9. days after: at 7. of the clocke .12 minutes .10. dayes after, at .8. of the clocke iuſt .11. dayes after, at .8. of the clocke .48. minutes .12. dayes after, South at .9. of the clocke, 36. minutes .13. dayes after,

South at .10. of the clocke in the forenoone .24. minutes .14. dayes after, at .11. of the clocke .12. minutes. at .15. dayes after the Moone dothe chaunge (being then with the Sunne) for the chaunge of the Moone is,Of the chaunge. when the Moone and the Sunne be bothe vnder one like degree and minute of any ſigne of the Zodiack.Of the full Moone. The full Moone is, when the Sunne and the Moone be oppoſite (the one being directly againſt the other, and iuſt .6. ſignes aſunder) as you maye perceiue at the full Moone: for then when the Moone ryſeth, the Sunne ſetteth: and when the ſunne ryſeth, the Moone ſetteth. The quarters be,Quarter of the Moon. Enſample of the moones ryſing & ſetting. when the Sunne and Moone be iuſt .3. ſignes aſunder (that is, iuſt .90. degrées.) Nowe when you liſt to knowe the very time of the Moones ryſing or ſetting, looke in your kalender what ſigne and degree the Moone is in: then according to the rule of the ſhining, deuide that into .2. equall partes, then from the South, ſo ſhall you ſee at what houre the Moone ryſeth, as for example this. In March alwayes the Sunne is in Aries, then the Moone being in hir firſt quarter, then ſhe is 6. hours to the Eaſtward of the Sunne, then the Moone muſt needs be in Cancer. Then ſhineth the Moone in our Horizon 17. houres, then the Moone is South at .6. of the clock, then ſhe ſhineth .8. houres and a halfe after .6. of the clock. So that ſhe ſetteth at .2. of the clock and halfe an houre paſt, then ſhe ryſeth in the day .8. houres and a half before .6. of the clock, that is at .9. of the clocke and halfe an houre paſt. Now at the laſt quarter in March, then the Moone muſte néedes be in Capricornus, then ſhineth the Moone but .7. houres, then the moone is South at .6. of the clock in the morning, then the Moone riſeth .3. houres and a halfe before, that is, at .2. of the clocke and halfe an houre paſte in the morning, then ſhe ſetteth by day at .9. of the clocke and halfe an houre paſte, and this rule will ſerue for euer without any great error. But yet there is a further matter for the exacte doing,The Mone hath latitude. which is the Latitude of the Moone from the heade or tayle of the Dragon, but that is but a trifle in reſpecte of muche error, and therefore I will

not trouble you with that: yet there is one thing whiche I would Seafaring men ſhould conſider, although a great nū
               be expert in that, yet it is méete to be ſpoken of, as this. The Sunne being in Cancer or Moone in like maner,You cannot know what a clock it is by the compaſſe, the Sun being in the north ſignes. or in Gemini, or any time when the Sunne or Moone hath North declination, they wil ſet their compaſſe before them, and when they ſee the Sunne giue an Eaſte ſhadowe, they will ſaye that it is .6. of the clock, which and if the Sunne be in Cancer, it is not muche paſte fiue of the clocke, and the more to the South wardes the more they doe erre. And in like caſe, the Moone being in Cancer when they doe ſée the Moone giue an Eaſt ſhadowe by their compaſſe, they will ſay the Moone is Weaſt, but they do not conſider that the Sunne and the Moone being in Cancer,
               Error of ye ſhadow of the Moon
                     •
                  
                commeth ſo neare our Zenithe or Verticall poynte right ouer our heade, whiche is the verie heigth of their declination comming ſo neare them, therfore they muſt iudge the Eaſt or Weaſt from the Pole or North ſtarre if they will iudge truely. Wherefore I do much commende the Equinoctiall Dyals for the exacte truth,The Equinoctiall dyals be very good. for they can not know the truth by their compaſſe, ſo that the Sunne or Moone or any other Starre haue any great declination being in Cancer: and you muſt conſider this in like manner. The Sunne hauing North declination, the further you doe goe to the North wardes, the longer is youre daye, and the ſhorter is your night, and towardes the Southward, the ſhorter dayes and longer nightes. Nowe contrarywiſe, the Sunne hauing South declination, the more to the Northwardes, the ſhorter dayes and the longer nightes, the further to the Southwards, the longer days and ſhorter nights,As touching the length and ſhortneſſe of the day and night. and vnder the Equinoctiall, the nightes and dayes all one what declination ſoeuer the Sunne hath: but this rule that I haue giuen you is for London, or any other place that hath that Latitude or eleuation of the Pole Articke at .51. or .52. degrées.
         
         
            
            ¶The fifth Chapter or rule, is of a table of declination commonly called of Seafaring men, a Regiment of the Sunne, exactly calculated for .4. yeres, and wil ſerue for .24. yeres, for euery day of the moneth.
            NOw ſhall folowe a table of declination or Regiment for 4. yeres, being calculated for England, and will ſerue all Europe without much error, or any other countrey or place that hath our Longitude, as the moſt part of Affrica, as Ginnie and thoſe partes to the South wards, as farre as the Antartick pole, ſeruing for euery day of the moneth, very neceſſarie for them that do vſe to trauell either by ſea or by land, and is one of the principall pointes in Nauigation for long voyages, and the cauſe why I haue written this Regiment for the Sea,Euery perſon cannot calculate ye Sunnes declination. or tables of declination, is for that I do knowe that euery perſon that goeth vnto the Sea as maiſter of a ſhippe, hath not capacitie to calculate the Sunnes declination by the place of the ſunne, although they haue the tables of declination, as the Ephemerides, or Martin Curtyſe, otherwiſe called the art of Nauigatiō. Wherfore I haue written theſe notes, & Regiment or table of declination for .4. yeres, and the firſt row towards your left hand, is the dayes of the moneth: the next rowe is the degrées of declination that the Sunne hath at the inſtant time of noone: and the thirde rowe is the odde minutes of declination belonging to the degrees. Nowe there be two times in the yere that the Sunne hath no declinatiō,Two times in the yeare the Sunne hath no declination. 1573. as this. For the firſt yere after Biſſextilis, (which was in ye yere of our Lord .1573. the .11. day of March, at .4 of ye clock in the morning) the Sun was vpō the Equinoctiall beginning North declination. And in like maner the 13. day of September at noone, the Sunne was vpon the Equinoctiall

beginning South declination, and alſo the ſecond yere after Biſſextilis, which is the yere of our Lorde .1574. the ſunne is vpon the Equinoctiall the .11. day of Marche, betwene 10. and .11. of the clocke before Noone, beginning North declination: and in like maner the .13. day of September, at .6. of the clocke in the after Noone, beginning South declination. Furthermore in the thirde yere after Biſſextilis, whiche is the yere of the Lorde .1575. the ſunne is vpon the Equinoctiall the 11. day of Marche, betwéene foure and fiue of the clocke in the after Noone, beginning North declination: & ſo in like maner the .13. day of September, at .12. of the clocke at midnighte, beginning South declination. Laſtly, in the yere of our Lorde 1576. that is the yere Biſſextilis it ſelfe vpon the .10. day of Marche the ſunne ſhall be vpon the Equinoctiall betwéene 10. and .11. of the clocke at night, beginning North declination: and in like maner the .13. day of September at .6 of the clocke in the morning, beginning South declination: Nowe theſe foure yeres béeing expired, you muſt after the yere of Biſſextilis, beginne agayne at the yere one, as héere dothe followe for example.

                  ¶The Balla Stella or Croſſe ſtaffe: to take the heigth of the Sunne or Starre.
               
            
            
               ¶The ſixt Chapter or rule shevveth, hovv to take the heigth of the Sun with the croſſe ſtaffe or with the Aſtrolobe, and alſo how to find the true Meridian, with other neceſſarie matters.
            TO take the true heigth of the Sunne at the Sea, the beſte way is, to doe it wyth the croſſe ſtaffe: for that the Sea is moueable, and cauſeth the Shippe to heaue, and ſette little or much: And alſo vpon the croſſe ſtaffe the degrees be larger marked than the King or Aſtrolobe: and in a large inſtrument an errour is ſeene ſooner and better than it is in a ſmall inſtrument.
            Nowe to take the heigth of the Sunne,How to obſerue ye ſun. to knowe thy Altitude of the Pole aboue the Horizon, doe this: Firſte ſet the Sunne with a compaſſe, to knowe when that the Sunne commeth neare vnto the Meridian: as ſoone as you ſee that the Sunne is come vnto the South and by Eaſt, then beginne to take the heigth of the Sunne with the croſſe ſtaffe in this manner: Put the Tranſitorie vpon the long ſtaffe, then ſet the end of the long ſtaffe cloſe at the corner of your eye,To take ye heigth of the Sunne with the croſſe ſtaffe. winking with your other eye, and remouing the Tranſitorie forwardes or backwardes, vntill you doe ſee the lower ende of it (being iuſt with the Horizon) and the vpper ende of it, (being iuſt with the middle of the Sunne) both to agree with the Sunne and the Horizon at one time: and ſo haue you the true heigth of the Sunne: this done, Stil obſerue ye ſame, vntil you ſee the Sunne at the higheſt and beginning to deſcende, and then haue you finiſhed.The cauſe why the croſſe ſtaffe] is beſt to take the heigth of the Sun vnto 50, degrees Yet notwithſtanding this is to be noted: that it is beſte to take the heigth of the Sunne with the croſſe ſtaffe, when the Sunne is vnder 50. degrées in heigthe aboue the Horizon, for two cauſes. The one is this: till the Sunne be .50. degrées in heigthe the degrees be largely marked vppon the croſſe ſtaffe,

but after (the Sunne being aboue .50. degrées high) they be leſſer marked. The other is, for that the Sunne being vnder 50. degrees in heigth, you may eaſily take the heigth, bycauſe you may eaſily ſée or viewe the vpper end and the nether end of the croſſtaffe bothe at one time: but if it dothe excéede .50. degrées, then by the meanes of caſting your eye vpwardes and downwardes ſo muche, you may ſoone commit error, and then in like manner the degrees be ſo ſmall marked, that if the Sunne dothe paſſe .50. or .60. degrees in heigth, you muſt leaue the croſſe ſtaffe and vſe the Mariners King, called by them the Aſtralaby, which they ought to call the Aſtrolobe.To take ye heigth of ye Sun with ye Aſtrolobe Nowe to take the heigth of the Sunne with the common King or Aſtrolobe, doe thus: The Sunne being (as before is declared) neare the Meridian or South, obſerue it (vntill you haue the greateſt heygth thereof) in this manner: Holde the King of the Aſtrolobe vpon one of your fingers,Howe to correct your Aſtrolobe if it dothe nor hang vpright. and turne the Alhidada vppe and downe, vntill you ſee the ſhadowe of the Sunne pearſe or paſſe thorough bothe the ſightes thereof, being ſure that the Aſtrolobe dothe hang vpryght, whiche you may proue in this manner: Looke at howe many degrées and minutes the Alhidada dothe ſtande vppon the Aſtrolobe, then turne the Alhidada vnto the ſame number of the degrées and minutes on the other ſide of the Aſtrolobe, and then taking the heigth of the Sunne againe, if it doe agree as it did before, then the Aſtrolobe dothe hang vpright: but if it doe not, then it dothe not hang vpright. For knowledge of the true heigth of the Sun (the Aſtrolobe not hanging vpright) do thus: if the Aſtrolobe be truely marked, marke the diuerſitie, that being knowne, rebate from the greateſt heigth halfe the diuerſitie, or elſe adde vnto the leſſer heigth halfe the diuerſitie, and that ſhall be the true heigth of the Sunne, although that the Aſtrolobe doth not hang vpright.
            
               
                  The Aſtrolobe is beſt to take the heigth of the Sunne at .60.70. or .80. degrees in heigth. How to preſerue your eyes when you touch the Sunne with the croſſe ſtaffe and haue no glaſſes.
                  The diameter of the Sunne is 30. or .31. minuts.
               The Aſtrolobe is beſt to take the heigth of the Sun, if the Sunne be very high at .60.70. or .80. degrées, and the cauſe is

this: the Sunne comming ſo néere vnto your Zenith, hathe great power of light, for to pearce the .2. ſights of the Alhidada of the Aſtrolobe, and then it is not good to vſe the croſſe ſtaffe, for that the Sunne hurteth the eyes of a man, and beſides that it is to high to occupy the croſſe ſtaffe, (as before is declared) ſo that this way you may very much preſerue your eyes. If you haue not glaſſes vpon your ſtaffe (to ſaue your eyes in taking the heigth of the Sunne) but be vnprouided of them, do thus: take and couer the Sunne with the end of the tranſitorie of the croſſe ſtaffe, vnto the very vpper edge or brinke of the Sunne (ſo ſhall you not néede to beholde the brightneſſe of it) and with the other end of the tranſitorie to take the horizon truely, and that being done, for that the Sunne is .30. or .31. minuts in diameter or bredth, therefore you ſhall rebate .15. minutes from the altitude or heigthe of the Sunne, and then that whiche ſhall remaine ſhall be the true heigth of the Sunne from the center or middle of the Sunne. And furthermore there is ſome error in the taking the Sunne or Starre with the Ballaſtel or croſſe ſtaffe, and that groweth by this meanes: for that the true center (which is the ſight of the eye) is within in the middle of the eye,Some error in the croſſe ſtaffe and how to reforme it. and not in the outſide of the eye: ſo that the end of the long ſtaffe in the ſetting of it vnto the corner of your eye, dothe ſtande ſomewhat further out than the ſight of your eye, that is too ſaye, that the ſighte of the eye is ſomewhat further into the head, than the ende of the ſtaffe dothe come: wherefore you muſt pare away a little of the ende of the ſtaffe, for ſome mens vſes more, and ſome mens vſes leſſe, for that it is according as you may ſet the ſtaffe vnto your eye, for ſome mē neede pare away little or nothing, and ſome men muſt pare away .14. or .15. minutes as you may ſet the ſtaffe: bycauſe ſome mens eyes be further into their head than other ſome mens are, and the bones of ſome mens face ſtand further out than other ſome do. It is moreouer conuenient to know the true meridian, or South, whiche you muſt do, either with a

good compaſſe or with a perfyte diall or Néedel:To get the true Meridian vpon the Land. but if you be on the land this you may do: on a péece of timber, or any other thing that ſtandeth faſt, with a paire of compaſſes make a circle, then in the midle or center where the foote of the compaſſe did ſtand ſet a wire vpright (as circumſpectly as you can) and then you may do this: looke in the morning (ſo it be on plaine ground that you may ſée the horizon circle, without any let) at the Sunne riſing, for the ſhadow of the wier, and there ſet a pricke: then at the ſetting of the Sunne you ſhall ſet another pricke, euen at the circumference of the circle, then deuide that with your compaſſes euen in .2. peeces, and ſtrike a ſtraight line from the wier or center of the circle, to the middle or deuided prick, & that ſhal be true meridian. Or elſe (the wier ſtanding vpright) firſt in the fore noone when the top of the wier doth touch, or is ready to come into the circumference or edge of the circle, there make a pricke: then in the after noone in like manner, at the very comming out or touching of the wyer, of the edge of the circle, there make an other pricke euen with the comming out of the ſhadow: this done (as circumſpectly as you can) deuide theſe 2. prickes in the midle, then as before is ſaid, drawe a line frō the center or wier, to the midle pricke, and that ſhadow ſhal be your true meridian. After another manner you may doe this: looke and watch when the wyer giueth the ſhorteſt ſhadowe, and there make a pricke: then draw a line from that prick to the wyer, which ſhadow ſhall be the true meridian. And yet furthermore,To knowe the true Meridian at the Sea, and alſo (if your compas be varied) and to know how much they be varied. for yt it is moſt cōuenient to know ye true Meridian at the Sea, bicauſe in long viages going far vnto the Weſtward or Eaſtward, the compaſſe doth varie: to find the true Meridian do this. Set the Sunne with your compaſſe at hir riſing or appearing aboue ye horizon, & then (knowing what point & part the Sunne doth riſe at) ſet the Sun with your compas at hir ſetting or departing vnder ye horizō, & (that being known) you ſhal perfitly know, whether the compas be varied, & how much: for enſample this, I doe

ſet the Sun at hir riſing with the compas, & ſhe doth riſe vpō the Eaſt point: in like maner alſo I do ſet the Sun with hir compas at hir ſetting, & do find hir to ſet Weſt Northweſt: ſo I do ſée the compas to be varied one pointe, that is to ſay, the North point doth ſtand North and by Eaſt. &c. And furthermore (for that ſeldome times the Sun dothe riſe and ſet cleere by the meanes of the cloudes, and other impediments néere the horizon) you may get the true Meridian thus: at any time in the fore noone, firſt ſet the Sunne with your compas, and then take the true heigth of the Sunne. Now you (knowing how many degrées ye Sun was high at that point of the compas) may in like maner obſerue the Sunne in the afternoone, vntill you do find the Sun iuſt at that heigth that it was in the forenoone, marking at what point of the compas the Sunne is, and ſo ſhall you ſee perfitely whether the compas be varied or no, and alſo howe much: for enſample thus: I take the Sun vpon the Southeſt poynt .20. degrees aboue the horiſon, & then in the after noone I do obſerue the Sun vntil ſuch time as I do find the Sunne iuſt .20. degrées aboue the horizon again, & then I ſet ye Sun with the compas and do find ye Sun to be at .20. degrées in heigth weſt Southweſt, ſo that I ſee ye compas to be varied one point, yt is to ſay the North point doth ſtand North & by Eaſt. &c. Another way alſo to know ye true meridian, is by the Sun: that is, to ſet ye Sun with ye cōpas at hir greateſt heigth aboue the horizon, & ſo you ſhall know whither yt cōpas be varied, & how much: & looke what is ſpokē of ye Sun by day, you may do the like by night by any of the Starres yt you perfectly do know,To find the variation of the compas in the night by ye Starres but not by the Moone▪
                doing as you do by ye Sun in all points: but you cannot do it ſo well and truly by the Moone, by the meanes of the ſwiftneſſe of ye moones motiō in the Zodiack, you may alſo find the variatiō of ye cōpas by the North Starre, as thus: ſet ye North Star with the compas, if the North point do ſtande right with the Starre, then it is not varied, but if it dothe not ſtande ryghte wyth the Starre, then it is varied: and that muſt

be done when the .2. Starres of Charles Waine called the pointes be right vnder, or right ouer the North Star, but if that the Starres be Weſt from the North Starre, then the North Starre is the third part of a point vnto the Eaſtward of the North pole. If the .2. Starres of Charles Wayne called the poynters be due eaſt from the North Starre, then the North Starre is the third part of a point vnto the weſtwarde of the North pole .&c. This haue I ſaide bycauſe that ſometime in ſundry places, the compaſſe doth varie, & eſpecially in the ſayling of long viages running Eaſt and Weſt,Medell not with your compaſſe al though it be varied. (called the Northeaſting or Northweſting of the compaſſe) therefore I would not wiſh them to meddle with the mending of their compaſſe or whetting of the ſide of the néedell to the end to make it to ſtand due North, but circumſpectly to awaite the altering of the compaſſe, and what quantitie it doth alter: as you may do very well, by the order before reherſed, and then let your compaſſe alone: for although that it dothe varie .2. or .3. poynts,To ſaile by the compas that is varied. you may make account according to the variation as thus: I admit the Northweſt point ſtandeth due North, and my courſe is to go due Weſt, I will occupy the Southweſt pointe in this caſe for the weſt poynte. And thus (by obſeruation and trying of my compaſſe) I care not what point ſtandeth due North, for it is all one, ſo that you conſider what poynt ſtandeth North. And now furthermore, ſome are of that opinion, that (by the Northeaſting or Northweſting of the compaſſe) you may knowe the Longitude: but I am not of that opinion, for I admit that it be ſo (as ſome do affirme) that the compaſſe doth varie, (as ſome haue ſaid) that is,As touching Longitude to be found by the Northeaſting or Northweſting of the compaſſe. that you being .90. degrées vnto the Weſtwarde (from the place youre compaſſe was made at) youre North poynt ſhould ſtand Northeaſt: and in like maner you being .90. degrees Eaſt, your North poynt ſhould ſtand Norweſt: then by that order the compaſſe ſhould vary one poynt at .22. degrées and a halfe, and that commeth vnto .450. engliſh leagues (if you be néere vnto the equinoctial:) wherefore

no maſter or pilotte of a ſhippe, doth kéepe ſo ſimple account of the ſhippes way, but that he may knowe what diſtaunce he hath vnto any place better than he ſhal know by the variing of the compas: & alſo whether it be ſo or not yt the cōpas doth keepe any ſuch proportion in the variatiō, I do refer that vnto them that haue tried the experience therof: for I for my part can ſay nothing in that matter. Wherfore I ceaſe from writing muche thereof, althoughe the Sea men be very deſirous to haue ſome way to get the Longitude. But if it be true that the compaſſe doth varie by that proportion, then it were very good for them to practiſe that matter that ſhoulde make any diſcouery vnto the Northwardes, for that the degrees be ſo ſhort in thoſe Paralels.
         
         
            The ſeuenth Chapter sheweth how to handle the declination of the Sunne, to knovve the altitude of the North pole aboue the horizon, (the heigth of the Sunne being truely taken and knowen in any place betweene the North pole and the Equinoctiall) ſo that the Sunne be vnto the Southwards of you, at the taking of the Sunne vppon the Meridian.
            YOu muſt conſider by the regiment or table of declination (going before) that the .11. day of Marche the Sunne is equinoctiall entring then the firſte point of Aries (called the equinoctiall of ſpring time) where ſhe hath no declination. The .10. day of Aprill the Sunne entreth into the firſte minute of Taurus, then hauing declination to the Northwards. 11. degrées .30. minuts. The .12. day of May, the Sunne entreth the firſt poynte of Gemini, hauing then declination .20.
               The greateſt declination of the Sunne. degrees .12. minuts. The .12. day of Iune the Sunne entreth into Cancer, where he (making his greateſt progreſſe to the

Northwards) hath .23. degrées .28. minuts of declination. But now in this our time, ſome do affirme it to be .23. degrées and a halfe, but it lacketh .2. minuts. The .14. day of Iulie, the Sunne entreth into Leo comming dounwards to the Equinoctiall, hauing .20. degrées .12. minutes of declination. The 14. day of Auguſt the Sunne entreth into Virgo, hauing declination .11. degrees .30. minutes. The .14. of September, the Sunne entreth into Libra, (then being Equinoctiall, and hauing no declination) whiche is called the Equinoctiall of Autumne or harueſt,Equinoctiall of Autumne. where he beginneth his South declination. The .14. of October the Sun entreth into Scorpio, where his declination is .11. degrees .30. minutes. The .12. of Nouember the Sun entreth into Sagittarius, his declination being .20. degrées .12. minutes. The .12. day of December, the Sunne entreth the firſte minute of Capricorne, where the Sunne (making greateſt progreſſe to the Southwards) hath of declination .23. degrees and .28. minutes. From whence he retourneth to the equinoctiall againe.The greateſt declination to the South. The .11. of Ianuary the Sunne entreth into Aquarius, where his declination is 20. degrees .12. minutes. The .10. day of February the Sunne entreth into the firſt minute of Piſces, and hath of declination .11. degrees .30. minutes. The .11. day of March, the Sunne retourneth to the ſelfe ſame place that it departed from before, wherefore the Egyptians did paint the yeare like to an adder biting hir tayle,The yeare is compared vnto a ring or an adder biting his tayle. and (not hauing the vſe of letters) they made a ring and named it annulus, as it were annus, that is to ſaye a yeare: bycauſe a ring dothe turne rounde in it ſelfe as dothe the yeare. The heigth of the Sunne béeing knowen, you (knowing the day of the mooneth, and what yeare it is after the Biſſextilis) muſt turne to the day of the mooneth, in the regiment or table going before, where right againſte the day of the mooneth you ſhall find the degrées of declination and the odde minuts belonging to the degrées of declination following: that being knowen (that is to ſay, the heigth of the Sun with the degrées and minutes of the declination)

if the Sunne haue North declination,The heigth of the Sun being taken and knowē then how to handle the declinatiō to know the heigth of the pole. you ſhall ſubtract or take away the Sunnes declination from the heigth of the Sunne, with the degrees and minutes: and then that which remaineth ſhall be the true heigth of the Equinoctiall whiche being knowen, pulling that ſūme out of .90. with the degrees and minuts, that whiche dothe remaine ſhall be the true heigth of the North pole aboue the horizon. But if that the Sunne hathe South declination, you ſhall adde or put that declination vnto the heigth of the Sunne, whiche ſhall ſhewe vnto you the true heigth of the Equinoctiall: of the which ſūme (being taken from .90.) that which doth remain ſhall be the altitude of the North pole aboue the horizon. For this is to be noted: looke what heigth the Equinoctiall is aboue the horizon, it is equall or iuſt ſo much betweene the Zenith or verticall point and the North pole. In like maner: looke how many degrées and minutes are betwéene the Equinoctiall and your Zenith, iuſt that number of degrées and minuts is from the North pole, downe to the horizon,Things to be noted as touching the taking of the altitude of the pole. which is the cauſe that you muſt pull the heigth of the Equinoctial, from the horizon with the degrees and minutes. For that your Zenith is alwayes .90. degrées from the horizon as you ſée by this figure.
            
               
            
         
         
            
            The .8. Chapter sheweth you how to handle the declination of the Sunne, when you are betweene the Equinoctiall and the Sunne: that is to ſay, the Sunne being to the Southwards or Northwards of you and the Equinoctial, or vnder the Equinoctiall: the heigth of the Sunne being truely knowen or taken.
            NOw furthermore if you be vnto the South parts neare vnto the equinoctiall, ſo that the Sunne haue any great declination either to the Southwards or ye Northwards, you being between the equinoctial and the Sunne, whē you haue taken the true heigth of the Sun with ye Aſtrolobe, to know the heigth of any of the .2. poles do this: ſéeke the declination of the Sun for that day with the degrées & minuts, the declinatiō being known & the heigth of the Sunne in like maner, then adde ye declinatiō of the Sun vnto the heigth thereof, & it will exceede or be more than .90. degrées, then againe looke how many degrees it is more thā .90. with degrées & minuts,A thing to be noted. that ſhal be the true heigth of the pole towards that ſide that the Sun is: bycauſe ye Equinoctial is ye number of degrées aboue .90. (which is your Zenith) to the contrary part frō the Sunwards. For (as I haue ſaid in ye chapter going before & is general for euer) looke what heigth ſoeuer ye Equinoctial be frō ye horizō, that is the true diſtance betwéene ye Zenith and the pole: in like maner looke what diſtance is betwéene the Equinoctial & the Zenith, ye ſame is the true diſtāce betwen the horizon & the pole, that is to ſay, the pole is ſo many degrées in altitude aboue ye horizō. As it is a cōmon ſaying (in knowing how farre we be vnto the Southwards or Northwards) yt the pole artick is ſo many degrées in altitude, or (as ſom wil ſay) that we are in ſo many degrées in Latitude:Altitude or Latitude is all one queſtion in effect. the queſtion is all one in effect, although the one be called Altitude or heigthe, and the other Latitude or wideneſſe, yet it hathe one ſignification: for as when you ſay altitude or

heigth of the Pole, you meane the Pole is rayſed ſo many degrees aboue the Horizon. So likewiſe when you ſay Latitude, you mean you be ſo many degrees in wideneſſe frō the Equinoctiall: for that your Zenith or verticall pointe is ſo many degrées frō the Equinoct. Moreouer if you chaunce to be right vnder ye Equinoctial, as you cānot ſay that you haue any Latitude,Being vnder the Equinoctiall you haue neither Latitude nor altitude, for that the Equinoctiall is your Zenith and the Poles your Horizon. ſo likewiſe cannot you ſay that you haue any Altitude, for that the two Poles be then iuſt with your Horizon, and in like maner the Equinoctiall is your Zenith or Verticall poynte. But when you will take the heigth of the Sunne with your Aſtrolobe, then looke what declination the Sunne hath, either to the Southwardes or Northwardes. Then put the declination of the Sunne vnto the heigthe of the ſame, and the number will be iuſt .90. degrées: if it lacketh any thing of .90. degrées, then it ſignifieth that the Equinoctiall lacketh ſo much of the Zenith, and ſo muche iuſt ſhal the pole be aboue ye Horizon towards that part that you be in from the Sunne wardes. But contrarywiſe, if it dothe excéede or be any thing more than .90. degrées, then (as afore is declared) it ſignifieth that the Equinoctiall is as much as that number (both in degrées and minutes.Of your zenith being betweene ye Equinoctiall and the Sunne.) On the contrary ſide, from the Sunne wardes, that is to ſay, your Zenithe ſhal be betwéene the Sunne and the Equinoctial, & the Pole ſhall be ſo many degrees or minutes aboue the Horizon, as is the diſtaunce betwéene the Zenith and the Equinoctiall, towardes that part or ſide that the Sunne is on. Wherefore I do think it neceſſarie to giue certaine enſamples (and firſt take this for an enſample.An enſāple.) Admit I doe take the heigth of the Sunne vnto the Northwards .80. degrées aboue the Horizon, and the Sunne hathe declination vnto the Northwardes .20. degrées, to which I adde or put the heigth, that is to ſay .80. degrées (being the heigth of the Sunne) and .20. degrees (being the declination of the Sunne) doe make .100. frō which I pull .90. away (which is my Zenith) and ſo ther remayneth .10. degrées. Wherefore you may conclude that the

Equinoctiall is .10. degrées to the South parte of youre Zenith,An enſāple where the pole is .10. degrees aboue the Horizon. and the Sunne to be .10. degrées to the North parte of your Zenith, ſo that the North Pole is .10. degrées aboue the Horizon, as by this example it is declared.
            
            And for the ſecond enſample, admit I take the Sunne vnto the Northwardes .75. degrees and .20. minutes aboue the Horizon, the Sunne hauing North declination .14. degrées 40. minutes, I then do adde or put .14. degrées .40. minutes vnto .75. degrées .20. minuts, and thoſe .2. ioyned togither maketh .9
                  •
               . degrées, whereof you may conclude that the Equinoctiall is your Zenith, and then the .2. Poles be with your Horizon, as by this example it doth appeare.
            
            And now followeth the .3. enſample. I admit the Sunne be taken with the Aſtrolobe .81. degrees and .15. minutes aboue the horizon, and the ſame hathe South declination .22.

degrées .35. minutes,An enſāple. wherefore I do adde or put togither .81. degrées and .15. minutes (being the heigth of the Sunne) and 22. degrées .35. minutes (being the declination) and that maketh .103. degrees .50. minutes: from which I take away .90. degrées (which is my Zenith) ſo that there remayneth .13. degrees .50. minutes: ſo that you may ſafely conclude that the Equinoctiall is .13. degrées .50. minutes vnto the North parts of the Zenith, and then it muſt néedes follow that the South pole is .13. degrees .50. minuts aboue the Horizon, as by thys enſample it is declared.
            
         
         
            The nynth Chapter sheweth how to handle the declination of the Sunne, vvhen you are beyond the Equinoctiall, that is to ſay, betweene the South pole and the Equinoctiall: with certaine enſamples both for the South pole and the North pole.
            ANd furthermore if you be vnto ye Southwards beyond ye Equinoctial, as betwéen ye tropick of Capricorne & ye South pole, then to vſe the declination of ye Sun to know ye heigth of the South pole or antartick pole by the heigth of the Sun,

there is no other matter in the doing thereof,To take ye Sun to the Northwardes you being betweene the ſouth Pole and the Equinoctiall. but wheras we (being vnto the North partes) do adde the South declination vnto the heigth of the Sunne, and rebate the North declination from the heigth of the Sunne, ſo in like manner the contrary is to be vſed: that is to ſay, to rebate the South declination from the heigth of the Sunne, and to adde vnto the heigth of the Sun the North declination. As for enſample. I admit the heigth of the ſun be taken .28. degrées aboue ye Horizon due North, & the declination of the Sun be .21. degrees vnto the Northwards, I do thē adde the declination of ye ſun which is .21 degrees vnto the heigth of the Sun (being .28. degrees) which maketh .49. degrées, & ſo many degrees ye Equinoct. is aboue the Horizon vnto the Northwards, & then (as it is before declared) pull that ſum out from .90. degrees, and there remaineth .41. degrees,An enſāple by taking ye South pole 41. degrees aboue the Horizon. which is the diſtance betweene the Zenith and the Equinoctiall, whiche alwayes is equall with the diſtance betweene the Pole and the Horizon: ſo that you may conclude the South Pole to be rayſed .41. degrees aboue the Horizon. As by this figure it is ſhewed.
            
            And furthermore, if the Sunne haue South declination, then (as before is declared) you muſt ſubtract or take away the Sunnes declination from the heigth of the Sunne: as for enſample. The heigth of the Sunne being taken at .50. degrees .
                  •
               0. minutes vnto the North partes, and the Sunne

hauing .7. degrées and .15. minutes of declination vnto the ſouthwards, from which heigth of the Sun (for that you are vnto the the Southwards beyond the Equinoctial) you muſt rebate the declination which is .7. degrées and .15. minuts, and there reſteth .43. degrées .15 minuts, for the true heigth of the Equinoctial, which ſumme you muſt take out of .90. degrées, that done, there remayneth .46. degrées .45. minutes, the true heigth of the South Pole aboue the Horizon, otherwiſe called the Antarticke Pole,An enſāple by taking ye north pole 60. degrees aboue the Horizon. as by enſample of this Fygure is playnely ſhewed.
            
            Yet furthermore I do thinke it conuenient to giue you an enſample vnto the Northwardes, that you maye perfectly knowe the true order of the working, bothe for the North parte and alſo the South parte. Admit therefore I take the heigth of the Sunne due South, at .50. degrées aboue the Horizon, the Sunne hauing then north declination .20. degrees: Now (for as much as you haue the north Pole aboue the horizon) you muſt rebate the Suns declination frō the heigth: ſo that .20. degr. being taken away from .50. there reſteth .30. whiche is the heigth of the Equinoctiall aboue the Horizon, and that .30. being taken from .90. there reſteth .60. So that you maye boldly affirme the North Pole to be .60. degrées aboue the Horizon, as by this figure folowing it is ſhewed.
            
               
               
            
            In like maner the Sunne being taken at that heigth and due South, hauing the like declination alſo to the Southwardes that it had before to the Northwardes: that is to ſay, being .50. degrées in heigth, and hauing .20. degrées of declination vnto the South partes, you muſte adde or put the declination of the Sunne vnto the heigth of the ſame, and it maketh .70. degrées which is the heigth of the Equinoctiall aboue the Horizon, this done, that .70. being taken out of .90. there remayneth but .20. ſo that the North Pole is but .20. degrées aboue the Horizon, as by the enſample of this fygure it is ſhewed.
            
            For in handling of the declination the true heigth of any of the Poles is knowne. Alwayes hauyng this conſideraton, that if they haue the North Pole aboue the Horizon, they do

alwayes adde or put too the heigth of the Sun,A thing to be noted in ye handling of the Sūnes declination. the South declination of the ſame. Or the Sunne hauing North declination, they pul away the Sunnes declination from the heigth thereof. Nowe contrarywiſe, if the South Pole be aboue the Horizon, you muſte adde the North declination vnto the heigth of the Sunne, and take away the South declination from the heigth of the ſame. Nowe to knowe whiche of the 2. Poles be aboue the Horizon, is a very eaſie matter and is knowne .2. wayes.Howe to know whiche of the .2 poles be vnder the horizon. For firſte if the North Pole be aboue the Horizon, you may knowe it by all the Starres rounde about the Pole, as Charles Wayne and the Guardes, with ſuch other markes as be aboute the North Pole. Neyther can you paſſe ſo ſodenly beyond the Equinoctiall, but it muſt néeds be known vnto you, & then you muſt vſe that kynd of working with the Sunnes declination that in the chapter or rule before is rehearſed: and alſo you may knowe it by the Arke or bearing of the Starres and lyghtes rounde aboute you. Thus much haue I ſayd as touching the Suns declination,The cauſe why engliſh mē haue not traueled far beyonde the Equinoctiall. bycauſe I knowe that diuers Engliſh men would haue trauelled further beyonde the Equinoctiall than they haue done, but that they haue not had the capacitie to handle the Sunnes declination when they haue bene beyonde the Equinoctiall, that is to ſay, vnto the South partes, hauing loſt the markes about the North Pole as the North Starre and other, and as for the Stars of the South, they haue not bene acquainted with them, but haue beaten vp and downe alongſt the coaſt of Ginnie and Bynney, and there haue ſpoiled and conſumed their men through the extraordinarie heat of the Sunne,An vntemperat place for extreme heate. Temperate clymate. not knowing that in going furthrr to the South partes, they ſhoulde haue brought themſelues into a good temperate clymate againe.
         
         
            
            ¶The .10. Chapter sheweth, howe to handle the Sunnes declination vnto the Northvvards, where the Sunne doth not ſet vnder the Horizon, and alſo to take the Sunne at the loweſt being due North.
            FOr further vſe of the Sunnes declination, if you haue any occaſion to trauell vnto the Northwardes or Southwardes more than .67. degrées of Altitude of any of the .2. Poles, or if the ſunne haue any great declination vnto thoſe partes that you are in, thē ſhall not the Sun go down vnder the Horizon in a long time,Of being vnder either of ye poles. after as you be in diſtance vnto the North parts, for if you were right vnder either of the .2. Poles of the world, then would not the Sunne go vnder the Horizon in halfe a yeare, ſo that there ſhould be continually day: And now for the handling of the Sunnes declination, to knowe ye heigth of the Pole, & to take the Sun North at the loweſt,Of taking the heigth of the ſun due north at the loweſt. do this: Firſt with your croſſe ſtaffe obſerue the Sun at the loweſt, taking the true diſtance betwéene the Horizon and the Sunne, that being truely done, looke what declination the Sunne hath, then haue you to conſider, that except the Sunne be neare vnto hir greateſt declination, that is to ſay, in the latter end of Gemini, or the beginning of Cancer) the Sunne dothe decline little in .24. houres:A thing worthy to be noted as touching ye ſunnes declination. but if the declination be very ſwift, you muſt ſéeke the Sunnes declination vpon the day before, and the daye after, halfe the diuerſitie of whych ſhall be the Sunnes declination: for that the ſunne is at the angle of mydnight. The Sunnes true declination being knowne, rebate the heigth of the ſame from the declination of the Sunne, & ſo ſhal you haue the true contente in degrées and minuts that the Equinoctiall is vnder the Horizon due North, and then pulling that ſum from .90. that which remaineth ſhal be the heigth of the pole aboue the Horizon: for (as it is before declared) looke what heigth the Equinoctial is aboue the Horizon, that is equal the diſtance betweene the Pole and the Zenith, and looke what diſtance

is betwéene the Equinoctiall and the Zenith,A thing to be noted of the pole and the Equinoctiall, the Zenith and the Horizon the ſame diſtaunce is betwéene the Pole and the Horizon in like manner, looke howe deepe vnder the Horizon the Equinoctiall is vnto the Northwards, ſo far equall is the heigth of the Equinoctial vnto the ſouthwards. As for enſample: admit I were vnto ye Northwards of the North cape, the Sun being in hir greateſt declination vnto the Northwards, whiche is about the .11. day of Iune .23. degrees and neere a halfe this being knowen I take the Sunne due North at the loweſt,The Sun taken due North at .6 degrees. iuſt .6. degrées aboue the Horizon, the declination being .23. degrees and .28. minutes. Wherefore I rebate from that .6. degrees and ſo there remayneth .17. degrées and .28 minutes. For the depth of the Equinoctiall vnder the Horizon, and then do I pull that ſumme from .90. and there remayneth 72. degrées .32. minutes for the true heigth of the North pole aboue the Horizon, as by this enſample it is declared.
            
            
               By this enſample you may alſo know the true heigth of any of the .2. poles, and how to obſerue the Sunne at the loweſt when the Sunne commeth neereſt vnto the Horizon, as well as you may when the Sunne is vpon the Meridian at the greateſt heigth from the Horizon, which is very neceſſary for them that do occupy vnto the Northwardes of Sainct Nicholas in Rouſey, it is alſo very neceſſary for them that would attempt any viages of diſcouery vnto the Northwards,Of viages for diſcouery to the Northwards eyther to the Eaſtward by Noua Zemla or to the Weſt ward by cape de Paramantia.
                as into the Eaſt by Noua Zemla, or to the Weſt by cape de Paramantia, on the backe ſide of the North part of the tayle of America, other wiſe called the backe ſide of Vacula, whiche if it were attempted, there is no doubt but they ſhoulde finde it nauigable eyther to the Eaſt parte or to the Weſt part: and I am of this opinion, that the thing moſte feared in making their diſcoucry vnto the Northward, deſerueth not ſo greatly to be feared as they do make it, the cauſe why they are ſo loth to go very farre vnto the Northwards is, for that it is the froſen zone, but my opinion is, that in ſommer tyme it is not to be feared, but the further vnto the Northwardes the more temperate warme, by meanes of the long continuaunce of the Sunne: for as we ſée by common experience that a thing once being made warme cannot ſodenly be made cold, neither is there doubt of any great cold vntill the Sunne be vnto the Southwards of the Equinoctiall: for I admit that a ſhip ſhould ſayle vnto the Northward, and not ſtay vntill the North pole were eleuated .80. degrees aboue the Horizon,Of temperateneſſe the pole being rayſed 80. degrees I do thinke then they ſhould find it very temperate and warme vnto the midle of September, for that by the ſpace of .9. wéekes togyther (that is to ſay from the .10 day of May, vnto the 12. day of Iuly) the Sun ſhould come no neerer vnto the Horizon due North than .10. degrees, or .30. degrees vnto the South part aboue the Horizon: and yet it is poſſible that it may be cold there vntill the ende of May, for that the Sunne muſt haue a time to make the aire warme. For like as a thing once béeing

colde cannot bée ſodaynely made warme, ſo in like manner a place being once made warme cannot bée ſodainely made colde. And furthermore he that were in the Latitude of .80. degrées ſhoulde haue but a ſhort paralele:The length of the paralele at .80. degrees is but .1250. engliſh leagues. for the whole compaſſe of the earth and Sea going Eaſt and Weſt too come rounde about to that place agayne in the ſame paralele is but .1250. engliſh leagues, euery league conteining .3. engliſhe miles: So that in ſayling of leſſe than 500. or .600. leagues, they myght ſée whether it were nauigable or not.
         
         
            The eleuenth Chapter doth shew hovv you ſhall knovve the length of the day, and to knowe how much the day is ſhortened or lengthened by the Sunnes declination.
            NOwe I thinke it conuenient for Seafaring men too knowe the length of the daye in anye place that they haue occaſion too go vntoo: for that they haue occaſion too trauell intoo all the climates and places, tranſporting them ſelues manye tymes quickly from one place vntoo another: and although the aunciente writers haue appoynted certayne climates, and other late writers in lyke manner haue made tables very exact for the longeſt or ſhorteſt day in anye of thoſe climates, and other places, according to the eleuation of the pole: yet haue they not opened anye waye vntoo them in gyuing anye order for them to knowe when the days is an houre

longer or ſhorter, whereby they might at all times knowe the length of the day, which notwithſtanding is very neceſſary for them, for that they be abroade vnder ſayle bothe night and day, and in like manner for that they muſt kéepe account of houres and times exactly,
                  How neceſſary it is for a Seafaring man to know the lēgth of the day.
                  Vnder the Equinoctial the day is always .12. houres lōg. The pole 16. degrees 44. minuts the day .13. houres long when it is at the lōgeſt▪
                  
                in as muche as they ought to kéepe an account of the ſhippes way: wherefore it muſt néedes be moſt neceſſary for nauigation, to knowe the true time of the Sunne riſing and ſetting, whiche you ſhall knowe by this meanes: firſt this is not vnknowne, that vnder the Equinoctiall the Sunne is .12. houres aboue the Horizon, and .12. houres vnder the Horizon, (what declination ſoeuer the Sunne hath) ſo that there the Sunne ryſeth at .6. of the clocke and ſetteth at .6. of the clocke for euer. And where the pole is rayſed .16. degrees and .44. minutes, there the longeſt day is .13. houres, (the Sunne hauing hir greateſt declination at .23. degrées .28. minutes) and the ſhorteſt day is 11. houres long: and then looke when the Sunne hath declined .23. degrées and a halfe eyther backwards or forwardes, for then the day is an houre longer or ſhorter and proportionably: when the Sunne hath declined .11. degrées .44. minutes then it is halfe an houre longer or ſhorter.The pole 30. degrees 48. minuts the longeſt day .14. houres lōg. &c. Moreouer wher the pole is eleuated .30. degrées .48. minutes, there the longeſt day is .14. houres and the ſhorteſt day is .10. houres long, the Sunne then riſing at .5. of the clocke and ſetting at .7. of the clocke, and there when the Sunne hath declined .11. degrees and .44. minutes from the Equinoctiall .&c. vnto the greateſt declination, then the day is an houre longer or ſhorter,The pole 41. degrees 23. minutes the longeſt day .15. houres lōg. and whē the Sunne hath declined .5. degrées .52. minutes then the day is halfe an houre longer or ſhorter .&c. Furthermore alſo, where the pole is raiſed .41. degrées .23. minutes, there the longeſt day is .15. houres, and the ſhorteſt .9. houres long, (the Sunne hauing hir greateſt declination, and as thē riſing at .4. of the clocke .30. minutes, and ſetting at .7. of the clocke .30. minutes) ſo that there when the Sunne hath declined .7. degrées .49. minutes from the Equinoctiall, the day

ſhall be an houre longer or ſhorter, and when it hath declined 3. degrées .54. minutes, the day ſhall be halfe an houre longer or ſhorter .&c. And furthermore,The pole raiſed .49. deg. 1. mi. then the longeſt day is 16. houres long. where the Pole is rayſed .49 degrees one minute, there the longeſt day is .16. houres, and the ſhorteſt .8. houres long, the Sunne ryſing at .4. of the clocke, and ſetting at .8. of the clocke, ſo that there when the Sunne hath declyned .5. degrées .52. minutes from the Equinoctiall, then ſhall the daye be an houre longer or ſhorter. And when the Sunne hath declyned .2. degrees .56. minutes, then the daye ſhall be halfe an houre longer or ſhorter .&c. Yet furthermore, where the Pole is rayſed .54. degrées .30.The pole raiſed .54. deg. 30. mi. then the longeſt daye is 17. houres long. minutes, there the longeſt day is .17. houres, and the ſhorteſt 7. houres long, the Sunne then ryſing at .3. of the clocke 30. minutes, and ſetting at .8. and .30. minutes: where when the Sun hath declyned .4. degrees & .41. minutes from the Equinoctial, to the greateſt declynatiō, the day is an hour longer or ſhorter, and when ſhe hath declined .2. degrées .21. minuts, the day is halfe an houre longer or ſhorter, &c.The pole rayſed .58. deg. 27. mi. the longeſt day is .18. houres long Where alſo the Pole is rayſed .58. degrées .27. minutes, there the longeſt day is 18. houres long, and the ſhorteſt but .6. and there when the Sunne hath declined .3. degrées .55. minuts from the equinoctiall, then the day ſhall be an hour longer or ſhorter: and when the Sunne hath declyned .2. degrées lacking .2. minuts,The pole rayſed .61. deg. 18. mi. the longeſt day is .19. houres long then the day ſhall be halfe an houre longer or ſhorter. Furthermore alſo, wher the pole is raiſed .61. degrees .18. minuts, there the longeſt day is .19. houres long, and the ſhorteſt but .5 houres: then ſhall the Sunne ryſe at .2. of the clocke .30. minutes, and ſet at .9. and .30. minutes, and there when the Sun hath declined .3. degrees and .21 minutes from the Equinoctiall, then ſhall the daye be an houre longer or ſhorter, &c. Furthermore, where the Pole is rayſed .63. degrées .22.The Pole 63. deg. 2. mi. the longeſt day .20. hours long. minutes, there the longeſt daye is .20. houres long, and the ſhorteſt but .4. houres, then ſhall the Sunne ryſe at two of the clocke, and ſette at tenne of the clocke, and when the Sunne hath declyned two degrées, and fiftie ſixe minutes

from the Equinoctiall vnto the greateſt declination, then ſhall the day be an houre longer or ſhorter &c.
                  The pole rayſed .64. degrees .49 minutes the longeſt day 11. houres long.
                  The pole 65. degrees the longeſt day .22. houres lōg.
                Now where the pole is rayſed .64. degrées .49. minutes, there the longeſt day ſhall be .21. houres long, and the ſhorteſt but .3. houres: And there when the Sun hath declined but .2. degrées .36. minutes from the Equinoctiall vnto the greateſt declination, the day ſhall be an houre longer or ſhorter. Where alſo the pole is raiſed .65. degrées, there the longeſt day ſhall be .22. houres and the ſhorteſt but .2. houres long, and when that the Sunne hath declyned but .2. degrées and .20. minutes from the Equinoctiall &c. then the day ſhall be an houre longer or ſhorter.The pole 66. degrees 20. minutes the longeſt day .23. houres lōg. The pole 66. degrees 32. minutes then the Sun ſhall not ſet vnto them. &c. And where the pole is rayſed .66. degrees .20. minutes the longeſt day ſhall be .23. houres long and the ſhorteſt but one houre long, and then when that the Sunne hath declined but .2. degrees .8. minutes, then the day ſhall be an houre longer or ſhorter, and then where that the North pole is rayſed .66. degrées and .32. minutes, there it is 24. houres long, for that when the Sunne hath hir greateſt declination vnto the Northwardes, then at midnight you ſhall ſée halfe the Sunne, and then when that the Sun hathe the greateſt declination vnto the South parts, then you ſhal ſée but halfe the Sunne at noone, and then in the going but 15. miles further vnto the Northwards, that is, but one quarter of a degrée,The Sun clean aboue the Horizon due North and not to appeare aboue the Horizon South at noone. then the Sunne ſhall be cleane aboue the Horizō at the due North, and not ſeene vnto the South at noone aboue the Horizon, the Sunne hauing hir greateſt declination to the South, and then the day ſhal be an hour longer or ſhorter when that the Sunne hath declined one degrée .57 minutes from the Equinoctiall and ſo foorth vnto the greateſt declination. And thus much haue I ſayd as touching the length of the daye, whereby you maye knowe at all times the true length of the day in any Latitude betwéene the Equinoctiall and the eleuation of the pole at .66. degrées and 32. minutes, by knowing howe manye degrées the Sunne is declined, and that you may know on euery day by the regiment

going before, hauing this conſideration,To knowe the length of the day at any time in any place. What the day is. that if the Sunne being vppon the Equinoctiall, and hauing no declination, that then in anye Latitude the daye is alwayes iuſt .12. houres long. And you muſt note this, that it is called the day from the riſing of the Sunne vnto the ſetting of the ſame vnder the Horizon and not from day light vnto day light. For before the Sun riſe and after that the Sun is ſet it is counted for no parcell of the day but it is called the day light. And furthermore, the day light will appeare by that time that the Sunne doth touch the .17. degrée of the Horizon before the Sunne riſing, and alſo the day light will not be cleane gone vntill the Sunne be more than .17. degrées vnder the Horizon: for as you may perceiue here with vs at London that when the Sunne hath hir greateſt declination vnto the Northwards in Iune that the day light remaineth all night, for that the Sunne goeth not vnder the Horizon, but .15. degrées and .2. minutes.
         
         
            The twelfth Chapter is of the North Starre.
            AS touching the North Starre I ſay but little thereof for that it is ſufficiently declared in the art of nauigation, the Starre hathe Longitude vnto the ſigne of Gemini, and from the poles of the world in the ſigne of Aries, which Star ſtandeth vppon the tippe of the tayle of vrſa minor or little Beare, and hath Latitude frō the line Eclipticke .66. degrées 30. minutes,The North Starres declination▪

            ¶The thirtenth chapter dothe shewe you by the ſayling vpon the quarter of your compaſſe, in how far ſayling you do rayſe a degree, and what you doe departe from the Meridian, and in the ende there is a Demonſtration therof.
            FUrthermore, bycauſe there be ſome that deſire to knowe the alteration of a point: to this ende, that in running of one poynte, they may rayſe or lay a degree ſoner in one than in an other: as in ye ſayling ſouth or North,In going ſouthwards you rayſe ye equinoctiall & lay ye pole: in going to ye northwards rayſe ye pole and lay the Equinoctiall. kéeping one Meridian they rayſe or lay the Pole. As this for your example. In going to the North, you doe rayſe the Pole and lay the Equinoctial: Contrarywiſe, going towardes the South, you laye the Pole, and rayſe the Equinoctiall. But in ſayling or going Eaſt or Weaſt, you do neyther alter your Pole nor Paralele but onely your Meridian. Whereas in ſayling of any other poynte, you doe alter both your Pole and Paralele, and alſo your Meridian. Wherefore I will open vnto you (in ſayling vppon one of the quarters of the compaſſe) what euery pointe doth rayſe or lay one degrée, in how farre ſayling, and howe many myles you be departed from the place you departed from, and what ſpace you be departed from your Meridian.Of engliſhe leagues and ſpaniſh leagues. But heere is one thing to be noted (as I ſuppoſe) in the moſt part of cardes they allowe for euery degree, but .17. leagues and a half: your cards be moſt commonly made in Liſhborne, in Portugal, in Spayne, or elſe in Fraunce. But as I take it, we in England ſhould allowe .60. myles to one degrée: that is, after .3. miles to one of our Engliſhe leagues, wherefore .20. of oure Engliſh leagues ſhoulde anſwere to one degrée, for that .3. of our myles will not make one of their leagues. And bycauſe they make their acountes by their leagues in the cardes and not by oures, therefore I

will ſhew you by our Engliſhe myles. An Engliſh myle conteyneth .1000. paſes,A mile containeth 1000. paſes and euery paſe .5. fote and euery paſe .5. foote, and euery foote .12 ynches. Nowe ſome thinke that a paſe can not be .5. foote, but a paſe Geometrical is .2. reaſonable ſteppes, for it can not be a paſe vntill the hinder foote be remoued forwards, and thoſe 2. ſteppes will containe .5. foote, and ſo maye any man endure to goe at pleaſure. But nowe to our purpoſe. For the ſayling of one quarter of the compaſſe, this is to be noted. Firſt yt in ſayling directly ſouth or North, you do raiſe or lay the Pole a degrée in .60. myles going.A degree is 60. miles or 20. engliſhe leagues. In the altering of one point from the South or North in .61. myles: and you be departed from the lyne of Eaſt and Weaſt, or the Meridian .12 myles. In altering of the ſeconde poynt you rayſe a degree in ſayling of .65. myles: and departe from your Meridian .25. myles. In altering of the .3. poynte, you doe rayſe or lay one degrée in ſayling .72. myles and a .9. part: and are departed from your Meridian .40. myles.A note to knowe in how far ſayling you do rayſe or lay a degree in the ſayling by any one point of the compaſſe, Moreouer in altering of the 4. point, you do raiſe or lay a degrée in the going of .85. myles: & depart from your Meridian .60. miles. In altering of the .5. point or winde, you raiſe a degrée in the ſayling of .108. miles: and depart from your Meridian .90. miles. In ſayling by the 6. point, you raiſe or lay one degrée in .157. miles: and depart from your Meridian line, 145. miles. Laſt of all, in ſayling by the .7. pointe or winde, you doe raiſe a degrée in going of .308. miles, and depart from your Meridian line .302. miles, and after this manner you may conſider of the other three quarters of the compaſſe. But if you require to knowe the rayſing or laying of a degrée by the leagues of the cardes: that is, at .17. leagues and a halfe: then reade the arte of Nauigation, and there ſhall you finde howe many degrées you be departed fro your Meridian, and alſo from the place that you departed from: and yet that ſerueth for no other place but onely for vnder the Equinoctiall, for he that maketh account of it in any other place, ſhall be deceiued. For euer as you goe to any of the .2. Poles, your degrées be ſtil ſhorter and ſhorter

till ſuch time as your Meridian méete vnder the two Poles, whereof I intreat in the .16. Chapter. For the better vnderſtanding of ye things aforeſayd, looke on this figure folowing.
            
               
            
         
         
            ¶The .14. Chapter teacheth to know hovv far any lande is off from you, knovving but the diſtance betweene any two places: whither you runne along by the lande, or directly to the ſhoare or otherwiſe: with other neceſſarie things.
            FOr that I know it very neceſſarie and profitable for Seamen, to knowe howe neare or farre they be into the Sea, and how neare to the lande, I will intreat thereof for diuers

conſiderations: And firſt, bicauſe in rūning alongſt the land there may be daunger, which may be ſuch a certaine quantitie into the ſea, that they may go both within them and with out them. And alſo in like manner, for that being at one diſtance from the lande, the land may riſe in ſuch a ſhape or faſhion, whereas being nearer, the lande may riſe in another forme or faſhion: for being far off, you ſhal ſée the hils within the lande, and being neare, the hilles or cliffes neare vnto the Sea coaſt maye take awaye the ſight of the lande within.A note for the land ryſing in diuers ſhapes or faſhions. Furthermore alſo, it is very neceſſarie to know in what faſhion the lande doth riſe vpō diuers points of the compaſſe, as ofte as the faſhion of the lande doth alter, and to note it in ſome booke for remembrance. Firſt by what pointes of the compaſſe,
                  To knowe how far the lande is frō you.
                  Where two lands be but one point aſunder.
                then the faſhion, & laſt at how far off. &c. For knowledge how farre off you be from the land, you may haue this helpe, if there be any .2. places by the Sea coaſt, whereof you knowe the diſtance, howe many leagues or miles the one is from the other. In going alongſt the coaſt you ſhall ſet them vp with your compaſſe, and when you are thwart of them, if they be but one point aſunder, you ſhalbe .5. times the diſtance betweene them from the lande or ſhoare. If the two places be two pointes aſunder, then the diſtance vnto the ſhore ſhall be two times and a halfe the diſtance. If .3. points aſunder, then the diſtance vnto the ſhoare ſhall be once the diſtance and a halfe. If .4. pointes aſunder, the ſame diſtance ſhall be betwéene you and the ſhoare, that is betweene the two markes. If .5. pointes aſunder, then is it vnto the ſhore but .2. third partes of the diſtance betwéen the .2. places. If .6. points aſunder, (you being thwart of one of them) then ſhall the diſtance vnto the ſhore be, not halfe the diſtance between the .2. places. And in al theſe caſes before rehearſed, the one place muſt be thwarte of you, the other muſt be a head or ſterne of you: and ſo it is exacte and true. As for enſample this: I (going alongeſt by any coaſte) do know before hand how the one place doth beare from the other, beſides this alſo I know

the diſtance, that is to ſay, howe many leagues they be a ſunder. As for enſample, the .2. places aſſigned beare Eaſte and Weſt the one from the other, I then (knowing that they be 3. leagues aſunder) when I haue brought one of the places South or north of me, do ſet them with my compaſſe, the one being North of me, and the other bearing North and by caſt that is one point aſunder: Now the diſtance vnto the ſhore,Of .2. places to be one point aſunder. being .5. times the diſtance betwéen the .2. places which be .3. leagues aſunder, I knowe the ſhoare to be .15. leagues from me, which (if the places were but one league aſunder) ſhould be but .5. leagues from the ſhoare.To be two points aſū
                  der. Furthermore if the places be .2. pointes aſunder, that is to ſay, the one North, and the other North North, then ſhall the diſtance vnto the ſhoare be 7. leagues and a halfe from me. Wheras if the .2. places were but a league aſunder, it ſhuld be but .2. leagues & a half vnto ye ſhore. And furthermore, if the places be .3. points aſunder,3. pointes aſunder. that is to ſay, the one North, and the other Northeaſt & by north, the diſtance vnto the ſhore ſhal be .4. leagues & a half: wheras if the .2. places were but one league aſūder, vnto ye ſhore it ſhould be but a league & a half. If .4. points aſunder,4. pointes aſunder. that is to ſay, if the one place be due North, and the other place Northeaſt, thē it is vnto the ſhore .3. leagues iuſt. If but one league aſunder then but one league vnto the ſhore.5. pointes aſunder. Moreouer if the 2. places be .5. points aſunder, that is to ſay, the one north and the other Northeaſt & by Eaſt, then ye diſtance vnto the ſhore ſhall be but .2. leagues: whereas if the .2. places were but one league aſūder vnto the ſhore ſhuld be but .2. miles. Laſt of al, if the .2. places be .6. pointes aſunder, that is to ſay,6. pointes aſunder. the one north, and the other eaſt northeaſt, then it ſhall not be a league and a halfe vnto the ſhore. &c. But if you come directly to ye land wards, hauing no cauſe to be thwart of none of thoſe known places, then to know how far you be from the lande you muſt do as is by the places before ſpokē of. For if you go in due north the one place being north & by weſt, & the other north and by eaſt: then (the .2. places being 3. leagues aſunder)

you ſhall be .7. leagues and a half from the ſhore:Of going or ſayling right into ye ſhore. ſo that if you runne into the ſhore due north vntill they be .4. poynts aſunder, that is to ſay, the one north northweſt, and the other north northeaſt, then it ſhall be vnto the ſhore .3. leagues and 3. quarters. And furthermore, you ſtill running in due north, till the .2. places be .6. pointes aſunder, that is to ſay, the one place to be northweaſte and by north, and the other place to be northeſt & by north, the diſtance vnto the ſhore ſhall be .2. leagues and a quarter. And again, if you runne in due north, vntill they be .8. pointes aſunder, that is to ſay, the one place northweaſt, and the other northeaſt: then the diſtance vnto the land or ſhore ſhall be but half the diſtance betwéen the .2. places, that is, but one league and a half. Laſtly, if you run to the land due north, vntill the .2. places be .10. points aſunder, that is to ſay, the one place northweaſt and by weaſt, and the other northeaſt and by eaſt, then the diſtance vnto the ſhore ſhall be but one third part of the diſtance betweene the .2. places, that is, but one league from the land. &c. Thus much haue I ſaide as touching the bearing of the lande from you, by the points of the compaſſe, to know the diſtance or how farre the land is of: which is very neceſſary for Seamen to know for diuers conſiderations as I ſayd before.A way to knowe how one hedland beareth of another. If now therefore you knowe not howe one headland doth beare from another, doe thus: In running alongſt the coaſt, when you ſée the appearing of any lande one before another, ſet them with your cō
               paſſes, and looke how they beare from you, by what point of the compaſſe, and ſo ſhall you know iuſtly how the one lande doth beare or lye from the other. And by this order you may correct your plats, by doing this, as often as you ſée .2. notable places togither: as Ilands, rocks, headlands, mouthes of hauens, ſandes, or what ſoeuer elſe be worthy of noting, this done, as often as you do ſée them togither, ſet them with your compaſſe, & that wil ſhew you moſt certainly, that ſo they do beare the one from the other. You may know the diſtance in like maner betwéene them, if you knowe your ſhips way, as

thus, whē you firſt ſée any .2. places togither, as .2. headlands,To knowe the diſtance at the Sea betweene any .2. headlandes. or .2. Ilands, hauing ſet them with your compaſſe, and knowing how the one beareth from the other then, for that you wil not come neare vnto them, you do hale off from the land, vntill that you haue brought your ſelfe farre inough off at youre diſcretion, and when you be thwart of the firſte headland, ſet the other land, and conſider howe it 
                  •
               eareth from you: then recken your ſhips way, how many leagues the ſhippe might goe vntill you come thwarte of the other headlande, kéeping your courſe along as the .2. headlandes beare, and ſo ſhall you both knowe the diſtance betwéen the .2. places, and alſo how farre you be off from them. In like maner,To knowe howe far it is vnto the land an other way. hauing conſideration of the diſtance betwéene the other places that you haue obſerued both by your compaſſe and alſo by the ſhippes way, you may know how farre it is to the ſhore, going right to the lande wardes, by your croſſe ſtaffe, although you knowe not the diſtance betwéen any two places. As thus: take the wideneſſe betwéen any two places with your croſſe ſtaffe, bearing right to the land wardes, and then remoue the croſſe ſtaffe or tranſitorie halfe the length of the tranſitorie, that is to ſaye, the end next vnto you, and then by running in till the .2. ends of the tranſitorie doe agrée with the two markes, you ſhall be halfe way to the ſhore: then looke howe farre the ſhippe hath gone in that time, for the ſame diſtance is vnto the land frō the ſhip. But if you remoue the tranſitory but a quarter ye length of the tranſitorie to youwards, then at the place wher the end of the tranſitorie doth agrée with the .2. markes, ſhall be one quarter of the diſtance betwéene the ſhore & you at the firſt obſeruation: & it ſhall be .3. times that quantitie vnto the ſhore. &c. And to know the ſhips way,To knowe the ſhippes way. ſome do vſe this which (as I take it) is very good: they haue a pece of wood & a line to vere out ouer borde, with a ſmall line of a great lengthe whiche they make faſt at one ende, and at the other ende and middle, they haue a piece of a line which they make faſt with a ſmall thred to ſtande like vnto a crowfoote: for this purpoſe,

that it ſhould driue a ſterne as faſt as the ſhippe doth go away from it, alwayes hauing the line ſo ready that it goeth out as faſt as the ſhippe goeth. In like manner they haue either a minute of an houre glaſſe, or elſe a knowne part of an houre by ſome number of wordes, or ſuche other like, ſo that the line being vered out and ſtopt iuſte with that time that the glaſſe is out, or the number of wordes ſpoken, which done, they hale in the logge or piece of woode againe, and loke howe many fadome the ſhippe hath gone in that time: that being knowne,
                  An engliſhe league .2500 fadome.
                  A Spaniſh league .2857. fadome.
                what part of a league ſoeuer it be, they multiplie the number of fadomes, by the portion of tyme or part of an houre. Whereby you may knowe iuſtly howe many leagues and partes of a league the ſhip goeth in an houre. &c. For an Engliſhe league doth containe .250. fadome. And a ſpaniſh or portingale league doth contain .2857. fadomes. &c.
         
         
            ¶The fiftenth Chapter or rule treateth of the Longitude. &c.
            NOwe ſome there be that be very inquiſtiue to haue a way to get the longitude, but that is to tedious. For this they muſt conſider, that the whole frame of the firmament is caried round from the eaſt to the weſt in .24. hours, ſo as ther remaineth neither light nor marke, but goeth rounde, ſauing only the .2. poles of the world, and theſe .2. ſtand alwayes faſt. But (as I ſayd before in the .9. rule) of him that going South or North doth raiſe or lay the pole,Altering ye time of riſing and ſetting of the lights. and in like caſe of the Equinoctiall altering his paralele, and cauſing the light of the firmamēt to alter the time of their ſhining or abiding aboue our Horizon: ſo he that goeth directly eaſt or weaſt, doth neither raiſe nor lay the pole, ſo that ſtill the lights of the firmamēt doth make one maner of arch according to their latitude or declination: but the going Eaſt or Weaſt doth alter the Meridian, cauſing ye planets to haue their aſpects at another hour or time, altering ye time of the changes of ye moone & alſo

the time of the Eclipſes:Altering the aſpects. which is neceſſary for all trauellers by Sea or by lande. Therefore I thought it néedefull to be ſpoken of: for as countries haue Latitude from the pole ſo in like manner they haue appointed Longitude. Now therfore you may get the Latitude with inſtrumentes,Of Latitude and Longitude. but the Longitude you muſt bring from another place, which you can do but with a globe or elſe a mappe or card, and then you muſt meaſure from the Meridian of the Canarie Ilands, otherwiſe called the fortunate Ilandes. And in oure Latitude of London euery .555. miles whiche conteineth .15.15. degrees is an houre of time and at London it is .555. miles. degrées wil aunſwer to one houre of time: and vnder the Equinoctiall .900. miles to .15. degrées: the degrées be as long as the degrées of Latitude, but towards the pole fewer and fewer till they come to nothing vnder the .2. poles. And nowe .37. miles which are at London, will aunſwer to one degree of our Latitude at .51. or .52. degrées of eleuation of the pole, but the cauſe why the Longitude was fetched from the Canarie Ilands I know not, but it was as I ſuppoſe,Longitude beginneth at the Cannary Ilāds bycauſe it was then the weſtermoſt place then knowen: for Ptholemeus was the firſte that ordeyned that rule.
            Nowe furthermore bycauſe you ſhall knowe the better, I would draw out certain of the chéefeſt places about thys Realme of England, both their Longitude and Latitude, by which you ſhall know what manner of Arch the Sun with the other lights dothe make, and alſo by the Longitude you may know at what time the Moone with any of the Planets doth make any aſpect. Beſides this, the Eclipſes of the Sun or Moone, with the chaunge, quarters, and full Moone, by a true and exact Ephemerides through all England to knowe the verie true houre and minute of the time of the diameter:To know the true time of the aſpects of the Mone. conſidering for what Longitude or place your Almanacke was made. And now to get the Longitude, you may do it at the time of the Eclipſe of the Moone, for that the Eclipſes of the Moone be generall, ſo that ſhe being aboue your Horizon in any place vpon the ſuperficiall parts of the earth

or Sea, conſidering (as I ſaid before) by your Almanacke, at that time when the Eclipſe ſhould happen, the very houre and minute, knowing alſo the place that your Almanacke was made for: that done, according to this rule, with a preciſe inſtrument you ſhall take the alteration of the time with the houre and minute of the Eclipſe. And furthermore you might know your Longitude with the Ephemerides, by the coniunction of the Moone with other fixed Starres, if it were not for one great infirmitie, and that is the paralex of the Moone, whiche the ſemidiametre of the earth doth cauſe, by the néereneſſe of the Moone vnto the earth: wherefore I woulde not any Sea men ſhoulde be of that opinion that they mighte get anye Longitude with inſtrumentes.The Longitude is not to be gotten with inſtrumēts on ye Sea. Therefore let no Sea men trouble themſelues with anye ſuch rule, but (according to their accuſtomed manner) let them kéepe a perfite accompt and reckening of the way of their ſhippe, whether the ſhippe goeth to lewards or makith hir way good, conſidering alwayes what thinges be againſt them or with them: as tides, currents, winds, or ſuch like. As for the rule of Longitude, it followeth in the next Chapter.
         
         
            
            The .16. Chapter sheweth how many miles vvill aunſvver to one degree of Longitude, in euery ſeuerall Latitude, betweene the Equinoctiall and any of the a poles: with the demonſtration for that purpoſe: and the diuerſities of aſpectes of the Moone.
            NOw by this rule ſhal I teach you how many miles wil anſwer to one degree, for euery ſeuerall Latitude to any of the .2. poles either articke or antarticke. And firſt, vnder the Equinoctiall (the .2. poles being euen with the Horizō) 60. miles do anſwer to one degrée, as I ſaid in the .15. rule. And now ſhall follow the reſt. Where the poles be raiſed .21. degrées .56. miles belongeth to one degrée of Lōgitude. Now ye poles being rayſed .29. degrées .52. miles do anſwer to one degrée. The poles being raiſed .36. degrées .48. miles do anſwer to one degrée. The pooles .42. degrées rayſed .44. miles goeth to one degrée of Longitude. The Pole raiſed .57. degrees .32. miles to one degrée. The Pole raiſed .62. degrées .28. miles to one degrée. The Pole raiſed .66. degrées .24. miles to one degrée. The Pole rayſed .70. degrées .20. miles to one degrée. The Pole rayſed .74. degrées .16. miles to one degrée. The Pole rayſed .78. degrées .12. miles to one degrée. The Pole rayſed .82. degrées .8. miles to one degrée. The Pole rayſed .86. degrées .4. miles to one degrée. The Pole being rayſed to the hyeſt at .90. degrées (being then your Zenith) there all the Meridians méete.
            
               
               
                  A demonstration to knowe howe many miles will anſwere vnto a degree in Longitude in euery ſeueral latitude betwene the equinoctial and any of the two Poles

               ſtration doth ſhewe you, howe manye myles wyll aunſwer to a degree, for euery ſeueral Altitude of ye Pole in the halfe circle is marked ye eleuation of ye Pole: in the lyne of Diameter, or right line, is marked the miles anſwering euerye degrée: and to know howe many miles wil aunſwer vnto one degrée, firſt lay ye thréed vnto the eleuation of the pole that you do require ye number of myles vnto, one degree: & then the iuſt

length of the threde being marked, lay the threde vnto the line of Diameter, or right line, whiche is the line of miles, and then you ſhall ſee at that place is the number of miles vnto one degrée &c. Now you muſt conſider that euery houre of time in the chaunging of the Moone or of the Eclipſes you muſt allow .15. degrees,15. degrees anſwereth vnto an houre of time. euery degree in miles as you do ſée in your Latitude of the countrie, as thus: thoſe places yt be to the Weſtwards of your towne, place or countrie by .15. degrées the Moone ſhall chaunge rather with them thā with you by one houre, bycauſe that they ſhall touch your Meridian before theirs by one houre. And if the towne or place be to the Eaſtwards of you by .15. degrées, then ſhall the Moone chaunge rather with you than with them by one houre, as for an enſample thus, with vs at London, the .xx. day of May 1574. the Moone ſhall chaunge at .12. of the clocke at Noone .5. minutes. Now to the Weſtwards as farre as Liſhburne in Portingall the Moone ſhall chaunge that ſame day at .11. of the clocke .8 minutes, the Longitude being thereof from the Canarie Ilands .5. degrées .36. minutes. Now to the Eaſtwards, that ſame day at noone, the Moone ſhall chaunge at one of the clocke .12. minutes, bicauſe that they haue Longitude .36. degrées .40. minutes from the Cannary Ilands and then by this accompt .7. degrées and a halfe will aunſwer to halfe an houre, and then .3. degrées and a quarter will make a quarter of an houre, and then .9. miles and a quarter will make one minute of time with vs at London in our Latitude, ſo by this rule you may knowe at what time and minute the Eclipſes or chaunges of the Moone doe happen, knowing for what place your Almanacke was made, for commonly we heere in England do make them for the cittie of London. Thus muche haue I ſaide as touching the true time of the chaunge of the Moone, for that ſome people (as I haue ſayde before in the .3. chapter) do contemne and ſaye, why do they not giue or make rules for euer to knowe the houre and minute of the chaunge, full,To knowe ye true time of ye change & quarters of the moon is a queſtion aſtronomicall, geometricall and coſmographicall. and quarters of the

Moone? And yet they be vtterly voyde of any knowledge in the Mathematicall Science, whereby they might knowe the true time of the chaunge of the Moone: For it is a queſtion Aſtronomicall, to know the Moones motion: a queſtion Geometricall, to know the true time of the aſpectes, or meaſure betwéene the Sunne and the Moone: and thirdly, it is a queſtion Coſmographicall, to knowe the true Longitude of the place he is in, at the time when the Moone chaungeth. &c. Nowe foloweth the next rule whiche ſhall treate of Longitude and Latitude.
         
         
            ¶The .17. Chapter or rule treateth of the Longitude and Latitude of certaine of the moſt notable places in Englande: and alſo howe long the Moone doth change at the one towne before the other: with the diuerſitie of the longeſt day in Sommer, from South Hampton to the Northermoſt parte in Scotland.
            NOwe in this rule foloweth the Longitude and Latitude of the moſt part of the principall places in England. The Southermoſt place in England, is the Lizarde in Cornwal: the Longitude thereof is .15. degrées .5. minutes: the Latitude 50. degrees .45. minutes. S. Michaels Mount hath in Longitude .14. degrees .20. minutes: in Latitude .51. degrees .6. minutes. Falmouth hath Longitude .15. degrees .12. minutes: Latitude .51. degrees .0. minuts.

Now by the Longitude & Latitude you may know the length of the day both in Sommer and in Winter, with the perfit houre and minute of the changes of the Moone, and how long the Moone doth change at one town before another, through the whole realme of England. And now in order as I haue begon before, I will ſhewe you the diſtance of time.To know ye diuerſitie of the time of the chaunge of the moon through all England. And firſt at S. Michaels Mount, the Moone changeth rather than at London by 25. minuts. Rather at Falmouth than at London by .20. mi. At Plimmouth rather than at London by .18. min. At South Hampton rather than at London by 5. minuts. At Portſmouth rather than at Lon. by .4 minuts.

At Rye later than at London by one minute and .½. At Douer later than at London by .6. minutes and more. At Canterburie later than at London by .5. minutes. At Sandwich later than at London by .6. minuts. Graueſend later than at London by one minute and a halfe. Briſtow rather than at London by .11. minutes. Haruard rather than at London by 12. minutes. Saint Dauids head rather than at London by 19. minutes. Oxforde rather than at London by .4. minuts. Cambridge later than at London by .⅔. partes of a minute. Norwich later than at London by .5. minuts and more. Lincolne later than at London by .2. minutes. Welſhpoole rather than at London by .16. minutes. Weſtcheſter rather than at London by .10. minutes. Hull later than at London by .4. minutes. Yorke later than at London by .¼. of a minute. Cockermouth rather than at London by .12. minutes. Carelyle rather than at London by .9. minutes. Newecaſtle later than at London by .2. minutes. Barwicke later than at London by thrée minutes and more.
            The cauſe why that it is called the chaunge of the Moone, is for that the Moone chaungeth the ſydes of the Sunne, for before the change the Moone is on the Weſt ſide of the Sun: and after the chaunge, the Moone is on the Eaſte ſide of the Sunne. &c. Nowe in like manner, I thinke it neceſſarie to be ſpoken of the difference of the longeſt day in Sommer, in euery ſeuerall Latitude, through the whole Realme of England frō the Southermoſt part, called the Lizard, to the Northermoſt part in Scotlande: and this is called the day, from the Sunne ryſing or appearing aboue the Horizon.
            
               To know ye lēgth of the longeſt day through all England & Scotlande.Firſte at South Hampton the longeſt daye is .16. houres long .26. minutes, the ſhorteſt .7. houres .54. minutes. At London .16. houres .30. minutes longeſt .7. houres .30. minuts ſhorteſt. At Lincolne .16. houres .45. minuts longeſt .7. hours 15. minutes ſhorteſt.
            At Yorke, the longeſt .17. houres, the ſhorteſt .7. houres. Newcaſtle the longeſt .17. houres .12. minutes, the ſhorteſt .6.

houres .48. minutes. Barwicke, the longeſt .17. houres .30. minutis, the ſhorteſt .6. houres .30. minuts. Edenborow in Scotlande, the longeſt day in Sommer .17. houres .45. minuts, the ſhorteſt day .6. houres .15. minutes. Now Catnes point being the northermoſt part in all Scotlande, the Pole being raiſed to .62. degrées, there the longeſt day is .19. houres .30. minuts, the ſhorteſt daye .4. houres .30. minutes. Nowe this you doe conſider, loke what the longeſt day doth containe, looke what that lacketh of .24. hours, that is the ſhorteſt Winter day. &c.
         
         
            The eightenth Chapter or rule ſhevveth hovve to ſayle by the Globe.
            NOw to ſayle by the Globe, it is conuenient to be ſpoken of. For that generally the moſt part of the ſeamen make their account as though the earth wer a platforme. For they do not conſider that the earth is a Globe, and that the Meridians do growe narrower and narrower towards the .2. poles, for it is vnpoſſible to drawe the face of the earth and the Sea true vpon a platforme, for if you wil deſcribe the lande true,You cannot drawe the Land & ſea true vpon a flat thing. then ſhall not the Sea be true, for as you go towardes the North partes, your Meridians growe togither, ſo as your lines or pointes be according to the arte of Hydrography, for the Sea ſhall be broader to the North partes than it is. Nowe and if you woulde deſcribe the Sea true, with lines, courſes, diſtances, hauens and daungers, then ſhoulde your lande be broader to the North partes than it is. As for enſā
               ple, thus: Englande and Scotlande being both one Ilande,To make a Sea plat or carde. in all your Cardes of Nauigation, the North parte of Scotland is drawn much bigger than it is, for otherwiſe the lines of South & North ſhoulde not be according to the treating of the lande, for if you viewe it well, you ſhall finde the North

ende of Scotlande much more in diſtance than it is. As you may ſee in meaſuring it by the trunke of youre carde there. For youre better vnderſtanding, I will ſhewe you the compaſſe of the earth vnder ſundrye Paralels or Circles, howe many myles the earthe doth contayne in compaſſe.The compaſſe of the earth. Fyrſt, vnder the Equinoctiall (where the earthe is at the greateſt compaſſe) in going directly Eaſte or Weaſte, that is, by a ryghte line ouer Sea and Lande, the two Poles being euen wyth your Horizon: you haue .21600. myles to come to the place you departed from.
                  The compaſſe of the earth vnder ye tropick of Cancer.
                  The artick circle of Lō
                     don vnder the Polare circle.
                Vnder the Tropicke of Cancer, the North Pole being rayſed .23. degrées .28. minutes, going directly Eaſt & Weſt: it is .19800. miles in compaſſe in our artick circle of London wher the pole artick is raiſed .15. deg. 32. minuts, going Eaſt & weſt: it is .13320. myles in compaſſe, then vnderneath the Polare circle where the Pole is rayſed ſixtie ſixe degrees, thirtie two minutes: it is .8460. miles in compaſſe. By this you ſée that the compaſſe of the Eaſt and Weaſt lyne (comming from the Equinoctiall) is muche leſſer to the North wardes than it is to the South wardes. Wherefore when you ſhall haue any occaſion to attempte any voyage to the North parts, it is beſt to ſayle by a Globe: for ſo ſhall you better ſee the diſtances and bigneſſe of the landes, and in like manner your lines and courſes. In this order, fyrſte (according to the accuſtomed manner) kéepe a perfitte accounte and reckoning of the waye of the ſhippe, by what lyne or poynte your Shippe hathe made hir waye good, then muſte you reſorte to youre Globe. After that conſider what place and Paralell you be in, whiche you maye doe by the Sunne by daye,How to vſe the globe to direct your courſe, and to knowe how that any place doth beare. and by the Starres by nyght. Nowe (knowing what place and Paralel you be in) ſette youre Globe to the eleuation of youre Pole: that doone, turne to the place of youre Zenith, and ſeeke the oppoſite of it in your Paralell: for then you knowe that in the ſame Paralell is youre Eaſte and Weaſte lyne: that had, the iuſte quarter of that circle to the Pole, muſte be deuided into the eight pointes of your compaſſe, doing ſo likewiſe on

the other ſide. In like caſe if you come to the Southwards, deuide your .8. wyndes from your Antarticke Pole, to youre Paralell circle: and thus muſt you doe euer and anon, for the oftner you do obſerue this cuſtome, the better & perfiter ſhal your courſe be. Now thus briefly I make an end of ye ſayling by the Globe. But for them that do occupie the Southparts, nothing is better than their cardes. Bycauſe I haue declared vnto you the length of certayne of the Paralels, what myles the Earth doth contayne in compaſſe vnder them, now wil I ſhew you how many myles diſtance is between euery one of them. And firſt,
                  The diſtāce between the equinoctiall and the tropick of Cancer.
                  Between ye artick circle of London & the tropick of Cancer.
                from the Equinoctiall to the Tropick of Cancer, (which is there where the Sun maketh his furtheſt progreſſe to the North partes) it is .1408. myles. Secondly, betwéen the tropick of Cancer & our Artick circle of Londō it is 1684. miles. Thirdly, between our Artick circle & the Polare circle is .900. myles. Laſtly, betwéene the Polare circle and the Pole is .1408. myles. So that it is in all from the Equinoctiall to eyther of the two Poles .5400. miles: whiche is the fourth part of the compaſſe of the whole Earth. Furthermore, for that you may the better vnderſtande that the Earth is a Globe or Circular (which any perſon that dothe occupie the Sea,The cauſe why that you may ſee the ſailes of a ſhip & not the whole. ſeeth moſt apparantly) you ſhall perceiue it thus, if you ſee a Shippe any thing farre off, you may perfitly ſée ye ſayles of it, but not the whole, the cauſe wherof is the circularneſſe of the earth and the water of the Sea: for that the water doth riſe and ſwell between you and the other ſhip, according to the diſtance between both the ſhips: bicauſe the diſtance to the center of the earth or water, is in euery place alike. And he that hath deſire to know further héerof, M. Dée hath made mention therof in Euclides Elamentes in his mathematical preface, & alſo in the .12. booke, whither you may haue recourſe, yet notwithſtanding I wil ſay a litle therof, wherby you may diſcerne how far it is poſſible to ſée a ſhip vpon the ſea: as thus: if you be on ye ſea in a ſhip, ſo yt ther be but halfe a league betwéene you and the other ſhip, the water wyll be fyue ynches and a halfe hygher in the middle of the waye

betwéene bothe the ſhips, for that the water is equall in euery place vnto the center of the earthe, and then the water going by a croked line, then to ſtrike it by a right line, the middle of the line that ſhoulde come from the center of the earth, ſhall be ſhorter than the other .2. lines comming from the center of the earth betweene the .2. ſhippes by .5. ynches and a halfe, and then it muſt néedes be ſayde, that the water is hygher by the ſaid .5. ynches and a halfe. And furthermore, if the two ſhippes were a league aſunder, then the water by his circulerneſſe ſhuld be .22. ynches hygher than the leuell in the middle betwéene both the ſhippes.To knowe howe many foote and ynches that the water is higher than the leuell or the ſea between two ſhips. Furthermore, if the .2. ſhips be 2. leagues aſunder, then the water ſhall be higher than the leuell in the middle betwéene bothe the ſhippes by .88. ynches, which is .7. foote and .4. ynches. If the .2. ſhippes be .3. leagues the one from the other, then the water ſhall be higher than the leuell in the midway betwéene both the ſhippes, by .198. inches, whiche is 16. foote and a halfe. Furthermore, if the .2. ſhippes be .4. leagues aſunder, the water ſhall be higher than the leuell in the midway betweene both the ſhippes by .252. ynches, which is .29. foote and .4. ynches. And furthermore, if the .2. ſhippes were .5. leagues aſunder, the water ſhoulde be higher than the leuell of the midway betwéene both the ſhips by .550. ynches, which is .46. foote lacking .2. ynches. Yet furthermore, if the .2. ſhips were .6. leagues aſunder, the water ſhould be higher than the leuell in the middle way betwéene them by .792. ynches, which is .66. foote. Furthermore alſo, if the .2. ſhippes were .7. leagues aſunder, the water ſhould be higher than the leuell in the midway between both the ſhips by .1878. ynches,What a ken is, and the cauſe why you may ſee a ſhip further out of the top then vpon the hatches. and that is .90. foote, whiche is as farre & rather farther than it is poſſible to ſée any ſhip vpon the Sea: Neyther is it poſſible to ſee any lande further, but ſuch lande as is very high lande, whiche for the greatneſſe of the heigth you may ſee it, wherfore .7. leagues or .6. leag. is called a ken. Now the circularneſſe of the earth is the cauſe that you may ſee a ſhippe or land further out of the top than, vpon the hatches:
            
               Wherefore it is a plaine caſe, that the Earth and Sea is not flat, but circular, as is afore declared. &c.
         
         
            ¶The .19. Chapter, is as touching the making of Plats or Cardes for the Sea, and not to paint their cards as they do, but rather to ſupply the vacant places with other neceſſarie matters: & alſo of three neceſſarie things contained in the plats or cardes, and their vſes, which is the moſt neceſſarie thing in Nauigation.
            FOr the making of Plats or Cards, as touching Hydrographia cōmonly called ſea Cards, I meane to ſay litle therof: for that it is ſufficiently declared in the booke called the art of Nauigation: Sauing this, I would wiſh thē that be the makers of plats and cardes for the Sea,Not to paint their Sea cards but to vſe ye vacant places with other neceſſary matters. not to paint their compaſſes with ſo many colours: neither vpon the Lande with ſo many flagges, for that it dothe rather hurte than good: althoughe it may be ſaide they be ſo painted in vacant places, thoſe vacant places I would wiſh them to furniſh with theſe 2. matters in this order. Firſte in ſome vacant place with a compaſſe there, to place againſt euery point of the half of the compaſſe, letters, or ſome other figures or carecters, then in like maner, (according to that place where ſuche a Moone maketh a full Sea) to make that letter or carecter at the hauen, port, or place. As for enſample thus: I place A at the Eaſt point, B at the Eaſt and by South, C at the Eaſt ſoutheaſt, D at Southeaſt and by Eaſt, and ſo conſequently to all the pointes vnto the Weaſt, then that being doone, where it floweth an Eaſte Moone. I place A in the platte or carde, and where an Eaſte and by South Moone, I doe place B in the carde, and ſo forthe, according to the place of the Moone that maketh a full Sea. And where it runneth halfe ſyde vnder

other,To draw ye ſhape of the lād in their cardes. to make ſome note vpon the poynt of the compaſſe. &c. This alſo is very neceſſarie to be done to furniſhe vp all the vacant places of the plat or carde, to drawe the ſhape or faſhion of euery headland or high lande alongſt euery coaſt that is needefull to be knowne, and at what poynte of the compaſſe the lande is of that faſhion: at howe farre off the lande ryſeth in that faſhion: and ſo to make the faſhion of the lande as often as the lande altereth the forme and faſhion: and laſt of all, at what poynte of the compaſſe the lande hathe that ſhape or faſhion: for being vpon one ſide, the lande ryſeth of one faſhion, and on the other ſide of an other forme or faſhion. Alſo being neare the lande it will be in one faſhion, and being far off in an other faſhion (as is before declared in the 14. Chapter) for there is nothing more needefull and neceſſary for a Seaman, than this: to knowe the lande when he ſéeth it, and there is no way better to make him remember it, than to haue notes howe the lande dothe riſe vpon euery ſide:Great infirmities by miſtaking any place. and what greater inconuenience may there growe by any meanes, than there may by miſtaking of a place? for it were twentie times better to be throughly perſuaded that he knoweth it not, than to thinke he doth knowe it not being that place. For whereas he doth thinke to preuent the dangers, he may willingly runne vpon the dangers not known of him. Therefore in my opinion they can do no better than to furniſh their vacant places in their plats and cards with this matter: for there can be nothing better. The vſe of the Sea cardes is moſt neceſſary for Nauigation for long voyages:How neceſſary a thing the ſea cardes be .3. neceſſarie things in ye ſea cardes. fyrſte for that it ſheweth you howe one place beareth from another: ſecondly, the diſtance of any places howe farre the one is from the other. Of whiche the one is repreſented by the lines of the compaſſe: the other by the ſcale or trunke of meaſure, if the platte be truely made. Thirdly, it ſheweth you in what Latitude from the Equinoctiall or Altitude of the pole any place is in, by the line of degrées. Now to directe youre courſe through the Sea by the carde to any

place aſſigned, you muſt firſt looke by what poynte of the cō
               paſſe it beareth from you, from the place you meane to ſette off from the lande, vnto the place you would fyrſt fall with.To knowe howe any place dothe beare from you by the carde. Which you ſhall know thus: ſeeke alyne from the next compaſſe vnto the place you meane to depart frō, then open your compaſſes vnto one of thoſe lynes by your iudgement that falleth neare vnto your place aſſigned: and let the other foote of your compaſſes ſtande iuſt at that place where your ſhip is, when you direct your courſe: that doone, beare your hands forwardes euen, and let the one ende be ſtill vpon the lyne to the whiche you did open your compaſſes, vntill you come to your place aſſigned. But if it falleth ſhort of the place aſſigned, then take the nexte line nearer vnto the place you departed from: when you haue ſo done, if your compaſſes doe ouer reache the place aſſigned, then take a lyne further off from the place you doe meane to ſet off from: and ſo ſhall you ſée by what poynte of the compaſſe the place aſſigned dothe beare from you. &c. If you would knowe howe farre the place aſſigned is from you,To knowe howe far it is vnto any place by the carde. ſet the one foote of the compaſſes vpon the place you departe from, and ſtretche out the other foote vnto the place aſſigned iuſte, that doone (ſtanding ſtill vnremoued) ſette them to the ſcale or trunke of meaſure, and that wil ſhew you iuſtly how many leagues it is iuſt frō the place of your departing vnto the place aſſigned. If the diſtance between the .2. places be more than the compaſſes will reach at once, then firſt ſet your compaſſes vnto the ſcale, opening the compaſſes vnto .100. leagues more or leſſe, as your ſcale and cōpaſſes will giue you leaue at your diſcretion, after that ſet ye one foot at the place of your departing, & the other foot of the cōpaſſes right towards the place aſſigned, as oftē times as ye diſtance between the .2. places doth require, & thereof (the cō
               paſſes being opened vnto .100. leagues) you may cōclude it to be ſo many .100. leag. vnto the place aſſigned as the cōpaſſes did ſhew vnto you: but if ther be any od meſure, thē opē your cōpaſſes to ye quātity, & ſet to thē ye ſcale, & it wil ſhaw you ye
               
iuſt contente of that meaſure, more than ſo many .100. leagues.To knowe what Latitude or heigth of ye pole any place hath by the carde. &c. Furthermore touching the third commoditie, which is to knowe what Latitude any place aſſigned hath: ſet one foote of the compaſſes vpon the place aſſigned, and open the compaſſes vnto the nexte Eaſte and Weaſt line, then carie that vnto the line of degrées (kéeping the foote of the compaſſes vpon the Eaſte and Weaſt lyne) it will ſhewe iuſtly the number of degrées that the Pole is aboue the Horizon. So of theſe thrée wayes, by the firſt is knowne by what poynt of the compaſſe any place beareth from you. By the ſeconde is knowne howe farre diſtance it is vnto any place aſſigned. And by the thirde is knowne in what heigth the Pole is in any place aſſigned. &c. Nowe (this being knowne) you maye with the more eaſe know howe to attaine to come vnto the port or place aſſigned. Yet furthermore, there is to be conſidered (in directing the courſe of a ſhip to any place aſſigned) what impediments may be by the way: as tydes, currents, or the ſcantneſſe of the wynde whiche may put the ſhip vnto the léewardes of his courſe,Things to be cōſidered by the M. or pilote of a ſhip. as alſo the ſurging of the Sea: And all this muſte be conſidered by the maiſter and Pilot of the ſhip. Likewiſe alſo in long voyages, the winde may oftē ſhifte vpon him, and ſometime the winde may be ſuch as he can not lye his courſe: wherefore he muſt kéepe a perfite account of the ſhips way, and conſider to know what point the ſhip hath made hir way good by. And at euery time that the wynde doth ſhifte, and the ſhip can not lye hir courſe, to note in the carde or plat in what place the ſhip may be: in hauing a ſpeciall regarde vnto the way of the ſhip, as touching the ſwiftneſſe or ſlowneſſe that the ſhippe goeth: and if ſo be the weather be cleare either by night or by day, to take the true Altitude of the Pole:They may correct the ſhips waye by the taking ye heigth of the Pole. for by that they may correcte the ſhips way, and giue a very neare geſſe howe the place (aſſigned to go vnto) doth bear from them, as alſo how farre it is thither, ſauing onely in the Eaſte and Weaſt courſe: and then they haue no other helpe but only the very account of the ſhippes

way. And to correct their deade reckning by the altitude of the Pole they muſt do this: (eſpecially if the ſhippe haue had often trauerſe by the means of contrary winds, ſo that ſhe could not lie hir courſe) conſider vpon the carde or plat how long the ſhip hath made hir way good for ſo many points as the ſhip hath ſayld by: then (if by the altitude of the Pole the ſhippe hathe gone more than the dead reckning did ſhewe you) repaire vnto the line of degrées, and ſet the one foote of the compaſſes vpon the degrée and place of the heigth of the Pole, and the other vpon the next eaſt and weſt lyne: that done, bear it vnto the place you ſuppoſe the ſhippe to be in: & thē bring forwards with the other compaſſes, what point of the Compas the ſhippe hath ſayled by, and at the meeting of the .2 paire of compaſſes make a note for the place that the ſhippe is in: from which place you may with your compaſſes ſee, how the place aſſigned dothe beare, and alſo how farre off you be from the ſame. Furthermore (if you find by the heigth of the Pole that you are not ſo farre ſhot as your reckning did ſhewe vnto you) you muſt pull backe ſo much from the point that the ſhippe hath ſayled by, as the heigth of the pole doth ſhew vnto you, by the order before reherſed &c. Furthermore (as I haue declared vnto you in the .14. Chapter going before) to knowe howe farre the land is off from you, knowing (as before) the diſtaunce betwéene any 2. places by ſetting the land with your compas,To knowe howe far yt the lande is of from you by the ſight of the lande with youre compaſſes to do it vpon the land. you may do the like by your card, as thus: you ſetting the .2. places with your compaſſe, do know that the .2. places be ſo many leagues aſunder, then ſhall you repaire to the card, and according to the bearing of the .2. places by the points of the compas, you (being thwart of one of theſe .2. places) ſhall replie it with your compaſſes vnto your ſcale: But for that in the ſcale the leagues be ſo ſmall, you may aſſigne .20. leagues to be but one league, and open the compaſſes vnto that proportion that the .2. places be aſunder, and the one of them doth beare from the other: that done, open the compaſſes againe

from the center of the compas vnto the place that you do imagin to be the land, and then reply it vnto the trunk of meaſure, you ſhall ſee howe many leagues you bee from the ſhore and ſo foorth. So that you may ſee that the plat or card is one of the neceſſarieſt things that is to be vſed in Nauigation. &c.
         
         
            ¶The .20. Chapiter is of the Longitude and declinatiō of .32. notable fixed Starres for Nauigation, with tables of their ſhining, and at what pointe of your compas they do both riſe and ſet: and alſo tables for euery moneth of the yeere, declaring at what houre and minute they be South, running from the firſt day of the moneth to the .15. and from the .15. to the laſt day, and will continue theſe 100. yeares without muche error.
            ANd furthermore I do thinke it conuenient for diuerſe conſiderations to ſhew the Longitude and declination of certaine of the moſt notableſt fixed Starres that are néere vnto the Equinoctiall,If the pole be rayſed more than 50. or .60. degrees, it is to hye to be obſerued by ye croſſe Staffe. Theſe Starres will ſerue beyond the Equinoctiall. to the number of .32. of them, whiche are very neceſſary for Nauigation in diuers reſpectes, as this: if you be vnto the North parts where the North pole is rayſed more than .50. or .60. degrees, then the North Starre is too hye to be obſerued or taken with the croſſe ſtaffe (as I haue declared in the .6. Chapter) and it may chaunce ſo that in the day the Sunne is not to be ſéene at noone, and then theſe Starres may ſerue your turne. And furthermore they be very good for them that haue occaſion to trauell beyonde the Equinoctiall where the North pole is vnder the Horizon, in vſing their declination as they do the Sunnes declination in all points, whiche doth appeare in the .7.8. and .9. Chapters of this book. And furthermore they be very neceſſary for Seafaring men to knowe the houre of the night:

both by their being vpon the Meridian,To knowe the riſing and ſetting of theſe Starres in all places by the order of the xi. Chapter The order of the table following. and alſo by their riſing and ſetting: you may know the true time of their riſing and ſetting in euery Latitude by their declination from the Equinoctiall, whether they decline to the South partes or North parts, as is declared by the declination of the Sun in the .11. chapter. And furthermore by any of theſe Starres you may trie the variatiō of your compas by night. &c. Now ſhal folow the table of all theſe Stars. The firſt row of this table conteineth the names of the Stars The ſeconde, the ſignes, that they be in Longitude. The thirde, the degrees in the ſignes. The .4. the minutes belonging therevnto. The .5. the degrees of declination. The .6. the odde minuts belonging therevnto. The .7. ſheweth towardes what port they decline by letters, of whiche S. ſignifieth Septentrionell or North declination. M. ſignifieth Meridionall or ſouth declination: as in the table doth appeare. The .8 doth ſhew nothing but the bigneſſe of the Starres. Now followeth the Table.

            ¶The .21. Chapter sheweth you the making of a generall inſtrument, to know the houre of the day by, throughout all the worlde.
            NOwe for the making of your inſtruments for the Sea, with their vſes, you ſhall repayre to the booke of Nauigation made by Martin Curtiſe a Spaniarde, Imprinted by M. Iugge Printer to the Quéenes Maieſtie: elſe I woulde haue ſhewed you the making of diuers inſtruments, as alſo the making of the equinoctiall diall with his vſe, whiche is very profitable to knowe the houre of the day by, in all latitudes through the whole worlde, for your compaſſe is not to knowe the houre of the day by in Sommer, neyther in the Morning nor Euening, neyther can you knowe when the Moone is eaſt or Weſt, ſhe hauing North declination, as béeing in the ſigne of Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, or Leo: bicauſe your compaſſe ſtandeth flatte as dothe your Horizon.
                  The ſunne and moone doth giue a full ſhadow by the compaſſe.
                  The Equinoctiall diall giueth a true ſhadowe all the world ouer.
                Wherfore it is very good for Sea menne to vſe the Equinoctiall dials, for that it ſheweth them the true houre of the day in all Latitudes, and alſo the Moone dothe giue a true ſhadowe in that Diall in all Latitudes, for I doe knowe that Sea men are very many times deceyued where it dothe flowe an Eaſt and Weſt Moone, or any poynt betwéene the Southeaſt and Northeaſt. Bicauſe in ſetting the Moone with their compaſſe (beeing in the North ſignes) ſhe ſéemeth to be Eaſt by the Compaſſe, when ſhe is neare the Eaſt Southeaſt in hir courſe: and in like manner when the Moone ſeemeeth Weſt by the compaſſe ſhe ſhall be a little more than Weſt Southweſt in hir courſe: which is a very perilous matter vnto them that ſhould put into a tide,A perilous matter. harborowe, or hauen, where he knoweth there is water inough for him if that he dothe come at a full Sea, and then by the error of the Moones ſhadowe of the compaſſe he is deceyued: and when he findeth the error he thinketh that the cauſe thereof commeth by the occaſion

of ſome ſtorme of wynde that is lyke to followe, imputing vnto it that the tyde dothe not kéepe hys courſe, whereas the very cauſe groweth by no other meanes but of receyuing a falſe ſhadowe by the Horizontall compaſſe: and eſpecially if the Moone be neare hir greateſt declination vnto the North partes, that is, in the ſigne of Gemini and Cancer. And alſo that effect is moſt preferred if the Dragons head be in the beginning of the ſigne of Aries: for that then if the Moone be in the beginning of Cancer, ſhe ſhall haue .5. degrées more in declination from the Equinoctiall, than the ſunne ſhall haue at their greateſt declination vnto the North partes: ſo that reſeruing the Moones Paralex, which is according vnto the Latitude of any place that the Moone ſhal be declined .28. degrées and a halfe vnto the North part of the Equinoctiall: ſo that for auoyding of theſe infirmities,The moone may decline 28. degrees and a halfe from the Equinoctiall. I woulde wiſhe them to vſe the Equinoctiall dials. And furthermore I do thinke that the Equinoctiall dials be not vſed amongſt our Mariners héere in Englande for that the charges is ſo muche in the making of them, & yet it ſerueth no other turne but to know the houre of the day, & to ſhew the true ſhadowe of the Moone. I haue not knowne thē vſed by any Engliſh Maſter or Pylot, but only by one man, which perſon had not it for the proper vſe therof, but rather had it, to ſay that he had ſuche an inſtrument as no Engliſh man had the like, & to bragge that he had ſuch an inſtrument that he could do great feates therewith in the going of long viages. &c.Of mē that wil haue inſtruments, and knowe not the vſe of them. I would haue no man offended with me. I know the nature and qualitie of ſome that take charge: they will haue inſtruments & other things thervnto apperteyning, & yet they thē ſelues do not know ye vſe of thē, yet they will ſeeme to be cunning, & that they néede no inſtructiōs of any man, for that they know all things, & yet in reſpect know nothing. (But notwithſtanding) I would wiſh them that be Sea faring men to vſe them ſelues to the Equinoctiall dials: for that they doe ſerue two notable turnes, as well at home in theſe our chanels, as alſo in long viages: they

may make them with a very eaſie charge: for whereas in the Arte of Nauigation it is ſhewed howe to make them in braſſe, they may make them with wood in this manner: take a péece of bordes ende of ſixe inches broad,An eaſie waye to make an equinoctiall diall with little charge more or leſſe at your diſcretion, and halfe an inche in thickneſſe, then hauing cutte it rounde, and playned it ſmoothe, you maye eyther graue in it the .32. poyntes of the compaſſe, or elſe paynt them vpon it with ſome colours, with the .24. houres vpon bothe the ſides: as this figure ſheweth.
            
            That done take a wyre of iuſt the Diameter of the Inſtrument, and put it through the middle or centre of the Inſtrument, then make it faſte that the one ende be halfe way thoroughe on the one ſide, and the other halfe on the other ſide, this done make a frame with thrée péeces of bordes endes to

hang the diall or inſtrument vpō, with one pinne on the Eaſt poynt and an other on the Weſt poynt: then take an other peece of boardes endes being ſquare, and with a payre of compaſſes ſtrike a quarter of a circle of iuſte the bigneſſe of the quarter of the diall, and cutte all that away, and then the reſt of the ſquare that is left, (at the edge of the quarter of the circle) deuide into .90. equall partes, marking it thus .10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.90. as in this 
forme: laſt of all let this be placed in the middle of the frame, ſo that .90. may ſtand right vnder the verie middle of the diall and there made faſt, in ſuche forme that the very ende of the wyer when the diall is put vp and downe may touche the hollow parte that you ſee cut away, which is called the Directer, and ſo it is finiſhed, and will ſtand altogether in this forme.
            
               The Equinoctiall Diall.
            
            
               The vſe of this Diall is moſte neceſſarie in a ſhippe, for that you haue occaſions to tranſporte your ſelues into all the clymates. And to know the true houre of the day doe this: ſet this Diall by your compaſſe (the Directer vnto the Southewardes) and then (you knowing how hie the pole is aboue the Horizon) ſet the ende of the wyer right againſt that degrée in the directer, and the other ende of the wier will poynt iuſte vnto the pole, then looke what ſhadowe the wyer doth giue by the Sunne, that is the true houre of the daye. In lyke manner you may know the true houre of the night by the Moones ſhadowe, and alſo the Moone will giue a true ſhadowe of hir place. &c.

Thus muche haue I ſayde for the entrance of the Sléeue, to come to the riuer of Thames,The higth of the pole at the entrāce of the Sleeue. and in the entrance in the midway betwéene Vſhant and the Lizarde the pole Articke is eleuated .50. degrées and a halfe, and the Equinoctiall is lifted aboue the Horyzon .39. degrees and a halfe. And furthermore for them that are channellers and occupiers amongſt ſandes and banckes, and ſuch other like, they muſte haue conſideracion of theſe things followyng.Neceſſary things to be noted for thē that are Chānellers & dealers amongſt ſandes. As this: firſte (if you knowe how the channell doth lie right betwéene any .2. ſandes) you muſt view the land to take ſome markes for it, in this manner to be a leadyng marke. And that you ſhall do thus: looke ſomething that ſtandeth farre into the lande, that you may knowe it well being right open with the channell of the ſandes, then take an other marke neare vnto the water ſide, and the one to be right agaynſt the other, when that you be in the middle of the channell, and then you knowing theſe twoo markes well, they will be leading markes vnto you for euer to keepe that channell. And then furthermore if it dothe ſo happen that the channell doth turne to kéepe an other courſe, or els (ſome other daunger lying in the way) you muſte haue a thwarte marke to know bothe when that you are cleare of any daunger, and alſo when that you are open of an other channell, and that you ſhall do as before is declared, to take ſome marke within the lande, and alſo an other neare vnto the ſea, water or riuer ſide, to be your thwarte marke when you bring them both together. And this is moſte ſpecially to be noted: that theſe markes be very yare and good when the one is farre diſtant from the other: and thoſe markes very ſlowe and aſketh ſome diſtance in ſayling to open and ſhette them, whiche are neare together vpon the lande. And furthermore, for them that are Channellers or occupiers amongeſt ſandes, for that the weather is not alwaies cleare, when they haue occaſion to paſſe thorowe ſuche places, it is good for them to ſounde the channelles perfitely, and to know by the depthe, what ſide of the channell they are vpon, and alſo howe farre

they are ſhotte into that channell. And alſo in like manner to know by the ſounding of any of the ſides of the channell, whether they be neare any of the ſandes or daungers, or any breadth of: for yt ſome ſandes or daūgers there be hauing fayre or good ſoundings or ſhaldings, that they may borrowe of and on at their pleaſure. There be againe ſome ſandes and daungers that there is no borrowing nor ſounding of them, and thoſe be neall or déepe, harde vnto the ſandes or daungers: for that the water is déepe harde vnto the ſande: and theſe are verie daungerous ſandes for any ſhippe to come neare, for that they ſhall haue the water verie déepe, and by and by be a grounde. Yet furthermore it is very good for them that be channellers and occupiers amongſt ſandes, to know whiche way the tide doth ſet at euery time of the tide: for that many times it happeneth ſo, that when the ſandes be vnder the water, the tide doth ſet croſſe the channell, which is a daungerous matter if it be not very well conſidered by the Maſter or Pilote. &c.
         
         
            ¶The .23. Chapter, is as touching the variatiō of the Compaſſe, called the Northeaſting and the Norweſting of the Compaſſe: and how to giue a geſſe to know the Longitude.
            AS touching the variation of the cōpaſſe called the Northeaſting or Norweſting, it is ſuppoſed that the Compaſſe doth varie by proportiō, in the ſayling to the Eaſtwards or Weſtwardes: and (as I haue declared in the end of the .6. chapter) if it varieth by proportion that the Northpoint is varied one poynt from the North at .22. degrees and a halfe,Of the cō
                  paſſe to varie by euen proportion. and ſo vntill the North point doth ſtande Northeaſt or Norweſt. And that is, when you are .90. degrées from the Meridian that the compas was made at to the Eaſtwardes or Weſtwards. Some alſo are of an other opiniō, that the compas doth varie

by no proportion,Of the cō
                  paſſe to vary by no proportion. but dothe varie according vnto the nature of ſome kinde of mineralles, that is, in ſome countrie or ſome kynde of Ilandes, that drawe the Compaſſe by the mines of the Loade ſtone or Magnes ſtone that they tauche their compaſſe with when they make them. And furthermore the booke of Martine Curtiſe, (called the arte of Nauigation) ſayeth that the compaſſe doth varie by proportion, in this mā
               ner: which is, by the proportion of a circle: for that the North poynt dothe alwayes poynt vnto a place in the heauens that is vnmoueable, and therefore as you do tranſporte your ſelfe to the Eaſtwarde or Weſtwarde, the North poynt doth ſtill poynt vnto that place in the heauen:Of ye compaſſe to varie according vnto the proportion of a circle, that is ſwiftly & ſlowly. wherefore (as he ſayeth) when you be .90. degrées in Longitude from the place of the making of your compaſſe, that is, when you be one quarter of the circumference of the earth, in that paralell the compaſſe will be varied .4. poynts from the North: and as you do tranſporte your ſelfe further, then the Northe poynt of the compaſſe will come nearer and nearer vnto the North: and when you are iuſt halfe the circumference of the earth, that then the North poynt will ſtande due Northe vpon the pole agayne: for that you are come to the ſame Meridian againe vpon the oppoſite part of the earth, (as it doth appeare in the third part and .5. chapter, of the ſaide booke of Martine Curtiſe) but if that be true then the compaſſe doth varie ſwiftely at the firſt and ſlowly afterwardes in order like vnto the Sunnes declination: by whiche (if it be true) they may very well knowe what order the compaſſe doth varie by, and ſo by the variation you may giue an neare eſtimation of the Longitude, and knowe in howe many degrées the compaſſe is varied one poynte, twoo poynts, thrée poynts, and ſo the greateſt variation whiche is foure poynts. Nowe to know the proportion doe this: Firſte, make a circle with a payre of compaſſes, and ſtryke a Line by the Center to the circumference, which ſhall be your Meridian lyne, then ſtryke an other lyne by the Center a croſſe, that you may deuide the circle into foure

equall partes,To know in how many degrees goyng but the Eaſtwarde or Weſtwarde that the cō
                  paſſe doth varie one poynt or .2. points or .3. points. &c. and then (for that fourtie fiue degrées is the greateſt variation) ſette fourtie fiue vnto the Eaſte parte and Weſt parte, deuidyng euery one of the quarters of the circle into fourtie fiue equall partes, accordyng to the greateſt variation then make an other circle of that Diameter, that the circumference touche the Center of that Circle: and deuide it as you deuide the Compaſſe after the rate of twoo and thirtie poyntes although you néede not deuide but that ſide to the Norwardes, and then the Northeaſt and Norweſt point will fall vpon fourtie fiue degrées: that done drawe lynes accordyng to the poyntes of the Compaſſe vnto the Eaſtwardes or Weſtwardes, and looke howe they fall vpon the lyne that commeth from the Center of the other Circle of whiche euery quarter is diuided into fourtie fiue equall partes: and then (at the very place that the lyne doothe touche) drawe paralell lynes in that Circle by proportion, at the very place to the Eaſtewardes or Weſtwardes that the lyne of the Compaſſe falleth vpon: and that will ſhewe you iuſtly howe many degrées you ſhall tranſporte your ſelfe vnto the Eaſtwardes or Weſtwardes, for the varying of the firſte poynte, ſeconde poynte, and thirde poynte, and in lyke manner the greateſt variation whiche is the fourthe poynte. So that (accordyng to that order) it will fall out in this manner, that the Compaſſe will be varied one point at neare eleuen and ⅓.
               To knowe how many degrees is in the varying of one poynt. It will be varied two poyntes neare aboute foure and twentie degrées and a halfe. It will be varied thrée poyntes at fourtie twoo degrées, and aboute a halfe. But it will not be varied the fourth point vntill you be full foure ſcore and tenne degrées from the Meridian that the compaſſe was made at: whiche is a very ſlow varying beyng .47. degrées and ½ before the Compaſſe dothe varie one poynt, and betwéene the thirde poynt and the ſeconde poynt beyng .18. degrées for the varying of that poynt, and then from the ſeconde poynte vnto the fyrſte poynte, it

is .13. degrées and better, and laſt of all from the varying of one poynt to the Meridian it is .11.
               If you wil know howe many leagues a degree is, repayre to the 16. chapter. degrées and ⅓ parte, euery degree beyng according to the parralel you are in, which dothe alter according vnto your Latitude from the Equinoctiall: for vnder the Equinoctiall it is, 60. Engliſhe miles, or .20. Engliſh leagues vnto one degrée. In the Latitude of .60. degrées from the Equinoctiall there in that parralell it is but .30. myles, or .10. Engliſhe leagues vnto one degrée. &c. as it is plainely ſhewed in the .16. chapter of this booke, wherein is an inſtrument ſhewing you howe many miles of Longitude will anſwere vnto a degrée in euery ſeuerall Latitude by the replying of a threed at your diſcretion: ſo that I conclude if the compas doth varie by that ordre of proportion that Martine Curtiſe dothe attributs vnto it, you may giue a neare gheſſe to finde the Longitude by the varying of the compas beyng neare vnto the Meridian that the compas was made for. But if you be very farre from the Meridian that the compas was made for, then the variation is ſo ſlowe that you can haue no iudgement at all (by the variation of the compas) to finde any Longitude. And furthermore if the compas dothe varie by that proportion that Martine Curtiſe doth affirme, I am of that opinion that there may growe ſome errour in proportion in thoſe compaſſes that are made for any Meridian:There may growe ſome errour in ye proportion of the varying of the Compaſſe. for thoſe compaſſes that are made here with vs in Englande whereof the needle dothe ſtande .4. or .5. degrées vnto the Eaſtwards of ye North (as doth appeare by all the néedles made for dials & alſo in the compaſſes) if they would haue the North point to ſtande due North, then the ende of the wyers vnder the carde of the compaſſe ſhould ſtande foure or fiue degrees vnto the Eaſtwards of the Flouredeluce: wherefore it may be doubted that the compaſſe maye varie more the one way than it will the other way, by that proportion that the ende of the wyre dothe ſtande beſide from the North poynt. For (if in the greateſt variation) the ende of the wyre (vnder the carde of the compaſſe) doth ſtande Northweſt, the flouredeluce

of the compaſſe ſhould ſtande neare halfe a poynt to the Weſtwards of the Northweſt. And in like maner at the greateſt variation, if the ende of the wyre doth ſtande Northeaſt, then the Flouredeluce ſhould ſtande neare halfe a poynt vnto the Northwards of the Northeaſt. &c. And furthermore heere is one thing that I could neuer vnderſtande the truthe of, and yet I haue oftentimes demaunded the queſtion of dyuers that haue beene in the Weſt part, in the bay of America,
               Thinges that I can not know. and that is this: Whether in the compaſſe there made, or in the dials that are there made, the endes of the Nedles doe ſtande due North, or not? and yet it hath not beene my chaūce to méete with any that can tell. For if it be ſo that thoſe Nedles that are there touched doe ſtande due North, th
                  •
               n it were very good for them that ſhould occupie long trauerſe vnto the Weſtwarde or Eaſtwarde, to haue diuers compaſſes ready made with the Néedle of them vntouched, and to carie a good Lodeſtone with them to touche thoſe compaſſes when the compaſſe hath the greateſt variation. It is good for theſe two cauſes: the one cauſe: it is the better to direct your courſe by. But this cauſe is very ſpeciall, to giue a neare geſſe of the Longitude, that is to ſay, the compaſſe will varie more quickly (according to the order before written) by which you ſee they may tranſporte them ſelues further vnto the Eaſtwards or Weſtwardes before that the compaſſe dothe varie one poynt, than it dothe for the other three poynts, ſo that they are not able to giue any eſtimation at all,Of ſlowe varying of the cōpaſſe. by the varying of the compaſſe, to knowe any Longitude: for that they may trauel more than the quarter of the circumference of the earth, before the compaſſe will be varied one poynt backewardes and forwardes. And I do very muche maruell at this, (conſidering how many times Engliſh men haue bene in the weſt Indies) that I can meete with no man that can tell whether the needels of the Dials or compaſſes made there do ſtande due Northe or not: whiche is a thing that may be eaſily knowne. For the needels of the Dials it is ſ

               ene ſéene, and in

like maner of the Compaſſes:How eaſy it is to knowe whether yt the cōpaſſes made in the Weſt Indies▪ do ſtād due North. for if the Néedle of the Compaſſes there made will not ſtande due North, then it is reformed vpon the Carde of the flye of the Compaſſe, as if the North ende of the wyers doe ſtande Northeaſt, then they wil ſet Northeaſt ouer it, euen as we doe ſet the ende of the wyers of the Compaſſes with vs made neare halfe a poynt to the Eaſtwardes of the Northe. &c. And furthermore it is very good for them that are Maſters or Pylotes of ſhippes to note,Of making notes of the variation. when they doe fall with any lande where the Compaſſe is varied, to make a remembrance in a booke howe many poyntes and degrees the Cōpaſſe is varied in euery place where they come vnto, which will be a great helpe for them to finde that place agayne. And to finde the variation it is declared in the 6. Chapter. And héere I leaue to trouble thée any further for this time: but ſhortly after this, looke for two other workes of myne, the one called, The ſhoting in great Ordinance: an other named, A Treaſure for Trauellers: which two Bookes will be profitable I truſt for all men. If theſe my labours may profite my Countrey, then haue I my deſire. And thus I bid thee moſte hartily farewell.
