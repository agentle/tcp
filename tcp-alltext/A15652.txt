            THE SATYRE TO THE MEERE COVRTIERS.
            SIrs, I doe know your mindes, you looke for fees,
            For more respect then needes, for caps and knees:
            But be content, I haue not for you now,
            Nor will I haue at all to doe with you.
            For though I seeme opprest, and you suppos
                  •
               
            
            I must be faine to crouch to Vertues foes;
            Yet know, your fauours I doe now slight more
            In this distress
                  •
               , then er'e I did befor
                  •
               .
            
               Here to my Liege a message I must tell,
            If you will let me passe, yo
                  •
                shall doe well;
            If you de

                admittance, why then know,
            I meane to haue it where you will or no.
            Your formall wisedomes which hath neuer beene
            In ought yet (saue in venting fashions) seene,
            And deemes that man wa
                  •
                borne to no intent
            But to be train'd in Apish complement,
            Doth now (perhaps) suppose me vndiscreet,
            And such vn-vsed messages vnmeet.
            But what of that? Shall I goe sute my matter
            Vnto your wits, that haue but wit to flatter?
            
               Shall I, of your opinions so much prize
            To loose my will, to haue you thinke me wise,
            Who neuer yet to any liking had,
            Vnlesse he were a Knaue, a Foole, or mad?
            
            You Mushromes know, so much I weigh your powers
            I neither value you, nor what is yours.
            Nay, though my crosses had me quite out-worne,
            Spirit enough Id'e finde your spight to scorne:
            Of which resolu'd, to further my aduenter,
            Vnto my KING, without your leaues I enter.
         
         
            
            TO THE HONEST COVRTIERS.
            BVt You, whose onely worth doth colour giue
            To them, that they doe worthy seeme to liue,
            Kinde Gentlemen; your ayde I craue, to bring
            A SATYRE to the presence of his King:
            A show of rudenesse doth my forehead Arme,
            Yet you may trust me, I will doe no harme:
            He that hath sent me, is a subiect true,
            And one whose loue (I know) is much to you:
            But now he lies bound to a narrow scope,
            Almost beyond the Cape of all good hope,
            
            
               Long hath he sought to free himselfe, but failes:
            And therefore seeing nothing else preuailes,
            
               Me, to acquaint my Soueraigne, here he sends,
            As one despayring of all other friends.
            I doe presume that you will fauour shew me,
            Now that a Messenger from him you know me:
            For many thousands that his face nere knew
            Blame his Accusers, and his Fortune rue:
            And by the helpe which your good word may d
                  ••
               .
            He hopes for pitty from his Soueraigne to.
            Then in his presence with your fauours grace me,
            And there's no Vice so great, shall dare out-face me.
         
      
      
         
            
            TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAIESTY.
            A Satyre.

               eo?
            VVHat once the POET said, I may avow,
            Tis a hard thing not to write Satyres now,
            
            Since what we speake, abuse raignes so in all,
            Spight of our hearts will be Satyricall.

            Though in the Cage, my olde harsh notes I sing,
            And rudely make a Satyre here vnfold
            What others would in neater tearmes haue told.
            And why? my friends and meanes in Court are scant,
            Knowledge of curious Phrase, and forme, I want.
            I cannot bear't to runne my selfe in debt,
            To hire the Groome, to bid the Page intreat
            Some fauour'd follower; to vouchsafe his word,
            To get me a colde comfort from his Lord:
            
            
               I cannot sooth, though it my life might saue,
            Each fauourite, nor crouch to euery Knaue:
            
            I cannot brooke delayes as some men do,
            With scoffes, and scornes, and tak't in kindnesse to.
            For er'e I'de binde my selfe for some slight grace
            To one that hath no more worth then his place;

            Is worse to me then tortures, rackes, and chaines:
            
            And therefore vnto thee I onely flye,
            To whom there needes no meane but Honesty:

            To thee that do'st what thou wilt vndertake▪
            
            For loue of Iustice, not the persons sake.
            To thee that kno'wst how vaine all faire shewes be,
            That flow not from the hearts sincerity.
            And canst▪ though shadowed in the simplest vaile,
            Discerne both Loue and Truth, and where they faile:
            To thee doe I appeale, in whom heau'n knowes,
            I next to God my confidence repose.
            For can it be, thy grace should euer shine,
            And not enlighten such a cause as mine?
            
               Can my hopes (fixt in thee great KING) be dead?
            Or thou those Satyres hate thy Forrests bred?
            Where shall my second hopes he founded then,
            If euer I haue heart to hope agen?
            Can I suppose a fauour may be got
            In any place when thy Co

                when I miss't of thee?
            Or if I did, can I haue comfort by it,

               No, were I sure, I to thy hate were borne,
            The loue of halfe the world beside I'de scorne.
            But why should I thy fauour here distrust,
            That haue a cause so knowne, and knowne so iust?
            Which not alone my inward comfort doubles,
            But all suppos'd me wrong'd that heare my troubles.
            Nay, though my fault were Reall, I beleeue,
            Thou art so Royall that thou wouldst forgiue.
            For well I know thy sacred M

            And at thy gentlene
                  •
                the world hath wondred,
            For making Sunshine, where thou mightst haue thundred.
            
               Yea, thou in mercy life to them didst giue
            That could not be content to see thee liue.
            And can I thinke that thou wilt make me, then,
            The most vnhappy of all other men?
            Or le

            Be punisht more for Loue, then some for Treason?
            
            No, thou didst neuer yet thy glory staine,
            With an iniustice to the meanest Swaine.
            
            'Tis not thy will I'me wrong'd, nor dost thou know
            If I haue suffred iniuries or no.
            For if I haue not heard false Rumours flye,
            Th'a

               And if it were so (as the world thinkes 'twas)
            I cannot see how it should come to passe
            That thou, from whose free tongue proceedeth nought
            Which is not correspondent with thy thought.
            Those thoughts to, being fram'd in Reasons mould,
            Should speake that once, which should not euer hold.
            But passing it as an vncertaintie,
            I humbly begge thee, by that Maiestie,
            
            Whose sacred Glory strikes a louing-feare
            Into the hearts of all, to whom 'tis deare:
            To deigne me so much fauour, without merit,
            As reade this plaint, of a distempred spirit:

            Gainst all the world to play the Satyrist:
            
            Twas I, that made my measures rough, and rude,
            Daunce arm'd with whips, amid'st the multitude,
            And vnappalled with my charmed Scrowles,

            Men should admire the power of Poesie.
            
            And those that dar'd her greatnesse to resist,
            Quake, euen at naming of a Satyrist.

            Should cry God blesse vs, as they did at thunder.
            Alas! my lines came from me too too dully,
            They did not fill a Satyres mouth vp fully.
            
               Hot bloud, and youth, enrag'd with passion
                  •
                store,
            Taught me to reach a straine nere touch'd before.
            But it was coldly done, I throughly chid not:
            And somewhat there is yet to doe, I did not.
            More soundly could my scourge haue yerked many,
            Which I omit not, cause I feared any.
            For want of action, discontentments rage,
            
            Base dis-respect of Vertue (in this age)
            With other things, vnto my selfe a wrong,
            Made me so fearelesse, in my carelesse long:
            That had not reason within compasse wonne me,
            I had told Truth enough to haue vndo
                  •
               e me:

            And vn
                  •
               eene power, can doe no more then mine.)
            For though fore-seeing warinesse was good,
            I fram'd my stile, vnto a milder mood,
            And clogging her thigh-towring wing
                  •
                with mire,
            Made her halfe earth, that was before all fire.
            Then being (as you saw) disguis'd in shew,
            Clad like a Satyre, brought her forth to view:
            Hoping, (her out-side being mis-esteem'd)
            She might haue passed, but for what she seem'd:
            Yet some, whose Comments iumpe not with my minde
            In that low phrase, a higher reach woul
                  •
                finde.
            
               And out of their deepe iudgement seeme to know,
            What 'tis vncertaine if I meant or no:
            Ayming thereby, out of some priuate hate,
            To worke my shame, or ouerthrow my state.
            For amongst many wrongs my foe doth doe me,
            And diuers imputations, laid vnto me,
            Deceiued in his ayme, he doth mis-conster
            That which I haue enstil'd a Man-like Monster,
            
            To meane some priuate person in the state,
            Whose worth, I thinke to wrong out of my hate;
            Vpbraiding me I from my word doe start,
            Either for want of a good Ground, or Heart,
            
            
               Cause from his expectation I doe vary
            In the denying of his Commentary,
            
            Whereas 'tis knowne I meant Abuse the while,

            But say I grant that I had an intent
            To haue it so (as he interprets) meant,
            And let my gracious Liege, suppose there were
            One whom the State may haue some cause to feare,
            Or thinke there were a man (and great in Court)
            That had more faults then I could well report,
            
               Suppose I knew him, and had gone about
            By some particular markes to paint him out,
            That he best knowing his owne faults might see,
            He was the Man I would should noted be:
            Imagine now such doings in this Age,
            
            And that this man so pointed at should rage,
            Call me in question, and by his much threatning,
            By long imprisonment, and ill intreating,
            Vrge a Confession: wer't not a mad part
            For me to tell him what lay in my heart?
            Doe not I know a great mans Power and Might,

            And that the truth I told should in conclusion▪
            
            For want of Power, and Friends, be my confusion?
            I know it, and the world doth know 'tis true;

               I protest, if such a man I knew,

            So farre I'le be (though Fate against me run)
            From starting off, from that I haue begun,
            
               I vn-appalled dare in such a case
            Rip vp his foulest Crimes before his face,
            Though for my Labour I were sure to drop
            Into the mouth of Ruine without hope.
            But such strange farre-fetcht meanings they haue sought,
            As I was neuer priuy to in thought:
            And that vnto particulars would tye
            Which I intended vniuersally.
            Whereat some, with displeasure ouer-gone,
            Those I scarce dream'd of, saw, or thought vpon▪
            
            Maugre those caueats, on my Satyres brow,
            Their honest, and iust passage disallow.
            
               And on their heads so many censures rake,
            That spight of me, themselues they'le guilty make.
            Nor is't enough to swage their discontent,
            To say I am (or to be) Innocent.
            
            For as, when once the Lyon made decree▪
            
            No horned beast should nigh his presence be,
            That, on whose fore-head onely did appeare,
            A bunch of flesh, or but some tuft of haire,
            
            Was euen as farre in danger as the rest,
            If he but said, it was a horned beast:
            
            So, there be now, who thinke in that their power,
            Is of much force, or greater farre then our;
            
               It is enough to proue a guilt in me▪
            
            Because (mistaking) they so think't to be.
            Yet'tis my comfort, they are not so high▪
            
            But they must stoope to thee and equity.
            
            And this I know, though prick't, they storme agen
            The world doth deeme them ne're the better men.
            To stirre in filth, makes not the stench the lesse,
            Nor doth Truth feare the frowne of Mightinesse.

            Nor is't a wonder, as some doe suppose,
            My Youth so much corruption can disclose;
            Since euery day the Sunne doth light mine eyes,
            I haue experience of new villanies:

            But oh knew I, what thou would'st well approue,
            Or might the small'st respect within thee moue;
            So in the sight of God it might be good,
            And with the quiet of my conscience stood,

            Would command nothing against Piety,)
            There's nought so dangerous, or full of feare,
            That for my Soueraignes sake I would not dare.

            Of thy displeasure, in this loathsome thrall.
            For notwithstanding in this place I lye

            That in my owne (and iust) defence I feare
            To vse the free speech that I doe intend,

            Makes those faults mine, which others perpetrate?
            What man could euer any Age yet finde
            That spent his Spirits in this thanklesse kinde
            Shewing his meaning, to such words could tye it▪
            
            That none should either wrong▪ or mis-apply it?
            Nay, your owne Lawes, which (as you doe intend)
            In plain'st and most effectuall words are pend,
            Cannot be fram'd so well to your intent,
            But some there be will erre from what you meant.
            
               And yet (alas) must I be ty'd vnto
            What neuer any man before could doe?
            Must all I speake, or write, so well be done,
            That none may picke more meanings thence then one?
            Then all the world (I hope) will leaue dis-vnion.
            And euery man become of one opinion.

            The best intentions mine, and others leaue:
            
               Chiefly in that, where I fore-hand protest,
            My meaning euer was the honestest.
            And if I say so, what is he may know
            So much as to affirme it was not so?
            Sit other men so neere my thought to show it?
            Or is my heart so open that all know it?
            Sure if it were, they would no such things see,
            As those whereof some haue accused me.
            But I am carelesse how't be vnderstood,
            Because the Heauens know my intent was good.
            
               And if it be so, that my too free Rimes

            Tis not my fault, for had I beene imploy'd
            In something else, all this had now beene voyd.
            Or if the world would but haue granted me
            Wealth, or Affaires, whereon to busie me,
            I now vnheard of, peraduenture than,
            Had beene as mute as some rich Cleargie-man.

            There's nothing can befall me that I feare:
            For if thou hast compassion on my trouble,

            And if I fall, it may some Glory be,
