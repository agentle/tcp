               THe .xii. prouffyte of trybulacyon is that trybulacyon is a certeyn token of loue that god hath towarde hym that it is ſente to Wherof he ſayde. ¶Quos amo arguo et caſtigo. ¶Hym that I loue I vndernymme and chaſtyle / And alſo Salamon ſayde Eccleſiaſtici. ¶Qui diligit fililiū aſſidua et flagella· He that loueth his ſon he ſcourgyth hym ofte tyme. ¶Wherof ſayde ſaynte Ierome.

¶Summus pater Iheſus Chriſtus filios ſuos ſemper ſub aliquo flagello vel virga retinet vt / quando eripiuntur ab vno ſub alio capiuntur. ¶Oure ſouereyne lorde Iheſu cryſte kepyth euer / his chyldren vnder a ſcourge or a rodde And whan they ben deliuered of one / they ben caughte vnder / a nother / But oure gode meke fader and lorde ſente not alle his ſcourgis at ones to geder / but one after a nother knowynge oure freelte / For he wyl that noo man peryſſhe / but he wyll all men be ſafe / But euyll men and vnkynde that byleue hym not ne louen hym the whiche lyuen here wythoute ſcourge of of trybulacion.

Why is the takynge of euylle thȳges ſhewȳge or token of ye loue of god more thā ye takynge of gode thȳges. To this maye be anſweryd
