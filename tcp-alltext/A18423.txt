very auncient and la
                  •
               dable custome, in the best gouerned
common-wealthes, to admit and fauourably to
allow interludes and discourses vpon the Stage for diuers
reasons; but especially two. The one, to entertaine the welconditioned
people with some delightfull and fruitfull conceits,
thereby as it were to deceiue idlenes of that time which
it had allotted for worse purposes. The other, for the iust
reprehension of such as with serious and more graue aduisings
cannot or will not be so freely admonished and corrected.
The later of these two respects hath begotten this
Dialogue, ready to b
                  •
                acted, principally and specially pointing
that Impe which is infortunately fostered vp to this
day, to ruine it selfe with infamy. Onely this comfort is afforded,
that if he be present, and withall silent, he may suppose
that of all others it concernes not him. If hee be absent
(as most likely he is) then euery other that findes himselfe
parcell guilt may see the deformity, and forbeare the excesse.
Other touches and passages are, which our Author and wee
present not with minde to offend any, but to please the weldisposed.
And so in the name of all the rest I entreate

                  HOw much wee that haue beene trauailers
differ from other kindes of
people? So soone as we arriue, we
are attended to the Burse or Randevou

as if the whole world hath neede to
be informed, yea and directed by vs
in matters of greatest moment; such
as is trafficke and commerce with forraine nations, and the
state and disposition of those kingdomes through which we
haue passed. For it may be we can giue intelligence of preparations
and invasions. We can demonstrate their strength
and munition. We can number their Captaines and Generals.
We can discouer their designes and confederates. And
finally, we can lay plots to crosse and make voide all their
purposes, and stratagems, which these home-bred and countrie
spunne people can neuer attaine vnto. Therefore by
good right we are had in esteeme, and speciall request, and
courteously receiued of Councellors of state wheresoeuer

gold nor gaine, nor be pensioners to any Monarche: but
with desire to see more we passe through all gouernements,
vnchecked and vncontrolled, because we take part with
none, offend, none, nor are false to any. And this life wee
loue aboue all liues, not content with any life, but that
which seekes an other life.

                  Pro.
                  Newes I haue none but ordinary to tell you. With
the state I shall haue some businesse. And in my company
came ouer an old acquaintance of yours, one Segnieur Antonio,
a man of extraordinary action and faction.
               
               
                  Simp.
                  If it be the man I contiecture him to be▪ his name

                  That's the man. But wee call him Segnieur Antonio,
by reason of his trauailers in Italy and other places.
               
               
                  Simp.
                  As he hath chang'd his name and countrey, hath
he not altered his conditions? I assure you he was very honest,
and of good expectation before he went.
               
               
                  Pro.
                  No, vpon my word. Hee came ouer a great deale
better then he went, and well qualified: and there was no
doubt but he would continue so still, but that couetousnes,
and the diuel's on't.

qualities.

                  No? what if I should first reade a Sermon preached
within these seuen dayes at Amsterdam by a man of most
pure profession and inuention not ordinary, passing all that
liued before or behind him in the nouell straine; himselfe of
the right cut of Carolstadius: in which Sermon hee prooues
most deucutly, that it is Idolatry to fight against the Turke.
Wouldst thou not heare that first?
               
               
                  Simp.
                  No. What tell'st thou me of Sermons? let's haue
these qualities without any more digressions.

                  Well, since you are so desirous, you shall haue them
by whole sale, retaile them at leysure when you come home.
                  Imprimis, when he liueth in a great towne like, London,
he loues to lye in a corner ouer the Kitchen, because the Iack
shall not whirle too often, to waken or distract him in prayer.
His dinners are for the most part ordinary, except foure
dayes in the weeke he visite his house-keeping friends. And
at supper a couple of egges, and a bit of cheese is a choyce
dyet after a liberall dinner: besides it saues fire and washing
of dishes.

                  But your cunning would fayle you, for hee hath a
tricke beyond your reach for preseruing his cheese. But to
the next.
                  Secondly, hee so cauils and wrangles with any man that

he deales withall, that they ne

was in great care for an Associat in the affaire with this day,
and almost euery day I vndertake.
               
               
                  Her.
                  Sir my society will afford you small contentment,

if my daily taskes required not my attendance, where by
perpetual vow I haue engaged all my houres vntil my death.
For I am fit for no other imployment but my beades▪ Neuerthelesse
if it please you briefly to let me know your desire, I
will by my answere you reasonable satisfaction.

you, and your like onely happy, who chuising to leaue the
world, haue procured quietnesse to your life. But Sir Hermito,
I marvaile what hath remoued you from your caue to
the countrie. Are you as weary of private liuing, as I am of
too much company? The newes must needes be great, and
strange which brings you hither.
               
               
                  Her.
                  No such matter, as that my intended course of
dwelling with my selfe sequestred fro
                        •
                      all resort, should
haue an end so long as my abode in this world endureth.
Farre be it from my thought euer to wish the change of my
estate. As now I am I trouble not others, nor any man offendeth
me. And where no mistake is, who can thinke of alteration?
my resolution hath bred my contentment: the
peace which I enjoy, counter-valueth all maner of wants.
And my spiritual excercises take away tediousnes. The cause
of my comming hither (Sir Securus) is a Proclamation lately
set forth by the king, that all his subject being men of
21 yeares, & vpwards, living within 50 miles of the Court,
shall appeare there within 14 days after notice given them.
And about three dayes past, a pilgrim passing by my cell,
told me of this Edict, and that it was vpon alleageance. So
I being his subject (thogh seruing him to no other purpose,
but praying for him) thought it my dutie to make my appearance.
and to depart without delay.

you be travailing to or fro the Court) because this day

is appointed for hearing and determining many controversies,
and censuring sundrie sorts of people: And some of
these differences beyond my learning. You therefore come
very fitly to aide me. And this whole affaire being principally
for peace making, and ending debates without suite
of Law▪ you may not refuse to ioyne with me in a worke of
so great charitie.
               
               
                  Her.
                  In very deed Sir, euery ought to yeeld his best
helpe to such workes. And although I haue alreadie recorded
my appearance at Court, and licenced to returne to my
poore home▪ and would willingly spend some houres with
you to so good a purpose; yet (Alas Sir) I am like to prevaile
very little with any body, wanting both acquiantance
and authoritie among them whosoever they be: therefore I
entreate my fruitlesse presence may bee spared; but I will
not be wanting to you with my prayers for your successe.
               
               
                  Secu.

they shall contemne mee also. Onely I entreate your companie

neede require hereafter.
               
               
                  Her.
                  Sir I expect no intreatie, neither will I wrong you so
much as to make further request to my poore selfe. I stay
willingly and am at you
                        •

                  Enter Rustico, Hortano, Acuto, and Vulcano.
               Neighbour Hortano, I haue considered of the great coile
we had the last Sabouth after evening praier in the verstrie about

putting downe the Holy-dayes. It hinders our businesse
much. And mee thinkes this praying in a Church among
those of high degree is nothing pleasantable, and
blushing takes away my devotion. I can pray a great deale
better, and with a more comelie grace when I whistle at
plow. And me thinkes't were a goodly matter if euery man
in's calling might follow his focation, and there doe such
devotion as his stmacke stands to.
               
                  Hor.
                  Faith, neighbour Rustico, I am euen of your mind.
For Ile bide by it, I ha more weeds growes in one Holyday,
then in three workie dayes.

                  Indeed 'twer a gay thing if wee could put downe
these Holy-dayes, as you say. Me thinks' twer an easie matter
as well as we ha put downe the Fasting-dayes pell mell,
hand ouer head. An wee wood hang together 'twer soone
done, but when some are so arseward 'twill neuer be.
               
               
                  Acu.
                  You talke you know not what. There were no reason
in it: for that were the way to breake all order, and giue
our mindes altogether to toyle, and neuer serue God. For

will leaue nothing standing.

should be you, because you are a Smith▪ but soft, you are so

also. For my part although I doe boldly worke on Holy▪
dayes as other taylers vse Christmasse day and all, yet
would I not misse the Holy-dayes for any good, nor would

I breake the order without necessity. But is it so easie a matter
to put downe the Holy-dayes thinke you? And will
you doe it with the furious fire-forke? And you Master
Gardner that will rake vp Holy-dayes and Fasting-dayes
like weedes, and bury them all in a rrench, you are both
both fowly deceiued. For neither haue you put downe the
Fasting-dayes, because still they are bidden in Churches,
nor is the case alike▪ for Fasting is private, and cannot so
well be punished, but if you come not to Church, vp you go
not to Church, vp you goe for a Recus

holydaies? wood not fewer serue the turne as well? I doe

should be a begger. I it wood.

                  Not so neither. They liued very well: and had not

were as poore as Christs fi

                     shermen. And therefore the daies
of their martyrdome they kept holy, and came to Church to

glorifie and praise that God, for whom those Saints died,
there were people exhorted to doe the like.
               
               
                  Rust.
                  But I mislike the very ground, and cause of those
holydaies which (you say) is suffring death willingly. Doe
not we die fast enough (thinke you) against our wils, but we
must set vp a trade of dying with a good will▪
                  
               
               
                  Acu.
                  Thou speakest against reason. For if thou must
needs dye, first, or last, wert not better to die for a glorious
cause, so to be sure of heauen, & willingly in perfect memory,
then against thy will wrestling with death, & overcome
in the end with great paine, and perhaps past thy sences.
               
               
                  Rust.
                  Reason me no reasons▪ I speake as I thinke, I protest
from my heart I had rather doe any worke in the world
then dye. What? never come home againe to my wife, and
my pretie barnes? Why, I haue a boy, his name is Iacke; hee
has a face as welfavor'd as any great turnippe root, with a
cracke in the mid'st, which is the very proportion of his
mouth. I will not willingly leaue that boy for all the deaths
in the world. No I will not. But if I must needs dye whether
I will or no, I wood haue death take mee asleepe, that I may
not see his face, for if I did I would run away as hard as ever
I could for my life.

                  It is somewhat strange. And the more vnlearned
the men are, the harder to be satisfied. But he hope is, that
as mad men doe best service when some of their like are
most vnruly, so these men being alike vnskilfull will soone
confound each other, and so giue over the businesse.

                  Sir you are much mistaken. The Tailer is an honest

your labour, and a coward too: for I warrant thou hadst rather
be at a good dinner then a battle: were not wee two

there was such argenication among the schollers

now a horse or no▪ I set um all one such a froth with spouting

speake, and yet be no liuing creature? proue this and proue
anything.
               
               
                  Vul.
                  I will proue this▪ and I will proue any thing by Logicke:
what a maime it is for a man to bee ignorant of the
virtue and power of Logicke. I pittie thee, and all such as be

                  Hor.
                  That were strange. How? He that was the last yeare
and yet liues, is not. I cannot devise how this should be: for
if he liue, how can he chuse but haue a being?
               
               
                  Vul.
                  Now it shall appeare how short you are with want
of Logicke. But Ile teach thee a little. Hee that was the last

                  This may be. For I haue heard an old saying (and I
thinke it bee true) that a man may as soone depart with his
honestie, as with any thing he hath.

                  So then. Dost not▪ thou thinke now, that I am as
well able to proue my selfe no liuing creature?

nag liues. For one of them spouted thus. Every horse hath

stones: but this beast hath no stones; Ergo he is no horse. And
I clapt him on the backe and told him that hee spake truth.
For I gelt him the last yeare, and eat his stones to my breakfast.
But I had like to haue mar'd all by saying so. For there
was a nimble-headed Scholler that stood by, (and yet had
nothing to doe with the question) went about to proue me
a horse, and thus he began. Euery liuing beast, or Animal,
that hath in him horse stones, is a horse. But this Animal,
(meaning me) hath horse stones in him, Ergo he is a horse. I
was striken in such a maze (knowing that I did eate the
horse stones) that I was like to sinke where I stood, and euen
presently to congeale into a horse. But there was by chance
an honest Scholler by, who saw my colour quite gone, took
pity on me, and bade me be of good cheere, I shood not be
a horse. And told the tother to his face, that there was a
flacy in his argumen. And then fetcht him about with a R

and prou'd that the horse stones which I had
eaten, were consum'd, and became such stuffe as I cannot tel
you without Sir reuerence of your teeth; and that they did
not grow in me as they doe in horses: Ergo the case was alter'd.
Then vpon this point of growing, and not growing,
there was such a sturre, that all the horse-coursers in the
Faire came about vs. One said they did grow, another denyed
it▪ and such part taking on both sides, that in the end I
was content (being desirous to make them friends) to bee
search't in the open market, and so was cleer'd before them
all to haue no more stones then I shood haue. And glad was
I that I was not a horse. Had not I (thinke you good cause
to remember Logicke? Yes, I shall neuer forget it if I should
liue 100 yeares.

for I am a hot fellow, and I strike thick and short. This Tailer
takes long and wide stitches, and drawes out the time to
make his worke seeme much. Our difference is for the Holy-dayes
as they stand in the Kalender, whether it were fitter
they should be retourn'd into working-daies as they were

ought to stand, we are content, and will worke harder at other

                  Your questiō is not hard to decide, & fit enough for
me to deliuer mine opinion in. It is true, they were all working
daies at the first. For which purpose it is said, such work
as thou doest, worke it in those six daies, and not on the seauenth

to be kept holy▪ And the Christian Church hath appointed

which I will extend to the vttermost, seeing he puts me to

It seemes they neuer entred bond to me. If they had, they
would not presume thus. If nothing els would serue to hold
them, yet this I can alleage, that they are my securitie for his
good behaviour (although I care not sixe pence for any securitie,

you to beat his chamber an houre hence, then his Barber

a Ladie of his secret knowledge and yours, with whom you
both must dine this day. The propertie of this Tobaccho is
to yeeld a porringer full of Rheume everie pipefull: and procure

I haue a couple of followers most vnfit for my humour. Proberio
is so full of scrupulosity, that nothing passes his fingers

                  Pro.
                  Sir, the bargaine with Master Pohssib is the worst
that ever was made: for if he or his wife doe liue 30 yeares,
(as by probabilitie they will) you lose 17000l. by the bargaine
at least. And if they die sooner, you shall saue litle.
Therefore my advice is, that either you buy it absolutely for
readie monie, or yeeld it backe with reasonable consideration
for your monie lent, so shall you be free from exclamations.
               
               
                  Anto.
                  I thought so, I warrant thou art as fearefull of exclamations,
as of thunder-bolts: there is nothing with you
but exclamations, imputations, infamie, reports, discredite,
and the like. A rush, a rush, and they are all one to me.
Well, I thanke you for your paines. Now ply the Knight &
his Father-in-law about the 1000l. accompt.

                     Alas, I could wish the poore man would consider
better of his soules state. Hee seemeth to haue a great wit,
which he bendeth wholly to gather worldly wealth, not regarding
how he gets it. We that haue put riches in the last
place of our care, or rather flye from them as pernicious doe

indeed, condemne for follie all the carking and studie to
encrease our owne hurts as they will proue to be, especially
gotten by indirect meanes.

rich, and full of money to put out for gaine? such men are
now-a-dayes highly esteemed, much sued vnto, and among
their praises that is chiefe, that he excelleth others in mony
at vse. And in the countrie among plaine fellowes it is a
speciall marke or token that he is a good man (as they call
him) if he haue 100

among Christians, and vsed by none but Iewes▪

of the clocke: from that time vntill foure, we must not stirre
from our seate, one discourse after an other holdes vs fast.
Then goe we on visitation from chamber to chamber: and
before wee know perfectly how euery one had their health
since yesternight, and exchanged our complementall
tearmes, the clocke strikes seuen. Then dutie cals vs to
Court our most respected and perfumed Mistris, whereof
we are not discharged till nine. Now supper bids euery one
repair to his messe, which commonly continueth no longer

then tenne. And so after a crash of two houres in play, wee
are driuen euery one to his kennell at midnight, as I said before.

posting correspondence betweene the residence of that liquor
in my stomacke, and the quintisencicall receites in my

exusflations, and insufflations ascend to the braines, and
there worke wonders. By reason whereof it were not hard
for me to furnish Ryder himselfe with 2000 new words not
yet seene in his Dictionarie. I could turne Astronomer▪

giue names to any starres that want. I can passe for a Physician
among many fooles, and kill as many as the best Doctor

whole winters day, and most part of the night by a good
fire, and command (like men of authoritie) the Tapster
to fill vs an Ocean of drinke if we lift, and there among
good fellowes to heare more newes then all the world
knowes to be true, then to toyle and trash in the dirt without
conversation, seldome comming neere one another as
Hunters doe.
               
               
                  Spur.
                  No certainely. I hold it a beastly thing to sit besealing
vpon a bench, and suck in drinke, as pigges do dregges
in a trough: which custome although some base Huntimen,
and Falconers vse, yet if I did thinke that Hunting were as
odious and displeasing to God as drunkennesse is, I would
soone dispatch my dogges.
               
               
                  Insat.
                  And I will free the Court from the fowle & loathsome
custome of drunkennesse. For seldome and with very
few it is vsed there. Officers, and order forbids it as vnseemly
for a Princes palace. I wish we were as cleare from Idlenesse,
pride, disdaine, envy, lecherie, covetousnesse, flattery,

lying, cosenage, oppress
                        •
                     on, and vnthriftines, as we are
from drunkennesse.
               
               
                  Secu.
                  Mary Sir, these are vices enow. And except you
were guilty of all the deadly sinnes, and breach of every
commandement, I know not what you could adde to these.
               
               
                  Her.
                  The delights of hunting and hawking, as also of other
exercises, were (no doubt) ordained by God to comfort
man in his banishment heere, and to giue him a taste of
the vnspeakable pleasures in Heauen, (our owne c
                        •
                     untire)
but the excesse and abuse of any pastime, argues the receiuer
vnreasonable, and turnes the benefite into detriment.
                  Of drunkards I say shortly and sharply; they deprave
Gods blessings, robbe and murder the poore, vndoe the
Common-wealth, bring Gods curse vpon the countrie; depriue
themselues of Heauen, and merite Hell.
                  
                  The Courtier (who ought to bee the square of the countrie
by his civill example) puls vpon himselfe the ruine of
millions, and sinneth much with doing litle.
               
               
                  Gula.
                  I am crushed in the head: no more drinking; farewell
good Ale.
               
               
                  Insa.
                  Giue me thy hand. Wee are all in little better case
for any thing I heare by the iudgment of wise men.

                  Enter Antonio, Proberio, Simplo.
               I haue had such a stirre with this same begger Pohssib, his
wife, and his friends: and so many complaints they haue
made to the King and Councill, and turne themselues into
all shapes and faces to force mee either to goe through with
the bargaine or giue it ouer, that diverse of my friends are
brought to favour his part for starke equities sake. But doe
all what they can I will haue it, and not haue it: I will hold
it, and not hold it. And I will none of the purchase, and yet
not giue it over.
               
                  
                  Pro.
                  I told you Sir, what an intricate businesse it would
proue to be, and full of slander: therefore I wisht you to end
it by yeelding the bargaine backe, for that wilbe the end of
it.
               
               
                  Anto.
                  Thou knowest not what wilbe the end of it, nor
I my selfe; but I can best guesse, because I know his poore estate.
I haue made a priuie search into his debts; and some
creditors I haue pull'd vpon him sooner then they meant.
And in writing I haue every summe he oweth to neighbors,
to workemen, and to his very servants. And this is the
plummet I sound withall. This must bring the fi
                        •
                     h into my
net Proberio. But what haue you done with the Knight and
his Father-in-Law Master Eloc, for the 1000l. accompt?
               
               
                  Pro.
                  Sir, that accompt goes otherwise then you would
haue it; for they proue that there was 1200l. taken vp, and
of that you are to pay 400l.
               
               
                  Anto.
                  Are you sure of that?
               
               
                  Pro.
                  I am so sure, that I am ashamed euer to haue spoken
in a matter so contrarie to good conscience.
               
               
                  Anto.
                  You are so spic'd-conscienc'd, that there is no
dealing with you. Will you demand if they will sweare in
Chancery, that so is the accompt.
               
               
                  Pro.
                  That I will doe, and I am sure they will not refuse
it. (he turnes to the people, and saith) this is but to colour his
dishonest meaning, he knoweth the truth as well and better
then they.
                  
                     Exit Prob.
               
               
                  Anto.
                  These fellowes are so rash, that a litle thing will
satisfie them. I am partly perswaded the accompts be as he
speaketh, but it is good to be sure. Thus thou must do Simplo
in like cases, if thou wilt be a wise, politicke and warie
fellow.
               
               
                  Simp.
                  I heare it well Sir, and haue lock'd it vp safely in
my memento. I giue you many thankes for the 100l. you
gaue me for my land, and for your carefull putting out the
money as your owne. I againe for my part haue sealed the
writings, and am ready to doe any thing els for making it

sure to you. 'Tis a good hearing that Master and man agree
so well as your worship and I doe now. Now they say 'tis a
good title, and they will not make question of it, since you
haue gotten it.
               
               
                  Anto.
                  No, I thinke not: for all their babling they will
not easily beginne sui
                        •
                     e with me to recover it away.
               
               
                  Simp.
                  Feare nothing of that Sir, I can tell you newes.
They say now your title to it is as good as any man hath to
his land. And that you will keepe my 100l. as safe as the
land; and that's good for me.
               
               
                  Anto.
                  That's no newes. You may see now what it is to
be circumspect in my dealing, and to haue a name to hold
fast. Learne this against the time that you haue more land.

                  Intrant Rustico et Hortano.
               Did you euer heare (neighbour Hortano) such a broyle
betweene man and wife as yonder was betweene Porco and
his wife? you and I did very wisely to come away. For sure
they did striue before vs for their credit sake to get the victorie
of each other by scolding; now we are gone perhpas
they will giue over. Mee thought it was very noy some to
heare such vnseemely words passe from maried folke.
               
                  Hor.
                  Sure their bitternesse pass'd the bou
                        •
                     ds of humanitie.
They make me afraid of marying, if such jarres fall out
betweene those that be one flesh.
               
               
                  Rust.
                  Let it not discourage you more then it repents
me that I am maried: for it lyes in your power to haue all
well and quiet if you chance to mary euen one of the short
rib
                        •
                      of the great Divell.
               
               
                  Hor.
                  How can that be neighbour Rustico? if you can
teach me that, you doe much. For I haue heard many say,
that it is impossible to tame a shrew by any meanes, except
by hauing no woman at all.
               
               
                  
                  Rust.
                  If you talke of taming by violence, you say well,
it cannot be, for the more you striue to break their stomack▪
the more it growes; like camamile, the more you tread it, the
more it spreades; and like a tree felled, where will grow 40
springs. But take a twig by the top▪ and gently bend it by
litle and litle, it will grow in what fashion you will. A wasp
is a shrewd stinging beast by nature, but if shee light vpon
your face and hands, and creepe vp and downe, let her alone,
and take her pleasure, she will doe you no harme, and
quietly passe away. So if your wife will meddle with all
things, giue her libertie to doe what she will, you shall haue
her merry els she were worse then the Divell.
               
               
                  Hor.
                  I thinke this is very likely: but who can endure his
wife to doe what she listeth at all times?
               
               
                  Rust.
                  That can I, and that must you, or els you ar
                        •
                      not
wise; for if you may haue peace vpon any conditions, is it
not your fault if you 
                        •
                     buse to be jarring?
               
               
                  Hor.
                  But I haue heard say▪ it is better to haue honorable
warres, then inconvenient peace.
               
               
                  Rust.
                  That is among strangers and enemies; but among
friends, and with your selfe, what peace can bee dishonourable?
               
               
                  Hor.
                  How commest thou to be so cunning in this kinde
of argument?
               
               
                  Rust.
                  Euen as you may if you will take the course that I
doe. I haue a wife, the best creature that euer you saw in the
order that she takes with me. But if I should be churlish, as
perhaps you would be, and crosse her never so little, shee
would rage like a fury of Hell. She speakes, and I giue eare;
she giues counsell, and I practise; she commands, & I obey;
she chides, and I hold my peace; she preaches, and I beleue;
thus we liue as lo
                        •
                     mgly as Master and Scholler.
               
               
                  Hor.
                  But who could abide his wife to teach and controlle
him?
               
               
                  Rust.
                  Euery man that loues his ease. And if all wiues be

                        〈◊〉
                      mine is, she shalbe thrice happy to obey her. For she is the

best woman to bring vp husbands that euer was borne. She
will so instruct them in the wonderfull vertue of patience,
that if they wilbe ruled by her monitions, they shalbe as
good as martyrs, a great deale better then living Saints. I
thanke her heartily, she is my Pilcatory in this world, I shal
goe straight to Heaven whensoever I dye. Therefore left I
should lose the benefite of the blessed state I stand in by any
misdemeanour of mine. I dare not offend her in the least
matter. O 'tis a great blessing to haue such a wife.
               
               
                  Hor.
                  But for all this it should bee long before I would
chuse such a wife, which did desire to cary such a hand over
me as she doth over thee.
               
               
                  Rust.
                  O neighbour Hortan
                           •
                        , that thou didst but taste of
the fruites of patience! Intrat Lamia his wife with a cudgill
of an ell long, and counterfeiting to be a Puritan, lifting her
eyes vpward.) Looke where my wife is; I know her by the
signe of the Bible. See how devout she is. She never lookes
lightly lower then the Element. You may say what you will
now, she cannot heare a word, her meditations be so fervent.
               
               
                  Hor.
                  Why doth she cary that cudgill while she is praying?
               
               
                  Rust.
                  
                     (She openeth her Bible, and makes shew to reade, and
many times turnes her eyes with the white vpward.) That is
her rod of discipline, and a strange thing it is which now I
tell you. She is never so rapt vp in her devotions, but if I cō
                     mit
the least fault (as wretched man that I am many times I
doe, and my best actions are abhominable) she perceiues it
presently (and yet is deafe to all other noise) and she come

to me fiercely in the heate of her charitie, and corrects mee
verie handsomely with that wand.
               
               
                  Hor.
                  But will she correct her seruants with this cudgill?
               
               
                  Rust.
                  O no, verie seldome, shee does not loue them so
well) except it be a verie great fault. But in me (for the entire
loue she beares me) she will not suffer the least sinne vnpunished,
lest (as she saith) any might remaine to bee rebuked

by hell fire.
               
               
                  Hor.
                  But I had rather be her seruant, then her husband,
if she strike with such twigges.
               
               
                  Rust.
                  Had you so? but so had not I. For by this I am
made sure of my election, when I doe patiently endure so
great correction.
               
               
                  Hor.
                  How doth shee bring vp thy sonne Iacke?
                  
               
               
                  Rust.
                  Admirably well: for lest he should proue an Idolatour
shee will not let him aske blessing vpon his knees. And
lest he should abate of his mettle and stomacke, he must never
put off his hat to vs, nor be denied any thing he cals for:
so that being now but sixe yeares old he will fight, scratch,
and tumble himselfe vpon the ground, crying vntill his hart
breake if he may not haue his will in every thing. Then is
there no way but giue it him, or els he will die with skreming.
O, he will proue a man of outragious spirit. It makes
me sometimes doubt he should not be my child, he hath so
noble a stomacke, farre beyond mine. And, but that I know
his mother to be a verie religious professour, I assure you it
would trouble me much, he discovereth s
                        •
                      much furie in his
fashions, and such might by his madnesse, that I thinke many
times some gyant got him when my wife was asleepe, for
I am sure she would never suffer it waking.
               
               
                  Hor.
                  Nay, nay, if your wife bee a woman of that command
as you describe he

                      to be, and as she makes shew of no
lesse by her part, it may well be, the Boy takes his courage
from her, and his outward personage from you.
               
               
                  Rust.
                  You say well neighbour Hortano, that may be;
but I doe halfe mistrust my owne worth in getting such a
child: but yet I loue him as well as if he were my owne.
               
               
                  La.
                  I came hither to seeke a kinde of husband that I
haue. He wants gouerment and discipline (I am sure) ere
this time: for I haue not seene him these three dayes past: the
poore man wilbe vndone, if I light not on him shortly.

I must needes goe to her. Stand by neighbour▪ and note

how zealously she will edifie me. How doe you good wife?
I knew it was you so soone as I saw you any thing neere me.
May I be so bold as to aske where you haue been these two
or three daies? My boy Iacke and I thinke long vntill you
come home.
               
               
                  La.
                  Why should you aske so foolish a question? you
knowe that I must frequent my contemplation: in which I
cannot be lesse then two or three daies: the fervour of spirit
is such among the elect that they may not depart in short
time from their meditations, especially having such learned
Teachers among vs, that are never wearied, and willing to
accompanie and conduct vs in the darkest dangers. O the
delights, pleasures, and sweet delectations that we feele during
the time of these contemplations, that wee thinke no
time contentedly spent but when we are imployed in these
exercises. I thinke verily my goodly boy Iacke was begotten

that you would vse your frends to get a grant vnder the
broad seale (whatsoeuer it cost) that we may erect an office
with a master and clarks belonging to it, to the ende that everie
one which wants monie may repaire thither, and vpon
request to the vnder clarks speake with the master of the office,
and 
                        •
                     hence take directions how to proceed, and so obtaine
monie. This will make them knowe themselues, and
yeeld dutie to them that it appertaines: when they shall
come by degrees to the worth of monie.
               
               
                  Anto.
                  This I like well; but it will be a great charge to
maintaine master and clarkes in an office, so shall wee loose
much out of our gaine.
               
               
                  Nov.
                  Sir you mistake it quite. The companie hath argued
that case to and fro. The master and clarkes will pick out
a liuing well enough I warrant you out of them that take vp
m
                        •
                     hie, and this will free them from other brocage. As you
knowe all offices are maintain'd by the suiters, not by the
granters of the place.

                  Nov.
                  That must be done by the companie. But weele
lose nothing by it. For wee are determined to let no monie
goe but one waie or other we will get 30 in the 100. And if
we giue commodities we will haue more: & tis reason too.
The worse the bargaine is, the more they must lose that take
it. And there is another thing that we will be at the charge
of Sir. Wherein we must craue your helpe also. And that is:
some armes from the king of Heraulds appropriated to our
companie alone, and hanged vp behind the master of the
office: this will giue honour to the place, and cause suiters

and Granato the Fariner.
               
               It is even high time the world were at an end, for I think
all trades are decaying: when my father put me to the Innes
of Court he advised me in anie case to studie, so that I might
be called to the barre, and then (saith he) feare not to liue in
all plentie and credit. But I find it otherwise, for now that I
am exalted thither, my law serues mee not to get my commons.
I wish I had beene bred a Tapster: that trade is now
more gainefull with froth then ours with all our words. And
for anie thing I see tis like to last to the worlds end, whereas
ours can be good no longer then people bee contentious.
And that is a speciall argument the ale. sellers vse against vs,
saying that we gaine by falling out of neighbours, & frends
but they grow rich by meeting of good fellowes, and sitting
together lovinglie. There are so manie hinderances
grownevp of late that it is impossible our raigne should
long continue although it be true (and wee complaine not)
that malice is as great among men as ever it was, and can be
wished: but the mischiefe is, their monie failes, & they grow
wiser.
               
                  Mure.
                  I marvaile what will satisfie your greedie desires.
haue you not the whole kingdome at your service & becke?

what Lord, Knight, Gentleman, Merchant, Husbandman,
or other sort of people is not attendant at your studie dores,
with paying and praying? and glad that the fee which hee
giues is of that glorious operation, that it breeds no wrincles
in your forehead, but is cheerefullie receaued? What

                        gees, and submissiue requests to peruse their case with a
little care? What troupes conduct you to the barre? What
venison sent to your feafts? What respect and entertainement
if you vouchsase to visite their countrie houses? And
finally, what honour and homage can bee done to subiects,
but you haue it in all fulnes, and yet you whine as not contented.
I perceiue you would murmure if you were so handled
as poore merchants are, that vnlesse we turne Vsurers,
we cannot liue.
               
               
                  Mali.
                  You complaine without cause Mureto. Your
case is farre better then ours: for if one countrie or commoditie
afford not gaine, you can go into another, and choppe
and change as often as you list. We are tied to one countrie
and place. You may offer your wares▪ and are sure to haue
trafficke as the times and prices be. We may not tender our
service to anie, but sit gaping in our chambers, as melancholicke
as mice, vntill some bodie chance to knocke at the
doore.

Surelie the world might well spare of both sorts of
you a great number. Concerning you Master Mureto, it is
cleare that you play the merchant with vs, who bite and
whine at your impositions. although you lose nothing; but
the whole burden thereof falles vpon them who spend the
commodities, and must ere they buy, pay the shot of your
impositions whatsoever it be.
                  And for you Master Lawyer, that grow fat with the

alwayes my owne sheetes, except sometimes when mine
were finer, you would change with me for worse. And the
great dyet I had was sometimes a piece of cheefe, and one
egge; for which benefites, I haue travailed like a Porter, &
written like a Clarke. Is this your gratitude for good turnes
past? and are all your promises thus performed?

for him, but doth he expect farther? why, the fellow knowes
not the world. Simplo, tell him that if my word may doe
him any good, he shall haue it: but if he loue his libertie, let
him challenge no deeds at my hands. He never had more of
me then my word for that he now claimeth. And doth hee
thinke to build castles vpon my word? if he doe, they shall
come downe apace. Now he is gone to remoue his stuffe,

yeares past, when I was in prosperitie, and he at point of
death, by rigour of Law, I tooke many costly iourney to
Court, labouring for his pardon. I did him all the good
offices that a true friend could doe for another. And I left
nothing vndone that might doe him good. Besides, I lent
him 50

made me, I let passe, as ingratefull to my heart in repeating,
and serue to no other purpose but for a warning, and a wō

Master Malingua this Lawyer, and confesse to haue
wronged vs merchants with the petulancie of your prating;
you may perhaps haue your punishment extenuated if wee
be your Iudges, and so quietly shut vp all among our selues.
               
                  Gra.
                  I am so farre from any such confession and submission,
that I offer to maintaine euery word spoken in our last
contention. And for iudgement I appeale from you both;
and know that I am your ancient from the time that Adam
digged the earth for his liuing.
               
               
                  Mali.
                  Then purge your selfe Granato from the crimes
we charg'd you withall: and the end will trye if you had
not done better to take penan

                  For the high prices of corne (which falsely and
absurdly you impute vnto husbandmen) if you had either
wit or honestie you would soone graunt that there are two
maine reasons for it which lye not in our power to redresse,
but in the States wisdome to helpe. One is, the vncontrolled

and improvident libertie for all sorts & degrees to marrie,
so that many are grand-mothers at 30 yeares old. The
other is the multitude of Inclosures and decay of tillage.
And if we corne-men did not till all the ground we can get;
how deare (thinke you) would corne bee shortly? Many
other Reasons for brevity sake I omit, but these will hold
argument against you for tearme of both your liues, and
after your decease to your heires males lawfully begotten.

                  Beleeue me Master Mureto, this Farmer hath
made for himselfe a reasonable good Apologie, and put vs a
hard case. It seemes he hath studied well since our last parle.
But what say you Granato to your euill words lauish'd out
against Lawyers? therefore you must yet craue pardon.
               
               
                  Gra.
                  Not I truly. For I gaue you no worse speeches then
you giue one another at the barre, nor so euill. For there
you fall out like any skoulds: but the worst is, you wilbe
friends at dinner, yet neuer in charity I thinke. And I see
no reason I should stoope to either of you, considering the
goodnes of my cause. For I wilbe iudg'd by any indifferent
man, if I, and such as I am, be not honester and better
then both your factions.

                  Since thou hast offred it, thou shalt not escape
vntill that be tryed, Heere sit a couple that seeme very wise
by their silence, weele bee iudg'd by them. What say you
Mureto?
                  
               
               
                  Mure.
                  With all my heart. For wee can not bee worse
then we are howsoeuer we speede.
               
               
                  Gra.
                  A match. Ile refuse no mans opinion that is not of
your rankes.
               
               
                  Mali.
                  Gentlemen. We need not report the causes of our
reference vnto you. All our jarres, and wrangles you haue
heard. We intreate you to finish them with your doome.
               
               
                  Secu.
                  To deale plainely with you all, mine opinion is,
that the world is generally more wronged and abused by
the Lawyer and merchant, then by the Farmer, who though

he haue faults, yet gets he his liuing more honestly, and is of
necessitie to be harboured. But Sir Hermito I must referre
the full decision of their cause to your censure.
               
               
                  Her.
                  That one of them is better then the other, I doe
not see; therefore me thinkes the question should rather be
which is the worst. The Farmer that deceiues so farre as
his capacity will carry him, is condemned by his intention
to doe worse if his skill did enable him.
                  The Lawyer is a necessary member of the commonwelth
to finde and determine everie mans right. But if willingly
he oppugne right, and be enemie to peace, he is the Diuels
agent, and Christs enemie.
                  Likewise a merchant which causeth commerce and amitie
betweene severed nations is a man commendable. But
if he vse fraud, then is he pestiferous, and deserueth banishment
where no societie is.
               
               Malingua, Mureto, and Granato, make obeysance vnto
Securus and Hermito, and turning together, say.
               
                  Mure.
                  I told you Master Malingua, we could not lose
by the bargaine. Now the Farmer is as bad as we. What
say you Granato to this geare?
               
               
                  Gra.
                  I say litle. Why? I can be content to bee as dishonest
as you. I am not proud of my honestie, nor doe I loue
to be singular.
               
               
                  Mali.
                  But now thou seest we may be as honest as you, if
we will our selues.

                  Who denies that? I stand not much vpon that
neither.

                  But hath this Hermites preaching done thee no
good? canst thou be content to mend if we doe so too?
               
               
                  Gra.
                  Yes, with all my heart. And Ile bee good before
both you if you mend not the faster.
               
               
                  Mure.
                  Content. Let vs all amend: for I thinke in my
conscience it is euen high time.

               How long I thinke vntill I meete Noverindo. All is readie

I haue my money. For what can I tell? you may be so
ouer-ioyed with the sight, that you may runne madde vpon
it. And then what guardian of yours while you liue, or administrator
when you die will pay me 44. shillings, especially
being due for a thing that put you out of your wittes?
Therefore satisfie your selfe, you shal not see it vntill I haue
euerie pennie of my money.

                     Noverindo lookes earnestly vpon it a long time, and
then fetching a great sigh, saith. What Tiburnist is this? And
what's the mysterie of all this picture?
               
               
                  Pro.
                  Sir. this Tiburnist, or hangman is the Divell. And
this fellow that hath the purse is Iudas. the figure of 30 with
p-ioin'd to it signifies 30 pence, for which he sold his master.
That which followeth is meant of Christ, worth a hundred
worlds: for which fact the Divell put a halter about his neck
and hang'd him. So shortly this is the summe of all.
                  
                     Iudas who for 30d
                         sould Christ infinitely greatest
                     Was hangd by the Divells helpe, and reputed with the basest.
                     Before you saw the history,
                     Now you heare the mystery.
                  
               
               
                  Nov.
                  Tis a good exposition. But I wood I had my two
peeces againe. I doe not like it very well, for manie ignorant
people will take it farre otherwise: as thus, 30. p. 30•. for a
hundreth. And he that taketh 30• in the 100. is to be hangd
by the Divell.
               
               
                  Pro.
                  Tis true. manie may thinke so: but your Clarks must
informe them in the sense. No man can put a secret in figures
but it may be diversly interpreted. And so be all oracles
taken in sundry sences.
               
               
                  Nov.
                  But I wish it were made plainer to the vnderstanding:
for the more part will take it as I did at first sight.

                  Why should you thinke so?
               
               
                  Nov.
                  Because I cannot imagine any other meaning so
proper to those figures as that I conceaued.
               
               
                  Pro.
                  That's because you are parcell 
                        •
                      guiltie. But I will
gather two other conceits as proper as that of yours.

his Landlord 100. caudles without monie, he is no Tenant
for me. What; no lesse then 30 shillings in caudles taken
out of my rent at a clap, who did euer heare of the like? And
the price too is monstrous: groates apeece? why, it were
enough for a supper at my chamber. Indeed they were very
sweet and good, but what of that? a man may buy gould
too deare. Tell him from me, I will not allow him a penie
for caudles, and yet I will haue my rent.

of mine tother day to him that gaue him a fee. Indeed I
told him that he should goe to my lawyer and giue him no
fee. But when I had him there, and he put his case, I whisper'd
my cosen in the eare to offer him a fee: But I did not
whisper my lawyer to refuse it. and so verie honestlie hee
tooke it: and I knowe therefore hee will expect no fee for
my owne businesse.

                  Then belike I mistooke it. perchance hee thank'd
you for bringing your cosen to giue him a fee without
cause, being well resolved before by other Councell. Well
now Sir I hope you will bestow my freedome vpon me. I
desire no more cunning then now I haue, and Ile serue you
still, and set vp for my selfe: for I had rather bee a double

                  Of diverse sorts: I knowe not my selfe: but they
are finelie pack't vp. I saw a car vnloading with such ware even
now as I came, it is a commoditie more sought for by
daie and night then anie I knowe. I tell you it troubles the
Lord Maior, and all the Iustices to keepe the people in order
that gather these wares, they are so eager in catching at
them.

vpon you,

                  Now let me cast vp my accompt. 40l lost out of the
principall at the first 10l the interest. 40 shillings the broker.
All this is but 52l in the 100, tis reasonable as the world

goes now: here is my hand. As I am a gentleman Ile haue it
vpon these tearmes, so that the bargaine be no worse then
you speake of, put the bands to making. Now tell me what
call you the commoditie?

thou presume to offer me old ragges?

                  Why Sir, I tell you they are readie monie at the paper
mills.

them.

                  You shall not need Sir, I wil take order for selling
them▪ and I hope you can abide to tell the monie when I
bring it. I wood your worship had 1000l worth of them, as
filthie things as they be.

                  So would I: but it shall never be said for my credit
sake that I tooke vp a commoditie of old ragges or doublets.
I haue heard of manie scurvie bargaines, but never the
like to this.

goe backe: here is witnesse enough you engaged your honour
to haue it. take the lesse and saue your reputation.

                  I did so indeed, the more foole I to passe my word
before I felt their stinke. I cannot abide to thinke on them.
But to saue my credit goe to, dispatch. Ile haue the whole
100l since I must haue some. Ile never giue my bond for

                  I thinke the aire is infected, that such contagious
caterpillers swarme abroad in this age to destroy vouth, that
scarse one fruite among 100 comes to bee ripe but is first
rotten. Such as this broker is are nourished by the Divel for
no cause but to waste yong men in old prisons. And these
cormorants which set them a-worke to entise youth to these
pestilent adventures me thinkes they can haue no hope that
he which receives so litle monie vpon great bonds, doth euer
meane to pay them. For he deales not with one of these
gripers, but with as many as he can find wilbe content with
his owne securitie. Therefore when he comes to bee arrested
he is buried aliue for all, and payeth none.

                  I wish they were all so serued. then the losse of the
monie on the one side, and the sharpe rod of imprisonment
on the other side, would bring both sorts to repentance,

                  It is not wisedome to eate a meale when you are
hungrie, for then you eate too much and surfeite. Euen as it
is not good to fight or correct schollers when you are in

hungrie as you, yet I will eate but a manchet, and drinke
twice of one pot.

enough. And I am glad you tell me of it; for I was in
earnest to haue lou'd her beyond measure, & so might haue
fallen mad, and marr'd all: but now Ile doe euen as wee doe
at Court, make many shewes of loue and service, and
intend nothing lesse. But yet thus honestlie Ile deale with

like her, Ile loue her vntill I leaue her. Well, tis time to bee

                  Yes, contrarie enough, as white is to blacke. And
to hold you no longer in suspence, my vow and purpose is
to be a Nun.

that I cannot so part with you. And yet to this crosse I know
not what to say: for it takes from me all libertie to mooue

                  Alas Insatiato, I perceiue thou art simple in this busines,
or els not yet come to thy selfe again. Levitia speakes
well, but thy capacitie is verie muddie. Wouldst thou not
haue thy wife vow chastitie, but be an harlot? there is chastity
and continencie among married folke, so long as they
be faithfull each to other. But virginitie goes further: and
that is sequestred continencie during life, not admitting
companie for procreation.
               
               
                  Insa.

but this creature would haue delayd me longer, and dull'd
my wits without mercie.
               
               Enter Pestifero, and whispers Insatiato, to whom in anger
he answereth, either let them stay, or teare the
writings, I cannot yet come.
               Exit Pestif.
               But I thanke her yet for the kinde order shee hath made
to be of her mothers order. I hope (sweet Mistris Levitia)
you will heare no motion to ouerthrow this order againe.
And now tell me, what say you to my vow, which in all equ

must be performed. You see I was content (though
much against my minde) that you should haue kept your
vow of virginitie, (if so had stood your resolution) now I
appeale to your owne court for Iustice, and hope you will
giue as good way to the fulfilling of my vow, which is never
to leaue your service and companie.

blowne out of their mouthes, then the rest of their speech,

more powder in the gun to make it carrie the shot further,
