of the aire, and of the plague.
            
               OF all the diſeaſes whereunto the body of man is
ſubiect, the Plague or Peſtilence is the moſt terrible
and fearefull, and moſt contagious, therefore
we muſt ſéeke all meanes, both naturall and
artificiall, to preſerue our ſelues and families
from it: therefore firſt we wil ſpeake of the naturall
cauſes of this infection.
            There be two eſpeciall cauſes of the Peſtilence.
            The firſt is, an infected, corrupted and putrified Ayre.

labour to driue the poyſon out of the body, but if botches do not
appeare, it is more perillous and daungerous: for it betokeneth

               For a man hauing taken ſame venome, it is mingled with

bleed in the firſt houre, or within ſixe houres after drinck not,

                   tarry not aboue twelue houres from bleeding, for when thy
bloud is ſo flickering, the venome is then mouing and not yet

aflicted wil declare.
               For if the members aboue the breaſt be moſt grieued and

               And if you perceiue the peſtilence to infect or inuade you at
meate, or vpon a full ſtomacke, then vomitt ſtraiteway, and
when the body and ſtomack is empty, then take ſome medicine
that can reſiſt poyſon as methrydate or Triacle.
               
               When the patient hath taken ſom medcines that wil expel the
venome, lay him in a warmed bed, being made with ſoft ſhe
