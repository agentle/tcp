                  Ven. ex abrupto.
                  But pray you tell me, Iuno, was it so,
                  As Pallas tolde me here the tale of Ecch

                  And as shee tolde what subtill iugling prankes

                  No matter, Venus, how so ere you skorne,

                  Had euerie wanton god aboue, Venus, not better lucke,
                  Then heauen would be a pleasaunt parcke, & Mars a lustie bucke.
               
               
                  Ven.
                  Tut Mars hath hornes to butte withall although no bull a showes.
                  A neuer needes to maske in nets, a feares no iellous froes.

                  Forsooth the better is his turne, for if a speake to loude,
                  Must finde some shifte to shadowe him, a net, or else a cloude.

                  And all the Gods in heauen haue seene her naked, long agoe.

                  The songe.
                  O gentle loue, vngentle for thy deede,
                  Thou makest my harte
                  A bloodie marke
                  VVith pearcyng shot to bleede.
                  Shoote softe sweete loue, for feare thou shoote amysse,
                  For feare too keene.
                  Thy arrowes beene,
                  And hit the harte, where my beloued is.
                  To faire that fortune were, nor neuer I
                  Shalbe so blest
                  Among the rest
                  That loue shall ceaze on her by simpathye.
                  Then since with loue my prayers beare no boot,
                  This doth remayne
                  To cease my payne,
                  I take the wounde, and dye at Venus foote.
