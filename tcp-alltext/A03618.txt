            Iohan Hoper wyſhythe grace and the yefftes of the holy Gooſte unto my lord of wyncheſter.
            YOure booke my lorde intytlid à detection of the deuilles Sophiſtrie &c. Was delyueryd unto me in Zurych the xxx. of Aprell, laſt paſt: the whyche I haue withe leaſure and diligence peruſid, Markyd youre intencion, and how ye ſenſe à wrong opinion withe many ffere wordes and diuerſe reaſones, ſufficient to confirme the ignoraunt in his ignorancie, to ſtablyſhe his errour, and likewyce it may put in dāger the good and ſim ple conſcience unlernid that is perſwadid and ſeythe the truithe, yet for lacke of knolege cannot, nor is not able to defend the ſame, when argumentes ſubtille and crauffti ſhal aſſaulte his ſimple and playne ffaythe aboue the reche and capacite of his intendemente Therfore Becauſe Ideſire ſouche as know the trewthe to perſeuer in the ſame, and ſouche as yet be ignoraunt therof to comme unto the trewithe that in Chriſt they might withe the churche of truithe ffind eternall ſaluaciō. I haue made this anſwer unto your booke to ſuccur and warrant the conſcience of the reader, ffrom the ſnares and ſophiſticacions wherwithe all youe or ony other ſhuld troble and unquiete the peace and tranquillite of him that reſtyth only under the ſhadow and protection of godes holye word, being deliuerid ffrom the darkenys of Egypt, the deteſtable doctrine of man. I haue likewyce dedicatyd the ſame unto youre lordſhyppe to declare that it is agaynſt youre cauſe and opinion that I writ and not

agaynſt youe, to whom I wyſhe the ſame grace and ffauour of god, that I would unto my ſelfe, and the loue that Paule wyſhid unto his contre men the Iewes of whoe sſaluacion he was mooſt deſyrows, thowghe there obſtinacy and blindenis ſo meritid the puniſhement and ſeuerite of godes Ire, that he was compellyd to wryt the inditement and condemnacion of there infidelite as it aperithe by his mooſt louing and affectionat hart Ro. 9. before his entre into that lamentable and ſeuere diſputacion of there departure and reiection ffrom the promeſſe of god. Taking god and his conſcience to record that he wrot of no Malyce, nor pretenſid yle wille, but conſtraynid there unto to ſerue the glorie of god and the truithe of his word: Whyche muſt be preferrid before all other loues of the worold. Therefore wrote he as I do in the defenſe of the uerite to gayneſouche as he wrote unto untogod, and to defend them that knew the truithe ffrom the ſubtiltie and crauffte of ſouche as pretendyd, the ſubuerſion of the truithe by crafftye and ſubtill argumētacion. It is not ignorant unto youe what may be donne by the uerteue of a fere and well orderyd oracion. How mouche it auaylythe whether it perſuade à trewthe or à falſite. No nede to ſyke examples therof in Demoſthenes Cicero or ony other prophane wryter the ſcripture is playne that it hathe ſouche uehemency and effect in it ſelfe with the helpe of the deuyll, that it perſuadithe the falſyſt lye of the worold to be trewe, make the man to belyue not only that godd is yle, the treuthe falſhod, but that god, his word, and all that ſpeaky the his word befalſe, as we may ſe, Nu. 13. by the oracyon

of thoſe 10. that were ſent by the churche of the Iſraelites with Iehoſua and Caleb to inquire and ſarche the condicione and nature of the land of coenaan: at there Returne as treatoures of the commune wealthe, and not as faythe full inquiſitoures as it was commaundid them in there embaſſayge and cōmiſſion made this oracion and aduertiſmēt of there expedicion: Venimus ad terram ad quam nos miſiſti, & uti
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                fluit lacte & melle, & hiceſt fructus eius. Niſi quod populus eſt fortis qui habitat in terra, & ciuitates munite & grandes ualde: quin & filios Anac uidimus ibi. Amalec autem habitatin terra meridionali &c. This bryue oracion ſo preualyd among the Iſraelitis, that it browght the hole multitude and congregacion of the churche into deſperacion into à contempt of god and there lawfull apoyntid Emperoure Moſes, And highe priſt Aron. Confer theffect of this oracion whyche ye may ſee in the begynning of the xiiij. chapiter of Num. with god and all the miracles that euer he wrowght for them, and yet more aualyd this falſe oration to perſuade à falſe effect, then god, his word, Moſes, or Aron. God Among all the people of the worold, Choſe this people to be peculier unto hym ſelfe and byd Moſes ſay unto Pharo that he ſhuld dimiſſe his people to do ſacrifice unto hym Exod. 
                  •
               . This ſinguler fauor and priuilayge aualyd nothing, they would returne into Egypt Num. 14. agayne and ſerue Pha rao there mortall Ennymie and leaue the lyuing god. He that deuidid the red ſee, kyllid all the ffyrſt begoten of Egypt Exod. 12. fed them with mete from heauen: Wonderfully preſeruid boothe there ffathers and them

of his mercyfull fauour promiſid them not 
                  〈◊〉
                lyffe eternall, but alſo à pleaſaunt, ryche and mooſt commodious realme, and kyngdon, in this worold. Now hathe this ffalſe oracion of the 10. treatures wrowght ſouche an opinion in there heddes that they denye god, and hathe no more truſt nor confidence in hym, nor will not hyre him ſpoken of: in ſo mouche that all the hole congregacion agreyd to ſtone Iehoſua and Caleb to deathe becauſe they contraryd there wyckyd pretence: yet was it not the ffere of ſtones, ffyre, nother ſwerd that could fere theſe too godly men ffrom preaching the truthe of god: they had wordes agaynſte wordes, and an oracion agaynſt an oracion and ſayd if it pleace the lord he can bring us into this land, and trewly becauſe he hathe promyſid it, unto us, he will yeue it, be not ye Rebellious agaynſt hym. Nether fere ye not the people of the land, they ſhall be our breade we ſhall deuore thē for zilam there protection is departid from them. And the lord is withe us. Litle à uaylyd this godly oration it perſuadyd nothyng at all, yet dyd theſe too there dewtys to ſhewe the truythe: whiche is an Example that we ſhuld do the ſame, all wayes confeſſe the the truythe, and defend the word of god, thowghe there belitle hope, or none that it ſhall take effectt, yet it is oure dewtys whether we be lernyd or unlernyd euery man to confeſſe his faythe, for he that ſaythe in thy hart thow ſhalt haue nomore Godes but one, the ſame god ſaythe thow ſhalt not take my name in uayne, Exo. 20. and in forbyddyng the negatyue, he commaundythe the affyrmatiue it is not ſufficient to refrayne the tong ffrom ſwering

and ſpeking of yle, but that it muſt confeſſe the treuth of god and ſpeake well, as Dauid ſaythe declina à malo & fac bonum. It is not ſufficient to leaue yle undon, but that we muſt do the godd commaundid by god and his lawe. As Dauid ſaythe Pſal. 1. bleſſid is he that walkythe not in the concell of the yle &c. but hathe his meditacions in the law of god day and nyght. Wyſte I that my laboure ſhuld neuer do good, ner healpe the cōſcience of one manne: yet for the cōmaundementes ſake would I haue wroten, to ſet one oracion agaynſt the other, becauſe I ſe the Name of god blaſphemid by the opinion that ye defend. But I haue hope that it ſhall ſomwhat auayle to confound the falſhode, and bring the truithe the ſoner to light. I know it is the condicion of god to permit unto euery oracion his nature and condicion, as we ſe ſom tymes by preaching of the trew word of god people ar conuertyd unto faythe, ſome tyme, by preaching the doctrine of men people ar ſeducid and caryd ffrom the faythe. It is not the nature of god to make the falſe oratour domme when he would perſwade à falſe opinion, Nether to make his auditours deffe, but as Iſay he ſuffrethe the oracion to work his uertewe, and leauithe ffre election unto the audience to imbrace whiche part they lyſt, by grace, and à conſenting will, the good, by the deuill and there awne malyce the yle. Now the oratour of god muſt perſuade withe none othere argumentes or wordes then the maſter of the ſcole Chriſt hathe tawght. The Prophetes and apoſteles wrotē: It is no orator of Chriſtes, that contrarie unto his Canones, Rules and preceptes, would perſwade in the churche ony

thing more thē is preſcribid in the ſccipture the whiche is mooſt perfete and ſufficiēt to perſuade in cauſes of Religiō all thinges. That law muſt nedes be mooſt perfete, that can haue nothing addid unto it, nor nothing taken from it, of this cōdition is the ſcripture as ye know by the wordes of Moſes and the reuelacion of Iohan. Luc. in his later booke ſaythe: Superiore uolumine diximus Theophile, de omnibus quae cepit Ieſus facere & docere. The whych wordes Ioan. Chryſoſt. thus interpretith, de omnibus, & non omnia: de omnibus ad ſalutem neceſſarijs. Conſernyng doctrine and how to lede oure liffe it is ſufficiently tawght in the ſcripture. Thoſe that will ſtabliſhe the Maſſe as ye do my lord and defend Idolatrye: Muſt proue the thyng ye ſpeke by the ſcripture, and playnly ſatisfie the places of the ſcripture browgte agaynſt youe. ye muſt not darken the places with gloſes of your ymagyon. But diſſolue the places and content boothe the ſcripture whyche ys youre mortall Ennymie in this mater, and likewyce ſatisfye the reaſon of man whyche ye neglect in this cauſe of the ſacrament other wyſhe then ye ſhuld do, and for à good reaſon ye bryng an inuiſible miracle. God that can reſuſcitat the Chyldren of Abraham out of the hard ſtones, ſend youe of his mercyfull grace, to take away the uele of blyndenys and yeue youe his light, Amen.

            IT IS DAYLY PRAYDE IN THE CHVRche of god, good Chriſtiane reader of as many as knowith and felith in them ſelfes there weakenys, how ſoone man is Caryd away, ether with affections, ether by forſe of temptacion (whych, the nature of man corruptyd in no wyſe (can reſiſt) unto all Kynd of abhominacion. that god of his mercye woulde defende, thoſe dangerouſe aſſaults of the deuyl, the worold, the fleſhe and ſynne and ſaith Ne inducas nos in tentationem: ſuffre not us to be ouer come with temptacion, nor caryd away by the forſe of the dewyl, into the danger of ſynne and iniquite. but delyuer us from yle. gouerne us with the ligth of thyne eternal truythe. that nether by ignoraynce of knolege of thy mooſt holy worde. nether by thymbecillite ant weakenys of oure infirmę nature, we fall not awaye from the. Great and wonuderfull was the prudens of Dauid. yet was he diuerſe tymes Caryd awaye, into manny great ſynnes, and ſo for the tyme made ſeruant unto the deuyl and his awne luſtes, that withe great difficultye, and inſpekable penitence ſkarſe coulde he in long tyme affter, moderat thoſe wilfull and rayſhe affectyons. ſo dangerous a thyng is it to be ſeruant unto the deuyl who would haue all men creatyd, unto the ſimilitude of god, and redemyd withe the mooſt pretious blud of his only ſonne, to be theternall ueſſelles of godes yre and uengens as he is hymſelf. Ando to bryng thys wykyd purpoſe to paſſe he uſithe not one ſimple and playne way but a thouſand crafftye, and falſe ſubtiltes as he ſeithe occation promptyng to euery mannys

nature and inclynation, the ſynne that he is mooſt prone and dyſpoſyd unto aud leauyth not the man that he aſſaultithe, untill ſouche tyme as he opttyne the uictorye. Except the wrechyd man kepe hymſelfe with dread and fere, under the protectyon of godes mercye and deſyre hym with ardent, uehement and daylye prayer, that in Chryſt he may reſiſt the forſe of his mortall ennymy, who is finall pretence is none other then to beryue the ſoule of man of the ioyſe eternall, and to haue hyme his companyon for euer, to courſe the lyuyng god and to blaſpheme his holy name without end, but theſe temtations in Chryſt we may ouer come, he came into the worold to deſtroye the workes of the deuill, 1. Ioan. 2. and no man may better ouer come the deuill, then he that is well perſwadyd of his malycyous and inſaciable yre towardes god and man, knowith and felyth in hymſelfe that he is mortall ennymy booth unto god and unto all his mooſt perfet workes, redy allways to peruert godes order in all thyngis. as we may to oure payne perceaue in oure ſelfes, the ſoule that was, creatyd unto the ſimilitude of god, replynyſhyd with all uertewe and grace, full of knolege prudence, and undreſtondyng, in all thyngys appertaynyng unto god, a hart mooſt gentle, humble, and allwayes obedyent unto god and godlynys, a wyl mooſt redy and prompt to imbraſe, choſe, and elect, the thyngis godlye, and eſchewe refuſe and auoyde what ſo euer god and reaſon iudgyd to be yle, but now it is contrary, for knolege, ignorancy, for light darkenys, for obedience, contumacy and rebellyon of hart boothe agaynſt god and his word, and for

a will that would be inclynyd and choſe nothyng but uertewe. and ſouch thyngis as might mooſt appertayne unto the glory of god, a will that now choſith nothyng leſſe, then toſerue god and rather to blaſpheme god, then to refuſe thyle offryd by the deuyll contrarye unto god. thus is man ſpoylyd of all his orygnnall ryches, dayly woundyd more and more woundes, freſhe, and newe, now percid with this ſyne now with that ſynnes, and yet lik unto men of no ſenſes, we fyle, nether perceaue, how, nether when we ar woundyd, nether care to ſyke a remedye of thys yle, thowgh ryght well we knowe, that euery ſyne that man committyth, of iuſtyce deſeruythe eternall damnation, but theſe thyngz mouyth nothyng at all, the man that is ignorant what the deuyll, the worold and ſynne is, he felyth nether what his dyſeace is, nether knowith the craufft, malyce, and deceyte of his Ennymy, and by thoſe meanes, departithe not only from god but alſo from all honeſty, and fallith, he knowith not how into ſouche deteſtable crymes, and ignorancye of god, that booth god the worold and there awne conſciens baryth teſtimonye of there iniquite agaynſt them. theſe oure infyrmytes and great offenſis we muſt lern to know, and ons knowen, diligently ſtudy to amend them, and to remoue the cauſes of theſe yles, then the effect is ſone deſtroyde. the way to remedy all thys yle and to leade an upright and honeſt lyffe is to know god by hys trew an holy word who ledyth a man unto uertew only and ſo lye, as dauyd teachyth Pſal. 119. quo pacto adoleſcens uitam inculpatam aget? nempe ſi eam cuſtodiat, ut dictat uerbum

And hath taken from the ſupper, the thing that weſe we touche, we taſte, we eat we drynke and we ſwalow throwghe the throte, to ſay bread and wyne, As the Apoſtelles dyd and yeat ſay it is no bread nor wyne. If it be alteryd ſome were beſt that beſt can mayntayne alye to ſhew how and by what wordes it is changyd. By theſe wordes hoc eſt, it is not done. For noman can do more by the uertewe of thoſe wordes then Chriſt him ſelfe. Now Chriſt by theſe wordes declaryd that it was his body. And not made his body. Then muſt ye ſhewe theother wordes that wrowght this meruelous tranſubſtancion. Or elſe we ſhuld make Chriſt alyer who is the fontayne of all ueryte and truyth. But ſouch as defend thys alteracion of breade rather then they would ſay that by the

wordes of Chriſt, Hoc eſt corpus meum, were not made the uery body of Chriſt. They will expound thys uerb (eſt) per fit. And ſay thus, that by the poure of god and uertewe of his wordes ſpoken by the miniſter, the ſubſtannce of the breade is alteryd into the ſubſtannce of Chriſte bodi. So is Chriſtes bodi made preſent by this word eſt. But thys interpretacion the lettre without atrope will not admyt. Nether that eſt ſchuld be expoundyd by fit. Nether that the bread ſhuld be made the body of Chriſt, but that it is already the body of Chriſt before theſe wordes be ſpoken, Hoc eſt corpus meum. If it be not before he calle it the body, why dooth he lye then. And call it other wyce then it is. If it be the body as he ſayth it is by what wordes of the ſcripture hath he made the breade te body and the wyne the bludd. By theſe wordes, hoc eſt corpus meum, there is nether breade nether wyne alteryd. But the text ſayeth that the bread is the body, and the wyne the blud. Which this new doctrine will not admyt that bread ſhuld be booth bread and alſo the it glorious body of Chriſt. For then duo corpora eſſent ſimul in eodem loco. Which indeade reaſon will not graunt. Nomore then it is poſſible that à trew body may be, and yet ocopy no place. Souch as would defend a wyckyd and mooſt damnable purpoſe good reader Cleane contrary to the nature of thys uerbe (eſt) expound it per fit. Yet would they blynd the people and ſay thei uſe plainely with out trope Chriſte wordes, and with opē mōthe cry out upon ſouche as booht reuently godly and lernydly botth wryt uſe and ſpeak of the ſacramentz and ſay they be heretikes people depertid

from god and all uertewe. When they them ſelfes uſe ſouch à trope as the ſcripture frō the begynnyng to the latter end, neuer uſith ſe there trope in theſe wordes, Hoc eſt corpus meum. Chriſt ſayde takeye, eat of this, this ys my body The popes doctrine ſayth, Vnder the forme of bread is Chriſtes bodye. Thow ſeyſt that Chriſt ſayd not ſo but ſayd that the bread was his body. As no dout it was, if Chriſtis meanyng betaken as well as his wordes as it muſt be of euery Chriſtianeman and where Chriſt ſayd eſt. They underſtond. Fit and teach Chriſt to ſpeake, as thowghe he could not for lack of wordes conuenient, expreſſe his mynd in this mater. But theſe wordes of the ſupper diligently conſyderyd, and one Euangeliſt conferrid with the other with iudgment, it may eſely be ſeen, that theſe wordes hoc eſt corpus meum, mak no more for the tranſubſtanciacy on of the bread and the wynne. Then in noua fert animus. Mutatas dicere formas, corpora, prouith, Verbum caro factum eſt, & habitabit in nobis. For if the bread and the wynne, be not really and ſubſtancially the corporall and naturall body of Chriſt, this word eſt. Prouith nothing at all, and when they interpretat theſe wordes, Hoc eſt corpus meum. An ſay that under the form of bread is the body of Chriſt. I will not admyt that interpretacion. For aſmouch as it hath no good ground nether in the ſcripture nether in the auncient doctors as I ſhall declare here a

With the bread, in the bread or under the bread. Chriſt uſyd none of theſe termes nor yet the holy fathers. But playnly ſayd. This ys my body that ys broken for youe and. Where as Chriſt ſayſe (this is) they ſay (under this forme) hereys à uery playne trope and figuratiue loquucion. Men ſeyth that they admyt metonomian, and ſay under the forme of breade is the trew bodye of Chriſt. Thowgh it be aſfalſe as godis trew that they ſay. Adome thyng without ſenſes, is no harbor nor duelling place, for Chriſtes precious body, nor for the ſpryt of god. But the penitent & ſoroufull hart of the Chriſtiane by fayth logyth this gooſtlye and ſpirituall geſtes. The ſoule of man creatyd unto the ſimilitude of god. By fayth is made the temple of god. To liue in all uertew and godly conuerſacion ffolowing the ſtappes of Chriſt, and to exalt the trewth of his afflyctid and perſequutid church till ye cum. Let theſe that defend this alteracion of bread do that them ſelfes whych they require of other, and interpretat the wordes of Chriſt with out ony trope. And then they may the better accuſe other men that uſe atrope. Incaſe they ſuppoſe there troppe and maner of ſpeach under the form of brcade, may better be made godd by the maner and fraunſe of the ſcripture, then this trope that we uſe to call à ſacrament, by the name of the thing that is ſignifiet by the ſacrament, The ſupper of the lord, the lordes body, preſent at the contemplacy on of fayth in ſpryt, ſpiritually, and not corporally. For aſmouch as I truſt I haue ſufficiently declarid that the papeſtes dooth uſe atrope. I would they ſhuld name there trope, and proue it tobe trew by the

ſcripture that may warrant there trope to be good they may not confirme there ſaynges with an old wyues tale and ſay that the holy fathers belyuid ſo. For the contrary wilbe prouid that thauncynt fathers belyuid as Chriſt tawght. For booth they and euery man muſt be iudgid by the ſcripture. Now likwyce to the other part of the ſacrament. If the will refer this pronowne hoc only unto the ſigne & ad rem ſimbolicam. Behold Luk & Paule and thow ſhalt fee playnely, that nether Chriſt callyd the winne that the Apoſtelles drank his blud, nether, the priſt if he beliue Luke and Paule ſhuld not ſay, that under the forme of winne is Chriſtes bludd But under the forme of the cuppe or chalyce is the blud of Chriſt. For Chriſtis wordes be theſe. Hoc poculum eſt nouum teſtamentum in meo ſanguine. Why dooth the priſt ſpeak of the form of winne when Chriſt ſpeake of the cuppe and not of the winne. If there be no trope to be admyttyd in the wordes of the ſupper (I will not admit this figure continens pro contento) let them proue the goldin chalice, tobe tranſubſtanciatid into the bludd. And ſay there remaynith nor gold nor ſyluer. The ſubſtannce of the gold is chaungyd into the ſubſtannce of the blud of Chriſt. And then let them drink the chalice as well as the winne. And dout no more of godes poure in the cuppe, then in the Breade. For he that ſayed by the bread this ys my body. Sayd likwyce at the ſame tyme that the cuppe was the new teſtament. And byd them drink of it them all, and if Hoc eſt corpus meum. Can alter tho ſubſtance of the bread then can, Hic calix eſt nouum teſtamentum, alter the

ſubſtannce of the chalice and then as the eat the bread, they ſhuld drink alſo the chalice for theſe wordes of the cuppe were ſpoken by Chriſt booth god and man. The ſame word ſpoken by the ſame Apoſtellis in one ſprit, at one tyme, for one purpoſe, to one and to the ſame end, and he that can change the bred with, hoc eſt corpus meum.

If it were my porpoſe to reaſon that mater I would get great ayede out of other his workes to ſerue myne opinion. And as for thexcuſe of the mydwiues Chriſtening. By thexample of Zippora moſes wief Exo. 4. that circunſicid in the time of nede it may not proue the myd wiffes fact tobe godd. For of one priuat and ſinguler fact, nomam may make à generall law. Epiphanius that great clerk libro 3. contra hereſes, To. 2. cap. 79. prouith mine opinion with ſtrong argumentes, Si mulieribus praeceptū eſſet ſacrificare deo, aut regulariter quicquam agere in eccleſia, oportebat magis ipſum mariam ſacrificium perficere in nouo teſtamento &c. at non placuit, read the chapiter, Moſes was in danger of death becauſe he neglectyd the commanndemet of god whyche was to circunſice the viij day. Ge. 17. As he ſuppoſid after the iudgment of the fleſh it ſhuld haue hindrid the chyldes health be cauſe they had along Iourney to trauell. Souch good intencions contrary unto the word of god weſe cruelly reuengyd diuerſe times. The ſacramentes muſt be uſyd as they be commaundyd, and to the ſame end that they be commanndyd. The miniſteri of Chriſtes church cheyffly dependyth in the preaching of the goſpell, and the miniſtracion of the ſacramentes, and as the preaching of the word is not thoffyce of awoman, no more is the miniſtracion of the ſacramentes.

Sphragizo ſignifieth. Sigillo notare, inſignire & concludere By the which word an text of Paule it is manifeſt, that by the ſacramentes, godes promeſes be not fyrſt yeuen unto man. But that by the ſacramentes the promes receauid, is confirmid. For Paule diſcernit applicationem gratiae, ab ipſa circunciſione, as in the ſame 4. chapiter he ſhe with more playnely. Wher he declaryth the condicion of Abraam, what he was before he receauid this ſacrament, prouith hym fyrſt to be the frend of god credidit Abraam deo & imputatum eſt ei, ad iuſticiam. As aman fyrſt aſſuryd of god he receauid this ſacrament, and ſawght not fyrſt to find hym in an externall ſigne.

Rom. 5. Iudas by the ſacrament, receauyd not the promeſe, nor by the ſacrament was preſeruid from deſperacion Matt. 26. But he that will be the frend of god and godly uſe his ſacramētes muſt uſe them after the forme preſcribid by hyme only. And know what à à ſacrament is by him. To ſay an hody ceremoni, a work of the thyrd commaundement. Who ſayth memento ut diem ſabbati ſanctifices Exo. 20. and before the workes of the thyrd communndement wherin all ceremonies ar conteynid muſt allwayes precead, the workes of the fyrſt cōmaundement and of the ſeconde, an inward faith an certayne knolege of god, and an owtward profeſſion of his holy name, to acertayne the church, that he is godes ffrende, and reconſilid in Chriſt, or elſe it were à praepoſterous order to ſet the cart before the horſe. Lik as if the Kynges maieſtis officers, ſhuld yeue his lyuery, unto him that the Kyng neuer ment, to take into his ſeruiſe. So to were, his liuere without profeit. Thus I deſyrid to admoniſhe the good Chriſtiane reader of, before I entryd the diſputacion of this mooſt holy cauſe

Paule ſayth not, Hic panis eſt communio corporis Chriſti, as thowgh we ſhuld thinke, that he ſpake of the bread only. But with playne wordes ſayth, Panis quem frangimus, to declare that the bread is not the ſacramēt of Chriſtes body, till it be broken unto the church, according to thinſtitucion of Chriſte à ſpirituall meat. As Paule callith it, ſo that the bread lyffte upp ouer the pryſtes hed, nor kept in the boxe is not the ſacrament, but the bread ryghtly diſtributid. And in the ſame place he callith the bread broken, the table of the lord by the whiche is undreſtond thole inſtitucion of Chriſtes ſupper. And where men contend ſo much of this word corpus repeting thole hoc corpus meum. Sainct Paule the trew interpretour of Chriſtes wordes, reſoluith them thus. Nonne panis quē frangimus communio corporis Chriſti eſt. Where Chriſt ſayd this is my body: Paule ſayth, is not the bread that we breake à communion of the body of Chriſt.

And prouith his propoſicion deducing his argument à comparatis if thiſrae lites, in etyng the ſacryfices dedicatyd unto god, were participant of the thing that the ſacrifices were offryd for. Then ſouch as eat of meates dedicatyd unto ydoles were pertakers of the ſame religion wherfore this meates unto ydoles were offryd. The firſt part of the reaſon is trew by the wordes that he à legith out of Moſes. Videte Iſraclem, iuxta carnem &c. They were ſuer to be pertakers of the temple that eat the meat dedicatyd into the temple. So were they ſure that eat of the meates dedicatyd unto ydoles, pertakers of ydolatrye. Therefore Paule concludith thus. Non poteſtis poculum domini bibere, & poculum daemoniorum. Non poteſtis menſae domini participes eſſe, & menſae daemoniorum. They that communicatid with the fideles, were participant of there religion: they that communicatid with ydolatres, were like wyce participant of the ydolatrie. Now the ſame wayes that thinfideles were participant of the deuilles that they worſhippid, the ſame wayes the fideles we reparticipant of Chriſtes body: in falſe fayth were the knyt and unit unto the deuill in trew fayth the fideles unit unto Chriſt. And as the ydolatres dyd not by hand with the meat dedicatyd unto ydoles exhibit and delyuer the deuill to him that eat of the deuilles ſacrament, ſo thoſe that eat of the bread broken by the miniſter, as Chriſt commaunded had not the body of Chriſt deliueryd by hand unto them but

So dooth Paules argument procede that becauſe wear by fayth one body myſtically with Chriſt we eat of one myſticall bread, to teſtifie the ſame, Quoniam inquit, unus panis & unum corpus multi ſumus, Nam omnes ex eodem pane participamus 1. Corin. 10. Paule in this place put too churches, one of Chriſte, and thother of the deuill all thoſe at Corinth that were of Chriſtes church, came unto Chriſtes ſacrament, participatyd and communicatyd with the companye and ſociete of Chriſtes body, ſouch as were infideles, or ſouche as were nether hot nor cold aſſociatyd them ſelfes with lik unto then ſelfes. And ſo declaryd manyfeſtly, that they were of the deuill, as the other wer of god, not that the deuill was yeuen I ſay by hand (perauenture he had other buſinis at Epheſus or other where) but it ſufficid him that his membres aſſemblyd to gather and ty participaciō of the meat dedicatyd unto his ydoles, in ſprit communicatid with his ſprit.

But alſo the teſtimony and Example of the primatiue church. Not to ſtablyſhe there fayth becauſe it was ſo uſid of antiquite: But becauſe they ſawe, there elders uſe the worde of god in the ſame ſenſes that they dyd. As Epiphanius wrytithe of one peter biſhope of Alexandriae whom the Tyrannt Maximinus put to death: in this peters tyme there was one Meletius that ſo wid à falſe doctrine, and ſayd that euery ſinne

Peter reſiſtit not only by the ſcripture. But alſo that the diſciples of the Apoſteles condemnyd this doctrine for an hereſie the lik may ye rede inthiſtorie of Ioan the Apoſtele apud Euſeb. li. 3. pag. 60.

Were it not to ſatisfie the weake conſcience of thoſe that yet be ignorant of the truith (I would not in this mater of the ſacrament reherſe the mynd of one doctor becauſe we may ſo fully and playnely know by thonly ſcripture what the ſupper is and how it ſhuld be uſid) and think that ſouche as hath wroten of late dayes to be the firſt autors of this doctrine, that the holy ſupper of the lord ſhuld be acommunion and no priuat maſſe or receauing of the ſacrament by one man, no thowgh danger of death ſeme to require the ſame.

Theſe wordes and the breaking of the bread betwene him and his Chriſtiane brother, dooth certifie him that the yre of god was greatagaynſt ſinne, that would not other wyce be ſatisfied, then by the death of Chriſt his only ſonne, No godly hart can iudge ſinne to be lightyle, that was purchyd with ſo meruclous à death and ineſtimable pryce.

He that is not mouid, nor ferd with this thowghtes of godes ire and the death of Chriſt, in eating, and receauing the ſacrament undreſtondith not what the ſacrament meanith.

Chriſt commaundyd this ceremonie to break the bread among the hole congregacion, that by the doyng therof the might return unto trew repētaynce and thinke when they break the bread and drink of that holy drinke, that as they breake the bread and drink of the cuppe, ſo it was there ſinne and there fathers, that cauſid Chriſt to dye. This ceremony is godly and thus dooth the ſcripture permit to interpretat the doing of the ſupper, and not to breake the bread ſecreatly with per eundem dominū noſtrum Chriſtum filium

Accipite & māducate, take ye and ete ye, it agreyth nothing with à ſacrament that they do. They haue not aſmouch as one place of the ſcripture that ſpeaky the of à priuate maſſe, baring it about in proſeſſion or Keping it in the box. Beſide that they applye it to an other end, then it was inſtitutid for and make it of no leſe ualew then the death of Chriſt, who ons for all ſacrificid himſelfe for ſinne upon the croſſe Ebre. 9. 10. They cannot tell what this word offerre meanith. When they ſay they offer the ſonne of god. It is a great mater to offerr hym, it is to acknolege thire of god agaynſt the ſinne of the worold, and to ſubmit himſelfe unto this yre. And to be amediatoure betwene god and man kind, and likewice he muſt entre the holy of holynis unto god. Therefore it is ſayde Hebr. 9. Per proprium ſanguinem intrauit ſemel in ſancta ſanctorum, aeternam redemptionem inueniens, alſo: Qui ſpiritu aeterno ſeipſum obtulit inculpatum deo. It is an horrible hereſy to ſay that Chriſt is offrid in the maſſe for ſinne. Chriſt ons offrid himſelfe, it is oure office to confeſſe and acknolege, that only oblation ons offrid and to beliue that by the uertew of it god is pleacid only

and all oure lyffe yeue thankes to god for it. Let the godly people conſider theſe thinges, and conform them ſelfes unto the example of the primatiue churche, and let the new maſſinges goo. I know that many men, gatherit out of the ſcripture many places. To defend this here ſie of the maſſe. But it ſhalbe thoffice of euery godly man diligentlye to decerne and iudge, notha ac adulterina teſtimonia à ueris. The maner of the Apoſteles conſerning this holy ſupper is beſt to be obſeruid. ffirſt in the church there ſhuld be reherſid, ſome godly leſſons out of the ſcripture in atong knowen. The people inſtructyd with an holy ſermon, not out of the ffeſtiuall nor legēda aurea. But out of the holy bible. Then ſhuld there be commune prayere. ffyrſt for remiſſion of ſinne, and the mytigacion of the peyne condign for the ſinne ffor althowgh theſe too concurre to gather remiſſion of ſinne, and delyueraunce from eternall payne yet dooth god many times, puniſhe the tranſgreſſours with wounderfull afflictions in this liefe, as it may be ſeyne by Dauid, and Manaſſes with other and to be ſhort what troble or aduerſite ſo euer we ſee in this world thei be ſacramentes and ſignes, that god is diſpleaſid with oure ſinnes, how be it the priſt or miniſter hath no poure to bind man to do this or that, to ſay this prayet or that prayer his office is only to ſhew by the word of god godes iuſtice agaynſt ſinne, and godes mercy in Chriſt to ſouch as repent and commyt the reſt to god. Who ſome tyme puniſhith in this worold, and ſumn tyme puniſhythe not. It is yet the cuſtome of thold churche to excommunicat ſouche as were commune adulterers, couitous per

ſones 1. Cor. 5. Idolatres, blaſphemer, ſlaunderers. Dronkerdes, and extorſioners and ſouche as for fere denied the goſpell of Chriſt. Except they, did open penitence. Which was accommendable uſe and godly act. don to yeue other men fere leſte they ſhuld commit like offence, alſo it was agodd exploracion of the tranſgreſſours conſciens whether his penitence were trew or faynid. But ye muſt undreſtond that this act and diſcipline of the church, is but an act polytik and ciuile to ſouche as hath profeſſid to lyue in the commune wealthe of Chriſtes church in an order leſt that the uicious liefe of the perſon ſhuld be aſlaunder unto the word of god, this open penannce apertaynith not unto the conſciens or remiſſion of ſinne before god, which is don only for the penaunce of Chriſt. Therfore the churche muſt be diligently intructid of the doctrine cōſerning remiſſion of ſinne before god. It muſt know the differaunce betwene the remiſſion of the defaulte, and the remiſſion of temporall payne in the which god would many times his diſpleaſure ſhuld be knowen agaynſt ſinne, as in the peyne of Dauid and Manaſſes. There is no church can be gouernid without this diſcipline for where as it is not, there ſe we, no godlynis at all but carnall libertye, and uicicious liffe. As in the commune wealth where à thiffe is as mouche eſtimid as à trew man, à brawler and breaker of the peace, as an honeſt citicyne, for à concluſion where as uertew is not commendid, and uice puniſhyd, the commune wealthe ſhall ſone com to cōfuſion. Theyle doers were all wayes puniſhid and bauiſhid the company of the godd, not only among Chriſtiane

princes and in the lawe of god 1. Cor. 5. but alſo among the grekes and Etnyckis ſouch as cōmittid murder and inceſt were excōmunicatid. And loſt not only there offices in the commune wealth but were put out of the companie of all honeſt men and markid with à ſigne in the upper ueſtement, that all men might know him to be as he was aman to be auoydid, and none to eat nor drinke with him, as long as he bore that ſigne as it is to be ſene by Oreſtes, peleus, Antilochus.

And declarith them ſelfes to be more contumelious agaynſt thē the lewys agaynſt the law. Euery lew knew right well that there ſacramentes were ſufficiently preſcribid and tawght unto them by the expreſſe word of the ſcripture. Theſe maſſers ſay that they can amend the form that Chriſt gaue, and celebrate the ſupper with more religion then the ſcripture teachith. And of à communion they make à priuat maſſe. And defend the ſame as athing of all thinges mooſt holye. Doutles if there ſayng be trew and there maſſe of ſouche

That he would not his churche ſhuld haue the uſe of the ſacramentes, playnly knowen by his teſtament as the uſe of the ſacramentes unto oure fathers we re knowyn by the lawe, ffortunat then were thoſe that were of thold church before Chriſt was born: for they were certayne of there ceremonies and ſacramentes by the expreſſe word of god, which cannotlye, but we in the time of the goſpell as they ſaye muſt belyue the doctrine and tradicion of man, and obligat booth body and ſoule unto the ſame, as unto à treuth infallible, and prefer it before the word of god. For wher the word ſaith one thing thei ſay an other. The ſcripture that affirmith the ſupper to be à communion, they ſay it muſt be apriuat Maſſe. Chriſt ſaid, Bibite ex eo omnes. And ſo ſayd Paule 1. Cor. 11. they ſay thone kind is ſufficient for the people. Had ony doctor amūg the Iewis uſid ſouch Ablaſphemy agaynſt the law of Moſes, the people would not haue browght the doctor unto the ſcoles to haue diſputid the mater, but before the iudge to haue had ſentence of death agaynſt him, that they might haue ſlayne the blaſphemoure with ſtones. Vnto us that be Chriſtians agaynſt Chriſtes law they may ſay what the liſt, and haue good thank for there labour. Better eare ys gyuen unto the word of man then unto the word of god. Atale of an old tubbe, better hard then à godly ſermon of the new teſtament. People could neuer haue binne browght unto this contempt of goddes truithe had not the deuill, and the deuilliſhe lawes of biſhopes takin the word of god from them wherin only is declarid

God of his mercy turn them to his fayth, and then I dout not they will more auayunce godes goſpell, then we, and better kepe the word of god in honor with out falſe gloſes then we.

As Paule ſayth aſcendit ut adimpleret omnia Ephe 4. he aſcendyd to fullfill all thinges, not with his corpor all preſence as ſome men ſay, but to fullfill all thinges that was wroten of him in the law, the prophetes, and Pſalmes and to leue us à ſacrament of his bleſſid ſacrifice in the church, to be ameroy of that glorious deathe untill the woroldes end. Whyche ſacrament is not abare ſigne and token of his death only, as many men imagine as the picture of hercles, is hercles. Or the imayge of Iubiter, to be iubiter. But I put aſmouch difference betwene the ſacramentes of Chriſt, and all other ſignes and tokens not apoyntid for ſacramentes. As I do betwen the ſeale of Aprince, that is annexid unto te wryting or charter that conteinith all the princes right and title that he hathe unto his Realme, and the Kynges armis pentid in à glaſſe window. ſouch ſeales annexid unto ſo waighty wrytinges be no leſſe eſtemyd, then thole right, title, or Cleme that is confirmid by the ſeale, thowghe the mater of the ſeale be nothing but wax, not for the ualew of the mater, for too pence will by ten times aſmouche wex. But for the uſe that the mater is apoyntid unto. And he that would take upon him to deny the Kynges ſeale in ſouch à purpoſe and ſay, it is but apece of wax it were noleſe then treaſon and à uery contempt of the Kyng him ſelfe. Becauſe the kyng hathe apoyntid that ſeale to be honorable receauid and reuerently uſid of all men. And as the wrytinges ſealyd dooth confirme and declare the right of the honowre unto all he worold, ſo

dooth the ſacramentes confirm thaſſurannce of euer laſting liefe unto the fayth fulles, and declarith the ſame to all the worold. And as the mater, ſubſtance, and land itſelfe is not corporally, nor really conteynid in the wryting nor annexid to the writing
                  •
                nether browght (when ony mater of contrauerſie is for the lond) before the iudge with the wryting Nomore is the corporall body of Chriſt browght before the church ne

But when the miniſter delyuerith unto me the thing that is in his poure to delyuer to ſay the bread and wynne reherſing the wordes of Chriſtes inſtitucion, the holy gooſt deliuerithe unto my fayth which is mountyd and aſcendid into heauen the precious body and bludd of my ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt ſpiritually, and not corporally, ſo dooth the merites of this precious body in heauē fede my poure wrechid ſoule upon therthe, and no contradiction or impoſſibilite for Chriſtes body ſo to do. It may be in heauen and yet extend his uerteue by the operacion of the holy goſt into my ſoule by the meanes of fayth, which at the time of the receauing of this ſacrament is in my ſoule and out my ſoule, as the ſprit of god is, in euery godly hart and out of the hart in heauen with god, ſo was god at the creacion of man unto his awnelyknice in man, and out of man. Yet to make it more playne as the ſone in heauen dooth extend downe his beames, and ligthyn the hearthe. So dooth Chriſtes body, by fayth in ſprit, expulſe all darknis and ſinne out of the hart mouith not bodely, but is euery where, where faythe is ſpiritually, an at one tyme

Accedamus ad tronum gratiae, ut miſericordiam & gratiam & axilium opportunum inueniamus, Calling the trone of grace our ſole mediatour: to ſay the peace maker betwē god and man. This body of Chriſt is only in heauen and no where elſe, as Io ſayth 1. Epiſt. 2. ſo dooth Auguſt. writ tractat in Ioan. 30. Surſum eſt dominus, & iterum corpus enim domini reſurrexit, in uno loco oportet eſſe, ſo dooth the maſter of the ſentence alege his wordes, and not, in uno loco eſſe poteſt, as the later edicion redith. How ffonde doctrine the ſcole men teachith it is playne. Lambertus in the ſentence innocentius in the decretales. De ſumma trinitate, & fide Cath. ca. ffirmiter, and Nicolaus pape de conſec.

For aſſone as they haue confeſſid the breade to be the eſſenciall, and ſubſtanciall body of Chriſt, and the wyne, his naturall bludd they add, ſed inuiſibiliter & ineffabiliter, & non ut in loco, non qualitatiue, ant quantitatiue. So doth Thomas aquinas parte 3. Quaeſt 76. and Lombertus lib. ſentent. 4. Diſtinct. 10. ſophiſtically diſpute the mater. Is it not à wounder that men will not mark what contradiction is in there wordes, ffirſt the ſay Chriſtes uery naturall corporall, phiſicall, ſubſtanciall and reall body is in the ſacrament.

of Moſes Ge. 17. Hoc eſt pactum meum. And ſaith that Abraam receauid Sphragida iuſticiae quae per fidē apprehenditur and ſayth playnly, that circunſicion was not the allyance betwene god and Abraam. But the cō

               ng knowen men muſt tak hede they attribute nomore, nor no leſſe unto the ſignes then is to be attributid of right. And what ſo euer uerteue be repreſentid by the ſigne, yet muſt weiudge of the ſigne according unto the nature of the ſigne, As in the time of war if the Capitayne, ether by aword, ether by holding upp of his hand would ſignifie unto the reſt of the hooſt when they ſhuld marche forthe, or retyre backe it is nether the word, nether the beck of the hand, that is the marching for the or retyring backe. But theſe ſignes declarithe unto the ſouldiers when they ſhuld go backe or for the by thexamples of the ſcriptures I will make it more playne that euery man ſhall be able to iudge aright of à ſigne Red the 10. chapiter of Num. Where as the childrem of Iſrael departid from the deſert of Sinai, into the deſert of Pharan in warr like order, euery man apoyntid unto his

Capitayne, and under what Baner he ſhuld. Be euery man that was of the tribe of Iuda to be under Nahſon the generall Capitayne of that tribe, and under his baner. Souche as were of the Tribe of Iſachar to be under Nethanaeel and his baner They of the Trybe of Zebu lon under Elyab and his baner, and ſo forthe as it is wroten in that chapiter. Now note what à ſigne is in this place à marke or open token where by euery man in the hooſt knew unto what capitayne and cōpanie he ſhuld reſort and when euery man was in his proper place, the one knew by theſe ſignes and banners of what lynayge and progenie the othere was. Here ſeyſt thow Chriſtiane reader, what à ſigne is, à declaracion of the perſon un to what capitayne and Trybe he apperteynid. The ſignes made Noman of the Trybe of Iuda but declarid him that was in that ward to be of the Trybe of Iuda. Here is the ſigne and the thing ſignified by the ſigne well declarid. Now were it yle don to call the banner and ſigne the Trybe of Iuda and ſay the ſigne were the thing repreſentyd by the ſigne. The ſigne therefore of euery thing muſt be iudgid after his nature if it be clothe the to ſay it is cloth: if Aman ſhuld haue made à garmēt of the baner of Iuda, à ſayle clothe, or ony couering for ſouch thinges as were in the tabernacle, they would haue iudgid aright as the thing was and callid it à cote of clothe.

               ng to the mater where of it was made. When the keys of ony cite or
                  •
                towne be offrid unto temperoure, or prince, as unto the ſupreme, gouerner therof it is à ſigne and ſacrament of the citicens obedience unto the prince to whom thei be deliuerid, but if ony

man would aſke what the ſigne of this obedience were, euery man would auſwer it is à kay, or kays, and not the ſub
                  •
               ectes obedience under the form of à knay. Or elſe ſay that the Citie and Citycins be turnid into the knayes or the knays into the Cyte or Citicince or ony ſouch like frace. But they know that obedience is in the hart, and à ſigne of the obedience is the knayes. For incaſe the prince had no better aſſuraynce and warrant of the Cyticins obedience, then is conteynid really and ſubſtancially in the keis, they might be ffraude alure him with falſe hope unto the gates of the Cytie, and then bolt the gates within ſide agaynſt him, and not only kepe hym out of the Cytie, but alſo by treaſon put him out of his liefe then receauid he nothing in the kayes. Like wyce if ony man ſhuld fayne himſelfe to be the prince of the Citie and the Cytiens unwares therof ſhuld deliuer the kays and affer the deliueraynce know that he is not there trew prince, well he may kepe the ſacrament and externall ſigne of there obedience, but he ſhall not entre the Cytie ony thing the rather. Now with this ſigne this countre fetid prince receauithe not at all the thing ment by the ſigne. Nomore then he that was of the Trybe of Dan could make himſelfe of the trybe of Iuda, with ſtanding under the baner of ſigne of luda. They ſay that the ſigne is not only à ſigne of the thing, that it ſignifiyth, but alſo there is cōteynid in the ſigne and with the ſigne the thing that it ſignifieth. That is not ſo. No ſigne inſomouch as it is à figne can be the ſigne, and the thing mēt by the ſigne god commaundid the Children of Iſrael to blowe the ſiluer trompetes when they entryd batell

agaynſt there ennimies that there by they might remembre that god had not for goten them, yet was not the mercye of god and there uictory incloſid in the trompetes. So theſe ſignes in the ſacramentes, becauſe of godes promis and contract made with his churche, ar tokens that god will yeue the thing ſignified by the ſacramētes.

To declare his obedience unto God, and by the uſe of theſe ſacramētes to manifeſt the liuing god unto the worold and yeue occacion to other for to do the ſame.

They haue browght into te church of Chriſt great darkenis and to mouch cauſid the ſignes of the ſacramentes to be eſte mid. They ſhall not be contemnit nothing the rather thowghe there right uſe and nature be knowen god for bide that ony Chriſtiane man ſhuld ſpeke againſt them. But it is the office of eueri mā to know the maner of ſpeche in the ſcripture, and to iudge according ūto the meaning, of the wordes and not as thei ſound only, for then ſhuld we make diuerse godes where as it but one.

But the ſubſtance remaynid allwayes, and not douttid there of. Great meruell is that Chriſtiane men knowith not the maner of ſpeche conſerning à ſacrament as well as the lewes.

Therefore the lawe of god, the goſpell of Chriſt and his ſacramentes be the tradicions of Moſes and the Apoſteles. They ſpeak neuer of them ſelfes, and gaue nothing of there awne braynes unto the churches. But Moſes and the prophetes ſayd this all waye: ſic dicit dominus. So ſaythe Paule, Ego accepi à domino quod

tradidi uobis. And god toke ffrom the prophetes and the Apoſteles all auctorite cleane that they ſhuld ſpeake nothing in te churche but as they were tawght. Sic dices filijs Iſraell: Praedicate ea quae ego dixi uobis Matt. 28. I will councell the Chriſſiane reader to leaue the bookes of men and lern the ſcripture who only teachithe all trewthe and right uſe of the ſacramentes. And to folow the councell of Cypriane

                traditionem reuertamur, et inde ſurgat actus noſtri ratio unde & ordo & origo ſurrexit. The ſcripture and tradicion of the Apoſteles we muſt ffolow. The Maſſe hathe nether god ner the ſcripture, nor honeſty that defendythe it. for lak of auctoryte they gangle an old wiefes tale, that gracianus theachythe. Rede of the foundacion and founders of the Maſſe more apud Polydorum urbinam de rerum inuentoribus, lib. 5. cap. 9. & 10. This is a-wofull doctryne to preache unto the people that lackyth a father. My lord tellythe atalle of Ananias that was ſent to Pāule Acto. 9. and of Moſes that lead the Chyldron of Iſrael in the deſert yet were they belyuyd of the people. But why? Ananias ſayd: Saule frater, dominus miſit me ad te. ſo ſayd Moſes, ſo ſayd the Prophetes whē ſo euer the prechyd or tawght ony thyng. We can proue by the ſcripture that they were ſent from god. Now

theſe menne that cum to the people with tranſubſtācion we know by the ſcripture they ar agaynſt god and his trewthe, therfore people muſt ffolow this commaundement of Paule: Omnia probate, quod bonum eſt tenete. For the ſcripture cōdemnythe thoſe that preachith there awgne imagynatiōs and diſhonorithe the truithe. God for byd that oni ſhuld condēne Moſes or the Prophetes or now hym that prechythe the word of the lyuyng god he commendyd Moſes and other that preachyd trewly and condemnythe ſouche as preachythe falſly. And wher my lord ſaythe that in the 24. of luce and the ſecond of the actes, that the ſupper of the lord was uſid under one kyne of breade that is not ſo. Thowghe only bread be namid yet was there wyne miniſtrid likwyce for Chriſt is lik unto himſelfe all wayes, and would not be à breaker of his awne inſtitucion under boothe kindes. Thowghe there be but one made menciō of in this place. My lord is not ignorant that bread is taken in the ſcripture for the hole ffeſt and bāket as we ſee Gen. 18. in the pater noſter we ſay panē noſtrū quotidianum da nobis hodie. And by the bread undreſtond all thinges neceſſari for the body. Victum pacem, defenſionem, bonam uoletudinem &c. This maner of ſpeache was allſo uſid among the gentiles. As Eraſmus wrytithe in ſymbola Pythagorae, Panem inquit ne frangito. The gentiles at the making of peace and lowdes eat togather in one ffeſt whiche was as à confirmacion of the peace. So doothe Chriſtiane men when they be at peace with god throwghe Chriſt. And as the Ethnikes were admoniſhid to kepe the peace reconſilid by there ſacramentes ſo

be the Chriſtianes alſo. Why dooth not my lord Mark theſe wordes Act. 2. Erāt perſeuerātes in doctrina Apoſtolorū & cōmunicatione & fractione panis & precatio nibus. Why doothe they not ſtudy to reſtore the doctrine of the Apoſtoles into the churche agayne and let this adulterous tradicions of men paſſe. That churche was aſſurid of Chriſt by his word. And this churche that men defend hathe caſt out godes worde and the Apoſteles alſo. Then my lord ſaythe by thauctorite of Gregorie Nazianzene that it is not neceſſary to obſerue all thinges in the fupper as Chriſt did. I graunt the ſame or elſe we ſhuld haue our fet wayſhid as the Apoſteles had. But let mi lord proue that we ſhuld not uſe the ſupper as à cōmunion diſtributid unto thole church under bothe kyndes. And thē hathe my lord donne ſomwhat Then by the auctory of the prophete Malachie ca. 1. my lord would ſtablyſhe the Maſſe and proue it to be à ſacrifice.

The prophetes mynd was that all the ceremonies of the law ſhuld haue an end when Meſſias came, and that all the Chriſtianes ſhuld offer Mucktar unto god, thymiama uel incenſum. Now this word mucktar ſignifieth alſo prayer Pſal. 141. adapteiur oratio me uelut incenſum ante conſpectum tuum. And the prayer of the Chriſtianes is this oblacion ſpoken of by the prophet. And not the maſſe. Nor the word that ffolowithe Minhah helpith the maſſe nothing at all. Which ſignifiet farinaceā oblationem ſiue molam. And his taken Pſalm. 141. for the euening

Nam circumſcriptio loci ad ſacra obeunda dele ta eſt, Omnis locus accommodatus ad dei cultum eſt exiſtimatus, et uictimarum ratione carentium caedes, immaculatus agnus & tanquam ſignum uirtutis odoratum incenſum exiſtit. Iudaei autem iuxta Malachiae praedictionem, reiecti ſunt. Ideo nomen meū, inquit, magnum inter gentes. The prophet neuer ment nor none other lernid man that knowith the tonges, to bring à Iewiſhe ceremonie into the churche of the gentiles. And to incloſe Chriſt in this Mealy ſacrifice of the aulter. Rede the 12. chapiter of Paule to the Ro. and ſe what ſacrifice is requirid of the Chriſtiane. My lord hathe the ſound of one word more of the Ebrew Miſſah. And would that the ſacrifice in the law callid Miſſah, ſhuld be à figure and type of this popiſhe maſſe facies ſolemnitatē ebdomadarum domino deo tuo, cum leuacione uoluntaria manus tuae, quam dabis, ſecundum quod benedixerit te dominus deus tuus. Deut. 16. god commaundid in the end of haruiſt to celebrat this ſolenne ffeſt and to offer unto the lord part of euery grayne that came of the erthe not only becauſe they ſhuld yeue hym thankes ffor the preſeruacion of the people ffrom hungre and faymi ne but alſo to acknolege hym to yeue all thinges only and not to attribut the plentiouſe and aboundant harueſt unto ffortune as the Epicures doothe. And likewyce to confeſſe that his grace and ffauor makithe ryche, and his diſpleaſure poure and not to attribut the gifftes they receauid unto the ſecond cauſes as the Stoykes doothe that ſay god is bound to do as the ſecond cauſe

is diſpoſid, it is not ſo for he can make ſkarſite and nede of corne where as is good fertill ground, and aboundance, in the baryn feles, and Now if, an oten or barley ſhefe that was offrid for the purpoſe that I haue ſhewid figurid the maſſe let the Chriſtiane reader iudge, I meruell my lord is ſo ffull of Alligories and ſpeakythe nothing of the text whē an allegorie ꝓuithe nothing. But is uſid to declare the thing that we would proue. Let him ffirſt proue his propoſicion by, the ſcripture. And then I will admit the figuratiue loquucion as truithe ſhall forſe me my lord in the end of his booke ſpeakyth of them that ſtudy to impung this ſtablyſhyd uerety as he callyth it of the churche the miniſtracion of the ſacrament under one kynde and then ſaythe they ar not only in that hyghe mater of the ſacrament. But alſo in ceremonys and namely ſouche as garnyſhe Chriſtes religion wherin he ſaythe the deuyll uſythe A meruelouſe poynt of Sophiſtrye by deuiſion, and examyning partes alone whyche partes ſo conſyderyd ſeuer allye be nothyng, and yet ioynyd to gather be ſom what &c. My lord wyll open this poynt of Sophiſtrye he ſaythe, whiche conſyſtethe in diuiſion betwene the hole and the part. And puttithe this example if one were aſkyd whether à farthyng would make à ryſhe man? A ſimple man would ſay: nay &c. Then makythe he his ſimile: like wyſſe in the diſcuſſion of ceremonyes, ſemelynys, and oders, the deuyll fframythe his quaeſtions by deuyſyon and aſkythe of eche thyng alone. as for example whether à ſhauen crowne makythe à pryſt: then anſwer is made nay. doothe a long gowne make à pryſtnay and ſo fforthe as my lord tellythe

his tale. My lord hathe well openyd a poynt of Sophiſtrye doutles as he that ment nothing elſe but to ſet à whicche candell before the Iyes of the ſimple that they ſhuld not ſee the truithe. And would carie them by ſophiſtrye whether he lyſtythe. He that will argue of à ſimilitude muſt put all wayes too thinges alyk that the one may open the other. Now my lord makith à cōparicion of too thinges unlike as the qualites of gall ſhuld, in ſwetnis be comparid unto the qualites of hony. Euery man knowithe that this is trew in tweny pound neceſſaryly to be conteynid twenty nobles. Twenty grotes, twenty pence, twenty halfpence, and twenty farthinges, and not poſſible to haue the greater ſomme without the laſſe. Is the like in the dignite of à byſhope or priſt ſuppoſe ye, that who ſo euer was or is à godd pryſt muſt haue neceſſayly that ſhauen crowne, and long gowne. I report me to the ſcripture they benethere neceſſary nor cōmēdable ſignes to know à priſt by. As thow hnowiſt the leſt nombre to be cōprehēdyd in the more. So be theſe uertewes comprehendid in à trew byſhope and not à crowne. Maritus unius uxoris uigilancia ſobrietas modeſtia, temperātia. Hoſpitalitas &c. 1. Tim. 3. Tit. 1. What deuil hathe mad à crowne, à long gowne or à typpid to be à thing neceſſary for à biſhope Reſtore it to Rome agayne ffrō whēs it came. and deuide the hole into his partes by the ſcripture. My lord ſpeakithe of Ioan ffrith and others: and ſaith they made the ſacramentes actes indifferēt to be uſid and not to be uſid, as it pleaſith man. Iwould to our lord my lord of wyncheſter ſpake, nether, wrote more ungodly of the ſacramentes then

theye. There was à ſort of herytikes callyd Enthuſiaſta

                that were of that yle opinion but not Tyndall, ffryth. nor none other that wrytithe or hathe wroten in our dayes. Except the ungodly Anabaptiſtes. And asfor that my lord ſaythe Bucer, Luther, and mani other with the hole churche of truithe, Be agaynſt ſouche as would haue no corporall preſenſe of Chriſtes body in the ſacrament. The churche of trewth is with them and the word of god as euery man may ſe and rede in there workes. And that thoſe great lernid men be agaynſt them and the trewth, in this mater it is an Argument that faythe is the ſole yefft of god and commithe not into the ſolle of man becauſe he is lernid. But becauſe his name is wroten in the boke of lyffe and preſeruid by grace that he honor not the beſt that blaſphemithe the lyuing god Apoc. 13. god ſhall opē boothe there yyes, ad my lordes alſo to ſee the truythe whē it ſhalbe his bleſſyd pleaſure for the whiche eueri man is boūd to pray, that knowithe the truythe in this mater and not to booſt ner bragg his knolege but to remembre he ſtondith only by the mercy of God, and ffaythe, let hym beware he fall not, according to the commaundement of Paule Rom. 11. he that is perſuadyd in his conſcience by the word of god, that he knowithe god and his Sacramentes I exhort hym in Chryſt to ffolow and obey the word of god and lyue there after that the word be not ſlaunderyd by his ungodly lieffe and beware he fall not ffrom one yle into awarſe yle ffrom à papyſt to be à libertyne, but as he incre ſithe in knolege, ſo to increſſe in godly and uerteues lieffe.
