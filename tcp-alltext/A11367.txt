                  The preface of Alexander Barclay preest / vnto the right hye and mighty prince: Thomas duke of Northfolke.
                  
                     
                  
                  
                     RIght myghty hye / & magnificent prince: myne humble seruyce / due vnto your grace. And the vehemēt affection whiche I haue vnto your honour & perpetual fame / impelleth me often tymes to deuyse / and reuolue in mynde: what seruice or pleasur my simplenesse might do / cōuenient and acceptable vnto your hyghnesse: therby to testify the honour / the loue / & obsequy: whiche I knowlege my selfe to owe vnto your magnificēce. But whan I cōsyder

and compare my symplenesse and impotence with your preeminēt dignite: I fynde myselfe gretly insufficiēt to parforme or attempt any besynesse or warke which I may condynglie present vnto your honorable presēce. Neuertheles after many cōsyderaciōs: the gracious regarde of benynge grauite which I beholde in your coūtenance: and the euident signes of humilite whiche outwardly apereth radica

                     e in your noble hert: reconforteth myne insufficience & inboldeth my spirites / some thyng to write my custome whiche I may present into your gracious handes: as a perpetual memorial: an and euident testimony of my deuout seruice / & amorous affection against your magnificent hyghnes. In this consyderacion I haue reuolued many & diuerse volumes / studyeng of which one: the trāslacion: might correspond with your noble estat. But at last I haue remēbred that a mercyal matter is most cōgruent vnto a marcial & victorious prince. Wherfore I haue attempted to translate into our maternal langage the auncient cronicle & famous hystorie of the warre: and dyuers batayls which the romayns dyd agaynst the tyran Iugurth: vsurper of the kyngdome of Numidy. Whiche hystorie is writen in latyn by the ronowmed romayne Salust: whose wordes in latyn I haue also added vnto the marge of this my trāslacion to thintent that such as shal dysdayne to rede my translation in englysshe: may rede this hystorie more cō
                     pendyously & more obscurely writen in laten. Which hystorie: parauenture shal apere more clere & playne vnto theym in many places by help of this my trāslation. Which shal nat be tedyous to such as be lerned & vndestande latyn: but vnto many noble gentylmen whiche vnderstande nat latyn tong ꝑfetly I dout nat but that this my labour shalbe both pleasure & profet. For by the same they shal haue some help toward the vnderstādyng of latyn: whiche at this tyme is almost contēned of gentylmen. And also they shal vnderstande a ryght fruytful hystorie: bothe pleasant / profitable / &

ryght necessary vnto euery degre: but specially to gentylmen / whiche coueyt to attayne to clere fame and honour: by glorious dedes of chyualry. But I dout nat: but that some calumnyous detractours shal maligne agaynst this my besynes and ꝓfitable labour / sayeng that to a preest and man ꝓfessed to obseruāce of religion: it is farre cōtrary & dysagreynge to intermyt hymselfe with warfare: or to intermyt with thyngꝭ of batayle: outher by dedes / counsel / or writynge. But to stoppe the mouthes of such calumniatours: moost souerayne prince: mesemeth ryght & cōuenient in this place: somwhat to write aswel cōcernyng the cōmodities & laudes of hystories: as apertenent vnto myne owne excusacion. And first I knowlege it moch more cōueniēt: a preest to arme hymselfe with constance / holy scripture / purenesse of lyfe / & radyant vertues: and with suche socours & armour defended: boldely / & valiātly / to byd batayle agaynst vyc

And to cōtende also agaynst the temptaciōs of his carnal cōcupiscēces / agaynst these mundayne blandimētes & delectacions: and agaynst his gostely ennemies suggestyōs. For vnder this maner (as affermeth the holy man Iob) mannes lyfe vpon yerth is but a warfare / & a very mase of miseries: an in

                     ricate circuite of vary able / and ineuitable errours. For certayne I deny nat: but that such ought to be the warfare of a man within holy orders: auowed & submyt vnto ye holy minysteries & auters of god. But this other temperal warre is permytted vnto wordely lyuers: and may nat be omytted: namely in this worlde oppressed with tyrāny of iniuryous and odyous exactors and oppressours: whose obstinate presumpcions / assautes / & inuasions can nat otherwyse be repressed: than by violence / armour / & batayle: vnder ministracion of good and ryghtwyse princes defenders & mayntayners of the commen wele. Than it is lauful: a preest to write suche actes for example of our posterite: for perpetual remembraūce of the laudes of good

princes / which haue ben here in erth the scourges of god to correct tyrannes & synners. But great is the laude & many be the cōmodities & vtilities of hystories. An hystore is the recorder of tymes passed: the lyght of verite: the maistres of mannes lyueng: the presydent of memorie: the messanger of antiquite. And (as Titus Liuius recordeth in his prologue) the knowledge of hystories among other thinges is most holsome / necessary / and ꝓfitable. For euery good example which in them is writen: is set for a warnyng & monycion vnto princes and gouernours therby to rule & order themselfe: & a cōmen wele. And euery exāple of miserable fortune of tyrannes / is set as a monicion for the same gouernours nat to be of tyrannous behauour / lest at last they may fal īto lyke miserable ruyne & calamite. And also (as sayth Cicero) a man to knowe nothing of that which was done before his tyme & remēbrance: that is as who sayth alway to be a chylde. But it is a thyng very comely: & necessary before other: to knowe these cronycles & noble actes of aunciēt tyme & remēbrance to kepe in mynde the order & courses of antiquite: and to haue in mynd the knowledge of exemples for euery mater & purpose. For in likewyse as vnto aged men is more credence & auctorite gyuen / than to yong men: bycause of experiēce of many thyngꝭ. So such noble & diligēt myndꝭ as delyteth in redynge hystories: may haue knowlege nat onely of the dedes of one mannes lyfe: but also of the dedes most famous of al tymes syth creation of the world. Wherfor (as sayth Dyodorus) it is a comely & fayre thyng / moche necessary & cōmendable: a man to refourme & amende his lyfe / by example of an other mannes fautꝭ & dāmages. Wherfore Demetrius Phalerus the great philosopher: often warned & counselled the kyng Ptolomy to excercise hymselfe in often redyng of bokes of hystories. For in so doynge: princes shall fynde writen in bokes before their eyen ryght many thyngꝭ cōcernyng their wele / honour / & fame: which their frendꝭ dare nat be bolde to

tell them for drede of dysplesure: fathermore without the knowlege of hystories neuer man coude become good oratour. For (as affermeth Quintilian) hystories be of such myght and effect that they may norisshe the speche of an oratour withsoft and swete lycour. These premisses with otherlyke consydered: moost magnificent prince: me thinketh it thing nat inconuenient a preest to write of hystories of warre: and also me thynke both plesant & profitable to noble men to exercyse themselfe in redyng the same. For brefely to speke by ryghtwysie batel: the lawes of god & man be mentayned: vice & vicious men corrected: vertue / and good men rewarded and exalted. Oure fayth agaynst infideles defended: rebellers & tyrannes subdued: and finally all thyngꝭ directed & to due order reduced. Fathermore the same redyng of hystores semeth to auayle nat a lytel to the knowledge & cōtempt of this transytorie pleasure mundayne & mysery of this vncertayne lyfe. For whan hystories represēt before our syght the valyant and bolde herted knyghtes shyning in armour: & richely aparelled: on comely coursers

But agayn anon after: whan we rede & se in the same hystories the valiaūt mennes bodyes prostrate: the carkases of kynges / dukes / erles / knyghtes / and pages mengled all togyder: all pride & contencion abated.

And trāslated into englysshe by Alexander Barcley preest / at cōmaundement of the ryght hygh & myghty prince Thomas duke of Northfolke.
                     
                        IN this present cronycle or hystory of Rome: is written the batayle / whiche the Romayns had with Iugurth / vsurper of the kyngdome of Numydy. The lande of Numydy is parte of the countrey of Affryke. In whiche raygned somtyme a kynge named Massinissa: felowe and frende to the empyre of Rhome. This Massinissa had thre sonnes thus named: Micipsa / Manastabal / and Galussa. But after the deth of Manastabal and Galussa: the first brother named Micipsa / obtayned the kyngdome of Numydy alone / without partyner. For after the custome of Numydy / heritages are wont to be deuided among brethern by equal porcions / after dyscease of theyr parentes / of whome suche heritage issueth. This Micipsa so crowned kynge of hole Numydy had two sonnes / the first called Adherbal / the seconde Hiempsall. But his brother Manastabal whiche was departed before / left behynde hym one bastarde sonne named Iugurth: to whom his grandfather Massinissa bequethed none heritage / but left hym priuate without lande or lyuelodde / for asmoche as he was vnlaufully borne. The kynge Micipsa was moued with pyte & compassyon agaynst this Iugurth: and cōsideryng that he was his brothers sonne / & without conforte / receyued hym into his house / and cherisshed hym in all thynges / as he dyde his owne sonnes. This Iugurth as he grewe in stature / so grewe he in all gyftes belongynge to nature / and became a right strong & hardy knyght / and also more excellent in wysdome / than in courage or myght / and was moche elder than the two sonnes of Micispa: named Adher ball & Hiempsall. What tyme Micipsa cōsydered the 
                           ••
                        ouryng age manlynes / & wysdome of Iugurth. And on the other parte / whan he remēbred the feble yongth & vnexpert of his owne two sonnes in this aduisemēt his mynde was sore troubled wt drede: 
                           •
                        est after his dethe / the same Iugurth myght inuade and vsurpe vnto hymselfe the kyngdome of Numydy his owne two sonnes

beyng nat of power to defende thēselfe. Micipsa after these thynges cōsydred: determined to obiect this Iugurth vnto paryll of warre / and by such meanes to assay if it might fortune hym to be slayne in batell. Therfore what tyme ye romains hauyng Scipio for their capitaine / beseged the cyte of Numance: this Micipsa sent vnto the romains to ye same batayle great socours both of horsmen and of fotemen. And made Iugurthe captayn ouer them. This dyde he trustynge that it was possible and lykely ynough that this Iugurth a knyght yonge / lusty / and desirous of honour / myght by some chaūce of fortune be slayne in batayle / as I sayd before. But at conclusion it fortuned moche contrary. For the boldnesse and strength of Iugurthe in that warre was well proued and knowen. For many noble and valiant actes of chyualry dyd he: wherby he wanne moche laude and glory / with great loue & fauour / nat onely of Scipio the captaine / but also of all the noblest men of the Romayne army. Insomoche that after this warre was fynisshed: and the cyte of Numance distroyed the captaine Scipio assembled his hole army: and before them all with magnificent and fauorable wordes cōmended Iugurth with merueylous laudes. This done he rewarded hym with many & riche gyftes of chyualry. And sent hym agayne to the kynge Micipsa with letters / wherin also he commended this Iugurth with great laude and praysyng. By instigacion of whiche thynges it so befell: that where as the kyng Micipsa / nat long before desyred nothyng more than ye deth of Iugurth: nowe he coueted nought somoche as conseruacion of his lyfe & helth. So that nat long after he adopted hym as his sonne / and ordayned in his testamēt hym to be one of his heyres & partiner of his kyngdome with his two other naturall sonnes. Whiche ordinaūce he neuer chaunged / but at his departyng increased his fauour and benefites agaynst ye same Iugurth / leauynge hym nat onely partiner of his kyngdome / but also of all his treasours. And besyde this decryed hym to be protectour of his two naturall sonnes / and of theyr porcions of the kyngdome. Sone after this ordinaūce the kyng Micipsa departed frō lyfe. But whan ye thre princes Adherball / Hiempsall / and Iugurth determined amonge them the tyme whan the treasoure shulde be deuided and the boundes of the kyngdome lymited to them eche one his parte. At this assemble grewe a dissencion betwene Hiempsall & Iugurth / by occasyon wherof Iugurth shortely after slewe Hiempsall by treason and gyle. After this Hiempsall was slayne Iugurthe fixed his mynde to possesse the hole kyngdome of Numidy. Wherfore he

prepared a great & strong army agaynst the other brother Adherball / and at last whan bothe mette in batayle the army of Adherball was ouerthrowen / and hymselfe put to flyght. Adherball thus ouercome and spoyled of his kyngdome fledd vnto Rome / and there before the senatours declared the tyrannous cruelte of Iugurth agaynst hym cōmitted / and agaynst his brother Hiempsall cruelly murdred: desiryng socours of the same senatours / wt pytefull wordes and lamentable complayntes. At conclusion it was decreed of the senatours / that .x. noble men of Rome shulde be sent embassadours to Numydy / to deuyde the kyngdome betwene Adherball and Iugurth indifferētly. The same embassadours hasted them to Numydy / and dyde the cōmaundement of the senate to them inioyned: but more to the fauour of Iugurth / than Adherball. Whan the kyngdome was departed and deuided / and the sayd embassadours were also departed from Affr
                           •
                        ke towarde Rome: Iugurth sette his mynde yet ones agayn to inuade and vsurpe the part of ye kyngdome which belonged to Ad / herball / by assignemēt of the embassadours. Wherfore he assembled a newe army / and with the same īnuaded his kyngdome: Adherball compelled by necessite assembled also an other army for his part / and proceded forthe and mette with Iugurth. But anone after they ioyned batayle / Iugurth ouerthrewe the hoost of Adherball & put hym to 
                           ••
                        yght / cōstrainyng hym to fle with a fewe horsmen about hym into a walled towne nere by / named Cyrtha. Iugurth anone beseged the towne on all partes. In the meane tyme Adherball by letters certified ye senatours of Rome in what state Iugurth had brought hym. How he was bereft of his kyngdome by crueltie & ambicion of Iugurthe: how he was brought to extremite by hunger and force of armes / nat able to abyde the besegynge any lenger: how it appered euidently that Iugurth set lytell by the decrees & ordinaunce of the senatours / And at conclusion of the same letters he humbly besought the senate of ayde and socours in this his extremite. Whan these letters were redde before the senatours assembled: many of them were: which iuged it thynge expedient and conuenient: to socour Adherball. And anone to sende an army into Affrike agaynst Iugurthe. But his frendes whome he hadde bought for money at Rome: made suche resistence that no suche ordinaunce coude come to effect / nor passe forthe agaynst hym. Neuerthelesse newe embassadours were sent ones agayne to Iugurth / and that men auncient and of great authorite: to compell and cōmaunde hym in name of the senatours to desyst from his entreprise and crueltie

in payne of theyr hye displeasure. Iugurth blynded these imbassadours with fayre wordes and rewardes / tyll they were departed agayn from Numidy to Rome / wtout any thing brought to ende. Whan this was knowen at Cirtha 
                           •
                         where Adherball lay beseged: they whiche were with Adherball within the towne counselled hym to yelde vp the towne to Iugurth / vpon cōdicion onely to haue his lyfe pardoned vnto hym. Adherball constrained by famine and other necessities condiscended to this counsell. But anone after the towne was yelded / Iugurth cōtrary to his fayth & promes which he had made to Adherbal: slewe hym with greuous & horrible tourmēt. Whan this dede was knowen at Rome: the senatours were sore moued agaynst hym. And toke his demeanoure and dedes inhumayne greuously. Wherfore by commen assent of the senatours and commens of Rome: one named Licius Calphurnius that tyme consull of Rome / was sent with a strong army into Numidy agaynst Iugurth. But with in shorte season this Calphurnius corrupted and accloyed with money by Iugurth made a foule bonde of peace wt hym to great dishonoure and shame bothe of hymselfe 
                           •
                         and of all the empire of Rome: for which dede the senatours and commens of Rome were greuously displeased. Wherfore Calphurnius was called home agayne to Rome with great dishonoure and rebuke. After this Calphurnius / an other romayn named Albinus was elect consull and dyrect with newe supplemēt of warriours into Numidy agaynst Iugurth. But this Iugurth droue hym forth vnder hope and coloure as if he wolde yelde hymselfe to the sayd Al
                           •
                        inus: so longe tyll at last the tyme approched of election of newe consuls. Wherfore Albinus of necessite constrayned: and as decrees of the romayns commaunded: retourned agayne to Rome to be at the sayd election (as he was bounde) without any dede laudably done in Numidy. And at his departinge left behynde hym in Numidy his brother named Aulus: to be captayn in his stede / & ruler of his army / and also of the prouince where the same army soiourned tyll the wynter were ouer passed. What tyme Albinus was departed towarde Rome: this Aulus blynded by rasshenes and foly / behaued hymselfe ryght vndiscretly in his rowme. In somoche that he called the army vnto viage / and warfare forth of theyr tentes in the moneth of Ianuary: in coldest and sharpest season of wynter This dyde he: other bycause he trusted to ende the batayle in his tyme: and so therby to wynne thanke and worshyppe: or els to thentēt to gete money of Iugurh by graūtyng vnto hym peace & rest for his tyme. And

so to cōstrayne hym to bye his peace. Whan Iugurth perceyued this vnexpertnes and rasshe foly of Aulus: he sent vnto hym embassadours as if he were a ferde: by dissimulacion to requyre of hym peace. And in the meane tyme the same Iugurth ledde his army among hylles & wodes fainyng as if he fledde from Aulus for drede. Aulus vnderstādyng this / persued & folowed hym more egarly & hastely / without aduisment / ord
                           •
                        r / or ꝓuision. Whan Iugurth sawe that he had attised & drawen the Romains into a place to fyght for his auauntage: anone he assayled them & embatayled with them fyersly / in which batayle he ouercame the romains & putte them to flyght. On the next morne after / Iugurth and Aulus came togyder in communicacion. And at last trewes was stryken bytwene bothe parties / in this maner & by such cō
                        dicions: that all the romains shuld passe vnder a spere in signe of subieccion / and that they were ouercome without more hurt. And afterwarde within ten dayes all shulde depart out of Numidy / & so was it done. Whan tydyngꝭ herof were brought to rome: all the citie was troubled with drede & displeasure. After this shamefull trewes of Aulus and disconfiture & flyght of the romayne army / a noble man named Metellus was creat consul of Rome / & by cōmen assent sende vnto Numidi agaynst Iugurth. This Metellus behaued hymselfe as a noble captaine and valiaunt warriour: and perceyuynge that the residue of the army which was escaped / was disolute and out of order / by ouer moch libertie. And by faute of the captains / which were before / he first of all reduced the sowdiours to good rule and order / acordynge to the auncient ordinaunces of chyualry: and than in tyme conueniēt after his army was brought to order / he assailed Iugurth fyersly. And after certayne sharpe and greuous batayles / he diminished his riches / his myght & power & brought hym almost to extremite. After this Metellus: one named Marius last of all was creat consul / and the prouince & warre of Numidy decreed and cōmitted to hym. This Marius anone pursued Iugurthe in batayle moost sharply & fiersly of all other / insomoche / that finally he vtterly brought hym to extremite: his frendes / his riches and power / brought all to nought. And at conclusion by treason / & betrayeng of one Bocchus / kyng of the Mauriens: Iugurthe was deliuerd to the same Marius as prisoner: whome he ledde bounde to Rome with great glory & triumphe. At last this Iugurth was throwen into prison / where at conclusion he ended his miserable lyfe / in dolors & captiuite. This is the argument and processe of all this hystory and cronicle: in whiche the redar / of

whatso euer condicion and degre he be: shall fynde both profite and pleasure: if he redde it attentyfly and with good aduertens. And moost namely gentylmen apt to attayne to glorious fame & honour by fayt of chyualry: shall fynde both pleasaunt and profitable pastime / in redyng this hystory: vnto whose example / profite / and pleasure I chefely haue translated the same.
                  
                  
                     ¶The prologue of this present cronycle compyled in laten by the famous romayn Salust: and trāslated into englysshe by Alexander Barcley preest.
                     
                        MAnkynde wrongfully complayneth of his naturall dysposicion: sayeng / that his feble & frayle lyfe of short cōtinuaunce of tyme / is rather ruled by chaūces of fortune: than by ꝓuision of strength or vertu. But if man wel cōsyder his natural īclinacion: cōtrary to such opinion: he shall fynde that nothyng longynge to mankynde / may be founde & proued greater / better / or more preeminēt than his naturall inclinacion: and yt his owne diligēce & exercyse / rather fayleth hym / than outher myght or longe continuaūce of lyfe tyme. But in this opinion to iuge indifferētly: let man vnderstande that the mynde is ordayned / gyder / ruler & captayne of mānes lyfe: which mynde: whan it valyantly intēdeth to attayne / to worshyp & dignite / by way of vertu: it is excellent ynough myghty and clere of it selfe: so that it nedeth nat to force of fortune / nor to care for her vncertayne gyftes: but to dyspise her as nat able to gyue to any man honesty / diligence or other good and vertuous exercises: nor able to depriue man agayne of the same gyftes: after he hath obtayned ye same. But on the other part if this mynde of mā / taken & blynded wt frowarde pleasurs be subdued vnto slouthe & bodyly lustes: after it hath exercised & occupied such ieoꝑdous pleasure by a lytel season: & after that by cowardous slouth / both the strength / the tyme & the wyt ar vanisshed away & decayed: than anone the infirmite & fel

                        ylnes of nature is accused & put in blame. And thus / all such slouthfull doers trāspose & lay away the faute which in themself is culpable / vnto the difficulte of such besynesses / as they haue omitted by negligē
                        ce. But if it were so: that men had as great cure & affeccion of thyngꝭ good and profitable / as they haue desyre & pleasure in sekyng & folowyng thyngꝭ cōtrary vnto them & nothyng ꝓfitable

ye: & also moch ꝑylous & hurtfull: than shuld nat they be more ruled by ye chaūces of fortune / than they shuld rule ye sayd chaūces. And thus shulde they attayne & procede vnto so great excellence: that where they be mortall of nature they shuld be made īmortall by glory & renowmed fame. For in lykewyse as man is cōposed & made of .ii. thyngꝭ (that is to say of the body & soule) right so all thyngꝭ / all besynesses & exercises / to mankynd belongyng / foloweth / some ye nature of the body: to decay brefely & to be mortall: as it is / some other folowe ye nature of the soule / to be eternall & īmortall: as it is. Which thing forther to ꝓue by exāple: we dayly se that ye goodly beauty of ye visage & shape of mākynde / great abondaūce of riches / & also the strength of the body / with all other suche thynges & semblable / decayeth & vanyssheth away within short tyme. But cōtrarely ye excellent & worthy actes: belongyng to mānes wyt: be īmortall & euerlastyng: as the soule is īmortall. And finally in lykwyse as ye begynnyng of ye gyftes corꝑall or naturall / & of the gyftes of fortune is caduke / vayne & vncertayn: ryght so is the ende of ye same mutable & trāsitory. And all thyngꝭ which be borne and sprygyng: agayne decayeth & approcheth to deth: and whan these same be growen & encreased to the hegth of theyr perfeccion: agayne they begyne to decay and consume by age and debilite. But the mynde and soule beynge incorrupt / eternall and gouernoure of mankynde / ruleth and weldeth all thynges: but it selfe can nat be violently ruled nor compelled by any thyng erthly / cōsyderyng the frewyll / whiche it optayneth of his creatour. For which consyderacion the frowarde iniquite of them is more to be marueyled: which subdued to the ioyes & pleasures of the body / passe forthe the tyme of theyr lyfe / in carnall lustes and ydelnes. But towchyng theyr wyt (whiche is the best gyft and grettest treasure graūted to mankynde) that suffre they to slomber and to slepe without exercise / in slouthe and ydelnes: whose dulnes surely is somoche more to be blamed: namely syth so many and diuers noble exercises & occupacions of the mynde be: by whom moost clere nobles and fame vndefyled may be optayned. But of suche diuers exercises concernynge the mynde some are better refused: than procured in troublous tymes & inquiet. And namely in this tyme turbulent and season vnquiet: great offices / lordshyppes / rowmes to commaunde & rule: and brefely to speke. All maner cure cōcernyng the administracion of thynges apparteynyng to the commen wele: semeth vnto me nat at all to be couyted or desyred of any wyse man.

For certenly a man to rule his countrey & kynred by myght & violence: all if he haue power so to do / & also though he ryght wysly correct ye crimes of trāsgressours & misdoers. Neuertheles: so to do it is vnbehouefull & vnexpedient. And often at cōclusion more perilous & daūgerous: than it is sure or ꝓfitable / & that namely / syth all mutacions of thynges / and chaunges of gouernours pretende and thretten slaughter / of some exile or wylfull flyght / imprisonmēt with otherlyke cruelties more longyng to ennemyes of a cōmen wele / than to defēders of the same. Than forthermore: a man to labour to ye vttermost of his power / and all in vayne. And in weryenge hymselfe to gete nought els but euylwyll and hatred: it is a point of extreme & vtter madnes / except perchaūce it be such one / whiche hath a dishonest / a foule & perilous pleasure to cast away for nought his owne worshyppe and libertie for pleasure of a fewe myghty men vsurpers of dominion & lordshyp. But among all other besinesse / which are exercised by mānes wyt / the redyng of hystories & the reducyng of the same to memory: is moch more necessary & ꝓfitable to all degrees beryng rule of a cōmen wele / but most namely vnto prīces. Of power / profet / & cōmodite wherof: I purpose at this tyme to passe ouer wt silence / bycause many other authours haue wryten of the same before my tyme. And also that no man shulde suppose my selfe by pride or insolēce: to bost myne owne study vainly laudyng ye same. But moch cōtrary I beleue rather yt some enuious maligners shalbe herafter which shall obiect & ascribe a name of slouth and negligēce to this my labour. How great & profitable so euer it be: & that bycause I haue determined to lede my lyfe solitarely: ferre from medlyng with the cōmen wele. Certainly (as I suppose) they onely shall impute and ascribe suche name to me and to this my laboure: whiche thynketh it a moost great & singular craft or practised wysdome to wynne beniuolence / by salutyng the cōmen people / and by dyssimulate reuerence done to euery man passyng by them / or els to gete fauour by festyng and flateryng the commenty. Whiche enuious maligners: yf they wolde cōsider bothe in what maner seasons and in what ieopardous tymes I haue obtayned offices and rowmes of auctorite & what men wold gladly / and yet myght nat obtayne suche rowmes Moreouer yf they call to mynde what maner of men afterwarde came into the order of senatours For certayne if my wyllers

consider inedifferētly these premisses: than shall they thinke that I haue chaunged the purpose of my mynde: more for cause reasonable: and by good aduisemēt / than for slouth & cowardise / and they shall fynde / that more profet shall come to the commen wale by this my study (which they count but ydelnes and tyme misspent) than of the labour and besynes whiche other men take vpon them fayntly and iniustly administryng the commen wele. And they shall fynde that my writing shal proue itselfe more laudable and profitable to the cōmente / than theyr vndiscrete gouernaunce. For often haue I herde of the famous princes Quintus Maximus / & Publius Scipio / and besyde these of many other ryght famous and worthy men of the citie of Rome / which whan they behelde the ymages of theyr forefathers made of stone / of waxe / or of metall / and erect into hye trones in memoriall of the valiaunt and magnificent actes by them done for the commen wele: the sayd princes in aduisynge such ymages were wont to say vnto suche as stode nere by them: that theyr myndes were gretly kyndeled to vertue and nobles in cōtemplyng of the same. The case is playne: yt suche figures of metall / stone / or waxe had nat such operacion nor myght within themselfe. But such hygh courage & flame was kyndeled and increased in the hardy hertes of such noble men and valiant warrious / by remembraūce of the glorious dedes of theyr forfathers in theyr lyfe tyme / done & represēted to their memory by such ymages / insomoche that this flame kyndled in theyr hertes to vertu coude neuer be slaked nor saciate in them / tyll tyme that they were equall with their forefathers in vertu / fame / and glory. Than how moch more ought the clere descripcion of hystores to kyndell vnto boldnes and vertu / the myndes of noble men by redyng of the same. But moche contrary / if we aduert the worlde as it is now among all men which lyue / and conforme themselfe to the maners vsed nowe adayes / where shall we fynde one: but that wyll striue and contende with theyr forefathers to ouercome them / other in couetise & superfluous riches / or els in prodigalite & wastfull expences / and nat in honest and laudable lyfe / good excercices and diligence? And moreouer gentylmen of ye first heed / which were wont to preuent auncient noblemen & ascende vnto vertu & nobles / by vertuous maners: such laboure now to lordshyp / honour and authorite / by fraude & falshode: rather than by very vertu or good meanes & laudable. After suche maner as if the office of a hye Iuge / of a Tresourer / a Cōsull / a Prouost / and all such other great offices / were noble and excellēt of themselfe. And nat in maner as if suche

offices shulde be counted of worthynes and dignite: after as the vertue and honour is / of suche as rule in the same offices and hy rowmes. But playnly affirmyng the treuth: the man maketh the office noble & worshypfull: yf his maners shyne by vertue. But yf his conuersacion be contrary / no office / no rowme / can make hym noble nor worshypfull. But this omittynge I haue proceded in this prologue with ouer ferre circūstaunce / and also with somwhat to moche libertie of wordes / more than in a preface is requisite: for that it pyteeth me of these tedious maners of this oure cite of Rome. But nowe wyll I come to my mater purposed / and first interpryse begon.

Many causes moueth me by writynge to commende this warre to perpetual memory. First for that in the same was foughten at many tymes with great multitude of men on eyther partie / with moche cruell murdre and variable victory: the Romains somtyme / somtyme the Iugurthins preuaylyng in victory. Forthermore bycause that first at this batayle: & from thens forwarde the commen people of Rome matched with the princes / resistynge theyr pride. For where as before this tyme the noble men of Rome oppressed and subdued the commens with vnreasonable rigoure / the commens elect one named Marius a man of basse byrth to be cōsull of Rome / and captaine in this batayle: whiche after he had obtayned victory ouer Iugurth with great glory / triumphe / & fauour of the commontie / he supported them in such wyse agaynst the noble men: that of the same rose a ciuile bataile & greuous discorde / bytwene the noble men and cō

Insomoch yt finally bytwene these two ꝑties & captayns of ye same was foughten an vnkynde / vnnaturall / & cruel batel: to ye greuous ruine of ye Romayne empire / & subuercion of the cōmen wele. Which cōtencion and

variaunce confounded bothe the lawes of god and man / and by the same were all good ordinaūces disordred. And this same furious debate & foly proceded at last to so vnresonable madnesse and excecate fury / that it neuer desisted / nor this variaunce and discencion bytwene the noble men and commens neuer ceased: tyll tyme that cruell and mortal batayle foughten bytwene both parties / and tyll tyme that also distruction of the lande of Italy cōpelled both parties at last to consyder theyr owne blynde foly & cruell furor: & so finally to mittigate & fynisshe their debate & vnresonable dyssencion.

                     ¶How the kyng Massinissa came into the fauour of the Romayns / and how the lande of Numydy was committed vnto hym. The seconde chapter.
                     
                        THe Romayns had thre notable and famous batayls agaynst the Carthaginēces / in which the same Romayns had great dammage. Howbeit in conclusion of euery batayle they wanne victory of theyr ennemyes: in the seconde of these batayles what tyme Hanyball duke and captayne of the Carthaginēces wasted the welth and riches of Italy more than any other ennemy had euer done before / after the Romayns began̄e to haue any great name and to delate theyr dominion: A famous prince named Massinissa kynge of the lande of Numydy was receyued into frendshyppe & fauour of the Romayns: by one Publius Scipio captayne of the sayd Romayns / which Scipio afterwarde for his manhode was named Scipio Affrycan / bycause he ouercame & subdued the lande of Affrike. This Massinissa so receyued into fauour of the Romayns in the foresayd batayle dyd many noble and famous actes of chyualry / with hygh valiantise & corage. For which dedes: after the Romayns had ouercome ye Carthaginencis & theyr cite: and after they had taken prisoner the kyng Sciphar / which had in Affrike a worthy / great / & large impire the people of Rome gaue frely vnto the same kynge Massinissa / all suche cities & landes as they had taken and wone in batayle. For which benefites so magnificēt & ample Massinissa cōtinued vnto them in profitable & faythfull frendshyp his lyfe induryng:

but at last his lyfe ended / and the welth of his empire decayed also with hym. This kynge departyng left behynde hym thre sonnes: whose names were Micipsa / Manastabal / and Galussa: of whome Micipsa succeded his father / and alone obtayned the kyngdome: after that this other two brethern Manastabal and Galussa / were departed frome this lyfe by sickenesse. This Micipsa had two sonnes named Adherball & Hiempsall. But Manastabal his brother whiche departed (as sayd is) left behynde hym one sonne nat laufully borne / but a bastarde / begoten of his cōcubine: wherfore departyng he left hym orbate without lande or lyuelode. This cōsydering Micipsa suffred hym nat to faute nor decay: but forasmoche as he was his brothers son̄e / receyued hym into his court / & hym cherysshed in lykewyse as he dyd his owne sonnes / Adherball and Hiempsall. This Iugurth after that he was a lytell growen vp to age: was myghty in strength comely / and fayre of face: but moost of all / excellent of wyt & wysdome. Nor he gaue nat hymselfe to be corrupt with lust nor incrafty slouthe: but as is the custome & maner of the people of Numidy hymselfe he exercised / somtyme in rydyng / somtyme in castyng the dart & iustyng / and somtyme in ronnyng & wrestlyng / with his companyons of lyke age. And nat withstandynge / that in laude and prayse he passed all his perys: yet none enuied hym but he was derely beloued / cherysshed / and lauded of all men. Moreouer he passed moche of his tyme in huntyng of wylde bestes whiche in that lande habounded: he was the first / or one among the first which durst assaile and stryke the lyon / and other cruell and wylde bestes: he dyde moche: and lytell sayd or bosted of hymselfe. For suche demeanour his vncle Micipsa at first begynnynge was gladde and ioyefull: supposynge that in tyme to come the manly behauour and strength of Iugurth shuld be glory and honour to all his kyngdome. But afterwarde in processe of tyme whan he cōsydred and vnderstode his lyfe approchynge fast to ende his naturall sonnes yong / & vnexpert. And this yong man Iugurth in honour and fauour dayly encreasyng more and more he reuolued many thynges in mynde greatly moued with suche solicitude and besynesse. Forthermore he consydred / that all men of kynde be naturally inclined to desyre / to rule / and commaunde by lordeshyppe: rather than to be ruled and subiect. And howe man is prone and hedlynge inclined to fulfyll the desyers of his mynde dredynge no daungers: nor suspectynge no peryll / whyle he is e
                           •
                        cecate by ambicion and desyre of lordshyp. Moreouer aduisyng the oportunite of his owne age / and of the

age of his chyldren which for yongh were nat able to resyst any power or violence: whiche oportunite is wont to be nat small confort / audacite and courage / nat onely to bolde herres / but also to meane men and cowardes intendyng to conspyre agaynst theyr princes in hope of pray and promocions. Such consyderacyons feared sore the mynde of Micipsa / besyde these his drede and dolour was more augmented: whan he behelde the fauour & hertes of all his subgettes of the lande of Numidy vtterly inclyned to Iugurth: wherfore to put to deth the same Iugurth by any gyle (as his purpose was to do) he drad moost of all: dowtyng lyst therof myght succede bytwene hym and his subgettes some insurrexion or batayle. Micipsa compased on euery syde with these difficulties / was sore troubled in mynde. And whan he sawe that nother by strength nor gyle he myght distroy a man so well beloued of the commens / (as was Iugurth) at last he deuised an other way to ryd hym: and that without daūger or suspeccion / wherfore Micipsa aduertyng that Iugurth was redy of hande to stryke / auē
                        
                           •
                        erous and moche desyrous of honour and laude of chyualry / he concluded with hymselfe to obiect hym to daunger and peryll of warre: and by that meane to assay the fortune of batayle. ¶Nowe at the same season the Romains warred agaynst a cite of Hispayne named Numance: vnto whiche warre diuers kynges to the commens associate sent vnto them socours agaynst the same cite. Amonge whome Micipsa also sent a fayre company of horsmen and fotemen: ouer whome he made Iugurth captaine: and sent hym forth with them into Hispayne / trustyng that ther he lightly shuld be ouerthrowen and slayne in batayle: other in shewynge his manhod and strength / or els by fyersnes and crueltie of his ennemyes. But this thyng for / tuned moche contrary to his opinion. For Iugurth was of mynde and courage valiaunt and bolde / and of wytte quicke and redy / so that after he had parceyued the disposicion / behauour and maners of Publius Scipio: at that tyme captayne of the romains / and whan he had consydred also the maners of his ennemyes / he behaued hymselfe in suche wyse with moch labour / besynes and cure / in obeyng his captaine with so good maner & often tymes countryng his ennemyes without drede of perill. Insomoch that within short tyme he came to so great fame and worshyppe / that vnto the romains he was marueylous dere and well beloued / and of the Numantines drade as deth: and certaynly / among the chefyst he was worthy and valiaunt in batayle: and also good of counsell / of wysdome pregnaunt and circumspect. Which two thynges be moche harde to be in one man both togyder: for wysdom is often wont to

make men a ferde and to drede many peryls bycause of prouidence. But boldnes and audacite causeth men to be rasshe and folehardy / bycause of haut courage. But his wysdome directed his strength / and his strength was obedient to wysdome. Wherfore Scipio the captaine dyd almost euery ieopardous and wyghty thyng by hand & counsell of Iugurth: hym countyng among his chefe frendes and dayly cherysshed hym more & more and no marueyle / for there was no coūsell / nor interprise begon of Iugurth frustrate or in vayne / but al came to good effect. Besyde these gyftes aboue sayd he was curtes of mynde lyberall / and of wyt ryght discrete & prudent: by which gyftes he adioyned vnto hym many of ye romains in familier frendeshyp. At that same season in the army of Rome were ryght many newe: and also auncient gentylmen / whiche set more by riches than goodnes or honeste. At home in Rome were they sowers of dyscorde and debatfull / great in fame amonge the frendes of the romains. But more famous by worshyppe and rowme / than by honest conuersacion. These kyndled the mynd of Iugurth nat a lytell promisyng often tymes and sayeng to set his courage on fyre: that if the kyng Micipsa discessed the tyme shulde come that Iugurth alone shulde enioye the hole kyngdome of Numidy without any partyner. For in hym (they sayd) was great vertue / great manhode / strength & audacite with wysdome / able to gouerne suche a kyngdome: and nothynge was so iniust and false but that myght be iustifyed at Rome for gold / and all thynges were there to be solde by couetyse of noble men.

Than Publius Scipio concluded to retourne agayne to Rome: and to congye and licence suche socours as were sent vnto hym from other kynges: amonge all other he called Iugurth vnto hym: and before the multitude of all the army assembled / lauded and commended hym magnificently recitynge his glorious actes and manly dedes of chyualry. And after that worthely and rychely rewarded hym for his labours. This done: he conueyed hym into the captains

tent: and there secretly warned hym that he shulde cōtinue and worshyppe the frendshyppe of the people of Rome rather hole togyder and commenly / than priuately leanyng to any singuler rulers. Moreouer addynge these monicions: that he shulde nat rather rewarde and be liberall to a fewe priuatly: than to a hole cōmente / sayeng that it was a perillous thyng to bye that: of a fewe persons: whiche belonge vnto many in commen. If he wolde perseuer and contynue in so noble condicions as he had begon: he shulde shortely come to great honour / glory and dignite royall / more than he wolde desyre. But if he wold procede and labour to ascende ouer hastely / than shuld both he and his riches fall heedlynge to ruyne and decay. After Scipio had sayd these wordes with such lyke: he licensed Iugurth to depart / and sent hym vnto his vncle Micipsa agayne into the lande of Numidy with letters direct vnto the same kyng Micipsa: of whiche letters the tenure and sentence hereafter ensueth: and was suche.

And do your deuoir to the best of your power after his example behauynge yourselfe / so discretely and so wysely that it be nat hereafter reported by me / that I haue takenne vnto me by adoption / better chyldren thanne I haue begotten. Thus concluded the kyng Micipsa his wordes. How beit Iugurth well perceyued the kynges wordes: but fayned and spoken agaynst his hert: if any other remedy myght haue ben foūde: neuertheles he answered benygnely for the tyme / all if he thought and reuoulued in his mynde moche otherwyse / and contrary to his humble and mylde answere.
                  
                  
                     ¶Howe the kynge Micipsa departed from lyfe / and of the first cause of dissencion and discorde betwene Iugurth / Adherball & Hiempsall. ¶The .vii. chapter.
                     
                        NAt longe after the kynge Micipsa decessed whose dethe was dolourous and sore bewayled of all his subgettꝭ: but most of all to his naturall sonnes it was to be lamēted: and nat without great cause as the processe of this hystorie shall afterwarde declare. But after the kyngꝭ funerall exequies were magnificently ended as apertayned to his state royall. The thre princes that is to say Adherball / Hiempsall / and Iugurth anone assembled to the intent to commen and treat of busynesses of the royalme / cōcernynge particion and separation of the same: and all other thynges conuenient. But whan they shulde sytte and take their places in order: Hiempsall yongest of the thre was somwat fyers of nature / and disposed to statelynesse. And in mynde longe before this tyme he disdayned the ignobilite of Iugurth / for asmoche as he was vnlyke vnto them of byrth towchynge his mothers syde / and a bastarde borne: as is sayd before. Wherfore he dysdayned that the same Iugurthe shulde haue the place of moost honoure among them / whiche were naturall sonnes of

a kynge / and also laufully borne: and so in contempt of Iugurth he set hym selfe downe on the ryght hande of his brother Adherball: to thyntent that Iugurthe shulde nat syt in the myddes bytwene them: whiche rowme the Numydyens count of most honour. And afterwarde howbeit his brother Adherbal requyred hym often to gyue place to Iugurth bycause of his age: yet vnnethes coude be with moche payne induce hym therto: but at laste fatygate by requestes of his brother and of other noble men of the realme: he chaunged his place and set hym vpon the other syde with countenaūce declaryng his mynde nat cōtented. And thus at laste satte Iugurth for his age in the myddes bytwene them bothe / as in place of moost honour. Whanne the thre princes were thus sette and had communed of many thynges concernynge the adminystracion of the kyngdome: amonge many and dyuers other thynges Iugurth sayd / that all the statutes and ordynaunces whiche the kynge Micipsa hadde made fyue yeres before his deth / ought of congruence to be adnulled as of none effecte. For in that season (as sayde he) his wyt what for age / what for syckenesse was feble / dull and of small valoure. And therfore suche thynges as he had in that space enacted were done without wysdome or reason. Whanne Hiempsall herde Iugurth thus speke: he answered / sayenge that it pleased hym ryght well that it shulde so be done. For within the same thre yeres (sayd he) our father Micipsa hath adopted you to his sonne / and in his testamēt ordayned you to be partiner of his kyngdome: whiche was the worst and most vnaduised dede that euer he dyd yonge or olde. Wherfore Iugurth accordynge to your owne ordynaunce this must fyrst of all be adnulled and broken / whiche done / my brother and I shall nat greatly contende for the remenant. These wordes of Hiempsall pearsed the hert of Iugurth more profoūdely thanne any man there thought or suspected. Wherfore from that tyme forwarde: what for wrathe of these wordes / and for drede of losse of his porcyon of the kyngdome / his mynde was in great trouble and anguysshe. In somoche that from thens forthe: he went aboute / ymagyned / ordayned / and onely reuoulued in his mynde: by what gyle or treason Hiempsall myght be caught in his daunger. But whanne his purpose proceded but slowly forwarde / consydrynge that the frowarde desyre and vnrefrenable appeti
                           •
                        e of his mynde coude nat be mytigated nor pacyfied: he concluded to bryng his enterprise to effect by any maner meanes outher by preuy treason and gyle: or els by euydent and open violēce & force of armes. But to retourne agayn where I left.

In this first assemble of the thre princes of whiche I spake before: it pleased them all that the treasours of kyng Micipsa shulde be deuyded among them bycause of this dyssencion. And also that the marches and boūdes of eche of theyr dominions / seuerally shulde be assigned to eche of them his porcion. Wherfore the tyme was apoynted and prefixed whanne bothe shulde be done: but the tyme to departe the treasoures was sonner assigned than to deuyde and limitte the boundes of theyr dominions. This apoyntemēt made: the princes departed company: the mynde of Iugurth nat a lytell inquyeted for the sayde checke of Hiempsall: for whiche cause he awayted his tyme to reuenge hym.
                  
                  
                     ¶How Iugurth by treason murdred Hiempsall the yonger sonne of kynge Micipsa. ¶The eyght chapter.
                     
                        WHan the thre prynces were departed in sonder: as I haue sayde before: they soiourned in sondry places / and that nere to the towre where the treasours lay. Hiempsall drewe hym to a towne named Thirmyda nat ferre distant. In whiche towne he had a dwellynge place: than as happened in the same towne was a man of the garde longynge to Iugurth of his lorde ryght derely beloued / and with hym greatly in fauoure. This seruaunt of Iugurth was moche conuersaunt and familyer in the house of Hiempsall / whan Iugurth by chaunce remembred this oportunite to his myscheuous purpose: he called secretly vnto hym his sayde seruaūt. And after many wordes spoken to serche his mynde: at last by promesse of large rewardes he induced hym to cōsent to go as if 
                           •
                        t were to visyte the house of Hiempsall: as he had often done before tyme: and by some meanes & craft to counterfayte the kayes of the gates and brynge them vnto hym. For the ryght kayes: after the gates were locked: nyghly were delyuerd vnto Hiempsall hymselfe: so myght they nat be vnmyssed the space of a nyght. Whan Iugurth had induced the Numidian to cōsent to this dede: he ꝓmysed hymselfe wt
                        in shorte tyme after to come to the sayd lodgyng of Hiempsal what tyme ye case shulde requyre: with great power of armed men. The Numydyan in shorte tyme perfourmed the commaundement of Iugurth / insomoche that he brought vnto hym the counterfayted kayes: as he had apoynted. Iugurth

hereof was gladde in mynde: and anone prepared secretly a great company of armed men: whome he commaunded to bringe vnto hym the heed of Hiempsall trenched from the body: and in executynge of this dede he commaunded them all to be ruled by the Numydyan whiche had counterfayted the keys. This done the sayd Numydyan conuayed these armed men preuyly by nyght into the house of Hiempsall / lyke as he was infourmed by Iugurth. Whan this treatoure satellyte was entred with his company & had broken into the inwarde edifices: diuers of them serched for the prince Hiempsall: som murdred his seruauntes as they lay slepynge in theyr beddys suspectynge no suche treason: some other a wakened with the dynne stert vp and mette theyr ennemyes defendynge themselfe but all in vayne: for they had no leyser to arme themselfe. And therfore were they slayne anone vnarmed of men armed & apointed to myschefe: whan the treatours had longe sought Hiempsall and myght nat fynde hym: than serched they more nerely euery hyd corner / and secret close places they brast open: all was full of dynne mengled with noyse and clamour: So moche they sought and so nerely: that at last they foūde out Hiempsall / hyd in the cotage of a poore seruyng woman to whiche place he had fled at begynnyg of this affray: as a man astonyed for drede and ignorant of the place. Anone as the Numidyans had foūde hym they slewe hym without any mercy. And as they were commaunded cutte of his heed and brought the same to Iugurth: but shortly after: the fame of this cruell and tyrannous dede was diuulgate & ouer spred all the landes of Affrike: Adherball and all they whiche were vnder subieccion of Micepsa whyle he lyued: were sore troubled & abasshed with fere for this tyrannous crueltie of Iugurth. The Numidyans anone deuyded themselfe into two part

                        es. The moost part drewe and leaned to Adherball / but suche as were moost manly and best to batayle drewe them to the other partie: and leaned to Iugurth. Wherfore he made redy as great an army as he myght ioynynge vnto hym and bryngyng vnder his subieccion the townes & cities of Numidy: some by violence / and some other by theyr owne volūtary wyll. In somoch that finally he kept vnder his subieccion and bondage the hole lande of Numidy. But nat withstandynge that Adherbal had sent embassadours to Rome: to certify the senatours of ye deth of his brother how cowardly he was murdred / & also to informe them of his owne miserable fortune & in what case he was: neuerthelesse he made hymselfe redy to fyght wt Iugurth as he which had trust & confidence in multitude of his sowdyours assembled redy to batayle.
                  
                  
                     
                     ¶Howe Iugurth ouercame Adherball in batayll and putte hym to flyght: howe Adherball fledde to Rome to cōplayne to the senatours: and howe Iugurthe accloyed with rewardes many of the rulers of Rome: by whose fauour his cruelte was defended. ¶The .ix. chapter.
                     
                        NOw had Iugurth assembled his hoost redy vnto batayle: nat lyke in multitude to the company of Adherbal: but as I sayd before moche bolder better expert & exercised in warre. On the other partie Adherball had his people redy apointed / and both the armyes approched togyder. But whan they ioyned batayle / and whan it came to byckerynge: that the matter must be tryed with strokes. Anone Adherball was vanquesshed: and to saue his lyfe fledde from the batayle into a prouince marchynge on the lande of Numidy: and frome thens with all hast spedde hym vnto Rome to complayne his miserable fortune / and to requyre socours / as I shall afterwarde declare. But than Iugurth whan he had all the lande of Numydy at his pleasure / counselled with his frendes of many thynges. At conclusion: whan he consydred by hymselfe that he had slayne Hiempsall and chased Adherball out of his kyngdome: whan he was ydle and at rest: he often secretly reuoulued in mynde his owne crueltie: sore dredynge what punysshement the Romains wolde ordayne agaynst the same. Nor agaynst the ire and displeasure of the Romains had he none other hope nor confort / saue in the couetyse of the noble men of Rome / and in thabundaunce of his treasours: wherwith he trusted to corrupte the rulers of Rome to be fauorable to hym. This consydred within fewe dayes after he sent to Rome embassadours with moche golde and siluer to whome he gaue in commaundement: that first of all they shulde satisfy his olde frendes with rewardes and money / and than to spare no gyftes to get vnto hym mo new frendes. And brefely that they shulde nat spare nor tary to procure vnto hym fauourers and mainterners of his part: and all thynges for his auauntage by gyftes and promysses. But after these embassadours were come to Rome: accordyng to the cōmaundement of theyr kyng: they gaue and sent to his acquayntaunce and frendes / and to suche as amonge the senatours: at that tyme had moost authorite: large and great rewardes.

Insomoche that anone among them was so great a chaunge: that the maruelous enuy / hatred and euyl wyll: which they had agaynst Iugurthe was all chaunged into fauour and grace amonge the noble men. Of whome some were so induced by gyftes receyued: and some other by hope of brybes in tyme to come: that they went about among the senatours from one to one / labourynge & intretyng that at that season nothyng shuld be extremely nor greuously determined agaynst Iugurth. Thus after the embassadours of Iugurth had cōfidence and trust ynough in theyr cause they laboured to haue a day apointed to apere in court. The day of apparence was graunted as well to them as to Adherball: to Adherball as playntife: and to the embassadours as defendentes for Iugurth: whan the day assigned was come bothe the parties appered in court before the senatours / than after audience graunted / Adherball began to speke vnder forme folowynge / for complaint and declaracion of his iniuries and oppression.

                        MOost dyscrete chosen fathers and noble senatours: Micipsa my father at houre of his deth cōmaūded me that I shulde thynke nought els of the lande of Numidy to apertayne to me: saue onely the rule and administracion of the same: affirmynge that the title of possession and empyre of the same belonged to you & to the people of Rome. Moreouer he gaue me in commaundement to do my deuoyr: to be vnto you seruiable aboue all thynges: both in place and in warre. And that I shulde count you vnto me in place of kynsmen: and nerest frendes of alyaunce. Sayenge that if I so dyd: than by your amite and frendshyppe I shulde fynde socours / ryches / and defence of the kyngdome of Numydy / and of me and myne

in all tymes of nede: which preceptꝭ of my father: whyle I kest in mynde to obserue: sodaynly Iugurth the moost cruell & cursed of all men whome the grounde susteyneth / dyspisyng your empyre: hath dryuen me from your kyngdome & from all my other goodes of fortune: nothyng regardynge that I am neuew of Massinissa / and by myne auncetry a felowe and frende of the empyre and people of Rome. But certaynly worthy and chosen fathers: syth I am come to that misery that necessite cō
                        strayneth me to desyre your ayde and socours: I wolde moch rather that I myght call for your helpe: for myne owne merytes agaynst you done: than for the merites of my forefathers: and that by suche meanes of myne owne deseruynge / your benefites and socours were due vnto me / which wolde god that I neded nat at all: but if this your socours myght so of you be desyred by my merites & deseruyng: than shulde I call boldly to you: and vse your socours of duety as myne auncetry haue done in tymes passed. But nowe syth it is so / that honest lyfe and innocence: in this worlde fyndeth lytell surenesse by themselfe without proteccion of some other. Moreouer syth it was nat in my power to mitigate nor to withstande this tyrannous iniury of Iugurth. Therfore chosen fathers I am nowe fled vnto you as to my chefe refuge / coarted to necessitie to requyre your socours and cōstrayned to put you to besynes & charge: before I haue done any pleasure or profet vnto you: whiche thyng greued me moost of all / and is one of my gretest miseries. Ryght worthy senatours other kynges haue ben receyued into yor frendshyppe & fauour / after ye haue ouercome them in batayle / or els perceyuynge themselfe in danger and in doubtfull chaūches of fortune: they haue coueyted and desyred your felowshyppe and fauour / rather for theyr owne wele than for yours. But moche contrarely: our forefathers and rote of our lynage Massinissa confederated hymselfe with the people of Rome in the seconde batayle of Carthage: what tyme was more faythfulnes to be trusted in them & theyr good wyll / than of welth or riches to be optayned of the romains / beynge at that tyme assayled with warre on euery syde: theyr riches and treasours consumed by often batayles. Thus it is euident that our auncetry confederat nat themselfe to your felowshyp for theyr owne defence: in hope of riches: in hope of dominion: nor for any other priuate profet / but onely for fauour & loue whiche they had vnto your empyre. Wherfore noble senatours suffre nat the progeny and braunches of this stocke to be distroyed. Suffre nat me whiche am neuewe of your trusty frende Massinissa to aske of you helpe and socours in vayne. But prudēt fathers: if it were so that I had none other cause to demaunde

socours of you / saue onely this miserable fortune wherwith I am oppressed: that I whiche was lately a kyng by lineall dyscent: myghty of auncetry: excellent and clere of fame: habundaūt in riches and of men of armes / and now dysformed by myserable calamite / poore and nedy / so that I am constrayned to seke helpe & socours of other men: if I had none other mater wherof to complayne / saue this miserable fortune onely. Neuerthelesse it longeth & is conuenient to the magesty of the people of Rome / to prohibite & to withstande iniury. And nat to suffre ye kyngdome or dominion of any man to ryse and increase by falshode & myscheuous tyranny. And the ryght heyres agaynst ryght / agaynst iustice / and agaynst reason / to be excluded from theyr true heritage. But verely I am excluded and cast forthe of that countrey / which the romayns in tyme passed gaue vnto my forefathers: out of the which countrey my father & grandfather accompanyed with your army and helpe: haue chased ye kynge Siphax / and also the Carthaginences / bothe moost violent enmyes to the empyre of Rome. Your benefites be spoyled fro me: In this myn iniury be ye dispysed. Wo is me miserable exulate: Alas my dere father Micipsa / ar your gode dedes & kyndnes anenst Iugurth come to this poynt and cōclusion: that he before all other shuld namely be dystroyer of your lynage & chyldren: whome ye haue made felowe wt your owne son̄es: & also partyner of yor kyngdome: alas: than shal our stocke & houshold neruer be quyet? Shall we alway betossed & turned in effusion of blode / in batayle / in exyle & in chasing frō our coūtrey. ¶Whyle the Carthaginences raygned in prosperite / we suffred and that paciētly / & nat vndeserued all cruelte & vexacion For them were our ennemies on euery syde of vs: our frendes in whome we shuld haue founde socour at tyme of nede were ferre disioyned & separate from vs. Thus all our hope: all our trust was in our strength & armour. But nowe after that pestilent dystruction of the Carthaginences is chased & casten out of Affrike we cōtinued a tyme ioyfull & quyet: passynge our lyfe in peace and trāquilite / for why we had no ennemy: except paraduēture for any iniury done agaynst you ye wold commaūde vs to take your enmy for ours also / as reason and ryght requyred. But nowe sodaynly & vnwarely to vs: this Iugurth exaltynge hymselfe by his intollerable audacite / by cruelte & pryde hath first slayne my brother & his owne nere kynsmam Hiempsall: & in augmentynge his myschefe hath vsurped to hym as in pray my brothers part & porcion of the kyngdome of Numydy / and after: seynge that he myght nat take me lyke maner of trayne as he had done my brother / 

what tyme I douted nothynge lesse than any violence or batayle in the kyngdome whiche I holde of you / he hath chased me (as ye may se) out of your kyngdome / and hath made me as an abiect outlawe: chased from my coūtrey: and dwe

In so moche that I may be in more suerty & saue garde in any place of the worlde / than in my owne natyfe coūtrey & kyngdome / whiche I holde of you. Forsothe worthy senatours: I haue euer thought in lyke maner as I haue oftentymes herde my father Micipsa openly report with sadnesse: sayeng that they which shuld diligētly cōtynue in your frendshyp by theyr meritꝭ / must take great labors at many tymes vpon themselfe in your causes: but of all men they wer most sure from iniury of any man: And sothely all my lynage hath done asmoche as in them was at your desyres: And euer hath ben redy in all batayls & nedes to assyst you. Wherfore if ye folowe the preceptꝭ of gratitude: if ye bere in remēbraunce these merites of myne auncetry / it is bothe right & honesty that in this myne extreme necessite / ye ayde & socour me & restore me agayn to quyetnes: whyle ye haue none other busynesses in hand / whiche may be to you īpedimēt ī this enterprise. Moost discret fathers: more brefely & clerly to declare vnto you my cōplaint & my mysery: And also to certify your excellence more playnly of myne vnnaturall & vnkynd kynsman Iugurth: and of his cruelte. It is nat vnknowen vnto yor mageste: that my father Micipsa after his departyng: left behynde hym vs two brethern his naturall & laufull son̄es: supposyng that by his benefytes & merites Iugurth shulde be ioyned with vs / as thyrde brother. But alas: moche cōtrary thone of vs is murdred by this cruell Iugurth / blynded by insaciable ambicion & desyre of dominion. And I my selfe the seconde brother skarsly and with great difficulte haue escaped his cruell & vnmercyfull hādes: what may I do? or whether shall I rathest fle for confort vnhappy exulate thus desolate & infortunate as I am? All the socours all ye cōfort / of my stocke & kynred is extinct by deth my grandfather Massinissa / & my father Micipsa: as necessite hath cōstrayned them: haue payed ye generall tribute of nature: delyuered from these mūdayne vexaciōs by naturall deth. My nere kynsman Iugurth: moch otherwyse than it be came hym to do: hath cursedly bereft my brother of his lyfe by tyranny & myscheuous couetise of dominion: myne other kynsmen by cōsanguynite & affinite: withall myne other frendes by his cruelte ben also oppressed or put to dethe / some by one meanes & some by other: some of hym be taken captyue: some put to shamefull deth of gybet / galous / or crosse / wt most cruell

                        oured of them. A fewe whiche ar left with theyr lyues / are closed in dongyons & darknes: passyng theyr miserable lyues with mournyng & waylyng more greuous than deth. Thus 
                           •
                        m I inuyroned with anguysshe on euery syde. But if it wer so: that all these socours whiche I haue lost by cruelte of Iugurth: or if all thyngꝭ which be turned to me: from prosperite to aduersite / remayned to this hour hole without detrimēt or dāmage lyke as they were in my best estate: yet certaynly noble senatours: if any yll or mysfortune vnprouided shulde happen vnto me: I durst be bolde to call your ayde and confort. Bycause it semeth you to haue cure of right & wrong belongyng to euery man: cōsydryng the excellent magnitude & gretnes of your empire / and to suffre no vertue vnrewarded nor vice vnpunysshed / and finally no wretch oppressed to contynue vndefended. But now moost of all sythe I am exulate from my natyf coūtrey / from the kyngdome which my father ruled vnder you: and from my owne house & dwellyng place / also nedy and poore of all thyngꝭ belongynge to myne estate / and alone without company or defence: to whome or to what place may I resorte: or in whome may I call for ayde or conforte in these my manyfolde miseries. Shall I resorte or call for socours of nacions / or of kynges adiacent and about the lande of Numydy: alas I shulde lytell preuayle or nought at all. Syth all they for your amyte ioyned with you: be mortall ennemyse to vs & to our lynage: may I resort to any contrey about vs: but that I shulde fynde there many tokens of cruelte of warre: which my fathers haue done in theyr tymes passed in your causes. Whyther shall any of them which haue ben our old ennemis / haue mercy or cōpassyon on vs nowe in this our extremite. But finally most noble senatours / my father Micipsa thus ordred vs at his departynge: and gaue vs in commaundemēt that we shulde obserue nor mentayne the frendshyppe of none other kyng nor people / saue onely of the people of Rome: and that we shuld seke no newe felowshyp / nor newe confederacions or bondes of cōcorde sayeng that in your frendshyp & helpe: we shuld fynde great socours & ayde and that largely. But if it shuld fortune that ye welth of this your empire shuld fall into ruyne or chāge from this excellēce (whiche the goddes defende) than: sayde he that we and our kyngdome of necessite shulde also decay togyder with you. But now lauded be the goddes by whose helpe & fauour / and by your owne strength & vertue: ye be at this tyme myghty & riche: all thyng to you is prosperous and to your cōmaundement obeyng. Wherfore it is somoch more laufull / easy and

O my brother my brother Hiempsall / most dere to my hart of all creatures: howbeit nowe thy lyfe is bereft the in thy flouryng youth / longe before thy naturall hour of deth: and yt by cruelte of hym / whome it semed nat of all men so to haue done: neuertheles me thynketh in my mynd this chaūce of thy deth more to be ioyned of: than to be sorowed. For thou hast nat onely lost thy lyfe & thy kyngdome: but also thou hast escaped this chasynge / this flyght / this exyle / this nede / this pouerty withall other wretchednesses & miseries / whiche oppresseth me wtout cōfort or socours. But I vnhappy & miserable exulate thus throwen downe from my fathers kyngdome into so many yls & so great myseries / may welbe an example and spectacle to al ye world of the mutable courses wherin fortune

O my dere brother vncertayne am I what I do: whyther I thus distitute of socour and ayde: may persecute and reueng thy iniuries & thy deth / or els whether I may prouide and seke socours for recoueryng of the lande of Numidy.

Wold god I were deed out of hande: if deth myght be an honest conclusion of these my miserable misfortunes: rather than to be counted as content & pleased to lyue in rebuke and shame / as an exulate weryed & ouercom with iniuries: and gyueng place to the iniust cruelte of tyrannous persecucion / and as nat able nor bolde to resist the same. But nowe certaynly it is agaynst my wyll that I lyue / for in my lyfe I haue no lyking nor pleasure / and yet can I nat dye without dishonour. Wherfore moost prudent fathers & noble senatours: these premisses consydred: I obtest & humbly requyre you: in honour of the goddes immortall: for thaunciēt amyte bytwene you and my forefathers: for the naturall loue whiche ye haue agaynst your chyldren & parentes and by the mageste of the people of Rome: & this your most excellent empire: haue pyte of my manyfolde calamitees & socour this my misery. Resist this tyrannous dealyng & iniury of Iugurth commytted nat onely agaynst my wretched persone: but also agaynst you and your empire. Suffre nat the kyngdome of Numidy: which is your owne: to decay and be distroyed by cruell tyranny of Iugurth / and by the effusion of blode and murdre of the linage of Massinissa / somtyme most faythfull and constant frende of this your empire.
                  
                  
                     ¶Howe the embassadours of Iugurth replyed agaynst these wordes of Adherball: & what dyreccion was taken for bothe parties of the senatours of Rome. ¶The .xi. chapter.
                     
                        AFter that Adherball / in forme aboue writen had ended his complaynt: anone the embassadours of Iugurth arose & answerd brefely in fewe wordes: as they whiche had more trust & confidence in theyr great gyftes gyuen before to many of the rulers of Rome: than in any right of theyr cause and thus they replyed in effecte: sayeng before the senatours that Hiempsall was slayne of the Numidyans for his owne hastines & cruelte / and nat by knowlege of Iugurth: and as touchyng Adherball: he began warr agaynst Iugurth of his owne froward mynd without any occasion: but after he was

ouercome in batayle / bycause he was nat able to reueng hym selfe / nor to make his partie good / he fled vnto Rome to complayne hym to the senators of Iugurth: where as all ye faute was in hymselfe and in none other / concernyng the partie of Iugurth: they requyred the senatours in his behalfe in his absence to count hym none other / than he was ꝓued & knowen in the warre of Numance: and that they wold nat set more by the wordes of his ennemy / than by his dedes magnificently proued. This sayd: anone after: bothe parties deꝑted in sonder from the court. Immediatly the senatours toke coūsell what best was to be done in the cause. The fauourers of Iugurth & of his embassadours / and more ouer a great part of the senatours were corrupt before by parcialite / fauour / and rewardꝭ of Iugurth / and so deprauat: that they contemned & set at nought ye wordes of Adherball / exaltyng & cōmendyng the manhode of Iugurth: with laude / fauour / coūtenaunce / voyce / and all other signes: And so finally they laboured by all maner of meanes for an others myscheuous vice & cruell cryme to defende the same: as if it had ben in defence of theyr owne honour / worshyp / & honeste. But on the other part were a fewe other / whiche set more by iustice and honeste / than by false goten riches: these counselled to socour Adherball and sharply to punysshe & reuēge the deth of Hiēpsal. But among all other of this opinion: was one named Emilius Scaurus a man of noble byrth redy to disturbe euery busynes / debatful & besy: desirous of power / of authorite / of honour & of riches: but crafty in clokyng of these his fautes. After this Emilius Scaurꝰ sawe his gyueng of brybes of Iugurth so shamfully & openly knowen: he fered l

Wherfore in this cōsideracion / he refrayned his mynde at this tyme from his accustomed vnlaufull lustes. Neuertheles among ye senators in this coūsell the worst part preuayled: and yt part which set more by fauour & rewardes than by right & equite / ouercam ye other part / which lab

                        ured to sustayne ye right wtout any fauour or parcialite. And so the fauourers of Iugurth optayned theyr purpose / & his cruelte had no punysshmēt. Neuertheles it was cōcluded & decreed that .x. embassadors shuld be sent into Numidy to diuide ye kyngdome which longed to Micipsa bytwene Iugurth & Adherbal. The principal of this embassade was one named Lucius Opimius a man of noble fame / of great authorite & power among the senatours in those dayes: what tyme Caius Gracchus & Marcus Fuluius great fauourers of

the cōmens: were slayne of the noble men of Rome for ye same cause: After victory of the noble men agaynst the cōmens & the same two princes: this Lucius Opimius enraged greuously wt rigorous & sharpe inquisicions & examinaciōs agaynst the poore cōmente: And was one of the chefe oppressers of them. What tyme this Lucius Opimiꝰ wt his cōpany was come to Numidy: Iugurth prepared to attempt his old craftes: And howbeit he had founde the same Lucius for one of his ennemies at Rome / neuertheles he receyued hym worshypfully & with great diligēce. And wt gyueng & ꝓmisyng many thyngꝭ he brought his purpose so to effect / that this Lucius at cōclusion preferred the fauour & profet of Iugurth before his owne good name & fidelite: & brefely: before all thyngꝭ belongyng to hymselfe. This brought to passe: anone he went in hand wt the other of ye embassadors after the same way: & many of thē he wan & ouercāe with gyftes. very fewe of them were which set more by theyr fayth & treuth than by money & rewardes of Iugurth. Wherfore whā it was come to limitacion & separacion of the lande of Numidy / bytwene Adherball & Iugurth as the sayd embassadors were cōmaunded of the senatours: that part of the kyngdome which marched toward Mauritany / or the lande of the Mauriens beyng most opulent and plentyfull of fruitfull fyldes and of men / was gyuen to Iugurth: but the other part / which was more pleasant than ꝓfitable as ornate without hauyn townes and fayre edifyces: was cōmytted to possession of Adherball.
                     ¶Nowe for asmoche as in this hystory before & most of all in sequele and ꝓcesse of the same / hath & shalbe made mencion of many places & townes of Affrike: to thintent that thystory may be more clere and euident / me thynketh it requisite and conuenient brefely to describe the sytuacion of Affrike: and a lytell to touche those peoples and countreis / whiche with the romayns had at any tyme amite or frenshyp / other peace or warre. But suche places and nacions whiche for heat and wyldernes be lytell frequented of people / or nat inhabited: of them it is nat easy to describe nor declare the truth: for by difficulte of the places / fewe or none resorteth thyder perfetly to knowe the same. But the other partes frequented of people I shall as brefely declare as can be touched.
                  
                  
                     ¶The descripcion of the habitable parties of the countrey of Affrike / namely of suche nacions as had amyte or warre with the Romayns. ¶The .xii. chapter.
                     
                        
                        IN diuision of the circle of the worlde the opinion of most writers is: that it is diuided into thre partes / Europe / Asy / & Affrike. A fewe other authours hold opinion: that it is deuided onely into two partes / that is to say Asy & Europe: so that vnder climate of ye part whiche is called Europe: the thirde part named Affrike is cōprehēded. But this last opinion is leest alowed. This countrey of Affrike hath his bondes on the see of Italy on the West part / and on the occean see it abordeth partly on the same syde: on the Est part therof is a declinyng & pendant valey tyght ample & large. Thinhabytaūtes of this valey call it Cathabathmon in theyr affrike langage: that is to say in englyssh / a dependāt valey. On this Est syde: the see is outragyous / cruell / perilous & wtout any sure hauen: but the fyldes & soyle on this part ar plentyfull of corne / and for all maner beestes is good pasture / but the soyle is nat apt to trees beryng frute: of water is scarcite / bothe of rayne water / & of water springyng of the erth. The disposicion of the people is holsome of body / swyft / & may well endure labour. Insomoche that the most part dye for extreme age / saue suche as be slayne wt wepyn / or deuoured of wylde beestꝭ. For it is nat often sene ye corruption of humours ingendring any infirmite bryngeth to deth. In this coūtrey be also many rauynous beestes & of diuers kyndes / deuourynge all thyng which they may ouercome. But this omityng I wyll nowe brefely declare what maner people first of all inhabited this countrey of Affrike / and what people thyther resorted to inhabite next after them. And howe thesame peoples were myngled togyder. Howebeit that whiche I shall write is moche diuers from the commen fame and opinion of many men: neuerthelesse / I shall folowe the bokes writen in Affrike langage / which (as it is sayd) belonged to the yong prince Hiempsall: whome Iugurth murdred: of the same bokes I shall folowe the true interpretacion in this mater / and lyke as the inhabitauntes of the same countrey afferme to be true. But touchynge the very credence of the treuth of the mater I report that to the authours.
                     ¶The first people whiche inhabited the countrey of Affrike were named Getulians & Lybeās / a people hard / sharpe & vnmanerd. These lyued of flesshe of wyld beestꝭ / & fedde vpon ye groūde as beestꝭ vnresonable. And were nat ruled by any maners / but lyued wtout lord or lawes / as vagabūdes & rouers. They had no certayn byding placꝭ / but wher as ye nyght toke thē: ther they rested for ye tyme. But after yt Hercules dyed in Hispayne / as the Affricās say: his army which was assēbled

of dyuers nacions / whan their captayne and heed was lost: dispersed themselfe abrode anone after his deth / and came to dyuers places of the worlde to seke theyr fortune / where they myght optayne any habitacion or lordshyppe. Of whiche company / the Medeans / Perseans / and Armenyans arriued with theyr shyppes in that coost of Affrike / which was nerest to the empire of Rome / and longe tyme after occupied those costes. But the Persyans inhabited themselfe more inwarde in the countrey towarde the occean see: and in stede of houses they tourned theyr shyppes botomes vpwarde and dwelled vnder the same. And no maruayle / for in the countre about them grewe no tymber nor other stuffe mete for buyldynge / nor of the Spanyardꝭ which inhabited next to them / neyther myght they bye nor borowe. For the see was so great & tempestous bytwene them / and theyr langages so dyuers & vnknowen to eyther people / that by these two īpedimētes they were letted from the cors of marchādise or exchāges bytwene thē. These Persiens by meane of mariages by lytell & lytell mengled the Getulyans wt them / and bycause they proued oftentymes the cōmodite of theyr grounde & feldes by often cōmutacions & chaungyngꝭ one with other / at last they named themselfe Numidyās / that is to say herdmen deuided. And to this present daye the cotages or tylmens houses be made longe wt croked sydes or couertures bowyng inwarde as if they were helyes of shyppes trāsuersed or turned vp set downe. Towchyng ye Medeans & Armenyns they ioyned themselfe wt the Libyēs. For these Medeans & Armeniēs dwelled before more nere to the see of Affrike. The Getulyans inhabited more nere to ye son̄e rising: nat farre frō the feruent coūtrey of Inde and this people anone had rowmes & dwelling places / for the see bytwene them & Hispayne was but narowe / wherfor they agreed with the Hispaniardes to make exchanges & bartynges of marchādyse with them. The Lybiens corrupted theyr name by lytell and lytell changyng the same / & at last in stede of Medyans named thēselfe Mauriēs by barbarike ꝓnunciacion of theyr langage. But the welth & riches of the Persiens in short tyme increased and multiplied. In somoch that after they had named themselfe Numidyans / they increased in so great multitude: that theyr fyrst coūtrey was nat able to norysshe them all: So that afterwarde many of the yong and lusty people departed in sonder from theyr frendes & last their countrey / resortynge to a countrey nere the cite of Carthage / vacant at that tyme: In whiche countrey the inhabited them selfe and named it Numidy after theyr name. Shortely after this: bothe they whiche remayned styll in theyr first countrey

and these which remoued thens / assisted one an other withall maner of helpe & socours. Insomoche that what by strength and what by fear they brought vnder theyr subieccion and dominion suche other nacions as marched nere them: so that within shorte tyme they moche inhaunced & augmented their name and glory / but most namely they which inhabited that part of Affrike / whiche is ouer agaynst Italy and nere the Italyan see / these most increased in welth and honour. For the Lybiens were nat so good men of warre as the Getulians or Numydyans. And so all the inward part of Affrike was for the most part in possession of the Numidyans / and so moche dyd they: that all the nacions of them subdued were called Numidyans after the name of ouercomers. Nowe haue we declared howe the Getulians and Lybiās were first inhabitaūtes of Affrike: and howe the Perseans / Medeans / and Armenyens came afterwarde and ioyned with them. Howe the Perseans named themselfe Numidyans. And the Medeans and Armenyens by corrupcion of langage were called Mauriens.
                     ¶And nowe cōsequently I shall declare what other people came afterwarde and inhabited the same lande of Affrike. After all these nacions before rehersed: out of ye 
                        land of Phenyce came moche people to inhabite themselfe in Affrike. Some bycause their owne countrey was nat sufficient to sustayne so great a multitude as were of them. And other some great men of byrth & desyrous of lordshyp raysed vp & assembled the nedy cōmen people & left their owne coūtrey: in hope to fynd some other greater dominion els where / and in ꝓcesse of tyme aryued at ye lande of Affrike: and there buylded thre cities vpon the see coost named Hippona / Adrumentum and Leptis: with other dyuers cities: but nat so great & famous as these were. These cities in short tyme were so augmēted & increased that some of them were honour / and some socoure & ayde to their originall coūtreis. But of the cite of Carthage which also by them was buylded / and afterwarde became the heed cite of Affrike: me thynke it is better to passe ouer wt scilence: than of it to speke a lytell & than to leue the mater in the myddes vnparfet / & also this my busynes ꝓcedeth to an other purpose. Neuerthelesse somwhat shall I touche the first foundacion of this cite of Carthage / nat folowyng myne authour Salust: which wryteth nothynge therof: but folowynge the opinion of Vergil as he wryteth in the first boke of Eneas. ¶The quene Dydo doughter of Belus kyng of the land of Cypre and wyfe to Sycheus kynge of Phenyce: fledde with her shyppes laded with golde & other ryches out of her owne

coūtrey: dredyng ye cruelte of her brother Pygmalion: which blynded by couetyse and ambicyon had slayne her husbande Sicheus by treason. This Dido at last aryued wit her shippes & company at the coost of Affricke / where rayned a kyng named Hierbas: which moued with beaute of Dido desyred her to wyfe. But for loue whiche she had to her first husbande Sicheus she wold nat cōsent therto by any meanes: but desyred to bye of the same kynge Hierbas as moche ground as myght be cōpassed about with hyde of a bull. And after that it was graūted / she cut the hyde of a bull so small / that with the same she cōpassed thre myle of groūde in compasse. In which space & circuite she bylded a cite: which first was named Byrsa. After in proces of tyme it was called Tyros: and last of all Carthage / vnder whiche name by long continuance so amply it encreased in fame and welth: that it contayned .xxiiii. myles in cōpasse. But whan it was in most excellence it was vtterly distroied by the romains Publius Scipio Affricane that tyme beyng captayne of the romayne army. Touchynge the foundacion of this famous cite of Carthage / somoche haue I written more than myne authour Salust. But nowe wyll I returne to myne institute & purpose cōcernyng the dyscripcion of Affrike / & brefely bryng it to cōclusion. The valey of whom I spake before named in Affrike lāgage Cathabathmon / deuided the coūtrey of Affrike from Egypt on that syde saue that an arme of the see is bytwene the first cite or habitacion of Affrike towarde this valey / & is called Cyrene. And nere to the same be other two cites / the one named Tolonia / ye other Thercon: beyond these thre cities be two quicksādes / & bytwene bothe ye sādes a cite named Leptis. Beyond this cite of Leptis / is a place named of the romains Phylenorum are in englysshe: the auters of two bretherne called Philenis / bycause these two brethern suffred thēselfe to be quicke buryed in the same place for the cōmen wele of theyr coūtrey: wherof thy story herafter shalbe written at more oportunite. This place diuideth the dominion of Carthage from Egypt on that syde. After this place on the syde costes be other cities belongynge to the dominyon of Punike. All the places from thens forthe to Mauritany or lande of the Mauriens / be vnder subieccion of the Numydyans. The Mauriens haue theyr habytacyon nere to Hispayne. But as we rede: the Getulyans haue theyr habitacion beyond the Numidyās: some in poore lodgys: and some other more vylely without habitacion wandrynge as vagabūdes. Beyond these Getulyans is the lande of Ethyope: and from thens forthe be coūtreis so brent with feruour of the sonne that they be inhabitable.

But duryng this warre bytwene the romayns and Iugurth: the romains had in theyr possession many townes of Punike and moche of the costes of thempyre of Carthage: and ruled the same by officers vnder them therto assigned. A great part of Numydy and of the Getulyans vnto a flodde named Mulucham: was vnder the dominion of Iugurth. Ouer all the Maurians raygned one kyng named Bocchus: of whome the romayns had no knowlege saue of his name onely. And before this batayle: he was nother in peace nor in warre acquaynted / nor knowen of the romayns. Of Affrike & of thinhabitaūtes of the same: ynough is spoken and as moche as is requysite of necessite to the processe of this hystory. Nowe wyll I make regression and prosecute my first purposed mater insuyng myne authour Salust.
                  
                  
                     ¶How Iugurth inuaded the kyngdome of Adherball yet ones agayn: and how Adherball agayne was ouercome in batayle: & put to flyght. ¶The .xiii. chapter.
                     
                        AFter the embassadours of Rome: of whome I haue spoken before: had diuided the realme of Numidy bytwene Adherball & Iugurth / and were departed out of Affrike towarde Rome: anone Iugurth reuoulued in mynde howe he had escaped vnpunisshed for his crueltie otherwyse thā his mynde feared before: And how in stede of punysshement: for his syn̄e: he was rewarded with ye better part of the lande of Numidy. Nowe he consydred that all was true whiche his frendes had tolde hym before whyle he was in Hispayne with the romayne army in the warre of Numance: that is to say. That nothynge was so false & iniust: but that myght be iustifyed at Rome for money / for all thyng myght be bought therefor money. This consideracion inhaunced his mynde vnto esperance & that nat a lytell. Forthermore he was inflamed with the large promesses of them: whome he had acloyed before with gyftes & rewardes at Rome: In somoche that agayne of newe he fixed his mynde to inuade & vsurpe the kyngdome of Adherball / and by some poynt of prodicion to take hym in trap as he had done Hiempsall his brother. This Iugurth was fiers / sharpe / & apte to warr well inured with thesame & expert ī feates therof: but cōtrarely Adherbal: whome he assayled & pursued: was a mete man & oportune to

take iniury / more ferefull and dredyng other / than to be drad of other. Wherfore sodenly / and without any prouision on party of Adherball: Iugurth inuaded the marches of his kyngdome / with a great power & multitude of men of armes / many of thinhabitantes he murdred / and many toke he prisoners with beestes & all other maner of prayes / robbyng and spoyling euery where: as ferre as his army disꝑsed / townes / castels and other edifyces he brent & beat downe: and many other places he assayled and inuaded more inwardly in the coūtrey by excourses of his horsemen. This done he returned into his countrey with all his multitude / prayes & prisoners: supposynge that Adherball moued with angre & displeasure wold reuenge these iniuries / and that thyng shulde be cause & occasion of open warre bytwene them. But Adherball aduised hymselfe well: by remembraunce of his first batayle had with Iugurth that he was nat able to contende with hym in batayle nor with force of armes: and more ouer 
                           •
                         he had more cōfidence & trust in frendshyp of the Romayns / than in the inconstāt Numidyans / which leaned more to his ennemy than to hym. These thynges consydred: he send embassadours to Iugurth to complayne of these iniuries: But these embassadours had nought els of hym but contumelious / proude and hasty wordes. And so dispised of Iugurth returned agayn to theyr lord Adherball: though suche answers myght haue moued any coragious hert: neuerthelesse Adherball determined in mynde: to suffre all thynges and to take many iniuries paciently: rather than agayn to begyn batayle with Iugurth. For (as sayd is) the batayle foughten before bytwene them was bothe to dishonour & also great dammage. But for all this suffrance of Adherball: the mynde of Iugurth was nat more pacified / nor lessed of his cruelte. The pacience of Adherball abated nat the Ire of Iugurth: but it augmēted: For all redy he had cōcluded in mynde to inuade ye hole kyngdōe of Numidy. Therfore he began agayn of newe: nat as before with a cōpany of reuers / but with a myghty and great army assembled togyder demeanyng open warre / and chalangyng openly the hole empire of Numidy / and with such power proceded into the land of Adherball: wastyng the townes & fyldꝭ on euery syde / dryuing away prayes of catell & other riches: and increasyng corage to his men / and drede to his ennemis. Whan Adherball sawe it was come to that point that he must nedes other abandon and gyue ouer his kyngdome / or els mayntayne it with force of armes / as he which was constrayned by extreme necessite: he assembled & empareyled an army aswell as he myght / and with thesame proceded forth to mete

Iugurth. At last the two hoostes of Adherball & of Iugurth approched & rested nere togyder / besyde a towne named Cirtha / nat ferre distant from the seecoost / and for asmoch as the day drewe nere to nyght: the batayle was nat anone begon: but eyther party remayned in theyr tentes. Anone after moch of the nyght was ouerpassed / and the starre lyght somwhat dymmed wt obscurite of cloudꝭ. The soudiours of Iugurth raysed by the sounde of trūpettes vnwarly & sodenly inuaded and assayled the tentes & felde of Adherball: some they murdred halfe slepynge: & some other they flewe whyle they were in hande to arme themselfe. On part of Adherball was petefull murdre: and on syde of Iugurth no mercy / but abstinat persecucion & vengeaūce: and so fiersly fought Iugurth and his cōpany that shortly Adherbal fled to the towne of Cirtha / acōpanyed with a fewe horsmen. But Iugurth pursued hym so nerely / that if the inhabitantes of the towne of Cirtha in hast & with great multitude had nat receyued Adherball / and with force of armes defended the walles / & kept forth the soudyours of Iugurth whiche persued Adherball: the batayle bytwene them both shuld haue begon & ended that one same day / and that to destruction of Adherball. But Iugurth perceyuyng the entre into the towne denyed to hym / anone beseged it on euery syde with all maner ingynes inuasyue to his ennemies / and defensyue to his company: he caused hastely to be framed large pauayses and towres of tymbre to be dryuen vpon whelis toward the walles of the towne. And with these and all maner other ingynes went in hande fiersly to assayle the towne: and somoch more hastely he sped hym / to thintēt to bryng his purpose to effect / before any embassadors shuld cōe from Rome to resyst his enterprise. For asmoche as before this batayle he had herd that Adherball had sende embassadours to Rome to certify the senators of his miserable state.
                  
                  
                     ¶Howe the fauourers of Iugurth at Rome laboured so in his cause / that thre yong men inexpert and wtout policy were send embassadors into Affrike to cesse this stryfe bytwene the two kynges: and howe these embassadours retourned to Rome without any thyng done ¶The .xiiii. chapter.
                     
                        BVt after the senatours at Rome herd tidynges of this batayle / they send into Affrike thre yonge gentylmen in embassade / cōmaundyng them to go to bothe the kynges / & to commaund them in behalfe of the senatours and of the hole people of Rome to cesse theyr warre / and to shewe

them that the senate and Romayns wylled and vtterly commaunded them so to do. And so doyng / they shuld do as it semed them: and as of cōgruence they ought to do both for pleasure of the Romayns & for theyr owne honour & profet. The embassadours with suche cōmaundement hasted them and came vnto Affrike / the senatours had commaunded them to make somoche more expedicion in theyr iourney / bycause tydyngꝭ were brought to Rome / whan these embassadours prepared themselfe forward: how the batayle was done bytwene Adherball & Iugurth / and how Iugurth kept Adherball beseged straytly within the towne of Cirtha. But this rumour was somwhat alayed & kept secrete by fauourers of Iugurth / after these embassadors were come to Numidy: they expressed to Iugurth theffect of theyr embassade / in forme as the senatours had cōmaunded them. Whan Iugurth vnderstode the pleasur of the senatours by theyr wordes & embassade: he answered benignely / sayeng that he counted no erthly thyng more great / nor excellent / nor more dere vnto hym than the authorite of the senatours & people of Rome / and that from his yougth to that tyme he had euer so indeuored to order hymself that euery good & worshypfull man cōmended & alowed hym for his vertu & manhode / and nat for malyce nor mysdemeanour. And for the same manlynes & nat for malicious dedes / nor for disordred maners his cōpany and conuersacion was accept and pleasour vnto the ryght hygh & worthy captayne Publius Scipio. Moreouer: for the same cōuersacion and good maners & nat for faute of chyldren naturall / his vncle Micipsa had adopted hym for his son̄e: and made hym inheritour of his kyngdome / partiner wt his owne naturall sonnes: and for asmoch as he had demeaned hymselfe ryght well and worthely / in executynge of many hygh & glorious interprises: somoch the lesse coude he suffre iniury done vnto hym vnreuenged. As touchyng Adherball Iugurth alleged for hymselfe that this Adherball by gyle & treason lay in wayt to slee hym: which thyng perceyued: he made resystence agaynst the same to the best of his power / as any man was bounde to do for sauegard of his owne lyfe. And if the romayns wolde prohybit & deny that vnto hym / whiche Iustice permytted to euery man (that is / with violence to resyst & repell violence) than shulde they neyther do well nor ryght wysely in that behalfe. Whan Iugurth had answered the embassadours after this maner: than sayd he for conclusion that shortly after he wold send embassadours to certify the senatours of all other thynges cōcernyng this busynes: and on this poynt Iugurth and the embassadours departed in sonder. Thus Adherball

had no confort nor lycence to reply agaynst the wordes of Iugurth / nor syght or cōmunicacion with the embassadours: all onely was it graunted vnto hym to appelle to ye court of Rome / for of these embassadours coude he haue / no iustice / nor dyreccion / in his iniuries and persecucion. Whan Iugurth thought that thembassadours were passed forth of Affrike / toward Rome / and whan he sawe yt with force of armes he coud nat wynne the towne of Cirtha / bycause of naturall sytuacion & difficulte of the place. Anone he besiged the towne agayn of newe and all difficultes nat withstādyng / he made a profounde & depe trench rounde about the towne with sharpe stakes & payles stycked on hyghest part of the same trenches with sharpe pykes on their vpper endꝭ. This dyde Iugurth for many cōsyderacions: first to thintent that the inhabitātes shuld nat breke forth of the towne sodenly at any syde vpon any part of his soudyours whiche besiged them. Secondly to thintent yt on no part any vitayles shulde be brought into them. Thirdly that the men of warre within the towne shuld nat thrust forth without ye towne the multitude of poore commens in tyme of famyne & scarcite of vitayls. And fourthly: that no socours shuld entre into them to rescue the towne nor to supply theyr garyson. Whan this trenche was made & fynisshed Iugurth moreouer made strong bulwarkes & towres of tymber without the towne / & strengthed the same with garyson of wyght & bolde men of armes. Bysyde all these ordinaūces he left nothynge vnassayed / nother spared he to attēpt euery thyng by strength nor by treason & gyle. Somtyme he proued ye watchmen & defenders of ye walles with gyftes excityng them to betray the towne. Whan his rewardes auayled nought than he thretned them with fiers & sharpe wordes: he inhaunced by exortacions the myndꝭ & courages of his owne men to manlynes & audacite. And so he aplyed his busynesse that nothyng he omytted wont or possible to be done in such a case / nor no ingyne of warre laft he vnprouided which ī those dayes was cōtriued or found: but rather besyde all old inuencyons he ymagined & deuysed newe ingynes & ordinaūces of warre nat sene before that tyme / and all for distruccion of the towne of Cirtha / and of Adherball whome he besyged within the same. But what tyme Adherball consydred his fortune come to extremite on all partꝭ / he kest many thyngꝭ in mynde. On the one syde he perceyued his ennemy Iugurth violent agaynst hym / and no trust of cōfort of socours. On the other syde he cōsydred well / that for penury & want of soudyours & other thynges necessary he was nat able nother to fyght with his ennemy / nor to dryue forth or prolong the batayle: and for

faute of vytayle he myght nat long defende the towne. These thynges with many mo well reuoulued in mynde / he chose forthe two which were most diligent and trusty of that company which had fled with hym into Cirtha. To them he wofully be wayled his misfortune: and made so large promysses of rewardes vnto them: that at last he induced them to go forthe of the towne by nyght priuely / and if they myght escape theyr ennemis / to resort to the next hauyn towne: and from thens to hast them to Rome with letters whiche he had deuised and written to be delyuerd to the senators. These messangers were trusty & faythfull / within fewe dayes without any dysturbance: they fulfylled the commaundement of theyr soueraygne / and delyuerd the letters of Adherball vnto the senatours. Which letters anone were redde in the counselhous before the senatours and rulers of Rome: of which letters the sentence hereafter insueth and was suche.

                        MOost worthy fathers it is nat througth my faute that I sende so often to you requiryng your socours / and cōplaynyng myne iniuryes: but the violence & rygour of Iugurth / cōpelleth me therto. Whose mynde is fylled with so great a lust and desyre to beraue my lyfe: yt neyther hath he in mynde the drede of goddes punysshmēt / nor fear of your displeasur. My blode he coueyteth more than all thynges: In somoche that nowe is the .v. moneth sith I am kept closed / & besiged wt armed men / by tyranny of Iugurth. He nothyng regardyng that I am cōfederate felowe & frende of the people of Rome. Neyther can preuayle nor helpe ye great benefites of my fader Micipsa done to this Iugurth / nor your authorite nor ordynaunces or decrees. I am vncertayn whyther I am constraned & oppressed more greuously by force of armes or by hunger / for bothe inuolueth me on all sydes / I wolde write vnto you moch more touchyng the tyrannous cruelte of Iugurth but my miserable fortune moueth me cōtrary: and moreouer I haue often ꝑceyued before this tyme: that small credence is gyuen to such as ar oppressed with misery: Saue this I perceyue clerely that the mynde of Iugurth coueyteth greater

thyng than my deth or kyngdome. And if by your sufferance: he shall subdue me and beraue me kyngdom / at last he shall ryse and rebell agaynst your empyre. Wherfore if ye lyst nat to defende & socour my lyfe: at leest: defende your kyngdome of Numidy / and preuent the vsurper of your empire. Suffre nat this tyran to enioye the kyngdome of Numidy / and your good wyll withal. But truely ye may well perceyue that he loketh nat after your fauour / after he shal haue vsurped the realme of Numidy. But whyder he setteth lesse by losse of your frenshyp and fauour / or of the dominion of Numidy: none is so blynde but that may euidently perceyue the trouth. For his dedes declare: that he counteth lesse greuous to haue your hygh displeasur / than to lose his fiers purpose to fle me / and than to ocupy the hole lande of Numidy. For this hath he proued and made manifest by his vnnaturall and cruell dedes: first of all he hath slayne my brother Hiempsall: which dede he durst nat haue done if he had feared your displeasur: next that: he droue me forth of my coūtrey and fathers kyngdome. But these iniuries for certayne / were done agaynst my brother and me / and nothyng they longed to you. But nowe he conspyreth hyer inuadyng / vsurpyng / and wastyng the hole lande of Numidy with force of armes. And where as ye set me as your lewtenant vnder you to gouerne a part of Numidy. This Iugurth nowe hath dryuen me from my liberte into the towne of Cirtha / and besegeth me with men of armes closed on all sydes with outwarde drede and inward famine: So that my peryls may playnly declare how lytell he setteth by the wordes of your embassadours. Certaynly I can se nothyng remaynyng able to remoue his violence / nor that can socour this my misery / saue onely your power and violence. I wolde ryght gladly: that these thynges whiche nowe I write to you / and all those thyngꝭ which I haue complayned before in the counselhouse were but fayned & false / rather than this my euident misery shulde proue them true & credible vnto you. But sith I was borne in that hour / and my desteny is such that Iugurth moost manifest his cursed cruelte by me / therfore now my request nor prayer is nat that I may escape the sharpnes and cruelte of miserable deth / whiche I beholde instant and ineuitable / but onely my prayer is that I may escape the long subieccion and bondage of my ennemy: and prolonged tourmentꝭ of my miserable body. But worthy fathers: touchyng the kyndome of Numidy / which apertayneth to you: prouide you for the same as it lyketh you / and if it be your pleasure: ryd and delyuer me from the cruell & vnmercyfull handes of Iugurth my mortall enmy for the honour

and mageste of your empyre / and for the fidelite of all frenshyp / yf any remembraunce of my grandfather Massinissa remayneth yet among you.

                        AFter these foresayde letters were openly red & recyted before ye senators: many of them wer: which coūsayled to send an army into Affrike / & in all hast cōuenient to socour & helpe Adherball. And in ye meane tyme they wold take counsell & aduise touching Iugurth what shuld be done to hym: bycause he had nat obeyed theyr embassadors. Whan the fauourers of Iugurth herd of this they laboured withall theyr myght: that no such decre shulde be made nor ꝓcede to effect. And thus ye cōmen wele was ouercome & subdued by pryuate profet & parciall fauour: as in many other busynesses is dayly wont to happen. Nat withstandyng this parcialite: at last it was so determined: that other new embassadors wer sent yet ones agayn into Affrike / nat yong men & inexpert as before: but well aged men of grauite and discression whiche were of great dignite: & had borne great & worshypfull offices ī tyme past in the cite of Rome. Amonge which embassadours was one named Marcus Emilius Scaurus / of whome we haue made mencion before. This Scaurus was a man by riches & fame coūted able to be coūsellour of Rome: and also at that tyme a myghty prince & great doer among the senators / & in maner ruler of them all. For asmoch as all men for the moost part were displeased wt Iugurth & sore murmured agaynst his cruelte & agaynst ye parciall fauour shewed to hym at Rome: & also for that ye messāgers of Iugurth besought the embassadors to hast them to Numidy / therfore ye third day after theyr cōmission they deꝑted from Italy / & toke shyppyng & in short tyme after aryued in Affrike / at a cite named Vtica in a prouince subiect to the romains. Assone as they were aryued they sende letters vnto Iugurth chargyng hym in all hast to cōme to the sayd prouince to knowe the pleasure of the senatours of Rome whiche had sende them thyder for the nonys with certen commaundementes dyrect vnto hym.

of al theyr counsels & busynesses. And howbeit at begynnyng this same Scaurus strongly resisted the party of Iugurth: what tyme many other of his sect were corrupt and accloyed wt bribes long before this: neuertheles now at last his mynde was abstract lyke other mo from the defence of goodnes and honesty vnto his olde vice of insaciable & execrable couetyse by meane of habundance of gold and great rewardes of Iugurth. But at first begynnyng this Iugurth redemed of Calphurnius / but onely delayng and deferryng of the warre: trustyng that in meane tyme he shuld brynge about somwhat of his purpose at Rome other by price / prayer / or fauour. But nowe after he had won Scaurus to be partiner of his busynes and fauourer of his cause also with Calphurnius: he was brought into a very great trust fully to recouer his peace at Rome: and concluded whyle both Calphurnius & Scaurus were there present togyder to take aduisemēt & treat presētly with them of all apoyntmēt & thyngꝭ necessary to be done for ꝑfourmyng of his purpose. Howbeit he trusted nat Calphurnius so moche that he wolde come to his army / except some hostagꝭ of the Romayns were left within some strong towne of his: & in warde of his people wherby he myght trust without dāmage sauely to be remitted agayn to his army. Calphurnius to auoyd this dougth of Iugurth & to put hym in more assurance send the treasourer of the Romayne army named Sextius / vnto one of the chefe townes belongyng to Iugurth called Vacca / faynyng amonge the army that he sent the sayd treasourer thyther for prouision of whete & other vitayls necessary to his hoost. And the same cōmaundement to prouyde vitayls the captayn Calphurnius gaue to his treasourer openly in cōmen audience: to thintēt that no man shuld suspect his false purpose: sayeng to his treasourer that hym neded nat to be in dout of Iugurth / for asmoch as trues were taken bytwene bothe parties tyll a certayn day prefixed. The treasourer Sextius went to the sayd cyte of Vacca at commaūdement of Calphurnius his captayne. Wherfore anone after Iugurth (lyke as he apoynted before) came to the army of Calphurnius / and there in presence of the rulers & counsell of the Romains / spake a lytell of his purgacion / concernyng the displeasure / enuy / & hatredde / whiche the senate and commens of Rome had taken agaynst hym for his dedes: sayeng that he had nought done but prouoked of his ennemies / and for his owne defence: with violence to resyst violence. Howe beit he sayd that he was cōtented to yelde & submit hym selfe vnto the Romayns clemence and mercy. Somoch spoke he openly before all the chefe coūsell of the army. But all the remenaunt

he concluded and dyd secretly with Calphurnius & Scaurus at more leasoure / and thus ended ye cōmunicacion of this day. On the next day after insuynge the captayne and the counsell of the army / & also Iugurth assembled togyder agayn to common of the same mater concernyng peace to be graūted to Iugurth. Nowe was it so that at Rome was decreed an ordinaunce long before this tyme named among the romayns the Satyre lawe / whiche lawe cōmaunded that the captayne of euery army shulde aske aduyse of all the wyse counsell of his hoost whan he went about any weythy mater cōcernyng the cōmen wele. Wherfore Colphurnius thought so to order hymselfe that he shulde nat be counted a brecare of this lawe: And desyred counsell & aduise of all the noble and wyse men of his hoost. This dyd he to thyntēt that if the peace graūted to Iugurth shulde be afterward dysalowed at Rome (as it was) he myght auoyde the faute from hymselfe into the cōmon coūsell. But at cōclusion / whan Calphurnius acordyng to the sayd lawe had requyred aduyse of the common coūsell: euery man cōsented that peace shulde be graunted to Iugurth: vpon cōdicion & cōuenaunt that he shulde delyuer vnto the romayns thertie Elyphantes with moche other catell and many horses with a great somme of golde. To which ordinaunce Iugurth acorded and soone after delyuered the same Elyphantes / catell / and horses & golde vnto the tresourer of the Romayne hoost. This done ye consull Calphurnius departed to Rome to requyre the senatours & other rulers to cōferme this peace & cōcorde which they had made with Iugurth. In meane tyme ouer all Numydy and also in the Romayne army was peace and cōcorde in abydyng the answere of the senate and rulers at Rome.

                        BVt after it was knowen at Rhome in what maner the consull had behaued hymselfe in Affrike with Iugurth: in euery place about Rome / and among euery company within Rome it was cōmyned of the dede of Calphurnius. In somoche that among the cōmenty was raysed greuous hatered & displeasure agaynst hym. The senators were sore troubled

& were in doute whyther they myght cōferme and alowe this foule and shamefull dede of the consull / or els abrogate and annull the same. In this perplexite they were longe tyme vncertayne: And moost of all the myght and power of Scaurus (bycause he was a doer and felowe with the consull in the sayd dede) let them frome discussyng of the ryght. But whyle the senatours in suche wyse prolonged the tyme. In this dubitacion Memmius (of whose condicions / promptnes of wytte / and hatered: whiche he had agaynst the power of the estates and noble men we haue written before) at dyuers tymes he assembled the cōmon people / exhortyng & inflamyng them to reuenge the cruelte of Iugurth / and parcialite of his fauourers / & warnyng them nat to forsake the defence of their cōmen wayle and libertie of theyr cite. He rehersed vnto them the pride / the cruelte / & manyfolde vnlawfull dedes of the senatours & of other estates at many tymes done to disworshyp and oppression of the cōmen wele. And vtterly at conclusion so he behaued hymselfe that he kyndled the myndes of the vniuersall cōmentie to resyst the parcialyte of the estates / and to se the cruelte of Iugurth extremely punysshed. But bycause the eloquence of this Memmius at that season was at Rome notable and moche set by / dyscrete & of great authorite: I haue intended of so many exhortacions as he had to the people: to cōmyt one to remembraunce by writynge: And specially before all other I wyll write that exhortacion which after returnyng of Calphurnius from Affrike the sayd Mēmius spake before the cōmen people in fourme folowynge.

So that in pardonyng of these inhumayne & cruell offences of Iugurth they haue polluted & betrayed the lawes bothe of god & man. And how beit that such is theyr demeanour it nothyng repenteth them: nor they be nought asshamedde therof.

Some of them count themselfe more assured bycause they haue slayne the protectours of the commentie to the intent that other may drede them so moche more: And other some of them in wrong examinacions & inquisions had agaynst you reioyse and count them selfe hardye & surer therby: And many other thynketh theyr defence and auauncement in murdring of you bostyng them selfe of the same: and thus howe moche wors that eche of them doth: the more sure he is & more sette by. In somoch that where they ought to fere you for theyr mysdedes: they transpose that feare vnto you / and cause you by your cowardyse to feare and drede them: whiche are conioyned all togyder agaynst you ī one maner desyre of yll / in one maner couetyse / in one hateredde of good / and in one maner fere of your auaūcemēt: but among good men to be all of one mynd vnder this maner one nat withstandynge an other it is to be counted for amyte and frendshyppe. Amonge yll men suche agreyng of maners is but a knotte of discorde and causeth sedycion / variaūce / and debate.

Than shulde nat ye laboure moche more withall your myght for conseruacion of the same lyberties whiche they haue left vnto you as hole as euer they had them: And specially for this cause ought ye to defende your priuileges for that it is more shame and rebuke to lese the priuilege and lybertie goten than neuer to haue optayned them: And specially what shame is it to you nothynge to augment nor encrease that authorite / whiche your elders & forefathers haue left to you: but to suffre ye same by your cowardyse by lytell and lytell to dekay: and at laste vtterly to be loste and come to nought?

But as for me nat withstādyng that I vnderstand the great offence and abhominable of this wycked Iugurth is suffred vnpunysshed: yet wolde I suffre paciently that ye shulde forgyue & pardon the wicked doers of this dede men most vngracious bycause they be citezins.

And specially cōtynuall busynes without ende shall remayne vnto you whā ye se playnly that outher ye must be seruaūtes or bondemen: or els ye must retaygne and defende your libertie by strength of your handes.

For their mynde is vtterly set to be lordes ouer you: and ye on the other part wyll nedes be fre and at liberte. They be extremely inclined and disposed to do wrong and iniury vnto you. And ye labour to withstande thē vtterly. And brefely to speke they take the frendes and felowes of our empire for ennemies. But our mortall ennemies they take for theyr felowes & frendes. But ye wolde withstande this cursed & vnkynde behauour. Wherfore can ye suppose that peace / loue / or frendshyppe can be among people so cōtrary of myndes & disposicion. For these cōsyderaciōs I warne & exhort you that ye suffre nat so great myschefe to escape vnpunysshed. This offence is nothynge lyke to the robbyng of the cōmon treasour / nor to ye spoylyng of money by extorcion frō the felowes & frendꝭ of our empire. Which dedes (howbeit they be greuous & in maner intollerable) neuertheles by custōe & vse of the same they ar reputed for small fautes & for nought. But this dede is moche more greuous and vtterly intollerable. For the authorite of the senate is betrayed to our most cruell and fiers ennemy Iugurth / your empire is falsly betrayed to other mennes handes and possession. The cōmen wele hath ben put to sale to Iugurth by ye senators bothe at home in our cite / and also in our army by Calphurnius the cōsull: Insomoch that if examinacion be nat made herof: and if they be nat punysshed which be culpable & fautie herin. What thyng shall remayne vnto vs but that we must passe our lyfe vnder obedience and bondage of them which thus haue done / and vs shall they kepe in subiection as yf they were kynges? For what thynge longeth to a kynge / saue to parfourme his wyll and pleasur / be it good or yll without any resystence or punysshment of any man. Do nat these estates thus wtout any cōtradiction / nat withstādyng that it is in your power to withstand thē if ye wyll. Nor certes worthy citezins I do nat thus exhorte you to coueyt rather that your citezins shulde do yll than well. But I speke to thintēt / that ye shulde nat so fauour & forbere a fewe iniust & yll disposed men: that the vtter distruction of all good men shuld procede of suche indiscrete fauour: And also namely in a cite or a cōmen wayle it is moch better and more tollerable to forgete the rewarde of good dedes / than the punysshment of yll dedꝭ. For a good man seynge his goodnes nat rewarded nor set by

he dothe but onely withdrawe his owne kyndnes: but an yll man nat punysshed / is the more bold & cursed: And moreouer if such as be mysdoers be punysshed / at the last theyr nombre shalbe abated & decresed / and if there be fewe vniust men / the lesse wrong is done. And he to whome no wronge is done nedeth nat to call for socour nor helpe. Thus it is better to leaue a good dede vnrewarded / than an yll dede vnpunysshed.

                           •
                        ereful of his part / and had no confidence in his cause for asmoche as he knewe hymselfe fauty in his owne conscience: yet Cassius aduysed hym and induced hym: bycause he had yelded hymselfe to come vnto Rome: without he wolde rather proue the Romayns strength and violence than theyr mercy and pyte: and moreouer the sayd Cassius promised also his owne fayth and trouth that if he wolde come to Rome and answere truly to all suche thynges as there shulde be demaunded of hym / he shulde safely go and come without any impediment. Cassius had so good a name at that tyme that Iugurth had asmoche cōfidence in his fayth & promes alone as in the promes or assurance of the hole cite. And so at last Iugurth cōsented to go to Rome with Cassius. Wherfore to enduce the romayns to the more pyte he arayed hymselfe in rude aparell agaynst his honour royall moche vyle and myserable: and so with Cassius came to Rome nat as a kyng / but poorly and with a small cō
                        pany. And nat withstandyng that his mynde was moche confermed / assured / and bolded: by the confort of them whiche he had corrupted with rewardes before / vnder whose defence & supportacion he had cōmytted so moche cruelty: yet he behaued hym so with his gyftes of newe assone as he was come to Rome / that by his great rewardꝭ be induced a lorde of Rome named Caius Bebius / one of the ꝓtectours of the cōmenty to be supporter & mayntener of his cause among the other mo▪
                        
By whose dishonest & vnmesurable couetise he trusted assuredly to be defended / agaynst lawe / from all punysshmentes due vnto his demerites. But the cōmenty of Rome was violently and sore wrathe agaynst Iugurth / some cōmaunded to haue hym to prison & there to kepe hym in bandes: And other some wolde that acordyng to the lawe punysshment of dethe shulde by taken of hym as of theyr mortall ennemy / if he wold nat shortly cōfesse & discouer the felowes / partiners / & supporters of his cruell dedes. Caius Mēmius heryng herof called togyder the cōmenty and alayed the mocyon & wrath of theyr myndes apeasyng theyr vnauysed rancour. And requirynge them to kepe the fayth & trouth of the cite (which they had promysed to Iugurthe) clere / inuiolate / and vndefyled. Thus dyd Memmius exhort them as he which more regarded & set more by the conseruacion of the dignite of Rome / than by the parfourmynge and satisfyeng the wrath & ire of the rude cō
                        mens. But whan sylence was made among all the assemble: anone Iugurth was brought forth before them all. Memmiꝰ than began to speke to hym demurely rehersyng and openly recountyng how he had corrupt the estates of Rome with his treasure / and cruelly agaynst ryght had done many abhomynable dedes at Rome / and also in Numidy agaynst the kyng Micipsa and his sonnes / as slayne Adherball and Hiempsall falsly dysceyued the kyng Micipsa: and wasted ye kyngdome of Numidy. And howebeit (sayd Memmius) that the Romayns knewe well his supporters yet they wold most of all that Iugurth shulde openly discouer & accuse them hymselfe. Wherfore he desyred hym truely to cōfesse the names of them by whose supportacion he was so bolde to cōmyt so many īmoderate & cruell dedes. Sayng that if he wold so do & cōfesse & disclose the trouth than myght he haue great trust and confydence in ye fauour / clemēce / and mercy of the people of Rome. But if he wold nat so do / he shulde do no profet by his sylence to the noble men of Rome which had supported him: And also he shulde be dystruction and vndoyng of hymselfe / and of his ryches also. On this poynt Memmiꝰ ceassed his wordes and helde hym styll. Anone Iugurth was cōmaūded of the commente to make answere. But whan he was reddy to haue spoken Caius Bebius whome he had corrupted with treasour (as I haue made mencion before) commaūded hym to hold his pease. In somoche that howebeit the people sore moued with displeasure put hym in feare with exclamacion agaynst hym with angry countenances▪ and often violently rennynge vpon hym / and with other tokens of yre and dyspleasure. Neuerthelesse for all this the frowarde counsell of Bebius

ouercame theyr thretnyng / insomoche that Iugurth wolde nothyng speke nor dysclose. And thus the people had in derision & abused / departed from the cōgregacion and assemble. So the myndes of Iugurthe / of Calphurnius / and of other theyr partyners were than inhansed & increased in boldnesse: whiche were troubled and moche ferefull before / whan Iugurth was first sende for and brought to be examined.

                        AT the same season was a gentleman at Rome named Massiua / borne of the countrey of Numidy / whiche was the son̄e of Galussa / & neuewe to ye good kyng Massinissa. This Massiua was agaynst Iugurth in the stryfe & discēcion bytwene Adherball & hym / whan the towne of Cirtha was yelded and Adherball slayne. Whefore he trusted nat Iugurth / but to saue hymselfe fled from Numidy vnto Rome. Nowe was a lorde at Rome named Albinus / whiche was creat consull with an other partyng felowe named Minucius / the next yere after Calphurnius. This Albinus came to Massiua and coūsayled hym (bycause he was of the stocke of Massinissa) to greue Iugurth / asmoch as he coude / with enuy / feare / and displeasure for his offences & cruelte: And by peticion to desyre of the senatours the administracion of the kyngdome of Numidy. Albinus gaue to hym this counsell / for asmoch as he hymselfe was desyrous of batayle. Wherfore he wold moch rather that euery thyng wer moued with trouble / than pacified or at rest. Than was a custome at Rome / that the consull shulde haue a partyng felow / & bytwene them the prouinces belongyng to Rome shulde be deuided. Thus in departyng of the prouinces / the coūtrey of Numidy fell to Albinus / and the countrey of Macidony to his felowe Minutius. Shortly after Massiua began to moue the mater to the senatours touchyng administracion of the kyngdome of Numidy. Iugurth hering of this had nat so great trust ī his mater nor to his frendes as he had before: For some of them with drewe theyr selfe for knowlege of theyr fautes / and other

some for feare of yll name and fame or rumour of the people. Wherfore Iugurth consyderyng this requyred Bomilchar / one of his most nere & trusty frendes to prouyde and to hyer by gyftes & rewardes a cōpany to sle the sayd Massiua / and that as priuely as coude be done. But if it coud nat priuely be done than to slee hym openly by one meane or other Bomilchar shortly went about the cōmaundement of Iugurth / and anone prouided men & hy

But afterwarde whan he sawe his tyme he prepared to execute this treason. Wherfore one of them which were ordayned & assigned to this murdre / assayled Massiua rasshely / with small prouisyon or auysement / & slewe hym vnware. But he whiche dyde the dede anone was taken & brought before the iudges. The people in great nombre desyred & at last cōstrayned hym to tell by whose coūsell he dyd that myscheuous dede / and specially Albinus the consull coarted hym therto. The murderer anone cōfessed the treuthe and declared howe he had done it at the instigacion & counsel of Bomilchar: And nat withstādyng that the same Bomilchar came to Rome / vnder the sauegarde & assurance of the fayth of the commente as dyd Iugurth / yet he was iudged gyltie of the dede / cōsideryng that he was coūselloure therto / and nat accordyng to the common lawe / but after very equite and good cōscience. But Iugurth cōsyderyng hymselfe culpable in the same faute / yet wolde by no meane confesse nor knowlege hymselfe fautie / tyll tyme that he vnderstode and sawe that the enuy and displeasure which was taken agaynst this dede passed all his fauoure and rewardes whiche he had gyuen at Rome / so yt at last in his gyftes he foūde no socoures nor ayde. But howebeit in the first accion or accusemēt which was layed agaynst hym / he had brought in & layd .l. suerties of his frendes for hym & all other of his retynue that he shuld purge hymselfe of euery thyng which was or shulde be layed agaynst hym / yet thought he better to prouide for the proteccion of his kyngdome than for the helth of his pledges or suerties. And this cōsydring he priuely sent Bomilchar away from Rome vnto Numidy / dredynge that if condyng and worthy punysshement were taken of Bomylchar at Rome / le

And anone after Bomilchar was departed Iugurth hymselfe fledde also from Rome after hym commaunded of the senatours to depart from Italy as ennemy to the romayns & theyr empyre. But whan he was departed

                        IN the same season was the commen wayle at Rome moche troubled with variaunce and debate / betwene the protectours of the commentie. For of them one named Lucullus and an other Annius laboured to contynue and kepe styll their office and agaynst the ordynaunce of the lawe to contynue more than one yere. Wherfore the other whiche were ꝑtyngfelowes ī office with them laboured with all their myght the contrary to resyst them and to mayntayne the olde constitucion / ordynaunce and custome. This dyscencion and debate letted the election of the newe consuls all that yere. Aulus whom Albinus had left with the army in Numidy as his lewtenant herd of this prolongyng of the tyme & was brought in great hope to wynne great honour or treasour. Wherfore in the cold moneth of Ianuary he called the soudyours forth of theyr tentes to execute the batayle with Iugurth without more delay. Outher dyde he thus shortly to make an ende of the batayle in his tyme / and therby to wynne honoure or els with his army to put Iugurth in feare (so that to haue peace) he shulde redeme the same of Aulus with great treasoure. Aulus concludynge on this purpose / spedde hym so fast with his soudyours makyng dayly great iournayes (nat withstā
                        dyng the sharpnesse of wynter) that at last he came to a towne in Numidy / named Suthull: in whiche towne the treasours of Iugurth were layed. This towne with walles / waters / and moūtaygnes of nature was strongly defended: for without the walles buylded on the heyght of a mountaygne broken on the forefronte was a great playne fenne / or marrayse grounde: all ouercouered with mudde / and standyng wynter water. Insomoche that what for the sharpnesse of the wynter season: and what for naturall defence of the place / this towne coude by no meanes bewell besyged nor taken: yet this nat wt
                        standyng

Aulus to encrease fere to Iugurth / and for the blynde desyre which he had to wynne the towne in maner of dissimulacion assayled the same and made pauayses about the walles of sheldes conioyned lyke vynes / wherunder his men myght fyght with lesse dammage or paryll. Than made he a dyche or trenche rounde about the towne with great hepes of erth casten vpon the sydes of the same / to the entent that no socours shulde entre into them / nor they escape forth at theyr pleasurs. And finally he made redy euery thynge whiche belonged or was necessary to besegyng of suche a towne. But Iugurth anone perceyued the vayne and folysshe behauoure of Aulus / and craftely encreased by polycy the madnes of hym / sending often embassadours vnto hym to requyre in derysion that he wolde desyst and leue besyginge of the towne / and intreatyng hym of peace mekely. But in the meane tyme Iugurth hymselfe in maner as yf he wold nat intermell with Aulus / ledde his army by wodes / forestes / by streat passages / by hyls & dales / and by bacways: causynge Aulus to suspect that he was a dradde of hym: And finally he enduced Aulus to truste after some apointement. And thus Iugurth with his men fleyng alway into desertes and hydde places gaue confort to Aulus and encreased his corage by such auoyding. Insomoch that at last Aulus gaue vp the segyng of the towne of Suthull: And with his hole power hastely pursued Iugurth as fleynge from hym for drede into places vnknowen to hym and his men. Thus was the treason of Iugurth more hydde from Aulus / wherfore he made the lesse prouision therfore. In the meane season Iugurth by subtyll messangers attempted the romayne army day and nyght inducyng them to consent to betray theyr felowes / the capytayns / and vndercaptayns: anone for lucre consented to hym. Some in tyme of batayle to forsake and betray theyr owne company and to fyght on the part of Iugurth. And other whiche wolde nat graūt to so foule a dede / as to fyght agaynst theyr owne company / he exhorted and induced them whan the trumpettes shulde blowe to batayle to leue theyr places & array: And depart from theyr company without stroke on one syde or other. Whan euery thynge was brought to his purpose and accorded to his requestes: Than about mydnyght he stale priuely towarde the tentes of the romayns: and sodenly with a great company of Numidyans / compassed them about on euery syde and assayled them fiersly. The romayne soudyours whiche were with Aulus / thus vnwarly inuaded: were meruelously abasshed and amased / for ye vnwont & sodayn feare of this treason. Some of the most noble hertes: with great

courage drewe to them theyr harnes / and resysted theyr ennemies valyantly: fully assured and prefyxed to dye lyke men: yf fortune shulde graunt them none other meanes to escape that instant danger. Some other as cowardes hydde themselfe in caues & other secrete places / yf they myght any fynde. The boldest and most vsed to suche chaunces conforted theyr felowes whiche were ferefull and vnexpert of suche chaunces of warre. Howbeit none of them all was so bolde nor so well assured of hymselfe / but that he was bothe in great drede and danger. And no maruayle / for in euery place and on all sydes about them they were inuironed in compasse with great violence & plentious nombre of theyr ennemies hyd vnder darknes of the nyght and cloudes which vtterly obscured the sterres lyght. Theyr paryll was indiferēt and doutfull whyther they fled or abode the batayle. For deth was instant and depended ouer theyr hedes euery way: and other hope nor esperaūce was none / saue deth ineuitable. So that finally it was vncertayne vnto them whether it was better ormore sure to fle or to abyde to theyr auēture. But of that company wihich Iugurth had corrupted with rewardes as we haue sayd before one bende or cohort of lombardes and tow turmes that is to say .lx. thraciens and a fewe rude and cōmen soudyours betrayed the romayns and went ouer to Iugurth. Also the Centurion whiche was assigned to be captayne ouer them / whiche were cōmytted to fyght about the first standard of the thyrd legion drewe hym and his company asyde and suffred theyr ennemies to entre into the myddes of the hoost on that syde which they had taken to defend. Thus all ye Numidyēs brake in on that syde without any resystence. And at conclusion the romayns had a foule flyght and a shamefull disconfiture / insomoche that they trusted more to theyr fete than to theyr handes or armour: And many of them to ren lyghter / thrue away theyr armour and harnes / and toke the top of an hyll whiche was nere therby and ther taryed. The company of Iugurth / what for spoylinge of the romayns tentes and darknes of the nyght had les honour of victorie and suffred many of the romayns to escape. On the next day after Iugurth and Aulus came to cōmunication togyder. Than sayd Iugurth to Aulus that nat withstandyng that he had hym & his army which were letf alyue sure ynough cōpassed and enuyroned with wepen & hunger so that they coude nat escape hym: and howebeit it was in his power to oppres hym & all his. Neuertheles he remembred well ynough the incertayn chances of mannes busynesse & wold nat be to hym cruell nor vncurres so that he wolde make wt hym a bonde of peas and

no more contend agaynst hym in batayle / on this condicion / that all the soudyours of Aulus shulde do obesance vnto hym and passe vnder a spere in token of subiectyon and so without more damage depart out of the countrey of Numidy within the space of .x. dayes next after. But howbeit this composicion and condicions were hard / greuous / and full of shame & misery: and worthy to be punysshed of the senatours yf Aulus agreed to them. Neuerthelesse theyr myndes so wauered for drede of deth that at last the composicion & agrement was concluded & agreed at the wyll & pleasure of Iugurth vpon the sayd condicions.

But namely they which had ben good warryours in their dayes were displeased with hym most of all: whan they cōsydred that he beyng armed & well apointed to batayle rather sought meanes to escape from deth by suche shamefull & bonde cōposicion than manly abyding the ex

But the cōsull Albinus / hymselfe dreded sore for this thyngꝭ cōsydring that for his brothers faute in tyme to cōe he shuld nat auoyde the displeasure of the senatours & cōmens of Rome. For as he coniectured all his brothers dedes shuld redoūde to his dishonour & paryll / bycause he had lymitted hym in Numidy in his sted to be captayne of the army in his absēce. Wherfore (these thynges duely aduysed) he went to the senators desyringe them to take counsell & aduisemēt whyther they wolde approbate and allowe the sayd cōposicion bytwene his brother Aulus & Iugurth: or els nat. But he knewe ryght well that the senatours wolde nat cōferme the same. Wherfore (in meane tyme whyle they wer coūselling) he elect soudyors for supplimēt to fulffyll

and parforme agayne the army whiche was in Affrike / and sore diminisshed. For many of them were slayne by Iugurth and his company. Wherfore Albinus raysed vp socours of such as were nere to the costes of Rome / and frendes to thempire: as Latinians and Italians with other naciōs. Of these he raysed as many as he myght / and assembled them togyder by all meanes whiche he coude deuyse to fournysshe and augmente his army. At conclusion the senatours decreed in their counsell that no bonde of peace nor composicion myght be cō
                        firmed without their consent and without the aduyse & commaundement of the cōmen people also: as ryght and reason requyred. And thus was the sayd cōposicion of Aulus abrogate / as thyng presumed without consent or cōmaundement of the senatours or commens. But whan the consull Albinus had ordayned and prepared supplement of his army (as sayd is) he was prohybet and letted by the protectours of the cō
                        menty: Insomoche that he was nat suffred by them to conuey suche company as he had raysed into Affrike / with hym as he intended to repayre and tornysshe the army whiche there remayned. Wherfore he spedde hymselfe forth into Affrike disapoynted of his purpose with a small company of men / of his owne retynue. The army of the romayns whiche he before had cōmytted to Aulus his brother: accordyng to the opoyntment with Iugurth / was departed forth of Numidy. And to pasforth the wynter / taryed in a prouince of Affrike whiche was subget to thempire of Rome. Whan Albinus the consull was arryued & come thyder: his mynde ardently was kyndled with desyre to pursue: Iugurth / and to remedy the yl wy

Neuertheles whan he knewe the maners and yll behauour of the soudyours: of whome some were fled treyterously to Iugurth (as is sayd before) & some by sufferaunce of theyr captayne were infected and corrupted with ouermoch pleasure / dissolute liberty / and voluptuous lyuing: this consydring he concluded (as the case requyred) to do nothyng for a season: and to attempte no maistry: but to passe forth the wynter with his army without remouynge or puttyng hymselfe in ieopardy or paryll.
                     ¶In the meane season whyle Albinus and his army soiourned in the ꝓuince of Affrike tyll the wynter were ouerpassed. At Rome was one named Caius Manlius elect and lymitted proiectour of the cōmen people whiche anone after he was se

                         nought the

ordinaūces decreed of the senatours. And agaynst them whiche had restored agayne to Iugurth the elyphantes whiche Iugurth had delyuerd to Calphurnius at the first composicion and apoyntment whiche was made with hym. And also agaynst them whiche had receyued any money or other rewardꝭ of Iugurth whyle they were embassadors or captains of armies ayenst hym: send forth by the romayns. And finally the same inquisicion also was extended agaynst all such as had made any pactions / apoyntmentes / or promises of peace or of warre with ennemies of thempire without generall cō
                        sent of the senatours or commens.
                     ¶Whan this inquire was moued: many of the senatours & noble men of Rome knewe themselfe culpable in the forsayd articles. And other some douted sore of paryls for to come bycause of the ylwyll & malyce whiche the partie of the cōmens confederat had agaynst them. Wherfore syth the same noble men myght nat well resyst the examinacion of these articles openly: but of necessite they must agre therto: other els knowlege themselfe (by their resystence) gylte in the same: therfore they prepared impedimēt priuely agaynst suche inquisicions by theyr frendꝭ: but specially by ye felowes of thempire whiche were cōfederate with the romayns / as Italyans & Latiniās. The princes of these nacions & suche other lyke gaue counsell to the senatours whiche were nat fauty in the premysses / and also to the cōmenty: that in suche a troublous / besy / and peryllous season no suche examinacions shulde be made nor procede forwarde to effect: for drede of many inconueniences which of the same myght ryse bytwene the noble men & the cōmens. But (this nat withstandyng) it is a merueylous thyng and in maner incredible to speke of: how besy and diligent the commens were to haue the same inquisicion to procede / and to be brought to effect: and that rather for hatered whiche they had agaynst the noble men (agaynst whome the sayd inquisicion was ordayned) thā for any good wyll or fauour / whiche they had to the cōmen wele. So great pleasure & desyre of variāce was among them. Wherfore whyle the remenant of the noble men were sore troubled with fere and drede. Marcus Scaurus which was before sent into Affrike with Calphurniꝰ (as I haue sayd) prouided for hymselfe in crafty maner as I shall nowe declare. Whyle the cōmenty was mery & ioyeous of this examinacion & many of the company of Scaurus that knew themselfe fauty fled for feare. And the hole cite was in moche drede and Manlius obtayned his peticion & wyll of the commenty. In somoche that anone were ordayned thre noble men cōmissioners to examine the thre articles before rehersed and

here insuyng of whom the first was of them which counselled Iugurth to dispise the decreis of the senatours and that toke money or rewardes of hym. The seconde was of them that solde agayn to Iugurth the forsayd elyphantes and the Numidiens that left Iugurth commynge on the romayns syde. And the thyrde examinacion was of them whiche had made any apointement of peace or warre with the ennemies of Rome as was Iugurth. But nat withstandynge that Calphurnius was culpable in the same asmoche as any other of the noble men. Neuerthelesse he shyfted so for hymselfe that he was electe to be one of the examinours or commyssioners to make inquisicion of these thre poyntes rehersed. The inquisicion proceded to effecte and was handled and put in execucion with moche violence and sharpely after the commen rumour and pleasure of the cōmenty. Thus the people seynge theyr pleasure fulfylled / at that tyme began to be proude and statly therof in lykewyse as the estates had ben in foretyme of theyr power and lordshyp. But here wyll I make a small dygression fro my purpose & tell wherof this variance & discord bytwene the cōmens and noble men first proceded.
                  
                  
                     ¶wherof the dyscorde and takyng of parties bytwene the noble men and cōmens of Rome / had fyrst begynnyng. ¶The .xxvii. chapyter.
                     
                        THis maner of deuisyon of the commente from the estates of Rome: This discorde & takyng of parties bytwene them: & this inordinate custom of all other incōuenyences / began among thē but a fewe yeres before this tyme by meane of ouer moche rest ad ydlenes: by superfluous habundance of richesse / voluptuosite / and of other worldely delectacions: whiche many counte & repute for most chiefe pleasures of this lyfe. For before the dystruction of Carthage / the senatours and cōmenty of Rome treated and gouerned the cōmenwele bytwene them peasably in loue and concorde. So that among the citezins was no stryfe nor debate / for laude / excellence / for dignite / nor for great dominion. The drede whiche they had of their ennemis made them warre and kept them in good maners causyng them to gouerne their cite with good & vertues institutes / without variance / without robbery / without oppression / without slaughter nor other lyke cruell tyrannies. But whan Carthage was ouercome anone was expulsed

fere from theyr myndes: and voluptuosite / wantonnes / & pride (which ar greatly loued in welth and prosperite) anone entred their myndes: so that they desyred peace whā they had warre. But whā the warre was ended: & that they had peace and ydlenes after theyr owne desyre: theyr peace and rest was more sharpe / more bytter / more intollerable / and more perillous to them thā the warre was before. For the estates began to tourne theyr dignite & worshyp / into immoderate affection of great lordshyppe and dominacion. And the cōmen people began to tourne theyr libertie into lust and pleasure. Euery man prouyded and drewe to hymselfe robbynge & reauynge without measure / from the cōmen wele. Thus was the commentie abstract & deuyded from the lordes. So was the cite deuyded into two partes. And the cōmen wele which was in ye myddes bytwene thē on euery syde was pylled / robbed / & vtterly wasted of them both: on both sydes. But the power of the noble men and of theyr party was more myghty than the power of ye cōmens. For all the estates were all togyder assembled / conioyned / & vnyed. But the cōmens were dispersed and spredde abrode into dyuerse places and companyes gettynge theyr lyueng with labour of theyr handes & swet of theyr bodyes. So euerythyng was gouerned in peace and in warre at pleasure & aduyse of a fewe priuate noble men. The cōmen treasoure / the prouynces / maistershyppes / offices / tributes / worshyppe / tryumphes / and all other thynges longyng to honour or auātage were onely in handꝭ & possession of the same fewe noble men. But the simple cōmen people was weryed & oppressed with pouerty / with batayle / and warfare. Euer in ieopardy / and neuer in auantage nor lucre. For the captayns with a fewe other noble men pulled suche prayes as were taken in batayle onely to theyr singuler auantage and behofe. But in the meane season the parentes & small chyldren of the soudyors were dryuen from their dwellyng places & possessions by the sayd noble men: echone of them by that lorde vnto whom they dwelled nerest. And so the myght & power of such noble men cōioyned with immoderate couetyse assayled / defyled / wasted / and dystroyed euery thyng without good maner without measure or moderacion: hauyng no respect nor cōsyderacion of any thyng belongyng to goodnes or vertue: tyll they had so farforth proceded that at conclusion they were dystroyed & ouerthrowen by theyr owne obstinate pride & tyranny. But at last assone as euersome of the estates were foūde whiche remembryng and consydryng themselfe: set more by true and laudable glory / than by iniust power and dignite. And were moued in myndes by compassion to shewe mercy &

pyte agaynst the cōmente and to socour their misery than began the cite to be troubled and moued greuously for the courage of the cōmens was reuyued by supportacion of such noble men: by meanes wherof discorde and deuysion began to ryse in the cite / as it were drye dust of the grounde raysed in a great & tempestyous wynde. For after that Tiberius Gracchus / & Caius Gracchus (whose progenitours moch encreased the cōmen wayle in many batayls / but namely in the batayle of Carthage) began to restore the commētie into theyr olde libertie / and to detect the cruell mysdedes of the fewe iniurious estates. Than all the lordes cōfederate: and after maner chafed with yre assembled theyr felowes / as Latynians and some knyghtes of Rome / which in hope of ꝓmocion left the cōmens party and helde with the noble men. All these with suche as were to them lenyng of other nacions began to withstande the accusemētes of both the sayd Gaccus / whiche were fauourers of the cōmenty: & first of all they slewe Tiberius Graccus. And after that within a fewe yeres they slewe the other brother named Caius Graccus / whyle he was ꝓtectour of the cōmenty: bycause that he acordyng to lawe & right deuided among the poore cōmente such landꝭ as they had won in batayle of theyr ennemies. And at the same season the estates put to deth also a lorde named Marcus Faccus / bycause he defended the cōmens liberte agaynst theyr extorcion. But touchyng the two brethern Tiberius / and Caius Graccus: sothly their myndes were greatly immoderate and vnmesurable in theyr desyre to ouercome the states. Neuerthelesse it had be moche better to the states to haue suffred them in theyr ryghtwyse tytell / & somwhat to haue inclyned to theyr myndes than to haue ouercome them so violently and slayne them so iniuryously / how beit that they were ouer hasty & besy. But whan the states had the victory of them after their desyre & pleasure than put they to deth the cōmenty without nombre / and many they exiled & droue out of the cite. In somoch that frō thens forth they rather encreased theyr crueltie and feare to the commens / than their owne honoure or power. By which meanes many worthy citees haue often tymes ben dystroyed whyle the estates and commens contende the one / to ouercome the other / by one meane or other. And whyle the party vyctoure wyll punysshe ouer greuously that party which is ouercome. But yf I wold prepare to write of the besynesse and dedes of both the parties seriatly & dystincly. And yf I shulde touche all the maners of the cite acordyng to the gretnesse of the mater and as it requyreth: othely the tyme shuld fayle me rather than the mater. Wherfore I wyll omyt this superfluous and

infenite besynes / and retourne to my first mater and purpose touchyng this cronycle of this tyranne Iugurth.

                        AFter the truse and composicion of Aulus before sayde made with Iugurth / & the foule & shamkfull flyght of the romayne army: Quintus Metellus / and Marcus Sillanus / were creat & proclamed consuls of Rome / whiche acordyng to the olde custome parted & deuyded the prouynces belongyng to Rome bytwene them bothe. The countrey of Numidy fell and happened to Metellus. This Metellus was a fierse man and a noble & a worthy warryour. And howbeit he fauoured the party of the noble men and was cōtrary to the party of the cōmens: neuertheles he was of fame vndefyled & vnuiolat / and coūted of good name indifferētly on both parties. Assone as euer this Metellus entred in his office & dignite / he thought that euery thyng apartayning to his rowm & charge belōged aswell to his partyng felowe as to hymselfe / saue the warre of Numidy: whiche onely belonged to hymselfe & to his ꝑticuler charge: Wherfore he cōmytted all other charges to Sillanus / and onely sette his mynd to make prouysion for ye warre agaynst Iugurth. But bycause he mistrusted the olde army whiche was in Numidy with Albinus & Aulus / and had no cōfydence in the myndes of these soudyors corrupted with ydelnes & many other vices: therfore he elected and assembled newe soudyours. And of all suche as were felowes & frendes confederate to the Romayns / he called for helpe & socours. He prepared & made redy armoure / wepyn / horse harnes / and all other ordynaunce expediēt to warfare. And also he ordayned abundaūce of vytayls. And shortly to speke all thyngꝭ he ordayned which ar wont to be necessary & profitable to the variable chaunces & incertayne accidentes / and ieopardies of warre / which requyreth reparacion of many thynges & chargeable. But suche as were felowes of the empire of Rome at instaūce & request of the senatours: and by theyr authorite and by the Latinians & many other strange kynges of theyr owne frewyll sent socours to Metellus to auaunce hym in his enterpryse: And shortly to speke the hole

cytie laboured withall theyr myght to socoure and ayde Metellus in his besynesse. Thus at last whan euery thynge was prouyded and sette in order after his pleasure & intent: than toke he his iournay into Numidy / with great hope of all the cytezins of Rome that for his good maners: and specially for that his mynde was vnouercōe with rychesse or coueryse that he shuld do more honoure to the empire than his predecessors had in the warre of Numidy. For before his departynge the welth of Numidy (by coueryse of the officers of Rome) was augmēted: but the welth of the Romayns wasted and deminisshed. Whan Metellus was come to Affrike / the army was delyuered vnto hym by Albinus: which army was vncrafty / sluggysshe / & feble nouther able to endure paryll nor labour / of tunge more redy / fiers / and hardy than of hande: whiche was wont to robbe / and pyll from felowes and frendes of the empire. But it selfe endured by cowardise to be robbed and spoyled of ennemies of the empyre / as a lawlesse & dysordred cōpany of men vngouerned & without authorite or maners. Wherfore Metellus the newe capytayne hadde moche more thought & besynesse / for suche corrupt & vicious maners of a company so farre out of order / than he hadde helpe or good hope of confort in the multitude of them. Thus howe beit he sawe the tyme of election of newe cōsuls drawe nere. And all yf he also vnderstode that the Romayns dayly loked after some ende of the warre. These causes nat withstandyng yet he cōcluded / nat to begyn the warre tyll he had excercysed and vsed the soudyors with besynesse & labour aft the instruction and custome of olde captayns / vsed before his tyme. For why Albinus was so astonyed with the aduersite & myschaunce of his brother Aulus and for murdre of his hoost: that after he purposed nat to depart out of the romayns prouince whiche was in Affrike / he kept the soudyors alway ydell in theyr tentes as longe as the somer season lasted & as long as he was in authorite in somoche that they chaunged no place except the corrupt sauoure of the place / or els necessite of vitayle cōstrayned them to remoue. Nor accordyng to the custome & maner of warryours amonge them was no watche: but euery man came & went at his owne pleasure / and absented thēselfe from theyr standardes whan it lyked them. The scolyons & pages wandred day & nyght mengled among the horsemen & chiefe of the soudyours without any order: And many other as rouers dyspersed abrode destroyed the countrey / fyghtynge agaynst the small villages / & nat agaynst citees nor townes. They caryed away from the sayd villages prayes of catell: and the inhabitātes ledde away also with them as prisoners

with other prayes stryuyng togyder who myght haue most / and than after chaunged the sayde roberies with marchauntes for delycious & strong wynes caryed from other strange countreis / where better wyne grewe than in that coūtrey: and for other suche delycious thyngꝭ. They solde away the where and other vitayles which was delyuered of theyr capytayns among them in cōmen & dayly they bought theyr bread. And finally what euer shame or rebuke longyng to couetyse or lechery: coude outher be sayd / done / or ymagined of any man: all was vsed in that hoost. And among some: more shamefull dedes than ought to be named. But Metellus hehaued hym selfe as a myghty & wyse man / nat lesse this difficultie & hardnesse / than if it had ben in a batayle foughtē agaynst his ennē
                        mies as he which in myddes of so great couetyse / voluptuesite / & cruelty was syngulerly indued with tēperaunce: & merueylous good maner vsed he / in coartynge the same fautes. Wherfore at the first begynnynge he withdrewe & auoyded from the army at his commaundemēt & ordinaunce: the occasyons which styred the soudyours to suche slouth / cowardyse / and voluptuosite. For he commaunded vnder great payne that no person shulde be so hardy to sell among the soudyours nouther bread nor other vitayle all reddy dressed saue the cō
                        men ꝓuisyon: that the pages / waterlaggers & scolyons shuld nat cōe nere the army / nor folowe the same. That none of the cōmen & simple sodyours shulde kepe or mentayne seruaunt nor beest in theyr tentes nor vyage / whyle they moued fro place to place. These inconuenyences first of all he redressed & refourmed. After these amended: all other fautes he mesured by his wysdome / craft / and policy: refourmynge them by lytell & lytell. This done (to haue his soudyours occupyed) he moued dayly from place to place: and that nat in wayes cōmen & vsed / but by harde and vnoccupyed wayes. He caused them dayly to cast dychesse & trenches about the army / to the intent that they shuld nat waxe slouthfull / nor vicious by ouermoch rest & ydlenesse. He ordayned often watche among them euery nyght: and he hymselfe acompanyed with his vnder captayns and heed officers often serched yf the watches were truely kept / cōpassyng about the army on euery syde. Whyle they remoued & chaunged places: somtyme he was in the forwarde and amonge the first: somtyme in the rerewarde or hynder part / and anone in the myddes ouerseynge theyr order to the intent that none shulde passe out of order / aray / and place to them assigned. But kepe thicke togyder euery man & cōpany about theyr owne standerdꝭ: and also he ordayned that among themselfe they shulde conuey & cary theyr owne vitayles and

armoure. And thus in short tyme he confermed and sette the army in good order rather with fayre wordes / or rebukyng & blamyng theyr fautes: & prohybityng their dysorder: than in chastisyng or punysshyng their offēces wt rygour or crueltie.
                  
                  
                     ¶Of the behauour of Iugurth agaynst Metellus: and howe he sende embassadours to Metellus requyring vnfaynedly to yelde vp the kyngdome of Numidy to the empyre of Rome: And howe Metellus behaued hymselfe agaynst the same embassadours. ¶The .xxix. chapyter.
                     
                        IN the meane seasō whan Iugurthe vnderstode by messangers & espyes of this behauour of Metellus: and also whā he remembred that which was infourmed to hym at Rome of the integryte and vndefyled name of Metellus / whiche wolde nat be corrupte with money nor accloyed with brybes lyke other before: he began to mystruste his matters and to haue lasse confydence in his cause / thanne euer he had before. In somoche that than he began to laboure to yelde hymselfe vnfaynedly / and to make a trewe composytion with Metellus / and the Romayns without any fyction / gyle / or disceyt. Wherfore he sende embassadours with supplicacions & peticions / requyring humbly of Metellus to graunt to hym his owne lyfe: and the lyfe of his chyldren onely: and concernyng all other thyngꝭ he wolde yelde them into handes of the romayns. But Metellus knewe well ynough long before this tyme by often experience & profe yt the Numidians of naturall disposicion were vnfaythfull / mouable / and vnstable of myndes: newfangled and moche desyrous of newe besynesse & newelties. Wherfore he began with the embassadours of Iugurth / tastyng and prouyng the mynde of eche of them / by lytell and lytell: and separatly one by one. And whan he knewe that they somwhat inclined to his purpose: he than promysed to them great gyftes & promocion so that they wold do some pleasure for hym & for the senatours & people of Rome. Than at last he counsayled and desyred them to delyuer Iugurth to hym alyue specially if it myght be brought about: and yf they coude nat so / than to delyuer hym outher quicke or deed. But whan he had made this apoyntement secretly with thembassadours deuyded in sonder one by one: than

openly (that euery man myght here) he shewed to them all togyder other thynges as his pleasure was that they shuld certyfie their kynge Iugurth concernynge their embassade. After this within fewe dayes whan he sawe his hoost moost redy and contrary to Iugurth he remoued his tentes and so addressed hym with his army redy in aray and went forward into Numidy: where contrary to any similitude of warre the vyllages and cotages were full of men / the feldes full of beestꝭ and tylmen: and euery where was moche plenty of people yonge and olde namely rude people & tyllers of the grounde / whiche had styll fled before the army in foretyme for feare / but at the last whan they sawe no defence nor socoure / the kynges lewtenantes and all other left their townes / villages / and lodges / and went forthe to mete Metellus withall humilite / honour / and seruice submittyng themselfe to hym / and redy to gyue to hym whete and other corne suche as they had. And to cary vitayles after his hoost to ease the soudyours and to do and parfourme all other thynges what euer they were commaunded. But for all this: Metellus was nat lesse diligent nor circumspect in orderyng of his hoost / but proceded forwarde togyder with his army ī aray redy in armoure / and defended as if theyr ennemies had ben nere at hande serchynge the countrey abrode on euery syde by his espyes doutynge treason and thynkyng that all these tokens of subiection were but for a face or cloke to couer the treason & gyle of Iugurth. And so by suche dyscet to wayt a tyme to execute his treason. Wherfore Metellus thus mysdemynge kept hymselfe in the forwarde of the hoost with an elect and chosen company of archers / slyngers / and other lyke soudyours apoynted in lyght harnes. His vnder captayne Caius Marius had rule and charge of the rerewarde amonge the horsmen and on bothe the wynges of his hoost he ordayned horsmen & other soudyours for supplement / subsidy / and socouts of the forwarde yf nede shulde requyre / and amonge them to expell their ennemies on what syde so euer they shulde come / were mengled bowmen and other lyght harnysed fotemen with dartes / pykes / and iauelyns to trouble the horsmen of theyr ennemies. For in Iugurth was so moche gyle so great experience and knowledge of the countrey / and also so great practyse of chyualrie: that a man coude nat well knowe whether he were more to be douted or more greuous in peace or ī ware or whyle he was absent or present.
                     ¶Nat farre from that way whiche Metellus helde with his army was a towne of the Numidyans moche acustomed and frequented of marchantes of Italy and other strange countreis:

and the princypall market towne of all the kyngdome of Numidy. This towne was named Vacca / Metellus drewe hym and his army thyder / and set garnyson into the same towne. This dyd he to proue the myndes of the inhabytantes: for if they had kept forth the garnyson / thanne shulde they euydently haue declared themselfe ennemies of the romayns. And also he ledde a garnyson thyder to thintent to haue taken the towne by force of armes / yf the inhabytauntes wolde nat haue admytted the same garnyson. Also he commaunded vytayls / and all other thynges necessary or expedyent to warre for to be brought thyder thinkynge (as the case required) that the concours of marchantes resortyng thyder. And his good prouision of vytayls shulde be great defence and conseruacyon for hym and his army bothe in warre and in peace. But whan the citezins sawe such purueyance as he made of vitels considring that he shulde nat hurt nor disprouyde them whyle he had vytell ynough of his owne prouysion: anon they opened the gates and suffred hym to entre withall his garnyson and retynue. But in the mean tyme Iugurth agayne sende his embassadours to Metellus more diligently and instaūtly than he had done before / mekely besechyng and requyring hym of peace: And yeldyng vnto hym euery thynge / onely reserued his owne lyfe: and the lyfe of his chyldren. Metellus sende these embassadours home agayne attysed to the prodycion of their maister Iugurth as he had done to the other embassadours which were sent before. But concernyng ye peace which they desyred in their maisters name: nouther he graū
                        ted nor vtterly denyed it. And in this prolongynge of tyme he loked alway after parfourmynge of the promesse of the other embassadours / whiche before had graunted to the betrayeng of Iugurth. But whan Iugurth consydred and pondered togyder the wordes & dedes of Metellus / and whan he parceyued in mynde himselfe assayled with his owne craftes of subtylte: and that Metellus vsed suche craftes agaynst hym / as he hymselfe had vsed agaynst other: than was his mynd greued most of all. For Metellus fayned peace / but in very dede he shewed sharpe warre. Iugurth thus cōsydred also: that his greattest towne named Vacca / was alienate & lost from hym: his ennemies by longe continuaunce and exercise knewe the coostes of his countrey of Numidy. The myndes of his lordes and cōmens were prouoked and moued agaynst hym. Whan he aduysed these difficulties with other mo cōtrary to hym he cōcluded & fully determined at last to resyst and withstane Metellus in batayle / with strength & force of armes and no farther to meke nor submitte hymselfe by peticion.

                        WHerfore Iugurth thus determyninge to assayle Metellus cause his wayes to be espyed / hauyng hope of victorie by auauncement & auauntage of some place: where he intended of the place and countrey: and anone prepared the greattest army yt he coude of all sortes of people. This done / he dyd so moche that by hylles / narowe passages & by pathes he preuented an ouerpassed the hoost of Metellus.
                     ¶In that parte of Numidy whiche before in deuysion of the kyngdome was assigned in possessyon to Adherball: was a flodde named Muthull / rennyng from the meridyonall part of the countrey. A certayne hyll hy and longe was nere to this water / so that at any place the hyll was about .xx. myle from the streme and of equall dystance in length. The grounde of this hyll was of suche nature that euer it was barayne / wherfore it was nat apte to mennes habitacion but desert. About the myddes and pendant of it was an other hyll smaller of quantite: but of an vnmesurable heght couered and all ouergrowen with wylde olyue trees / with myr trees / & other sortes of trees wont to growe naturally on dry & sandy groūde. The playne bytwene the hylles and the water was desert and vnhabitable for lacke of water: saue such places of the playne as were nere to ye 
                        flodd of Muthull which part was growen with small trees and occupyed with men & beestes. Iugurth came to the sayd small hyll whiche descended from the pendāt of the hyll greatter ouerthwart the valey. And ther toke place with his army nat togyder but dispersed abrode amonge the trees by companyes and bendes / he made his frende Bomilchar capitayne and gouernour of his oliphantes / and of part of his army of fotemen and infourmed hym parfitely howe he shulde behaue hymselfe and gouerne them whome he had commytted to hym bothe before the batayle / and also in the batayle whan it came to the poynt. But he hymselfe drewe nerer to the great hyll withall the horsmen and many of the fotemen whiche were elect and chosen men / and sette them in ordre and array with moche policy and wysedome. This done: he hymselfe went about & compassed euery company / cohort / and bende syngulerly: and one by one warnynge and

requyringe them to call to theyr myndes theyr olde strengthꝭ nobles / and victorie: and there by to defende themselfe and their countrey of Numidy from the immoderate couetyse of the romayns / whiche were nat content nor tatisfied with the possession of the most part of the worlde / saynge fathermore that they shulde fyght but with suche as they before had auercome and subdued. And howe beit they had chaunged theyr capytayne: the cowardise of their hertes was nat chaunged: Also he rehersed & declared to thē that he had made all prouision for them whiche a captayne mygh or ought to make for his army. He declared howe he had taken for them the vpper place: that they were crafty in batayle and many in nombre: & shulde fyght with a fewe vncrafty cowardes. Wherfore he desyred & exhorted them whan tyme shulde come that than they wolde be redy to assayle the Romayns manly at sounde of the trumpettes / for that one same day sayd he shulde outher establisshe all theyr laboures / victories / and besynesses: or els it▪ shulde be the heed and begynnyng of their most great myschyefe / and dystruccion. Moreouer through out all his army he put them in remēbrance man by man of ye benefites which he had done to them before for their manly dedes of chyualry: as suche as for their worthynes he had rewarded with dignite / money / offices / or other worshyp: and shewed suche vnto other cōmen soudyours sayeng that if they wolde so demeane themselfe manly: so sholde they be promoted and auanced to worshyp and ryches. And thus he conforted them all euery man after his maners and cōdicions / some with gyftes / some with promesses / some with thretnynges / and other lyke ways acordynge to the disposicion of their myndes and nature. ¶Whyle Iugurth thus exhorted his soudyours Metellus nought knowyng of his ennemies apered with his company dyscēdyng downe the pendant of the great hyll whiche at first seyng but fewe men moche marueyled what it myght signifie / for he suspected nothyng lesse than batayle: but in beholdyng more intētyfly towarde the toppe of the small hyll afore hym he espyed among the yong trees bothe horse & men whiche wer nat fully hyd / bycause of the lownesse of the trees. yet was he incertayne what it myght be. For what by secretnes of the place: and what by gyle of Iugurth / their baners & the most part of the soudyours were obscured & hyd lyeng downe vpon the grounde. But anone after whan he parceyued this gyle & treason: by lytell & lytell / he set his army in array procedynge forwarde styll / as he dyd before / faynynge hymselfe ignorāt of the treason. But he chaunged the order of his soudyours: and on the ryght wynge whiche was next to the Numidyens

his ennemies / he ordayned as it were a forwarde enforced with a threfolde subsidy or socoures that is to say with thre bendes of proued soudyours to rescue & helpe them whan nede shuld be. The archers suche as wich slyngꝭ shulde cast agaynst their enmis plūmettꝭ of led & yron / & all other whiche were of lyght harnes: all these he deuided among the standerdes of other soudyours as the case requyred: where as after the ryght ordynaunce of batayle / suche soudyours by them selfe deuyded shuld begyn the batayle / but in this batayle the sytuacion of the place nat so requyred. All the hole cōpany of his horsmen he ordred in the extremitees & corners of the forefront of the batayle. This done as the breuyte of the tyme suffred he made a short exhortacion vnto his soudyors / & so proceded forth with his hoost sette in array in maner beforesayd: but bycause Iugurth was on the small hyll before hym and by that meane on the hyer ground he thought to remedy that incōmodite & led forth his hoost on the syde halfe nat towarde Iugurth / but alonge on the hyll towarde the flodde of Muthull / into the playne which was betwene the hyll & the flood. But whan he sawe the Numidyens quyed and that they departed nat from the hyll which they had taken he cōsydred the hete and feruentnes of the somer season. And lyst his army myght perysshe for lacke or scarcite of water: he sent before one of his capitayns named Rutilius with a cōpany of lyght harnessed soudyours and part of his horsmen vnto the flodde named Muthull for to take vp a place wherin they myght set their tentes in tyme of nede: thynkyng that his en

He thought that they purposed and intended to trouble his sodyors with werynes and thurst. Whan Rutilius was gone towarde the water / Metellus descended procedyng forth withall by lytell & lytell as the mater and place requyred: he commaunded one named Marius / with his company to kepe in the rerewarde. But Metellus hymselfe with the horsemen kept hym in the lyfte wyng of the forwarde of the batayle / whiche alway remoued forwarde first of all his army.
                  
                  
                     ¶Of the fyrst batayle foughten bytwene Metellus and Iugurth. ¶The .xxxi. chapyter.
                     
                        
                        BVt whan Iugurth sawe that the rereward of Metellus was passed his forwarde: he be set the hyll from whiche Metellus dyscended with two thousande fotemen by which garnyson if Metellus wold agayn take socour of the same hyll / he shuld be prohibyted & dryuen bacwarde agayne into the handes of Iugurth. This done: sodenly he dyd the trūpetes to be blowen and anone withall / inuaded & set vpon the company of Metellus on euery syde. The Numidyens assayled and bete downe the romayns / some on the rereward and other some dyd their deuoyre to breke the aray on both sydes: both on the ryght & lyft wyng / withall their myght assaylyng the romayns / and auaunsyng themselfe on euery syde to breke their array and ordynaunce. And after theyr power to trouble / dystourbe / and deuyde them. The romayns whiche were most stable and bolde of myndes in metyng their ennemies were abused & dysceyued with the vncertayne batayle. For their ordynaunce and array was set and strengthed onely but on one syde. But their ennemies assayled them on euery syde: so that sōtyme they were stryken & wounded of their ennemies from farre of / but by no meanes coude they stryke their ennemies agayne nor ioyne wt them. For Iugurth had taught his Numidiens on horsbake before the batayle that whan they shulde begyn to assayle the romayns: they shulde nat kepe themselfe togyder / nor nere / but asmoche dyspersed as they coude / and in diuers places: one company here and and other there. And where the soudyours of Iugurth coude nat auoyed nor repell the romayns whiche assayled them / bycause they were mo in nombre: thefore they compassed & trapped them behynde or on the sydes betyn of: and dysioyned from their company. And where it fortuned any of them to fle the Numidyans had more auantage than the romayns. For where they fled into the feldes: they assayled the romayns on the backe halfe or els on bothe sydes in dyuers companyes. But where they sawe it was more auayle and expediēt to fle agayne to the hyll where they set first their ordynaunce. They had also auantage therby for their horses were acustomed to mountaynes and combred wayes / wherfore they mounted with lesse difficultie / but in cōtrary wyse the romayns for the sharpnes of the hylles and lacke of vse coude nat folowe them in their assēdyng without moch difficulte / payne / and paryll. But nat withstandynge that Iugurth and his men had the most auantage of the countrey and grounde / yet the batayle on both sydes was variable / vncertayne / vngoodly / and myserable

to beholde: for the best men sonest were slayne and in moost ieopardy. For the courage and valyant myndes & bolde hertes of the romayns: was worth the gyle and treason of the Iugurthyns: and so on bothe sydes he which was boldest and moost auaūced hymself was sonest ouerthrowen. Some which were deuyded from their owne company and in handꝭ of their ennemies / gaue place to them and yelded themselfe. And agayne some folowed and chased their ennemies fleyng: where they myght make theirꝑty good: there resysted eyther partie manly. None of both parties kept vnder their standerdes: nor folowed nat the order of batayle: nor kept none order nor array / but euery man resysted and defended hymself ther where moost ieopardy and paryll was layed to hym: and endeuoyred hymselfe to withstande the vyolence of his ennemis with hye valyantise. And so the armour defensyfs / dartes / mē horse / Romayns / Numidyans / soudyours / and pages were all confounded and mengledde togyder: without orde or ordynaunce obserued. Nothyng was done with dyscression of the soudyours nor with counsell of the captayns: vnauysed fortune and chaunce gouerned all the bysynesse of that day: so vnstable was the batayle. All was committed to rule of fortune / And thus passed forth moche of the day in great murder and slaughter / yet styll was the ende of the batayle vncertayne and none knewe whytherpartye shulde haue the vyctorye. At last bothe parties with labour and heat began to languysshe and become wery. Metellus vnderstandynge that the Numidyans lesse resysted infyghtyng than they dyde before assembled and gathered togyder agayne his soudyours by lytell and lytell / and without tary restored the aray and set them agayne in order. And .iiii. cohortes taken forth of the legyons he set agaynst the fotemen of his ennemies. But before Metellus had thus assembled his company: a great parte of them oppressed with woundes and werynesse / withdrewe thē
                        self to the hyll before named and to the hyer places from the batayle there to refresshe and rest themselfe. But whan Metellus (as sayd is) had reasembled them agayne: he began infewe wordes to pray and exhort them in suche maner.
                     ¶O worthy and trusty soudyours and companyons dyscourage nat your selfe in this batayle / nor lette nat your olde noblenesse nowe fayle you: suffre nat your ennemies wont to put their trust in flyght / nowe to ouercome you by your ferefull myndes. Remēbre well: if ye be dysposed cowardly to fle: ye haue no tentes / no cyties / no townes / no castels / nor no maner places of defēce: wherto ye may renne for refuge and saue your selfe. your helth / your hope / & defence is onely in your armoure

and strength: & specially in your bolde hertꝭ. Wherfore dere frendes remēbre your olde worshyp: & suffre nat the hole empire of Rome to suffre dysworshyp by your temerous and cowardꝭ myndes. Remēbre it worthyer to dy in batayle lyke men than to fle / & than to be taken & murdred lyke beestes / or to dye in prison. With these wordes & suche lyke Metellus recōforted the hertes of his soudyours. But in meane tyme Iugurth for his part was nat ydle / quyet nor lesse prouident: but compassed and went about his men cōfortyng and exhortyng them also and praysing their dedes. He renued the batayle also for his part: and among the myddes of his elect soudyours he fought and proued thextremite of euery thyng: and assayd all meanes wherby any auantage myght be wonne cōforting and socourynge his men with wordes / dedes / and exāple. He boldely fought and assayled suche of the romayns as were in fear or dout: and suche as he knewe & proued bolde and stedfast / he kept them of with arowes / iauelyns / and dartes that they coude nat approche to their felowes to auaunce them nor to be socoured of them. Thus two worthy men noble and exelcent captayns fought & cōtended togyder bytwene themselfe. They themselfe lyke in strength / courage / wysdome / and policy: but of thynges longyng to chyualry vnlyke of prouision. For Metellus had strength of soudyours sufficiently: but the auantage of the countrey and place was moche contrary to hym. But Iugurth had euery thyng necessary and expedyent / saue company of men of armes whiche he wanted. ¶At last the romayns whan they vnderstode that there was no sure place wherto they myght fle: and also that they coude fynde no meanes to fyght with their ennemies indifferently hande to hande. And that the nyght was come vpon them: at last they ascended vpon the toppe of an hyll whiche was ouer agaynst them lyke as Metellus their captayne commaunded them to do. For the Numidyans had lost that place and were fledde and spredde a brode dyspersed / but fewe of them were slayne. For they were swyfte: and the contrey was nat well knowen to the Romayns to pursue them: wherby many of the Numidyans were defended: and so by flyght escapedde. But Iugurth with his horsemen of garde for his body: fledd also from the batell whan he had longe foughten and sawe none auayle nor auantage.
                  
                  
                     ¶How Bomylchar vndercaptayne of Iugurth and his company were dysconfited by Rutilyus vndercaptayne of Metellus. ¶The .xxxii. chapyter.
                     
                        
                        IN the mean season Bomylchar / whō Iugurth had made maister of his elyphantes / and of a part of the fotemen (as I haue written before) assone as he sawe that Rutilius (which Metellus had sent vnto the flodde of Muthull to prouide a place for their tentes) was ouerpassed his company: by lytell & lytell he conuayed and ledde downe his company into a playne. And whyle this Rutilius hasted hym towarde the flodde as he was cōmaunded of Metellus. Bomilchar set his company in order & array styll & quietly as the mater and case requyred. And in meane tyme he forgat nat to serche by espies what Metellus dyd / and what way Rutilius toke toward the sayd flodde: and in what maner he behaued hymselfe & gyded his army. Wherfore after he vnderstode by his espyes that Rutilius with his cōpany had taken their place by the sayd flodde where he wold abyde: and was voyde of besynes / quyet / and doutyng no paryll. And on the other syde whan he vnderstode that the cry of the batayle bytwene Iugurth & Metellus encreased: he feared lest Rutilius (if he vnderstode therof) wolde leue his place by the flodde: and retourne to the batayle to socour his felowes which were in ieopardy. In this consideracion Bomilchar: where as before he had ordered his army nere togyder by craft and that bycause he mystrusted the courage of his men: and in their boldnesse had no great confidence. Therfore nowe agayne he deuyded them a brode moche larger than they were before: and so procede towarde the tentes of Rutilyus / to thintent to lette hym and his company on euery syde / if they prepared towarde rescous of Metellus. Rutilyus and his company suspectynge no peryll sodaynlie of vnware aduysed great vyolence of smoke and duste styred vp and raysed by mouynge of the grounde: but what it myght be they coude nat parceyue by any meane bycause of the thicknesse of the yonge trees that grewe on all the grounde bytwene them which letted their syght. First of all they thought it had proceded of drines of the ground by mouyng of the wynde. But afterwarde whan they sawe the same smoke and dust contynue styll after one maner: and that the same approched alway nerer and nerer lykewyse as the company of their ennemies moued and drewe toward them. Than they parceyued and knewe the mater as it was: and in all hast euery man toke to hym his harnesse: and stode redy before the defence of their tēres as their captayne Rutilyus had ordred and commaunded them euery man redy at defēce and in aray. After whan their ennemies approched nerer with an horryble noyse and cry / they ranne togyder on bothe parties.

The Numidyens dyd but onely cōtynue the skirmysshe abydynge & lokyng after their elyphātes in helpe of whome was all their trust. But whan they sawe that their elyphātes were stopped & lette with thyckenesse of the bowes of the treis: and so taryed & kept from their socours by the cōpassyng of the romayns so that in them was no trust of socours. Than all they toke them to flyght with all their power. But many of thē (leuyng their armour behynde them) escaped without wounde by helpe of the hylles whych were about the place: which they coude better & quicklyer ascende than the romayns. And also by socour of the darknesse of the nyght (which than was at hande) many of them escaped hole & sounde and saued themselfe. Foure of the elyphantes were taken and all the remenāt (fourty in nombre) were slayne. Whan this was done: the cō
                        pany of Rutilius / nat withstandynge that they were fatigate and weryed with great iourneis before / and also with moche labour in orderyng of their tentes: & with the sayd batayle or skirmysshe: neuertheles whan they sawe that Metellus their chefe captayne taryed longer than they thought he wold haue done yf all thynge had happened well with hym / they ordred themselfe redy & diligently went backwarde agayne to mete hym. For the falshode and gyle of Iugurth and of the Numidyans caused them to be besy / diligēt / and circumspect in euery thyng for sauegard of their lyues / & suffred them to do nothyng slouly nor with delayeng. But whan they were in their iourney in the darknesse of the nyght the companyes on both parties were nat fare in sondre the one from the other: and bothe parties approched togyder nat knowyng eche other as if they had ben ennemies. The one agaynst the other making noyse and clamour eche one increasyng fear to other as warryours ar wont to do at begynnyng of a batayle. Insomoch that a miserable dystruction & murdre had almost ben cōmitted bytwene them by their imprudēt negligence / if the espyes and horsmen whiche were sent bytwene them on bothe sydes had nat with more diligēce & wyselyer espied the treuth of the mater. But whan the parties knewe eche other / their sadnes and feare tourned to great ioye & gladnesse. The soudyours ioyfully anone met togyder one salutyng & welcomȳg other. One shewed to other their actes done on bothe parties: and ioyous they were to here on bothe sydes euery man commendyng & exaltyng their owne dedes / and also the dedꝭ of other vnto heuen with myrthe & gladnesse. And that aswell such as were worthy men as vnworthy cowardys ascrybed to themselfe worthynesse. And certes in such busynesse it often happeneth / that on that syde which hath the victorie: suche as be but

cowardes / rude and vncrafty / exalteth them / enioyeth / and may bost themselfe on other mennes dedes and worthynesse. But in cōtrary wyse on that partie which is ouercom though many be good warryours / noble & worthy men: yet ar they reputed for cowardꝭ without policy / bycause of other mennes cowardyse & aduersyte of fortune. Thus fareth it in skirmysshes of batayle. But whan Metellus & Rutilius (as I haue sayd before) were mette togyder and rehersed their actes one to other Metellus hasted hym withall his army to the flodd of Muthull / and taryed in the places & tentes whiche Rutilius had prepared & seiourned there the space of foure dayes. In this season he was besy in refresshyng & healyng his soudyours whiche were wounded / suche as manly had behaued themselfe in the batayle he worthely rewarded them / he called them togyder all into one cōpany and greatly landed & commended them: thankyng & moch praysyng them for the great dilygēce / payne / and labors: whiche they had taken in defence of the honour & dignite of their empire with suche wordes. ¶O worthy soudyours ye se nowe that the hardest of our labour is ouerpassed by your boldnesse and manhode: wherfore I exhort you: be ye of lyke courage in the resydue of our besynesse / whiche shalbe but lyght & easy in comparyson of this which is ouerpassed. The begynnyng and first brunt of euery besynesse is hardest. Whiche shall be but lyght vnto bolde and circūspect begynners & constant folowers of their enterprises. But this begynnyng ye haue manly ouercome by constant labour as thyng moost easy. ynough haue we foughten all redy for the glorie of victory: for that haue we optayned in this first cōflyer. If we labour or fight any more it shalbe but onely for prayes and robberies of our ennemies: wherby we shalbe enryched in substance: lyke as we nowe be inhaunced with glorie of victory. Wherfore my dere felowes & most constant frendes of the cōmen welth nowe I exhort you for cōplement of all your honorable fame: to remēbre your olde & acustomed worthynesse. And suffre nat this excellent honoure & glorie which ye haue nowe optayned by boldnes: to be quenched and decay agayne by ignomynious cowardyse.
                     ¶With suche wordes & many other lyke Metellus reconforted his cōpany: & maruelously kyndled their courage to the desyre of honour by valyant feates of armes. But in ye meane season the knowen gyle of Iugurth went nat from his mynd: and therfore to exclude all danger of treason he sent forth certayne of the Numidiens / which betraynge Iugurth had forsaken hym & fled to the romayns: & also with thē he sent forthe dyuerse other of his owne company which were expert of the

countrey / and oportune to suche besynesse to serche and espye among what people or in what place Iugurth held hymselfe: and wherin he was ocupyed. Whyther he kept hym wt a small company: or whyther he had an army reassembled for a newe batayle / and how he behaued hymselfe & where about he went syth he was ouercome. But Iugurth had conuayed hymselfe into such places as were full of dychesse / valeis / hylles / treis / busshes / & dales defended of nature. And there had he assembled agayne a newe army of men / mo in nōbre than he had before. But they were but vncraftie / inerpert / and dull to batell: and coude better tyll the grounde and kepe beestes / than excercyse the dedes of chiualry. For therto had they neuer ben vsed before: but in the other seruyle ocupaciōs & besynesse had they ben ocupyed all their lyftyme without intermixtion of other ocupacion. It fortuned that Iugurth had none other soudyours / but suche rurall people about hym at this tyme namely for this cause. For whan he fled from the batayle foughten before with Metellus / none of all his soudyours folowed hym / except the horsmen of his garde. For all the other soudyours departed where it lyked them best. Nor this is nat coūted nor reputed for any faute or rebuke among the Numidyens soudyours. For suche is the custome of the countrey: whan the capitayne fleeth the hoost forsaketh hym.
                  
                  
                     ¶what wast and dystruction Metellus made in the lande of Numidy after this first batayle and flyght of Iugurth: and of the gyle of Iugurth agaynst Metellus. ¶The .xxxiii. chapter.
                     
                        WHā Metellus vnderstode by his espyes that the mynde of Iugurth cōtinued yet styll in his olde fyersnesse & crueltie thoughe he was lately ouercome in batayle. And whan Metellus sawe that Iugurth renewed the warre agayne and prepared a newe batayle whiche coude nat be done but at pleasure of Iugurth / bycause he had taken suche a place to abyde in that no man coude cōueniently cōtende with hym for dyfficultie therof. Metellus thus knowyng aduised hymselfe of many thynges. Namely he consydred that they were nat in different & egall on bothe parties in executyng therof. For all yf that he had the vpper hand ouer Iugurth & had put hym to flyght: yet lost he mo men and had more dāmage in ouercomyng hym / than Iugurth had whiche was ouercome. For this consyderacion Metellus purposed no more to contende with hym in playne feldes nor in ordered batayle / but by an

other maner to execute the warre with hym from thensforthe. This determyned: Metellus with his hole hoost and ordynaunce went forth into the moost ryche and plentyfull places of all Numidy / and there wasted and dystroyed the feldes & coūtrey on euery syde. He toke without any resystence castels and townes / nat strongly defended with walles / dychesse / nor garnyson. And brent and bete them downe to the grounde. All suche as came in his way and were able to bere harnesse: full growen of age or apt to batayle: he slewe and ryd out of hande. Thynkynge that the mo he slewe the fewer aduersaries and ennemies shulde he haue to contende agaynst hym. He cōmaunded his soudyors to spare no robbery nor prayes: but gaue althyng to hauocke among his soudyours.
¶For feare of this crueltie many of the Numidyens yelded themselfe to the romayns: and gaue vnto them hostages / vytayls / sodyours / and all other thynges necessary abundātly. Insome townes whiche were taken: Metellus sette defence and garnyson where nede requyred and fortified them sufficiently. This besynesse troubled the mynd of Iugurth moche more than the batayle that was foughten before to his great dammage and disconfort of his men. For he lost more people by this way than by any other meane before. Thus Iugurth whiche before put all his hope and trust in his flyght: was nowe of necessite compelled to folowe and pursue his ennemies: and he whiche coude nat defende his owne places whiche styll remayned in his possession: was constrayned nowe to warre in those coostes / which Metellus had wonne of hym to recouer them yf fortune wolde suffre hym. Neuertheles of suche poore shyft and counsell as

                        e had he toke the best which coude be taken by his aduyse in suche extreme necessite. He commaunded his army for the most part to remayne styll in the same place where they were. And he hymselfe with a company of horsemen whiche were bolde and chosen men ensued Metellus priuely / makyng his iouneis by nyght tyme by / by wayes and secrete valeis. And at last sodenly of vnwa

                        WHyle Metellus and Iugurth stryued thus togyder: the one with manhode / wysdome & strength: the other with treason / craft / & gyle: Tidynges were brought to Rome of this noble behauour of Metellus. Ouer all the cite was demeaned great ioye & gladnes for that Metellus behaued hymselfe & gyded his army acordyng to ye maner & ordinaūce of olde noble capitayns of the romayns before his days. And howbeit he was in place aduers & contrary to hym yet had he the vpper hande of his ennemies as victorie ouer them. And by his strength & manhode he had in possession the coūtrey of his ennemies: & had driuen them from place to place. All these thyngꝭ cōsydred: they moch reioyced & greatly cōmended Metellus: namely for that he had caused Iugurth to put his trust of helth onely in fleyng into the moūtayns & wyldernesse / whiche before was magnificent & proude by the fear & cowardyse of Aulus predecessour of Metellus. Wherfore for these fortunat & glorious dedes of Metellus / the senatours decreed and cōmaūded ouer all the cite sacrifices & suffrages to be done to their ydolles. The citezyns whiche before were ferefull & sore troubled doutyng the vnsure chaūce & incertayne fortūe of the ende of this warre: demened nowe amonge them myrthe and gladnesse ouerall. The honoure & fame of Metellus was recoūted very noble / excellēt / & gloryous in euery mannes mouthe. Wherfore he somoche was the more dyligent and laboured more besely towarde the vyctore laboringe & hastynge to finysshe the warr by all meanes & wayes so it might be to his honour & cōfusion of Iugurth. But neuertheles he was well ware from puttyng hymselfe in danger of his ennemies: and was ware exchuynge oportunite of their gyle in euery place where he went. He remēbred well & cōsydred that often after laude & glorie foloweth enuy & euyl wyll. And therfore howe moche more noble that he was reputed: the more besy & dilygent he was to mentayne his fame & honour / & in drede to lose this worthy fame which he had optayned. Nor after the foresayd gyle of Iugurth he suffred nat his hoost to deuide nor to departe themselfe dysparsed one from other: nor to make excourses

to forage or spoyle in diuers places far dystant in sondre. But whan they had nede outher of mannes meate or horsemeate: all the horsemen with great cōpanyes of the fotemen / went forthe & kept them nere about suche as were sende forthe to make prouision to defende and socour them: if nede shulde requyre. Metellus hymselfe deuyded his hoost in two partes: the one part he kept with hymselfe: & the other he commytted to a noble warriour of his hoost named Marius / bytwene them both they dystroyd & wasted the contrey on euery syde / but rather with fire than wt robbry or prayes. Metellus & Marius set their tentes in two places nat far distāt in sondre. But whan any perylous or nedy besynesse was to be done wt Iugurth or his cōpany whiche requyred great myght: than

                        WHan Metellus sawe hym selfe so weryed with the gyles and craftes of Iugurth / and that by no policy he coude haue faculty or tyme to fight with hym in playne batayle: at last he cōcluded to besyge & assayle a great towne named zamam / whiche was the most chefe & strongest holde of

all the realme of Numidy in that part of the lande where it was buylded. And so sped hym thyder withall his army and ordinance where the sayd holde was (thynkyng as the mater requyred) that Iugurth wolde drawe thyder for defence of his chife towne and for socour and relefe of his people and so shulde the batayle be there foughten bytwene them. But whā Metellus was in his iourney thyderwarde / anone were certayn of his army which fled to Iugurth and certified hym of this prouision and interprise of Metellus. Whan Iugurth herof was certified he hasted hym by gret iourneis so that he ouerpassed the cōpany of Metellus and came to the towne of zamam before hym: & there exhorted the inhabitantes boldly to defende the walles. And farthermore assigned to socour & helpe them all suche as had fled from the romayns / and had brought hym those tidyngꝭ. These treatours were the surest men whiche Iugurth had. For they coude nat dysceyue hym / but if they wolde yelde them agayne to the romayns whome they had forsaken and betrayed which thyng was nat sure to them to do. Whan Iugurth had ioyned these soudyours to the garnison and socours of the towne and castell / and had ordred & apoynted all other thynges acordynge to his mynde: than he promysed to be there agayne with them with all his hole army in tyme of nede. This done he departed from the towne into the most preuy & secret places which he knewe in his countrey therby But whan Metellus was in his iourney towarde zaman / he sende Marius for prouision of whete and other corne & vitayle for the army vnto a towne named Sicca / whiche was the first towne that forsoke Iugurth & was yelded to Marius after the batayle late foughten with Iugurth to his great damage. Whan Iugurth had knowledge herof he went thyder by nyght priuely with his elect soudyors so that whan Marius had sped his maters & was redy to departe forth of the towne: Iugurth was redy at the gates to assayle the romayns cruelly cryeng with a hye voyce to them of the towne & exhortynge them to assayle the romayns also on the backe halfe: saynge that fortune had offred to them the chaunce of a noble act / of an excellent & glorious dede: so that (yf they wolde folowe his desyre) they shulde restore hym agayne into his kyngdome & themselfe into their libertie and from thensforth passe their tyme without peryll / without danger or drede. And certaynely if Marius had nat boldely and strongly broken out of the towne with his standerdes & men of armes through the thickest of his ennemies whiche were in the gates. All they of the towne or the most part wolde haue broken theyr oth and promesse / whiche they had made before

to Metellus whan they first yelded themselfe and the cite is hym. The myndes of the Numidiens be so vnstedfast and mouable. But Iugurth so conforted his soudyours that they resysted the romayns a lytell season. But whā Marius and his company began to encrease their violence agaynst the Iugurthyns and more fiersely to prease vpon them. Anone some were slayne and the resydue fled with their maister Iugurth. This daunger ouerpassed: Marius departed thens towarde the towne of zaman / and at the last came thyder safe with all his cōpany and besynesse sped wherfore he was sent.
                     ¶This Samam was a towne bylded in the playne groūde without hylles or waters nere it defended rather by ye warke of mannes hande / than by nature of the place. In it fayled nothyng necessary to batayle. For it was well garnissed both with men / ordynaunce / vitayls / and armour. Anone whan Marius was come: Metellus acordynge to the tyme and place made redy all thynges necessary and compassed the walles on euery syde wt his army: assignynge to euery one of his vndercapitayns a separate place of the towne to assayle and there to do his deuoyre and shewe his manhode. Whan euery thynge was thus ordred Metellus commaunded to sounde to the assaut with trumpettes and cla
                           •
                        yons. The romayns immediatly assayled the towne on euery syde wt horryble noyse & clamoure. The Numidiens therof were nat a drad at all: but abode styll and kept them selfe in sylence as if they had nat ben displeased nor prouoked to batayle: howebeit they kept the walles euery man on the part to hym assigned & all were redy to resyst & to assayle the romayns. Anone the batayle was begone. The romayns exercysed and occupyed themselfe euery man wt suche wepyn as he coud best handell and was most expert in: some with slynges thrue plummettes of leed / and some stones from a farre into the cyte / and at them whiche defended the walles / some assayled the towne nerer inuadyng the same / and couetyng to haue entre and vndermyning the walles / some boldly escaled walles desirynge to come so nere that they myght fyght hande to hand. On the othersyde thinhabitauntes of the towne and garnyson resysted manly. Some rowled downe and ouertourned great & weyghty stones on suche as were nerest to them / and that vndermyned the walles. Some pytched downe vpon them dartes / iauelyns / pykes / firebrandes: and also great brennynge polles / faggottes / and blockys ouercouered with pytche and brēstone ardenly flamyng. Some boldly ouertourned the scalyng ladders and slewe & ouerthrue suche as scaled the walles

But some other whiche were farther from the towne and for prease coude nat approche nere to the walles in the meane season were nother fearfull nor ydell. For there was no maner instrument of batayle whiche coude be throwen with hande / or with any other ingyne of batayle: but that they thrue it into the towne / wherwith they wounded and slewe many of the inhabitantes and of the defenders of the walles. The dartes and crosbowes on bothe parties were nat vnoccupyed. Artellery nor gonnes had they none. For at that tyme was no mencion of them nor they were nat yet inuent. The romains which were farthest of all from the walles escaped nat fre: but with dartes were ouerthrowen in great nombre. Howe beit their cowardous and fearfull myndes caused them to drawe themselfe aloufe behynde all other for to saue themselfe / yet coude they nat auoyde the paryll. Thus were the w

                     ¶Howe Iugurth assayled and inuaded the tentes of the romayns in the meantyme whyle Metellus gaue assaut to the towne of zammam. ¶The .xxxvi. chapyter.
                     
                        WHyle the assaut contynued thus at zammam / with great murdre & distruction on both ꝑties: Iugurth sodenly and of vnware stale downe from the mountaynes where he was hyd / and with a great power of men assayled & inuaded the romayns tentes whyle the soudyours whome Metellus had assygned to the warde & defence of them were within the same at their rest: and suspecting nothing lesse than any suche assaut. Wherfore Iugurth brake in vpon them vnprouyded. The romayns were sore abasshed of that soden feare. And euery man prouided for hymselfe / acordynge to his maners and dysposycion. Some whiche were cowardes fled withall their myght / some other valiant and bolde herted men drewe to their harnes and manly withstode their ennemies. Neuerthelesse the moost parte of them all were / outher wounded or slayne. But among all the company and of all the multitude of them were no more but .xl. men whiche abode. These .lx. acompanyed themselfe togyder remembryng the worshyp of the empire of Rome / and toke a place a lytell aboue their ennemies: whiche place they defended so manly that they coude

nat be driuen from it by moche violence of their ennemies / agaynst whome they thrue dartes from a far. And suche dartes as their ennemies thrue at them: they thrue ye same agayn. So they beynge but a fewe agaynst so many dyd nothyng in vayne. For they coude throwe no dart / but that it lyghted among the thyckest of them. But so coude nat their ennemies do agaynst them. For they were so fewe: so nere togyder: & on so sure a place that their enmies myght lytell thynge preuayle agaynst them. But whan the Numidiēs approched nerer to them: than specially these .xl. valiant romayns shewed and bestowed thier manhode & strength wt most excellent courage assayling their enmies: ouerthrowyng & chasyng them backwarde by very force & strēgth. ¶In the meane tyme whyle Metellus was most of all ocupyed and besyed in the forsayd assaut of zamam: sodenly he herde behynde hym a great clamour & noyse of people. Anone he refrayned his horse: and in tournyng backe parceyued great cōpanyes of men rennynge towarde hym: wherby he well knewe that they were of his owne people & cōpany. But whā he vnderstode all the chaūce which was be fallen. Anone in all hast he sent all the hole company of his horsmen vnto his tentes: & soone after he sent thyder also his chife vndercaptayne Caius Marius with his retynue & company to hym assigned. And sore wepyng he obtested exhorted / and besaught hym for all loue & frendshyp: and for honour of ye cōmen wayle / that he wolde nat suffre any disworshyp or cōtumely remayne in the romayns that day whiche euerthytherto had ben victorious and ouercomers with great laude and honour: and that he wolde nat suffre their ennemy Iugurth and his cōpany to depart away vnreuenged. Marius dyd the cōmaundemēt of Metellus and that shortly. But in the meane season Iugurth perceyued many of the kepers of the tentes fallen into the dyches that were made about the same for defence: so that for hast to ronne away they hurt themselfe more / than he dyde. Iugurth aduysing their daunger cōsydred that hymselfe was lyckely to be let vnder the same maner yf he auentured ouer farre. And therfore he departed betyme into the surest places that he coude deuyse nere by leauynge many of his men behynde: outher deed or mortally wounded. Thus was Marius frustrat of his labour: for Iugurth was fled before he came to the tentes. But Metellus (without any thyng brought to ende at zamā) whā the nyght drewe nere: retourned with his hoost into his tentes. On the next morne after / before he retourned agayne to the assaut of zaman: he cōmaunded all the cōpany of his horsmen to course vp and downe before their tentes on that syde wher they supposed

Iugurth wolde come to socour his people. The entres into the tentes and places nere to them he commytted and deuided to warde of his vnder capitayns. After that he retourned agayne to the towne and fiersly assaylyd the walles in lyke maner as he had done the day before.
                     ¶In the meane season Iugurth agayne sodenly stale vpon the romayns: & specially on them which coursed before the tentes: they whiche wer next hym & whōe he encoūtred first of all were a lytell tyme sore troubled & abasshed: but the remenant of the romayns lyghtly assembled their socours. And so valyantly behaued themselfe that the Numidiēs shuld nat long haue cōtinued the skyrmysshe: if their fotemen myngled with the romayns horsmen had nat in the mydell cōmytted great myschefe and dystruction. For the horsemen of Iugurth trustyng to ye helpe of these fotemen which wer myngled among them: dyd nat first procede forwarde auaūcing themselfe and than retourne backe agayne as the vse is in a batayle of spere men. But they ran in makynge incourses among the thyckest of the romayns ouerthwart and sydelingꝭ: infoldyng & dowblyng theyr courses: and cōtendyng to trouble & dysorder the array and order of the forwarde and wynges of the romayne hoost. Insomoche that what with the Numidyens on horsebacke & with them on fote it lacked but lytell: but the romains were confounded and ouercome in that greuous conflict.
                     ¶But here wyll I leue the horsmen of the romains fightyng for their lyues and honour agaynst Iugurth and his speremen. And nowe shall I declare howe Metellus the chefe capitayn of the romayns behaued hymselfe with his hoost in the assaut of zammam.
                  
                  
                     ¶How Metellus behaued himself for his part & of the great cōflyct which the romayns had agaynst the Numidyans: Metellus with his fotmē assaylinge the towne of zāmam for the one part: and Iugurth fiersly fighting with the romayns speremen for the other part. The .xxxvii. chap.
                     
                        IN the same tyme whyle this skirmysshe cōtinued bytwene the romains horsmen and the Numidyēs / whiche were with Iugurth: the assaut also agaynst the towne of zammam indured with moche strengthe / violence and murder. And specially wher as Metellus had assigned his vnder

captayns on euery syde of the towne (as I haue sayd before) there cōtynued the assaut most sharply. One of them put nat his trust nor hope in other: but euey man in his owne dedes & in hymselfe. Vnder the same maner dyd the garnyson & inhabitantes of the towne behaue themselfe: they fought manly agayne & also ordayned all thynges cōuenient for their defence in euery place of the towne. Bothe the parties were redyer and more besye one to stryke & wounde other than to defende themselfe. The clamoure & noyse was myxt with exhortacion and confort of some / and the ioye of the quellars & murderers was mingled with the wayling of them which were quelled & murdred. The sounde of the armoure / horrious and strokes mounted to the ayre. The sky was darked with dartes fleyng on eyther syde. And the walles & dychesse were dyed wt blode: and fylled with deed corses pytefull to se. But whan the Numidiens were somwhat at layser / and whan the romayns a lytell abated & remitted the assaut: than they whiche defended the walles of the towne loked out a farre & intentifely behelde the batayle of the horsmen which styll cōtinued. There myght one haue sene them somtyme mery & ioyous / somtyme full of dolour & heuynesse after as they sawe the case of the part of Iugurthe went forwarde or bacwarde. And aswell as they coude be sene & herde of their felowes which were with theyr kyng Iugurth: some warned them to audacite / some exhorted them to courage / other they gaue them signes wt their handes or with the iesture of their bodyes & cōtenances mouyng and excityng them to boldnesse. If they sawe a romayne stryke a Numidyan: they moued & withdrue their bodyes auoyding the stroke as yf it had ben themselfe whiche had ben striken. And if they sawe a Numidyen cast a dart agaynst a romayn: they moued their bodyes also as they had cast it themselfe. Thus toke they so intentife hede to the batayle that they forgate themselfe where they were / and it semed them that they had ben with their felowes in batayle. Whan Marius which besyged the towne on that syde: vnderstode this maner & behauour of the inhabitaūtes & garyson: he abated his fiersnes for policy & was more slowe in besyegyng of the towne than before fayning that he had no trust nor cōfidence to wynne it and suffred the Numidyens within the towne to beholde the batayle of their kynge / for a whyle without any resystence or besynesse. But whā he sawe them most intentifely beholdyng the batayle / & most amased for the besynesse of their felowes & countrey men: than sodenly withall his power he gaue assaut to the walles so that many of the romayns with ladders and other ingynes / had almost mounted vnto the hyghest part of

them. Thynhabitantes seynge this expelled their amasednes remembryng themselfe: and ran manly agaynst them with resystence throwyng vpon them stones / fyre / & all maner dartes of batayle. The romayns at begynnyng resysted valiantly / defendyng themselfe and auancyng them to the walles. But whan thinhabitantes had first ouerthrowen and broken one ladder / and than ouertourned an other. They whiche abode last were maymed or slayne. Anone the remenant departed & gaue ouer the walles vnder the best maner that they coude a fewe or none hole. For a great part of them withdrewe themselfe transfired with mortall wondes. Anone after the nyght fell vpon them whiche caused both the parties to desyst / and leue of the batayle.
                  
                  
                     ¶How Metellus remoued the siege from zammam: & howe Bomylchar so ꝑswaded Iugurth that he yelded hymselfe / his kyngdome / and all other thynges / to mercy & grace of the romayns. And howe Iugurth after losse of his men / treasour / elephantes / armour / and horse: changed his mynde agayne. ¶The .xxxviii. chapyter.
                     
                        BVt whan Metellus sawe his purpose and labour all in vayne: and that he coude nat wynne the towne. and also that Iugurthe dyd nought / but by gyle and falshode / nor wolde nat fight but yf it were in places for his profet & great auantage. And also whā he perceyued that the somer was passed: he departed from the siege of zāmam: & in suche townes as he had won of Iugurth whiche were strongly defended with walles & water: he set garnyson & soudyours of his cōpany to defende them. But the remenant of his army he cōuayed & ordred in the next ꝓuince vnto Numidy / which was subget to the romayns: to remayne there tyll the sharpnesse of the wynter were passed. N
                           •
                        r in the meane tyme he suffred nat them / nor hymselfe to be corrupted wc superfluous welth / rest / nor lechery: after the maner of other before hym. But bycause the warre proceded forwarde but lytell with armour or strength: he begā to proue & prepare treason agaynst a treatour / dysceyt agaynst a dysceyuer: and gyle agaynst gyle of Iugurth: and this thought he to proue by suche as were moost chefe frendes of Iugurth & most familyer about hym. So that he purposed to vse the falshode and treason of them

agaynst their maister: in stede of armour and batayle. Wherfore first of all he began to proue the mynde of Bomilchar whiche had ben before at Rome with Iugurth: and (as I haue sayd before) fled priuely frō thens for the deth of Massiua / leuyng his sureties behynde ī danger for his cause. Metellus consydred that this Bomilchar (by cause of the great frendshyppe and familiarite whiche he had with Iugurth) sonest myght dysceyue and betray hym. Wherfore (as I haue sayd before) he began and went in hande with hym first of all by promisyng of great rewardes. And first of all he dyd somoch: that this Bomilchar came priuely to Metellus & spake with hym. Metellus anone promysed hym on fayth & treuth to do so for hym: that the senatours shuld pardon hym of all thyngꝭ past / and of his lyfe & goodes. So that he wolde betray or delyuer vnto hym Iugurth other quycke or deed: lyghtly he persuaded the numidyan. For anon Bomilchar agreed therto: what for his treaterous & false mynde which he had of nature. And what for that he douted if any peace or composicion after that shulde be made bytwene Iugurth & the romayns hymselfe shuld be delyuerd by cōdycion to the romayns to be punisshed for ye deth of Massiua whom he caused to be slayne at Rome. This Bomilchar whan he sawe his tyme toke leue of Metellus on this apoyntement: and sone after came to Iugurth whome he founde doutefull in care and bewayling his aduers and myserable fortunes with profunde syghes and heuynesse / and doutyng what way was most expedient to be taken. Bomilchar after many wordes beganne to counsell & warne hym / praynge / and obtestyng hym / pyteously wepyng and wayling: and requyring that at last he wolde make some prouision for the sauegarde & socours of hymselfe / of his children & frendes: and for the people of Numidy which well had deserued agnenst hym to be prouided for and better sene to. Bomilchar also obiected to Iugurth howe he and his menne were ouercome in euery batayle / and his people also diminisshed or alyenate from hym / his feldes and townes wasted & distroyd or els in possession of his ennemies / his men some taken & in prison. Some slayne: and many wounded & maymed / the rychesse of his realme dyminisshed and wasted. Bomilchar alleged also to hym that he had proued the strength of his soudyours and fauour of fortune sufficiently ynough / wherfore it were better for hym to se some remedy and prouision for all these ylles and other mo / and to beware lest whyle he prolonged the tyme and douted: the people of the countrey shulde prouide for themselfe without his aduise or counsell. With these wordes and other lyke Bomilchar induced the

kynges mynde to make some cōposicion or els to yelde hymselfe / and all other thynges to mercy & grace of the romayns. Anone embassadors were sende to Metellus to certify hym that Iugurth was redy to do what euer he wolde desyre or cōmaunde hym: and that he wolde cōmyt & yelde bothe hymselfe and his kyngdome to the fayth & grace of Metellus: and of the romayns without any pactyon / conuenaunt / or exception: sauyng onely as it pleased them to deale with hym. Metellus heryng of this mynde of Iugurth was very glade: and cōmaunded all the most wyse / noble / & worthy men of his army anone to be called togyder vnto hym from their wyntryng places. Whan they were cōe than toke he coūsell of them & of other suche as he knewe wysest & most discrete touchynge the embassade of Iugurth. Anone it was cōcluded & decreed among the counsell and declared to the embassadours (acordyng to the olde custome of Rome) that they shuld cōmaunde Iugurth to sende to Metellus & the romayns two hundred thousande pounde weyght of syluer: all his elyphātes which he ocupyed in warre: and a certayne quantite of armour and a nōbre of his chife horse. All these thyngꝭ were fulfylled and done of Iugurth without any tary or delay. Wherfore anone after Metellus cōmaunded agayne that all they whiche had betrayed his hoost / forsaken hym & fled to Iugurth shuld be bounden & so brought to hym agayne. The most part of them were brought as he cōmaūded: but a fewe of them whan they herde first of this cōposicion (feryng the same mater) fled vnto Bocchus kyng of the moryens.
                     ¶Whan Iugurth after this maner was bereft of his armour of his horse / of his men / & also of his treasour. Anone after he was called by Metellus to come to a towne called Tysidium there to here what farthermore shulde be cōmaūded to hym: & to yelde hymselfe to thempire of Rome acordynge to his embassade. But he began than to change & to tourne his mynde agayne dredyng for the knolegyng of his cruell dedes that he shuld neuer escape cōdigne punysshemēt if he were ones ī the romayns handes. Thus he cōtynued many dayes in douring what was best to be done. Somtyme he volued in mynde rather to subdue hymselfe to any difficultie & to byde all paynes than to begyn warre agayn: cōsydring the aduers & vnhappy fortune whiche he had before. Somtyme agayne he called to mynde how greuous a fall it shuld be to descēde from a kyngdome into subiection and bondage. But at cōclusion whan in vayne & to none effect he had lost suche great ordynaunce and helpe of warre as he had lately delyuered to Metellus: as a volage brayned man / he fully determined agayne to begyn &

continue the warre with Metellus: rather than to yelde hym selfe to deth or captiuite.
                     ¶But durynge this season at Rome was a counsell amonge the senatours concernyng thassignement of rule and gouernaunce of the prouinces belongynge to thempyre: in whiche counsell it was decreed that the countrey and warre of Numidy shulde be commytted to Metellus / by prorogacion of his authorite for another yere more.
                     ¶But here wyll I leue a whyle to speke of Metellus: & write of the ambicion of Marius: and how he behaued hymselfe in supplantyng the same Metellus for his rowme & dignite.
                  
                  
                     ¶How Marius by ambition laboured to be cō
                        sull and to prosecute the warre of Numidy: and how he detracted and supplāted the consull Metellus. ¶The .xxxix. chapyter.
                     
                        AT the same season the sayd Marius was in a towne named Vtica / and there made supplicacion & oblacion to the ydolles with moche sacricfice to the intent that it myght be his fortune (by helpe) to haue the place of Metellus. A custome damnable was among the people at those dayes: whan they slewe any beest in sacrifice: to loke within the intrayles and bowelles of ye same best so sacrifised. where was shewed vnto them dyuers tokens whyther they shuld haue any hope to bring that mater to effect: for which they sacrifised or els nat. And often tymes the wycked spyrites to cause them ꝑseuer in their ydolatry: and to gyue credēce to that blynd errour shewed many tokēs to thē insuch maner sacrifice: which tokens they often founde true. But now to my purpose. The preest of the ydolles whiche sacrifysed for Marius shewed great and marueylous tokens vnto hym: wherby he myght greatly trust to come to his intent and purpose / byddyng hym prosecute that thyng on whiche he had sette his mynde: and haue sure confydence in his goddes. Sayng that if he wolde proue the extremite of fortune diligētly and often: than doutlesse euery thynge prosperously shulde happen to hym. But Marius afore that tyme: longe season wonderously desyred in his mynde the dignite of the consull. And to say trueth he wanted nothyng which longed to hym / whiche shulde haue such a dignite saue onely antiquite of his progeny and auncient noblenesse of byrthe. For thought he were but a gentylman

of the first heed: neuerthelesse his cōdicions were worthy and excellēt. In hym was great experiēce of wysdome, moche probite / honestie / and sadnesse. He had great polycy and connyng in chyualry: in batayle his mynd was excellent & bolde. But in peace it was lowe and moderate. He ouercame couetyse and sensualite of his body. He desyred nor coueyted nothyng erthly saue glorie / laude / and worshyp. This Marius was borne & brought vp by all his chyldhode in the countrey of Champayne beyonde Fraūce in a towne named Arpyne. But assone as he was encreased / so that he myght bere harnesse and byde the hardnesse of warfare: he concluded to lyue on the wages of chyualrie. And in that study he exercysed hymselfe: and nat in eloquence of greke langage or in other study or science: nor yet in the superfluous aparayle nor carnall lustes of citezins vnto which he neuer subdued his body. And thus was he indued with good maners: and excercysed among honest ocupacions and so continued that his hole and vndefyled with shortly encreased & exalted himselfe growyng to honour and vertu. First whan this Marius desyred of the cōmenty of Rome to haue an office: that is to say / to be ordayned protectour of the soudyours: many of the citezins knewe nat his persone: bycause he was alway from the cite in warre & batayle: but his actes made his name well knowen. Wherfore after that the cōmenty vnderstode that he was Marius of whose nobles all Italy moch cōmuned & talked: anon they graunted his peticion / and proclamed hym protectour of the soudyours ouer all the prouinces & tribes of Italy. In that maistership & office he behaued hymselfe so well & wysely that after that he obtayned an other office of more worshyp and authorite: and after that agayne an other of hyer dignite. And shortly to speke: in euery office and dignite he so behaued hymselfe that euery man thought and counted hym worthyer of more dignite and honour than he had. Howe beit for all these condicions: as honorable as he was: he durst neuer before desyre thoffice of consull of Rome tyll this tyme whan he had suche cōfort by his sacrifice. But whan he was thus warned and put in hope and confort / euer after he was hedelyng enclined to ambicion and couetyse of that dignite.
                     ¶At this season the cōmenty of Rome had all other offices among them or at their gyft and dystribucion. But the estates and noble men kept among them and in their handes the consulshyp yerely one succedyng other by election. So that of the commenty was none so noble nor excellent of dedes / but that was reputed vnworthy of that dignite / and as who sayth vyle and polluted. But whan Marius sawe and consydred

that the wordes and counsell of the enchauntour and preest which behelde his sacrifice pretended to the same poynt and conclusion as the desyre of his mynde moued hym longe before. Anone he came to his capitayne Metellus / besechyng hym to be dyscharged of the batayle tyll he myght go to Rome to thintent to desyre the consulshyppe of the senatours. But how beit that in this Metellus was vertu / glorie / worshyp / and all other thynges longynge to a good man plentifully ynoughe. Neuerthelesse of his courage and mynde was he sōwhat proude / despisyng & dysdaynyng other: whiche were nat come of so hy lynage as he was. But specially he was stately and proude of mynde: whiche is a cōmen vyce and myschefe among estates and gentylmen. Wherfore Metellus heryng this interprise of Marius / first of all was moued with the newelty of his peticion. For at that tyme were none wonte to speke for that dignite / but if they were come of a noble stocke. And so was nat Marius. And thus Metellus marueyled moche at his enterpryse: and who myght counsell hym therto: warnynge hym as vnder colour of amyte and frendshyppe / nat to presume vpon so contrary and vnlikely a thyng: nor to exalte his mynde so hy aboue fortune cōuenient for his state and cōdicion. Sayng also to hym that euery thing was nat to be coueyted nor desyred of euery man. And that it became hym well by reason to be cōtented / pleased and satisfied with that honour whiche he had & that was his owne / and nat to desyre thyngꝭ vnmete for his degre. And finally he exhorted & coūselled hym to beware to desyre yt thing of the Romayns which laufully might be denyed vnto hym: cōsydring and hauyng regarde to his lynage & auncet
                           •
                        y. ¶After Metellus had coūselled Marius with these wordes and other lyke: and that he coude nat tourne nor apease his mynde / he answered hym at last that assone as he coude cōueniētly (nat lettyng the besynesse of the cōmen wele) he wolde graūt his desyre & peticion. But after this whan Ma
                           •
                        ius desyred the same dyscharge importunely & often: he made hym answere sayng that he shulde nat make so great hast to Rome for that purpose for he shuld come tymely ynough to demaūde that dignite acōpanyed with the sonne of the same Metellus / whiche sonne shulde also go to Rome in tyme to come to demaūde of the senators the same dignite with Marius. This sonne of Metellus was at that tyme in the army of his father Metellus cōtinually exercisyng the feates of warre nat withstandynge that he was but .xx. yere of age. This answere of Metellus styred Marius agaynst hym with greuous yre & wrath / what for the honour whiche he desyred: and what for

the licence to depart / whiche he coude nat optayne of hym by no prayer nor request at his pleasure. In somoche that he enraged agaynst Metellus moued by desyre of that office and prouoked by yre / whiche two vices ambicion & yre counselled and impelled this Marius to moch yll agaynst the sayd Metellus / sparyng nouther worde nor dede whiche myght endamage or hynder hym / his honour and name. And that myght helpe or auaunce hymselfe by ambicion to come to the dignite whiche he desyred. He gouerned the soudyours which passed forthe the wynter vnder his gouernaunce nat as he ought to do: but suffred them to haue their pleasure to thintent therby to optayne their fauour and goodwyll in his enterprise. Also he spake often in blamyng Metellus / & proudly cōmendyng & exaltyng hymselfe vnto the marchantes of Rome: of whome was great resort and cōcours to the sayd cite of Vtica where Marius soiourned. And often tymes he boosted sayenge to them that if the one halfe of the army were graunted and cō
                        mytted to hym within fewe dayes he wolde behaue hymselfe that he wolde haue Iugurth in bondes and subiection. Fathermore he sayed to them in auancynge hymselfe that Metellus prolonged the batayle for the nonest / for a craft bycause he was a man pompous and desyrous of glorie & worshyp / vtterly reioysinge in authorite and gyuen to pride and affection of dignite: and bycause he knewe well that whyle the batayle continued he shuld be reputed in maner as a kyng / therfore he dyd his deuoyre the more to prolonge the warre to thende that in the meane tyme he myght exalte and magnify hymselfe. The wordes of Marius semed to the sayd marchā
                        tes certayne and true / and also as they thought (by suche informacion) moost expedient to the commen wayle that some newe capitayne were chosen / whiche shortly wolde finysshe that warre. For by long contynuance of the same warre: many of the sayd marchantes had wasted & spent moche of their substance and richesse. And also to such desyrefull myndes as they had / nothyng coude to fast be hasted or brought to ende.
                     ¶Moreouer at this season was in company of the romayne army a certayne Numidyan named Gauda / whiche was sonne of Manastaball: and neuewe vnto Massinissa. Micipsa in his testament ordayned that this Gauda shulde be seconde heyre of Numidy / after the deth of his two sonnes and of Iugurth. This Gauda was sore enfebled with dyseases and syckenesse: and for that cause his mynde was a lytell endulled and priuate of reason and memorie. Whyle this Gauda (as sayed is) was in the romayns army: he requyred of

Metellus to suffre hym to haue his seat and siege next vnto hym after the vse of kynges of Numidy. Also after that bycause of defence and garde of his body: he desyred that a company of soudyours of the romayns myght be graunted and assigned to hym. But Metellus extremely denyed bothe his peticions saynge for the first: that suche honour longed onely to them whome the romayns toke and named for kynges. And also for ye seconde peticion he sayd that it were an vnauysed and iniurious ordināce if the romayne soudyours were gyuen or assigned to the garde and seruice of a Numidyan / whiche was no kyng but a soudyour lyke many mo hyred for stypende. Whyle Gauda was displeased and angry with Metellus for denyeng of these his peticions: Marius came to hym and prouoked hym to reuenge the displeasure & iniury which the captayne had done to hym with his helpe & auauncemēt. This Gauda (as I haue sayd before) was of feble and vnstable mynde: and the mennes wytte was of lytell valoure by meanes of diseases which long had holden hym. Wherfore Marius with his elegant / fayre / and flateryng wordes at his owne pleasure induced hym & exalted his mynde sayeng that he was a kyng an excellent and great man: and also neuewe to the worthy & noble kyng Massinissa. Wherfore (sayd he) yf Iugurth were outher slayne or taken prisoner it wer lickely to cōe to that poynt: that the kyngdome of Numidy shulde be assigned & cōmytted to hym of the senatours without any tary or resystence: whiche thyng shulde shortely be brought to passe yf Marius hymselfe were creat consull in place of Metellus & than assigned to execute and finysshe the warre with Iugurth. Vnder this maner Marius counselled and induced bothe the sayd Gauda / the romayne knyghtes / the cōmen soudyours / and also the marchauntes and occupyers whiche were in the towne at that season wt many other whome he impelled with his wordes so: that some of them for loue whiche they had to Marius: And other some for great hope and desyre which they had to haue peace and cōcorde wrote to Rome to their kynsmen & frendes of the batayle of Numidy & that very sharpely agaynst Metellus desyring & besechyng them to labour at Rome withall their myght that Marius myght be elect consull and assigned to execute the warre of Numidy. And thus at Rome was the consulshyp desyred by many men with great fauour and very honest peticions for Marius. Also at that tyme had the sayd Marius this auauntage. For the cōmentie at that season deposed many of the states: & eralted such as were newe gentylmen after the lawe of one named Manlius which before had ben ꝓtectour of the cōmētie.

This Manlius ordeyned & inacted a lawe / that if any thyng were vngoodly done and agaynst ryght of the states beynge in any office or dignite: than he whiche so had done shulde be deposed of his office: and in his place some newe gentyll or actyue man of the cōmentie sette and deputed and so exalted. This lawe at those dayes was kept in effect and executed at Rome: wherfore euery thyng proceded prosperously to the purpose & profet of Marius. For (as I haue sayd before) in hym was no noblenesse of auncient lynage nor byrthe.
                     ¶But here wyll I leaue to speke of the ambicion of Marius and retourne to wryte of Iugurth: and howe he behaued hymselfe agaynst Metellus.
                  
                  
                     ¶Howe Iugurth renewed the warre agaynste Metellus / and how the numidyans inhabyters of the towne of Vacca by treason murdred the garnyson of romayns whiche Metellus had set in the same towne. ¶The .xl. chapyter.
                     
                        IN the meane tyme whan Iugurth had broken the cōposicion which he had before made with Metellus by coūsell of Bomilchar / and had cōcluded agayne to begyne the warre: than anone he prepared all thyngꝭ necessary to warre with great diligence. And wt great hast he assēbled an army. Moreouer he dayly troubled with thretnynges / or feare / or els with great rewardes: suche citees & townes as befor had forsaken hym & yelded themselfe to Metellus. So that he spared no polycie to make them to render themselfe agayne to hym. In such holdes & townes as were in his possession: he set garnyson and defence of men of warre. He renewed & bought agayne armour & wepyn / and all other thyngꝭ which he had lost before: or delyuerd to Metellus in hope of peace. He attysed vnto hym many of the romayns subgettes & bondemen: by promisyng to them their libertie. He also proued & attempted wt rewardes them: whome Metellus had set & assigned in garnyson / garde and defence of such places as he had wonne in Numidy: so that vtterly be suffred nothyng to be left quyet nor vnassayed: but by all maner meanes made prouysion for hymselfe mouyng & puttyng in profe euery thynge. But amonge all other thinhabitantes of the cite called Vacca (in whiche Metellus at begynynge had set his garnison: whan Iugurth first sought his peace of

Metellus) were desyred often of Iugurth and with great & importune instance exited to treason. In somoche that at last they assented to hym to cōspire agaynst the romayns. Thinhabitantes of the cite dyd nat yelde themselfe from Iugurth with their owne goodwyll: and namely thestates and rulers therof dyd neuer yelde them to Metellus saue faynedly. Wherfore specially they were the first that conspired agaynst hym secretely amonge themselfe. For why as it often happened the commentie and specially of the Numidiens were vnstable of mynde / vtterly enclined to sedicion and discorde couetous of newe thynges and changes: and contrary to rest and quyetnesse. But (as I haue sayd before) whan the chyfe of this cite had secretly concluded and apoynted their mater and treason amonge themselfe: agaynst the thyrde day they ordayned that the same thyrde day nexte after shulde be commaunded solem / holy / and worshypped ouer all the countrey of Affrike / and Numidy. Whiche day shewed and pretended by all similytude myrth / game / and sport: rather than any drede to the romayns whiche were in garde and gernison of the cyte. But the Numidyens full of prodicion and treason whan they sawe their tyme called vnto their houses all the chefe captayns and maister soudyours of the romayns whiche were in the towne. And also one named Turpilius: whome Metellus had ordayned to be his lyeutenant / prouost and chife capitayne of the towne: they enuited and called as yf it had ben to chere and feest them / one to one house / an other to an other. But this there was suche as the Scorpyon is wont to make: whiche whyle she maketh glad semblant with her mouthe mortally styngeth with the tayle: so this feest was a cloke to mortall treason. For whyle the romayns were in myddes of their daynties vnarmed suspectynge no paryll. All the Numidiens at a tokens gyuen and at one houre apoynted before / slewe eche one his geest whiche dyned with hym without fauoure: so that amonge them all escaped nat one / except the sayd Turpilius heed capitayne or lyeutenant of the towne. This done: all the Numidyens togyder set vpon the remenant of the cōmen soudyours whiche wandred and strayed abrode in the towne & in the stretes / dispersed abrode without any armour: as is wont on suche a day without order / feryng nor doutyng no daunger. Some of the cōmens whan thestates had made them pryue of this treason came also to helpe them / and some other ignorant of the mater sauyng that / that they had desyre and pleasure in suche murder inuaded the romayns also. For though they were ignorant of the counsell of this dede: yet the noyse or skirmysshe

and newelty of the mater pleased them ynough. The romayn soudyours were ignorant and incertayne of this vnprouided feare and cruell murder doutynge what was best to be done. Their ennemies cōpasynge them on euery syde letted them to go to the castell of the towne where their armoure and wepyn was: and the gates of the towne were shet on euery syde before this skyrmysshe began / wherby they were prohibyted to auoyde the towne. Moreouer women & children thrue downe vpon them stones / and other thynges that came next to hande from the wyndowes & hyest partes of their houses: stryuyng who myght throwe first & most. Thus this doutfull and vnprouided mychefe coude nat be eschued: nor they which were ryght worthy & strong soudyours were nat able to resyst the very cowardyse and feblenes of women and chyldren / whiche thrue downe vpon them. Thus both good and yll / worthy / & vnworthy / strong / & feble: were all slayne without difference. In this so great ieopardy: the Numidyens beyng mad and cruell in murdre / and the gates shette on euery syde: of all the romayns / or Italyens: onely Turpilius the captayne escaped without hurt of his body. Whyther it so happed by the fauour of his hoost whiche called hym to banket: or by some apoyntment of treason: or els by some other chance: it was nat knowen for certayn. But this was knowen that euer after as long as he lyued he was reputed for a vyle and a wretched cowarde & without credēce▪ bycause that in so great losse & myschefe he coūted it better to escape: and after to lyue / and dye in shame and rebuke: than manly to haue dyed in defence of the towne. And euer after to haue had an honorable name of a worthy capitayne.
                  
                  
                     ¶How Metellus destroyed the towne of Vacca and slewe all the inhabitauntes / in reuengynge their treason. And howe Tupilius lyeutenaunt or captayne of towne / was beheded at commaū
                        dement of Metellus. ¶The .xli. chap.
                     
                        WHan Metellus vnderstode of this lamentable chance / & treason downe at the towne of Vacca: his mynde was meruaylously greued / abasshed / & sadde withall. But to thintent that none shulde parceyue his heuynesse / he withdrue hymselfe frome company a lytell tyme: but after whan he had satisfied his mynde with teares / and secrete lamentacion. And whan his dolour was myxed with wrath

and displeasure agaynst that cruell dede: than hasted he hymselfe with great cure & diligence to go reuenge this iniurious and cruell treason. Anone he called forth a legion of soudyors whiche passed forthe the wynter with hym: and with them also as many horsmen of the Numidyens as he myght assemble whiche had forsaken Iugurth and fled to hym: whome he thought most trusty. His legion he arayed in lyght harnesse and easy armour to thintēt to spede the way more redely. And by cause he entended to go about this mater secretly: therfore priuely euyn with the sonne goyng downe / he toke his iournay & ꝓceded forwarde towarde Vacca: and laboured so that on the next day after about the thyrde houre he came with his cōpany into a certayne playne a lytell closed or cōpased about with small downys nat moch hyer than the extremitees of the valey. There called he togyder his soudyours whiche were wery for the great labour of their iourney: and longe way which they had gone. Insomoch that they refusyd to procede any farther. But Metellus conforted them sayeng that the towne of Vacca was no more but one myle thens. Wherfore he desyred them to suffre & endure the remenāt of their labour with pacyent myndes / but onely tyll reuenged the deth of the citezins & their felowes which were strong & worthy men: and very miserably murdred. Moreouer he shewed to them benygnely the great pray which was redy for them / if they wolde manly ꝓcede. Thus were their myndes exalted / cōforted / and enbolded with his wordes. Metellus seynst that: was glad & anone cōmaunded the horsmen to ꝓcede in the forward these horsmen were numidyens. And the fotemen he cōmaunded to kepe secrete their standerdes / conysances / and badges: and to go behynde vnder the shadowe of the horsemen as nere togyder as they myght: and so proceded he towarde the towne. ¶Whan the citezyns sawe an army approche and moue towarde them: at the begynnynge they thought it had ben Metellus (as it was in dede) and onone shytte the gates of the towne agaynst hym. But afterwarde whan they aduysed them well: and sawe that the company which approched made no deuastacion nor distruction by the feldes nor countrey as they went. And also whā they parceyued that the horsmen whiche were in the forwarde were Numidyens: agayne they thought that it was Iugurth with his company. Wherfore with great ioy they issued forthe of the towne to mete hym. Metellus anone parceyued their ignorance and gaue a token to his people to assayle them. The horsmen and fotemen knowynge the wyll of their captayne by blast of the trūpettes assayled and ouerthrue the cōmentie which came out of the cite

agaynst them disꝑsed ouer the feldes. Some of the romains ran to the gates of the towne & entred without resistence: and some toke & inuaded the towres of the walles maugre the kepars. Thus the dispeasure & yre whiche the romayns had for deth of their felowes: & the hope of prayes of the towne ouercame & excluded their werynes which they had in their iournay thyderwarde. Thus the inhabitantes of Vacca enioyed their treason but onely two dayes. For onely the space of two dayes cōtinued their falshode & crueltie vnreuenged. For that great & riche cyte was all gyuen to hauocke & murdre vtterly distroyed of the romayns: so that no creature escaped alyue to boost of their treason before cōmitted agaynst the romains whome they had so trayterously slayne within their cite. Turpilius lyetenant or captayne of the towne whiche (as I haue sayd before) escaped onely with his lyfe: was called before Metellus and cōmaunded to answere for hymselfe by what way or meanes he escaped / whyther by treason done to the towne / or by any other policy. But bycause he coude but simply excuse nor pourge hymselfe of that whiche was layed agaynst hym / he first was scourged & beaten: and after that his heed stryken of from his sholders / for that it was thought that if he had nat betrayed the cite he coude nat haue escaped more than any other. Farthermore that great dystruction of the romains was ascribed to his negligēce or treason. If this Turpilius had ben a romayn he shulde nat haue put to deth. For the lawe of Porcius prohibyted any citezine of Rome to be slayne: but if they cōmytted any great offence / the extreme punysshement by the lawe was to cōmyt them to exyle. But this Turpilius inioyed nat the priuyleges of this lawe: for asmoche as he was no citezyne of Rome / but an Italyan of the towne of Collace.
                  
                  
                     ¶Howe Bomylchar conspyred treason agaynst Iugurth and by what meanes this treason was discouered and Bomilchar with certayne other put to deth for the same. ¶The .xlii. chap.
                     
                        AT the same tyme Bomilchar (by whose counsell and mocyon Iugurth before had begon the cōposicion with Metellus / which he omitted and brake agayn for feare) was cōuersant with Iugurth / whiche alytell suspected this Bomilchar of treason. Wherfore he suspectyng hym agayne ymagyned newe policy agaynst Iugurth dayly sekynge & deuysing

some gyle to his dystruction and deth / so that in dyuerse deuyses there about his mynde wandred and was weryed both day & nyght. But whan he had assayed many wayes and that nothing came to purpose: he adioyned vnto hym an other cō
                        panyon named Nabdalsa / a noble man exalted & enhaunced with great rychesse: and moche beloued of his cōmentie and people of whome he had rule. This Nabdalsa was so well beloued with Iugurth / that often tymes he cōmytted to hym an army & power by hymselfe to execute all other thyngꝭ whiche longed to meane besynesse whyle Iugurth hymselfe was weryed or lette with other gretter thynges: wherby the sayd Nabdalsa had optayned great honour & gathered great rychesse. Thus at cōclusion: by apoyntemēt & counsell bothe of Bomilchar & of Nabdalsa a day was prefixed betwene them to execute their treason agaynst Iugurth. And in the meane tyme they ꝓuyded euery thyng to that purpose as the matter and case requyred. This apoyntmēt made: they bothe departed in sonder. Nabdalsa went to the army whiche Iugurth had cōmytted to hym for to tary with the same nere to those places where the romayns wyntred: to thintent that if the romayns wasted or distroyed the coūtrey. Nabdalsa with his cōpany shulde other prohibet them: or els so dystourbe them that they shulde nat escape vnreuenged. But whan the tyme apoynted drewe nere: than was Nabdalsa so abasshed for the gretnesse of the dede that he mette nat with Bomilchar at the day & tyme assigned. This his great feare letted all the mater. But whā Bomilchar was thus disapoynted of his partyng felowe he was greatly abasshed: neuerthelesse his mynde was moch desyrous to perfourme his enterprise. But agayne he was doutfull for this cowardouse fere of his cōpanyon: lest he wolde omytte their first apoyntment and counsell / and begyn some other newe apoyntmēt. Wherfore he sē

                         letters vnto hym by trusty frendes / and partyners of the same treason. In which letters he sharpely blamed the pacyence / delayeng / and cowardyse of Nabdalsa / and vnstablenesse of his mynde obtestyng and callyng vnto wytnes the goddes by whome he had sworne to ꝑfourme the sayd treason. Moreouer he warned hym that he sholde nat tourne to their dystruction and cō
                        fusyon: the great rewardes whiche they bothe myght haue of Metellus. Which thyng truly shuld fortune if Metellus hym selfe shulde bring Iugurth into captiuyte. Farthermore Bomylchar in the same letters gaue monicion to Nabdalsa that thende of Iugurth was nere come: and that it was nat possyble that he might long contynewe all thynges cōsydred. But than was the mater in hande whyther he shulde be destroyed

by them or els by Metellus. Wherfore he exhorted hym well to consyder in mynde whyther he had leuer betray hym / and therby optayne great fauour and rewardes: or els to leaue of tyll Metellus ouercame hym: and than to be put to deth also with hym.
                     ¶These exhortacions with other lyke were contayned in the letters of Bomilchar dyrected vnto Nabdalsa. But whan these letters were delyuerd: as chaunce was: Nabdalsa lay on his bed to recreate and refresshe his body weryed with labour and besynesse / which he had taken before. Whan Nabdalsa had red these letters and vnderstode the mynde of Bomilchar: first many deuyses entred his mynde and moch cure he had in musyng what was moost expedient to be done in the cause. But whyle he was in this study: sodenly he fell in a slombre and his wery membres desyring rest moued hym to fall in slepe. This Nabdalsa had a seruant longynge to hym whome he moche loued and trusted: in somoche that no besynesse nor coūsell he hydd nor kept secret from hym: this counsell of betrayng of Iugurth onely except. Whan this seruant vnderstode that the sayd letters were brought to his lorde he thought that he had nede of his counsell as he was wont and acustomed to haue in other maters: and anone entred in to the tent where his maister lay. And seyng hym fast in slepe he toke the letters whiche Nabdalsa had vnwysely layd aboue his heed vpon the pyllowe: and seyng by the superscripcion that the letter came from Bomilchar he redd it to thende. But whan he vnderstode the treason: in all hast he addressed hym with the same letter to Iugurth. Nabdalsa nat longe after awakenyd and myssed the letter / wherfore anone he enquyred who had ben there in his tent. But in short season came dyuers of his louers from Iugurth / which certifyed hym of all the mater as it was done. Nabdalsa first of all entended to pursue his accuser: but whan he perceyued that it was but in vayne so to do / consydring that he was all redy in the company of Iugurth: he went vnto Iugurth hymselfe to thintent to pacify and mytigate his displeasure & wrath. And sayd vnto hym that whan the sayd letters were first delyuerd vnto hym he had fully purposed nat to kepe them secret: but hymselfe to haue disclosed them to Iugurth. But whyle he was slepyng his false seruant (in hope to be aduansed therby) had preuented hym his purpose & done the same thyng which he himselfe had fully purposed to do. Farthermore wepyng he besought & required hym for all amyte and loue whiche had ben bytwene them & for all the faythfull seruice whiche he had done to hym in foretyme nat to haue hym suspected in so cruell a dede. Iugurth

answered to these requestes of Nabdalsa myldly & soberly lest any gretter variance myght ryse therof: but moche cōtrary to the disposicion of his mynd. For he thought otherwyse than he answered: howe beit he had well refrayned and alayed his wrath before wt the deth of Bomilchar / & of many other whome he knewe first deuisours & partynge felowes of that treason whome he had caused to be put to deth before the cōmyng of Nabdalsa: lest some batayle or other insurrection shuld haue ꝓceded of ye besinesse if they had lyued any lenger. ¶From this day forwarde Iugurth was neuer quyet day nor nyght: so that he trusted nouther place / nother man / nor tyme: but suspected & mystrusted euery thyng. His ennemies and his owne subgettes he dreded and suspected both in lyke & after one maner. He sherched & espyed euery place for drede of treason doutyng & suspectyng euery sound or noyse that he herde. He rested and lay some nyght in one place and some nyght in an other / and that in abiect & secrete places agaynst the honoure of his estate royall. Somtyme he rose from his bed in his slepe in myddes of the nyght and armed hymselfe cryng / enragyng / and violently smyting agaynst the walles of the chambre: as if he had ben in batayle. So that for the great drede of treason whiche he had / he toke no rest nother slepyng nor wakyng: but was violently vexed and fered lyke a mad man without reason or discression.

                        ¶But as I haue sayd longe before / the letters whiche were sende to Rome to the cōmens by fauourers of Marius were well accepted. For whan the cōmentie had ouersene them / and by them vnderstode the praysyng of Marius / & the dispraysyng of Metellus. They were all inclined vtterly to the auaū

But the lownes & vnnoblenes of Marius encreased to hym fauour specially of the cōmentie which were come of vnnoble blode / as he was. But the diligence & fauour of both the parties (that is to say of thestates which helde with Metellus: & of the cōmens that helde with Marius) dyd measure & gyde euery thynge rather than the good or yll disposicions of the two aduersaryes Metellus or Marius. For the commens to dy for it / concluded to exalte Marius. And the estates in the same maner laboured to kepe hym vnder bycause he was vnnoble borne / and to exalte none saue them which were come of noble progeny. Farthermore the maisters and heed officers of the cōmentie which loued debate at euery assemble and cō

But in dispisyng and accusyng Metellus they forgat nat to cōmende Marius / and exalt hym with wordes som what to moche: and more than he was worthy in many poyntes. In somoche that the people were so greatly enclyned to hym with their fauoure: that all the crafty men and labourers of the cite: and also of the countrey whiche had no lyuyng saue in the labour of their handes left their warke and b

And sette more by his auauncement and honour than by their owne profet or aduauntage / trustyng that after yf he optayned the sayd honoure: they shulde haue their lyuenge by hym. And thus shortly to speke the estates and noble men of Rome beynge sore astonyed / the consulshyp was cōmytted to Marius a newe gentylmen whose predecessours before hym to such dignite coude neuer attayne & were counted vnworthy. Thus that thynge whiche many yeres before that tyme coude neuer be done nor brought about: was nowe brought to effect: that is to say the consulshyp which was the most excellent dignite of Rome was nowe in handes of the commentie & cōmytted to a man of basse byrth. Shortly after this: the protectour of the cōmentie named Lucius Manlius

enquyred & demaunded of the people whome it wolde please them to sende into Numidy to finysshe the warre with Iugurgth. The most part of the cōmentie answered that Marius shulde haue that office & besynesse: how beit a lytell before that tyme the senatours had assigned by their ordinaunce the prouince of Numidy to Metellus for his worthy dedes: wherfore nowe this ordinaunce was frustrate & voyde. For the cōmentie wolde haue their statutes executed & fulfylled.

                        IN the meane tyme whyle the interprise of Marius proceded thus forwarde at Rome: Iugurth was sore troubled ī his mynde for many cōsideracions. First he consydred the losse of many whome he reputed for his frendes tyll before he knewe their treason of whom he had many put to deth and many other had fled from hym for feare / some to the romayns / and other some to Bocchus kynge of the mauriens. He called also to his mynde that without ministers an men of warre he was nat able to execute the warre: and more ouer he thought it ieopardous after so great falshode and treason of his olde f

                        endes to proue or assay the fidelite of newe. For these causes and mo lyke (as I haue sayd before) his mynde was driuen to and fro / variable & incertayne in diuers opynions. Insomoch that there was no maner thyng / no coūsell nor no maner man: that coude sufficiently satisfy nor please his mynde. He changed his iournayes and wayes euery day into sondry places for feare of treson. Somtyme he addressed hym towarde his ennemies: and anone after retourned into wodes & wyldernesses. Often tymes he had trust & cōfidence in flyght: and anone after put his trust in armour & batayle. He douted whyther he myght lesse trust to strength or trueth of his men which were with hym: so that what euer he purposed to do: or whyther so euer he intended / euery thynge was cōtrary to hym. But whyle Iugurth thus prolonged and taryed: sodenly Metellus with his army appered in his syght. Iugurth that parceyuyng: set in order and array his numidyēs aswell as he might aft the short tyme which he had therto. And immidyatly the armyes approched: and the batayle began. In that part of the batayle where Iugurth hymselfe

was: they stroue and resysted a lytell space: but all the other numidyens at the first brunt / concourse or assaut were put to flyght with violence / and driuen backwarde. The romayns toke some of their standerdes and armour / which they fleyng away left behynde them: but of their ennemies they toke but fewe. For the Numidiens in that batayle and almoost in all other defended themselfe better with their fete: thā with their handes or armoure. Iugurth at this tyme: mystrusted his case moche more than at any other tyme euer before / for the cowardous withdrawyng of his people. Wherfore he acōpanyed hymselfe with the romayns which had forsaken and betrayed Metellus / & fled to hym. With them / and with a part of his horsmen he fled into the wyldernesses therby: and from thens vnto a towne named Thala / which was a great towne & a rich
                           •
                        : and moch of his treasour & of the aparell longyng to the yongth of his yong chyldren was in the same towne. But whan Metellus vnderstode that Iugurth was fled to so ryche a towne / how beit he knewe that bytwene the towne and the next flod therto was .l. mylespace of dry groūd voyde & without habitacion: neuerthelesse he toke in hande to ouercome all sharpnesse and difficultie of places: and also to ouercome nature / though it semed impossible to mannes mynde. This thynge Metellus toke in hande in hope to fynisshe the batayle moche soner yf he myght wynne that towne.
                     ¶Wherfore he cōmaunded that all the beestes whiche serued for cariage / shulde be vnladen of all suche baggage and burthens as they caried longynge to the soudyours: saue onely whete and vitayle for the space of .x. dayes. Also he cōmaūded some of the beestes to be laded with bottels full of water / and other vessels mete to be caryed with water. Moreouer: ouer all the contrey he gathered togyder as many tame beestes as he coude get and them laded with empty vessels of euery sort. Many of them were treen vessell which he had done to be gathered among the villages of the Numidiens. Farthermore he cōmaunded thinhabitantes of those marches whiche after the flight of Iugurth had yelded them to hym that they shuld make them redy to folowe the hoost euery man with asmoche water as they myght beare. And assigned them a daye and place / where they shulde be redy vnder payne of dethe. Whan Metellus was come to the sayd flod whiche was fyfty myle from the towne of Thala and nerest water therto (as I haue sayd before) he dyd all the beestes to be laded of the same water. And so went towarde Thala / his hoost set in order and aray: so that yf any ieopardy apered he was euer redy at defēce / but afterwarde whan he was come to that place where

he had apoynted the numidiens to mete hym with the water wherwith they were laded and folowed the hoost. And whan his tentes were pytched / sette / and defended about with trenches / cutte trees / bowes / and stakes after the policy of warre: sodenly from the heuen descended great violence and plenty of rayne water that it was more than sufficiently to all the army aswel to men as beestes. Moreouer their vitels were more plētyfull than they trusted or loked after. For the numidiēs which newly were yelded were somoche the more seruisable and redy to mynistre euery thynge necessary vnto the army. And no maruell: for euery thyng is quycke at the begynnyng which often fadeth at the ende. But the soudyours and men of warre: wer more glad to ocupy the rayne water for deuocion / than suche water whiche was brought vnto them in vessels by caryage. For they supposed that their goddes loued and fauoured them whiche in so drye a countrey / and in suche a chaūce sent to them so great plenty of water besyde prouision of ther captayne. This thyng greatly conforted the myndes of them all: and incouraged them with boldnesse / strength / & diligence: to ouercome all difficulties whiche remayned. This confort kyndlyng their myndes: they spedde themselfe so forwarde that on the next day aft they came vnto the towne of Thala: cōtrary vnto the opinion or knoledge of Iugurth. Thinhabitantes which thought themselfe surely defended by the sharpnesse and difficultie of the place / were sodenly abasshed & astonyed for that great vnwont and vnprouided case. Neuerthelesse they made prouision to batayle as quyckely as they myght by sufferaūce of the tyme. The romayns addressed them in the same maner. But the kynge Iugurth anone cast in his mynde that to Metellus was nothing vnprouided nor vnable to be done: as he that by his craft / diligence / and polycie: had ouercome both wepen / armour / place / and tyme. And also nature itselfe: whiche ruleth other thynges longyng vnto men. Iugurth this aduysing & reuoluyng in his mynde fled priuely by nyght forth of the towne with his children and a great part of his treasour. Nor after this tyme he neuer taryed in one place past the space of a daye or of one nyght faynyng that he fled so from one place to an other bycause of his present besynesse: but the ryght cause of his remouynge was for that he feared treason which he thought best to auoyd and eschue by continuall chaungyng of places. For suche counsels of treason can nat be taken without deliberacion and processe of tyme / and conueniens or oportunyte of places where princes dothe long so iourne and continue.
                     ¶But whan Metellus sawe that thinhabitantes were redy

to batayle / and also that the towne was strongly defended bothe by crafte of mannes handes and by nature of the place. Anone he compased about the towne on euery syde with profounde dychesse / trenches / and herdels: of sharpe stakes the poyntes vpwarde to thentent that none of thinhabytantes shuld breke out nor escape by night / as Iugurth had done before: nor that no vitels shulde be conuayed into them / wherby they myght the lengar resyst hym and indure the sege. Afterwarde he cōmaunded scaffoldes to be made about the walles specially in suche places as were moost conuenient: and pentyses of sheldes conioyned in maner of vynes to be driuen to the walles vpon wheles. And aboue the sayd scaffoldes to be cast a hepe of grauell and stones: and toures of tymbre and bulwarkes set vpon them: and other soudyours he assigned to defende the warke / and them also that laboured therevpon. These scaffoldes / pentyses / and pauases: were made to thentent that vnder them the romayns might vndermine the walles without great paryll or dammage. On the othersyde / the garnyson and inhabitantes hastely laboured to resyst the romayns & to defende themselfe and their towne manfully. So that on bothe parties was nothyng forgoten / able to be done touchyng their defence. But brefely to speke the romayns weryed with moch labour and batayle .xl. dayes after they were cōe thyder: at last wan the towne. But all the pray and riches of the towne was distroyed by them whiche were within the towne in garnyson: of the romayns / whiche had fled from Metellus to Iugurth: which specially had assigned them to defende the towne. These traytours whan they sawe the walles vndermined & brused with diuerse ingens of batayle: and their fortune was brought to extremite: and no socours nor hope remayned. Than they assembled & caried togyder all the treasour & riches of the towne / as golde / syluer / with other precious ornamentes or iewels into the palays of Iugurth / & there fylled themselfe with wyne and other delycate meates. And at cōclusion whan they were full saturate and ingorged: they sette fyre on the palays and wylfully brent and distroyed the richesse / the palays / and themselfe withall. So that suche punysshement as they dreded to suffre of their ennemies they voluntarily suffred the same with their owne hādes to auoyd the subieccion and daunger of their ennemies: by desperate folly and presumptuous madnesse.

                        AT the same tyme whanne Thala was wonne of the romayns / embassadors cāe frō a towne of Numidy named Leptis vnto Metellus / requirynge hym to sende thyder socours of garnison & a capitayne to defende them from the oppression and iniury of a certayne noble and debatefull man / which was within that cyte named Amylchar which (as they sayd) cōtinually laboured for newe changꝭ excityng and mouyng the cōmen people to forsake the romayns agayne. In so moch that agaynst the sayd Amylchar no man was able to resyst nor to preuayle: for he set nought by cōmaūdemēt of their officers and rulers / nor yet by the auncient lawes of their cite At cōclusion these embassadors sayd to Metellus for a surete that except he graunted their peticion that bothe their owne helthe / and also the frendes & louers of thempire whiche were within that cite shulde be in great danger and paryll. ¶These Leptitans at begynnyng of this warre of Iugurth requyred frendshyppe with the romayns of Calphurnius of whome is made mencion in begynnyng of this hystorie. And after that they sende to Rome vnto all the senatours requyryng the same amyte and peace to be confermed of them: whiche thynge was graunted to them gladly. Therfore from thenfforth they euer contynued good and faythfull to the romayns: and worthely and substācially dyd euery thyng whiche was cōmaunded vnto them by Calphurnius / by Albinus or by Metellus. For this consyderacion they lyghtly optayned all their desyre of Metellus / whiche at their request sent forth with them vnto the sayd towne of Leptis: foure cohortes of lombardes chosen out of all his army with whome he sent to be captayne ouer them a noble knyght of his army named Caius Annius / whome he also assigned to be lyeutenant of the towne.
                     ¶This towne of Leptis was buylded first of all by the Sidonians which (as we rede) fled from their owne contrey for discorde and variance which fell among their cities at home. Which Sidonians came in shyppes into the coostes of Affrike: where at last they buylded this cite of Leptes / which is situate bytwene two quickesandes of whome the cite hath his name.

Of which two breekes those partes which be nerest vnto the land ar very profounde and depe with hye bankes of sande on euery syde. But the other places nat nere vnto the lande be somtyme depe: somtyme shalowe after the dysposytion of the wether. For whan the see begynneth in ragyng to be great and tempestyous by mouynge of the wynde than the waues of ye see draweth forth of the same places the slyme / grauell / and great stones: which in cawine wether were gathered togyder before in the same places.

For this place of our hystorie so requireth. ¶What tyme the Carthaginēses had in possession and were lordes ouer the moost part of Affryke: at the same season the Cirenenses also were great and famous of name: and abundant of welth and richesse. Than betwene the coostes of these two cities was a great & large felde all ouer spred with sande without diuision / perticion / or difference. But bytwene them

But after that many armies on both sydes wer ouercome / slayne / or put to flyght both by lande & by see and whan both peoples had somwhat wasted the one the other by spoylyng & murdre: than began they to perceyue their owne foly on both partes feryng lest some other nacion anone after shuld assayle them both the ouercomers and them that were ouercome whan they were wasted & weryed with batayls and brought to extremite: Wherfore this cōsydred: they toke truys bytwene them bothe & to auoyed that long variance bytwene them: they made agremēt & cōuenant that messangers or embassadours of bothe parties shulde depart out of their cities at one certayne day and houre assigned. And that same place where the messangers of both the cities shulde mete togyder: shulde be for euer after taken for the boundes and marches of the coūtrey / of both the nacions & cities without more contencion or variance. To bryng this apoyntmēt to effect & conclusyon forth of the cite of Cyren were chosen two for their part and sende forth at the day & houre apoynted. And in lykewyse out of Carthage were send two breterne / eche of them named Phylene which swyftly sped them in their iourney. But the Cyrenēses went moch more slowly whether it so fortuned by negligēce or chaūche I knowe but lytell the trueth. But this is knowen for certayne that about those coostes tempeste of wynde & weder is wont to let men and ꝓlong their iourney in lykewyse as vpon the see: and that for this cause. For whan by those euyn places wyde / & bare wtout any thing growynge on them: the wynde ryseth & styreth the small sande from the groūde: the same sande moued by great violence of the wynd is wont to fyll the faces / mouthes and eyen of such as passeth that way with dust & sande. And thus often by lettyng of their syght: their iournay is ꝓlonged & hyndred. But after whan the Cyrenenses sawe themselfe somwhat ouerflowe & late in their iournay: they fered punysshement at their retournynge home for their negligēce. And blamyng they accused the Carthaginenses obiectyng & sayeng that they had come forth of their cite before the tyme assigned: and thus they troubled all the mater & brake the ordynance. But shortly to speke these Cirenenses cōcluded rather to suffre deth and to do any thynge possible than to retourne home agayn ouercōe. Wherfore the Carthaginenses desyred some other cōdicion or apoyntment to be made indifferēt & equall bytwene both the parties. The Cirenēses cōsented therto & put the Carthaginēses in choyse

whyther they wold be quicke buryed in that same place whiche they desyred for their marches and boūdes: or els that the Cirenenses vnder the same cōdicion shulde ꝓcede forwarde to that place whiche they desyred for their marches and there to be quicke buryed vnder the same maner. The .ii. bretherne both named Phylene alowed and graunted the cōdicion subduyng & abandonyng their bodyes to deth for the profet and wele of their contrey & cite of Carthage: and so were they buryed quicke. Wherfore the Carthaginenses in the same place where they were buryed raysed & halowed .ii. auters in worshyp & remēbrance of these two brethern which set more by encrese of their contrey: than by their owne lyues. These auters to this presēt day be called the Phylene auts after the name of the .ii. brethern named Phylenis therunder buryed / as sayd is for wele of their contrey: also besyde this memorial wtin the cite of Carthage were many other thingꝭ ordayned to ye gret honour of them & remembrance of their worthy dede. ¶But nowe wyll I leaue this mater & reteurne to my purpose.

                        WHan Iugurth had lost the citie of Thala / one of the strongest cities of his lande (as sayd is before) than he consydred well that in all his kyngdome was no place stronge ynough to resyst the myght of Metellus. Wherfore he hasted hym with a small cōpany through desertes and great wyldernesse fleyng from his owne contrey. And at last he came to the lande of Getulians whiche is a maner of people rude / wylde / & without order or maners: and at that season nought knowyng of the preemynēt honour & fame of the romayne empire. Of this people Iugurth assembled a multitude togyder and by lytell & lytell enduced & taught them by custome and exercyse to folowe the order of chyualry: to kepe array / to insue their standerdes / to obey the cōmaundementes of their capitayns / to discerne and haue knowlege of the signifiaunce of soundes of trumpettes: and to obserue all other poyntes belongyng to warfare & chyualry. These thyngꝭ with otherlike necessary to batayle / Iugurth ceassed nat to prepare and ordayne with all diligence.
                     
                        ¶Moreouer he prouoked vnto his fauour and felowshyp by great rewardes & moch gretter promises suche as were most nere frendes to Bocchus kyng of the mauriēs: by whose helpe he hymselfe went to the kyng Bocchus & moche desyred hym in his quarell with hym to warre agaynst the romayns. To this request of Iugurth Bocchus agreed somoch the more for asmoche as at first begynnynge of the same warre: this Bocchus sent vnto Rome embassadours to desyre of the romayns amyte and a bonde of cōtinuall peace bytwene hym & them. But nat withstandyng that this peticion & peace was moche expediēt necessary to the romayns for diuerse cōsideracions and namely bycause of this warre. Nat the lesse it was nat graūted by meane of a fewe such as at Rome blynded wt auarice: were wont to sell for money euery thyng both honest and dishonest. Also befor this tyme the doughter of Iugurth was spoused to the sayed Bocchus. But this bonde of frendshyp of affinite among the numidīes / & mauriens: is reputed but of effect: bycause they ar wont euery man to haue diuerse & many wyues acordyng to their substāce & richesse. Some .x. and some mo: after as they ar of abylite or power to mētayne. But the kyngꝭ bycause they ar of most power & substāce: therfore haue they mo than an other. Thus is their mynde and fauour distract & diuersly deuyded from all their wyues for the multitude of thē: and bycause they haue so many so that they reserue none for their speciall bed felowe. Wherfore they all ar reputed vyle / & lytell set by: after one maner. Thus the affinite bytwene these two kyngꝭ Iugurth & Bocchus / was lytell set by and small thyng auayled in this besynesse. Nat withstandynge both they & their hoostes cāe togyder in a place apoynted therto: where after that they had gyuen & taken fayth and trueth one to other of fidelite / to be obserued bytwene them Iugurth greatly inhaūced & lyfted vp the mynde of Bocchus with his wordes sayeng that the romains were iniust grounded in auarice without suffisance or measure. And cōmen ennemies to euery man and to euery contrey: and that they had asmoch quarell agaynst Bocchus / as agaynst hym. And one selfe cause to warre agaynst them both: and also agaynst many other nacions / whiche cause was but onely the pleasure of great lordshyp & riches. So that for the same cause all kyngdomes to thē were aduers & cōtrary / and that he hymselfe to them was enmy for the same cause. And nat longe before that tyme the Carthaginēses: and aftwarde Perses kyng of Macedony were subdued & vndone by the romayns without any iust tytle or cause of batyle: saue onely ambicion & enuy whiche the romayns had agaynst them. And that in tyme to come

euery nacyon whiche shulde haue welth and richesse shuld become ennemies to the romayns for their inordynat pride / & in saciable couetyse.
                     ¶With these wordes and otherlyke Iugurth moued the mynde of Bocchus agaynst the romayns. In somoche that anone a day was apoynted bytwene bothe the kynges to procede forth togyder to the towne of Cyrtha / and to assayle the same with both their powers conioyned. This towne they purposed first of all to besige: bycause Metellus had left with in the same towne his prayes and prisoners which he had taken of Iugurth. And also moche of his owne ordynaūce had he left there to a voyde impedyment in his voyage. Thus Iugurth thought most expedient to do. For if the myght wyn the towne by assaut before the rescous of Metellus: he thought that shuld be moost to his honour and profet. Or els yf the romayne capitayne Metellus / and his army shulde come to socours of the towne: than thought he that there both hymselfe and Bocchus shuld gyue batayle to Metellus. Iugurth for craft and subtylte hasted hereto somoche the more to tangle Bocchus in the warre before any place shulde be moued bytwene hym & the romayns.

                        sell and aduisement. For Iugurth suspected at begynnynge that Metellus in processe of tyme wolde desyre this Bocchus nat to medyll in this warre assistyng the part of Iugurth nor mentayning his cause.
                  
                  
                     ¶Howe Metellus vsed hymselfe herynge that these two kynges were confederat agaynst hym and how after he was certifyed that the prouynce of Numidy was assigned to Marius the new consull: he c

                        ssed the warre for the nones. ¶The .xlviii. chapyter.
                     
                        WHanne Metellus knewe that the two kynges were associate togyder: he thought nat to fyght with them rasshely without prouisyon: nor in euery place for his aduantage or nat as he was wont to do often tymes before after the first tyme that he had ouercome Iugurth. But within his feldes well and surely defended he kept hymselfe abydinge the commynge of the two kynges: and that nat farre from the towne

of Cirtha. This dyd he thynking it best to know the myght / maners / and cōdicions of the mauriens first or he wold fight with them / bycause they were but newe ennemies and therfore their maners vnknowen to hym. And whan he sawe his best auantage than thought he to gyue them batayle.
                     ¶In the meane tyme whyle Metellus taryed the commyng of the two kynges: letters were brought vnto hym from Rome: which certifyed hym that the prouince of Numidy / was cōmytted and gyuen to Marius the newe consull. For he had herde longe before this tyme that the sayd Marius was elect cōsull: but this was the first tyme that he vnderstode the prouince of Numidy cōmitted to hym. For this cause was Metellus moued & displeased moch more than longed to measure or honesty. In somoch that he coud neyther refrayne his eyen from wepyng nor measure his tong from spekyng yll by Marius. This Metellus was a synguler noble and worthy man in all other condicions: but the displeasure of his mynde he toke ouer womanly & tenderly to his hert / and namely in this cause. Which condicion: some reputed to procede of a proude hert of Metellus. And other some thought it no meruayle though his noble hert were moued and kyndled with anger / for this iniury and wrong done to hym. And many sayd that Metellus toke so great sorowe and displeasure: bycause the victorie which he had almoost optayned shulde be pulled out of his handes his selfe hauyng the labour and paryll / and an other man the tryumphe and honour. But to be playne in the mater and indifferently to write: it was nat vnknowen to the wysest romayns / but that the dignite / auauncement / an honour of Marius greued Metellus: moch more than dyd his owne iniury. And that he wolde nat haue taken it so heuely if the prouince of Numidy which was taken from hym had ben gyuen to any other noble men thā to Marius. Wherfore Metellus was let from his first besynesse for the sayd displeasure so that he purposed nat to vexe hymselfe from thensforth with out thanke or profet. And also he thought it foly to take in hande the charge of another mannes mater to his owne paryll / labour / and payne. Wherfore he send messangers to the kyng Bocchus / desyring hym nat to become ennemy to the romayns without occasion. And sayeng that he was as yet in suche case that he myght adioyne with the romayns felowshyp loue / and amyte: which shulde be moche better to hym & more profitable than batayle. And howbeit he trusted gretly in his power / richesse / and treasour: yet ought he nat to change certayne thynges / for thynges incertayne. For euery batayle to begyn is easy and lyght: but it is ver

                         harde thynge to ende

the same whan it is ones begon. The begynning and endynge therof: is nat alway in the power of one same man. For warre may be / begon of a coward or of any other wretch: but it can nat be left of agayne / nor ceassed but whan it pleaseth hym which is strongest / and is maister hauynge the vpper hande. And finally he had hym better to prouide for hymselfe and for his kyngdome than he began to do: and nat to adioyne nor myngle his goodes / treasour / & fortune: which were in estate royall florisshyng with the goodes and fortune of Iugurth: which were lost and distroyed to the vttermost. The embassadours of Metellus came to kyng Bocchus & shewed hym their capitayns wyll: as is sayd before vnder suche sentence. To the whiche wordes of Metellus / Bocchus answered agayne benignely and mekely ynough sayng that he desyred nothyng more than peace: saue that he had pyte & compassion of the aduers & miserable fortune of Iugurth / but if the same Iugurth myght be suffred also to haue frendshyp and amyte with the romayns & forgyuenesse: than sayd Bocchus that he wolde gladly agre to euery thynge desyred of Metellus / and euery thyng shuld be accorded bytwene them. The capitayne Metellus heryng this answere of Bocchus: agayne sent messangers to hym replyeng agaynst his requestes and sayenge that some of his peticions were agaynst iustice & reason: also Metellus by these embassadours desyred many other thyngꝭ of Bocchus / of whome Bocchus graunted & alowed some: and other some of them he denyed. After this maner the tyme ouerpassed and proceded forth / massangers often goyng and cōmynge bytwene them bothe: so that by suche maner the warre and batayle remayned vntouched and depended nat medled with: as Metellus dyd greatly coueyt and desyre in mynde bycause he wolde kepe sure that laude which he had wonne: and also for that to his owne paryll & dammage he wolde nat auantage nor auance Marius: in thynge whiche to hym belonged.
                     ¶But here wyll I leaue to speke of Metellus / and retourne to speke of Marius whiche contrary to the wyll of all the noble men of Rome was creat consull by fauour of the cōmens: lykewyse as I haue writen before.
                  
                  
                     ¶Of the great ordynaūce and preparacyon whiche Marius the newe cōsull made agaynst Iugurth and for the warre of Numidy. ¶The .xlix. Chapyter.
                     
                        
                        BVt Marius (as I haue sayde before) was elect consull / at great desyre and instaūce of the cōmen people: whiche also cōmytted to hym the prouince of Numidy. Marius seyng hymselfe thus auanced: where he was euer agaynst the noble men of Rome before / nowe was he specially fiers of mynde / and stately. And besy to displease and hurt the states: some tyme one by one / and other whyle altogyder. He often tymes boosted & sayd that he had goten the consulshyp of them maugre their wyll / as if it were a pray or spoylingꝭ goten of his ennemies: and of men ouercome. Many other boostynge wordes spake he to his owne commendacion / and to great displeasure and anger vnto the estates of Rome. But in the meane tyme he forgat nat to prepare euery thyng necessary to the warre: wherof the charge rested on hym to execute the same agaynst Iugurth from thensforth. He demaūded of the senatours & cōmens newe supplement of soudyours to repare and restore the army which was in Numidy with Metellus. For many of them were slayne / and many deed of sickenesse: thus was the army sore deminisshed. He called also for socors of suche nacions as marched to thempire. And of kyngꝭ whiche were cōfederate and had conioyned felowshyp with the romayns. Moreouer he raysed vp in Italy and nere about Rome / as many as were strongest & bolde mennes bodyes. And namely such as he hymselfe had proued before in warre: and suche as in warfare were proued by dedes: and nat suche as were boosted by fame. And namely olde soudyours which had longe haunted the warre and were pardoned therof. So that it was in the power of no man to cōstrayn them to warre without their owne fre assent: bycause that they had cōtinued styll in warre the season to them assigned of their captayns. These treated Marius with so fayre flateryng and paynted wordes / that they were redy to go with hym in warfare. And how beit that the senatours were contrary to hym: yet durst they nothyng deny vnto hym belongyng to his besynesse: but gladly and with good wyll they decreed that he shulde rayse and chuse soudyours to fulfyll the nombre of them which wer lost in batayle in the contrey of Numidy. But this dyd they for no gret loue which they had to Marius: for they thought that he shuld lese outher the execucion of the batayle which he intended with Iugurth: or els the fauour of the people which wold refuse to go forth to warre. So that if Marius cōstrayned them: their olde loue myght tourne into newe malyce and hatered agaynst hym. But this thyng was trusted but in vayne of the senatours: for the moost part of the cōmens had

an inestimable desyre to go to batayle with Marius. For euery man cast in his mynde to be inriched by prayes & spoylynges of warre. And that more is: to retourne home agayne victours with moche honour and triumphe. These thynges and otherlyke: they consydred / whiche caused them gladly to folowe Marius / and also Marius dyd nat a lytell enbolde & confort their myndes with his exhortacion. For whan euery thyng which he desyred of the senatours was confermed and decreed by them. And whan Marius shuld assemble his soudyours: he thought to put them in confort by exhortacion / and also to trouble & displease the states of Rome as he was wont to do: and to chafe their myndes. Wherfore he assembled and called togyder a great company of the commen people / and spake to them by exhortacion and confortynge of them as herafter ensueth.

                        RIght worthy cytezins / I knowe well that many of these estates of aunciēt name haue nat themselfe behaued after one maner of cōdicion in desyring of you honorable dignities and great offices: and in administracion and gouernynge of them after they haue optayned the same of you. For whyle they make their peticions: at begynnyng they be dyligent / seruiable / meke / and curtayse of behauoure. But whan they haue optayned their desyre: than passe they their tyme in slouth / ydelnes / and pride. But it semeth to me in my mynde that they ought to do moche contrarely. For of howe moch more valour the hole cōmen wayle is: than is the cōsulshyp / thoffice of the hy iudge / or any other great office: with somoche more diligence & charge shulde the hole cōmen wele be gouerned / than suche dignities or offices desyred of you. Nor I am nat ignorant but knowe right well how great the benefite is that ye haue gyuen to me: and howe great charge and besynesse therto belōgyng is layed vpon me withall: whiche besynes I nedes must sustayne. That is to say: to prepare

and make redy an army / withall other thynges necessary to batayle and to execute the same: & neuertheles to spare the cōmen treasour. To compell to warfare and batayle: suche as a man wolde nat greue nor displease: that is you the cōmentie of Rome: whome I wolde nat displease by any meanes. To take charge and care for euery thyng within the cite and without. And to do such thynges among enuious gentylmen obiectyng and layeng agaynst me in euery thynge whiche I go about / as men full of discorde and variance. Verily noble citezins among suche men to take in hande suche charges it is more harde and thynge of more dyfficultie / than any man can thynke or deuyse. And moreouer: as for other cōsuls whiche haue ben before my tyme / whan they haue done any thynge amysse: than their olde noblenesse / the strong and valyant actes of their predecessors / the riches & power of their frendes and kynsmen: and their many clyentes and seruantꝭ of them retayned: all these haue supported and mentayned them in their mysdedes. But all my richesse and helpe / and trust of confort which I haue / is in my selfe & nat in my kynsmen or other fauourers: which ayde of my selfe I must of necessite defende with my vertue / strenght / and innocence. For all other thynges which these auncient noble men haue to defende them be vnsure to me for I haue them nat. Farthermore noble citezins this I vnderstande that all ye haue good trust and confidence in me: and that all such as be equall / iust / and good: haue fauour vnto me. For I knowell that my good dedes hath profited the commen wayle. And neuerthelesse these noble men seke occasions agaynst me / inuadyng and assaylyng me with their malice and enuy. Wherfore it standeth me in hande of necessite to labour somoche the more besely and quickely: that neyther ye be disceyued in this great trust whiche ye haue in me: and also that all the purposes of myne ylwyllers & aduersaries / may be frustrate and nothyng auayle agaynst me. Forsoth I haue euer from my chyldhode vnto this age ben of suche behauour that I haue ben acustomed & exercysed in all maner labours and paryls: whiche I suffred and toke paciently for the cōmen wele without any rewarde before this your benefite and honour whiche ye haue nowe gyuen to me. Wherfore worthy citezins seyng yt ye haue now rewarded me better than I am worthy: I haue nat purposed to desyst nor leaue of myne olde good wyll anenst ye cōmen wele: nor now I / rewarded of you purpose nat to omyt my good dedes which I dyd frely before vnrewarded. But touchyng these aunciēt gentylmen: it is very hard for thē to temper themselfe beyng in power or dignite which onely dyd but

fayne themselfe good and honest before they optayned promocyon / to thintent to come therby to honoure and dignite. But where as I haue passed all my lyfe in right good occupaciōs by cōtinuall custome it is roted in me to do well: & this custome is tourned with me into nature. Treuth it is: that ye haue cōmaunded me to warre agaynst Iugurth: whiche thynge these noble men taketh very greuously. I require you consyder and dyscus in your myndes and in your inwarde consideracion / ponder ye: whyther it be better / more necessary and expedient to change the same your commaundemēt agayne: and to sende forth some other of that sort of auncient gentilmen vnto this besynesse agaynst Iugurth or els to any other lyke. Send forth a noble man of olde auncetry: in honoure and remembrance of whome many ymages may be made & erect or set vp on hy. But of polycie of chyualry or warfare is he vtterly ignorant and inexpert. Wyll ye change your purpose and sende forth suche one to warfare at pleasure of these gentylmen / as who sayeth: that is best to be done for this cause. To thintent that in so great a mater and wighty besynesse: suche a captayne more ignorant and ferefull than any of all his soudyours / shalbe chosen of you whiche anone after shal chuse forth agayne some one of the commen people to be his maister: to informe and teche hym in suche besynesse as to his office and charge belongeth: hymselfe beyng ignorant of euery thyng necessary to be done. By this meane it often fortuneth: that he whome ye ordayne to be captayne and cōmaunder of your army: dothe chose an other to be captayne and commaunder ouer hymselfe. In somoche that (if ye indifferently iudge) he: whome ye chose for capitayne is moch more mete to be made a symple soudyours / than a capitaynr ouer other. And also worthy citezins: I knowe some of these noble men so farre out of order that whan they haue ben made consuls: than haue they gyuen themselfe to redyng of the actes of their elders and predecessours. And of the grekes preceptes of chyualry: which doutlesse may well be called men without order / for this cōsyderacion. For they shuld by due order first lerne to rule their office before they shulde take vpon them the charge therof. But they do contrary. First they take charge of office and than after lerne to rule it by way īordinate: howbeit euery wyseman wyll first lerne to gouerne an office before he desyre it or take vpon hym the rule therof. But these estates contrarily demeane themselfe. Thus worthy citezins cō
                        pare me a newe gentylman with their immoderate pride and take diligent considercion whiche is best: to be nat gentyll of byrth and lowly and gentyll of maners: or els to be gentyll of

blode / and proude and vngentyll of maners. Of suche thynges as they be wont to here & to rede: some haue I sene / and some I my selfe haue done. I haue lerned that by excercyse of chyualrie / which they haue lerned by redyng. Nowe iudge & cōsyder ye: whyther is better of dedes or warkes: of redynge and doyng. They dispyce my neweltie of honour & vnnoble lynage: and I dispyce the vncraftynesse & slouth of them. My happy fortune is obiected of them agaynst me as to rebuke: but shame and dishonest behauour / may be obiected & layed agaynst them in rebuke. Is it nat trueth that euery man is come of one lyke nature. I cōsyder & knowe well that one man is nat better nor more noble than an other: but if it be by his wysdome / good maners / vertu / and strength. And I cōsyder well that euery man the more that he is endued with vertue: the more excellēt & noble is he. Thus is the strongest / wysest / and moost vertuous / moost excellent in noblenesse.
                     ¶But yf the fathers of Albinus / and of Calphurnius: la
                           •
                        e consuls and captayns in Numidy / to the great dishonoure and damage of this empire / were nowe lyueng that it myght be inquyred of them whether they had leuer that I had bene begotten of them: or els the sayd Albinus and Calphurnius? What thynke ye they wolde answere? Forsoth nought els (as I suppose) but that they wolde desyre and couet good chyldren and honorable lynage to procede of their stocke and generacion. Thus syth it is so: that these estates dispyseth me: reasonably and of ryght lette them also dispyce their owne predecessours and forefathers / of whose stocke and lynage they proceded: which came to noblenes and honour: nat by their auncetry: but by their owne strength / wysdome / and vertue: lykewyse as I haue done. They haue enuy at this myne honour. Than lette them also haue enuy at my labours taken for defence of the cōmen wayle: let them enuy myne innocēce and great peryls / which I haue ouercōe. For by these meanes I haue obtayned & also shall mentayne this honour which they so greatly enuy. But these men corrupt by pride: after ye haue promoted them to worshyp: so pas forth their tyme as yf they sette nought by your offices and honours by you optayned: but vtterly dispised them. Thus they desyre such dignities of duety: as if they were worthy and deserued to haue them by their honest lyueng and vertuous conuersacion. But certaynly they be greatly disceyued whiche loketh after two thynges cōtrary bothe togyder & at one season. So do these noble men. For they wold haue the voluptuous pleasure of slouth & ydelnesse / and the rewardes due vnto vertue and laborious dilygence. But whan these gentylmen vtter

their wordes before you or speke before the senatours: than in the moost part of their speche they exalt and commende their auncetry wenyng to be coūted more noble and excellent by recountyng and reducynge to remembrance the valiant dedes of their progenitours. But it is nothyng so. For how moche more excellent the fame & honour of their progenitour was: somoch more shamefull and reprouable is this cowarde ydelnesse of these gentylmen nowe lyueyng which so farre go out of kynde from the honorable conuersacion of their progenytours: as if they had neuer dyscended of them. And verely this is certayne: the glorious dedes and honorable of forefathers be lyke an example or luminary vnto their ofspringe or progeny. So that the same lyght suffreth neyther the good dedes nor bad of their progeny to be hyd. For yf the progeny varie from the glorious actes of their progenitours than the honour of both is distayned: but if they folowe them in vertue / than the lyght and glorie of the progenitours shynneth more radiantly by vertue of their progeny. Of this laude and honour of my progeny I can nat boost me for they were but of base degre. Their dedes can nat auaūce me nor make me noble. But it is lawfull to me to speke of myne owne dedes whiche laude is moche more clere and excellent than to boost of other mennes actes. But nowe cōsyder ye how vnryghtwyse these gentylmen be to me: they wyll nat graunt me that laude and honoure by myne owne vertue and actes: whiche they vsurpe and proudely take vpon them: by vertue and dedes of other men. And wherfore thynke ye do they this? Planely I suppose bycause I haue no ymages of my progenitours exalted in remembrance of them as these gentylmen haue: and bycause my noblenesse it but newe and springyng. But theirs is auncient and by their dysorder decaynge. But certenly I counte it more better and honorable to be rote and begynner of noblenesse vnto all my progeny and to leue the same vnto my branches: than to corrupt and defele noblenesse receyued of my progeny: as many of these gentylmen do. Forsoth I am nat ignorant but that yf these estates were nowe present & shulde answere to my wordes their speche shuld be abundātly paynted / ornate / and elegant ynough. But syth they cease nat to blame and reuyle with their lewde wordes in euery place both you and me for this your great office which ye haue gyuen vnto me: it hath nat pleased me to be styll nor to kepe secrete their fautes: lest some myght count culpable and worthy their rebukes: by reason of myne indyscrete pacience and sylence. Neuerthelesse sothely their wordes can nat greue nor hurt me: after the conscyence of myne owne mynde.

For if they say trueth they can nought say but good and worshyp by me: but if they wyll nedes ly on me my maners / my lyuyng / and cōuersacion is suche that I shall ouercome their wordes & proue their iniust accusementes fayned and false. But syth your counsell is blamed of these noble men bycause ye haue cōmytted to me this great honoure & gretter besynesse: cōsyder ye in your myndes diligently & often whyther ye shall nede to repent you of this dede or nat. To say trueth I can nat boost my selfe of the ymagꝭ of my ꝓgenitors nor I can nat recoūt vnto you the triumphes or cōsulshyps of myne auncetry. But if the mater requyred: I coude well shewe vnto you speres / standerdes / horse / trappers / harnesse: with many other rewardes of chyualry: some gyuen to me of themperour / and some of other captayns for myne actes in batayle. And other some which with myne handꝭ I haue won of thennemies of the empire. I coude also if it neded shewe you i
                           •
                         the fore part of my body manyfolde scarres of many & large wondes whiche I haue taken in good worth for defence of our countrey and cōmen wele. These be my ymages which I can shewe. This is my noblenes: nat lefte to me by heritage (as theirs is to them) but noblenes which I haue won & goten with great & sore labours of my body & paryll of my lyfe. ¶My wordes be nat ordred in ornate langage nor my spech ypaynted with rethorike lyke theirs for I set lytell therby. My vertue sheweth it selfe playnelie ynough without glosed or paynted wordes. But these noble men must of necessite haue craft for to couer their shamefull and vngoodly dedes / with this eloquent wordes / their crafty & rethorike speche. Nor as for me: I neuer lerned the greke letters nor langage / whiche thyng these estates obiect agaynst me: as a great faut. But to be playne: my pleasure was neuer moche to lerne such thynges / which haue lytell auayled vnto the techers or lerners of the same / neyther to acquisicion of vertue nor expulsion of vice. But I haue lerned & am taught in other thyngꝭ moch better / & more profitable to the cōmen wele: as to assayle & stryke myne ennemies: to dispoyle their ordynāce & vitayls: to chafe their garnyson. Nothing to drede nor feare / saue an yll name: to endure & take in good worth the pleasure of the somer & the hardenes of the wynter both in lyke: to ly vpon the grounde: to endure hunger & labour bothe togyder. Therfore I shall exhort & informe my soudyours with these preceptes: whiche I my selfe haue lerned / vsed & assayed. Nor I shall nat handell or treat theym by craft to thintent that they may auaunce me with richesse: nor vse them sharpely and my selfe plesātly: but ī euery▪ difficultie I shalbe their example of labour: nor I

shall nat put the labour to them and take the worshyp to me. This order is profitable. Thus ought a captayne demeane hym among his soudyours and namely among worthy citezins. For whan a man lyueth delicately hymselfe / and driueth his soudiours to the peryl of batayle by punysshemēt or other rygour: he is nat to be called a captayne or ruler of an army: but rather a proude lorde or tyrannous oppresser of citezins. Our elders worthely behauynge themselfe after this maner haue made noble & excellēt and inriched this cōmen wele: and themselfe also. But these estates which nowe lyueth trustyng to be honoured by the worthynesse of their ꝓgenitours / they thēseffe vnlyke of cōdicions despice vs & haue vs in disdayne whiche folowe the maners of their ꝓgenitors. And euery hye office and all honours they chalange & demaunde of you nat by their merites: but as it were of duetie and heritage. But 
                           •
                        othely the ouer proude men erre moche from the trueth. For though their ꝓgenitors & auncetry haue left vnto them euery thynge which to them was possible to leaue: as riches / patrimony / & their ymages: for remembrāce and example of them & of their worthy dedes. Neuerthelesse their vertue haue they nat left vnto them: nor they coude nat kepe it: for that onely can neyther be gyuen vnto them in rewarde nor receyued of any man. These gentilmen say that I am a man without maners & vnclenly of behauour. And why? Forsoth bycause that I prepare & dresse nat curyously many delicyous bankettes so suꝑfluous & deyntyous as they do: and bycause I haue no iougler nor dysar wt me to moue sportes & dissolut laughing: nor no more curyouse coke than one of the vyllage longyng to rural people / which thyngꝭ to haue as these gentylmen haue: it pleaseth me nat to knowledge. For I neuer had pleasure in such thynges. For I haue herde of my father and of other incorrupt and well disposed men: that suche delyciousnesse and curyosite belongeth vnto women. And that labour and besynesse belongeth vnto men. Euery good man: thynketh it more cōuenient to haue plentie of worshyp than of richesse. And more honoure it is to a good man to haue the walles of his hous garnysshed & ouercouered with armour / wherewith he may defend his coūtrey / his frendes / and hymselfe than with riche ornamētes of curyous warke of no profet saue onely the syght & vayne regarde therof. But syth these gentylmen thus obiect suche maters to me: let them cōtinue alway in such vices which lyketh thē / and that they haue euer reputed so dere. Let them incline to voluptuosite: as daunsyng / synging / bankettyng / playng / to lechery / to glotony / & dronkenes. For in suche vices haue they spende their youth: in the same let them

pas forth their age: vtterly subdued to the bely / to slepe / to ydelnes / and subiect to the lustes of the vylest part of the body. Let them leaue the swete of fyghting / the peryll of deth / the blyndyng of dust in batayle: and otherlyke paryls vnto vs / to whome these be more acceptable / than their feestes and voluptuous bankettes or other vyle pleasurs. But they do nat so / they be nat so contented. For after that such vngoodly and vyle men haue dishonested themselfe / by their foule dedes: than be they redy to take a way the rewardes of good men vnto themselfe. Thus (agaynst all right) lechery and slouth moost cursed vyces dothe no hurt to such as occupyeth them: but they be vtter distruction to the cōmen wayle / and cōmens which be innocent and vnculpable.
                     ¶But syth I haue made answere to these dysordred gentylmen: and that moderately after my custome and cōdicion and nat so largely as their cursednesse & vices ar worthy. I shall speke nowe a fewe thynges touchyng the commen wele. And first of al haue ye good trust & asperance touchynge the besynes of Numidy. For ye haue nowe moued & auoyded euery thyng wherby Iugurth was defended from begynnynge of the warre vnto this tyme: that is to say the couetyse of Calphurnius / & of Albinus: the vncraftynes and foly of Aulus: and the pride of Metellus. By these founde Iugurth socour hytherto: but all these be auoyded nowe. Moreouer ye haue there an army which knoweth the contrey / but verily it is more noble & manly than fortunate or happy. For a great part therof is wasted & spent (and that wors is) infected and corrupted: what by the auarice and by the vnboldnesse & cowardyse of their captayns. Wherfore ye which be of lusty age and mete to endure the hardnesse of warre & batayle: nowe labour ye with me / and take ye in hande the defence of the commen wayle. Nor let none of you be afrayed nor abasshed for misfortune of the other soudyours which haue foughten there before this tyme nor of the pride of their captayns. For I myselfe as coūsellour of your besynesse & felowe of your peryls shall be present with you in euery besynesse bothe in your iournays & in your batayls also. So that I shall gouerne you & my selfe without difference / and vnder one forme in euery poynt. And verely by helpe of the goddes we shall within short season obtayne all auātages & cōmodities which any man may wyn in batayle / as prayes / victory / with immortall laude & worshyp. And certaynlie if these pleasors & auantages were in dout or harde to obtayne (as they be nat): Neuerthelesse it were cōuenient to euery good man (as ye be) to socour & defende the cō
                        men wayle of their coūtrey fro distruccion & dyshonour. For

certaynlie there was neuer man whiche obtayned immortal laude nor euerlastynge name by cowardise or sl

Nor there was neuer wyse father which wold wysshe his chyldren or sonnes to lyue euer: but onely that they myght lyue so long as they behaued themselfe worthely in goodnesse & honesty: and so to passe forth their lyfe as natural course requireth. ¶Worthy romayns: I wolde speke more vnto you if I vnderstode that strength coude be encreased to feble or fearfull men: by wordes: but it is nat so. Wherfore me semeth that I haue sayed ynough and abundantly to noble and bolde harted men: as my trust is to proue you.
                  
                  
                     ¶Howe Marius after his exhortacion endyd: anone laded shyppes with ordynance of warre and sende forwarde with the same one Mālyus his imbassadour: and howe he himselfe anone after folowed withal his company. And howe he behaued hymselfe in Numidy at fyrste begynnynge. ¶The .li. Chapyter.
                     
                        WHan Marius had vttred and ended his wordꝭ vnder this forme: and whan he sawe al the myndes of the cōmens enclined to the war in trust of victorie & prayes. Than anone without more delay he caused shyppes to be charged wt viteyls / & treasour for the soudyors wages with armour / wepyn / and all other thynges necessary to war. And cōmaunded one named Aulus Manlius / which was assigned embassadours to hym: to departe forwarde with the same shyppes so charged. In the meane season Marius hymself remayned at Rome a lytel tyme: and chose forth soudyours suche as hym thought most expedient: and nat after the custome of the olde romayns his predecessours nor after institucion of the aunciēt captayns / which had ordred cartayne maner of peple of whome soudyours shuld be chosen for warfare in tyme cō
                        uenient. But cōtrary wyse Marius admytted euery man indifferētly which was any thynge lyckely and had pleasure to go with hym. And many suche he admytted also whiche were poore and nat suffred to go warfare before: lest their pouertie myght haue constraned them rather to fal to robbery than to dedes of chiualry. How beit / it was inacted of the olde romayns that suche excused of warre for cause aboue sayd:

shulde pay a certayne somme of money pretaxed towarde the wages of such as laufully were admytted to warre. Marius suffred none of these to pay any thynge at al: but elect many of them for his soudyours. Many of the romayns surmysed that Marius elected vnto warre these abiect parsons: for want of other good soudyours. Some other demed that he so dyd for fauoure / ambicion / and parcialite: bycause this sort of people assisted and honoured hym by auauncement at begynnynge of his promocion. And also men consydred that vnto a man desyrous of dignitie and power: the moost nedy men be moost mete and behouable. For suche nedy wretches be moost auenturous: for they haue nought to lose and alway trust in auauncement by auenturynge themselfe. And therfore they iudge euery thynge which they do: good / honest / and laudable: if any auantage be therto appendant. Thus dout they no paryll so that they may come therby to promocion. At last Marius departed from Rome with somwhat gretter nombre than was graunted and decreed to hym of the senatours. Within fewe dayes after that: he toke shyppyng and arryued in the prouince next vnto Affrike vnder the romayns at a towne named Vtica. The army whiche was there with Metellus / was delyuered to hym by one Publius Rutilius / which was embassadour with the sayd Metellus. For Metellus hymselfe fled the syght of Marius bycause he wolde nat se that with his eyen / which he coude nat endure to here. But whan Marius had restored and fulfylled the legions of his soudyors / and the cohortes for the subsidyes and rescous. Than went he into a plentyfull place of Numidy which was full of prayes. All that he toke there: he gaue frely inrewarde to his soudyours. This done: he assayled suche castels and townes which were but febly defended with men and walles. He had many batayls & lyght skyrmisshes: and many other thynges he dyd in other places nat with moche difficultie. In the meane tyme the newe soudyours were redy manly fyghtyng without fere: and seyng that they which fled were other taken or slayne: therfore they aduysed them wel that the strongest and boldest was most sure of all. They consydred wel that it stode them in hande to defende with wepyn and armour their libertie / their countrey / their frendes / and all other thynges longyng to their hel
                           •
                        h and honour. Thus laboured they for glorie / laude / and riches whiche they optayned: so that within short season the olde soudyours and the newe encreased togyder cherisshynge and infourmynge one an other tyl their vertue and boldnesse was lyke. But whan the two kynges Iugurth and Bocchus vnderstode of the

commynge of Marius: they deuyded their hoostes and went in sonder into dyuers places where no man coude attayne to them for difficultie of the places. This was done by counsel of Iugurth. For it pleased hym so to do trustyng that within short space the romayns wolde be spred abrode in spoylinge and than thought he to assayle them in euery place whan they were moost without fere at libertie / at large / and vnprouyded: as men ar wont to be specially whan their ennemies behaueth them as if they were affrayed. Than often be the victour improuident and lesse circumspect.
                  
                  
                     ¶Howe Metellus the olde consull retourned to Rome: and of the worthy and valyant behauour of Marius agaynst Iugurthe and of his great actes at his begynnyng. ¶The .lii. Chapyter.
                     IN the meane tyme Metellus returned to Rome: which contrary to his opinion was receyued with glad myndes of the romayns & after that the enuy which Marius had moued against hym was asswaged and ouerpassed: he was lyke dere and beloued both to the cōmens and senatours.
                     ¶But Marius on his part applyed and toke hede to his owne besynesse and his ennemies also: without slouth but with great wysdome. He perceyued wel & knewe what was good and yll for auātage on both sydes. He caused the wayes and iournayes of the two kynges to be dayly serched & espied. He preuented and interrupted their coūsels / prouysions / and gyles. He suffred nothyng to be vnprouided and vnredy on his syde: but of the other syde and party of his ennemies: he suffred nothyng to be sure or prouided: for alway he preuented their ꝓuisions and pursued them. Often whyle Iugurth and the Getulyans spoyled the Numidyens whiche had yelded thēselfe to the romayns Marius was redy in their way & valiantly assayled them: and ouer thrue many of them / whyle they were dispersed abrode and fleyng away for feare. And also nat ferre from the towne of Cirtha / he made Iugurth hymselfe so trust in his flyght that for hast to ren away: he laft his armour behynde hym. But whan Marius cōsydred that his acres were onely glorious and excellent without any auantage: and that he myght nat e
                           •
                        ecute batayle with Iugurth for his vnstedfastnes and mouyng from place to place:

he consydred in mynde and ordayned hym redy to besyege the cities of the countrey one after another. And namely suche as outher of men or of place were necessary and behouable to his ennemies / and contrary or hurtfull to hym. This dyd he thynkynge: that if Iugurth without dystourbance suffred hym so to do he shuld other be spoyled and bereft of his cities / ordynance / socours / & refuge: or els he must abyde the fortune of batayle & stryue for the maistry in playne feld. Bocchus the kyng of the mauriens had often sende messangers before vnto Marius: sayeng that he wolde gladly come into fauour / amyte / & frendshyp of the romayns: and byddyng Marius nat to dout hym as an ennemy nor to fear any thyng longing to an ennemy to be commytted of hym agaynst the romayns. It is but lytel knowen for trueth whether Bocchus fayned this thing to the intent that his cōming to batayle vnknowen, & vnproued myght be to Marius more greuous: or els whether he was wont by vnstablenes of mynde to change peace somtyme for warre: & somtyme war for peace. But Marius the consul (as he had purposed before) drue hym vnto the castels and townes whiche were walled & defended: and fiersly assayled them. Anone he tourned many of them from his ennemies to hym▪ some by strength & violence / some by feare: and other some by ꝓmisyng & gyueng of rewardes & prodicion of their captayns. But at first begynnyng he medled but with meane castels & townes thynking that Iugurth shulde come to defende and socour his people & townes: and so come into danger of the romayns. But whan Marius herde that Iugurth was far thens and occupyed in other besynesses: than thought he nat to lose his tyme: but to auenture on gretter thyngꝭ wherin was more harde besynesse and gretter labour & honour. Wherfore he entended to besiege the cite of Capsa / whiche was a great cite / stronge / and riche.
                  
                  
                     ¶How Marius wanne the great and rych cytie named Capsa: and how he vtterly distroyed the same and gaue all the rychesse therof to hauocke among his soudyours. ¶The .liii. chapyter.
                     
                        AMonge the most wydest and thickest wyldernesses of Numidy was this great and ryche cite named Capsa: whiche (as men say) was first bylded by that Hercules whiche was borne in the lande of Libya: and nat by Hercules the sonne of Iupyter and Alcumena. Thinhabitours of

this cite were ruled by Iugurth peasably & easely put to no charges nor besynesse / and therfore were they moost true and faythful to hym. They were defended agaynst al ennemies: nat onely with walles / armour / and men: but also with moche stronger defence of the difficultie & hardnesse of the place and contrey nere about them. So that it was in maner impossible that any army coude cōe nere them for want of water and scarcite of vitels. For except the feldes & places nere to the cite all the other be voyde & wast grounde & desart without habitacion / vneared / barayne / and drie without water. All full of serpētes: which were somoch more violent and fiers for lacke of meat and sustenance / as al other wylde beestes be wont to inrage for hunger. And moreouer the myscheuous and perilous nature of serpentes is more kyndled to ragyng and vexed with thyrst / than with any other thyng: which thyrst they coude nat quench there for want of water. Wherfore neyther man nor beest myght surely passe by them. Whā Marius cast al these difficulties in his mynde: his hert was persed with a merueylous desyre to wyn this cite / both for that it was moch hurtfull to hym: and profitable to Iugurth / and also bycause it was harde to do and moche honour myght be gotten in wynninge therof. And moreouer bycause Metellus the other consull before hym had won the cite of Thala / with great honour and glory: whiche of sytuacion was nat vnlyke to this cyte: nouther vnlyke in defence. Saue that nat far from the walles of Thala were a fewe fontayns: but about this cite of Capsa was no water / wel / nor fontayne: saue one and that was within the walles of the citie alway full of water. All other whiche dwelled without the walles / as in the suburbes: occupyed but rayne water. The inhabitantes of that contrey and of all the remenant of Affrike / which were far from the see and rude people coude moch the better endure this scarsite of water and thirst: for this cause. For the moost part of them were fed with mylke and venyson nat lokyng after salt / sauces / nor other suche thynges as be norisshynges or prouocatiues to glotony. They toke meate and drinke onely to s
                           •
                        ake their hunger / and to quenche their thirst: and nat without measure to prouoke themselfe to pleasure of the flesshe / as many christenmen do nowe ī our dayes: which make of their bely their god. And eate nat to lyue: but they lyue to eate contrary to mānes lyfe / and vtterly enclined to bestialite. O cursed glotony let vs christēmen lerne her of panyms to eschewe the: whiche wasted the body and goodes: damnest the soule: and art mother and norice of al vices. But to retourne to my purpose: this Marius after that he had serched euery thynge

by his espyes / he proceded in his interprise and purpose (as men thought) holpen of the goddes. For agaynst so many & harde difficulties he coude nat haue made sure prouision by counsell of man nor by his owne priuate wyt: as he whiche had impediment and was letted nat onely by shapnesse of the contrey: but also by lacke & scarcite of wheat and of all other corne. For the numidiens intēdeth more / to norisshe pasture for beastes than to labour or ere the groūde for corne. And also they had brought togyder all the seed and corne of the yere befor into strong holdes as their kyng Iugurth had cōmaunded them and moreouer at that season the feldes on euery syde were dry and bare without corne: and no maruale. For it was about the extremite or later ende of somer. Nat withstandyng all these difficulties and sharpnesses Marius made ꝓuision ynough as the mater required. First he commytted all the bestes which he had taken in pray in foretyme vnto the horsemen / whiche of their owne wylfolowed hym to war: or were sende to hym for helpe by frendes of thempire. Marius commaūded them to take charge to driue forth these beastꝭ. Than sent he Aulus Manlius embassadour of the hoost to a towne named Laris / and al the cohortes of his soudyours with hym which were fotemen and lyght harnysed for to kepe the treasour of the soudyours wages and vitayls: whiche he had lefte in the same towne. Marius kept his coūsel of this interprise so secrete that none of all his company hye nor lowe knewe of his purpose nor whan he intended. But whan Manlius and his company shulde depart towarde Laris: Marius dissimuled with them sayeng that he wold stray abrode in Numidy in rouyng and afterwarde within fewe dayes: he and his company wolde come also to the same towne of Laris / laded with prayes of his ennemies. This done he deꝑted towarde a flod named Tana: no creature liuely knowyng of his purpose. And euery day he distribued in his iournayes amonge his boost .xlii. heed of oxen for vitayle / which he cōmaunded to be deuided by euyn porcion amonge them by hunders and halfe hunders togyder: deuidyng vitayls to euery company after their nombre. And in the meane season he charged bottels and bowges to be made of the hydes of the same beastes and of other ledder in great nōbre. Moreouer he eased their scarcyte wheate and other corne: by wyse prouision. And without knowledge of all his company he made good prouisyon of euery thing / which might be necessary vnto his army in tyme of nede. At conclusion the syxt day after whan they were come to the sayd flod of Tana: thyder was brought a myghty multitude of bottels and bowges made of ledder.

There pytched they their tentes with easy labour and small defence. Than refresshed they themselfe with meate and drinke: and eased themselfe a certayne space. This done: Marius commaunded them that euery man shulde be redy to procede forwarde euyn with the sonne goyng downe and that euery man shulde onely lade hymselfe and his beastes with water in the sayd bowges and bottels leauynge al other cariage / burthens / and baggage: there behynde them in their tentes / vnder the custody of other soudyours therto assigned. After this whan he sawe his tyme: he departed forthe from his tentes with his company: and lauboured al the nyght longe in his iournay. The day after folowyng he rested in a secrete & couert place. In the same wyse behaued he hymselfe the nyght next ensuynge: and in the thyrde nyght moche before the day lyght / he entred into a fayre and large felde ful of smal hylles and downes / no more but two myle space from Capsa. And there he taryed withal his hoost in the moost priueest maner abidynge the day lyght. But assone as the day began to appere: many numidyens yssued forth of the towne: some to dysporte themselfe: and some about their besynes / nought fearyng nor suspectyng of their ennemies. Whan Marius sawe that: anone withal haste he sent all his horsemen to the towne / and with them as many fotemen in lyght harnesse as were moost swyft and spedy. Whome he commaunded to ren withal hast and boldely and valiantly to assayle the towne: and to besyege the gates. Than after he hymselfe folowed spedely: but with good hede and aduisement: nat sufferynge his soudyours in the assaut nor in the way thyderwarde to fal to robbyng nor prayes by spoyling of their ennemies. Whan thinhabitantes of the towne knewe herof: their case was vnsure / their feare great and horrible: for the sodayne chaunce of them was nothynge suspected before / nor prouyded. Many of the cetezins whiche were without the towne and were taken and in power & captiuite of the romains their ennemies sent vnto them within the towne desyring them for saue garde of their lyues to yelde themselfe and the cite to Marius. So was it done at cōclusion. Howbeit this nat wt
                        standyng Marius brent the cite. All the numidyens inhabytantes therof which were of ful age & able to bere wepen were slayne: and the remanent as women / chyldren / and aged men were taken prisoners and solde for their raunsome. The pray and richesse was deuyded among the soudyours. This dede agaynst the lawe of armes was nat thus done by Marius: by couetyse nor any outher crueltie of hym: but bycause the towne & place was ꝓfitable / and necessare to Iugurth & to the

romayns harde to come to. And the maner of the people proued mouable and vnlauful euer of nature before: and neyther refrained from their yll appetite by benefite or good dede: nor yet with awe or feare of punysshement.
                  
                  
                     ¶Howe Marius by fortune more than by strength wanne the strongest castell of all Numidy / wherin were the tresours of Iugurth. ¶The .liiii. chapyter.
                     
                        AFter that Marius had brought to ende so great and harde an interprise without any losse or dāmage to hym or any of his peple. Though he were reputed noble / great and excellent before: than began he to be counted more famous & excellent. Euery noble dede: was reputed to be done by strength & wysdome of Marius: and ascribed to his strength and polycie. And that suche thynges as were done by good counsell and prouision / and also suche as hapened by fortune or chance: and by neglygence of their ennemies. The soudiours were so manerly treated without crueltie or fiersnesse of their captayne / and also made riche and abundant in treasour and iewels: that they exalted and praysed his name to the heuen. And loued hym as themselfe. But in contrarywyse the numidyens feared hym more than any man lyuynge. Shortly to speke: both the frendes of thempire and ennemies also thought verily that outher Marius had a godly mynde and was a god hymselfe: or els that he was priue with the goddes: and dyd all his dedes and besynesse by their aduyse / counsell / and prouision: which shewed hym before what shuld fortune after. But whan this chaunce had fortuned so well at Capsa: anone Marius drue hym to other townes / and toke as many as he besyeged. In some townes the numidyens resysted hym to their power: but it coude nat auayle. In many other townes the dwellers gaue them ouer and left them voyde and ran away feryng so to be treated & delt withall as they of Capsa were: bycause their townes were lyke behouable to Iugurth▪ and hurtfull to Marius. Whan Marius came to any such towne: destitute and voyde of dwellers he set fyre in them & brent them grounde smothe. The aged men / women & chyldren: toke them to wodes and caues to hyde themselfe. The yong men & lusty which were taken were slayne downe right. Thus was euery place fylled with wepyng & wayling / 

brennyng and slaughter: one mengled with other. Finally af
                           •
                         yt Marius had won into his handes / many townes & castels: and some without resystence or blode shedyng of his men / he went in hande with an other maistry and difficultie nat so sharpe nor harde to come to as was Capsa / but to be won or besyged it was nat les harde nor of les difficultie.
                     ¶Nat farre from the flod of Mulucha (which water deuydeth the kyngdome of Iugurth: from the kyngdome of Bocchus) was a great rocke or mountayne of stone in myddes of a playne: open ynough to be sene hauyng thervpon bylded a meane castel of quantite: but of a meruaylous altitude & onely one strayet passage and narowe / left to cōe therto. But on euery other syde the rocke of naturall growyng was downe right lyke a wall: as if it had ben made for ye nones with mannes hādes. Marius purposed with all his might to take this castell: and namely bycause the tresours of Iugurth were wt
                        in the same. But this his purpose at last came to effect / rather by chaunce of fortune / than by prouision or counsell. For this castell was garnisshed & plentuously instored with men / wepen / vytels / and withall orther ordynance requisite & necessary to defence of such a forteres. Moreouer win the same was a fountayne plētyful of clere water. And besyde this the sytuacion therof was such that without maruelous difficultie & vnmesurable labour none ennemies myght attayne or approche nere therto their ingynes of batayle to frusshe the walles or any other part therof. Besyd al these defēces the double walles o
                           •
                         this castel were garnysshed wt towres / bulwarkes / & all other defences & ingynes which coude be ymagined by mannes mynde: and that rownde about in compasse aswell within / as without. The way therto: by which the inhabitantes & garnison vsed to go and come / was very strayet and narowe. Insomoch that the romayns entryng by the same way with their ingynes of batayle were cōstraned to cut their pauases on both sydes and to make them more narowe for strayetnesse of the passage. And in suche maner they proceded forwarde vnder the same in great paryll and with moch difficultie: and at conclusion all in vayne. For whan they were come nere to the walles and wolde haue set vp and adioyned the same pauases to the walles to haue vndermined vnder them: all their labour was frastrate. For what with stones and what with fyre the defenders of the castel brake and brent them agayne downe to the grounde. Thus cowde nat the soudyors whiche vndermined the walles contynue togyder at their worke and besynesse: for strayetnes and difficultie of the place and importune violence of them within the castell. Nor other

soudyours coude nat serue them whiche made and repared the pauases without great paryll & daunger. For continually as fast as they raysed the pauases to couer and defende them selfe: they were broken and brent bytwene their handes. In the meane tyme no soudyour was so good / strong / nor bolde: but that he was outher wounded or beaten done to deth. Than was feare encreased to other that were feble and faynt herted. ¶But after that many dayes & great labours in this maner were ouerpassed and spent in vayne. Marius was sore angred & vexed in his hert reuoluyng many thyngꝭ in mynde: but specially whyther he myght gyue ouer his purpose (seyng his labour frustrate) or els abyde the chaunce of fortune which at many tymes before he had founde fauorable and frendly to hym. Whyle Marius chafed & brennyng in desyre reuolued suche thynges in his mynde both day & nyght: it hapened by chaunce of fortune that a certayne lumbard a symple soudyour / one of the company whiche was last sende from Rome to Numidy to supply the army strayed abrode from his cōpany a lytel way which lumbarde as he wandred founde among the stones many smal snayles crepyng on the grounde: nat far from that syde of the castel which was ouer agaynst the syde which the romayns besyged and assayled. Bycause this lumbard in his coūtrey was acustomed lyke other of his countrey men to eate such snayles prepared after their maner: therfore he gathered first one and than an other / and after that many: ascendyng vp by lytel and lytel: somtyme crepyng somtyme clymmyng / for no other intent or purpose saue to gather such snayles: and so far he ꝓceded by lytel and lytel tyll at last he came almost to the top of the mountayne. But whan he sawe all that syde of the castel desolate and no person steryng: anone he began̄e to haue a pleasure & desyre in his mynde for to worke some maistry / as the propertie and cōdicion is of euery man couetyng to wyn a name / laude and riches: and to be spoken of. By chance of fortune in the same place where the lumbard stode in this aduisemēt / among the stones grue a great and olde oke tre hauyng the myddes a lytel bowyng downe towarde the groūde: and the remanēt crokyng vpwarde agayne with myghty armes and branches ascendyng to the hyest of the walles with the top erect & lyfred vp as euery herbe & tre of nature is wont to growe vpwarde at the top. This lumbard well aduised the same & aduentured to clyme vp warde takyng his holde somtyme by the branches and bowes of this oke: and somtime takyng holde & leauyng by the stones which appered forth in the wall tyl at the last he attayned vnto the very top of the wall. And whan he sawe no

man styring on that part there stode he styl espyed of no man and noted & cōsydred wel at his pleasure al the inwarde part of the castel and the playne within the walles about the towre. This lumbard had somoche the more leasour to take so long aduisement vnespyed for al the numidyens defenders of the castel were on the other syde attendyng & gyueng hede to the assaut and defendyng themselfe and the castel agaynst the romayns. Whan the lumbard had espyed and consydred euery thyng which he thought myght be auātage to his after purpose: than he descēded agayne downewarde by the same way which he ascended: but nat without hede nor with so lytel aduisement as he ascended vpwarde: but prouyng euery way / and lokyng about yf it were possible to brynge into the castel any cōpany of men by that syde or nat. This wel consydred: assone he descended: anone he went to Marius and informed hym of euery thynge as he had done exhortyng & requiryng hym to put in profe whether the castel myght be won on that syde where he had ben. Farthermore he ꝓmised hymselfe to be gyde vnto such as wold vndertake that intprise sayeng that in the mater was no danger. Marius heryng these wordes of the lumbard / sende forth with hym certayne of his men of them which were there present to vnderstand & knowe the trueth of the mater. Whan they had ben there & retourned to Marius agayne: some brought hym worde that the mater was easy to do: and some other sayd that it was very harde & perylous. The sentēce of euery man was after as their mynd gaue them. The cowardes thought it harde / but such as were of bolde hertes and desyrous of worshyp thought it easy and without moche peryl. Neuerthelesse the mynde of Marius was somwat exalted to cōfort / and good hope: and therfore of al the company of trumpettes / and of other such mynstrels as be wont to be in batayle to gyue courage and signes to the fig
                           •
                        ters / he chose forth fyue which were moost swyft & moost lyght and delyuer: and .iiii. hundred men he assigned to assyst and defende the sayd trūpettes. And al them he cōmaunded to obey to the lumbard and to be ruled & ordred by hym in euery thyng. The day next folowyng was assigned to them to procede forth ī their besynesse. Whan the tyme assigned & prefixed by Marius was come the lumbard wt his cōpany had made redy and ordred euery thyng: and so went to the place where be had ben before. But whan they were come thyder: the lumbard their gyde caused them to change their armour / and to make bare their heedes and their fete: to thintent that they so bare heded the better might se aboue them and on euery syde of them: and that they beyng bare fote myght labour somoche

the better and take better hold in clymming vp by the stones. Their swordes were fastned behynde at their backes & their buckelers withal / which were made after the fassion of the numidyens buckelers of lether: bycause of lyghter weyght and burthen. And also to shintent that they shulde gyue lesse sounde or noyse / if it hapned any stone to smyte agaynst them. This done: the lumbard went vp before them / and bounde smal cordes to the stones and to the olde rotes whiche apered aboue the stones where he coude espy any suche wherby the soudyours sustayning themselfe & takyng holde might more lightly & with more ease mount and clym vpwarde. And somtyme he went before and helped them vp with his handes specially such as for that vncustomed way were somwhat fereful. Somtyme whan thascendyng or goyng vp was ouer harde and sharpe: he put eche of them vp before hym without armour: and than he hymselfe folowed with their armour and wepyn. Suche places where moost dout was in: he specially proued and assayd them moost of al: and in goyng & comyng often tymes vp & downe by the same moost dangerous passages: he encreased audacite & boldnesse to the remenāt. Thus after they had ben sore weryed / and with long & great labour endeuored themselfe: at last they came into the castel / whiche on that syde they founde desolate & without defence. For (as sayd is before) al they which were with in the castel were occupyed in fightyng / or redy to fight agaynst the romayns: as they were on other dayes before. But whan Marius vnderstode by messāgers how the lumbard had done: how beit that al the day before his men had ben sore besied and occupyed in fightyng: & assayling the castel. Neuertheles specially at this tyme he exhorted & enbolded them: and he hymselfe departing forth from vnder his pauases caused his soudyors to adioyne themselfe nere togyder / & to holde vp their sheldes aboue their heedes / so that the cōioyning of them semed as it wer the frame of a volt. Marius kept hym vnder the same for his defence / & so approched to the walles. And both he & his company whiche were nere about hym valiantly assayled the castel: and also other of his cōpany which stode a far of & coude nat come nere the walles for prease: assayled the castel fiersly from a far and sore vexed and put in feare their ennemies within the castel throwyng agaynst them plumettes of leed with slynges / arowes / dartes / and al other maner engyns of batayle wherwith any thynge coude strongely be throwen into the castel. But the Numidyens within the castel had often before this tyme ouertourned and brent the tentes and pauases of the romayns and toke therby so great audacite and boldnesse that

they defended nat themselfe within the castel walles: but walked vp and downe without the castel walles bothe day and nyght reuilyng and reprouynge the romayns and obiectyng cowardyse agaynst Marius. And thretnyng that his soudyours shulde be made subiectes and bonde men to Iugurth in tyme to come / whome they purposed at that tyme to make bonde to them. Thus whyle they thought themselfe sure and their mater in good case: they were harde and egar ynough reuylinge and thretnynge the romayns. In the meane space whyle the romains and their ennemies were besyest fighting withal their myght: the romayns for laude / glorie / and lordshyp: and the Numidiens for their helth and sauyng of their lyues. Anone sodenly the lumbard with his company which were within the castel on the backsyde blewe their trumpettes. First of al the women and chyldren which went to the walles to se the bykering were al abasshed and fled inwarde to the castel: and after them al the soudyors which were without and nerest to the walles and coude escape in. And finally they all bothe armed and vnarmed fled inwarde. Whan the romayns sawe this they assayled the castel more fiersly: some they slewe and ouerthrue: some they wounded ouerpassynge or standyng vpon the bodyes of them which were slayne. Al their desyre was with their handes to wyn glorie and worshyp. They stryued to ascende vnto the walles euery man couetyng to be before other. None of them al taryed nor was let with spoylingꝭ nor prayes. Their great courage suffred them nat to loke there after / tyl by manhode and strength they had won the castel. Thus was fortune fauorable to Marius: so that his first negligence and vnwyse boldnesse to assayle a castel inexpugnable / was tourned by chance from rebuke to glorie and laude / such was his fortune. But whan Marius had won this castel after estimacion of man nat able to be won: than was he lorde of the moost part of al the treasour of Iugurth: the castel was gyuen al to murdre and hauocke. And the soudyours of Marius richely rewarded euery man after his desert.
                  
                  
                     ¶How in the meane tyme whyle this castel was in wynnynge / a noble man of Rome named Lucius Sylla: came from Rome to Marius with a great bende of horsemen: and of the maners & behauour of this Sylla. ¶The .lv. Chapyter.
                     
                        
                        IN mean tyme whyle this fiers assaute and victorie was concluded at this castel: a famous lorde of Rome named Lucius Sylla / tresourer of the army came from Rome to Marius with a great bende of horsmen. Whome the same Marius at his departyng from Rome had left there to rayse and assemble socours vnto the war among the Italiens and other nacions frendes and louers of thempire of Rome. ¶But forasmoch as the matter moueth vs to make mencion of so worthy a man and of his disposicion and maners: therfore it semeth me conuenient in this part somwhat to write of his behauour & conuersacion: and that as brefely as I may conueniently: namely for two causes. The first for that I intende nat to make relacion of his behauour & maners in any other place of this cronycle saue here. Secondly for asmoche as none other authour hath written sufficyently of hym. For howe beit that one hystoriagraph named Lucius Sisenna: wrote most dyligently and best of his actes of any other before neuertheles me semeth that he spake lytel acordynge to trueth nor indyfferently. For his tong nor pen were nat at lyberte for asmoch as he was sōwhat in danger to ye sayd Sylla: wherby he was prohibyted to say or to write / acordyng to ye trueth. For what by fauour & what by fere he durst nat touche playnly the vices which were in hym. But here I purpose (all fauour and fere layd a part) indifferenly to write of him. ¶This Sylla of progeny: was descended of moost noble stocke of the remaīs. Howbeit the name of his auncetry was almost lost and decayed by dulnesse / negligence / and slouth of some of his lynage. In greke and in laten he was of lyke connyng: and excellently seen in both the langages. His mynde was great / and bolde of courage. Of voluptous pleasours he was desyrous: but moche more desyrous of glory & laude. In vacant leser he was moch enclined to ye lustes of his body. But suche pleasure or voluptuousnes dyd neuer let nor withholde hym from any besynesse or ocupacion necessary: howbeit such pleasure so blynded hym that he toke no wyse of byrth / maners / and honestie cōuenient for his estate. He was moch eloquent of speche crafty & subtyll ynough. He had the wayes easely to get frendshyp / and it was also no maistry to get frēdshyp of hym: in fayning / dissimulyng / and counterfaytinge of besynesses: his wytte was very hye and excellent. He was a marueylous & incredyble gyuer of many thynges / but specially of money: and before the warre and victory which the noble men of Rome: had agaynst the cōmen people: He was so noble & worthy reputed that it is in maner incredyble: nor

his good fortune neuer passed the policy of his wyt: in somoche that many men were in dout whyther he was more fortunate than strong. But after the victory of this warre: so vngoodly was his demeanour & so cruel / that verily I knowe nat whyther I may more be asshamed or greued to write it or to speke therof. For after that this warre of Numidy was ended: & both Marius & this Sylla were retourned to Rome: a great discorde fel bytwene the lordes & cōmens. Marius toke part with the cōmons: but Sylla toke part with the lordes and at last droue Marius forthe of the citie. After that: an other man of great power called Cynna whiche had ben fyue tymes cōsull of Rome gathered an hoost of men and toke part with Marius agaynst this Sylla. But at cōclusion Sylla ouercame hym in batayle: and slewe hym. After this: Sylla cruelly murdred an other noble man of Rome named Caius 
                           •
                        arbo: and with hym yonge Marius / sone of this Marius which warred in Numidy. Last of al whan this Sylla had won victory ouer Marius & his fauourers: than became he most cruel of al other: in somoch that he fylled al the citie with blod of the citezins. But here wyl I leaue to speke farther of this Sylla / or of his behauour ī cruelte: and returne to write of his behauour in this warre of Numidy vnder Marius. ¶After that this Sylla (as I haue sayd before) was come to Affrike & to the hoost of Marius with his cōpany of horsemen: within short season he became most expert in chiualry & crafty aboue al other: howbeit before this tyme he was but rude & ignorant of dedes of chiualry. And moreouer he treted & gouerned his soudyours with maners & mekenes. And gaue rewardes to many: to some whiche desyred hym: and to some other of his owne pleasure non desyred therto. But he wolde take no rewardes nor gyftes agayne / without it were agaynst his wyl. And if he so dyd at any tyme agaynst his wyl: than was he more redy to gyue agayne that which was gyuen to hym: than to pay that money which he had borowed of other. He demaunded nothyng agayne of any man though it were due and det to hym: but rather he laboured and endeuored hymselfe that many myght be in his det / and by suche meanes to haue them bounde to hym. And how beit that he was one of the grettest of Rome: yet disdayned he nat the cō
                        pany of the most symple soudyours of the hoost: but cōmuned and acompanyed with them both in sportes & in sadnes. In labours he was alway redy. In batayle & in watchyngꝭ with other besynes of warre he suffred no man to be before hym. Nor ī the meane season he neyther hurt the good name of the cōsul nor of none other good man: which thing men desyrous

of worshyp & honour be often wont to do for in dispraysing of other they thinke to obtayne great laude to thēselfe. He onely laboured that none might passe hym neyther in counsel nor in might / or manhod of his handꝭ. But he passed many. By whiche maners & condicions in short tyme he became very dere & wel beloued / nat onely to Marius: but also to al the hoost.
                  
                  
                     ¶How Marius preuayled in batayle agaynst both the two kynges / Iugurth and Bocchus. ¶The .lvi. chapyter.
                     
                        BVt whan Iugurth had lost the towne of Capsa / as is sayd before: and dyuerse other fortresses and other places defensyues which to hym were profitable. And also a great quantite of his treasour / wherin he moost trusted: Anone he sent messangers to kyng Bocchus requiryng hym in al hast to come to Numidy and to bryng his army with hym: sayng that it was hye tyme to make batayle with Marius. But whan he vnderstode that Bocchus prolonged the tyme in ouerlong taryeng / hauyng dyuers cōsyderations of peace and warre / as he that was in dout of the chaunce and fortune of the ende therof. Iugurth agayne corrupted the next of his counsel with gyftes in lykewse as he had done before: and promysed vnto the kyng Bocchus hymselfe / the thirde part of the kyngdome of Numidy: if the romayns were dryuen out of Affrike / or yf the war shulde be brought to ende without losse or diminisshyng of his kyngdome and marches therof. The kyng Bocchus induced with hope of this reward: with a great multitude of people came to Iugurth / and adioyned both their armies togyder in one. ¶At this tyme Marius with his cōpany was in his iournay towarde the ꝓuince which was in the coost of Affrike & apartayned to thempire: where the sayd Marius purposed to rest with his cōpany / tyl the wynter were past. But whan he was in his iournay & in leest dout: Iugurth and Bocchus bothe togyder inuaded and set vpon hym and his men whan the tenth part of the day scarsly remayned. This dyd they: thynkinge that the nyght which was nere come shulde to them be great socour and defence if they were ouercome: and if they dyd ouercome the romayns: it shulde be to them no damage nor impediment bycause they knewe the contrey & place better than the romains. But on the other syde bothe these chaunces: in darkenesse

were harde and contrary to the romayns: for they knewe nat the coostes of that countrey. Marius anone had vnderstandyng of the cōmyng of his ennemies by many of his espyes: but it was ouerlate. For assone as he had worde: his ennemies were euyn at hande. In somoch that before the army coude be set in order or aray: and or they coude remoue or gather togyder their baggage which at that tyme was abrode: and before they coude take any cōmaundement of their captayne by worde or sounde of trumpettes: The horsemen of the Maurians and of the Getulians ran togyder vpon them nat in order nor aray of batayle: but by companyes and bendes togyder / as it fortuned them to come togyder in heapes and clusters. The romayns for the moost part: were al amased and greuously abasshed for that sodayne and vnprouided feare. Neuerthelesse they forgate nat their olde manhode & strēgth some drue them to their armour: and other some whiche were armed alredy defended their felowes tyl they armed thēselfe. Other some mounted on horsebacke and boldly rode agaynst their ennemies: and encountred them valyantly. The fyght on both parties was more lyke a skirmysshe among brigandes and rouers than to any apoynted or ordred batayle. For the horsmen & fotemen were mengled togyder without standerdes / cognysances / or any ordynaunce / aray / or order. The Maurians & Numidyans were fierse on their syde. Some of the romayns they beat downe and ouerthrue. Some they wounded mortally: And many they bereft vtterly of their lyues / and slewe them in that place. The remenant which sharpely and manly resysted they compased them about on euery syde: and aswel behynde as before assayled them: so that neyther manhode / strength / nor armour: was able sufficiently to defende them: And no maruel for their ennemies were mo in nombre than they: and compased them about on euery syde of them. But finally the romayne soudyours which were bothe of olde and newe: and therfore bothe strong / bolde / and crafty in batayle: gathered them as nere togyder as they myght. And where it fortuned any nombre of them to mete togyder: they tourned backe to backe / & ioyned them rounde one with an other in maner of a compase or cercle: and so they saued & defended themselfe togyder that on the backehalfe no man coude assayle them: but yf he brake in through the myddes of them whiche was in maner impossible. By this maner they sustayned the myght of their ennemies: and also saued themselfe. Nor their captayne Marius in this ieopardous and sharpe besynes was nat affrayed at al / nor of lesse corage and boldnesse than he was before: but styred about euery where

in the batayle. And his men of garde about hym whome he had chosen rather of the strongest and boldest men of the host / than of such as were moost familier with hym. For he set more by the audacite of them / thā by the familiarite of the other: and namely in such a ieopardous case. Sōtyme he socoured his soudyours in their nede / or such as he sawe in paryl. And somtyme he ran in amonge his ennemies: where they were thyckest. And nat withstandyng their resystence he assayled them valiantly: and wounded / slewe / and ouerthrue them on euery syde he dyed his weapen in the reed blode of the blacke Mauriens and Getuliens. And bycause that in so harde a case: and in so great and troublous noyse & rumour / he coude nat counsel nor confort his soudyours with his tong / therfore he thought to counsel / incorage / and confort them with his hande / gyuyng them example surely to bestowe their strokes. Many of his ennemies sende he to hel cryeng in vayne vpon their ydo
                           •
                        les for helpe. The dartes / iauelyns pykes / plumettes of leed / stones / with other suche instrumentes of batayle wer cast so thicke on both parties / that the ayre therwith was indymed. The strokes were so coursly charged on the bright helmes and harnesse / that the fyre sprange out on euery syde: so that it semed to be the lyghtnyng: the cry of the men dyeng: the neyeng of the horses: and the dyn of the strokes / with the sounde of the trumpettes: was horryble and tedyous to here. Thus continued they tyl the day lyght was passed / and the nyght come. The numidyans / getulians / and maurians desysted nor ceassed nothing for that. But as both Iugurth and Bocchus before had warned & cōmaunded them: they continued more sharpely than before / thynking that the darkenesse of the nyght shulde be for their auātage. Marius this vnderstādyng toke counsel & made best ꝓuision for hymselfe & his men: whiche he myght in suche case: and as the mater required. And to thintent that his people myght haue some place to resort vnto / for refuge & socours: he prouyded before and ocupyed two hylles nere togyder of whome the one was ouer narowe / & of lytel groūde to receyue his hole army & tentes: but in the top therof was a fayre fountayne of pure water moch necessary. The other hyl was sufficiētly large to receyue his hole hoost and tentes: and also very defensyue / for it was of a great altitude and done right on euery syde. Insomoche that they whiche shulde take that hyl were sure ynough without great defence of themselfe / for nature had it sufficiently defended. This wel considred: Marius commaunded Sylla his vndercapten to take with hym al the horsmen / and to tary that nyght about the smaller hyl where the fountayne was.

This done: he hymselfe gathered togyder by lytel and lytel the remanent of his soudyours dispersed abrode: their ennemies being nat lesse troubled than were they. Whan Marius had thus assembled agayne his men togyder he led them all with ful cours vp vnto the larger hyl. Thus the two kynges Iugurth & Bocchus seyng it in vayne to fyght with thē whiche were on the hyer groūde / and also on so sure a place: were cōstrayned to leaue the fyght: for difficultie of the place which the romayns had taken. But neuertheles in the meane tyme they suffred nat their men to depart far thens: but compased bothe the hylles roūd about with their hole multitude & there taryed & rested / shed abrode vpon the ground. Whan they had taken their place in this maner: they made great fiers here & there in many places of their hoost: and the barbarians after their custome passed forth the most part of the night in myrth / pleasure / & gladnes / reioysing / daunsyng: and making great noyse and dyn: rennyng and goyng from place to place: and loudly crieng / synging and reuellyng. The kynges themselfe were also nat a lytel proude and fearse: bycause they had nat fled from the batayle: and counted themselfe as ouercomers seyng that they helde the romayns so besieged which as they thought durst nat abyde them. On the other part the romaīs intētyfly gaue aduertēs to the demeanour of their ennemies. And for that the romayns were on the hyght of the hyl and without lyght: therfore more easy from darknesse of hyer places they parceyued al the dedes and behauour of their ennemies which were beneth them: and moch more euidently by light of the fyers. This vnwyse behauour of the numidiens put the romayns in great confort and was great courage to them. And specially Marius was greatly confermed in hope seyng their negligence / their folly / and vncraftinesse: wherfore he cōmaunded his folke to kepe sylence as styl as might be possible without any noyse. In somoche that he suffred nat the trūpetes to soūde the watche: as warryours ar wont agaynst night. Afterwarde whan the day began to apere: the numidiens were al weryed wt their cryeng / ouerlate watchyng / and reuel: and had gyuen thēselfe to rest a lytel before as men without feare or dout of ye romayns. But certenly it is a true ꝓuerbe which is often sayd: that after fayre wether succedeth tēpestious cloudes: and aft myrth & ioye often cometh sadnes and sorowe. So it hapened to the numidyēs. For whyle they ingorged & fylled with wynes lay slepyng on the grounde as beestes without fere & without ꝓuision: Marius cōmaūded sodenly all his trumpetes & clarionistes with other mynstrels to sound their instrumētes as shyrle as they coude altogyder

and that al his soudyours shulde set vp a shout or cry as horribly as they myght: and with that inuade and breke into the tentes of the numidyens. This was shortly done: wherfore the numidyens / mauriens / & getuliens astonyed and abasshed with that vnknowen and horryble noyse: were sodenly awakened of sleape: and seyng them thus cōpased with their ennemies: what for feare of deth and of the noyse they were so amased that they had no power neyther to fle nor to drawe to them their armour / nor vtterly to do or prouid any maner socour for themselfe. Thus they stode astonyed for this horrible noyse and cry as yf madnesshe had entred them: none able to socour hymselfe nor other. The romayns alway increased to them their noyse and feare assayling / murdring / and woundyng them without any resystence. Finally al they were outher ouerthrowen / slayne / or woūded: or els fled their armor / standerdes and weapen left behynde them: and mo were in this batayle slayne: than in al the batels before. For amonge them al none was taken prisoner: for with fere and sleape so amased were they / that fewe escaped by flight.

                        WHan Marius had gloriously thus ouer come the moost part of his ennemies except the two kyngꝭ: he drue hym than towarde his wyntring places as he had purposed before. And ordred hymselfe & his men specially in hauen townes bycause of more easy ꝓuision of vytels: but neuertheles: in his iournay thyderwarde: for al his victory: he becam nat negligent / vnware / nor proude: as captayns often ar wont aft victory goten of their ennemies: but he ꝓuided and went forwarde with his army quadrat and deuided into four partes ordred & apoynted as if his ennemies had ben in his sight Sylla was assigned to take charge of the ryght wyng of the army and al the spear men with hym. And Aulus Manlius of the lyft wyng. And with hym the slyngars / archers / & the cohortes of Lumbardes. The peticapitayns with fotemen of lyght harnesse: were distributed and dyuided in the vantgarde and rerewarde. Of the treatours whiche had forsaken Iugurth and came to the romayns: suche as were best laboured

and knewe best the contrey / were chosen forth and sent out to espy the contrey and wayes of Iugurth & Bocchus. But nat withstandyng Marius hymselfe was as prouident / circūspect / and diligent withal: as if he had cōmytted the charge to none other. He was mouyng cōtinually from place to place ouer all the army: laudyng / cōmendyng / and rewardyng the good soudyors: and blamyng and rebukyng the bad he hym selfe armed / and diligently prouidyng and ministryng vnto them euery thyng necessary and expedient: and cōpelled them that were frowarde and ylwillyng to labour. In euery place where he set his tentes in his iournay: he ordred defence with depe dyches and trenches rounde about his hoost. And in the entres of the tentes he assigned soudyors elect therto to kepe watch and some to kepe scoutwatch about the tentes in compasse. Moreouer some other he ordred on the castynge of the dyches and on outwarde bulwarkes to defende the remanent if any sodayne peryl apered. He hymselfe armed nyghtly wēt about and serched the watch. Nat specially for any feare nor mystrust of any paryl to come nor for feare that his soudyours wold nat obey his cōmaundemēt. But specially to thentent that the loudyours seyng their captayne nat refusyng labour nor paryl: shuld be also more wylling to folowe the same and to take payne vpon themselfe as ashamed if they dyd nat asmoch as their captayn. And certenly at this tyme & at many other during this warre (as I rede) Marius cōstrayned his soudyors to labour rather for shame thā wt sharpnes or punisshemēt. For shame it is to the seruant to be ydle whā the maister sore laboreth. Howbeit some sayd that Marius toke this labour vpon hym for the desyre of cōmendacion & worshyp: bycause that frō his youth he was euer wont with hardnesse / hunger / thirst / and labour: and many other thynges whiche the delycate gentylmen of our tyme count for miseries. But to Marius were these hardnesses moche pleasure and delyte for affection whiche he had agaynst the commen wayle / as equal persones supposed. But to what euer intent Marius: treated his army in this wyse: it was knowen that his dedes dyd asmoche profet and worshyp to the commen wayle of Rome: as if he had more rigorously and sharpely treated his soudyours. For al thynges were ordred wel and worthely for the honour and profet of the commen wayle: as if he had more rigorously treated his army.
                     ¶But to retourne to my purpose: whan Marius with suche dyligence as sayd is: was come nat far from the towne of Cirtha / at the last the fourth day after the forsayd batayle: the espyes of their ennemies appered on euery syde. The romaīs

vnderstode anone therby that their ennemies were at hande. The espyes of the romains also which were sende forth: brought the same tidynges from euery coost of the coūtrey. Marius perceyued that his ennemies were in diuerse cōpanyes and deuided: wherfore he was vncertayne howe he myght best order his hoost to receyue them: And therfore perceyuing it vnsure: how to order the forfront of his batayle as it ought: he abode his ennemies in the same place no order chaunged with his hoost deuyded in .iiii. partes (as sayd is) as he whiche was redy and prouyded for euery chaūce. Thus was Iugurth disceyued and frustrate of his purpose. For he had deuyded his hoost into four partes trustynge to inuade some of the romayns on the backehalfe with parte of his army: and with an other part to encoūter with them / and with the other two partes to enclose them on both the sydes: and so to enuyron them rounde about. In the mean tyme Sylla which first encountred with Iugurth exhorted & cōforted his men aswel as he might for breuite of the tyme. That done: anone he proceded with his company by bendes & clustres togyder / their horses conioyned in the moost thyckest maner: and so fiersly assayled the Maurians. The remanent of the fotemen whiche were vnder Sylla: remayned and kept themselfe styl in their first place: and defended their bodyes from the dartes whiche their ennemies thrue agaynst them from farre. But if it chaunsed any of their ennemies to come bytwene their handes: they hewed them downe to decrease the nombre. ¶Whyle Sylla and his horsmen thus fiersly were fightyng on the right wyng of the batayle: The kyng Bocchus assembled togyder the fotemen whome his son named Volux / had brought thyder with hym. These fotemen had suche impediment in their iournay thyderwarde that they came ouerlate to the other batayle whiche was last foughten before this. Wherfore Bocchus: whan he had assembled & inbolded with his wordꝭ these fresshe fotemen: with them he assayled fiersly the rerewarde of the romayns.
                     ¶In the meane tyme Marius hymself was occupyed in the forwarde of his hoost and there employed his wysdome and strength / as a valyant and worthy captayne: and so stode it hym in hande. For in the forwarde Iugurth hymselfe with his grettest power & strōgest cōpany of men inbatayled with hym. ¶But after that Iugurth knewe of the cōmyng of Bocchus to the felde: anone he turned hym with a smal cōpany about hym priuely vnto the fotemen of the romayns: and there with an hye voyse he cried vnto them / sayng that they fought but in vayne. For a lytel before he had slayne Marius

with his owne handes. And in cryeng these wordes he lyfted vp withal / and shewed his swerde al ouersprincled and dyed with blode: whiche he had so couloured in the batayle fiersly ynough in murdring the fotemen of the romayns. These wordes Iugurth cryed in latyn tong. For he had lerned to speke latyn longe before in the batayle of Numaunce. Whan the romayns herde these wordes they were affrayed / but more for crueltie of the noyse: than for any confidence or trust whiche they had to the messanger. But on ye other syde the myndes of the barbariens wer bolded & exalted by these wordes: by reason wherof more sharpely they inuaded the romayns / seynge them abasshed & astonyed. And nowe were the romains of the forwarde at that poynt that they were redy to gyue themselfe to flyght: as men dyscouraged for the sayd tidynges. ¶Whan they were at this poynt: it fortuned so at the same tyme that Sylla had beaten and ouerthrowen the mauriens which inuaded and assayled hym on the right wyng of the batayle: wherfore he retourned to his cōpany & fiersly assayled the fresshe fotemen which wer with Bocchus / and at one syde brake in amonge the thyckest of them. But Bocchus anone tourned his backe: and gaue hymselfe to flyght.
                     ¶On the othersyde Iugurth which in his part of the batayle almost had optayned vyctory dyd his diligence to incourage & support his cōpany: and to mentayne that auātage whiche he had won. And at cōclusion al in vayne. For whyle he laboured there about as a worthy captayne: the spear men of the romayns so cōpased hym & his cōpany about both on ye right syde & on the lyft: that al his garde & other which were about hym at conclusion were slayne. But he hymselfe glad to saue his lyfe / brake forth alone from among ye myddes of his ennemies: and from wepyns and dartes with great difficuly. ¶But in the meane tyme Marius had ouercome & driuen away the horsmen which assayled hym. Wherfore anone he returned fiersly to helpe and socours of his company whome he vnderstode somwhat put backe by violēce of their ennemies. But he by his policy and valiant dedes anone so reconforted his men that none of his ennemies were able to withstande their violence in any part of that batayle.
                     ¶Thus finally the romayns after great labour and many greuous woundes disconfited their ennemies on euery syde. But whan the batayle was ended and the romayns began to pursue the chase: than verily it was a pytefull and horrible syght to beholde in the open feldes and to consyder the cruel spectacle of batayle. Howe some fled: Some pursued / some inraged murdring / some rored dyeng / some slayne / some taken

prisoners. The horse and men mengled togyder: labouring in the panges of deth. The ground ouerspred with deed corpses mangled / mutulate / and horribly hewyn: inuolued in blode cōgeled. The horse wounded: as mad drewe after them the deed carcases of their maisters / their legges hangyng in the styropes / and their speares halfe thorowe their bodyes trayling after in the dust. The coursers wounded and fleyng cast vp with their fete the dust tempered with blode rennyng ouer the deed bodyes of their lordes. Many of the Numidiēs which were sore wounded coude neyther fle: nor be suffred to take rest on the grounde. Somtyme they laboured to ryse & auoyde: and anone after for feblenes fel downe to the ground agayne: eche rowlyng & turnyng in other blode. And finally: as far as any mannes syght myght extende / al the grounde was ouerspred and couered with armour / wepen / and deed caryons rennyng of blode. And al the ground infect with the same / horryble to beholde.
                  
                  
                     ¶Howe Bocchus after that he was thus twyse ouercom in batel / purposed to make peace with the romains: and howe at his request Marius sende vnto hym Sylla and Manlius to knowe his mynde in that behalfe. ¶The .lviii. Chapiter.
                     
                        AFter that this batel was thus ended to the vtter damage & distruction of the Numidyans: and to the laude & honour of the romayns. Marius was nowe without dout ouercomer & victour and went vnto the towne of Cirtha as his iournay and purpose was at first begynnyng before these two batayls. Whan Marius had soiourned there fyue dayes aft this batayle: there came vnto hym embassadors frō kyng Bocchus. Whiche in their kyngꝭ behalfe desyred of Marius to sende vnto hym two of the most trusty men whiche he had: sayng that he wold cōmen & treate with them of dyuers besynesses both for his owne profet / & for ꝓfet & auātage of the romains also. Marius without tary sende forth Sylla for one: and Aulus Manlius for an other. Whan they were come to kyng Bocchus: howbeit he had sende for them to cōmen with them in his maters. Neuertheles it was cōcluded bytwene them to speke to hym first to thentent to kyndell and inflame his mynde the more agaynst Iugurth: or els seyng hym somwhat desyrous and wyllyng to haue peace to prouoke hym wt more desyre therto. Wherfore Sylla (to whom Manlius gaue place nat for his age / bur for his eloquence) began & spake to Bocchus in maner: as foloweth.

                        KIng Bocchus we haue great gladnes and ioye syth it is so that the goddes haue thus admonisshed & enspired you so noble a man that at last ye haue reputed peace better & more acceptable than war: lest ye myght dishonest & defyle your worthynesse by associating yourselfe to the moost vnhappy tyran Iugurth. And also we ar glad that ye haue auoyded the occasion & necessite: wherby we were moued to pursue in batayle: you beyng ignorant of our quarel: and in the cōpany of ye sayd most cursed Iugurth tyran & ennemy to thempyre of Rome. And certenly ye people of Rome euer syth their poore / simple / & smal begynning haue thought it better to wyn frēdes than seruātes or bondmen and also they haue thought it a moch surer thyng to haue vnder their empire suche as wyllingly & of their owne mocion wolde yelde thēselfe: than such as they haue cōstrayned therto agaynst their wyl. But verily no frendshyp is more necessary to you than our amyte or frendshyp. At first of al: bycause we and ye be farre in sonder: wherby we shal haue les power to greue you / or to put you to any charge: by reason of our frendshyp. But our fauour & thankes may be as redy to you: as if we were nere togyder: cōsydering the many & great frendes whiche we haue nat far from your marches. And also vnto thempire of Rome be obeyers / subgettes & seruantes abundantly. But as touchyng louers & frendes we nor none other can haue sufficiently ynough. For this consideracion kynge Bocchus your frēdshyp shalbe more acceptable vnto vs. And wolde god it had pleased you thus to haue done at the begynning of this war. Forsoth if ye had so done: than shulde ye before this tyme haue receyued of the romayns mo cōmodites / auantages / and good dedes than ye haue nowe suffred losse / damages / or hurtes. But whyle it is so that mannes dedes & besynesses (for the moost part) be ruled by fortune: to whiche fortune it hath pleased that ye shuld both proue and assay our myght and violence in batayle: and also our loue & fauour in peace: Therfore nowe syht amytie is proferred to you by suffraunce of fortune: and syth it is lauful to you to take it: be nat slowe from hens forwarde / but hastely procede as ye haue begon: that ye may proue the romayns frendes to you lyke as ye haue proued them ennemies before this tyme. Ye haue many expedient oportunites & necessary cōmodites by whome ye may make amendes wt your good dedes for that ye haue offē

newe kyndnesses and benefites: and finally fix this in your hert that ye or any other shal neuer ouercome the peple of Rome with kyndnes or good dedes. And as touchynge their hatered / and of what myght they ar in batayle: yet yourselfe knowe that by profe & experience. Wherfore procede in acquiring of their frendshyp: whiche gladly shalbe graunted vnto you / if your merites shal so deserue.

                        TO these wordes of Sylla answered Bocchus myldely and soberly: and a fewe wordes he spake in excusing his offence done agayne the romayns / sayeng that he had nat taken armour nor begon war agaynst them as ennemy to do iniury or wrong vnto them: but to defende his owne kyngdome. And that the thirde part of Numidy belonged vnto hym by lawe of armes: of the which the romayns laboured to expel Iugurth. And in that doyng they distroyed his part of the contrey: whiche he coude nat suffer vnreuenged. Moreouer Bocchus sayd for hymselfe that he had sende vnto Rome before to require amyte and frendshyp of the romayns: which thing vnto hym was denyed. But at cōclusion he sayd: that he wolde omyt & lay a part al olde malyce & that althyng shulde be done and agreed bytwene them: yf Marius wolde graūt hym that his embassadours might be sende to Rome: for the sayd frendship to be cōfederate with ye romains. Vpon this answere Sylla & his felawe retourned to Marius whiche anone agreed yt the same embassadors shuld be sēt to Rome. But shortly after: what tyme Iugurth vnderstode of the cōmyng of Sylla & Manlius he feared the same thyng / whiche was ordend & in hande. And anone wt rewardes so he corrupted the frendes of Bocchus: that agayn they chaūged his mynde with their counsel: so mutable and variable was he of mynde.
                  
                  
                     ¶How Bocchus chan̄ged his purpose yet ones agayne: and sende newe embassadours to Marius to treat of the peace: and howe Sylla receyued and treated them in absence of Marius. ¶The .lxi. chapyter.
                     
                        
                        IN the meane tyme Marius set and ordred his hoost in their wyntring places & toke wt hym such men as were of lyght harnesse: and also a part of his horsemen: & with them went into a desart nat far thens / to besige a certayne towre belongyng to Iugurth: into whiche towre the sayd Iugurth had put for garnyson & defence: al the treators which had forsaken & fled from the romayns to Iugurth. But in the mean whyle Bocchus of new agayne cōsydred in mynde the misfortune whiche had hapened to hym ī the two batayls before. Or els by counsel of some other of his frendes: whome Iugurth had nat corrupted with rewardꝭ: he chose forth among al .v. men whose fidelite & trueth he had wel knowen & often proued before: and whose wysdome was most expert & redy. Them sende he to Marius: & cōmaūded them afterwarde if the mater required as embassadors to take their way to Rome: and cōmitted to them his ful authorite in euery thyng which was to be done: and to cōclude the war by what euer maner shuld seme best / and moost expediēt to their discrecion. These embassadours toke le
                           •
                        e & spedely toke their iournay to the places where the romayns soiourned the wynter season. But whyle they wer ī their iournay thyderwarde: they were assayled of theues of the getulians / and robbed & spoyled of al that they had about them. Thus at last without worshyp or apparel: all affrayed & abasshed they fled vnto Sylla for refuge. This Sylla was left by Marius in the wynteryng places: to be ruler of the romayne army in his absence. What tyme these embassadors: thus spoyled were come to Sylla for refuge / he receyued them nat fayntly as vayne & vnstable ennemies as they deserued: but curteysly with moch gentylnes & liberalite / treatynge them in al poyntes honorably. By this meanes these barbariās & rude people counted and supposed that the name of couetyse / whiche was imputed vnto the romayns by cōmen fame was but false & fayned of their ennemies / to distayne their honour. And also for the moch liberalite of Sylla: they counted hym as their special frende. For yet vnto that tyme: the accloyeng of gyftes gyuen for rewardes for policy & falshode to ouercōe couetous or simple myndes / was vnknowen vnto many. No man was liberal ī gyftꝭ: but that he was thought & coūted to be faythful of hert withal. Thus the barbarians reputed the liberte & rewardꝭ of Sylla to be a great & euident token of loue which he had to them: as they demed. But to our purpose: the embassadours anone opened & declared to Sylla the wyl & cōmaundemēt of Bocchus their kyng: gyuen to them to be excuted: And also they

required hym to be vnto them a frendly fauourer & counsellour in their besynesse. Farthermore with their wordes and spech they cōmended & exalted the army / the trueth / the greatnes & excellence of their kyng: and al other thyngꝭ which they thought might auayle them to optayne benyuolēce of the romayns. After they remayned with Sylla about the space of xl. dayes: whiche graunted them al his helpe and socour and also in the mean space enfourmed them in what maner they shulde order their wordes whan they shulde speke with Marius / and also before the senatours at Rome.

                        IN the mean tyme Marius whiche was in assaut of the kynges towre coude nat perfourme his enterprise. Wherfore he retourned againe to Cirtha: anone was he certified of cōmyng of the imbassadours of Bocchus. Wherfore he cōmaunded them & Sylla also to come before hym: and also he called togyder all the moost worthy men of his hole hoost from euery place. Before them al presently he cōmaunded the imbassadours of Bocchus to reherse the petycion of their kyng (which rehersed & harde) it was graunted vnto them to go Rome for the same poyntes. And of Marius was truesse required in the meane tyme bytwene Bocchus and hym. Sylla with many other noble mē were pleased withall. A fewe other fiersly and sharply coūselled otherwyse: as men without pyte and ignorant of others harde fortune whiche whan it begynneth to be frowarde and contrary: it tourneth euery thynge to aduersyte.
                     ¶But whan ye mauriens had obtayned of Marius al their desyre: thre of them went to Rome with one named Octauyus Rufo: whom Marius had assigned to conuey thē thyder This Octauyus Rufo was sende before from Rome into Affrike to Marius with wages for the soudyours. The other two imbassadors of Bocchus returned home agayne to their kyng: whiche of them gladly harde of the good report whiche they made of the Romayns in euery poynt: and specially of the good wyl / lyberalite / and courtesy of Sylla. ¶But whan the other thre imbassadours were come to Rōe they apered before the senatours and in the humblest wyse yt they coude deuise / dyd their message excusynge their kynge:

and confessyng that he had offended agaynst the empyre nat by his owne sekyng: but by the cursed faut prouocacion / and instygation of Iugurth: wherof their kynge sore repented. Wherfore in his behalfe at conclusyon they besought the romayns of pardon / amyte / and peace. Than was it brefely answered to them in this maner.

                        WHan Bocchus vnderstode al these thinges: he desyred Marius by his letters to sende vnto hym Sylla: to thentent yt after his aduyse & discression coūsel might be had of the cōmen besynesse to bothe parties belōgyng. Sylla anone was send forth wt a great retynue of fotemen & horsemē: with diuerse weapen & stronge defēce as archars / slyngars / with otherlike. And to thyntēt to spede their iournay more hastely: they were al armed wt lightest harnes which coude be ꝓuided but for al the lightnes of their armour it was defēsite ynough agaynst the weapyns of the mauryans: for their wepyns be light in likewyse. But finally whan Sylla had passed fyue dayes of his iournay: sodenly Volux the son of Bocchus apered and shewed hymselfe to the romayns in the open feldes: with no mo but. M. men which went scatered and dyspersed abrode neglygētly: so that they semed to Sylla: and al other a greatter nombre than they were in dede. Sylla and al his company feared them / thinkynge them ennemies: wherfore the romayns made them redy with armour and weapen: to defende themselfe / and to resyst their ennemies: if nede shulde so requyre. A lytel feare was amonge them: but their hope and confort ouerpassed their feare. For why? they had the vpper hande before: and consydred that they shulde bycker with them whome they had often ouerthrowen and ouercome before. In the meane tyme the horsemen whiche were sent before of both parties to espy ye trueth of the mater / certified eche

of them that al thyng was quyet and sure ynough: as it was in dede: without treason or paryl. Volux in his metyng called Sylla by name: and welcomed hym benyngely / sayeng that he was sent from his father Bocchus to mete the sayd Sylla for his honour / socour / & defence. And so proceded they forthewarde al this day and the next day after in company togyder without feare or daunger. But after that it was nyght & their tentes pytched: sodenly the maurian Volux came rennyng to Sylla al pale & quakyng: and sayd that he was infourmed of the espyes / that Iugurth was nat far thens. And with that prayed & exhorted hym to fle away wt hym priuely by nyght. Sylla denyed that vtterly as fierse and bolde of courage / sayeng that he feared nat a cowarde numidyan: which so often had ben ouercome before. And that he trusted wel ynough to the strength & courage of his men: and finally he gaue Volux this answere. If I knewe without dout that our sure distruction were instāt: and that I and myne shuld be slayne in the felde / yet wold I nat fle for any drede: but rather abyde and dye manfully: than cowardely to flee & shame my people of whome I haue charge in sparyng our lyues / whiche be so incertayne & vnsure: and parauenture shortly after this shal fynisshe with some sickenes or dysease. Is it nat better to dye in a noble quarel manly / thā to lyue ī shame cowardly? Whan Sylla had thus answered: than Volux coūselled hym to depart from that place & to remoue forward by nyght. Therto Sylla cōsented: and anone cōmaunded his soudyours to refresshe them in their tentes with such vitels as they had / and to make plenty of fiers ouer al the place to the intent that yf their ennemies were nere: in beholdyng the fiers they shulde thynke that they wolde nat remoue thens that nyght. But in the first hour of the night Sylla cōmaunded al his soudyors to leaue their fiers brennynge and so to depart forwarde in their iournay with scilence: so they dyd. And went al the night long: and euyn with the sonne rysinge they al beyng weryed: Sylla pytched his tentes agayne. With that certayne horsemen of the mauriens brought word that Iugurth had taken place to his tentes: and rested about the distance of two myle before them. Whan these tidynges were harde among the romayns: a meruelous & great fear entred the myndes of them al. For they thought themselfe betrayed of Volux. And so enuyrounde with falshode & treason. Many aduysed to take punisshemēt of Volux: sayeng that it was a thyng vnworthy to suffre hym to escape vnpunysshed for so great a myschefe and treason agaynst them commytted. But howbeit that Sylla was inwardly of the same opynion: neuertheles he defended

the maurian from dammage. And exhorted his men to be of strong & bolde myndes: sayeng that often before that tyme it had ben sene that a fewe worthy men had won victory of a moche multitude of cowardꝭ. And howe moch the lesse that they spared their bodyes in batayle fro fightyng: somoch the surer shuld they be: and that it semed no man to whome god & nature had gyuen handes to defende his body: to sicke defence in his fete vnarmed by rennyng away. And that in suche a ieopardy / a noble soudyour ought nat to tourne away his body from his ennemy / though he were naked and vnarmed. ¶Whan Sylla had exhorted his men with suche wordes: he called vnto hym Volux: and called in to wytnesse Iupyter and al his ydols to recorde the falshode and treason of Bocchus / father of Volux: which had so betrayed hym. Than for asmoch as Sylla supposed that Volux had brought hym by treason into handes of Iugurth by counsel & cōmaundement of his father Bocchus he cōmaunded Volux anone to depart from his cōpany syght / Volux pytuously wepyng: besought Sylla nat to byleue suche thingꝭ in hym: & sayd that certenly by gyle nor by treason was nothyng done of him nor of his father: but rather by Iugurth which by his subtilte had espyed & serched their iournay & wayes by his espies & so knowen the same. But at cōclusion said Volux: syth it is so that Iugurth hath no great cōpany & that his hope / his trust & confort for ye moost part dependeth on my father: I thinke that he shal nat be so bolde to do any damage to you openly whyle I am in your cōpany: which may recorde his dedꝭ to my father. Wherfore Sylla to thentent that ye may parceyue that no treason is in me: I shal openly go with you alone by ye myddes of the tentes of Iugurth & so sauely conuey you: and other sēde my folke before: or els leaue thē hexe with your company whyther of both shal please you best. This coūsel was alowed of Sylla: & anone without tary he proceded forwarde with al his cō
                        pany through myddes of the tentes of Iugurth. And bycause this was sodenly done: Iugurth nat knowyng therof before / he meruayled moch therat: & douted long what was to be done. But at last he suffred the romayns to passe & to escape saufe and soūde for loue of Volux / and drede of Bocchus his father. And within a fewe dayes after: Volux and Sylla with their company came to Bocchus: whether they intended.
                  
                  
                     ¶Of the metyng and secrete apoyntmentes bytwene Bocchus and Sylla: and howe bytwene them both they abused Asper / the imbassadour of Iugurth. ¶The .lxiiii. chapyter.
                     
                        
                        AT the same season was with Bocchus a certayne numidyan named Asper / sende before Bocchus frō Iugurth / by craft and subtylte: to espy his coūsel / assone as it was hard that Bocchus had sende for Sylla. This numidyan was moch & familierly cōuersāt with Bocchus at that tyme. Moreouer there was an other named Dabar the son of Massagrade: which of his fathers syde was of the stocke of Massinissa. But of his mothers syde vnlyke of byrth: for his mother was borne of a cōcubine. This Dabar (as I haue sayd) was at this season also in the cōpany of Bocchus: and to hym dere and welbeloued for subtel wyt and great actes whiche he had done before: and namely bycause that Bocchus had founde & proued hym trusty & faythful many tymes before. Anone Bocchus sende this Dabar to Sylla commaundyng Dabar to shewe hym yt he was redy to do euery thyng which ye romains to hym wolde cōmaunde or assigne. And that Sylla hymself shuld apoynt / & chose a tyme & place where they might cōmen togyder of their maters: and that he shulde nat fere nor dout though the embassadoure of Iugurth were there with hym. For he had reserued all thyngꝭ touchyng their coūsel hole tyll cōmyng of Sylla: & of nothyng had apoynted / cōmuned / nor cōcluded with the same imbassadour of Iugurth. Which imbassadour was called thyder to thyntent that their cōmen besynesses might be done more at lybertie & with lesse suspection of Iugurth: for by other meanes they coude nat resyst nor make ꝓuision agaynst his gyles. Such wordes sende Bocchus to Sylla: by his trusty seruant Dabar. But natwtstandynge al these fayre promisses of Bocchus it was vnderstande yt he ꝓlonged the romayns & the numidyans in hope of peace / rather for falshode & treason after the credēce of affrycans: than for profet to the romayns or trouth of such thyngꝭ as he ꝓmysed to Sylla. And often tymes he cast in his mynde & douted whether he might betray Iugurth to ye romayns: or els Sylla to Iugurth: the pleasure & desyre of his mynd aduised / moued / & coūselled hym agaynst the romayns: but the drede whiche he had of punisshment in tyme to come: moued hym with ye romayns. But to our purpose: Sylla answered to Dabar the messanger of Bocchus that the wolde come thyder / & firste speke a lytel of the peace & of suche other thynges in presēce of Asper the imbassadour of Iugurth: but cōcernyng the remenant of the besynesse: he wolde dyffer that to cōmen secretly wt Bocchus / fewe or none called to counsel. And also he taught Dabar what wordes Bocchus shulde answere vnto hym

agayne / whan they shulde come to cōmunicacion: and so departed Dabar. But whan Sylla sawe his tyme he went to Bocchus / and sayd that he was sent from Marius the consul to enquire if he wold leuer peace or war: and wheron he wold cōclude. Than Bocchus (as Dabar had warned hym before) cōmaūded Sylla to retourne agayne afterd .x. dayes: and thā shulde an answere be gyuen vnto hym. For at that tyme nothyng was cōcluded. That answere wel noted & harde Asper the embassadour of Iugurth 
                           •
                         whiche was sent to espy the intreatement: and so thought he that nothyng shulde be treated nor cōcluded without his knowlege. And thus after this answere Bocchus and Sylla departed: eche to their tentes.
                  
                  
                     ¶Of the seconde cōmyng togyder of Bocchus and of Sylla: and of the wordes of Bocchus had to Sylla: and replycation and answere of Sylla agayne to hym. And how Bocchus graunted & concluded to betray Iugurth to the romayns. ¶The .lxv. chapyter.
                     
                        BVt after that moche of the night was ouerpassed: Bocchus priuely sende for Sylla none beyng in their company / saue such as on both parties myght truely interprit and declare the sentence and vnderstandyng of their wordꝭ. And also Dabar the sayd messanger / was present whiche solemly swore and promised to be faythful interpretour of both their sayenges / and sentences. Than Bocchus anone began his wordes in this sentence.
                     ¶I haue thought forsoth: that it shulde neuer haue fortuned that I the greattest kynge of al them in these landes: and rychest of al them that I knowe: shuld haue ben bounde a mean & priuate person. And forsoth Sylla or euer I hard of you: I haue gyuen helpe & socours to many other men. To some of myne owne voluntary and frewyl. And to some other: required of them: my selfe nat nedyng helpe of any man. But now syth I haue knowen you: I haue nede of your helpe and frendshyp of which I am glad: nat withstandyng other men ar wont to be sory of such fortune. And certenly this nede whiche I haue of your frenshyp is nat of me counted damage nor losse: but moche profet and pleasure. For inwardly in my mynde nothyng is derer / nor more acceptable: whiche ye may

conueniently proue if it please you: demand & take of me armour / men / treasour: and finally what euer it pleaseth you in your mynde: and vse & occupy the same as your owne. And thynke ye for certayne that whyle ye lyue & I togyder: I can neuer render worthy thankes vnto your kyndnes: nor condignely recompence your great humanite: but euer my good wyl & mynde shalbe hole and newe agaynst you. And certenly if I may knowe your mynde & wyl: ye shal nought nede to desyre of me: I shal preuent your requestes with my benefytes: so that ye shal coueyt nothyng in vayne. Verely as I thynke it is lesse reprouable and lesse dyshonour a kyng to be ouercōe with armour: than with liberalite. Wherfore I haue concluded in mynde that a man shal rather ouercome me in batayle with weapen & force of armes: than with liberalite.
                     ¶But touchyng your commen wayle (for whose besynes ye be sende hyther as procuratour of the same) this is my sentence and mynde in fewe wordes. Agaynst the romayns / nor agaynst their empire: I neuer moued nor made war: nor to make batayle agaynst them: it was neuer ī my mynde by my wyl. But the boundys of my marchesse haue I endeuoured me to defende agaynst the violence of your armed men. But this I leaue & set a syde: syth I se that it pleaseth you to do the same: execute & continue ye batayle with Iugurth as ye wyl. And as touchyng me: I shal nat ouerpasse the water of Mulucha / whiche was boundes bytwene my marches and Micipsa whyle he lyued. Nor into my countrey I shal nat suffre Iugurth from hens forthe: to entre for socours / as he hath done in tymes passed. Farthermore if ye desyre any thyng of me conueniently: which I may worthely graunt / my royalte nat distayned: it shal nat be denyed vnto you. Thus concluded Bocchus his wordes.
                     ¶Vnto these wordes Sylla answered for his owne part but moderately and with fewe wordes. But touchyng the peace and besynesse concernyng the commen wayle: he spake many wordes / wherof the conclusion was suche.
                     ¶Kynge Bocchus I insure and promesse you: that the romayns shal nat be vnkynde to you if ye do some pleasure to them: which may rather long to thē al holly in comen: than in me alone. And thynke ye for certayne: that they whiche haue ouercome you in batayle: shal lykewyse ouercome you wt liberalite / kyndnesse / and good dedes: if ye so contende with thē: which thyng is nowe redy in your power to do: consydering that I haue Iugurth redy at your wyl and pleasure. Therfore among al benefites or pleasurs: ye can do none more acceptable vnto the romayns: than to delyuer vnto theym Iugurth.

By this meanes shal they be moche beholden to you: and thynke ye stedfastly: it shal nat be vnrewarded on our behalfe. For than shal the Senate graunt vnto you amyte and peace: and also a part of numidy whiche ye do nowe clayme: shul than be graunted vnto you vnrequired.
                     ¶Bocchus heryng these wordes of Sylla: first excused him selfe by the affinyte whiche was bytwene hym and Iugurth: and by the longe familyarite & aquayntance whiche they had togyder: sayeng also that a bonde of peace was confyderate and sworne bytwene them. And also that he fered & suspected that if he so dyd: his owne subgettꝭ shulde hate hym therfore whiche moche loued Iugurth: & greatly hated the romayns. But nat withstandyng these wordes of Bocchus: Sylla desysted nat to attyse and counsel hym: tyl at last he agreed and cōsented to his desyre / promysing to do euery thyng as Syl

                        a requyred hym. But to thyntent to fayne a treaty of peace (of whiche Iugurth weryed in warre was moche desyrous) they ordayned suche craft: as to their purpose semed most expedyent. But whan they had ymagined and deuysed al thynges after theyr myndes: than both they departed in sonder: and retourned agayne to their rest.

                        ON the morowe after Bocchus called to hym Asper the imbassadour of Iugurth / and sayd to hym that he vnderstode of Sylly by the interpretacion of Dabar that the war might be

And within .viii. dayes aft sende hym agayne to Bocchus. Whan Asper was retourned agayne to Bocchus: he shewed to him ye wyl of Iugurth / sayeng that he coueted to do althyng whiche shuld be cōmaūded to hym of Bocchus: but he had but smal cōfydēce in Marius. For asmoche as the peace whiche often before had ben conuē
                        ted & apoynted of the romayne captayns had anone after ben frustrate: & broken of thē agayne. But if ye wyll (sayd Asper to Bocchus) that peace shalbe confermed of the romayns wt Iugurth & you also: Iugurth desyreth & requireth you to labour so: that Sylla / Iugurth / & ye: may come togyder to cō
                        munycation:

as if it were to treat of peace & that ye wyl there betraye and delyuer Sylla to hym. For if ye may ones bring such a man into power & handes of Iugurth: anone after it shall fortune without dowte that peace shalbe made and graū

For without dout ye romayns wyl nat suffre so noble a man to be left in handes & danger of their ennemies. And namely: whan they shal vnderstande hym takē / nat by his owne folly nor cowardyse: but in besynesse belongynge to the commen wayle.
                     ¶Bocchus heryng these wordes: reuolued & cast lōg in min / de what he might answere to thē: but at last he graūted therto But whether he douted so long before he graūted for subtylte or very trouth / it is harde to discerne. But this is playnly knowen yt for the moost part in likewyse as the wylles & myndes of kyngꝭ be vehemēt / immoderat / & hasty: right so be they mouyng / vnstedfast / & variable: and often aduers & cōtrary to their owne selfe: and with thēselfe repugnāt. But to our mater: Bocchus assigned to Asper a place & tyme: where Sylla and they shuld cōmen togyder of the peace. And in the meane whyle somtyme he cōmuned secretly with Sylla: somtyme wt Asper embassadour of Iugurth / treatyng them both mekely and courtesly: and ꝓmisyng one self thyng vnto them both. Wherfore they both wer glad: and also eche of them both had good hope in the promysses of Bocchus.
                     ¶But the nygh before that day: whiche was assigned to intreatmēt of the peace: Bocchus called vnto hym diuerse of his frendes / as if he wold haue taken coūsel of them: and than immediatly he chaūged that mynde / cōmaundyng them agayne to auoyde from hym. And so (none of his coūsel about hym) he stode al alone reuoluyng & tourning ī mynde many thyngꝭ by hymselfe / chaūgyng oftentymes in contenaūce / and colour variable & diuerse: aperyng forthward by tokens of feare cō

hym accompanyed with a fewe of his frendes / and also with Sylla: fayninge that he went so forth to mete with Iugurth and to receyue hym / bycause of honour. And thus they proceded forwarde: tyl at last they came to an opyn heyth / where they myght easely se the commyng of Iugurth: whiche place was apoynted before to their treason. For in dyuerse valeys of the same heyth: were armed men lyenge in wayt redy and apoynted before by Bocchus: for to assayle Iugurth and his company / whan signes shuld be gyuen to them: to yssue forth of their lurkyng places. Anone Iugurth with many of his men about hym came to ye same place al vnarmed: as apoyntement was made before. For it was ordayned that Bocchus / Iugurth / and Sylla: shulde come togyder to cōmunicacion: eche one with a smal company / and al vnarmed.
                     ¶Anon as Iugurth was come thyder: kyng Bocchus gaue a token to his men / which lay in wayt for Iugurth. Anone as they harde the token: sodaynly they bracke forth and inuaded Iugurth and his cōpany: compasynge them about on euery syde. Without great labour: al the company of Iugurth were murdred: and he hymselfe taken and bounde hande and fote / and so delyuerd vnto Sylla: whiche without tary led hym forth and delyuerd hym vnto Marius: whose hert was replenysshed and inuironed / with ioye inestimable.

Marius with great wysedome set an order among the people / and garnysshed and fortified the townes: and than with the remanent of his army toke his iournay agayne to Rome: leadyng Iugurth and his two sonnes bounde with hym: with innumerable other prisoners / great treasour / olyphantes / and armoure: whiche he had won in the war of Iugurth. But after that tidynges were brought to Rome: howe the war was ended in Numidy: and howe Iugurth was

led thyderwarde bounde and prisoner. Anone the Senate and commens assembled to counsel: and Marius was create consul agayne for the next yere: in his absence. And by decre and ordynaunce: the prouince of Fraunce was commytted vnto hym to be recouered.
                     ¶For the same tyme whyle Marius warred in Numidy: and toke Iugurth prisoner. That coūtrey of France (whose people that tyme were named Cymbrians) rebelled agaynst the empyre of Rome. Agaynst whome the romayns sende forth to represse their rebellion: a great army with two capitayns: the one named Quintus Scipio / the other Marcus Manlyus: whiche at last with frowarde fortune had a great and greuous batayle with the same frenchmen Cymbrians. In which both these romayne capitayns were ouercome· and twyse lost the felde. Of the romayns men of war: were slayne .lxxx. thousande: of tylmen / and pages .xl. thousande. Thus was this batayle foughten with so yl fortune vnto the romayns: that the cite of Rome / and al the countrey of Italy trembled for feare therof. In somoche that both the romains which lyued at that tyme: and al their progeny whiche succeded them: counted al other nacions redy to their obesance: and to wyn honour by them: but they thought neuer to contende in batayle with this nacion of frenchmen: to wynne glorie or honour by them: but rather to defende themselfe and their libertie: whiche thynge if they myght do / they counted themselfe fortunate. Wherfore (as I haue before recounted) the Senate: and commens of Rome / decreed this prouince of France to Marius for to reuenge the deth of their men: and to recouer the countrey.
