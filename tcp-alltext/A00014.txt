            Matter (by Armes) to heighten Englands State,
            Theſe being more great then Romes Decemuirate
            Happieſt of Kings is ours: who in his Throne
            SItſ, Kiſing Peace, enioying her alone:
            More then all Chriſtian Kings doe) yet when Drums
            Beate at his Neighbours Courtgates, forthwith comes
            This heape of Worthies; an by them tis knowne,
            How to guard Strangers, how to guide our owne.
            The Souldier fights abroad, but theſe at home
            Teach him to fight well: From theſe ten Heads come
            Thoſe ſtreames of Councell, by which War does ſtand
            As
