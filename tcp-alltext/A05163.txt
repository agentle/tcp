               An aduertiſement and defence for Trueth againſt her Backbiters, and ſpecially againſt the whiſpering Fauourers, and Colourers of Campions, and the reſt of his confederats treaſons.
            
               
                  ALthough, at the late arraignments at Weſtminſter of Edmonde Campion, and other his complices cō
               demned there of ſundry high treaſons, it was manifeſtly declared and fully proued, how they all, vnder prctence of the names of Ieſuites, Seminarie Prieſts, & other perſons of like condition, had ſecretly come into this Realme by the ſending of ſundrie perſons authorized by the Pope, to moue the people by their ſecret perſwaſions to change their profeſſions in the matter of Religion, of long time quietly eſtabliſhed in this Realme, and to be reconciled to the obedience of the Pope, and withdrawen from their naturall allegeance due to the Queenes Maieſtie, and by theſe meanes to be readie in their heartes and mindes and otherwiſe prouided, to ioyne their forces aſwell with ſuch as their Heads & ſuperiours which ſent them, intended ſpeedily to procure to be ſent into this Realme, as with other rebellious Subiectes by them to be thereto alſo excited, of purpoſe to depriue her Maieſtie of her life, crowne and dignitie, in like

maner as lately hath bene notoriouſly attempted and put in execution by D. Sanders an errant and deteſtable Traitour, and whileſt hee liued one of the ſaide Campions companions, and by other Engliſh and Iriſh Ieſuites and Traitours in Ireland, where they had firſt by their like ſecret meanes and perſwaſions, entiſed a great multitude of people of that Land, firſt to change their profeſſion of Religion and to acknowledge the Popes authoritie, and to renounce the iuſt authoritie of her Maieſtie, and ſo departing from their allegeance vpon the arriuall of forreine forces they did enter into a manifeſt Rebellion, againſt the which Almightie God the iuſt auenger of Rebels, by his goodneſſe hath giuen her Maieſtie (through her good miniſters) power to the vanquiſhing not onely of thoſe forreine forces, but alſo of a great number of the Rebels there: Yet it is maliciouſly, falſly, and traiterouſly by ſome of the ſecret fauourers of the ſaid Campion, and other the ſaid condemned Traitours, whiſpered in corners, that the offences of theſe traitours, were but for their ſecret attemptings as Ieſuites by exhorting & teaching, with Shriuing, Maſſing, & ſuch like actes, to moue people to change their Religion, and to yelde their obedience to the Pope as Chriſtes vicar (although the ſame are of themſelues offences very vainous, and ſeedes of ſedicion not allowable by the Lawes of the Realme) whereas in

very trueth neuertheleſſe it did manifeſtly appeare vpon their Juditements and at their arraignements by ſundrie confeſſions of ſome of their owne companions, and by many good proofes and witneſſes produced and ſworne before their faces, that their factes, whereof they were arraigned and condemned, were ſuch as were in trueth high Treaſons committed againſt her Maieſties moſt Royall perſon, and againſt the ancient Lawes and Statutes of this Realme, which many hundred yeeres paſt were in force againſt like Traytours, and not for factes of doctrine or Religion, nor yet for offences againſt any late or newe Statutes, the ſame being many conſpiracies at ſundry times beyond the Seas, at Rome in Italie, and other places, and laſtly at Rheims in Fraunce, where there are nouriſhed by the Popes authoritie in Seminaries, multitudes of Engliſh Ieſuites, Seminarie Prieſtes, and Fugitiues, whereof their Heads & Gouernours vſe continually in their Sermons and in their Bookes publiquely printed, as Traitours to declare their traiterous mindes, as farrefoorth as they can, to the depriuation of the Queenes Maieſtie of her life and crowne, to which endes the ſaide Campion & his ſaid Companions, by procurement of their sſaid Heads, came ſecretly into this Realme to moue the Subiects to renounce their naturall obedience, and according to a Bull of the

laſt Pope Pius publiſhed, to perſwade all ſortes with whom they durſt ſecretly deale, that her Maieſtie, by the ſayd Popes excommunication, was not the lawfull Queene of the Realme, nor that the Subiects were bounde to obey any of her lawes or Miniſters, but that they were all free and diſcharged of their obedience and allegeance, and that they might lawfully, yea that when time might ſerue, they ought to take armes againſt her Maieſtie, as in the late rebellion in ye North was manifeſtly by like meanes put in execution, and as nowe alſo lately was notoriouſly attempted in Ireland, by ſtirring vp the people in the Popes name, and vnder his ſtanderd to an open general rebellion, & to haue brought theſe thinges to paſſe in this Realme, was the comming into this Realme of the ſaid Campion & his Complices moſt manifeſtly tried and proued, as if by Gods goodneſſe by their apprehenſions after their ſecret wanderings and diſguiſings of them ſelues in a great part of the Shires of the Realme theſe Traitours had not bene now ſtayed, and by iuſt puniſhments ordered to be executed, there would haue appeared ſuch miſchiefe as is lamentable to be thought of, to ye danger of her Maieſties perſon, & to the hazard and ruine of the whole Realme, by inuaſion of the ſame with forreine enemies, & by raiſing of inward warre within the Realme, the ende and euent whereof, as of all warre ciuil, can not be

without great griefe mentioned or imagined.
            And to ye further reproofe and condemnation of the ſaide Campion and other the Traitours nowe condemned, they being all ſeuerally and earneſtly required at ye place of their arraignement to declare what they thought of the ſaide Popes Bull (by which her Maieſtie was in the Popes intention depriued of the Crowne) and of Doctor Sanders, and of Briſtowes traiterous writings in maintenance of the ſaide Bull, and allowance of the Rebellion in the North, and of Saunders trayterous actions in Irelande, and being likewiſe demaunded what they did thinke if the preſent Pope ſhould publiſh the like Bull, none of them all, but one onely named Ruſhton, coulde be perſwaded by any their anſweres to ſhewe in any part their miſlykings eyther of the former Bull, or of D. Sanders, or Briſtowes traiterous writings or actions, or of the Pope that nowe is, if he ſhoulde nowe publiſh the like Bull againſt her Maieſtie, ſo as they did apparantly ſhew their traiterous hearts ſtil fixed to perſiſt in their deuiliſh mindes againſt their naturall allegeance: Whereof God giue all good Subiects being true Engliſhmen borne, grace to beware, and in no ſort to giue eare or ſuccour to ſuch pernicious Traitours, howſoeuer they ſhall be couered with hypocriſie, and falſe and fained holines of Rome.
            God ſaue the Queene, long to reigne to his honour.
