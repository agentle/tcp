                  WHan Phebus in the crabbe had nere his cours ronne
               And toward the Leon his Iourney gan take
               To loke on Pyctagoras ſpere I had bgonne

               Soo ponderouſly I coude make none obſtacle
               In myne hede was fall ſuche an heuyneſſe

               To rowne with a pylow me ſemyd beſt tryacle
               Soo leyde I me downe my dyſſeaſe to releue
               Anone cam in Morpleus & toke me by the ſleue
            
            
               And as I ſoo laye halfe in a traunſe
               Twene ſlepyng and wakyng he bad me aryſe
               For he ſayd I muſt yeue attendaunce

               But as we thyderwarde went by the waye
               I hym beſought his name me to tell

               And as ſoone as he theſe wordes had ſayd
               Cerberus the porter of hell with his cheyne
               Brought theder Colus in ragges euyll arayd

                  To theym do by Colus wheron they cōpleyned
               And to begynne Dyana was conſtreyned
            
            
               whiche thus began as ye ſhall here

               This traytour Colus hath many of my places
               Deſtroyed with his blaſtes & dayly me manaces
               where ony wood is he ſhall make it pleyne
               If he to his lyberte maye reſorte ageyne
            
            
               The greteſt trees that ony man may fynde
               In foreſt to ſhade the deere for her comfort
               He breketh hē aſondre or rendeth hē rote & rynde
               Oute of the erthe this is his dyſport
               Soo that the deere ſhall haue noo reſort
               within ſhort tyme to noo maner ſhade
               where thorugh the game is lykly to fade
            
            
               whiche to myn name a reproche ſynguler
               
                  Sholde be for euer whyle the worlde laſt

               And whan thus Dyana had made her cōpleynt
               To Mynos the Iuge in Plutoos preſence
               Came forth Neptunꝰ with vyſage pale & feyne
               Deſyryng of fauour to haue audyence
               Sayeng thus Pluto to thy magnyfycence

               Thou knoweſt well that I haue the charge

               And lete hym not eſcape out of your daungere
               
                  Tyll he haue made full ſeethe and recompence
               For hurt of my name thrugh this grete offence
            
            
               Fyrſte to begynne. this Colus hath ofte
               Made me to retourne my courſe agayn nature
               with his grete blaſtys whan he hath be a lofte
               And charged me to labour ferre out of meſure
               That it was grete meruayle how I myght endure
               The com of my ſwete wyll it teſtyfye
               That on the ſee bankes lythe beten full hye
            
            
               Secondly where as my nature is
               Both to ebbe & flowe and ſo my courſe to kepe
               Ofte of myne entente hath he made me mys

               At a full water I myght not theder crepe
               Before my ſeaſon came to retourne ageyne
               And than went I faſter than I wolde certeyne
            
            
               Thus he hath me dryuen ayen myn entent
               And contrary to my courſe naturall
               where I ſhold haue be he made me be abſent
               To my grete dyſhonoure & in eſpecyall
               Do thyng he vſed that worſt was of all
               For where as I my ſauegarde graunted

               And ſoo by his labour put I am to ſhame
            
            
               Conſyder this mater and ponder my cauſe

               Then ſayd Mynos full Indyfferently
               To Dyana & Neptunus. is there ony more

               Nay in dede they ſayd we kepe none in ſtore

               Is trewe for one there is that wyll not apply

                  That he ſo rebelleth I can not thynke of ryght
               But yf ye haue hȳ graūted your alders ſafecō
                  dyghe
            
            
               And yf ye ſo haue than do ye not as goddys
               For a goddys wrytyng may not reuerſyd be
               If it ſholde I wolde not yeue two peſecoddys

               And whan all the goddys had Attropos hered
               As they had be wood they brayde vp attones
               And ſayd they wold not reſt tyll he were cōquered
               Taken & deſtroyed body blood & bones
               And yt they ſwere grete othes for the nones
               Her lawe to dyſpyce that was ſo malapert
               They ſayd he ſhold be taught for to be ſo pert
            
            
               well ſayd Apollo yf he on erthe bee

               In feyth quod Neptunus & yf he kepe the ſee
               He may be full ſure. he ſhall ſoone be drownde
               A ſyr ſayd Mars this haue we well fownde
               That ony dyſobeyed oure godly precept

               But neuertheleſſe where I may hym fynde
               
                  with thūdre & lyghtnyng about I ſhal hȳ chaſe
               And I quod Saturnus before and behynde

               well ſayd Mercuryus yf I may ſee his faſe
               For euer of his ſpeche I ſhall hym depryue
               Soo that hym were better be dede than a lyue
            
            
               ye quod Othea yet maye he well be
               In the ayre where he wyll & axe you no leue
               wherfore my counſeyll is that all we
               May entreate Neptunꝰ his rancour to foryeue
               And then I doute not Colus wyll hȳ myſcheue
               Soo may ye be ſure he ſhall you not eſcape
               And elles of all your angre wyll he make but aiape
            
            
               But for to tell you how Colus was brought
               In daunger of Pluto yet had I forgete
               wherfore on this mater forther wyll I nought
               Procede tyll I therof haue knowleche you lete
               Hit fell on a daye the weder was wete
               And Colus thought he wolde on his deſporte
               Goo to reioyſe his ſpyrytes and comforte
            
            
               He thought he wold ſee what was in ye groūde
               And in a krauers forthe he gan hym dreſſe
               A drowthe had the erthe late before foūde
               That cauſed it to chyne & krauy more & leſſe
               Sodeynly by weet conſtrayned by dureſſe
               
                  was the groūde to cloſe his ſuperfycyall face
               Soo ſtrayte that to ſcape Colus had noo ſpace
            
            
               This ſeyng Colus he ſtyll within abode
               Sekyng where he myght haue gone oute fer ornere
               Anone he was alpyed & one to Plutorode
               And tolde hȳ how Colꝰ was in his daūgere
               Then ſayd he to Cerberus fet me yt pryſonere
               Tyll I haue hym ſeen let hym not go at large
               As thou wylt anſwer of hym I yeue the charge
            
            
               Thus was this Colus take pryſoner
               Than happed hit ſoo that the ſame day
               Pluto had prefixed for a grete mater
               Mynos to ſyt in his roob of Ray
               wherfore Cerberus toke the next way
               And led hym to the place where the court ſhalbe
               wheder as I tolde you Morpleus brought me
            
            
               Soo thyder came Dyana caryed in a carre
               To make her compleynt as I tolde you all
               And ſo dyd Neptunꝰ yt doth both make & marre
               walewyng with his wawes & tōblyng as a ball
               Her maters they meuyd fall what may befall
               There was the fyrſt ſyght yt euer I theym ſawe
               And yf I neuer do efte I recke not a ſtrawe
            
            
               But now to my mater to retourne agayne
               
                  And to begynne. newe where I left

               And ſayd I praye you let me ſpeke a worde yete

               yes and that quod Colus ſhall ye here tell

               For all the baytys that ye for hym haue layde
               without myne helpe be not worthe a peere
               For though ye all the coūtrarye had ſayde
               Yet wold he brede ryght nygh your althrys eere
               No maner of thyng can hym hurt nor deere

               wherfore you Cerberus now I the dyſcharge

               Forth then went Cerberus with his fyry cheyne

               Free to both partyes large brood and wyde
               Vertu wold not tary but hyghed hȳ 
                  thyd blyue
               Leſte he were by vyce deceyued at that tyde
               Longe out of the felde lothe he was to abyde
               In auenture that he out of hit were not kept
               For than wolde he haue thought he had to long ſlept
            
            
               In this mene tyme whyle Vertu thus prouyded
               For hym & his people the felde for to wynne
               He charged euery man by grace to be guyded
               And all that euer myght the felde to entre ynne
               In all that ſeaſon wente orygynall ſynne
               To lete Vyce know how baptym with his ooſt
               Had entred Macrocoſme & ſerched euery cooſt
            
            
               A ſayd vyce than I ſee well hit is tyme

               Forth than rode Vyce with all his hole ſtrength
               On his ſtede ſerpentyne as I tolde you before
               The ooſt yt hym folowed was of a gret length
               Amōg whō were penoūs & gnytors many a ſcore
               But as he wēt thedward I ſhall tell you more
               Of his pety captayns he made many a knynht

               In lyke wyſe Vertue doubled on his ſyde
               Of his pety capteyns other fourtene

               That felde to kepe as longe as they myght
               And in his quarell agayne Vyce to fyght
            
            
               The lord of Macrocoſme and rewler of yt fee
               was called frewyll chaunger of the chaunſe
               To whome Vertue ſent embaſſatours three

               He ſtood in gret doute he coude not lightly ſpede
            
            
               In lyke wyſe Vyce embaſſatours thre

               Than it ſhold be know what part he wyll take
            
            
               whan Vertu & Vyce be her ambaſſatours
               Knew of this anſwere they ſtood in gret doute
               Neutheles they ſayd they wold ēdure tho ſhours
               And make an ende ſhortly of yt they wēt aboute
               Soo forth came Vyce with all his grete route
               Er he came at the felde he ſent yet pryuely
               Senſualyte before in maner of a ſpy
            
            
               whiche ſewe the felde with his vnkynde ſeede
               That cauſed Vertue after mykyll woo to feele
               For therof grewe nought but all oonly weede
               whiche made the grounde as ſleper as an yele
               He went ayene to Vyce & tolde hym euery dele
               
                  How he had done and bad hym come away
               For he had ſo purueyde yt Vyce ſhold haue ye day
            
            
               Soo as hit happed at the felde they mete
               Frewyll Vertue and Vyce as trypartyte
               Saaf Vertue a lytyll before the felde had gete
               And ellis his auaūtage forſoth had be full lyght
               Not for then encombred ſo was neuer wyght
               As Vertu & his men were with the ranke wede
               That in the felde grew of ſenſualytees ſede
            
            
               But as ſoone as Vyce of Vertue had a ſyght
               He gan ſwage gonnes as he had be wode
               That heryng Vertue cōmaunded euery wyght
               To pauyſe hym vnder the ſygne of the rode
               And bad hē not drede. but kepe ſtyll where they ſtode
               It was but a ſhour ſhold ſoone cōfoūde
               wherfore he cōmaūded theym ſtande & kepe her groūde
            
            
               And whan Vyce cam nerer to the felde
               He called ſore for bowes & bad hem ſhote faſt
               But Vertu & his meyny bare of with the ſhelde
               Of the bleſſyd Trynyte ay tyll ſhot was paſt
               And whā ſhot was done Vyce cam forth at laſt
               Purpoſyng the felde with aſſaute to wyn
               But v

                     er
                   theryn
            
            
               All that tyme Frewyll ſtood & hym bethought
               
                  To whiche he myght leue & what part he wold take
               At laſt ſenſualyte had hȳ ſo fer brought
               That he ſayd playnly he dtu wold forſake
               And in Vyce his quarell all his power make
               Iwys quoth reaſon that is not for the beſteNota
               
               Noforſe ſayd frewyll I wyll do as my lyſte
            
            
               Vertue was full heuy when he ſee frewyll
               Take part with Vyce but yet neuertheleſſe
               He dyde that he myght the felde to kepe ſtyll
               Tyll Vyce with frewyll ſo ſore gan hȳ oppreſſe
               That he was conſtrayned clerely by dureſſe
               A lytyll tyne abacke to make abew retret
               All thyng conſydered hit was the beſt feet
            
            
               Fyrſt to remembre how Vyces parte was
               Ten ayene one ſtrenger by lyklyneſſe
               And than how frewyll was with hym alas
               whoo coude deme Vertue but in heuyneſſe
               Moreouer to thynke how that ſlyper graſſe
               That of ſenſualyte his vnkynde ſeede grew
               Vnder foote in ſtandyng encombred Vertew
            
            
               yet notwithſtondyng Vertue his men all
               Nobelly theym bare and faught myghtyly
               How be it y• ſleper graſſe made many of hē fall
               And from thenſe in maner departe ſodeynly
               That ſeyng Vyce his ooſt began to ſhout & cry
               
                  And ſayd on in Pluto name on & all is oure
               For this daye ſhall Vyce be made a cōqueroure
            
            
               Thus Vertu was by myght of Vyce & Frewyll
               Dreuen out of the felde it was the more pyte
               How be hit yet Baptyme kept his groūde ſtyll
               And with hym abode feythe hope & vnyte
               And konnyng alſo with comons a gret meyne
               Confeſſyon contrycyon were redy at her honde

               But all the tyme whyle Vertue was away
               A myghty conflycte kept they wt Vyce his route
               And yet neuertheleſſe for all yt grete affray
               Hope ſtood vp ryght & feythe wolde neuerloute
               And euermore ſayd Baptym ſyres put no doute

               That euer was made of goddys creacyon
               To reward theym euenly were not equyualent
               For her noble labour in his afflyccyon
               wherfore take vpon you your Iuriſdyccyon

               with theſe & ſuche wordes as I haue you tolde
               By good perſeueraunce vttred in this wyſe
               Vertue hym remembred & gan to wexe bolde
               And ſayd yeue trew knyghtis to reſcu I auyſe
               Let vs no lenger tary from this entrepryſe
               Agayn to the felde ſoo Vertue retourned
               That cauſed hē be mery yt long afore had morned
            
            
               Auaunt baner qd he in the name of Iheſu
               And with yt his people ſet vp a gret ſhoute
               And cryed with a loude voyce a Vertu a Vertu
               Then began Vyce his hooſt for to loke aboute
               But I trow ꝑſeueraūce was not long withoute
               
                  He bathed his ſwerd in his foos blood
               The boldeſt of hem all not ones hȳ withſtood
            
            
               Conſtaūce hym folowed & brought hȳ his ſpere
               But when ꝑſeueraūce ſaw Vyce on his ſtede
               Noman coude hym let tyll he came there
               For to byd hym ryde I trow it was no nede
               All Vertu his ooſt prayed for his good ſpede
               Agayn Vyce he rode with his gret ſhaft
               And hym ouerthrew for all his ſotyll craft
            
            
               That ſeyng Frewyll came to conſcyence
               And gan hym to repente yt he with hym had be
               Prayeng hym of coūſell for his grete offence
               That he agayn Vertu had made his arme
               what was beſt to doo to humylyte
               
                  Qd conſcyence muſt yu go ſo he hym thyder ſent
               Dyſguyſed yt he were not knowen as he went
            
            
               And whan he thyder came humylyte hym toke
               A token & bad hym go to confeſſyon
               And ſhew hym his mater with a pyteous loke
               whiche done he hym ſent to contrycyon
               And fro thenſforthe to ſatyſfaccyon
               Thus fro pooſt to pyler was he made to daūce
               And at the laſt he went forthe to penaūce
            
            
               But now for to tell you whē vyce was outhrow
               
                  A grete part of his ooſt about hym gan reſorte
               But he was ſo febyll yt he coude noman know
               And whan they ſee yt they knew no comforte
               But caryed hym a way be a preuy porte
               And as they hym caryed dyſpeyre with hȳ met
               with Vyce his rewarde he cam theym for to fet
            
            
               Then came there downe goodly ladyes tweyn

               The name of this lady was called Preſtyence

                  Came downe to Vertue & toke hym to y• p̄ſent
               Sayeng thus that Alpha & Oo hath hym ſent
            
            
               And as ferre as I a ryght coude vnderſtonde
               That ladyes name was Predeſtynacyon
               Vertue & his hooſt ſhe bleſſyd with her honde
               And in heuen graunted hem habytacyon
               where to eche of hem reſerued was a crown
               She ſayd in token that they enherytours
               Of the glory were & gracyous conquerours
            
            
               whiche done the ladyes ayene togyder met
               And towarde heuen vp they gan to ſty
               Embraced in armes as they had be knet
               Togyder with a gyrdell but ſoo ſodeynly
               As they were vanyſſhed ſaw I neuer thȳg wt ey
               And anone Vertue with all his company
               Knelyd downe & thanked god of that vyctory
            
            
               Yet had I foryete when Vyce was ouerthrowe
               To haue tolde you how many of Vyce his ooſt
               Gan to ſeke peaſe & darked downe full lowe
               And beſought mercy what ſo euer hit coſt
               To be her mene to Vertu ellis they were but loſt
               And ſome in lyke wyſe to feyth & hope ſought
               what to do for peaſe they ſayd they ne rought
            
            
               Some alſo to baptyme ſewed to be her mene
               
                  Som to one ſom to other as they hē gete myȝt
               But all to confeſſyon went to make hem clene
               And as they cam to cōſcyēce he theȳ bad go lyȝt
               Er than olde Attropos of hem had a ſyght
               For yf he ſo theym toke loſt they were for euer
               He ſayd Vyce to forſake is better late thā neuer
            
            
               Some eke for ſocour drew to cyrcūcyſyon
               But by hym coude they gete but ſmall fauour
               For he in yt company was had but in deryſyon
               Neuertheleſſe to feyth he bad hem go labour
               Prayeng theȳ for olde acqueyntāce theȳ ſocour
               well qd feth for his ſake I ſhall do yt I may do
               But fyrſt for the beſt way baptyme go ye to

               And let noman know of your heuyneſſe
               So they were by baptȳ brought out of dyſtreſſe
               Tourned all to Vertue & when this was done
               Vertue cōmaūded Frewyll before hym come
            
            
               To whom thus he ſayd I haue grete meruayll

               And I ſhall you tell the verrey ſothe of all
               How it was & who made me that waye drawe
               Forſothe Senſualyte his ꝓpre name they call
               A ſayd reaſon then I knowe well yt felawe
               wylde he is & wanton of me ſtant hȳ none awe
               Is he ſo qd Vertue well he ſhall be taught
               As a player ſholde to drawe a nother draught
            
            
               And with yt came ſadneſſe with his ſobre chere
               Bryngyng ſenſualyte beyng full of thought
               And ſayd that he had take hym pryſonere
               A welcome ſayd Vertue now haue I yt I ſought
               Bleſſyd be yt good lord as yu wolde is it nought

               Er yu go at large yu ſhalt be made more tame worde
            
            
               But ſtande a part a whyle tyll I haue ſpoke a
               with Frewyll a lytyll & then ſhalt yu know
               what ſhalbe thy fynaūce & then he ſayd in borde
               Vnto Frewyll the ben of your bowe
               Begynneth to ſlake but ſuche as ye haue ſowe
               Muſt ye nedes repe there is none other way
               Not withſtondyng yt let ſe what ye can ſay
            
            
               what is your habylyte me to recompenſe
               
                  For the grete harme that ye to me haue do
               Forſothe ſayd Frewyll in open audyence
               But oonly Macrocoſme more haue I not lo

               In dede ſayd Vertue to that wyll I acorde
            
            
               Then made Vertue Reaſon his lyeftenaūt
               And yaue hȳ a gret charge Macrocoſme to kepe
               That done Senſualyte yelde hym recreaūt
               And began for to angre bytterly to wepe
               For he demed ſurely his ſorow ſhold not ſlepe
               Then made Vertue Frewyll bayll vnd Reaſon

               And then ſayd Vertue to Senſualyte
               Thou ſhalt be rewarded for thy beſyneſſe
               Vnder this fourme all fragylyte

               And euen with that came in dame Nature
               Sayeng thus to Vertue ſyr ye do me wrong

               As it were a caſt awaye or a ſhoo clowte
            
            
               And parde ye know well a rewle haue I muſt

                  Qd Vertu but ſenſualyte ſhall not ꝑforme your luſt

               A lytyll tyne his ey caſtyng hym beſyde
               He ſee in a corner ſtandyng Morpleus
               That hym before warned of the verryly tyde
               A ſyres ſayd Vertue yet we muſt abyde
               Here is a frende of oure may not be foryete
               After his deſerte we ſhall hym entreate
            
            
               Morpleus ſayd Vertue I thanke you hertely
               For your trewe herte & your grete laboure
               That ye lyſt to come to me ſoo redely
               when ye vnderſtood the comyng of ye ſhoure
               I thanke god & you of ſauyng of myn honour
               whefore this preuylege now to you I graūt
               That within Macrocoſme ye ſhall haue youre haūt
            
            
               And of fyue poſternes the keyes ſhall ye kepe
               
                  Lettyng in & out at hem whome ye lyſt
               As long as in Macrocoſme your fad wyll crepe
               Blere whos ey ye wyll hardly with your myſt
               And kepe your werkes cloſe there as in a chyſt

               And whā he had thꝰ ſayd ye keyes he hȳ toke
               And toward his caſtell with his peopell went
               Byddyng reaſon take good hede & about loke
               That ſenſualyte by Nature were not ſhent
               Kepe hym ſhort he ſayd tyll his luſt be ſpent
               For better were a chylde to be vnbore
               Than let hym haue the wyll & for euer be lore
            
            
               And whā olde Attropos had ſeen & herde al this
               How Vertue had opteyned aſtonyed as he ſtood
               He ſayd to hymſelfe ſomwhat there is amys
               I trow well my patent be not all good
               And ran to the paleys as he had be wood
               Sayeng to the goddys I ſee ye do but iape
               After a worthy whew haue ye made me gape
            
            
               How a deuyll way ſholde I Vertue ouerthrow
               when he dredeth not all your hole route
               How cā ye make good your patēt wold I know
               Hit is to Impoſſyble to bryng that aboute
               For ſtryke hym may I not yt is out of doute
               
                  A good Attropos ſayd god Apollo
               An anſwere conuenyent ſhalt thou haue herto
            
            
               The wordes of thy patent dare I well ſay
               Stretche to no ferther but were dame Nature
               Hath Iuryſdiccyon there to haue thy wayNota
               
               And largeſſe to ſtryke as longeth to thy cure
               And as for Vertue he is no creature
               Vnder the predycament conteyned of quantyte
               wherfore his deſtruccyon longeth not to the
            
            
               A ha ſayd Attropos then I ſee well
               That all ye goddys be but counterfete
               For oo God there is that can euerydell
               Tourne as hym lyſt bothe drye & whete
               In to whoos ſeruyce I ſhall aſſay to gete

               youre names ſhall be put to oblyuyone
            
            
               Thus went Attropos fro the paleys wrooth
               But in the mene tyme whyle yt he there was
               Glydyng by the paleys reſydyuacyon gooth
               Towarde Macrocoſme with a peynted faſe
               Clad lyke a pylgryme walkyng a grete paſe
               In the forme as he had ben a man of ynde
               He wende haue made reſon & ſadneſſe both blȳde
            
            
               With ſenſualyte was he ſoone aqueynted
               
                  To whome he declared his mater pryuely
               yet he was eſpyed for all his face peynted
               Then reſon hy cōmaūded pyke hȳ thēs lightly
               For his eaſe qd ſadneſſe ſo coūſeyll hym wyll I
               Soo was ſenſualyte ay kepte vnder foote

               Then went he to Nature & aſked her auyſe
               His entent to opteyne what was beſt to doo
               She ſayd euer ſyth Vertu of Vyce wan ye pryſe

               For I may noo more but oonly kepe my cours
               And yet is ſenſualyte ſtrenger kept & wours
            
            
               Thꝰ herȳg reſydiuacōn fro thēs he went ageyn
               Full of thought & ſorow yt he myght not ſpede
               Than reſon & ſadneſſe toke wedehokes tweyn

               That ſenſualyte before therin ſew
               And fro thens forth kept it clene for Vertew
            
            
               Than began new graſſe in the felde to ſpryng
               All vnlyke yt other of colour fayr & bryght

                  Tyll I was enformed & taught it to know
               But where Vertue occupyeth muſte nedes well grow
            
            
               yet in the mene tyme while the felde thus grew
               And reſon with ſadneſſe therof had gouernaūce
               Many a preuy meſſenger thyder ſent Vertew
               To know yf it were guyded to his pleſaūce

               And bad hȳ to his power helpe where he ſe nede

               when Adam and Eue had broke the precept

               But goddys were they called by olde Poetes

               Experyence preueth this at all yeres

               How they by that hyghe name of god cam
               In this ſayd tyme the people was ſo rude
               That what maner creature man or woman
               Loude ony newelte contryue and conclude
               For the comon wele all the multytude
               Of the comon people a god ſholde hym call
               Or a goddeſſe after hit was fall
            
            
               Of the ſame thyng that was ſo newe founde
               As Ceres for ſhe the crafte of tythe fonde
               wherby more plentououſly corne dyd habounde
               The people her called thrugh out euery londe
               Goddeſſe of corne wenyng in her honde
               
                  Had layn all power of cornes habundaūce
               Thus were ye Paynems deceyued by ignoraūce
            
            
               In lyke maner Iſys was called the goddeſſe
               Of frute for ſhe tyrſt made it multyply
               By the name of gryffyng & ſoo by proceſſe
               The name of Pan gan to deyfy
               For he fyrſt founde the mene ſhepe to guy
               Some toke it alſo by her condycyon
               As Pluto Fortune and ſuche other doon
            
            
               Thus all that Poetes put vnder couerture
               Of fable the rurall people hit toke
               Properly as acte refuſyng the fygure
               whiche errour ſome of hem neuer forſoke
               Ofte a falſe myrour deceyueth a mannes loke
               As thou mayſt dayly pryue at thyne ey
               Thus were the paynyms deceyued generally
            
            
               That ſeyng the dedely enemy of mankynde
               By his power permyſſyue entred the ymagys
               within the Temples to make the peple blynde
               In her ydolatry ſtandyng on hyghe ſtagys
               In ſomoche whoo vſed daūgerous paſſagys
               Ony maner way by water or be londe
               when hyd his ſacryfyce his anſwere redy fonde
            
            
               Thus duryng the tyme of deuyacyon
               
                  From Adam to Moyſes was ydolatry
               Thorugh the worlde vſed in comon opynyon
               Theſe were the goddys that thou there ſy
               And as for the a wayters that ſtood hem by
               They polytyke Phyloſophers & Poetes were
               whiche feyned the fables yt I ſpeke of here
            
            
               Then ſeaſed the tyme of deuyacyon
               when Moyſes receyued that tables of ſtone
               Entryng the tyme of reuocacyon
               On the mounte of Synay ſtondyng allone
               God yaue hym myght ayene all his fone
               And then began the olde teſtament
               whiche to the people by Moyſes was ſent
            
            
               And that tyme dured the Incarnacyon
               Ot Cryſte and then began it to ſeſe
               For then came the tyme of reconcylyacyon
               Of man to god I tell the doutleſe
               when the ſone of man put hym in preſe
               wylfully to ſuffre dethe for mankynde
               In holy ſcrypture this mayſt thou fynde
            
            
               This Reconcylyacyon was the tyme of grace
               when foūded was the chirche vpon y• fayre ſtone
               And to holy Peter the keye delyuered was
               Of heuen then hell dyſpoyled was anone
               Thus was mankynde delyuered from his font
               
                  And then began the newe teſtament
               That the cryſten people beleue in preſent
            
            
               whiche .iii. tymes a ſondry dyuyded

               The .iii. on the ryght honde here it is to y• tolde
               Thus haſt thou in vyſyon the verrey fygure
               Of theſe .iii. tymes here ſhewed in purtrayture
            
            
               That is to ſay fyrſt of deuyacyon
               From Adam to Moyſes recordyng ſcripture
               Seconde fro Moyſes to the Incarnacyon
               Of Cryſt kepeth reuocacyons cure

               wyll dure from thens to the worldes ende

               After ſome & ſome named it otherwyſe
               And call hit the tyme of daūgerous paſſage
               And ſome tyme of werre that fully hit dyſpyſe
               But what ſo it be named I wyll the auyſe
               Remembre it well and prynte it in thy mynde

                  How Vyce & Vertue dayly theym occupy

               The ſeconde dyſcrettly agayne my vyſage
               
                  The tyme expreſſeth of Deuyacyon
               whyle paynyme lawe had the domynacyon
            
            
               The thryd wall ſtandyng on my lyfte honde
               The tyme repreſenteth of Reuocacyon
               And the fourthe ſtandyng on my ryght honde
               Determyneth the tyme of Reconſylyacyon
               This is the effecte of thy vyſyon
               wherfore the nedeth nomore theron to muſe
               Hit were but veyne thy wyttes to dyſuſe
            
            
               But duryng the tyme of Reconſylyacyon
               Thy tyme of pylgremage loke well yu ſpendeNota
               
               And then well gracyous Predeſtynacyon
               Bryng the to glory at thy laſt ende
               And euen with that came to my mynde
               My fyrſt concluſyon that I was aboute
               To haue dreuen er ſlepe made me to loute
            
            
               That is to ſay how Senſualyte
               wt Reaſon to acorde myght be brought aboute
               whiche cauſed me to knele downe on my kne
               And beſeke Doctryne determyne that doute
               Do lord god ſayd Doctryne canſt yu not withoute
               Me that concluſyon bryng to an ende
               Ferre is fro the wytte & ferther good mende
            
            
               And euen with that Dethe gan appere
               
                  Shewyng hymſelfe as though that he wolde
               His darte haue occupyed within that herbere
               But there was none for hym yong nor olde
               Saue oonly I Doctryne hym tolde
               And when I herde hyr with hym comon thus
               I me withdrew behynde Morpleus
            
            
               Dredyng full ſore leeſt he with his dart
               Thorugh Doctrynes wordes ony entreſſe
               In me wolde haue had or claymed ony part
               whiche ſholde haue cauſed me grete heuyneſſe
               within whiche tyme & ſhort proceſſe
               Came thyder Reaſon and Senſualyte
               A quoth Doctryne ryght welcome be ye
            
            
               Hit is not long ſythe we of you ſpake
               Ye muſt er ye goo determyne a doute
               And euen with that ſhe the mater brake
               To theym & tolde hit euery where aboute
               I wolde haue be thens yf I had moute
               For fere I loked as blake as a cole
               I wolde haue cropen in a mouſe hole
            
            
               what quoth Doctryne where is he now
               That meued this mater ſtraunge & dyffuſe
               He is a cowarde I make myn auow
               He hyded his hede his mocyon to refuſe
               Blame hym not qd Reaſon alway yt to vſe
               
                  when he ſeeth Dethe ſoo nere at his honde
               Yet is his part hym to withſtonde
            
            
               Or at the leſte way elles fro hym flee
               As longe as he may who dooth otherwyſe
               Is an ydeote quoth Senſualytee
               who dredeth not Dethe wyſe men hym dyſpyſe
               what ſayd Doctryne how long hathe this gyſe
               Be holden & vſed thus a twixe you tweyne
               ye were not wonte to acorde certeyne
            
            
               yes quoth Reaſon in this poynt alway
               To euery man haue we yeuen our counſayll
               Dethe for to flee as long as they may
               Al though we otherwyſe haue done our trauayll
               Eche other to repreſſe yet withoute fayll
               In that poynt oonly dyſcordeth we neuer
               Thus condeſcended therin be we for euer
            
            
               A ha ſayd Doctryne then is the concluſyon
               Clerely determyned of the gret doute
               That here was meuyd & halfe in deryſyon
               She me then called & bade me loke oute
               Come forthe ſhe ſayd & feere not this route
               And euen with that Reaſon & Senſualyte
               And Dethe fro thens were vanyſſhed all thre
            
            
               Then loked I forthe as Doctryne me badde
               
                  when Dethe was gone me thought I was bolde
               To ſhewe myſelfe but yet was I ſadde
               Me thought my doute was not as I wolde
               Clerely and openly declared & tolde
               Hit ſowned to me as a parable
               Derke as a myſte or a fayned fable
            
            
               And Doctryne my conceyte gan eſpy
               wherfore ſayd ſhe ſtandeſt thou ſoo ſtyll
               wherin is thy thought art thou in ſtody
               Of thy queſtyon haſt thou not thy fyll
               To the declared tell me thy wyll
               Herdeſt thou not Reaſon & Senſualyte
               Declared thy doubte here before the
            
            
               For ſothe quoth I. I herde what they ſayde
               But neuertheleſſe my wytte is ſo thynne
               And alſo of Dethe I was ſo afrayde
               That hit is out where hit went ynne
               And ſo that mater can I not wynne
               without your helpe & benyuolence
               Therof to expreſſe the verray ſentence
            
            
               well quoth Doctryne then yeue attendaunce
               Vnto my wordes & thou ſhalt here
               Openly declared the concordaunce
               At wene Senſualyte & Reaſon in fere
               If thou take hede hit clerely dooth apere
               
                  How they were knette in one opynyon
               Bothe agayn Dethe helde contradyccyon
            
            
               whiche concordaunce nomore ſyguyfyeth
               To playne vnderſtandyng but in euery mane
               Bothe Senſualyte & Reaſon applyeth
               Rather Dethe to flee then with hit to be tane
               Loo in that poynt accorde they holly thane
               And in all other they clerely dyſcorde
               Thus is trewly ſet thy doubtfull monacorde
            
            
               I heryng that kneled on my kne
               And thanked her lowly for her dyſcyplyne
               That ſhe woucheſafe of her benygnyce
               Of tho gret doubtes me to enlumyne
               well was ſhe worthy to be called Doctryne
               If it had be nomore but for the ſolucyon
               Of my demaunde & of this ſtraunge vyſyon
            
            
               And as I with myne hede began for to bow
               As me well ought to do her reuerence
               She thens departed I can not tell how
               But within a moment gone was ſhe thens
               Then ſayd Morpleus let vs go hens
               what ſholde we here tarye lengere
               Haſt thou not herde a generall anſwere
            
            
               To all thy maters that thou lyſt to meue
               
                  My tyme draweth nere that I muſt reſt
               And euen therwith he toke me by the ſleue
               And ſayd goo we hens for that ſholde I beſt

               Thou haſt ſeen ynough holde the content
               And euen with yt forthe with hym I went
            
            
               Tyll he had me brought agene to my bedde
               where he me founde and then pryuely
               He ſtale awaye I coude not vnderſtande
               where he became but ſodeynly
               As he came he went I tell you veryly
               whiche done fro ſlepe I gan to awake
               My body all in ſwet began for to ſhake
            
            
               For drede of the ſyght that I had ſene

               Tyll at the laſt I gan me bethynke
               For what cauſe ſhewed was this vyſyon
               I knew not wherfore I toke pen & ynke
