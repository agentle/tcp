            TO THE RIGHT worshipfull Sir Dauid Murray, speciall Gentleman of the Prince his bed-chamber, multiplication of mercy, grace, and Peace.
            
               
                  RIght Worshipfull, albeit no distance of place can disioin them in affeccion, whōe God hath conioyned by the band of one spirit: yet is it no small stop of that Christian conference, whereby either of them might happily edifie, and bee edified of others. I haue therefore taken mee to the next remedie, since I cannot reach



towards you with my tongue, I haue endeuoured by writing to bestow vpon you some spirituall gift,
               
                  Rom. 1,
                according to my line or measure: for recompence of that comforte, which I haue reaped of that grace of God, which is in you.
            I knowe these colder partes of the Ile, wherin wee soiourne, doe not vsuallie render such ripe fruites as those on which the Sun beates more hotly; yet are they also profitable in their kind for nourishment, specially of such, who from their youth haue beene accustomed to feede vpon them. Neither hath the Lord our God debarred vs from Communion of that which is the greatest glorie of the Ile: the Sun of righteousnes hath shined vpon vs also. The Lord hath made our darkenes to be light,
                  Es, 42 16:
                & led vs who were blind, a way we knew not. The Lord hath set his standerd amongst vs.
                  Esa: 49:22
                He hath not onely said to the South, keep not backe, but he hath also commaunded the North to giue, & to bring vnto him his Sonnes



from farre,

                and his Daughters from the endes of the earth. As the going foorth of the Sunne is from the one end of heauen to the other, rising in the East,
                  Psal. 19:6
                and running on like a mightie man, his race towards the West; so hath the Lawe gone foorth of Sion, and the word of the Lord from Ierusalem: the light of the Gospell through many natiōs hath come frō them of the East toward vs in the West,
                  Esai. 2:3.
                where now it standes more maruellously, thē the sun stood in Gibeō

                How long it wil so continue the lord knoweth.
            Now the shadowes of the euening are stretched ouer them of the East: the Sun is gone down ouer their Prophets.
                  Mich, 3, 6
                Darknes is vnto them in steade of diuination. If our vnthankfulnes prouoke the Lorde to withdraw it from vs, woe in like manner shal be to this land,
                  Hos. 9.12
                when God departs from it. There was neuer people before vs



had any more but their day of grace, some longer, some shorter: but as they had a morning, so hath an euening also ouertaken them. While therfore we haue the light,
               
                  Io. 12, 35

                  Luk. 19 42
                
               if we knowe those thinges which belong to our peace: for in our daies, that promise which the Lord made 2000. sixe hundred yeres agoe, is aboundantly performed; that hee would giue the endes of the earth to his Son for a possessiō
               :
                  Psalme. 2.

                  Luk. 15:8
                as peeces of lost money, and like wandring Sheep taken out of the mouth of the Lyō, and giuē in a gift to Christ, that he may saue them: these are the redeemed of the Lord, let them praise the Lord; and among them come yee in also, and giue glorie to God: take in your heart and mouth with Dauid,
               
                  Psal. 16:6

               It is written of Theodosius, that hee thanked God more, for that hee was a Christian, then for that he was an Emperour; because the glorie hee had by the one would vanish, but the benefits he enioyed by the other, hee knew wereto continue for euer: and though it may bee most iustlie great matter of your ioy, that by the fatherlie care of our Gracious Soueraigne, ye haue beene placed a domestique attendant on his Maiesties moste princely Sonne, euen from his verie Cradle (wherin hitherto you haue beene praised for fidelitie, & I hope shall be so to the end) yet let this bee your greatest glorie, that the Lord hath made you partaker of that blessing which commeth by the gospell, and giuen you the earnest of that inheritance prepared for thē, who are sanctified by Faith in Christ Iesus, for increase whereof in you,
                  Act. 20:32.
                as I dayly send vp my weake prayers vnto the Lord, so shall I be aboundantly contented to know that these smal fruits of my husbandry, which



haue grown this last Summer in the pleasant valley of Perth, not farre from your natiue soile, m ay bee any way profitable to confirme and establish that which GOD hath wrought in you. Let them therefore (Right worshipfull) come towards you, As those fruites which Iacob sent to Ioseph from Canaan Southward, to more plentifull Aegypt;

               How shall it be thought they will suffer with him on mount Caluarie, who refuse to banquet with him in his Parlour.
               2
               Penitent sinners should waite for this Table with such affection, as these sicke persons waited on the wate rs of Bethesda.

               sect. 8

               sect. 9
               These are foolish like Naaman, reckoning the Riuers of Damascus better then the waters of Israell.

               sect. 18
               Three rules to bee obserued in the right discerning of the Lords bodie.
               sect. 19
               First rule is, that euerie thing in this sacrament be taken vp in the owne kinde.
               sect. 20
               Against this rule faile Papists; and how.
               20
               Against it faile also bastard professors;
               sect. 21
               Not considering that here the bread and wine are changed.
               21
               The second rule is, that this sacrament be vsed according to Christes institution.
               sect. 22
               Papists faile against this rule also.
               22
               Sacrilegiouslie they abstract the vse of the cup from the people.
               sect. 23
               The Pope and Councell contrarie.
               23
               The third rule is, that this sacrament be vsed to the right endes.
               sect. 24
               The first ende of this sacrament, is a thankefull commemoration of Christes death.
               sect. 24
               Error of Concomitance disprooued.
               sect. 25
               Concomitance destroyeth the first ende of this sacrament.
               25
               The second end of this sacrament, is the communication of Christ, to them who are his.
               sect. 26
               In this sacrament, christ is truely exhibited & giuen.
               sect. 27
               Yet is not he receiued of euerie one, who receiueth the bread.
               sect. 28
               
                  For there is a d

                  fference betweene exhibition and acceptation.
               28
               The wicked eat not Christ in the sacrament.
               28
               Conclusion of the first part of the praecept is, they refuse a greate gift, who refuse to communicate.
               sect. 29
               The second part of the precept commaundes tryall before communion.
               sect. 30
               For the Lord will not that this table bee a snare to vs, as was Absaloms to Ammon.
               
               30

               34
               Comfort for the tender conscience, caste downe with the sight of sinne after tryall.
               sect. 35
               Two sorts of tryal, one of things perfect, another of thinges imperfect.
               35
               The tryall here commaunded is a searching out of our imperfections.
               35
               And therefore should wee not be discouraged, although after tryall wee finde them to bee many

tryeth faults done to them, more then sinnes done by them.

               The chiefe pointes of preparation before communion, are two.
               sect. 49
               First that we lay aside our olde sinnes.
               49
               Otherwaies no communion with the Lord.
               49

               Without diuorcementfrom our olde sinnes, no mariage with the Lambe.
               sect. 50
               Not a generall confession, but a particular inquisition should be made of our sinnes.
               sect 51
               The second point ofpreparation is, that wee put on the new christian disposition, consisting in these three;
               sect. 52
               First that toward God we be holy, and heauenly minded.
               sect. 53
               So that we become wearie of our earthlye pilgrimage;
               53
               And neuer rest til we return to the Lord,

               The time warneth vs to celebrate this supper like a Passeouer.
               55
               But moste of all, the meditation of the loue of God is profitable to worke in vs this heauenly disposition.

               60
               The second part of our new christian disposition, is that toward our neighbors we be louing.
               sect. 61
               Without loue we cannot be of the communion of saints.

Before we communicate,1. That wee trie. he requires triall; and after triall hee commaundes to communicate: and so he encounters with two sorts of men,2 That we eate. whereof the one eats of this bread, and tries not; and these faile against the first: the other tries themselues, but eats not of this bread, and these faile against the second; both of them are here corrected by the Apostles precept. In handling whereof,Last part of the precept first handled, and why: wee begin first at the last part, that such as are resolued to bide away, if it please God, may bee made willing to come; and then by God his grace, we shall returne to the first, that such as are willing to come, may bee instructed how they should communicate.

by a commaundement to eate and drink at this Table. Do this (said our Sauiour) in remembrance of me. Our first father Adam failed in eating of that tree of knowledge of good and euill, whereof God forbade him to eate; but many of his sonnesfailes in refusing to eat of that tree oflife, whereof God commaundes them to eate. In their worde they condemne the fact of their fathers, because they were, Sicut omnium parentes, ita omnium peremtores,
               
                  Bern. super Euan. missus: hom. 2. 
               & prius peremptores quam parentes: perishers of their posteritie ere euer they were parents; and in their deed they are dayly imitators of their folly. It was a punishment vnto Adam to bee debarred from the tree of life, and it is but a pastime to many of his foolish posteritie to debarre themselues from it.sect. 7. The Apostate man will eate where God forbids him, and will not eate, where god cōmands him. Mat. 24.

Christ ordeyned it a sacrament for the communication of himselfe to the faithfull at the table; they haue turned it into a sacrifice for the oblation of Christ to his Father on an altar. Iesus brak the bread & gaue it: but they, if they break the bread, they giue it not, & if they giue it, they breake it not.

It is therfore a vile error also of the Papists, who affirme that the wicked in this Sacrament eate Christ, but to their damnation: It is contrarie to the word of God & reformed antiquitie:The wicked

               It is pittie to see how the great multitude runne to this holy Sacramēt without tryall and examination of themselues,sect. 31. Many make it a snare, that consider not, who they them selues are. and all because they heare of a breade of life, which heere is exhibited to the Communicants at this holye Table: it is verie true, that great thinges are exhibited heere indeede, but thou shouldest first of all enquire of thy selfe, who art thou? what interest thou hast in this Communion? and whether or no thou be one of those to whom these holy thinges do appertaine?Hag. 2.14 for if thou in thy person be a profane and vnsanctified creature, thy touching of these holye thinges may defile them, and make thee giltie of the contempt of them, but shall not benefit thee; yea a greater cursse then that which Elisha pronounced on the vnb

               Zedekiah, hauing his eyes pulled out, & man should not lament for it: But where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty and



freedome, there is a knowledge and detestation of sinne, and a sighing to God for deliuerance from the bondage.Ezec. 8.9, The Prophet Ezechiel could not see the abominable idalitries of the house of Israel, till the Lord taught him to digge through the wall: but we shal be farre lesse able to see the vile abominations that are in our owne hearts, vntill the spirite of the Lord digge through and demolish that thicke and hard wall of induration, that naturallie hideth vs from the sight of our sins, and keepeth vs in blindnes vnder Sathans bondage.
            The other thing wherby wee are to proceede in this tryall,sect. 44 The next is the word of God. is the word of God; for euerie thing that is imperfect, must betryed by another not by it self: golde is tryed by the fire & touchstone; the weight of a thing is tryed by the ballance, and the spots of the face are tryed by the glasse.For euery imperfect thing must be tryed by another thē it selfe. Thus euerie imperfect thing that is tryed, is tryed by another not by it self. As to the law of God, it is a moste perfect rule, by which God will haue men and their actions tryed; but it is to bee tryed by no other then it selfe. If any man will trie scripture, hee



must with the Nobles of Beraea,
               Act. 17, 11: trie it by the scripture so then the word serueth vnto vs as a touchstone for our tryall, as a glasse for discouery of our spots; and as the ballance of the sanctuarie, wherein wee must bee weighed in the last day the secrets of all hearts wil be iudged by the Gospel,
               Rom, 16 Manye try themselues by wrong rules, and therefore are deceiued: and therefore it were good that in time wee did iudge our selues by it; some trie themselues by it; some trye themselues by themselues, supposing they are such indeede, as they haue conceiued themselues to bee: some againe measure thēselues by others, speciallie with such as in their opinion, are behind them, not with such as in light and grace doe farre excell them; like that Pharisie;Luke, 18.11. who when he came to examine himself before God, thought hee was good enough, because he was not like the Publican wherein hee was also miserablie deceiued; for suppose he spake the truth, yet spake it ignorantlie, as Caiaphas saide, that one behooued to die for the people: he was not like the Publican▪ indeede the Publican was much better then he: for he came to the temple, humble, and penitent, and went home to his



house iustified, whereas the Pharisee puft vp with a conceit of his owne righteousnesse, and iustifying himselfe, went away out of the Temple▪ more

Now the lord cals vpon vs by his word & sacramēt, Let vs also pray,Rom. 5. that the Lord wold shed abroad in our hearts by his holy spirit the sence of that loue of God; then should we neglecting all things runne after the Lord, seeking onely to inioy him.
            
               Sect. 60The men of this world maruell to beholde the suddaine change of life,



which is made in the children of God by his effectuall calling;Worldlings, who tarry from christ, if they were touched with the sence of this loue, wold forsake all & follow him. they maruell to see them running so feruently after Christ, seeking him by continuance in prayer, by hearing of his word, by participation of his Sacrament, and that with such an insatiable desire, that in this life they can neuer be satisfied with hearing, reading, praying, and communicating: but if the Lord should in like manner touch their hearts, and let them feele the power of an inward calling then would they marueile no more, farre lesse disdaine, yea, they would make haste, and ioyne themselues to the company of the godly: And Saul also shold become amōgst the Prophets.

downe at the feete of Christ, to craue his mercie; in steed of her wanton lookes, her eies poure out teares, & her beautifull hayre, which before shee set out as a proclaimer of her luste, now shee pulleth downe to wash the feet of Christ. Thus all the former meanes of her sin, she maketh new witnesses of her repentance; the man in like manner,And sinful men shold be chainged like M

We are therfore so much the more to vse all the ordinary meanes, which may entertain in vs y• little spark of the loue of god, til it grow vp vnto a great flame, for the farther vnion & coniunction of our soules with Iesus Christ; and this for our dispositiō towards God.
            
               As concerning our Christian disposition to our neighbour,sect. 61. The secōd part of our new christian disposition is that towards our neighbour we be louing it is vsuall to the spirit of God, to comprise it vnder loue. Our Sauiour saith that loue is the cognisance of his Disciples, & the Apostle calleth it the band of perfection and fulfilling of the law; & no maruell, for loue speaketh with the tongue of euerie vertue. All the sundrie precepts, we are commanded to doe vnto our neighbour, are summarily comprehended vnder this one, Loue one another, As this sacrament sealeth vp the cō
               munion of the members with the head, so it seales vp the communion of the members amongst themselues: for this bread whereof we eate, is of many graines of wheat made vp into one bread; & the wine is the iuice of many berries collected & vnited into one, to teach vs that all the communicāts at this holy table, how many soeuer they be, ought to agree together in one, like mēbers of one body, as hauing one Father, one faith,



one Baptisme, one inheritance, as Brethren quickned al by one & the selfe same spirit, (which is not to bee found againe in all the world, except in this excellent brother-hood:) as we cannot be ioyned to the heade without faith,Without loue we cannot be of the cō
                  munion of saints. so can we not be knit to the member without loue. Stones and timber cannot make vp a building till they be ioyned, and sundry peeces of mettall cannot bee melted in one worke without fire; no more can Christiās be vnited in one mistycall body without loue, and therefore our Sauiour at the celebration of this Sacrament, recommended lou

                to his Disciples by a new commaundement,Iohn. 13, 3
                     •
                  . which he so called, because it should neuer wax olde: yea, so much doth he account of it, that he will accept no seruice wee owe to himselfe, without that duety of loue we owe to our bretheren.Math. 5. 
               If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, & there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leaue thy offering, goe thy

As men (saith Lactantius) are mortall,
               As men are mortall, so should their anger be.
