            Obſeruations in this
Firſt Treatiſe.
            
               Obſeruation,
               1. The Hypocrite is a very
Banquerout, euen worth nothing,
and heare

                     1 What an Hypocrite hath.
                     2 This that he hath is nothing
in truth.
                  
               
            
            
               And that becauſe
               1 He hath no right to it.
               2 Neither any right vſe.
               3 Nor any true comfort.
               4 Nothing to what he ſeemes
to haue.
               5 Nothing in compariſon of the
Elect.
               6 Nothing to what he ſhould haue.
               7 Nothing that he dooth is accepted.
               8 Nothing to that he would haue.
               9 Neither any thing in continuance.
            
            
               
               Vſe, 1.
               1 Not to fret at his proſperity,
               2 Nor to reſt in his meaſure,
               3 To obſerue his end, and
               4 Trie our Eſtate by him.
            
            
               Obſeruation 2.
               The Hypocrite, though he
hath nothing, yet he makes himſelfe
rich, 1 And why:
               2 By what meanes he doth this,
               1 By concealing his Eſtate, &
not taking notice of his beggery,
being onely rich in ignorance, or
ſecuritie,

And how to trie our Eſtates
hereby.
               3 By ouer-rating that he hath,
and ſo thereby how to preuent
this miſchiefe,
               
                  
4 Arrogating more then hee
hath, with the Furtherances

               Vſe.
               1 How to trie our ſelues thereby,
and
               2 Preuent this miſchiefe.
               5 The Hypocrite makes himſelfe
Rich, by vſurping Gods
bleſſings:
            
            
               Vſe.
               How to trie & preuent vſurpation,
               6 The Hypocrite makes himſelfe
rich in ſingularity, and deſpiſing
others. Vſe.

wherby the Hypocrite enricheth
himſelfe, as
               1 By reſtraining wher God giues liberty,

and abuſing to this end the Patience
of the Almightie,

WORSHIPFVLL
Companies of Fiſhmongers
and Skinners
my eſpeciall good patrones
and Benefactors. All
neceſſarie bleſſings to fit
them to euerlaſting
happines in Ieſus
Chriſt.
            RIght Worſhipfull and
beloued in the Lord Ieſus,
my harts deſires ſo
long as I abide in this houſe
of clay, that I may be made
manifeſt, eſpecially vnto the
conſciences of thoſe, who

haue bene the meanes of
my more comfortable pilgrimage
through this vale
of teares. And therefore as
the Lord hath vſed your
bountie as a gratious morning
raine to cheriſh the
ſeed-time of my yonger ſtudies,
ſo haue I eſteemed it
very equall, that you ſhould
reape ſome part of the harueſt
of my riper fruits: Acknowledging
my ſelf much
bound to my gracious God,
that hath renued my daies
to leaue ſome memoriall of
your loue, and my reſpect
thereof. And purpoſing as
the Lord ſhall lend further
health, not to ceaſe to ſtirre
vp your pure minds to make
ſure your Election, by encreaſing
and abounding in

loue vnto his Saints. Bleſſed
be God euen the father of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who
hath taught you this holy
wiſedome, to make you
friends of your vnrighteous
Mammon, and to laye a
good foundation againſt
the day of Chriſt Ieſus; And
faithfull is he that hath promiſed
and will accompliſh
his worke in you, that you
may be conſtant and abound
in the worke of the
Lord, that your labour may
not be in vaine in the Lord:
Hold on thē in the name of
God Beloued, while ye yet
haue time, and the Lord
proſper you in this bleſſed
worke of weldoing to the
houſhold of faith. Oh how
ſhall you maintaine the true

honour of this famous Citie
to be ſtill the treaſurie of
the poore, and nurſerie of
learning, and true religion?
how ſhall you ſanctifie the
portion which the Lord
hath lent you, to make it
conſtant to your poſteritie,
when you ſhall thus offer
the firſt fruits of your encreaſe
vnto the Lord? Shall
not the loynes of the poore
bleſſe you, doe not their
prayers keepe away the vengeance
from your Citie? Are
you not the meanes to continue
& deriue the Goſpel to
poſteritie, do you not thereby
prepare the Church of
God to eternitie? And ſhall
not the generatiōs to come
eſteeme you bleſſed? ſhall
not your poſteritie be nurſed

vp in the Church? ſhall
not the memoriall of the
iuſt liue for euer? Surely if
my poore life and meanes
may any whit further hereunto:
as I do offer vnto you
vnfainedly this pledge therof:
So let me intreate you in
the merites of Ieſus Chriſt,
to take it as a glaſſe to trie
your eſtates by, and ſo hold
what is good and warrantable
for your ſoules happines.
I doubt not but you are
wiſe to diſcerne of the euils
of the time: And howſoeuer
the prouerbe now if euer,
may be verified, that hee
which knowes not to diſſemble,
knowes not how to
liue: yet I truſt you haue
learned by gratious experience,
that as the Lord liueth,

truth in the inward
parts, and hath no need of
our lie and hypocriſie to
maintaine his truth, ſo he
hath and wil daily confound
the equiuocating Ieſuite
and lukewarme profeſſor,
the diſſembling Papiſt, and
ſhifting Ambodexter, that ſo
we neither need feare their
malice, nor eate of ſuch
things as pleaſe them: Onely
the Lord make you ſo
wiſe in the diſpenſation of
your Stewardſhips; that as
you diſtribute to others, ſo
you may reſerue for your
ſelues, being humbled in
your weldoing here, that
you may not looſe the comfort
of it in an other life. And
giuing God the whole glorie
of all his meanes towards

you, that hath giuen you an
enlarged hart for the aduācement
of his Goſpell: that ſo
you may more and more be
emptied of all prepoſterous
loue of earthly things. And
conſidering, that hee that
ſcattereth ſhall haue plentie:
you would therefore learne
to liue by faith in the feare of
God, caſting your bread vpon
the waters. And the more you
diſcerne the world to be giuen
ouer to abominable Sacriledge,
Euen to robbe the
Lord in his Tythes and offerings,
the more you would
hereby approue your ſelues
to be choſen out of the world,
that you ſeeke not your owne,
but that which is Ieſus Chriſts
ſtill miniſtring vnto the neceſſities
of the Saints. And

ouercomming, & confounding
the euill of the time,
by iudging wiſely of the cauſe
of the afflicted, and husbanding
well, yea encreaſing
daily the Treaſury, which
your Perdeceſſors left vnto
you, that your poſteritie
may be encouraged and bleſſed
by your holy example. And
the poore Church of Chriſt
may now ye
                better be maintained,
by how much the
worlde eſteemes it Gods
beſt ſeruice, to emptie and
ſpoyle the ſame.
            For mine owne part; As
it hath pleaſed my good God
to exerciſe me with continuall
afflictions, and lingering
ſickneſſes; diſinabling mee
from my calling, and ſo caſting
mee into many extremities:

ſo it is my great cō
               fort,
that I haue foūd a ſtrong
& faithfull GOD, in my greateſt
infirmities: who as hee
hath reſtored life, though in
ſome weake meaſure, ſo will
hee not alſo fupplie meanes
gratiouſly? Yea ſurely: Bleſſed
be his name, that though
the Lions want, & ſuffer hunger,
yet they that feare the
Lord ſhall want nothing that
is good: And I bleſſe God,
that I haue foūd more good
in my greateſt Afflictions,
then euer I could haue hoped
for in my greateſt proſperitie.
Surely, if it were no
more, but to knowe our ſelues
truely, to diſcerne the inſufficiencie,
and deceitfulnes of worldly
things, and ſo to bee wayned
from the loue of them, the moſt

ſharpeſt Afflictions were not
bought too deare: But that
our light Afflictions, whicb are
but for a moment, ſhould not
onely proue meanes to trie
and increaſe Gods graces in
vs, but to procure vnto vs i
                     •
                  y
euen vnspeakeable and glorious:
and ſo to ſeale vs vnto ſaluation,
.2 Pet. 1. 9. 10. and ſo
giue vs poſſeſſion of happines,
euen in this life: yea,
to cauſe vnto vs a farre more excellent,
and eternall waight of
glorie in Heauen: muſt we not
truely account that the Afflictions
of this preſent Time, are
not worthy of the glory that ſhall
be ſhewed vnto vs? And is not
the Lord mercifull vnto vs,
(my Beloued) that hath not
onely ſtored vp vnto vs ſo
many bleſſings (in our afflictions,)

but hath alſo heerein
dealt ſo mildely, and kindely
with vs, as not to ſweepe vs
away, with the Beeſom of deſtructiō,
as the Powder Treaſon
intended, and our ſinnes
had deſerued: but to weaken
vs by degrees, and to confound
vs in our carnall confidence,
that ſo we might be
invited to Repentance, and
have gratious laiſure therto?
The Lorde make vs wiſe to
ſee the plague, and hide our
ſelues. Is it not high time to
turne vnto the Lorde? when
the Firſt Borne being ſmitten,
the next that ſucceeded, was
palpable Darknes: And then
the next, the red Sea, to ſwallow
vp quicke? Who ſo is
wiſe, ſhall vnderſtand theſe
things, & to whom the arme

of the Lorde ſhall reueale
them.
            For this ſhall I not ceaſe
to pray vnto God, for you,
that the Keeper of Iſrael, may
keepe you from ſecurity, and
recouer the things that are readie
to die. To whoſe bleſſed
protection, I doe moſt hartily
commend you, in Ieſus
Chriſt.

            THe holy Ghoſt (as I
take it) in theſe words
ſhadoweth out vnto
vs, the difference betweene
an Hypocrite, and a ſincere
Chriſtian. And that

wiſedome in making the
beſt of them? This the Spirit
of God further reueales
vnto vs.
            As firſt, for the Hypocrite
thogh he be worth nothing,
hath nothing in truth, nothing
in the right vſe, nothing
in acceptance, yet he

               makes himſelfe rich: that is,Reuel. 3. 17.
               hee doth not ſee his emptines,
nay he will not ſee it,Luk. 12. 18. 19. yea he
would faine be eſteemed
rich, and in his carnall wiſedome
he makes himſelfe rich:
thus doth he make the beſt
of his nothing, thus doth he
ſet out, and lengthen his
banquerout eſtate.
            As for the vpright in hart,
               Rom. 8. 21.
it is not ſo with him. Thogh
hee haue great riches in
truth,2. Tim. 4. 8. 
               and greater in expectation,
yet ſaith the Spirit he
makes himſelfe poore: that is,
he ſtands not vpō the ſhew,
nor ſets them out to ſell,Matt. 5. 3 he
proclaimes not his riches,Luke. 5. 8.
nor depends thereon,Luk. 14. 11. but
abaſeth himſelfe that he may be
exalted,
               Matt. 16 
               denies himſelfe that he
may be 
                     •
                  ound in Chriſt; forgets

that which is behinde, that he
may haſten to that which is before,
though he knowe nothing
by himſelfe, yet he is not iuſtified.
3. Phil. 1 Cor. 4. 4.
            2 Yea though hee were
perfect, yet he knowes not
his owne ſoule. Iob. 9. 27.
Nay, he knowes that God is
greater then his conſcience,
and knoweth al things, euen
the ſecret ſinnes which he
cannot diſcerne. And therefore
hee abhorres his life,
and beares the yoake from
his youth: he ſitteth alone
and keepeth ſilence, becauſe
he hath borne it vpon him:
he putteth his mouth in the
duſt, if there may be hope:
he giueth his cheeke to him
that ſmiteth him, he is filled
full of reproaches: For hee

knoweth that his God will not
forſake for euer; but though
he ſend affliction, yet will he
haue compaſſion according
to the multitude of his mercies.

            Firſt, becauſe he hath no
right in any thing that hee
hath, he is but a thiefe, and a
Robber, an Vſurper of Gods
graces. And therefore whatſoeuer
he hath,
                  
                     •
                  . Becauſe 
                     •

                  ght. is none of his.
Well may he prouide, and
prepare it as a Cooke, but the
righteous ſhall be fed therewith,
he ſhall gather ſiluer as
the duſt, but the Saints ſhall diuide
it. Iob. 27. Ioh. 10.
            
               Secondly,
               
                  
                     •
                  . No right 
                     •
                  ſe. he hath no right
vſe of any thing that he
hath; his conſciēce is defiled.
and ſo all things are impure
vnto him: and how can he
but abuſe and peruert the
ſame? Either miſſing in the
ground, as not doing it in

               Faith, or failing in the manner,
not according to the
rule of the word, or abhorring
from the right end the
glorie of God. Tit. 1. 15. Rom.
14. 1. Cor. 10. 31.
            That which he doth proceeding
from naturall knowledge
or good intention and
meaning, or at the beſt a
vaine preſumption, or temporarie
faith: his manner of doing,
being in wilworſhip and
bodily ſeruice, which profiteth
nothing, his end being
to rob God of his glory, and
transferre it to himſelfe, and
ſo to expreſſe ſome degrees
of the ſinne, of Antichriſt,
euen to aduance himſelfe aboue
all that is called God,
and yet to ſatisfie the fleſh,
& make his belly his God.

2. Coll. 3. Phil. 19. to ſacrifice
to his net, and ſo make his
wit, & induſtrie his God. In
a word, meerely to ſeeke
himſelfe, and to put out all
ſenſe and vſe of the diuine
power. Matt. 13. 2 Coll. 25.
1. Tim. 4. 8. 2. Theſſ. 2. 10.
Abac. 2.
            Thirdly,No true 
                     •
                  omfort. alſo the hypocrite
may be ſaid to haue
nothing, becauſe he hath no
true comfort and ſucceſſe in
what he hath. Though the
Lord giue him his deſire, yet
he ſends leannes into his ſoule:
Pſal. 106. 15. he hath either
ſome inward gripe of conſcience,
or ſome outward leproſie
accompanying his greateſt
and ſecureſt reuellings, in
his moſt glorious happines,
Prouerb. 14. 3. 2. Rom. 5. 27.

ſomewhat there is, ſo ſcarres
and croſſes him, that all his
honour is nothing vnto him,
the cōſcionable walking of
the Saints, confounds his
pompous and outſide profeſſion.
Heſter. 5. The poore
vineard of Naboth lies ſo
conuenient, that he cannot
hold vp his head, nor eate
his meate, vnleſſe he may
embrue his hands in blood,
to enjoy the ſame, 2. Kin. 29.
ſome ſuch like thing there
will be ſtil to procure enuie,
& diſcontent; that ſo though
hee hath ſomewhat, yet indeed
beholding it often in
the true glaſſe of the word,
and the holy examples of the
Saints,
               4. Nothing in regard of others. hee ſees it to be nothing,
in compariſon of what
others haue. And yet ſuch is

the ſtrength of deluſion,
that he is giuen vp vnto:
that what he wants in ſubſtance,
that he will make vp
in complement, and ſhew; and
ſo indeed is nothing to that
he ſeemes to be,
               5. Nothing to what he ſeemes to haue. faine would
he ſeeme to be perfect, if you
will beleeue his ſhewes: nay,
if you will beleeue his owne
word: he ſaith he is rich, and
encreaſed in Goods, and hath
need of nothing, Reuel. 3. 17.
And yet the ſpirit tells him,6. Nothing to that he ſaid he hath.
               he is poore and blind, and miſerable,
he hath nothing of
what hee ſaith, becauſe he
makes himſelfe rich: therefore
he hath nothing.
            And well were it with him
if hee might bee his owne
Iudge, though hee were deceiued
in himſelfe, yet hee

might be approued of God:
But obſerue I pray you a further
meaſure of Gods iudgement
vpon him, that what
is highly eſteemed of M
                     •
                  n, is
abomination in the ſight of God,
Luke, 16. 15. becauſe the
hypocrite ſo ouerrates his
goodnes, and ſtandeth vpon
his terms of vprightnes and
perfection: therefore the
Lord reiects his confidēce,
Ierem. 2. and condemneth
his painted ſhews, and vaine
boaſting. The Publicane that
confeſſeth his ſinne, is accepted,7. Nothing, becauſe not accepted.
when the proud Phariſie
that boaſteth of his
righteouſneſſe, making it
ſeeme greater then in trueth
it is, is therefore reiected of
God, Luke, 18. becauſe his
perſon is abominable. Thus

hath the hipocrite nothing,
becauſe it is not accepted of
God; whoſe acceptance only
giues true valuation, and
worth to all our actions:
which in thēſelues are worthy
nothing but ſhame and confuſion,
Dan. 9. And can the
Iuſt and holie Lord doe otherwiſe?
            
               Doth he not loue truth in the
inward parts? Pſal. 51. Is the
Hypocrite any thing in the
truth,8. Nothing to that hee ſhould haue Is that he hath ought
to what he ſhould haue? ſurely,
hee ſhould be vpright in
hart, but he hath ſeuen abominations,
yea, deceitfulnes
the root of all: he ſhould
haue his profeſſion and practiſe
anſwere eache other:
but alas, muſt not his Iacob-like
profeſſion cōdemne his

               Eſau-like practiſe? Is he not
of his father the diuell, euen a
murtherer of his brethren,
though hee profeſſe himſelf
to be the ſonne of Abraham?
Iohn. 8 44. Thus is the
hypocrite nothing to that which
he ſhould be. And therefore it
is iuſt with God, that
            
               He ſhall be nothing to what he
would be. He would be happy:
And yet of all men ſhall be
beaten with moſt ſtripes.9. Nothing to what hee would be
                     •
                  
               
               Math. 25. He would be honoured
of the people. 1. Sam. 15.
And yet is hated, becauſe he
makes profeſſion; yea more
iuſtly ſcorned, becauſe hee
ſhames his profeſſion; hee
would enioy the pleaſures of
ſinne with greedines: yet is
hee often brideled with the
credit of his profeſſion. And

ſo is more inwardly enflamed
to Luſt, and enraged againſt
God: And that wee
may yet further behold and
admire the Iuſtice of our
glorious God: Obſerue (I
pray you) that
            Howſoeuer the Hypocrite
denieth the power of goalines,
yet would hee faine retaine
forme and ſhew thereof:10. No, not ſo much as in ſhew. that
ſo he may ſtill deceiue himſelfe
and others. But doth
not the Lord euē reuert this
his confidence often times?
Dooth hee not take away
his reſtraining ſpirit, and giue
him vp with all greedines to
break out into groſſe ſinnes?
Rom. 1. 25. 26 Doth not the
Hypocrite hereupon labour
to dead his conſcience, by
reiecting knowledge, that ſo

hee may cōmit ſin more ſecretly
without controlmēt?

he ſeemed to haue, taken away
from him? Matth.

                  5. His
madnes ſhalbe made manifeſt to
all men; No longer ſhall hee

preuayle, to deceiue Gods
people 2. Tim. 3. 9. Hee ſhall
no more weare arough garmēt,
to beguile inſtable ſoules. 13.
Zach. 4. Thus will the Lord
vncaſe the Hypocrite in this
life. And thus hath he nothing
of what hee would haue, though
hee would haue nothing but a
ſhew, which indeede is nothing.
            
            Laſtly, Not to paſſe ouer
the reaſon of the holy ghoſt:11. Nothing, becauſe hee makes himſelfe rich.
Euen becauſe hee makes himſelfe
rich, therfore, he hath nothing:
For can that bee any
thing in Truth, which hee
makes himſelfe to be, ſeeing
it is of God, whatſoeuer is
good in vs: And becauſe hee
makes himſelfe rich, and will
not ſee his want, therefore
hath hee nothing, neither in
hand nor in hope, hee is not

onely poore but deſperately
miſerable: he muſt neceſſarily
liue and die, A corrupt
tree, and without fruit being
now twice dead by the reiecting
and abuſe of grace, and
ſo fit for nothing, but for
eternall vengeance? Iud. 12.
Math. 3.
            2 And can hee haue any
thing,2. Becauſe Gods giues him nothing. vnleſſe the Lord
doe giue it him in mercy?
And will the Lord giue him
grace, who refuſeth the ſame?
hath by ſinne diſabled himſelfe
for̄ the right vſe therof? Iud.4.
And ſhall not all that is giuen
him further his condemnation? Well may the
Lord lend him his goods,
well may he entrude vpon
them: But free gift he hath
none, nor freely ſhall enioy

them: but as hee abuſeth
them to Gods dishonour, ſo
ſhall he be ſtripped of them
with ſhame, and bee caſt off
from all hope, euer to attain
them againe: Yea, be caſt into
eternall puniſhments, for the abuſe
of them, Math. 25. 30.
            Well, thus we ſee in what
reſpects the hypocrite hath
nothing. As alſo the reaſons
that he muſt needs haue nothing:
ſeeing as neither that
which hee hath, is giuen him
to enioy, Tim
                     •
                  t, 6. and ſo it is
no better then nothing: Nay
better neuer to haue had any,
then at ſuch a rekoning:
Neither dooth hee deſire the
ſubſtance of goodnes, but the
ſhewe thereof,
                  
                     •
                  . Becauſe he deſires it 
                     •
                  as nothing in ſhew, no
                     •
                   ſubſtance, which is as
nothing. And ye
                  •

it hindered the enioying
of the pleaſures of ſinne.Nay, in the ende reiecteth the very ſhewe.

1. Not to

which furthers the
ſame, ſeeing al is as nothing,
yea worſe then nothing, euen

37. 1. 8.
            Secondly,Vſe, 2. not to Content
our ſelues with the Hypocrites
meaſure, neither to
ſquare our ſelues according
to his line, ſeeing all he hath
is no more then nothing:
Nay, leſſe then nothing, a
meere lye, an Idol, 2. Cor. 10.
            But rather ſo trie our ſelues
by the hypocrites ſcantling,3.
as wherin he hath any thing,
therein not to excuſe ourſelues,
if we come ſhort of him,
               
vpon pretence, becauſe hee
abuſeth it, therefore we may
be without it, or not ſafely venture
on it, but rather, wherein
hee is any thing, therein labour
wee to be much more,
not contending in the ſhew,
but laboring to expreſſe the
ſubſtance, and making good
in our practiſe, what we haue
receiued in knowledge, and
ſo growing in Knowledge, that
wee may encreaſe in obedience,
till the worke of Chriſt
be perfited in vs, 1. Phil. 10.
2. Pet. 1. 6. 7. 8. 2. Cor. 5. 6.
To this ende, As the Hypocrite
thinks he is ſomewhat whē
hee is nothing, and ſo deceiues
himſelfe, Gal. 6. 4 So let vs acknowledge,
that of our ſelues
we haue nothīg, as of our ſelues:
that, in vs, that is, in our fleſh,

dwelleth no goodnes, Rom. 7.
that ſo we may be partakers
of the fatnes of the Oliue,
               How vice may goe beyond the hypocrite. 
               and
be truely ingraffed into the true
vine Chriſt Ieſus, Ioh. 15.
that ſo we may bring forth
fruit in him. Thus hauing
our right in goodnes, throgh
Ieſus Chriſt, wee ſhall alſo
haue grace to vſe it well, and
being faithfull in a little, we
ſhall be entrusted with greater
bleſſings,
               Math. 25 our faylings ſhall
not be imputed, and our infirmities
daily purged; and
we daily renued by Chriſt,
that we may growe vp in him,
which is the head, doing all in
thankefulnes vnto our God, for
his Sonne in Chriſt Ieſus, in
all things guiding our ſelues
according to his bleſſed
word, Pſal. 119. 9. and aboue

al things, ayming at the glorie
of our eternall God, 1.
Cor 10. 21 that ſo good will
may ſtill flow downe vpon
the ſonnes of men, whereby
being enabled to conſtancie
in weldoing, we ſhall fight
the good fight of faith, and
finiſh our courſe with ioy
And ſo obtaine the end of our
faith which is the ſaluation of
our ſoules. 2. Tim. 4. 7. 8.
1. Pet. 1. 9.
            Thus haue we heard of
the Hypocrites Eſtate. Shall
we now a little further conſider
of his wiſedome in the
husbanding thereof.
            The ſpirit readies vs herein
Hee makes himſelfe rich,
obſerue I pray you the manner
of the ſpeech, hee ſaith
not, that he is rich indeed of

himſelfe;The mane

                     •
                   The hypocrite makes himſelfe rich. for ſo neither he
is: neither indeed can he be;
neither doth the ſpirit ſay:
that he is made rich, for this
onely belongeth to the
Saints:Iacob. 2. whom God hath
choſen in Chriſt to make
them rich in good workes:
but, as the Iewes wold thereby
chalenge our Sauiour to
be a counterfait, becauſe, ſay
they, that he ſaid, I am the
King of the Iewes, Ioh. 19. 21.
therein intending that hee
tooke vpon him the calling
he had no right vnto: neither
indeed was the perſon
he pretended to be: So the
holy Ghoſt doth herein
iuſtly challenge the Hypocrite
of couſenage, becauſe
hee makes himſelfe
rich; when hee is a banquerout:

thereby implying
his legerdemaine, that
had deuices, not onely to
hide his pouertie, and colour
his emptines: but further
alſo was growne ſuch a Maiſter
of his trade, as to make
himſelfe rich, at leaſt ſo to
ſeeme to himſelfe, yea to
other alſo: to gaine credit of
ſuch eſteeme: when indeed
he was no better then quite
out at heeles. Obſerue wee
then here a double propertie
of an hypocrite.2.

                  mptines. Firſt, that
though hee be worth nothing,
yet in no hand can he
abide to heare of this: hee
doth not ſee his nakednes,
hee knowes not that hee is
poore and blind, and miſerable,
nay which is his deſperate
eſtate: hee will not ſee it.

And no meruaile.
            1 For as hee deſires not
to ſee his ſpirituall nakednes,
leaſt by the view thereof,
his ſeeming happines might
be diſgraced: and carnall deuotions
confounded: 2. 
                  •
               o is
hee iuſtly giuen vp by the
Iuſtice of God, to be beſotted
with outward pompe,
and proſperitie: that ſo, he
may not diſcerne his inward
wants. 3. And ſo doth hee
fall into the hands of Sathan,
the God of this world,
2. Cor. 4. 5. by whom being
blinded & further infatuated,
either with a falſe iudgement
of things, or miſapplying the
true, The Goſpell is hereby
hid vnto ſuch as periſh, that
ſo not being nowe able
to diſcerne his nakednes,

becauſe he wants this heauenly
Eye-ſalue, he might be
made more inexcuſable in
reiecting this true light, and
ſo be iuſtly giuen vp to ſtrong
deluſions, 2. Theſſ. 2. 12. becauſe
hee will not obey the
truth. Whereupon it commeth
to paſſe, that as before,
he deſired not to ſee his nakednes,
but rather to haue
it couered, & cōcealed from
himſelfe; And to this end,
being dazled with ſhewes,
and outward baits, hath not
laiſure to looke home; So:
becauſe, he reiects the birthright
in compariſon of the
meſſe of pottage, Geneſ. 27.
is therfore giuē vp to ſtrong
deluſions: By theſe deluſions
his Iudgement is ſo peruerted
and true light corrupted,

that now taking light
for darkenes, & darkenes for
light, he bleſſeth his ſoule
in this wilful ignorāce of his
eſtate:Libertine. as if it were his greateſt
happines to be ſenceleſſe
in his miſery, that herein
he may deceiue his ſoule,
that his ſinne is pardoned,
becauſe though he commit
the ſame with greedines,
Epheſ. 4. 19. yet he hath no
feeling of it, no ſting of conſcience
for the ſame. And
therefore he reſolues, that
he may follow it ſtil. Pro. 23.
            And, hereunto furthers an
other policie of Sathan, who
by leading his eyes abroad,
to view other mens eſtates,
doth increaſe hereby this
ſpiritual blindnes: And that,
when either 1. cōparing himſelfe
with others, ye
                are ſhort

of his meaſure, he thereby
reſolues ye
                his eſtate is good,
he ſees no euill in it: or elſe
ſecondly hee is ſo quickſighted
abroad, that his eyes
are put vp at home, he ſees
ſo much in others, he hath
ſuch cauſe to looke abroad,
that he hath no neede, or
leiſure to looke home: nay
by looking abroad, hee
makes ſhew that all is well at
home.2. By the

            3 Not neglecting to take
notice of the examples of
Gods chaiſtiſements vpon others
for ſin, as knowing that
ye
                like may befall vs. Pſ. 119.
            4 Eſpecially obſeruing the
ſecret and inuiſible hand of
God vpon our ſelues, meeting

with our ſinnes by ſpeciall
chaſtiſements.
            5 And that either thoſe
ordinarie and ſtrange buffetings
and renued quawmes
of the conſcience,Inward and outward. or elſe the
wounding of our good name,
our croſſings in the familie
by wife, children, ſeruants,
emptying of our eſtates, by
caſualties. &c. Pſal. 31.
            6 Aboue all things, labour
we to diſcerne the worthines
of our Sauiour and our
priuiledges in him, together
with that ineſtimable price
he paid for vs, and this will
moſt profitably bring vs to
ye
                ſight of our nakednes, that
ſo we may deſire to be cloathed
with his righteouſnes.
            7 And ſeeing: So long as
we liue here we ſhall haue
ſomewhat to blind and deceiue

vs:therfore behold we
our eſtates often in the graue,
               Conſider the excellent price of our ſaluation.
where corruption ſhall be
our mother, & the wormes
our brethren & ſiſters; And
this wil be a notable meanes
to call vs home to view our
ſelues,
                  
                     •
                  . Meditatiō of death. that ſo wee may yet
further diſcerne our pouertie.
And
            8 To this end, arreſt we our
ſelues oftē before the Iudgement
ſeate of Chriſt,
               
                  
                     •
                  . Meditatiō of the day of 
                     •
                  udgement. and prepare
we our ſoules thereto
by a daily examining of our
ſelues and caſting vp of our
accounts, that ſo we may yet
more and more take notice
of our vilenes.
            And to make our vnworthines
more truely to appeare
vnto vs,
                  
                     •
                  . Glory that

                     •
                  ealed. ſet we before
the eyes of our minds the incōparable
waight of Glory that

is layed vp for vs, viewe wee
our preſent eſtate often in
that glorious glaſſe. And this
ſhall much further the diſcouering
of vilenes.
            As for the Worlde, and
pompe thereof: ſeeing this
is no ſmall meanes to blinde
vs in our eſtates, making vs
ſeeme better then wee are,
therefore learne wee to diſcerne
the true Nature of all
earthly things. And knowing
their beſt worth to bee
but vanitie, and vexation of
ſpirit, Lam. 1. Learne we to
giue them ſuch room in our
hearts,Diſcerning▪ & renoun

                   things. as that we can learne
to be abaſed when we doe abound:
and to abound in
content and thankfulneſſe,
when we are abaſed: Phil. 4.
let our proportion be not to

ſeeke after great things: and
our deſires be, to caſt our care
vpon God. Let vs vſe the world,
as if we vſed it not. Let vs enioy
the beſt, as wee were ſtill
willing to leaue them for a
better Let vs more account,
of our right in theſe things
thē to be cloyed with them.
And prepare we our ſoules daily
for afflictions:
               Examining our obedience to any one particular Commaund. that ſo wee
may yet better ſee our emptines
and vnworthines, Ie

45. 1. Pet. 5. 1. Cor. 7.
            And leaſt wee ſhould erre
in cōtenting our ſelues with
generalls.Note. That we may diſcerne
our ſpirituall pouertie
indeede: Examine wee our
ſtrength in the keeping of
any one of Gods Commaundements:
Not ſo much waying
our failing in the Outward

actions, which are finite, and
may be excuſable, as rather
diſcerning the inward corruption,
& rebellion of the hart,
the blaſphemous thoughts,
& vile imaginations, which
credit, and feare of puniſhment,
reſtraineth from the
Act, this will much further
the diſcerning of our vilenes.
Gen. 6.
            And to this ende, take we
our ſelues to taske how wee
haue, or can keepe any one
of the Commaundements.In keeping of the Sabaoth.
Examine wee our ſelues (for
example) how we faile in the
keeping of the Sabaoth: how
we faile in preparation: how
in binding our thoughts to
the good abearing; how in
accompanying the ordinances
of God, with the intention

of the minde, to conceiue
the wil of God therin: how to
profite by that we vnderſtād:
how to communicate, what
we conceiue for the good of
others: how to keepe our
peace with God, in holy meditation,
and conference with
his Maieſtie: how to labour
peace with men, by reconciling
them vnto God: how
to order our Chriſtian libertie
on the Sabaoth, (as being
Lords thereof) that it be not
occaſion to the Fleſh, and interrupt
our ſweet communion
with our bleſſed God.
Galat. 5. And I am perſwaded,
that if we had no other
means to diſcerne our emptines
and inſufficiencie; euen
our beſt ſtriuings, for
the ſanctifying of the Sabaoth,

(as being the maine trial
of the power of ſanctification)
would ſufficiently conuince
vs, both that of our
ſelues we are able to doe nothing,
and that, corruption,
remaining in vs (if the Lord
ſhould enter into iudgment
with vs for the ſame) were
ſufficient to infatuate all the
graces of God in vs: and to
confound euen the beſt ſeruice
we can do vnto his Maieſtie.
And this I take to be
a liuely practiſe, whereby we
may attaine to the power of
ſpirituall nakednes.
            And thus doth the Lorde
raiſe Light out of darknes:
the deſperate policie of the
hypocrite in hiding his eſtate:
you ſee, hath taught vs to
diſcerne and diſcouer the

ſame, Ierem. 17. 10. And let
this be an eſpecial rule, yet further
hereunto: that though
we cannot know the depth of
corruption in vs, yet let vs
not faile ſtill to ſounde the
bottom by the power of the
word,Though vve cānot knovv the deph of corruption, yet let vs not giue ouer ſearching. and ſo farre as it pleaſeth
the Lord to diſcouer vnto
vs: let vs not be aſhamed
to ſhame our ſelues therein:
At no hād giue we here way
to Carnall wiſedome, to ſuppreſſe
or ſmoother what wee
knowe, either by excuſing it,
as the common condition
is, or diminiſhing, that it is
not ſo bad, as it is made, or as
others haue done, or by putting
it off frō our ſelues, as if
Diuine prouidence, or neceſſity,
or ſome ſufficient cauſe prouoked
thereto; or laſtly, by

               outfacing, and denying, yea,
impudent iuſtifying of the
ſame: (For this wil make way
to a reprobate ſencee,) Rom. 1.
28. But in the name of God,And what we can 
                     •
                  nd, that to remoue.
labor wee to diſcerne the vtmoſt
of our vilenes: And as
wee diſcerne, to deale faithfully
with our owne hearts:
clearing all other, and condemning
onely our ſelues;
that ſo iudging our ſelues,
we may not be iudged of the
Lord. And thus much of the
firſt propertie of the hypocrite,
that hee cannot endure to
diſcerne his nakednes.
            But doth he ſtay here? No
ſurely, this will not ſerue his
turne, to think himſelfe not
miſerable: but as hee would
be accounted happie, and to
this end, aſſumes the Cloake

of religion, ſo doth hee hereby:
through the diuine iuſtice,
giuing him vp to the
abuſe of this Sacred profeſſion,
ſo farre preuaile, by
the ſtrēgth of deluſion; that
he makes himſelfe Rich: that
is, not only in his owne conceit;
hath knowledge and happines
enough for himſelfe, yea,
ſome ouerplus for others:
but alſo to others ofttimes
makes ſo faire a ſhew, As that
his meaſure is onely approoued,
and all others reiected: yea,
happie is hee that hath now
foūd ſuch a laſt for his foote:
whereby he may ſerue God
and Mammon too, carry the
credite of Religion with the
foremoſt, and yet enioy the
pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon,
with the moſt Licentious.
            
               
Behold then an other propertie
of the Hypocrite, that
though he be a ſtarke Begger
by nature, and by tampering
with Religion, becomes
twice dead, and pluckt
vp by the rootes, made more
inexcuſable:A very deſperate banqueroute. faſter bound to
condemnation: yet ſee the
power of deluſion.
            
               Hee makes himſelfe rich:
that hee alone might haue
the glorie,2. Obſeru. Propertie of an hypocrite to make himſelfe rich. 
               hee makes himſelfe
rich, abuſing holy things, to
further this deluſion, that ſo
his glory may be his ſhame,
when his folly ſhall be made
manifeſt, when the true owner
ſhall call to account, and
recouer his right, and giue
him hise portion, euen the
fruite of his owne councells.
            What then, is this, that the

               Hypocrite makes himſelfe rich?
ſurely the meaning of the
holy Ghoſt (I take it) is,
            Not only, that he hides what
hee truly is, but alſo that hee
makes ſhew of what he is not,
and pretends great riches, by
that little he ſeems to haue:
Yet ſo, as that hee comes
not by them, by the right
meanes, they are not giuen
vnto him from the mercie
of God, but rather as an vſurper,
he intrudes vpō them;
& ſo accoūts that his owne,
which he hath no right vnto:
Or elſe hee makes himſelfe
rich, aſcribing that to himſelfe,
which is the gift of God, as if
his owne wiſdome and indu
                  •
               ſtry,
had procured them vnto
him. 1. Corinth. 2. Ierem. 9.
Dan. 4.
            
               
So that in this grace of
ſpeech, the Spirit of God implieth
generally two things:
            
            
               Firſt, that the Hypocrite
makes himſelfe rich, either
of what is not in him at all:
boaſting of what hee neuer
enioyed, or if he haue ought
hee makes it more then it is:
makes himſelfe rich:Matter wherein he is rich. wheras
indeed he wants ſufficient:
ſetting the beſt ſide outward,
and making his wild grapes
ſeeme right good Fruite.
            And ſo the Spirite hath reference
to the matter of his
riches: or,
            Secondlie, in that it is
ſaide, He makes himſelfe rich:
This (making of himſelfe,)
either implies the manner of
the Action. Namely, by
Intruſion and vſurpation, as

if it were not giuen, but
rather craftily creapt, and
incroacht vpon: or elſe it
implies the ground, and ende
of the action: namely, his
owne glorie:The māner whereby he makes himſelfe rich. as making himſelfe
rich: & being beholding
to no other for the ſame.
            All which, as they are liuely
properties of an Hypocrite,
ſo let vs in particular
conſider of them briefly in
their places.
            And firſt, that an Hypocrite
makes himſelfe Rich,
that is, makes great boaſt of
what is not truely in him at all,
               3. Obſeru. Hypocrite makes himſelfe rich of what hee hath not.
               aduācing himſelfe in the things
hee not ſo much as knowes,
neither euer ſaw. 2. Col. 18. and
ſpeaking euill of the things hee
knowes not, that ſo hee might
gaine the eſtimatiō of more

zeale and holines, 2. Pet. 22.
being as wells without water,
and clouds without raine; ſpeaking
ſwellings words and yet
which are but vanitie, and
promiſing libertie vnto others,
when himſelfe is but a ſlaue of
corruption. The ſpirit (you
ſee) giues plaine euidence
hereunto. And no maruaile.
            1 For is he not of old ordained
to condemnation,
               Reaſons. and
therefore muſt be giuen vp
to conceiue and boaſt of
what he hath hot, that ſo he
may not ſee what he wants:
nor ſeeke to what ſhould
truely make him happie?
Iud. 4 Ioh. 9.
            2 Is he not to make up
the meaſure of his condemnation,
and encreaſe the ſame,
by deceiuing himſelfe, and 
                     •
                  
                  others,
and therefore doth he

not make ſhew of what is
not in him, that ſo he might
beguile vnſtable ſoules, Ma.
23. 2. Pet. 2. 17. 18. in drawing
them by theſe ſhewes
to make a mocke of religion
and ſo either to keepe from
embracing thereof, or to
nouzle them in a deceitfull
entertainment of the ſame.
Heb. 6. 45.
            3 And can he otherwiſe
walke as an Angell of light,
and arrogate perfection vnto
himſelfe, if hee did not
boaſt of what was not in
him. 2. Cor. 11.
            4 Is 
                  •
               he not hereby prouoked,
to eſteeme baſely of religion:
               
                  
                     •
                  ob. 21.
ſeeing it can ſerue as
a broker to make him ſeeme
what hee is not: And ſo is
nouriſhed in his Athieſme,
and contempt of God?
            
               
5 And doth he not exalt
himſelfe hereby in voluntarie
deuotions and formall complements
euen aboue all that is
called God? 2. Theſſ. 2. Col. 2
            6 Can he do otherwiſe,
that is ſo blinded by the
God of this world, as to take
light for darkenes, and
darkenes for light? 2. Cor. 4.
Eſay. 5.
            7 Is he not as a deceiued
Doue without heart, hauing
his iudgement peruerted,
and ſo muſt needs imagine
himſelfe to be what he is
not. Hoſe. 7.
            8 Doth he not meaſure
his eſtate by falſe rules,
As, Cuſtome, Time, Examples,
eſpecially ſuch as haue
leſſe then hee: letter of the
lawe, his owne vaine heart,

and ſo by theſe broakers is
further flattered to conceiue
himſelfe to be what he is
not, Ioh, 7. 48. Heſter. 3.
Learne we hence.
            1 To conuince the hypocrite
by this,Vſe. that he boaſts
of what good is not in him,
and withall denies the euill
that is in him.
            2 To trie our eſtate in ſinceritie
by this,How to trie our eſtates 
                     •
                  ereby. that we be ſo
farre from boaſting of what
is not in vs; or aſſuming that
to our ſelues which is vainely

               aſcribed vnto vs; As, that
though we are poſſeſſed of
many excellent graces, yet
we aſſume no right in them
but by the right vſe of them,
 and becauſe we faile at the
beſt in the vſe,Iob. 31. therfore take
we heed of beholding the ſonne

when it ſhineth; that is, of being
dazeled with the graces
of God in vs, leaſt ſpirituall
pride be nouriſhed, & ſecurity
maintained, & ſo through
negligence and vnprofitablenes
we be ſtripped of Gods bleſſings.
Rather in the feare of
God, Let vs feare our ſelues
               
               moſt when we haue greateſt
mercies. And be iealous of 
our ſelues, though not in regard
of our knowledge of
the right in, & truth of the
action, neither of the acceptance
thereof in Chriſt Ieſus;
yet of the exactnes and
worthines thereof in it ſelfe.
And of any warrant as from
our ſelues, to perſeuere & continue
in weldoing.
            And ſeeing do what we can,
vaineglorie will ſteale vpon
vs; and ſo prouoke to boaſt

of what is not in vs,How to preuent this euill. leaſt we
ſhould be accounted negligent,
ſhort of others, vnthankfull,
&c.
            Therefore learne wee in
the feare of God to preuent
this ſinne.
            And that by theſe meanes.
            1 Labour we, ſound and
perticular knowledge of our eſtate,
and meaſure, by daily
viewing our ſelues in the
glaſſe of the word, and examining
our hearts, and priuie
corruptions, and daily Iudging
our ſelues by vnfained
repentance.
            2 Keepe we our Iudgement
ſound, and ſpirituall, by cleauing
cloſe to the power of
the word, and hating all
vaine, & falſe rules, Pſal. 119.
As opinion, cuſtome, example,
multitude, fleſh and blood, &c.
            
            
               
3 Reſolue wee our ſelues;
that though we muſt ſtriue
to be with the foremoſt, yet
there are many that may,
and doe goe beyond vs in
grace, whoſe examples wee
are to admire, reuerence,
and imitate ſo farre forth, as
that we ſtriue not to leape
vp to them by a vaine conceit
of what is not in vs; but
rather ſoberly ſubmitting
our ſelues to ſuch meanes
wherein we may follow after
them:Note. that (whereas the hypocrite
being not willing to
take the paines, which may
bring to perfection, and yet
through ye pride of his heart
arrogates no leſſe, and therefore
in ſteed of the lōg & tedious
way of practiſe, makes
a ſhorter cut euen to bragge

of what hee hath not: wee
notwithſtanding may in patience
poſſeſſe our ſoules,
comforting our ſelues ſo in
the truth of the meaſure, we
haue alreadie attained vnto:
as that ſtill we forget what is
behind;

                  il. 13 14. And haſten to that

                  •
               d after the marke for the
high price of our calling in
Ieſus Chriſt.
            4 Laſtly, aboue all things
labour wee for aſſurance of
faith in the ſonne of God Hebr.
10. which though it be attained
by cōſcience, & power
of weldoing, yet becauſe
it ſeeth a farre off; therefore
doth it ſtill carrie vs out of
our ſelues: both to reſt
wholy on Chriſt for the
matter of our reioycing,

and in him alone to the recompēce
of the reward, that
ſo we may be ſo farre frō aſſuming
what is not in vs, as
that ſtill we denie our ſelues,
that wee may be found in
Chriſt not hauing our owne
righteouſnes. Yet
            Though wee abaſe our
ſelues, let vs not diſhonour
our God in denying, or betraying
any of his graces in vs,
ſeeing this may be a meanes
to be giuen vp to boaſt of
what is not in vs, if we ſhall
denie the truth, or abaſe
the worth of any of Gods
mercies beſtowed vpon vs.
            And therfore take we heed
of running into the other
extreame.
            1 But, As God hath giuen,
ſo let vs acknowledge

a truth, to confound hypocriſie,
though wee cannot
chalenge perfection, which
makes for our humiliation.
            2 Let not Sathan or the
world, take away our innocencie
from vs, though before
the Lord we are not thereby
iuſtified. Iob. 27. 1. Cor.
4. 4. 5.Wherein the child of God may aduance Gods grace.
            
            3 Let vs propoſe our
example to thoſe that are
ſhort of vs; though we muſt
follow the examples of ſuch
as are gone before. I. Cor.
11. 1.
            4 Let our reioycing be
euen the teſtimonie of our good
conſcience, that in ſimplicitie
and Godly pureneſſe, though
not in perfection, yet not in
fleſhly wiſedome, but by the

grace of God, wee haue had our
conuerſation in the world, and
eſpecially where we haue had an
eſpecial calling. 2. Cor. 1. 12. 13.
            5 Let it comfort vs againſt
infirmities, and Sathans
buffetings, that the
ſame God which hath begun
the worke will perfect it in vs.
1. Phil. 6.
            6 Let vs alſo giue God
the glorie of al his mercies,
though to vs wee confeſſe
alſo there is nothing due
but ſhame and confuſion of
face for euer Dan. 9.
            And ſeeing as with the
heart we beleeue to righteouſnes,
ſo with the mouth
wee confeſſe to ſaluation.
Rom. 10. Therefore be wee
wiſe to diſtinquiſh of ſpirituall
duties: ſo being priuate

with God, that we doe nothing
whereof before men
we may be aſhamed?
            And ſo behauing our
ſelues in the publike worſhip,
as that we do all things
as in the preſence of God;
both preparing our ſelues
to the publike by priuate
humiliation: and after trying
and ſanctifying the publike
by priuate meditation
and conference with God.
            Thus doth the hypocrite
boaſt of what is not in him:
that ſo he may, vpon pretence
of what is not in him,
more dangerouſly deceiue
himſelfe, and others; But
what? hath hee nothing at
all? Yea ſurely; we haue before
allowed him ſome
wrong poſſeſſion of many

excellēt bleſſings: yea ſome
abuſe thereof.
            But are theſe ſufficient to
make him happie? Surely
no: They (as you haue
heard) tend to make him inexcuſable,
that hee may be
beaten with more ſtripes, becauſe
hee knowes his Maiſters
will and doth it not, becauſe to
whom much is giuen, much
ſhalbe required at his hands.Rom. 2. 1.
               Math. 2. Luk. 12. 48.
            Yea, but for all this, doth
hee not deſire to be happie?
Yea ſurely: hee hath ſome
knowledge of the true ende,
ſome deſire thereof. And
hee hath a price in his hand:
yet ſuch a foole hee is, that
he hath no heart to buy it,
hee ſees a future happines,
and he would be thought to

chaffer for it, Luk. 18. yet in
truth the Bird in the hand is
the prize hee meanes to enioy:
his belly is his God, his
credit his Idoll: Phil. 3. 19.
And therefore though hee
haue many notable graces,
which might (being rightly
vſed) further him to the beſt:
and ſo by them, to the true
ende; yet in his beſt wiſdom
he is content ſo farre to vſe
them,Note, as thereby to nouriſh
his deceiued heart, that hee
hath ſome reach to the happineſſe
of a better life: And
yet to make them his maine
brokers, to enioy the happines
of this life.
            And how doth he bring
this about? ſurely by that 2.
propertie, which now followeth.
Euen by ouerrating the

bleſſings which hee hath vſurped,
eſteeming them to
the ſanctifying graces of the ſpirite,
ſufficient to ſaluation;
when indeede they are but
giftes of illumination, tending
by his abuſe, to his further
condemnation.
            Behold here then a ſecond
propertie of the hypocrite,4. Hipocrit
                     •
                   ouerrates the bleſſings of God, As knowledge.
Namely, to ouerprize and ſet
vpon the Tentors, ſuch bleſſings
as he hath vſurped vpon.
Thus hauing ſome knowledge,
he is puffed vp therwith,
eſteeming that hee knowes
ſufficiently, when he indeed
knowes nothing as hee ought to
know, 1. Cor. 8. ſtinting himſelfe
in the meanes of Religion,
and condemning other
that will not be meaſured by
his line, as giddy ſpirits, mad

fellowes, &c. 2. Cor. 10.
            Thus hauing a temporary
faith, he makes it more then
it is,Meanes wherby the hypocrite deceiueth himſelfe. contenting himſelfe to
beleeue in generall, though he
haue no particular holde of
the promiſes, no aſſurance of
ſaluation, eſteeming this, preſumption,
the other,Popiſh faith 
               modeſtie, and
humilitie: Or, if he haue
any holde,In temporary faith. yet letting it eaſily
goe, when once his carnall
proppes faile, and affliction
ouertakes him, Luk. 8.
            Thus performing ſome
outward deuotions, he eſteemeth
them meritorious and
warrātable for ſaluation,In externall obedience. vpon
pretence, that they muſt
needs proceed from a good
meaning, and ſo an honeſt
hart, or elſe vpon this aduantage,
that his heart is onely
knowne to God, Ierem. 17. 10.

hee cannot iudge of it himſelfe:
and why then may
he not meaſure himſelfe by
outward actions? At leaſt,
whatſoeuer hee knowes by
himſelf, yet why ſhould not
you take him in charitie, according
to his outward practiſe
and ſemblance. Math.
26. Eſpecially, if he continue,
and hold on his profeſſion,
as Iudas did,In formall conſtancie. till the very
ende, may not this be a
meanes, that hee ſhall bleſſe
his ſoule therin? 
                  •
               . Hath not
he ſtood whē others are fallen?Reaſons.
2. Hath he not obtained
theſe Graces from the right
meanes? 3. Hath hee not by
them be
                  •
               e a meanes to doe
good to others? 4. Doth hee
not increaſe in knowledge,
and goe on in many notable

duties. 5. And are not the
beſt ſubjects to many ſlips?
            Adde wee hereunto, the
pollicie of Sathan, to further
this ouerpriſing of the bleſſings
of God. That whereas
indeed the drift is, to abuſe
them to be Bawdes for preſent
pleaſures, & ſo to ab
                     •
                  ſe
and vnderrate the ſame,Note. that
we ſhould not eſteeme them
as the good giftes of God,
but rather ſuch as come by
chance, or our owne trauell.
Iob. 21. 16. that wee ſhould
thinke them not worth our
retaining, when for the further
enioying of the pleaſures
of ſinne, we ſhalbe willing
to part with them: Yet
that wee might not diſcerne
this our baſe account of thē:
It is the ſubtiltie of this olde

Serpent, that we ſhould thus
cōceiue more of them, then
indeede they are: that ſo
pride of Conceite may hinder
the right vſe: and blinde the
falſe, and thereby keepe vs
from deſiring, and enioying
better.
            
            1. Abuſing to this end both
the charity of others,
               Furtherā
                  
                     ••
                   hereto. who are
willing to conceiue the beſt
of what they ſee, and knowe
not to the contrary.
            2. Abuſing alſo the flattery
of the Worlde, who is ready
to make the moſt of euery
thing, that ſo it may holde
vs ſtill captiues to the luſtes
thereof.
            3. Eſpecially abuſing our
owne ſelfe-loue, which is eaſily
blinded in the iudgment of
it ſelfe: and our ſecret deſires,
               
and luſts,4 which tending to
enioy the pleaſures of ſinne,
or by this ouerweening conceit
much warranted and encreaſed
thereto.
            Aboue all, the Iuſtice of
the Allwiſe and mighty God appeareth
we 
                  〈◊〉
                fully herein:
who hauing (as a iudgement
of his deceitfu
                  •
               nes) ordained
the Hypocrite to greater
condemnation, dooth
therefore ſo farre giue him
his deſire and portion in this
life, Pſal 1
                  •
               . 
                  •
               4. that whereas
he aff
                  ••
               cteth ſome meanes,
and ſhew of religion to this
ende, as tending to hide and
colour ſinne, that it may be
committed more greedily, &
more impudently maintained:
hee ſhall therefore be partaker
of ſuch a meaſure thereof,

which though it be not
ſufficiēt to bring him to the
true happineſſe, yet ſhall it
prooue very daungerous to
nuzzle in the falſe, and ſo to
leade him on more ſecurely
to vengeance, and that eſpecially,
by ouerprizing, and,
too high eſteeme thereof.
            For hereby concluding that
he is in ye
                right, he doth not
only deſpiſe and condemne
all further meaſure, but finding
them to ſtand with, and
further his preſent enioying
of the pleaſures of ſinne, he
growes to ſacrifice to his Net,
and make Idols of his gifts,
now keeping ſtate with them:
and extending them rather
to ſhewe, and outward pompe,
then any whit husbāding or
employing ye
                ſame. Mat. 25.

By which it commeth to
paſſe, that not exerciſing his
Talents, the Lord purpoſeth
to ſtrippe him thereof, and
yet not vntill the hypocrite
be moſt willing thereunto.
And to make him willing,Note.
ſerues very iuſtly the maine
abuſe of his gifts, which
wounding his conſcience,
and ſo labouring his reformation,
he is ſo farre from
anſwering the Lord herein:
As that rather then he will
endure this ſcourge, he is
contented to part with knowledge,
yea to be rid of conſcience,
yea all ſenſe of diuine
power, that ſo he may enioy
his pleaſures more ſecurely
without controulement. By
which as hee makes vp the
meaſure of his ſin, ſo he haſtens
vpon himſelfe a greater

meaſure of condemnation.
Loe here the confuſion
of the hypocrites wiſedom.
Behold the wicked taken in
their owne craftines.
            And Learne we hence in
Gods feare to ſuſpect and
trie our ſelues.
            Are wee giuen to make
Molehils Mountaines?Vſe of Triall. to
ouerpriſe the bleſſings of
God beſtowed vpon vs? certainely,
as it is a ſinne to diminiſh
any good bleſſing of
God: & a greater euill to depraue,
& diſgrace the ſame:
ſeeing the leaſt we are not
worthie of; and he that is
faithful in a little and thankfull
for it, ſhall be entruſted
with greater bleſſings.
So on the contrarie: It is
a dangerous euill, to ouervalue
any fauour of God;
            
               
Eſpecially, ſeeing howſoeuer
euery bleſſing of God is
good, and as a hand to leade
vs to the greateſt good: Yet
the difference of Bleſſings,Difference of bleſsings how to be diſcerned. is
both in regard of the diuerſe
perſons, that doe enioy them,
but moſt of all, the right vſe
of the bleſſing giues the true
rate thereunto, as yeelding
vs in the ſound comfort the
iuſt valuatiō therof. So that,
as to the Impure, all things are
Impure, becauſe the conſcience
being deſiled, they can
not but be abuſed, and therfore
the beſt to the wicked,
(in regarde of themſelues)
doth but further condemnation,
and ſo to them looſeth
it worth and value: So vnto
the elect, the leaſt being ſanctified,
as it ſhall further to

nying, the beſt, ſo it cannot be too
highly eſteemed in regard
of the Giuer, and the more
highly we eſteeme thereof,
the more ſhall wee be prouoked
to a more conſcionable
vſe, the more enabled to
thankefulnes vnto our God,
and ſo ſtill prepared to further
bleſſings; & ſo at length
made fit for eternall happines.
            2 Labour wee therefore
in the next place, to trie our
eſtate, not ſo much by the
enioying of the bleſſing, as
by the right vſe thereof. So
may wee lawfully aduance
the bleſſing; In that it is not
wholy defiled by our corruption,
and we iuſtly depriued
of it: And yet abaſe our
ſelues, in regard of our great
infirmities, accompanying

the beſt vſe of Gods
mercies ſufficiēt,

                     •
                  o. Math. 24. if the Lord
ſhould enter into iudgment
with vs, not onely to corrupt
the bleſſings vtterly, and ſo
make vs vnprofitable ſeruāts:
But, as vnprofitable ſeruants
to be ſtripped thereof, and
to be depriued of all further
hope to enioy the ſame.
            3 And labour we to diſcerne
the cunning of Sathan,
who indeede, by this ouerrating
of Gods mercies, procureth
their abaſing, that
ſo we may not be deceiued
with his glorious pretences,
that we may ſuſpect him and
his moſt when they moſt
flatter vs.
            4 Laſtly, ſeeing it is ſo
dangerous to ouerprize the
mercies of God, therefore
learne wee to preuent this

practiſe of the hypocrite.
And ſo to keepe our ſelues
in an holy vſe of Gods bleſſings,
there by to prepare our
ſelues to the continuance
and increaſe of them.
            To this end be we carefull
not to haue ſuch conceite,How to preuēt Sathans policie herein.
or giue ſuch Epithite vnto
any bleſſings of God, as are
proper attributes to his Maieſtie
as perfectly good, mightie,
&c. which yet are ordinarie
in our communion
ſpeech, vnleſſe the circumſtances
and maner of ſpeech
doe reſtraine within the true
compaſſe.
            2 Neither let vs abſolutely
meaſure the cōſtant goodneſſe
of our gracious God
by any of them: as if we beleeued
not more, then wee
felt, or expected not more

then we for the preſent enioyed:
perſwading our ſelues
euen for the preſent, that
though the prouidence of
God be ſubordinate vnto
meanes, yet to tye Gods
prouidence abſolutely to
them, is to make any Idoll
of the meanes; and an Idoll
of God: and therefore, if we
haue meanes,Note. let vs ſo vſe
them, as that by truſting in
them, we doe not ouerrate
them: if we haue no meanes,
yet let vs not diſtruſt our
God, leaſt we vnderrate his
power and freedome in gouernment.
Pſ. 62. 10. Rom. 4.
            3 And ſeeing the true
eſtimate of the bleſſing, proceedes
from the Acceptance
of the perſon, and his right vſe
thereof: therefore, let vs not
flatter our ſelues, either becauſe

we haue ſuch and ſuch
aboue others; therefore we
may now highly eſteeme of
our ſelues, and gifts: But rather
labour we in the feare
of God to haue the teſtimonie
of the acceptance of our
perſons: that ſo wee may
haue comfort in the acceptance
of the bleſſing: And
from the comfort of acceptance,
ground we the right
vſe, and by the vſe meaſur
                  •
               
we ſo the worth of the bleſſing:
as that wee then diſcerne
it beſt when we ſee
our vnworthines moſt in
the vſe thereof.
            4 Laſtly, faſten we ſtedſted
faſtly vpon the merite of
Chriſt, and looke we in him,
vnto the recompence of the reward:
and ſo ſhall we preuent
all ouerrating of preſent

bleſſings: as finding them
to be ſwallowed vp in theſe
bottom leſſe fountaines, and
boundles Oceans of eternall
happines. Hebr. 11. 26. 1.
Ioh. 
                  •
               . 
                  •
               .
            Well, Thus we haue now
diſcerned two properties of
an hypocrite, euen in this,
that he makes himſelf Rich:
Either hee boaſts of that
which is not in him at all, or
elſe, what he hath, he ſets vpon
the Tenters; making it the
worſe for vſe, by how much it
is more in ſhew, and ſo neceſſarily
abuſing the ſame to his
further condemnation.
            
            Shall we now conſider further
the reaſon of all this:
The holy Ghoſt reſolues vs
he Makes himſelfe rich, he is
not made rich; receiuing
Gods bleſſings in mercie,

but he makes himſelfe rich,
vſurping, and encroaching
vpon the bleſſings of God:
whatſoeuer is lent him, for ye
               
good of others, he claimes
proprietie as to his owne,
yea he pretends ſingularitie;
As whoſoeuer were poore,
yet he is rich, none rich to
him, he is more holy then
any. Behold here then two
further properties of an hypocrite,
whereby he makes
himſelfe rich. And in the
feare of God, let vs trie our
ſelues by them.
            Firſt, He makes himſelfe
rich, That is, though he haue
no power of true riches, nor
any right vſe of them; yet he
makes himſelfe rich of that
he hath no right in.
            
               An Hypocrite is an vſurper
and encroacher vpon the

bleſſings of God:
                  
                     •
                  4. Propertie of an hypocrite, an intruder vpon Gods bleſſings. though he
haue them, yet be hath no
right in them, they are not
freely giuen, but lent vnto
him,Reaſons. 2. he muſt pay the vtmoſt
farthing for the abuſe of
them. 1. They are for others
good, and not his owne, he
hath them in anger, and not
in mercie, 2 he is not of Gods
houſhould, and therefore an
Intruder himſelfe, and how
can he then but intrude vpon
the bleſſings of God? 3.
he comes in at the window
& not at the true dore, Ioh. 10
And therefore he ſhall one
day be indited of forcible entrance:
Friend how commeſt
thou in hither? thou haſt no
right in this buſines, It is
not for Tobiah, but for the
true Iſraelite to build the
houſe of the Lord: And doth

not his manner of building
proue him no leſſe? doth he
not build with vntempered
morter? doth he not plucke
downe with the one hand, what
he hath built with the other?
Is not his building the tower
of Babell, to outface heauen,
& confound himſelf? Gen

            Learne we hence,Vſe. 1. not to
enuie at the glory of an hypocrite?
Are his feathers
his owne? when each ſhall
require his owne, will not his
Nakednes, be his ſhame,
though himſelfe cannot be
aſhamed of it? whē the Lord
takes away his bleſſings, becauſe
they are abuſed, when
the world withdrawes her applauſe,
becauſe ſhe is inconſtant:
when the conſcience recouers
her feeling, being reuiued

by diuine iuſtice; whē
hell ſhall gape on him being
inlarged by his deluſions:
ſhall he not now be turnd
out naked, into euerlaſting
vengeance? ſhal not the God
of this world that great vſurper,
and enuier of the diuine
power, by his limited authoritie
ſeaze vpō this vſurper,
And haile him, to moſt
boundleſſe, and endleſſe torments?

            2 Learne we here therfore
in ye
                feare of God, to trie our
ſelues whether we be vſurpers
of Gods bleſſings or no.How we may trie and preuent vſurpation.

               Doeſt thou ſtand vpon thy

               merite: & not the mercy of
thy God? 4. Doſt thou pretēd
natures priuiledge, and not
hold of grace? 5. Doeſt not
thou daily renue thy right in
Chriſt, and hold wholy and
entirely of him? Doeſt thou
not renounce thy ſelfe to be iuſtified
thereby, though thou
knoweſt nothing by thy
ſelfe, 1 Cor. 4. 4. 5. that ſtill
thou maiſt be found in Chriſt
not hauing thine owne righteouſnes?
6. Doeſt thou not
ſtill liue by faith in the ſonne
of God, Gal. 2. 20. ſo vſing
preſent, as that thou forgetteſt
them, in compariſon of
what is to come? 7. Doeſt
thou not ſo enioy the bleſſings
of the God, as that like
a feeling member thou communicates
them to others? Luk.

               ſtrengthen thy brethren and

daily, by renued repentance?

               cing
the world, & dying daily
to it; 1. Cor. 15. hungring
after Chriſt Ieſus, that thou
maiſt enioy his glorious
preſence? Surely if theſe
things be not in thee & aboūd
2. Pet. thou art no better thē
a thiefe and a robber: thou
ſhalt one day be ſpoyled, becauſe
thou haſt ſpoyled others:
Thou haſt robbed
God of his glorie, & thy ſelfe of
the true vſe, & comfort of his
bleſſings, thou haſt beene
ſtraight hāded to thy poore breth
                  •••
               ,
in not cōmunicating

vnto them. And therefore
the Lorde will ſtrippe thee
thou glorious ſepulcher: thy
skirts ſhall be diſcouered, and
filthie nakedneſſe proclaimed,
yea, thine owne tongue,
and wiſedome ſhall fall vpon
thee. Iſay. 47. Pſal. 64.
            3 And therefore, ſeeing it is
ſo dangerous to be an vſurper:
learne we in the Name
of God to preuent this great
euill: As firſt,
            1. Diſclaime we Nature,
and all the painted ſhewes
thereof. 2. And labour we to
renue our right alone in Ieſus
Chriſt: 3. That we may finde
him, let vs ſeeke him in his
owne ordinance. 4. And that
we may ſeeke him aright: let
vs ſeeke him by Faith. 5. Hauing

                the Lord IESVS,
               
let vs labour to be found in
him: denying our ſelues by
vnfained repentance. 6. Let
vs renue our repenatāce, that
we may renue the euidēce of
our right in CHRIST: that
ſo we may be renued to a further
vſe, and increaſe of all
his meanes, 7. Caſting away
to this ende euery thing that
preſſeth downe: and vſing
the world, as if thou vſedſt it
not, 8. And ſo labouring after
the beſt graces, that thou
art ſtill contented to be abaſed,
that God may haue the
glorie, preferring the ſame
euen before thine owne ſaluation.
Hereby thou ſhalt
approoue thy right in Gods
mercies: by this thou ſhalt
preuent all intruſion, and vſurpation
of the ſame. Rom. I.

let it comfort vs, that
as we haue a right in all,

haue ſhall be better then

And rather then faile, whatſoeuer
the hypocrite hath,

prooue himſelfe to be

in nothing, yet hee thinkes

others haue, yet he is
rich, he wants nothing: Nay
in compariſon of him, all others
are but Beggers, prophane

So did the Phariſies, thoſe

dooth the Hypocrite make
himſelfe rich. Wherein,
marke (I pray you) the particulars
of this ſingularitie, &
ground thereof: that ſo wee
may diſtinguiſh betweene
things that differ, & learne ſo
to maintain the bond of cō

thoſe accurſed, that are not
of his Laſt, to cōdemne ſuch
as haue not attained, or will
not be ſtinted by his meſure,
and in the feare of God let vs
trie our ſelues:
               1 for this peremptory
iudging cōuinces vs to be

feare,By peremptory iudging. that while wee thus exclude

                enquiry,
& the iſſue is, Goe, take him
forth, & caſt him, &c. Mat. 22
            2. Conſider we the particulars
of this ſingularity,
               By vnneceſſary ſeparation. he will
not waſh with the publican,
he will not eate with him, he
wil not cōmunicate with him,
no not in ciuil occaſiōs. Certainly,

if it were in our choice,
to ſort our ſelues, this were
not amiſſe: In priuate where
we haue power, to haue ſuch
nere cōmunication with groſſe
& opē ſinners, is an abuſe of
holy liberty. The mā of God
wold not endure this, Pſ. 101
& 119. But here we muſt be
wiſe, only to iudge by the outward
appearance, & the preſent
time, as for the har
                     •
                  , or ſtate of
the perſon, in the purpoſe of the
Almighty, theſe two only belong
to the abſolute, allwiſe, &
allſeeing God. And therfore we
muſt bee able ſo to diſcerne
of the preſent ſtate, ſo to tēder
the ſame, as that the more
apparant and dangerous the
ſinne is, becauſe now there
is moſt neede, we muſt not
faile to prouoke to repentāce.
            
            
               
And here we muſt alſo be
patient towards euill men, bearing
with them wiſely, and
raiſing them vp with the ſpirite
of meekneſſe, ſo long as
they will endure to be handled
and launced of vs. And
yet in our launcing and ſearing,
wee muſt be exceeding
carefull, that we neither take
away any but the dead fleſh.
And that wee take it away
tenderly, euen by degrees,
leaſt Nature being deſirous
to thruſte out her Enemie,
thruſt out her ſelfe: and the
conſcience beeing humbled
for ſinne, bee fainted in caſting
it out: Oh where is a
Friend found, but in the day
of aduerſitie? And therefore
howſoeuer, wee may not admit
ſuch to our boſomes:

Yet in the Name of God, let
them come to our oratories,
let them be partakers of our
prayers, though yet wee may
not admit them to our Tables:
faile we not to counſaile
them, though yet wee may
not comfort them.
            
            And therefore though we
are to denie them the ſeales
of mercie, leaſt they ſhould
bee puffed vp before the
time, as being admitted to
the Feaſt, before they haue
on their wedding garment.
Yet are wee to bring them,
yea wee may ſafely compell
them to come to the wedding,
and to take hold of the
Key of mercie, the preaching
of the Goſpell, that ſo their
hearts may be gaged & opened
to repentance. Math. 22

bee glorified in accompliſhing
hereby his worke, as wel
for the greater condemnation
of the wicked, that are now
made more inexcuſable, as for
the furtherance of his Childrens
happineſſe, by trying
their Faith and Patience, by
exerciſing their Wiſedome, in
this communion with the
wicked?
            Well, who ſo is wiſe ſhall
vnderſtand theſe things, and
to whō the arme of the Lord
ſhall reueale them. But as
for the Hypocrite, theſe
things are hidden from him:
Luke, 19. 41. 42. Iohn, 9. Hee
is ordained to cōdemnation

and yet muſt flatter himſelfe,
that hee is in the right
way: yea, rather then he will
not chuſe the right, hee will
goe alone, and ſeeme to
outrun all, hee forſakes the
ſocietie, leaſt it ſhould ſtaye
him in his courſe: And ſo he
makes himſelfe rich, in ſingularitie
and ſeparation.
            And thus haue we a little
traced the hypocrite in this
myſterie of iniquitie: Thus
whiles hee makes himſelfe
rich, in pretending to outrunne
others, he outrunnes
Gods ordinances, and ſo loſeth
himſelfe. And theſe are
the ends of all his masking,
he would not ſeeme what he
is, but rather, what he is not,
and ſo deceiues himſelfe. And
by his glorious ſhewes hee

               deceiues others: drawing Diſciples
after him, and making
them two-fold more
the children of hell then
they were before: As furniſhing
them with meanes to
commit ſinne more greedily,
and yet to hide it more
cunningly, that ſo being
made more inexcuſable, and
abuſing great bleſſings, they
may be beaten with many
ſtripes. 2. Tim. 3. 13.
            Whereby we learne,Vſe. as to
preuent and auoyd ſingularitie,
1. by ſuſpending our iudgment
of others,
               How to preuent fin
                     •
                   gularitie. 2. & iudging our
ſelue, 3. by labouring eſpecially
after the power of Godlines,
4. and meaſuring the
ſame, by truth in the inward
parts. So hereby to trie our
ſelues, whether we be tainted

with this leauen of the Phariſie
or no. And to order & guide
our ſelues wiſely in theſe euill
daies, that we may maintaine
the vnitie of the ſpirit in
the bond of peace. Epheſ. 4.
            To this end, be we wiſe to
obſerue the policies of the hypocrite
in making himſelfe
rich: as alſo carefully to diſcerne
the ends of this policie.
            And here, let vs not forget
in the firſt place, that the
ground of this policie, is not
ſo much to attaine to any
ſubſtance of riches, as rather
to conceale his pouertie frō
himſelfe, and others. To this
end, howſoeuer he will admit
the letter of knowledge,
               Math. 5.
yet he cannot abide the ſpirituall
power and application

thereof, to ſearch his inward
corruption And hence it
is ye
                he will acknowledge no
more then what is broken out
into Act. And herein alſo he
is growne ſo wiſe, as to take
notice of no more, then the
world diſcernes. And that he
may ſeeme to be perfect, or
at leaſt, not be ſhamed: he
will labour to hide, euen what
the world apprehends. And
to his purpoſe he hath many
fetches according to the
diuine Iuſtice meeting with
him in his wiſedome, and
confounding the ſame.
            As firſt, becauſe he boaſts
of the pride of the holy mountaine,
               How the Hypocrite hides his vilenes.
and will ſtill haue religion
to be his cloake to hide
ſinne. Therefore doth the
Lord according to his deſire

offer him ſuch deceiuers as
may now wilfully blinde
him. And thus he heapeth vp
teachers according to his owne
luſts, 2. Tim. 4. 2. which may
not onely helpe to excuſe, &
diminiſh ſinne, crying peace,
peace, God is mercifull: what
need this ſtrictnes, haue not
all their infirmities: but may
further alſo cry ayme to his
luſts, prophecying of new
wine & ſtrong drinke, yea promiſing
conſtancie and ſecuritie
in this belly happines,
to morrow ſhall be as to day, and
much more abundant. Mich. 2.
Eſay. 56. Ierem. 6.
            And if now it ſhall ſo fall
out that the Lord ſhall make
ſuch deceiuers vile before the
people, Malach. 2. giuing vp
to groſſe wickednes, to their

iuſt reproach before men
that thus abaſe the ordinances
of God to the ſatisfying
of their luſts:Amos. 7. So that now
the Prophet ſhall be come
an example of his owne looſe
and corrupt doctrine: Oh
what a warrant, proues this
to the hypocrites licentiouſnes?
haue not they knowledge?
are not they my
guides? if I do as they ſay;
Nay what they ſay, they confirme
by practiſe; may not
I ſafely imitate the ſame? behold
here another meanes,
wherby the hypocrite iuſtifie
himſelfe.
            And yet that his confuſion
may be the greater, euen
wherein hee affects perfection:
Behold a further degree
of Gods Iuſtice, in giuing

him to this policie, that
he which can deuice ſtarting
holes for himſelfe to breake
out into all licentiouſnes;
yet to colour his vilenes,Note. he
muſt now put on a face of
ſeueritie and ſtrictnes againſt
others: not onely reſtraining
them wherein himſelfe
takes libertie, as if he
had ſome priuiledge to ſinne, or
could more command repentance,
but whiſpering
many times in their care,Math. 2.
that they muſt do as he ſaith
& not as he doth: Thus doth
he further hide his owne nakednes,
by reprouing others,
and by looking too
much abroad, he becomes
ſtarke blind at home. And if
now in looking abroad, he
can ſtumble at ſome ſtrawe,
finding ſomewhat amiſſe,

though he haue no calling
to amend it, or at leaſt haue
greater reaſon to ſee the
good he enioyes, and ſo in
thankefulnes to vſe ye
                good,
mourning ſo for the euill,
that he maintaine the peace
of the Church. Oh what a
further occaſion, doth this
proue not onely to hide his
former nakednes, but much
more to enrage and increaſe
the ſame: ſo iuſt is the Lord
to confound him in his policies;
ſo merciful vnto his
Church to make him a Phiſitian
to the ſame: Now muſt
he be accounted the onely
zealous man that can cry
out againſt abuſes? Now
muſt he hide his owne nakednes,
by clamouring againſt
the nakednes of his
betters: Now perſonall abuſes

muſt be imputed to the
callings: & the abuſe of the
calling, muſt neceſſary chalenge
the goodnes thereof.
            And if now he can proue
ſo happie,Act. 4. as to draw diſciples
after him, becauſe the multitude
is apt to affect nouelties,
and eſpecially through
enuie growes diſcontēt with
ſuperiours,Rich in followers. that ſo he may
become a leader of a Factiō,
and haue the multitude to
iuſtifie what himſelfe ſhall
practiſe: will not this be a
further meanes to hide ſin?
Nay wil not this giue occaſion
to broach new Opinions,
that ſo his followers being
ſtill entertained with more
matter, might leſſe looke
vnto the nakednes of their
leader, might more admire,

and ſo be dazeled with his
rough garment. I meane
pretence of zeale, & further
illumination?Practiſe of the Anabaptiſt. will not this
proue a notable meanes to
aduance our hypocrite in
the hearts of theſe deceiued
people, euen aboue all that
is called God? Eſpecially, if
we ſhall conſider, a further
policie of Sathan, namely,
vnder pretence of reformation
to make way for further
libertie in the fleſh, by hoping
to make ſpoyle of
the fat offals of poperie (A
ſhrewd ſpurre to our carnall
Reformers) and further vnder
pretence of this open
ſtrictnes, to claime priuiledge
for ſecret looſenes,
eſpecially vnder colour of
wilfull pouertie, to broake

for couetouſnes, for ye
                maintenance
of the fleſh; can
the hypocrite deſire more
then to haue the glorie of a
Reformer. And yet make his
belly his God, that his glory
may be his ſhame. And yet
that he may keepe his diſciples
in awe.
            Adde we hereunto, that
other ſtratagem of the hypocrite,
namely, to lay grieuous
burthens on others,Math. 23.
which he will not himſelfe
touch with his little finger,
ſo promiſing libertie, as that
it ſhall proue the greateſt
bondage: as being iealous
to looſe his traine which he
onely reſerues to make bootie
of. Oh they muſt not
be free to trie all things,
to trie the ſpirits, but they

muſt ſweare to the Iudgement
of their Oracle,Practiſe of the Ieſuite. and
ſeeke after no other:Gal. 4. he is
iealous ouer thine amiſſe,
euen to exclude them that
they ſhould loue none but
him. Him onely they muſt
follow in his iudgement,
though they muſt not follow
him in his practiſe: nay
though he euery day varie
in his Iudgement,And Seperatiſt Smith. according
to the gift of Illumination:
Yet they muſt alter with
him, though it be frō worſe
to worſe, yea rather then he
muſt want, they muſt be
wholy emptied; if he do but
cenſure, they muſt tremble
and ſubmit, though it be
contrarie to the word, yea
contrarie to himſelfe. In a
word, they muſt be meere
ſlaues and bauds to his luſts

enduring to be brought into
bondage,
               Cor. 11. 
               yea ſmitten on the

highly graced as ſuffering

Behold the bondage of the

therein obſerue the riches
of the hypocrite, how he
makes himſelfe rich in enthralling
the poore conſcience?
oh how triumpheth
by this meanes in the fleſh
of his deceiued followers?
            And if now he canne further
yet get this ſtart of thē,
as to make them, through
his owne inconſtancie of
opinion, vpon pretence of
new reuelations, now to
ſtagger in their iudgement,
& ſo apt to be carried about
with euery blaſt of vaine

Doctrine, as heereby they
muſt neceſſarily be brought
to ſeeke of their eſtates, and
ſo to pinne them wholly vpon
his ſleeue: how doth hee
by this meanes now tyrannize
ouer their conſciences?
How doth he ſpoyle & empty
them at his pleaſure? Muſt
they not now, though hee
ſhould call in queſtion their
ſaluation, yet yeelde vnto it?
And will they not be willing
to giue euen the firſt fruit of
their bodie for the ſinne of
their ſoule? What ſhall be
too deare to obtaine a good
looke, ſome faire worde to
make ſuch fools faine? doth
not the Hypocrite heere aduance
himſelf aboue all that
is called God, preſuming to
ſhut and open Heauen at his

preſūption to let in, & thruſt
out, whom he pleaſeth? Is
not this his chiefeſt treaſury
wherby he preuails with all?
Is he not eſpecially rich by
this preſumption, to binde
and looſe at his luſt? Doeth
he not hereby promiſe ſecuritie
of his happineſſe vnto
himſelfe? Doth he not now
reſolue that he ſits as a queen,
and ſhal neuer be remoued?
Reuel. 
                  •
               8. Eſay, 47.
            And is not this preſumptuous
vſurping of the power
of God: a iuſt occaſion to
prouoke the Lord to fight againſt
him, and to giue him
vp wholly to a further deluſion;
euen to fall to further
preſumption in ſinne, that
ſo the Lord may not be mercifull
vnto him? Doth not

this ſecuritie giue the bridle
vnto ſinne? Is not the meaſure
of ſinne heereby made
vp? And doth not the vengeance
hang ouer his head?
But can the Hypocrite diſcerne
the plague? No ſurely:
The god of this worlde
doth yet further blind him:
He ſtill ſayes he is rich, and
wanteth nothing: For can
he want ſo long as God hath
mercie? Hath hee not had
good experience? And can
the Lord faile him? ſhall not
all things turn to the further
aduancement of the mercies
of God? And may hee not
therefore ſinne, that grace
may abound? Rom. 6. And
though he doe continue in
ſinne, can God forget to be
mercifull? Thus doth the

Iuſt Lord giue vp the Hypocrite
to preſumption, on his
mercies, as a iuſt puniſhmēt
of his preſumptuous intruding
into his abſolute ſoueraigntie.
And thus is now
the Hypocrite onely rich in
preſumption: hee ſowes the
winde, and muſt neceſſarily
reape the whirlewinde. For,
ſhall not the Iealouſie of the
Lord break out againſt ſuch
preſumptuous ſinners, that
in vaine doe flatter themſelues
in their iniquitie? ſhall
they not at length be found
out in their moneth? ſhall
not their iniquitie appeare
worthie to be hated of God
and men? Ierem. 2. Pſal. 36.
4. 5. Surely, the Lord will
not bee mercifull vnto him,
that thus
                  •
                addeth drunkēnes

vnto Thirſt, bleſſing his
ſoule, that he ſhal haue peace
though hee walke after the
ſtubbornneſſe of his heart:
Deuter. 29. 18. 19. Though
hee hath a long time helde
his peace, yet will hee cric
like a Trauelling woman, he
will deſtroy and deuoure at
once: Iſay, 42. 15. And yet
ſee a further power of deluſion:
My Maiſter hath deferred
his coming; Matth 24.
1. Pet. 3. 4. And therefore
where is the promiſe of his
comming (ſaith the Hypocrite?)
And thus dooth he
make himſelf further rich, in
abuſing Gods patiēce. Thus
doth hee open his mouth againſt
Heauen, and defie the
Iuſtice of the Lorde,Abuſe of Gods patience. that
whereas the Lorde in great

as are appointed to greateſt
cōdemnation: Doth not
the wicked abuſe this patience,
to the nouriſhing and
defence of his preſūption?
Is hee plagued like other
men? Hath not he bene ſpared
when others haue ſmarted?
Pſal. 73. and therefore
doth not the Lord loue him?
Nay, is he not more righteous
then others? And if now
this patience of the Almightie,
               Abuſe of Proſperitie.
ſhalbe a means of the continuance
& encreaſe of his proſperitie,
doth not this further
encreaſe this deluſiō? would
the Lord ſo bleſſe him, if he did
not loue him: If his paths were
not acceptable, could he ſo
waſh his feete in butter? could
he ſo abound and encreaſe?
            And hath not Sathan yet a

further meanes to encreaſe
this deluſion? yea ſurely, the
proſperitie of fooles ſhall prooue
their deſtruction: Pro. 1. The
more the Hipocrite enioyes
the pleaſures of ſin, the leſſe
dooth hee thinke of GOD as he
ſhuld: the more doth hee
cōceiue baſely of him. And
becauſe the Lorde holdes his
peace, therfore doth he conceiue,
that either the Lorde
ſees not, & ſo denies his prouidence,
or els he will neither
do good nor eull: & ſo denies
his Iuſtice: or els he is like vn
to him, he likes of his ſin, &
ſo denies & depraues his goodnes.
But will the Lord take this
at the hypocrites hāds? Surely
no: Behold, becauſe whē he
knows God, ſeeing he will not
glorifie him as God, therefore
ſhall he be giuē up to are probate

ſence: Euē to call Light darknes,
& darknes light: Iſay, 5. 19.
Iſay, 3

               . 3. Flattering himſelfe
hereby in his Iniquitie,
though hee commit it with
greedines, and bleſſing his
ſoule herein, as a great purchaſe,
that now his conſcience
can excuſe for ſinne,
that ſo with authoritie hee
may more ſecurely reuell
therein. And thus through
cuſtome of ſin, his deceiued
conſcience becoms at lēgth
paſt feeling: And this proues a
further
                  •
                occaſion to encreaſe
this deluſion, that now his
eſtate is good, All is well
with him: ſeeing the Byrde
in the boſome hath loſt her
tongue, the dead Conſcience
ſayes nothing to the contrarie.
            
               
And if now all being huſht
at home, the crie ſhall goe
well abroade, the world ſhall
ſo flatter the Hypocrite, becauſe
hee ſawnes vpon it:
doth he not make himſelfe
rich with the words of men?
Is not his caſe good, ſeeing
all ſpeake well of him?
            And ſay that ſome in the
world will not be meaſured
by his line, ſay that his holines
is confounded by ſome
one in a Citie, or two in a
Tribe, ſome rare Byrds that
the world knowes not, and is
not worthie of; Yet ſhall not
this any whit take downe the
conceit of his Riches: his
eſtate is yet good enough,
though hee cannot attaine
vnto them: For why?
            Doth not God beſtow his

graces diuerſly, to ſom one, to
ſome fiue talents, & yet he that
hath but one, hath therof ſufficiēt:
wil God require any more
at his hands then he giueth?
            
            May not the prime times
require greater ſtrictnes thē
thoſe that come after, wil not
a leſſe meaſure ſerue at one
time, then at an other? May
not leſſe be required of him
then of other men?
            Nay, hath he not more reaſon
to be borne withall then
others, hee hath had more
hinderances, and therefore
though he haue leſſe, may it
not be ſufficiēt? And thogh
hee come ſhort of ſome, yet
d
                  •
               th he not exceed others?
and may it not be preſumption,
to ſeeke to be with the foremoſt?
nay, is it not dāgerous
to be ſingular, & to be like nobodie?
            
            
               
And doth not the Hypocrite
now make himſelf rich,
in his pretended zeale, for the
preſeruation of unitie, curbing
& ſuppreſſing all true meaſure
of holines, as being ſingularity,
and ſo an enemy to
Concord? Reuel. 14. Doth not
he thinke to doe God good
ſeruice, In compelling to his
meaſure? that ſo hee may yet
further flatter himſelf in his
riches, becauſe none ſhall
exceede him?
            And doth not this power of
deluſiō make way for all deſperat
wickednes, Is not the
meaſure of ſin hereby haſtened?
doth not the Lord now put
in the ſickle? Is not the dead cō
                  ſcience
now reuiued to begin
the execution? & yet for al this
the hypocrite will make himſelfe
rich: Either now his repentāce

muſt heereby be appoued of the
Church, & ſo bee receiued again
to do more miſchief: or
els if he cānot be receiued of
the Church,Note. hee will ſet vp a
new Sinagogue of his owne,
by deſpiſing the ordinarie
meanes, as too baſe for his illuminated
ſpirit, whereas indeed
he reiects the meanes,
becauſe they enraged his
conſcience.
            Thus doth hee maske it
ſtil vnder his vaile of holines,
               Anabaptis
                  
                     •
                   Familiſts.
that ſo hee may commit ſin
more greedily without controulment,
pretending hee
hath the Annoynting, and
ſo no need of the word, whē
in truth he hateth ye
                word as
conuincing his conſcience.
And caſts it from him, that
he may take his fill of ſinne,

and ſo makes himſelf onely
rich in the diuels treaſure,
and yet pretends the riches
of the bleſſed Spirit. Behold
the polices of the Anabaptiſt
and Libertine the familiſt
and Papiſt. And yet doth
not Sathā help thē with another
policie, that they may
make themſelues rich? Surely,
as harlots when they want
naturall beautie, vſe to adulterate
their feature with
paintings thereby to ſeeme
that which they are not: Euen
ſo the hypocrite wanting
the inward beautie and
power of religion, labours to
inrich himſelfe in the outward
forme thereof, and as
if the natiue forme were to
plaine and abiect, behold he
adulterates the ſame with

far fetcht painting; borrowing
ſome colours from the
Iewe, and ſome ornaments
from the Gentile: And ſo
makes himſelfe rich in whoriſh
faſhions, and outward
pompe.
            Behold the height of Antichriſts
wiſdome,Vſe. And bleſſed
be God for the truth of
the Goſpell: yea bleſſed be
the name of his Maieſtie for
euer, that giues vs hearts to
labour, the power and ſimplicitie
therof. Shal not the
Lord roote out euery plant
which his owne hand hath
not planted? Shall he not aduance
his bleſſed Sonne Ieſus
vpon his holy hill of Sion?
Certainely Antichriſt is
falling, and the Iewes muſt
come in: and happie is he

that can poſſeſſe his ſoule
in patience: that can keepe
himſelfe vnſpotted of this
preſent world? Doth not the
bleſſed word abide with vs?
and is it not able to make
the man of God perfect to
euery good worke? The
Lord make vs thankfull for
the good things we enioy:
If we be faithfull in a little,
ſhal we not be entruſted with
greater bleſſings? If we beleeue,
ſhal we not ſee greater
things then theſe? Onely let
vs be ſo wiſe to diſcern theſe
cloakes of ſhame, as not to
ſtumble at them: what is
good in the hypocrite, let vs
not refuſe, becauſe he doth
abuſe it: what is euill in him,
let vs ſo deteſ
                  •
               , as that ſtill
we loue his perſon, and labour

his reclayming. So ſhal
he returne vnto vs, and not
we vnto him, though we be
all in all vnto him that we
may winne him vnto Chriſt
Ieſus: ſo if we cannot better
him, yet he ſhall not make
vs worſe, though happily we
may be abaſed by his malice
and frowardnes, yea ought
to be humbled that the
Church is troubled wt
                him.
But ſhall be not he be troubled
that troubles Iſrael.
Behold and tremble at the
iſſue hereof, doth he not very
fearefully deceiue himſelfe
and others? Yea ſurely.
            
               The euill and vnbeleeuing
ſhall waxe worſe and worſe,
deceiuing and being deceiued.
2. Tim. 3. 13.
            Obſerue how the glorious

Lord confound the wiſdome
of the wiſe, and taketh
them in their owne
craftines.
            Firſt the hypocrite deceiues
himſelfe. As
            
               Firſt he is blinded, he
knowes not his owne eſtate, and
ſo muſt needs be deceiued
becauſe he wil not ſee it. And
ſo is giuen vp.
            2 To conceiue better of it
then it is. And becauſe he will
not take the paines for a better,
therefore he deceiues
himſelf eſteeming this ſufficient.
And to this end he deceiues
himſelfe further.
            3 By reiecting the power
of the word which might lead
him to a further meaſure:
vpon pretence that he hath
no need of it, or it is not ſufficient

to informe him.
            4 Chooſing ſuch falſe
waights, as may make his
copper cu
                  •
               r
                  •
               nt, as, Example,
and reuelatrō, tradition,
multitude: And that he may
yet furter deceiue himſelfe,
Behold,
            5 He abuſeth the true Rule
to further this deluſion: either
ſticking in the letter,
and ſo deceiuing himſelfe
thereby in an outſide holines,
or abuſing the ſame to
iuſtifie his ambitious tyrannie,
ouer the conſciences of
men: Nay, he cannot kepe
himſelfe within this narrow
compaſſe, vnleſſe he alſo abuſe
the Lord of glory himſelfe,
and ſo further deceiues
himſelfe moſt dangerouſly
hereby To this end he arrogates

the prerogatiue of God,
to Iudge of mens eſtates,
that the Lord may Iudge
him iuſtly, that vniuſtly
Iudgeth of others. Thus
doth he encroach vpon, and
abuſe his Iuſtice in corder
                  •
               
               ning
the righteous, and abſoluing
the wicked, that ſo
he may be an abomination to
the Lord. Thus doth he preſume
of his mercies, that he
may exclude repētance. Thus
doth he abuſe Gods patience
to nouriſh ſecuritie, that ſo a
ſuddaine deſtruction may
come vpon him. And thus
doth the hypocrite deceiue
himſelfe.
            And doth he not alſo deceiue
others.
            
            Yea ſurely, and that many
waies, and ſo alſo deceiueth

himſelfe by encreaſing his
condemnation.
            As firſt he deceiueth them
of their outward eſtates vnder
pretence of deuotions deuouring
their ſubſtance, and
emptying their purſes vpon
a vaine hope to haue ſome
true riches for their ſoules.
            Secondly, hee deceiues
them in their eſtimation and
good name, making them
either partakers with him
in his filthines, or elſe for
the credit of profeſſion to
conceale and iuſtifie the
ſame.
            Thirdly he deceiues them
in the maine matter, of their
ſaluation. And that
            1 In their affections: making
them through his ſcandall,
to hate religion before

they knowe it, and ſo keepes
them out from entring into
the fould.
            2 In their Iudgements
when they are entred: either
ſtinting them to the letter of
the word, or his ſence thereof:
not enduring the trial of
the ſpirit: or vpon pretence
of inſufficiencie in the word;
ſtumbling them with his
own fancies in ſteed of Gods
reuealed will: and ſo keepes
them from practiſe, as being
not certaine what to do.
            3 In their practiſe he alſo
deceiues them: as either
tying them to his ſcant meaſure,
or ſtumbling them by
his crooked turnings and
wandrings out of the way,
whereby either they neuer
attaine to the right way of

practiſe, or elſe are turned
out of it againe, Gal. 3. by his
prophane and deceitfull walking.
And ſo he further deceiues
them of the true recōpence,
either prouoking to
vaine glory, or deceiuing of
others for the ſatiſfying of the
fleſh, by attaining honours,
riches, &c. 2. Col. 23.
            And thus hee deceiueth
himſelfe and others.
            1 The ſumme and vſe of
all is,
            
            That wee wiſely meaſure
the glory of an hypocrite by
the iſſue thereof, that ſo wee
may not be dazeled and deceiued
thereby.
            2 That wee daily labour
to ſee our pouerty in our ſelues,
that ſo we may ſeeke after
the true riches, Math. 5.
            
               
3 That we account our onely
riches, the righteouſnes of
Chriſt, apprehēded by faith,
and transforming vs into
the ſame Image, from glorie
to glory, Plut. 3. 8. 9.
            4 That we expect and hunger
after theſe riches, not to be
fully enioyed in this life, but
rather to be obtained when
corruption ſhall be put off.
Phil. 3. 13.
            5 That conſidering the
terrors & glory of that day,
we are daily made manifeſt
vnto our God, and alſo vnto
the conſciences of ſuch his
ſeruants, with whom we are
moſt cōuerſant. 2.Cor.5. 11.
            6 That we endeuour the
haſtning of the apperāce of
Chriſt, and our owne fitnes
thereto, by plucking ſome

daily from ſome noyſome
luſt. 1. Cor.13.
            And prepare we our ſoules
daily to afflictions that ſo
ſuffering with Chriſt we may
raigne with him. 2. Tim. 2.
            Euen ſo Lord Ieſus let thy
Kingdome come, to ſubiect
vs under thy Scepter, that ſo
we may be made meete partakers
of that glorious Inheritance
with the Saints in
Light.
            Thus farre of the Eſtate
of the Hypocrite and his wiſedome
in making the beſt
thereof. Now let vs conſider
on the other ſide, the eſtate
of the Regenerate.
            
               
Hitherto thou haſt
heard (deare Chriſtian,) of
the true eſtate of the Hypocrite:
Namely, that he is
worth nothing; all hee hath
is onely for the good of others,
and his owne further
condemnation. And that it
may appeare ye
                our deſtruction
is from our ſelues, thou
haſt alſo heard of the Hypocrites
carnall wiſedome, in
the Husbāding of his eſtate:
Namely, that he makes himſelfe
rich; Aſſuming the eſteeme
and ſhewe of what he
hath not, that ſo he may the
better hide what he is, and ſo
ripen his ſinne, and haſten
his condemnation. And ſhal
not the conſideration hereof
cauſe thee to feare thine
eſtate, and depart from euill:

daylie? ſhall it not ſend thee
to the true Touch-ſtone, to
trie and examine thy ſelfe?
            Beholde then a liuely patterne
follows for thy inſtruction,
and beeing directed
hereby, thou ſhalt find ſoūd
comfort. Though out of the
former diſcouery thou ſhalt
ſafely conclude, that there
are but few good hearts, that
ſo thou mayeſt not content
thy ſelf with the broad way,
yet ſhalt thou now ſee that
God hath not left himſelfe
without witneſſes, thou ſhalt
not go alone. Bleſſed be God
thou haſt a clowd of witneſſes,
the way is well beatē and
traced for thee. And therfore
in the name of God walke in it,
and the Lord giue thee wiſedome
and vnderſtanding in
all things.
         
         
            
            And for thy better incouragement
hereto; Take
this ſhort view of the ſubiect
and ſumme of theſe enſuing
Obſeruations.Obſer. I.
            
            Doctrines and Obſeruations,
contained in this
ſecond Treatiſe.
            1. The Elect alone is poſſeſſed
with true and great Riches.
            
               The Reaſons hereof, and,
hence concluded.
               1. The Excellencie of their
Eſtate.
               2. How we may know whether
we are partakers of this riches
or not.
               3. How wee may preſeru
                     •
                  
and encreaſe this Eſtate.
            
            
               
2. Gods Children are poore
in ſpirit, though they haue great
Riches,Obſeru. they make themſelues
poore.
            
               The Reaſons heereof, together
with the ground of this
pouertie, ſeruing for triall,
as alſo.
               2 the manner, and
               3 Meaſure tending thereto,
and
               4 Laſtly, the Practiſe and
Vſe thereof.
            
         
         
            
            The Eſtate of the
true Nathaniel.
            That maketh himſelfe poore,
Hauing great Riches.
            
               Herein remember, Firſt his
Eſtate, hauing great riches.
            Secondly, his Wiſedome, in
Husbanding the ſame; Hee
makes himſelfe poore.
            WHat then is the Eſtate
of the true Nathaniel? Surely He
hath great Riches: He is not
onely Rich, but he hath great
Riches,
               Obſeru. & no meruaile, For
All is his, Becauſe CHRIST
is his, in whom are hidden all

the Treaſures of wiſedome and
knowledge.
               The ſincere Chriſtian, a great rich man. Colloſſ. 2.3. To
whome all power is giuen, in
Heauen and Earth: Matth. 
                  •
               8
who is King of Kings, & Lord
of Lords, Reuel. 16. and that
not ſo much for himſelfe, as
to make vs Kings and Prieſts
vnto our God, yea through
Chriſt, wee are Heyres euen
fellowe Heires, of a Kingdome
Immortall and vndefiled,
that faileth not, and
cannot be ſhaken, Reuel. 1.
Rom. 8. Hebr. 12. 2. Cor.
5. 17.
            2. Thus being in Chriſt, we
become new creatures, & ſo are
inveſted with true Godlineſſe,
which is great gaine, euen durable
riches, which the world
cānot ſtrip vs of, which ſhall
continue and abide with vs,

vs for euer, 1. T

               n. 4. Prou. 8.
Matth. 6.
            3. And enioying Godlines,
we are ſatisfied therewith,
learning true contentment in
all things, as well to want as
to abound: And ſo hauing nothing,
yet we poſſeſſe all things:
Phil. 4. 2. Cor. 6. Though the
wicked haue proſperitie, yet
we fret not at it, though wee
endure affliction, yet are wee
exceeding rich, in ioy vnſpeakable
& glorious, yea rich in conqueſt▪
               
& rich in patience, that
wee may not fainte. Pſalm.
37. 1. Pet. 1. 8 Rom. 8. Iac. 1.
            4 Thus as in Chriſt we obtaine
the right, & royaltie of
all things, ſo alſo by him we
receiue grace to vſe them aright.
And ſo though in the
Iuſtice of God, we might be

accounted vnprofitable Seruants,
yet through the merite
of CHRIST we become rich
in good workes, growing in
grace, & encreaſing mightily in
ye
                power of godlines, euēvn
till we ſhalbe filled withall fullnes
of God: Eph. 3. Luk. 
                  •
               7.10
            5. And howſoeuer our
portiō of this life be vſually
but a ſmall thing, yet by the
bleſſing of God it is great riches,
as being much better
thē great riches of the vngodly:
both in that wee haue grace
to vſe it well: & it is alſo as a
pledge of further heauēly riches
as by the true vſe whereof,
ſtoring vp a good foundation
againſt the day of Chriſt Ieſus,
Pſalm. 37. 1. Tim. 6.
            6. And to ſay the trueth,
would there be any riches in
the World, would there be any

world continued, but for
the Elects ſake? thogh for the
Elect, the worldes time ſhall be
ſhortned, that they might
more ſpeedily enioy the fulnes
of their riches. Nay, Is
not the riches of the wicked,
treaſured vp for the iuſt? Are
the worldlings any other thē
the childrens Factors, & Stewards
to bring it in, and lay
                  •
                it
out for them? Matthew. 24.
Iob. 27.
            7 What ſhall we ſay, if any
be rich for the preſent, it is
onely the true owner, he may
iuſtifie his eſtate. he may only
promiſe ſecuritie thereof: if
any be rich in hope, ſurely the
child of God i
                  •
                the only mā,
who is the vndoubted heyre
of the immortall & ſuperexcellent
waight of glorie, which cā

                     •
                  iued by the largeſt

                  •
               . 2. Cor. 4.
            And to conclude, euen
when he ſeemes to be moſt
poore, then is the childe of
God m
                     •
                  ſt rich, then is the triall
of his faith, then is he moſt
rich in Hope, moſt feruent
in prayer, moſt glorious in
patience, then hath he moſt
boldnes and intereſt in the
fauour of God, then is he
ſent to renue his eſtate in
the merite of Chriſt, and ſo
is partaker of the exceeding
riches of the mercy of his
God. Epheſ. 2. And is it not
great equitie that he that is
poore in the world, ſhould
be rich in faith? 
               
                  •
               acob. 2. Is it
not meet that if Diues haue
his portion in this life, Lazarus
ſhould haue his portion

of comfort which the other
deſpiſed? Luk. 16. Doth
not prophane Eſan contemne
the birthright in compariſon
of the meſſe of pottage?
Geneſ. 27. And is it not iuſt
with God to giue them this
Heauenly pearle, that like
wiſe merchants are content
to ſell all they haue to buy
the ſame? 2. Tim. 4 Matth. 13
10. Is it not meet, that the
members ſhould be conformable
                     •
                  
to the head? 11. Can the
mēbers be poore, whē all treaſures
belong to the head?
12. Muſt they not be made
rich and abounding in good
workes, leaſt they may
ſeeme to labour in vaine?
1. Cor. 15. 13. Are they not
to be purged that they may
bring forth more fruit, Ioh.
15. 2. that ſo they may be

pertakers of that glorious
inheritance with the Saints
in light.
            And are they not rich in humilitie
that they may ſtill be
more enriched by Chriſt
are they not rich in patience
to expect the recompence
of the reward. Thus abaſing
themſelues? are they not exalted?
are they not encreaſed
in riches by making themſelues
poore. Behold the eſtate
of the Saints: they haue choſen
the better part. Luk. 10.
They haue great riches, Ieſus
Chriſt: and all things
with him. A bleſſed portion,
making them truly bleſſed:
are not their lines fallen in
pleaſant places, haue they
not a goodly inheritāce? Pſ.
16. that haue heauen for their

               Kingdome, and the earth for
their footeſtoole, that haue all
good things here to enioy,
and ſo fitted by theſe things
to fulnes of ioy.
            1. Behold then the eſtate
of the Saints of God, And
tell me if any may compare
with him in happines? Doe
not they, I pray you, ſerue
the beſt maiſter? haue not
they the beſt father that
thus prouides for them? Is
any God like vnto their God,
that doth ſo vnto them that
waite vpon him? Eſay. 64. 5.
And ſhall we then repent vs
of our choyce? ſhal we think
it is in vaine to ſerue this

ſo great a reward.
            1. Haue wee any cauſe
to doubt, ſeeing all ſhall turne
to our good? Nay, Are not our
afflictiōs the bruches of Gods

Refined, and made more
pure and durable? Hebr. 11.

vs of outward things, yet let
it ſuffice that we cannot looſe

Right in this heauenly inheritance,

haue onely the true, and
great riches: All are beggers
and banquerouts in compariſon
of them: let this teach
vs what to thinke of ſuch Ignorant
Proteſtants, and obſtinate
Papiſts, what of al Turks
and Infidels, that yet are
without Chriſt, ſurely they
are a poore people and without

they haue no part in Chriſt,
and therefore no portion of
heauenly riches. And therefore
let this prouoke vs further,
to lament their eſtates,
and to mourne for the generall
ignorance of the Land:
Let vs acknowledge the Iuſtice

of God in pleading his controuerſie
againſt the ſame,

Let vs not forget the Firſtborne

who hath bene made poore,
that wee may be made rich:

againe.
            Howſoeuer; Let euerie
one labour to ſaue his owne
ſoule: Labouring to ſtore

Therefore in the feare of
God, labour wee to trie our
eſtates, whether wee are partakers
of that durable Riches.
            Surely,Rules of Triall. by Nature wee are
ſtarke Beggars: and by abuſe
of the meanes of grace wee
become Deſperate Banquerouts:
euen twice dead, and
pluckt vp by the rootes.

And therefore if we would
approue our ſelues to haue
this heauenly riches, we
muſt not relie on our nature,
any glory thereof, ſeeing
the wiſedome thereof is enmitie
againſt God, excluding
the hope of heauenly riches.
Rom. 8▪ 7.
            1 Wouldſt thou thē attaine
to the true riches in Chriſt,
Let thy firſt practiſe now be
to diſcerne thy natural pouerty,
(by the meanes before laid

thine eſtate in nature,

place, denie thy ſelfe, Math. 
                  •

in nature is there any
dramme of this true riches, neither
can nature further thee

thine owne wicked heart:
thy beſt wiſedome, and counſell,
will cauſe thee moſt to
rebell againſt thy God, and
reſiſt thy chiefe good: Eſay.
            47. Thus ſhalt thou prepare
thy ſelfe to receiue this heauenly
treaſure, by emptying
thy heart of

                what cannot
profit, and ſo caſtingaway
ſuch impediments, thou
ſhalt be in ſome meaſure fitted
to entertaine the ſame.
            1 To this end take vnto
thee the true glaſſe which
many diſcouer truely vnto
thee thy naturall eſtate,
namely, the law of God. Rom.
7. And when thou haſt ſeene

But rather reuiewe thy ſelfe

by the word, & make
vſe of ſuch outward Afflictions
which doe accompanie
the word, the rather to abaſe

of his Grace, begging Pardon
inſtantly for thy ſinnes, and
quite renouncing all thy former
wayes; That ſo thou mayeſt
be found in CHRIST,
not hauing thine owne righteouſnes.
            
               
Now that thou mayeſt be
found in CHRIST, thou

to ſeeke CHRIST,
where he may be found, Eſay,

            And now thou muſt ſeke
him in thoſe his precious promiſes
of the Goſpell: Apprehending
(through him alone)
free pardon of all thy ſinnes;
And ſo recouering grace from
him, to walke in newe obedience.
            And leaſt ſeeking him
heere, thou mightſt happily

ſeeke by Faith, that ſo thou
mayeſt applie theſe promiſes
in particular, vnto thine
owne Soule: And thou
muſt waite with Patience, at

the gates of Wiſedome, being
contented to ſubmit
thy ſelfe to the meanes,
till thy heart be captiuated
therewith, & thy whole man
brought in ſubiection to the
obedience of Ieſus Chriſt.

            And laſtly, thou muſt
ſeeke in perſeuerance and conſtancie
of endeuour, Ye
                though
thou faile in practiſe, yet the
willing minde may be accepted,
according to that which thou
haſt. 2. Cor. 8. 12. reſoluing
thy ſelfe, that thy great
riches, ſtands rather, in the
acceptance of thy endeuours,
then in any worth of thy
weldoing, though yet thou
ſhalt exceed herein the Scribe
and Phariſie. Yea ye

                  aue onely the glorie of all his

mercies. Let this be the triall
of thy greateſt riches: that
though the Lord beſtow
great things on thee, yet
thou ſeeſt thy ſelfe moſt vnworthie
of them. Geneſ. 32.
Yea the more graces thou receiueſt,
the more thou art abaſed
by them, Yea in the greateſt
ſence of Gods fauour,
thou art ſo emptied of all carnall
confidence, that thou then
moſt feareſt thy ſelfe, when
grace doth moſt abound:
that ſo thou maiſt worke out
thy ſaluation in feare and trembling.
Phil. 2. 12. And yet in
thy greateſt abaſings, thou
muſt giue glory to thy God,
in depending on his pretious
promiſes beyond al feeling
thereof, though hee
ſhould kill thee, yet truſting
in him.
            
               
And ſeeing thou art an
Heyre, and not an Hyreling,

GOD, not ſimplie for
what hee giues, but becauſe
hee commaunds, and meerely
for his glorie, dooing his
will cheerefully: therefore
howſoeuer, hee hath promiſed
thee Heauen for thy ſeruice,
and to encourage thee
thereunto, doth enable thee
by faith, to ſee a farre off, and
to haue reſpect vnto the recompence
of that rewarde,
yet herein ſhall be the triall
of thy greateſt riches: that
not ſimplie for that reward,
thou performeſt obedience
vnto God, but as (rather
then the glorie of GOD ſhall
be diminiſhed, thou couldeſt

be contented to bee without
thy greateſt happines: Exod.
32. Roman. 9. becauſe thy
chiefeſt happines, ſhall bee
attained and enioyed, in giuing
glorie alone vnto thy God,
ſo that thou mayeſt the better
be prepared to that happineſſe.
            Thou ſhalt ſtill denie
thy ſelfe: ſo farre to giue glorievnto
thy GOD; and that
in thy beſt endeuours thou
ſhalt diſcerne thy greateſt
vnworthines, that thy God
may haue the glorie of all
his free mercie, in thy greateſt
Feelings of ioy, and partakings
of comfort, thou
art moſt emptied of all Pride
and confidence. That ſo, Securitie
beeing preuented,
thou mayeſt ſtill by Faith

ſee a farre off, & runne with ioy
the race that is ſet before thee.
Hebr. 12. 5. Rom. 4. giuing
God the glorie, ſtill in hoping
aboue hope. Yea interreſſing
hereby thy ſelfe dayly,
as an heyre, in the aſſurance
of thy heauenly poſſeſſion,
by this, that though
thou art now the ſonne of
God, yet becauſe thou know
eſt not what thou ſhalt be,
Ioh. 3. 1. therefore thou art
carefull to walke ſo farre as
thou knoweſt: ſo making
ſure thy election by conſtancie
and power of weldoing,
2. pet 1. 10. that it is rather
thy comfort, that thou
haſt done the will of thy God;
yea rather herein thou art
comforted, that thou ſeeſt in
thy ſhortnes of weldoing, thy vnworthines,
               
& ſo haſt no cauſe
of thy ſelfe to expect that
glorious recompence, that
either any ſuch glorious
prize remaines for thee:
or that there is any proportion
betwixt thy finite & corrupt
obedience, and that infinite
& moſt perfect recompence
of the reward? Rom. 8.
            And therefore, as thou
canſt not ſo ſerue thy God,
as by the worth thereof, to
obtaine, and expect that recompence,
ſo yet that thy
free obedience may more
gratiouſly be manifeſted,
though there were no ſuch
recōpence, yet thou couldſt
willingly ſerue thy God, euē
for the worth & goodnes that
thou diſcerneſt in him,
though no other goodnes

ſhould herein redound vnto
thee, then that herein thou
haſt approued thy ſelfe a
louing and obedient childe to
ſo gratious a father.
            Thus ſhall we attaine theſe
heauenly treaſures. And thus
we may alſo trie our ſelues,
whether we doe truely enioy
them or no.
            And ſeeing it is as great a
vertue (to preſerue and encreaſe)
as to obtaine the
ſame,Rules how to encreaſe. therefore learne we
further, how to encreaſe in
grace, how to thriue in heauenly
ſubſtance.
            1 To this end know we,
that the meanes of obtaining,
muſt be the onely meanes
of encreaſing.
            2 By Chriſt we obtaine
this riches, through the miniſterie

of the word, and
therefore by the ſame
meanes we muſt encreaſe
the ſame. 1. Pet. 2. 1.
            3 Submit we our ſelues
therefore conſtantly to a
powerfull miniſtry, whereby
the graces we enioy, may
ſtill be ſtirred vp, and prouoked
to vſe, and knowledge
may be increaſed to ſee our
wants, and our wants may
beſupplied, by ſeeking ſtill
to be renued in Chriſt. And
hereby trie we our ſelues,
if euer we truely attained
this heauenly riches, then
ſurely wee ſhall not either
fall to no miniſterie, or to
liueleſſe and flattering meanes
(as the manner of hypocrites
is) but rather ſtil keepe

our ſelues from ſecuritie and
Apoſtaſie, by cleauing to a
ſound and conſcionable miniſterie.
And leſt hereby we
deceiue our ſelues.
            2 Therefore in the next
place, Let vs labour that the
word may come home, and
dwell with vs in our families,
and priuate waies, Coll. 3. 15.
that it may be the guide of all
our courſes, and keeper of vs in
a conſtant courſe of Godlines:
not entertaining it by ſtarts,
or onely making it an Idol,
when we come abroad: but
informing our Iudgments dayly
hereby, and reforming our
liues alſo by this rule. And
this is my intent in the Daily
ſacrifice.
            
            3 And yet that theſe
things may be ſo in vs, that

they may abound, labour we
thirdly, to reuiue our eſtate
daily in Chriſt, by renued repentance,
from whom onely
we muſt deriue all our durable
riches. 2. Pet. 1. 8. 9. Rom.
12. 12.
            4 Yea that we indeed may
thriue in all the graces of
God, ſeeing that we are inriched
in every part at the firſt
in ſome meaſure: no facultie
of the ſoule, but is in
ſome meaſure renued, yea
the members of the body made
conformable to the will of
God,Note▪
                Rom. 6. therefore that
we may grow in grace, and
encreaſe this heauēly ſtock,
Let vs labour to come forward,
in each part together, hauing
that principall care of
the greateſt, that we neglect

not the leaſt as hauing reſpect
to all Gods commandements,
Pſal. 119. 8 ſo maiſtering one
ſinne, that we giue no indulgence
to any; leaſt the leaſt
thieſe remaining, let in all

                  ward, hauing our conuerſation
holy, as that which
muſt trie our inward ſinceritie:
that ſo our whole nam,
euen bodie, and ſoule, and
ſpirit, may be kept blameleſſe,
vnto the day of Chriſt
Ieſus. 1. Theſſ. 5.

without the remainde

               ,
we ſhall not be perfited:
therefore,Hebr. 11. that wee may
thriue our ſelues, let vs labour
to bring on others with

vs, watching ouer each other
by an holy Iealou
                     •
                  ly, and gracious
admonitions, yea as need
ſhall require, ſauing with feare
plucking ſome out of the fire.
Iud. 22. 22. Ezek. 32.
            6 And ſeeing our bleſſed
GOD alone, will perfect the

                  n
in vs, 2. Phil. 6. Epheſ 6. therfore
be we inſtant with him, in
feruent prayer, that he would
haſten his worke, and glorifie
himſelfe perfectly in vs, and
though for temporal things
we are to begge with condition,
both in regard wee knowe
neither what is fit, neither
what meaſure is moſt cōuenient
for vs, yet concerning
heauen'y bleſſings, wee are
to coue
                  •
                and deſire the beſt
graces. 1. Cor. 12. And therefore

take we heede of entertaining
ſuch deluſions in iudgment▪
               
that we may be too holy,
that ſuch a meaſure will ſerue
the turne. But rather reſolue
we, that we can neuer ſufficiently
be thankeful vnto our
bleſſed God, for his mercies
beſtowed and prouided for
vs,Pſal. 16. yea acknowledge we that
when we haue done all we
can, we are but vnprofitable
ſeruants. And therefore, howſoeuer
we faile in practiſe,
               Luk. 17. 10. yet
let vs ſtand ſound in iudgement
that God is worthie of the beſt,
that though we condemne our
ſelues, yet wee may iuſtifie
our God, that he, may not
iudge vs, according to our
vnworthines.
            8 And though we can
not in practiſe, anſwere our

purpoſes, yet let this be a
meanes to continue our
ſpirituall thrift, that here we
giue not ouer practiſe at all, becauſe
we cannot attaine perfection
herein (as the manner
of the A
                  •
               hieſt is) neither
ſtint our practiſe by any falſe
rules, 1. of example, multitude,
fleſh and blood, our owne abilitie,
cuſtome, &c. (as if becauſe
we cannot doe what
we would, or ſhould, therefore
it is ſufficient,

                to doe
what we may: can fleſh & blood

                  •
               . Or to do as others

                  ?
3. Nay would you haue vs
hypocrites, taking more vpon
vs then we can do? 
               
                  •
               or all this
will proue no better then
the plea of the hypocrite.

But rather, let vs iuſtifie God,
by endeuouring what we
cannot doe, and let vs condemne
our fayling in practiſe
from the conſtancie of our
purpoſe, propoſing the beſt paterne,
though we come ſhort
thereof: that it may appeare
we hold by mercie, & not by
any merite of our owne, and
reſoluing perfection, when
we do but follow after it: that
ſo the Lord may Crowne our
conſtant reſolutions, with ſuch
a meaſure of practiſe, which
may in truth anſwere our deſires,
though in meaſure and
extent, it ſtill came ſhort
thereof.
            Comforting our ſelues,Vſe of Comfort.
that howſoeuer in ye
                worlds
eſteeme, we are accounted
moſt baſe and beggerly, yea

many times in our owne Carnall
eye, appeare to be nothing,
euen to haue loſt all,
yea alſo ſometime in our
ſpirituall diſcerning, ſee our
ſelues farre from great riches,
yet notwithſtanding,
in the acceptance of the Almightie,
vouchſafing vs in
Chriſt, and inueſting vs with
his righteouſnes, we haue
right in all riches, and by the
aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, haue
ſo farre vſe of them, as ſhall
fit vs to fulnes of happines,
in a better life: perſwading
our ſelues, that either we
may miſiudge ou

faith, ſeeing a farre off vnto
the recompence of the reward,
therefore, if now in
compariſon of what we ſhall
enioy, wee eſteeme of what we
haue alreadie not to be great
riches. It is not becauſe our
eſtate is not rich indeed, but
as a droppe is not diſcerned,
being caſt into the ſea, ſo
well may the ſence of our
preſent riches, be ſwallowed
vp in the hope of that infinite
ſea of happines which is
laid vp for vs.
            And yet that we may not
proue vnthankefull for what
we haue receiued, here 
                  •

                leaſt the abuſe of
our graces may ſeeme to diminiſh
the worth of them,

the free bountie of the giuer,
and not by the weake hand
of the receiuer: 4. Let vs conſider
them, not by the poſſeſſion,
but by the vſe thereof:
nay let vs not reſt in the vſe,
which at the beſt is imperfect,
but rather comfort our
ſelues with the acceptance of
our weldoing through Ieſus
Chriſt.
            Let not the opinion of others
preuaile to diminiſh our eſtate.

Let not the ſuggeſtion
of Sathan deceiue vs herein,
But labour we to meaſure
our riches by the truth of the
word. And if euer we found
any truth,

               Benefits of our decay. 1. As caſting vs
more entirely vpon the
mercy of God in Chriſt Ieſus,
2. weaning vs from the
loue of the world, and 3.

prouoking vs to groane and
hunger after thoſe durable
comforts of a better life, ſeeing
the beſt comforts here
are ſo ſhort and mutable:
4. And making vs more
fearefull and watchfull to
preſerue and recouer what
we may, that ſo we may be
made meet for that glorious
Inheritance.
            Thus are the Saints endued
with great riches, thus
doe they manage and encreaſe
the ſame: ſo the holie

and ſo in compariſon
of what is before, forget what
is behinde: ſo reioycing in
their preſent eſtate, as that
they cannot meaſure Gods fauour

ſimplie by it, and ſo are
abaſed & impaired in themſelues:
ſo comforting themſelues
in the truth of grace,
as that ſtill they liue by faith
haſtning to perfection, so approuing
themſelues by the
preſent worke, as that ſtill
they denie themſelues, that
they may be found in Chriſt,
by whom the work muſt be
led forward to perfection.
            3 Becauſe whatſoeuer we
haue, we are moſt vnworthie of

though we are rich in God,

they haue great riches, in regard
of the new man, yet 2 ſtil
they are exceeding, 3 poore
in the olde, therefore ſeeing
4 the meanes to grow in the

that through this outward abaſing,

grace, is nothing elſe but daylie
renued repentance, So much we
truely liue, as Chriſt liues in vs.
And he liues onely in vs whē

               : ſurely if we make
not our ſelues poore in the

encreaſe them. 2. Cor 5. 1. 2.

            Doe we not daily encreaſe

moments, and haue we not
cauſe to be abaſed herein?
            Well thus you ſee there is
great reaſon why Gods children
ſhould make themſelues
poore.
            Shall we now conſider the
ground and manner how they
doe abaſe themſelues? ſhall
we diſcerne a little further
the meaſure of this abaſing?
            Surely for the ground of
this their pouertie,
1. It is not forced from them
by feare of vengeance,
               G
                     •
                  ound of ſpirituall pouertie. which
they are freed from, but rather
from an holy deſire, to be
auenged of themſelues, for
the abuſe of Gods mercies,

that ſo iudging themſelues,
they may not bee iudged of
the Lord.
            2. Neither dooth the feare,
that God accepts not their perſons,
wring from them this
emp
                  •
               ying of themſelues, becauſe
though they feele not
this alwaies, yet by Faith
they liue in the Sonne of
God, and ſo aboue preſent
feeling, either comfort them
ſelues, with former 
                  •
                aſſurāce,
or waite vpon the Lorde, in
belieuing vnder hope aboue
hope: but the ground of this
abaſing, Is an holy feare of our
ſelues, leaſt either wee may
fall into ſuch groſſe euils, as
may depriue vs of former cō
               fort,
or may bee 
                  
                     •
                  ainted with
ſome ſpirituall wickedneſſe, of
pride, vaine-glorie, when we

ſtand and abound in comforts:
that ſo robbing GOD
of his glorie, wee may be
ſtripped of further comforts.
            
            3 Neither doth this abaſing
proceed frrom hypocriſie, that
ſo wee might the rather be
magnified of others: Although
who ſhall hinder the
light to breake out, and if we
be approoued of men, ſhall
not this tender to their further
condemnation, that will
not be like vnto vs?
            If we haue cauſe to make
our ſelues poore, what little
cauſe haue they to bragge of
their beggery? But we make
our ſelues poore, to preuent
hypocriſie, not hereby to denie
what we are, but leaſt we ſhuld
aſſume what wee are not, or
ſeeme to be better then we are:
               
hereby we preuent ſlightnes
and cuſtomarines in holy
duties, which breeds hypocriſie:

                  •
               hereby we preuent
pride▪ the damme and nurſe

4 hereby we renue
our repentance daily, and ſo
ſcoure off all tainture of hypocriſie.
            
            4 Neither are they cōuinced
with the inward ſence of their
begg
                     •
                  rie, a
                  •
               d ſo are forced to
make themſelues poore, as
the hypocrite often is, denying
his profeſſion, being aſhamed
of his ſhewes, reiecting
the meanes, &c. But
they are conuinced 
                     •
                  ith the
want of what they ſhould haue.
               
And therefore, though they
haue great riches yet, ſeeing
it is nothing to what they
ſhould haue, therefore they
ſtill emptie themſelues of all
confidence and conceit of ſufficiencie,
which the hypocrite
flatters himſelfe in, that ſo
ſtill they may be prepared
to receiue further riches.
And to this end they are further
cōuinced with many wants
in the vſe of preſent graces:
And ſo are daily prouoked
to denie themſelues, that
they may be found in Chriſt
Ieſus, and in him grow to
perfection: yea they are further
conuinced with the rebellions
and continuall oppoſitions
of the old man: And ſo haue
cauſe to make themſelues
poore,Note. cōſidering what they

               haue bene, yet conſidering
what the leaſt relicke of corruption
might do, if the Lord
ſhould looke vpon vs in
iudgement, euen to infatuate
all preſent grace, and depriue
vs of all hope of further
meaſure, this is the
meanes to make them abaſe
themſelues, that ſo ſtill they
may flie into the boſome of
Gods mercie.
            Theſe are the grounds of
this heauenly wiſdome, that
the Child of God, makes
himſelfe poore.
            By which we may trie the
truth of Grace in vs, and alſo
bee led forwa
                  •
               d to perfection.
            To this end conſider we
further the manner how the
Saints make themſelues

poore, by what meanes they
abaſe themſelues, what is the
practiſe of this heauenly
wiſedome.
            Surely the Lord that ordaines
the end fitteth alſo
the meanes, ſutable thereunto.
And therefore the
manner of this practiſe is
holy and warrantable.
            Though they are ſaid to
make themſelues poore, yet
this is not to exclude the grace
of God, by which onely they
doe all good, but rather to
exclude conction, and all by reſpects,
which might moue
them hereunto: and indeed
to implie, that freely and
comfortably they make themſelues
poore, In great wiſedome

                  ie are moued

            That this may the better
appeare, obſerue we the
manner? Can they auoid the

by him? do they not ſubmit
themſelues in all things to his
bleſſed wil? do they not feare
to offend him, care to pleaſe
him in all things, grieue becauſe
they haue diſpleaſed
him, yea becauſe they cānot
pleaſe him as they would;
ſtriue to approue themſelues
in all things vnto his bleſſed

            And in all theſe abaſe them
ſelues, making themſelues

poore, in, and by the practiſe
of all theſe.
            2 Can they doe any thing
without the grace of Chriſt leſus?
And do they not abaſe
themſelues, by denying their
owne righteouſnes, neither
reſting in the meaſure, nor approuing
the perfection hereof,
nor iuſtiſying thēſelues thereby,
that ſo they may ſtill
hunger after the righteouſnes
of Chriſt Ieſus? do they
not make themſelues poore
by labouring ſtill to be couered
with the righteouſnes of Chriſt,
by aſcribing the worke of
ſaluation meerely to Gods
mercy through him; by giuing
God onely all the glorie
of his truth and faithfulnes?

            Behold here the manner
how the Saints abaſe themſelues.
            And let this teach vs to
entertaine this practiſe: Let
it comfort vs againſt the contradictions
and imputations
of the world, which either
would hinder, or chaelenge
the ſame.
            To this end conſider we
in the laſt place the meaſure
of this abaſing.How farre he saints 
                     •

                     •
                  hemſelues. 1. How farre
the Saints doe impoueriſh
themſelues. As firſt
            1 In their greateſt abaſing,
they onely confound and
ſubdue the fleſh, to which they
are not debters: As for the
ſpirit and inward man, that is
hereby caſed, and much

more aduanced to libertie
of weldoing, and comfort
therein, by how much the
more, fleſh and blood is not
conſulted with, nor honoured
in the ſame: 2. Gala. 25.
Now the hypocrites abaſing,
is to ſatisfie the fleſh: 2.
Coll. 23. Gal. and to the abaſing
and ſo renouncing by
degrees of all ſpirituall duties,
and graces: Math. 25.
Iob.21. 15.
            2 The greateſt abaſings
of Gods children, whether
they be outward in the bodie,
or inward their ſpirits, ſerue
to the aduancing of God, and
onely the humbling and denying
of themſelues, if they
are afflicted, neuer ſo gri
                  •
               
               uouſly,
they iuſtifie God, and
iudge themſelues; 2. If they

               are wounded in conſ
                     •
                  ience: they
complaine off, their want of
faith, to lay hold of comfort;
and not of Gods faithfulnes in
ſupporting without comfort,
               Iob. 13. 15. If
they diſpaire, it is onely in
themſelues, and of themſelues,
they dare not though
the Lord ſhould kill them but
truſt in him, they cannot
diſpaire of God,Pſ. 37. Note. 
               ſeeing his
hand is put vnder, in their
greateſt faintings hee anſweres
them not according
to their infidelitie, and therfore,
hee is in mercie with
them.
            If they condemne their vnworthines,
they onely condemne
themſelues herein,
1. becauſe they abuſe Gods bleſſings,
not becauſe they were
not worth the rec
                     •
                  iuing; 2. becauſe

they cannot diſcerne
any reaſon as of themſelues,
why God ſhould be ſo good
vnto them, not becauſe they
ſee no reaſon in God, that he
ſhall loue,Note. where he pleaſeth,
and keepe his promiſe,
where once he hath loued:
Ioh. 15. 3. becauſe through
want of faith they cannot ſee
their worthines in Chriſt, not
becauſe the worthines of
Chriſt, doth not belong vnto
them.
            3 And though the Saints,
doe ſo farre abaſe themſelues,
that the more ſeruice
they doe vnto God,
the more they ſee their faylings:
And therefore are
yet more vile in their owne
eyes, becauſe hereby they
ſee themſelues more vnworthie

worthie to doe God any ſeruice;
Yet are they not hereby
diſtracted in their obedience,
or deiected from further
performance thereof: they doe
not now remit their zeale,
and abate their courage in
weldoing (as the hypocrite
doth) but rather the more
they ſee their 
                  •
               aylings, the
more are their deſires enflamed,
               
                  
                     •
                  ote
               and reſolutions confirmed,
that they had need to
be more diligent, and conſtant
in weldoing, though
they finde little comfort in
the Action, yet ſtill in obedience
to Gods commandement,
they will doe good while
they may: liuing by faith,
inſteed of comfort, and wayting
with patience ye
                crowning
of the worke, Gal. 6. Ioh. 12.

And will not the glorious
Lorde returne vnto▪ them at
the length, ſhal not they that
humble themſelues be exalted?
Yea ſurely:
            4 There is not the loweſt
meaſure of humiliation the
child of God ſhal bring himſelfe
vnto, but as the Lordes
hand is lower, to holde him
vp from further ſinking:
So Ieſus Chriſt his head, being
exalted,Pſal. 37. will alſo reach
his hand in time, to raiſe him
vp againe, Ioh 8 32.
            Yea, euen this worke of humiliation
is a great aduancement,
1. As hereby getting conqueſt
of pride,
               Benefites of abaſing 
               ſecuritie, & hardnes
of heart? 2. What ſinne is
there, which is not cruſhed by
this meanes? 3. what grace is
it, that is not tried heereby? 4.

what vertue which hath not
in this worke receiued ſome
enereaſe: & can ſuch cōqueſts
want their triumphs,Rom.8. ſhal not
ſuch trialls yeeld ioy vnſpeakable
& glorious? can encreaſe

comfort, 1. Pet. As for the
hipocrite,

                  te in affliction. 
               it is not ſo with him,
if he be outwardly afflicted,
hee is vſually driuen to diſpaire:
if he diſpaire, he renoū
                  ceth
mercie: if he be wounded
in ſpirit, he cannot 
                     •
                  ndure it: if
he ſee his vnworthines, it is rather
becauſe God bath not giuen
him better,
               And that Outward. then thst hee
hath not deſerued it, he rather
accounts God beholding vnto
him, for the receiuing the
bleſſing, then himſelfe beholding
vnto GOD, for the abuſe
thereof: as for the righteouſnes

of Chriſt, well may hee
make an Idole of it to cloake his
hypocriſie, either he thinks he
hath no neede of it, or if hee
haue it for complemēt, thats
all hee ſeekes.
            But if the Lorde once begins
to reckon with him, and
to call vpon him, though it
be in the coole of the day, reviuing
his dead conſcience: and
quailing his carnall cōforts:
by arreſting him with ſome
ſharpe and ſuddain ſeourge:
How dooth the hope of the
hypocrite periſh in a moment?Inward.
If carnall wiſdome and naturall
courage will not ſerue, to
bite in the affliction, or ouermatch
the ſame, but that
out it muſt, and our counterfeit

not he fall into miſchief? pro. 24

neuer riſing againe, will not
all his carnall helpe further to
keepe him downe? yea, to en

                  reaſe
his torment, & ſo to begin
his hell, euen in this life,
can hee expect deliuerance,
that makes a mock of Chriſt?
Heb. 6. 5. 6. can he haue comfort,
that refuſeth triall? can he
riſe again, that caſts away his
confidence, yea, is confounded
therein?
            Well, thus we ſee, the meaſure
of the Saints humiliation,
how farre they make themſelues
poore, that they may encreaſe
their eſtate; wee ſee
herein how they differ from
the Hypocrite. What doe we
learne hence?
            
            1. Surely, to trie our ſelues, by
this meaſure of humiliation,
whither wee haue receiued

grace of God in vaine, by examining
our ſelues in the former
degrees:
            And for Concluſion,
               Vſe. ſeeing
it is the practiſe of the Saints,
thus to abaſe themſelues,How to make ourſelues truely poore in ſpirit. let
vs take heede of preſuming aboue
that which is meet. Let vs
auoyde the meanes, which
may flatter vs in our eſtates:
either keeping vs in the ignorāce
thereof, that wee may not attaine
to the true Riches: or
dazeling vs, with the knowledge
thereof, being rich, to
hinder our encreaſe.
            
               To this end, auoyd we ignorance
of the meaſure of our riches,
and labour we ſtill to caſt
vp our iuſt account daily by our
Vſe, and acceptance of well dooing:
For ſo rich iuſt we are, as
we are accepted.
            
               
2 Take we heed of flatterie
and▪ daubing whereby wee
are prouoked to eſteeme our
caſe, better then it is, and ſo
neuer labour to be abaſed in
our ſelues: and ſubmit we 
                     •
                  o
a powerfull and conſcionable miniſtery.
            
            3 Auoid we multitude of worldly
buſines, & ſeeking after great
matters, and learn we contentment,
in the meaneſt eſtate,
and this ſhall prepare vs to abaſe
our ſelues in our ſpirituall
condition.
            4 Meditate wee often vpon
the failings of the Saints, and
ſuch abaſings of themſelues,
which proceed
                  •
                therevpon:
and if wee come ſhort of their
graces, let vs conſider that we
haue neede to be abaſed.
            5 Conſider we the pollicie of

Satan, which will not ſticke,
if he cānot tickle vs with pride,
and lull vs in ſecuritie, at leaſt

                becauſe we cannot but
in ſome meaſure abuſe them.

therefore not entending our
perfection, 4. Or they are
common and ordinarie: and

vnworthines of the leaſt, and
therefore to bleſſe GOD for
any: to ſee the ſufficiencie of
what we haue aboue our deſart,
that ſo we may giue God

glorie, that makes what we haue
to ſerue the turne: to be ſo abaſed
in our decay, that ſtill we
are contented to abaſe our
ſelues further, in giuing vnto
our GOD the glorie of his
faithfulnes, that he will recouer
& ſatisfie vs againe: to be
ſo abaſed in our abuſe, that yet
we can be more abaſed, in renouncing
our owne righteouſnes,
becauſe we are corrupt; and
yet the more ab
                  •
               ſed, in giuing
the Lord the onely glorie
of all his free mercies, by
reſting alone vpon CHRIST,
for the acceptance of well doing:
Thus muſt we abaſe our ſelues,
to preuēt ſatans abaſing.
            6. Laſtly, let vs conſider,
that if wee make not our ſelues
poore, to preuent ſecuriritie
and vnthankfulnes, Our

God will abaſe vs, and that
many wayes, 1 both denying
comfort of his graces: Yea,
2 Taking them from vs,
               How God abaſeth his children, and why. yea,
leauing vs to reproachefull and
groſſe offences: yea, yeelding vs
to the ſmiting of a wounded ſpivite,
and ſhal we not then preſerue
peace of conſcience, by
abaſing our ſelues? ſhall wee
not preuent the reproach of our
profeſſion?
               Comfort in the practiſe of this. ſhal we not preſerue
the comfortable vſe of Gods
bleſſings? yea, ſhall wee not
take down the pride of our harts,
that the graces of God may
not be taken from vs?
            Well, let theſe motiues ſerue
to prouoke vs to this holie
wiſedome, comforting our ſelues,
that we can neuer be loſers
at Gods hands, if he winne glory
by our abaſing of our ſelues:
            
            
               
2 Nay the more we looſe,
in conceite of Gods bleſſings,
the more we ſhall gaine in the
vſe of them, the more we ſhall
reape c

                  mfort by them.
            And therefore, in the feare
of God, let vs ſet vpon the
practiſe of this dutie: And

in all things, and accō

            THus haſt thou (Chriſtian

ſuch Meditations which
it hath pleaſed my good God
to impart vnto mee, concerning
the Eſtates of the Hypocrite
and ſyncere Chriſtian, as
alſo of their ſeuerall wiſdomes,
in Husbanding their Eſtates:
My harts deſire is, that thou
wouldeſt laye theſe thinges
cloſe into thy heart: neither
ſtūbling at the want of complement,
which my leiſure
and weaknes, yea indeede the
matter it ſeſfe, would not afford,

or at ſuch obſcuritie,
which partly the briefe hādling,
but eſpecially the matter
being experimentall, may
giue occaſion vnto: But in
the name of God, Iudge wiſely
of my drift heerein. And
labour with thy God in prayer,
that thou maiſt ſ

               und the
depth thereof. And ſeeing
thou wilt hardly plough without
my hayfare, therefore let
this experience be a meanes
to prouoke thee to diſcerne
thine eſtate: And ſo buy thou

wiſely to heale what
we haue raſhly wounded: and
to wound more deeply, what
in carnall wiſdome we would
cure. That ſo, ſound peace may
redound to our Church, and
comfort to our ſoules: Is
it not more then time, now

to couer the nakednes of
our mother, whom we haue
vnnaturally ſtripped, both
of credit and maintenance,
reproching her as an harlot
& ſo worthy to be diſpoiled?
might we not doe well to
recouer her credit, by diſcouering
our owne nakednes?
Our ignorāce in ſpeaking euil
of the things we know not,
or haue not bene able to diſcerne,
our pride in cenſuring
what wee haue no calling to
amend, our curioſitie, in ſeeking
a knot in a ruſh, our
Hypocriſie, in ſtumbling at
ſtrawes and leaping ouer
blockes, our vnthankefulnes
in not acknowledging the
good things we enioy, our

            What ſhould I ſay? haue
wee bene free from malice
and birternes in our cenſuring
and deprauings, condemning
callings for perſonall
abuſes, & exaſperating
the Magiſtrate by our preſumtuous
importunitie and
inſolēt calumniations, hath
not our incōſtancie & differences
diſcouered apparantly
the matter of our Building?
hath it not brought
diſtraction and confuſion
to our ſelues, and others?
hath not our carnalnes and
couetouſnes in the manner
of our building, each ſeeking
to build vp himſelfe
with the ruines of his mother,
and yet vnder pretence

to repaire the ſame? Hath
not this diſcouered ye
                plague
in our hearts while we haue
ſought to remoue the plague
in our Churches.
            And is not the Lord exceeding
mercifull thus to
bring to paſſe, that we haue
wiſely diſcouered our owne
ſoares, while we haue vnwiſely
labored to launce the diſeaſes
of our mother, that ſo
we might be either forced to
ſeeke helpe for our ſelues, &
ſo hereby giue ſome reſt vnto
the Church of God, or

not in my skill, this will be

the beſt way to procure
peace abroad, is to maintain
warre at home. If each could
diſcerne how much he had
to doe heere, he ſhould rather
craue the helpe of the
Church for his priuate cure,
then to vndertake a publike
cure which doth not concerne
him.
            The Lord open our eyes
that we may ſee our owne
nakednes, that ſo finding
how bad we are, we may eſteeme
of other better then
ourſelues, eſpecially whom
the Lord hath in mercie ſet

is commanded in the Lord,

and all patient ſubiection to
