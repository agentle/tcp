               Somtime the Scriptures I perusd;

               And sayd, yf you regard your health:
               out of this Lane you get
               And shift you to some better aire.
               for feare to be infect:
               With noysome smell and sauours yll,
               I wysh on that respect.
               And haue regard vnto your health,
               or els perhaps you may:

               and this for answer gaue:
               I'le neither shun, nor seeke for death,
               yet oft the same I craue,
               By reason at my lucklesse lyfe,

               For he was hastyng out of Towne,
               and could no longer byde:
               And I went home, all sole alone,

               and made mée pleasures féele.
               For she so Plat his Plot mée brought,
               where fragrant Flowers abound:

               with euery goodly Flower:
               And Bankes and Borders finely framde,
               I mée reposde one howre.
               And longer wolde, but leasure lackt,

               Though loth: yet at the last I went,
               but ere I parted thence:
               A slip I tooke to smell vnto,
               which might be my defence,
               In stynking stréetes, or lothsome Lanes

               and he no whit shall want.
               
                  And for my part, I may be bolde,
               to come when as I wyll:
               Yea, and to chuse of all his Flowers,
               which may my fancy fill.
               And now I haue a Nosegay got,
               that would be passing rare:
               Yf that to sort the same aright,
               weare lotted to my share,
               But in a bundle as they hée,
               (good Reader them accept:
               It is the geuer: not the guift,
               thou oughtest to respect,
               And for thy health, not for thy eye,
               did I this Posye frame:
               Because my selfe dyd safety finde,
               by smelling to the same,
               But as we are not all alyke,
               nor of complexion one:
               So that which helpeth some we sée.
               to others good doth none,
               I doo not say, it dyd mée help,
               I no infection felt:
               But sure I think they kept mée free,
               because to them I smelt.
               And for because I lyke them well,
               and good haue found therby:
               I for good wyll, doo gaue them thée,
               fyrst tast and after trye.
               But yf thy mind infected be,
               then these wyll not preuayle:
               
                  Sit Medicus with stronger Earbes,
               thy maliadye must quayle
               For these be but to keepe thée sound,
               which if thou vse them well:
               (Paynes of my lyfe) in healthy state
               thy mind shall euer dwell;
               Or if that thy complexion,
               with them doo not agree:
               Refer them to some friend of thine,
               tyll thou their vertue sée.
               And this I pray the, whether thou,
               infected wast afore:
               Or whether with thy nature strong;
               they can agree no more,
               That thou my Nosegay not misuse,
               but leaue it to the rest:
               A number may such pleasure finde,
               to beare it in their brest.
               And if thy selfe wolde gather more,
               then I have herein bound:
               My counsell is that thou repayre,
               to Master Plat his ground,
               And gather there what I dyd not,
               perhaps thy selfe may light:
               On those which for thee fitter are,
               then them which I resighte.
               Which if thou doo, then render thanks,
               to him which sowed the soyle,
               Yf not, thou nedes must him commend,
               when as thou viewest his toyles
               
                  In any wise, be chary that
               thou lettest in no Swine:
               No Dog to scrape, nor beast that doth
               to rauin styll inclyne,
               For though he make no spare of them,
               to such as haue good skyll:
               To slip, to shere, or get in time,
               and not his braunches kyll:
               Yet barres he out, such gréedy guts,
               as come with spite to toote:
               And without skill, both Earb & Flower
               pluck rashly by the roote.
               So wishing thée, to finde such Flowers,
               as may thée comfort bring:
               And eke that he which framd the Plot,
               with vertues styll may spring.
               I thée commend to mighty IOVE,
               
               and thus I thée assure:
               My Nosegay wyll increase no payne,
               though sicknes none it cure,
               Wherfore, if thou it hap to weare
               and feele thy selfe much worse:
               Promote mée for no Sorceresse,
               nor doo mée ban or curse.
               For this I say the Flowers are good,
               which I on thee bestow:
               As those which weare them to the stalkes,
               Shall by the sequell know.
               
                  One word, and then adieu to thée,
               yf thou to Plat his Plot
               Repayre: take héede it is a Maze
               
               to warne thée I forgot.

                  from thee ah famous Citie:
                  
                     I neuer yet to rue my smart,
                  did finde that thou hadst pitie,
                  Wherefore small cause ther is, yt I
                  should greeue from thee go:
                  But many Women foolyshly,
                  lyke me, and other moe,
                  Doe such a fyxed fancy set,
                  on those which least desarue,
                  That long it is ere wit we get,
                  away from them to swarue,
                  But tyme with pittie oft wyl tel
                  to those that wil her try:
                  Whether it best be more to mell,
                  or vtterly defye.
                  And now hath time me put & mind,
                  of thy great cruelnes:
                  That neuer once a help wold finde,
                  to ease me in distres.
                  Thou neuer yet, woldst credit geue
                  to boord me for a yeare:
                  Nor with Apparell me releue
                  except thou payed weare.
                  No, no, thou neuer didst me good,
                  nor euer wilt I know:
                  
                     Yet am I in no angry moode,

                  as I in it recyte.
                  Now stand a side and geue me leaue
                  to write my latest Wyll:
                  And see that none you do deceaue,
                  of that I leaue them tyl.

                  And Bedlem must not be forgot,

                  Now London haue I (for thy sake)

                  let them dispearced hee.
                  And though I nothing named haue,
                  to bury mae withall:
                  Consider that aboue the ground,

                  And let me haue a shrowding Sheete

                  And in obliuyon bury mée

                  I make thée sole executor, because

                  And thée I put in trust, to geue

                  Which well wyll serue to fetch and bring,
                  such things as néede to thée.
                  ¶Wherfore (good London) not refuse,
                  for helper her to take:
                  Thus being weake and wery both
                  an end heere wyll I make.
                  To all that aske what end I made,
                  and how I went away:
                  Thou answer maist like those which héere,
                  no longer tary may.
                  And vnto all that wysh mée well,

                  Doo me comend, and bid them cease
                  my absence for to mone.
                  And tell them further, if they wolde,
                  my presence styll haue had:
                  They should haue sought to mend my luck;
                  which euer was too bad.
                  So fare thou well a thousand times,
                  God shéelde thée from thy foe:
                  And styll make thée victorious,
