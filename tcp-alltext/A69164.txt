            VVHEREIN IS MAnifeſtly proued out of the Works of that Learned Father, that he diſſented from Popery, and agreed with the Religion of the Proteſtants in all the maine Points of Faith and Doctrine.
            Contrary to that Impudent, Erronious, and Slanderous Poſition of the bragging Papiſts of our Times, who falſely affirme, we had no Religion before the Times of Luther and Caluine.

            And now you poore ſeduced ſoules, why do your holy Fathers conſtrain you to beleeue ye know not what? and reſtraine you from the knowledge of Scripture? (whence your faith if it be ſound▪ muſt be truly collected) and the ignorance wherof is the root of all Math. 2

            But yet ſuch is the impudency of your falſe prophets, that notwithſtanding, they will tell you, that they teach nothing without the ſpeciall warrant of

Scripture, and that all the Fathers were Papiſtes, and helde their opinions: both which are their owne fictions, and falſe. For the firſt, they will neither abide the triall of our faith by the Word of God, (which was the reaſon that See the Fisher caught in his ovvne net.
               Fiſher in his laſt Conference, neither could nor would deny, that the Proteſtants profeſſed the ſame faith which Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught) nor yet of their owne religon; and the reaſon is, becauſe it wholly depends vpon the Traditions of the new Romiſh Church, which is confirmed by Can. Greg. d. 40. in an. marg.
               Gregorie the thirteenth, where hee ſayth, Let men receiue with more reuerence, what the Pope teacheth, then the Scriptures. And Canus loc. l. 3 cap. 3. pag. 131
               Canus confeſſeth, that moſt poynts of the Romane Faith, are not contained in the Scripture: And Andrad. Orthod. expl. li. 2.
               Andradius ſpeakes plainly, that many poynts of their Faith muſt needes reele and totter, if they were not ſupported by the helpe of Tradition; and this is the cauſe your Maſſe-prieſtes will not endure, that the Reſolution of the now depending Controuerſies betweene vs and them, ſhould be by the authoritie of the Scriptures, but runne from them to the Fathers, from them to the Church, fromthence to the Pope, from him to Councels, and from theſe to their owne Iudgements.

               Kelliſon. Yet St. Auſtin was of our opinion herein. Saint Auſtin thought not good to follow the Fathers any further, neither did he require that any man ſhould follow him any further. He as we tooke libertie, and gaue libertie to iudge of the Fathers writings according to their agreement, or diſagreement with holy Scriptures.
            That he tooke libertie to himſelfe to iudge ſo, it appeares by this: That when he was preſſed by Creſconius the Grammarian with a Teſtimony taken out of an Epiſtle of Saint Cyprians, 
               Lib. 2. cont. Creſcon. Gram. cap. 32.

I am not bound to ſtand to be tryed by that Epiſtle, becauſe I do not account of Cyprians Epiſtles as of Canonicall Scriptures, but examine thē by the Canonicall Scriptures: and what I finde in them agreeable to the holy Scriptures, I receiue it with his commendation: what I finde to diſagree from holy Scriptures, with his good leaue, I leaue it.

Origen, Didimus, Apollinaris, Alexander, Euſebius Emiſenus, Theodorus, and Chryſoſtom; of which Fathers, Ierom made ſo great account, that he deſired Auſtin to ſuffer him to erre with them, if he thought him to erre. Auſtin would not yeeld to Jerom, though hee could but name two Fathers who were of his minde, but appeales to Saint Paul himſelfe from all Saint Ieroms Fathers, ſaying:

To this I anſwer briefly, That that which is offered and conſecrated by the Prieſt, is called a Sacrifice and an offering, becauſe it is a remembrance and repreſentation of the true Sacrifice and holy Offering made on the Altar of the Croſſe, grounding his concluſion vpon other teſtimonies in Ju Pſal.

Hee and his fellow Biſhops held, that the copies of the Nicen Canons which were ſent them from Alexandria and Conſtantinople, in which there were 20 Canons onely, were the trueſt copies. For this teſtimony is ſo euident, that the Papiſts haue no way to auoid it handſomely, but are driuen to ſay rudely, Stapleton Relect. Controu. 3. q. 7. ad 1 Arg. pag. 412.

               Smith, Reader of Diuinity in Oxford, in Queene Maries dayes, could ſhape no better anſwer vnto it, then this: viz.

Nam Auguſt: non tantùm aperte dicit ſed etiā contendit, &c. To the Argument (ſaith he) taken from the teſtimonies of the ancient Writers, my anſwer is; That in my opinion, many of them thought a ſolemne vow did not make a nullitie of mariage: for Auſtin doth not onely ſay ſo much in plaine termes, but hee confidently auowes it for a certaine truth, &c.

But we ſay this doctrine of theirs is not true. After this life there is no place for any but either in heauen with Chriſt, or in Hell with the Deuill. And of this minde was S. Auſtin; for, Nec eſt vllus vlli medius locus vt poſſit eſſe niſi cum diabolo, qui non eſt cum Chriſto. There is no third place left for any, but hee muſt needes be with the Deuill, who is not with Chriſt, To. 7. de de pecat. Merit. & Remiſſ. lib. 1. cap. 28. See de verb. Apoſtoliſer. 4. & lib. 5.

And ſo did S. Auſtin. For conſidering he read in Scripture, that there was a great Gulfe betweene the rich man in Hell, and Lazarus in Abrahams boſome, and hee could neuer finde that the name of Hell was vſed in good part, in any part of Scripture. he Epiſtola 57. & 99. & de Gen. ad literam lib.concluded that Abrahams boſome, which is the ſame with that which Papiſts call Limbus patrum, was (queſtionleſſe) no part of Hell, for which he is reprooued by Comment in Act. 2. 24.

58 The Ioh. de Pariſiis de poteſtate Regia & papali, cap. 3. Stapleton Antidot. in Euang. Ioh. 10.
               Papiſts teach, That the words Iohn 10. 16. There ſhall be one flocke, and one ſhepheard, are not ment of Chriſt, but of the Pope. But we teach the contrary. And ſo did S. Auſtin, Tract. 47. in Ioh. and Ser. 49. de verbis Domini.

               Baronius is ſo much offended, that he ſticks not to ſay, S. Auſtin did therein A linea Catholicae ſides aberrare, & in lapidem offenſionis incurrere, Swerue from the Catholike faith, and ſtumble vpon the ſtone of offence.
            60 The Rhem. annot. in Heb. 11. 21.
               Papiſts teach, That Iacob adored the top of his ſonne Ioſephs rod, Heb. 11. 21. But we ſay Iacob worſhipped not Ioſephs rod, but that leaning vpon his owne rod, by reaſon of his weakneſſe, he adored God. Now that S. Auſtin ſo expounds the place, our Loco citato.Rhemiſts are forced to confeſſe.
            61 The Rhem. annot. in Heb. 13. 16.
               Papiſts ſay, That the words Heb. 13. 16. ſhould be tranſlated, God is promerited: we ſay, God is well pleaſed. Now that S. Auſtin is on our ſide, it is witneſſed by 
                  Lib. 10. 65.

In antiquis, placetur Deo, vtrumque melius quam quò modò vulgo habemus, promeretur deus. In the ancient copies (ſaith he) we reade, God is pleaſed, both readings being better then the common reading, God is promerited.
