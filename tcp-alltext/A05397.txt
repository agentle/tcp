preached the thyrd

and his honorable
Counsell,

                  ☞Anno Domini.

            In nomine Iesu Christi.
            
               GOD be mercyfull
vnto vs: For the
tyme is euen nowe
comynge, when as
God muste needes
eyther of his mercy
here in Englande, worcke suche a
wonderfull miracle vnto our conforte,
as farre passeth mans expectacion:
or els of his righteousnes
take such vengeaunce of this land
to the example of all other landes,
as shal be to our vtter distrucciō.
            Ye know, that immediatly after
the preachynge of Noe, came the
great floud that drouned ye world.
After the warnyng of Loth, came
fyre, & brimstone vpon the Sodomites
and Gomorrians. When
Moises had declared Gods thretngynes
in Egipt, kynge Pharao
and his people were plaged vpon
the lande, & drouned in the red sea.
            Suche plages came euer wher

gods worde truly preached, is not
beleued, receaued, and folowed.
But it the preachyng of Ionas,
the Niniuites repented wonderfully.
When the boke of the lawe
was reade vnto Iosias the kinge,
he, with all his people spedely repentynge,
found exceadyng mercy
blessynge, and grace: as lykewyse
all other shalbe sure to find, which
heare the worde of god & kepe it.
            For when Christ and his Apostles
had preached the gospell vnto
the Iewes, those that beleued
were delyuered frome the curse of
the law, vnto the blessing of grace
out of worldly miserye, to be inheritours
of the heuenly kingdome:
and those that did not beleue, were
cast from god, oppressed of men,
ouercome, spoyled, murthered, and
destroyed of their enemies.
            Wherefore Englande, whyche
at his presente tyme, by reason of

the worde of god set fourth, reade,
preached, and comuned, dothe in
euery place heare ye coūcel of Noe,
the warning of Loth, the lawe of
Maises, the threatnings of ye Prophetes,
and the grace of the gospel,
as it was declared and taught
by Christ and his Apostles: This
Englande muste nedes, either by
beleuynge of these thyngs, obteine
of god wonderful grace of amēdmente,
or els by neglectinge them,
prouoke the vengeance of god, as
a dewe plage and punyshment.
            Take heede therfore England,
for if thou by vnbelefe, let & stop
god from workynge of miracles
to thy comforte, then surely doest
thou prouoke god to powre doun
vengeaunce vpon the, to thy vtter
distruccyon: But if thou doo regarde,
receaue, and beleue goddes
worde, he wyll worke wonderfull
miracles to thy conforte, wealthe,

and prosperitie. Yea, let euerye
man, of what estate or degree soeuer
he be, grope his owne conscience:
for if he dooe not there fele
that the worde of God dothe take
place to moue him to repentaunce
and amendment of lyfe, then shall
he be sure sone to haue experience,
that the vengeaunce of God, by a
shameful shorte ende of his wretched
lyfe, wyll bring him vnto an
euerlastynge dampnable deathe.
For all those that wyll not crepe
vnder the merciful wings of god,
as the chikinnes of Christ, shal be
caught & deuoured of puttockes,
haukes, and kytes, as a praye for
the deuyll. The wynges of God
be stretched abrode here in Englande,
by the kinges gracious maiestye
and hys honorable counsel,
or mighty power, with ready wyll
to shadowe, defende, and saue all
those that with reuerēt loue, come

hūbly crepinge vnder their ordynaūce,
rule, & gouernāce, which is ye
power, ye wings & the honor of god.
            The filthye gredy puttockes,
wylde haukes, and rauenyng kytes,
be supersticious papistes, carnall
gospellers, and sedicyous rebelles,
whych as ye haue seene by
late experience, haue most cruelly
caught, spoyled, and deuoured the
lambes, the chekynnes, the chyldren
of God, redemed & boughte
with Christes bloude. Wherefore
as Christ in his owne person dyd
once lamente and bewayle Ierusalem,
so doeth he nowe many tymes
in the persons of his propheticall
Preachers, lament & bewayl
Englande, saying: O Englande,
howe ofte wold I haue gathered
thy chyldren, as a hen gathereth
her chikens vnder her wynges, &
thou wouldest not? Euen wyth the
same affeccion that the shepeherde

cryeth, seeyng the wolfe leryng towardes
the shepe, & with the same
affecciō that the hen clocketh and
calleth, spyeng the kyte houeryng
ouer her chekyns: wyth the same
affeccion it behoueth the minister
and preacher of god, seeynge vntollerable
vengeance hangynge
ouer Englande, to crye, to cal, and
to geue warnyng vnto the people
saying as is writē in ye first of Esay:
If ye willingly wil heare & obey,
ye shal eate the good confortable
frutes of ye earth: but if ye wyl
not, & prouoke me vnto anger, the
sword shal deuour you: Quia os Domini
locutum est. For it is ye mouth
of the lord that hath spoken.
            Now your reuerende maiesty,
most gracyous kyng, and you honourable
wyse godly counsellers,
you are the chiefe shepeherds, you
are the most reuerende fathers in
Christe, hauynge the wynges of

power and authoritye, to shadow,
saue, & keepe these lambes of god,
these chekens of Christe, and these
chyldrē of the heauenly father, redemed
wyth Christes bloude, and
cōmitted vnto your handes, to be
saued, kepte, and prouyded for.
            God be praysed, with thankful
obedience, and louynge reuerence
dewe to your gracious maiesty &
honorable counsell, whyche haue
surely wysely prouyded for, dylygently
kept, and charitably saued
this realme, by driuing awaye the
wylde foxe of papisticall supersticion,
and by castynge out the vncleane
spirit of ignoraūce, to gods
glorye, your honor, & our conforte.
            But alas most gracious Kyng
and godly gouernors, for the tender
mercyes of god, in oure Sauiour
Iesu Christ, take good and
diligent heed when ye be▪ chasyng
the wylde fox of papisticall supersticion,

that the gredye wolfe of
couetous ambicion, do not creepe
in at your backes: For surely he
wyll doo more harme in a weeke,
then the foxe did in a yere.
            Take hede, yt the vncleane spirit of
ignorāce, returning with vii. other
worse then hym selfe, find no place
vnwarded, wher he may crepe in againe.
For if he returning wt his felowes,
enter in agayne, then wil he
make the ende of this generacion
to be worse then the beginnynge.
Then shall you leese the rewarde
of your former dilygence, and be
damned for your later negligence.
Then shal the welspring of mercy
which of long tyme hath watered
this Realm with the grace of god,
be closed vp, and the blody flouds
of vengeance gushing out frō the
wrath & indignacion of God, ouer
flow al togither. Thē wil not god
by workinge of miracles declare

mercy, but by takynge of vengeaunce
execute rightousnes.
            But God beyng as mercyfull
yet, as euer he was, if you contynewe
as faythful, wise, and dylygente
as ye haue bene to handle
the wolfe, as you haue done the
foxe, to keepe out the denyll, as to
cast out the deuyll: then shall the
people of this lāde feede in quyetnes,
wtout feare of euyl: then shall
you continuyng to thende, be sure
of an hunderdfold reward in thys
lyfe, and afterwardes, euerlasting
lyfe, iaye and glorye. Then shall
God do wonderfull myracles in
Englande, to declare howe mercy
shall triumphe ouer rightousnes.
            And that wee maye all dyspose
our selues the more conuenientlye
for god to worke suche a miracle
amonge vs, wee haue appoynted
for the gospel of this day, wrytten
in the .vi. of Iohn, a wonderfull

miracle of .v. thousande men, fed
and satisfied wyth .v. loaues and
ii. fyshes, wheras euery man maye
& ought to learne his owne dutye,
which shall cleare appeare too a
king in Christ, to head gouerners
vnder the kynge, in the Apostles
beyng most neare about Christ, &
to all other men, in that multitude
of the people, whyche folowynge
Christ, were obedient to syt downe
at the cōmaundemēt of his Disciples,
not knowing, nor enquiring
why they were so commaunded.
            And as surely as this wōderful
miracle was done to ye great cōfort
of thēin Christs time, so truly is it
left in writyng for to learne vs by
paciēce & cōfort of ye Scriptures,
to haue good hope at thys time.
            An as Christ, hauing alwaies special
respect vnto his audiēce, dyd
teach the fishers by talking of nettes,
preaching vnto the Iewes by

diuers parables, & called the Gē
               tiles
by the eloquence of Paule: so
I, in handlyng of this miracle, hauing
respect vnto thys audyence,
wyl aply the wonderful great charitable
prouision of Christe, vnto
the Kynges Maiestye: the fayethful
diligence of the Apostles, vnto
the nobilitie: and the dewe obedyence
and hertye thankfulnes of
the multitude, vnto all other of
the communaltye. Not doubtyng
but that charitable prouisiō of liberall
benefytes, wyll be a thynge most
pleasaunt and honorable for
the Kynges Gracious Maiestye:
& faythfull diligence in disposing
great benefits most cōueniēt, & cō
               mēdable
for al that be in high authority:
& finally, humble obediēce
& vnfained thākfulnes to be most
necessary, requisite, & loked for at
this tyme, in all inferiours & commune
sort of people in Englande.
            
               
Marke a litle after the begynning
of the sixt Chap. of Iohn, &
ye shal heare, whē as much people
eate, what Iesus did. I wil passe ye
discripcion of the wildernes wt the
causes & the maner of the peoples
going togither, & begin at ye which
Christe dyd, when they were cummyng
towardes hym.
            
               IEsus lifting vp his
eyes, and seeynge
muche people come vnto
hym, sayde vnto Philyp:
From whence shall wee
bye bread, that these may
eate? Thys he sayd temptyng
him: for he him self
knew what he would do.
Philippe answered vnto
hym: Two hundreth penye
worth of breade wyll

not be sufficiēt vnto these
so that euerye one myght
take a lytell. One of hys
discyples Andrew, Simō
Peters brother, sayeth vnto
hym: There is one
boye here, whych hath .v.
barely loaues & .ii. fyshes,
but what ar those amongest
so many? Iesus sayd
Make the mē to syt doun.
Ther was muche grasse
in the place. The men
therfore sat doune about
the nūber of .v. thousādes
Iesus tooke the breade, &
after thankes geuynge,
did diuide it vnto hys disciples,
and the dyscyples

to them that were sette▪
And lykewyse of the fyshes,
so muche as they
woulde. And when they
were filled, he sayed vnto
his disciples: Rather vp
the brokē meates remaynyng,
that nothynge bee
lost. They gathered therfore,
& fylled .xii. baskettes
full of those meats which
remayned, after that the
hadde eaten. The men
therfore seeynge what a
signe Iesus hadde done
sayde that thys is truly
the Prophet whyche cummeth
vnto the world.
            
               
               O Mercyfull Lorde, what a
grefe is it to se those which
a man loueth hartely, with
suche diseases infected, that euerye
thinge ministred by the Phisicion
to do them good, by theyr own vnquietnes
& misusinge of the same
doth encrease theyr greuous daungerous
sicknes? For these people,
hauing great occasion of comfort,
by reason yt in this place, throughe
the true preaching of gods worde,
al sinne is playnly and frely rebuked,
and those thinges especiallye
whiche dooe appertayne vnto magystrates,
wherby anye man of indifferent
iudgemente, maye thinke
that these magistrates beinge presente,
and willingelye hearynge, be
purposed to amende: These people
I say, that thus haue a greate
occasion of comforte offered vnto
them, by theyr owne mistakinge of
it, dooe tourne all to theyr further

gryefe and daunger. For they
speake vnreuerently, and vntruly
slaunder the magistrates, not only
with the faultes that bee here named,
but also with rebukynge, imprisoninge,
and forbiddinge of the
Preachers. And when as by the
same mouth of the true preacher,
theyr venemous tounges be rebuked,
thē they spare not to say, that
the Preacher hath learned his lesson
in Iacke an apes court: doing
as much as lyeth in them, to make
other men, neither to reuerence the
magistrates, nor beleue the Preacher.
What they them selfes mean
thereby, peraduenture by reason
of blyndenesse; they wot not. But
we knowinge the craft of the deuill,
as Paul writeth .ii. Cor. ii. perceiue
that he would haue nothing
in thys place layed to the Rulers
charge: Not fearynge howe muche
be spoken to those of the people,

whiche be past any amendment by
words: But al yt the deuil feareth,
is lest that the rulers be put in remembraunce
of the greate daunger
that thei be in, for suffring to great
enormities vnpunished amongest
the people.
            I therfore trusting to do most
good in that whiche the deuyll laboureth
the most to hinder, wyll
laye great and many fautes vnto
them that haue most power, & authorytye.
For sure I am, that rulers
ordeyned of God to see the ignoraunte
instructed, and the euyll
punyshed, be in greate daunger of
Gods vengeaunce, for the greate
and manifold enormytyes whiche
do grow and spryng of ignorance
for lacke of knowledge, & of dissolutenes
for lacke of due correccion.
            And you people be ye sure that
the more theyr daunger is, for lack
of prouision and punishmente for

other mens faultes, the greater is
the damnacion of them that cōmit
and do these faultes.
            Nowe I trustinge to God, and
not fearinge the deuyll, wyll proceade
to declare and applye thys
parte of scripture vnto thys Audyence,
so that for no man I wyll
cloke or flatter any vyce.
            Iesus lyftnge vp hysepes, and seinge
muche people cummynge vnto hym. &c.
            Here note two thynges: in the
people note cōminge vnto Christ,
and in Christ, note charitable prouision
for the people. For in thys
people dothe Christ declare by example,
& proue in experyence hys
doctryne to be true, whiche he had
afore taught, sayinge: Fyrste seeke
for the kyngdome of God and the
ryghtuousnes thereof, and al these
other, meaninge necessaryes, shall
be ministred vnto you. For here
they folowinge Chryst, to seke the
kyngdome of God, had not only

this kingdome of God, this bread
of lyfe, thys worde of saluacion
preached vnto theim, but also all
theyr diseases healed, & their hungry
bellies with good meates plē
               tifully
filled.
            Yea the plentye of these people
hauinge inoughe euen so muche
as they woulde, was farre more
then the plentie of crafty Lawers,
disceitful Merchauntes, couetous
greedyguttes, & ambicious prollers,
whiche canne neuer haue inough:
but alwayes continewe in
vnsaciable hunger, and nede of
couetousnes. As the .xiiii. Psal. declareth:
Diuites eguerunt: The riche
haue felt nede & hunger: but they
which seke ye lord lacke no goodes.
            He that seeketh to be ryche, be
he neuer so poore a slaue, or so
myghtyea Lorde, he falleth into
dyuers temptacions and snares of
the deuyll: but they that seeke the

Lorde, shall lacke no goodnes.
            Seeke for to be rich, & thou shalt
fynd sorow, mysery, and mischiefe:
Seeke for to be godlye, and thou
shalt find coufort, welth, and prosperitie,
with al maner of felicity.
            If thou wilt be godly, thou must
folowe Chryst: thou must not folow
the steppes of hys fete, which
be taken vp into heauen out of
thy syghte, but thou oughtest to
folow the doctryne of hys worde,
which is here left vpon carthe, to
guyde the steppes of thy lyfe, in
the way of peace. And whyther
wyll goddes word gyde the in the
tyme of thy trouble and necessytye?
Surely vnto the Lorde, whych
saith: Propter miseriam inopum. &c. For
the miseryes sakes of the comfortlesse,
and syghynges of the poore,
now wyl I ryse, sayeth the Lorde.
            O Lorde, seeynge thou haste
manye people in Inglande, that

as yet be in myseryes without confort,
and in pouertye, and lacke
helpe, how dooest thou aryse vnto
them? Unto this the Lorde aunswereth,
in the .xxxiiii. of Ezechiel:
Suscitabo super eos pastorem unum. &c.
            
            I wyll set vp ouer theym one pastor,
euen my seruaunte Dauyd, he
shall feede theym, and he shall be
theyr pastor, and I the Lord wyll
be theyr God. Thys prophecye
was wrytten longe after Dauids
tyme. Wherefore by Dauid here
named, is sygnyfyed and meante
suche a Kynge as shalbe as faythfull
and diligent to kepe, feede, and
cherysh hys subiectes within hys
owne Realme, as was Dauid to
his people wythin Israell. Wee
hope, truste and beleue, that oure
gracions Kyng, indued wyth the
faythfull diligence of Dauid, is
ordeyned of God, to gouerne,
cherish and feede vs the people of

thys his realme. Wherefore accordinge
to the example of Chryst
Iesu, most Christē and Gracious
Kynge, for the reuerence of God,
which hath set you vpon the hygh
hyll of honor and authorytye, lyfte
vp your gracious eyes of charytable
pitie, and behold muche people
througheoute all Englande,
comminge to seke reliefe, ease and
comforte, sente frome God vnto
them, by your excellente Maiestye.
For althoughe there hathe bene to
much mercy shewed vpon the generacion
of vypers, the vngracious
rebelles: Yet is there manye
poore people, whiche lyke symple
sheepe, shorne to the bare skynne,
haue as yet lytle prouision & great
neede. Euen as .v. thousandes in
wildernes folowed Christ and his
Apostles, so manye thousandes in
Englande, past all other hope and
refuge, folowe your gracious maiestye

and honourable Counsel.
            For theyr parsons, whiche should
lyke shepheardes feede them, doo
lyke theues, robbe, murther and
spoyle them. And theyr landlordes
which shuld defend them, be moste
heauye maisters vnto them: Yea,
all maner of officers doo not theyr
duties to kepe the people in good
order, but rather take such fees as
maketh the people veraye poore.
Who so hathe eyes, and wyll see,
may easely perceiue that those personages,
which be most in number
and greateste in value throughout
al Englande, be no shepherds
houses to laye vp fodder to feede
the poore shepe of the parysh, but
theeuysh dennes, to conuey awaye
great spoyle from all the rych men
of the parysh. I say ther is no person
there, to releue the poore & nedy
with natural sustinaūce in kepynge
of house, and to fede all ingenerally

with the heauenly foode
of goddes worde by preachinge:
            But there is a persons deputy or
fermer, which hauing neither habilitye,
power, nor authorytye to
doo the persons dutye in feedyng
and teachinge the parish, is able,
sufficient, and stout inough to chalenge
and take for hys maysters
dutye the tenth parte of al the parysh.
Likewise other officers take
many fees, and do few dutyes: And
especiallye landlordes take exceadynge
fynes and rentes of theyr
tenauntes, and doo no good vnto
theyr tenauntes.
            Now my Lordes, bothe of the
laitie and of the clergy, in the name
of god, I aduertyse you to take
heede: for when the Lorde of all
Lordes shal se his flocke scattred,
spylte and loste, if he folowe the
trace of the bloude, it wyll leade
him euen streyght waye vnto thys

court, and vnto your houses, where
as these great theues which murther,
spoyl, and destroy the flockes
of Chryst, be receyued, kept, and
mainteined.
            For you maintain your chaplens
to take Pluralities, & youre other
seruaunts mo offices then they can
or wyl discharge.
            Fye for synne and shame, eyther
gyue your seruauntes wages,
or els let them go and serue those
which do gyue them wages. For
now your chaplaynes, your seruaunts,
& you your selues haue the
persons, the shepherds, & the offycers
wages, & nether you nor they,
nor other doth yt persons, the shepherds
or the officers duty, excepte
peraduēture ye imagin that ther is
a parishe priest, curate, which doth
the persons duti. But although ye
do so imagin, yet the people do feel
and perceiue that he doeth meane

no other thing but pay your duty,
pay your dutye. Yes forsouth he
ministreth Gods sacramentes, he
sayeth hys seruice, and he readeth
the homilies, as you fyne, flatring,
courtiers, which speake by imaginacion,
tearme it: But the rude
lobbes of the countrye, whiche be
to symple to paynte a lye, speake
foule and truly as thei finde it, and
saye. He minisheth Goddes sacramentes,
he slubbers vp his seruice
and he can not reade the humbles.
Yet is there some that canne reade
very well, but how many of those
be not either supersticious papystes,
or els carnall gospellers, whiche
by theyr euyll example of lyuyng,
and worse doctrine, do farre
more harme then they do good by
theyr fayre reading & saying of seruice.
But put the case, as it maye
be, that there be at a benefyce in
some place at somtime, some good

curate, all those summes wyll make
but a feewe in number, and yet
ye see many persons in manye places
absente from theyr benifices,
whiche if they be seldome absente,
may be good, but if they be contynually
or for the most part absent,
then can they be neither good, honest
nor godly. For if theyr dutye
be vndone, then can no man excuse
them: if it be done, then is it by other
and not by them: and then whye
dooe they lyue of other mennes laboures?
He that preacheth the gospell,
shoulde lyue vpon the Gospell,
as God hathe ordeyned: As
for those, Qui mollibus uestiuntur, in domibus
Regum, whyche goo gaye in
Kynges houses, and either mosell
the labouringe oxe, or els spoyl the
poore parish in the country, be of
the deuyls ordynaunce. As there
is in all offices some putte in by
Chryste, some by the deuyll: so is

there in personages, some sente
from Chryst as shepherdes to fede,
& some from the deuyll, as theues
to deuoure. Yea amongest all
kyndes of offycers, some be true
Prophetes and sheppeheardes in
dede, and some haue shepe skynnes,
and be raueninge wolues in dede.
The one taketh paynes in doyng
of hys dutye, and the other seketh
gaynes in professyng of hys duty.
Take heede of those, for they are erraunt
theeues.
            Alas, if all those whiche take
the names and professyons of offycers,
for desyre of luker and honor,
and do not execute the dutyes
belonginge to theyr offyces wyth
painful diligence, be errant theues
as they be in deede, then is ther mani
a strong erraunt theefe amongst
thē yt be called honest, worshipful,
and honorable men.
            For they haue the names, the

authorytyes & vauntages of those
offyces gyuen & payed vnto them,
the dutyes of the whyche be verye
slenderly or nothyng at al executed
amongest the people.
            If I were in anye other place
in al England, I could and wold
vse another trade of preachynge
afore another audience: but beinge
called of God by your appoyntement,
vnto this place at this tyme,
my conscience doth compell me to
vse this trade and no other, afore
this solemne audience. Wherfore
with dreede and feare of God, with
charitable pyty of the people, with
moste reuerend loue and homage
vnto your honors, I muste needes
cry wyth the Prophete Esaye:
            
               Principes Sodome, populus Gomorre: 
               ❧
Heare the woorde of the Lorde ye
Prynces of Sodome, ye people of
Gomorra: Quo mihi multitudo uictinarum
uestrarum. What care I for

the great number of your sacrifyces,
Dicit Dominus, sayth the Lord:
rebukyng all the sacrifices, Cerimonyes,
and feastes of the Iewes
which he him self had commaunded
to be obserued and kept: by
the which thyng left in wrytyng
he doth teach and commaund me
how to speake of your well doyng
here in England. Heare therfore
ye Prynces of Sodome, and ye
people of Gomor, thus sayth the
Lord: What pleasure haue I, yea
what care I for all your Englysh
Bibles, Homelies, & all your other
bookes? set forth no more godly seruice
to honor me wyth: I hate them
al wyth my herte, they are greuous
vnto me, I am wery of them: Yea,
it is a great payne for me to suffer
them. Why, O Lord these be good,
these be godly, and these be necessarye
thynges.
            Truthe it is, the faulte is not in

the things that be set forth, but in
you yt haue set them furthe. Manus
enim uestre plene sunt sanguine: For
your handes are ful of bloud.
            Your handes, your seruyce and
your houses be full of persons liuynges
preachers liuinges, and
offycers lyuynges. And by you,
the person hath his dyspensacion,
the preacher is put to scilence, and
the offycer vnpunyshed, for neglectynge
of hys dutye. And so
through the negligence of the kepers
(good order, which is ye pale
of the parke of this cōmunewelth
dekated) the dere therof most dearly
bought wyth Chrystes bloude,
haue strayed oute of theire owne
feedynge, to dystroye the corne of
all mens liuinges: Where as very
necessytye hath compelled you
with such force to driue thē backe,
as must needes distroye manye of
those dere. Those people I mean,

whych you haue cheryshed & kept
& as yet doo loue and pitie aboue
al other iewels, commodities and
pleasures. Alas, these that take
the liuinges, and doo not the dutyes
of Persons, Preachers, landlordes,
Bailyes, and of other officers:
These flaterers, these wolfes
in lābes skinnes, these deuils
in mens vysers, haue caused you
to be thought and taken as cruell
oppressers of those people, whose
furyous wylde rage ye dyd suppresse
and keepe vnder, of veraye
charitable pitie towardes them, &
all other, whyche wyth that rebellious
ragei shoulde haue be al togither
distroied, if the help of your
power and authoritye hadde bene
any longer differted.
            Surely, vntyl that these prollets
for them selues, these children
of the dyuell, these sowers of sedicion
be taken out of the way, either

by reformacion, or by distruccion,
your charitable pity and prouision
for the people, and theyr reuerend
loue & obedience towardes
you, shall neuer be sene, felte, and
knowen. Nowe, as Helye was
giltye of the whordome, extorcion,
and abhominacion of his sonnes,
so are youre hertes ful of crueltye,
and youre handes full of bloude,
not so muche by doyng, as by sufferynge
all these euyls. Wherfore
Lauamini, mundi estote: Wash, & make
your selues cleane, with the teares
of repentaunce. Auferte malum cogitacionum
uestrarum ab oculis meis: Away
wt the euyll of your thoughtes
from afore myne eyes. Open
youre heartes, that the sworde of
Gods word maye come to wipe awaye
couetousnes, whyche is the
roote of all euyll, planted in youre
hertes. For yf that roote contyneue
ther, than cā no good springe

from you: but euen the most pure
and holesome worde of God sette
forth by you continuinge in couitousnes,
wyll be abhominable in
the syghte of God, offensyue vnto
the people, & damnable vnto you
your selues. Wherefore, Quiescite
agere peruerse: Seasse to perucrte,
manye thynges from euyll vnto
worse. Discite benefacere: Learne to
do wel, in conforminge al thinges
that be a misse, vnto a good order.
Querite iudicium: Serche for ryghteous
iudgement which is almost
banyshed out of Englande. Alas
what a iudgemente is thys, a supersticious
papiste, whyche hath
made the faulte shall haue a pension
out of a Chauntrye, so longe
as he lyueth, and a poore parysh,
whych hath greate nede and done
no faulte shall lose and forfayte
many Chauntries vtterly for euer
Subuenite oppresso: Helpe the oppressed

people that be loaden with heuye
burdeyns of payinge wages
to manye offyces, and faynte for
lacke of releife, & dewe seruyce of
the offycer. Iudicate pupillo: Iudge
so to the fatherlesse chyldrens behofe,
that wardship mai be a good
prouision for fatherles chyldren,
and not an vncharitable spoyle of
yong mens lands. Defendite uiduam:
Shielde the widow from al mens
iniuryes, and compell them not to
mary your vnthrifty seruauntes.
            Thus hath God by Esaye in
hys tyme, and by me at thys tyme
described Rulers Faultes, wyth a
waye how to a mend them. Therfore,
Principes Anglie: Ye heade Rulers
and gouernors of England,
fyrste see, acknowledge, amende
your owne faultes: and then, perusynge
all vnder offycers, consyder
and note how few shepheards
and offyces doo feede and kepe▪
               
by doynge dutyes, and how many
theeues and wolfes do robbe and
spoyle the flockes, by takyng sees
here in Englande: and then shall
ye perceaue that there must nedes
be manye sheepe, that wyth theyr
hertes, myndes, and expectacion,
do folowe the Kynges Maiestye,
and you of hys honorable counsel
so farre past the houses and cities
of their owne prouysion, that if
they haue not spedy reliefe at your
handes, manye of theim is lyke to
fainte and decaye by the way.
            Therfore thys considered and
knowen, as Christ liftinge vp his
eyes dyd teach you to see and consyder
the people: so learne by that
whiche foloweth in Christes dooynge,
what shalbe your dutye after
that ye se and knowe the multitude,
the state and condicion of
the people.
            And he said vnto Philyp:

From whence shall
we bye breade, that these
maye eate? But thys he
sayde to proue hym: for he
hym selfe knewe what he
would do.
            Christ said to Philip as euerye
Christē Kyng ought to say to his
Counsell: From whence shall we
that be gouernors kepers and feders,
bye & prouyde with our own
costes, labor, and diligence, bread,
foode and necessaryes, that these
may eate and be relieued, which be
our subiects in obedience, brethrē
in Christ, and felow heyres of the
heauenly kyngdome?
            Pharao wyth Counsell in
Egypte, consulted howe to bryng
the welthy people vnto misery: so
that he is a very Pharonicall tyrāt,
whych laboureth by oppressiō
               
to thrust down the welthy people:
And he is a faithful christen king
that humbleth him self by diligēce
to releiue, conforte, and set vp the
afflycted people. For the one, by
worldly policy, would haue much
honor, and the other of godly charitie
wil do much good. Christ also
said this, to proue and trie Philip,
knowyng him self what shuld
be done. So that here, Kynges
and great men may learne to trye,
and proue the honestie, wit, and fidelitie
of theyr Coūsellers, in such
matters as they them selues be so
perfect that they can diserne wyth
what discrecion and mynd the coū
               seller
doth answere.
            Philip aūswered, that
two hūdreth peny worth
of breade wyll not serue
vnto these, so that euerye
one myghte take a lyttell
            
               
In the which answere, as concernynge
his witte, he declareth it
to be to slender to prouide for so
great a matter in so short tyme.
            And hys mynde semed to be suche
as would not haue Christ to trouble
hym selfe wyth so great cares
but rather as the other Euangelistes
do declare, to sende the people
away, and let them 
                  〈◊〉
                for
them selfes. The same minde and
affeccion was in Peter, after that
Christ hadde tolde hys Disciples
howe that we must go to Ierusalem
to suffer sore paines and miserable
death. For then Peter tooke
hym a syde and sayde: Mayster
fauour your self, doe not enter in
to such daunger and sorowes.
            And it is not vnlyke, but if youre
Magestye, wyth youre Counsell
speake vnto youre nobles for prouision
now to be made for the people:
ye shall fynde some that bee

Philippians and Peters, whyche
by settynge afore youre eyes the
hardnes of the matter, the tendernes
of your yeares, and the wonderfull
charges that should be requisite,
wyl moue and counsel you
to quyet youre selfe, to take youre
ease, yea to take your pastime, in
haukyng, Huntyng or gamnyng.
Unto whom your Magestie may
aunswer, as Christ dyd vnto Peter:
Auoyde fro me Sathan, thou
hyndrest me by thy carnall temptacion,
to doo that thyng whyche
God hath moued me vnto by hys
gracious inspiracion. Thou hast
no tast nor sauour howe delicious
God is vnto a pure conscience, in
Godly excercise of good worckes.
But al that thou regardest & felest
is voluptuous pleasure in worldly
vanities. And therefore yu doest
not perceiue, how yt they which be
indued with a special grace of god

may fynd more pleasure & pastime
in godly gouernaūce, to kepe togither
& saue simple mē, then in hauking
and huntynge, to chase and
kyll wylde beastes. Yea, a godly
kyng shall finde more pleasure
in castinge lots for Ionas, to trye
out offenders, whiche trouble the
ship of his commune wealth, then
in casting dice at hasarde, to alow
& maintaine by his example, such
thynges as should not be suffered
in a commune wealth. Yea surely,
a good King shal take farre more
delyte in edifiynge wyth conforte
and deckynge wyth good order
the Congregacion of hys people,
the Churche and house of God,
the heauenly Citye of Ierusalem,
then in buildinge suche houses as
seeme gaye and gorgeous, and be
in deede but vyle earthe, stones,
tymber and claye. Suche lyke
aunswer ought your Magestye, &
all noble men to make, if ye fynde

any of your Counsellers more carnal
than spiritual, more worldlye
then godly. Or els tourne awaye
your eares from such Philipians,
& heare other, as Christ did.
            Then saide vnto him
one of his Disciples, Andrew
Simon Peters brother,
Ther is a boye here
that hath fyue barely loaues
and two fyshes, but
what auaile those amōge
so manye?
            Note here that this boye was
the Apostles page, & these loues
and fishes were their vittayles.
For as appeareth in Marke, whē
thei had made search howe manye
loaues they them selues had, thys
answere was made, yt they had .v.
loues & .ii. fishes: but what be they
amōgest so many? As who should

say: although these be al yt euer we
haue & seme more mete to be kept
amongest a few, thē to be giuen to
many, yet for because thei yt becum
whyche beynge many haue more
nede then we: therefore ar we willinge
to giue thē to be disposed, &
wish yt they were of more value to
do more good amōgest ye people.
            These men cared more for the
Commune people, then they dyd
for them selues, and therfore were
very mete to be Counsellers, and
neare about a great Kyng.
            Here we perceyue what symple
Phylippe, and good Andrewe
thinke, but here is nothyng declared
of couetous Iudas counsell.
No, for Christ beynge fully purposed
to doo a good deede doeth
neither aske, nor heare anye counsell
of couetous Iudas: teachyng
all them whych intende any goodnes,
neuer to aske nor admit anye

counsel of those whom they know
to be couetous. For truely the couetous
mans councel, although it
seme neuer so good and honest, yet
is it in dede nought and deuilish.
For what could seme better counsel
then yt a litle ointmēt, the swete
smel of the whyche continued but
a while among a few, should haue
ben sould for thre hundreth pence,
the greate price of the whyche bestowed
amongeste manye poore,
should haue done them good for a
great season?
            The Euangelyst doeth shewe
howe that Iudas dyd gyue thys
counsell, not for that he had anye
care of the poore, but bycause he
was a thefe, and bare the bagges.
            Iudas pretence was wonders
godlye, to sell the oyntmente for a
great summe of moneye, to relieue
the poore wyth, but hys purpose
was deuelyshe, to get the mony in

hys bagges, and kepe it to hym selfe.
And those in England whyche
dyd pretende, that besides the
abolishinge of supersticion, wyth
the landes of Abbeys, Coliges
and Chauntries, the King should
be enryched, learnynge mayntayned,
pouertye relieued, and the cō
               mune
wealthe eased, and by thys
pretence purposely haue enriched
theym selues, settynge a brode incloystered
papistes, to get their liuinges
by giuing them pencions,
yea, and thrustynge them into benefices
to poyson the whole commune
welth for the risignacion of
those pencions: & so craftly cōueying
much frō the King, frō lerning
from pouertye, & from al the commune
wealth, vnto their own priuate
vauntage: These mennes
counsell semed better then Iudas
counsell was: and their couetousnes,
by their owne deedes appeareth

no lesse then Iudas couetousnesse
dyd. Well, beware, for if ye
play Iudas part on styll, & make
no restitucion, vntil ye go to hangyng,
ye are lyke to fynde desperaciō
at the end of your life, because
ye wold not by restitucion amend
your life. Ye noble mē, & especialli
you of the kings coūsel, for the reuerence
of God, pitie of the cōmen
wealth, and safegarde of your selfes,
awaye wyth these Iudasses,
let them go hange them selues: excepte
perauenture ye thyncke it
fytte and necessary, that you fyrst
hang them afore thei betray you.
For vndoutedly, he that hath the
couetousnes of Iudas in his hert
he wyll playe all the other partes
of Iudas, if he euer haue suche
oportunitie as Iudas had.
            A way with Iudas, and learne at
Andrew, to saye vnto thys kynge
and his councel intendynge to releiue

the multitude of hys people
here in Englande, learne ye noble
men to saye: Here is a boye, Here
be seruauntes and retayners of
oures whyche haue fyue loaues
and two fyshes, manye benefices,
some prebendes, wyth dyuers offyces:
yea, and some of vs our selues
haue mo offyces then we can
discharge. Pleaseth it your maiestie
to take these into your hands,
which haue bene kept for vs, that
they now in thys great nede, maye
be better disposed amongest youre
people. Quid hec inter tantos? These
be verye small thynges towardes
the amendemēt of so many lackes
in so great a multitude. How be it
these wyl serue, so that there maye
be mo good Persons, good preachers,
and good officers placed a
brode in euery countrye, which in
doing theyr offices, keping of houses,
and preachyng of gods worde

may teach the ignoraunte, relieue
the poore, punyshe the fautye, and
cheryshe the honest, and so repayre
the pale of good order about thys
comen welth. For the loue of God
giue your seruauntes wages, and
cause thē to restore these liuinges,
whych coming of the sweate of the
labourer, be in dede the relife of ye
poore, the mayntenaunce of honestye,
and the reward of vertue, yea
the verye pale, wall, and bulwarkes
of the commen wealth. The
Apostles gaue all that they had
of theyr owne, freelye vnto other:
stycke not you to restore that now
whych ye haue of longe tyme vncharitably
kept from other.
            Heare what foloweth: whan these
fishes & loaues were broughte vnto
Iesus, make (sayth he) the people
to sit downe. God alwayes bestoweth
his benefites vpon theim
that sit doune in quietnes, & powreth

furth hys vēgaūce vpō those
that be vnpacient, vnquiet, & full
of businesse. For as appeareth in
Genesis, the people gathered together
in the playne of Sanner, &
made a greate vprore, buildyng a
tower lyke rebels agaynst god, to
get thē a name. Howe be it god destroied
their hādyworke, cōfoūded
theyr lāgage, & scatered thē abrod.
            The Scribes & the Phariseys
came vnquietly, temptyng Christ,
and required a sygne from heauē.
Christ rebuked them sharply, and
shewed them no sygne, but called
them a frowarde and aduoutrous
generacion. So the people in
England gathered together, they
woulde make maisteryes, and bee
notable felowes: yea, the towre of
theyr presumpcion shuld be built
vp vnto heauen, in dyspite of gentyll
men and nobilitye: they haue
partlye felte, and we haue ryghte

pitifully sene howe sore God was
therwith offended. Nowe I heare
saye there is as yet remaininge in
Englād sum stiffe necked Iewes,
which come presumptuously temtyng
God, and say: if these our rulers
be sent of God, to take better
order then other haue done, well
then, let theym begynne betime to
gyue vs a notable sygne & token,
for els we wyll not beleue, truste,
nor obey them.
            Wel, I wyl tel you that thus
whysper: Euen as Christe was
Positus in resurreccionem et ruinam multorum
in Israell: Set to restore and
decaye manye in Israell: So be
Christen rulers in euerye comune
wealth, set and ordayned of God,
to beate doune & kepe vnder these
sturdye rebels, whyche be so euyll
thē selues, that they cannot thinke
that any man doeth intende to do
them good, & to rayse vp, conforte

and cherish the simple pacient people,
whyche be of a good truste towardes
theyr rulers, knowynge
that they theim selues haue deserued
no euyll: or els if they haue
done euyl, yet by repentaunce and
amendemente, do not doute to obteyne
mercye at theyr rulers handes.
So God hath ordeyned rulers
to cheryshe ye, if thou be meke
quiet and paciente, or els to punyshe
the, if thou be vnquyet, busy
and stubborne. Learne at Paule.
Rom. xiii. If thou do wel, to trust
well of thy rulers, and if thou doo
euyll, not to be wythoute feare of
theyr powers, for he beareth not
the swerde wythout a cause. Take
hede therefore ye rulers, for gods
sake, and pitye of people, seynge
that God hath geuen you a swerd
to cut of rotten cankred members
for the safegarde of the hole body▪
knowyng no cāker to be so daungerous

as rebellion in a commen
wealth: If ye fynde one person infected
wyth that canker, awaye
wyth him, for ye safegard of the bodye
of that house. If one house be
infected, away wyth it, for the safegarde
of that toune. If the toune
be infected, awaye wyth it, for the
safegarde of the contrey. Yea, if a
shyre or contrye be all poysoned,
awaye wyth it, for the pitye, and
safegarde of the hole bodye of the
commen welth. So ye se, that the
sharper that youre sworde is, and
the sooner that ye strike rebellion,
the more pyty shewe ye in cutting
away the lesse, and sauynge the
more part and porcion of the people,
beynge all of one bodye, of one
realme and common welth. Consider
that Chryste wente from Ierusalem
vnto wildernes, to drawe
the Gentle people from amonge
the stoborne scribes: and so Chrysten

rulers muste nowe nedes defer
the tyme to drawe the people
that be good and trust well, from
amonge this frowarde generacion,
whiche of presumption loke to
haue order taken as they require,
and appoynte the tyme, the place
and the thynge. Wherfore, ye that
be good quiet people, beware of
these busye felowes, and as thys
multitude whiche oughte to be
youre example, folowed Chryst into
the wyldernes, so folowe you
Christen rulers, goddes offycers,
youre chiefe gouerners in Englande.
And as they dyd not murmure,
sayinge: why shall we sitte
downe here in the wyldernes, beyng
an infinite number, where no
meate is, seynge that in the cityes
where was more meate, and lesse
gatherynge of the people, we had
neuer feaste gyuen of hym by hys
Apostles?
            
               
So I saye, do not you grudge
and saye: why shall we quyet oure
selues nowe, trustynge to reliefe,
where wee see nothynge, and were
nothynge at al releued when there
was great plentye of landes, and
goodes of Abbeys, Colegis, and
Chaunteries? Do not murmour
so vngodlye, but see that there be
no faulte in you, and ye shal fynd
no lacke in GOD. Suerlye, excepte
ye do sytte downe quietly, ye
shall soner prouoke goddes vengeaunce
to your damnacion, then
deserue any reliefe of goddes officers,
to your comfort. Sit downe
and be quyet, for the same rulers
& ministers are ordeyned of god
to feede you wyth plentye: whych
be commaunded of God to make
you fyrste to set downe in order &
quyetnes. Yea, and herke all ye
that be godlye Rulers: there was
much grasse in the place, god had

prouided muche grasse for theym
that loked for no carpets: geuyng
all godly gouernours example to
prouyde thynges necessarye for
those people that at loketh for no superfluities.
But alas, here in
England, superfluous gorgeous
building is so much prouided for
ryche mens pleasures, that honest
houses do decay, where as labouring
men ought to haue necessary
lodging. It is a commen custome
with couetous landlordes, to lette
their housynge so decaye, that the
fermer shalbe fayne for a smal reward
or none at all to gyue vppe
hys leasse, that they takynge the
groundes into their own handes,
may tourne al to pasture: so nowe
Old Fathers, poore Wydowes,
and yong children, lie begging in
the mirie stretes.
            O mercifull Lorde, what a
number of poore, feable, haulte

Blynde, Lame, sycklye, yea, wyth
idle vacaboundes, and dissembelinge
kaityffes mixt among them,
lie and crepe, begging in the myry
streates of London and Westminster?
            Nowe speakyng in the behalfe of
these vile beggers, for as much as
I know that ye vilest person vpon
earth, is ye liuely image of almightye
God, I wyll tell the that arte a
noble man, worshypfull man, an
honest welthye man, especiallye if
thou be Maire, Sherif, Aldermā
baily, cōstable or any such officer,
it is to thy greate shame afore the
worlde, & to thy vtter dānacion afore
god, to se these beggīg as thei
vse to do in the streates. For there
is neuer a one of these, but he lacketh
eyther thy charitable almes
to relieue his nede, or els thy due
correction to punyshe hys faute. A
great sin and no les shame is to for

him that sayeth he is a Christē mā
to se Chryst lack things necessary,
& to bestowe vpon the deuil superfluousli.
It is Christ Iesus hī self
that in the nedy doth suffer hūger,
thrist & cold: It is the deuyll hym
selfe, that in the wealthye fareth
deintely, goeth gorgeously, & vseth
superfluitie. Looke Mathewe the
xxv. & there shal ye se playnly that
it is Christ which lacketh sufficient
in the neady: and therefore the
deuyll beyng contrary to Chryst,
contrariwyse hathe to much in the
wealthye.
            You also that do prouyde that
your cattel do not longe tary pinned
in a folde where there is no
grasse, whye do you suffer youre
owne brethren in Chryst, wythout
prouysyon to lye in the streates,
where is muche myer? These selye
soules haue ben neglected thorow
oute all Englande, and especiallye

in Londō and Westminster: But
nowe I trust that a good ouerseer
a godly Byshop I meane, wyll se
that they in these two cities, shall
haue their nede reliued, and their
faultes corrected, to the good ensample
of al other tounes & cities.
            Take hede that ther be much
grasse to sit vpon, there as ye commaūd
the people to sit downe, that
there be sufficiente housynge and
other prouisiō for the people ther
as ye commaūd theim to be quiet.
The men satte downe about fyue
thousandes in nūber. If they had
not bene obedient to sitte downe,
Christ wold not haue bene liberal
to haue gyuen them meate.
            Meate was prouided for the
Cōmens of England, and readye
to haue bene deliuered. But when
they were bydden to sit downe in
quietnes, they rose vp by rebelliō,
and haue lost all the chere of that

feast. Yet that notwithstanding,
I trust that those which sat quietly
in dede, shal sone be fed with plē
               tye,
if they sit styll vntyll it maye
conueniently be disposed. I praye
GOD they maye, I truste they
shal. The Euaungelist saith that
the men sat, namyng neyther women
nor Chyldren, how be it there
was both women and Chyldren,
as appeareth in the other Euangelistes.
And men be here named
onely, because al women and children
did folow the example, and obey
the cōmaundemēt of mē: children
of the fathers, and women of
their husbandes.
            Let not therefore your wyues
and chyldren, when they come abrode,
be so bold openly, as to say
or do any thinges of them selues,
but as they haue example and cō
               maundement
of you. Now the
multitude placed in quyetnes,
            
               
Iesus toke the loues,
and when he hadde giuen
thankes, he deuided them
vnto his Disciples: and
the Disciples vnto them
that were set downe: and
lykewyse of the fyshes, so
much as they would
            Here learne fyrste of Chryste, to
take nothynge, be it neuer so lytell,
but wyth thankes rendered therefore
vnto God: For of God surelye
thou haste receiued it, by what
messenger or meane soeuer thou
came vnto it. Then secondarilye,
learne at the Apostles to geue vnto
other, that which the Lord hath
geuen vnto the, that thou mayest
truly say wyth the Apostel Paul.
Quod accepi a domino, hoc tradidi uobis.
That whiche I receyued of the
Lorde, haue I geuen vnto you.
            
               
Beware that thou playe not the
wycked seruaunt, which kept his
talent hyd, and not delyuered vnto
any vse, for then it shal be taken
frō the, and thou shalt be cast into
vtter darkenes.
            Nowe, to applye this miracle
vnto this present time, the kynges
Magesty may learne at Chryst to
take of his seruauntes, Prebendes,
Benefices, Improperacions
and all maner of Offyces, that be
not presently occupyed & executed
of a faythful diligent officer, and
after thanckes geuen vnto God
therfore, to deliuer them vnto his
Counsell and Nobilyty to be disposed
amongest the people of hys
Realme, whych be in such hunger
and lacke of faythful officers, and
house kepers, and godli preachers
that they must nedes faint, excepte
they be sone prouided for.
            And in thys dystrybucion of offices

and benefyces, your Magestye
wyth your Counsell had nede
to stand and beholde the dealyng
of your Nobles, as Christ dyd of
his Apostles. For it is not vnlike
but as there was amongest Christes
Apostles, so wyll there be amongest
euery Chrysten Kynges
Counsellers and Nobles, some
Iudas whych is to be trusted no
further then he can be seene. For
in syghte Iudas doth as other of
hys felowes do: but beyng out of
syghte he solde hys Maister. And
so the most couetous of them all,
wyll be afrayde to do any thynge
amysse, yf you loke vpon: but if
your backes be turned, then wyll
couetous Iudas sell dearly that
whych hys liberal maister gyueth
frelye. As for example of late dayes,
the Kynges Magestye that
deade is, dyd gyue a Benefyce to
be appropryat vnto the Uniuersitye

of Cambrydge. In liberam et puram
eliemosinam: As fre and pure almes.
Howe be it, hys handes were
so vnpure, whiche should haue delyuered
it, that he receiued .vi. hundreth
poundes of the Unyuersytye
for it. Whether that this .vi.C.
poūds were conueied to the kings
behoofe pryuelye for that almes,
whyche by playne wrytynge was
geuē frely, or els put into some Iudas
pouch, I would it were knowen.
For nowe, by suche charitable
Almes, the king is slaundered, the
parish vndone, and the vniuersyty
in worse case then it was afore.
            Pleaseth it your Magestye, wyth
your honourable Counsell, for the
reuerence of God, the pytye of the
poore, and the godlye zele that ye
haue to good learning, heare what
hath bene done in your tyme.
            Your Magesty hath had gyuen
& receiued by Act of Parliament,

Colleges, Chauntries, & guyldes
for mani good consideracions, and
especially as appeareth in the same
Act, for exectinge of grammer scholes,
to the educacion of youthe in
vertue & godlynes, to the further
augmentynge of the vniuersities,
and better prouision for the poore
and nedy. But now, many Grammer
scholes, and muche charytable
prouision for the poore, be taken,
sold, and made awaye, to the greate
flaunder of you and youre lawes,
to the vtter discomfort of the pore,
to the greuous offence of the people,
to the mooste miserable drownynge
of youthe in ygnoraunce,
and soore decaye of the Uniuersities.
            There was in the North countrye,
amongest the rude people in
knowledge (whyche be most readye
to spend theyr liues and goodes, in
seruinge the king at the burnyng

of a Beacon) there was a Grammer
schole founded, hauynge in the
Uniuersitie of Cambrydge, of the
same foundacion .viii. scholerships
two felowshippes, euer replenished
wyth the scholers of that schole,
whych schole is now sold, decayed,
and loste. Mo there be of lyke sort
handled: But I recyte thys onelye,
because I knowe that the sale
of it was once stayed of charytye,
and yet afterwardes broughte to
passe by brybrye, as I hearde saye,
and beleue it, because that it is only
brybrye that customablye ouer
commeth charytye.
            For gods sake you that be in authorytye,
loke vpon it.
            For if ye winke at suche matters,
God wyl scouse vpon you. Thinke
not that I do burden you wt more
than that which God by hys ordynaunce,
not wtout your willes & cō
               sentes,
hath charged you wythal.

For by whose faute or negligence
so euer it was, that thynges afore
tyme haue ben vncharytably abused,
suerlye it is your charge, whiche
be nowe in authorytye, to se at
thys tyme all such thynges as yet
remayne out of order, rightuously,
spedely, and charitably redressed.
            And as I do perceyue, that the abuse
of these thynges afore tyme,
hath offended God, troubled the
common wealth, and brought some
men towardes shame & confusion:
So do I wyshe, praye, and trust,
that nowe the redresse of the same
maye be to gods pleasure, the peoples
cōfort, & to ye honor & establishment
of them that be in most highe
authorytye.
            Heare therefore, and I wyl tel
you more: There were in some
townes .vi. some .viii. and some a
dosyn kyne, gyuen vnto a stocke
for the relyefe of the poore, and vsed

in such wyse, that the poore cotingers,
which could make any prouision
for fodder, had ye, milke for a
very small hyre, & then the number
of the stocke reserued, al manner of
vayles besydes, bothe the hyre of
the mylke, and the pryces of the
yong veales, and olde fatte wares,
was disposed to the reliefe of the
poore, these be also soulde, taken,
and made awaye. The Kynge beareth
the slaunder, the poore feleth
the lacke, but who hath the profit
of suche thynges, I canne not tell:
but well I wot, and al the worlde
seeth, that the Acte of Parlimente
made by the Kynges Magestye,
and hys Lordes and Commens of
the Parliamente, for the mayntenaunce
of learnynge, and reliefe of
the poore, hathe serued some, as a
most fit instrument to rob learning
and to spoyl the pore.
            If you that now be in authorytye

do not loke vpon such thynges to
redresse them, god wyl loke vpon
you, to reuenge theym. Here haue
I rehersed theim, that the Kynges
Magestye, wyth you of hys counsell
maye learne not onelye by the
doctrine & examples of scripture,
but also by experience in hys own
land, to se and consider howe hys
benefytes, put into the handes of
hys nobles and offycers, be disposed
and vsed amongest his inferiour
people.
            For if landed men & offycers by
keping of houses, & doing of theyr
dutyes in theyr countryes, do bestowe
amonge the people, all that
they haue receiued of god, by the
kynges gyft, theyr fathers inherytance,
or other waies: then shal god
giue such encrese, yt euery man shall
haue inough.
            As Salomon, the .xi. of the
Prouerbes testifieth: Alii diuidunt

propria, et ditiores fiunt: alii rapiunt non
sua, et semper in egestate sunt: Some
dispose and gyue theyr owne, and
become rycher and rycher: some
doo rauine and spoyle that whiche
is not theyr owne, and be euer in
lacke and deede. As ye see in daylye
experience, those that do theyr
owne duties in executinge theyre
offyces, and bestowe theyr owne
goodes in kepynge good houses,
baue euer suche plentye, that all
other men maruayle from whence
god sendeth it. And those yt do no duties,
nor kepe no houses, but brybe
in theyr offyces, and polle theyr teuaūtes,
take so much and haue so litel,
that all men wonder how the deuyl
they waste it.
            Nothynge is more true then the
Gospell: Date, et dabitur uobis: Gyue
& it shal be gyuen vnto you. Gyue
plentifully vnto other, and godwil
gyue more plentie vnto you.

For God wyll alwayes be afore
hand, in giuyng good giftes. For
as appeareth in thys gospell, when
the Apostles hadde giuen vnto the
people so muche good meate as
they desyred, then saieth the Euangeliste.
            When they wer filled,
Iesus sayeth to hys dysciples:
Gather vp the broken
meates that remaine,
so that nothynge be lost.
They therefore gathered
and fylled .xii. baskets ful
wyth the broken meates
remaining of that which
they had eaten.
            Here they gaue but .v. loues & two
fishes, & ther was giuē vnto thē .xii
baskets ful of meates.
            The Wyddowe of Sarepthat

gaue but one handfull of flowre,
and a litle oile vnto Elias, and had
gyuen vnto her againe so much as
serued her and her sonne, al the time
of the great drought .iii. Reg .xvii.
Learne therfore that couetous bribry
& extorcion hath neuer inough:
and charytable lyberalytye euer
hath plentye.
            Here also maye rych men learne,
when and howe to fyll theyr store
houses. Surely, euen as the Apostles
dyd fyll theyr baskettes, when
the people haue inoughe, then by
gatherynge vp that whiche elles
shoulde be lost. So dyd Iosephe
in Egipt, suffer no corne to be lost
in the yeares of plentye, but stored
it vp in barnes, to reléue the people
wyth, in the tyme of darth: Not
as couetous Carles do here in England
forstall the markets, and by
corne at al tymes, to begyn and encrease
a dearthe.
            
               
Blessed be they that sell, to make
good cheape, and cursed be they
that bye, to make it deare. For Salomon
sayeth. Prouerbes .xi.
            
               Qui abscondit frumenta, maledicetur in
populis: benediccio autem super caput uendencium:
He that hydeth vp corne,
shall be cursed amongest the people:
But blessynge be vpon theyr
heades, that sell.
            Nowe, to teache Chrysten rulers
theyr dutyes, in the example
of Chrystes Apostles: marke howe
the Apostles dyd fyrst minister vnto
the people, and than gathered
vp for them selues, teaching thereby
all Chrysten ministers, landelordes,
offycers, and rulers, fyrste
to minister vnto the people, euerye
one the dutye of hys owne vocacion,
afore they gather of the people,
rentes, tythes, or fees, by the
name and aucthorytye of that vocacion.
Qui non labor at, sayeth Paule,

               non manducet: He that doeth not labour,
should not eate. He that doth
no worke, shoulde take no wages:
he that doeth no dutyes, shoulde
take no fees. Alas, thys is goddes
woorde, wrytten in hys wyll and
Testamente, sealed wyth Chrystes
bloude, and yet the customes and
lawes of Englande be cleane contrarye.
For it hathe bene customeably
vsed, yea, and by lawes commaunded,
to paye wages, tythes,
and fees, althoughe no labour, no
offyce, no dutye be done. Yea, although
he be not a labourer, a pastor
or an offycer in dede, but onlye
by a pretenced name, vnto whome
these for the most part be paied.
            For he that hath the propertyes
& useth the trades of a false theife,
& cruell murtherer, can neuer be a
faythful offycer in dede, althoughe
he be so named by hys owne flatery,
in the Patrons presentacion,

in the Byshoppes induccion, yea
and in the Kynges Patent, sealed
wyth the brode Seale. I had nede
to take hede how that I speake openly
agaynst any thynge in any
mans Patent, sealed wt the kings
great seale: Much more nede hadde
you to take hede, how that ye do any
thing expressedly against goddes
wyll and Testamente, sealed
wyth Chrystes precious bloude.
            It is expressedly agaynste Goddes
Testamente, to clothe a Wolfe in
a Lambes skynne: to call a thefe,
an officer, and a cruell murtherer
a charytable pastoure: to call euyll
by the name of good: and good by
the name of the euyll. Esaye .v.
            
               Ve qui dicitis in alum bonum. Wo be
to you that call euyl good. To you
I say, which not only by sayinges
but also in wrytynges, do name &
call theiues, murtherers, & wolfes
that be euyll, by the names of officers,

pastors, and lambes, whiche
be good. I do not onlye meane
Persons, Prebendaryes, and other
benefised men, but also all manner
officers, whiche haue wages, fees,
or liuinges, because you geue them
such names, and not for that they
do such dutyes.
            These be al Wolfs, and the names
and titles that you gyue them, be
nothynge els but shepe skynnes.
            Some saye, they wyll take better
heede hereafter, but that whiche is
nowe past, can not nowe be called
backe, and amended. Yea, and it
were great pytye, seynge that they
haue payed the fyrst fruites vnto
the Kinges Magesty, and no smal
reward vnto other men, perchaūce
bought theyr offyces dearelye, now
to put them out of those lyuynges,
wyth the losse. of. all those charges
whiche they haue bestowed in rewardes,
as other wayes, to gette

such lyuynges.
            Wo, wo wo vnto you hypocrytes
that stumble at a strawe, and
leape ouer a blocke, that strayne
out a gnat, and swalowe vp a camell,
that pytye more the losse of
mens brybrye, whiche was geuen
to corrupt some men, then the treading
vnder fote of Christes bloud,
whiche was shead, to saue all men,
that dooe imagin it pytye to dryue
the theues, murtherers and wolfes
frō amongest ye lambs of God,
redemed wt Christs precious blud,
& cōmitted vnto your gouernaunce
and kepynge.
            As God shal helpe me, I speake
wyth feare, pytye, and reuerence:
if you do not rather pulle the shepes
skinnes ouer the wolfes eares,
and hang theyr carcases vpon the
pales, then suffer theym to contynewe
styll, God wyll plucke you
downe wyth some sodein mischiefe,

rather then mainteine or suffer you
in so hygh authorytye, to vse such
vncharitable, vngodly, and cruell
pytye. You knowe that some of thē
haue bought theyr benefyces, haue
bought theyr offyces, than must ye
nedes know, that eyther Christ is
a lyer, or els that they be entered in
as theues, to spoyle, murther, and
to destroye.
            If you suffer theues, murtherers
and wolfes to take theyr plesures
amongest Goddes lambes, I tell
you playne, God wyll not longe
suffer you to be ye hedshepherds, &
gouernours, & feders of hys lābes.
            And take hede you people that
on the otherside ye runne not into
an vntollerable stobernes, deniyng
your rētes, your tithes, or other duties:
for ye scripture forbydoeth you
vtterly, to deny or withdrawe any
thīg frō thē: thou art cōmaūded if
he contēd to take thy cloke to geue

hym also thy cote. What soeuer is
asked, rather gyue more, than by
denyinge of that, not to shewe thy
selfe to be an innocent shepe that
gyueth hys fleese, but a noysome
Goat, that striketh with the horne.
You are alwayes bounden to geue
the flese. It is the magistrates duties,
to consider and note, whether
they be theues or shepherds, dogs
or woulfes, that taketh the fleese.
Medle not wyth other mennes duties,
for if ye do, surely ye shal finde
no remedye, but prouoke vncolourable
vengeaunce.
            Nowe to tourne to oure particuler
purpose, lette all theym that
do receiue offices, landes, power,
or authorytye frome God, by the
kynges gyfte, or by other meanes,
Firste bestowe & dispose the dutyes
of those thynges faithfullye amongest
the people, afore they gather
vp to theim selues the reuenues &

commodities of the same from the
people. And then when as no man
can come to meat, but by doyng of
labour, nor none to receyuynge of
fees, but by doing of duties, surely
euery man shal haue as much as
he deserueth, & no man shall lacke
that which he needeth.
            For he, that by doing of greate
duties deserueth the moste, by atteininge
the fees and rewardes due
for the same dutyes, shall haue the
best. And he yt is in nede, hauinge
no trust to get any thyng by idlenesse,
crafte, or flattery, shalbe compelled
to vse that labour & honest
exercise, whyche shall relyeue hys
nede sufficiētly. Yea, by thys mean
no man shall spende hys tyme in
idlenesse, nor vse any labour or dyligence,
wythout due recompence,
For nede shall dryue all men from
slouthfull idlenesse, vnto labour &
diligēce: and where as no laboure

nor dylygence lacketh hys iust rewarde,
there euery labouring and
diligent man, shal haue sufficient
plenty: So ye see how thys doeth
consequently ensue, that euery māshal
haue sufficient inough & plentye,
wheras men do first dispose,
minister, & giue according to theyr
dutyes, & afterwards receiue kepe
& saue that which God doth sende
as a rewarde, encreased & augmented,
for doing of theyr dutyes.
            So dyd the Apostles, after the
faythful diligent disposyng of the
v. loues and .ii. fyshes receiue and
keepe theyr rewarde wonderfullye
augmēted, to replenish and fyl .xii.
baskets. So God graunt, that all
officers in Englād may wyth such
faithful diligence do theyr duties
yt it may please God to gyue to all
the people sufficient inough, & vnto
euery minister, the basket of his
honest desire, heaped vp bi the brim
            
               
The men therfore seynge what
a signe Iesus had done, sayd that
this is yt Prophet, whiche cometh
into the worlde. This is euen he
whom Moises, the law, & the prophetes
do teache, to be the fully &
only sufficient sauiour of ye world.
Moses saying, in ye .xviii. of Deut.
A Prophet of thy nacion & of thy
brethren, lyke vnto me, shall the
Lorde thy God rayse vp vnto the,
hym shalt thou heare. The lawe,
as a tutour, leadeth & bryngeth al
men to thys sauyour, to receyue of
hym that perfeccion, which the law
it selfe lacketh. The Prophetes
dyd tel long afore of this sauiour
which is now comen in our tyme,
after theyr dayes. Thys was the
peoples confession of Chryst, after
that they were by so great a miracle,
so plentyfullye fed. Christe ofte
afore had wrought wōderfull miracles,
disputed learnedly, & preached

playnely: but by al those meanes
did he not so muche perswade
the people, and win theyr heartes,
as by thys one miracle, in feeding
& cheryshinge the people. Yea, and
whosoeuer listeth to mark thorowe
out all Englande, he shall se that
a meane learned person, keping an
house in hys paryshe, and beyng of
godly conuersacion, shal perswade
& teach mo of hys parishners with
communicacion at one meale, than
the best learned doctor of diuinitie
kepynge no house can perswade or
teache in hys parish by preachyng
a dosen solemne sermons.
            Lyke wyse the gentle man that
kepeth a good house in his cōtrey
shalbe in better credit with ye people
for hys liberalitye, then the best
orator or lawier in England, for
all hys eloquence. I do not prayse
those men whych brybe and pol al
the yeare to kepe riot in theyr houses

for a fortnyght, a moneth, or a
quarter of a yeare: But those I se
beloued, trusted & obeyed, that accordynge
to theyr habilitie, keepe
good houses continually.
            And the chiefe cause why the commens
doo not loue, trust, nor obey
the gentlemē & officers, is, because
the gentlemen and officers buylde
many fayre houses, and kepe fewe
good houses, haue plentye of eloquence
to tell fayre tales, but vse
lytell faythfull dylygence in doing
of theyr duties. Wherefore, sende
forth, and place in euerye countrye
godly preachers, wel disposed persons,
and faithful diligent officers
of all sortes. Yea, but where shuld
we now fynd liuyngs for al those?
            Forsoth I do tel you: Outand
away with the wily foxes, the false
flatteryng theues, & the rauenyng
wolfes, and than se how many loues,
how many offices, prebendes,

and benefices ye finde voyde, howe
mani you haue amongest your selues
that youre boye caryeth, that
your chapleynes, your seruaunts,
and your houshold officers haue, &
let all these be broughte forth: and
althoughe at the fyrste syghte they
shal seme to litle, and fewe to serue
so greate a Realme with so manye
shyres, beyng all runne nowe oute
of ciuil order into rude wildernes,
Yet, after equal diuidyng & faythful
diligent ministring of those loues
and fyshes, of these prebends,
personages, and all kynd of offices
amongest the people, God of hys
goodnesse shall geue suche increase
vnto the people, hauynge thereby
sufficiente plenty of Chrystes holy
worde of good ciuil order, & of charitable
reliefe, that there shal be remaynyng
so much tithes, offrynge,
rentes, fees, & rewards, as wyl fyll
the .xii. baskets of the Apostles, I

meane the barnes, the houses, and
purses of all sayethfull diligente
ministers and offycers. Then shall
thys one acte perswade and allure
the hertes of al Englyshmen, more
then all that euer was done afore:
For when they shall see, that by
thys Kyng and thys Counsell, the
wilye foxe of supersticion is vtterlye
banyshed, the false these of flaterye
apprehended and taken, and
the cruel wolfe of couetousenesse
slain and hanged vp by the heeles,
so that the preachers, the persons,
the officers, and all manner of pastores
restored to theyr places, doo
feede, cherysh, and kepe theyr flockes
whiche were afore pylled, spoiled
and deuoured: then shall they
of hertye courage, with one minde,
and one voice confesse and acknowledge,
that thys is a Kyng sent frō
God, in dued wyth the wysdome of
Salomon, and the faythfull diligent

stoutnesse of Dauyd hys father,
nowe guyded by godly counsel
to bryng out of mysery, and prosper
in welth vs the people
of thys hys Real pe.
