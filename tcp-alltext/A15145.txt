To paſſe ouer ſundrie I will note but this one. where as in tymes paſte (bothe at Paules croſſe and other places) the ſoundes whiche were wont to be ſo ſweete as might iuſtely haue moued the godly hearers to crye owte with the Prophet Eſay O howe beutifull are the feete off them which bring glad tydinges off peace / &c. are nowe become (commonly ſo ſoure and vnſauery / that in ſteede off ſweetnes / is founde litle or nothinge but wormewood and bitter gall. And

yet I ſpeak not off ſuche / whoſe cruell ſcoffinge / and vnbridled natures / are to well knowen ſo farr to exceede / as fewe / (diſcreete and wiſe in dede) can be muche moued with anie thinge almoſte they eyther ſpeak or write: but euen off thoſe I meane / whoſe wiſedomes grauitie / and lerninge / as the ſame claimeth by good right / dew reuerence to the perſons / bycauſe off thoſe good giftes whiche God hath beſtowed vpon them ſo ſhuld it alſo put them in minde (eſpecially in ſuch places) to vſe (me ſemes) ſome other veine.

The ſame night came one Maiſter Valaren pullan Miniſter / vnto their lodginge / ād declared howe he had obtained a churche there / in the name of all ſuche as ſhuld come owte off Englande for the Goſpell / but Eſpecially from Glaſſenbury whiche were all french men. Anſwere was made him / that as god was to be praiſed / who had moued the Magiſtrats hartes to ſhewe the frenche ſuche fauour: Euenſo / for ſo muche as fewe off them vnderſtoode the frenche tonge / it woulde be ſmall commoditie to them / or to ſuche as ſhulde come afterwarde to ioyne themſelues to that churche.
            The nexte daye they communed with Maiſter Morellio another Miniſter of the frenche churche / and alſo with maiſter Caſtalio a Senior off the ſame / (bothe off them godly and lerned mē) By their aduiſe and counſaile it was determined / that a Supplication ſhulde be drawē owt / and offred to the Magigiſtrats / to knowe / firſte whither they woulde be contented / that not onely the parties before named / but alſo all other Engliſhe men that woulde repaire thither for the like cauſe / might through their fauour be ſuffred ſaffely to remaine within

their city. This ſupplication was ſubſcribed aſwell by the ſayed Sutton / whittingam / and the reſte off the Engliſhe men / as alſo by Morellio / Caſtallio / and one Adrian a Cittezē there / with whom they lodged. And within three daies after the offringe vp off their Supplication / they obtained their requeſtes.
            The 8. off Iuly followinge / labor was made (by the counſaile and aduice off Morellio and Caſtalio (who duringe their lyues ſhewed them ſelues fathers to all Engliſhe men) to Maiſter Iohn Glawberge one off the chiefeſt Senators / for a place or churche / wherin they and all their country men might haue gods worde truly preached / and the Sacraments ſincerely miniſtred in their naturall tonge / who ientlie promiſed his furtherance / and that he alſo woulde move the whole Senate theroff / the whiche he did accordingly. And the 14. daie off the ſame monethe yt was graunted that they ſhulde haue libertie to preache and miniſter the Sacraments / in that churche which the frēche men had / the frēche one daie and the Engliſhe an other daie and vpō the Sundaie / to chuſe alſo thē houres as they coulde agree amonge them ſelues / but yt was with this commandement / that the Engliſhe ſhulde not diſcent from the frenchmen in doctrine / or ceremonyes / leaſt they ſhulde thereby miniſter occaſion off offence / and willed farther / that before they entred their churche / they ſhulde approue and ſubſcribe the ſame confeſſion off faith / that the frenche men had then preſented / and abowte to put in printe / to the whiche all the afore named (and others whiche were by this time come thither) did ſubſcribe.
            When the churche was in this ſorte graunted / they conſulted amonge themſelues / what order off ſeruice they ſhulde vſe (for they were not ſo ſtricly bownde / as was tolde them / to the ceremonies off the frenche / by the Magiſtrats / but that iff the one allowed off the other it was ſufficient.) At lenght / the engliſhe order was peruſed / and this by generall conſente was concluded that the anſweringe alowde after the Miniſter ſhulde not be vſed / the letanye / ſurplice / and many other thinges alſo omitted / for that in thoſe reformed churches / ſuche

thinges woulde ſeeme more then ſtrange. It was farther agreed vppon / that the Miniſter (in place off the Engliſhe Confeſſion ſhulde vſe an other / bothe off more effecte / and alſo framed accordinge to the ſtate and time. And the ſame ended / the people to ſinge a pſalme in meetre in a plaine tune as was / and is accuſtomed in the frenche / dutche / Italian / Spaniſhe / and Skottiſhe churches / that don / the miniſter to praye for 
                  •
               haſſiſtance off gods holie ſpirite and ſo to proceade to the ſermon. After the ſermon / a generall praier for all eſtates and for oure countrie of Englande was alſo deuiſed / at thende off whiche praier / was ioined the lords praier and a reherſall off thartic
                  •
               es off oure belieff / whiche ended the people to ſinge and other pſalme as afore. Then the miniſter pronouncinge his bleſſinge The peace off god / &c. or ſome other off like effecte / the people to departe.
            And as touchinge the miniſtration off the Sacraments ſundrie things were alſo by common conſente om

               ious and ſuperfluous. After that the congregation had thus concluded and agreed / and had choſen their miniſter and Deacons to ſerue for a time: they entred their churche the 29. off the ſame monethe. Then was it thought good amonge themſelues that forthwith they ſhulde aduertiſe their countrie men and betheren diſperſed off this ſinguler benefit / the like wheroff coulde nowhere elſe as yet be obtained / and to perſwade hem (all worldly reſpectes put aparte) to repaier thither / that they might altogether with one mouthe and one harte bothe lamēte their foremer wickednes and alſo be thankfull to their mercifull father that had geuen them ſuche a churche in a ſtrange lande wherein they might heare gods worde truly preached / the Sacraments rightly miniſtred / and Diſcipline vſed / which in their owne countrie coulde neuer be obtained. And to this effecte were letters directed to Strauſburgh / Zurick / Denſbrugh / and Emden in the 2. off Auguſte. And for that it was thought the churche coulde not longe contynewe in good order withowte diſcipline / there was alſo a brieff forme deuiſed / declaringe the neceſſitie / the cauſes / 

and the order theroff / wherunto all thoſe that were preſent ſubſcribed / ſhewinge therby that they were ready and willinge to ſubmitt themſelues to the ſame / accordinge to the rule preſcribed in gods holie word / at whiche time it was determined by the congregation that all ſuche as ſhulde come after / ſhulde doo the like / before they were admitted as members off that churche.
            
               
                  Here followethe the generall letter ſente from the congregation off Franckforde / to Strauſbourge / Zurick / Wezeil / Emden / &c.

To the 2. whiche was for a church / it was tolde them / that they vnderſtoode by the Magiſtrats / the tyme ſerued not to moue anie ſuche matter till the counſaile brake vp at Auſburge. To the third it was ſaied that a generall graunt was made at their firſt comminge thither / to the whole nation / and the fredome off the citie offred to all ſuche as were deſyrous off it in as large and ample manner as they coulde require / whiche was to them aſſurance ſufficient.
            Theis 3. queſtions thus anſwered maiſter Chambers and Maiſter Grindall departe back againe with a letter from the congregation whiche was as followethe.
            
               
                  
                     Grace mercy and peace, &c.
                  
                  AS it was euer moſte true / ſo at this preſent we feele moſt ſenſiblie / that where ſo euer god layeth the foundation to builde his glory there he continueth till he bringe the ſame to a preſent worke. All thanks and praiſe be vnto him therfore / that hathe moued your hartes ſo as in no pointye ſeeme to forſlowe your diligence to the furtheraunce off the ſame. And as the worke is off moſte excellencie So the aduerſaries ceaſe not moſt craftely to vndermine it / or at the leaſte / through falſe reportes and defacing off the worke begon / to ſta

                     e the laborers / whiche ſhulde traueil in the finiſhinge theroff.

But truthe euer cleareth itſelff / and as the Sonne conſumethe the clowds / ſo miſreportes by triall are confounded. Oure brethern ſent from yow can certifie yow at lenght touchinge the particulers off your letter / to whom we haue in all th

                     ngs agreed whiche ſemed expedient for the ſtate off this congation. As for certeine Ceremonies whiche the order off the countrie will not beare: we neceſſarily omit with as litle alteration as is poſſible (which in your letters ye require) ſo that no aduerſary is ſo impudent that dare either blame oure doctrine of imperfection / or vs of mutabilitie / excepte he be altogether willfull ignorante / rather ſeekinge howe to finde faultes / then to amend them. Nether doo we diſcente from them whiche lie at the raunſome off their blouds for the doctrine wheroff they haue made a moſte worthye confeſſion.
                  And yet we thinke not that anye godlie man will ſtande to the deathe in the defence of ceremonies / whiche (as the booke ſpecifie the) vpō iuſte cauſes maie be altered and chaunged.

            WHen this letter was redd to the congregation / they requeſted that for ſo muche as the lerned men / coulde not cōdeſcend vppon any generall and certeine tyme off meetinge as nowe appeared by their letters / they might conclude vppon ſome certeine order by common conſent ſtill to continewe and that wihowte farther delaye / and alſo to haue the holie communion miniſtred / whiche the moſte part erneſtlie deſired. At lenght (it was agreed that the order of Geneua whiche then was alreadie printed in Engliſhe and ſome copies there amonge them) ſhulde take place as an order moſte godly and fardeſte off from ſuperſtition. But Maiſter knox beinge ſpoken vnto / aſwell to put that order in practiſe / as to miniſter the communion / refuſed to do ether the one or the other / affirminge / that for manie conſiderations he coulde not conſente that the ſame order ſhulde be practiſed / till the lerned men off Strauſbrough / Zurik / Emden / &c. were made priuy. Neither yet woulde he miniſter the communion by the booke off Englande / for that there were thinges in it placed (as he ſaied) onely by warrant of mans authoritie and no grownde in godds worde for the ſame / and had alſo a longe tyme verye ſuperſtitiouſly in the maſſe byn wickedly abuſed. But yff he might not be ſuffred to miniſter the Sacraments accordinge to his conſcience / he then requeſted that ſome other might miniſter the Sacraments / and he woulde onely preache. Iff nether coulde be admitted be beſought them

that he might be diſcharged. But to that the congregation woulde in no wiſe conſente.
            Whiles theſe things were thus in handlinge came maiſter Leuer (before elected) who / aſſemblinge the congregation requeſted that he might withe their conſentes appointe ſuche an order / as ſhulde be bothe Godly withowt reſpecte off the Booke off Geneua or anye other / requeſtinge farther / that for ſo muche as that office was off ſo great importaunce / ād that he had not byn in the like before / that he might betweene that and Eaſter haue a triall off them / and they off him / and ſo at the ende off that terme either take or refuſe / whiche time off triall / as it was willingly graunted him: ſo when they vnderſtoode that the order whiche he woulde place and vſe was not altogether ſuche as was fit for a right reformed churche / they woulde in nowiſe yelde to the ſame.
            Knox / whittingham / and others / perceyuinge that theis beginnings woulde growe to ſome what / yff it were not ſtaid in time / drewe forthe a platt off the whole booke off England into the lattin tonge / ſendinge the ſame to maiſter Caluin off Geneua and requeſtinge his iudgement therin / and ſhewinge him that ſome off their countrie men went abowte to force them to the ſame and woulde admit no other / ſayinge / that it was an order moſte abſolute and that yff euer they came in to their countrie they woulde do their beſte to eſtabliſhe it againe. Nowe folowethe the deſcription.
            
               A deſcription off the Liturgie / or booke off ſeruice that is vſed in Englande.
               FIrſte off all / morninge praier offreth it ſelff. The miniſter hauinge put on a white garment (whiche they call a ſurpleſſe)

beginninge withe ſome ſentence off holie ſcripture / as for example▪ yff we ſhall ſaie that we haue no ſinne we deceyue oure ſelues / &c. or ſome ſuche of like ſorte. Then he takethe in harde the exhortat on / whiche ſtirreth vp to a confeſſion off ſynnes / whiche the miniſter pronounceth with a loude voice / the people ſainge after him. To this is added an abſolution / and when theſe thinges are done / he reherſethe the lordes praier / and afterward lorde open thow my lyppes / and my mouthe ſhall ſhewe forth thy praiſe. O god be redie to be my helpe / &c. Then / come and let vs ſinge vnto th Lorde / &c. By and by alſo there folowe 3. Pſalmes together at thende off euery one. Then foloweth the firſt leſſon / whiche conteinethe a whole chapi

                  er off the olde Teſtament. After this leſſon they ſaie or ſinge we praiſe

Then an other leſſon owte off the Newe teſtamente / vnleſſe peraduenture the ſolemnization off ſome highe feaſt haue other ſet and apointed leſſons. Nowe in cathedrall churches they vtter their leſſons in plaine ſonge and thē afterwards is Benedictus added. This booke warnethe that they keepe this order through owte the whole yere. Afterwards / the crede is pronounced by the Miniſter / (all the people in the meane tyme ſtāding vp) Afterwards fallinge downe vppon their knees / the Miniſter ſaithe / The Lorde be with yow / The anſwere / And with thy ſpirite.
               Then / Lorde haue mercy vppon vs / Chriſte haue mercy vppon vs / Lorde haue mercy vppon vs / &c. our father / &c. pronounced owte alowde off all with all boldneſſe. Then the Miniſter / when he ſtandeth vpp ſaithe / o lorde ſhewe vs thy mercy The anſwere / and geue vnto vs thy ſauinge helthe. O Lorde ſaue the king In the day wherin we ſhall call vppon thee. Iudu

manner as the other are / ſauinge / that after the firſte leſſen foloweth my ſoule doth magnifie the lorde. After the 2. leſſen Now Lorde / &c. and in ſteed off that collect / God whiche arte the Author off peace / is vſed o God from whom all holie deſiers / &c. beſides / there is caution added that all Miniſters ſhall exerciſe them ſelues continually aſwell in morninge praiers as eueninge praiers / except perhapp by ſtudie in dyuinitie or ſome other buſynes / they be greatly and neceſſarely let or hindred· Beſides / vppon euery Sabothe daie / wenſdaie and fridaie there is yet in vſe certeine ſuffrages deuiſed off Pope Gregory whiche beginnethe after this manner. O God the father off heauen haue mercy vppon vs miſerable ſynners. O God the ſonne redemer off the worlde / &c. onely leauinge owte the inuocation off ſaincts / otherwiſe we vſe a certaine coniuringe off God. By the miſterie off his incarnation / by his holy natiuitie and circumciſion by his haptiſme / faſtinge and temptation / by his agonie and bloudie ſweate / &c. yea / it comprehendethe in plaine wordes a praier to be deliuered from ſuddain deathe / the people anſweringe to the ende off euery clauſe / either ſpare vs good lorde / or ells / Good Lorde deliuer vs / or we beſeche thee to heare vs Good Lorde. O Lambe off God that taketh awaie the ſinnes off the worlde is thriſe repeated. Then Lorde haue mercy vpon vs thriſe / and then the Lords praier with this praier alſo / o Lord deale not with vs after our ſinnes to the ſame adioined / paſſinge ouer ſome things leaſt we ſhulde ſeeme to ſyfte all thoſe droſſes which remaine ſtill amonge vs.
               Nowe the manner off the ſupper is thus. The nomber off three at the leaſte is counted a fitt nomber to communicate / and yet it is permitted (the peſtilence or ſome other common ſiknes beinge amonge the people) the Miniſter alone maie communicate withe the ſicke man in his houſe. Firſt therfore / the Miniſter muſte be prepared after this manner / in a whit lynnin garmente (as in ſayinge the other ſeruice he is apointed (and muſte ſtande at the Northeſide off the Table. Then is had the Lords praier after the cuſtome / then he reciteth

the collect / and after folowe in order the ten commaundements (but ſo notwithſtanding / that euery one off the people maye anſwere lorde haue mercy vpon vs and inclyne oure hartes to keepe this lawe. After the reherſall off the commandements / the collect off the daie (as it is called) and an other for the kinge is had. By and by the Epiſtle and Goſpell folowethe / to witt / ſuche as the callender apointethe for that daie. And there in this place there is a note / that euerie holy daye hathe his collect Epiſtle and Goſpell (whiche fill 73. great leaues off the booke 
                     •
                   when the reſte fill ſcarſe fiftie. For all holy daies are nowe in like vſe as were amonge the Papiſtes / onelye verye fewe excepted.
               Then he goethe forwardes to the crede and after that to the ſermon (iff there be anie) Afterwardes the pariſhe prieſt byddeth the holie dayes and faſtes on their eues / iff there be anye that weeke. And here the booke warnethe that none defraude the pariſhe prieſt off his due or right ſpecially on thoſe feaſt daies / that are dedicated to offrings. Then foloweth a praier for the ſtate off the churche militaunte / and that not withowte a longe heape and mixture off matters vntill they come (after a certeine confeſſion off ſinnes) to lift vp your hartes / the people anſweringe / we geue thankes to the lorde. Let vs geue thanks to our Lorde God / the anſwer / It is meete and right ſo to do. It is verie meete / right and our bownden dewtie / &c. vntill they come to that clauſe: O Lorde holie father / &c. and ſo the preface accordinge to the feaſte is added. Afterwards he ſaithe: Therfore withe Angells and Archangells and ſo endethe with holy holy holy / lord god / till he come to hoſianna in the higheſt. Nowe the prieſt bowethe his knee acknowledginge oure vnworthynes in the name off all them that ſhall receiu

                  . And ſettinge owte gods mercye / he beſeche the God that oure bodies maye be made cleane by his bodie and that our ſoules maie be waſhed through his bloude. And then he againe ſtandeth vp and takethe in hande a freſhe an other praier appointed for this purpos / in which are conteined the wordes off the inſtitution / all whiche beinge donne / 

he firſt communicateth / then / by and by he ſaithe to an other / knelinge / Take / and eate this in remembrance that Chriſt died for thee and feede on him in thy harte by faithe with thanksgeuinge.
               Now abowte thende the Lordes praier it vſed againe / the Miniſter ſayinge it alowde and all the people folowinge / to conclude / they haue a geuinge off thanks in thende / withe Glory to god in the higheſt / as it was vſed amonge the Papiſtes / yff it happen that there be no ſermon / onely a fewe thinges are omitted / but all other thinges are donne in order aforeſaid.
               In baptiſme the Godfathers are demaunded in the name off the childe / wither they renownce the deuell and all his workes / the luſtes off the worlde / &c. and they anſwere I renownce them. Then / wither they belieue the Artikles off the faithe / whiche beinge confeſſed / wilte thow (ſaith he turninge himſelf to bothe the witneſſes / be baptized into this faithe? and they ſaie yea / I will. After afewe thinge reherſed / he takethe the Child and dippeth it in / but warely and diſcretly as it is in the booke / vppon whoſe forehead alſo he ſhall make a croſſe in token forſoothe that when he is olde he ſhall not be aſhamed to confeſſe the faithe off Chriſte Crucified. Afterward / ſendinge awaie the Godfathers and Godmothers / be chargeth them that they bringe the childe to be confirmed off the Biſhopp as ſone as he can ſaie the Articles off the faithe / the lordes praier / and the ten Cōmaundemēts. And ſeinge there be many cauſes / as the booke ſaithe / whiche ſhulde moue them to the Confirmation off Children / this / forſoothe / off all others is the waightieſt / that by impoſition off hands they maie receiue ſtrenght and defence againſt all temptations off ſinne / and the aſſaults off the world and the deuell / bicauſe that when Children come to that age / partlie / by the frailtie off their owne fleſhe / partly / by the aſſaults off the worlde and the deuell they beginn to be in daunger: And leafte anie ſhulde think any error to be in this Confirmation / therfore they take a certeine pamflett off a Catechiſme / whiche conſiſteth

off the Articles off the faithe / the Lordes praier / and ten commandements / and all this is diſpatched in leſſe then two leaues.
               To theſe is ioyned their manner off Mariage off whiche that we maie paſſeouer many petty ceremonies theſe follies who can ſuffer? The huſbande laithe downe a ringe vpon the booke / whiche the miniſter takinge / he geuethe it in his hande and biddethe him to put it on the fourthfinger off his wiues left hande / Then he vſethe this forme off wordes: withe this ringe (ſaithe he) I thee wedd / withe my body I thee worſhip withe all my worldly goods I thee endue. In the name off the father / the ſonne / and the holy ghoſte.
               A litle after the Miniſter ſaithe to the newe maried perſons knelinge before the lordes table: Lorde haue mercy vppon vs Chriſt haue mercy vpon vs / Lorde haue mercy vppon vs. Oure father which arte / &c. Lorde ſaue thy ſeruaunt and thy handmaide / &c. and ſo a few things beinge reherſed they muſte be brought to the Lordes ſupper. The viſitation off the ſicke is after this manner. Peace be to this howſe. The anſwere / and to all that dwell in the ſame. Lorde haue mercy vpon vs / &c. our father / &c. Lorde ſaue thy ſeruaunte. Anſwere / whiche truſtethe in thee.

               The anſwere and Iudgemente off that famous and excellent lerned man Maiſter Iohn Caluin the late Paſtor off Geneua / touchinge the Booke off Englande after that he had peruſed the ſame faithfully translated owte off Latten by maiſter Whittingham.
               
                  
                     
                        To the godly and lerned men Maiſter Iohn Knox / and Maiſter William Whittingham / his faithfull brethern at Frankford &c.
                     
                     THis thinge trulie greuethe me very muche / and it is a great ſhame that contention ſhulde ariſe amonge brethern baniſhed and driuen owte of their countrie for one faithe / and

for that cauſe whiche onely ought to haue holden yow bounde together as it were withe an holy bande in this your diſperſion. For what might yow do better in this dolorous and miſerable plage / then (beinge pulled violently from your countrie) to procure your ſelues a church / whiche ſhulde receiue ād nouriſhe yow (beinge ioyned together in mindes and languadge) in her motherly lappe. But nowe for ſome men to ſtriue as touchinge the forme off praier and for Ceremonies as though ye were at reſte and proſperitie / and to ſuffer that to be an impedimente that ye cannot there ioyne in to one body off the churche (as I think) it is to muche owte off ſeaſon.
                     Yet notwithſtanding / I allowe their conſtancie whiche ſtriue for a iuſte cauſe beinge forced againſte their willes vnto contention. I do worthely condemne frowardnes / whiche dothe hinder and ſtaie the holye carefullnes of reforminge the churche.
                     And as I behaue myſelff gentle and tractable in meane things (as externall ceremonies) So doo I not alwaies iudge it profitable / to geue place to their foliſhe ſtowtenes / whiche will forſake nothinge off their oulde wonted cuſtome. In the liturgie off Englande / I ſe that there were manye tollerable fooliſhe thinges / by theis wordes I meane / that there was not that puritie whiche was to be deſired.
                           Many tollerable fooliſhe things in the book by Caluins iudgement.
                         Theis vices / thoughe they coulde not at the firſte daie be amended / yet / ſeinge there was no manifeſte impetie / they were for a ſeaſon to be tollerated. Therfore / it was lawfull to begin off ſuche rudimentes or abſedaries / but ſo / that it behoued the lerned / graue / and godly miniſters off Chriſte to enterpriſe farther / and to ſetfoorthe ſome thinge more filed from ruſte / and purer. Yf godly Religion had floriſhed till this daie in Englande / there ought to haue bin a thinge better corrected and manie thinges cleane taken awaie Nowe / when theis principles be ouer throwne / a churche muſte be ſet vp in an other place / where ye maie freely make an order againe / whiche ſhall be apparent to be moſte commoditious to the vſe and edification off the churche. I cannot tell what they meane whiche ſo greatly delite

in the leauinges off Popiſhe dregges. They loue the thinges wherunto they are accuſtomed. Firſte off all / this is a thinge bothe triflinge and Childiſhe.
                           The booke trifling and Childiſhe by Caluins iudgement.
                         furthermore / this newe order farre differeth from a chaunge.
                     Therfore / as I woulde not haue yow feirſe ouer them whoſe infirmitie will not ſuffer to aſcend an higher ſteppe: ſo woulde I aduertiſe other / that they pleaſe not them ſelues to muche in their fooliſhnes. Alſo / that by their frowardnes / they doo not let the courſe off the holie buildinge. Laſte off all / leaſt that fooliſhe vaine glorie ſteale them awaie. For what cauſe haue they to contende / excepte it be for that they are aſhamed to geue place to better thīges. But I ſpeake in vaine to them whiche perchaunce eſteeme me not ſo well / as they will vouchſaffe to admitt the conſaile that commethe from ſuche an authour. If they feare the evell rumor in Englande / as though they had fallen from that Religion which was the cauſe off their baniſhment / they are farre deceiued for this true and ſincere Religion / will rather compell them that theire remaine / faithfully to conſider in to what deepe gulff they haue fallen For there downefall ſhall more greuouſly wounde them / when they perceyue your goinge forewarde beionde mid courſe / from the whiche they are turned.
                     
                        Fare ye well dearely beloued brethern / and faithfull ſeruants off Chriſte. the Lorde defende and gouerne yow
                        from Geneua this 20. off Ian. Anno. 1555.
                        
                        Your Iohn Caluin
                     
                  
               
               WHen this letter of Caluins was redd to them of the congregation / it ſo wrought in the hartes off many / that they were not before ſo ſtowte to maintaine all the partes off the boke off England as afterward they were bent againſt it. But nowe to returne. Whiles theſe things were in doyinge / the congregation (as yow haue harde afore) coulde not agree vpon anie certeine order / till after longe debatinge to and fro / it was concluded / that maiſter Knox / maiſter Whittingham / Maiſter Gilby / Maiſter Fox and Maiſter T. Cole ſhulde drawe

forthe ſome order meete for their ſtate and time: whiche thinge was by them accompliſhed and offred to the congregation (beinge the ſame order off Geneua whiche is nowe in print) This order was verie well liked off many / but ſuche as were bent to the booke off Englande coulde not abide it / yea / cōtention grewe at lenght ſo hot / and the one partye which ſought ſinceritie / ſo ſore charged / with newfanglednes and ſingularitie and to be the ſtirrers of cōtention and vnquietnes / 
                     The humblenes of Gilby and his godly zeele
                   that Maiſter Gilby with a godly grieff (as well apeared) kneled downe before them and beſought them (withe teares) to reforme their iudgementes / ſolemelie proteſtinge / that (in this matter) they ſought not themſelues / but onely the glorie off god / as he was verely perſwaded / wiſhinge farther that that hande whiche he then helde vp were ſtricken of if by that a godly peace and vnitie might enſue and followe. In thende an otherwaie was taken by the congregation / whiche was / that maiſter Knox and maiſter whittingham / Maiſter parry and Maiſter leauer ſhulde deuiſe ſome order yff it might be / to ende all ſtriff and contention.
                     The modeſtie of Knox
                  
               
               Thies 4. aſſembled for that purpos. And firſt / Maiſter Knox ſpake to the reſte in this wiſe. For ſo muche / (ſaithe he) as I perceiue / that no ende of cōtention is to be hoped for / vnleſſe the one parte ſomethinge relent / this will I doo for my parte / that quietnes maie inſue. I will ſhewe my iudgement howe (as I think) it maie be beſte for the edification off this poore flocke / whiche if ye will not accepte / nor followe (after that I haue diſcharged my conſcience) I will ceaſe and cōmit the whole matter to be ordered by yow as yow will anſwere before Chriſt Ieſus at the laſte daie / and to this his congregation in this liffe / &c. Wherupon after ſome conference / an order was agreed vpō: ſome parte takē forthe of the Engliſhe booke and other things put to / as the ſtate of that churche required.
               And this order by the conſent of the cōgregation ſhulde continewe to the laſte of Aprill folowing.
                     This order was taken the 6. off Feb.
                   yff anie contention ſhulde ariſe in the meane time / the matter then to be determined by theis S. notable lerned mē / to wete / Caluin / Muſculus

Martyr / Bullinger / and Vyret. This agremente was put in wrytinge. To that all gaue their conſentes. This daie was ioyfull. Thanckes were geuē to God / brotherly reconciliation folowed / great familiaritie vſed / the former grudges ſeemed to be forgotten. Yea the holie communion was vppon this happie agremente / alſo miniſtred. And this frindſhipp continued till the 13.
                     D. Cox with others come to Frankf.
                   off March folowinge / at whiche tyme. D. Coxe and others with him came to Frankford owte off Englande / who began to break that order whiche was agreed vppon / firſte in anſweringe alowde after the miniſter / contrary to the churches determination / and beinge admoniſhed theroff / by the Seniors off the congregation / he / with the reſt that came withe him made anſwere / that they woulde do as they had donne in Englande / and that they would haue the face off an Engliſh churche. And the ſundaie folowinge / one off his company withowt the conſent and knowledg off the congregation gate vpp ſuddainly into the pulpit / redd the lettany / and D. Cox withe his companie anſwered alowde / wherby the determination off the churche was broken. The ſame ſundaie at after noone it came to maiſter Knox his turne to preache / who hauinge paſſed ſo farre in Gen. that he was come to Noah as he laie open in his tente / he ſpake theis wordes folowinge.
               
                  
                     Theffecte of Knox ſermon.
                  As diuers thinges (ſaithe he) ought to be kepte ſecret / euen ſo ſuche thinges as end to the diſhonor off God and diſquieting of his churche ought to be diſcloſed and openly reproued. And therupon he ſhewed / howe that after longe trouble and contention amonge them / a godly agremente was made / and howe that the ſame / that daie was vngodly broken / whiche thinge / became not (as he ſaied) the prowdeſt off them all to haue attēpted / alleadginge furthermore that like as by the worde off God we muſte / ſeeke oure warrant for the eſtabliſhing off religion / and withowt that to thruſte nothinge into anie Chriſtian congregation: ſo for as muche as in the Engliſhe booke were thinges bothe ſuperſtitious / vnpure / and vnperfect (which he offred to proue before all men) he would not conſent that off that churche it ſhulde be receiued / and

that in caſe men woulde go abowte to burthen that free congregation therwith / ſo ofte as he ſhulde come in that place (the texte offringe occaſion) he woulde not faile to ſpeak againſte it.
               He farther affirmed that amonge manye thinges whiche prouoked godds anger againſte Englāde / ſlacknes to reforme religion (when tyme and place was graunted) was one. And therfore it became them to be circūſpecte / howe they laid their foundation. And where ſome men aſhamed not to ſaie / that there was no let or ſtopp in Englande / but that Religion might be / and was already brought to perfection / he proued the contrary / by the wante off diſcipline. Alſo by the troubles which maiſter Hooper Suſtained / for the Rochet and ſuch like / in the booke commanded and allowed.
               And for that one man was permitted to haue 3.4. or 5. benefices to the great ſlaunder off the goſpell and defraudinge off the flock off Chriſte off their liuely foode and ſuſtenaunce. Theſe were the chieff notes off his ſermon / whiche was ſo ſtomaked off ſome / eſpecially off ſuche as had many liuinges in Englande / that he was verye ſharplie charged / and reproued ſo ſoone as he came owte off the pulpit / for the ſame.
               The tweſdaie folowinge / 
                     D. Cox ſharply rebuked him.
                   was appointed to talke off thies thinges more at large. When all were aſſembled earneſte requeſte was made that D. Coxe with his companie might be admitted to haue voices in the congregation. Anſwere was made by others that the matter yet in controuerſie amonge them / ought firſte to be determined / Secōdly / that they ſhuld ſubſcribe to diſcipline as others had don before them / 
                     But that they refuſed, and at lenght ouer threw yt.
                   and farther yt was greatly ſuſpected that they had byn (ſome off them) at maſſe in Englande / and others had ſubſcribed to wicked articles / as one off them ſhortly after euen in the pulpit ſorowfully confeſſed. For theis conſiderations and ſuche like / The congregation withſtoode the admiſſion off D. Coxe and his companie▪ Knox'at

They had amonge them a booke off his intituled an admonition to Chriſtians written in the Engliſh tonge / wherin by occaſion he ſpake off the Emperour / off Philip his ſonne / and off Marie then Queene off Englande. This booke cericine off them preſented to the Magiſtrates / who (vpon receipte off the ſame) ſente for whittingham and aſked him off Knox their Miniſter / what manner off man he was: whittingham anſwered that ſuche a one their was amonge them and to his knowledge bothe a lerned / wiſe / graue and godly man.

But it ſeemed the magiſtrates abhorred this bloudly / cruell / and outragious attempt / for that when as certeine off Knox his enemies folowed hardly the Magiſtrates to knowe what ſhuld be donne with him / they did not onely ſhewe moſt euident ſignes of diſlikinge their vnnaturall ſuite / but alſo ſent for maiſter Williams and Whittingham / willinge them / that maiſter Knox ſhuld departe the City.

               The 25 off marche maiſter Knox the night before his departure made a moſte comfortable ſermon at his lodginge to 50. perſons or there abowte / then preſent / which ſermō was of the deathe and reſurrection off Chriſte / and of the vnſpeakable ioyes whiche were prepared for Goddes electe / whiche in this liffe ſuffre trouble and perſecution for the teſtimonie off his bleſſed name. The next daie he was brought 3. or 4. mile in his waie by ſome off ſome off thoſe vnto whom the night before / he had made that exhortation / who with great heauines off harte and plentie off teares cōmitted him to the lorde.
               The verie ſame daie beinge the 26.
                     Many off the lerned men were now come from al places.
                   off marche one Adulphus Glauburge (A Doctor off lawe and nephew to Maiſter Iohn Glauburge the Senator) whom D. Cox and the reſt had wonne vnto them / ſent for wittingham / and tolde him that there were preſented to the Magiſtrates thre Docters / 13. batchelers off deuinitie beſides others / and that the magiſtrates at their ſuites had graunted them the full vſe off the Engliſhe booke cōmaunding and charginge him therfore not to medle any more to the contrary.
                     This Adulphus was before this tyme a great fartherrer off the churche and the orders off the ſame howe ſo euer he was turned.
                   for (as he ſaied) it was fullie concluded that ſo it ſhuld be. And ſuppoſing that Whittinghā woulde let it what he might / the next daie againe he ſent for him home to his howſe where he gaue the like charge (D. Coxe and other preſent by whoſe procurement the ſame was donne)

Whittingham anſwered / that yff it were ſo concluded / he woulde willingly obaie / not dowtinge / but that it might be lawful for him and others to ioine themſelues to ſome other churche. But D. Coxe beſought the lawier that it might not ſo be ſuffred / wherto whittingham anſwered that it woulde be to great crueltie to force men contrary to their conſciences to obate all their diſorderly doinges / offringe / that iff it woulde pleaſe the Magiſtrates to geue him and others the hearinge / they would diſpute the matter againſt all the contrary parte and proue that the order whiche they ſought to eſtabliſhe / ought not to take place in anie reformed churche. The D. off lawe made a plaine anſwere that diſputation there ſhulde be none / vſing his former wordes off charging and commaundinge not to deale farther in that matter.
               
                  
                     Marck the placing off the Engliſhe book and off the reiecting thother.
                  When as the congregation harde off the cruell and more then tirannicall dealinges off this Doctor / Maiſter Gilby and others withe him / were ſente to maiſter Iohn Glawburge (by whoſe commaundment as ye harde / they had receiued the frenche order) puttinge him in remembrance off the ſame and ſhewinge him that certeine lately come amonge thē had ſought (as they were crediblie enformed) to ouerthrowe their churche by placing the Engliſhe booke amonge them. To this maiſter Glauburg made anſwere / that he was enformed howe that bothe partes were full agreed and contented / and that theruppon he had committed the whole matter to the lawier his couſen.
                     Marck this practiſe.
                   Then he aſked for whittingham: it was anſwered that ſtrait charge was geuen him that he ſhuld medle no more in that matter. The magiſtrate aſked againe off whom he had that commaundement / and when it was tolde him that the Doctor his couſen had geuen him that charge / he then began / verie gentlie to perſwade with maiſter Gilby and the reſt that they ſhulde be contented / and he would ſe that nothinge ſhulde be vſed but that which ſhuld be tollerable / and ſo maiſter Gilby withe the reſt departed.
               The 28. off marche D. Coxe aſſembled all ſuche as had byn Prieſts and Miniſters in Englande to his lodging and

there declared howe the Magiſtrates had graunted them the vſe off the Engliſhe booke / and that he thought requiſite that they ſhulde conſulte together / 
                     At lenght they agreed vppon the name Paſtor.
                   whom they thought moſte meete to be Biſhop / Superintendent or Paſtor withe the reſt off the officers / as Seniors Miniſters and Deacons. Wherunto maiſter Chriſtopher Goodmā anſwered that his opiniō was / that they ought firſt to agree vpon ſome perfect an godly order for the churche / and therto to haue the cōſent of the congregation wherby it might appeere / that they contemned not the reſte off their brethern: And farther / to proceade to the electiō which he thought alſo ought not to be attempted withowte the conſent off the whole churche. To this was anſwered that for the order / it was already determined / and other order then the booke off Englande they ſhulde no

               WHere as maiſter whittingham in this his letter makethe mention off a churche graunted them bothe at Baſill and Geneua / it is to be noted that he himſelff was the man whiche the oppreſſed congregation required to trauel therin and through goddes great mercy obtained it with great fauour / who (in his iourney) paſſed by Zurik to knowe off Maiſter Bullinger what he thought off the booke off Englande for that he (who had raported to maiſter Williams / Whittingham. Gilbie and others / that Cranmer Biſhop off Canterbury had drawen vp a booke off praier an hundreth tymes more perfect then this that we nowe haue / the ſame coulde not take place / for that he was matched withe ſuche a wicked clergie and conuocation / with other enymies) Euen he / I ſaie / yet ſtood in this that maiſter Bullinger did like well off thingliſhe order / and had it in his ſtudy. But when Whittingham had demaunded that queſtion / Bullinger tolde him / that indede Maiſter H and Maiſter C. aſked his iudgemente concerninge certeine pointes off that booke / as Surples / priuate baptiſme. Churchinge off wemen / the ring in mariage / with ſuche like / whiche / (as he ſaied) he allowed not / and that he nether coulde yff he woulde / nether woulde yff he might

/ vſe the ſame in his churche / what ſo euer had byn reported.
               Whittingham paſſinge from thence to Geneua / maiſter Caluin ſhewed him a letter ſent from D. Coxe and from 14. more off Franck. in whiche letter / they partly excuſed them ſelues that they put order in their churche withowte his coūſaile aſked / and partely reioycīge for that they had (as they ſaide) brought the moſte parte that had withſtande their doynges to their opinion / which not withſtandinge / was farr otherwiſe.
               They wrote alſo / that they had elected a paſtour / 2. Miniſters. 4. Seniors. and 2. Deacons / &c. but howe parciallie they proceaded in their elections (thoſe that were in office / nether diſcharged / nor yet their conſents required) I leaue to the conſciences off them whiche ſawe thoſe diſorders.
               To this letter off thers the contentes wheroff are aboue touched / maiſter Caluin anſwerethe in this wiſe.

                     BYcauſe that Maiſter Caluin in his letter maketh mention off lightes / ſome might gather that he was vntruely enformed / that in the Engliſhe booke lightes were preſcribed (the contrary wheroff appeareth by the deſcr

                     And for that maiſter Caluin in this letter earneſtly wiſhed that all ſtrife ſhulde ceaſſe / and that yff anie were minded to departe their departure might be ſuche / as all occaſions off offence might be cut of and cleane takē awaie: it was thought good to ſuche as were determined to go awaie with in 3. weekes after / to folowe his counſaile.

               WHen the Paſtour had redd this letter openly to the congregation and was deſired to knowe when they ſhulde haue an anſwere / he ſaied vnto them that ſo farre as he perceiued / it required none but that whiche might preſently be made / whiche was / that they might departe ſeinge they were ſo minded. It was replied that for ſo muche as it was manifeſt that they had byn ſlaundered not onely by letters into diuers partes / but alſo / by ſome that then were preſent / who had affirmed their departure to be a ſchiſme / and farther / that they coulde finde no indifferency at their handes: it was thought neceſſarie to commit the hearinge off that controuerſie to lerned and indifferent iudges / by bothe partes to be choſen wherby the faulte might appear where it was in dede / and ſo they either excuſed or founde giltie.
               D. Cox / at lenght / tolde them that their letter ſhulde be conſidered off / and an anſwere ſhulde be geuen them the fridaie after. On fridaie the 30, off Auguſte bothe partes mette: The Paſtor (accompanied with the Miniſters and elders) ſpake this vnto them. It ſeemeth very fonde that arbytrers ſhuld be apointed to take vpp ſtrife that maie come hereafter / as your letter ſignifieth. And furthermore / ye write / yff anie offence be taken or geuen / whiche ſemethe as ſtrange / for this worde (yff) importethe a dowte / ſo that yff ye dowte it is but follie to apointe arbitres. fynally / to excuſe your departure / yow call them vnlerned whiche iudge it a ſchiſme but (ſaithe)

he) terme it as yow lifte yet can yow not let men to think. And yff arbitres ſhuld pronounce it to be none / yet mennes opinions will be di

                     •
                  fore / your anſwere ſhall be / that iff anie man be offended either with any priuate mā / or publiquely / let him or them complaine to vs / or yff they refuſe vs / to the Magiſtrat.
               As for Arbitres / we will appoint none. Then ſpake whittingham and ſaied that it was to him no ſmall wonder that men of ſuche lerninge and wiſedome ſhuld ſo ſhrink in a moſte equall requeſte / and ſo / withowte all reaſon to cauill where no matter was offred. For / as concerninge (ſaithe he) the firſte pointe / it was not vnknowen to them that at that time / thorough their occaſion / their was no ſmall contention / and that ſeinge they had geuen ſuch offence it coulde not be but that mennes mindes were moued.
               And therfore / to thende that contention ſhulde growe no farther / Arbytres were very neceſſary / who neded not to deliberate (as he ſaied) off thinges to come whiche were vncerteine▪ but as the letter truly purporteth / off iniuries longe agoo begonne / yet continued / and here after not like to be ended excepte ſome good meane were vſed to ſtaie their ſlanderous letters and falſe reportes / to the vtter periſhinge and loſe off mennes Good names.
                     VVittinghā here interrupted.
                   And where ye ſeeme to be ofended that the letter ſhulde call them vnlerned / whiche terme oure departure a ſchiſme (yow omitt ſaide D. Coxe the 2. pointe / whiche is off no ſmall importaunce) to whom he anſwered that he thought he did them a pleaſure in omittinge thinges of ſo ſmall value / notwithſtandinge / he woulde obaie his will but (ſaithe he) as touchinge this worde vnlernedly / it was not vnaduiſedly placed. For either they be withowte lerninge / and therfore maie be ſo called in dede / or yff they beare the name off lerninge / yet in this they ſhewed their vnſkilfulnes for as muche as euery departure from a congregation was not a ſchiſme / nether were anie that departed for iuſte cauſes ſchiſmatikes as we (ſaith he) will proue vnto yow / yff yow will take

oure reaſonable and moſte equall offre. Naie / ſaithe the paſtor / Arbitres in this point can litle availe for be it they iudged it none / yet mennes thoughts are free / and we knowe that all men be not off one mynde in ſacraments and predeſtination / ſhulde men therfore take arbitres? Alſo ſaith he maiſter Caluin and Bullinger / are againſt yow. To this was anſwered / that thoughtes / yff they were not grownded vpon Goddes worde / were euell / neither was this controuerſie off like force withe the matter off the Sacraments and predeſtination / notwithſtanding / woulde to God that not onely the difference in thoſe articles but alſo in all other whiche be off waight and importaunce might be decided by the authoritie off Goddes worde and arbytrement off godly lerned men. But men maie iuſtly ſuſpecte your cauſe to be nought whiche refuſe the iudgments off the wiſe and godly.
               And where yow ſaie that Caluin and Bullinger are againſte vs / yow abuſe your ſelff and there names / for we knowe bothe what they and other wryte as touchinge this matter.
               Then the Paſtor aſked what ſchiſma was but a cuttinge off from the body / and that it was Caluins definition. To this Whittingham anſwered that he woulde vndertake firſte / to proue that definition to be falſe / and ſecondly to be nonone off Caluins definition for yff euery cuttinge off from the body ſhulde be a ſchiſme / then yow and all other whiche once had ſworne to the pope and now haue refuſed him are ſchiſmatiques. Then the paſtor added / from a churche well reformed. Anſwere was made that a churche well reformed muſte be builded vppon the doctrine off the Prophetes and Apoſtles / the vnitie wheroff S. Paule comprehendeth in theis wordes: one god / one faithe / one baptiſme / not beggerly ceremomies and obſcurations / although that ſundry cauſes beſides moued them to departe. Then Maiſter Treherren / aſked whither the donatiſts were not ſchiſmatiques.
               Yes / ſaith Whittingham and alſo heretiques / but yow are deceiued yff yow thinke that they ſeperated them ſelues

for ceremonies. It is manifeſt ſaid Treherren / that the churches off Aſia were excommunicate as ſchiſmatiques for that they kepte not Eaſter at the ſame time that the Romaine churche did. And it is no leſſe euident ſaid Whitthingham that Ireneus and other godly men aſwell off that time / as ſithens haue ſharply reproued and condemned Pope Victor for the ſame.
               Here D. Coxe put Whittingham in remembraunce that he had not anſwered to the faultes off the letter. Whittingham tolde him / that as touchinge that poore worde (yff) he marueled howe it coulde Miniſter anie cauillation / ſeinge / the text ioininge therto was ſo plaine / whiche declarethe bothe the offences by yow geuen and by vs taken. And alſo your conſciences beare yow witnes / the thinge to be moſte true excepte a man will be wilfully blinde / and finde a knot in a ruſhe / ſo that that worde (yf) mente not that we do / dowte who were oppreſſed with infinit wronges / but iff they woulde diſſemble ſo farre that they m
                     •
                  ght ſeeme to dowte theroff / yet / at the leaſte / they woulde abide the tryall theroff before theis Arbitres. But here the diſputation brake vp with this plaine and finall anſwere that arbitres they ſhuld haue none / and that yff they founde themſelues greued / they ſhulde ſeeke remedy where they thought Good and he the Paſtor withe the reſte off the congregation woulde anſwere them.
               The nexte daie the Paſtour / D. Coxe / maiſter parry and maiſter Aſheley ſent for Whittingham / Thomas Cole Iohn Fox / William Kethe / Roger harte / Iohn Hilton with certeine other / demandinge off them what ſhulde be the cauſe off their departure. Whittingham made anſwere that the daie before they had declared ſufficiently / and yet woulde farther ſhewe reaſons / yff they would permit the controuerſie to Arbytrement. And to the intent they ſhulde not counterfait ignorance (amonge other) theis were ſome cauſes firſte / their breach off promes / eſtabliſhed with inuocation off goddes name: 2. Their ordreles thruſtinge themſelues in to the churche. 3. Takinge awaie the order off diſcipline eſtabliſhed before

their comminge and placinge no other. 4. The accuſaſion off maiſter Knox their godly Miniſter off Treaſon and ſeekinge his bloude 5. Their ouerthrowinge off the common order / taken and commaunded by the Magiſtrate 6. The diſplacinge off officers withowte anie cauſe alleadged. 7. The bringing in off Papiſticall ſuperſtitions and vnprofitable Ceremonies whiche were burthens yokes and clogges / beſides other thinges / whiche / yff they woulde abide the triall they ſhulde heare at large. When he and ſome off the reſt had rendred their reaſons for their departure to this effecte / certaine warme wordes paſſed to and fro from the one to the other / and ſo in ſome heate departed.
               Not many daies after the oppreſſed churche departed from Franck. to Baſill and Geneua / ſome ſtayinge at Baſill as maiſter Fox with other. The reſt came to Geneua where they were receiued withe great fauour and mutche curteſie / bothe off the magiſtrates Miniſters and people. So ſoone as they entred their churche / they choſe Knox and Goodman for their Paſtor / and Gilby requeſted to ſuplie the rome till Knox returned owte off france.
               The lerned men whiche came from all places to Frank. abowte this matter (when they had donne that whiche they came for / they returned againe from whens they came / and ſome to other places / where they might ſaue charges / and not to be either burthened or bownde to the excerciſes of the congregation / ſo that / the exile whiche was to many a poore man full bitter / greuous and painefull / was (to ſome off the greateſt perſecutours off their poore brethetn (as it were / a pleaſant progreſſe or recreation.
               But nowe it ſhall be neceſſary to declare what order was taken in this newe erected congregation for the proſperous continuance off the ſame / whiche thinge to do / I cannot by a better meane then placinge here this letter folowinge whiche maiſter cole (late deane off Sarum) wrote to a frinde off his / whiles yet he ſtaied (behinde his company) in Franck. amonge them, his letter is yet to be ſeene.

                     THe tempeſte off the ſwellinge ſeas whiche in times paſte thretned ſhipwrack to euery veſſell that ſailed with a faire winde and full ſailes to the porte off bleſſed truthe / whiche off her ſelffe is ſtronge ynoughe / with owte anye barr or wall off mannes inuentions / are ſomewhat (the lorde be praiſed) caulmed to me warde / ſo that withowt farther reaſoninge they permit me to my conſcience as touchinge their ceremonies.
                     The cauſe I iudge is not for that they beare leſſe loue to them then in tymes paſt / but that they perceiue the ſturdy defendinge off them / to worke them that they looke not for / or rather / that whiche they are lothe to ſe / namely / the decreaſinge off their companie▪ yet they labour with policie what they maie or can / to preuent this daunger but yet that whiche they feare / I ſuppoſe will fall vpon them / vnleſſe god geue them to repent their olde faultes and humble them more to knowe them ſelues.
                     They haue ſet vp an vniuerſitie to repaier againe their eſtimation by mainteinance of lerninge (whiche ſurely is well done) that was fondly brought in decaie by willfull ignorance / in defendinge off ceremonies / to the whiche Maiſter horne is choſen to be the reader off the Hebrue lecture / Maiſter Mullings off the Greke / and Maiſter Treherren when he is ſtronge / ſhall take the diuinitie lecture in hande. Maiſter Whitthead was appointed therunto but bicauſe he woulde eſcape the labour off the lecture (for iuſte cauſes as he ſaide) he forſooke the paſtorall office alſo / ſtowtly (as yow knowe) denyinge to be in office anie longer. Great holde there was abowte this matter in the congregation / in ſo muche as they haſted to a newe election / and verie fewe (as it ſemed) were off a contrary minde / no / not his owne frindes ſauinge

Maiſter makebray and Maiſter Sorby / who deſired him to take reſpit / and the congregation to geue it. But ſome lookinge for the office themſelues woulde not in ſuche a matter ſuffer delay / but againe Demaunded off Maiſter Whithead whither he woulde keepe his office or no ſuppoſinge that he whiche had ſo ſtowtely denied it in worde / woulde not ſoone be flexible to the contrary. But he perceauinge that ſome woulde haue had him owte one the one ſide / and by leauinge off it / his eſtimation was like to decaie on the other ſide / (for many rough wordes were geuen him) when occaſion off intretie was offred / non reſpuit conditionem by that meanes bringinge to him ſelfe wittily / a triple commoditie / one / the preuentinge off them whiche looked for the office / an other / the refuſall off the diuinitie lecture / Thirdly / a faſter growndinge himſelff in that office / whiche he lefte in mouthe / but as it ſemed / not in harte. Thus ended that comedie.
                     But ſhortly after (notwithſtandinge a vehement ſermon made for the purgation from mannes inuentions) the ſeas begin againe to ſwell (ſo fickle an element is water) for Maiſter Kent hauinge a childe to Chriſten purpoſinge to haue it done ſimplie / withowte the bewtifinge off mennes traditions / came with his childe accordinge to the frenche order whiche we once receiued / and one to holde it there to profeſſe his faith yff it were required / but the paſtor denied the Chriſtening / vnles 2. Godmothers were had after the order off the booke / as concerninge the Godfather / Maiſter Makebray (who is nowe comme to that office) ſupplied it. A lucky matter is attained at Wezell in Weſtphalia / an open churche for oure Engliſhe men / to whiche bicauſe off nighneſſe) they feare many will go from hence / but moo wil come owte off Englande to yt. I pray yow commende me to M. Tell him that Maiſter wiſedom railed on them that were gon to G. Callinge them mad heades with many pretye names / I will not ſaie vnwyſely / But I maye well ſay vncharitably / in whiche Sermon / he ſhewed

him ſelff an Antagoniſt for the booke off Englande / &c.

               SHortly after thies thinges to wete / the 6. off Ian. When as maiſter Whithead gaue vpp off his owne good will / as he ſaide / the paſtorall office / Maiſter horne was in the election to ſuccede him / who proteſted that he woulde not medle therwith / till he were cleared off certeine ſuſpitions which ſome had bruted to the diſcredit off his miniſterie / and obtaininge his requeſte / he withe the Seniors entred the churche the firſt off marche Anno Domini 1556. were they receiued all ſuch perſons (as members off that churche) which were contented to ſubſcribe and ſubmit themſelues to the orders off the ſame. From whiche tyme forward the troubles and contious were ſo ſore amonge them / that who ſo ſhall well waie it with due conſideration / I ween / he ſhall think it to be the iuſte iudgement off our righteous God that fell vpon them / for ſupplantinge a churche there before them in great quietnes and off muche ſinceritie.
            
         
         
            The hiſtorie of that ſturre and ſtrife which was in in the Engliſhe church at Franckford from the
13. daie off Ian. Anno Domini 1557.

            THere fell a certeine controuerſie the xiij. daie off Ian. at ſupper betwene Maiſter Horne the Paſtor and Maiſter Aſheley whiche controuerſie was handled / with ſomewhat more ſharpe wordes then was meete / but yet they ſo departed / by the induſtrie and labour off ſome certeine perſons / that they dranke wyne one to an other / and all that ſtrife and contention was thought to be wholie taken awaie. Afterward / to witt / the 16. daie off Ian. at one off the clock in the after

noone / thre off thelders ſent for Maiſter Aſheley in to an howſe off one off the Elders and they began to debate the matter with him touchinge an iniurye done / not to the paſtor alone / but to all the Elders (as they affirmed) and to their miniſtery which thinge / Maiſter Aſheley denied that he euer did at any tyme.
            The next daie beinge the 17. off Ian. After that publique praiers were ended / Maiſter Aſheley was by the Paſtor and all the Elders called into the churche / and there / in the name off them all it was obiected vnto him / that he had ſpoken vpon the 13. daie off Ian. in ſupper while / certeine wordes tendinge to the ſlander off them and their miniſtery.
            Aſhely anſwered that he perceiued and vnderſtood that they all were offended as in their owne matter / and that therfore he wou

Then the Paſtor exhorted him that he would not ſo proceade / for yff he ſo did / that then they were minded to ſeeke and demaunde helpe off the magiſtrate agaynſt him A

And in the meane vvhile / they purpoſed to proceede thereafter againſte

            Wherupon certeine men did in the name off the whole churche demaunde off the paſtor and elders whither they were a parte againſt Aſheley. The paſtor anſwered in all their names that they were not a parte againſt him / but that Aſheley had ſlandered them all. Againe / it was demaunded in the name off the churche who were his accuſers / to whiche / vvhen the paſtor anſwered nothinge / neither in his owne name / nor in the name of the ſeniors: Aſheley was cōmaunded by the church publiquely and openlie to reade thoſe things whiche he had comprehended in vvrytinge concerninge his cauſe. Afterward the paſtor and elders were aſked vvither thoſe things vvhiche Aſheley had redd vvere true. The paſtor anſwered in all their names that they would not anſvvere either more largely or anie othervviſe / to anie queſtions then they had ervvhile anſvvered and ſo the congregation vvas diſmiſſed vvithowte anſvvere / yet not vvith ovvte cōtempt as was thought.

               I pray yow / that ſo many off yow as will mette at the tyme and place apointed to put downe your names / leſt ſome parhap maie come in vaine.
            
               Nowe all thoſe whoſe names are before reherſed came except maiſter warcope.
            
               After conſultation and aduiſe taken / it ſemed beſt to al them that were called together and mett there / that the nexte daie after / one off them in all their names ſhulde deale withe the Paſtor and elders / that ſith Aſhley complained that they were aduerſarie parte vnto him / they woulde ſuffer the churche / or ſome ſuche certeine perſons as the churche ſhulde appoint / to take knowledge off the cauſe / and to heare firſte whither they were an aduerſarie parte to Aſhley whiche iff they were not founde to be / then the knowledge off the matter ſhuld be put back againe to thē and that withe the ignominie and ſhame off him that had appealed from them. But yff they were founde to be aduerſary parte / that then it ſhulde ſeeme vniuſte / that they ſhuld ſit in their owne cauſe as iudges / but more meete and vpright it would be / that then the churche ſhulde knowe and vnderſtand off the whole matter / wherupon the next daie after / that is to ſaie / the 18 off Ian. when praiers were ended / the matter was propoſed to the paſtor and Elders / by one apointed for that purpoſe. When this counſaile was once knowē / the miniſter by the conſent off the Elders drew owte off his boſome a decree whiche the magiſtrate off that city had made / and redd it with a lowde voice before the whole churche. The decree beinge redd he added in graue wordes / that theis oure aſſemblies and meetinges woulde be verie daungerous no
                  •
                to vs onelie but to all the congregations off ſtrangers. for it was greatlie to be feared leaſt the magiſtrate beinge offended withe ſuch meetings / did not ſhut vp the gates off oure churche alone / but alſo off all the ſtrange churches And therfore that he (to thend he might in good ſeaſon prouide for ſuche daungers) would ſurely by Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline handle according to his deſerte / maiſter Halee (who then by occaſion of ſicknes was abſente) the author of that aſſemblie / and that he woulde pronounce of vs generally / that if it were not ſchiſmaticall / yet / that it did withowte dowte tēd to ſchiſme / hovv ſo euer we excuſed oure mindes ād purpoſes. moreouer he affirmed / that we had don verie yll / in that we had excluded / and ſhut owte certeine

which came in to the church in the time off oure conſultation and meetīge· Anſwere was made in the names of the churche / that that decree off the magiſtrate was by them before bothe read ouer throughly / vnd alſo verie diligentlie waied / and that they iudged that decree to be moſt vpright and iuſtlie to be feared off wicked and lewde men / ſuch as were ſectaries and factious perſons and that they did aſſuredly knowe that the threats of that decree did nothinge at all concerne them who were mett together to make peace and vnitie / and that they for this deede did ſo litle feare the angre and diſpleaſure of the magiſtrats that they truſted the magiſtrat woulde praiſe thē for this matter / yff parhappes he knewe off the thinge it ſelff and that therfore they were aſſembled and comme together that the whole matter might be quietlie ended amonge themſelues and not brought before the magiſtrat. for where we (ſaie they) were baniſhed men / and had by the meanes off a very good magiſtrate / receiued that ſinguler and moſte excellent benefit off reſte and quietnes / we ſhulde do that whiche ſhulde be moſt vnfit and vnſeemly for vs / iff we ſhulde by occaſion of our ſtriffes and hurley burlies / trouble the magiſtrate / and to render vnto that verie good Magiſtrate vnquietnes / troubles and ſtirrs whiche ſhulde be verie euell thankes / for ſo great a benefit off quietnes and reſt as we haue receiued. And we affirmed that we ſo muche the more dililigentlie and wilingly labored in pacifiynge and endinge this controuerſie bicauſe there were amongeſt vs certeine / who raſhly and with owte aduiſe / brought vnto the Magiſtrat all light and ſmall controuerſies / whiche might eaſilie haue bin determined and ended amonge our ſelfes / herein deſeruinge no fauour at all either at the the handes off ſo Good a Magiſtrat / whom they oftimes withowte cauſe troubled / or of their countrie men whom they by thies their priuie complaints and accuſations did amonge ſtrangers ſlander as vnquiet and troubleſome men / and that they had done no leſſe diſpleaſure to the goſpell we profeſſe / (whiche by occaſion off ſuche accuſations / is comonlie euell ſpoken off amonge the aduerſaries)

then to that ſo good a magiſtrate and to their owne countrie men. And that we therfore (to thende the Magiſtrate might not be troubled / nor our nation ſlaundered as vnquiet and troubleſome / nor the worde off God through vs euell ſpoken off) met together to take counſaile and auiſe howe al the matter might be peaceably ended and for no other cauſe or purpoſe. And where it was obiected that in that decree off the Magiſtrat there was no mention at all made / either off the whole churche / or off the authoritie off whole churche: We anſwere (ſay they) that we do not ſo interprete the Magiſtrats decree / as though yt were the Magiſtrats minde and pleaſure to take from the churche the right and authoritie due to the Churche and make the whole Churche ſubiecte to ſome certeine perſons. For we bothe well inoughe knowe by the example off the frenche churche in a like controuerſie / and we haue tried that ſo verie good a Magiſtrate hathe very great care off the churche. And as concerninge Ma
                  •
               ſter Hales / yt was anſwered / that he was then abſente / by reaſon off his ſickneſſe / and not for feare / or that he was giltie to him ſelff off any ill.
            And cōcerninge oure whole purpoſe and buſines / bycauſe it was ſaid thoughe oure mynds parhaps were vpright / yet the dede it ſelff was / yff not ſchiſmaticall / yet verelie tendinge to ſchiſme / anſwere was made in all our names that we woulde render accompte aſwell off oure mindes and purpoſe before God / as off our dede before the whole churche / and that vnder perill and paine off the laſte puniſhement that Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline can apointe / or yff the matter ſo r

               e / before the ciuyll Magiſtrate in paine off oure lyffe. And as touchinge them that were not admitted in to the churche / to our conſultation / it was anſwered that we were vniuſtlie accuſed / for that it was not a publick and common aſſemblie of the whole churche. But a metinge of ſome certeine perſons to conſulte of that whiche might be profitable / and that therfore they had no greater iniurie done thē in not beinge at the conſultation to whiche they were not called or ſent for / then if

had not byn admitted in to ſome certeine priuate ſtone or howſe. for as touching the churche / ſeinge it was then emptie and voide off people / it was / as it were / a priuate howſe. Nether is euery aſſemblie mett there to be counted the churche. For when the paſtor or ſome other readeth there a lecture / or moderateth the diſputations / it is not then a church but a ſcoole. And therfore / not the place / but the company off men gathered together did make a churche or congregation. Afterwards / it was ſkarcely by many wordes obtained off the paſtor and Seniors / that the churche might withowt their fauour and good will meete together for the finiſhing and takinge vp off this controuerſie / and vprightly determine whether the ſaid paſtor and elders were an aduerſarie parte to aſhley yea or no whiche thinge yet at the lenght the paſtor and elders graunted to the churche. And the paſtor and Elders beinge required and deſired that they would together be preſent with vs in the congregation / they anſwered that there was no ſuche nede / nether that they would at anie hand
                  •
                hinder vs. The next daie after / to wit / the 29. off Ian. the paſtor and Elders agreinge therto / as is ſaide before / when the whole churche was mette together / maiſter hales / who then was ſomewhat better / and was preſent when they began to take aduiſe and coūſaile / roſe vp and ſpake to this purpoſe. My brethern (ſaithe he) ſeinge I am accuſed of the paſtor before the whole churche / as the author of ſchiſme or of a ſchiſmaticall facte / or at the leaſt rendinge to ſchiſme / if yow alſo iudge of me in like ſorte I will departe oute off this companie / as one beinge vnmeete to tarie amonge yow in this aſſemblie. This beinge ſaide / he addreſſed himſelff to departe / Afterwards / he was called back by all the men there aſſembled and intreated to abide amongeſt them. Afterwarde he drewe foorthe thoſe letters by whiche he had called certaine men together to make peace and ende the ſtirre / as is before ſaide / and preferred them to the church to be openly redd. Whiche letter beinge redd / that / his dede was iudged off all them that were preſent / bothe honeſt and moſt meete for a Chriſtian man nether

that anie man that had called either others to make peace by their meetinge / was for ſuche a facte to be accounted a ſchiſmatick. Then they were all deſired / that ſeinge they had ſo iudged and determined / they would appoint this their ſentence to be regiſtred and put downe in writinge / that it might ſtande in ſteed off a recorde and teſtimonye / not for Maiſter Hales onely but for all other in the like caſe / and with all / that this newe and preſent vpſtartinge matter might by their iudgemēts be decided and ended leaſt it might bringe forth and ſtirre vv new contentions amonge them. Wherupon it was put downe in wrytinge to this effecte. Iff two / foure / eight / twelue or mo or leſſe / meete in the churche when it was voide off people / praier and other exerciſes / or els in priuate howſes to make peace betwene ſome members off the churche / or to conſulte off anie other thinge profitable for the church that that their dede and acte ſhulde not in anie caſe be iudged or eſteemed vnorderlie / ſeditious / ſchiſmaticall / or tendinge to ſchiſme.
            Neither that he whiche either by writinge or vvorde off mouth had ſo called them together ſhulde be thought to be the author off anie ſchiſme or a ſchiſmaticall facte or tendinge to ſchiſme and diuiſion. And bicauſe nowe no place off ſpeakinge in the congregation withowte offence did ſeeme anie more to be left to anie man / it was ordeined the ſaide 29. off Ian. that it ſhulde be lawfull for any man hauinge before deſired / off the paſtor / elders / and whole churche licence and libertie to ſpeak / to ſhewe his iudgement and opinion in the churche withowt any reproch off a diſordered dede therfore / ſo it be / that he did it godly quietlie and ſoberlie▪ yff he ſhulde ſpeake anie vngodly thinge that thē it was lawfull for the paſtor and Seniors / or anie off them foorthwith to commaunde him to holde his toung. The laſte daie off Ian. beinge the Sabath daie after morninge praier was ended / pardon was offred of all priuate offences / by the paſtor in his owne name and the name off the elders to all the people off the churche ād in like ſorte the people were deſired to pardon them yet in ſuche

ſorte this was done that the Paſtor and Elders woulde reſerue to themſelues ſuche cauſes as concerned their Miniſterie / to be purſued and followed off them. It was anſwered againe in oure names off the churche that we in like ſorte did pardon all men / all priuate grudges / yet / that the churche did accordinge to their example reſerue vnto it ſelff publike cauſes belonginge to the churche and the libertie theroff quietlie and Chriſtianly to be purſued and folovved / vvhich anſvvere allthoughe it were meaſured by the rule off that pardon and forgeuenes vvhiche the paſtor had before offred / yet / it did no white at al pleaſe him whiche thing alſo I warrāte yow he did not diſſemble. Afterwards / the paſtor and elders ſuffered that the ſame daie in the afternoone / the church ſhulde againe meete / and ſhulde trie owte and knowe the matter betvvene them and Aſheley / to vvit / vvhither they vvere an aduerſary parte / to Aſhley yea or no / But the Paſtor and Elders beinge deſyred that they alſo vvoulde be preſent / they vvoulde not therto agree. Wherfore the churche beinge gathered together in the afternoone / it was iudged by the teſtimonie off ſome meete mē and by this alſo / that in the vvhole churche there coulde no other be founde that woulde accuſe Aſhley but the paſtor and elders (for it vvas 3. times verie diligently enquired of and publiſhed amōge the people / that if their vvere anie in the vvhole churche whiche either vvould or coulde accuſe maiſter Aſhley / he ſhulde then vter it) It vvas I ſaie iudged and determined that the Paſtor and Elders / vvere an aduerſarie parte to Maiſter Aſhley and that therfore they vvere not fit and competent iudges in that matter. Furthermore / it vvas fullie decreed that the Paſtor and elders in ſuche cauſes as in vvhiche they vvere an aduerſary parte were not fit arbitres or iudges / but that ſuche cauſes did apperteine and belōge / either to the knovvledge off the congregation or off ſuch as the congregation vvoulde appointe to that purpos. And bycauſe the paſtor and elders haue bene oftētimes deſyred to be preſent vvith vs and yet vvoulde not (notvvithſtanding that they themſelues ſuffred the congregation to meete together) leaſte parhapp ſome deceite might be amonge many of the congregation as

thoughe it were not off it ſelff lawfull / or to ſmall purpoſe to apointe anie thinge with owte the paſtor and elders (whiche thing afterwarde tried) it was decreed that iff the paſtor and elders were required to be preſent at an aſſemblie and woulde not come / that the aſſembly was laufull notwithſtandinge their abſence / and that thoſe thinges whiche they decreed ſhulde be had and eſteemed as a lawfull decree. Theis Eccleſiaſticall decrees and ordinaunces / whiche euen nowe we reherſed were ſubſcribed vnto with the names off 33. perſons whiche is a great deale the bygger parte off the churche / and the 2. off February were offred vpp to the paſtor and Elders in the name off the whole churche with this proteſtation folowinge.
                  Maiſter No wel was the mouthe for the reſt.
                We preſent vnto yow theis our decrees and ordinaū
               ces agreing withe right and reaſon and not contrary to the holie ſcriptures / deſyringe to haue yow knowe them and further requiring that yow woulde with vs conſent / yelde and ſubſcribe to the ſame. Or yff ye will not ſo do / ſhewe we praye yow vpright reaſons and good cauſes why ye refuſe. For we are ready to correcte and amend oure faultes yff they be ſhewed vs / at the monition off any priuate perſon / but muche more at yours the paſtor and Elders. For as we deſier their wiſedomes to come to perfecte truthe: ſo we will not thorough ſtubbernes defende anie errour / beinge ſhewed vnto vs to be an errour in dede. Yet notwitſtanding / afterward vpon in the aforeſaie daie off February / the Paſtor did in his owne name and in the name off the Elders / openly reade certeine written letters to whiche he and the Seniors had before in the preſence off the churche ſubſcribed their names. The ſumme theroff was this. Seinge the churche had left vnto them a vaine ſhadowe onelie off authoritie withowte anie other matter / that therfore they did in oure preſence ſhake off from themſelues and vtterly forſake all Eccleſiaſticall miniſterie and ſeruice to the churche.
            Amonge other thinges they added this that we had geuen them a cauſe to complaine off vs to the magiſtrats / but that for oure ſakes they worlde not do it. Afterward ſome of

them departed and ſate downe in priuate mennes places / neither woulde they ſuffer ſo muche as to be called by the name off paſtors and Elders. Then one in the name off the whole / hauinge fullie ſhewed before / that there was no iuſte cauſe geuen thē by the churche / ſo to forſake their miniſterie / did afterward in the name of the whole churche verie earneſtly deſier thē that they woulde not in ſuche manner forſake and leaue the churche that had deſerued no ſuche thinge at their hands.

               rneſte and effectuall wordes required off them / thre or foure tymes in the name off the whole churche / but they remained willfull and obſtinate in their purpos / not ſo muche as once ſuffringe themſelues to be called by the name off paſtors and elders. Then at the lenght / it was ſhewed vnto them in the name off the whole churche / that the churche woulde not admit that their forſakinge of their miniſterie / but would ſtil take and eſteme them for their paſtor and Elders. And when one in the name off the churche did accuſe the paſtor and Chambers to be ſuche as had abuſed the churche / leauinge it and forſakinge it in ſuche manner withowte anie cauſe or reaſon ſhewed / and did in the name off the churche deſier them to make anſwere vnto him concerninge this their dede / they vtterlie refuſed the ſame. But horne who then was Paſtor / haſtely takinge a penne / wrote to this purpos in a pece of paper in his owne name and in the name off the elders. Where as we are vrged and preſſed by one in the name off the churche to make anſwere / we generally anſwere / that when ſo euer we ſhal be ordinarelie demaunded before the churche or them whiche the churche ſhall apointe / we will then anſwere / or if we ſhall be called before the ciuill magiſtrate we will ther anſweare. other anſweare then this they woulde geue none / to anie off the queſtiōs whiche we had propoſed in all oure names of the churche. (and they aſſigned this writinge by puttinge to their names) where as in dede this was not onelie to anſwere nothinge at all / but alſo to pretēd a cloaked cauſe of anſweringe nothinge at all. Moreouer / they were deſired in the name of the churche that they woulde deliuer

to the churche the letters ſigned withe their owne hādes / by whiche they had ſhewed their renounſall and denyinge of the miniſterie: or if they woulde not do that / that thē againſt a certeine daie they woulde graūte and giue to the churche a coppie therof. But neither woulde they geue them the letters whiche they had in their boſome neither woulde promiſſe any copie to the churche / who moſte earneſtlie required the ſame off thē. At the laſte / the paſtor and elders departed / ſome certeine fewe folowinge thē / but the multitude remained and ſo farrforthe as they coulde remember / committed to writinge the actes off that daie and the ſumme off thoſe letters (by whiche the Paſtor and Elders had willingly put them ſelues from the miniſterie) ād for witneſſe ſubſcribed thereto with thirtie and there names. The next daie after / that is / the 3. off February the Paſtor and Elders beinge called off the churche by the Deacon / to intreate off makinge peace / they came together ād met. But the Paſtor and elders ſet them downe in priuate places. Afterwardes / the paſtor (becauſe one ſpeakinge in the congregation did not by and by ſo ſoone as he bad him holde his peace) fayned that he woulde departe. But when he perceyued that verie fewe folowed him / and by ſome conſailed / he returned / and ſuddanly placed himſelff in the paſtors place / and called the elders to him / whiche thinge / before he had refuſed to do although he were by the whole churche verie inſtantly and erneſtlie required therto. Then / he ſpake to this effecte: we in dede (ſaith he) did diſplace oure ſelues from the miniſterie / not withſtandinge / abſolutely and fullie we did it not / but vnder this condition onely / yff yow ſhulde proceade to deale in ſuche ſorte as yow haue done againſt the olde ād receiued diſcipline. Nowe then / yff ye goo forwarde as yow haue appointed and purpoſed / then will we wholie and alltogether diſplace oure ſelues from oure Miniſteries / but yff yow will obaie the olde diſcipline then will we continew paſtor and elders as we are. Anſwere was made that there was nothinge at all conteined in the olde diſcipline / wherby they might medle with / or proceed againſte the paſtor and elders / iff parhapps

they were founde faultie and in ſome offence. Moreouer / that there was nothinge put downe concerninge ſuche cauſes / as in whiche the paſtor and elders were an aduerſarie parte / and therfore it was deſired that they woulde ſuffer the diſcipline in that behalff to be amended and to be made more perfect. Nowe the paſtor beinge offended as it ſhuld ſeeme / with ſo free ſpeeche woulde im̄ediatlie againe haue bin gone / and rann euen to the churche dore / but yet ſeinge but fewe folowinge him / by the counſaile and aduiſe off certeine perſons he returned / and ſat him ſelff downe in the paſtors place with the ſeniors.
            And in like ſorte / by and by againe vppon the ſuddaine / he ran̄ for the thirde tyme / but within a litle while after here turned and planted himſelff in the paſtors accuſtomed place. Afterwards intretie was made with the paſtor and elders in the name off the church / that they would ſuffer Aſhleis cauſe (in whiche matter they themſelues were founde at the lenght to be an aduerſarie parte) and the hearinge theroff to come before the churche / And that the churche woulde (yff Aſhley were founde faultie) verie ſharply and ſeuerely puniſhe him / and in this behalff aboundantly ſatiſfie the paſtor and Elders and all good men. But the paſtor and Elders would at no hande ſuffer that. And as concerninge the amendinge off the diſcipline / the paſtor ſaide that he and the elders with certeine others by the authoritie off the church beinge ioined vnto them woulde (yff the churche ſo thought good▪ amende the diſcipline. But anſwere was made vnto bothe / in the name off the churche. Firſt that it was verie vniuſt that / the churche ſhuld not be ſuffred to haue iudgement and determination. For therby the authoritie and right off churche was wholie as it were / taken from the churche. To the ſeconde it was anſwered that ſith ſuche ordinaunces and decrees were to be made / as by whiche the Paſtor and Elders ſhulde be hereafter deteined in dutie (ſome off them alſo beinge already accuſed) it ſhulde be vniuſte dealing to admit them to the framinge and makinge off ſuche decrees. And when they affirmed

they would anſwere no other thinge / and they were deſired to ſuffer thos things to be cōmitted to writinge whiche were done alreadie / they woulde not agree / but the paſtor ſayinge he was a colde made himſelf ready to departe / ād goinge his waie a fewe folowinge him / he pronownced / that he diſſolued the aſſemblie. But the companie that taried in the churche and wrote the doings of that daie by their decree / and appointed 8. men to amend the diſcipline / and Afterward to offre it the churche to be ſeene of thē / did alſo apointe other. 8. men (of whiche 8. three / allwaies ſtuck the paſtor) arbitres and iudges to decide the cauſe betweene the paſtor and elders / ād Aſhley. Theis are their names. maiſter Railton / maiſter Warcope / M. Kelke M. faulconer / M. Bentham M. Cockroft / M. Carell and M. Wiſon. Three off theis were addicted the to paſtor but M. Bentham and M. Kelke alwais ſhewed themſelues indifferent and equall to bothe ſides. From that time forwarde the paſtor and elders and certaine others beinge often times called of the churche / by the Deacons and certeine other to intreate of making peace and agrement / would neuer apeere or be preſent.
            Morouer the paſtor and the Deacons / and certaine painefull poore men / ceaſed bothe from preachinge and alſo the Eccleſiaſticall lectures and other ordinary functions and charges whiche they ought to haue executed / neither woulde they come to ſolemne and publick praiers in the churche. notwithſtanding the churche yet thorough Gods fauour obſerued bothe publike praiers / ſermons and Eccleſiaſticall lectures / and all other things accuſtomed and minded to keepe them ſo longe as the godlie Magiſtrats ſhulde ſuffer and graunt the ſame. And no other matter did ſo muche ſpread abroad throughowt the citie as the fame and reporte off oure ſtriffes and as the dede off maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers. For when they off themſelues had forſaken the churche and had by their example ſtirred vp ſome other with their families to do the like / and ſome off theis nowe frequented and went / partely to the frenche churche / and partly to the Germanie

churches / the matter nowe coulde not anie longer be hyd and in ſecret ſeinge it was publiſhed and knowen not thorowe the citie alone / but the fame theroff ran̄ to other ſtrangers alſo▪ whiche matter and buſines withe their brethern / woulde to God they had choſen rather to haue had it ended quietlie and peaceablie in their owne churche / then in ſuch trobleſome ſorte to haue conſulted ſo greatly / bothe to their owne diſhoneſtie and oures. The fourth daie off Februarie which was Thurſdaie and appointed for publick praier / the paſtor who that daie ſhuld haue preached / and all the Elders were abſent. Nowe the paſtor beinge before by the Deacon deſired in the name off the churche that either he himſelff would preache or apoint ſome other in his place / made anſwere / that neither woulde he preach him ſelff nor apointe anie other. For that matter did nothinge at all belong vnto him. After praiers were ended ſome there were that diſputed and reaſoned in the paſtors behalff and ſaide / that that aſſemblie whiche remained after the paſtors departure (in as muche as he had authoritie to call together the churche and to breake vp the aſſemblie and he goinge his waie ſaide / that he brake vp that aſſemblie) was no lawfull aſſemblie. To whom it was (in the name off the churche) anſwered / that Maiſter Horne had put owte himſelff from his paſtorall dewtie / and therfore / both for that matter and manie other recited before amonge the Act. of the 2. daie of Feb. he had not anie authoritie / or any māner of right either to gather together or to break vp the aſſemblie. And although it were graunted that he were their lawfull paſtor / yet / it was affirmed that the churche was aboue the paſtor and not the paſtor aboue the churche ād that therfore thowghe the paſtor departed / before the actes off that daie were confirmed / and pronounced that he brake vp the aſſemblye yet was the aſſemblie whiche remained ād taried behind a lawfull aſſemblie / ād had authoritie to make effectuall decrees / by whiche they might binde all ād euery mēber of the churche with owte exception. And that this queſtion (whither the pope was aboue the churche or the churche aboue the pope) was ſtirred vp in the councelles off conſtance and Baſill / and vvas decided

alſo by the authoritie off the ſchole off pariſe ioyned therto. Nowe they whiche reaſoned in the paſtors behalff did ſeeme by the ſpace off certein daies after / to approue thes 2. councells / for they placed the paſtor aboue the churche. They brought foorth openly all the olde ſtore and howſholde ſtuffe of Pighius and Eckius of the primacie of the pope vnder the name off the Paſtorall authoritie and for the proffe theroff. The actes and diſputations off that daie were in teſtimonie / ſigned and confirmed vvith two and thirtie names. The 5. off Februa. Maiſter horne and the ſeniors beinge required off the congrega

               ion by a deacon to come and treate off reconciliation woulde not appeare. After this there were 3. Meſſengers ſente from the congregation vnto them / off whom / one was to be ſpecially reuerenced off all that be off the congregation bothe for his age and grauitie / the other
                  •
                ſpecially well lerned / to the intent they ſhuld be moued by theis ſo honeſt a company off Meſſengers ſent by the congregation. Theis men / whē they had in the churches name inſtantly deſired / and praied them that they woulde come to the congregation and there common brotherly amonge themſelues for a quyete agrement to be had / ſo as the matter might not come to the magiſtrates eares / nor be bruted anie farther abroade to the great infamie of oure nation / coulde do no good with them at all. for they ſaide they woulde not come vnleſſe they were ordinarily called. As for other anſwere at that preſent they would make none. When this anſwere was declared to the congregation / it was determined that for aſmuche as R Horne had openly put himſelf owte off his paſtorſhipp by writinge ſubſcribed with his owne hand / and confirmed the ſame by wordes and deedes in lōge abſteining from preachinge and other paſtorall functions / and affirminge that ſuche matters were no point off his charge. In as muche as now beinge called of the churche / he will not appere / and ſo abſteinethe all together from publicke praiers and all Eccleſiaſticall meetīgs: And for aſmuche alſo as the Seniors come not at the meetings of the churche / leaſte the congregation thorough the forwardnes of

the ſaied Robart Horne and abſence off the Seniors / beinge voide and deſtitute off common praier / preachinge / and readinge the ſcriptures ſhulde be vtterly diſſolued / that certein men ſhuld take charge off the churche and for all things to be done in the congregation as it hathe by Gods goodneſſe byn yet hitherto done.

               ff bothe maiſter Horne and maiſter Chambers and other in their behalf did finde verie muche faulte with vs / for that we had proceaded vnordinarilie / that is (yow muſt vnderſtand) contrary to the olde diſcipline. For where they coulde not iuſt
                  •
               y finde faulte with thoſe thīgs that the churche had done / they made cauillation at the manner off doinge off things as an vnordinary man̄er. And we anſwered as well manye other things grewe now by occaſion off that matter / as this chiefly: in caſe Maiſter Chambers or anie other man / either woulde or coulde ſhewe anie ordinarie waie in the olde diſcipline wherby the congregation / or anie other might com

But yff neither he nor anie other woulde or coulde ſhewe in deede / that they would not be diſcontent at vs that reduced the congregation to their right authoritie and amended that olde diſcipline as athinge amiſſe / or filled it vp as a thinge vnperfect and brought the matter to the hearinge off the churche as it ought to be:

And that they woulde at lenght geue ouer to vaunte them ſelues ſo off the order whiche they neuer had / or to blame vs hereafter for proceading vnordinarely. The ſumme off this anſwere / we dyuyded in to certein Articles / and ſent them pryuately to Maiſter Horne to peruſe / requiring his anſwere to the ſame vnd alſo we ſticked them vpon the pu
                  •
               pit in the churche where they remained a great many daies. And where it was required in that ſame writinge that Maiſter Horne / or the Seniors or ſome other man ſhulde make anſwere vnto thes matters / there is no man yet hitherto that hather made anye anſwere / either by worde or by writinge / ſauinge that Maiſter Horne fallinge to his olde generall anſwere / ſaide / he woulde make anſwere when he were ordinarely called or queſtioned withe for by this ſhift he thinkethe he vndoeth all dowtes at once / where as in dede / to anſwere after that ſorte / is to anſwere nothing at all / but to pretend falſe cauſes to holde his tonge when he is able to ſhewe no reaſon for himſelff. For this was his meaninge that he is not ordinarely called nor queſtioned with all / nor accuſed ordinarely / ſauinge onely before him ſelff / and the Seniors as Iudges / Where as they bothe in their geuinge ouer off their miniſtery / and in the principall cauſe againſt maiſter Aſhley were the aduerſary parte ſo that by his iudgement there is no ordinary waie to medle againſt the paſtor and Seniors excepte they call themſelues to be hearers of their owne cauſe and their owne Iudges themſelues. For other ordinary waie againſt the paſtor and Seniors in that olde diſcipline off theirs / neither he nor anie other ſhall be hable to ſhewe.
            After this / when thoſe 8. Perſons which were appointed by the Churche to heare the variance betwene Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers one thoneſide / and Maiſter Aſley one the other ſide / ſhulde proceade in the hearinge off that matter / Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers whiche had abſented themſelues nowe 11. daies from the churche were commaunded by the Magiſtrate the 12. off February (for that daye / they and certeyne others were ſeen with the

Magiſtrate) that they ſhuld in no wiſe comme at our church. when we harde off yt / we had maruell / fyrſte that the matter was comme to the Magiſtrats eare (for Maiſter Horne and the reſte teſtified the 2. off February by their owne hand writinge / that they would neuer open it to the Magiſtrate) and ſecondarely / ſeinge Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers coulde by no meanes be intreated to come to the churche yt ſemed awonder that yt was commaunded by the Magiſtrats that they ſhulde not come / as though they had byne deſyrous to come / whiche in dede neded not.
            Therfore / the moſte parte thought that that commaundement was obtained by their owne ſute / at the Magiſtrates hands / bothe that ſuch perſons as knewe not the matter / ſhuld be perſwaded that yt was longe off the Magiſtrats commaundement that they did not their offices in the Church. Where as before this Commaundement was geuen they had off a purpoſed frowardnes abſented themſelues now allready more then ten dayes from the congregation. And alſo beſides / that the congregation might not proceade agaynſt them ſeinge the Magiſtrate commaunded them that they ſhulde not appeere. And this was the very let in dede why the congregation proceaded not in hearinge and determining off the varyance betweene Maiſter Horne and Chambers off the one partie and Aſhley on the other.
            And in this they burthen vs maliciouſly with owte cauſe / As thoughe we woulde haue Aſhley ridd from Iudgment off that matter / and as though that were the onely thinge whiche was ſought in oure contention / where as in deede yt was longe off them that his cauſe was not determined. Wetherfore / hauing knowledge off this matter / for feare leaſt we ſhulde be falſely accuſed / as though we had vttered yt to the Magiſtrate / and had ſeemed / firſt to haue accuſed our brethern vnto the Magiſtrate / whiche we might not abide to do / aſſembled together

in the churche the 13. off Februar. and there was openly recited in writing this that folowith. Foraſmuche as oure contention is alreadie bruted abroad not onely through this citie but alſo come to the Magiſtrats eare (for we heare ſaie that maiſter Horne and maiſter Chamber were commaunded by the magiſtrat yeſter daie that is the 12. off Febr. that they ſhulde in no wiſe come at the congregation till the magiſtrate had fuller knowledge off the ma

               . off Febru: by the congregation to amende the diſcipline / preſented

the booke off the Diſcipline to the congregation agayne and the congregation allowed it. And thoſe matters that were altered or augmented in the diſcipline were ſuch as ſpecially perteined to thoſe cauſes / wherin the paſtor and ſeniors were the one parte / and howe it muſte be proceaded againſt the paſtor and ſeniors / in caſe anie off them were accuſed. For concerninge theis thinges there was neuer a worde in the olde diſcipline.

            For where maiſter Chamber had authoritie to gather all godly mennes almeſe for the poore off the congregation confirmed vnto him (as he him ſelff required) in writinge / ſigned by the paſtor and ſeniors and certeine other off the chieff men off the churche with their owne hands / and had exerciſed the ſame gathering nowe a yere / and half / that he alone / ſhulde receiue all / he alone diſtribute / and be accomptable to no mā and he alone to be priuie to the mony / that matter) were he neuer ſo faithfull a man) ſemeth verie ſuſpitious to him and

            And for as muche as the Deacons (vnto whom the charge off the churche monie ſemeth to apperteine by the worde of God / and by the example off all right
                  •
               y inſtituted churches) in oure congregation had not a mite to beſtowe: for their were made Deacons honeſt men in dede / but yet ſuch as for their poueritie ſemed not fit men to whom the common mony ſhuld be cōmitted: and by that coulour Maiſter Chamber thought he might with owte controlinge receiue all the cōmon

monye in his owne handes alone. The congregation thought good to haue a deaconſhipp appointed more vprightly according to the rule deſcribed in the Actes off the Apoſtles / and the example off other Godly inſtituted churches / and to the intent the Church mony might be medled with all by the Deacons with owte all ſuſpition it is prouided in the amendinge off the diſcipline that ſuche men ſhulde be choſen Deacons / as be not onely off a moſt aproued Good fidelitie / but alſo ſuche as were able hanſomly to liue off their owne withowte anie nede off the Churches Almes. And in dede this ſeemed to be nowe ſo muche the more neceſſary / for that many complained: ſome that the almes whiche they receyued before priuatlie off priuate frinds was taken vpp by the waye / ſythens Maiſter Chamber began to gather / as in dede Maiſter Horne then Paſtor threatned openly owte off the pulpit in his Sermon ſayinge that he woulde ſtoppe all mennes vents (as he termed it) and receiptes. Againe / ſome complaine that they coulde haue nought at Maiſter Chambers hande / but after beſeching and vnreaſonable longe delais / ſome that they coulde haue nothing with owte bytter vpbraid

                and ſome / that they could obtaine nothing off gyfte but onely off loane / and other ſome that they coulde gett nought at all. So that nowe it ſemed requiſite off neceſſytie to ſeeke ſome remedie for theis miſheues. All whiche complaints we ſhall be conſtrained off extreame neceſſitie to put in to one ſeuerall peece off worke touching the whole matter and communicatinge it to good men. And concerning the Diſcipline / ſeinge there was no certeine expreſſe waye in the olde diſciplyne how the congregation ſhuld be gouerned / neither coulde anie longe quietnes indure ſo longe as Maiſter Horne had the gouernement by that diſcipline. And ſeing nowe Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers haue vtterlie forſaken the Churche / not onely themſelues / but alſo haue drawen awaie with them many other / and of them / the moſt parte ſuch as were appointed preachers and readers off the Scriptures: ſo as they might plainely appeere to ſeke nothinge ells but that

the congregation beinge deſtitute off preaching and reading (as thoughe it coulde not ſtand withe owt thoſe men) ſhulde be vtterlie broken vpp / the congregation was off neceſſitie enforced to deuiſe and prouide for ſome certeine waie for the gouerning off the churche / wherby the congregation might be ſet at a fyrme and a conſtant quietnes.

The ſame daie at after noone the Magiſtrates hauing more plaine intelligence off the matter / commaunded by their edicte / ſubſcribed with their handes / that Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers ſhulde medle no more the one with the paſtorſhipp and the other withe the Seniorſhipp till all the controuerſies were throughly harde and decided.

            The laſte off Feb. the Magiſtrate came to oure Temple a litle before ten off the clock and there off his authoritie reconcilied certeine off the congregatiō that were at variaunce amonge them ſelues / and tooke order that all former offences ſhulde be vtterly extincte and buried in the graue off forgetfulnes. Wheruppon at the commaundement / and in the preſence off this Magiſtrate / the parties ioined handes together in token that they were reconcilied and were Good frinds and lovers. Afterwarde / the paſtor / Elders and Deacons / were put from their Eccleſiaſticall functions by an Edict ſigned and ſubſcribed with three off the Magiſtrates handes and were all made priuate men / as the reſt off the congregation: And by the ſame edicte off the Magiſtrates it was decreed that that congregation might freely / when they woulde

            Although (ſaide he) it were meete that we all ſeuerally geue oure voices / yet that we maie be no longer an hinderance / I pronoūce in all their names / that we all do by our voices chuſe thoſe 14. men Whom yow haue alreadye appointed.

                  M. Horne came not til two.
                Elected agreed betwene themſelues to aſſemble and come together the fourth of marche at one of the cloke at afternoone. Whē they came together ther was muche a doo a great while whither the olde diſcipline ſhulde be corrected or a newe made. We (of the churche) alleadged that all occaſions off olde controuerſies (wheroff the olde diſciplie but vnperfecte and naught was one) were vtterly taken awaye by the magiſtrates Edicte. ſome vrged this worde corrected / or amended which was in the aduiſe and counſaile that the Magiſtrat gaue vs for the ſpedie diſpatche off diſcipline. For / ſaide they / that is not corrected whiche is cleane taken waie.
                  The book of diſcipline brought foorth and read.
                At lenght / the booke off the olde diſcipline and an other off the newe diſcipline / whiche was corrected in the abſence off maiſter Horne and others were read / and ſo they departed for that daie appoynting to meete agayne the 8. off marche the ſame houre.
            The 8. off marche the 15. men aſſembled againe and there agreed vpon articles for makinge off diſcipline / 
                  M. Horne came at 3.
                whiche were ſet downe in a paper and ſubſcribed all vnto them / ſauinge that maiſter Horne / Maiſter Chambers and Maiſter

Iſaac and Maiſter Bentham woulde not ſubſcribe to that Article concerning the hauinge off two miniſters off the worde / and yet notwithſtandinge they all agreed vpon this that is was a matter indifferent whither there ſhuld be one or many miniſters off the worde. for it is not defined in the ſcriptures but left free. Afterward Maiſter Hales gaue to Maiſter Chambers a booke off diſcipline (which was writen in the abſence off maiſter Horne and others / and was off the ſame Articles as the congregation had made and agreed vpon) that maiſter Horne / and he / and maiſter Iſaac might reade it ouer / and if they allowed ought therin that it might be annexed to the diſcipline that was in hande. But afterwarde / when maiſter Horne through occaſion off talke abowte the correctinge off the diſcipline / ſaide that there had byn no other diſcipline in the churche / but that olde diſcipline / and that therfore the magiſtrate / ſpake off correctinge off that no

               ter aboliſhinge theroff and that it was anſwered / that that ſame other booke off diſcipline beinge written when he was abſent might as well be vnderſtoode to be ment / as that ſame olde diſcipline▪ bothe for that there was more equitie in it and alſo was ſuſcribed vnto off ſo many as well as that olde diſcipline whiche he ſo extolled: Then maiſter Horne brake owte in to moſt ſpitefull wordes againſt all his countrie men that had agreed to that diſcipline which were at the leaſte 36. perſons / affirminge that all they that had thus conſpired together for the eſtabliſhing off thoſe articles (accordinge to the ſhortnes off the time wherin they met) that they were in a certeine degree / giltie off treaſon againſte the magiſtrat / againſt the Senate / and (to be ſhorte) againſt the whole citie.
            Then maiſter Hales vnderſtandinge by maiſter Hornes wordes that nothinge was ſought but newe trouble / and beinge put in minde alſo aff maiſter Bentham) reherſeth agayne that booke off diſcipline which a litle before was offred to maiſter Chambers affirminge that he vnderſtode / they went abowte to ſeeke rather an occaſion off chalinginge at the booke by readinge off it / then a way off makinge a new diſcipline.
            
               The eleuenth off marche the fiftene men meete againe vpō certeine Articles to whiche (excepte one whiche maiſter Horne and M. Chambers would not ſubſcribe) they al ſubſcribed.
            A litle before our departure it was thought profitable that thoſe thinges which we had collected and agreed vppon ſhulde be brought in to a certeine forme of a booke / adding either owte off the olde diſcipline / or by occaſion / as we were gatheringe theis thīges together ſuch things as might ſeeme profitable. Maiſter horne / and maiſter Chambers beinge intreated / that they would gather thoſe things in ſuche ſorte / or ells be preſent to conferre withe other that reade: Maiſter Horne anſwerethe that he woulde not / neither that there was any ſuche neede. The 16. daie of marche they met againe in the churche and there a certeine bill (in whiche were writen certeine articles tendinge to diſcipline) is exhibited vnto them that amonge the fiften it might be deliberated vpon and debated. maiſter Iſaac ſpake many things verie ſharplie againſt one Article as verie daungerous and perilous againſte thoſe good men through whoſe liberalitie the poore off the church were ſuſteined / and makinge wiſe as thoughe he woulde knowe the matter better / he requeſted the bil / whiche / beinge reached vnto him / he putteth it vp in his boſome / neither woulde he geue it againe. And ſo by this meanes / he tooke away the matter for vs to worke vpon ſith that we had no other copie.
            Afterwarde / the booke in whiche thoſe thinges were written that were agreed vppon amonge the 15. and certeine thinges owte off the olde diſcipline / and other alſo were gathered in to ſome order was brought owte amōge them to be conſulted vpon / and beinge redd / maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers fyrſte off all complained / that booke was gathered they not wittinge theroff / and had byn longe beatten vppon amonge certeine of them / and therfore that it was reaſon that a copie ſhuld be geuen to them / and to maiſter Iſaac and a farther tyme alſo to delyberate / maiſter Iſaac affirmed that he neded 2. monethes / or one at the leaſte to conſider off that booke. It was anſwered that although Maiſter Horne and

Chambers complained that they were not admitted to the collectinge off the booke) in that they did vs wronge / for beinge of vs therunto required they refuſed it and left it to others. In that they required a copie / it ſemed vniuſte / (ſeinge that the church had decreed / that we the 15. ſhulde debate tog

For if to the moſte it ſhulde ſeeme reaſonable he would at anie hande hauie a copie off that booke Euery man therfore was aſked / beginninge at Maiſter Bentham: he / aſwell forthe cauſes before alleadged as alſo that no occaſion off wranglinge might ariſe off the booke / and leaſte the booke ſhulde come to the handes off anye other before it were brought to the congregation / and for certeine other cauſes / thought it not meete that anie copie ſhulde be geuen to anie / but that the booke ſhulde be brought foorthe amonge them / and

all they hearing it that were appointed off the congregation / it ſhulde be after read and that tyme enoughe ſhulde be geuen to ſtande vpon euerie decree and ſentence and more exactly to examin them: and that this ſeemed to him very iuſte and reaſonable. And this iu

                  Yff maiſter Horne tooke ſuch deliberattō before he would ſubſcribe to that article: what meanethe this that poore ignorant men and wemen muſt thus ſubſcribe vpō the ſudden or ells to newgate.
                in the bookes off the olde and newe Teſtamente / in whiche is conteined fullie all doctrine neceſſary for oure ſaluation. To this and ſuche other beinge moſte plaine and manifeſte maiſter Horne anſwered as to all thother that he woulde anſwere nothinge with owte great deliberation. By whiche his doinges / he gaue occaſion to all men to wonder. And ſo / ſome other decrees off that booke beinge examined a meetinge off the 15. was appointed againſte the nexte daie / and ſo they departed. The nexte daie beinge the 17. off march and againe the daie folowinge beinge 18. twelue off the 15. mette. For Maiſter Iſaac / Maiſter Horne and Chambers came not. Vpon bothe daies the diſcipline was more diligently read and examined / and off eleuen off them whiche were appointed / alowed and ſubſcribed vnto. Vpon the 20. daie off marche the diſcipline was offred to the whole congregation / that it might of them either in the whole or in parte be alowed or diſalowed / and the ſame daie was it twiſe reade ouer.
            After the readinge Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers require a copie off the diſcipline / that at their leaſure they might farther deliberate vpō it. It was anſwered that it was to be opēly read and reade againe / bothe to them and others

/ as often as they woulde / with time ynough geuē to euery man more diligently to examine euerie Artikle / but ſeinge the Magiſtrate had commaunded that we ſhulde exhibite to them a copie off the diſcipline turned in to laten / ſo ſoone as poſſible might be / Therfore we durſte not ſcatter any copice before the Magiſtrate had ſeene it. Beſydes that we feared leaſte Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers (Who were amonge the 15. (appointed) off the churche for the writinge off the diſcipline who might alſo when they woulde not onely he are the diſcipline but alſo examine the ſame diligently / and yet woulde not meete with the others at the appointed time) would requeſte a copie not ſo muche to knowe the diſcipline as to ſturre vpp newe broiles. Neuertheles when the Magiſtrate had once ſeene it / leaue to be geuen to anye man that woulde to ſe it. Withe this anſwere they and ſome others beinge offended / at the ſecond readinge off the diſcipline they departed a waye and abſtained agayne with their whole howſoldes from the churche / from publick prayers and ſermons whiche thinge blewe vp and increaſed the reporte off our diſagrements and ſtriffes. Neither woulde they from that time forwarde vnleſſe they were commaunded by the magiſtrate come to the churche when as notwithſtandinge they coulde not ſhewe vs anie iuſte cauſe to be giuen them why they ſhulde ſo departe from the churche and refraine the publicke prayers and godly ſermons / as yff we had byn Ethnickes or publicannes.
            The 25. daie oure diſcipline was read the 3. time / and the 26. daie it was read the forthe tyme by the commaundement off the Magiſtrate at the reading wheroff all Engliſhe men that were off the churche were commaunded to be preſent. The 30. off marche it was read the fyfte tyme and ſo at diuers times there ſubſcribed 42. in the good allowance theroff whiche was the greater parte by a greate deale off the churche. For the whole churche at that preſent had not aboue: 62. And bycauſe nowe the marte was at hande / that there might be ſome better forme off a well ordred churche: fiue were appointed

off the churche the 20. off marche to nominate certeine from amonge whom / accordinge to the Magiſtrates decree ſhulde be choſen / the Miniſters off the worde / Seniors and Deacons.

               . off Marche after dmner it began to be muttred off certeyne that the Magiſtrate had forbydden that we ſhulde go forwarde in the election / the whiche thinge ſurely greued vs: for by that meanes we ſawe that we ſhulde haue no forme of a Churche before the marte and that therfore we ſhulde become a reproche to all men / which ſeemed

ſhulde be ſpred amonge all nations. But this rumor was altogether vaine / for the 29. of marche which was the daie before the election ſhulde be / after the ſermon / the decree of the Magiſtrate was openly reade in the churche / wherin it was commaunded that we ſhulde take in hand and performe the election off the Miniſters in the ſame order and vpon the ſame daie that we had apointed / and that all Engliſhe men that were off oure churche ſhulde be preſent the ſame daie / at the election / and geue their voices.
            The 29. daie off Marche after praiers / the ſermon and publique faſte / a litle before twelue / the election off the Miniſters began to be made and when we were in the middeſte off the election▪ Maiſter Horne Maiſter Chambers / and others to the nomber off 18. men / (who before were neither with vs at the ſermon / nor at praiers / but had kepte themſelues in ſome howſes not farre from the churche / beinge warned of their ſide that had watched vs in the churche) came in ſuddanlie on a troupe together in to the churche and there eche one ſtriuethe who ſhall caſte in his bill firſte / vpon the table ſtandinge in the middeſte off the churche / all whiche bylles conteined one matter and writen almoſt with like wordes / to witt / that they coulde not geue their voices in the ſame election / bicauſe they coulde not off their conſciences alowe that diſcipline by whiche the election was made. And that they might enlarge their nomber / they brought with them 2. billes off thoſe that were abſent and off ſome others whiche neuer were accompted off the churche. And ſo after they had troubled oure election / and after Maiſter Horne alſo / walking with an other a litle while ouerwhart in the middeſt off the churche / all in a manner departed againe.
            Afterwards the election was fully ended / at one off the clock at afternoone / there were choſen 2. Miniſters off the worde .6. Seniors and 4. Deacons. Nowe the Deacons were (beſides the wonted cuſtome off oure churche) off the nomber off thoſe that coulde lyue of their owne / for that the common treaſure might ſeeme withowte all ſuſpition to be committed

to ſuche rather then to the poorer ſorte▪ Nowe / in that maiſter Horne neither anie off the other that were before in the Miniſterie (excepte onely maiſter Willforde) were choſen againe to the Miniſterie / was ſpecially through their owne faulte. For Maiſter Horne neuer almoſte ceaſed for certeine daies to profeſſe openly that he woulde neuer exerciſe againe anie Eccleſiaſticall miniſterie in that churche / and beinge before appointed by the magiſtrate to preache in oure churche he would neuer ſo muche as once preach. And maiſter Chambers / when his name amonge the reſte to be choſen / was propounded / the 25. off marche he profeſſed openly in the churche / (all men hearinge it) before the election / that though he were choſen off vs to ſome Miniſterie / yet that he woulde neuer vſe it: And therfore that we ſhulde not in anie caſe chuſe him vnleſſe we woulde haue oure election to be fruſtrate.
            Wherfore / it is no maruell / yff they were not choſen / who / leaſt they ſhulde be choſen did them ſelues openly denounce it. And therfore / in this they do vs great wronge / that would ſeeme to beare men in hande / that they were at the firſte thruſte owte off their miniſterie by vs / or longe off vs they were not choſen in againe.
            Maiſter Iſaac in like manner / Maiſter Binks Maiſter Brickbek and Maiſter Eſcote openly profeſſed that they woulde in nowiſe vſe any publique miniſterie in oure churche. And here vpon it came ſpecially to paſſe that onely Maiſter willford / (who had not made anie ſuche exception) was from amonge thē / which were before in the miniſtery choſen agayne.
            The thirde off Aprill the Magiſtrate / who deſired that theis churche diſſentions off oures might be pacified and quietted / and he now bicauſe off the marte had no leaſure to do the ſame / writeth his letters to D. Cox / D: Sandes and maiſter Bartue in whiche he exhorteh them / that they / yff they coulde by anie conueniente meanes / as arbitres off ſome eſtimation ende this ſtriffe amonge vs.
            Nowe when either ſide was come before them and all we in the name off the churche (for all had graunted oure controuerſies

to be harde and determined with owte anye exception at all to them and to other arbytres / what ſo euer / whom they ſhulde call vnto them) and had offred this thinge to the arbytres written and all oure names ſubſcribed vnto it: Maiſter Horne / Maiſter Chambers and others firſte requeſted that maiſter Horne might be reſtored to his office off paſtorſhippe / Maiſter Iſaac Maiſter Chambers and others / into their offices off Seniors and the olde diſcipline into his former place and autoritie / ſo as they were in the beginninge off theis controuerſies. For then (ſaid they) will we leaue all controuerſies to the arbitres. When we had refuſed this as moſte vniuſte and vnreaſonable / then they requeſted that ſeinge we woulde not reſtore the olde diſcipline / and them to their former authoritie / that then we would ſuffer oure diſcipline and Myniſters to be none otherwiſe then their olde withowte all authoritie and no miniſter at all nor diſcipline to be in oure churche but that the matter ſhulde remaine in that ſtate and condition that it was in the laſt off February / when the Magiſtrate hauinge put all the miniſters from their offices departed frō vs / and ſo ſhuld the mater be lefte to arbitres
            Whan we remembred what and howe great trauelles that diſcipline election off Miniſters had coſte vs and ſawe that by this meanes oure churche ſhulde be made deſtitute off Miniſters and a large windowe to be opened for newe contentions / and had alſo denied that thinge / Maiſter Horne requeſted that it might be lawfull for him to goo a litle a ſide and to conſulte with ſome off his ſide abowte the whole matter. A litle after returninge againe and ſainge / that they woulde leaue no waie vnſought after / wherby peace might be gotton / although they yelded muche from their right. Then he readeth a certeine bill to thoſe 3.

            Thow maiſte ſe here / gentle reader / that albeit we had oure Diſcipline writen and allowed off a 11. off the 15. men whom the congregation by the Magiſtrates authoritie had apointed / to wit / the Dyſcipline / and therupon confirmed with the hands off 42. men which was the greateſte parte off our churche by a great deale: Albeit we had alſo / all eccleaſticall miniſters / by the magiſtrats decree / and the authoritie of the congregation

lawfully elected / yet for quietnes ſake / we put all to the Arbitres wholie / either to be allowed or diſalowed with owte anie manner off exception. But maiſter Horne and maiſter Chambers / and others / ſekinge more their owne will then anie quiete agremente / woulde not at the firſt admit thoſe three Arbitres appointed off the magiſtrates. For Maiſter Horne made exception againſte ſome off them. And afterwardes woulde abide no order or offre / vnleſſe we wolde with oure ſubſcriptions ſuffer and commit oure diſcipline / the election off miniſters / and all other matters off oure churche to ſtande in ſuſpence (as they call it) ſo that by their dryfte we ſhulde haue had no diſcipline / no certein miniſtery / no order and ſo conſequently no churche They would that thies Arbiters ſhulde be choſen indifferenly from amonge ſuche as were oure countrie men / But not of oure congregation / ſo that it ſhulde be lawfull for them to chuſe where they lyſte and whom they liſte.
                  Theis three arbytres had their beinge owte from the Engliſhe churches.
                Nowe conſider with me / who ſo euer thow arte (indiffent reader) yff we / firſte hauinge geuen and ſealed oure writinge in the name off the whole churche had granted our diſcipline / miniſters / and all other orders off oure churche to ſtande in ſuſpence / vntill they ſhulde either be allowed or diſalowed of the arbitres choſen in ſuche ſorte / and till maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers accordinge to their canuaſinge craftines / nowe ynough and more then ynough knowen vnto vs / had choſen Arbitres for their parte owte off farr places / who either coulde not or ells woulde not meete together abowte this matter / or (whiche was moſte certeine to come to paſſe) yff Maiſter Horne / and Maiſter Chambers wherſoeuer at lenght they had chooſen arbitres / had not for all that choſen ſuche for their ſide / who vnleſſe thinges vvere don accordinge to their ovvne minde / vvould decree nothinge at all. But the Arbitres diſagreinge on bothe ſides / the matter ſhulde be lefte vndon; vvhat then ſhulde haue become off oure churche / vvith thies their ſuſpenſyue miniſters / and vvitherhe diſcipline and all other thinges? For the condition offred vpp off Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers vvas declared

to be this / that ſo longe all ſhulde remaine in ſuſpence till they ſhuld be allowed or diſalowed by the arbytres: ſo that yff the arbyters ſhulde haue bin deuided equally (as many times it comethe to paſſe) the Miniſters off the churche might determine nothinge / but the Diſcipline and all other thinges muſte continually hange in ſuſpence. Againe / the churche (thoughe it were in great perill and daunger / yet / leaſt it ſhulde leaue anye waye vnproued for the obtayninge off peace (bicauſe they thought that ſome off thoſe three were not meete whom the magiſtrates had appointed for Arbitres / offred vpp an other bill conteining alltogether the ſelff ſame matter / and write withe the ſame wordes / that they woulde ſtande to the Iudgement off any other Arbitres who ſo euer beinge choſen indifferently by the other partie from amonge oure countrie men / and leaue all thinges to them plainely and ſymplie withowte anie exception or condition to be determined and decided. But they would allowe no condition offred off vs vnleſſe we woulde firſte / by the ſubſcribinge off oure names allowe that moſte vniuſte and vnreaſonable condition off thers / and by oure preiudice condemne oure Myniſters / oure Diſcipline and all other thinges that we had donne. And ſo by this meanes had opened a gapp to them to ouerthowe oure churche. And when they had thus behaued them ſelues before Maiſter Bartue D. Cox and D. Sandes / yet certeine off them (when nowe the marte was in the chieff flowre) reported through owte the whole cytie that we had reiected their moſt iuſte and paeceable requeſtes and that we were alltogether troubleſome men / and plainely bent to ſuffer no peace nor quietnes / howbeit / we had rather that they ſhuld ſhewe theis thinges that are falſe off vs to others / then that they together with others ſhulde openly deride oure follie (yff we had yelded to ſuch requeſts) as they that with oure great 
                  •
               oile and trauell had (to the quiete off the churche) eſtablyſhed ſome churche / and nowe vppon a ſuddaine by the ſubſcribinge off one bill thorough headineſſe and fooliſhe facilitie ſhulde haue ouerthrowen the whole. But they / when they

coulde not obtaine this / went abowte this verie buſelie / that the whole churche might then be diſſolued and broken vpp. For Maiſter Chambers for halff a monethe ſpace and more would geue nothinge to anie man that remained in the churche / and folowed not maiſter Horne and him departinge from the churche.
            To certeine other alſo he woulde geue nothinge at all whiche were in the publique Miniſterie / to preache the word and reade lectures / and alſo in the exerciſe of diſputinge by his owne appoyntemente and the order taken by Maiſter Horne alwais from the time ſithens they came to oure churche / when nowe they were for their bourde in debte to their hoſteſſes for 4. monethes / neither had don anie other faulte / vnleſſe it were bicauſe they remained in their functions off preachinge and readinge lectures in whiche they were placed by Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers / leaſte the churche ſhuld altogether be deſtitute bothe off ſermons and lectures: Onely bicauſe in this diſſention they agreed not with them and tooke their partes / and had with them withdrawen them ſelues from the churche that it might be vtterlie ſcattered / whē as notwithſtandinge (which is moſte vnhoneſt) they had promiſed to geue 3. monethes warninge before they woulde forſake them: whiche / notwithſtandinge Maiſter Chambers affirmed they woulde neuer do vnleſſe it were that they were conſtained by extreame neceſſitie. Abowte the middeſt off the marte or a litle after ther began̄e a rumor to be ſpread off the departure of maiſter Horne and maiſter Chambers from this citie / but whither they woulde go / or whither they woulde at all departe / it was yet vncerteine. For neither was it likely that maiſter Chambers hauinge gathered ſo muche common mony / and that by the authoritie and in the name off the churche ſeinge he had bin here ſo longe with owte makinge off anie accoumpte to the churche / woulde go awaie in ſuche ſor

departe / yea / not ſo muche as haue taken his leaue of the churche. In the meane time it is incredible to be ſpoken / but more ſhameful to be hearde / what reportes certeine had ſpred that marte tyme ſecretly and eſpecially amonge the rycher ſorte that were able to helpe the poore off oure churche / forſoothe / that there were certeine traitors amonge vs. That we deſired to knowe the names off thoſe perſons that were liberall towardes the poore off oure churche / to the ende to betraie them and vndoo them: That we had caſte our Paſtor and Miniſters owte headlonge from ther miniſteries and offices. In all whiche thinges / they went aboute nothinge ells but to ſtirre vp newe braules and contentions. And that they maie alienate the hartes off the welthie ſorte from vs / and ſo bringe the poore of oure churche / firſt to famine and then vs into deadly hatred off them / as thoughe they were by vs throwen in to theis miſeries / But foras muche as all theis thinges are vaine and vntrue / and fained by the ſecret ſleightes off thoſe priuie whiſperers / who dare ſpeake nothinge openly: we haue thought them rather to be contemned thē to be anſwered: hopinge that at laſte when they are weary off lyinge / they will be quiet.

And alſo to haue an honeſt teſtimony off towardnes in godly conuerſation / and that euery member off the churche do not refuſe to reade a declaration off their faithe before the paſtor and Elders when ſo euer they ſhall be therto required
                     
                     
                        Thorder off correction / for priuate and priuie offences.
                        Fourthly / for as muche as no charge is ſo perfect but offences maye ariſe / for godly charitable redreſſinge and reforminge off ſuche / this order is to be obſerued.

                        Off the order off correction for publick and open crimes.
                        But yff anie perſon ſhalbe a notorious knowen offender ſo as he is offenſiue to the whole churche / then ſhall the paſtor and elders immediatlye call the offender before them and trauel with him to reduce him to true repētance and ſatisfyinge off the congregation whiche / if

                     The 2. parte off diſcipline toncerninge the miniſters and elders / and their elections.
                     Firſte for the election of miniſters and Elders / the qualities of the ſame are to be examined and conſidered according to the rule off S. Paule 1. Tim. 3. Wheroff this is the ſumme That no man be elected whoſe doctrine or liffe can iuſtlie be reproued and condemned. As concerning the order and forme off Electing / the ſame is to be obſerued whiche hathe already bin practiſed and is here vnto anexed.
                     
                        
                        Off ther offices and functions.
                        The paſtor / according to the commaundement off the holye ghoſte in the ſcriptures / ought with all paſtorall care diligently to attende to his flock / in preaching goddes worde / in miniſtring the Sacramentes / in example off Good lyffe / in exhortinge / admoniſhinge / rebukinge / and as the chieff mouthe off the churche / to open and declare all orders taken by him and the elders whiche are to be opened and publiſhed: to whom no man maye in the face off the congregation replye. But yff anie think himſelff to haue cauſe to ſpeak let him come before the elders in the place appointed for their meetinge and thereto open his mynde and to be hard with all charitie indifferently.
                     
                     
                        The office off preachers and ſuche as are lerned in the congregation.
                        The office off preachers and ſuch as are lerned in the churche is to aſſiſte the paſtor in preachinge the worde / miniſtringe the Sacraments and in all conſultations and meetinges off him and the Elders eſpecially in cauſes off Doctrine / and alſo at other tymes when they ſhall be required.
                     
                     
                        The office off Elders.
                        The office off Elders is to be (as it were) cenſors / ouerſeers off manners and diſorders. And to be with the paſtor in all conſultations / for the publick order off the churche / and that all corrections and exerciſes off diſcipline be done with their common conſaile.
                     
                     
                        Deacons.
                        Conſideringe alſo the preſent ſtate off the churche / it is thaught requiſite that the Deacons beſides the ſpeciall office appointed in the Acts off the Apoſtells in caringe and providinge

for the poore / do alſo viſit the ſick and be aſſiſtant in Catechiſinge the youthe yff they ſhall be thervnto required.
                        The ſame order and forme is to be vſed for reformation off offences and crymes in miniſters and Elders whiche is deſcribed for other offenders / and to be donne towardes them rather with more ſeueritie.
                     
                  
               
               
                  Now folowith the Diſcipline reformed and confirmed by the authoritie off the churche and magiſtrate.
                  IT is moſte cumlie and godly / that Chriſtian people reſorte  together in place and tyme / 
                        The new diſcipline.
                      therunto by common conſent appointed (yff the perſecution off the vngodly will ſuffer the ſame and they themſelues haue no vrgent cauſe to the contrary) there to heare the pure doctrine off Gods worde taught / and them ſelues openly with their preſence and voice to declare the conſent off their hartes to the ſame / and to confeſſe with their mouthe agreablely their belieff and faith vpon god and his holy worde according to the ſcriptures.
                  The congregation thus aſſembled is a particuler viſible churche ſuch as maye be in diuers places off the worlde verye  manye. And all theis particuler churches ioyned together not in place (for that is not poſſible) but by the coniunction off true doctrine and faithe in the ſame / do make one whole churche in this worlde. And the electe off God that be in this whole churche and euery parte theroff with all the elect that hath byn from the beginninge off the worlde and ſhall be to the ende theroff doo altogether make that holy catholike and Apoſtolike churche / the ſpouſe off oure ſauiour chriſte wchiche he hathe purified to him ſelff in his blood wheroff mention is made in the creede. I beleue one holie Catholike and Apoſtolike churche. But at this preſent oure conſideration muſte be off the viſible and particuler churche.
                  
                     The ſignes and notes off a viſible churche are thies. Firſte / true and goldly doctrine. Secondly / the right miniſtration and vſe off the Sacramentes and common praier: Thirdly: honeſt and godly liffe / yff not in the whole multitude / yet in manie off them: fourthly / diſcipline / that is / the correction off vices / but the 2. firſte notes are ſuche as withowt the whiche no forme off anie godly viſible churche can poſſibly be. Wherfore / they be the principall and chieff notes. And therfore we define a particuler churche viſible / to be the congregation off Chriſten men whither they be fewe or many aſſemblinge together in place and time conuenient to heare Chriſtes true Doctrine taught / to vſe his holy Sacramentes rightly and to make their common praier together / in the whiche their appearethe a ſtudie off honeſt ād godlye liffe / and which hathe in it a godly diſcipline / that is to ſaye / ordinaunces and decrees Eccleſiaſticall for the preſeruation off comely order and for the correction off vices.
                  
                     Off the doctrine off the churche which is the firſt note.
                     The Doctrine whiche we holde and profeſſe in oure  church is the ſame that is taught in the canonicall bookes off the holie bible / conteininge the olde teſtamente and the newe in the whiche is conteined the true and liuelie worde off god and the doctrine off helthe bothe as concerninge faithe and godly liffe / at full / ſufficient for the ſaluation off all the faithfull that vnfainedly beleue therin The ſumme off the whiche as concerninge faithe is briefly and truly comprehended in the 3. creeds / the common creede commonly called the creed off the Apoſtells / the Nicene creed and the crede off Athanaſius: And as concerninge godly liffe / in the ten commaundementes / written in the xx chapter off Exodus.
                  
                  
                     Off the Sacramentes / and common praier the ſecond note.
                     
                        We obſerue ad kepe the forme and order off the miniſtraon off the ſacramentes and common praier / as it is ſet foorh  by the authoritie off the bleſſed kinge Edwarde off famous memorye / in the laſte booke off the Engliſh ſeruice: Wheroff notwithſtanding in the reſpecte off tymes and places and other circumſtances certeine rites and ceremonies appointed in the ſayed booke / as thinges in different / maie be left owte / / as we at this preſent doo.

                     Off the Miniſters off the worde / Sacra / ments and common praier.
                     It is thought expedient for the churche at this preſent /  to haue 2. Miniſters or teachers off the worde elected / off dotrine and godly liffe / ſuch as the rule off the ſcripture dothe requyre as muche as maie be / And that the ſayde 2. Miniſters and teachers off the worde ſhall in all things and points be off like authorite and neither off them ſuperior or inferior to other.

Miniſters ſhall by themſelues / or fit perſons by them and the Seniors in the name off the  whole congregation to be appointed / when neceſſarie cauſe ſhall ſo requyre / preach the ordinarie Sermons on wenſdaies / thurſdayes and ſondaies before noone / and after noone inſtruct and Heare the examination off the youthe in the Catechiſme / on ſondaye in the after noone at the howre accuſtomed / and ſhall by them ſelues or other appointed perſons as is afore ſayed Miniſter the Sacramentes dewly / ſaye the common prayers diſtinctly viſet and comfort the ſick ſpecially at their laſt tyme and howre off deathe / bury the dead comely / and obſerue all other comely rites and vges

                         Item we think good that certeine letters in the ſame ſence be written with an exhortation and hartie praier to all ſuch as will relieue the poore off oure congregation with their godly liberalitie / that they will deliuer or ſend their charitable reliffe to the ſaied 4. Deacons / commonly to be beſtowed off

them vpoon all the poore / whither they be ſtudentes or other according to euerie mans neceſſitie: whiche the ſaied Deacons and the churche here preſent can beſt knowe and Iudge / rather then to committ the allmes to anie one perſons hande / to anye priuate vſe / for the auoyding off ſundry ſuſpitions / and many other inconueniences / that maye bothe preſently and here after ariſe and enſewe off the ſame: And the ſayed letters ſubſcribed with as many handes off the congregation as ſhall ſeme good / with a general ſuperſcription to all ſuch as will charitably relieue the poore off oure congregation with owt anye naminge off any perſons / to be ſent where the Miniſters Seniors and Deacons / or the more off them ſhall think good by a moſt faithfull and diſcreet meſſinger / to all places where ſuch good men / by whoſe liberalitie the churche is releived / doe or maie reſorte / that the ſayed letters maye by the ſayed meſſinger be ſhewed as a teſtimonie off credit to the ſaid godly men in places and at tymes moſte conuenient.
                  
                  
                     This article folowing 29. I alſo fynde in the Copie.
                     Item / as concerning the relieffe to be had at ſtrangers  handes / who be not off oure churche: ſuch order is to be taken as ſhall ſeme moſt expediēt to the miniſters of the worde and Sacraments. It ſemeth that this article was put in / in place off the former whiche they could not agree vppon.
                     Item we thinke it expedient that the ſaied 4. Deacons  be charged neither with the helping off the Miniſters in the preaching off the worde neither in the Catechiſing off the youthe / neither in miniſtring off Sacramentes / or ſaing off common praier: or ſpecially the viſiting off the ſick / other then the poore for the releyuing of their neceſſitie / as with thinges perteininge to the office off deaconſhipp nor with any other offices other thē is expreſſedly declared in gods worde apperteine to the Deacons: according to the rule off the whiche / 

they ſhall by all meanes poſſible direct their dooinges: The ſumme wheroff is / diligently to receiue and kepe all / and all manner off publik and priuate almes / and the ſame faithfully to beſtowe vpon the poore off chriſtes churche accordinge as euery mannes neceſſitie ſhall requier; and by all meanes poſſible / as well by worde as by writing / to procure the maintenaunce off the ſaied treaſure off the churche / ſo to their credit committed. Notwithſtandinge / it is not ment hereby / but that anie off the ſayed Deacons / being lerned / when good occaſion ſhall therto ſerue / may preach or inſtruct the youthe in the Catechiſme / or doe anie other godly function wherunto they ſhall be called.
                     
                         Item / that where there is no godlier acte then to ſuccor ſuch as be bothe ſik and poore for that their burthen is moſte heauy / we think good / yff the habilitie off the churche will extend therunto that there be 4. graue and honeſt wemen either widowes or wyues (ſuch as haue nede of the helpe of the churche) appointed and choſen with the conſente off their huſbandes / to keepe the poore / when they be ſicke / and to watche with them by courſe one after an other: and that they haue therfore cut off the treaſure off the churche a certeine ſtipende quarterly payde vnto them.

                         Item / in all controuerſies ciuill / the ciuill or municipall law off the countrie or citie where the churche is / is a ſufficient rule to be obaied.
                     Item / all matters touchinge the congregation / or the  members off the ſame directly apperteining to neither off the two former partes / Eccleſiaſticall ordinance and diſcipline of

the ſaied churche / ought by all members off the ſame to be obaied.

                  Item / like as good reaſon off it ſelff forceth and concludeth:  ſo all good autors bothe newe and olde doo freely teache that for conſeruation off vnitie and concorde and for auoidinge off ſchiſmes and diſcorde / it is requiſite and neceſſarie that a prerogatiue and preheminence for cure / charge / and gouernemente be committed and geuen to ſome one / to be (as it is afore ſaide) charged aboue others.

To the 5. we knowe that Ierome expreſly declarethe that in the beginninge the churche was ruled equally by manie. But after when ſchiſmes began to ſpringe the chiefe authoritie was geuen to one for authorities ſake / and by mannes ordinaunce rather then by deuine authoritie / wherfore we cōclude that as for ſchiſmes the firſte order of many was left ād one chiefe apointed: So nowe for the auoidinge of tyrānie a worſe euell in the churche then ſchiſmes / whiche / as apearethe by the Biſhop of Rome is grownded vppon one / we thinke it good to returne to the firſte order off two or moo equall miniſters accordinge to the inſtitution off the Apoſtells as Saint Ierome teacheth. And that thoſe lerned men who do moſte earneſtly maintaine the gouernment off one / confeſſe that vntill the tyme off Dionyſius / who was after Chriſte 300. yeres and more / the Regimente was equally committed to manye. And as for the newe / there be examples off the beſte churche to the contrary. And Maiſter Caluin in the 8. Chap. off his Inſtitutions the 42. and 52. dyuiſions Declarethe expreſly that there were From the beginninge more Miniſters off the worde and that it is but off mannes ordinaunce that one was afterwarde made chieff.
               That is alleadged off the reformed churches in Germany the multitude ought to ſerue no more for one / then the beſt reformed churches / for two miniſters off the worde.
               As concerninge Nicene councell it is before anſwered / To the 6. and in that they decreed there ſhulde be but one / it conſequenquently folowithe that before the ſaide decree there were many.
               And iff thoſe godly fathers were nowe lyuinge and did ſe how Antechriſte is eſtabliſhed vppon one / they woulde more gladly returne to the firſte order off many equall for the auoidinge off that moſte horrible miſchieff. As they then did for the auoidinge off Schiſmes appointe euery citie one.
               
                  Negligence is no more in two then one. habilitie off welldoinge thinges is more in two then in one.
                     To the 7. Yea, but though he did ſo then he will not doo ſo nowe I warrant yow.
                   And ſikneſſe beinge ſo riffe in this citye / it is as muche as 2. can well doo / and one maie be ſicke. And one maie wil fully and ſuddenly leaue his flocke
               Wherfore / two be neceſſary / ells / in the ſuddaine ſicknes off one onelie Miniſter / when manie other be ſike alſo / dewe viſitation off the ſike is not well ſeene to and preachinge omitted / as it hathe chaūced in oure churche / yea / and although we haue many. And therfore reaſon tellethe vs that it is expedient to haue two rather then one.

               Item / where it is prouided that the Miniſters ſhall by themſelues or their deputies diſharge the ſermons and other their dueties when neceſſarie caſe ſhall ſo requyre: we ſaye it is ſuperfluous. for a neceſſarie cauſe nedethe not to be prouided for by lawe: beſides that the alowinge off deputies by lawe made for that purpoſe openethe a windowe off negligence to the miniſters in the executinge off their office.

Wherfore / we think that poſition / that neceſſarie cauſes nede not to be prouided for by a lawe / ought to be taken for no lawe: and where it is alleadged that it openethe a windowe off negligence to the Miniſters / it is not ſo / for the appointemente off thoſe deputies apperteinethe more to the Seniors them to the Miniſters by oure diſcipline.

Catechiſmes in one after noone And alſo think that Maiſter Caluins Catechiſme ought to be vſed no otherwiſe with vs then it is in Caluins churche that alloweth and vſeth the ſame.

               The firſt Catechiſme is onely ordred for the children and is but an examination and appoſinge off them. The other is not onely for children but for all the congregation / &c.
               Now / for ſo muche as the reaſons and anſwers are verye long and yet ſome off them repeated / in Maiſter Hornes obiections to the diſcipline whiche he offred vpp to the Magiſtrate / I will here paſſe them ouer and come to the ſaied obiections / and the anſwers off the church to the ſame.
            
            
               Horne and the reſt off his ſide to the Magiſtrate.
               WE come to that nowe (right honorable S.) whiche we were charged to doo by your commaundment and appointement: that for as much as for the apeaſinge and finall puttinge awaie off the contention betweene vs and oure brethern / we ſhulde ſhewe why we diſſente from them / and cannot proceade in the ſame paſſage and waye that they doo: We ſhall ſo open vnto yow oure defence and cauſe euen as we deſier to be iuſtified bothe in oure cōſciences and before god. Howbeit / we are verye ſory that your H. Hathe lym
                     •
                  ted vs ſo ſhorte tyme / ſo as in a cauſe whiche (for the waightines ād difficultie off it) ought to be debated vppon with more leaſure / and verie manye thinges to be wayed to and fro / we muſte off force in a manner holde oure peace and ſay nothing.
               But oure truſte is that your. H. will heareafter / remedy this diſpleaſure / in grauntinge vs longer tyme that we maye more amplie hereafter confirme oure cauſe / whiche we are

forced to ſet foorthe naked and with owte anie defence at all whiche we will moſte gladly doo and deſier that we maie freely be permitted to doo. This is the thinge that we often ſought for when we conſulted amonge oure brethern for the correctinge and amendinge off oure diſcipline / that / as longe as the matter and cauſe was in conſultation / we might ſo longe poliſhe and finiſhe more at large that was alleadged / to adde vnto all oure ſentences / before the ſentences brought in / and to ſtrike owte and take awaie from them yff ought ſemed worthie to be taken awaie / albeit any thinge were put in / as firme and eſtabliſhed by oure ſubſcription: Whiche thinge we nowe eftſonnes deſier moſte earneſtly at your H. Handes. that for as muche as nothinge is yet concluded and determined by your H. there be no ſuch preiudice obiected vnto oure cauſe / but that we maye confirme all oure allegations with firme and available argumentes.
               And in deede / ſeinge we muſte nowe intreate in order off thoſe thinges whiche we reprehende and condemne in oure bretherns made Diſcipline: This we firſt reprehend vniuerſally / that any other alteration or innouation off thinges ſhuld be in oure affaiers then ſuche as ſerue onely to the correctinge and amendinge off that Diſcipline whiche hathe byn heretofore receaued and vſed in oure churche. Wherin / we will ſeeme alſo ſomewhat to ſatiſfie oure bretherns curious mindes. This we ſaie / bicauſe there is almoſte nothinge that we think is to be innouated with ſuche poſte haſte and in dede / there are many and waightie cauſes whiche do alltogether pull vs backe from theis innouations / and byd vs ſtick ſtill to oure olde diſcipline / and not for the pleaſure off ſome men / and contrary alſo to your commaundement (geuen for the amendinge and not for the makinge off any newe Diſcipline) to contemne and caſte away that whiche ſo many haue alowed.
            
            
               Whithead and the reſt off that ſide anwere in this wiſe.
               
                  We had purpoſed (right honorable ad righteous Magiſtrates) as we alſo ſignified vnto your honours) to haue made no anſwere at all vnto theis vnbrotherly reproches off Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers (for they are the onely Authors theroff) in as muche as they be vnworthy to be anſwered vnto / ſeinge they haue no ſure grownds / but ba

                  e aſſertions onely / whiche are as eaſilie denied as affirmed. And beſides that Maiſter Horne ſaide openly in the hearinge off all his complyces / before Maiſter Bartue D. Cox and D. Sandes / arbytres appointed by your authoritie / that he was not deſyrous that we ſhulde anſwere / wherin indede / he was not altogether a foole. For he knewe well ynough howe fond geare he had written / and would beare awaie this bragg the while / not as though we woulde not / but coulde not anſwere ſo light accuſations. Whiche petit bragg (Wherin he ſo muche deliteth) we woulde haue byn content to haue ſpared him / had not your authoritie (who thought it meete for vs in anie wiſe to make anſwere) come betweene: And in caſe Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers ſhall reade ſome thinges here in oure anſwere that they woulde not / let them remember that they haue driuen vs to it / in that they haue bluſtred owte in wrytinge ſo vnworthie matters (and that ſo falſely) off ſuche a multitude off their baniſhed countrie men. for they (Forgettinge all humanitie and Good manner) / obiecte before the Magiſtrate (and that often) prouertie to a great manye off oures nowe in exile as a moſt highe reproche. What then? Are they baniſhed and poore willingly or parforce? Were they not and might they not (yff they ſet more by goodes then godlyneſſe / be richer? And whens haue they this pouertie whiche ye Maiſter Horne and maiſter Chābers caſte ſo tauntingly in their teeth? And whence haue ye this plentye wherby ye looke ſo high againſte your brethern? Surely yow ought to haue aduiſed your ſelff / ſeinge ye carry the common purſe / before ye had ſo raſhly and ſo vndiſcreetly publiſhed theis words vnto the right honorable Magiſtrate / with the reproche off your ſelff and off your countrie

men. In dede we woulde haue ſuffred theis (as common reproches) to be buried in perpetuall ſilence iff it ſemed not otherwiſe meete to the right honorable magiſtrate / (whoſe authoritie we obeyinge as yf becomethe vs) ſhall anſwere particulerly vnto all the particuler chapters off your aſſertions.

What ſhulde be determined in anie affaires / yff the matter ſhuld tarie / till alltogether (not one except) ſhulde agree throughly in all pointes? Where they ſaie the booke was collected before this matter was committed to the 15. men is it a plaine ſlaunder. Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers might be iuſtly aſhamed to caſt pouertie in oure bretherns teeth nowe in exile (and that before the Magiſtrate) and to lye ſo openly / that 24. off oure company that ſubſcribed lyue off other mennes almes. And yff ſo manye poore men haue forſaken Maiſter purſe bearer Chambers is it not a plaine matter that they haue byn euell intreated at Chambers hande before tyme? But where they gather that the poore men ſeeme to haue folowed other mennes myndes in ſubſcribinge to the Diſcipline / rather then their owne: it is fondly gathered: in aſmuche as on the contrary parte it is moſte true that they whiche (were they poore men) folowid not Chambers when he ranne a Waye with the bagge / regarded their conſcience more then the lyuinge forſomuche as bothe they and all other might be certeinly aſſured that they ſhulde moſte greuouſly offend not onely the purſe bearer Chambers but allſo two or there other off the richer ſorte off oure congregation. But howe muche more iuſtly might we returne this accuſatiō (which they falſely bend againſte oures) vpon M. Horne and M. Chamb. and manye other off their nomber whiche haue folowed Chamb. in runninge awaye from the congregation / bycauſe he caried and ſhewed them a well ſtuffed powche / as it were a ſtandard to followe▪ for neither Maiſter Chambers nor Maiſter Horne durſt euer haue departed from the congregation as they haue done but vppon truſte off the powche / which

the one hathe allwayes borne / and the other hath byn euer an vnſeparable waiter vppon / where ſo euer it were caried: and and yet in the meane while / this gaye fellowe Horne / from alofte contemneth ſo great a company off his countrie men / as beggers and caitiues in compariſon off himſelff.
               But in caſe there be ſo many amonge vs that liue off other mennes almes / as Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers do reaſon. And ſeinge Maiſter Chambers tooke vppon him eſpecially at the intreaty off Maiſter Horne / the charge off gathering godlye mens almes publickely in the name of the churche / for the relieff the off poore off oure congregation as it is already knowen vnto many and ſhall hereafter by the whole matter ſeuerally ſetforth / be moſte euidently knowen to moo: what mercie and pitye is this off thers towardes their brethern to leaue ſo many miſerable people behinde them / contrary to their promeſſe made to the congregation / and to runne awaie not onely from the congregation / but alſo owte off the cytye ſnappinge awaie the bagge with them (whiche conteinethe many mennes almes gathered for the poore in the name off the congregation / and to leaue them all deſtitute / and alſo to leaue certeine preachers appointed by them (whiche haue ſerued the churche a yere and moore / and to whom they promiſed that they ſhulde lack nothing) in a great deale off de

               But admit there be one or two amonge them off the poorer ſorte that ſhall perhapps haue nede now and then off ſome relieff off the churche monie. Do not yow (Horne and Chambers) knowe that they haue byn richer in tymes paſte / and excepte they preferred Religion to riches) maye be richer when they will? And nowe as they are become willingly baniſhed men / ſo are they willinglye poore men for the ſame Religions ſake that ye will ſeeme to profeſſe? Wherfore then had ye rather enuiouſly to reprehend pouertie in ſuche a one then gentlie to cōmend ſo great a vertue / but that ye are driuen hereto by griefe of your ſtomakes through malice. What? Dothe Paule require welthe in Elders (as ye doo) or vertue? Go too / and ſhewe vs owte off Paule that this your purce welthe / is ſo neceſſary in an elder: We dare affirme that ſuche a one ſhulde haue byn off more authoritie with Paule as alſo with all men that be godly / and more worthie to be an elder by reaſon off his pouertie / for the whiche he is ſo contemned at your hande. But poore elders dare not (ye muſte vnderſtande) reproue offendinge Deacons: Do not yow Horne and Chambers knowe that in the primatiue churche / Biſhopps them ſelues / had their appointed liuinge owte off the treaſure off the churche / whiche was in the Deacons handes: and yet the Deacons (in caſe they did amiſſe) were neuer the leſſe ſharply corrected off them? And yet theis men that requier ſuch ruffling riche elders / woulde haue Deacons off the poorer ſorte. But by what example / and by what reaſon? why cannot ye beinge Chriſtians be content in exile aſwell with poore Elders as with poore Deacons? we remember that one off yow ſaied openly in our hearinge / and in the hearing of manie other that

yow coulde not with your conſcience be vnder ſuch miniſters and ſuch Seniors as oure church hathe nowe choſen. If ye can finde no other faulte in them then willfull pouertie / the congregation alſo can not repent them yet off the miniſters and Seniors whom they haue choſen: and as for this pure conſcience off yours we paſſe not for it. But we think / yff welthe be to reſpected in anie that is in Eccleſiaſticall Miniſtery it is to be be reſpected chieffly in Deacons / that they medle with the churche monie with owte ſiniſtre ſuſpition. In dede abowte 4. monethes paſte / ye had Deacons / ſurely honeſt men we ſaie not nay / but yet ſuche as for their ſlender abilitie ye made ſuch vnderlinges / that ye brought not onelie the honeſt Good men but alſo the miniſterie off Deacons (to the great iniurie off the apoſtells ordinaunce) into very muche contempte. And in caſe we haue thought Good to be ware (by all meanes) off that euill / ye ought not to haue byn greued at it / but rather to haue reioiſed in the churches behalff.

                     Horne.
                   that there be thre thinges / whiche they onely ſeeke / the innouation off miniſters / a purſe and treaſure / I wote not what / and the purginge off their owne offences before committed
               Nowe haue we alleadged as muche as we handſomely coulde bringe / conſideringe the tyme. We woulde alſo haue alleadged verie many other thinges / ſo as it ſhulde plainly appeare / that oure brethern haue in ordeininge their Diſcipline reſpected neither ſo great waightie reaſons / nor ſo great commodities off oure congregation But haue in the meane while geuen that / that ſhall be offenſiue and ſlanderous to all good men / and to oure aduerſaries and goddes enemies the papiſtes high reioycinge and pleaſure. The booke off the olde-diſcipline with a verie litle and ſmall correction and amending would cauſe manie more plentifull fruites off Chriſtian hartes to be brought foorth / and would ſettle a great deale more conſtant and more durable quietnes amonge vs.
            
            
               The anſwere to the concluſion.
               In all this adoo / Maiſter Horne and Maiſter Chambers go abowte nothinge ells but to diſquiete the cōgregation / 
                     VVhithead
                   that Horne might rule the roſte ouer all: Chambers beare the bagge alone / and they 2. together exerciſe a moſte vnworthie lordſhipp ouer the poore / and by them all other / and that they might haue no certeine diſcipline / but that their pleaſures might be holden for lawes / and that nothinge ſhulde be thought right or ſtād in force but what they doo / yet hithertoo / and the ſame they go abowte nowe: And it ſemethe they haue vtterly determined either to eſtabliſhe a tyrannie / or to leaue no common wealth at all in the congregation. Where Horne and Chambers make reherſall here off the purginge off offences comitted by vs / they ought iuſtly to haue byn aſhamed to make mention off offences ſeinge they haue neuer left for theis 3. or 4. Monethes to lade themſelues with wicked doinges

And as for occaſion of offence and ſlander geuen to good and godly men and to oure aduerſaries and goddes enemies the papiſtes high reioicinge and pleaſure / they accuſe vs theroff ſo falſely / as they themſelues haue geuen the occaſion in dede.
               For they coulde neuer abyde to haue anye thinge amended nor themſelues to be admoniſhed off any thinge / or to be cōmoned withall in anie wiſe. But for the moſte light / yea / no cauſes in dede / they forſooke their miniſterie ſtraight waies / the paſtor forſooke the flocke / the Treaſorer the poore and bothe forſooke the churche and moued others by their example to do the ſame.
               Neither was it ynough for them to geue ouer their owne functions but they muſt drawe other preachers and readers with them alſo / to the intent the congregation ſhulde by this meanes be deſtitute off Goddes worde / and vtterly ſcattered as thoughe it colde not poſſiblie ſtande withowte them. And when they had forſaken their owne churche / they haunted / partly the french churche and partly / the dewtche churches and ſo raiſed rumors abroade and ſpred oure diſſentions / firſte / though this citie and then thorough other cities off Germany. And laſt off all / when they wolde not come to the churche in the marte time / but by the Magiſtrates commaundement / neither coulde they then be quiet they ſpreed the like rumours almoſte throughowt all Europe.
               
                  
                     Then I hope, it may be now ſpred againe withowt offence, all thinges wel waied.
                  And when they haue plaied theis prancks themſelues / they charge vs with their owne faultes and go abowte to laie the infamie vppon vs whiche they themſelues haue ſtirred vp. Iff yow ſhall crie owte that olde matters are reherſed by this meanes / yow ought to haue abſtained from prouokinge vs hereunto: neither to haue mentioned offences committed / olde ſubſcriptions / ne yet to haue called vs vs backe thus to the olde diſcipline the fountaine off all contentions.

                   and that they could not by reaſen therof cal their cōſentinge brethern together to the ſubſcribinge: What meaneth that? For where they haue ſet to the names off them whiche dwell moſt farr aſunder and haue left owte almoſt none but the names off their owne ſeruants whom they haue allwaies at a becke / yet they could not call the reſt off their brethern together forſoothe / to the intent they might by this ſhift make a ſhewe to ſuche as knowe not the matter / off ſome multitude off men off ſome eſtimation whiche are leſte owte. And they deſier alſo as in a matter off waight that they maye ſet too the names off the others afterwardes. And as here in the ende / they vaunte a certeine ſhewe of ſome great multitude that will ſubſcribe: Euen ſo / in the beginninge and in many other places of their booke they make a great bragge as though they would exhibite ſome notable matter to the magiſtrate / ſo they maie haue time ynough geuen them to bethink themſelues. But maiſter Horne and maiſter Chambers ſhall with theis their mightie and great promiſſes bothe off ſubſcriptions declarations and confirmations bring

And iff it be poſſible that thei maie recouer a moſte intollerable lordeſhipp ouer the congregatiō or in caſe they cannot obtaine the chief ſtate in the cōgregatiō / that they may leaue the churche in

worſte / or in no ſtate at all / but that they maye rendē it and all to ſcatter it. Theis be the deuiſes off Horne and Chambers. Theis be therfetches / right honorable and moſt righteous Magiſtrates. And yet we haue no diſtruſte but almightie god for his mercies ſake towardes oure moſt afflicted churche / and that your authoritie for your equities ſake and ſinguler beneuolence towardes vs / will withſtande the ſame.
               And for as muche as we haue proued that one off theis thinges whiche they haue reprehended in oure diſcipline / be other againſt gods worde / or againſte good reaſon: and for as muche alſo as we are ready to proue / that all thinges conteined in oure Diſcipline / are taken owte either off Goodes worde or off the edicte off the Senate and Magiſtrate / either owte off their owne olde diſcipline which they ſtick ſo faſt vnto / either ells off the iudgement off good reaſon / we humblie beſeche the right honorable and righteous magiſtrates that they will vouchſaffe to confirme it with their authoritie.

                     To the miniſterie and bodie off the congregation off the Engliſhe Churche off Franckford.

Deſiring yow all as ye hope to haue fauour at goddes handes in the bloude off Ieſus Chriſte / ſo to applie your fauorable mindes eche to other that all ſtriff and contention ſe

                         aparte / yow maie ioine together in a bleſſed Chriſtian and happie ſocietie / peace and concorde / and the thinge wherevnto we wiſhe bothe the parties ſhuld agree is as folowithe.
                     The forme off reconciliation.
                     Firſte / where as in this whole treatie off reconciliation and alteration of diſcipline / ſome thinges might happē to ſeeme to rēde to the condēnation of ſome partie or parſon: we do all frelie pronounce and teſtifie eche parte off other / that neither off vs do condemne either partie / or anie perſon as thoſe whiche haue don anie thinge contrary to gods word / or probalitie off reaſon in this matter off diſcipline / but frindly and louingly euerie man dothe imbrace all men omittinge all reherſall and diſputation off thinges paſte with common and hartie praier vnto god / that from hens forthe we maie remaine / and liue together in brotherly loue to the glorie off god and comforte off vs all.
                     Concerninge the article for exerciſe off lerninge / that there be no mention made off the ſame in the booke off diſcipline but that for ſo muche as lerned men remaine in the congregation / that the miniſterie ſhall for the furtheraunce off lerninge / labor to put in vre ſuch exerciſe off lerninge as the lerned can performe and the abilitie off the churche beare.
                     Concerninge the receiuinge and diſtributinge off the treaſure 
                        
off the churche· The receauinge and diſtributinge theroff dothe apperteine to the Deacons / yet not ſo that they doo it withowt the knowledge and conſent off the Miniſters and Seniors. concerninge the kepinge off the ſaide treaſure / it maie verie well apperteine to the Deacons / yet is it not off ſuch neceſſitie out that the reſte off the miniſterie maie otherwiſe ſet order for the cuſtodie theroff / as tyme and occaſion ſhall ſerue.
                     Concerninge the Article off contribution / when the treaſure  off the churche faileth / it perteineth to the miniſters and Deacons to trauell by the waie off exhortation with the riche to helpe in that nede withowte anie further compulſion.
                     Concerninge the Article off ſendinge off common letters  for the relieff off the congregation: That there be no mention made off anye parte theroff in the booke off diſcipline but that the miniſterie with all poſſible ſecrecie vſe ſuch pollicies and means as maie beſte ſerue to the relieff and mainteinance off the congregation.
                     Concerninge the Article off makinge off lawes / that they  be made by the miniſterie and bodie off the congregation beinge called together for that purpoſe. And iff the miniſterie / or anie off them refuſe to be preſent beinge by the bodie off the congregation required therunto / whithowte iuſte cauſe by them or him alleaged / that then / after a dewe time geuen for the hearinge off the cauſe / yff they bringe not in good reaſon and iuſte cauſe off ſuche refuſall: Then to be depriued by the ſame from their or his miniſterie and newe to be choſen.

                         congregation that the offenders or offender maie be corrected or depriued accordingly. Yff the offences be leſſer

then that they ought to be publiſhed / then the ſaide miniſters or miniſter offendinge / to be moniſhed off his faulte accordinge to the diſcretion off the Scrutiners.
                     Concerninge the Article off Teſtamentes. That no man by order in this congregation ſhall be forced to Regiſter his  Teſtamente / but that their be eight or 10. graue wiſe / ſubſtantiall and honeſte men choſen by the congregation owte off whiche nomber the Teſtator ſhall haue his choiſe / or yff he omit the thinge / his executours ſhall haue the choiſe to take 2. off the ſaied 8. or 10. beſides ſuche as are made wittneſſes / whom the executers with
                           •
                        in a monethe after the death off the Teſtator ſhall make priuie to the Teſtamente / and that the ſame two / beinge required therunto / ſhall faithfully declare vnto euery partie comprehended in the will / ſo muche off the will as ſhall particulerly appertaine to euery off them / and ſhall keepe ſecrete all the reſte off the will or Teſtament as they ſhall proteſte before God and the congregation vppon there conſciences / at the time off their election.
                     And nowe in caſe it ſhall ſeeme good vnto all your wiſedomes as well off the Miniſterie and bodie off the congregation off the one part as off the diſſentinge brethern off the other part That we ſhall by oure mediation proceede anye further accordinge vnto this forme off reconciliation / whiche is here deſcribed: We doo hartely require yow / that ſignifinge your mindes vnto vs with as conueniente ſpede as ye maie / ye will alſo appoint owte on either parte / 2. Diſcreet and ſober perſons / louers off peace and concorde / whiche by conference with other two off vs / whom we ſhall appointe / may drawe theis Articles afore written into ſuch a forme as they maie be conueniently anexed to the reſte off your Diſcipline.

                     IT is not like that the brute of the cōtrouerſie / which hathe nowe at the ende off ſix monethes continued in this Enſhe

churche at Franckford / is vnknowē to ſtrangers: it is more like that ſo manie beinge priuie therto / it is caried and ſpread to farre abroad: and moſte like by the fruites ſpringinge theroff / that it hath byn vntruly reported by the willfull authors and ſtubburne mainteiners off it / not onely to the infamie / reproche / and diſcredit off the bodie off this churche and to the intent to ſtopp all relieff from the poore members off the ſame / but alſo / that their vncharitable and leude behauiours ſhulde not come to light. For it is well knowen that diuerſe charitable men (albeit their perſons and names be neither knowen nor deſired to be knowen) were / before the beginninge off this controuerſie verie liberall in ſendinge their charitie to the vſe off this whole congregation vniuerſally / and ſome were beneficiall to ſundrie members off the ſame particulerlie / whiche ſithe that time to oure knowledge they haue left vndone vtterlie. We the Miniſters off the churche / hopinge that theis men the authors and mainteners off this controuerſie would in time haue knowen their faults and made ſatiſfaction to the churche as it becomethe chriſten men to doo / did not onelie with pacience ſuffer their ſlaunderous talke and vnquiet demenour / but alſo beare with their vniuſte dealinge / and as much as in vs laye ſtudied to couer their faultie doinges. Neuertheles / ſeinge no likelyhood off their amendment / but moſte manifeſte proffes off their malice / this poore congregation / rather dailie encreaſinge then in anie parte abatinge / and thereby the pouertie theroff continually augmentinge / we thought it oure bownden dewtie in conſcience / no longer to hide the matter / but thus off neceſſitie conſtrained / to diſcloſe it / ſo as ſeinge they will not be as they ought to be / they maie at leaſte be knowen as they be. And thus we doo not for anie malice that we beare to anye mannes perſon (as god the ſercher off all hartes knoweth) but that the truth beinge knowen / ſuch good people as through vntrue reporte / haue byn perſwaded to withdrawe their good mindes and fauor from this poore congregation might vnderſtande that withowte iuſte cauſe they haue ſo longe done

it / and hereafter be the more willinge to renewe their charitie in the relieuinge off this poore church off Chriſte. And to come to the matter / ye ſhall vnderſtand that after maiſter Horne late paſtor / and the Seniors that were ioyned in the miniſterie with him had by a writinge ſubſcribed with their owne handes / openly before the congregation ſurrendred and geuen ouer their offices / reteininge neuertheles the writinge off their ſurrender in their owne handes / and yet beinge deſired by the congregation not to leaue their miniſteries / but ſtill to exerciſe the ſame: they in no wiſe woulde doo it / wherby the churche was diuers daies deſtitute off the preachinge off goddes worde. Wheruppon / the more part off the congregation / mindinge to haue the churche kept in good order and to redreſſe thoſe thinges that were a great occaſion off the former contention / ſo that after there might be a perpetuall quietnes and concorde amonge vs / went earneſtly abowte the 
                           •
                        ame. But it hapened contrarie to oure expectation / the former grudges continuinge / and newe buſines daily increaſinge / which at lenght came to the Magiſtrates eare / contrary to oure mindes and determination. For when we thought that it ſhulde withowte anie further brute / amongeſt oure ſelues haue bin pacified and ended as we would to god it had bin. Wheruppon the godly magiſtrates lamentinge muche oure diſſention / ad deſiringe oure quietnes came into oure churche and there / firſte made vs to promeſſe one to an other / that from thens foorth no mention ſhulde be made off anie former grudge or contention betweene vs but that all thinges paſte ſhuld be clene forgotten. Afterwarde / for the better continuance off loue amonge vs and good order in the churche / with the conſent off Maiſter Horne the paſtor and the Seniors diſcharged him and them off their offices and willed the churche to chuſe newe miniſters and to make a newe diſcipline (for by reaſon off the vnperfectnes off the olde Diſcipline a great parte off the former controuerſie was) as iff there had bin neuer anie churche here before. Wheruppon the church diuers times aſſemblinge / at lenght / the moſte parte of

the churche thought moſte reaſonable that amonge other an order ſhulde be in this churche like as it was in the primatiue churche and is nowe in all well reformed churches / that the treaſure ſhulde be in the cuſtodie off all the Deacons and not off anie one man alone. Maiſter Horne with certeine off the Seniors and a fewe others woulde in no wiſe agree vnto it / but to their vttermoſte reſiſte it / which gaue vs occaſion off farther iuſte ſuſpition / that the treaſure off the churche in time paſte had not bin Chriſtianly vſed.
                     And where as alſo we had deuiſed an other order / that for ſo muche as the magiſtrate dothe permit vs to vſe the cuſtomes and manners off makinge off willes that be vſed in Englande / that for the more ſuretie off oure frindes that were here or ells where / yff we were diſpoſed by oure willes to geue vnto them anie off that litle ſubſtance that god hath leſte vs / (yff we ſhulde die here) owre willes ſhulde be ſeene and exemplyfied by the Seniors / ād ſo to be owte of all daunger off countre faitinge at anie time: Horne / and chambers onelie vppon fonde will withowte any iuſte conſideration / or good reaſon cauilled againſt the ſame order / onely affirminge it to be pernitious. Theis thinges we finde manifeſtly at lenght / not to proceede off anie good minde or purpoſe but off contentious frowardnes grownded vppon ſelff loue and gaine that vnder a colour of the churche they might gather good mennes deuotions / and neuer diſtribute anie penny theroff or at the leaſte / to none (had they neuer ſo great nede) vnles they woulde / either faune / and hange on them / or ells ſuſtaine vncharitable tauntes and reproches at their handes.
                     For where Chambers aboue 13. monethes paſte had off maiſter Whithead then Paſtor and the Seniors then a letter to receaue of one ſpecial mā 20. powndes and beſides / through Horns procurement / a generall proxie to Chambers / and his deputie / to gather the deuotion off good men for the relieff off this poore congregation / whiche by their owne proceedings here before the Magiſtrates (their owne hands wrytinge teſtifinge the ſame) and otherwiſe by oure knowledge we are

certeine / they did put in practiſe / and receiued muche therby / yet Chambers vpon the accoumpt here left behinde him / neither confeſſeth that he receyued the ſaide 20. powndes nor yet anie other ſumme / neither hathe he diſtributed (duringe all the tyme he was in office yet to this daie) in this congregation / to anie one perſon (ſauing to 3. ſcollers that came with him) one penny / that he did not receiue here in this congregation and citie.
                     And yet / at his departure hence / he lefte 2. off the ſaide ſcollers (vnto whom neuertheles he promiſed ſufficient prouiſion and findinge / and neuer warned them to the contrary) in dette for their boorde and for other neceſſaries almoſt 20. guilderns whiche this poore congregation was forced to paie. Finallie / where good Miſtres Wilkinſon off bleſſed memorie / put Horne and Chambers in truſte with the deuiſinge and makinge of hir will / whereby ſhe gaue to this and other poore congregations of the poore baniſhed Engliſhe men a Chriſtian liberall relief: Albeit they haue cauſed ſome off the ſaied congregations to be paide of the ſame bequeſte / yet hithertoo wolde they not make this poore congregation priuie to the ſumme bequethed vnto it / muche leſſe paie it / nor yet (accordinge to the order of oure churches diſcipline aforeſaide) let the will be ſeene / ſo as the frindles younge ientle woman hir daughter ſhuld not be defrauded off hir right nor hir mothers will altered to hir loſſe. Furthermore / Maiſter Chambers vnderſtandinge that we were minded (accordinge to oure dewties) to requyre an accoumpte of him / for the vſe off his proxie / getteth him ſuddainly hence (accompanied with Maiſter Horne) earely in a morninge / withowte the conſent or leaue takinge off the congregation or the Miniſterie theroff / and contrarie to his one openly made promeſſe / that he would not departe / till he had anſwered all that any man coulde charge him with.

                     I wiſhe vnto yow the peace off god with my commendations. The tenor of your demaunde hathe cauſed me to differr anſweringe to your letters vntill this time not off purpos / to geue no anſwere / but that I then vppon the ſuddain wanted ſure knowledge in that thinge wherby yow chiefly charge me. At my comminge from Zurick to Frankford I was intreated by certaine men to continewe my traueiles / in gatheringe the Almes and liberalities off godly mē / to relieue therwith ſuch poore diſperſed Engliſhe brethern / As I ſhuld think moſte meete to be relieued euen as before time I had done. This requeſte put in writinge / ſubſcribed by certeine / was deliuered vnto me / not as letters teſtimoniall off authoritie / whiche as I neded not / or I required them not / neither yet that I ſhuld by force off them gather for the church off Franckford onely / or ſpecially / whiche I purpoſed not / but that I might be the rather moued to doo as before I had donne. And they then required (whiche was after promeſſe made to further my doinges with all faithfull ſecrecie / in ſuche ſorte as I ſhulde from time to time deuiſe an requier) to beſtowe

ſuche ſummes off monie as ſhulde hereafter come to my handes to ſuche vſes and purpoſes as I thought good. Therfore / as by force off thoſe letters I gathered not: So the gatheringe for Franckford churche hathe not byn nor is in my handes / nor off any other at my appointmente as ye do write.
                     Wherfore as I might / ſo I did / and that by the aduiſe off manie honeſte / graue / and godly men / departe from thenſe withowte making that accoumpte / to whiche I am not bownde / nor leauinge for the relieff off the poore / off whom ſuch haue had their portion in this bleſſinge for the time as I thought meete to be relieued. Vnto the Students whom I neuer placed there / I haue performed whar ſo euer I promiſed. The accoumpt off receiptes / paiments and remaines which ye require / I intende not to make vnto yow. But I ſhall be ready at all times and in all places to make a iuſte accoumpte off my whole dealinges in this behalff vnto them whiche haue authoritie to demaunde it off me. In the meane tyme / as I ſhall by gods helpe truly do my indeauour / to relieue the poore as I ſhal haue wherwithe and finde them meete to receiue it: So ſhall I keepe the names and ſummes ſecret as I am bownde / till by them whiche haue iuſte authoritie to louſe me I be otherwiſe appointed.

The congregation that was at Wezell wantinge amonge them / partly the comforte whiche many off them had / by M.

Theis letters obtained / M. Leauer / M. Boyes / M. Wilforde / M. Pownall and T.

They of Geneua / gaue god thanks for that it had pleaſed him ſo to incline the hartes off the lordes off Berna towardes them and gaue incouragemēt that they ſhuld not let ſlyppe ſo good an occaſion. M. I. Bodliegh (who was no ſmall ſtaie as well to that churche as to others) and W. Ke. he traueiled with them. And paſſinge thorough manie partes of the L. of B. dominion in Sauoy and Switzerland / they founde ſuche fauour in all places where they came / as verelie maie be to the great condemnation off all ſuch Engliſhe men as vſe the godly ſtranger (I meane thoſe who come for religion) ſo vncourteouſly.
               M. Leauer and the company at lenght choſe Arrow for their reſtinge place /

                  Not longe after this / Maiſter Horne and maiſter Chambers came by Arrowe to Geneua / ſeminge at that tyme to like verie well off thoſe congregations / (as the churche of Frank. alſo then did as apearethe by their letters afore) in ſo muche as the ſaid Maiſter Horne and Chambers / did diſtribute larglie to the neceſſitie of thoſe churches. So that it appeared that the olde grudge whiche had bin betweene the churche off Franck. and Geneua had bin cleane forgotten.
               It came to paſſe not many daies after / that the lorde began to ſhewe mercy vnto Englande in remouinge Queene Mary be deathe / and placinge the queens maieſtie that nowe is (whom god longe preſerue) in the ſeate / the newes wherof / as it was ioyfull to all ſuche as were in exile / So it appeared that the churche off Geneua was not behinde the reſte / who / (after that they had geuen to god hartie thankes for his great goodnes) conſulted amonge themſelues and concluded / that (for ſo muche as there had byn iarres betwene them and other churches / abowt the Booke off common praier and ceremonies) it was now expedient and neceſſary not onely that vnfained reconciliation ſhulde be betwene them but alſo that they might ſo ioine together in matters off religion and Ceremonies / that no Papiſt or other enemie ſhuld take holde or aduantage by a farther diſſention in their owne countrie /

                         off Gods fauoure and grace reſtored vnto vs by the preferment off the moſte verteous and gratious Queene Elizabethe: We lyfted vp our hartes and voices to oure heauenly father / who hathe not onely by his dewe prouidence noriſhed vs in oure baniſhement / preſerued vs / and as it were / caried vs in his winges / but alſo harde oure praiers graunted our requeſtes / pitied oure countrie and reſtored his worde. So that the greatnes off this maruelous benefit ouercomethe oure Iudgements and thoughts howe to be able worthely to receaue it and to geue thankes for the ſame. And when we had withe great comforte wayed the matter / to the intēt that we might at the leaſte ſhewe our ſelues mindefull off this moſt wonderfull and vndeſerued grace / we thought amonge other thinges howe we might beſte ſerue to godes glory in this worke and Vocation off fartheringe the goſpell off our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſte. And bicauſe / all impedimentes and cauillacions off aduerſaries might be remoued / it ſeemed good to haue your godly counſell and brotherly conference herein / whiche we deſier to lerne by this bearer our louinge brother kethe / that we might all ioyne hartes and handes together in this great worke / wherin no dowte we ſhall finde many aduerſaries and ſtaies.

               NOwe when as W. Kethe was returned to Geneua with anſwer from the congregations and companies / that were diſperſed in ſundry places off Germany and Heluetia / the congregation (after that they had rendred their humble thankes to the magiſtrates for their great goodnes towards them prepared themſelues to depart ſauinge certeine whiche remained

behinde the reſte / to witt to finiſhe the bible / and the pſalmes bothe in meeter and proſe / whiche were already begon / at the charges off ſuche as were off moſt habilitie in that congregation. And with what ſucceſſe thoſe workes were finiſhed / (eſpecially the Bible) I muſt leaue it to the Iudgementes off the godly lerned / who ſhulde beſt Iudge off the ſame.
               But yff that Bible be ſuche / as no enemie off god coulde iuſtly finde faulte with: then maie men maruell that ſuche a worke / (beinge ſo profitable) ſhulde finde ſo ſmall fauor / as not to be printed againe. Yff it be not faithfully tranſlated / then let it ſtill finde as litle fauour as it dothe bicauſe off the inconueniences that a falſe tranſlation bringes with it. The Miniſters off Geneua in an Epliſte whiche they wrote / before the newe Teſtament haue theis wordes.
               There is nothinge more requiſite to attaine the right and abſolute knowledge off the doctrine off ſaluation / wherby to reſiſt all heriſie and falſhod / then to haue the texte off the Scriptures faithfully and truly tranſlated / the conſideration wheroff moued them with one aſſent (as they ſaie in that Epiſtle to requeſte 2. off their brethern / to witt / Caluin and Beza / efſonnes to peruſe the ſame notwithſtandinge their former trauells.

What meaneth it alſo / that off thoſe alſo that are termed to be Eccleſiaſtically brought vpp and are in the miniſterie not the ſmalleſte parte / are ſaide to haue their papiſtrie in their breſtes abowte with them? Is this the good houre wherin they ſhall better profit by reſtoringe off this attire? or ſhall they not rather vaunte their creſtes as in hope to haue poperie reſtored againe? Iff anie ſhall obiecte the circumſinge off Timothy and other like examples: we right earneſtly praie him to conſider what Paule woulde haue ſaide yff any man ſhulde haue made this lawe / that euery man that is in the miniſterie off the goſpell ſhalbe conſtrained to weare the garmentes off the Phariſies / or that they in the apparell off prophane prieſtes ſhulde preach the goſpell and adminiſter the Sacramentes / and not onely circumciſe their children / nowithſtandinge that vnder ſome couler of reaſon / this ciuill cōmaundement might ſetfoorthe the ſame. yea to what ende are theis things brought in. for howe ſo euer they might at the firſt be tollerated till that by litle ād litle they might be takē awaie / yet beinge once remoued owte off the churches / we ſe not withe what commoditie

they can be reſtored to their poſſeſſion againe. Therfore we do eftſonnes repeate that we before ſaid / that we can not allowe this deuiſe nor yet hope for any good to inſue theroff Notwithſtandinge / we will gladlie geue ouer this opinion yff we ſhall lerne better reaſon therfore. What then (will the brethern ſaie on whom theis thinges are ſo throwen (iudge yow what we ought to do herein? we anſwere / that there nedethe in this anſwere a diſtinction. For the caſe off the miniſters and the caſe of the people are not all one herein. Furthermore: Manie thinges maie / yea / and ought to be borne and tollerated whiche are notwithſtandinge not iuſtly commaunded. firſte therfore / we anſwere / that albeit theis thinges (as we iudge) are not rightly reſtored to their poſſeſſiō in the congregations / yet / ſeinge that they are not off thoſe kinde of thinges whiche are of their owne nature impious and vngodly / they ſeeme to vs not to be off ſuche waight that the ſhepardes ſhulde rather geue ouer their functions then receiue the apparell / or that the flock ſhuld refuſe the publick foode of the ſoule rather then to receiue the ſame from the ſhepardes / that is appareled herein: onely / that as well the ſheaphardes as their flockes maie not ſinne againſte there conſciences (ſo that the puritie off doctrine it ſelff remaine vntouched) we do perſwade the miniſters / after they haue bothe before the queens highneſſe and alſo before the Biſhopps. ſet their conſciences at libertie by modeſte proteſtation (as dothe apperteine to ſuche Chriſtians as ſeeke not ſedition and tumulte) and yet graue accordinge to the importaunce of the cauſe / that they do in dede openly in their pariſhe / ſtill beate vpon thoſe thinges / that maye ſerue to the vtter takinge awaie off the ſtumblinge blocke. And that as God ſhall geue occaſion they will wholie geue them ſelues bothe wiſelie and meekely to correct all thoſe abuſes / but yet to beare thoſe thinges whiche they cannot ſtreight waie change / rather then forſakinge their congregation they ſhulde geue occaſion to Sathan / that ſekethe nothinge els to ſtirre vpp greater and more perilous miſchiefs then theis. As for the people (the doctrine remaining vnhurte) we

do exhorte them that for all theis thinges they will diligently heare the ſame / to vſe the Sacramentes Religiouſly / and ſo longe to grone to God with earneſt amendment off liffe vntill they obtaine off them that which dothe appertaine to the full redreſſe and amendment off the churche.
                     But againe yff that the Miniſters be commaunded not onelie to tollerate theis thinges / but alſo that they ſhall withe their ſubſcriptions allowe them as lawfull / or ells by their ſtillnes foſter them: what can we ells perſwade them to doo but that hauing witneſſed their innocencie and in the feare off the lorde tried all meanes / they ſhulde geue ouer their functions to open wronge. But oure hartes betide vs off Englande muche better thinges then theis extremities.

                         is demaunded off vs what we do Iudge off the trollinge and deſcantinge off the Pſalmes / croſſinge off thoſe babes that ſhalbe baptized / and off the demaundes in baptiſme / alſo off the rownd vnleauened waffercake and knelinge in the lordes ſupper.
                     We anſwere / that kinde off ſinginge ſemethe to be the corruption off the pure ancient churche ſeruice and glorifinge of God therin. And as for croſſinge off babes / whatſoeuer practiſe there hathe byn theroff in time of olde / yet is it moſte certeine that it is truly in theis dais throughe ſo late greeneſſe off the ſuperſtition ſo moſte abhominable / as that we iudge thoſe men to haue done aſſuredly well that haue once driuen this rite owte off the congregatiō wherof alſo we ſe not what the profit is. And we dowte not but the demaūds in baptiſme haue creapt into the churche vpon this occaſion / becauſe that through the negligēce of the biſhops the ſame forme of baptizinge of childrē was reteined which at the firſt rearing of the primatiue churche / was to be vſed at the baptizinge off thoſe that beinge off yeres did entre the profeſſion off Chriſte. This thinge alſo we maie perceiue by manie the like yet in vſe in the popiſhe baptiſme. Wherfore euen as the creame and charme vſed in baptiſme are by gods lawe aboliſhed although they were ancient / ſo wiſhe we alſo theis demaundinges / beinge

not onely vaine but foliſhe ſhuld be alſo paſſed ouer albeit that S. Auguſtine himſelff dothe ſeeme in an Epiſtle off his to ſuſtein it by certeine deuiſed conſtruction.
                     The bread whither it ought to be made with leuen or withowte we thinke it not greatly to be ſtriuen for / althoughe we Iudge it more fit and conſonant withe Chriſtes inſtitution to haue the bread at the commmunion / whiche is vſed at the common table: for why did the lorde vſe vnleuened bread / bicauſe that in that houre wherin he thought good to inſtitute his holie ſupper / not one man in all Iewrie vſed anie other. Therfore / it behoueth vs to reſtore the Iewiſhe feaſte off vnleuened bread or ells muſt it be graunted that is better to vſe the common and accuſtomed bread off all tables accordinge to the example off Chriſte / notwithſtandinge that the bread that he then tooke was vnleuened: For off the practiſe off the primatiue churche whiche the Greek churche dothe yet in this behalff reteine we ouer paſſe to write off.
                     Furthermore knelinge at the verie receypt off the ſacramente hathe in it a ſhewe off Oodly and Chriſtian reuerence and might therfore in times paſte be vſed with profit / yet for all that bicauſe owte off this fountaine the deteſtable vſe off bread worſhip did folowe / and dothe yet in theis daies ſtick in many mindes / it ſemethe to vs that it was iuſtlie aboliſhed owte frō the congregations. Therfore / we do beſeche the moſt Good and great God that it woulde pleaſe him to inſtructe bothe the Queens maieſties highneſſe and alſo the Biſhopps with ſuch deuiſe as ſhall be moſte nedefull for the perfect doinge owte off theis filthes / and that at once. In the meane time / bicauſe theis thinges / alſo are not ſuche as are in their owne nature Idolatrous we do Iudge that they ought ſo to be dealte with / as we haue aduiſed in the thinges goinge next before.
                     It is demaunded off vs whether we allowe that baptiſme whiche is adminiſtred by midwiues.
                     We anſwere that not onely we diſſalowe that baptiſme as the reſt off thinges before ſpoken off / but that we do iudge

it alſo intollerable. For it is a thinge that hathe riſen aſwell of ignorance of the verie vſe of baptiſme / as the publique miniſterie of the churche. We Iudge therfore that the miniſters are bownde ſharply to rebuke this abuſe / muche leſſe ought they to holde this falſe baptiſme / for good and firme. The reaſon why / the leened on oure ſide haue often declared. And we are alſo readie when it ſhalbe nedefull to declare.
                     It is alſo reported vnto vs that the kaies off bindinge and loſinge are practiſed in certeine courtes off the Biſhops / neither by the ſentences and iudgements off elders / whiche office that churche hathe not yet receiued / nor accordinge to the worde off God: but the authoritie off certeine lawiers and other like / whiche is more / often times by the authoritie off ſome one man / and that alſo for ſuche kinde off actions as are pure monie matters euen as the miſuſe off the ſame was in popery.
                     Wherto we anſwere that it ſemethe to vs almoſte incredible that any ſuch cuſtomes and examples (beinge moſt peruerſe) ſhulde be vſed in that kingdome / where as puritie and ſoundnes off doctrine is. For the right off excommunication and byndinge off the offender ſhalbe founde neuer to haue bin before the time of the Papiſtes in the power and hand off on

And we wiſche that this torment howſe off conſciēces and lothſome prophanation off the Eccleſiaſticall and meere ſpirituall iuriſdiction might by the authoritie off the Queens Maieſtie owte off hande be aboliſhed no otherwiſe then the marringe off the very doctrine it ſelff. And that Elderſhippe and Deacons maie be reſtored and ſet vpp according to the worde off God and cannons off the pure churche / whiche thinge / yff it be not done / verelie / we are ſore afraide that this onely thinge will be the begin̄inge off manie calamities / whiche we would god / would turne awaie from vs. For it is moſte certeine that the ſonne off god will one daie from heauen roughly reuenge theis manifeſt abuſes / wherwith the conſciences off oure brethern are troubled / excepte ſpedely / redreſſe be had therin.

Yet thus farre: as that they allowe not the thinge it ſelff for good / but do onely redeeme their vniuſte diſquieting by patience. But yff ſo be that they ſhalbe forced / not onely to tollerate this facion but alſo to approue this excommunication as lawfull and be conſtrained to aſke vnlawfull abſolution to aſſent to this manifeſt abuſe / we then exhorte them that they will rather ſuffer anie kinde off trouble then to do herin againſt their conſciences.
