His Exerciſes, containing
ſixe Treatiſes, the titles wherof are ſet down
in the next printed page: which Treatiſes are verie
neceſſarie to be read and learned of all yoong Gentlemen
that haue not bene exerciſed in ſuch diſciplines,
and yet are deſirous to haue knowledge as well in Coſmographie,
Aſtronomie, and Geographie, as alſo in the
Arte of Navigation, in which Arte it is impoſſible
to profite without the helpe
of theſe, or ſuch like inſtructions. To the furtherance of which Arte of Navigation,
the ſaid M. Blundevile ſpeciallie wrote the
ſaid Treatiſes and of meere good will doth
dedicate the ſame to all the young Gentlemen
of this Realme.
            
            
               THOV SHALT LABOR FOR PEACE PLENTIE
            
            LONDON.
Printed by John Windet, dwelling at the ſigne
of the croſſe Keies, neere Paules wharffe, and are
there to be ſolde. 1594.
         
         
            
            
            The Titles of the Treatiſes contayned
in this booke.
            
               FIrſt, a verie eaſie Arithmeticke ſo plainlie written
as any man of a mean capacitie may eaſilie learn
the ſame without the helpe of any teacher.
            Item the firſt principles of Coſmographie, and eſpecially
a plaine treatiſe of the Spheare, repreſenting the ſhape
of the whole world, together with the chiefeſt and moſt
neceſſarie vſes of the ſaid Spheare.
            Item a plaine and full deſcription of both the Globes,
aſwell Terreſtriall as Celeſtiall, and all the chiefeſt and
moſt neceſſary vſes of the ſame, in the end whereof are
ſet downe the chiefeſt vſes of the Ephemerides of Iohannes
Stadius, and of certaine neceſſarie Tables therein contained
for the better finding out of the true place of the
Sunne and Moone, and of all the reſt of the Planets vpon
the Celeſtiall Globe.
            Item a plaine and full deſcription of Petrus Plancius his
vniverſall Mappe, lately ſet forth in the yeare of our Lord
1592. contayning more places newly found, aſwell in
the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, as alſo towards the North Pole,
which no other Map made heretofore hath, whereunto

is alſo added how to find out the true diſtance betwixt anie
two places on the land or ſea, their longitudes and latitudes
being firſt knowne, and thereby you may correct
the skales or Tronkes that be not trulie ſet downe in anie
Map or Carde.
            Item, A briefe and plaine deſcription of M. Blagraue
his Aſtrolabe, otherwiſe called the Mathematicall Iewel,
ſhewing the moſt neceſſary vſes thereof, and meeteſt for
ſea men to know.
            Item the firſt & chiefeſt principles of Navigation more
plainlie and more orderly taught than they haue bene
heretofore by ſome that haue written thereof, lately collected
out of the beſt modern writers, and treaters of that
Arte.
            And moreover, I haue thought good to adde vnto
mine Arithmeticke, as an appendix depending thereon,
the vſe of the Tables of the three right lines belonging
to a circle, which lines are called Sines, lines tangent, and
lines ſecant, whereby many profitable and neceſſarie concluſions
aſwell of Aſtronomie, as of Geometrie are to be
wrought only by the help of Arithmeticke, which Tables
are ſet downe by Clauius the Ieſuite, a moſt excellent
Mathematician, in his booke of demonſtrations made vpon
the Spherickes of Theodoſius, more trulie printed than
thoſe of Monte Regio, which booke whileſt I read at mine
owne houſe, together with a loving friend of mine, I took
ſuch delight therein, as I mind (God willing) if God giue
me life, to tranſlate all thoſe propoſitions, which Clauius
himſelfe hath ſet downe of his owne, touching the quantitie
of Angles, and of their ſides, as well in right line triangles,

as in Sphericall triangles: of which matter, a
Monte Regio wrote diffuſedlie and at large, ſo Copernicus
wrote of the ſame brieflie, but therewith ſomewhat obſcurelie,
as Clauius ſaith. Moreover, in reading the Geometrie
of Albertus Durcrus, that excellent painter, and
finding manie of his concluſions verie obſcurelie interpreted
by his Latine interpreter (for he himſelfe wrote
in high Dutch) I requeſted a friend of mine, whome I
knewe to haue ſpent ſome time in the ſtudie of the Mathematicals,
not onelie plainelie to tranſlate the foreſaide
Durerus into Engliſh, but alſo to adde thereunto
manie neceſſary propoſitions of his owne, which my requeſt
he hath (I thanke him) verie well perfourmed, not
onely to my ſatisfaction, but alſo to the great commoditie
and profite of all thoſe that deſire to bee perfect in
Architecture, in the Arte of Painting, in free Maſons
craft, in Ioyners craft, in Carvers craft, or anie ſuch like
Arte commodious and ſerviceable in any common
Wealth, and I hope that he will put the ſame in print ere
it be long, his name I conceale at his owne earneſt intreatie,
although much againſt my will, but I hope that he
will make himſelfe known in the publiſhing of his Arithmeticke,
and the great Arte of Algebra, the one being
almoſt finiſhed, and the other to bee vndertaken at his
beſt leaſure, as alſo in the printing of Durerus, vnto whom
he hath added many neceſſary Geometrical concluſions,
not heard of heretofore, together with divers other of his
workes as wel in Geometrie as as in other of the Mathematicall
ſciences, if he be not called away from theſe his
ſtudies by other affaires. In the mean time I pray al young
Gentlemen and ſeamen to take theſe my labours already
ended in good part, whereby I ſeeke neither praiſe nor
glorie, but onely to profite my countrey.
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               I Greatlie reioyce to ſee ſo manie of our Engliſh
Gentlemen, both of the Court and Countrie in
theſe dayes ſo earneſtlie giuen to trauell aſwell
by ſea as land, into ſtraunge and vnknowne
countries, and ſpeciallie into the Eaſt and Weſt
Indies, following therein the good example of
diuers worthy knightes and Gentlemen that
haue ventured their liues to diſcouer ſtrange countries to the great
honour of their countrie, and to their owne immortall fame. And
becauſe that to trauell by ſea requireth skil in the Art of Nauigation,
in which it is vnpoſsible for any man to be perfect vnles he
firſt haue his Arithmetick, and alſo ſome knowledge in the principles
of Coſmographie, and ſpecially to haue the vſe of the Spheare,
of the two Globes, of the Aſtrolabe, and croſſe ſtaffe, and ſuch like
inſtruments belonging to the Arte of Navigation, I thought
good therefore to write the Treatiſes before mentioned, to ſerue as
an introduction for ſuch yoong Gentlemen as haue not bene exerciſed
in ſuch kind of ſtudies, which Treatiſes if they ſhall vouchſafe
to read with attentiue minde, and in ſuch order as they are
before ſet downe, I doubt not but that it will cauſe them hereafter
to ſeeke for further knowledge therein. And in any wiſe I
wiſh them to begin with my Arithmeticke, the contents whereof
are declared in the next chapter following. In the meane time I
do earneſtly requeſt all yoong Gentlemen to take theſe my ſimple
pamphlets no leſſe thankfullie than they haue done my horſe booke,
and in ſo doing I ſhall haue iuſt cauſe to thinke my labour well beſtowed.
         
         
            
            What cauſe firſt mooved the Author to write this Arithmeticke,
and with what order it is here taught, which
order the contents of the chapters therof hereafter following
doe plainly ſhew.
            
               I Began this Arithmeticke more than ſeuen
yeares ſince for a vertuous Gentlewoman,
and my verie deare frend M. Elizabeth
Bacon, the daughter of Sir Nicholas Bacon
Knight, a man of moſt excellent wit,
and of moſt deepe iudgment, and ſometime
Lord Keeper of the great Seale of England,
and latelie (as ſhee hath bene manie yeares paſt) the moſt loving
and faithfull wife of my worſhipfull friend M. Iuſtice Wyndham,
not long ſince deceaſed, who for his integritie of life, and
for his wiſedome and iuſtice daylie ſhewed in gouernement, and alſo
for his good hoſpitalitie deſerued great commendation. And
though at her requeſt I had made this Arithmeticke ſo plaine
and eaſie as was poſsible (to my ſeeming) yet her continuall ſickneſſe
would not ſuffer her to exerciſe her ſelfe therein. And becauſe
that diuerſe having ſeene it, and liking my plaine order of
teaching therein, were deſirous to haue copies thereof, I thought
good therefore to print the ſame, and to augment it with many neceſſarie
rules meet for thoſe that are deſirous to ſtudie any part of
Coſmographie, Aſtronomie, or Geographie, and ſpeciallie the
Arte of Navigation, in which without Arithmeticke, as I haue
ſaid before, they ſhall hardly profit. But nowe to returne to my

matter, the contents of this Arithmeticke are theſe here following.
Firſt, hauing defined what Arithmeticke is, and what numeration
or numbring is, and of what parts it conſiſteth, and how
to number any great ſumme written in many figures, I deale
with the foure ſpeciall kindes of Arithmeticke, that is, Addition,
Subtraction, multiplication, and division. Then I ſhewe the order
of working in whole numbers, called in Latine Integra, by
the rule of proportion, otherwiſe called the golden rule, or the rule
of three. Then I treat of broken numbers called Fractions, ſetting
downe ſeuen neceſſarie rules belonging thereunto, by the helpe
whereof you ſhall be the better able to adde, ſubtract, to multiplie
and divide the ſame. That done, I ſhew how to vſe the rule of three
aſwell in dealing with ſole fractions as with fractions annexed to
integrums, which rule of three is threefold, that is, the common
rule, the rule reverſe, and the double rule, the order of all which
three kindes I doe plainlie teach by examples, ſhewing wherein,
how, and when, they are to be vſed. Next to that I ſet downe the
rule of fellowſhip, a neceſſarie rule for thoſe that haue to traffique
in anie trade of merchandize, giving divers examples thereof.
Next to that I treat of Arithmeticall, and Geometricall progreſſion,
and alſo of proportion, and of the three kindes thereof, that
is, of proportion Arithmeticall, Geometricall, and muſicall.
Then I ſhew how to finde out the ſquare roote of anie number,
and alſo the vſe thereof in ſetting of Battels, and alſo how to finde
out the cubique roote of any number. And laſt of all I treat of Aſtronomicall
fractions, ſhewing how to adde, to ſubtract, to multiply
and divide the ſame. And alſo to take the ſquare root thereof,
without the knowledge of which fractions, you can neuer calculate
any thing trulie out of the Aſtronomicall Tables.
            Some perhaps do look here that I ſhould ſpeak ſomewhat of the
rules of Algebra, whereby all ſubtill and intricate queſtions of
Arithmeticke are to be vnfolded, wherewith I leaue indeede

deale, partlie, for that I haue not of long time exerciſed my ſelfe
therein, and partlie becauſe I knowe that one hath begun to write
thereof, whoſe booke being once ended, I doubt not but that hee
will ſhortlie after print the ſame to the great profite and furtherāce
of al thoſe that delight in ſuch good exerciſes. But in the mean
time I haue thought good to adde (as I haue ſaide before) vnto
this Arithmeticke a plaine deſcription, together with the vſe of
the Tables of Sines, of lines tangent and ſecant, which Tables
will pleaſure many that would gladlie know how and wherein to
vſe them, and ſpecially ſuch ſeamen as haue ſome taſte of Arithmeticke,
without the which no good almoſt is to bee done in anie
ſcience.

            To the Reader touching the order of finding
and correcting the faults eſcaped
in printing.
            
               FIrſt, I pray you vouchſafe with your
penne to correct the numbers of the
leaues of theſe bookes, which numbers
are not in ſome leaues trulie ſet
downe, that done, for the reſt of
the faults reſort to the Table following,
which conſiſteth of fiue collums,
whereof the firſt on the left
hand ſheweth the true number of the leafe, the ſeconde
collum ſheweth the page both firſt and ſecond: the third
ſheweth the line: in counting whereof you muſt begin
at the head of everie page, and ſo proceede downward,
leaving no printed line vntold, though it contayneth but
one word, omitting notwithſtanding ſuch lines as doe
containe the title of any chapter, ſo ſhall you bee ſure
to finde any fault mentioned in the ſayde Table, and
the correction thereof hard by it on the right hand: for
the fourth collum of this Table containeth the faults, and
the fift collum the correction thereof: by helpe of which
Table you may correct your owne booke, where need is,
in ſetting downe the correction in the margent right againſt
the fault found.

                  Of Arithmetike.
Cap. 1.
                  
                     WHat is Arithmetike?
                  It is the art of counting or numbring
by figures.
                  What is to number by figures?
                  It is to expreſſe the value of any number
in his proper Characters and figures,
which is called by a Latine name Numeration.
                  
                  What belongeth to Numeration?
                  Two things, to know the ſhapes of the figures, and the ſignification
of their places.
                  How many figures are there?
                  Theſe ten. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 0. Whereof the tenth made
like an. 0. as you ſée here, is called a Cypher, which is no number
of it ſelfe, but ſerueth onely to fill vp a number.
                  What is number?
                  Number is a collection or ſomme of many ones added together.
                  How is number deuided?
                  Into thrée kinds, that is Digit, Article and compound.
                  Which be they?
                  The Digit is any of the firſt 9. figures before ſet downe. Article
is any number ending in ten, as ten is one Article, twentie
is two Articles, thirtie is thrée Articles, &c. Compound is that
which is compounded of Article & Digit, as 13. 14. 17. 24. &c.
                  Shew what ſignification euery Digit hath according to his

place, and in what order ſuch place is to be conſidered in expreſsing
any number?
                  The order as touching the place, is to beginne at the right
hand, and ſo to procéede towardes the left hand. For any of the 9.
Digits whatſoeuer, ſtanding in the firſt place, which is on the
right hand, ſignifieth the value of himſelfe onely, in the ſecond
place ten times himſelfe, in the third place Hundreth times
himſelfe, in the fourth place a Thouſand times himſelfe, in the
fift place ten Thouſand times himſelf, in the ſixt place a hundreth
Thouſand times himſelfe, in the ſeuenth place a Myllion, in the
eight place ten Myllions, in the ninth place a hundreth Myllions
in the tenth place a thouſand Myllions, &c.
                  Doth the Cypher ſignifie nothing?
                  Yes it maketh a place whereſoeuer it ſtandeth, ſo as it be not
the outermoſt on the left hand: for there it hath no place at all, as
here you may ſée in this number, 04500. whereof the firſt Cypher
on the right hand, ſignifieth the firſt place, the ſecond Cypher
the ſecond place, but the laſt and outermoſt Cypher on the
left hand, ſignifieth no place at all, becauſe it hath no Digit ſtanding
before it towards the left, hand, and therefore though in this
number there be 5. figures, yet it ſignifieth no more but foure
Thouſand and fiue Hundreth.
                  By what meanes may a great number written in many figures,
be readily expreſſed or tolde?
                  By diuiding the ſame into diuerſe parts with ſtréekes, or
prickes made at the ende of euery third figure, beginning to tell
from the right hand towards the left, as in this number, 4/270/
570. In which, beginning with the Cypher on the right hand,
I tell one, two, and thrée, and there make a Stréeke, and ſo procéeding
forth ſtill towards the left hand, I make a Stréeke at the
ende of euery thirde figure, by which Stréekes or partitions I
make them now ſeuerſt numbers, and euery Stréeke must bée
named by this word Thouſand. Notwithſtanding, in expreſſing
this number being thus deuided, or any other ſuch like, you muſt
begin at the left hand, and ſay thus foure Thouſand thouſand,
thrée Hundreth twentie Thouſand, fiue Hundreth and ſeuentie:
for by reaſon of this Diuiſion, the figure 4. ſtandeth here alone,
and in the firſt place, and in déed ſignifieth 4. Myllions, and by

that means, you may more fitly expreſſe the ſaid number in ſaying
thus, foure Myllions, thrée Hundreth and twentie Thouſand, fiue
Hundreth and ſeuentie: And the better to diſcerne the Myllions
from ye reſt in great numbers, it ſhal not be a miſſe to ſet an M. ſignifiing
Myllions, right ouer the head of y• Stréek which is drawne
betwixt the ſixth and ſeuenth figures, as in this example cōtaining
a leauen figures, 34/545 m / 678/694. which is to be vttered thus,
thirtie foure Thouſand, fiue Hundreth fortie fiue Myllions, ſixe
Hundreth ſeuentie eight Thouſand, ſixe Hundreth nintie and
foure Crownes, or Pounds, or whatſoeuer other denomination or
name, it ſhall pleaſe you to giue them.
               
               
                  Of the foure ſpeciall kinds
or partes of Arithmetike.
Cap. 2.
                  
                     WHich are thoſe foure kindes?
                  Theſe, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication
and Deuiſion.
                  What, is not Numeration alſo counted as a parte?
                  Becauſe Numeration together with the figures, and places
whereof it conſiſteth, are counted rather as firſt Elements, and
principles of Arithmetike, then as partes or ſpeciall kindes
thereof.
                  
                     Of Addition.
                     
                        WHat is Addition?
                     It is that which teacheth to bring many
ſeuerall Sommes into one ſomme.
                     How is that done?
                     Firſt by placing euery ſeuerall number
one right vnder another, vnder which you
muſt drawe a line, that done, you muſt adde
together the numbers of the firſt rancke, beginning on the right

hand with the loweſt figure of the ſame rancke, and ſo going vpward
to the higheſt figure of the ſame rancke, and ſo from rancke
to rancke, til you come to the laſt, and if the Somme of any rancke
doe not excéede the number of any of the foreſaide 9. Digits, then
ſet downe that Digit which comprehendeth that number right
vnder his proper rancke, beneath the line, but if the Somme of
that rancke, excéedeth the number of any one Digit by reaſon that
it conſiſteth of Articles and Digits, then ſet downe the Digit and
kéepe the Article or Articles in your minde, to be added to the firſt
figure of the next rancke on the left hand, but if the Somme be an
euen Article or Articles: then ſet downe a Cypher, kéeping the
number of Article or Articles in your minde, be it, one, two, or
thrée, to be added to the next rancke, all which things you ſhall better
vnderſtand by this example here following. As for example, I
ſpent in one yeare 125. l. in another yeare 234. l, and in another
yeare 240. l. Now to knowe the totall Somme of all this, I
place theſe ſeueral Sommes one right vnder another.

                           
                              l
                           
                           125.
                           234.
                           240.
                           599.
                        
and then I drawe a line vnder them as here you ſée.
                     Then beginning on the right hand with the loweſt
figure of the firſt rancke aboue the line, I ſay that a
Cypher and 4. is but 4. Againe 4. and 5. maketh 9.
which I ſet down vnder ye line, then procéeding to the ſecond rancke
towards the left hand, I ſay that 4. and 3. maketh 7. and 7. and 2.
maketh 9. which I alſo ſet downe, then remoouing to the thirde
rancke, I ſay that 2. and 2. maketh 4. and 4. and 1. maketh 5.
which I alſo ſet downe as you ſée in the former example, ſo as the
totall Somme vnder the line is. 599. l.
                     Another example hauing Cyphers mixt with Digits.
                     
                        3047.
                        4508.
                        3049.
                        10/604.
                     
                     Here I ſay that 9. and 8. maketh 17. and 17. and
7 maketh 24. wherefore I ſet downe the Digit 4. and
kéepe 2. Articles in minde, which being added to the
loweſt figure of the ſecond rancke, which is 14. maketh 6. then 6.
and 4. maketh 10. here I ſet downe a Cypher, kéeping one Article
in minde, which being added to the figure 5. of the third ranck
maketh 6. which I alſo ſet downe, then I ſay that 3. and 4. maketh
7. and 7. and 3. maketh 10. for the which I ſet down firſt a Cypher,
and then becauſe there is no more to be added. I ſet downe on the
left hand the one Article which I had in minde, ſo as the whole

Somme commeth to 10/604. as in the former example.
                     How are pounds, ſhillings, pence, halfe pence, and farthings
and all other numbers of diuerſe Denominations to be added?
                     You muſt deuide euery ſeuerall name into diuerſe Collums or
Spaces by themſelues, and then beginning with the firſt on the
right hand, you muſt adde euery Collum by it ſelfe, bringing farthings
to halfe pence, and halfe pence to pence, pence to ſhillings,
and ſhillings to poundes, ſetting the Somme of euery Collum
vnder the nether line as you ſée in
this example following.

                     Here firſt beginning with the
Collum of farthings, I finde therein
3. farthings which is one halfe peny
and one farthing. Wherefore I ſet
downe the od farthing as you ſée,
and kéepe the halfe peny in minde:
then adding the halfe pennie in minde to the loweſt halfe pennie
of the ſecond Collum, I ſay that 1. in minde and 1. maketh 2. and
2. and 1. maketh 3. then 3. and 1. maketh 4. which 4. halfe pence
becauſe they make iuſt two pence, I ſet downe a Cypher kéeping
the two pence in minde, which two pence being added to 8. maketh
10. then 10. and 9. maketh 19. and 19. and 1. maketh 20:
How becauſe that 20. d. maketh one ſhilling and 8. d. I ſet down
the 8. d. kéeping the ſhilling in minde, which on ſhilling being
added to the 6. of the next Collum maketh 7. then 7. and 4. maketh
11. and 11. and 1. maketh 12. then 12. & 3. maketh 15. wherefore
I ſet downe 5. kéeping the Article in minde, which being added
to one of the next Collum maketh 2. and 2. and 1. maketh 3.
and 3. and one maketh 4. Articles, which 4. Articles maketh
40. s̄ which is two pound which I kéepe in minde, and therefore I
adde the 2. l. to the Collum of pounds, ſaying that 2. and 5. maketh
7. and 7. and 4. maketh a 11. and 11. and 5. maketh 16.
wherefore I ſet downe 6. kéeping the one Article in mind, which
being added to 2. of the next Collum, maketh 3. then 3. and 4. maketh
7. and 7. and 3. maketh 10. then 10. and 4. maketh 14.
wherefore I ſet downe 4. kéeping one Article in mind, which being
added to 3. of the next Collum maketh 4. then 4. and 2. maketh
6. and 6. and 3. maketh 9. which I alſo ſet downe, ſo as the

totall Somme amounteth to 946. l. 5. s̄. 8. d. no halfe pennie, one
farthing as you ſée in the former example.
                     How ſhall I know whether theſe seuerall Sommes be truely
added or not?
                     Some doe teach it to be done by calling out all the nines, which
way is more tedious then ſure: for the ſureſt tryall indeéde is to be
done by Subtracting the ſeuerall Sommes out of the totall
Somme, of which Subtraction we come now to ſpeake, for all the
foure ſpeciall kindes are tryed one by an other.
                  
               
               
                  Of Subtraction.
Cap. 3.
                  
                     WHat doth Subtraction teach?
                  It teacheth to take a leſſer number
out of a greater and to ſée what remayneth.
                  What is to be obſerued in this kind?
                  Firſt, you muſt ſet downe your greater
number aboue, and then the leſſer
number right vnder the ſame. As for example,
I haue lent to one 564. l. and hée
hath paide me thereof 57. l. Here to knowe what remaineth, I
firſt ſet downe the number lent, and vnder that the number paid,
and then drawe a line as you ſée in this
manner.
                  
                     Lent. 564. l.
                     Paide. 57. l.
                  
                  Here beginning on the right hand, I
firſt ſay, take 7. out of 4. that cannot bée:
wherfore I take one Article of the next figure or place of the lent
number, which Article being added to 4. maketh 14. then I ſay
take 7. out of 14. and there remaineth 7. which I ſet downe vnder
the 4. then I adde that one Article which I borrowed, to the ſecond
figure of the paide number which is 5. ſaying that 5. and 1.
in minde maketh 6. then take 6. out of 6. and there remaineth nothing,
wherefore I ſet downe a Cypher, vnder the 5. of the paide
number, then I procéede to the third figure of the lent number,

which is 5. and becauſe I finde nothing written vnder it, nor haue
nothing in minde to take out of it, I ſay, take nothing out of 5. and
their remaineth ſtill 5. ſo as the remainder is 507. l as you ſée in
this example following.
                  
                     Lent. 564. l.
                     Paid. 57. l.
                     Remaine. 507
                  
                  How ſhall I knowe whether this bee
right or not?
                  By adding the remainder and the number
paide together, the Somme whereof (if you haue done well)
wilbe all one with the number lent, as in the former example, I
firſt adde 7. and 7. together and that maketh 14. wherefore according
to the precepts of Addition before taught, I ſet downe 4. kéeping
the Article in minde, then I ſay, one in mind and 5. maketh
6. which I alſo ſet downe, then I ſay nothing and 5. is 5. which
I ſet downe in the third place, which in all maketh 564. a number
equall to the number lent, as you ſée here
following.
                  
                     Lent, 564. l.
                     Paid. 57:
                     Remaine. 507.
                     Proofe. 564.
                  
                  You may perceiue by this, that if any figure
of the paid number be greater then the
figure ouer him, out of the which it is to bée
Subtracted, you muſt alwaies borrow one
Article of his next fellow, to be added againe to him in his proper
place. But you haue to note, that hauing to deale with numbers
of diuerſe Denominatiōs, thē in borrowing any number, you muſt
alwaies haue reſpect to the Denomination or name of the thing,
from whence you borrow, as in borrowing from ſhillings you borrow
12. and not 10. from pounds you borrow not one Article but
2. Articles which doe make 20. s̄ but when the whole number is
altogether of one ſelfe Denomination, then you muſt alwaies borrow
one Article which is 10. to make vp your nūber yt wanteth. As
you ſhall more plainely perceiue by this example containing numbers
of diuerſe Denominations, as of pounds, ſhillinges and
pence, halfe pence, and farthings. Suppoſe therefore that you haue
lent to one 467. l 13. s̄. 4. d. ob. q. and hee hath paide you againe
thereof, 89. l. 16. s̄. 9. d. ob. q. Here hauing ſet downe the Somme
lent in ſeuerall Collums, according to their diuerſe names, and
then the Somme paide, right vnder the ſame, drawe a line as
you ſée in this example following.

take one out of one and nothing
remaineth, wherefore I ſet downe a Cypher, then procéeding

wherefore I borrow a ſhilling of the next Collum that is 12. d.
which being added to 4. maketh 16. pence, then I ſay take 9. out
of 16. and there remaineth 7. which I ſet downe, then procéeding
to the next, I adde the one ſhilling which I borrowed, to the 16.
which maketh 17. s̄. then I ſay take 17. s̄. out of 13. s̄. that cannot
be. wherefore I borrow one pound which is 2. Articles of the next
rancke, yt is 20. s̄. which being added to the 13. s̄. maketh 33. s̄. then
I ſay take 17. out of 33. s̄. and there remaineth 16. s̄. which I ſet
downe, then I adde the one pound which I borrowed, to 9. and
that maketh 10. then I ſay take 10. out of 7. that cannot be, wherfore
I borrow one Article out of the next 6. which being added to
the 7. maketh 17. then I ſay take 10. out of 17. and there remayneth
7. which I ſet downe, then the one, which I borrowed, I adde
to the 8. of the next rancke, and that maketh 9. Againe I ſay take 9.
out of 6. that cannot be: wherfore I borrow one Article of the next
4. which being added to 6. maketh 16. then I ſay take 9. out of 16
and there remaineth 7. which I ſet downe, then I take the one
which I borrowed out of the 4. & there remaineth 3. ſo as the remainder

                  How ſhall I trie whether this be true or not?
                  By adding the remainder and the Somme paid together: as
in the former example, and of that Addition, will riſe if you haue
done truely a Somme like in euery condition to the Somme lent:
In making which proofe or triall you cannot lightly erre, if you
remember to reduce pence to ſhillings, and ſhillings to poundes,
and therefore in the Collum of pence, no particular Somme can
be aboue 11. d, nor in the Collum of ſhillings no particular ſomme
can be aboue 19, s̄ for if it be 20, s̄, then it is a pound and muſt bée
brought to the Collum of poundes,
               
               
                  
                  
                  
                  Of Multiplication.
Cap. 4.
                  
                     WHat is Multiplication?
                  It is the producing or bringing foorth of
a third number, by Multiplying two other
numbers the one into the other: And it conſiſteth
of thrée numbers, that is the multiplycand,
the multiplyer, and the product.
                  What ſignifie thoſe names?
                  The Multiplicand is that number which
is to be multiplyed, and the multiplyer is that whereby the ſame
is multiplied, & the product is the Somme of ſuch. Multiplicatiō:
As for example, if I would multiply 4. by 3. as in ſaying 3. times
4. maketh 12. here the number of 4. is the Multiplycand, and
the number 3. is the multiplyer, and the number 12. is the product
of that Multiplycation.
                  What order is to be obſerued in multiplying, and how are
thoſe numbers to be ſet?
                  Before I teach you the true order of multiplying, I thinke it
good to ſet your downe a table of Multiplycation, which vnleſſe you
learne perfectly by hart, you ſhal neuer multiply readily nor quicklie.

                  In the front of which Table
are ſet down the 9. Digits
beginning on the left hand,
and ſo procéeding to the right
hand, from 1. to 9. Againe on
the right ſide of the ſaid Table
are ſet downe the foreſaid 9.
Digits, beginning aboue, and
ſo procéeding right downe
from 1. to 9. the vſe whereof
is thus, firſt ſéeke the Digit to be Multiplyed in the front, and ſéek
the other wherby you haue to multiply the ſame on the right hand,
and the ſquare Angle aunſwering to theſe. 2. Digits will ſhew the
product of ſuch Multiplycation. As for example hauing to multiply
7. by 6. I firſt ſéeke the greater Digit which is 7. in the front,
and the leſſer which is 6. on the right hand, the product whereof I
finde in the ſquare Angle anſwering both to 7. and to 6. to be 42.
& the like is to be obſerued in any 2. Digits that are of like value
as 7. times 7. the product whereof is 49. But the firſt Table being
perfectly learned without booke, whenſoeuer you haue to multiply
one number by another, you muſt obſerue theſe rules héere
following.
                  Firſt that you ſet downe the firſt figure of your multiplyer
right vnder the firſt figure of the number that is to be multiplyed,
on the right hand, and then orderly to place the reſt of the figures
of your multiplyer, be they few or many, towards your left hand,
directly vnder the reſt of the figures of the number that is to beé
multiplyed, for if the figures ſtand not in order one right ouer another

it will bréede a confuſion in your working. Secondly you
muſt not forget to multiply all the figures of the number that is
to be multiplyed, by the firſt figure of your multiplyer before you
deale with the next multiplyer, beginning alwaies on your right
hand, and ſo to procéed from one to another, wherby you ſhal make
as many ſeuerall products as there be figures in your multiplyer.
Thirdly you muſt remember to ſet downe the firſt figure of euery
ſeuerall product, right vnder the figure of that multiplyer, whereby
you doe multiply, and hauing ended your Multiplication, draw
a line vnder the ſeuerall products: yt done, ad the ſeueral products
together according to the rules of Addition, & the Somme therof
ſhalbe the total or general product of that Multiplycation: al which
rules you ſhall the better vnderſtand by working this example following.
Suppoſe thē that you would know how many houres there
are in a yeare, knowing firſt yt a yeare conſiſteth of 365. daies, here
becauſe that euery naturall day containeth 24. houres comprehending
both day & night, you haue to multiply 365. by 24. and therefore
you muſt firſt ſet down 365. becauſe it is the greater number,
and is the multiplycand, which muſt alwaies ſtand aboue, & right
vnder yt, your multiplyer which is 24. is to be ſet downe in his due
place, according to the Rules before taught thus as you ſée here.

                        365. the multiplicād
                        24. the multiplier.
                     
Then ſay thus 4. times 5. maketh 20. & hauing
ſet down a Cypher right vnder the 4.
kéep the 2. Articles in mind, thē ſay 4. times
6. is 24. & 2. in mind is 26. here ſet down 6.
& kéepe 2. in mind, then ſay 4. times 3. is 12. which with the 2.
in minde maketh 14. here firſt ſet downe the 4. vnder the 3. and
becauſe you can procéede no further: you muſt therefore ſet downe
hard by the 4. on the left hand the one Article which you had in
minde, then hauing cancelled the firſt figure of the multiplyer,
by making a Daſh through it with your pen, as you ſée in the example
following: Procéede with the other figure of the multiplyer,
ſaying that 2. times 5. maketh 10. wherefore ſet downe a
Cypher right vnder the ſaid 2. kéeping the one Article in minde,
then ſay 2. times 6. is 12. and one in minde maketh 13. wherfore
ſet downe 3. and kéepe one in minde, then ſay 2. times 3. is 6.
which with one in minde maketh 7. the which you muſt ſet downe,
and becauſe you haue made an end of your Multiplycation, cancell

the 2. and draw another line vnder the 2. ſeuerall products, that
done, ad together whatſoeuer is contained betwixt the two lines,
and you ſhall finde the generall product
to be 8/760. houres.
                  
                     The multiplycand.
                     365.
                     The multiplyer.
                      24.
                     The ſeuerall products. 
                     
                        
                           1460.
                           730.
                        
                     
                     The generall product
or total Som. 
                     8760.
                  
                  How ſhall I knowe whether the
laſt Multiplycation be right or not?
                  By diuiding the generall product
by the Multiplyer, for in ſo doing your
quotient will bee like vnto the firſt
Somme that was Multiplyed, which
you cannot do, vntill ſuch time as you haue learned to deuide, and
therefore hauing firſt ſhewed certaine compendious waies of
Multiplycation, I will then procéede to Diuiſion.
                  
                     Certaine compendious waies of
Multiplycation.
                     VVHen is any ſuch way to be vſed?
                     When the Multiplyer beginning on the right hand
with one Cypher or with many, endeth on the left hand with the digit
1. as theſe numbers following, 10/100/1000/&c.
                     Why what is then to be done?
                     Yf you haue to Multiply by 10. then you haue no more to doe,
but to ſet downe on the right hand of the number that is to bée
Multiplyed, one Cypher, if by a 100. then 2. Cyphers, if by a
1000. then 3. Cyphers, as for example: if you would Multiply
365. by 10. then by ſetting downe on the right hand one Cypher
as hath béene ſaid, the product will be 3/650. if you ſet downe 2.
Cyphers the product wil be 36/500. if you ſet down 3. Cyphers,
then the product will be 365/000.
                     What if the number do end on the left hand with any other
Digit, as 2. 3. or more, as 200. 300. 400?
                     Then you muſt Multiply the number of the Multiplycand firſt
by that Digit, and then adde to the end of the product on the right
hand all the Cyphers annexed to the ſaid Digit, as if you woulde
Multiply 365. by 200. Firſt ſay 2. times 5. maketh 10. and 2.
6. and one in minde is 13. and ſo to procéed in Multiplying euery
figure of the Multiplycand by 2. and you ſhall finde the product

to be 730. whereunto if you adde on the right hand 2. Cyphers
the whole product wil be 73/000.
                  
               
               
                  Of Diuiſion.
Cap. 5.
                  
                     WHat is Diuiſion?
                  Diuiſion is that whereby any number is diuided
into as many parts as you will.
                  How many numbers are incident to Diuiſion
and how are they called?
                  Theſe 4. that is to ſay, the number which is to
be diuided which is called the diuidend, the ſecond number whereby
you doe diuide which is called the Diuiſor, the third number is
called the quotient, which ſheweth how many times the Diuiſor
is comprehended in the diuidend, and the fourth number is called
the remainder, if any be.
                  What order is to be obſerued in Diuiſion?
                  This here following, firſt ſet downe your diuidend and directly
vnder that, beginning on the left hand, ſet downe your Diuiſor,
that is to ſay the firſt figure of your Diuiſor right vnder the firſt
figure of your diuidend on the left hand, and ſo conſequently one
after another procéeding towardes the right hand, which is alwaies
to be done, ſo often as your Diuiſor doth not excéed in quantitie,
the figure ſtanding right ouer his head, for if it doe, then
you muſt remoue your Diuiſor one figure further towardes the
right hand. As for example if you would diuide 487. by 53. you
muſt not ſet the firſt figure of your Diuiſor which is 5. vnder the
firſt figure of your diuidend, which is but 4. but vnder the ſecond
figure of your diuidend which is 8. for you cannot take 53. out of
48. and therefore you muſt ſet the firſt figure of your Diuiſor, vnder
the ſecond figure of the diuidend, and ſo follow on with the reſt
and then draw a line as you ſée here in this example following.
                  What is thē to be done?

                        The diuidend. 487.
                        The diuiſor. 53.
                     
(9. the quotient
                  Then you muſt aſke how many times 5. is comprehended in
48. and you ſhall finde that 5. is comprehended in 48. 9. times

which 9. being the quotient, muſt be placed on your right hand,
behind a crooked line made like a halfe Moone as you ſée in the example
aboue, then Multiply the firſt figure of the Diuiſor by the
quotient 9. and the product thereof ſhal be 45. which being taken
out of 48. there will remaine 3. which you muſt ſet downe ouer
the head of 8. and ſtréeke out the 48. and alſo the firſt figure of
your Diuiſor which is 5. that done Multiply the ſecond figure of
your diuiſor which is 3. by the foreſaid quotient which is 9. & the
product therof wil be 27. which being taken out of 37. ther remaineth
10. which you muſt ſet ouer the head of 37. and cancell the
37. and alſo the 3. beneath, as you ſée in this example following.

                        〈 math 〉
                     
                  
                  Wherein you ſée
that the diuidend is
487. the Diuiſor 53
the quotient 9. and
the remainder 10. which if you will apply to any vſe you may
imagine that there is 487. l. to be diuided amongſt 53. ſoldiours,
and by working as before, you ſhal find that euery Souldiour muſt
haue 9. l. and there ſhal be remaining 10. l. to be diuided amongſt
the foreſaid 53. Souldiours, which 10. l. being reduced to ſhillings,
may bee diuided amongſt the Souldiours as well as the
pounds: As for example if you Multiply 10. l. by 20. s̄. it will
make 200. s̄. which being diuided by 53. the firſt Diuiſor, the
quotient will be 3. s̄. and the remainder 41. s̄. and that being reduced
into pence, which is done by Multiplying 41. by 12. the
quotient, will be 9. d. and the remainder 15. d. which if you Multiply
by 4. you ſhall reduce them to farthings, the product whereof
will be 60. which product being diuided by 53. the firſt Diuiſor
you ſhall find in the quotient 1. farthing and the remainder to
be 7/53 of a farthing, the value of which Fraction how to find out is
taught hereafter when wee come to ſpeake of Fractions. So as
you ſée by this meanes that euery Souldiour ſhall haue for his
ſhare 9. l. 3. s̄. 9. d. q. and ſome what more a thing of no moment.
                  How many things are to be remembred in Diuiſion?
                  Theſe fiue Rules here following. Firſt that you put no number
at one time in the quotient aboue 9. Secondly to moderate
your quotient in ſuch ſorte, as hauing Multiplyed the firſt figure
of the Deuiſor by the quotient, there may remaine ſufficient for

the next figure of the Diuiſor being Multiplyed by the quotient
to be deducted out of that number which ſtandeth right ouer his
head. Thirdly that you Multiply euery figure contained in the
Diuiſor by the quotient. Fourthly that if at any time in working
it happeneth ſo as your Diuiſor is not comprehended in the number
ouer his head, then to put a Cypher in the quotient and to remoue
your Diuiſor one figure further towards the right hand,
and that done to worke as before. Fiftly to ſée that the laſt remainder,
if there be any left, doe not excéede in quantitie the Diuiſor,
all which things you ſhall better vnderſtand by this one example
following: Suppoſe then that you haue to diuide 819096. by
92. here hauing ſet downe your diuidend and Diuiſor in ſuch order
as is before taught, and as you ſée here in this example.

                        〈 math 〉
                     
                  
                  Firſt aſke howe
many times 9. is in
81. and you ſhal find
the quotient to be 8.
which being Multiplyed
into 9. maketh
72. which if you take out of 81. there ſhall remaine 9. which muſt
be ſet downe ouer the head of the figure 1. and cancel the ſaid 81.
together with the firſt figure of the Diuiſor, which is 9. then ſay
2. times 8. is 16. which being Subtracted out of 99. there remaineth
83. which you muſt ſet ouer the head of the 99. and cancell
the 99. that is aboue, and alſo the 2. beneath, as you ſée in the
former example. That done remoue your Diuiſor towardes the
right hand, that is to ſay by ſetting the laſt figure of your Diuiſor
which is 2. vnder the next Cypher on the right hand, and place
the firſt figure of your Diuiſor which is 9. next to that towardes
the left hand: then aſke how many times 9. is comprehended in
83. and you ſhall find 9. times, which 9. muſt be ſet downe in the
quotient next to the 8. then ſay 9. times 9. is 81. which being taken
out of 83. there remaineth 2. then hauing ſet downe the 2.
ouer the head of 3. cancel the 83. aboue & alſo the 9. beneath, then
Multiply the laſt figure of the Diuiſor which is 2. by the 9. which
is in the quotient, and the product thereof is 18. which being taken
out of 20. there remaineth 2. which 2. muſt be ſet downe ouer
the Cypher, and the Cypher cancelled and alſo the 2. beneath, as

you ſée in this example following.

                        〈 math 〉
                     
                  
                  That doone remooue
your Diuiſor one figure
further towards the right
hand by ſetting the 2. vnder
the 9. which is the laſt figure ſaue one of the diuidend, and
place the firſt figure of your Diuiſor which is 9. next to that on the
left hand, then aſke how many times 9. is conteined in 2. and you
ſhall finde none, wherefore you muſt ſet downe a Cypher in the
quotient and cancell the Diuiſor as you ſée in this example

                        〈 math 〉
                     
                  
                  That done remoue
your Diuiſor againe by
ſetting the 2. vnder the
laſt figure of the diuidēd
and place the 9. next to that on the left hand, then aſke how many
times 9. is contained in 29. and you ſhall find 3. times, which 3.
you muſt ſet downe in the quotient as you ſée in the example following,
then Multiply the firſt figure of your Diuiſor which is 9.
by 3. and the product thereof will be 27. which being taken out of
29. there will remaine 2. which 2. you muſt ſet ouer the head of 9
and cancell the 9. aboue, together with the 9. beneath, then Multiply
the 3. which is in the quotient by the laſt figure of your Diuiſor
which is 2. and the product thereof will be 6. which being taken
out of 26. there remaineth 20. wherefore you muſt ſet downe
a Cypher ouer the 6. which is the laſt figure of the diuidend, and
cancell the ſaid 6. aboue, and alſo the 2. beneath and then you
haue done rightly, and in ſuch order as all the former examples
and this alſo next following doe plainely ſhew.

                        〈 math 〉
                     
                  
                  For heere
you ſée that ye
diuidende is
819/096. the
Diuiſor 92.
the quotient
8903. and the remainder 20. which remainder muſt be ſet on the
right hand of the quotient ouer the Diuiſor, hauing a line drawne
betwixt them as you ſée in the laſt example.
                  
                     
How ſhall I know whether I haue diuided truely or not?
                  By Multiplying the quotient by your Diuiſor & by adding to
the product thereof the remainder, for ſo ſhall you haue a number
like to the firſt diuidend if you haue wrought well, if not, then your
Somme will be either more or leſſe then the diuidend.
                  
                     Certaine compendious waies of
Diuiſion.
                     IS there no ſhorter way of Diuiſion?
                     No, vnleſſe the Diuiſor hath one Cypher or more on the
right hand, for then you may vſe a bréefer way by cutting off the
laſt figure, or figures of the diuidend: As for example if you had to
diuide 3708. by 10. heere cut off the laſt figure 8. with a daſh of
your penne in this wiſe 370/8. and the quotient will be 370. and
the remainder ſhall be 8. Againe if you had to diuide the foreſaide
number by 100. then cut off the 2. laſt figures of the diuidend, that
is the 8. & the cypher ſtanding next it, and then the quotient wil be
but 37. and the remainder 8. as before. but if you haue to diuide any
number by 1000. then you muſt cut off 3. figures of the diuidend,
and ſo forth, remembring alwaies for euery Cypher in the
Diuiſor, to cut off one figure or Cypher of the diuidend.
                  
                  
                     Of halfing any number.
                     
                        HOw is that done?
                     By diuiding the number by 2. As for example, if you would
knowe the halfe of 3708. diuide the ſame by 2. and you ſhall finde
the quotient to be 1854. which is the iuſt one halfe of the diuidend.

                     WHerefore is it called the Rule of three?
                  Becauſe that by 3. knowne numbers, it teacheth
you to finde out a fourth number vnknowne.
                  How are ſuch 3. numbers to be placed?
                  The firſt is to be placed on the left hand, the third
on the right hand, and the ſecond in the middeſt betwixt both.
                  How ſhall I know in what place each one is to be ſet?
                  By marking to what number the queſtion is annexed, for yt muſt
alwaies be the third number, and hauing the third number, you
ſhall quickely haue the firſt, becauſe the firſt and third muſt alwaies
be of one ſelfe Denomination or name, betwixt which two,
the ſecond number is to be placed: As for example let this bee the
queſtion. If I pay 35. s̄. for 13. yards of Linnen cloth, how much
ſhall I pay for 3. yards, here becauſe the queſtion is annexed to
the number 3. yards, that muſt bee the third number and is to
be placed on the right hand, then becauſe that the number 13.
yards is of the ſelfe ſame Denomination, that muſt bee the firſt
number, and is to be placed on the left hand, & the number 35. s̄.
(which is the price) is to be placed in the middeſt betwixt the other
two, as you ſée here following.

                        
                           yards,
                           
                              s̄.
                           
                             yards:
                        
                        
                           13.
                           35.
                           3.
                        
                     
                  
                  Now muſt you make your queſtion in
this manner, if 13. yards did coſt me 35. s̄.
what ſhall 3. yards coſt me, and ſo the firſt
and laſt ſhal be of one Denomination or name, that is to ſayyards.
                  What order is to be obſerued in working by this rule?
                  You muſt Multiply the third and ſecond numbers the one into
the other, and diuide the product ther of by the firſt, and the quotient
will ſhew you what the fourth number ſhoulde bee, which
fourth number is alwaies of like Denomination to the ſecond or
middle number, as in the former example, firſt Multiply 35. by 3.
and the product will be 105. which if you diuide by 13. the quotient
will be 8. s̄. and one third of a ſhilling which is 4. d. and that
is the price of 3. yards which is the number that you ſéek to know.
And this is the common kind of working by the Rule of 3. whereof
it is called the common Rule of thrée.
                  What if there be diuerſe Denominations either of Coyne
as of pounds, ſhillings, and pence, or parts of yards, as quarters,
and halfe quarters, and ſuch like?
                  
                     
Then you muſt reduce them all to the ſmalleſt Denomination
which belongeth to Fractions, whereof we come now to treate of.

Cap. 7.
                  
                     WHat are Fractions?
                  They are broken partes of ſome whole thing
called in Latine Integrum.
                  
                  What is Integrum?
                  Any thing that is whole, and not broken, or diuided
into parts: As one whole yard, a pound, a
ſhilling.
                  Of how many numbers doth a Fraction conſiſt?
                  Of two, that is the Numerator, and the denominator, whereof
the Numerator is alwaies ſet aboue, and the denominator beneath,
hauing a little line drawne betwixt them thus ½ which ſignifieth one
ſecond or one halfe, againe two thirds and thrée fourths are written
thus, 23/34 whereof the firſt ſignifieth two thirds, and the other thrée
fourths and ſuch like.
                  What is ment by theſe two words Numerator, and Denominator,
and whereto ſerue they?
                  The denominator is as much to ſay as the namer of the parts,
which ſheweth into how many parts the Integrum is to be diuided,
and the Numerator is as much to ſay as the Numberer, and ſheweth
how many of thoſe parts are to be taken: As for example ⅔ of a
ſhilling, here the nethermoſt called the denominator, ſheweth that
the ſhilling is to be diuided into thrée parts, as into thrée groats, and
the vpper number called the Numerator, ſheweth that you muſt
take 2. out of thoſe 3. parts, ſo as ⅔ of a ſhilling is as much to ſay
as 2. groats or 8. d. Againe Fractions may be diuided into two
kinds, that is, into ſimple Fractions, and into Fractions of Fractions.
                  Define thoſe two kinds?
                  Simple Fractions are ſuch as I ſpeake of before which are the
firſt & limediate parts of any Integrum that is diuided into parts,

but if thoſe Fractions bee diuided into more Fractions, then are
they called Fractions of Fractions, as when I ſay thrée fourthes
of two thirds, of ſix ſeuenthes and ſuch like.
                  How are ſuch Fractions to be ſet downe in writing?
                  In manner of ſimple Fractions thus ¾ of ⅔ of 6/7.
                  Make ſome demonſtration of this example that I may the
better vnderſtand it?
                  Imagine that there is a whole peece of Golde of vii. s̄. as our
Angel in times paſt hath bene, which vii. s̄. be the vii. partes of that
péece of Gold, for tryall whereof laie downe before you vii. twelue
pennie péeces of Siluer, or in ſtéede thereof vii counters, to ſignifie
thoſe vii. partes, of which vii. parts you muſt firſt take away vi. reiecting
or laying a ſide the od ſeuenth part, then diuide thoſe 6. parts
into 3. parts, and euery ſuch part will be iuſt 2. s̄. of which 3. parts
you muſt take away 2. partes that is 4. s̄. reiecting the other third
part which remaineth, that done, diuide thoſe 2. parts which you
haue taken away into 4. parts, which is 4. s̄. and take 3. of them reiecting
the fourth part, ſo ſhall you finde that ¾ of ⅔ of 6/7 of the foreſaid
péece of Golde is iuſt 3. s̄. and there remaineth ſtill of the parts
reiected 4. s̄. which being added to 3. s̄. that was taken away, doe
make vp againe the whole Integrum of 7. s. Notwithſtanding
Fractions of Fractions doe ſéeldome chaunce in the Diuiſion of any
number, but if they doe, you muſt reduce them into ſimple Fractions,
before you can deale with them any manner of way, and becauſe
there are diuerſe rules belonging to Fractions, without the
knowledge whereof you can nether adde, nor ſubtract them, nor yet
ioyne them with any Integrum, I wil briefly ſet downe here ſeauen
neceſſarie rules for the ſame.
                  
                     Seauen neceſſarie Rules belonging
to Fractions.
                     VVHat doth the firſt rule teach?
                     To bring Fractions of Fractions into ſimple Fractions.
                     How is that done?
                     Thus, Multiply the firſt Numerator into the ſecond, and if
there be any more Fractions, then Multiply alſo the ſaid product
of the firſt two Numerators into the third Numerator, and that

ſhall be the Numerator of the ſimple Fraction, then Multiply the
denominators in like manner, and the Somme thereof ſhall be the
denominator of the ſimple Fraction, as in the former example ¾
of ⅔ of 6/7 here I Multiply the firſt 2. Numerators together, in ſaying
2. times 3. maketh 6. now becauſe I haue a third Numerator,
I multiply the product of the firſt 2. Numerators, which is 6. into
the third Numerator which is alſo 6. ſaying, 6. times 6. maketh
36. and that ſhall be the Numerator of the ſimple Fraction,
which I ſet downe. Then by Multiplying the 3. denominators in
like manner, I finde the denominator of the ſimple Fraction to be
84. the which I ſet downe vnder the 36. and draw a line betwixt
them ſo as now I finde that ¾ of ⅔ of 6/7 do make 36/84 which indéed is
no more but 3/7 as you ſhall learne hereafter by the ſixt rule.
                     What doth the ſecond rule teach?
                     To bring Fractions being more in value then Integrums into
integrums.
                     When are Fractions ſaid to be more then integrums?
                     When the Numerator is a greater number thē the denominator,
for if they be both of like value as 34/34 and ſuch like, then ſuch
Fraction is an euen integrum.
                     How ſhall I know how many Integrums ſuch Fractions as be
more then Integrums doe containe?
                     By diuiding the Numerator by the denominator, and if any
thing remaine, write that aboue the denominator, as in this example
806/7 here if you diuide 806. by 7. which is the denominator, you
ſhall finde the quotient to containe 115. Integrums, and the remainder
to be 1. which is 1/7.
                     VVhat doth the third rule teach?
                     To bring Integrums into parts by Multiplying the number
of the Integrums by the denominator of thoſe partes, as if you
would bring 64. yards into quarters, Multiply 64. by 4. and there
will ariſe thereof 256. quarters.
                     VVhat doth the fourth rule teach?
                     It teacheth to bring Integrums hauing Fractions annexed to
them, into one Fraction.
                     How is that done?
                     Multiply the number of the Integrums by the denominator of
the Fraction, and then adde to the product the Numerator of the

ſaide Fraction, and that ſomme ſhall be the Numerator, vnder
which write the denominator aforeſaid, and ſo you ſhall finde that
23. Integrums hauing ⅔ annexed thereunto ſhall make 
                           •
                        1/3.
                     What doth the fift rule teach?
                     It teacheth to expreſſe a Fraction written with many figures,
in ſo fewe as may be.
                     How ſhall I doe that?
                     Thus, finde out ſome number that may firſt diuide the Numerator,
and then the denominator ſeuerally by themſelues, without
leauing in either of them any remainder, and the quotient of the
firſt Diuiſion will ſhew the Numerator, and the quotient of the ſecond
Diuiſion will ſhew the denominator, but if you cannot readily
finde out a number that will diuide them both without leauing
ſome remainder, then leaue not to Subtract the leſſer number out
of the greater, vntill you finde two like numbers, by one of the
which two like numbers diuide both the Numerator, and alſo the
denominator ſeuerally as before, and the quotient will ſhew that
which you ſéeke: but if ſuch 2. like numbers cannot be found, then
you may aſſure your ſelfe that the Fraction cannot be written in
fewer figures then they alreadie be.
                     Giue examples of theſe two waies?
                     For example of the firſt way, ſuppoſe that you would expreſſe
9/12 in leſſer numbers, here ſéeke out ſome number that may diuide
euenly both the Numerator, and alſo the denominator, without
leauing in either of them any remainder, which by diuiding each of
them by the number of 3. you may doe: For by aſking how many
times 3. is contained in 9. the quotient will be 3. and in aſking
how many times 3 is conteined in 12. the quotient ſhall be 4. ſo
ſhall you find 9/12 to be no more then ¾. Now for example of the ſecond
way, let 27/81 be the Fraction which you would ſet down in fewer
figures, here becauſe you cannot readily finde out a number that
wil euenly diuide both the Numerator and the denominator, Subtract
the leſſer out of the greater, that is to ſay 27. out of 81. and
there will ſtill remaine 54. from which Subtract 27. and there
will remaine 27. which 2. numbers becauſe they are both like, diuide
the Numerator and denominator of the foreſaid Fraction,
each of them by one of theſe numbers, that is to ſay, by 27. and the
quotient of the firſt Diuiſion will ſhew you the Numerator which

is 1. and the quotient of the ſecond Diuiſion wil ſhew you the denominator
which is 3. ſo as you ſhal find ⅓ to be as much in value
as 27/81 and note that when there be Cyphers both in the Numerator
and in the denominator ſtanding in ſuch ſorte as they may bee
euenly cut off, the remainder will ſhew the feweſt figures, wher in
the Fraction may be written as 200/500 here by cutting off the two
Cyphers as well beneath as aboue the line, with a daſh of your
penne in this manner ⅖ 00/00 the remainder ſhall bee ⅖ which is as
much in value as 200/500.
                     What doth the ſixt rule teach?
                     It teacheth to find out the value of the Fraction of any integrum.
                     How is that done?
                     Thus, Multiply the Numerator by the knowne partes of the
Integrum, and diuide the product thereof by the denominator, ſo
ſhall you haue the value of the Fraction: As for example, if you
would know the value of ¾ of an Angel, conſider firſt what partes
an Angel hath, and you ſhall find the parts thereof to be 10. s. or
30. groats, here if you Multiply 3. by 10. s. it will make 30. s.
which being diuided by 4. you ſhall finde in the quotient 7. s. and
the remainder to be 2/4 or one half of a ſhilling, which is 6. d. Againe
if you Multiply 3. by 30. groates it will make 90. groats, which
being diuided by 4. you ſhall finde in the quotient 22. groats, and
the remainder to be 2/4 or one halfe of a groat which is 2. pence, making
in all 7. s. 6. d. like vnto the firſt Somme, ſo as you ſée that
¾ of an Angel is 7. s. 6. d. and thus you may deale with the Fractions
of any other Integrum that hath knowne parts.
                     What doth the ſeauenth rule teach?
                     It teacheth to bring Fractions of diuerſe denominations to
one ſelfe denomination, without the which nether Addition, nor
Subtraction of Fractions can be made: As for example if you
would adde ⅔ and ⅘ together, you muſt firſt bring them to one ſelfe
denomination thus, Multiply the denominators the one into the
other, and the product thereof ſhall be a common denominator to
both the Fractions, wherefore ſay 3. times 5. doe make 15. which
muſt be ſet downe in 2. ſeueral places by them ſelues thus, 15. and
15. then Multiply the Numerator of the firſt Fraction into the denominator
of the ſecond, as 2. into 5. maketh 10. which ſet downe

ouer the firſt common denominator thus 10/15 then Multiply the
Numerator of the ſecond Fraction into the denominator of the
firſt Fraction, as 4. into 3. which maketh 12. and that muſt bée
likewiſe ſet downe ouer the ſecond common denominator thus 12/15
ſo ſhall you find that ⅔ and ⅘ are all one in value with 10/15 and 12/15.
                  
               
               
                  Addition of Fractions.
Cap. 8.
                  
                     HOw are Fractiōs to be added together?
                  Fractions being firſt brought to one
denomination are eaſily added, for then
you haue no more to doe but to adde the
Numerators together, and to write the
common denominator vnder the Somme
of ſuch Addition, as in the former example,
10/15 being added to 12/15 maketh 22/15 but if
the denominators be not like, then you muſt make them like by the
ſeuenth rule before taught.
                  What if there be three Fractions of diuerſe denominations
to be added together as ⅔ ¾ ⅘?
                  Then hauing reduced the 2. firſt to one ſelf denomination adde
the 2. Numerators together and write vnder the Somme thereof
the common denominator, that done, deale with that Fraction laſt
found, and with the third as you did before with the 2. Fractions
that had diuerſe denominations, and ſo you ſhall find that ⅔ and ¾
being firſt brought to one denomination, and then added together
doe make 17/12. whereto if you will adde ⅘. then you muſt bring
them againe to one ſelfe denomination, and ſo you ſhall finde that
17/12. and ⅘ doe make 85/60. and 48/60. which laſt 2. Numerators being
added together doe make in all 133/60. which is 2. Integrums and
13/60.
                  
                     Subtraction of Fractions.
                     HOw are Fractions to be Subtracted, one out of another, or
out of Integrums?
                     
                        
Firſt make the denominators like as you did before in Addition,
then take the leſſer Numerator out of the greater, and vnder
the remainder thereof write the common denominator, ſo ſhall you
find that 3/7. being taken out of 6/7. there remaineth 3/7. but if you
would Subtract Fractions out of Integrums, then you muſt
take one of the Integrums and breake it into partes. As for example,
to Subtract 3/7. out of 9. Integrums take one from 9. and
breake it into parts making it 7/7. for that is one Integrum, for
whenſoeuer the Numerator is made like and equall to the denominator,
it ſignifieth one Integrum, then take 3/7. out of 7/7. and
there remaineth 4/7. and 8. integrums.
                     What is to be obſerued in breaking the integrum?
                     In breaking the Integrum, you are to be directed alwaies by the
denominator of the Fraction which you haue to Subtract, for the
Integrum which ſhould be the Numerator, muſt be equall in value
to the ſaid denominator, as before is ſaid.
                  
                  
                     Multiplycation of Fractions.
                     HOw are Fractions to be Multiplyed by Fractions, or Integrums
by Fractions?
                     As touching Fractions, Multiply the Numerators one into
another, and the product thereof ſhall bee the Numerator, then
Multiply the denominators in like manner, and the product therof
ſhall be the denominator, ſo ſhall you find that 5/7. being Multiplyed
by ¾. doe make 15/28. But if you would Multiply integrums
by Fractions, then Multiply the integrums by the Numerator of
the Fraction, and vnder the product thereof, ſet downe the denominator
of the ſame Fraction, drawing a line betwixt them, ſo ſhal
you find that 20. integrums being Multiplyed by 5/12. doe make
100/12. that is to ſay 8. integrums and 4/12. which is ⅓, &c.
                  
                  
                     Diuiſion of Fractions.
                     HOw are Fractions to be diuided by Fractions, or integrums
by Fractions, or Fractions by integrums?
                     The diuiſon of Fractions is done by Multiplycation thus, firſt
ſet downe your diuidend on the left hand, and the Diuiſor alwaies

on the right hand, and then draw 2. croſſe lines like a Saint Andrews
croſſe betwixt them, which ſhal direct you in your working:
As for example, if you woulde diuide ⅔. by ⅘. ſet them downe
diuidend thus ⅔ ⅘ diuiſor worke as followeth, firſt Multiply the Numerator
of the diuidend, by the denominator of the Diuiſor, and
the product there of ſhalbe the Numerator, then Multiply the denominator
of the dividend, by the Numerator of the Diuiſor, and
that ſhall be the denominator, ſo ſhall you find that ⅔. being diuided
by ⅘. there remaineth 10/12. that is ⅚. but if you would diuide Integrums
by Fractions, or cōtrarywiſe Fractions by Integrums,
then make of the Integrums a Fraction, by ſetting down 1. in the
place of a denominator vnder the Integrums, and worke as before,
ſo ſhall you find that 7/1. Integrums being diuided by ¾. doe
make 28/3. contrarily if you diuide ¾. by 7/1. Integrums there will
ariſe 3/28.
                     What if I haue to diuide Fractions annexed to integrums?
                     Then you muſt firſt reduce each Integrum with his Fraction
annexed, into one ſelfe Fraction by the fourth rule of Fractions
before taught. As for example, if you would diuide 9. Integrums
hauing ¾. thereunto annexed, by 3. Integrums and ⅓. heere the
fourth rule of Fractions teacheth you firſt to Multiply the Integrum
9. by 4. which is the denominator of the Fraction annexed,
the product whereof is 36. whereunto by adding the Numerator
of the ſame Fraction which is 3. you ſhall make the Numerator
of the Diuidend to be 39. vnder which you muſt ſet the denominator
4. thus 39/4. and that is your whole diuidend, then hauing in
like manner brought the Diuiſor which is 3. Integrums and ⅓.
into one ſelfe Fraction, worke as the former rule of Diuiſion teacheth
you, and you ſhall produce 117/40. which is 2. Integrums and
37/40.
                  
               
               
                  The rule of three belonging
to Fractions.
Cap. 9.
                  VVHat order is to bee obſerued in this rule hauing to
deale with Fractions onely?
                  
                     
The ſelfe ſame order that hath beene taught before touching
Integrums: for in working with Fractions you muſt haue alſo 3.
ſeuerall numbers, and you muſt ſée that the firſt and third numbers
be of one ſelfe denomination, and that number to bee placed
alwaies in the third place whereunto the queſtion is annexed, and
then to Multiply the ſecond by the third, and to diuide by the firſt,
and ſo the fourth number which you ſéeke to know, ſhall appeare:
As for example if ¾. of an ell of fine Holland coſt me ⅔. of an Engliſh
crowne, in value 15. groats, what ſhall ⅚. of an ell coſt me,
here firſt you muſt ſet downe your 3. ſeuerall numbers in order
thus, ¾ ell ⅔ ⅚ ell. ſo as the firſt and third may be of one ſelfe denomination,
then Multiply the ſecond and third Fraction the one into
the other, which will make 10/18. and that being diuided by ¾. which
is the firſt Fraction will produce 40/54. of a crowne, the value of
which Fraction if you ſéeke to knowe by helpe of the ſixt rule of
Fractions, teaching you to Multiply the Numerator of the Fraction,
by the knowne parts of a crown which are 5 s̄ or 15. groats,
you ſhall finde the value of that Fraction to be 11. groats and 6/54.
of a groat, which is one farthing and ſomewhat more, ſuppoſing
the leaſt knowen parts of a groat to be 16. farthings.
               
               
                  The golden Rule reuerſe called in
Latine regula euerſa that is to ſay
turned back-ward.
Cap. 10.
                  
                     WHat is the order of this rule?
                  Multiply the firſt by the ſecond, and diuide the
product therof by ye third, as if a pennie Loafe muſt
waigh 2. l. Wheate being at 3. s̄. the buſhell, what
ſhall a pennie Loafe waigh when Wheate is at
2. s̄. the huſhell, the queſtion muſt be framed thus,
if 3. s̄. require 2. l waight, what ſhall 2. s̄. haue, then by working
according to this rule you ſhall finde that the pennie Loafe muſt
waigh. 3. l.
                  
                     
                     Another example of the ſame rule.
                     I would know how many yards of Bayes bearing in breadth
7/4. wil ſuffice to line 7. yards of Silke bearing in breadth 3. quarters
& a halfe. Here you muſt frame your queſtion thus, if ¾. and
½ require 7. yards, what ſhall 7/4. require, but becauſe the firſt and
third number of this queſtion are not of one ſelfe denomination by
reaſon of the Fraction annexed to the firſt number, you ſhall doe
well to reduce the firſt and third number both into halfe quarters,
and then to worke as though they were all Integrums, which is
more eaſie then to make al the numbers Fractions, wherefore ſay
thus: If 7. halfe quarters doe require 7. yards, what ſhall 14.
halfe quarters require, and in working by the rule Reuerſe, you
ſhall finde in the quotient 3. yards of Bayes and a halfe.

                     WHereto ſerues this rule and what order is to
be obſerued therein?
                  This rule ſerueth to vnfold two queſtions
wrapt in one, as thus. If I pay 4. d. for the
carriage of 20. l. waight 30. miles, what ſhal
I pay for the carriage of 50. l. waight 60.
miles, here of this and ſuch like demaunds,
you muſt make 2. ſundrie queſtions, and the fourth Somme of
the firſt queſtion being found, ſhall be the ſecond or middle number
of the ſecond queſtion: wherefore frame your firſt queſtion thus,
if 20. l. coſt 4. d what ſhall 50. l coſt, and ſhall find that it will
coſt you 10. d. then ſay if 30. miles coſt 10. d. what ſhall 60. miles
coſt and you ſhall finde that it will coſt 20. d. And note that each
of theſe 2. queſtions is to bee wrought by the common rule of 3.
that is to ſay by Multiplying the ſecond into the third, and by diuiding
the product thereof by the firſt, and the fourth found number

of the firſt queſtion muſt be the ſecond, or middle number of the
ſecond queſtion, as in the former example, you ſée that 10. d. which
was the fourth found number, is here the middle number of the
ſecond queſtion.
                  
                     Another example.
                     If 25. l. doe gaine me 8. l. in 4. yeares, how much ſhall a
100. l. win one in 10. yeares, both theſe queſtions are alſo to bee
wrought by the common rule of 3. Wherefore ſet downe the firſt
queſtion thus, if 25. l. yéeldeth 8. l. what ſhall 100. l. yéelde, and
you ſhall finde 32. l. then ſay 4. yeares yéeldeth 32. l. what ſhall
10. yeares yéelde, and you ſhall find 80. l. But note that theſe double
queſtions, may be put in ſuch ſort as you muſt worke ye firſt or
ſecond queſtion, ſometimes by the rule reuerſe. As in this queſtion
here following, if 6. l. win 8. Crownes in 10. yeares, in how
many yeares ſhall 3. l. win 12. Crownes, here frame your firſt
queſtion thus, if 6. l. require 10. yeares how many yeares ſhall
3. l. require: And in working this queſtion by the rule Reuerſe, you
ſhall finde 20. yeares, then for the ſecond queſtion ſay thus, if 8.
Crownes require 20. yeares, how many yeares ſhal 12. Crownes
require: Here if you worke by the common rule of 3. you ſhall
finde 30 yeares.
                  
                  
                     Another example.
                     If 7. horſes doe eate 12. buſhels of Dates in 20. daies, how
many buſhels ſhall 14. horſes eate in 15. daies, here frame your
firſt queſtion thus, if 7. horſes doe eate 12. buſhels, what will 14
horſes eate, and in working by the common rule of 3. you ſhall
finde in the quotient 24. buſhels, then frame your queſtion thus, if
20. daies require 24. buſhels, what will 15. daies require, here
in working by the common rule of 3. you ſhall finde in the quotient
18. buſhels.
                  
                  
                     Another example.
                     If ten reapers reape 15. Acres in 7. dayes, in how many daies
ſhall 16. reapers reape 20. Acres: Here frame your firſt queſtion
thus, if 10. reapers require 7. daies, how many daies ſhall 16.
reapers require, which queſtion muſt be wrought by the rule Reuerſe,
and ſo you ſhall finde 4. daies and ⅜. of a day which is 9.

houres, then ſay, if 15. Acres require 4. daies and ⅜. of a day, how
many daies ſhall 20. Acres require, and in working this ſecond
queſtion by the common rule of 3. belonging of Fractions as is
before taught, you ſhall finde that 20. Acres wil require 5. daies
and 10/12. or ⅚. of a day which is 20 houres. But it were more eaſie
in this ſecond queſtion to reduce the daies into houres by Multiplying
the 4. daies by 24. houres, the product whereof wil be 96.
houres, whereunto if you adde the od 9. houres it will make in all
105. houres, which being Multiplyed by the third number of this
ſecond queſtion, which is 20. the product ſhall be 2100. houres,
which diuided by the firſt number of the ſaid queſtion which is 15.
you ſhall finde in the quotient 140. houres, which if you diuide againe
by 24. you ſhall finde in the quotient 5. daies, and the remainder
to be 20. houres, which agréeth in all pointes with the
firſt manner of working by Fractions, and is the eaſier way of
the two.
                     How ſhall I know hauing to worke by this Double rule,
when to vſe the rule reuerſe?
                     By conſidering whether the third number requireth more or
leſſe of time, or of any other meaſure or quantitie, as in the former
example, of Bayes for lining, the more breadth it had, the
leſſe did ſerue for lining. Againe in the example of the gaine by
yeares, of 6. l. and 3. l. you did ſée that 3. l. require more yeares
then 6. l. and therefore that firſt queſtion was wrought by the rule
reuerſe: Alſo in this laſt example of ye reapers, the more reapers,
the leſſe time they require, & therefore that queſtion was wrought
by the rule reuerſe.

Cap. 12.
                  
                     WHat doth this rule teach?
                  To knowe the gaine or loſſe of ſuch as doe
make a ſtocke and doe occupie together in the
trade of Marchandize: As for example, foure
Marchants did put their mony in lot in this manner.

The firſt brought 30. Crownes, the ſecond 50. the third 60
and the fourth 100. and with theſe portions they gained 3000.
Crownes, the queſtion is how much euery one ſhall haue to his
ſhare of that gaine according to the portion which he brought. To
know this, you muſt firſt gather all the ſeuerall portions together
by Addition into one Somme, and you ſhall finde the ſomme
of the portions to be 240. Crownes, then ſay if 240. Crownes
do gaine 3000. Crownes, what ſhall 30. gaine, and after this
manner worke by the common rule of 3. with all the reſt of the
portions, and ſo you ſhall finde that he which brought 30. ought
to haue 375. Crownes, and hee that brought 50. ought to haue
625. Crownes, and hee that brought 60. ought to haue 750.
Crownes, and he that brought 100. ought to haue 1250. which
maketh in all 3000. Crownes, for that is the very Somme of the
gaine before ſet downe, the order of working whereof, this figure
plainely ſheweth.
                  
                     
                        
                           240.—
                           3000.—
                           30.—

                     A like example of loſſe receiued by Shipwracke.
                     Thrée Marchants doe venture their goods in one Shippe, the
goods of the firſt were worth 300. Crownes, the ſecond 400.
the third 500. there were as much goods caſt out as was worth
100. Crownes, the queſtion is how much euery one ſhould looſe
according to his portion, here worke as before, and you ſhall finde
that euery one ſhall looſe ſo much as this figure following ſheweth.
                     
                        
                           
                              1200.—

                              400.—

Here to know whether the 3. ſeuerall loſſes doe make vp the
generall loſſe, do thus, firſt adde the Integrums of the ſeuerall
loſſes together, the Somme whereof will bee 99. whereunto if
you adde the 2. Fractions which doe make one whole Crowne,
the Somme will be 100. a number like vnto the generall loſſe.
                  
                  
                     Another example.
                     Thrée Marchants haue bought 1000. l. of Pepper for 300.
crownes, the firſt taketh 200. l. the ſecond 350. l. and the third
450. l. what ſhal euery man pay according to the portion which he
hath receiued, then ſay if 1000. l. be worth 300. Crownes, what
is 200. l. worth, here working by the common rule of 3. with
euery mans ſeuerall portion receiued, you ſhall finde that the firſt
muſt pay 60. Crownes, the ſecond 105. and the third 135.
Crownes, as this figure here following ſheweth.

                     Another like example of diuerſe diſtance of time.
                     Thrée Marchaunts occupying together did gaine 2345.
Crownes, the firſt put in 40. Crownes for the ſpace of 14. Moneths,
the ſecond put in 50. Crownes for the ſpace of 8. Moneths,
and the third put in 85. Crownes for the ſpace of 6. Moneths, the
queſtion is, how much euery one ſhall haue after the rate of his
mony, and according of the quantitie of time: This is to bée
wrought according to the rule of Fellowſhip thus, Multiply euery
mans mony by his time, either of which, that is to ſay, the mony
and the time muſt be of one ſelfe denomination, then adde the
Sommes of thoſe ſeuerall portions together, and the total ſomme
of ſuch Addition ſhall be the firſt number, and the common gaine
ſhall be the ſecond number, and the third number ſhall bee euery
mans mony Multiplyed by his time, then in working by the
common rule of 3. you ſhall finde that euery man ſhall haue ſuch
ſhare as this figure here following ſheweth.
                     
                        
                        
                           
                              1470.—
                              2345.—
                              560.—
                              893. ⅓
                           
                           
                              400.—
                              638. 2/21.
                           
                           
                              510.—
                              813. 4/7
                           
                           
                              The common Diuiſor
which is the
totall Somme of
the ſeuerall portions
of mony added
together.
                              the general
Somme of
the gaine.
                              the particular
portions of
the mony multiplyed
by his
time.
                              euery
mans
ſingle
ſhare.
                           
                        
                     
                     Now if you would know whether the ſingle ſhares in this example
doe make vp the generall Somme of the gaine, then adde
together the Integrums or whole Sommes of euery mans ſingle
ſhare, and you ſhall finde the Somme to bee but 2344. which
wanteth one whole Integrum of the ſecond or middle number of
the queſtion, which you ſhal eaſily ſupply by adding the 3. ſeueral
Fractions together according to the rule of Addition of Fractions
before taught, for ſo ſhall you finde the ſaid 3. Fractions to
make in all one whole Integrum, which being added to 2344.
will be aunſwerable to the ſecond number of the queſtion, which
as you ſée in the example is 2345. And remember in adding together
the ſaid 3. Fractions, to ſet them in this order ⅓ / 2/21 / 4/7. and
then to bring them to one ſelfe denomination, as the ſeuenth rule
of Fractions teacheth you. But firſt becauſe you ſhal find ye 3. remainders
after the firſt 3. Diuiſor of the 3. ſeuerall portions,
made by the firſt common Diuiſor of the queſtion to be written in
many figures, you muſt ſet them downe in fewer figures according
as the fift rule of Fractions teacheth you, ſo ſhall you finde
the firſt remainder containing 490/1470. to be no more but ⅓. and the
ſecond remainder containing 140/1470. to be 2/21. and the third remainder
containing 840/1470. to be 4/7. which 3. Fractions being added together
according to the ſeuenth rule of Fractions, wil make 441/441.
which is one whole Integrum and muſt be added by the name of 1
to the middle or ſecond number of the queſtion, as I haue ſaid before:
you may alſo make up the foreſaid number by ſéeking to
knowe the value of euery Fraction annexed to the Integrums,
according as the ſixt rule of Fractions teacheth, for ſo ſhall you
finde the value of the firſt Fraction to be fiue groats, & the value
of the ſecond Fractiō to be one groat 6. farthings, and 18/21. of a farthing

thing, & you ſhal find the value of ye third Fraction to be 8. groats
9. farthings and ½. of a farthing, & if you adde 18/2
                           •
                         & 1/7 of a farthing
together, you ſhall find that it will make 147/147. which is one whole
Integrum or one whole farthing. Now if you adde 6. 9. and 1. farthings
together, it wil make in al 16. farthings, and yt is one groat
which being added to ye 14 groats before found out, will make in al
15. groats which is one Crowne, and yt being added to the Somme
2344. will make it 2345. Crownes, which is a number agreeable
to the middle Somme of the queſtion. Truely if you exerciſe
your ſelfe in this and ſuch like queſtions, it will make you perfect
not onely in Addition, Subtraction, Multiplycation, and Diuiſion
of whole numbers, but alſo of Fractions, and almoſt in al
the other rules belonging as wel to Fractions, as to Integrums:
Wherefore I would wiſh you often to vſe your penne therein.
                     Hauing hitherto treated of the 4. ſpeciall kinds of Arithmetike,
that is of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplycation and Diuiſion,
as well belonging to whole numbers, as to Fractions,
and alſo ſhewed the vſe of the Golden rule, otherwiſe called the
rule of 3. and of all the thrée kindes thereof, that is the common
rule, the rule Reuerſe, and the Double rule, and giuen examples
how and when euery one is to be vſed, together with the rule of
Fellowſhip, neceſſarie for them that vſe any trade of Marchandize,
I thinke good now to ſpeake ſomewhat of Arithmeticall and
Geometricall progreſſion, and alſo of Proportion, and of the thrée
kinds thereof, that is Arithmeticall, Geometricall, and Muſicall
proportion, and then of the extraction of rootes both ſquare
and Cubicall, and laſt of all, of Aſtronomicall Fractions, ſhewing
how they are to be added, Subtracted, Multiplyed & diuided.
                  
               
               
                  Of Progreſsion and how manifold
it is.
Cap. 13.
                  
                     WHat is Progreſsion?
                  It is a certaine order of procéeding with diuerſe
numbers in ſuch ſorte as euery one may excéede each
other, either by like difference of quantitie, or elſe by

likeneſſe of Proportion, whereof ſpringeth 2. kinds of Progreſſion,
the one called Arithemeticall, and the other Geometricall.
                  What is Arithmeticall Progreſsion?
                  It is that which procéedeth by like difference of quantitie, as
thus, 3. 5. 7. 9. 11. 13. whereof euery one excéedeth his fellow by
the difference of 2.
                  What is Progreſsion Geometricall?
                  It is that wherein euery number excéedeth his fellow by like
proportion, for as 6. containeth 3. twiſe, ſo doth 12. containe
6. twiſe, &c.
               
               
                  Of Addition belonging to
Progreſsion Arithmeticall.

                     HOwe are numbers being ſet in order according
to Progreſsion Arithmeticall,
to be added together and to be reduced
into one totall ſomme?
                  Thus, firſt ſée how many ſeuerall numbers
there be in all, and note the Somme
by it ſelfe, then adde the firſt number of the
Progreſſion to the laſt thereof, and note
that Somme by it ſelfe, that done, Multiply the one of theſe 2.
reſerued Sommes by the one halfe of the other, and you ſhall
haue the totall Somme. As for example let this be your Progreſſion
6. 10. 14/18/22/26/30/34/ wherein euery number excéedeth
his fellow by the difference of 4. here hauing tolde the numbers,
I finde them to be 8. which I ſet downe by it ſelfe, then I adde 6.
which is the firſt number to 34. which is the laſt, and the Somme
thereof is 40. which I alſo ſet downe by it ſelfe, then in Multiplying
40. by 4. which is the one halfe of 8. before ſet downe a part
by it ſelfe, I finde the totall Somme of the Progreſſion to
be 160.
               
               
                  
                  Of Addition belonging to progreſsion
Geometricall.
Cap. 15.
                  
                     HOw are numbers being ſet in order according
to progreſsion Geometricall, to
be added and to bee brought into one
Somme?
                  Thus, Multiply the laſt Somme of the
progreſſion by the number of the proportiō
whereby ſuch progreſſion procéedeth, and
from the product of that Multiplycation,
Subtract the firſt number of the progreſſion, that done, diuide that
which remaineth by a number which is leſſe then the proportion
by one, and the quotient of ſuch Diuiſion ſhall ſhew you the totall
Somme of the ſaid progreſſion. As for example, let this bee the
progreſſion 2. 6. 18. 54. 162. 486. 1458. the proportion of which
progreſſion is tryple, wherefore according to the rule, I Multiply
the laſt number of the progreſſion by 3. and the product of ſuch
Multiplycation amounteth to 4/374. out of which Somme I
Subtract the firſt number which is 2. and there remaineth 4372.
which I diuide by 2. (for it is leſſe then be proportion 3. by 1.) and
ſo I finde in the quotient 2186. which is the totall Somme of the
progreſſion Geometricall.
                  Is there no brieffer way of adding ſuch kinds of progreſsion?
                  Yes indéede, but not ſo plaine as this way is, and therefore I
thinke not good to trouble your memorie therewith.

Cap. 16.
                  
                     WHat is Proportion?
                  Proportion is taken generally for the comparing
of 2. diuerſe quantities or numbers together,
ſhewing what likenes is betwixt them. But before

we deale with Proportion, and with the 3. kinds thereof, that is
Proportion Arithmeticall, Geometricall, and Muſicall: You haue
firſt to vnderſtand, that of numbers ſome are ſaid to be abſtract,
and ſome concreate.
                  The abſtract are ſuch as are not tyed to any denomination, and
ſuch are twofold, that is abſolute and relatiue.
                  The abſolute, are ſimply pronounced without hauing any relation
to any other number, meaſure, or quantitie, as 2. 3. 4. &c.
and all numbers whatſoeuer, that are without denomination and
are not attributed to any other thing.
                  The relatiue are thoſe which haue relation one to another,
which may be thrée manner of waies. Firſt in reſpect of difference
which is found by Subtraction, ſecondly in reſpect of the quotient
found by Diuiſion, thirdly in reſpect of both. Of the firſt way
ſpringeth Arithmeticall proportion: Of the ſecond way Geometricall
proportion: And of the third Muſicall proportion.
               
               
                  Cap. 17.
                  
                     WHat is Arithmeticall proportion?
                  Arithmeticall proportion vnproperly
ſo called, (becauſe it is no proportion indéed)
is when many ſeuerall numbers haue
one ſelfe and like difference, as 8. 12. 16.
which doe onely differ one from another
by 4. and this Proportion is twofold, that
is continual and diſiunct.
                  Continuall is when many numbers procéede with like difference,
as hath bene ſaid before whē we ſpake of Arithmeticall Progreſſion,
as 8. 12. 16. 20. &c. whoſe difference betwixt euery 2.
numbers is 4.
                  The Diſiunct, is when many numbers being ſeuerally propounded,
the difference of the firſt 2. numbers is not like to the
difference that is betwixt the ſecond and the third, and ſo forth as
5. 8. 4. 7. for 8. differeth from 5. by 3. and 4. from 8. by 4. and 7.
from 4. by 3. Now of the ſecond way of comparing which is done
by Diuiſion, ſpringeth as hath beene ſaid before, Geometricall
proportion.
               
               
                  
                  Cap. 18.
                  
                     WHat is Geometricall proportion?
                  Geometricall proportion is that which
ſheweth what part or parts one number is of
another number, as 3. is the halfe of 6. which
proportion is found by Diuiſion, wherein
you haue to note that if the Diuiſor be greater
then the diuidend, then it is to be made
a Fraction, as in the former example, if you would diuide 3. by 6.
then you muſt make it a Fraction thus, 3/6. or ½, and this kinde of
proportion which may be truely and properly called a proportion
indéed or rather a proportionalitie, is ſaid to be twofold, that is,
direct, and reuerſe, and the direct is either Coniunct, or Diſiunct
                  Coniunct differeth not from Geometricall Progreſſion before
taught.
                  Diſiunct proportion Geometricall, conſiſting moſt commonly
of 4. numbers or of 3. at the leaſt, is when there is not like proportion
betwixt the ſecond and the third, that is betwixt the firſt and
the ſecond, or betwixt the third and the fourth, as 3. 6. 4. 8. for
here 6. containeth 4. once, and one halfe thereof, which is called
Proportio Seſquialtera, and 6. containeth 3. twiſe, which is called
Proportio dupla: and ſo is 8. to 4.
               
               
                  Cap. 19.
                  
                     AGaine, proportion Reuerſe differeth not
from the rule of 3. called Regula euerſa.
But you haue to vnderſtand that the two
chéefe and ſpeciall kinds of Geometricall
proportion, are theſe, that is, proportion of
equalitie, and proportion of inequalitie.
                  Proportion of equalitie, is when 2.
numbers compared togethtr, are equall
the one to the other, as 3. to 3. 4. to 4.
                  The proportion of inequalitie, is when 2. vnequal numbers are
compared together, as 6. to 5, 4. to 9. and of this there are two

kinds, that is proportion of the greater inequalitie, and proportion
of leſſer inequalitie.
               
               
                  Cap. 20.
                  
                     PRoportion of the greater inequalitie, is when the
greater number is compared to the leſſer numbers, as
6. to 5.
                  Proportion of the leſſer inequality, is whē the leſſer
is compared to the greater, as 5. to 6.
                  
                     Of proportion of the greater inequalitie there be
two kindes, Simplex and Multiplex,
that is to ſay, ſimple and manifold.
                     SImplex, is when the Antecedent, that is to ſay the former number
containeth the conſequent, that is to ſay the latter number
once and ſomewhat more, which ouerplus muſt alwaies bee leſſe
then the conſequent it ſelfe, as 5. containeth 4. once and one parte
thereof more, for if you diuide 5. by 4. the quotient will be 1. and
¼ ouer. Againe, this proportion is twofold, that is Superparticuler,
and Superpartient: Superparticular, is when the Antecedent
containeth the conſequent once and ſome one part thereof, as
3. to 2. for 3. containeth 2. once and one halfe thereof, which is
called Seſquialtera, or as 4. to 3. for 4. containeth 3. once and
one third part thereof, and is called Seſquitertia, the like is to be
ſaid of Seſquiquarta, Seſquiquinta, Seſquiſexta, and ſo forth infinitely
as this Table ſheweth.

                     PRoportion of the leſſer inequalitie, is
when the Antecedent is leſſe then the conſequent,
as 2. to 3. 5. to 7. for if you diuide
2. by 3. the quotient is ⅔. if 5. by 7.
then the quotient is 5/7 and this Proportion
hath the ſame names which the Proportion
of the greate inequalitie hath, ſauing
that you muſt adde to the beginning of
euery name, this word Sub. as Subdupla,
Subtripla, Subſeſquialtera, &c. as 1 to 2 is Subdupla proportio,
3. to 9. is Subtripla proportio, &c.
                  
               
               
                  Of Muſicall proportion called in
Latine Harmoniaca proportio.
Cap. 22.
                  
                     Muſical proportion which requireth 3. numbers
at the leaſt, is when the firſt number
hath the ſame proportion vnto the third,
which the difference betwixt the firſt and
the ſecond, hath to the difference which is
betwixt the ſecond and the third, as 3. 4.
and 6. for looke what proportion 3. hath to
6. which is Subdupla, the ſame hath the
difference betwixt 3. and 4. which is 1. to
the difference betwixt 4. and 6. which is 2. for 1. to 2. is Subdupla,
and this is called Muſicall proportion, becauſe the numbers
therein haue the ſame proportions one to another, which are
found to be in Muſicall conſorts, as 6. 4. and 3. for the proportion
which 6. hath to 4. is Seſquialtera, called of the Muſitians Diapente,
or a fift, and the proportion which 4. hath to 3. is Seſquitertia,
called of the Muſitians Diateſſeron, or a fourth, and the

proportion which 6. hath to 3. is Dupla, called a Diapaſon, or an
Eight, and of this Muſicall proportion there be two kinds, that is
ſimple and compound.
                  It is ſaid to be ſimple when it conſiſteth onely of 3. numbers.
                  And it is called compound when it conſiſteth of more then 3.
numbers: And of compound there be 2. kinds, that is vnproper
and proper.
                  The vnproper is, when to 3. numbers giuen, 2. other ſeueral
numbers are ioyned, which doe containe the ſame proportions
with the third, which the firſt 3. numbers haue one to another: As
for example, let be giuen theſe 3. numbers, 3. 4. 6. vnto which if
you ioyne 8. and 12. here 6. 8. 12. haue the ſame proportion one
to another which 3. 4. and 6. haue amongſt themſelues, for like
as here betwixt 6. and 8. the proportion is Subſeſquitertia, and
betwixt 6. and 12. it is Subdupla, and betwixt 8. and 12. it is
Subſeſquialtera, ſo betwixt 3. and 4. is Subſeſquitertia, and betwixt
3. and 6. is Subdupla, and betwixt 4. and 6. is Subſeſquialtera,
                  
                  Compound proper, is when diuerſe numbers in Muſicall proportion
ſtanding together, and the firſt being omitted, the 3. next
doe continue ſtill in Muſicall proportion. Alſo when omitting the
2. firſt numbers the 3. next following are in Muſicall proportion.
And when omitting the firſt 3. the next 3. are in Muſicall proportion,
and ſo forth how many numbers ſo euer there be: As for example
10. 12. 15. 20. 30. theſe are numbers belonging to the
proper kind of compound Muſical proportion, for 10. 12. and 15.
are in Muſicall proportion, then omitting 10. which is the firſt
number, 12. 15. and 20 are ſtill in Muſicall proportion, and
if you omit the 2. firſt numbers, that is 10 and 12. then the next
3. that is 15. 20. and 30. are ſtill in Muſicall proportion, and ſo
forth how many ſo euer there be of them, ſo as they be in Muſicall
proportion: But our Muſitians doe make no more but 8. Muſicall
proportions in all, that is.

                  Cap. 23.
                  
                     But now becauſe it is not inough to knowe
the foreſaid proportions and their names,
vnleſſe you can both adde, Subtract, Multiply,
and diuide them when néede is, I
will therefore briefly here ſet downe the
order thereof, and firſt ſhewe how to ſet
them downe in writing, and then how they
are to be added, Subtracted, Multiplyed,
and diuided.
                  They are to be ſet downe in writing in like manner that Fractions
are wont to be ſet downe, ſauing that as in Fractions the
vpper number is called Numerator, and the inferior number Denominator,
ſo in proportions the vpper number is called Antecedent,
and the inferior number Conſequent, but whereas in Fractiōs,
ther is wont to be drawn a litle line betwixt the Numerator
and the Denominator, in proportions no line is drawne betwixt
the Antecedent and the Conſequent, but the Antecedent is ſet ouer
the Conſequent, without any line drawne betwixt them thus.

                        
                           3.
                           4.
                           2.
                        
                        
                           5.
                           7.
                           1.
                        
                     
                  
                  And looke as Fractions are to be written in as fewe
figures as may be, ſo are proportions to be ſet downe in
ſo ſmall numbers as may be, which is to be done by the
ſelf ſame rule that Fractions are. Againe as you can neither adde
nor Subtract Fractions, hauing diuerſe denominations, before
that you haue brought them to one ſelfe denomination: So can
you neither adde nor ſubtract proportions hauing diuerſe conſequents,
vntill you haue brought them to one ſelfe conſequent by

the ſame rule that Fractions are reduced to one ſelfe denomination:
And looke what order is to be obſerued in adding, ſubtracting,
multiplying and diuiding of Fractions, the ſame is to be kept in
adding, ſubtracting, multiplying and diuiding of proportions.
Wherefore I wholly referre you to the rules of Fractions before
moſt plainly taught. And thus I end with proportions, the knowledge
wherof is very neceſſarie to ſuch as haue to deale in matters
either of Geometry or of Aſtronomie or with Muſicke.
               
               
                  How to finde out the ſquare roote
of any number.
Cap. 24.
                  
                     WHat is a ſquare roote?
                  It is any Digit or any other number, which being
multiplyed into it ſelf bringeth forth a ſquare
number, as 4. being multiplyed in it ſelfe, in ſaying
4. times 4. maketh 16. which is a ſquare number,
the roote whereof is 4. And to finde out the
ſquare roote of any number be it ſquare or not ſquare, you muſt doe
thus. Firſt hauing ſet downe the number propounded which muſt
conſiſt of 3. figures at the leaſt, ſet a pricke vnder the firſt Digit or
Cypher of the ſaid number on the right hand, that done, pricke
euery other figure thereof towards the left hand, leauing alwaies
one voide ſpace betwixt euery 2. pricks as you ſée here done in this
number 4 
                     7 
                     5. 6. 4. 5. and looke how many prickes there be, ſo many figures
ſhall you haue in the quotient, and this differeth nothing in
a manner from Diuiſion, the order in working is thus, firſt ſéeke
out a Digit, which being multiplyed in it ſelfe, may take away
that which ſtandeth ouer the laſt pricke on the left hand, or as much
thereof as may be, and ſet the Digit in the quotient, that done, double
the ſaid quotient, then conſider whether the double doe conſiſt
of one figure or of many, if of one onely, then place that in the next
voide ſpace on the right hand, but if the double doe conſiſt of many
figures, then take the firſt figure thereof, that is to ſay, that figure

or cipher which ſtandeth in the firſt place of the double, and place
that in the foreſaide next voide ſpace towards the right hand, and
next to that, place all the reſt of the figures of the ſayd double orderly
towardes the left hand, that done, ſéeke another Digit, which
being multiplyed in it ſelfe together with the doubled number, may
take away all that which ſtandeth right ouer it, or as much thereof
as may be, which Digit you muſt not onely put in the quotient to
his fellow, but alſo ſet downe the ſame right vnder the next pricke
on the right hand, and then multiply that Digit together with the
double whereto it is ioyned, by the ſaid laſt found Digit ſet downe
in the quotient, the product whereof you muſt ſubtract out of the
vpper number, ſtanding right ouer the foreſaid pricke, and if there
be any remainder, write it aboue, cancelling the other, and looke
how many pricks ther be, ſo many times muſt you double the quotient,
obſeruing alwaies like order of working as before, which
you ſhall more plainely vnderſtand by theſe examples following,
and for your better vnderſtanding thereof, I will firſt giue you an
example of 3. figures onely as thus, 464. here to finde out the
ſquare roote of this number, you muſt firſt pricke the ſaid number
in ſuch order as is before taught, and then ſéeke out ſome one of
the 9. Digits, which being multiplyed in it ſelfe, may take away
the firſt 4. on the left hand, or as much thereof as may be, which you
ſhall finde to be 2. which 2. being ſet in the quotient, multiply the
ſame in it ſelfe, in ſaying 2. times 2. maketh 4. which 4. doth
cleane take away the firſt 4. ſtanding ouer the laſt pricke on the
left hand, and therefore cancell the 4. that done, double the quotient
which maketh 4. and ſet the ſame in the next voide ſpace on the
right hand vnder the figure 6. thus.
                  And then ſéeke out ſome Digit, which being multiplyed

                        〈 math 〉
                     
in it ſelfe together with the doubled, may take
away the Somme of 64. that remaineth, which by aſking
how many times 4. is comprehended in 6. you ſhall finde to
be but one, which you muſt not onely put in the quotient, but alſo
ſet it downe vnder the firſt pricke on the right hand thus.
                  So as you ſhall make the lower Somme to be 41.

                        〈 math 〉
                     
which is to be multiplyed by the laſt found quotient
which is 1. wherefore you muſt ſay that 1. times 41.
is 41 which being taken out of 64. there remaineth 23. ſo as the

roote is 21. and the remainder 23. as this example ſheweth.
                  
                     〈 math 〉
                  
                  And to know whether you haue done well or not,
multiply the quotient in it ſelfe, and if there be any
remainder left, adde that vnto the product of the
multiplyed quotient, and if you finde the ſumme thereof to be like
to the firſt, then you haue done well, if it be not like, then you haue
erred, the product of this quotient being multiplyed in it ſelfe amounteth
vnto 441. whereto by adding the remainder which is
23. you ſhall finde the ſumme to be like vnto the firſt number that
is 464. whereof you ſought the ſquare roote. But if ſuch number
do conſiſt of many figures, then in working you muſt double the
quotient once, twice or thrice, according as the number doth require,
as you ſhall more plainely perceiue by this example following:
as let 50/467. be the number whereof you would know the
ſquare roote, here hauing pricked this number in ſuch order as before,
firſt ſéeke out ſome Digit which being multiplyed in it ſelfe
may take away the Digit or number ſtanding right ouer the laſt
pricke on the left hand, which you ſhall finde to be 2. and hauing
ſet downe the ſaide 2. in the quotient, ſaye 2. times 2. maketh 4.
which being ſubtracted from 5. there remaineth 1. which you
muſt ſet ouer 5. and cancell the ſayde 5. as this example ſheweth.
                  That done, double the quotient which maketh

                        〈 math 〉
                     
4. and ſet downe the 4. in the next ſpace towardes
the right hand, vnder the cipher as you ſée in the
former example, then ſéeke out a Digit, which being multiplyed
in it ſelfe together with the double quotient, may take away all
that which ſtandeth ouer the ſecond pricke towards the left hand,
or as much thereof as may be, which Digit by aſking how many
times 4. is comprehended in 10. you ſhall finde to be 2. then ſet
downe the ſaide 2. not onely in the quotient, but alſo vnder the
ſecond pricke towardes the right hande, which together with the
former 4. maketh 42. as you ſée in this example.
                  
                     〈 math 〉
                  
                  Then multiply that 42. in a place by it ſelfe
by the figure 2. laſt ſet downe in the quotient,
and it will make 84. which 84. being taken out
of 104. there remaineth 20 which you muſt ſet
ouer the ſecond pricke and cancell the 104. and alſo the 42. beneath,

as you ſée in the former example: that done, double the whole
quotient, which maketh 44. wherof ſet the firſt 4. in the next voide
ſpace towards the right hand vnder the figure 6. and the other 4.
vnder the ſecond pricke towards the left hand, thē aſke how many
times 4. is comprehended in 20. and you ſhall find 4. which you
muſt not onely ſet downe in the quotient, but alſo vnder the next
and laſt pricke on the right hand, and ſo the nether Summe ſhall
be 444. which being multiplyed by the Digit 4. laſt ſet down in ye
quotient, will make in all 1776. which being taken out of the vpper
number which is 2067. there will remaine 291. ſo as the ſquare
roote of the firſt number is 224. and the remainder 291. as you
may ſée in this example.
                  
                     〈 math 〉
                  
                  The ſquare roote whereof being multiplyed
in it ſelf amounteth vnto 50176. wherto
if you adde the remainder which is 291.
the Summe thereof will bee like vnto the
firſt number which is 50467. Moreouer you
haue to note that if you finde any number out
of the which your quotient being doubled cā
                     not
be ſubtracted, then you muſt ſet downe a
Cypher in the quotient, and procéede to the next pricke on your
right hand, as in this example following.

                        〈 math 〉
                     
                  
                  In which example the firſt found Digit ſet in
the quotient is 6. which being multiplyed in it ſelfe
maketh 36. and cleane taketh away the firſt number
ſtanding ouer the laſt pricke on the left hand, that done, I double
the quotient, which maketh 12 and I place the 2. in the next voide

                  Ouer which 12. there is but 6. remaining, ſo
as I can not take 12. out of 6. and therefore I
cancell the 12. and ſet down a Cypher in the quotient,
ſo as the quotient is now 60. which being doubled maketh
120. the Cypher whereof I ſet downe in the next voide ſpace towards
the right hand, and the other two Digits orderly towards
the left hand, as you ſée in this example.

                     Then I aſke how many times one is contained
in 6, and I finde 5. which I ſet downe in the
quotient and alſo vnder the laſt pricke on the right
hand, ſo as the nether number is 1205. which I
multiply aparte by it ſelfe by the 5. laſt ſet downe in the quotient,
the product whereof is 6025. which being taken out of the vpper
number, which is alſo 6025. there remaineth nothing, as this

to be a iuſt ſquare number, the roote wherof
is 605. which being multiplyed in it ſelfe
maketh 366025. a number like vnto the firſt number.
               
               
                  The vſe of the ſquare roote in
ſetting of battels.
Cap. 25.
                  
                     THe knowledge of finding out the ſquare
roote of any number, is very neceſſary for
a Sargent maior in the fielde, that he may
the more readily ſet and range his Squadrans
of Battel: And therefore I thinke it
not amiſſe, to giue them here certaine examples
of ſuch manner of ſquares as the
Italians were wont to vſe in my time,
which is foure manner of waies.
                  Whereof the firſt teacheth how to ſet the Battel ſquare of
ground, the ſecond a ſquare battel of men, the third a long ſquare
battel which we call the Hearſe battel, and the fourth teacheth
how to ſet a battel of ſo much and a third.
                  Shew by what rules theſe battels are to be ſet?
                  Before I ſet downe any rules you haue to vnderſtand that all
numbers giuen or ſuppoſed, are not méete for ſuch purpoſe, but
onely ſuch as may be diuided into 3. equall parts without leauing
any remainder: for otherwiſe all the rules following, take no

place, and therefore when any number is giuen you to be brought
into any one of the foreſaid 4. formes of battell, you ſhall doe well
firſt to deuide that number by 3. and if there be any remainder, to
reiect it, and to take the reſt for your number, As for example, A
Sargent Maior is commanded by his Generall to ſet a battaile
ſquare of ground, appointing him thereunto 1345. men, here
the Sargent by diuiding that number by 3. findeth in the remainder
one man too many, which being onely reiected, all the reſt of
the number which is 1344. is fitte for his purpoſe.
                  
                     How to ſet a battell ſquare of ground, called
in Italian Battaglia quadra di
terreno.
                     NOw ſhew the order of ſetting ſuch kinds of battell?
                     The order is thus, firſt double the number giuen, then take
the ſquare roote thereof, and that roote ſhall be the Front, that
done, diuide the number giuen by the ſaid roote, and the number
in the quotient ſhall be the flanke, now if you multiply the front
and the flanke the one into the other, you ſhall haue your whole
number firſt giuen, vnleſſe there be ſome remainder left in the
former Diuiſion, which remainder muſt be added to the product
to make vp the ſomme. But if you woulde know how many men
are to be put in a rancke, and alſo how many ſuch ranckes you muſt
haue, then diuide the front into 3. partes, and the quotient will
ſhew you how many men you are to haue in a rancke, that done,
multiply the flancke by 3. and the product thereof ſhall be the number
of the ranckes: As for example, take the number before giuen,
which was 1345. which being diuided by 3. you finde the remainder
to be 1. which you muſt reiect, and take all the reſt which is
1344. and that being doubled maketh 2688. the ſquare roote
whereof is 51. by which roote you muſt diuide the number giuen,
Videlicet 1344. and the quotient will be 26. which ſhall be the
flancke, now if you diuide the foreſaid front 51. by 3. the quotient
will ſhew how many ſhall be in a rancke, that is 17. Finally, if you
multiply the flancke, which is 26. by 3. the product thereof will
be 78. which is the iuſt number of the rancks which you muſt
haue.
                  
                  
                     
                     How to ſet a battell ſquare of men called in Italian
Battaglia quadra d'huomini.
                     TAke the ſquare roote of the number giuen, and that ſhall bee
both the front and the flancke, which if you multiply together,
the product thereof will make vp the number firſt giuen, and if
you would know how many men are to bee put in a rancke, and
how many ſuch rancks you muſt haue, then doe as you did before
in diuiding the front by 3. and multiplying the flancke by 3.
                  
                  
                     How to ſet a long ſquare battell which we call
the Hearſe battel, and is called in Italian,
Battaglia dun tanto emezzo.
                     TO the number giuen, adde the iuſt halfe therof, and the ſquare
roote of that Somme ſhall be the front, by which roote, or front
you diuide the firſt number giuen, the quotient ſhall be the flancke.
As for example, let the number giuen be 6144. the halfe thereof is
3072. which being added to the giuen number 6144. maketh
in all 9/216. the ſquare roote whereof is 96. which ſhall bee the
front, by which roote or front if you diuide the giuen number
6144. you ſhall finde in the quotient 64. and that ſhall bee the
flancke, that done, diuide the foreſaide front 96. by 3. and you
ſhall finde in the quotient 32. which number ſheweth how many
men ſhall be in a rancke, then multiply the foreſaid flancke 64. by
3. and the product thereof ſhall bee 192. which is the number of
the ranckes.
                  
                  
                     How to ſet a battell of ſo much and a third,
called in Italian, Battaglia dun tanto
& dun terzo.
                     TO the number giuen, adde the third part thereof and the ſquare
roote of that Somme ſhall be the front, then diuide the firſt
number giuen by the foreſaid roote or front, and the number in the
quotient ſhall be the flancke: As for example, let the number giuen
be 1575. the third part whereof is 525. which being added
to 1575. maketh in all 2100. the roote whereof is 45 which muſt
be the front, by which roote or front, if you diuide the number giuen
which was 1575. the quotient will be 35. which ſhall be your

flancke, then by diuiding 45. which is the front by 3. the quotient
wil ſhew you how many men you muſt haue in a rancke that is 15.
Againe by multiplying the flancke which is 35. by 3. the product
thereof will be 105. which is the number of your ranckes.
                  
               
               
                  How to finde out the Cubique
roote of any number.
Cap. 26.
                  
                     AS the ſquare roote is ſaid to bee a number
which being multiplyed in it ſelfe, doth
make a ſquare ſuperficiall number, hauing
onely length and breadth, ſo as the
Cubique roote is a number which being
firſt multiplyed in it ſelfe, and the product
therof being againe multiplyed by the firſt
number, doth make a Cubique or Corporall
number hauing both length breadth, and depth: As for
example, 2. times 2. maketh 4. and 2. times 4. maketh 8. Againe
3. times 3. maketh 9. and 3. times 9. maketh 27. and ſo you
may deale with all the reſt of the 9. Digits, and make thereby a
Table containing both the ſquare numbers and Cubique numbers
of euery roote, conſiſting of any one of the 9. Digits, like vnto

                  Then hauing to finde out
the Cubique roote of any number
that is greater then 1000.
(for leſſer it cannot be to worke
vpon) then ſet a pricke vnder
the firſt figure on your right
hand, and ſo procéede towards
the left hand, omitting alwaies
2. figures betwixt euery two
prickes, as in this example
41063625. and looke howe

many prickes there be, ſo many figures ſhall you haue in the quotient:
That done, you haue to finde out thrée ſeuerall numbers,
firſt ſuch a Cubique number as will cleane take away the number
which ſtandeth right ouer the head of the laſt pricke on the left
hand, or ſo much thereof as may be, which you may eaſily finde in
the foreſaid table: The roote of which Cubique number, you muſt
ſet downe in the quotient, the ſecond number which you haue to
find is a number called the Triple, which is eaſily had by tripling
the quotient, and the third number is called the Diuiſor which you
ſhall moſt readily finde by multiplying the quotient into the Triple,
both which numbers are to be placed in ſuch order as followeth.
Firſt then hauing found the Cubique number as is before
ſaid, and taken the ſame out of the number ſtanding ouer the laſt
pricke on the left hand, write the remainder (if there be any) ouer
his head, cancelling that which is vnder it, and then place the
roote of the ſaid Cubique number in the quotient: that done, Triple
the roote ſet downe in the quotient, and that ſhall be the Triple
which you muſt place in the ſecond voide ſpace on the left ſide of
the next pricke which is on your right hand, then multiply that
Triple by the quotient, and the product thereof ſhall be the Diuiſor
which muſt be placed right vnder the Triple one figure ſhorter
towards the left hand: that done, drawe a line as you ſée in the
example hereafter following and worke thus: Firſt aſke how many
times the firſt figure of the ſaid Diuiſor is contained in the
number ſtanding right ouer his head: and hauing found an apt
Digit for the purpoſe, put that Digit in the quotient to his fellow,
that done, multiply the ſaid Digit into the Diuiſor and ſet the
product thereof right vnder the Diuiſor: Secondly multiply the
ſaid Digit in him ſelfe, and againe the product thereof into the triple,
& ſet the ſomme yt comes therof right vnder the triple: Thirdly
multiply the ſaid Digit in it ſelfe cubically, and ſet the product
thereof loweſt of all, right vnder the next pricke on the right hand:
that done, drawe a line, and by Addition bring all the foreſaid thrée
products into one ſomme placing euery figure ſo as you may eaſily
take the ſaid ſomme out of the vpper number, whereof you ſéeke
the Cubique roote, and write the remainder (if there be any) ouer
the head, and if ſuch ſomme will not be ſubtracted out of the vpper
number, then you muſt ſéeke out a leſſer Digit, reſeruing ſtill

the former triple and Diuiſor, and if there bee more pricks in the
number then two, then you muſt for euery pricke finde out a new
Triple, and a new Diuiſor by tripling the whole quotient, and by
working continually in like order as the rule before teacheth,
which rule you ſhall more plainely perceiue by example thus. Firſt
then hauing to finde out the Cubique roote of the number before
mentioned, which is 4 1 0 6 3 6 2 5 marked with prickes as before
is taught: reſorte to the Table wherein you ſhall finde ſuch a Cubique
number as will take away as much of the 41. as may bée,
which is 27. the roote whereof is 3. for al the other Cubique numbers
in the table are either too ſmall or too great, and therefore you
muſt alwaies haue due conſideration therof. Then take 27. which
is the Cubique number, out of 41. and there remaineth 14. which
remainder you muſt ſet ouer the laſt pricke on your left hand cancelling
the 41. as in this example.
                  
                     〈 math 〉
                  
                  Then triple the quotient which maketh 9.
which you muſt ſet downe vnder the figure
6. next vnto the ſecond pricke which is on your
right hand: Then to find out the Diuiſor multiply
the Triple 9. by 3. which is the quotient, and the product
therof ſhal be ye Diuiſor: which diuiſor you muſt place right vnder
the triple one figure ſhorter towards the left hand: that done, draw
a line as you ſée in this example.
                  
                     〈 math 〉
                  
                  Now hauing orderly ſet downe
the Triple and the Diuiſor, aſke how
many times 2. which is the firſt figure
of the Diuiſor is contained in 14. ſtanding
right ouer his head, and remember
to make choiſe of ſuch a Digit as may not cleane take away
the whole number at the firſt, but rather leaue ſo much as the ſaide
quotient hauing afterward to be multiplyed diuerſe waies as ſhal
be ſaid hereafter, may take away the reſt or as much therof as may
be, as in this example following, you ſhall finde the apteſt Digit
for this purpoſe to be 4. which you muſt put in the quotient, whereby
the quotient ſhall be now 34. that done, you muſt firſt multiply
this laſt quotient which is 4. into the Diuiſor 27. the product
whereof is 108. which you muſt ſet downe right vnder the Diuiſor,
beneath the line already drawne, as you ſée in this example.
                  
                     
                     
                        〈 math 〉
                     Secondly you muſt multiply the
ſaid 4. in it ſelf quadratly which maketh
16. then multiply that 16. by
the triple 9. the product whereof is
144. which is to be ſet right vnder
the triple as in this example.
                  
                     〈 math 〉
                  
                  Thirdly you muſt multiply the
ſaid 4. in it ſelfe cubically, which maketh
64. which is to be ſet right vnder
the next pricke on the right hand
beneath the former ſummes as you ſée
in this other example.
                  
                     〈 math 〉
                  
                  So as euery one of the foreſaide
thrée products doe extend one further
then another by one figure towardes
the right hand, as you ſée in ye former
example: Now theſe products being
thus placed, drawe another line and
bring all the thrée ſeuerall products
contained betwixt the 2. lines, into
one ſumme by Addition, and you ſhal
finde the totall ſumme to be 12304.
which being ſubtracted out of the
number ſtanding right ouer it which
is 14063. there will remaine 1759.
which you muſt ſet downe aboue as
you ſée in this example.
                  
                     〈 math 〉
                  
                  Now to procéede with the next,
you muſt finde out a new Triple and
a new Diuiſor.
                  How is that done?
                  Thus, multiply the whole quotient which is 34. by 3. the product
whereof is 102. and that is the Triple which is to be placed
in the next voide ſpace hard by the next pricke that is on your
right hand: Then multiply the whole quotient into the laſt found
Triple 102. and the product thereof which is 3468. ſhall bee
your Diuiſor, which is to be placed vnder the Triple one figure
ſhorter towards the left hand as you ſée in the example following:

which two numbers being thus found and rightly placed, draw a
line, then aſke how many times the firſt figure of your Diuiſor
which is 3. is contained in the number right ouer his head which
is 17. and you ſhall finde it to bee 5. times contained therein,
wherefore ſet downe 5. in the quotient, that doone, multiply
the 5. into the Diuiſor, and place the product thereof which is
17/340. right vnder the Diuiſor beneath the line, as you ſée in
this example.
                  
                     〈 math 〉
                  
                  Secondly ſquare the ſame 5 that is
to ſay, multiply it in it ſelfe, and that
maketh 25. which 25. you muſt multiply
againe into the Triple 102. the
product whereof is 2550. which number
you muſt ſet right vnder the ſaide
triple beneath the line. Thirdly multiply
the ſaid 5. in it ſelfe cubically
which maketh 125. and place that right vnder the firſt pricke on
the right hande, and drawe a line, that done, adde all the foreſayde
3. products together, and you ſhall finde the totall
ſumme thereof to bée 1759625. which being ſubtracted out
of the vpper number, there remaineth nothing, as this example
plainely ſheweth.
                  
                     〈 math 〉
                  
                  Whereby you may conclude that
the foreſaid nūber whereof you ſought
the roote, is a perfect Cubique number,
for if you multiply the whole quotient
in it ſelfe cubically, it wil produce
the ſelfe ſame number whereof you
ſought ye roote. But note that if in making
the firſt Subtractiō, the firſt Diuiſor
is not to be found in the vpper
number, then you muſt ſet a Cypher
in the quotient, that done, triple the whole quotient, and place the
ſaide triple vnder the figure which is next to the next pricke on the
right hand, working in ſuch order as before, and to avoide confuſiō,
hauing to deale with a multitud of nūbers it ſhal not be amiſſe
at ye finding out of euery new triple, & diuiſor to ſet ye remainders
in ſeueral places by thēſelues, & to worke then in the ſelf ſame order

that is before taught, alſo note that if you haue to deale with a
fewe numbers, and that the Diuiſor cannot bee ſubtracted out of
the number ſtanding right ouer his head, then you muſt ſet a Cypher
in the quotient and ſo you haue done, as for example, hauing
to take the cubicall roote of 8597. here I find 2. to be the quotient,
which being cubically multiplyed, doth cleane take away the 8.
and now according to my former rule 12. muſt be my Diuiſor,
which becauſe I cannot take it out of 5. I ſet downe therefore a
Cypher in the quotient, ſo as the quotient is now 20. which is the
cubicall roote of the foreſaide
number, for if you multiply
20. cubically and adde therevnto
5 6 7. which is the remainder,
the ſumme thereof

Cap. 27
                  
                     BEcauſe the vſe of theſe Fractions is very
neceſſarie for thoſe that haue to calculate
the motions of the Starres and the difference
of time, I thought good to ſhew here
how the ſame are to be added, ſubtracted,
multiplyed and diuided, for the meaſure
of time falleth not out alwaies to bee a
whole yeare, moneth, day, or hower, nor
the mouing of the celeſtiall bodies are
to be meaſured alwaies by whole circles, ſignes, or whole degrées,
& therfore to haue an exact meaſure of ſuch things it was thought
beſt by the auncient writers to diuide all whole things called Integra
into the leſſeſt parts that might bee, for which purpoſe no
number was thought ſo méete as 60. for there is no number vnder

100. that receiueth ſo many Diuiſions as 60. which may bee
diuided many ſundrie waies, that is by 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 10. 12. 15. 20.
and by 30. and therefore they diuided euery whole thing that had
no vſuall parts into 60. minutes, and euery minute into 60. ſeconds,
and euery ſecond into 60. thirds, and ſo forth vnto 60.
fourthes, fifts, ſixts, ſeuenths, eights, ninthes and tenths, and
further if néede were but that ſeldome chanceth. And you haue to
note that minutes are marked with one ſtréeke ouer the head, ſeconds
with two ſtréekes, thirds with thrée ſtréekes, and ſo forth
thus, 23′· 6″· 7‴· 8''''· &c. which do ſignifie 23. minutes 6. ſeconds 7.
thirds, and 8. fourths.
                  
                     Of Addition.
                     VVHat is to bee obſerued in adding of theſe kindes of
Fractions?
                     Firſt that you bring Integrums to Integrums, and Fractions
to Fractions, that bee of like denomination, beginning alwaies
with the leaſt on the right hand, and if the ſumme of ſuch
Addition doe amount any where to the number of 60. or aboue
60 then you muſt looke how many 60. are comprehended therein,
and for euery 60. adde one to the next greater Fraction that is on
the left hand, obſeruing ſtill that order vntill you come to the Integrums,
of which Integrums, it is alſo neceſſary to know their
values, that is to ſay, what parts they containe, and what denomination
thoſe parts haue: As for example, if you adde common
ſignes ſuch as the twelue ſignes of the Zodiaque be, then euery
ſigne containeth 30. degrées, ſo as euery ſumme excéeding 30 is
to be diuided by 30. but if they be Phiſicall ſignes whereof 6. doe
make a whole circle, ſuch as be ſet downe in the table of Alphonſus,
then the ſumme of thoſe degrées is to be diuided by 6. Moreouer
ſo often as the ſumme of the common ſignes doe excéede 12.
or the ſumme of the Phiſicall ſignes doe excéede 6. the ouerplus is
alwaies to be reiected, and the remainder to be ſet in the place of
the ſignes, as you may ſée in this example following wherein ſeconds
are reduced to minutes, minutes to degrées, and finally degrées,
to ſignes.

Fractions, you ſhall
finde by Addition that

you muſt ſet downe vnder the collum of ſeconds, kéeping the quotient
which is 2. in mind to be added to the collum of minutes, the
ſumme whereof is 162. which being diuided by 60. you ſhall find
in the quotient 2. degrées, and the remainder to be 42′· which is
to be ſet downe vnder the collum of minutes, and the quotient 2.
kept in minde to bee added to the collum of degrées, the ſumme
whereof is 90. degrées, which being diuided by 30. (becauſe that
30. degrées doe make one common whole ſigne) you ſhall find in
the quotient 3. ſignes and no remainder: wherefore you muſt ſet
downe a Cypher vnder the collum of degrées, and adde the 3.
ſignes to the collum of ſignes, the ſumme whereof is 32. which it
you diuide by twice 12. which maketh 24. you ſhall finde the remainder
to be 8. ſignes, which is to be ſet downe vnder the collum
of ſignes, for the quotient here is to be reiected according to the
rule before giuen, ſo as the totall ſumme of this Addition is 8.

was in the quotient, vnto the collum of daies, and ſo you ſhall find

ſo as you alwaies remember that when you haue to take a greater
number of Fractions, as of minutes, ſeconds, thirds and ſuch
like, out of a leſſer number of Fractions, to borrow 60. and hauing
ſet downe the remainder to adde the one borrowed, vnto the
next collum on the left hand, for there the 60. borrowed, is but
one, but if you haue to deale with degrées, which are counted Integrums,
then you muſt borrow but 30. for ſo many degrées doe
make one ſigne, and if you haue to ſubtract howers, then you
muſt borrow 24. for ſo many howers doe make one day, as by the
example here following you ſhall more plainely perceiue.

                     In this example
becauſe you can not
take 53″· out of 27″· you
muſt borrowe one
minute from the next
collum on the left
hand, which one mynute
is 60″· which being added to 27. doe make in all 87″· out of
which if you take 53″· there will remaine 34″· that done, you muſt
pay home the minute which you borrowed by adding the ſame vnto
the next 9. on the left hand, which maketh 10. then ſay, take 10′·
out of 42′· and there remaineth 32′· which being ſet down, procéede
to the next. But here to take one out of none that cannot be,
and therefore borrow one whole ſigne from the collum of ſignes
which is 30. degrées, from whence take one, and there remaineth
29. which being ſet downe, take the one which you borrowed out of
8. and there remaineth 7. ſo as the whole remainder of this Subtraction

is 7/ ſignes, 29/degrées, 32′ / and 34″· as the former example
ſheweth.
                  
                  
                     Of Multiplycation.
                     THough there bee more difficultie in multiplying and diuiding
Aſtronomicall Fractions then in adding or ſubtracting them,
yet the greateſt difficultie thereof chiefly conſiſteth in the finding
out of the true denomination of the products, for firſt as touching
Multiplycation you muſt multiply euery number of the multiplyer
into all the particular nūbers of the ſum that is to be multiplyed,
and then ſeuerally to adde together the products that bee of
one ſelfe denomination, and whatſoeuer in that Addition ariſeth
to the number of 60. or excéedeth 60. it is to be reduced by the ſexaginarie
Diuiſion into the greater ſumme, ſo ſhall you collect the
whole ſumme of the Multiplycation. But you haue to note by the
way, that if there be any Integrums of diuers denominations in
your multiplyer: That then ſuch Integrums muſt be reduced to
one ſelfe kind of Integrums: As for example, ſuppoſe that you
would multiply the daily motion of the Moone which according to
Alphonſus tables, is 13. degrées, 10′· 35″· and 1‴· by 29. daies,
12. howers, 44′, and 3″· here becauſe there be in this multiplyer
Integrums of diuers denominations, that is to ſay daies and
howers, you muſt therefore reduce the ſame into one ſelfe denomination,
before that you can make your Multiplycation.
                     How is that to be done?
                     By multiplying euery number of the ſaid multiplyer by 5. and
then by halfing the product thereof, by which halfing you ſhall reduce
mynutes to ſeconds, and ſeconds to thirds, and ſo forth to
the ſmalleſt Fractions of all, and if any product doe amount to
60. or excéede 60. then you muſt diuide that product by 60. the

                           •
                        emainder whereof is to be ſet vnder his proper denomination,
and you muſt kéepe the quotient in minde to adde the ſame to the
next greater number as this table ſheweth: In the front whereof
I haue ſet downe in ſeuerall ſpaces not onely the denominations
of the two Integrums, as daies and howers, but alſo the denominations
of ſo many Fractions as I think méete to ſerue my turne,
vnder which from I place the foreſaid multiplyer, and then draw
a line as you ſée in this example following.

15. the one halfe whereof is 7‴· and halfe a third which is 3''''0·
wherefore I ſet downe the ſaid 7‴· and 3''''0· vnder their proper denominations
as you ſée in the example aboue, then I multiply 44′
by 5. the product whereof is 220. and the halfe thereof is 110.
which being diuided by 60. the quotient is 1′· and the remainder
50″· which remainder I ſet vnder his proper denomination, kéeping
the quotient ſtil in mind, that done, I multiply 12. howers by
5. the product whereof is 60. and the halfe of that is 30′· wherevnto
by adding the one which I had in mind, I make it 31′· and
ſo I ſet it downe vnder his proper denomination, and becauſe
there be no more Fractions to be multiplyed, I ſet downe on the
left hand the Integrum 29. and by this meanes I haue brought
the foreſaid multiplyer to one ſelfe denomination and to one kind
of Integrum, that is to ſay to 29. daies 31′· 50″· 7‴· 3''''0· which now
being the greater number is to be ſet aboue, and to be Multiplyed
by the foreſaid daily motion of the Moone, that is 13. degrées, 10′
35″· and 1‴· but to the intent that in multiplying theſe numbers together
you may ſet euery product in his true place, that is to ſay,
vnder his proper denomination, it ſhall not be amiſſe in the front
of your worke to ſet downe two rowes of numbers, whereof the
firſt muſt containe many denominations or Fractions as you
thinke good, as minutes, ſeconds, thirds, fourths, and ſo forth,
marked with ſtréekes and vulgare numbers, and the ſecond rowe
ſhall be the naturall order of numbers written in Arithmeticall figures
as this table ſheweth.

the two naturall numbers that is 3. ſtanding ouer 1. the
multiplyer, and 4. ſtanding ouer 30. the multiplycand being added
together doe make 7. appointing to the product his proper
denomination, then multiply againe the ſame 1‴· into 7‴· the product
whereof is 7vi· which muſt be ſet vnder the denomination vi.
becauſe 3. ſtandeth ouer both their heads, and therefore muſt bée
taken twice, that is to ſay for each number 3. which being added
together doe make 6. appointing thereby to the product his proper
place of denomination, that done, multiply the ſaid 1‴· into 50″·
the product whereof is 50″· which muſt be ſet vnder the denomination
v. for the 3 which ſtandeth ouer 1. and the 2. ouer 50″· being
added together maketh 5. appointing to his proper place of denomination,
then multiply the ſaid 1‴· into 31′· the product whereof
is 1''''1· here the two naturall numbers that is to ſay 3. ſtanding
ouer 1‴· and one ouer 31′· being added together, doe make 4. appointing
to the product his proper place of denomination, then
multiply the foreſaid 1‴· into 29. Integrums, the product whereof

is 2‴9· and muſt be ſet vnder the denomination ‴ becauſe 3. ſtandeth
ouer 1‴· but 29. being an Integrum, hath no natural number ſtanding
ouer him but a Cypher, thus hauing gon through out all the
numbers of the multiplycand, with the firſt number of the multiplyer,
procéede in like order with the ſecond number of the multiplyer,
which is 35″· which being multiplyed into 3''''0· maketh 10vi50·
to be ſet vnder the denomination vi. becauſe 2. ſtandeth ouer 35″·
the multiplyer, and 4. ouer 3''''0· the multiplycand, which 4. and 2.
being added together maketh 6. then multiply 35″· by 7‴· which maketh
245v· which you muſt ſet downe vnder the denomination v. becauſe
2. and 3. maketh 5. that done, multiply 35″· by 50″· which
maketh 1750''''· which you muſt ſet downe vnder the denomination
'''' becauſe the multiplycand and the multiplyer are both vnder
the denomination ″ which being twice repeated, maketh 4. then
multiply 35″· by 31′· and that maketh 1085‴· which you muſt ſet
downe vnder the denomination ‴ becauſe 1. and 2. maketh 3. finally
multiply 29. Integrums, by 35″· and that maketh 1015″· thus
as you haue gon through with two numbers of your multiplyer,
ſo procéede in like order with the other two numbers of the multiplyer
which is 10. and 13. and when you haue ended your Multiplycation,
and ſet euery product in his proper place, and ſo as
euery figure may ſtand one right vnder another, to auoide confusion
when you come to Addition, (to which end the ſpaces of collums
had néede to be the larger) then draw a line vnder all the products
and beginning on the right hand, adde all the products contained
in euery ſeuer all collum together, and if the ſumme of any
ſuch particular Addition do ariſe to the ſumme of 60. or excéed the
number of 60. then diuide that ſumme by 60. and ſet downe the
remainder, kéeping the quotiēt in mind to be added to the product
of the next collum on the lefthand, ſo ſhall you find the total ſumme
of your Multiplycation to be 389. degrées, 6′· 24″· 2‴· 31''''· 12v· 37vi·
and 30vii· as the former example plainly ſheweth. Now if you dſuide
389. degrées, by 30. becauſe euery common ſigne containeth 30.
degrées, you ſhall find your totall ſumme to be 12. ſigneſ, 29. degrées,
6′· 24″· 2‴· 31''''· 12v· 37vi· and 30vii· and ſo much the Moone runneth
in the ſpace of 2. 9. daies 12. howers, 44′ and 3″· of an hower, which
is her full reuolution betwixt euery two changes, but for as much
as it chanceth as wel in this example as in many others like, that

Integrums of two ſundrie denominations are propounded in the
queſtion, it may be very well doubted with what denomination the
product of ſuch multiplycation is to be named, as in this example
hauing multiplyed time by motion, a man may aſke whether the
product ſhall be named daies or degrées, the reſoluing of which
doubt dependeth vpon the nature of the queſtion propounded, for
in the foreſaid example, becauſe time or daies do comprehend any
certaine appointed motion, therefore the product of the Multiplycation
is to be referred to the degrées of motion which are comprehended
vnder time, and not to time which comprehendeth motion,
wherfore this product of Integrums videliz. 389. ſignifieth here
degrées and not daies, ſo likewiſe when degrées and minutes are
multiplyed by myles and minutes, the product of ſuch Multiplycation
taketh his name frō myles & not from degrées, because degrées
do comprehend myles, for we ſay in matters of Geography
that euery degrée of the great circle comprehēdeth 60 myles, thus
hauing ſpoken ſufficiently of the Multiplycation of Aſtronomical
Fractions, we wil now procéede to ye Diuiſion of ſuch Fractions.
                  
                  
                     Of the Diuiſion of Fractions Aſtronomicall.
                     VVHat is to be obſerued therein?
                     Firſt you muſt conſider whether your Diuiſor be compound,
or ſimple, I cal that compound which containeth Fractions
of diuers denominations, and that ſimple which conſiſteth of
Integrums, or is one whole number of one ſelfe denomination,
wherein there is no dificultie, for then you haue no more to do but
to diuide euery particular number contained in the diuidend by ye
ſame Diuiſor and to place the product of euery one vnder ſuch denomination,
as the little table of denominations ſheweth, & therefore
it ſhall not bee amiſſe to ſet the foreſaid little table ouer your
diuidend euen as you did in Multiplycation: Alſo the Sexagenary
progreſſion is alwaies to be vſed, as well in Diuiſion as in Multiplycation.
Moreouer if your Diuiſor be not exactly contained in ye
diuidend, then hauing multiplyed the diuidend by 60. you muſt
adde to the product therof the next Fraction following: As for example,
knowing by Alphonſus tables that the daily motion of the
Moone is 13. degrées, 10′· 35″· 1‴· 15''''· you would know how much
the goeth in the ſpace of an hower, here becauſe that one day containeth

24. howers, the number muſt be 24. your Diuiſor which
is ſimple and not compound, firſt then ſet downe in the front of
your worke the rowe of denominations onely, and not the natural
numbers, becauſe they are not to be vſed in this way of Diuiſion,
that done, right vnder the rowe of denominations place your diuidend,
and right vnder y• your Diuiſor, as you ſée in this example.

becauſe the Diuiſor

maketh 780. wherevnto
by adding the next Fraction on the right hand which is 10′·
the whole ſumme is 790′· which being diuided by 24. the quotient
is 32′· which becauſe they are minutes, I place them vnder the
denomination of minutes, and the remainder is 22′· which being
multiplyed by 60. maketh 1320″· wherunto I adde the next figure
which is 35. and ſo the whole ſumme is 1355″· which being diuided
by 24. the quotient is 56″· which I place vnder the denomination
of ſeconds, and the remainder of this Diuiſion is 11″· which being
multiplyed by 60. maketh 660‴· whereto I adde the next Fraction
which is 1‴· ſo that now the whole ſumme is 661‴· which being diuided
by 24. the quotient is 27‴· which I ſet downe vnder the denomination
of thirds, and the remainder is 13‴· which being multiplyed
by 60. maketh 780''''· whereunto I adde the next Fraction
which is 15''''· which maketh in all 795''''· which being diuided by 24.
the quotient is 33''''· which I place vnder the denominatiō of fourths.
and the remainder is 3''''· which being multiplyed by 60. maketh
180v· whereunto hauing no Fraction to adde, I diuide the ſame by
24. and ſo I find in the quotient 7v· which I ſet vnder the denomination
of fifts, ſo as I find the howerly motion of the Moone to bée
32′· 56″· 27‴· 33''''· 7v· and ſomewhat more, for I leaue to deale any further
with the ſmaller Fractions that would ſtil grow by multiplying
the remainders by 60. thinking this ſufficient to ſhew you in
what order you haue to worke, to diuide your diuidend by a ſimple
Diuiſor, into as many ſmall parts as you will: but if your Diuiſor
be compound, then the Diuiſion is to be done either by reduction
into the ſmalleſt Fractions, or without reductiō: which last way

is very hard and tedious, and therefore I will onely ſhew you how
to make your diuiſion whereof the Diuiſor is compound by reduction,
and that by this one example here following. Suppoſe then
that the Moone according to her owne courſe which is from Weſt
to Eaſt, is diſtant from ſome fixed Starre 36. degrées. 30′· 24″·
50‴· and 15''''· and that you would know in what time ſhe will runne
that diſtaunce, according to her daily moouing which as hath béene
ſaid before is 13. degrées, 10′· 35″· 1‴· and 15''''· here to make this diuiſion
by reduction, you muſt doe thus. Firſt reduce all the numbers
of your diuidend into the ſmalleſt Fractions thereof by the
Sexagenarie Multiplycation and Addition of the next Fraction
vnto the product of that Multiplycation: that done, reduce all the
numbers of your Diuiſor by like Multiplycation and Addition,
into the ſmalleſt Fractions, ſo as the diuidend & the Diuiſor may
be both of one ſelfe denomination, and diuide the one by the other,
euen as they were Integrums, as in this example you muſt firſt
multiply 36. degrées, by 60. and it will make 2160′· whereto by
adding 30′· you make the whole ſumme of minutes to be 2190′·
which being multiplyed againe by 60. doe make 131400″· whereto
if you adde the 24″· the ſumme of ſecondes will bee 131424″· and ſo
procéeding ſtill with the Sexagenarie Multiplycation and Addition
of the next Fraction as you did before, you ſhall find the diuidend
to be 473129415''''· Then in like order reduce your Diuiſor into
the ſmalleſt Fraction, and you ſhall find the totall ſumme therof
to be 170766075''''· this reduction being made, diuide the diuidend
by the diuiſor, ſo ſhal you find in the quotient 2. Integrums,
that is to ſay 2. daies, and the remainder to be 132597365''''· which
remainder if you multiply by 60. and diuide the product by the
ſelf ſame Diuiſor, you ſhal haue in the quotient minutes, then multiply
againe that remainder by 60. and diuide the product thereof
by the ſame Diuiſor, and you ſhall haue in the quotient ſeconds,
and ſo by obſeruing ſtill that order you ſhall bring it into as ſmal
Fractions as you will, thus ſhall you finde that the Moone according
to her daily motion, will runne the foreſaide ſpace of diſtance
that was betwixt her and the fixed Starre in 2. daies, 46′· and 14″·
                  
               
               
                  
                  How to diuide Aſtronomicall
Fractions when the Diuiſor is greater
then the diuidennd.
Cap. 28.
                  
                     THough by the laſt chapter you may learne how to
diuide any number in Aſtronomicall Fractions,
whereof the Diuiſor is greater then the diuidend,
yet I minde once againe, to ſet downe a generall
rule to ſerue for ſuch purpoſe, becauſe it commeth
often in vſe in hauing to deale with Aſtronomicall
tables, and to giue you example thereof: Firſt then hauing to diuide
any number, whoſe Diuiſor is greater then the diuidend,
doe thus; multiply the greateſt denomination of the diuidend by
60. and if there be any Fractions annexed thereunto which are of
the next inferiour kinde, as minutes are to degrées, or to howers,
and ſeconds to minutes, and thirds to ſeconds &c. Then adde them
to the former product, but if ſuch Fractions be not of the next inferior
kind, then let them ſtand as they are vntill you come to deale
with them, and hauing diuided according to the common rule of
Diuiſion the firſt ſumme of the diuidend by the Diuiſor, multiply
the quotient into the whole Diuiſor, and ſubtract that product out
of the vpper number if it may bee, if not, then make the quotient
leſſer and leſſer, vntill you can finde ſuch a number as will be ſubtracted
out of the ſaid vpper number, and if there be any remainder
left, then multiply that remainder by 60. not leauing to follow the
former order of working, vntill you haue found the neareſt exact
quotient that may be. And you haue to note that the denomination
of the firſt quotient muſt be of the next inferior kind, to that denomination
which the Diuiſor hath, and to make this rule the plainer, I
will ſet downe and example vſed by Standius ut the 115 page of his
Ephemerides who to know the very inſtant of the ſull Moone the ſecond
of March 1569. biddeth to diuide the diſtance of the oppoſition
which was 8. degrées, 46′· by the diurnal exceſſe of the Moones

motion from the ſùnne which was then 13. degrées, 48′· which
Diuiſor becauſe it is greater then the diuidend, you muſt according
to the rule before giuen, worke thus: Firſt multiply the
greateſt denomination of the diuidend which is 8. degrées by 60′·
the product whereof will be 480′· whereunto by adding the Fraction
annexed videliz. 46′· it maketh in all 526′· which is to be diuided
by 13. degrées, 48′· here in diuiding the laſt product firſt by
13. degrées, I finde in the quotient 39. which is one too many, conſidering
that I muſt take out of the foreſaid diuidend 48′· as often
as I did take out thereof 13. degrées, wherefore I ſet downe but
38. in the quotient, and then the remainder will be 96. which becauſe
I may eaſily diuide by the common Diuiſor 13. degrées,
and 48′· I diuide therefore that 96. firſt by 13. whereof the quotient
is 7. and the remainder is 5. which I reduce into ſeconds by
multiplying that 5. by 60. the product whereof is 300″· that done,
I multiply 48′· by 7. the product whereof is 336. which though
it bee ſomewhat too great a number to be taken out of 300. yet I
let it ſtand becauſe it approcheth to a very nigh exactneſſe, and by
this meanes I finde the whole quotient to bee 38′· and 7″· and you
haue to note that if after the firſt quotient be ſet downe, there happen
any remainder which is leſſer then the Diuiſor, then you muſt
ſet downe a Cypher in the quotient, and remooue your Diuiſor one
place further, euen as you doe in common Diuiſion, and then to
worke as before.
               
               
                  How to take the ſquare roote of
Aſtronomicall Fractions.
Cap. 29.
                  
                     THe greateſt difficultie hereof conſiſteth in finding
out the true denomination of the roote, for if the
Fraction be ſeconds, then the roote therof are mynutes,
and if the Fraction be fourths, then the
roote are ſeconds, for the Fraction muſt alwaies
haue ſuch denomination as may be halfed, as ſeconds,
fourths, and ſuch like, the one halfe whereof giueth alwaies

name to the roote, for if the queſtion bee of thirds, you muſt firſt
reduce them to fourths before you can take the roote, and you muſt
doe the like with any other Fraction, whoſe denomination is od
and not euen. As for example, if you would take the roote of 43‴·
here by multiplying theſe 43‴· by 60. you ſhall reduce them into
1580''''· the roote whereof is 50″· Moreouer the Fractions where.
with you haue to deale, are either ſimple or compound, if they bée
ſimple and leſſe then minutes, and therewith haue euen denominations
and not odde, then you néede to make no further reduction,
but to worke as if you had to deale with whole numbers. As
in ſeeking the ſquare roote of 1600″· you find it to be iuſt 40′· but if
the number be compound, that is to ſay, conſiſting ot Integrums
and Fractions, or of many Fractions hauing diuers denominations,
then you muſt firſt reduce them all to the ſmalleſt Fraction
that hath an euen denomination before that you can take the roote:
As for example, you would know the roote of 4. degrées, 25′· here
you muſt by the Sexagenarie Multiplycation and Addition of
the next Fraction, reduce the degrées to minutes, and the minutes
to ſeconds, as you were taught before in Diuiſion, and then to
worke as you were wont to doe in taking the ſquare roote of whole
numbers, and in ſo doing, you ſhall finde the ſumme of ſeconds to
be 15900″· the ſquare roote whereof is 126′· which if you diuide by
60. it will make 2. degrées, 6′· Another example, as to take the
roote of 13. degrées, 42′· and 45″· here by reduction as before, you
ſhall bring the degrées and minutes to 49365″·. the ſquare roote
whereof is 222′· which being diuided by 60. maketh 3. degrées,
42′· And thus I end with the Aſtronomicall Fractions, which
kinde of Fractions, though they be very learnedly and orderly
taught by Reinoldus in the beginning of his Prutenicall tables,
yet in mine opinion not in ſo plaine order, and ſo fit for euery mans
vnderſtanding, as I haue here ſet them downe according to the
doctrine of Gemma Friſius, which being once learned, you ſhall
the ſoner attaine to the other. And without the knowledge of theſe
Fractions, you can neuer truely calculate any thing out of the
Aſtronomicall tables, and therefore ſuch Fractions are moſt neceſſarie
to be learned.
               
               
                  
                  The deſcription and vſe of the
Sexagenarie table.
                  
                     THis table conſiſteth of two figures, whereof
the neather figure hauing foure Angles,
is called in Latine Trapezium,
marked with the letters A. D. E. B. and
the vpper figure is a Triangle, marked
with the letters A. B. C. and each figure
containeth particular collums of numbers,
ſeruing to finde out the products of Aſtronomicall
Fractions being multiplyed one by another, and alſo the
quotients of the like Fractions being diuided one by another, and
alſo the ſquare rootes of the ſaid Fractions, for which purpoſe the
firſt collum on the left hand, containeth 59. Fractions, counting
from 1. ſtanding aboue, and ſo procéeding downe ward to 59. and
are contained betwixt A. and D. and the foote of the ſaid Trapezium,
containeth 30. counting from the leſt hand towards the
right, which are contained betwixt D. and E. and the reſt of the
numbers to make vp 59. are to be found in the vpper moſt front
of the Triangle, procéeding from C. towards A. you haue to note
alſo that in the outermoſt collum of the Trapezium on the right
hand, the numbers doe procéede downeward from 30. to 59. that
is from B. to E. and the numbers in the outermoſt collum of the
Triangle on the right hand, doe procéede vpward from 31. to
59. contained betwixt B. and C. both which doe ſerue to fill vp
the firſt multiplyers, and multiplycands, for when you cannot
finde them in the Trapezium, then the outermoſt collum of the
Triangle on the right hand, ſerueth to ſupply that want, and
when you cannot finde the ſaid numbers in the Triangle, then the
outermoſt collum of the Trapezium on the right hand, ſerueth to
ſupplie that want, and in ſéeking any multiplyer or multiplycand,

either in the Trapezium or in the Triangle, conſider alwaies
which way they are moſt readily found out, ſo as they may directly
aunſwere one againſt another.
                  All the reſt of the numbers contained betwixt the two outermoſt
collums and are ſet downe in ſquare Angles, called common
Angles, do ſignifie either products or diuidends or ſquare numbers,
according as occaſion ſhall require. And the outermoſt collums
do ſignifie ſometime multiplyers, ſometime multiplycands.
ſometime quotients, and ſometime rootes. All which thinges you
ſhall better vnderſtand by the examples hereafter following.
                  
                     The vſe of the Table.
                     By helpe of this table you may more readily multiply and diuide
Aſtronomicall Fractions, and alſo find out the ſquare roote of
ſuch Fractions, then by thoſe rules which I haue heretofore ſet
downe according to the doctrine of Gemma Friſius. And firſt I
will ſet downe an example of Multiplycation, then another of Diuiſion,
and thirdly one example of finding out the ſquare roote of
the ſaid Fractions, and let the example of Multiplycation be thus:
Suppoſe that you would multiply 29. degrées, 31′· 53″· 7‴· 30''''· by
13. degrées, 10′· 35″· 1‴· which you muſt ſet downe in ſuch order as
followeth, (that is to ſay) firſt the denominations, then next vnder
them the multiplycand, and next vnder that the multiplyer, and
vnder them the ſeueral products, and loweſt of all the totall ſumme
of the ſaid products.

                     Here beginning

firſt number of
the multiplyer
on the right
hand which is
1‴· ſay thus, one
times 30. is 30
which is to bée
placed vnder the denomination of 7. becauſe the denominatino
ouer 1. is 3. and the denomination ouer 30. is 4.
which being added together according to the rule before ſet

downe in the Chapter of Multiplycation of Aſtronomicall
Fractions doe make 7. then ſay one times 7. is 7. which you
muſt place vnder the ſixt denomination. Againe one times 50. is
50. which is to bee ſet vnder the fift denomination, becauſe
3. and 2. maketh 5, then ſay one times 31. is 31. which is to bée
ſet vnder the fourth denomination, for 3. and 1. maketh 4, then
one times 29. is 29. which is to be ſet vnder the third denomination,
and thus you haue the firſt product: then procéede with the
next number of the multiplyer towards your left hand which is 35.
and is to be multiplyed into 30. which to doe readily, you muſt
enter the table with theſe two numbers, and ſéeking in the firſt
Collum of the Trapezium on the left hand, for 35. in the foote of
the ſaid Trapezium, for the number of 30. you ſhall finde in the
common angle the product to be 17. and 30. whereof you muſt
place the 30. vnder the ſixt denomination, and kéeping the number
17. ſtill in minde to be added to the next product, multiply 35.
into 7. and you ſhall finde in the Trapezium the product to be 4.
and 5. whereunto if you adde the 17. which you had in mind, the
product will be 4. and 22. whereof you muſt ſet the 22. vnder the
fift denomination, and kéeping the 4. in minde, multiply againe
the ſame 35. into 50. the product whereof you ſhall finde in the
Triangle to be 29. and 10. whereto if you adde the 4. in mind, it
will make 29. and 14. whereof the 14. is to bee placed vnder the
fourth denomination, and kéeping the 29. in minde, multiply againe
the ſaid 35. into 31. and you ſhall finde the product thereof
in the Triangle to bee 18. and 5. whereunto if you adde 29. in
mind, it will make in all 18. and 34. which 34. is to be ſet vnder
the third denomination, then kéeping 18. in mind, multiply the
foreſaid 35. into 29. and you ſhall finde the product thereof in the
Trapezium to be 16. and 55. whereunto if you adde the 18. in
mind, the product will be 17. and 13. which 13. is to be placed vnder
the ſecond denomination. Now becauſe you haue gon through
all the numbers of the multiplycand with the number 35. you
muſt place the 17. which you had in mind vnder the denomination
of mynutes, and ſo hauing ended the ſecond product, procéede to
the finding out of the third product by multiplying 10. firſt into
30. the product whereof you ſhall find in the Trapezium to bée
5. and 0. whereof you muſt ſet the Cypher vnder the fift denomination

and kéeping the 5 in minde, multiply againe 10. into 7. and
you ſhall finde the product to be 1. and 10. whereunto if you adde
the 5. in mind, the product will be 1. and 15. whereof you muſt ſet
the 15. vnder the fourth denomination, and kéeping the one in
mind, multiply 10. into 50. and you ſhall find the product thereof
in the Trapezium to be 8. and 20. whereunto if you adde the 1.
in mind, it will make 8. and 21. whereof you muſt ſet the 21. vnder
the third denomination, and kéeping 8. in mind, multiply 10.
into 31. and you ſhall find the product thereof in the Trapezium
to bee 5. and 10. vnto which if you adde the 8. in minde, the product
will be 5. and 18. whereof ſet downe the 18. vnder the ſecond
denomination, and kéeping 5. in minde multiply 10. into 29.
the product where of you ſhall finde in the Trapezium to bee 4.
and 50. whereunto if you adde the 5. in mind, the product will be 4
and 55. Now becauſe you haue gone through all the numbers
of the multiplycand, with 10. you muſt ſet downe the 4. which
you had in mind vnder the denomination of degrées, and ſo hauing
the third product, procéede to the fourth by multiplying 13.
into 30. and you ſhall find the product in the Trapezium to be 6.
and 30. whereof ſet downe 30. vnder the fourth denomination of
Fractions, and kéeping 6. in mind multiply 13. into 7. the product
whereof you ſhall finde in the Trapezium to be 1. and 31.
whereunto if you adde the 6. in minde, the product will be 1. and
37. whereof ſet downe the 37. vnder the third denomination, and
kéeping the 1. in mind multiply 13. into 50. and you ſhall find the
product in the Trapezium to be 10. and 50. whereunto if you
adde the one in mind, the product will be 10. and 51. whereof ſet
the 51. vnder the ſecond denomination of Fractions, and kéeping
10. in mind multiply 13 into 31. the product whereof you ſhall
find in the Trapezium to bee 6. and 43. whereunto if you adde
the 10. in mind, the product will be 6. and 53. whereof ſet downe
53. vnder the firſt denomination of Fractions, and kéeping 6. in
mind multiply 13. into 29. the product whereof you ſhall find in
the Trapezium to be 6. and 17. whereūto if you adde ye 6. in mind,
the product will be 6. and 23. whereof ſet downe 23. vnder the denomination
of degrées. Now becauſe you haue gone through all
the numbers of the multiplycand with the laſt number of the multiplyer,
you muſt ſet downe the 6. which you had in minde vnder

the denomination of Integrums, that done, adde all the foure products
together, beginning on the right hand, ſaying thus, 30. and 0
is but 30. which ſet downe vnder the neathermoſt line, as you ſée
in the former figure, then ſay 30. and 7. maketh 37. which you
muſt ſet downe vnder the neathermoſt liue next vnto 30. then ſay
22. and 50. maketh 72. out of which by ſubtracting the Sexagenarie
number, the remainder is 12v. which is to bee ſet vnder the
line next vnto the 37. kéeping ſtill the 60. in minde, which in this
account maketh but one, and is to be added to the next rancke on
the left hand, then ſay 1. in mind and 5. maketh 6. and 4. maketh
10. and 1. maketh 11. here ſet downe 1. and kéepe the Article in
mind, then ſay 1. in mind and 3. maketh 4. then 1. and 1. and 3.
being added to 4. doe make in all 9. out of which 9. you muſt ſubtract
6. which is but one 60. and is to be kept in mind and there
remaineth 3. which is to be ſet downe by the 1. then ſay 1 in mind
and 7. is 8. and 1. is 9. and 4. is 13. and 9. is 22. here ſet downe
2. and kéepe the 2. Articles in minde, then ſay 2. and 3. maketh 5.
and 2. is 7. and 3. is 10. and 2. maketh 12. tennes, which doe
make 2. ſixties, and are to be kept in mind, then ſay 2. and 1. maketh
3. and 8. maketh 11. and 3. maketh 14. wherefore ſet down
4. kéeping the 1. Article in mind, then ſay 1. in mind and 5. is 6.
and 1. is 7. and 1. is 8. then take 6. from 8. and there remaineth
2. which ſet downe by the 4. and kéepe one ſixtie in mind, then ſay
1. in mind and 3. is 4. and 5. is 9. and 7. is 16. wherefore ſet
downe 6. and kéeping one in mind, ſay that 1. and 5. is 6. and 5. is
11. and 1. is 12. which maketh two ſixties to be kept in minde,
then ſay 2. in mind and 3. is 5. and 4. maketh 9. which ſet downe,
then ſay 2. is 2. which ſet downe by the 9. vnder the denomination
of degrées, then ſay 6. and nothing maketh 6. which ſet downe vnder
the denomination of Integrums, for that 6. in this place ſignifieth
6. ſixties, which is in value 360. degrées, and being diuided
by 30. becauſe 30. degrées maketh one whole ſigne, you ſhal
find in the quotient 12. ſignes, ſo as the totall ſumme of the foure
products is 12. ſignes, 29. degrées, 6′· 24″· 2‴· 31''''· 12v· 37vi· 30vii· as
the former figure ſheweth, and this is the very ſame example
which I wrought before when I taught you how to multiply
Aſtronomicall Fractions according to Gemma Friſius his rule,
and they both doe wholly agrée in euery condition, ſauing that to

worke by the Sexagenarie table is the readier way of the two.
                  
                  
                     An example how to diuide Aſtronomicall Fractions
by helpe of the Sexagenarie table.
                     SVppoſe then that you would diuide the former totall ſumme or
product found by Multiplycation, which is 6. Integrums, 29.
degrées, 6′· 24″· 2‴· 31''''· 12v· 37vi· 30vii· by this Diuiſor 29. degrées, 31′·
50″· 7‴· 30''''· which in the former example of Multiplycation was the
multiplycand. Now to diuide theſe two numbers the one by the other,
you muſt doe thus, firſt you muſt ſet downe the rowe of denominations
as you did before in Multiplycation, and next vnder
that the diuidend, then right vnder that the diuiſor, and on the
right hand behind a crooked line made like a halfe Moone, all the
ſeuerall quotients are to be ſet one by another in a right line, as
you may ſée by the figures hereafter following.

made your rowe of
denominations, and
ſet downe your diuidend,
you haue to
conſider whether the firſt number of your Diuiſor be greater then
the firſt number of your diuidend, for if it be, then you muſt place
your Diuiſor one ſpace further towardes your right hand, as in
this example, becauſe the firſt number of your Diuiſor 29. cannot
be taken out of 6. you ſet it vnder the ſecond number of the diuidend,
and ſo all the reſt of the numbers ſucceſſiuely towardes the
right hand, as the former example ſheweth, now the order of working
is thus: You muſt firſt ſéeke out the firſt number of your Diuiſor,
in the firſt collum of the Trapezium on the left hand which
is 29. then in the rowe right againſt that 29. on the right hand,
you haue to ſéek out thoſe numbers of the diuidend, which do ſtand
right ouer the firſt number of your Diuiſor which is 6. and 29.
and if you cannot finde thoſe numbers iuſtly, then ſéeke in the ſelfe
ſame rowe a number which is ſomewhat leſſe and neareſt in value
vnto it, as in this example, becauſe you cannot finde 6. and 29.
you take 6. and 17. the quotient, wherof you ſhall find in the foote
of the Trapezium right vnder the ſaid number 6. and 17. to bée

13. degrées, which you muſt ſet in the quotient line, and that is
your firſt quotient, hauing his proper denomination ouer his head
which are degrées, and are to bee found by the rule before taught.
Thus you ſée here that the number of the Diuiſor is to be founde
in the outermoſt collum on the left hand, and the number of the diuidend
in that rowe which is right againſt the ſaid Diuiſor, and
the quotient in the foote of the Trapezium right vnder the number
of the diuidend laſt found. Then you haue to multiply the
whole Diuiſor (that is to ſay) euery particular number thereof by
the firſt quotient 13. which you may doe by helpe of the Table, as
you did before in the example of Multiplycation,
and is to be ſet downe in this manner. And you
ſhall finde the whole product to be 6. 23. 53. 51.

out of the ſame, and the remainder to bee written ouer the head
of the diuidend as you doe in common Diuiſion, firſt then to multiply
all the particular numbers of the Diuiſor by the quotient
13. and to find euery product thereof, reſort to the Table and ſéeke
for 13. in the foote of the Trapezium, and for 30. which is the
multiplycand in the outermoſt collum of the Trapezium on the
left hand, and the common angle will ſhew the product which is
6. and 30. whereof you muſt ſet downe 30. vnder 30. and kéeping

ſhall finde to bee 1. and 31. vnto

by the common rule of Diuiſion you ſhall finde the quotient to
be 27. which you muſt ſet downe in the quotient line, and by that
quotient you haue to multiply euery particular number of the Diuiſor
beginning on the right hand, as you doe in Multiplycation,
ſaying that 27. times 58. is 26. and 6. as the Trapezium ſheweth,
for by ſéeking 27. in the foote of the Trapezium and for 58.
in the outermoſt collum on the right hand, you ſhal find in the common
Angle 26. and 6. wherefore ſet downe 6. vnder 58. and kéeping
26. in mind, multiply 23. which is the ſecond number of the
Diuiſor by 27. and by the Trapezium you ſhall find the product
thereof to be 10. and 21. whereunto if you adde the 26. in mind, it
will make 10. and 47. whereof ſet downe 47. vnder 23. and kéeping
10. in mind, multiply 56. which is the third number of the
Diuiſor by 27. and in the Trapezium you ſhall finde the product
to bee 25. and 12. whereto if you adde the 10. in minde, it will
make 25. and 22. whereof ſet downe 22. vnder 56. and kéeping
25. in mind, multiply 53. which is the fourth number of the Diuiſor
by 27. the product whereof you ſhall find by the Trapezium
to be 23. and 51. whereto if you adde 25. in mind, it wil make 76
which is one 60. and 16. whereof ſet downe 16. vnder 53. and
adde the one in mind to 23. and that will make 24. which you muſt
kéepe in mind, then multiply 3. which is the fift number of the
Diuiſor by 27. the product whereof you ſhall find in the Trapezium
to be 1. and 21. whereto if you adde the 24. in mind, it will
make 1. and 45. whereof ſet downe 45. vnder 3. and kéeping 1.
in mind, multiply 13. which is the laſt number of the Diuiſor by
27. the product whereof you ſhall find in the Trapezium to bee 5.
and 51. whereunto if you adde one in mind, it will make 5. and 52.
here becauſe the firſt 5. is 5. ſixties, it maketh in all 352. and is to
be ſet vnder 360. ſo as the firſt product of this Multiplycation
containeth theſe numbers 352. 45. 16. 22. 47. 6. as you ſée them

ſéeke for 13. in the foote of the Trapezium, in whoſe collum you ſhal
not finde 5. and 54. but 5. and 51. which is nigheſt vnto

it, and right againſt that in the outermoſt collum on the left hand
you ſhall find the quotient to be 27. by which if you ſhould multiply
the whole Diuiſor, the whole product thereof would be 5. 56
21. 24. 1. 47. 6. which is more then the diuidend, and therefore
you muſt make your quotient one leſſe, ſetting downe no more but
26. in the quotient line, by which if you multiply the Diuiſor, the
product will be 5. 26. 41. 22. 25. 14. 8. which being ſubtracted
out of the fourth diuidend, the remainder will bee 28. 7. 18. 17.
17. 52. which remainder if you will, you may make to be a fift diuidend,
and then to worke as before, if you would haue your quotient
to extend to ſmaller denominations, which I leaue to doe becauſe
I thinke that thirds be ſmall inough. And as often as the
product of any particular quotient ſhall bee greater then the diuidend,
remember to take a leſſe quotient euen as you doe in common
Diuiſion. But now you haue to note that though this whole
quotient here ſignifieth time, for the firſt quotient ſignifieth daies,
the ſecond quotient minutes of daies, the third quotient ſeconds,
and the fourth quotient thirds, yet for ſo much as the day is to be
counted by 24. howers and not by mynutes, you muſt therefore
reduce all the particular quotients ſauing the firſt, into howers
and parts of howers, euen to ſo ſmall denominations as you ſhall
thinke good your ſelfe, by helpe of this rule which in diuiſion of
Aſtronomicall Fractions biddeth to multiply the quotient by 2.
and to diuide the product thereof by 5. as here if you multiply the
33. which is the ſecond quotient by 2. the product will bee 66.
which being diuided by 5. the quotient will be 13. howers and one
ſixtie remaining to be kept in minde, wherefore ſet downe in the
place of 33′· 13. howers, then multiply the third quotient which
is 16. by 2. and that will make 32. whereunto if you adde the one
60. in mind it will make in all 92. which being diuided by 5. the
quotient will be 18. and two ſixties, which is 120. remaining to
be kept in minde, wherefore in ſtéede of 16″· which was the third
quotient, ſet 18′ of an hower, and then procéede to the fourth quotient
which is 26‴· which being multiplyed by 2. maketh 52. whervnto
if you adde, 120. it will make 172. which if you diuide by
5. the quotient will bee 34″· of an hower, which is to bee ſet
downe in the place of 26. ſo ſhall your whole former quotient containe

27. daies, 13. howers, 18′· of an hower and 34″· of an
hower. And note that as in the Diuiſion of Aſtronomicall Fractions
to bring the quotients to like denomination, you doe multiply
by 2. and diuide by 5. ſo in Multiplycation to reduce the numbers
of the multiplyer being of diuers denominations to one ſelfe denomination,
you muſt by order reuerſe, multiply by 5. and diuide
by 2. whereof I haue giuen you an example before, whereas I
ſhew you how to multiply Aſtronomicall Fractions according to
Gemma Friſius, without the helpe of the Sexagenarie table.

                        SVppoſe the number giuen to be 17′· 12″· 33‴· 4''''· whereof you haue
to take the ſquare roote, here hauing ſet downe the ſaid numbers
with their proper denominations ouer their heads, as you ſée in
the example following, firſt ſet a pricke vnder the laſt number on
the right hand, and then pricke euery other number leauing one
voide ſpace betwixt euery two prickes, as you doe when you ſéeke

                     Then reſort to the table
& ſéek amongſt the products
which are placed next to the line A. B. as well in the Trapezium
as in the Triangle, and ſée whether you can find the number ſtanding
ouer the firſt pricke on the left hand which is 17. and 12. but
not finding it there, you muſt take that which is nigheſt vnto it and
leſſe, which you ſhall find in the Triangle towards B. to be 17. 4.
the roote whereof you ſhall finde both in the head, and alſo in the
outward collum of the Triangle on the right hand to be 32. aunſwering
to the foreſaid ſquare roote, which roote you muſt place
behinde the quotient line, then ſubtract 17. and 4. out of 17. and
12. and there will remaine 8. which is to be ſet ouer 12. and the
17. and 12. to be cancelled, that done, double the roote 32. which
will be 64. that is to ſay 1. and 4. and ſetting 1. vnder 8. and 4.
vnder 33. aſke how many times 1. is in 8. and there is 8.
which is the ſecond quotient by which you muſt multiply 1. and 4.

the product whereof will be 8. and 32. which being ſubtracted
from the vpper number which is 8. and 33. the remainder is 1.
which is to be ſet ouer 33. and the 8. and 33. to be cancelled. Finally
multiply the ſecond quotient 8. in it ſelfe, and the product
will be 1. and 4. which being ſubtracted out of the former remainder
of the giuen number nothing remaineth, ſo as you ſhall finde
32′· 8″·. to be the roote of the giuen number, as this example ſheweth.

                     Which roote if you multiply
into it ſelfe ſquarely, the product
will be like vnto the number
giuen, and by this meanes
you ſhall find the giuen number
to be a iuſt ſquare number. But you haue to note that if the laſt denomination
ſtanding on the right hand be od & not euen, as thirds
or fifts, then you muſt ſet downe a Cypher beyond the laſt denomination
towards your right hand, and vnder that Cypher ſet
your firſt pricke, as in this example 3′· 2″·. 9‴· 17''''·. 8v· here becauſe the
laſt denomination on the right hand is od, that is to ſay fifts, you
muſt therefore ſet downe next vnto it towards the right hand a
Cypher hauing ouer his head the next denomination which is vi.
and is euen, wherefore ſet your firſt pricke vnder that Cypher and
ſo procéede towards your left hand pricking euery other number,
and then worke as followeth.

A. B. for 3. and 2. which ſhould ſtand in
one ſelfe ſquare Angle next vnto the line
A. B. for thoſe onely are ſquare numbers, and not finding it amongſt
the ſquare numbers, take that ſquare which is nigheſt vnto
it and leſſe, which you ſhall find to be 2. and 49. the roote whereof
is 13. and is to be found as well in the foote of the Trapezium
right vnder the foreſaid ſquare number, as alſo in the outermoſt
collum of the ſaid Trapezium on the left hand ſtanding right againſt
the ſame ſquare number, which roote is to be ſet in the quotient
line, that done, ſubtract the foreſaid ſquare number out of the
number ſtanding right ouer the laſt pricke on ye left hand which is
3. and 2. and the remainder will be 13. which is to be ſet ouer 2.

and the 3. and 2. to be cancelled as you ſée in the former example,
that done, double the foreſaid found roote 13. which wil make 26.
by which you haue to diuide 13. and 9. wherefore reſorte to the
Trapezium, in the foote whereof you ſhall find 26. in whoſe collum
not finding 13. and 9. take that which is nigheſt vnto it and leſſe,
which is 13. and 0. right againſt which you ſhall find in the outermoſt
collum on the right hand 30. which ſhould be your quotient,
but becauſe it is too great and that the ſquare thereof cannot bée
taken out of the remainder, you muſt make the quotient one leſſe,
and ſet in the quotient line no more but 29. by which 29. if you
multiply 26. the product will bee 12. and 34. as the Trapezium
ſheweth, which being ſubtracted out of 13. and 9, ſtanding ouer
26. the remainder will be 35. which 35. is to bee ſet ouer 9. then
by multiplying the ſecond quotient which is 29. into it ſelfe, you
ſhall find by the Trapezium the product to be 14. and 1. which
being ſubtracted out of 35. and 17. the remainder will be 21. and
16. which is to be ſet ouer 35. and 17. as you ſée in this example.
                     
                        〈 math 〉
                     
                     That done, double bothe the
quotients or whole roote, and
the product will be 26. 58. and
hauing ſet 58. vnder 8. and 26.
vnder 16. diuide 21. 16. and 8
by 26. 58. wherefore looke for
26. in the foote of the Trapezium,
and for 21. 16. in that collum, and not finding it there, take
that which is nigheſt vnto it and leſſe, which you ſhall find to be 21
and 14, and right againſt that in the outermoſt collum on the
right hand ſtandeth 49. which being too great to be your quotient
by 2. therefore make your quotient no more but 47. which being
ſet downe in the quotient line, multiply thereby 26. 58. and the
product will be 21. 7. 26. which being ſubtracted out of 21. 16.
and 8. the remainder will be 8. and 42. then ſetting 42. ouer 8.
and 8. ouer 16. cancell 21. 16. and 8. then multiply 47. into it
ſelfe ſquarely, and you ſhall finde the product thereof in the Triangle
to be 36. 49. which being ſubtracted out of 8. 42. and 0.
the remainder will be 8. 6. 11. as you ſée in this example.
                     
                        
                        
                           〈 math 〉
                         And thus you
haue found the roote
of your giuen number
to be 13. 29 and
47. and whether
you haue done rightly
or not, you may
know by multiplying
the ſaid roote into it ſelfe ſquarely, and by adding to the product
thereof the remainder, and if you would finde a more exact
roote, then adde more Cyphers to your giuen number towardes
your right hand, together with their denominations ouer their
heads as they encreaſe ſucceſſiuely, and be ſure alwaies that the
number of the Cyphers bee euen and not odde as 2. 4. 6. and ſo
forth, & the more Cyphers that you adde to the giuen number (ſo
as the number of them be euen) the more exact roote you ſhal haue.
                     Now to giue to euery number of the roote his proper denomination,
do thus, take halfe of thoſe denominations that are ouer
euery pricke, and thoſe ſhall be the denominations of the roote, as
in the former example, whereas ſeconds doe ſtand ouer the laſt
pricke on the left hand take halfe of that which is 1′· wherefore the
firſt number of your roote muſt be minutes, and ouer the reſt of the
numbers of the roote ſet ſeconds, thirds and ſo forth
ſucceſſiuely vntill you haue brought your
roote to as ſmall denominations
as you deſire.

                  THE DESCRIPTION
and vſe of the Table
of Synes.
                  
                     BEcauſe there is no proportion, compariſon,
or likenes betwixt a right line and a
crooked, the auntient Philoſophers, as
Ptolomey and diuers other, were much
troubled in ſéeking to know the meaſures
of a Circle or of any portion thereof by his
Diameter, and by knowing the Diameter
to find out the length of any chorde in a
circle, which is alwaies leſſer then the Diameter it ſelfe, and finding
that the more parts whereinto the Diameter was diuided,
the nearer they approched to the truth: Some of them therefore,
as Ptolomey, diuided the Diameter of a circle into 120. parts,
and the Semidiameter into 60. parts, and euery ſuch part into
60′· and euery minute into 60. ſeconds &c. And in like manner did
Arzahel, an auntient Arabian, who diuided the Diameter into
300. parts and the Semidiameter into 150. and euery of thoſe
parts into 60′· and ſo forth as before, according to which computation
they made their tables: but becauſe the working by thoſe
tables was very tedious and troubleſome, by reaſon that it was
néedfull continually to vſe the art of numbring by Aſtronomicall
Fractions: therefore Georgius Purbachius, and Regio montanus
his Scholer to auoide that trouble of calculating by Aſtronomicall
Fractions, diuided the Diameter of a Circle into a farre
greater number of parts, and made ſuch tables as are vſed at this
preſent, the deſcription and vſe whereof doth hereafter follow,
firſt of thoſe that are ſet downe by Monte Regio in Folio, and
then of thoſe that were lately Corrected and made perfect by Clauius
the Ieſuite which are Printed in quarto.
                  
                     
And becauſe that the way to find out the proportion which any
chord hath to the whole Diameter, was very hard, therefore the
ſaid Purbachius and Monte Regio hauing direction from certaine
propoſitions of Euclyd, as from the 47. propoſition of his
firſt booke, and from the third propoſition of his third booke, and
alſo from the 15. propoſition of his fift booke, they made choiſe of
the halfe chord and Semidiameter of the Circle, calling the halfe
chord, Sinum rectum, and the Semidiameter Sinum totum. And
becauſe that the proportion of any circumference to his Diameter
neuer changeth, how great or how little ſo euer the Circle be: after
that they had calculated for one Circle, they made ſuch tables
as might ſerue for all Circles, and though theſe tables of ſines
doe ſuffice to worke thereby all manner of concluſions, as well of
Aſtronomie, as of Geometrie, yet for more eaſe, our moderne
Geometricians haue of late inuented two other right lines belonging
to a Circle called lines Tangent, and lines Secant, and
haue made like tables for them that were made for ſines, and both
tables, that is to ſay as well of the ſines, as of the lines Tangent
and Secant, haue one ſelfe manner of working thereby, as ſhall
plainely appeare hereafter when wee come to deſcribe the ſame.
But firſt we will beginne with the tables of ſines, and plainely define
euery terme or vocable of Art, belonging thereunto: The
termes are theſe here following: An arch, a Chord, Sinus rectus
Sinus verſus, Quadrans, Complementum, and ſinus Complementi.
                  
                  
                     The definitions of the foreſaid tearmes.
                     AN Arch is any part or portion of the circumference of a Circle,
which in this practiſe doth not commonly extend beyond
180. degrées which is one halfe of the circumference of any Circle
how great or ſmall ſo euer it be, for euery Circle containeth 360
degrées.
                     A Chord is a right line drawne from one end of the Arch to
the other end thereof, and note that all chordes are alwaies leſſer
then the Diameter it ſelfe, for that is the greateſt chord in any
Circle.
                     
                        Sinus rectus is the one halfe of a Chord or ſtring of any Arke

which is double to the Arke that is geuen or ſuppoſed, and falleth
with right Angles vpon yt Semidiameter which diuideth the double
Arke into two equall parts.
                     
                        Sinus verſus that is to ſay turned the contrary way, is a right
line, and that part of the Semidiamiter, which is intercepted betwixt
the beginning of the giuen Arke and the right Sine of the
ſame Arke, and this is alſo called in Latine Sagitta, in Engliſh a
Shaft or Arrowe, for the Demonſtratiue figure thereof hereafter
following, is not vnlike to the ſtring of a bowe ready bent hauing
a Shaft in the midſt thereof.
                     
                        Quadrans is the fourth part of a Circle containing 90. degrées.
                     
                        Complementum arcus, is that portion of the Circle, which
ſheweth how much the giuen Arke is leſſer then the quadrant, if
the giuen Arke doe containe fewer degrées then the Quadrant,
but if it containe more degrées then the Quadrant, then the difference
betwixt ſuch giuen arch, and the halfe Circle is the complement
of the ſaid giuen Arke.
                     
                        Sinus complementi, is the right Sine of that Arch which is
the complement of the giuen Arke.
                     
                        Sinus totus, is the Semidiamiter of the Circle, & is the greateſt
Sine that may be in the Quadrant of a Circle, which according
to the firſt tables of Monte Regio containeth 6/000/000.
and according to the laſt tables 10/000/000 parts, for the more
parts that the totall Sine hath, the more true and exact ſhall your
worke be, notwithſtanding ſometime it ſhall ſuffice to attribute
vnto the totall Sine but 60/000. parts, which number Appian
obſerueth in teaching the way to find out the diſtance of two places
differing both in Longitude and Latitude by the tables of
Sines, and ſome doe make the totall Sine to containe 100/000
parts, as Wittikindus in his treatiſe of Dials, and diuers other
doe the like. Alſo Clauius himſelfe ſaith that in the tables ſet
downe by him in quarto, you may ſometime make the totall Sine
to be but 100/000. ſo as you cut off the two laſt figures on the
right hand in euery Sine, but you ſhall better vnderſtand euery
thing here aboue mentioned, by the figure Demonſtratiue here
following.
                     
                        
                        
                           The figure Demonſtratiue.
                        
                     
                     In this figure
you ſée firſt a whol
Circle drawne vpon
the Centre E.
and marked with
the letters A. B. C
D. which Circle
by two croſſe Diameters
marked
with the letters A
C. and B. D. & paſſing
both through
the Centre E. is diuided
into foure
Quadrantes or
quarters, the vpper
Quadrante
whereof on the left hand is marked with the letters A. B. E. in
which Quadrant, the right perpendicular line marked with the
letters F. H. betokeneth the right Sine of the giuen Arke A. F.
which right Sine is the one halfe of the chord or ſtring F. G. and
the giuen Arke A. F. is the one halfe of the double Arke or bowe
G. A. F. and A. H. is the Shaft called in Latine Sinus verſus:
Againe the letters F. B. doe ſhew the complement which together
with the giuen Arke A. F. doe make the whole Quadrant A. F. B
which is diuided into 9. ſpaces, euery ſpace cōtaining 10. degrées,
whereby you may plainely perceiue that in this demonſtration,
the giuen Arke A. F. is 50. degrées, and the complement F. B. is
40. degrées, both which being added together doe make vp the
whole Quadrant of 90. degrées, marked with the letters A. F. B.
Now Sinus complementi is the croſſe line marked with the letters
F. K. the totall Sine which is the whole Semidiameter and
greateſt right Sine, is marked with the letters B. E. But becauſe
it is not enough to know the ſignification of the things aboue ſpecified
to vſe the foreſaid tables when néede is, vnleſſe you know

alſo how to find out thoſe things in the ſaid tables, I thinke it good
therefore to ſhew you the order of the ſaid tables by deſcribing the
ſame as followeth.
                     You haue then to vnderſtand that the tables of Monte Regio
printed in Folio, are contained in 18. Pages, and euery Page
containeth eleauen partitions, called collums, whereof the firſt on
the left hand containeth 60. minutes, which are to be counted from
head to foote, as they ſtand in order one right vnder another in ſeuerall
places, procéeding from 1. to 60. The ſecond collum containeth
Sines. The third containeth onely a portion or part of
one ſecond, and from thence forth procéeding towards the right
hand all the other collums doe containe in like manner Sines and
the portion of one ſecond. And right ouer the head of euery Sine
(the firſt collum of Sines onely excepted, hauing nothing but a
Cypher ouer his head) are ſet downe the degrées of the whole
Quadrant called arches, in ſuch order as from the firſt Page to
the laſt, there are in all 89. degrées, or arches, as by peruſing the
ſaid tables you may plainely ſée. Now to find out in theſe tables
the things aboue mentioned, you muſt doe as followeth.
                     Firſt to find out the right Sine of any giuen Arke, you muſt
ſéeke out the number of the ſaid Arke in the front of the tables, and
if the giuen Arke hath no minutes ioyned thereunto, then the firſt
number of Sines right vnder the ſaid Arke, is the right Sine
thereof. But if it hath any minutes ioyned thereunto, then you
muſt ſéeke out in that Page, where you found the giuen Arke, the
number of the minutes in the firſt collum of the ſaid Page, on the
left hand, and right againſt thoſe minutes on the right hand, in
the ſquare Angle right vnder the ſaid arch, you ſhall find the right
Sine. As for example, you would find out the right Sine of a giuen
Arke containing 8. degrées, and 20′· here hauing found out
in the front of the ſecond Page the figure of 8. ſtanding right ouer
the eight collum, ſéeke in the firſt collum on the left hand of the ſaid
Page, for 20. minutes, and right againſt the 20. minutes you
ſhall find on the right hand in the common Angle or ſquare 8695
93. which is the right Sine of the foreſaid giuen Arke, ſo as you
make 6/000/000. to be the totall Sine: but if you make 60/000.
the totall Sine, then you muſt alwaies reiect the two laſt figures
ſtanding on the right hand of the ſaid right Sine, and the reſt of
the figures ſhall be the right Sine.
                     
                        
Now to find out the complement, there is nothing to be done,
but onely to ſubtract the giuen Arke out of the whole Quadrant
which is 90. degrées, and the remainder ſhall be the complement:
as in the former example by ſubtracting 8. degrées, 20′· out of 90
degrées, you find that there remaineth 81. degrées, 40′· which is
the complement of that arch. Againe to find out the Sine of the
complement you muſt doe thus, ſéeke the complement in the front
of the tables of Sines, euen as you doe to find out any giuen arke:
as in the former example, the complement being 81. degrées 40′·
you muſt ſéeke 81. in the front of the 17. Page of the firſt tables,
which being found, ſéeke out alſo the 40′· in the firſt collum of the
ſaid Page on the left hand, and right againſt thoſe 40′· in the common
Angle right vnder the Arke 81. you ſhall find 5/936/649.
which number is the right Sine of the foreſaid complement, ſo as
you make 6/000/000. to be the totall Sine, for if 60/000. be the
total Sine, then you muſt reiect (as I ſaid before) the two laſt figures
on the right hand, and the number remaining ſhall be the
right Sine of the foreſaid complement, and therefore in working
by theſe tables, you muſt alwaies remember what number you
make the totall Sine to be.
                     
                        Sinus verſus commeth ſeldome in vſe, notwithſtanding if you
would know how to find it out, you néede to doe no more but to ſubtract
Sinum complementi of the giuen Arke, out of the totall
Sine, and the remainder ſhall be Sinus verſus, as in the former
example your Sinus complementi was 5/936/649. which being
ſubtracted out of the totall Sine 6/000/000. there remaineth
this 63/351. and that number is Sinus verſus: for if you adde this
remainder to the number which you ſubtracted, it will make vp
the totall Sine 6/000/000. But there is one thing more neceſſarie
to be knowen then this, becauſe it commeth oftner in vſe, and
that is vpon ſome diuiſion made how to find out the Arke of any
quotient, which is to be done thus: Enter with the quotient into
the body of the tables, and leaue not ſéeking amongſt the ſquares
of the Sines, vntill you haue found out the iuſt number of the quotient
(if it be there) if not, you muſt take the number of that Sine
which is in value moſt nigh vnto it, whether it be a little more or
leſſe, it maketh no matter, and hauing found that number, looke in
the front of that collum, and you ſhall find the Arke of your quotient,

ſtanding right ouer the head of that collum, and alſo the mynutes
thereof in the firſt collum of the ſaid Page on the left hand.
As for example, hauing diuided one number by another, I find
the quotient to be 469/012. whereof I would know the arch, now
in ſéeking this quotient amongſt the Sines, I can not find that
iuſt number, but I find in the firſt Page, and in the tenth collum
469/015. which is the nigheſt number vnto it that I can ſée. In
the front of which collum I find the Arke to be 4. degrées, and directly
againſt that Sine on the left hand, I find 29′· belonging to
that arch, whereof that quotient is the Sinus, ſo as I gather hereof
that the arch of the foreſaid quotient is 4, degrées, 29′· But you
haue to note by the way that the number of your quotient muſt neuer
be much leſſe then 1745. for otherwiſe it is not to be found in
theſe tables, vnleſſe you make the totall Sine to be but 60/000.
for then by reiecting the laſt two figures on the right hand, as I
haue ſaid before, the firſt right Sine of theſe tables ſhal be no more
but 17. and by that account a very ſmall quotient may be found in
theſe tables. And whatſoeuer hath béene ſaid here touching the order
that is to be obſerued in the firſt tables of Monte Regio, whoſe
totall Sine is 6/000/000. the like in all points is to be obſerued
in the laſt tables, whoſe totall Sine is 10/000/000. Thus much
touching the order of the foreſaid tables of Monte Regio Printed
in Folio: but for ſo much as thoſe tables bee not altogether truely
Printed, and for that they haue béene lately corrected, and made
more perfect by Clauius, who doth ſet downe the ſaid tables in
quarto and not in folio, whereby they are the more portable, and
the more commodious, as well for that they are more truely Printed,
as alſo for that the complement of euery Arke is ſet downe in
euery Page at the foote of euery collum, ſo as you néed to ſpend no
time in ſubtracting the Arke from 90. I thinke it good therefore
to make a briefe deſcription of thoſe tables, and the rather for
that I haue requeſted the Printer to print the like here in quarto,
and I doe worke all ſuch concluſions as hereafter follow, by the
ſaid tables, the totall Sine whereof is 10/000/000. according to
the laſt tables of Monte Regio. But for ſo much as ſome may
haue already the tables of Monte Regio Printed in Folio, not
knowing perhaps the vſe thereof, I will ſet downe two concluſions
to bee wrought by thoſe tables, and all the reſt of the concluſions

are to be wrought by thoſe tables which I haue here cauſed to
be Printed in quarto like to thoſe of Clauius: and though the two
concluſions next following, which are to ſhew the vſe of the foreſaid
tables, may be wrought by the tables of Sines in what forme
ſo euer they be truely Printed if Folio, or in quarto, yet becauſe I
had appointed them to bee done by the tables of Monte Regio,
Printed in folio before that euer I ſaw Clauius his booke, I mind
not now to alter them but to let them ſtand ſtill as they are.
                  
                  
                     How to find out by the ſaid tables, the diſtance betwixt two
places differing both in Longitude and Latitude, making
the totall Sine to be no more but 60/000.
                     THis is done by finding out two numbers, whereof the one is
called in Latine Primum inuentum: that is to ſay, the firſt
found number, and the other is called Secundum inuentum, that
is the ſecond found number in ſuch order as followeth.
                     Firſt then knowing the Longitude of either place, take the
differēce of their Longitudes by ſubtracting the leſſer Longitude
out of the greater, that done, multiply the right Sine of that difference
into the Sine of the complement of the leſſer Latitude,
and diuide the product of that Multiplycation by the totall Sine,
and then ſéeke out the arch of that quotient according to the rule
before taught, ſo ſhall you haue the firſt found number: That done,
multiply the right Sine of the leſſer Latitude by the totall Sine,
and hauing diuided the product thereof by the right Sine of the
complement of the firſt found number, ſubtract the arch of that
quotient out of the greater Latitude, and you ſhall haue the ſecond
found number. Then multiply the right Sine of the complement
of the firſt found number into the right Sine of the complement of
the ſecond found number, and hauing diuided the product of that
Multiplycation by the totall Sine, ſéeke the Arke of that quotient
in the tables, and take that Arke out of the whole Quadrant, and
the degrées that doe remaine, are degrées of the great Circle,
which if you multiply by 60. the product of yt Multiplycation will
ſhew you how many Italian miles the one place is diſtant from the
other, or if you would haue Germane miles, thē multiply the foreſaid
degrées of the great Circle by 15. or elſe diuide the product

of the Italian miles by 4. and you ſhall haue your deſire. As for
example, you would know what diſtance is betwixt Hieruſalem
and Noremberg a famous towne in Germanie, Hieruſalem according
to Appian his tables, hath in Longitude 66. degrées 0′·
and in Latitude 31. degrées, 40′· Againe Noremberg hath in
Longitude 28. degrées, 20′· and in Latitude 49. degrées, 24′·
the difference of their Longitudes is 37. degrées, 40′· the right
Sine wherof is 36/664. for in this example Appian maketh 60/000.
to be the total Sine, and therefore he reiecteth the two laſt figures
en the right hand found in the firſt tables of Monte Regio.
Now you muſt multiply 36/664. into the right Sine of the complement
of the leſſer Latitude which Sine is 51/067. the product
of which two Sines being multiplyed the one by the other, amounteth
to 1/872/320/488. which if you diuide by the totall Sine.
60/000. you ſhall find in the quotient 31/205. whoſe arch is 31.
degrées, 20′· and this ſhall be your firſt found number. This done,
multiply the right Sine of the leſſer Latitude which is 31/498.
by the totall Sine 60/000. and the product thereof wil be 1/889/
880/000. which ſumme if you diuide by the Sine of the complement
of the firſt found number which Sine is 51/249. you ſhall
find in the quotient 36876. the Arke whereof is 37. degrées 55′·
which arch being ſubtracted out of the greater Latitude, there
will remaine 11. degrées, 29′· and that ſhall be your ſecond found
number, then multiply the foreſaid Sine of the complement of the
firſt found number which is 51/249. by the Sine of the complement
of the ſecond found number which is 58/798. and the product
thereof will amount to 3/013/338/702. which if you diuide
by the totall Sine, you ſhall find in the quotient 50/222. the arch
whereof is 56. degrées, 50′· which being ſubtracted out of the
whole Quadrant which is 90. degrées, there will remaine 33. degrées,
10′· of the greater Circle, which 33. degrées, if you multiply
by 60. it will make 1980. miles, whereunto you muſt adde
for the 10′· 10. miles, ſo ſhall you find the diſtance betwixt the two
foreſaid places to be 1990. Italian miles, which if you would reduce
into Germaine miles, then diuide that number by 4. for 4.
Italian miles doe make but one Germaine mile, ſo ſhall you haue
497. Germaine miles, and two Italian miles remaining, which
is halfe a Germaine mile, which ſumme agréeth with that which

                        Appian ſetteth downe in his Geographie, whereas he vſeth the
ſelfe ſame example, and worketh it in like manner Per tabulas
ſinuum.
                     
                  
                  
                     The Altitude of the ſunne being knowne how to find out the
Longitude of the ſhadow both right and verſe of any body
yeelding ſhadow by helpe of the foreſaid tables.
                     FIrſt you haue to vnderſtand that euery bodily thing yéelding
ſhadow, is diuided into 12. equall partes, and euery ſuch part
into 60. minuts, and euery minute into 60. ſeconds, and ſo forth:
Againe, of ſhadowes there be 2. kindes, that is, Vmbra recta,
and Vmbra verſa, Vmbra recta is that which procéedeth from
ſome bodie rightly erected vpon the vpper face of the Horizon, as
from ſome tower or poſt ſtanding right vp vpon a leauel ground:
And that ſhadowe is called vmbra verſa which procéedeth from
ſome right ſtyle or pearch being thruſt into a wall or poſt ſtanding
right vp and not leaning, in ſuch ſort as the ſayd ſtyle or pearch
may be a iuſt paralell to the vpper face of the Horizon. Now to
find out the length of either the foreſaid ſhadowes, you muſt doe
thus.
                     Multiply the right Sine of the complement of the giuen Solar
altitude, by 12. and diuide the product by the right Sine of the
ſaid Solar altitude, and you ſhall haue the Longitude of the right
ſhadow of the ſaid body. Againe if you multiply the right Sine of
the foreſaid altitude by 12. and diuide the product by the Sine of
the complement of the ſaid altitude, you ſhall haue the Longitude
of Vmbra verſa, of the ſaid body. As for example, ſuppoſe the
giuen Solar altitude to be 25. degrées, the complement wherof is
65. and the right Sine of that complement is 54/378. if you
make the totall Sine to be 60/000. Then in multiplying the foreſaid
right Sine by 12. the product will be 652/536. which if you
diuide by the Sine of the altitude which is 25/357. you ſhall find
the Longitude of Vmbra recta to be 25. parts 44′ 42″ and 6‴· Now
if you multiply the Sine of the altitude which is 25/357. by 12.
and diuide the product by the Sine of the complement which is
54/378. you ſhall find the Longitude of Vmbra verſa to bee 5.
parts, 35′· and in ſaying here parts, I meane alwaies ſuch parts

as are the 12. parts, whereinto the body yéelding ſhadow is diuided:
but if you worke this example by the firſt tables of Sines making
the totall Sine 6/000/000. though you finde it true in the
parts and minutes, yet ſhall you not find it ſo in the ſeconds and
thirds, and if you worke the ſame by the ſecond tables making the
totall Sine 10/000/000. you ſhal find it to agrée only in the parts,
but neither in minutes nor ſecondes, which maketh me to ſuſpect
that the Printer hath committed ſome error therein, for both the
tables were made by one ſelfe rule.
                  
                  
                     A briefe deſcription of the tables of Sines Printed in quarto
like vnto thoſe which Clauius ſetteth down in his commentaries
vpon Theodoſius his Spheriques.
                     HAuing heere before plainely deſcribed vnto you the tables of
Sines made by Monte Regio, which are Printed in folio, and
how to vſe the ſame I will now briefly deſcribe the ſaid tables lately
corrected by Clauius, and were Printed in quarto at Rome
Anno 1586. the totall Sine of which tables according to the laſt
table of Monte Regio, is 10/000/000. by which tables are to be
wrought all the concluſions hereafter following.
                     Firſt then you haue to vnderſtand that theſe tables are contained
in 36. Pages, in the front whereof are ſet downe the degrées of
the Quadrant procéeding from 1. to 89. but becauſe the whole
number of minutes belonging to the ſaid degrées, which is 60′·
can not be all placed in one ſelfe Page, but onely 30′· in the left
outermoſt collum of the left hand Page: and other 30′· in the left
outermoſt collum of the right hand Page: therefore the degrées or
arches of the Quadrant are faine to be twice repeated in the front
of euery two Pages, as you may plainely ſée by viewing the ſaid
tables, and euery Page containeth ſeauen collums, whereof the
firſt on the left hand containeth the minutes belonging to the degrées
or arches of the Quadrant, which minutes do procéed downward
from 1. to 30′· and the ſeauenth collum on the right hand in
euery Page containeth the minutes belonging to the complement
of euery arch, which minutes doe procéede backward, that is to ſay
from 1. ſet downe at the loweſt end of the laſt collum of the ſecond
Page, and ſo procéeding vpward to 30′· which 30′· is alſo ſet

downe at the loweſt end of the laſt collum of the left hand Page,
and ſo procéedeth vpward to 60′· which 60. minutes doe helpe to
make vp the complement that is anſwerable to euery arch wherevnto
no minutes be annexed, for if the arch hath no minutes, then
you muſt adde to the complement thereof 60. minutes, which is
one whole degrée, to make vp the complement. As for example,
ſuppoſe the Arke to be 46. degrées, without any minutes ioyned
thereunto, the complement whereof ſet downe at the foote of the
ſaid arch, is but 43. degrées, wherefore you muſt adde thereunto
60′· which is one degrée, ſo ſhall the complement be 44. degrées,
which is the true complement indéede, but if you ſuppoſe the foreſaid
Arke to haue 13′· ioyned thereunto you ſhall find the complement
to be 43. degrées, 47′· which is anſwerable to the foreſaid
Arke 46. degrées, and 13′· for if you take 46. degrées, 13′· out of
90. degrées, the remainder will be 43. degrées, 47′· which is the
complement, ſo as you néed not to make any Subtraction out of
90. to find the complement of any arch, that hath any minutes annexed
thereunto: but when ſo euer you haue to find out the right
Sine of any complement in theſe tables, you muſt then make the
complement an arch, ſéeking for the ſame in the front and not at
the foote of the tables, & if the ſaid complement haue any minutes
annexed thereunto, you muſt ſéeke thoſe minutes in the left outermoſt
collum of euery Page, and not in the outermoſt right collum
belonging to complements, for in this caſe the complement is an
arch and not a complement. The order of working by theſe tables
in all other things differeth not one iotte from that which we haue
obſerued in working the two former concluſions by the tables of
Monte Regio Printed in folio, as you ſhall eaſily perceiue by the
examples here following.
                  
                  
                     1 How to find out the declination of the Sunne at any time
his place in the Zodiaque being giuen, Per tabulas Sinuum.
                     KNowing the place of the Sun for the day, conſider how much
the ſaid place is diſtant from the firſt point of Aries if the place
of the Sunne be nigher to Aries then to Libra. But if it be nigher
to Libra, then take his diſtance from the firſt point of Libra, which
diſtance muſt not excéede 90. degrées, and ſéeke that diſtance amongſt

the Arkes in the front of the tables if they bee degrées, if
minutes, you ſhall find them in the firſt collum on the left hand,
then multiply the Sine of that diſtance by the Sine of the greateſt
declination which is 23. degrées, 28′· and diuide the product therof
by the totall Sine, and the quotient will ſhew you the Sine of the
declination for that day, the arch whereof, is the very number
of the declination it ſelfe. As for example, you would know the
declination of the Sunne the eleauenth of Aprill 1591. when as
the Sunne was entred 33′· into Taurus vnto which you muſt
adde according to the rule before giuen 30. degrées, for that is his
diſtance from the firſt point of Aries, then ſéeke out the ſaid 30.
degrées, in the front of the laſt tables among the Arkes and the 33′
in the firſt collum on the left hand right againſt which you ſhall
find the Sine of the ſaid diſtance to bee 5082/901. which being
multiplyed by 3/982/155. (which is the Sine of the greateſt declination)
the product thereof will be 20/240/890/631/655. which
if you diuide by the totall Sine which is 10/000/000. you ſhall
find the quotient to be 2/024/089. which quotient muſt be ſought
out in the ſaid tables, and if you find no ſuch number, then take
the neareſt number thereunto, which is 2025025. and the Arke
thereof together with the minutes that ſtand right againſt the ſaid
quotient in the firſt collum on the left hand, is the declination of
the Sunne for that day which is 11. degrées, 41′·
                  
                  
                     2 How to know the right aſcention of the Sunne, Per
tabulas Sinuum.
                     FIrſt knowing the Sunnes place, you ſhall learne the right aſcention
thereof thus. Firſt conſider how farre his place is from
the Equinoctiall point, as is ſaid before in the laſt propoſition,
and multiply the Sine of the complement of that diſtance by the
totall Sine, then knowing the declination of the Sunne for that
day by the laſt rule, deuide the former product by the Sine of the
complement of the ſaid declination, and the quotient will ſhew the
Sine of that Arke whereof the complement is the right aſcention.
As for example, the Sunne being in the 33′· of Taurus and his declination
11. degrées, 41′· as you found by the laſt propoſition and
his diſtance from the firſt point of Aries to be in all 30. degrées, 33′

the complement whereof is 59. degrées, 27′· the Sine of which
complement is 8/611/860. which being multiplyed by the totall
Sine which is 10/000/000. the product will be 86/118/600/
000/000. which being diuided by the Sine of the complement of
the Sunnes declination which is 78. degrées, 19′· whoſe Sine
is 9792818. by which Sine if you diuide the former product, the
quotient will be 8/773/600. the Arke of which quotient is 61.
degrées, and 19′· and the complement of that, is 28. degrées, and
41′· which is the right aſcention of the place of the Sunne for the
foreſaid day.
                     And here note that if the Arke from Aries to the giuen pointe,
doe containe iuſt 90. degrées, the right aſcention thereof is alſo
90. degrées, but if the ſaid Arke be more then 90. degrées, and
leſſer then 180. degrées, then ſubtract the ſame out of 180. and
ſéeke out the right aſcention of the remainder as before, whoſe
right aſcention if you take out of 180. the remainder ſhall be the
aſcention of the propounded Arke. But if the ſaid arch which is
comprehended betwixt Aries and the giuen pointe bee greater
then 180. degrées, or 6. ſignes, and leſſer then 270. degrées, or
9. ſignes, then hauing ſubtracted 180. degrées from the ſame
arch, calculate the right aſcention of the arch from the beginning
of Libra, as before, and the right aſcention thereof being added to
180. degrées, ſhall be the aſcention deſired.
                     Laſtly if the arch comprehended betwixt Aries and the pointe
giuen, be greater then 270. degrées, or 9. ſignes, then ſubtract the
ſame out of 360. degrées, and ſéeke out the right aſcention of that
remainder as before, which if you ſubtract out of 360. degrées,
the remainder ſhall be the right aſcention deſired.
                  
                  
                     3 How to finde out the aſcentionall difference, Per tabulas
Sinuum.
                     MVltiply the Sine of the Latitude giuen by the total Sine, and
diuide the product by the complement of ye ſaid Latitude, that
done, multiply the quotient by the Sine of the Sunnes declinatiō,
and diuide the product by the Sine of the complement of the declination,
and the quotient thereof wil ſhew the ſigne of the aſcentionall
difference: and by working according to this rule, you ſhal find

that when the Sunne is entred 33′· into Taurus, at which time his
declination is 11. degrées, 41′· (as hath béene ſaid before) the aſcention
all difference will be 15. degrées, 21′· And here note that
the aſcentional differences for one quarter of ye Circle ſerueth alſo
for all the reſt, ſo that the Latitude be not altered, and that the declination
of the pointes in the later quarters be equall to the declination
of the points in the firſt quarter.
                  
                  
                     4 How to find out the oblique aſcention of any pointe of
the Ecliptique in any Latitude aſsigned.
                     FIrſt find the right aſcention of the giuen pointe by the ſecond
propoſition, & alſo the aſcentional difference thereof by the third
propoſition: then conſider whether the declination of the ſaid point
be Northward or Southward, for if it be Northward, then ſubtract
the aſcentionall difference out of the right aſcention, and the remainder
ſhall be the oblique aſcention deſired: but if the declination
be Southward, then adde the aſcentionall difference vnto the
right aſcention, and the ſumme ſhall be the oblique aſcention. In
working thus for the Latitude 52. and ſuppoſing the Sunne to be
in ye 33′· of Taurus, & hauing found by the former propoſition his
right aſcention to be 28. degrées, 41′· and the aſcentionall difference
to be 15. degrées, 21′· you ſhall find his oblique aſcention in
the foreſaid Latitude to be 13. degrées, 20′·
                  
                  
                     5 How to finde out the time of the Sunnes riſing and ſetand
thereby the length of the artificial day.
                     FIrſt you muſt know the aſcentionall difference, and conuert the
ſame into howers & minutes, then if the Sunne be in any of the
Northern ſignes, adde thoſe howers to 6. howers which is the one
halfe of an Equinoctiall day, and the ſumme of ſuch Addition ſhall
be the one halfe of the artificial day, which being ſubtracted out of
12. howers, the remainder ſhal be the hower of the Sunnes riſing:
As for example, the Sunne being in the 33′· of Taurus, you found
the aſcention all difference to be 15. degrées, and 21′· which being
turned into howers maketh one hower 1′· 2″· and ſomewhat more,
which being added to 6. maketh 7. howers 1′· 2″· and a little more

which is the one halfe of the artificiall day which being doubled,
maketh in all 14. howers 2′· and 4″· but if the Sunne be in any
of the Southerne ſignes, you muſt remember to ſubtract ye howers
of the aſcentionall difference out of 6. howers, and the remainder
ſhall be the one halfe of the artificiall day, and by ſubtracting
the halfe length of the artificiall day out of 12. you ſhall know the
hower of the Sunnes riſing, and hauing the time of his riſing, you
muſt néeds know the time of his ſetting.
                  
                  
                     6 How to find out the Meridian altitude of the Sunne in
any day though he doth not ſhine at all, the eleuation of the
Pole being giuen.
                     SVbtract the eleuation of the pole from 90. and the remainder
ſhall be the eleuation of the Equinoctiall, then if the Sunne be
in any of the Northern ſignes, adde the declination of the Sunne,
vnto the altitude of the Equinoctiall, or elſe if he be in any of the
Southern ſignes, ſubtract the declination, and the ſumme of the
Addition, or remainder of the Subtraction, ſhal ſhew the Meridiā
altitude. As for example, the ſecond of May 1591. the Sunne being
in the 20. degrées, 42′· of Taurus, and his declination Northward
17. degrées, 56′· 21″· here by ſubtracting 52. degrées,
which is our Latitude from 90. you ſhall find the remainder to be
38. which is the altitude of the Equinoctiall, whereunto if you
adde the Sunnes declination for that day which is 17. degrées,
56′· and 21″· the ſumme will bee 55. degrées, 56′· and 21″· and
that is the Meridian altitude of the Sunne for that day.
                     Let theſe few concluſions ſerue to ſhew you the vſe of the tables
of Sines, for it would make a long booke to ſet downe ſo many
concluſions as are to be wrought by theſe tables, and therefore I
leaue to trouble you any further therewith, minding now briefly
to declare vnto you the vſe of the tables of lines Tangent & Secant
by one example or two as followeth. But firſt I thinke it neceſſary
to ſhew you what thoſe lines be, and whereto they ſerue.
                  
               
               
                  
                  THE DESCRIPTION
and vſe of the Tables of Tangents
and Secants.
                  
                     
                        EVclid in the ſecond propoſition of his
third booke defineth the line Tangent in
this ſort. A right line (ſaith hee) is ſaid to
touch a Circle when it toucheth it ſo, as
being drawne out in length, it would neuer
cut the ſaid Circle.
                  The line Secant is not by him any
wher defined, but what theſe two lines are,
you ſhal better vnderſtand by this figure Demonſtratiue here following,
then by any definition that can be made thereof: for a definition
ought to bee plaine and briefe, and not long, intricate or
doubtfull, which will be hardly performed in ſhewing the nature of
theſe two lines by way of definition, and therefore marke well this
figure following.
                  
                  In this figure you ſée firſt a
Circle drawne vpon the Centre
C. from which Centre is extended
to the circumference of
the Circle a right line, called
the Semidiameter, marked
with the letters A. C. then
there is another right line
which toucheth the ſaid Circle, and alſo the outermoſt end of the
ſaid Semidiameter making therewith a right Angle in the point
A. and is called the line Tangent, then there is a third line which
procéeding from the Centre C. doth cut the circumference of the
Circle in the point B. and alſo méeteth with the line Tangent in
the point D. and therefore is called the line Secant, betwixt which
two lines, I meane the Tangent and Secant, is intercepted
or included a certaine portion or arch of the foreſaide Circle

leſſe then a Quadrant marked with the letters A. B. of
which Arke the line A. D. is the Tangent, and the line C. D. is
the Secant thereof, which muſt néeds méete with the Tangent in
the point D. becauſe that the two Angles C. A. D. and D. C. A.
are leſſer then two right Angles, for the one is right, and the other
ſharpe, by reaſon that the Arke is leſſe then a Quadrant. And
ſome doe call the line Tangent the line Aſcript, becauſe it is aſcribed
to the Circle, and they call the line Secant the Hipothenuſe,
becauſe it ſubtēdeth the right Angle A. & they cal the Semidiameter
or total Sine, y• baſe of the rectangle Triangle C. A. D
which is called a rectangle Triangle becauſe it containeth one
right Angle marked with the letter A. and note yt whenſoeuer any
manner of Angle is propounded by thrée letters, that the middle
letter doth alwaies ſignifie the Angle propounded, be it right,
ſharpe, or blunt. Now if you would know to what end the foreſaid
two lines were inuented, & wherto they ſerue, you haue to vnderſtand
that they chiefly ſerue in calculating the quantitie of Angles
and their ſides, as well in right lined Triangles, as in ſphericall
Triangles, for the ſides of Triangles are either right or crooked,
and if they haue right ſides, ſuch Triangles are either right angled
Triangles, or oblique angled Triangles, and you haue to
note that the quantity of euery Angle is to be meaſured by the arch
of a Circle ſubtending that Angle, for the point of euery Angle is
imagined to be the Centre of a whole Circle, which you may ſuppoſe
to be ſo great or little as you will, for euery Circle (be it great
or little) is diuided into 360. degrées, and looke how many degrées
and minutes the arch ſubtending that Angle containeth, ſo much
is the quantitie of that Angle, the practiſe whereof is very well
ſet down by Clauius in his cōmentaries vpon Theodoſius, which
I mind (God willing) hereafter to tranſlate into our mother
tongue: In the meane time my intention here, is onely to ſhew
you by one example or two, the vſe of the tables made for the foreſaid
lines Tangent and Secant.
                  
                     The vſe of the ſaid tables according to Clauius, is thus.
                     IN ſéeking out the Tangent or Secant of any Arke giuen, or of
the complement of any Arke by either of theſe tables, you haue to

obſerue the ſelfe ſame order which you did before in finding out the
right Sine of any Arke giuen, or of the complement of any Arke,
Per tabulas ſinuum. As for example, if you would find out the
Tangent of an Arke containing 50. degrées, 24′· then reſorte to
the table of Tangents in the front, whereof looke firſt for the Arke
50. degrées, and then in the firſt collum on the left hand of the ſaid
table, for 24′· right againſt which on the right hand vnder the Arke
50. you ſhall find in the cōmon Angle the Tangent to be 12/087/
923. the totall Sine whereof is 10/000/000. but if you would
find out the Secant of the foreſaid Arke 50. and 24′· then you muſt
reſort to the table of Secants, and hauing found out the Arke 50.
in the front of the ſaid tables, and the 24′· on the left hand as before,
you ſhall find in the common Angle the Secant to be 15688144.
And if you would haue the Tangent of the complement of the
ſaid Arke which is 39. degrées, and 36′· you ſhall find the 39. degrées
of the cōplement in the foote of the table of Tangents right
vnder the Arke 50. & the 36′·. in the outermoſt collum on the right
hand of the ſaid table, with which complement you muſt enter the
table of Tangents, ſéeking for 39. degrées in the front of the table,
and 36′· in the firſt collum on the left hand of the ſaid table, right
againſt which in the common Angle you ſhall find 8272720. to be
the Tangent of 39. degrées, 36′· which is the complement of 50
degrées, 24′·
                     And you muſt work in like manner with the table of Secants:
As for example, if you would find the Secant of 72. degrées, 36′·
firſt then enter the table of Secants, looking for 72. degrees aboue
in the front of the table, and 36′· in the firſt collum on the left
hand of the ſaid table, and in the common Angle you ſhall find 33/
440/240. which is the Secant of 72. degrees, 36′· But if you
would haue the Secant of the complement of the ſaid arch 72. degrees,
36′· then looking in the foote of the table right vnder 72.
degrees, you ſhall find 17. degrees, and in the outermoſt collum
on the right hand, iuſt againſt 36′· you ſhall find 24′· ſo as you ſee
that 17. degrees 24′· is the complement of 72. degrees, 36′· with
which complement you muſt enter the table of Secants, looking
for 17. degrees, aboue in the front of the table, and for 24′· in the
firſt collum on the left hand of the ſaid tables, & in the common Angle
you ſhall find 10/479/542. to bee the Secant of the arch 17.

degrees, 24′· which is the complement of the arch 72. degrees,
36′·
                  
                  
                     The vſe of which tables in Aſtronomicall
matters, I haue here ſet downe
as followeth.
                     
                        1 To find out the declination of the Sunne, the place
thereof being knowne.
                        
                           MVltiply the Secant of the complement of
the greateſt declination by the totall ſine,
and diuide the product by the ſine of the
ſunnes diſtance from one of the equinoctiall
points, the quotient is the Secant of an
arch, whoſe complement is the declination
of the ſunne: for example, ſuppoſe that the
ſunne be entering into ♉ to finde the declination
therof, firſt I multiply 25112030
the Secant of 66. degrées 32′· (which is the complement of 23.
degrées 38′ the greateſt declination) by 10000000. the product
is 251120300000000. which being diuided by 5000000. (the
ſine of 30. degrées the ſunnes diſtance from the equinoctial point)
the quotient is 50224060. for which number I ſéeke in the table
of Secants, the arch anſwering vnto it, is 78. degrées 32′· the
complement whereof is 11. degrées 29′· which is the declination
of the ſunne.
                     
                     
                        2 Knowing the declination of the ſunne how to finde his
diſtance from the equinoctiall point, and ſo conſequently his
place in the Zodiacke.
                        MVltiply the Secant of the complement of the greateſt declination
by the totall ſine, and deuide the product by the Secant
of the cōplement of the declination giuen, the quotient is the
diſtance of the ſun from the equinoctiall point. As for example, the
declination of the ſunne is ſuppoſed to be 11. degrées 29′· then to

finde his diſtance from the equinoctiall, I multiply 25112030.
the Secant of 66. degrées 32′· (which is the complement of the
greateſt declination) by the totall ſine the product is 251120300000000.
which I diuide by 50224350. the Secant of 78.
degrées 31′ the complement of 11. degrées 29′· the ſuppoſed declination,
the quotient is 5000000. the ſine whereof is 30. dedegrées
0′ which is the diſtance of the ſunne from the equinoctial:
thē for his place you muſt take the ſame according to ye ſeaſō of the
yeare: for if it be in Aprill, then the ſunne is entering into Taurus,
but if it be in Auguſt it is entering into Virgo, and being in
October, it is entering into Scorpio, and being in February it is
in the beginning of Piſces.
                     
                     
                        3 To finde out the right aſcention of the ſunne.
                        MVltiply the Tangent of the diſtance of the ſunne from the equinoctiall
point which is neareſt vnto it, by the ſine of
the complement of the greateſt declination, and diuide the product
by the totall ſine, the quotient is the Tangent of the right aſcention
of the ſunne, for which if you ſeeke in the table of Tangents,
the arch anſwering vnto it is your deſire: For example the
ſunne being in the firſt of Taurus, to knowe the right aſcention
thereof, I multiply 5773502. the Tangent of 30. degrées (for
that 30. degrées is the diſtance of the ſunne from the equinoctiall
point) by 9172920. the ſine of 66. degrées 32′· which is the complemēt
of 23 degrées 28′· the greateſt declination, the product is
52959871965840. which being deuided by 10000000. the totall
ſine, the quotient is 5295987. which is the Tangent of 27.
degrées, 54′· which is the right aſcention of the ſunne béeing entered
into Taurus.
                     
                     
                        4 How to finde out the declination of the ſunne knowing
onely the right aſcention thereof.
                        MVltiply the Tangent of the complement of the greateſt declination
by the total ſine, and deuide the product by the ſine
of the right aſcention giuen, the quotient is the Tangent of the
complement of the ſunnes declination: for example the right

aſcention of the ſunne being 27. degrées 54′· I would knowe the
declination thereof, multiplying 23035062. the Tangent of 66.
degrées 32′· the complement of 23. degrées 28′ by 10000000. the
product is 230350620000000. which being deuided by 4679298.
the ſine of the giuen aſcention the quotient is 49224856. the
arch of which Tangent is 78. degrées 32′· which being ſubducted
out of 90. the remainder is 11. degrées 28′· and ſo much is the
declination of the ſunne.
                     
                     
                        5 How to finde the place of the ſunne knowing onely the
right aſcention thereof.
                        SVbduct the right aſcention giuen out of 90. if it bee leſſe then
90. but if the ſame be more then 90. ſubtract the aſcention giuen
out of 180. & being greater then 180. ſubduct the ſame out of
270. or being greater then 270. ſubduct the ſame from 360. and
multiply the Tangent of the remainder by the ſine of the complement
of the greateſt declination, and deuide the product by the totall
ſine, the quotient is the Tangent of the complement of the
ſuns diſtance from one of the Equinoctiall points: which diſtance
being knowne, the place of the ſunne can not be vnknowne. For
example, ſuppoſing the right aſcention of the ſunne to be 27. degrées
54′· the complement thereof is 62. degrées 6′· the Tangent
whereof is 18886715. which being multiplyed by 9172920. the
product is 173245985757800. which being deuided by 10000000.
the quotient is 17324598. for which I looke in the table
of Tangents, and I finde the arch thereof to be 60. the complement
whereof is 30. which is the diſtance of the ſunne from the
equinoctiall point, that is, from Aries, for that the right aſcention
is leſſe then 90. I ſay then that the ſunne is in the beginning
of Taurus. But if the right aſcention had béene more then 90.
and leſſe then 180. the place of the ſunne had béene betwixt Cancer
and Libra 30. degrées from Libra, ſo ſhould it haue béene in
the firſt point of Virgo, but if the right aſcention had béene more
then 180. the place of the ſunne ſhould be betwixt Libra and Capricorne,
that is in the beginning of Scorpio, but being more
then 270. the place of the ſunne ſhould be betwixt Capricorne and
Aries, that in the beginning of Piſces.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        6 To find out the aſcentionall difference of the ſunne or
any ſtarre in the firmament, knowing the declination thereof,
and alſo the latitude of your region.
                        MVltiply the Tangent of the declination of the Sunne or ſtar
by the Tangent of the latitude of the place, and deuide the
product by the totall ſine: the ſine of the quotient is the ſine of the
aſcentionall difference, the arch wherof is the deſired aſcentionall
difference. For example let the declination of the ſunne, ſtarre, or
other point in the firmament be 10. degrées 3′· and ſuppoſe the latitude
to be 52. degrées, the Tangent of 10. degrées 3′· is 1772268.
the tangent of 52. degrées is 12799416. which being multiplyed
together, the product will be 22674995395488. which
being deuided by 10000000. the totall ſine, the quotient is 2267499.
for which number I looke amongſt the ſines, the arch anſwering
thereunto is 13. degrées 6′· which is the aſcentionall
difference deſired.
                     
                     
                        7 To find out the oblique aſcention of the ſunne.
                        KNowing the place of the ſunne, finde out the right aſcention
of the ſame by the thirde propoſition, and finde alſo the
aſcentionall difference of the ſame point, then if the declination
of the ſunne be North, ſubduct the aſcentionall difference out of
the right aſcention, the remainder is the oblique aſcention. For
example, ſuppoſe the ſunne to be in the beginning of Taurus, now
to finde the oblique aſcention thereof in the latitude 52. degrées,
firſt by the third propoſition I finde out the right aſcention of the
beginning of Taurus, which I finde to be 27. degrées 54′· then
by the ſixth propoſition I finde the aſcentionall difference to bee
15. degrées 4′· which being ſubducted frō 27. degrées 54′· (for that
the declination is North) the right aſcention the remainder is 12.
degrées 50′· and ſo much is the oblique aſcention for the latitude
of 52. degrées. But if the ſunne be in any of the Southerne ſines,
and that the declination bée South, then the aſcentionall difference
is to be added vnto the right aſcention before giuen.
                     
                     
                        
                        8 To finde out the oblique deſcention of the Sunne at
any time.
                        FIrſt finde out the right aſcention of the ſunne by the third propoſition,
the ſame ſhall be the right deſcention thereof, then
finde the aſcentionall difference by the ſixt propoſition, and if the
ſunne be in any of the Northern ſignes, adde the aſcentional difference
vnto the right aſcention, the ſumme ſhall be the oblique deſcention
of the ſunne: But if it be in any of the Southerne ſignes
ſubduct the aſcentionall difference out of the right aſcention, the
remainder is the deſired deſcention: as for example the ſunne being
in the beginning of Taurus, the right aſcention thereof by
the third propoſition is 27. degrées 54′· the aſcentional difference
thereof by the ſixth propoſition is 15. degrées 4′· for as much then
as Taurus is a Northerne ſigne, I adde the aſcentionall difference
vnto the right aſcention, the ſumme is 42. degrées 58′· and
ſo much is the oblique deſcention of the ſunne being in the beginning
of Taurus.
                        
                     
                     
                        9 To finde out the length of the day or night.
                        HAuing found out the aſcentionall difference by the ſixth propoſition,
adde the ſame vnto 90. if the ſunne be in any of the
Northerne ſignes, but if it bee in any of the Southerne ſignes,
ſubduct the aſcentionall difference out of 90. then diuide ye ſumme
of the addition or the remainder of the ſubtraction by 15. the quotient
wil ſhew the halfe length of the day in houres and minutes,
which being doubled you ſhall haue the whole length of the artificiall
day: For example the ſunne being in the beginning of Taurus,
the aſcentionall difference thereof is 15. degrées 4′· which for
that the ſunne is in a Northerne ſigne, I adde vnto 90. degrées,
the ſumme is 105. degrées 4′ which being diuided by 15. the quotient
is 7. houres o′· the halfe length of the day which being doubled
will be 14. houres the whole length of the artificiall day in
the latitude of 52. degrées.
                     
                     
                        10 To finde the houre of the Sunne his riſing or ſetting in
any latitude aſsigned.
                        FIrſt find out the halfe length of the artificial day by the 9. propoſition,
and ſubtract the ſame from 12. houres, the remainder

will ſhew the houre of the ſunnes riſing, for example the ſunne being
in the beginning of Taurus to know the houre of his riſing in
the latitude of 52. degrées, by the ninth propoſitiō, the half length
of the artificiall day I find to be 7. houres, which I ſubtract from
12. houres the remainder is 5. which ſheweth that the ſunne riſeth
at 5. of the clocke in the morning, but the halfe length of the day
it ſelfe is the houre of the ſunnes ſetting.
                     
                     
                        11 To find out the length of the planetary houres and to
find what Planet raigneth at any houre of the day.
                        FIrſt find out the length of the artificiall day by the ninth propoſition,
and diuide the ſame by 12. the quotient is the length
of one planetary houre: or thus, hauing an houre of the artificiall
day giuen, looke what houre the ſame is from the ſunne riſing,
and multiply the ſame by 12. diuide the product by the length of
the artificiall day, the quotient is the number of the Planetarye
houre. For example the ſunne being in the beginning of Taurus,
and our latitude being 52. degrées, the length of the artificiall day
by the ninth propoſition is 14. houres: then doe I diuide 14. by
12. the quotient is 1 ⅙. that is 1. houre 10′· the length of one planetary
houre. But if an houre of the artificial day be giuen as yt I
would know what planetary houre it is at 9. of the clock the ſunne
being in the firſt of Taurus in the latitude of 52. degrées, hauing
found that the ſunne riſeth at fiue of the clocke by the tenth propoſition,
I ſée that 4. houres of the artificiall day are gone at nine
of the clocke, I therefore multiply 12. by 4. the product is 48.
which I diuide by 14. the length of the artificiall day, the quotient
is 3 3/7. which is the planetary houre at the time ſet downe: likewiſe
ſhall you finde the planetary houre of the night, finding the
length thereof, and then worke with it as was ſhewed before for
the day.
                        Thē to know the Planet which raigneth at the appointed time,
you muſt conſider the Planet whereof the day taketh his name,
for that Planet ruleth the firſt houre of that day, the next Planet
the ſecond houre, and ſo foorth. But for your eaſe I haue ſet down
a table whereby to finde the Planet which raigneth at any time.

                        The vſe whereof is this, hauing founde the number of the
Planetary houre, looke for the ſame in the head of the Table, whether
it be in the day or night, and right vnder it iuſt againſt the
name of the day, you ſhall haue the Planet which rayneth at that
time. For example the ſunne being in the beginning of Taurus the
11. of April, being Thurſday at nine of the clocke in the morning,
I find the number of the Planetary houre at that time to be 3 3/7. thē
looking for thrée amongſt the houres of the day, I deſcend in that
collum vntill I come to be iuſt againſt thurſday, where I ſée the
Character of Sol to be, I conclude then that the ſunne raigneth
at that time.
                     
                     
                        12 To finde the arch of the Equinoctial, comprehended
betwixt the Meridian and any Circle of poſition according
vnto Campanus and Gazula.
                        MVltiply the Sine of the complement of your latitude by the
Tangent of the diſtance of the giuen Circle of poſition from
the Zenith, & diuide the product by the totall Sine, the quotient
is the tangent of the arch of the Equinoctiall, which is comprehended
betwixt the giuen Circle of poſition, and the Meridian.
For example in the latitude of 52. I would knowe what part of
the Equinoctiall is comprehended betwixt the Meridian and that
Circle of poſition, which is 30. degrées from the Zenith: the latitude
being 52. degrées, the complement thereof is 38. degrées,

the Sine whereof 6156615. and the tangent of 30. degrees,
(for that 30. is the diſtance betwixt the giuen Circle of poſition
and the Zenith) is 5773502. which being multiplyed by 6156615.
the product is 35545229015730. which being diuided by
10000000. the totall Sine, the quotient is 3554522. for which
I ſéeke amongſt the tangents, and I finde the Arke anſwering
thereunto, to be 19. degrées 34′ the Arch of the Equinoctiall, betwixt
the Meridian and the giuen Circle of poſition.
                     
                     
                        13 Knowing the Latitude of your Region, and alſo the
eleuation of the Pole aboue any Circle of poſition, howe to
finde the inclination of the ſaide Circle of poſition vnto the
Meridian, and ſo conſequently the Arch of the Equinoctiall,
which is betwixt the ſaid Circle of poſition & the Meridian.
                        MVltiply the Secant of the complement of the eleuation of the
Pole aboue the Circle of poſition by the Sine of your Latitude,
and diuide the product by the totall Sine, the quotient is
the Secant of the complement of the inclination of the Circle of
poſition vnto the Meridian, and that is the diſtance betwixt the
Circle of Poſition and the Zenith, by helpe wherof you ſhall find
the Arch of the Equinoctiall, betwixt the Circle of Poſition and
the Meridian, as in the former propoſition. As for example, ſuppoſe
the eleuation of the Pole aboue a Circle of poſition, in our
Latitude of 52. to be 23. degrées 12′· Now to find out the Inclination
of that Circle of Poſition vnto the Meridian, firſt I multiply
25384445. the Secant of 66. degrées 48′· (for that is the
complement of 23. degrées 12′· the eleuation of the Pole aboue
the Circle of poſition) by 7880108. the Sine of 52. the Latitude
of our Region, the product is 200032168120060. which being
diuided by 10000000. the quotient is 20003216. for which I
looke in the Table of Secants, and the Arch therof is 60. degrées
0′· the complement whereof is 30. degrées 0′· which is the Inclination
of the Circle of poſition vnto the Meridian, or the diſtance
of the Zenith from the ſayde Circle, then to find the Arch
of the Equinoctiall betwixt the ſayd Circle of Poſition and the
Miridian, repeate the worke of the former propoſition.
                     
                     
                        
                        14 To finde out the Eleuation of the Pole aboue any aſſigned
Circle of Poſition in any giuen Latitude.
                        KNowing the Inclination of the aſſigned Circle of Poſition
vnto the Meridian, multiply the Secant of the complement
thereof by the totall Sine, and diuide the product by the Sine of
your Latitude, the quotient is the Secant of the complement of
the Eleuation of the Pole aboue the giuen Circle of Poſition: as
for example, ſuppoſe the inclination of a Circle of poſition to be
30. degrées 0′· Now to finde the eleuation of the Pole aboue the
ſame for the Latitude of 52. degrées 0′· Firſt take the complement
of 30. degrées 0′· which is 60. degrées 0′· the Secant wherof
is 20000000. which being multiplyed by the totall Sine, the
product is 200000000000000. whcih being diuided by 7880108.
the Sine of 52. the aſſigned Latitude the quotient is 25380362.
for which I ſéeke in the Table of Secants, and the Arch
anſwering thereunto I finde to be 66. degrées 48′· the complement
whereof is, 23. degrées 12′· and ſo much is the eleuation of
the Pole aboue the aſſigned Circle of Poſition in your Latitude.
                        And thus much ſhall be ſufficient to haue béene ſpoken for the
vſe of the lines Tangent and Secant at this preſent, of whoſe
ample and infinite vſe, you ſhall haue further taſte in our Directorie
tables and Horologies, whereof a beginning is made, and
ſhal be ended ſo ſoone as may be poſſible: in the meane time I ſhal
deſire the Reader fauourably to accept of theſe, vntill better leaſure
and more fit opportunitie will be offered. And now followe
the Tables themſelues.

                  The expoſition of certaine
termes or principles of
Geometrie.
                  
                     MInding to treate of the principles of
Coſmographie, and eſpecially of the
Sphere, I thinke it good firſt to expound
vnto you certaine termes of Geometry,
without the which the vnlearned ſhall
hardly vnderſtand the Contents of this
Treatiſe, which tearmes are certaine
principles of Geometrie, called definitions:
For there are but thrée kinds of
principles, whereon the demonſtration of all Geometricall concluſions
dependeth: that is, definitions, petitions, and maxims,
but I mind here to deale onely with certaine definitions, Whereof
I will ſet downe as many as I thinke néedful for this purpoſe,
in ſuch order as followeth.
                  1 A point called in Latine punctus, is
a thing ſuppoſed to be indiuiſible, hauing
neither length, breadth, nor deapth, as the
point or pricke a.
                  
                  2 A line called in Lataine linea, is a
ſuppoſed length, hauing neither breadth nor
thickneſſe, as the line a. b.
                  
                  3. The ends or bounds of a line, are
two points, and of lines ſome be right, and
ſome be crooked.
                  
                     
                     
                  
                  4 A right line is that which goeth right
from one point to another, and not bowingly
as doth the line c. d. but ſo ſtraight as is
poſſible, as the line a. b. Againe the crooked
line is either a whole Circle, or portion of a
Circle, or elſe goeth winding in and out, as
a ſerpent called in Latine Linea tortuoſa,
or elſe winding about like the ſhell of a
Snaile, called of the Latines, linea Spiralis,
as theſe figures here doe ſhew.
                  
                     A whole Circle
                  
                  
                     A Portion of a circle
                  
                  
                     Linea tortuoſa.
                  
                  
                     Linea ſpiralis.
                  
                  5 Superficies or vpperface, is that
which onely hath length and breadth, without
deapth, which is twofould, that is to
ſay, plaine and crooked.
                  6 The bounds of ſuperficies are lines.
                  
                  7 A plaine ſuperficies is that which lyeth
ſtraight betwixt his lines, as the figure
a. & a crooked ſuperficies is that which goeth
bowing and lyeth not ſtraight betwixt his
lines as the figure b. Againe ſuperficies being
conſidered in an hollow body, as a barrell,
tunne, or vault, may be deuided into
two other kinds, that is Conuexe, and Concaue,
for the vpper part of ſuch vault is ſaid
to be conuex, and ye inward part cancaue as
the figure b. ſheweth.
                  
                     Conuex. Concaue.
                  
                  8 A plaine Angle is when two lines being
drawne vpon a plaine ſuperficies not directly
one againſt another, but ſo as by méeting
or touching one an other in one ſelfe
point, they may make a plaine Angle, as the
Angle a. 
                     For if two lines be drawne directly
one againſt another, though they méete in
one point, yet they make no Angle, but rather
one ſelfe line as the two lines a. b. méeting
in the point c.
                  
                  
                     Right. Crooked. Mixt.
                  
                  9 Of plaine Angles, ſome are called
right line angles, becauſe that both the lines
whereof it conſiſteth are right, and ſome are

called crooked line angles, becauſe that both
lines are crooked, & ſome are ſaid to be mixt,
becauſe the one line is crooked and the other
right, as you may perceiue by the thrée ſundry
ſhapes thereof made in the Margent.
                  
                  10 If one right line ſtanding vpon another
right line do make two equall angles,
that is to ſay, of ech ſide one, then eyther of
thoſe Angles is a right Angle, and the line
ſo ſtanding vpon his fellow, is called the perpendicular
or plumbe line, as the line a. b.
ſtanding vpon the line c. d.
                  
                  
                  11 A blunt Angle, is that which is greater
then a right Angle, as the Angle e.
                  
                  12 A ſharpe Angle, is that which is leſſer
then a right Angle, as f. ſo as there be in all
thrée Angles, that is right, blunt, and ſharpe,
in Latine rectus, obtuſus, & acutus: And
beſides theſe Angles, there be alſo certaine
Sphericall, that is to ſay, round Angles,
which conſiſt of two circular lines, drawne
vppon a Sphericall ſuperficies, which doe
croſſe one another in ſome point, eyther
rightly, or obliquely: if rightly, then they
make right Angles, on ech ſide of the point
where they croſſe, as the figure E. ſheweth,
if obliquely then they make ſharpe Angles of
the inſide, and blunt Angles on the out ſide
of the point, where they croſſe as the figure
F. doth partly ſhew, for ſuch Angles cannot
be ſo well deſcribed in Plano, as vpon the
ſuperficies of ſome Sphericall body.
                  
                  13 A terme called in Latine terminus, is
the bound or linute of any thing, as points
are the bounds of lines, & lines the bounds
of ſuperficieſes, and ſuperficieſes ye bounds of
a body, which is that which hath imaginatiuely,
but not materially, both lēgth, bredth,
and depth, and if ſuch body haue many faces

or ſides, then it is bounded with many ſuperficieſes,
as the figure g. made like a ſixe
ſquare dye. But if ſuch body be round as a
bowle, Sphere, or Globe, then it is bounded
or couered with one ſuperficies onely, as the
figure H. doth ſhewe.
                  
                  14 A figure is that which is comprehended
within one bound, or many bounds.
                  
                     Circumference.
                  
                  15 A Circle is a plaine figure bounded
with one circular line, which is called the circumference,
vnto the which as many right
lines as are drawne from the point ſtanding
in the midſt, are all equall one to the other,
that is to ſay, one is as long as another, as
the figure I. here doth ſhew.
                  
                     diam
                           •
                        ter.
                  
                  16 And the middle point of a Circle is
called the Center, as the point A. in figure
I.
                  
                  17 The Diameter of a Circle, is a
right line paſſing through the Center, from
one ſide of the Circumference to the other,
which deuideth the Circle into two equall
parts, as the line B. C.
                  
                  
                  18 A Semicircle is a figure, contayned
within the Diameter and halfe the Circumference
of a Circle as the figure D. C. E.
                  
                  
                     The cord.
                  
                  19 The portion of a Circle, is a part of
a Circle, greater or leſſer than the Semicircle,
as the figures F. and G. doe ſhewe, the
right line in eyther of which figures is called
in Latine chorda, in Engliſh the ſtring, and
the Circular line in Latine is called arcus
in Engliſh the bowe, but the Diameter is
alwayes the greateſt cord in any Circle.
                  
                     The cord.
                  
                  20 Right line figures, are thoſe which
are bounded with right lines.
                  
                     
21 Triangles or thrée cornerd figures,
are thoſe which are bounded with thrée right
lines as the figure H.
                  
                  
                  22 Foure ſquare figures, are thoſe
which are bounded with foure right lines,
as the figure I.
                  
                  
                  23 Many square figures, are thoſe
which are bounded with more right lines
then foure as K.
                  
                  
                  24 Of Triangles or thrée cornerd figures,
there be ſixe kindes, whereof the firſt

                        •
                     s called Iſoplurus, hauing thrée equall

                  27 The fourth is called Ort hogonius,

                     auing one right Angle, as D.
                  
                  
                  28 The fift is called ampligonius, becauſe
it hath one blunt Angle, as E.
                  
                  
                  29 The ſixt is called oxigonius, becauſe

                        〈◊〉

30 Of foure ſquare figures there is one
iuſt foure ſquare, hauing foure equall ſides,
and is right angled as G.
                  
                  
                  31 Another is called a long Square,

                  33 There is another called romboides,
which though it hath ſides and Angles one
right againſt another, yet hath it neither
foure equall ſides, nor yet is right angled,

                     HAuing ſet downe the expoſition of certaine termes
of Geometry, for the better vnderſtanding of this
Treatiſe, I doe firſt define what Coſmography is,
and therewith doe briefely ſhowe what Sciences it
comprehendeth, and who were firſt inuentors therof:
That done, becauſe the Spheare doth repreſent the ſhape of
the whole world, I do define what a Spheare is, and then I doe
deuide the world into two eſſentiall parts, that is, the Celeſtiall
and Elementall part, according to which two parts I do alſo deuide
this Treatiſe into two Bookes, the firſt whereof treateth of
the Celeſtiall parts, and the ſecond of the Elementall part of the

Chap. 1.
                     
                        WHat is Coſmography?
                     Coſmography is the deſcription of the
whole world, that is to ſay, of heauen and
earth, and all that is contained therein.
                     What ſpeciall kindes of knowledge
are comprehended vnder this Science.
                     Theſe foure, Aſtronomie, Aſtrologie,
Geographie, and Chorographie.
                     What is Aſtronomy?
                     Aſtronomy is a Science, which conſidereth and deſcribeth the
magnitudes and motions of the celeſtiall or ſuperlour bodies.
                     Which call you ſuperiour bodies?
                     The Spheares or Heauens, and the Starres as well fixed as
moueable, which we ſhall define hereafter in their proper places.
                     What is Aſtrologie?
                     It is a Science which by conſidering the motions, aſpects,
and influences of the ſtarres, doth foreſée and prognoſticate things
to come.
                     What is Geographie?
                     It is a knowledge teaching to deſcribe the whole earth, and
all the places contained therein, whereby vniuerſall Maps and
Cardes of the earth and ſea are made.
                     What is Chorographie?
                     It is the deſcription of ſome particular place, as Region, Ile,
Citie, or ſuch like portion of ye earth ſeuered by it ſelfe frō the reſt.
                     
                        
Who were firſt inuentors of theſe Sciences.
                     Some ſay that Atlas was the firſt inuentor, whom the Poets
ſaine to beare vp the heauens with his ſhoulders, hauing his head
placed in the North Pole, and his féete in the South Pole, and
his right hand bearing the Eaſt part, and his left hande the Weſt
part of the world. Albeit that ſome apply this fiction of the Poets
to an high mountaine in Affrica called Atlas, which for his great
height ſurmounting the cloudes, is ſayde to beare vp the ſkyes.
But ſome ſay that Adam our firſt Parent, was the firſt inuentor
thereof: And ſome others affirme that Abraham was the firſt
inuentor thereof. But whoſoeuer was the firſt inuentor, it well
appeareth by Ptolomy his booke, called Almageſti, that he hath
béene no ſmall furtherer thereof, and ſince his time in theſe latter
dayes Georgius Purbacchius, Iohannes de Monte Regio, Copernicus,
and diuerſe others haue learnedly treated thereof. But
leauing to ſpeake of the firſt inuentors, or of the furtherers of
theſe ſciences, I will ſpeake of the ſhape, capacitie, and vnitie of
the world, and becauſe the ſhape thereof is likned to a round bodie
called a Spheare, I will firſt define what a Spheare is.
                  
                  
                     The definition of a Spheare, and of the vnitie, roundneſſe,
and capacitie of the worlde, alſo of the poles and axeltre
thereof.
Cap. 2.
                     
                        WHat is a Spheare?
                     A Spheare is a round body, contained or
couered with one only ſuperficies or vpperface,
in the midſt of which bodie is a point
or pricke, called the Centre, from which all
right lines being drawne to any part of the
ſuperficies or vpper face therof, are of equal
length, as you may perceiue by this figure
here following, the Centre whereof is marked with the letter
A.
                     
                     
                        
And this Spheare before defined repreſenteth
the frame of the whole world, containing
all thinges, and is conteyned of
none.
                     How prooue you that there is but one
world?
                     
                     By the authoritie of Ariſtotle, who ſaieth,
that if there were any other world out
of this, then the earth of that worlde would mooue towardes the
Centre of this world, which cannot be, vnleſſe it ſhould firſt aſcend
from his own Centre to the ſuperficies or vpper face of the ſame,
which is againſt nature, for euery heauy thing naturally tendeth
downeward, and euery light thing vpward, which common experience
ſheweth: for a ſtone being caſt vpwards, will fall downewardes,
and the flame of a candle being turned downeward, will
fly vpward.
                     How proue you the frame of the world to be round?
                     By thrée reaſons, Firſt by compariſon, for the likenes which
it hath with the chiefe Idea or ſhape of Gods minde, which hath
neither beginning nor ending, and therefore is compared to a
Circle. Secondly by aptneſſe aſwell of mouing as of containing,
for if it were not round of ſhape, it ſhould not be ſo apt to turne
about as it continually doth, nor to containe ſo much as it doth,
for the round figure is of greateſt capacitie and containeth moſt.
Thirdly, neceſſitie prooueth it to be round, for if it were with angles
or corners, it ſhould not be ſo apt to turne about, and in
turning about, it ſhould leaue voide and emptie places, which
nature abhorreth, for no place by nature can be without a bodie,
nor a body without a place.
                     Whereupon is this Spheare or great round frame turned?
                     Vpon two moſt firme and immoueable hookes called in Latin
Cardines mundi, and in Gréeke Poli, deriued of the verbe Polo,
which is aſmuch to ſay, as to turne, for as a doore turneth vppon
his hookes, ſo the world turneth vpon his two Poles, whereof the
one is fixed in the North, and the other in the South, & the North
pole is called in Latine Polus arcticus, and the South pole is
called Antarcticus, through which Poles from the one to the other
paſſeth a right immaginatiue line called of the Aſtronomers

the Axeltrée of the world, about the which the worlde continually
turneth like a Cart whéele, which you may ſée liuely expreſſed in
a materiall Spheare made for the purpoſe, for in Plano it cannot
be ſo well deſcribed.
                  
                  
                     Of the diuiſion of the world, and of the two eſſentiall parts
thereof, and what things ech part contayneth.
Cap. 3.
                     
                        HOw is the world deuided?
                     Moſt writers do make a twofold diuiſion
therof, that is according to ſubſtance,
and according to accidentes, which accidents
becauſe they are none other thing,
but points, lines, and circles, and ſo incident
and neceſſarily belonging (by poſition
though not by nature) to the ſubſtantiall
parts, as the one can not be deſcribed without the other, neither
the ſubiect without the accidents, nor the accidents without their
ſubiect, I will therefore make but one diuiſion of the world, diuiding
the ſame into two eſſentiall parts, that is, the celeſtiall part,
and the Elementall part, in the deſcription of which parts, it ſhal
alſo plainely appeare what thoſe lines and Circles be, and to
what end they ſerue.
                     What doth the celeſtiall part containe?
                     The eleuen Heauens and Spheares.
                     Make you no difference betwixt theſe Spheares, and the
great Spheare which you laſt defined to be couered with one
ſuperficies or vpperface.
                     Yes verily, for theſe haue two ſuperficies or vpper faces, that
is, the Conuexe and Concaue.
                     Which call you Conuexe and which Concaue?
                     The Conuexe is the outermoſt vpper face of any thing that is
round, and therewith hollow, as of an ouen or vault, and the Concaue
is the innermoſt or hollow ſuperficies of the ſaide ouen or
vault, or of any ſuch like rounde bodie hauing concauitie or hollowneſſe.
                     
                        
Which be thoſe eleuen Spheares or Heauens whereof you
did laſt ſpeake?
                     In aſcending orderly vpwardes from the Elements they bee
theſe, The firſt is the Spheare of the Moone, The ſeconde the
Spheare of Mercury, The third the Spheare of Venus, The
fourth the Spheare of the Sunne, The fift the Spheare of Mars,
The ſixt the Spheare of Iupiter, The ſeuenth the Spheare of
Saturne, The eight the Spheare of the fixed Starres, commonly
called the firmament. The ninth is called the ſecond moueable
or Chriſtall heauen, The tenth is called the firſt moueable, and
the eleueuth is called the Emperiall heauen, where God and his
Angels are ſaid to dwell.
                     What doth the Elementall part containe?
                     It containeth the foure Elements.
                     Which be thoſe?
                     The Element of the fire which is next to the Spheare of the
Moone, and next to that more downeward is the Element of the
aire, and next to that is the Element of the water, and next to that
is the earth, which is the loweſt of all. All which things you may
ſée here plainly ſet foorth in the figure following on the other ſide.

                     A demonſtration to prooue the pluralitie of the heauens.
Chap. 4.
                     
                        HOw is it to be prooued that there is ſuch multiplicitie
of heauens, ſith to the eye it ſeemeth one
whole bodie?
                     If there were not diuerſe heauens and diuerſe
motions, there ſhould neither bee generation nor
corruption of any thing, for all things then ſhould be as one, and

euer in one eſtate, but beſides that reaſon men haue found out by
experience in obſeruing the diuerſe riſing and ſetting of diuerſe
wandring ſtarres called the Planets, that euery ſuch Planet hath
a ſeuerall Spheare or heauen by it ſelfe, for otherwiſe they ſhould
continually kéepe their places as the fixed ſtarres doe, which do
mooue altogether according to the moouing of the viii. heauen,
wherein they are placed.
                     I graunt that there may be diuerſe heauens or Spheares.
But how prooue you that there be tenne moueable heauens,
beſides the imperiall heauen before mentioned, and ſpecially
ſith of the olde writers, ſome affirme that there bee
but nine, and ſome haue ſaide that there be no more then
eight.
                     The latter writers haue found by good obſeruation (as they
ſay) that the firmament or eight heauen hath thrée ſeuerall motions
wherewith it is mooued and turned about, which could not
be, vnleſſe there were two mooueable heauens higher then that,
as ſhall be declared when we come to ſhewe the thréefold motion
of the ſaide eight heauen, for here I mind briefely to deſcribe vnto
you all the heauens beginning at the higheſt, and ſo procéede
to the loweſt.
                  
                  
                     Of the higheſt Spheare or Heauen, called the imperiall
heauen.
Chap. 5.
                     
                        THe imperiall heauen (as our auncient
Deuines affirme) is immooueable and
being created by God the firſt day that
he began the firſt creation of the world,
was by him immediatly repleniſhed
with his miniſters the holy Angels, and
this heauen being the foundation of the
world, is moſt fine and pure in ſubſtance,
moſt round of ſhape, moſt great in
quantitie, moſt cleare in qualitie, and moſt high in place, where
God and his Angels are ſaid to dwell.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the tenth Spheare or heauen, called in Latine primum
mobile, that is, the firſt moueable, and what motion it hath.
Chap. 6.
                     
                        THis heauen is alſo of a moſt pure and cleare ſubſtance
and without ſtarres, and it continually
mooueth with an equall gate from Eaſt to Weſt,
making his reuolution in 24. houres, which kind
of moouing is otherwiſe called the diurnall or
daily moouing, & by reaſon of the ſwiftneſſe therof,
it violently caryeth & turneth about all the other heauens that
are beneath it from Eaſt to Weſt, in the ſelfe ſame ſpace of 24.
houres, whether they will or not, ſo as they are forced to make
their owne proper reuolutions, which is contrary from Weſt to
Eaſt, euery one in longer or ſhorter time, according as they be far
or neare placed to the ſame: yet ſome writers doe not admit any
violence in the heauens, but that euer the heauen hath his proper
and naturall moouing without any violence.
                     I doe not well vnderſtande by what reaſon the firſt moueable
ſhould haue ſuch force ouer the reſt.
                     For your better vnderſtanding how this may be, ſuppoſe that
you turne with your hande from Eaſt to Weſt a Grindſtone, or
ſome other turning whéele, whereon is placed a Fly or ſome other
créeping worme which cōmeth towardes you from Weſt to Eaſt,
& you ſhal eaſily conceiue that by your ſwift turning of the whéele,
you ſhal turne about the ſaid Fly or Worme many times contrary
to her owne courſe, whether ſhe will or not, before ſhe can get about
the ſaid ſtone or whéele.
                     That is true, proceede therefore to the reſt, and tell the nature
and moouing of the ninth heauen.
                  
                  
                     Of the ninth heauen, what motions and names it hath,
and whether there be any waters aboue the firmament or not.
Chap. 7.
                     
                        THe ninth heauen is alſo cleare of ſubſtance, and without
ſtarres, hauing two moouinges, the one from
Eaſt to Weſt vpon the poles of the world, according
to the daily moouing of the firſt mooueable, and the

other from Weſt to Eaſt vpon his owne poles, according to the
ſucceſſion of the ſignes of the Zodiaque, which is in the firſt
moueable, turning ſo ſlowly about as it maketh but one degrée in
100. yeares, and accompliſheth his full reuolution in 36000.
yeares, or as Alfonſus ſaith in 49000. yeares.
                     Is there then in the firſt moueable any Zodiaque, that is to
ſay, a broad Circle carying the 12. ſignes and yet no ſtarres?
                     Yea though there be no ſtars, yet many ſuperſtitious fooles
doe imagine that there be diuerſe Characters and liniaments not
to be ſéene, but with a moſt ſharpe and ſubtill ſight (by vertue of
which Characters & fained conſtellations) they imagine that they
can worke wonders and ſtrange effects, inough to deceiue themſelues
and others too.
                     What is the cauſe that the ninth heauen is ſo long in making
his proper reuolution.
                     Becauſe as I ſayd euen now, this heauen is placed next to the
firſt moueable, which carieth him about cōtrary to his owne courſe
with ſuch violence as he cannot make his owne proper reuolution
ſo ſoone as the other heauens which are placed further off.
                     If the ninth heauen be ſo long in making his courſe, it will
neuer be compleat whilſt the world laſteth, for the whole age
of the world according to ſome, is but 6000. yeares?
                     Ye Plato was of an other opinion, and therefore this reuolution
was called, magnus annus Platonis, that is to ſay, the great
yeare of Plato, becauſe hee affirmed that when this reuolution
was once complet, all things ſhould be in the ſame eſtate wherein
they were at the firſt, and that he ſhould then ſtand reading to his
Schollers in the ſelfe ſame chaire wherein he ſtood at that preſent,
which fond opinion S. Auguſtine confuteth in his 12. Booke de
Ciuitate Dei, ſpeaking in this maner, God forbid (ſaith he) that
we ſhould credit theſe things, for Chriſt dyed once for our ſinnes,
and being riſen againe from the dead, he is no more to die, neithet
can death haue any more power ouer him, by vertue of whoſe reſurrection,
we alſo that beléeue ſhall riſe againe, and dwell with
God for euer.
                     With what names is this ninth heauen called?
                     Some do call it the Chriſtalline heauen, becauſe of the cleareues
thereof, and ſome the watrie heauen, becauſe the Scripture

affirmeth that there be waters aboue the firmament as we reade
in Gen. cap. 1. let the firmament be made, and deuide the waters
from waters. Againe we read in the Pſalmes, all ye waters that
be aboue the firmament, bleſſe ye the Lord.
                     The naturall Philoſophers allow no waters to dwell aboue
the firmament.
                     That is true, yet notwithſtanding if the holy Scriptures doe
manifeſtly affirme that there be waters aboue the firmament, it
behooueth a Chriſtian to beléeue it, but queſtion perhaps may bée
mooued, what manner of waters they are that are aboue the firmament,
whether ſuch as bréed raine, or whether they are onely to
be referred to the Chriſtalline heauen, becauſe it is of a watrie
ſubſtance, and therefore of ſome is called the watry heauen, affirming
it to be placed next to the primum mobile, or firſt moueable,
to the intent that with the coldneſſe thereof, it might aſſwage and
repreſſe the extreame heat of the ſame primum mobile, which otherwiſe
(as ſome affirm) with his ſwift & violent moouing, would
ſet all the heauens on fire, and yet no raine is bred therein, for the
great raine that drowned the world in Noahes time, did not fall
from aboue the firmament, but from the Aire, which in the holy
Scripture is many times ſignified by this Latine world Coelum,
that is to ſay, Heauen, as when the Scripture ſaith, the flood gates
of heauen were opened, is as much to ſay as the flood-gates of the
Aire were opened, &c. but leauing this queſtion, let vs procéede to
the eight heauen.
                  
                  
                     Of the eight heauen what motions it hath, and what circles
are imagined by the Aſtronomers to be in that heauen, and to
what vſe and purpoſe they ſerue: Alſo in what time euery one
of the ſeuen Planets maketh his reuolution, & of what thicknes
their Spheares be.
Chap. 8.
                     
                        THe eight heauen otherwiſe called the firmament,
is a moſt glorious heauen adorned with all the
fixed ſtarres.
                     Why are they called fixed?
                     Becauſe they are faſtned in this heauen, like
knots in a knotty board, hauing no moouing of

themſelues, but are mooued according to the moouing of this eight
Spheare or heauen wherein they are fixed.
                     How many fold is the moouing of this heauen?
                     The moouing of this heauen (as hath béene ſaid before) is thréefold,
for firſt it turneth about euery day from Eaſt to Weſt in 24.
houres, according to the moouing of the firſt mooueable, otherwiſe
called the diurnall moouing. Secondly it mooueth from Weſt to
Eaſt, according to the moouing of the ninth heauen which maketh
but one degrée in 100. yeares, and this moouing is called motus
angium Stellarum fixarum.
                     
                     What are Anges?
                     They be certaine imagined points in the heauen, notifying the
furtheſt diſtance of any Orbe or Spheare from the Centre of the
world: Thirdly it mooueth ſometime towardes the South, and
ſometime towards the North, by vertue of his owne proper moouing,
called in Latine motus trepidationis, that is to ſay, the
trembling moouing, whereby it is mooued vpon two little Circles,
the poles whereof are in the beginning of that Aries and that Libra
which are imagined to be in the ninth heauen, the Semidiameter
of which little Circles is 4. degrées 18′· and 43″· & maketh
his whole reuolution in 7000. yeares, and this moouing is otherwiſe
called motus acceſſus & receſſus, that is to ſay, the moouing
of approching and retiring, and is onely proper to the 8. Spheare:
for euery naturall body by order of nature, can haue but one proper
moouing, and by reaſon of this moouing the fixed ſtars be not
alwayes equally diſtant from the immooueable poles of the tenth
Spheare, nor alwayes vnder ye Ecliptique of the ſaid 10. Sphere,
but oftentimes cleane without it. Nor the fixed ſtars are in equall
times equally diſtant from the beginning of that Aries & Libra,
which are imagined to be in the tenth heauen, but they ſéeme to
mooue ſometimes towards the Eaſt, and ſometimes towards the
Weſt, now more ſwiftly, and now more ſlowly. For Ptolomy in
his time found them to be mooued in 100. yeares one degrée. And
the latter obſeruers haue found them when they be in their ſwift
motion to be mooued one degrée in 63. yeares, all which thrée moouings
are eaſie (as ſome affirme) to be demonſtrated by an inſtrument
made of purpoſe, ſhewing euery ſeueral moouing of this heauen
by it ſelfe, but ſuch demonſtrations as ſome others thinke be

not altogether neceſſary concluſions: for it may be that the daily
moouing is cōmon to the whole frame, and that the moouing of
the Angles of the fixed ſtarres, is proper to the eight Spheare,
hauing ſome other moouer, and the like obiection may be made
touching the trembling moouing, called motus trepidationis.
But now you haue to vnderſtande that for the better deſcribing,
deuiding, and meaſuring of this heauen, and all the apparances
thereof, the Aſtronomers with the Penſill of imagination, or rather
of moſt neceſſarie inuention, doe (as it were) trace the ſame
with certaine Circles both greater and leſſer, whereof wee ſhall
ſpeake ſo ſoone as we haue briefely ſhewed the mouing of the reſt
of the heauens, contained in the celeſtiall part of the world, in ſuch
order as they follow one another. For next to the firmament is the
heauen of Saturne, which maketh his reuolution from Weſt to
Eaſt in 30. yeares, next to him is the heauen of Iupiter, who maketh
his reuolution from Weſt to Eaſt in 12. yeares, next to him
is the heauen of Mars, which maketh his reuolution alſo from
Weſt to Eaſt in 2. yéeres, next to him is the heauen of the Sunne,
which maketh his reuolution from Weſt to Eaſt in 365. dayes,
and 6. houres lacking certaine minutes, next to him is the heauen
of Venus, which maketh her reuolution from Weſt to Eaſt
in like time as doth the Sunne, next to Venus is the heauen of
Mercury, which maketh his reuolution from Weſt to Eaſt in the
like ſpace that Venus doth: And next to Mercury is the heauen
of the Moone, which maketh her reuolution from Weſt to Eaſt
in 28. dayes and certaine minutes. Thus hauing briefely deſcribed
the eleuen heauens, I will now treat of the Circles that are
imagined (as I ſayd before) by the Aſtronomers to be in the eight
heauen or firmament, to the intent that the meaſures and diſtances
of the ſtarres, images, ſignes, and other apparances therein
contayned, might be the better demonſtrated.
                     Before you deale with theſe Circles, I would gladly vnderſtand
ſome reaſon why all theſe ſeuerall heauens ſeeme to
the eye but as one entire bodie.
                     That is becauſe they are all cleare and tranſparent like fine
birall glaſſe, or Chriſtall, through the which the ſight doth eaſily
pearce, though there were neuer ſo many coates of ſuch cleare
ſubſtance, couering one another like the ſkales of an Onion, for

ſo the heauens doe couer and encloſe one another, and euery one
is of an excéeding great thickneſſe.
                     Why how thicke is euery ſuch heauen?
                     
                        The heauen of the Moone containeth in thickneſſe.—
                        105/222 2/33 miles.
                        The heauen of Mercury containeth—
                        253372 ⅔.
                        The heauen of Venus—
                        3274494 6/11.
                        The heauen of Sol,—
                        343996 4/11
                        The heauen of Mars,—
                        26/308/800.
                        The heauen of Iupiter,—
                        1899654 6/11.
                        The heauen of Saturne,—
                        19604454 6/11.
                     
                     What neede haue the heauens to be ſo thicke?
                     Becauſe otherwiſe they could not containe ech one his ſtarre
or ſtarres, for there is no fixed ſtarre ſo little, but that it is farre
greater in compaſſe then the earth, neither is there any wandring
ſtarre, but that it is bigger then the earth, the Moone, Venus,
and Mercury excepted.
                     
                        For the Sunne contayneth the earth—
                        166. times.
                        
                           Saturne containeth it—
                        95. times.
                        
                           Iupiter containeth it—
                        91. times.
                        
                           Mars containeth it—
                        2. times.
                        
                           Venus is leſſe then the earth—
                        39. times.
                        
                           Mercury is leaſt of all and is contained of the earth,—

therefore nowe proceede with the Circles if you thinke ſo
good.
                     Before that I deſcribe vnto you the Circles whereof a Sphere
is made, or declare the vſes thereof: I thinke it not amiſſe here
to ſet downe the ſhape of a Spheare, together with the names of
euery Circle written vpon the ſame, to the intent that you may
be acquainted with all the partes of a Spheare before you come
to vſe the ſame: which ſhape or figure was firſt drawne by Maſter
Blagraue, and is ſet downe in his booke called the Mathematicall
Iewell.

                        OF Circles which are imagined to be in the firmament,
and whereof a Spheare repreſenting the
ſhape of the world is commonly made, be in all
10. that is to ſay, the Equinoctiall, the Zodiaque,
the two Colures, the Horizon, the Meridian,
the two Tropiques and the two polar
Circles, of which Circles ſome be greater and ſome leſſer.
                     
                        
Which call you greater and which leſſer?
                     Thoſe are called the greater Circles, which paſſing through
the Centre or midſt of the firmament, do deuide the whole circuit
thereof into two equall parts, and of ſuch Circles there be ſixe,
that is to ſay, the Equinoctiall, the Zodiaque, the Colure of the
Solſtices, the Colure of the Equinoxes, the Horizon and the Meridian.
The leſſer Circles are the foure laſt mentioned, that is
the two Tropiques, and the two polar Circles, which are called
leſſer, becauſe they do not deuide the world into two equall parts,
but into vnequall portions.
                     What other diuiſions doe the Aſtronomers make of the
ſaid Circles?
                     Diuerſe, for ſome are ſaid to be paralels, ſome right, ſome oblique,
ſome moueable, and ſome immoueable.
                     Which are ſaid to be paralels?
                     The two polar Circles, and the two Tropiques, and the Equinoctiall
which is in the very midſt of them all.
                     Which are ſaid to be right and which oblique?
                     The right be the two Colures, the right Horizon, & the Meridian,
becauſe they cut the Spheare or Globe with right Angles:
And the oblique are theſe two, that is, the Zodiaque, and the
oblique Horizon, which are ſaid to be oblique becauſe they cut the
Spheare or globe with oblique Angles.
                     Which are ſaid to be moueable, and which immoueable?
                     The moueable are theſe, the Equinoctiall, the Zodiaque, the
two Tropiques, & the 2. polar Circles which are ſaid to be moueable,
becauſe they continually mooue with ye firmament & are like
in al places. And theſe alſo hauing reſpect to a materiall Sphere,
are ſaid to be intrinſicall or inward. The immoueable are theſe 2.
that is, the Horizon, & the Meridian, which are ſaid to be immoueable
becauſe in the turning of the Spheare they remaine vnmooued,
for though we change both Meridian and Horizon by going
from one habitation to another vpon the earth, yet euery place
hath ſtill his owne Meridian and Horizon, which doe remaine immoueable,
and theſe two Circles hauing reſpect to a materiall
Spheare, are ſaid to be extrinſicall or outward, becauſe they do incloſe
on the outſide all the other Circles of a materiall Spheare.
Thus hauing ſette downe the diuiſions of the ſayde Circles,

I will now deſcribe them all in order, and ſhew to what vſes they
ſerue, beginning firſt with the great Circles, and ſo procéede to
the leſſer, and firſt I will ſpeake of the Equmoctiall.

vſes thereof.
Chap. 10.
                     
                        WHat is the Equinoctiall?
                     The Equinoctiall is a great Circle,
which being in euery part equally diſtant
from the two poles of the world, deuideth
the Spheare in the very midſt thereof, into
two equall parts, and therefore it is
called of ſome, the girdle of the world.
                     Wherefore is it called by the name
of the Equinoctiall?
                     Becauſe that when the Sunne toucheth this Circle, which is
twice in the yeare, the day and night is of equall length throughout
the whole world.
                     At what time of the yeare is it Equinox?
                     In the ſpring of the yeare, about the 11. day of March when
as the Sunne entereth into the firſt degrée of Aries, and againe
in Autumne about the 13. of September when as the Sun entereth
into the firſt degrée of Libra, And by reaſon that this Circle
deuideth the world in the very midſt, thoſe that dwell right vnder
it, are ſaid to haue no Latitude either Northward or Southward,
to whom the dayes and nights are alwayes equall. But if they
dwell any thing diſtant from the Equinoctiall, towardes any of
the poles, then they are ſaid to haue Latitude more or leſſe, eyther
Southward or Northward, as ſhall be declared hereafter more
at large, when we come to treat of the Longitude and Latitude
of the earth, both which are to be knowne by helpe of the Equinoctiall.
                     To what other vſes ſerueth this Circle?
                     This Circle hath many moſt neceſſary vſes, for firſt it ſheweth
the daily moouing of the firſt moueable, which maketh his reuolution

in 24. houres, which houres are equall, and are to be meaſured
by the degrées of the Equinoctiall, by allowing 15. degrées
thereof to an houre. And therefore the degrées of the Equinoctiall
are commonly called in Latine of the Aſtronomers tempora,
of which degrées it containeth 360. which being deuided by 15.
do make 24. houres, which is a naturall day, contayning both
day and night: Moreouer it ſheweth the declination of the fixed
ſtarres and their right aſcentions, whereof we ſhall ſpeake when
we come to treat of the ſtarres, and by his equall motion, all
the inequalities of the Zodiaque, & of all the ſignes conteyned
therein, are meaſured: And to be ſhort, this Circle hath many other
good vſes not to be declared vntill you haue ſome knowledge
of the reſt of the other Circles hereafter deſcribed.

                        WHat is the Zodiaque?
                     It is a broad, oblique, or ſtope Circle, hauing
a circular line in the midſt thereof, called
the Ecliptique line, and deuideth the
Spheare into two equall parts, by croſſing
the Equinoctiall with oblique Angles in two
points, that is, in the beginning of Aries, and
in the beginning of Libra, ſo as the one halfe of this broad Circle
declineth towards the North, and the other halfe towards the
South: in which Circle many thinges are to be conſidered, firſt
the name, then what breadth it hath, and why it hath ſuch breadth,
and into what parts it is deuided aſwelt touching the breadth or
Latitude, as circuit or Longitude thereof, alſo into how many
parts the firmament is deuided by the ſpaces deſcribed in the
Zodiaque, and appointed to the 12. ſignes. Alſo how much it declineth
from the Equinoctiall towards the South or North, and
vpon what poles it turneth about, and why the line in the midſt
is called the Ecliptique line, and many other neceſſary points,
which I mind here briefely to touch.
                     Why is this Circle named the Zodiaque?
                     It is named the Zodiaque either of this Gréeke worde zoe,
which is aſmuch to ſay as life, becauſe the ſunne being mooued
vnder this Circle, giueth life to the inferiour bodies, or elſe of
this Gréeke word Zodion, which is as much to ſay as a beaſt, becauſe
that 12. Images of ſtars, otherwiſe called the 12. ſignes,
named by the name of certaine beaſts, are formed in this Circle:
and therefore the Latines doe call this Circle Signifer becauſe it
beareth the 12. ſignes.
                     How are theſe ſignes called, and with what Characters are
they marked.
                     Their names and Characters this table here following doth

                     Of which ſignes the firſt ſixe on the left hande are called the
Northerne ſignes, becauſe they are conteyned in that halfe of the
Zodiaque, which declineth towardes the North. And the other
ſixe on the right hand being right oppoſite to the firſt 6. are called
the Southerne ſignes, becauſe they are conteyned in the other
halfe of the Zodiaque, declyning towardes the South: And againſt
every ſigne is ſet his proper Character.
                     What diuiſions doe Aſtronomers make of the 12. ſignes?
                     Diuerſe, as followeth: for ſome are ſaid to be aſcendent, and
ſome deſcendent.
                     Aſcendent are thoſe that riſe from the South towards our Zenith,
tending Northward, which be theſe, Capricornus, Aquarius,
Piſces, Aries, Taurus, and Gemini.
                     
                     The deſcendent are theſe, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius,
and Sagittarius.
                     
                     Againe ſome are ſaide to be vernall, as Aries, Taurus, and
Gemini.
                     
                     Some Eſtiuall as Cancer, Leo, Virgo.
                     
                     Some Autumnall as, Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius.
                     
                     And ſome Hiemall or Brumall, as Capricornus, Aquarius,
and Piſces, ſignifying the foure ſeaſons of the yeare, that is to
ſay, the Spring, Sommer, Autumne, and Winter.
                     And ſome doe make diuerſe other diuiſions, which becauſe
they appertame to Aſtrologie rather then to the Treatiſe of a
Spheare, I willingly omit them.
                     Now tell what breadth the Zodiaque hath, and why it is
imagined to haue ſuch breadth?
                     It hath (according to the ancient writers) 12. degrées in bredth,
that is to ſay, 6. degrées on the one ſide of the Ecliptique line, & 6.
degrées on the other ſide of the Ecliptique line, but according to

the moderne writers, it hath 16. degrées in breadth, that is, eight
degrées on ech ſide of the Ecliptique line, which breadth was neceſſarily
imagined, firſt to the intent that by the meaſures and
degrées thereof it might be knowne, how much the Planets (otherwiſe
called the wandring ſtarres, whoſe courſe is to paſſe continually
vnder this broad Circle) doe wander at any time
on either ſide of the Ecliptique line, for they all wander, but ſome
more, ſome leſſe, the Sunne onely excepted, which neuer ſwarueth
from that line, but alwayes goeth right vnder the ſame, and
therefore the ſaide line is called of ſome writers the way of the
Sunne: And ſecondly it hath ſuch breadth to the intent it may
containe within the ſame, the 12. ſignes aforeſaid, by meanes of
which ſignes the whole circuit or longitude of the ſaide Circle is
deuided into 12. equall parts, and euery ſuch part is deuided into
30. degrées, and euery degrée into 60. minutes, and euery minute
into 60. ſeconds, &c. ſo as the whole Longitude thereof contayneth
360. degrées, according vnto which diuiſion, all the reſt
of the Circles both greater and leſſer deſcribed in the Spheare,
are made to containe the like number of degrées, and euery halfe
Circle to containe 180. degrées, and euery quarter of a Circle to
containe 90. degrées, and by this diuiſion aſwell of the breadth as
of the length of the Zodiaque, it appeareth that euery one of the
12. Signes hath 30. degrées in length, and 12. degrées in bredth,
and thereof the Planets, Starres, and all other Celeſtiall bodies
are ſaid to haue both Longitude and Latitude, the ſunne onely
excepted.
                     How is ſuch Longitude and Latitude to be vnderſtood?
                     The Longitude of any Planet or Starre is to be counted in
the Ecliptique line containing in circuit 360. degrées, reckoning
from the firſt point of Aries, and ſo to Taurus, Gemini, and Carcer,
& ſo foorth according to the ſucceſſion of the ſignes, vntill you
come againe vnto the firſt point of Aries, at which point ſuch
Longitude both endeth & begimeth. The Latitude is counted frō
the ſaid Ecliptique line towards any of ye Poles of the Zodiaque.
And hereof looke how many degrées any fixed ſtarre or Planet is
diſtant from the Ecliptiqueline towards any of the ſaid poles, ſo
much Latitude it is ſaid to haue either Northerne or Southerne:
moreouer, by this diuiſion of the ſignes the whole firmament is

deuided into 12. parts by reaſon of 6. Circles imagined to paſſe
through the poles of the Zodiaque, and alſo through the beginning
of euery ſigne, wherby
we knowe vnder what
ſigne euery ſtar is ſituated
though it be cleane out of
the Zodiaque as this figure
here plainely ſheweth,
marked with theſe
letters A. B. C. D. A ſignifieth
the North pole of
the worlde, B. the North
pole of the Zodiaque,
C. the South pole of the
world, D. the South pole
of the Zodiaque.
                     
                  
                  
                     How much the Zodiaque declineth from the Equinoctiall
towards either of the Poles, and of the greateſt declination of
the Sunne, what it is at this preſent, and what it hath beene in
times paſt.
Chap. 12.
                     
                        YOu haue to vnderſtande that the Zodiaque
or rather the Ecliptique line, declineth
from the Equinoctiall towardes eyther
of the poles, 23. degrées 28′· and
that is ſaid in theſe dayes to be the greateſt
declination of the ſunne, which declination
is twofold, that is Northerne and
Southerne, for like as the Sunne entring
into the firſt point of Aries, beginneth
then to decline from the Equinoctiall Northward, to the quantitie
of 23. degrées and 28′· ſo entring into the firſt point of Libra,
he declineth againe from the Equinoctiall as much Southward.
And note by the way that by reaſon of his ſlowe motion, when he
is in the Northerne ſignes, he ſpendeth 7. dayes, and ⅗. of a day
more in making his North declination then in making his South

declination, becauſe he is then in his ſwift motion, and the time
hath béene that he hath ſpent aboue ten dayes more in making his
North declination, then in making his South declination: neither
is the greateſt declination of the Sunne in all ages of like
quantitie. For in Ptolomies time it was 23. degrées, 51′· and
20″· euer ſince whoſe time it hath alwaies continually decreaſed
vntill this preſent, ſo as now the greateſt declination is no more
but 23. degrées and 28′· And Copernicus maketh the declination
of the ſunne in reſpect of quantitie to be twofold, that is, greateſt
and leaſt, affirming the greateſt to be 23. degrées and 52′·
and the leaſt to be 23. degrées and 28′· as it is now accounted, the
difference whereof is 24′· and whilſt the Ecliptique departeth
from the Equinoctiall, and turneth againe towardes the Equinoctiall,
there do runne (as he ſayth) 34

                        THis is chiefely to be knowne by Tables

                        The deſcription and vſe of the Table.
                        This Table conſiſteth of 5. collums, whereof the firſt on the
left hand, and the laſt on the right hand do containe the degrées of
the 12. ſignes of the Zodiaque, counting from one to 30. And the
thrée middle collums do contain the degrées minutes, and ſeconds
of declination, ouer the head of which thrée middle collums are ſet
downe the characters of theſe 6. oppoſit ſignes, Aries and Libra,
Taurus and Scorpio, Gemini and Sagittarius, and at the foot of
the ſaid midlde colums are ſet down the characters of the other 6.
oppoſit ſignes, that is, Virgo and Piſces, Leo & Aquarius, Cancer
and Capricornus, for euery 2. oppoſit ſignes, aſwell aboue as
beneath, haue like declination, the vſe of which Table is thus: firſt
hauing found out the degrée of the Sun by the inſtrument before
deſcribed, or rather by ſome true Ephemerides, you muſt ſéeke out
the number of the ſaid degrée, either in the firſt or laſt collum, according
as the character of the ſigne is placed. For if the ſigne or
character be aboue, then you muſt ſéeke for the ſaid number in the
firſt collum on the left hand, which numbers do diſcend from 1. to
30. but if the ſigne be beneath, then you muſt find it out in the the
outermoſt colum on the right hand, the numbers wherof do aſcend
from 1. to 30. and the common angle or ſquare, ſtanding right againſt
the ſaid number will ſhew you the degrée, minutes and ſeconds
of the declination, as for example, hauing found by the former
inſtrument that the 4. day of May the Sun is in the 23. degrée
of Taurus, I ſéeing the character of Taurus to ſtand aboue, doe
ſéeke my foreſaid number of 23. degrées in the firſt collum on the
left hand, and in the common angle or ſquare right againſt that
number, and vnder the ſigne Taurus, I find the declination of the
Sun to be 18. degrées 32′· and 37″· But this Table cannot ſerue
alwayes: yea rather ſuch tables are to bee renewed as our Aſtronomers
ſay euery 30. yeares. Alſo you may know the daylie declination
of the Sun, by helpe of a materiall Spheare or globe: thus
hauing ſet the Spheare at your latitude, bring the degrée of the
ſigne wherein the Sanne is that preſent day vnto the moouable
Meridian, and ſtaying it there, marke whether it falleth
on the South ſide or on the North ſide of the Equinoctiall:

for if it be in any of the Northern ſignes, it will fall on the North
ſide of the Equinoctial, and if it be in any of the Southern ſignes,
it will fall on the ſouth ſide of the Equinoctiall, and by counting
the degrées vpon the Meridian, contained betwixt the degrée of
the Sun and the Equinoctial, you ſhal know what declination the
Sun hath that day, as for example in the latitude 52. in the yeare
1590. the fift day of May, I find the Sunne by the Ephemerides
to be in the 23. degrée and 48′· of Taurus, which point I bring to
the moouable Meridian, and there ſtaying it, I find that point to
be diſtant from the Equinoctiall northward 18. degrées & certaine
minutes, and ſo much of North declination I conclude the Sun
to haue that day.
                     
                  
                  
                     Vpon what Poles the Zodiaque turneth about, alſo of the
Ecliptique line and of the diuers vſes thereof.
Chap. 14.
                     
                        THe Zodiaque turneth about vpon his own proper
Poles from Weſt to Eaſt, whereof the one
being placed in the Colure of the Solſtices towards
the North, is diſtant from the pole Arctique
23. degrées and 28′· and the other is placed
in the ſaid Colure towards the South, being
of like diſtance from the pole Antarctique, whereof the Aſtronomers
haue a generall rule, affirming that the diſtance of the two
Poles of the world from the Poles of the Zodiaque, is alwaies equal
to the greateſt declination of the ſun, which as hath bene ſaid
before, is 23. degrées & 28′· as you may plainly ſée by the Sphear.
And note that theſe 2. Poles are otherwiſe called the Poles of the
Ecliptique, for in conſidering the declination of the Sun or of the
Zodiaque from the Equinoctiall, you muſt haue reſpect onely to
the Ecliptique line, which is in the midſt of the Zodiaque, and
not to any other part of the Zodiaque. And as the Equinoctiall
line ſheweth the moouing of the firſt moouable, which is from Eaſt
to Weſt, ſo the Ecliptique line ſheweth the moouing of the ſecond
mooueable, which is from Weſt to Eaſt, clean contrary to the firſt
moouable, the cauſes whereof haue bene before declared.
                     What other vſes hath this line more than you haue already
declared?
                     
                        
It hath diuerſe, for in this line or circle are noted the degrées,
wherewith any ſtarre riſeth or goeth downe, either rightly or obliquely,
for all the apparances of the heauens are chiefly referred
to this circle. Againe, by this circle the chiefeſt diſtinctions
and parts of times, as yeares and moneths are knowne, and alſo
the foure ſeaſons of the yeare, as Spring, Summer, Autumne,
and Winter: Moreouer, the obliquitie of this circle vnder which
the Sun continually walketh, is cauſe that the dayes both naturall
and artificiall are vnquaell. Finally, this circle doth ſhew the
places and times of the Eclipſes both Solar and Lunar, from
whence this line taketh his name, of which Eclipſes we minde
here briefly to treate.
                  
                  
                     Of the Eclipſes both Solar and Lunar, and of the head and
taile of the Dragon, with certaine figures ſhewing the ſame.
Chap. 15.
                     
                        WHat ſignifieth this word Eclipſis?
                     It is as much to ſay, as to want light,
& to be darkened or hidden from our ſight,
as when the Sun & Moon are both at one
ſelf time right vnder the Ecliptique line,
the one of theſe 2. lights moſt commonly
is eclipſed and darkned: for there be two
Eclipſes, the one of the Sunne, and the other
of the Moone, but ſith that neither the eclipſe of the Sun or
of the Moone doth chance, but when they méet either in the head
or tail of the Dragon, I think it good to ſhew firſt what is meant
by the head and tayle of the Dragon. The Dragon then ſignifieth
none other thing but the interſection of 2. circles, that is to ſay,
of the Ecliptique, & of the circle that carieth the Moon, called her
Defferent▪ cutting one another in 2. pointes, whereof that interſection
which is weſtward when as the Moon goeth towards the
North, is called the head, and that which is Eaſtwardes when the
Moone goeth towards the South is called the taile, marked with
ſuch characters as you ſée in the figure following, and that part
towards the South is called of ſome the belly of the Dragon. And
note that the Defferent of the Moone is at no time diſtant from
the Ecliptique aboue 5. degrées at the moſt.
                     
                        
                        
                           The figure of the Dragon.
                        
                     
                     This being preſuppoſed, I will ſpeake firſt of the Eclipſe of
the Moone, and then of the Sunne, both which may bee eclipſed either
totally or in part.
                     When is the Moone ſaid to be totally eclipſed?
                     When the Sunne and Moone are oppoſite one to the other diame
trallie, and the earth in the verie midſt betwéen them both, for
the bodie of the earth being thick and not tranſparent, caſting his
ſhadow to that point which is oppoſite to the place of the Sun,
will not ſuffer the Moone to receiue any light from the Sun, from
whome ſhe alwaies borroweth her light.
                     At what time is the Moone ſaid to be diamtrallie oppoſit
to the Sunne?
                     When a right line drawne from the center of the Sun to the
center of the Moone, paſſeth through the center of the earth: & note
that euery time that ſhe is at the ful, ſhe is oppoſit to the Sun, and
yet the earth is not at euery ſuch full diametrally betwixt her and
the Sun, for then ſhe ſhould be eclypſed at euery ful, which indéed
cannot be but when ſhe is either in the head or tail of the Dragon.
                     When is the Moone ſaid to be eclipſed in part?
                     When the Sunne, the earth, and the Moone be met in one ſelfe
Diametrall line, but the Moone is declining either on the one ſide
or on the other, as you may plainlie ſée by this figure following.

                        
But note that the Eclipſes of the Moone may be vniuerſall, becauſe
the Earth is farre bigger than the Moone, and thereby able
to ſhadow her whole bodie.
                     When is the Sunne ſaide to be eclipſed?
                     When the Moone is betwixt the Sunne and the Earth, which
chanceth in a Coniunction, and yet not in euery coniunction, but
when it falleth either in the head or taile of the Dragon, which
may chance, as I ſaide before, either totally or in part: totallie
I ſay, in reſpect of thoſe parts of the earth whereon the ſhadowe
directly falleth. For ſith the Moone is farre leſſer than the Earth,
ſhe cannot ſhadow all the Earth, and therefore the Eclipſe of the
Sunne cannot be vniuerſall, but yet to ſome partes of the Earth
totally, and to ſome partlie, and to other ſome nothing at all, as
you may plainlie ſée by this figure following.
                     
                     Yet all the hiſtories doe affirme that the Eclipſe of the Sun
was vniuerſall at the death of Chriſt.
                     Yea, that was miraculous, and alſo it was then at the full of
the Moone, which was alſo as miraculous: and therefore Dioniſius
a Senator of Athens, beholding that Eclipſe cryed out, ſaying

theſe words, Either God this day ſuffereth, or els the world
muſt needs periſh for euer: which Dioniſius was the firſt that
conuerted the Frenchmen to the faith of Chriſt, doing there great
miracles: in honour of whome was erected the rich Abbey of S.
Deniſe, not far from Paris, whereas the Kinges and Princes of
France were woont to be buried.
                     How is it to be prooued that the Eclipſe at Chriſt his death
was at the full of the Moone?
                     Aſwell by ancient hiſtorie, as by S. Auguſtine, who ſaith that
the Iewes were woont to kéepe their feaſt of Paſſouer (at which
time God ſuffered) alway at the full of the Moone.
                     If the Sun and Moone be eclipſed but in part, how are ſuch
partes to be accounted?
                     By the parts of the Diameter of the bodies of thoſe two Planets,
for the Aſtronomers doe diuide the Diameter aſwell of the
Sunne, as of the Moone into 12. and ſome into 24. parts, which
they call points, and therefore are woont to ſay, that the Sunne or
Moone are darkned or eclipſed 7. points, 8. points, 9. points, &c.
                  
                  
                     Of the two Colures, and why they are ſo named, and wherto
they ſerue: alſo of the foure Cardinall points, that is, of the
two Equinoctiall, and the two Solſtitiall points, and of the entrance
of the Sunne into any of thoſe points or into any other
ſigne.
Chap. 16.
                     
                        WHat be Colures?
                     They be great moouable circles paſſing
through both the Poles of the world, which
the Aſtronomers do otherwiſe call Circles
of declination, wherof they make 180. which
are halfe ſo manie as there be degrées in the
Equinoctiall applying them to diuers vſes
not néedfull here to be rehearſed, for ſith that
there are but two Colures accuſtomablie ſet downe in the
Spheare, without the which a materiall Spheare cannot bée
made, I minde héere therefore onelie to treate of them.
                     Shew firſt what 
                           •
                        his name Colure ſignifieth.
                     This word Colure béeing compounded of Colos and Oura,
                        
is as much to ſay as vnperfect or maymed, the taile being cut
off, becauſe none of thoſe Circles are euere ſéene whole aboue
our Horizon, but parte thereof, for ſome part is alwayes ſéene,
and ſome part is alwaies hidden, as that part which is aboue
the Horizon, and nigh vnto the Pole, is alwayes ſéene, becauſe it
neuer goeth downe vnder the Horizon: likewiſe that which is
nigh vnto the South pole is alwayes hidden from vs, becauſe it
neuer riſeth aboue our Horizon, as by turning the Spheare about,
you may eaſilie perceiue the ſame.
                     Which be thoſe Colures that are commonly ſet downe in
the Spheare, and how are they named?
                     They are two great moouable circles, paſſing through the
Poles of the world, croſſing one another in the ſaid Poles with
right Sphearicall angles, by meanes whereof they deuide the
whole Spheare into foure equall partes, of which two Colures
the one is called the Colure of the Equinoxes, and the other the
Colure of Solſtices.
                     Deſcribe theſe two Circles, & ſhew why they are ſo named.
                     The Colure of the Equinoxes is ſo called becauſe it cutteth
the Zodiaque in the beginning of Aries, which is called the vernal
Equinoxe: and alſo in the beginning of Libra, which is called
the Autumnall Equinoxe, at which two times the dayes and
nightes be equall, as hath bene ſaid before when we did ſpeake of
the Equinoctiall circle, and this circle deuideth the Ecliptique into
two halfes, the one Septentrionall, and the other Meridionall
and thereby ſheweth the ſignes▪ wherein the Sunne maketh the
dayes longer and ſhorter than the nightes, for whileſt hee is an
the 6. Northern ſignes, he maketh the dayes with vs longer than
the nights, and when he is in the 6. Southern ſignes he maketh
the nights longer than the dayes: now you haue to vnderſtand that
the Colure of the Solſtice, is ſo called becauſe it cutteth the Zodiaque
in the two Soliſtitiall points, that is to ſay, in the beginning
of Cancer, and the beginning of Capricorne, as you may ſée
in beholding and turning the Spheare about with your hand.
                     Why are theſe two points called Solſtitiall?
                     They take their name of theſe two Latine words Sol and ſtano,
that is to ſay, the Sun and ſtanding, for when the Sunne is
in any of the two points, hee ſéemeth to ſtand ſtill, or at the leaſt

mooueth ſo little, as his proper moouing from Weſt to Eaſt cannot
be eaſilie perceiued, during the ſpace of twelue dayes. And
you haue to note, that when the Sunne entreth into the firſt degrée
of Cancer, which is about the 12. of Iune, then hée is at
the higheſt, and the dayes be at the longeſt, and therefore, it
is called the Summer Solſtice. Againe, when hee entreth into
the firſt degrée of Capricorne, which is about the 12. of December,
then the Sunne is at the loweſt, and the nightes are at
the longeſt, and therefore it is called the Winter Solſtice. And
in this Colure there are ſet downe the two Poles of the Ecl
                           •
                        ptique
line being diſtant from the Poles of the worlde 23.
degrées and 28′· Moreouer on this colure is meaſured the greateſt
declination of the Sunne, which is alwayes equall to the diſtance
of the Pole of the Ecliptique, from the Pole of the world,
as hath bene ſaid before. And you haue to note that the 4. former
points, that is to ſay, the 2. Equinoxes, and the 2. Soliſtices, are
commonlie called the foure cardinall or principall pointes, and of
ſome they are called, the foure points or Change, ſignifying the
4. beginnings of the four diuers ſeaſons of the yeare: for betwixt
the beginning of Aries and beginning of Cancer, is contained the
Spring time, and betwixt the beginning of Cancer and the
beginning of Libra, is the Summer time: and from the beginning
of Libra to the beginning of Capricorne is the time called
Autumne, or fal of the leaf: and from the beginning of Capricorne
to the beginning of Aries is contained the winter ſeaſon,
albeit the Sun entreth not into any of theſe ſignes alwaies at one
ſelf day or time of the yeare, for at Chriſt his incarnation, the Sun
entred into Aries the 25. of March, and into Cancer the 24. of
Iune, and into Libra the 27. of September, and into Capricorn
the 25. of December, which was then the ſhorteſt day in the yéer,
and the beginning of Winter, and therefore is called of the Latines,
dies brumalis, on which day Chriſt our Sauiour was born,
ſo as from the time of his birth vnto this preſent yeare, there are
run almoſt 13. daies, wherefore, vnleſſe the kalenders bee reformed
as well here in England as els where (for the Romane reformation
is not ſo exactlie true as it might be) wee ſhall haue
in proceſſe of time, the Spring in Winter, and the Winter in
Autumne.
                     
                        
How ſhall I know this preſent yeare, or any yeare to come
hereafter, at what day and houre the Sunne entreth into any
of the 12. Signes?
                     Firſt you muſt learne by ſome good Ephemerides, or other
Table, the true entrance of the Sunne into euerie ſigne in any
yeare paſſed before, then from the time of the entrance of the Sun
into the ſigne which you deſire to know, conſider how manie years
are betwixt, & how many leap years are in the ſame contained, and
ſubtract for ſo many times as there be leape yeares, 44′· of an
houre, and ad to the hours remaining, ſo many times fiue houres,
and 49′· as there be yeares remaining ouer and beſides the leape
yeares, and that ſumme ſhall ſhewe you the day, houre, and minutes
of the true entrance of the Sun into that ſigne in the ſame
year that you deſire to knowe.
                  
                  
                     Of the Horizon both right and oblique, making thereby
three kindes of Spheares, that is, the right, the Paralell, and
the oblique Spheare.
Chap. 17.
                     
                        WHat is the Horizon?
                     It is a great immoouable circle which deuideth
the vpper Hemiſphear, which is as
much to ſay, as the vpper half of the world
which we ſée, from the nether Hemiſpheare
which we ſee not, for ſtanding in a plaine
field, or rather vpon ſome high mountaine
voyd of buſhes & trées, and looking round
about, you ſhall ſee your ſelfe inuironed as
it were with a circle, and to be in the verie midſt or centre thereof,
beneath or beyond which circle, your ſight cannot paſſe, and therefore
this circle in Gréeke is called Horizon, and in Latine Finitor,
that is to ſay, that which determineth, limitteth or boundeth
the ſight, the Poles of which circle are imagined to be two points
in the firmament, whereof the one ſtandeth right ouer your head,
called in Arabick Zenith: and the other directlie vnder your
féete, called in the ſame tongue Nadir, that is to ſay the point oppoſite,
and from point to point you muſt imagine that there goeth
a right line paſſing through the centre of the world, and alſo

through your bodie both head and féet, which is called the Axletrée
of the Horizon, and you haue to vnderſtand that of Horizons ther
be 2. kinds, that is, right, & oblique, making 3. kinds of Sphears,
that is to ſay, the right Spheare, the paralel Spheare, and the
oblique Spheare,
                     When is the Horizon ſaid to be right, and thereby to make
a right Spheare?
                     It may be ſaid to be right two manner of waies, firſt, when the
Horizon paſſeth through both the Poles of the world, cutting the
Equinoctiall with right angles, in which Spheare they that dwel
haue their Zenith in the Equinoctiall, which paſſeth right ouer
their heads, to whom the daies and nights are alwaies equal. Secondly,
they are ſaid to haue a right Horizon, & to dwell in a right
Spheare, to whom one of the Poles of the world is their Zenith,
and their Horizon is all one with the Equinoctial, cutting the Axletrée
of the world in the very midſt with right angles, and becauſe
the Horizon & the Equinoctial are Paralels, this kind of Spheare
is called a paralel Spheare, in which Sphear they that dwel haue
6. moneths day, and 6. moneths night, as you may eaſily perceiue
by placing the Sphear, ſo as one of the Poles may ſtand right vp
in the midſt of the Horizon, by means wherof you ſhall ſée 6. ſignes
of the Zodiaque to be alwayes aboue the Horizon, and 6. ſignes
to be alwayes vnder the Horizon: Againe by placing the Sphear
ſo as both the Poles may lie vpon the Horizon, you ſhall ſée the
ſhape of the firſt right Spheare, wherein the Horizon paſſeth
throught both the Poles of the worlde, and the Equinoctiall paſſeth
through the Poles of the Horizon, which are the two points
called before the Zenith and Nadir.
                     
                     When is it ſaid to be an oblique Horizon, and thereby to
make an oblique Spheare?
                     When the Pole of the world is eleuated aboue the Horizon,
be it neuer ſo little, ſo as the Horizon do cut the Equinoctiall with
oblique angles, and look how much the Pole of the world is
eleuated aboue your Horizon, ſo much is your Zenith diſtant from
the Equinoctial, and the nigher that your Horizon approcheth to
the Pole, the nigher your Zenith approcheth to the Equinoctial.
Againe, look how much the Equinoctiall is eleuated aboue your
Horizon, ſo much is your Zenith diſtant from the Pole, all which

                        
                           〈1 page duplicate〉

things this figure here following doth plainly ſhew, whereby you
may eaſily perceiue that the latitude, which is the diſtance of your
Zenith from the Equinoctial, is alwaies equal to the altitude of
the Pole, which is the diſtance betwixt your Horizon & the Pole,
as for example, knowing the latitude of Norwich to be 52. degr.
lay the zenith of this figure vpō the 52. degrées, reckoning from
the Equinoctial towards the pole Arctique on your left hand, and
look what diſtance is betwixt the ſaid zenith and the Equinoctial,
the ſelf ſame diſtance you ſhall find to be betwixt the Horizon and
the foreſaid Pole on your right hand, and you may doe the like
vpon the Spheare it ſelf by raiſing the moouable Meridian aboue
the Horizon at that altitude, ſo as the 52. degr. may be euen with
the Horizon.
                     
                        A Figure ſhewing the latitude  of any place to bee equall to
the eleuation of the Pole.
                     
                     
                        
What other vſes hath this circle?
                     In this circle are ſet down the foure quarters of the world, as
Eaſt, Weſt, North and South, and the reſt of the winds: Againe,
this circle deuideth the a
                           ••
                        ificial day from the artificial night for
al the while that the Sun is aboue the Horizon it is day, and whileſt
it is vnder the ſame it is night. And by this circle we knowe
what ſtarres doe continually appeare, and which are continually
hidden, alſo what ſtarres doe riſe and goe downe. Againe, in taking
the eleuation of the Pole, this circle is chieflie to be conſidedered,
for when we know how many degrées the Pole is raiſed aboue
the Horizon, then we haue the eleuation therof for that place.
For to euery ſeueral place, yea to euery little moment of the earth
in an oblique Spheare, belongeth his proper Horizon and ſeueral
altitude of the Pole, whereby it appeareth that the Horizons are
infinite and without number.
                     How ſhall I knowe in any place, hauing an oblique Horizon,
how much the Pole is eleuated aboue the Horizon?
                     That is declared in the ſecond booke of this Treatiſe, whereas
I ſpeake of the latitude and longitude of the earth, in the eight
chapter.
                  
                  
                     Of the Meridian, and of the vſes thereof.
Chap. 18.
                     
                        WHat is the Meridian?
                     It is a great immoouable circle paſſing through
the Poles of the world, and through the Poles of the
Horizon.
                     Why is it called the Meridian?
                     Becauſe that when the ſun riſing aboue the Horizon in the Eaſt,
cōmeth to touch this line with the center of his body, thē it is midday
or noontide to thoſe, through whoſe Zenith that circle paſſeth
And whē the ſun after his going down in the weſt cōmeth to touch
the ſelf line again in ye point oppoſit, it is to them midnight, & note
that diuers cities, hauing diuers latitudes, that is to ſay, being
diſtant one from another North and South bee it neuer ſo farre,
may haue one ſelfe Meridian: but if they be diſtant one from another
Eaſt and Weſt, bee it neuer ſo little, then they muſt needes
haue diuerſe Meridians, and ſuch diſtance betwixt the two ſeuerall

Meridians, is called the difference of longitude, whereof
we ſhall ſpeake hereafter more at large when we come to treat
of the longitude and latitude of the earth, which ſomething differeth
from the longitude and latitude of the Starres or Planets,
whereof we haue alreadie ſpoken in the 11. chapter.
                     How many Meridians be there?
                     The Aſtronomers doe appoint for euery two degrées of the
Equinoctiall a Meridian, ſo as they make in al 180. Albeit moſt
commonly in the Spheare they ſet downe but one, which ſerueth
for all by turning the bodie of the Spheare to it, which for that
cauſe is called the moouable Meridian. And in ſuch Spheares as
haue not a foote and a ſtanding Horizon, there is no Meridian at
all, but the two Colures are faine to ſupply their want, but all
terreſtriall Globes are commonly deſcribed with twelue Meridians,
cutting the Equinoctiall in 24. pointes, and deuiding the
lame into 24. ſpaces, euerie ſpace containing 15. degrées,
which is an houre, by meanes whereof we know how much ſooner
or latter it is noonetide in any place, for it is noontide ſooner
to thoſe whoſe Meridian is more Eaſtward then to them whoſe
Meridian is more Weſtward. And contrariwiſe the Eclpiſe of
the Sun or Moone appeareth ſooner to thoſe whoſe Meridian is
more Weſtward.
                     What other vſes hath this circle?
                     This circle deuideth the Eaſt part of the world from the Weſt
and alſo it ſheweth both the North and South, for by turning
your face towardes the Eaſt, you ſhall find the Sunne being in
that line at noone tide to be on your right hand right South, the
oppoſit part of which circle ſheweth on your left hand the North.
Alſo this circle by reaſon that it paſſeth through both the Poles
of the world, deuideth both the Equinoctiall and all his Paralels
into two equall parts aſwell aboue the Horizon as vnder the Horizon,
and by that means it deuideth the artificial day and artificiall
night each of them into two parts, that is to ſay, into two ſemidiurnal
& into two ſeminocturnal partes. For betwixt that part
of the Horizon where the ſun riſeth, mounting ſtil vntil he come
to this circle, which is at noontide, is contayned the firſt halfe of
the day, & the other half is from the ſame circle to the going down
of the Sun vnder the Horizon. And the firſt part of the night is

the ſpace betwixt the Suns going down and his comming again
to the Meridian, which is at midnight, and from thence to the
time of his riſing is the other half of the night, and alſo the Aſtronomers
take the beginning of their naturall day from this circle,
counting either from noontide to noontide, or els from midnight
to midnight. Againe, this circle ſheweth the right aſcentions and
declinations of the ſtarres, and the higheſt altitude, otherwiſe called
the Meridian altitude of the Sun or of any ſtarre, or degrée
of the Ecliptique, or of any other point in the firmament, all which
vſes and many others more you ſhal better vnderſtand hereafter,
when we come to ſhew the vſes of the globe aſwell terreſtriall as
celeſtiall.
                  
                  
                     Of the vertical circle, and vſes thereof.
Chap. 19.
                     
                        BVt here you haue to note that though the moſt part
of Geographers do ſet down in their Spheares but
6. great circles, yet there is another great circle called
the circle Verticall, which paſſeth right ouer our
heads through our zenith, whereſoeuer we be vpon
the land or ſea, croſſing our Horizon in 2. points oppoſite, and deuiding
the ſame into two equal parts, and ſuch kind of circles are
called in Arabicke Azimuthes, whereof you may imagine that
there be ſo many as there be rombes or winds in the Marriners
Compaſſe, which are in number 32. yea, and if you will, you may
make halfe ſo many as there be degrees in the Horizon, which are
in number 360. the halfe whereof is 180. If you be right vnder
the Equinoctiall, and doe goe or ſaile right Eaſt or Weſt, then
the Equinoctiall is your Verticall circle, and if you goe or
ſaile right North or South, then the Meridian is your verticall
circle, which two circles notwithſtanding do alwayes kéepe their
names. But in ſayling by any other rombe, that circle which is imagined
to paſſe from the true Eaſt point right ouer your head
vnto the true Weſt point, or which croſſeth your Meridian in the
zenith point with right Sphericall angles, is moſt properly called
the verticall circle, and the learned ſeamen haue great reſpect
to two ſpeciall kinds of Verticall circles, that is, the Magnetical
Meridian, and the Azimuth of the Sun.
                     
                        
What manner of verticall Circles be thoſe, and whereto
ſerue they?
                     M. Borrough in his diſcourſe of the variation of the Compaſſe,
defineth the Magneticall Meridian to be a great Circle, which
paſſeth through the Zenith and the Pole of the load ſtone called in
Latine Magnes, and deuideth the Horizon into two equall parts,
by croſſing the ſame in two points oppoſite. Againe the Azimuth
of the ſunne is a great Circle, paſſing through the Zenith & the
Centre of the ſunne in what part of the heauen ſo euer he be, ſo as
he be aboue the Horizon, which Circle deuideth the Horizon into
two equall parts, by croſſing the ſame in two points oppoſite, And
by helpe of theſe two Circles and a certaine inſtrument made of
purpoſe to giue a true ſhadowe, he teacheth to finde out the true
Meridiā of any place: And alſo to know how much any Mariners
Compaſſe doth varie from the true North and South, in Northeaſting
or Northweſting, whereof I ſhall ſpeake more at large
hereafter in my treatiſe of Nauigation.
                     What vſe is there of the verticall Circle or Azimuthes?
                     The verticall Circle ſheweth what time the Sunne or any other
ſtarre riſing beyond the true Eaſt point, is paſſed before the
Sunne or ſaide ſtarre, commeth to the true Eaſt or any other
rombe. Alſo in what Coaſt or part of heauen, the Sunne, Moone,
or any other ſtarre is at any time being mounted aboue the Horizon,
as whether it be Southeaſt or Northeaſt, or in any other
rombe: Alſo by helpe of the verticall Circle moſt properly ſo called,
are the twelue houſes of heauen ſet, according to Campanus
and Gazula. And by helpe of theſe Circles you may alſo knowe
how any place vpon the earth beareth one from another eyther
Eaſtward or Weſtward, and ſo foorth, for euery place hath his
ſeuerall Azimuth anſwerable to the Horizon and Zenith of the
ſaide place.
                     Of certaine Circles called Almicanterathes.
                     Since I haue ſpoken here ſomewhat of the verticall Circles
called Azimuthes, it ſhal not be amiſſe to ſhew you alſo that there
be other Circles to be conſidered of in the Spheare aſwell as in
the Aſtrolabe called Almicanterathes, that is to ſay, Circles of
Altitude, which though they be not all great Circles, for euery one

is leſſer then other procéeding from the oblique Horizon of anie
place to the Zenith of the ſaide place, yet the firſt Almicanterath
which is the verie oblique Horizon it ſelfe, is a great Circle
deuiding the Spheare into two equall partes, and all the reſt
are leſſer and leſſer, vntill you come to the very Zenith, and are
paralels to the Horizon, euen as the Tropiques and the other
leſſer Circles are paralels vnto the Equinoctiall and the Zenith
in Sphericall bodies is the Centre of them all, though it be not
ſo in Aſtrolabes, for there euery Almicanterath is fame to
haue his ſeuerall Centre, of which Circles there be in all 90.
according to the number of 90. degrées contayned betwixt the
oblique Horizon and the Zenith, and theſe Circles doe ſerue to
ſhewe the Altitude of the Sunne or Moone, or of any other
ſtarre fixed or wandring, being mounted at any time aboue the
oblique Horizon, which is eaſie to be founde by any Quadrant,
Croſſe-ſtaffe, or Aſtrolabe. But leauing to ſpeake any further of
theſe Circles, becauſe they are not vſed to bee deſcribed in
Spheares but onely in Aſtrolabes, I will nowe treate of the
foure leſſer Circles before mentioned, which are commonly ſet
downe in euery Spheare or Globe.
                  
                  
                     Of the foure leſſer circles, that is to ſay, the circle Arctique,
the circle Antarctique, the Tropique of Cancer, and the Tropique
of Capricorne, and alſo of the fiue Zones, that is to ſay,
two cold, two temperate, and one extremely hoat.
Chap. 20.
                     
                        WHich call you the leſſer Circles?
                     They are thoſe that doe not deuide the
Spheare into two equall parts, as the great
Circles doe, and of ſuch there be foure, that
is the two Polar circles, and the two Tropiques,
that is to ſay, the Tropique of Cancer,
and the Tropique of Capricorne, of
which Polar circles the one is called Arctique, and the other Antarctique,
and are made by the turning about of the two Poles of
the Zodiaque, which Poles being ſituated in the Colure of the

Solſtices are ſo farre diſtant from the Poles of the world, as is
the greateſt declination of the Sunne from the Equinoctial, which
is 23. degrées, 28′· as hath béene ſaid before.
                     Which is the Arctique Circle, and why is it ſo called?
                     The Arctique Circle is that which is next to the North pole,
and hath his name of this worde Arctos which is the great beare
or Charles wayne, which are ſeuen ſtarres placed next to this
Circle on the outſide thereof, and it is otherwiſe called the Septentrionall
Circle of this worde Septentrio, which is as much
to ſay as ſeuen Oxen, ſignified by the ſeuen ſtarres of the little
Beare, which doe mooue ſlowely like Oxen, and are placed all
within the ſayde Circle, and the bright ſtarre that is in the
tippe of the tayle of the ſayde little Beare, is called of the Mariners
the loade ſtarre or North ſtarre, whereby they ſayle on the
Sea, and the Centre of this Circle is the North Pole of the world
which is not to be ſéene with mans eye.
                     What is the Antarctique Circle?
                     It is that which is next vnto the South Pole, and it is ſo
called, becauſe it is oppoſite or contrarie to the Circle Arctique.
                     Now deſcribe the two Tropiques.
                     The Tropique of Cancer is a Circle imagined to bée betwixt
the Equinoctiall and the Circle Arctique, which Circle
the Sunne maketh when he entreth into the firſt degrée of Cancer,
which is about the twelfth or thirtéenth day of Iune being
then in his greateſt declination from the Equinoctiall Northwarde,
and nigheſt to our Zenith, béeing aſcended to the
higheſt point that hee can goe, at which time the dayes with
vs be at the longeſt, and the nightes at the ſhorteſt. And ſo
from thence hée declineth to the other Tropique called the Tropique
of Capricorne, which is a Circle imagined to bée betwixt
the Equinoctiall and the Circle Antarctique, which the
Sunne maketh when he entreth into the firſt degrée of Capricorne,
which is about the twelfth or thirtéenth day of December,
at which time he is againe in his greateſt declination from
the Equinoctiall Southwarde, and furtheſt from our Zenith:
whereby the dayes with vs bée then at the ſhorteſt, and the nights

at the longeſt: And note that theſe two Circles are called Tropiques
of this Gréeke worde Tropos, which is as much to ſay
as a conuerſion or turning, for when the Sunne arriueth to any
of theſe two Circles, hée turneth backe againe eyther aſcending
or deſcending, by reaſon of which foure Circles as well
the firmament as the earth is deuided into fiue Zones, that is
to ſay, two colde, two temperate, and one extremely hoat, otherwiſe
called the burnt Zone, of which fiue Zones, the foreſaide
foure Circles are the true boundes. For of the two colde
Zones, the one lyeth betwixt the North pole and the Circle
Arctique, and the other lyeth betwixt the South Pole and the
Circle Antarctique, and of the two temperate Zones, the one
lyeth betwixt the Circle Arctique, and the Tropique of Cancer,
and the other lyeth betwixt the Circle Antarctique, and the
Tropique of Capricorne, and the extreme hoat Zone lyeth betwixt
the two Tropiques, in the middeſt of which two Tropiques,
is the Equinoctiall line, as you may ſee in this figure,
and alſo in the Spheare or Globe it ſelfe.
                     
                        A figure ſhewing the fiue foreſaid Zones.
                     
                     
                        
Of which Zones the auncient men were wont to ſay that thrée
were vnhabitable, that is, the two colde, and the extreame hoat,
which experience ſheweth in theſe latter dayes to bee vntrue, as
we ſhall declare more at large when we come to treate of the diuiſion
of the earth: Againe you haue to vnderſtande that euerie
one of theſe leſſer Circles doth containe in length, 360. degrées
as well as euery one of the greater Circles, but the degrées are
not of like bigneſſe, no more then the Circles themſelues are like
in compaſſe or circuit, for the leſſer the Circles are in circuit, the
leſſer their degrées muſt néedes be.
                     Sith euery of the leſſer Circles differ one from another in
circuit, and thereby the degrees of euery Circle be leſſer then
other, how ſhall I know the true quantitie of euery degree in
ech Circle, and how many minutes are required in euery
leſſer degree proportionally to anſwere one degree of the Equinoctiall.
                     For the better knowledge hereof, you muſt firſt imagine that
there may be as many Circles made from the Equinoctiall towards
any of the Poles, as there be degrées of Latitude, which
are in number 90. as hath béene ſaide before: And the nigher that
any Circle is to the Equinoctiall, the greater it is in circuit,
and the further from the Equinoctiall towards any of the Poles,
the leſſer in circuit, and therefore more or leſſe minutes are requiſite
to anſwere to one degrée of the Equinoctiall, as you may
eaſily perceiue by this Table following, conſiſting of 6. collums,
euery front or head whereof is noted with three great letters,
D. M. S. ſignifying degrées, minutes and ſeconds, ſixe times
repeated, and in the beginning of the firſt colum on the left hand
is ſet downe one degrée, which is the firſt degrée of 90. & nigheſt
vnto the Equinoctiall, right againſt which one degrée is placed
towards the right hand, 59. minutes, and 59. ſeconds: and ſo
procéeding from degrée to degrée ſucceſſiuely, vntill you come to
90. you ſhall finde how many minutes and ſeconds doe anſwere
to one degrée of the Equinoctiall, and this Table will alſo ſerue
to ſhew the difference of miles in euery ſundry clyme or paralell,
whereof we ſhall ſpeake hereafter when we come to treat of the
earth.

one degree, in euery leſſer circle anſwerable to one degree of

                        HAuing briefely deſcribed all the Circles as
well greater as leſſer that are imagined to
be in the 8. heauen, I thinke it good now
to ſpeake ſomewhat of the ſtarres and celeſtiall
bodies placed in the ſaide heauen,
And firſt of their ſubſtance, & then of their
moouing, figure, ſhape, number, magnitude
or greatnes, alſo of their Longitude,

Latitude, declination, aſcention, deſcention both right and oblique,
and of the aſcentionall difference, and finally of the thréefold
Poeticall riſing and going downe of the ſtarres, but firſt of their
ſubſtance.
                     Of what ſubſtance are the ſtarres?
                     The ſtarres bee of the ſame ſubſtance that the heauens are
wherein they are placed, differing onely from the ſame in thicknes,
and therefore ſome defining a ſtarre doe ſay, that it is a bright
and ſhining bodie, and the thickeſt part of his heauen, apt both
to receiue and to reteine the light of the Sunne, and thereby is
viſible and obiect to the ſight: for the heauen it ſelfe being moſt
pure, thinne, tranſparent, and without colour is not viſible, and
for this cauſe the milke-white impreſſion in heauen like vnto a
white way called of the Aſtronomers Galaxia, and of the common
people our Ladies way is viſible to the eye, by reaſon that
it is thicker then any other part of the heauen.
                     Why are not the ſtarres ſeene as well in the day, as in
the night.
                     Becauſe they are darkened by the excellent brightneſſe of the
Sunne from whome they borrowe their chiefeſt light.
                  
                  
                     Of the moouing and ſhape of the ſtarres.
Chap. 22.
                     
                        WHat moouing haue the ſtarres?
                     The ſelfe ſame moouing that the heauen
hath wherein they are placed.
                     Whereby are the heauens mooued?
                     Some ſaye that the firſt mooueable
is turned by God himſelfe, and all the
reſt of the heauens euery one by his
proper intelligence, which though it
turneth his heauen about, yet it giueth neither life, ſenſe, nor vnderſtanding
thereunto, as ſome haue vntruely holden, affirming
the heauens to be liuing and intelligible bodies.
                     
                        
If the ſtarres haue no moouing of themſelues, wherof commeth
it then, that ſome ſeeme to our ſight ſometime nigher
and ſometime further off.
                     All the fixed ſtarres of the firmament are alwayes of like diſtance,
notwithſtanding by reaſon of the manifold moouing of the
firmament, wherein they are placed, they ſéeme to change their
places, and ſometime to bee more towardes the Eaſt or Weſt,
North or South. And whereas the vii. Planets called the wandring
ſtarres, do change their places now here now there, that
chanceth not by their owne moouing, but by the moouing of the
heauens wherein they are placed: for a ſtarre being round of ſhape
hath no members méete to walke from one place to another, but
onely changeth his place through the motion of his Spheare or
heauen wherein ſuch Planet is fixed.
                  
                  
                     Of the number of the ſtarres, and of their magnitude or
greatneſſe, and into how many Images they are deuided, and
how many ſtarres euery image containeth.
Chap. 23.
                     
                        MAy the ſtarres be numbred by man?
                     No, for as Dauid ſaith, that belongeth
onely to God, who as he created them, ſo
he can number them and call them all by
their names, notwithſtanding the Aſtronomers
by their induſtry and diligent obſeruation,
haue attained to the knowledge
of many: as firſt they know the ſeuenplanetes,
otherwiſe called the wandringe
ſtarres, and haue made manifeſt demonſtrations of their motions,
and by continuall obſeruation haue found out the manifold vertues,
powers and influences of the ſame, but of the fixed ſtarres
they could neuer finde more then 1022. and becauſe the ſtarres
are not equall in greatnes or bignes, they make fixe differences
of greatneſſe, appointing to the firſt difference 15. ſtarres, which
are bigger then all the reſt, whereof euery one containeth the
earth 207. times, to the ſecond difference 45. ſtarres, whereof

euery one containeth the earth 90. times. To the third they appoint
208. ſtarres, whereof euerie one containeth the earth 72.
times. To the fourth difference they appoint 474. ſtarres, wherof
euery one containeth the earth 54. times. To the fift they aſſigne
217. ſtarres, whereof euery one containeth the earth 57.
times. To the ſixt or laſt greatneſſe they appoint 49. ſmall ſtars,
whereof euery one containeth the earth 18. times, and ſome ſay
20. times. Beſides theſe there be 14. others, whereof 5. be called
clowdy and the other darke, becauſe they are not to be ſéene but of
a very quicke and ſharpe ſight. And you haue to note that the antient
Aſtronomers do deuide all the fixed ſtarres to them knowne
into 48. images, whereof they liken ſome to liuing things as to
men, women, beaſtes, monſters, foules, fiſhes, and créeping
wormes, and ſome to things without life, hauing ſome artificiall
ſhape, of which 48. images, they appoint 12. to the Zodiaque,
commonly called the 12. ſignes, as Aries, Taurus, Gemini,
Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus,
Aquarius and Piſces. Againe they place in the North part
of the firmament 21. images, and in the South part thereof 15.
images, which make in all 48. The deſcription of all which images,
together with their names hereafter followeth: and firſt I
will deſcribe vnto you the twelue Images contained in the Zodiaque.
                  
                  
                     Of the xij. Images or ſignes of the Zodiaque.
Chap. 24.
                     
                        THe twelue ſignes (as ſome affirme) doe
containe of the foreſaide number of fixed
ſtars 273. For the firſt ſigne called Aries,
that is to ſay, the Ramme, contayneth 13.
ſtarres, which Image or ſigne being placed
in the coniunction of the Zodiaque
with the Equinoctiall, hath his backe turned
towards the North, and his head towards
the Eaſt, and riſeth with his head, and goeth downe with
his féete. The ſecond ſigne called Taurus, that is to ſay, the Bull,
containeth 33. ſtarres, whereof there is one bright ſtarre of the

firſt bigneſſe called Oculus Tauri, that is to ſay, the Bulles eye,
who hath his head enclyning towardes the Weſt as though hée
looked towardes the earth, and riſeth and goeth downe with his
héeles vpwarde. The thirde Signe called Gemini, that is to
ſay the twinnes, doe contayne 18. ſtarres, their heades looking
towards the North, and their backes being ioyned together
doe embrace one another, and doe riſe lying, and doe goe downe
with their féete. The fourth Signe called Cancer, that is to
ſay, the Crabbe contayneth nine ſtarres, extending his féete towardes
both the Poles, and looking towards Leo, hath his bellie
turned towardes the earth, and hée riſeth and falleth with his
hinder part or backe part of his bodie. The fifth Signe called
Leo, that is to ſay the Lyon, contayneth ten ſtarres, whereof
there be two bright ſtarres of the firſt bigneſſe, the one in his
breaſt called Cor Leonis, and Regulus, that is to ſay the Lyons
heart, and the other in his tayle called Cauda Leonis, that is to
ſay, the Lyons tayle, who looketh towardes Cancer, and hauing
his backe turned towardes the North, he riſeth and goeth
downe with his head. The ſixth Signe called Virgo, that is to
ſay, the Uirgine, whoſe head is behinde the Lyon and toucheth
the Equinoctiall line with her left hande, holding in the ſame
hande an eare of corne, ſhée both ryſeth and goeth downe with
her head: this image contayneth ſixe and twentie ſtarres, whereof
there is one bright ſtarre of the firſt bigneſſe called Spica
Virginis, that is to ſay, an eare of corne. The ſeuenth Signe
called Libra, that is to ſaye the Ballance, contayning eight
ſtarres hath two ſkales, whereof the one hangeth towardes
the North, and the other towardes the South. The eight ſigne
called Scorpius, that is to ſay the Scorpion, contayneth one and
twentie ſtarres, who looketh towardes, Virgo, and extendeth his
féete towardes both the Poles, he boweth his tayle towardes the
North, hauing his belly turned towardes the earth, and he riſeth
and goeth downe bowing. The ninth Signe called Sagittarius,
that is to ſay the Archer, contayning one and thirtie
ſtarres, hath his head towardes the North, and looketh towards
the Scorpion, hauing a bowe and a ſhaft, whereof the bowe
toucheth his left hande and left foote, he riſeth right vppe, and
goeth downe headlong. The tenth Signe called Capricornus,
                        
that is to ſay, the Goate contayning eight and twentie ſtarres,
hath his backe turned towardes the North, and his heade towardes
the Archer, and turning himſelfe towardes Aquarius,
he riſeth right vp, and goeth downe headlong. The eleuenth
Signe called Aquarius, that is to ſaye, the water-bearer contayning
two and fourtie ſtarres, hath his heade towardes the
North, extending his left hande vppon the backe of Capricorne,
and with his right hande powreth out water out of his potte,
which bendeth towardes the Eaſt, runneth euen to Piſces, hée
riſeth and goeth downe with his heade before anie other of his
members. The twelueth Signe called Piſces, that is to ſay,
two Fiſhes, doe containe foure and thirtie ſtarres, whereof the
backe of the firſt is towardes the North, and the backe of the
ſeconde towardes the Weſt arme of Andromeda, and one of
the Fiſhes looketh towardes Aquarius, and the other towardes
the North, and betwixt theſe two Fiſhes is a certaine little line
wherewith their tayles are bounde together as it were with a
bond, the lower part of which Fiſhes, doth alwayes both ryſe
and goe downe, and not the vpper part: And though the 12.
Signes of the Zodiaque are ſaide to bée equall both in length
and breadth, that is to ſay, hauing thirtie degrées in length,
and twelue degrées in breadth, as hath béene ſayde before, yet
theſe Images are not equall, for ſome doe extende further then
the Zodiaque in breadth, and ſome are more then thirtie degrées
in length; As the Tables of Alphonſus doe manifeſtlie
ſhewe, who ſayeth there that the twelue Signes doe contayne
thrée hundred and fiftie ſtarres, for he appointeth to Aries eightéene,
to Taurus fourtie foure, to Gemini twentie fiue, to Cancer
thirtéene, to Leo thirtie fiue, to Virgo thirtie two, to Libra
ſeuentéene, to Scorpio twentie foure, to Sagittarius thirtie
and one, to Capricornus twentie eight, to Aquarius fourtie fiue,
to Piſces thirtie eight, which make in all thrée hundred and fiftie,
in which Tables are alſo ſet downe the Longitude, Latitude,
and Magnitude of the ſaide ſtarres, but the Longitude of the
ſayde ſtarres, is farre altered from that Longitude which they
had in his tune, whereof wée ſhall ſpeake héereafter more at
large.

and this Image containeth 4. little ſtarres.
                  
                  
                     Of the 15. Southerne Images.
Chap. 26.
                     
                        WHich be they?
                     Theſe hereafter following, whereof the firſt

his mouth a very faire ſtarre of the firſt bigneſſe called Syrius.
The ſixt is called Canis minor, that is to ſay, the leſſer Dogge,
without the which Orion his maſter would not be placed in heauen,
which hath but two ſtarres, whereof the one is in his flanke,

eight is called Hydra, that is to ſay, the Water-ſerpent which
Hercules ſlewe, or as ſome ſay which kept the water-bowle, and

Signes before mentioned, aſwell Northerne as Southerne, you
may ſée plainely deſcribed in euery celeſtiall Globe, and alſo ſet
foorth in Plano in the nether ende of Vopellius his vniuerſall
Map, that is to ſay the Northerne ſignes on the left ſide, and the
Southerne ſignes on the right ſide of the Mappe: Or in the front
of Planctius his great vniuerſall Mappe, who in the rondle repreſenting
the Southerne halfe of the celeſtiall Globe, ſetteth
down alſo certaine Southerne ſtarres lately found out by the trauellers
into the Indies, as the Croſſe, the Southerne Triangle,
Noe his Doue or Pigeon, and another in ſhape of a man called
Polophilax, ſo as there be now in all 19. Southerne Images.
                  
                  
                     Of the longitude of the fixed ſtarres, and of the proceſsion
of the vernall Equinoctiall point, and what it is.
Chap. 27.
                     
                        WHat is the Longitude of a ſtarre?
                     The Longitude of any ſtarre, is that Arke or
portion of the Ecliptique line which is contayned
betwixt the firſt point of Aries, and that Circle
which paſſeth through the Poles of the Zodiaque,

and alſo through the bodie of the ſtarre, as for example the ſtarre
called Cor Leonis is diſtant in theſe dayes from the vernall Equinoctiall
point of the Ecliptique line 143. degrées and 32′· and
thereby is found to be in the 23. degrée and 32′· of Leo, againe
the ſtarre called Spica Virginis in theſe dayes is diſtant from the
firſt point of Aries 198. degrées, and ſo is found to be in the eightéenth
of Libra.
                     
                     Why do you ſay in theſe dayes?
                     Becauſe the fixed ſtarres in proceſſe of time, doe change their
Longitude by reaſon of their proper moouing vpon the Poles of
the Zodiaque, which is from Weſt to Eaſt, for whereas Spica
Virginis in Ptolomies time was in the 26. degrée of Virgo, it is
found now to be in the 18. of Libra, the cauſe whereof is the preceſſion
of the Equinoctiall point or ſection.
                     Define what that Preceſsion is?
                     It is an Arke or portion of the Ecliptique line, contayned betwixt
two great Circles, both paſſing through the Poles of the
Zodiaque, in ſuch ſort as the one paſſeth through the firſt minute
of the vernall Equinoctiall point of the ſaide Ecliptique, and the
other Circle paſſeth through the firſt or former ſtarre of the Rams
horne, from which ſtarre the Aſtronomers doe make all the celeſtiall
motions and reuolutions to take their firſt beginning, and
this ſtarre in olde time paſt was knowne to be before the vernall
Equinoctiall point, which is the firſt moment of Aries, but now
it is found to haue paſſed that point ſo farre towardes the Solſticiall
point, as in theſe dayes it is knowne to be in the 27. degrée
and 42′· of Aries, and in proceſſe of time it will be cleane out of
Aries, and enter into Taurus.
                     
                  
                  
                     Of the Latitude of the fixed ſtarres.
Chap. 28.
                     
                        WHat is the Latitude of a ſtarre?
                     The Latitude is none other thing, but the diſtance
of any ſtarre from the Ecliptique line either
towards the North or South pole of the Zodiaque,
and ſuch Latitude neuer changeth or altereth,
for as the ſtarre Spica Virginis is at this

preſent two degrées diſtant from the Ecliptique line towards the
South, ſo it euer hath béene and euer ſhall be, and the like is to be
ſaid of all the reſt of the fixed ſtarres which do alwaies kéepe their
Latitude, be it Northward or Southward, néere to the Ecliptique
or farre from the ſame.
                  
                  
                     Of the Declination of the fixed ſtarres.
Chap. 29.
                     
                        WHat is the declination of a ſtarre?
                     The declination is none other thing,
but the diſtance of any fixed ſtarre from
the Equinoctiall, eyther Northward or
Southward, which is mutable as well as
the Longitude: for as the fixed ſtarres do
change their Longitudes, ſo alſo by little
and little they decline either more or
leſſe from the Equinoctiall: As for example, the declination of
the ſtarre called Canicula, that is to ſay the leſſer Dogge in the
yeare of our Lord, 138. when Ptolomie liued, was 15. degrées
44′· and 38″· towardes the South. But in theſe dayes the declination
of the ſaid ſtarre is but ſixe degrées and 7′· towardes the
South, and by reaſon that the fixed ſtarres in proceſſe of time doe
change their Longitude and declination, they are not alwayes vnder
one ſelfe ſigne, but doe flit out of one ſigne into another.
                     How is the Longitude, Latitude, and declination of anie
ſtarre to be knowne, and how are the ſtarres themſelues to be
knowne in the firmament.
                     The Longitude, Latitude, and declination of any ſtarre is to
be knowne moſt truely by the Aſtronomicall Tables calculated of
purpoſe, and you may know the ſame alſo without hauing regard
to euery ſmall minute, by helpe of the celeſtiall Globe, all the neceſſarie
vſes whereof I haue ſet downe in a little Treatiſe to be
added hereafter to this Booke, and there alſo I ſhew you how to
find out any ſtarre in the firmament that is deſcribed in the globe,
in which Globe are ſet downe as many ſtars as euer were known,
a few excepted towards the South pole, which were founde out
but of late dayes, of which ſtarres I ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake

hereafter in my Treatiſe of Nauigation. In the meane time I
will procéede to the aſcention and deſcention of the ſtarres both
right, meane, and oblique.
                  
                  
                     Of the aſcention and deſcention, that is the riſing and ſetting
of the ſtarres, aſwell according to the Aſtronomers, as according
to the Poets.
Chap. 30.
                     
                        DOe the Aſtronomers and Poets differ touching
this matter?
                     Yea they differ greatly, aſwell in name as in
matter: for whereas of the Poets it is called ortus
& occaſus Signorum, that is to ſay, the riſing and
falling of the Signes, ſo of the Aſtronomers it is called Aſcentio
& deſcentio Signorum, that is to ſay, the aſcention and deſcention
of the Signes, againe they differ in matter, or rather in manner,
for that the Aſtronomers do conſider the riſing and falling of
the ſtarres more exactly then the Poets, for the Aſtronomers do
conſider the degrées and minutes of the ſame, and alſo do ground
their aſcention and deſcention vpon more certain demonſtrations
then the Poets. Moreouer whereas the Poets by their manner
of riſing and falling, doe ſimply ſet downe the time of thinges
done or to be done, the Aſtronomers doe the ſame a great deale
more exactly, and by their manner of aſcention and deſcention doe
conſider the increaſe and decreaſe of the dayes, of which Aſtronomicall
aſcention and deſcention, I mind here to treate firſt in generall
and then in particular.
                  
                  
                     Of the Aſtronomicall aſcention and deſcention in generall
both right, meane, and oblique, and what a giuen Arke is.
Chap. 31.
                     
                        DEfine what the Aſtronomicall aſcention and deſcention
is.
                     Aſtronomicall aſcention is that portion or Arke of
the Equinoctiall line which riſeth together with ſome

giuen Arke of the Ecliptique line aboue the Horizon, and the deſcention
is that portion or Arke of the Equinoctiall that goeth
downe or ſetteth together with ſome giuen Arke of the Ecliptique
line vnder the Horizon, according to the moouing of the worlde
which is from Eaſt to Weſt.
                     What meane you by a giuen Arke?
                     A giuen Arke is as much to ſay as ſome ſuppoſed portion of
the Ecliptique or of any other Circle, as if you woulde knowe
the aſcention of ſome ſuppoſed portion of the Ecliptique, contayning
for example 25. or 30. degrées, here this portion of the
Ecliptique contayning that number of degrées, is called the
giuen Arke, of which Arkes ſome are called continuall, and
ſome deſcrete or deuided, which I minde to Engliſh here whole
and broken, for ſo I doe Engliſh quantitas, continua, & diſcreta
in my Logicke, That Arke is ſayde to bee continuall or
whole which taketh his beginning from the firſt point of Aries,
and ſo procéeding orderly, endeth at ſome other degrée of the
ſaide Ecliptique. And that Arke is called diſcrete or broken,
which doth not take his beginning from the firſt point of Aries,
but beginneth at ſome other degrée of the Ecliptique, as for example,
ſuppoſe that it beginneth at the fourtéenth of Taurus,
and endeth at the fiftéenth of Gemini, this Arke is called a deuided
or broken Arke, becauſe it doth not beginne at the firſt point
of Aries, and ſo procéede ſucceſſiuely: moreouer you haue to
vnderſtande that the auncient Aſtronomers doe commonly make
but two kindes of aſcention and deſcention, that is, right and
oblique, but there be in déede thrée kindes of aſcention, that is to
ſay, right, oblique, and meane aſcention.
                     When is any aſcention ſaide to bee right, oblique or
meane?
                     It is ſaide to be right, when that portion of the Equinoctiall
which riſeth or goeth downe together with the Ecliptique, is
greater or more in circuit then that of the Ecliptique. And it is
ſayde to be oblique, when that portion of the Equinoctiall which
riſeth or falleth together with the Ecliptique, is leſſer then that
of the Ecliptique, Againe that is ſayde to be meane aſcention,
when that portion of the Ecliptique which aſcendeth, is neyther
greater nor leſſer then that of the Equinoctiall, for as in

the right Spheare euery quarter of the Ecliptique hath a meane
aſcention, and equall to euery quarter of the Equinoctiall, beginning
the quarters at any of the foure principall pointes, ſo
if you take thrée ſignes in any other part of the Zodiaque, their
aſcentions will not agrée with a quarter of the Equinoctiall,
ſith there is no one ſigne that doth equally agrée with the like
portion of the Equinoctiall, and all this matter dependeth vppon
the knowledge of the vſe of certaine Circles before defined.
                     Which be they?
                     Theſe thrée, the Zodiaque, the Equinoctiall, and the Horizon:
for firſt the Zodiaque doth ſhewe the place of the Sunne,
that is to ſay in what degrée it is of any ſigne together with the
minutes of the ſame, and turning about euery day by the diurnall
motion, doth both appeare aboue the Horizon, and alſo is
hidden vnder the Horizon. Secondly the Equinoctiall with his
equall riſing and going downe, doth meaſure the time of the
ſunne whileſt he maketh his abode vnequally and diuerſely aboue
the Horizon. Thirdly the Horizon deuideth the one Hemiſpheare
from the other, on which Horizon is to be conſidered
what Angle any ſigne or ſtarre maketh therewith, in his aſcention
or deſcention, and according as any portion of the Ecliptique
riſeth or ſetteth rightly or obliquely, ſo in reſpect of the
Angle which it maketh with the Horizon, it is called a right or oblique
aſcention or deſcention.
                     Why ſhould the aſcentions and deſcentions be meaſured
rather by the equinoctiall line then by the Ecliptique, ſith the
courſe of the ſunne meaſureth all times?
                     The cauſe thereof is the obliquitie of the Zodiaque, hauing
diuerſe and variable ſituations, whereby the ſunne abideth ſometimes
a great while aboue the Horizon, and ſometimes but a little
while, all which inequalitie is onely to be meaſured by the Equinoctiall,
which is alwayes equally mooued vppon his Poles.
Hitherto of the Aſtronomicall aſcention and deſcention in generall,
nowe of all thrée aſcentions and deſcentions in particular.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the right, oblique, and meane aſcention in particular,
and of the chiefeſt cauſes of ſuch diuerſitie of aſcentions.
Chap. 32.
                     
                        ANd for the better vnderſtanding of the Aſtronomicall
aſcention and deſcention, wee will
make this diuiſion, for either it is of ſome
point or ſtarre, or elſe of ſome portion of a
Circle chiefely of the Ecliptique line. In the
aſcention of any point or ſtarre, wee conſider
two thinges. Firſt what Angle it maketh with
the Horizon either right or oblique. Secondly
the time from the riſing of the firſt minute of Aries, which is
the firſt beginning of the Longitude of any ſtarre or Circle in
heauen, and in reſpect of the Angle euery aſcention is ſayd to be
right in a right Spheare, and oblique in an oblique Spheare: Againe
the time of the aſcention is to be meaſured by the degrées of
the Equinoctiall from the firſt minute of Aries, vnto that degrée
and minute of the Equinoctiall which aſcendeth together with
the ſtarres, And note by the way that 15. degrées of the Equinoctiall
do make an houre, and foure doe make one degrée of the
ſame Equinoctiall, for foure times 15. doe make 60. minutes,
which is an houre, Againe euery aſcention conſidered, according
to the time of his gate, is eyther right, oblique, or meane: if it be
right, it is ſlowe: if it be oblique, it is quicke: if it be meane, it
is equall. Now the aſcention of any Arke or portion of a Circle is
alſo eyther right, oblique, or meane: if it be right, it aſcendeth
ſlowely: if oblique, it aſcendeth quickely: if meane, it aſcendeth
equally. And the better to vnderſtand all theſe thrée kindes of aſcentions,
I will ſet downe theſe twelue rules heere following,
whereof fiue doe belong to the right Spheare, and ſeuen to the
oblique.
                     In the right Spheare all the foure quarters riſing from the
foure principall points, haue a meane aſcention, and ſo hath all
the foure points themſelues.
                     In the right Spheare all thoſe ſignes that be equally diſtant
from the foure principall points haue equall aſcentions.
                     
                        
3 In the right Spheare all ſtarres or pointes that be in the Solſticiall
Colure haue meane aſcention.
                     4 In the right Spheare thoſe ſignes that do aſcend rightly, doe
deſcend rightly, and thoſe that doe aſcend obliquely, doe deſcend
obliquely.
                     5 In the right Spheare, Gemini, Cancer, Sagittarius, and
Capricornus, doe aſcende rightly, and all the reſt obliquely.
                     6 In the oblique Spheare, the two Equinoctiall points haue
meane aſcention.
                     7 In the oblique Spheare ech halfe of the Spheare, beginning
at eyther of the Equinoxes haue meane aſcention: but this rule
holdeth not, if that you beginne any other where.
                     8 In the oblique Sphere, thoſe ſignes that do aſcend rightly, do
deſcēd obliquely, & thoſe which aſcend obliquely do deſcēd rightly.
                     9 In the oblique Spheare, the aſcention of any ſuppoſed ſigne
is equall to the deſcention of his oppoſite ſigne, and the deſcention
of any ſuppoſed ſigne, is equall to the aſcention of his oppoſite
ſigne.
                     10 In the oblique Spheare, the aſcention of any ſigne being added
to his deſcention, is equall to the aſcention and deſcention of
the ſame ſigne being in the right Spheare.
                     11 In the oblique Sphere euery two ſignes equally diſtant from
the two points of the Equinoctiall, haue equall aſcentions and
deſcentions.
                     12 In the oblique Sphere vnder the pole Arctique, al ſignes from
Cancer to Capricorne, do aſcend rightly, and all the reſt obliquely,
but contrariwiſe vnder the Pole Antarctique.
                     What is the chiefe cauſe of the diuerſity of aſcentions and
deſcentions, aſwell in the right as in the oblique Spheare?
                     The chiefe cauſe is the diuerſity of the Angles which the Zodiaque
maketh with the Horizon, for the ſharper that the Angles
be the leſſer portion of the Equinoctiall riſeth together with the
Ecliptique, and the righter that the Angles be, the greater portion
of the Equinoctial riſeth, but the Equinoctiall by reaſon of his
vniformitie, maketh his Angles alwayes equall one to another,
that is to ſay, in the right Spheare, it maketh right Angles, and
in the oblique Spheare, though not right, yet in euery ſigne it
maketh like Angles.
                  
                  
                     
                     How to know the diuerſities of the aſcentions and deſcentions,
as well in the right as oblique Spheare.
Chap. 33.
                     
                        THat is to be knowne moſt exactly by the
Tables of aſcentions calculated of purpoſe
by Iohannes de Monte Regio, and
by Reinholdus called in Latine Tabulae
directionum, and you may knowe it alſo
without hauing reſpect to euery minute
by marking and obſeruing the ſame in a
materiall Spheare or Globe, that hath a
ſtanding foote with a firme Horizon, for if you will know the diuerſities
of aſcentions in a right Spheare, then you muſt lay the
Spheare or Globe ſo as the Horizon may paſſe through both the
Poles, and in turning about with your hand the Equinoctiall, together
with the Ecliptique from Eaſt to Weſt, marke with what
degrée of the Equinoctiall any ſigne beginneth to aſcend, & marke
that degrée of the Equinoctiall with a little peece of waxe, then
turne the Globe or Spheare towardes the Weſt, vntill the laſt degrée
of the ſayd ſigne doe appeare iuſt with the vpper edge of the
Horizon, and then marke what degrée of the Equinoctiall is aunſwerable
to the ſaid laſt degrée of the foreſaid ſigne, and there ſet
another péece of waxe, then count the degrées of the Equinoctiall
contayned betwixt thoſe two markes, and if it be more then 30.
that ſigne is ſaid to aſcend rightly, if it be leſſe then 30. then that
ſigne aſcendeth obliquely, if it be iuſt 30. then it hath a meane aſcention,
& by allowing 15. degrées of the Equinoctial to an houre,
and 4′· to a degrée, you ſhall know in what time that ſigne riſeth.
As for example if you would know what aſcention the whol ſigne
Taurus hath in a right Spheare, and alſo in what time it riſeth,
doe thus, Firſt lay both the Poles of the Spheare iuſt vpon the
Horizon, ſo as the ſame Horizon may paſſe through both ye poles,
then bring the firſt point of Taurus to the Eaſt part of the Horizon,
ſo as it may touch the vpper brimme or edge of the Horizon,
and ſtaying it there with your hande, looke what degrée of the Equinoctiall
doth alſo touch the Horizon at that inſtant, which
you ſhall finde to be 27. degrées 54′· and marke that degrée of
the Equinoctiall with a little péece of waxe, or ſome other thing

that may be eaſily put out or taken away, that done, put forwarde
the foreſaid ſigne Taurus ſtill towardes the Weſt, vntill the laſt
degrée of the ſaide ſigne be aſcended vp euen to the vpper edge of
the Horizon, and there ſtaying it with your hande, looke againe
what degrée of the Equinoctiall doth riſe withall, which you ſhall
finde to be 57. degrées 48′· and there ſet another marke vppon
the Equinoctiall, then by telling the degrées conteyned in the
Equinoctiall betwixt the two markes, you ſhall finde the number
of degrées to be 29. degrées 54′· and by allowing 15. degrées to
one houre, and 4′· to a degrée, you ſhall finde that the whole ſigne
Taurus ſpendeth in his riſing one houre, 59′· 36″· But now ſith
the Meridian in any place (as hath béene ſaid before) doth alwaies
ſhew the right aſcention of any ſtarre, ſigne, arke, or point, becauſe
that cutteth both the Equinoctiall and the Horizon with
right Angles: you may therefore find the right aſcention of the
ſayd ſigne, or of any other ſigne or ſtarre without remoouing the
Spheare from your owne eleuation or Latitude in this manner
following, bring the firſt degrée of Taurus cloſe to the mooueable
Meridian, and there ſtaying it marke what degrée of the Equinoctiall
the Meridian cutteth at that preſent, which you ſhall find
to be 27. degrées 54′· which is the right aſcention of the firſt point
of Taurus, then hauing brought the laſt point of Taurus to the
foreſaide Meridian, marke what degrée of the Equinoctiall the
ſayd Meridian cutteth at that preſent, and you ſhall finde it to bée
the 57. degrées 48′· now by counting vpon the Equinoctiall, the
degrées conteyned betwixt thoſe two markes, you ſhall finde the
number to be 29. degrées 54′· and you may finde the ſelfe ſame
number by ſubtracting the right aſcention of the firſt point of
Taurus, out of the right aſcention of the laſt point of Taurus,
& thereby you ſhal know the time of his riſing to be the ſame that
you found in the right Spheare. Now if you would know the aſcention
of any ſigne in an oblique Spheare, then hauing placed
your Spheare according to your Latitude, which for example
ſake ſuppoſe to be 52. degrées, and that in ſuch Latitude you
would know what aſcention the whole ſigne Taurus hath, and in
what time he riſeth, you muſt firſt bring the firſt degrée of Taurus
to the Eaſt part of the Horizon, ſo as it may méete euen with
the vpper edge of the Horizon, and there ſtaying it, marke what

degrée of the Equinoctiall riſeth therewith, which you ſhall finde
to be 12. degrées 48′· and hauing marked that degrée, put forward
the foreſaid ſigne Taurus towards the Weſt vntill the laſt degrée
thereof be aſcended vp to the vpper edge of the Horizon, and then
make another marke vpon the point of the Equinoctiall, which
riſeth at that inſtant with the laſt degrée of Taurus, which you ſhal
finde to be 29. degrées 42′· and by counting the degrées contained
in the Equinoctiall betwixt the two markes, or by taking the leſſer
aſcention out of the greater, you ſhall finde the number of degrées
to be 16. and 54′· whereby you may conclude that the aſcention
of Taurus in that Latitude is oblique, and that he ſpendeth in his
riſing one whole houre 7′· 36″· And looke what order is héere
taught to finde out the aſcention of any ſigne, the ſame order is
to be obſerued for the finding out of the deſcention of any ſigne,
ſauing that you muſt ſéeke for the deſcention of any ſigne in the
Weſt part of the Horizon of the Spheare or Globe, and not in
the Eaſt part. As for example, if you would knowe what deſcention
Taurus hath, and in what time he deſcendeth in the foreſaide
Latitude: here hauing brought the firſt degrée of Taurus to the
Weſt part of the Horizon, ſo as it may touch the vpper edge therof,
and hauing alſo marked what point or degrée of the Equinoctiall
toucheth the ſame Horizon at that inſtant, which you ſhal find
to be 42. degrées 30′· ceaſe not to turne the Spheare or Globe,
vntill all the whole ſigne of Taurus be deſcended vnder the Horizon,
and that the laſt degrée thereof doe méete iuſt with the vpper
edge of the Horizon, and there ſtay it vntill you haue againe marked
that point of the Equinoctiall which toucheth the Horizon at
that inſtant, which you ſhall finde to be 84. degrées 54′· and by
counting the degrées contained betwixt the two markes on the Equinoctiall,
you ſhall find the number of degrées to be 42. degrées
24′· ſo as you may conclude that the deſcention of Taurus in that
Latitude is right, and that he ſpendeth in his going downe two
houres 48′·
                     How ſhall I knowe the right or oblique aſcention of any of
the fixed ſtarres, and alſo at what houre of the day or night
they riſe & ſet, and how long they abide aboue the Horizon:
finally when they are at the higheſt, and when they are at the
loweſt, called the depreſsion or loweſt Meridian Altitude of

the ſtarres?
                     All theſe things are moſt truely knowne by Tables calculated
of purpoſe, and alſo they are to be knowne by helpe of the celeſtiall
Globe in ſuch manner as ſhall be declared hereafter when we
come to treate of the ſaid Globe.
                  
                  
                     Of the aſcentionall difference and vſes thereof.
Chap. 34.
                     
                        WHat is the aſcentionall difference?
                     It is a portion of the Equinoctiall, wherby
is knowne how much the right aſcention
and oblique aſcention of any ſtar, or portion
of the Ecliptique line, or any other point in
the firmament, doth differ one from another,
As for example in that place where the Pole
is eleuated 52. degrées, the right aſcention of the firſt point of
Taurus is 27. degrées and 54′· and the oblique aſcention of the
ſame point is 12. degrées 48′· here by taking the leſſer out of the
greater, that is 12. degrées 48′· out of 27. degrées and 54′· there
will remaine 15. degrées and 6′· which is the aſcentionall difference.
                     What vſes hath the aſcentionall difference?
                     The aſcentionall difference being knowne, all the oblique aſcentions
and deſcentions of the ſtarres are eaſily knowne by the
Tables of directions, againe by this difference is knowne the increaſe
and decreaſe of the artificiall day in euery Latitude, and
therefore it is called of ſome incrementum diêi. Moreouer it
ſheweth the ſemi-diurnall Arke of the artificiall day, for in euery
oblique Spheare the artificiall day is alwayes either longer or
ſhorter then the Equinoctiall day throughout the yeare, vnleſſe
the ſunne be in either of the Equinoctiall points.
                     How is the increaſe or decreaſe of the day to be knowne
by the aſcentionall defference?
                     That ſhall be declared hereafter in the 50. Chap. of this firſt
booke, whereas wee treat of the artificiall day and night, in the
meane time we will ſpeake ſomewhat of the poeticall riſing and
ſetting of the ſtarres.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the Poeticall riſing and ſetting of the ſtarres.
Chap. 35.
                     
                        DEfine what the Poeticall riſing and ſetting
is.
                     The Poeticall riſing is the appearing
of ſome ſtarre aboue the Horizon, determined
by the ſunne, and the Poeticall ſetting,
is either the going downe of ſome
ſtarre vnder the Horizon, or elſe the hiding
thereof vnder the beames of the ſunne.
                     How manifold is the Poeticall riſing and ſetting?
                     Thréefold, that is, Coſmicus, Acronicus, and Heliacus, the
ſignification of which wordes ſhall appeare vnto you by the definitions
of the foreſaid thrée kindes here following: For ortus Coſmicus,
called in Latine mundanus, which is aſmuch to ſay here
as the worldly or morning riſing, is when any ſtarre riſeth in the
morning aboue the Horizon, together with the ſunne, or rather
with that point of the Ecliptique line wherein the ſunne is at that
time. And the Coſmicall ſetting, called in Latine occaſus Coſmicus,
is when a ſtarre goeth downe vnder the Horizon at ſuch time
as the ſunne riſeth, ſo as this kind of riſing and ſetting is wholly
to be referred to the riſing of the ſunne.
                     What is Ortus and occaſus Acronicus?
                     
                     
                        Ortus Acronicus which is as much to ſay as the Euening or
temporall riſing, is when any ſtarre riſeth aboue the Horizon in
the Euening at the going down of the ſunne: And occaſus Acronicus,
that is to ſay, the Euening ſetting is when any ſtarre goeth
downe vnder the Horizon, together with the ſunne, and therfore
this kind is alwaies to be referred to the going downe of the
ſunne, and not to his riſing: And whatſoeuer ſigne or ſtarre doth
riſe Acronicè, the ſame goeth downe Coſmicè, and whatſoeuer
ſtarre doth riſe Coſmicè, the ſame goeth downe Acromicè. And
generally all ſtarres that riſe in the day time, are ſaide to riſe
Coſmicè, and all thoſe that riſe in the Euening after the ſunne
ſet, are ſaid to riſe Acronicè.
                     
                     
                        
                        What is Ortus & occaſus Heliacus.
                     
                        Ortus Heliacus, that is to ſay, the Solar riſing, is when any
ſtar by departing from the beames of the Sun appeareth, & may
be ſéen, which before being darkned by the ſunne could not be ſéen,
And occaſus Heliacus, is when any ſtarre by the nigh approching
of the ſunne ceaſeth to bee ſéene, for by reaſon that the ſunne by
his yearely courſe & oblique motion of the Ecliptique, doth ſometime
approch to diuerſe ſtarres, and ſometime by little and little
retireth backe againe from the ſame, it falleth out that thoſe ſtars
to whom he approcheth, are by nighneſſe of his great light, darkned
and not ſéene, and by his departing from them, and eſpecially
when the ſunne is in the Eaſt or Weſt part of the firmament, they
beginne againe to be ſéene. And therefore as in the other 2. kinds,
the Horizon together with the riſing and ſetting of the ſunne, are
to be conſidered as chiefe cauſes thereof, ſo in this laſt kinde the
chiefe cauſe is to be referred to the highneſſe or farreneſſe of the
ſunne from the ſtarre.
                     Whereto ſerueth the knowledge of this threefold Poeticall
riſing and ſetting of the ſtarres?
                     It ſerueth chiefely to vnderſtand thereby thoſe Poets and Hiſtroriographers,
which in ſhewing the time of any act done or to
be done, doe not ſet downe the day of the moneth, but are wont to
deſcribe the time by the riſing or ſetting of ſome notable ſtarre,
which they thinke moſt méete for their purpoſe, and thereby doe
greatly adorne their ſtile, and ſpecially being poeticall: And becauſe
that the times wherein ſuch ſtarres did riſe or ſet, do greatly
differ in theſe dayes from the auncient times. Many therefore
of our moderne writers, as Garceus and others, haue made diueſe
Tables of purpoſe to finde out the difference, and thereby to
come to the true knowledge of the times by the auncient men deſcribed,
of which matter I leaue to ſpeake, thinking it not méete
to trouble young Saylers therewith, for whom I chiefely wrote
this Treatiſe of the Spheare.
                     Yet ſome affirme that the auncient men did vſe the foreſaid
poeticall riſing and ſetting of certaine ſtarres, and ſpecially
of the Pleiades, Hiades, Orion, Arcturus, Capella, and Lira,
(which ſtarres were to them beſt knowne) as a Kalender not
onely to know thereby the difference of times, and ſeaſons of

the yeare: but alſo by their manner of riſing, ſetting, hiding,
and appearing to prognoſticate and to fore-ſee tempeſts and
ſtormes, yea and that in theſe daies wee alſo (as ſome write)
might doe the like, though there were neither Kalender nor
Ephemerides, and in that reſpect the knowledge hereof ſeemeth
moſt neceſſarie for Mariners.
                     All ſuch things are to be knowne more exactly by the Aſtronomicall
aſcention and deſcention, then by the Poeticall riſing or ſetting
of the ſtarres: And you haue to vnderſtande that the ſtarres
ſince thoſe dayes haue changed their places, their longitudes, and
declinations, and thereby in diuerſe reſpects haue altered their
Natures and qualities, yea and the very ſignes themſelues: As
for example, neither Taurus, Gemini, nor Cancer, is ſo hoat and
dry now, as in times paſt, neither doth Scorpio cauſe ſo much
thunder now, as in times paſt, ſome againe are more or leſſe cold
and moyſt then they haue béene heretofore, the cauſes whereof I
leaue to the diſcuſſing of the Aſtrologers, and ſo once againe
ende with this matter.
                  
                  
                     Of time, what it is, and into what parts it is deuided.
Chap. 36.
                     
                        MOſt men that write of the Spheare, after
they haue ſpoken of the aſcentions, doe
immediatly treate of the diuerſitie and inequalitie
of dayes and nightes, but ſith
dayes, nights, and houres, are but parts
of time, like as be wéekes, moneths, and
yeares, I mind here therefore firſt briefly
to treat of time, and then of all his chiefeſt
parts in order, for if you will be inſtructed
at large of theſe matters, then read the booke of Iohannes de ſacro
Buſto de anni ratione, and alſo Iohannes Garceus his booke
de tempore.
                     
                     How define you time?
                     Leauing to ſpeake of time, without time, that is to ſay euerlaſting
and infinite, called of the Latines Eternitas, aſcribed

chiefely to God, & therefore not contained within the mooueable
Spheares or heauens: I mind to ſpeake here onely of that time
which is a number meaſuring the moouing of the firſt mooueable,
and of all other mutable thinges, which time had his beginning
with the world, and ſhall ende with the ſame, and this time conſiſteth
of two parts, that is firſt, and laſt, or rather before or after,
ſucceſſiuely following one another, and theſe two partes are knit
together with a common bound called of the Latines Nunc, that
is to ſay now, or at this preſent, which is the end of that which
went before, and the beginning of that which followeth after, and
therefore ſome doe deuide time into thrée parts, that is, time paſt,
time preſent, and time to come, but the time preſent is a moment
indiuiſible, and is the beginning of time, euen as a point or pricke
is the beginning of all Magnitudes, & yet leaſt part therof it ſelfe:
Againe time is deuided of ſome into greater and leſſer parts, the
greater are ſuch as theſe: Kalendes, Nones, Ides, a wéeke, a
month, a yeare, the ſpace of fiue yeares, called of the Romaines
Luſtrum, and of the Gréeks Olympias, the Romaines did call it
Luſtrum a luſtrando, that is to ſay, of going about, becauſe that
they vſed in the end of euery fiue yeares, with lights and torches
of waxe to goe in preceſſion round about the Citie, and did purge
the ſame by ſacrifiſing a Dogge, a Sowe, and an Oxe, and at that
time alſo they did chuſe their Dictator in a place called the fielde
of Mars, but the ſpace of fiue yeares called Olimpias, tooke his
name of the high mount Olympus in Greece, whereas in the end
of euery fiue yeares were celebrated all kind of martiall playes,
as Fencing, Wreſtling, Running, and ſuch like in the honour of
Iupiter Olympicus, alſo the ſpace of 15. yeares called indictio,
in which ſpace thoſe forraine Nations that dwelt farre off, and
were tributary to the Romaine Empire, payd their tributes, that
is to ſay, in the firſt fiue yeares they payde onely gold, in token of
their obedience to the Empire: In the ſecond fiue yéeres they paid
ſiluer for Souldiers wages, and in the laſt fiue yeares they paide
braſſe towardes the reparation of armour and munition. Item
the ſpace of an hundred yeares, called in Latine ſeculum, and in
Engliſh an age, wherof the playes that were celebrated in Rome
euery hundred yeare, were called Ludi ſeculares, and laſt of all
the ſpace of a thouſand yeares, called aeuum, contayning tenne

ages, againe the leſſer partes (as Iohannes de ſacro Buſto ſaith)
are theſe fiue, the firſt is called in Latine quadrans, which is the
fourth part of a day, that is ſixe houres: The ſeconde punctus,
which is the fourth part of an houre in the ſunnes account, but in
the Moones account the fift part of an houre: The third is called
momentum, which is the tenth part of punctus: The fourth
is called vncia, which is the twelfth part of momentum: The
fift is called Atomus, which is the 48. part of vncia. But becauſe
in all the greater parts of time, there is no greater variation
or difference, then in that which in Latine is called annus,
and in Engliſh a yeare. I mind here therefore firſt to treat of a
yeare, and then of monethes, wéekes, dayes, nights and houres.
                  
                  
                     Of the yeare, and of his diuerſe kindes, and of the diuerſe
computations had thereof in diuerſe ages, and amongſt diuers
Nations.
Chap. 37.
                     
                        BE there diuerſe kindes of differences of
yeares?
                     Yea indéede, but I will ſpeake here only
of thrée kindes or differences, that is of
the great yeare, the Solar yeare, and the
Lunar yeare, whereof the two laſt are
moſt neceſſarie for our purpoſe.
                     What is the great yeare?
                     The great yeare is a ſpace of time in
the which not onely all the Planets, but alſo all the fixed ſtarres
that are in the firmament, hauing ended all their reuolutions do
returne againe to the ſelfe ſame places in the heauens, which they
had at the firſt beginning of the world: And therefore it is called
of ſome the yeare of the world, and of ſome the great yeare of
Plato, which contayneth according to Alphonſus, 49/000.
yeares, whereof we haue ſpoken before, yet ſome affirme that
the perfect yeare of the worlde containeth but 36000. yeares,
whoſe reuolution is after one degrée in 100. yeares, but leauing
this matter as not greatly profitable, we will ſpeake now of the
yeare Solar.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the ſunnes yeare called in Latine annus ſolaris, and of the
diuerſe kinds thereof, and firſt of the Tropicall yeare, both equall
and vnequall.
Chap. 38.
                     
                        WHat is the yeare Solar?
                     It is that ſpace of time in which the ſunne
departing from any point of the Ecliptique
line, or from ſome fixed ſtarre of the Zodiaque,
goeth round about the Zodiaque by
his owne proper moouing, which is from
Weſt to Eaſt, and ſo returneth againe to the
ſelfe ſame point or ſtarre from which he firſt departed, and the
Aſtronomers doe make diuerſe diuiſions of the Solar yeare, for
firſt they ſay that it is eyther Aſtronomical or Politicall: Secondly
that the Aſtronomicall yeare is eyther Tropicall or Syderall.
Thirdly that the Tropicall is either equall or vnequall, which
vnequall yeare they otherwiſe call the apparant yeare, and true
yeare, all which kindes haue in a manner one ſelfe definition, ſauing
that the Tropicall yeare taketh his beginning from the vernall
Equinoctiall point, and the Syderall yeare from the former
ſtarre of the Rams horne, and doe differ chiefely in quantitie.
                     Shew then what quantitie, that is to ſay, how many daies,
houres, and minutes euery ſuch yeare conteyneth.
                     The equall Tropicall yeare being counted alwayes from the
middle point of the vernall Equinoxe, contayneth 365. dayes, fiue
houres, 49′· 15″· and 46‴· But the vnequall or apparant Tropicall
yeare conteyneth ſometime more and ſometime leſſe then
the equall yeare, for ſometime beſides the 365. dayes and fiue
houres, it amounteth to 56′· 53″· and 1‴· ſo as it is more then the
equall Tropicall yeare by 7′· 37″· and 15‴· and ſometime ouer
and beſides the foreſaid 365. dayes and fiue houres, it onely contayneth
42′· 38″· and 27‴· which is leſſe then the equall Tropicall
yeare by 6′· and 3‴· which inequalitie chiefely chanceth by reaſon
of the vnequall preceſſion of the two Equinoctiall points before
defined in the 26. Chapter.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the Syderall yeare, and how much it containeth.
Chap. 39.
                     
                        WHat is the Syderall yeare?
                     The Syderal or ſtarry yeare is that ſpace
of time wherein the ſunne walking vnder
the firmament, departeth from the firſt or
foremoſt ſtarre of the Rams horne, and returning
to the ſame ſtarre againe, which
ſpace of time alwayes and equally contayneth
365. dayes, ſixe houres, 9′· and 39″· ſo
as this yeare is alwayes greater then the Tropicall yeare, and
by his equalitie doth alwayes rule and rectifie the inequalitie of
the Tropicall yeare.
                  
                  
                     Of the Politicall yeare, and diuerſe kinds thereof.
Chap. 40.
                     
                        WHat is the Politicall yeare?
                     It is a yearely ſpace of time which any people
or nation attributeth to the courſe of the
Sunne or of the Moone or of eyther of them
which is diuerſe and manifold, according to the
diuerſe cuſtomes of the Nations, of all which I
meane not to ſpeake at this preſent particularly, but of certaine
ſpeciall and neceſſary to be knowne, as of the Iulian yeare, of the
Egyptian yeare, of the Iewes yeare, and of the Athenian yeare.
                  
                  
                     Of the Iulian yeare, and why it is ſo called.
Chap. 41.
                     
                        WHat is the Iulian yeare?
                     The Iulian yeare is that which we vſe at this preſent
day which of all other yeares draweth nigheſt
vnto the Tropicall yeare, for this yeare conſiſteth of

365. dayes and ſixe houres, which ſixe houres, if it ſhould be reckoned
euery yeare, it would make a great confuſion, and therefore
it is reckoned at the end of euery fourth yeare, which yeare
conſiſteth of 366. dayes, for foure times ſixe doth make 24.
houres, which is one whole naturall day, whereof that yeare is
called the leape yeare, And thereby the Iulian yeare is ſayd to be
two fold, that is common, contayning 365. dayes, and the other
biſſextile or leape yeare, contayning 366. dayes This worde
biſſextile is deriued of bis and ſextus, becauſe the ſixth day next
before the Kalends of March is twice repeated or reckned, which
indeede is the 25. of Februarie, vpon which day the feaſt of Saint
Mathias commonly falleth.
                     Why was it called the Iulian yeare?
                     Becauſe Iulius Caeſar the firſt Monarch of the Romaine Empire
cauſed the yeare (according to the courſe of the Sunne) to
be reduced to the number of dayes and houres before expreſſed,
who brought an excellent Aſtronomer with him at his comming
from Egypt, aſwell for that purpoſe as to teach the Mathematicall
diſciplines vnto the Romaines, yet you haue to conſider that
the Iulian yeare being greater then the Tropicall yeare, doth
cauſe great diuerſitie in that it maketh aſwell the Equinoctiall &
Solſticiall points, as alſo the entrance of the Sun into the other
ſignes by little & little to anticipate or to runne before, for whereas
in Iulius Caeſars time the vernall Equinox was the 23. day of
March, the ſame Equinox is now about the 11. day of March,
which is ſooner by 12. dayes.
                  
                  
                     Of the Egyptian yeare, and how many daies
it containeth.
Chap. 42.
                     
                        THe Egyptian yeare contayneth the iuſt number
of 365. dayes, by reaſon of which equalitie this
yeare is very fit to ſerue the Aſtronomers turne
in making their Aſtronomicall computations,
but the Egyptian yeare hath no certaine place
of beginning: For by omitting the ſixe houres
which is the Iulian yeare, it doth anticipate in the ſpace of 4.

yeares one whole day in ſuch ſort, as 1460. Iulian yeares doe
make of the Egyptian yeares. 1461.
                  
                  
                     How many Moones the Iewes yeare, and the Athenians
yeare doth containe.
Chap. 43.
                     
                        THe Iewes yeare contayneth for the moſt
part twelue Moones, and ſometimes thirtéene
Moones, which kinde of yeares did
agrée with the yeares of the Greekes, and
of the Athenians, and alſo of the auncient
Romaines before Iulius Caeſars time: and
the auncient Romaines did beginne their
yeare from March, but the latter Romaines
from the winter Solſtice. Againe the Iewes did beginne
their yeare at the firſt new Moone that followed next after the vernall
Equinox: But the Athenians began their yeare at the new
Moone that followed next after the Sommer Solſtice: The moſt
people of Aſia began their yeare at the Autumnall Equinox: But
the moſt part of thoſe that dwel in theſe partes of the world, following
the cuſtome of the Romaine Church, doe beginne their
yeare at the Kalends of Ianuary, which in old time was not much
diſtant from the Winter Solſtice, which Solſtice at Chriſts birth
was the 25. of December, but nowe the ſame Solſtice is about
the twelfth day of December, ſo as the Winter Solſtice falleth
ſooner by thirtéene dayes then it did at that time. But we here in
England do begin the yeare at the 25. of March.
                  
                  
                     Of the yeare Lunar, and of the kinds thereof.
Chap. 44.
                     
                        HOw many kindes of Lunar yeares be there, and
which be they?
                     Of Lunar yeares there be two kindes, wherof
the one is ordinary called in Latine Annus communis,
and the other extraordinarie or exceſſiue,
called by a Gréeke name Emboliſmalis, The ordinary

or common yeare, is the ſpace of twelue Moones or changes,
paſſing by courſe within the yeare Solar, and is called common
becauſe it hath twelue Moones Lunar, euen as the Solar
yeare hath twelue monthes Solar, and conſiſteth of 354. dayes
and a little more, ſo as the Solar yeare excéedeth the Lunar yeare
by 11. dayes, for the yeare Solar conteyneth (as hath béene ſaide
before) 365. dayes, in which account the Fractions in both yeares
are omitted: And therefore if theſe two yeares ſhould begin together
at one ſelfe time, the Lunar yeare would end his courſe ſooner
by 11. dayes then the yeare Solar.
                     What is the extraordinarie Lunar yeare called Emboliſmalis?
                     It is the ſpace of thirtéene Moones or changes contayning 384
dayes, ſo as this yeare excéedeth the common Lunar yeare by 30.
dayes, and is more then the yeare Solar by 19. dayes.
                  
                  
                     Of the diuers kinds of monthes, and into what parts euery
Solar moneth is deuided according to the Romanes, that is,
into Kalends, Nones, and Ides.
Chap. 45.
                     
                        HOw many kindes of moneths be there,
and which be they?
                     There be thrée kinds, that is, the month
Solar, the moneth Lunar, and the moneth
Vſuall.
                     The moneth Solar is that ſpace of
time which the Sunne ſpendeth in paſſing
through any one of the 12. Signes.
                     The Lunar moneth is that ſpace of time which the Moone ſpendeth
whileſt ſhe departing from the Sun returneth to him againe.
                     The Vſuall moneth is that number of dayes which are ſet
downe in our common Kalenders, whereof ſome containe thirtie
dayes, ſome thirtie and one, and the moneth of Februarie hath
but 28. dayes. But if you will readily know which containe more
dayes and which leſſe, kéepe alwaies in memorie theſe old Engliſh
verſes here following.
                     
                        
                        Thirtie dayes hath Nouember,
                        Aprill, Iune, and September:
                        Februarie hath 28. alone,
                        And all the reſt haue thirtie and one.
                     
                     But when it is leape yeare, February hath 29. dayes, Againe
the Romaines deuided the Solar moneth into Kalends, Nones,
and Ides.
                     What be Kalends?
                     The Kalends are the firſt day of euery moneth from which the
Romaines counted the daies of the moneth procéeding backward,
As for example the firſt day of Aprill they named the Kalends of
Aprill, and the laſt day of March next before they called in Latin
pridie Kalendas Aprilis, that is the day before the Kalends of
Aprill, and the next day before that, the third Kalends of Aprill,
and the next day before that the fourth Kalends, and ſo foorth vntill
they come to the Ides.
                     Whereof ſprange this name Kalends?
                     Of the Gréeke verbe Calo, which is as much to ſay as call, for
the firſt day of euery moneth the cryer ſtanding in a high place
made foure cals or more to ſignifie thereby to the people howe
many dayes in that moneth the faires or markets called Nundinae
ſhould endure, and of Nundinae ſprange this word Nonae, that
is to ſay the dayes of the faires: For looke howe many Nones
there were in euery moneth, ſo many faires there were, during
which time the Romaines neuer worſhipped any God becauſe
there was no holy day during that time, and therefore Ouid ſaith
that Nonarum tutela Deo caret, that is to ſay, no God had tuition
of the Nones.
                     What are Ides?
                     They are thoſe dayes by which the Nones are deuided from
the reſt, and theſe Ides doe deuide in a manner the whole moneth
into two equall parts, for the firſt Ides moſt commonly falleth
eyther on the 13. 14. or 15. day of the moneth.
                     How many Ides, Nones, and Kalendes doe belong to euery
moneth?
                     Of Ides euery moneth hath eight, but of Nones March, May,
July, and October, haue ſixe, and all the reſt of the moneths haue

but foure Nones, but they differ moſt in the number of Kalends,
as you may perceiue by this Table following, which ſheweth
how many Kalendes, Ides, and Nones, doe belong to euery
moneth. Thus farre of the moneth Solar, now I will ſpeake
of the moneth Lunar.

                     Of the diuerſe kindes of moneths Lunar.
Chap. 46.
                     
                        HOw many kindes be there, and which
be they?
                     
                        Iohannes de Sacro Buſto ſayth that
there be foure kindes, that is the moneth
of paragration, the moneth of apparation,
the moneth medicinall, and the moneth
of conſecution.
                     The moneth of Paragration, is that
ſpace of time in which the Moone departing from any one point
of the Zodiaque, goeth by her proper moouing about the Zodiaque,
and returneth againe to the ſaid point from which ſhe firſt
departed which her reuolution is accompliſhed in 27. dayes, & 8.
houres. And this reuolution of ſome is called a yeare, and by this
account the Moone tarrieth in euery ſigne two dayes ſixe houres
and 29′·
                     The moneth of Apparation conſiſteth of 28. dayes, deuided
commenly by foure wéekes, euery wéeke contayning ſeuen daies,

for foure times ſeuen maketh 28. of which foure wéekes the firſt
is counted from her firſt apparance vnto the ende of the ſeuenth
day, and ſo foorth from wéeke to wéeke, ſo as the fourth wéeke endeth
at the 28. day, in which account the odde houres during the
Moones abode vnder the beames of the ſunne, when as ſhe is ſaid
to be combuſte, are not reckned.
                     The moneth Medicinall contayneth but 26. dayes, and a halfe
(as Galen ſayth) and is deuided alſo into foure wéekes, the diuiſion
being made by minutes.
                     The moneth of Conſecution is that ſpace of time wherein the
Moone being in coniunction with the ſunne, goeth about her Circle
and returneth againe to the ſame point, and not finding the
ſunne there becauſe he hath in that while paſſed through one whole
ſigne, ſhe haſteth after and in two dayes and foure houres 44′· and
a little more ſhe ouer taketh the ſunne, and is againe with him in
coniunction, of which her following and ouertaking, the ſunne
this moneth is called the moneth of Conſecution, which moneth
conſiſteth of 29. dayes and a halfe: during which time as the
ſunne by his owne proper courſe paſſeth through one ſigne or
there abouts, ſo the Moone by her courſe in the ſelfe ſame time
paſſeth through the whole Zodiaque and one ſigne more: And
note by the way that the ſunne in making his owne proper courſe
doth not enter into any ſigne in the very beginning of any moneth,
but rather about the midſt of euery moneth, or at the leaſt not
much ouer or vnder that day.
                  
                  
                     Of a weeke.
Chap. 47.
                     
                        NOw becauſe that euery moneth aſwell Solar
as Lunar is deuided into foure wéekes,
I will ſpeake ſomewhat of a wéeke.
                     What is a weeke?
                     A wéeke called moſt commonly in Latine
Septimana, which is as much to ſay
as ſeuen mornings, is the ſpace of ſeuen
dayes, whereof the firſt is called Sunday,
the ſecond Munday and ſo foorth to Saturday,

which names the Gentiles gaue to theſe ſeuen dayes in
honour of the ſeuen Planets whom they worſhipped as Gods, for
they called the firſt day the day of the ſunne, the ſecond the day of
the Moone, the third the day of Mars, the fourth the day of Mercury,
the fifth the day of Iupiter, the ſixth the day of Venus, the
ſeuenth the day of Saturne.
                     
                     Are there any more names belonging to this word weeke?
                     Yea, it is called alſo by a Gréeke name Hebdoma, that is to
ſay, contayning ſeuen dayes, and in the ſcripture it is called ſometime
Sabbatum, as when the Phariſie ſayd that he faſted Bis in
Sabbato that is to ſay, twice a wéeke, for the Iewes called Sunday
the firſt of the Sabaoth, and Munday the ſecond of the Sabaoth,
and ſo foorth in order vntill Saturday, which in déede was
their true Sabaoth or day of reſt.
                     Why is it not ſtill ſo counted amongſt vs Chriſtians, but
changed into Sunday?
                     For two cauſes, firſt to auoide the ſuperſtition of the Iewes,
and partly it was done in the honour of Chriſt, whoſe day of birth,
reſurrection, and ſending of the holy Ghoſt, was on the Sunday.
                  
                  
                     Of dayes and nights both naturall and artificiall.
Chap. 48.
                     
                        THe Aſtronomers doe deuide the dayes into two
kindes, whereof the one is called naturall, and
the other artificiall.
                     Which call you a naturall day?
                     A naturall day is one entire reuolution of the
Equinoctiall about the earth, whereunto muſt
be added ſuch portion of the Zodiaque, as the ſunne in the meane
while maketh by his proper motion, which is from Weſt to Eaſt.
                     In what time doth the Equinoctiall euery day make his
reuolution?
                     In 24. houres, which ſpace contayneth both day and night, according
to which reuolution and number of houres, the moſt part
of Horologies or clockes in the Eaſt countryes doe goe, and are
ſet to ſhew the houres of the day, but yet diuerſly, for ſome begin

their naturall day at the riſing of the ſunne, as the Bohemians,
and the Perſians, and ſome at the going downe of the ſunne, as
the Italians, the Athenians, the Iewes, the Egyptians, and the
Arabians, but the Aſtronomers reckon their naturall day from
noonetide to noonetide.
                     If the Equinoctiall doth make his reuolution iuſt in 24.
houres, then all naturall dayes are equall?
                     That is true if ye onely conſider the motion of the Equinoctiall,
but if you adde thereunto (as I ſaide before) that portion
which the ſunne in the meane while maketh by his owne proper
motion, you ſhall finde them to be vnequall, becauſe that portion
is ſometime more, ſometime leſſe, according to the ſwift or ſlowe
aſcention of the ſigne wherein the ſunne is.
                     What is the artificiall day?
                     It is the diſtance or ſpace that is betwixt the riſing of the Sun,
or going downe of the ſame.
                  
                  
                     The cauſes why the time betwixt the riſing & going downe
of the ſunne is vnequall.
Chap. 49.
                     
                        IT muſt néedes be vnequall, becauſe the abode
of the ſunne aboue the Horizon is variable,
aſwell for the vnequall aſcention
and deſcention of the ſignes, as alſo for the
obliquitie of the Horizon and Zodiaque:
and therefore the ſpaces of the artificiall
dayes muſt néedes be vnequall: for the ſun
aſwell in aſcending from the beginning of
Capricorne, to the beginning of Cancer, as alſo in deſcending
from the beginning of Cancer to the beginning of Capricorne,
deſcribeth on ech part 182. Circles or Paralels, the middlemoſt
whereof is the Equinoctiall. All which Paralels are deuided into
two parts by the Horizon, and the Arkes which are aboue the
Horizon are called the artificiall daies, and the Arkes beneath the
Horizon are called the artificiall nights, which Arkes to thoſe
that dwell vnder the Equinoctiall in a right Spheare are alwaies
equall, that is to ſay, the diurnall Arke is equall to the nocturnal,

becauſe their Horizon paſſeth through the Poles of the world, but
to thoſe that dwell in an oblique Spheare, aboue whoſe Horizon
the Pole is any thing eleuated, be it neuer ſo little, the Arkes or
Paralels are vnequall one to another, that is to ſay, eyther making
ſhort daies and long nights, or elſe long dayes and ſhort
nights, the Equinoctiall onely excepted, which aſwell in the oblique
Spheare as in the right, is alwayes deuided by the Horizon
into two equall partes, and ſo maketh the dayes and nights equall
in all places of the world. All which thinges you ſhall eaſily comprehend
by theſe two figures following, whereof that on the left
hande repreſenteth the right Spheare, and the other on the right
hande repreſenteth the oblique Spheare.
                     
                        
                           A figure of the right
Spheare.
                        
                        
                           A figure of the oblique
Spheare.
                        
                     
                     And here I thinke it not amiſſe to ſhewe you howe to finde out
the length of euery artificiall day and night throughout the yeare
in euery Latitude by the materiall Spheare, and likewiſe howe
to know at what part of the Horizon the ſunne riſeth and ſetteth
euery day, and alſo how to finde out his Meridian Altitude, wherby
you ſhall know how nigh or how farre from your Zenith hée
is euery day.
                  
                  
                     
                     How to find out by the materiall Spheare or Globe, and by
helpe of the aſcentionall difference before defined, the increaſe
and decreaſe of euery day throughout the yeare in euery
ſeuerall Latitude, and at what houre the ſunne riſeth and
ſetteth.
Chap. 50.
                     
                        FIrſt hauing ſet the Spheare at your Latitude,
learne to knowe by ſome Table or inſtrument in
what ſigne and degrée thereof the ſunne is at ſuch
day of the moneth and yeare as you ſéeke, and bring
that degrée cloſe to the mooueable meridian, & there
marke in what point or degrée the ſaid Meridian cutteth the Equinoctiall,
& what number it hath, for ſo ſhall you haue the right
aſcention of the degree of the ſunne for that day. That done, bring
the ſaid degrée of the ſunne to the Eaſt part of the Horizon, ſo as
it may méete euen with the vpper edge thereof, and ſtaying it
there, marke what degrée of the Equinoctiall at that inſtant doth
alſo touch the Horizon, and what number it hath, and that is the
oblique aſcention of the foreſaid degrée of the ſunne, then ſubtract
the leſſer number out of the greater, and that which remaineth
ſhall be the aſcentionall difference, as for example in this preſent
yeare 1590. the xi. day of Aprill the ſunne is in the firſt degrée of
Taurus, whoſe right aſcention in the Latitude 52. by doing as
before is taught, you ſhall finde to be 27. degrées and 54′· and the
oblique aſcention thereof to be 12. degrées 48′· and the aſcentionall
difference to be 15. degrées 6′· which difference you muſt firſt
double, and then conuert the ſame into houres and minutes by allowing
15. degrées to an houre, and 4′· to a degrée, that done, adde
thoſe houres & minutes to the Equinoctiall day, which is alwaies
12. houres, & the ſumme of that addition will ſhew you the length
of the day, when the ſunne is in the firſt point of Taurus, which is
14. houres & 12′· and that is the true length of that day. But you
haue to note by ye way that as you haue to adde the ſum of ye houres
to ye Equinoctial day, the ſunne being in any of the 6. Northerne
ſignes, ſo muſt you ſubtract the ſaid houres from the Equinoctiall
day, the ſunne being in any of the ſixe Northerne ſignes, As
for example, ſuppoſe the ſunne to be in the firſt point of Scorpio,
                        
the right aſcention whereof is 207. degrées 54′· and the oblique
aſcention is 223. degrées, here by taking the leſſer out of the greater
you ſhall finde the aſcentionall difference to be 15. degrées 6′·
which being doubled, maketh 30. degrées and 12′· that is two
houres and 12′· which if you ſubtract from 12. there will remain
9. houres 48′· which is the length of the artificiall day, when the
ſunne is in the firſt degrée of Scorpio, the one halfe whereof is
called the ſemi-diurnall Arke of that artificiall day, which is 4.
houres 54. minutes, whereby you may gather that the ſunne at
that time riſeth foure minutes after ſeuen of the clocke, and ſetteth
againe foure minutes before fiue: ſo likewiſe in the former
example where the aſcentionall difference was 15. degrées ſixe
minutes, which being doubled made 30. degrées and 12′· that was
two houres and 12′· which being added to 12. houres made 14.
houres and 12′· the halfe whereof is ſeuen houres and ſixe
minutes, whereby you may gather that the ſunne did then riſe 6′·
before 5. of the clocke in the morning, and did ſet 6′· after 7. of the
clocke in the Euening, and ſo you haue both the forenoone & afternoone
of the day, which two times are beſt to be reckoned alwayes
from 12. a clocke at noone, that is to ſay, the forenoone houres and
minutes, from twelue backward, and the after moone houres and
minutes from twelue forward, & by ſubtracting the whole length
of the artificiall day from 24. houres, you ſhall haue the length of
the artificiall night, as in the former example take 14. houres and
12′· from 24. houres, and there will remaine for the length of the
artificiall night 9. houres and 48′·
                  
                  
                     How to know by the materiall Spheare or Globe, in what
part of the Horizon the ſunne riſeth and ſetteth euery day,
and thereby the length of the day. Alſo how to know the Meridian
altitude of the ſunne euery day throughout the yeare,
& being at his Meridian altitude, to know how farre diſtant
he is from the Zenith euery day.
Chap. 51.
                     
                        FIrſt then hauing ſet the Spheare or Globe at your Latitude,
which ſuppoſe to be 52. degr. bring the degrée
of the ſun for that day, to the Eaſt part of the Horizon,
ſo as it may méete iuſt with the vpper edge therof, and

there ſet a little péece of waxe vpon the Horizon, that doue turne
the ſaid degrée of the ſunne to the Weſt part of the Horizon vntill
it méete againe with the vpper edge of the Horizon, and there ſet
another péece of waxe vpon the Horizon, and thoſe two markes
will ſhewe you in what part of the Horizon the ſunne riſeth and
ſetteth: As for example, I would know this preſent yeare 1594.
in what part of the Horizon the ſunne doth riſe and ſet the twelfth
of Iune, here finding by the Ephemerides that the ſun is entred
16′· into Cancer at that day, I bring that point of the Ecliptique
to the Eaſt part of the Horizon, ſo as it may méete iuſt with the
vpper edge thereof, and there I ſet a little péece of waxe vpon the
Horizon: that done I turne the ſaid point of the Ecliptique to the
Weſt part of the Horizon, and whereas that point toucheth the
vpper edge of the ſaid Horizon, I ſet there another péece of waxe
vpon the Horizon, then counting the degrées vppon the Horizon
from the true Eaſt point thereof to the firſt péece of waxe Northward,
I finde the number of the degrées to be 40. degrées or therabouts,
which containeth thrée points and a halfe and ſomewhat
more, of the Mariners Compaſſe, whereby I gather that the
ſunne riſeth at that time very néere to the Northeaſt, and ſetteth
néere to the Northweſt, becauſe the number of the degrées in both
parts of the Horizon are like.
                     How ſhall I know how many points of the Mariners compaſſe
are contained in any number of degrees, exceding the
number of degrees and minutes contained in one point?
                     The Mariners Compaſſe containeth 32. points, and euery
point containeth 11. degrées and ¼. of a degrée which is 15. minutes,
wherefore whenſoeuer you would know how many points
of the Compaſſe are contained in any number of degrées be it
great or ſmall, multiply that number by foure, and deuide the
product thereof by 45. and the quotient will ſhewe the number of
the points, and if there be any remainder, then becauſe the Mariner
doth make euery point to haue foure quarters, multiply that
remainder by foure, and deuide the product by 45. which is the
common diuiſor, and the quotient will ſhew the quarters, or if the
remainder be but ſmall, then multiply that remainder by eight,
which are halfe quarters, and deuide the product thereof by 45.
as before, and the quotient will ſhew the halfe quarters of a point:

As in the former example in multiplying 40. degr. by 4. the product
is 160. which if you deuide by 45. you ſhall finde in the quotient
3. whole points, & the remainder to be 25. which being multiplyed
by 4. the product will be 100. which if you deuide by 45.
you ſhall find in the quotient 2. quarters of a point, & the remainder
to be 10/45. of a quarter, that is to ſay, if you can deuide one quarter
into 45. parts, then you muſt take 10. of thoſe parts, and adde
them to the former ſumme, which being of ſmal importance is not
to be regarded. But now to returne to my firſt matter, I ſay that
by counting the degrées vppon the Horizon, from the firſt péece of
waxe to the South point of the Horizon, I find the number of degrées
to be 130. degr. & by allowing 15. degr. to an houre, I finde
the halfe day to containe 8. houres 10′· which being doubled maketh
16. houres 20′· Then to know the Meridian altitude of the
ſunne, you muſt bring the degrée of the ſunne right vnder the Meridian,
and the number of the degrées contained in the Meridian
betwixt the South point of the Horizon, and the ſaid degrée of the
ſunne will ſhewe the Meridian Altitude of the ſunne, ſo ſhall you
find the Meridian Altitude of the ſunne, being in the firſt point of
Cancer to be 61. degrées, which once had, the diſtance from the
Zenith is ſoone knowne: for if you ſubtract 61. degrées from 90.
you ſhall find the diſtance of the ſunne from the Zenith to be 29.

Chap. 52.
                     
                        AS of daies and nights there be 2. kinds, that is
naturall and artificiall before defined, ſo likewiſe
are there 2. ſorts of houres, that is equal,
and vnequall: An equall houre is the 24. part
of a naturall day, and euery ſuch houre containeth
15. degrées of the Equinoctiall, for 15.
times 24. maketh 360. degrées, which is the

whole circuit or Longitude of the Equinoctiall, which according
to the diurnall moouing of the firſt mooueable maketh his reuolution
in 24. houres as hath béene ſaid before, and therefore this equall
houre is alſo called an Equinoctiall or naturall houre. The
vnequall houre is the twelfth part of an artificiall day or artificiall
night, which daies and nights as they be ſometimes long and
ſometimes ſhort, according to the time of the yeare, ſo are the
houres of the ſame. For both day and night, be it neuer ſo ſhort,
is deuided by the Aſtronomers into twelue houres, ſo as when
here in ſome part of England towards the North, the artificiall
day is 17. houres long, and the night but ſeuen houres, if you deuide
either of theſe into twelue parts, you ſhal find that euery ſuch
twelfth part of the day ſhall containe more then the naturall or
Equinoctiall houre by 25′· and the twelfth part of the ſaid artificiall
night to containe but the one halfe of an equall houre and fiue
minutes, which notwithſtanding being both added together, will
make in all 24, equall houres, which is a naturall day, ſo as by
this meanes you may eaſily perceiue that a naturall day comprehendeth
both kindes of houres, aſwell vnequall as equall. Note
alſo that the vnequall houres are called ſometime artificiall and
ſometime temporall houres, artificiall, becauſe they are dayly
changed by the varietie of the artificiall dayes and nights, and
are neuer equall but twice in the yeare, when the ſunne is in eyther
of the Equinoxes: and they are called temporall, becauſe the
auncient obſeruers of time were woont to make diuerſe clockes
and Horologies to ſhewe theſe vnequall and temporall houres,
of which clockes there are yet ſome to be ſéene at this day. Moreouer
the houres both equall and vnequall are deuided not onely
into quarters of houres, but alſo intominutes, for euery houre be
it long or ſhort, is deuided into 60. minutes, and euery minute
into 60. ſecondes, and euery ſeconde into 60. thirdes, and ſo
forth to fourths, fifts, ſixthes, and into as many as you will, ſo
as you make your diuiſion alwayes by 60. But you haue to
note, that as the Aſtronomers doe deuide the artificiall day and
artificiall night into houres both equall and vnequal, ſo the Iewes
doe deuide ech of them into foure quarters, in manner and forme
following.
                  
                  
                     
                     How and in what manner the Iewes doe deuide the artificiall
day and night, ech of them into foure quarters.
Chap. 53.
                     
                        THey deuide the artificiall day into foure quarters
by allowing to euery quarter 3. houres, accounting
the firſt houre of the firſt quarter at the riſing
of the ſunne, and the third houre of the ſaid
quarter they called the third houre, and the third
houre of the ſecond quarter they called the ſixth
houre, which was midday or noonetide, againe they called the third
houre of the third quarter, the ninth houre, and they called the ſecond
houre of the fourth quarter the eleuenth houre, and th
                           ••
                         called
the laſt houre which was the twelfth houre of the day, euentide
becauſe then the ſunne went downe.
                     Whereto ſerueth the knowledge hereof?
                     By knowing this account you may the better vnderſtande certaine
places of the Scripture making mention of thinges done
at certaine houres not like vnto our common houres, For whereas
it is ſaid in the Goſpell of Saint Iohn, that Chriſt healed the
Rulers ſonne that was ſicke of an Ague in Capernaum, and that
the Ague left him the ſeuenth houre, is as much to ſay, as the
Ague left him at one of the clocke in the afternoone: Againe where
as mention is made in the Goſpell of S. Matthew, of the labourers
that came to worke in the Vineyard at the eleuenth houre is
to be vnderſtood at fiue of the clocke in the afternoone, or rather
one houre before the ſunne ſet, for you muſt thinke that the ſunne
riſeth not nor yet goeth downe in Iewrie alwaies at ſixe of the
clocke, for then they ſhould haue no artificiall day nor night, but
all dayes and nights ſhould be a like. Alſo they deuided the artificiall
night into foure quarters, otherwiſe called by them the foure
watches of the night, for the firſt thrée houres was the firſt watch,
during which time all the Souldiers both young and old of anie
fortified Towne were wont to watch, the ſecond thrée houres they
called the ſecond watch, which was about the dead of the night,
at which time the young Souldiers onely watched, and the third

quarter of the night containing alſo thrée houres, and was called
the third watch the Souldiers of middle age did watch, and the
laſt thrée houres called the 4. watch which was about the breake
of day, the old Souldiers onely watched. But nowe becauſe the
auncient Aſtronomers doe appoint the gouernment of the vnequal
houres to the ſeuen Planets, it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſhewe you
here what Planet raigneth euery houre both day and night.
                  
                  
                     How to knowe what Planet raigneth in euery houre of the
day or night artificiall, as well by helpe of a table, as by a rule
contained in one verſe.

                        The vſe of the Table.
                        Now the vſe of the ſaide Table is thus: whenſoeuer you would
knowe in what houre of the day or night any Planet raigneth, you
muſt firſt ſéeke out the houre of the day or night, and if it be of
the day, then you ſhall finde it in the firſt rowe of the front, if of the
night, in the ſecond rowe of the front, as hath béene ſaide before:
and from that houre deſcende with your finger to the common
Angle ſtanding right againſt the day which you ſéeke, and
that will ſhewe you what Planet then raigneth. As for example,
if you would know on Wedneſday at 8. of the clocke of the day
what Planet raigneth, then hauing found the number of 8. in the
front, written in Arithmeticall figure, come ſtraight downe from
thence with your finger to the common Angle ſtanding right againſt
Wedneſday, and you ſhall finde that Mercurie raigneth.
And if you would knowe what Planet raigneth the ſame day at
the eight houre of the night, then deſcende from the houre of the
night downe to the common Angle, and you ſhall finde that the
ſunne raigneth, and ſo foorth of all the reſt.
                        The rule contained in one verſe, and the vſe thereof.
                        The rule in verſe is thus:
                        Sol, Ve, Mer, Luna, Saturnus, Iupiter, & Mars.
                        Theſe vii. wordes (the coniunction & being left out) doe ſignifie
the ſeuen Planets: For Sol is the Sunne, Ve ſtandeth for
Venus, Mer for Mercurius, Luna is the Moone, and the other
thrée Planets following, as Saturnus, Iupiter, and Mars, doe
make vp the number of ſeuen, which muſt alwayes followe one
another, in ſuch order as they are here ſet downe in the foreſaide
verſe, and to haue the true vſe of this rule, you muſt firſt apply
euery Planet to his owne proper day, as Sol to Sunday, Luna to
Munday, Mars to Tueſday, Mercurius to Wedneſday, Iupiter
to Thurſday, Venus to Friday, and Saturnus to Saturday: for
euery one of theſe Planets gouerneth the firſt houre of his owne
proper day, and the Planet placed next to him in the verſe, gouerneth
the ſecond houre of the ſame day, and ſo forth orderly, as for
example, if you would knowe what Planet ſhall raigne on Sunday
at the third houre of the day, you muſt firſt ſay that Sol doth

raigne the firſt houre becauſe that is his day, and Venus raigneth
the ſecond houre, and Mercurie the third houre according to your
rule, & ſo by kéeping the order of the verſe, you ſhall eaſily appoint
to euery houre both of the day and of the night artificiall his owne
gouernour: For though both day and night be deuided ech of
them into 12. houres, making in all 24. houres, and that there
be but ſeuen Planets, yet by appointing euery Planet to his owne
proper day as gouernour of the firſt houre of the ſame day, and
by obſeruing the order of the verſe in repeating the ſaid Planets,
you ſhall not faile to giue to euery houre his proper Planet. Thus
hauing ſufficiently ſpoken of the celeſtiall part, I will now procéede
to the Elementall part of the worlde, contained in the ſecond
Booke of this Treatiſe.

Chap. 1.
                     
                        WHat doth the Elementall part containe?
                     I told you before that as the celeſtiall
part doth containe the eleuen heauens before
deſcribed, ſo the Elementall part containeth
ye 4. Elements, that is to ſay, fire,
Aire, Water, & Earth, which are of themſelues
pure ſubſtances, and the firſt & next
beginnings whereof all mixt bodies are
compound, and therefore not to be ſéene with our outward eyes:
for as we our ſelues are bodies compound, ſo with our outwarde
ſenſes we can diſcerne nothing but that which is compound: and
therefore the fire, aire, water or earth which we daily féele or ſée,
are not the Elements thēſelues, but things compounded of them.
The natures and properties of which Elements I mind here but
briefely to touch, ſith the exact handling thereof belongeth rather
to naturall Philoſophers & to Phyſitians, then to Geographers,
who haue to deale only with ye ſituations of the earth with Zones,
Paralels, Climes, Longitudes, Latitudes, diſtances & ſuch like
thinges belonging to the meaſure and deſcription of this earth
here which we inhabite.
                     Define theſe Elements.
                  
                  
                     Of the Fire and of his nature and motion.
Chap. 2.
                     
                        THe Fire is an Element moſt hoat and dry, pure, ſubtill,
and ſo cleare as it doth not hinder our ſight looking
through the ſame towards the ſtars, and is placed
next to the Spheare of the Moone, vnder the which
it is turned about like a celeſtiall Spheare.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the Aire and into how many Regions it is deuided.
Chap. 3.
                     
                        NExt to the Fire is the Aire whichis an Element
hotte and moyſt, & alſo moſt fluxible, pure & cleare,
notwithſtāding it is farre thicker & groſſer as ſome
ſay, towards the Poles thē elſwhere, by reaſon that
thoſe parts are fartheſt from the ſun: And this Element
is deuided of the naturall Philoſophers into thrée Regions,
that is to ſay, the higheſt Region, the Middle Region, and the
loweſt Region, which higheſt Region being turned about by the
fire, is thereby made the hotter, wherein all fierie impreſſions are
bredde, as lightnings, fire drakes, blazing ſtarres and ſuch like.
                     The middle Region is extreame cold by contra oppoſition by
reaſon that it is placed in the midſt betwixt two hotte Regions,
and therefore in this Region are bred all cold watry impreſſions,
as froſt, ſnow, ice, haile, and ſuch like.
                     The loweſt Region is hotte by the reflexe of the ſunne, whoſe
beames firſt ſtriking the earth, doe rebound backe againe to that
Region, wherein are bred cloudes, dewes, raynes, and ſuch like
moderate watry impreſſions, which thrée Regions of the aire with
the reſt of the Elements this figure doth plainely ſhew.
                     
                        
                           
                              The highest region of ye ayer
                              Midle region
                              Loest region

                     Of the Water, and whether it be round or not.
Chap. 4.
                     
                        NExt to the Aire, is the Water which is cold, moiſt,
and fluxible, and being lighter then the Earth
would of his owne nature ſurmount and couer
the whole earth, had not God in the creation of
the world deuided waters from waters (as the
Booke of Geneſ. ſaith) and gathered together
thoſe waters that are vnder the firmament into certaine concauities
of the earth, leauing other partes of the earth dry, and diſcouered,
that man and beaſt might inhabite the ſame, & haue foode
neceſſarie for their behoofe, ſo as now both water and earth doth
make one entire and Sphericall bodie, which is enuironed with
the Aire.
                     Is not the water a round bodie of it ſelfe without the
earth?
                     Many late writers doe deny the whole bodie to be round, affirming
onely the Conuere ſuperficies or vpper face of the water
to be round, for (ſay they) the earth being not altogether round
the Concaue ſuperficies of the water cannot be round, notwithſtanding
the moſt part of the auncient writers do affirme the whol
bodie of the water to be round, ſaying that the water hath the like
ſhape in his whole, that it hath in his parts: For the parts which
are drops, are round, ergo the whole is round. Againe they proue
the water of the ſea to be round by demonſtration thus, ſuppoſe a
ſhip to depart from the ſhore whereon ſome marke is ſet, which
you may ſée with a right leauelled line ſtanding at the ſtearne of
the ſaid ſhippe, but ſaying further from the ſhore, you cannot
ſée the marke any more ſtanding vpon the ſterne, but ſhall be faine
to goe vp to the toppe of the maſt to ſée it, by reaſon that the water
being a round bodie riſeth and ſwelleth in the midſt, and ſo letteth
your ſight as this figure plainely ſheweth.
                     
                        
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     Of the Earth and whether it be all round or not.
Chap. 5.
                     
                        NExt to the Water is the Element of the
Earth, which of his nature is thicke, heauie,
cold, dry, and not fluxible as is the water
and aire, but is firme and apt to kéepe
his place, and though ſome deny the earth
to bee, round becauſe of the high mountaines,
and déepe dales and vallyes therin,
which are nothing in compariſon of the
whole earth to alter that roundnes which
it hath by nature, yet Ariſtotle affirmeth in his ſecond booke de
coelo & mundo, the fourtéenth Chapter, that the earth of her own
nature is round, proouing the ſame as well for that the Moone
when ſhe is eclipſed in part, could not haue ſuch horned ſhape as
this figure repreſenteth.
                     
                     Vnleſſe the earth were alſo round
by the interpoſition whereof ſhee is
eclipſed, either totally or in part as
hath béen ſaid before, Againe he prooueth
the roundnes of the earth by the
altering of the Horizon, for in going
from North to South, our Horizon
altereth in ſuch ſort as wee diſcouer
thoſe ſtarres which we could not ſée
before, but were cleane hidden from

our ſight, ſome alſo deny that the earth is in the middeſt of the
world, and ſome affirme that it is mooueable, as alſo Copernicus
by way of ſuppoſition, and not for that he thought ſo in déede:
who affirmeth that the earth turneth about, and that the ſunne
ſtandeth ſtill in the midſt of the heauens, by helpe of which falſe
ſuppoſition he hath made truer demonſtrations of the motions &
reuolutions of the celeſtiall Spheares, then euer were made before,
as plainely appeareth by his booke de Reuolutionibus dedicated
to Paulus Tertius the Pope, in the yeare of our Lord
1536. But Ptolomie, Ariſtotle, and all other olde writers affirme
the earth to be in the middeſt, and to remaine vnmooueable
and to be in the very Center of the world, proouing the ſame
with many moſt ſtrong reaſons not néede full here to be rehearſed,
becauſe I thinke fewe or none do doubt thereof, and ſpecially the
holy Scripture affirming the foundations of the earth to be layd
ſo ſure,Pſal. 104. that in neuer ſhould mooue at any time: Againe you ſhall
finde in the ſelfe ſame Pſalme theſe words, Hee appointed the
Moone for certaine ſeaſons, and the Sunne knoweth his going
downe, whereby it appeareth that the Sunne mooueth and not the
earth. But leauing this matter, we will now ſpeake of the compaſſe
of the earth, and of the Longitude and Latitude thereof.
                  
                  
                     Of the compaſſe of the earth, and of the diuerſitie of meaſures
according to diuerſe countryes.
Chap. 6.
                     
                        CAn the whole earth be meaſured?
                     Yea very well, for ſith the earth and the
water (as hath béene ſaid before) doe make
together, one whole Sphericall or round
bodie, and that euery great Circle as well
thereof as of the heauens, containeth 360.
degrées, there is no more then to be done,
but to allow for euery ſuch degrée 60. Italian
miles, which differ not much from our Engliſh miles, ſo as
in multiplying 360. degrées by 60. you ſhall finde the whole
compaſſe of the earth to be 2160. miles, of which compaſſe if
you would knowe the true Diameter, then hauing multiplyed

the ſaid compaſſe or circuit of 21600. miles by ſeuen, deuide the
product thereof by 22. and the quotient together with the remainder,
will ſhew the true Diameter which is 6872. miles, fiue furlongs,
and 9/11 of a furlong, and the halfe of that is the ſemi-Diameter
of the earth, which is 3436. miles, and 4/11 of a mile: and
as the Italians and we Engliſh men doe meaſure great diſtances
on the earth by miles, ſo the French, the Spaniſh, and the
high Almaines, doe meaſure ſuch diſtances by leagues both by
lande and ſea, and euery one differeth from other: for the French
league containeth two of our miles, the Spaniſh league thrée, and
the common league of Germany foure, and the great league of
Germanie containeth fiue of our miles, yea in ſome places of
Germany, as in Sueuia, the leagues are ſo long as a man ſhall
ſkant ride thrée of them in a whole day. Againe the Grecians
did meaſure the diſtances of the earth by furlongs, the Egyptians
by ſignes, and the Perſians by paraſanges, all which
meaſures doe greatly differ euen in the ſmalleſt partes, from
whence all meaſures doe take their firſt originall: for as well
amongeſt the auntient men, as amongeſt them of latter dayes,
foure barley kernels couched cloſe together ſide by ſide, and not
end long, are ſaide to make a finger breadth, and thrée finger
breadthes an inch, and foure finger breadthes a palme or
hand breadth, and thrée palmes or nine inches a ſpan, and foure
palmes or hand breadthes a foote, and two foote and a halfe to
make a common pace, and fiue foote to make a Geometrical pace,
of which kinde of paces, 125. do make a furlong, and eight furlongs
doe make an Italian mile, and foure ſuch miles doe make
a common Germaine league, as hath béene ſaide before, but by
reaſon that the barley kernels be not in all Countryes of like bigneſſe,
neither finger breadthes, inches, hand-breadthes, féete, nor
any of the other meaſures are founde any where to be equall:
for the French foote of Paris is longer then ours by an inch,
and the Italian foote is longer by two inches and more, and yet
their miles are ſomewhat ſhorter then ours: and the Germaine
foote (according to Stophlerus.) is leſſe then ours by two inches
and a halfe. But to ſhew the diuerſitie of meaſures would require
a long diſcourſe more intricable then profitable, and therefore I
leane to talke any further thereof, wiſhing you when we ſpeake of

miles, furlongs, paces, or féete, to conſider the meaſure thereof
according to the inch or foote of our Engliſh ſtandard.
                  
                  
                     Of the Longitude and Latitude of the earth.
Chap. 7.
                     
                        WHat meane you by the Longitude and Latitude
of the earth?
                     Longitude is as much to ſay as length,
and Latitude ſignifieth breadth, for ſith the
earth is a bodie, it muſt néedes haue both
length, breadth, and depth.
                     How define you ſuch Longitude and Latitude,
and how is it to be counted?
                     The Longitude of the earth in generall is that ſpace or vpper
face of the earth which extendeth from Weſt to Eaſt, and againe
frō Eaſt to Weſt: And the Latitude in generall is that ſpace which
extendeth North & South euen from the one pole to thother. Now
to know how ſuch Longitude and Latitude is to be accounted, you
muſt firſt vnderſtand that ye Equinoctiall Circle girding the earth
in the very midſt, is deuided into 360. degrées by reaſon of certaine
Meridians which paſſing through the Poles of the world,
doe cut ech halfe of the Equinoctiall in eightéene pointes, which
being doubled doe make 36. ſpaces, euery ſpace containing tenne
degrées: and ſome doe deuide the Equinoctiall with 36. Meridiaans,
cutting ech halfe thereof in 36. points, which being doubled
doe make 72. ſpaces, euery ſpace containing 5. degrées, which
commeth all to one reckoning, for fiue times 72. doe make 360.
as well as tenne times 36. of which Meridians, be there neuer ſo
fewe or many (for you may if you will make halfe as many Meridians
as there be degrées in the Equinoctiall which amounteth
to a 180.) yet according to Ptolomie, that Meridian is ſaide
to be firſt and furtheſt Weſtwarde which paſſeth through the Ilands
called Inſulae fortunatae, for the Weſt Indies were not
knowne nor diſcouered in his dayes, nor yet long time after,
ſince the diſcouerie whereof, the late Coſmographers of
theſe dayes doe make the firſt Meridian to paſſe through the
Ilandes called Azores, which Ilandes, as appeareth by their

Cardes are ſituated more Weſtwarde from the foreſaid Inſulae
fortunatae, by fiue degrées, the reaſon that mooueth them ſo to do,
is becauſe the Mariners Compaſſe as they ſay, wil neuer encline
to the true North pole, but when they ſayle either by the Ile S.
Mary or S. Michaell, affirming that in euery other place the
Compaſſe doth varie from the true North, eyther by Northe aſting
or Northweſting. And by thus altering the auncient placing
of the firſt Meridian, they muſt likewiſe alter all the Longitudes
ſet downe heretofore by Ptolomie or any other auncient
writer, notwithſtanding the matter is eaſilie holpen, for by adding
to euery Longitude Eaſtward fiue degrées, or by ſubtracting
fiue degrées from euery Longitude Weſtward, you ſhall not
greatly vary from thoſe auncient Longitudes that be truely ſet
downe. But to returne againe to my firſt purpoſe, I ſay tha
                           •
                        
whereſoeuer this firſt Meridian cutteth the Equinoctiall, there
beginneth the firſt degrée of Longitude, which procéedeth Eaſtward
vntill you come to 180. degrées, which being the one halfe
of the earth is as farre as you can goe Eaſtwarde, for then the
earth being round, you muſt néedes turne againe Weſtward vntill
you come to the 360. degrée, which is the laſt degrée of Longitude,
and endeth where the firſt degrée beginneth: and therefore
the Coſmographers meaſuring alwaies the Longitude by the degrées
of the Equinoctiall, do define Longitude to be that portion
of the Equinoctiall Circle, which is contained betwixt the firſt
Meridian and the Meridian of any place ſuppoſed, but the diſtance
betwixt any two ſuppoſed Meridians (neither of them being
the firſt Meridian) is not called of them Longitude, but the
difference of Longitude: For ſuppoſe the diſtance of the one Meridian
to be twentie degrées diſtant from the firſt Meridian, and
the other but tenne, theſe Longitudes you ſée are not like but doe
differ, and therfore the diſtance betwixt any ſuch two places may
be very well called the difference of Longitude, and not Longitude
it ſelfe, which hath alwaies regard to the firſt Meridian
and to none other.
                     Define once againe what Latitude is?
                     Latitude is none other thing but the diſtance of any place from
the Equinoctiall either towards the North pole or towards the
South pole, ſo as there be two kinds of Latitudes, the one Northerne,

and the other Southerne: And ſuch Latitude is meaſured
vpon the Meridian which paſſeth through any place ſuppoſed.
For euery Meridian is alſo deuided into 360. degrées, and
by reaſon that the Equinoctiall girdeth all ſuch Meridians in the
very midſt, it deuideth them all into foure equall quarters euery
quarter contayning 90. degrées, which is the greateſt Latitude
that any place can haue, as you may ſée in this figure following,
whereof the firſt Meridian on the left hand is put to ſignifie according
to Ptolomie, that which paſſeth through the Fortunate
Ilandes, or by the Azores according to the moderne Coſmographers
(if you will haue it ſo) contayning the degrées of the
Latitude both Northward and Southward, and through the
midſt of all the Meridians paſſeth the Equinoctiall contayning
the degrées of the Longitude.
                     
                        The figure of the longitude and latitude
of the world.
                     
                     
                        
What be the other manifold Circles in this figure deuiding
the Meridians on ech ſide of the Equinoctiall, as well towards
the North pole, as towards the South pole.
                     They be called Parallels, whereof we ſhall ſpeake in the next
Chapter, in the meane time marke well this figure that thereby
you may the better conceiue what is the Longitude and Latitude
of the earth.
                     Vnderſtanding now the Longitude & Latitude of the whole
earth, I am deſirous to know how the Longitude and Latitude

                     How to know the Latitude of any place, aſwell in the day
as in the night.
Chap. 8.
                     
                        BEcauſe the Latitude of any place is more eaſie
to be found (as moſt men thinke) then the Longitude,
I will firſt treat of Latitude. The Latitude
thē is to be knowne by the Aſtrolabe, Quadrant,
Croſſeſtaffe, and by ſuch like Mathematicall
inſtruments, & that diuerſe wayes whereof
the moſt eaſie is thus: firſt with your Aſtrolabe
or Quadrant, or any ſuch like inſtrument, take the height of
the ſunne right at noone, when the ſunne is in the firſt point of Aries
or of Libra, which height if you ſubtract from 90. that which
remaineth is the true Latitude of that place. But if you would
knowe the Latitude at any other day or time of the yeare, then
after that you haue taken the height of the ſunne at noone, otherwiſe
called the Meridian altitude, you muſt firſt learne to knowe
the true degrée of the ſunnes declination by the Table of the declinations
before ſet downe, together with the vſe thereof in the 13.
Chap. of the firſt booke, or by ſome other Table more lately calculated,
and if ſuch declination be Northernly, then you muſt ſubtract
that from the foreſaid Altitude or height: but if the declination be
Southernly, thē you muſt adde the ſame vnto the foreſaid height,
and by ſuch ſubtraction or addition, you ſhall haue the height of
the Equinoctial aboue your Horizon, which being ſubtracted from
90. that which remaineth is the true Latitude of that place: and

to be ſure in taking the Meridian altitude, it ſhall be néedefull to
take it diuerſe times one after another, with ſome little pawſe betwixt,
to ſée whether it increaſeth or decreaſeth, for if it doth increaſe,
then it is not yet full noone, but if it decreaſeth then it is
paſt noone. This laſt way of finding out the Latitude, is, and
hath béene moſt commonly taught, as well by the auncient,
as moderne writers, as a moſt ſure and readie way of finding the
Latitude of any place.
                     What if the ſunne doe not ſhine at noone, nor perhaps all
that day?
                     Then you muſt tarrie vntill night that ſome ſtarre appeare,
which you perfectly knowe, and ſuch a one as both riſeth and
ſetteth. And hauing taken the Meridian altitude of that ſtarre
with your Aſtrolabe or Quadrant, you muſt learne what declination
he hath, and whether it be Northerne or Southerne. For
if the ſtarre hath North declination, then you muſt ſubtract his
declination from his Meridian altitude, and the remainder ſhall
be the Altitude of the Equinoctiall, which being taken out of
nintie, ſhall be the Latitude of the place, or eleuation of the
pole: but if the declination of the ſtarre be Southernly, then you
muſt adde his declination to his Meridian altitude, and that
ſumme ſhall be the Altitude of the Equinoctiall, which being
taken out of 90. the remainder ſhall be the eleuation of the Pole.
As for example, ſuppoſing that you knowe the ſtarre called
Arcturus, or Bubulcus, and that you finde his Meridian altitude
by your Aſtrolabe or Quadrant to be 59. degrées 30. minutes
and alſo that you haue learned by ſome Table, that his declination
to the Northwarde is 21. degrées 30. minutes: here by taking
his ſaide declination becauſe it is Northernly, out of his
Meridian altitude, you finde the remainder to be 38. degrées
which is the Altitude of the Equinoctiall, which béeing taken
from 90. the remainder wilbe 52. degrées, which is the Latitude
of the place whereas you made your obſeruation, and this is a
farre more readie waye then to waite all night to take the Meridian
altitude, and alſo the depreſſion of ſuch a ſtarre as neuer
ſetteth, which is ſéeledome done in one ſelfe night. And
therefore I would wiſhe all Mariners to acquaint themſelues
with manie ſtarres that doe both riſe and ſet, and ſo ſhall they

be ſure to finde one ſuch ſtarre or other, to be at his Meridian
altitude at any houre of the night that they deſire, if the ſtarres
doe ſhewe.
                  
                  
                     How to know the true Longitude of any place.
Chap. 9.
                     
                        THough the Longitude may be found out by diuers
waies not eaſie for euery mans capacitie,
yet becauſe Gemma Friſius thinketh none ſo
ſure as to knowe the ſame by the eclipſe of the
Moone, (which alſo as he ſaith) may ſometime
faile by reaſon of the diuerſitie of aſpects and
Latitude of the Moone, and for that cauſe hath inuented a more
readie way to finde out at all times the Longitude of any place,
I minde here therefore briefely to ſhewe you firſt the order of
finding out the Longitude by the Eclipſe of the Moone, and
then how to finde out the ſame by that readie way which he hath
inuented: the order then to knowe it by the Eclipſe of the Moone
is thus: Firſt you muſt learne by ſome Ephemerides at what
houre the Eclipſe ſhall be in ſome place, where you knowe alreadie
by ſome Table the Longitude, that done, you your ſelfe or
ſome other for you, muſt the ſame day of the Eclipſe obſerue
by the Aſtrolabe at what houre the Eclipſe beginneth in that
place, whereof you knowe not the Longitude: For if the Eclipſe
doe beginne in both places at one ſelfe houre, then aſſure
your ſelfe that both places haue one ſelfe Longitude, but if it
beginne ſooner or later, then there is difference betwixt them, according
to the varietie of the time, which difference is thus to
be knowne: Take the leſſer ſumme of houres out of the greater,
and there ſhall remaine either houres, or minutes, or both,
if houres, then multiply the ſame by fiftéene, if minutes, deuide
the ſame by foure, (for in this account fiftéene degrées doe make
one houre, and foure minutes doe make one degrée) and adde the
difference ſo found to the Longitude, if the Eclipſe doe appeare
there ſooner: if later then ſubtract the ſayd difference from
the knowne Longitude, and that which remaineth will ſhew the

vnknowne longitude. But note by the way, that if there remaine
any minutes after the diuiſion, you muſt multiply thoſe minutes
by 15. and ſo ſhall you haue the minutes of degrees.
                     Shew the vſe of this rule by ſome example.
                     For example I finde by the tables of Ptolomey that the
longitude of Paris in France is 23. degrées, and by ſome Almanacke
or Ephemerides I finde that the Eclipſe doth begin
there at thrée houres after midnight, now by this I would know
the longitude of Tubing a famous citie in Sueuia, which is a
region of Germany, at which towne in the verie day of the Eclipſe
I cauſe to bee obſerued by Aſtrolabe at what houre the
Eclipſe beginneth there, and I finde that it beginneth at 3. of
the clocke and 24′· after midnight, then by ſubtracting the
leſſer number of time out of the greater, I find the remainder to
bée 24′· which béeing deuided by 4′· which doe make one degrée,
the quotient ſhall be 6. degrées, and that is the difference, which
being added to the knowne longitude of Paris (becauſe the Eclipſe
is ſooner there than at Tubing) it maketh in all 9. degrées,
whereby I gather that the longitude of Tubing is 29. degrées,
by this meanes all the Tables of Coſmographers are moſt commonlie
made, and yet manie times they greatly differ in their
longitudes for lacke perhaps of vſing diligence in taking the
right houre and moment of the Eclipſe, and for not dulie conſidering
the diuers aſpects, and what latitude the Moone hath at that
inſtant which may cauſe great error.
                  
                  
                     A readie way to finde out the longitude of any place, inuented
by Gemma Friſius.
Chap. 10.
                     
                        THat way is done by the helpe of ſome true
Horologie or watch apt to bee carried in
iournying, which by an Aſtrolabe is to bée
rectified and ſet iuſt at ſuch houre as you
depart from the place where you are, to
goe to any other place whereof you are
deſirous to know the longitude, in which
your going you muſt bee diligent to ſée

that your watch neuer ceaſe going, and being arriued at that
place whereof you ſéeke to know the longitude, you muſt tary vntill
the Index do iuſtlie touch the pricke of ſome perfect houre,
and alſo at that inſtant, to ſée what houre it is by your Aſtrolabe,
for if your Aſtrolabe and watch do both agrée in one, then aſſure
your ſelfe that there is no difference of longitude, but that you
haue trauelled ſtill vnder one ſelfe Meridian eyther towards the
North or South. But if they differ one houre or certaine minutes,
then reduce them to degrées, or to the minutes of degrées in ſuch
order as is before taught, and thereby you ſhall finde the longitude
which you deſire to know. But to take the longitude of anie
place vpon the ſea by this manner of way, moſt men thinke it
were a great deale better to doe it by the helpe of a great houre
glaſſe, made to run 24. houres, which muſt be watched when it
is ready to run out, that it may be immediately turned: for watches
made of Iron or Stéele will ſoone ruſt vpon the ſea. This
way of taking the longitude and many others I doubt not but
that M. Borrough hath tryed, & thereby is able to iudge which is
beſt, wherfore in mine opinion hée may do his country great good
by ſetting downe in writing that way which hee by experience
knoweth to be beſt and readieſt, for want whereof the Mariners
cardes do make the ſea men oft to erre in their voiages.
                  
                  
                     Another way taught by Appian to finde out the longitude
of any place with the croſſe ſtaffe by knowing the diſtance
betwixt the Moone and ſome knowne ſtarre that is ſituated
nigh vnto the Ecliptique line.
Chap. 11.
                     
                        FIrſt ſéeke to knowe by the Aſtronomicall Tables
the true moouing of the Moone according
to the longitude at the time of your obſeruation
at ſome certaine place, for whoſe Meridian the
rootes of thoſe Tables are calculated and verefied.
Alſo you muſt know the degrée of longitude
of ſome fixed Starre nigh vnto the Ecliptique, going eyther
next before or els next after the moouing of the Moone, then

you muſt ſéeke out the diſtance of the moouing of the Moone and
of the ſaid Starre, which diſtance once had, apply the croſſe ſtaffe
to your eye, and mooue the croſſe vp and downe vntill you may
ſée the center of the bodie of the Moone with the one end of the
croſſe and the foreſaid fixed Star with the other end of the croſſe,
ſo ſhall the croſſe ſhew you by the degrées and minutes marked
vpon the ſtaffe, the diſtance of the Moone and of the foreſaide
Starre aunſwerable to the place of your obſeruation, which being
ſet downe, ſet downe alſo the diſtance betwixt the Moone and the
foreſaid Starre that was firſt calculated, and then take the leſſer
out of the greater, ſo ſhall remaine the laſt difference, which may
be rightly called the diuerſitie of aſpectes, which difference if
you deuide by the moouing which the Moone maketh in one houre,
you ſhall knowe thereby the time in which the Moone is or was
ioyned with the firſt diſtance of the foreſaid Starre, then hauing
conuerted that time into degrées and minutes, adde or ſubtract
the product thereof to or from that Meridian, vnto which the
Tables (whereby you firſt calculated the moouing of the Moone)
were verefied, that is to ſay, if the diſtance betwixt the Moone
and the fixed Starre of your obſeruation be leſſer, then adde the
degrées and minutes to the knowne longitude, ſo ſhall you find
the place of your obſeruation to be more Eaſtward, but if it bée
greater, then ſubtract the degrées and minutes from the known
longitude, and the place of your obſeruation ſhall bee more weſtward.
All which rules Gemma Friſius affirmeth to be true, ſo
as the Moone be more weſtward than the fixed Starre: for if at
the time of your obſeruation the Moone bee more Eaſtwarde,
then you muſt worke cleane contrarie, that is to ſay, if the diſtance
betwixt the Moone and the fixed Starre bee leſſer, you
muſt ſubtract the degrées and minutes from the knowne longitude,
ſo ſhall the place of your obſeruation bee more Weſtward:
but if it be greater, then you muſt adde the degrées and
minutes vnto the knowne longitude, and you ſhall finde the place
of your obſeruation to be more Eaſtward.
                  
                  
                     
                     How to know the diſtance of places, that is to ſay, how many
miles one place is diſtant from another, and howe many
wayes places are ſaid to differ in diſtance one from another.
Chap. 12.
                     
                        THe diſtance may be knowne diuerſe wayes, that
is, either Arithmetically, Geometrically, or by
the Tables of Sinus. But before I ſhew you the
order of any of theſe wayes, you haue to vnderſtand
that any two places do differ in diſtance one
from another one of theſe 3. maner of wayes, that
is, either in latitude onely, or in longitude onely, or els in both: if
two places hauing one ſelfe longitude do differ onely in latitude,
then according to the Arithmetical way you muſt ſubtract the
leſſer latitude out of the greater, and the remainder ſhall be the
difference, which being multiplied by 60. will ſhewe the number
of miles as for example, London and Roan hauing in a manner
one ſelfe longitude, doe differ onely in latitude, for the latitude of
London is 51. degrées 32′· & the latitude of Roan is 49. degrées
and 10′· which being the leſser latitude and therefore to bee taken
out of 51. degrées 32′· there remaineth 2. degrées 22′· which 2.
degrées being multiplied by 60. maketh 120. whereunto if for
the 22′· annexed to the degrées you adde 22. miles (for euery minute
is a mile) it ſhall make in all 142. miles, which by a right line
is the true diſtance betwixt London and Roan. But you haue to
note that the difference of 2. ſundry latitudes is not to be knowne
by ſubtracting the leſſer out of the greater, vnles both the places
be ſo ſituated, as both may haue either North latitude or South
latitude, for if the one place haue North latitude and the other
South latitude, the difference is to be known by addition, and not
by ſubtraction: as for example, Naples in Italy hath 41. degrées
of North latitude, and la Madalena in Aphricke not farre from
Manicongo, hath 8. degrées of ſouth latitude, both places hauing
one ſelf Meridian, here the difference of theſe two latitudes is to
be knowne by addition, and not by ſubtracting the leſſer out of the
greater, for 8. and 41. being added together do make 49. and that
is ye true difference, which being multiplied by 60. maketh 2940.
miles. So likewiſe the difference of the two longitudes is not

alwayes knowne by ſubtracting the leſſer out of the greater, vnleſſe
the two places haue both Eaſt longitude or els both Weſt
longitude: As for example Lisbona in Spaine hath in Eaſt. longitude
13. degrées and Cap de losſlauos in the Weſt Indies
hath in weſt longitude 334. degrées: here the difference of theſe
two longitudes is not to be known by taking the leſſer out of the
greater, but thus, firſt take 334. out of 360. and there will remaine
26. degrées, wherunto if you ad the Eaſt longitude for Lisbona,
which is 13. degrées, it wil make in all 39. degrées, which is
the true difference of the 2. longitudes, for if you ſhould take 13.
degrées out of 334. there would remaine 321. which is not the
true difference. But to know the diſtance of two places differing
in longitude, this Table here following is needfull.

Describe this Table.
                     This Table is diuided into 6. collums, euerie collum containing,
firſt the degrées of longitude, and then the miles and ſeconds
of miles anſwerable to euerie degrée, for euerie degree of
the verie Equinoctiall it ſelfe is in value 60. miles, but the further
you goe from the Equinoctiall either Northward or Southward,
euery degrée of latitude is leſser in value than other, and
containeth fewer miles, as you may eaſilie sée by the ſaid Table,
procéeding from one degrée to 90. which is the greateſt latitude
that any place can haue.
                  
                  
                     How to know by the helpe of the foreſaide Table the diſtance
of two places differing onely in longitude.
Chap. 13.
                     
                        YOu muſt multiplie the difference of the
longitudes by the number of miles anſwerable
to the latitudes of the ſaid places,
omitting alwayes the ſeconds of
miles ſet down in the ſaid Table, becauſe
in this account they are of ſmall importance:
as for example, London and Antwerp,
hauing both in a maner one ſelfe latitude,
do differ onlie in longitude 6. degrées
42′· which difference being multiplyed by 37. miles anſwerable
to 51. degrées of latitude, as you ſée in the Table, doe
make in all 247. miles and 54″· of a mile. But in making this
multiplication, you muſt firſt multiply the 6. whole degrées by
37. and the product thereof will amount to 222. then by the rule
of proportion you may find out the value of the minutes annexed
to the degrées of the difference of longitude in ſaying thus, if
60′· which is one degrée, do require 37. miles, what ſhall 42′· require.
And by working according to the rule of proportion, you
ſhall find the fourth number which you ſéeke to bée 25. miles and
54″· which being added to the firſt product 222. maketh in all
247. miles and 54″· of a mile, which wanteth but 6″· to make
vp another mile.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        How to finde out the true diſtance of two places differing
both in longitude and latitude by the Arithmeticall way.
Chap. 14.
                        
                           HOw is that done?
                        Firſt, take the difference of the longitudes
and latitudes of both places by ſubtracting
the leſſer out of the greater, then
conuert the ſame into miles by multiplying
the difference of the two longitudes
into the miles that be anſwerable to the
latitude of each place, which miles you
ſhall find in the Table aforeſaid, and if
there be any minutes annexed to the degrées of the difference of
longitude, then reduce the ſame alſo to miles by the rule of proportion,
as before is taught, and hauing added the two products
together, halfe the ſumme, and ſet it by it ſelfe. Then multiply
the difference of the latitudes into 60. miles, and adde thereunto
the fraction of minutes annexed to the ſaid difference if it hath
anie fraction, allowing for euerie minute one mile, and ſet that
number alſo by it ſelfe: that done, ſquare the ſummes reſerued,
that is to ſay, multiplie ech one part by it ſelfe into it ſelfe, and
hauing added the two products together into one ſumme, ſéeke
out the ſquare roote thereof, & that ſhal be the true diſtance of the
two places. As for example, if you would knowe the true diſtance
betwixt London and Venice, firſt you muſt knowe by ſome Table
the longitude and latitude of both townes, wherefore finding
the longitude of London to be 19. degrées, 54′· and the latitude
thereof to be 51. degrées, 32′· And the longitude of Venice to be
35. degrées, 30′· and the latitude thereof to be 44. degrées, 45′·
Now by ſubtracting the leſſer longitude out of the greater, I
finde the difference of longitude to bee 15. degrees, 36′· and by
ſubtracting the leſſer latitude out of the greater, I find the difference
of latitude to be 6. degrées, 47′· Then knowing the latitude
of London to be 51. degrées, I reſort to the table of miles appointed
for euerie degrée of latitude before ſet downe, and theer I
find that to 51. degrées of latitude do anſwere 37. miles and certaine

ſeconds, which being of ſmall moment are not woont to be
reckoned. Then in multiplying the difference of the longitudes
which is 15. degrées 36′· by 37. miles I find the product of the
15. degrées ſo multiplied to be 555. and becauſe there bée 36′·
annexed to the foreſaid 15. degrées, I ſéeke by the rule of proportion
to knowe how many miles that fraction containeth, in
ſaying thus, if 60. require 37. what ſhall 36. require? and I find
22. miles, which being added to 555. maketh 577. then by ſéeking
in the foreſaid table how manie miles be anſwerable to the latitude
of Venice, which is 44. degrées, I find the number of
miles to be 43. by which number I multiply once againe the
difference of longitude, which is 15. degrées. 36′· the product
whereof, together with the fraction annexed thereunto being
conuerted into miles by the rule of proportion, as before, doth amount
to 670. which ſum being added to the former conuerted
longitude, which is 577. maketh in all 1247. the halfe whereof
is 623. which halfe number I reſerue by it ſelfe, that done I
multiply the difference of the latitude, which is 6. degrées 47′· by
60. miles, in saying 6. times 60. maketh 360. whereunto I adde
for the 47′· annexed 47. miles, & it maketh in al 407. which ſum
I reſerue alſo by it ſelf. Then I multiplie the firſt reſerued number
into it ſelfe, the product whereof is 388129. That done,
I multiplie the ſeconde reſerued number alſo into it ſelfe, the
product whereof is 165649. which two laſt productes being
added together, do make in all 553778. whereof the ſquare roote
being taken, is 744. miles, which is the true diſtance of Venice
by a right line from London. And to the intent that the order
and working herein may more plainly appeare vnto you, I haue
ſet downe all the particular numbers of the ſame here by them
ſelues, as it were in a Table.

Chap. 14.
                        
                           BVt now becauſe the way before taught
to finde out ſuch diſtance by the Arithmeticall
way may ſéeme perhaps to ſome
folkes very buſie and tedious, I haue
thought good therefore to ſet downe this
other way which was ſent me not long
ſince from my louing friend M. Wright
of Cayes colledge in Cambridge who is
wel learned in the Mathematicals, & is ſo
apt therunto by nature, as he is like inogh to attain to ſuch perfit

knowledge therein as he may be able thereby hereafter greatly
to perfect his country, if for want of ſufficient exhibition he bée
not forced to leaue ſo noble a ſtudie, wherefore I wiſh with al my
heart that all Gentlemen of abilitie were minded to ſhew their
liberalitie towards him in that behalfe. But to returne to my
matter, I ſay that the way to find out the foreſaid diſtance is this
here following: firſt hauing drawne a demi-circle vpon a right
Diameter (the larger that the demi-circle is the better,) and diuided
the ſame into 180. degrees, like vnto this hereafter deſcribed,
and marked with the letters a b c d. whereof d. is the center
and a. c. the Diameter. Then learne firſt by ſome Table
to know the longitude the latitude of both places, and the difference
of their longitudes, as you did before in ſéeking to know by
the Arithmetical way the diſtance betwixt London and Venice,
the difference of whoſe two longitudes is 15. degrées, and 36′· as
you may ſée in the former Table: for in working by this way, you
haue chiefly to ſéeke out in the circumference of the demicircle but
thrée things, that is, firſt, the difference of the two longitudes, ſecondlie,
the leſser latitude, and laſt of all the greateſt latitude.
Knowing therefore the difference of the ſaid two places in longitude
to be 15. degrées, 36′· ſéeke out the ſame in the demicircle,
beginning to count at A. and ſo proceed towards B. And at the
end of thoſe degrées and minutes ſet downe a pricke marked with
the letter e. vnto which pricke drawe a right line by your ruler
from D. the center of the demicircle. That done, ſéeke out the
leſſer latitude, which is 44. degrées, and 45′· in the forſaid demicircle,
beginning to account the ſame from the pricke e. and ſo
procéede towards the letter B. and at the end of the ſaid leſſer latitude,
ſet downe another pricke marked with the letter g. from
which prick or point draw a perpendicular line which by help of
your ſquire or compaſſes may fal with right angles vpon the former
right line drawne from D. to e. and where it falleth, there
ſet downe a pricke marked with the letter h. That done, ſéeke out
the greater latitude, which is 51. degrées, and 32′· in the foreſaid
demicircle, beginning to account the ſame from A. towards B.
and at the end of that latitude ſet downe another prick marked
with the letter I. from whence draw another perpendicular line
that may fal by help of your ſquire or cōpaſſes with right angles

vpon the Diameter A. C. and there make a prick marked with
the letter K. That done, take with your compaſſe the diſtance
that is betwixt k. and h. which diſtance you muſt ſet downe vpon
your ſaid Diameter A. C. ſetting the one foote of your compaſſe
vpon k. and the other towardes the center D. and there make a
pricke marked with the letter L. Then take with your Compaſſe
the length of the ſhorter perpendicular line g. h. and apply that
wideneſſe vpon the longer perpendicular line I. K. ſetting the
one foot of your Compaſſe at I. which is the end of the greater latitude,
and extend the other foote towards K. and there make a
pricke marked with the letter M. That done, take the diſtance
betwixt L. and M. with your compaſſe, and apply the ſame to
the demicircle, ſetting the one foote of your Compaſſe in A. and
the other towards B. and there make a prick marked with the letter
N. And the number of degrées contained betwixt A. & N. will
ſhew the true diſtance of the two places, which you ſhall find to be
12. degrées and almoſt 24′· Now by allowing for euery degrée
60. miles, and for euery minute a mile, the ſumme of miles will
agrée with the former diſtance found out by the Arithmetical way
which was 744. miles. And thus you haue to deale to know the
diſtance of any other two places whatſoeuer, differing both in longitude
and latitude. But you haue to note by the way, that if the
difference of the longitudes doth excéede the number of 180. then
you muſt ſubtract that excéeding difference out of 360. and the
remainder ſhall be the difference of the longitudes, and then work
in all points as is before taught. And this way is as Geometricall,
as that which Appian ſetteth downe in his booke of Geographie,
to be done by the helpe of the terreſtriall Globe, the order
whereof here followeth.

Chap. 15.
                     
                        HOw is that done?
                     Moſt readily and eaſily by helpe of a
terreſtrial globe in this maner following.
Firſt take the diſtance of the 2. places by
extending your compaſſe vpon the globe,
from the one place to the other, which if
you would know how many miles it comprehendeth,
apply the ſame diſtance ſo taken
vnto the Equinoctiall line, ſetting the
firſt foot of your compaſſe vpon the firſt Meridian in that point,
whereas it cutteth the Equinoctiall, then ſée how many degrées
of the Equinoctial are comprehended betwixt the two féet of your
Compaſſe, and multiply thoſe degrées by 60. & the product therof
ſhall ſhewe you howe many Italian miles ſuch diſtance is in
length. But if either of the places or both, be wanting and not expreſſed
in the Globe, then you muſt learne by the tables of Ptolomey
or of ſome others, as of Appian, Gemma Friſius, Orontius
or ſuch like, the longitude and latitude of the ſaid places, that
done, hauing ſought out the longitude of the firſt place in the Equinoctiall,
turne the globe about with your hand vntill you haue
brought the longitude right vnder the brazen Meridian, which
being ſtayed there, ſéeke out in the ſaid Meridian the latitude of
the ſaid place, and there ſet a marke vpon the globe, for there the
place ſhould ſtand, and doe in like maner to finde out the ſeconde
place: Then by extending your Compaſſe from the one marke to
the other, you ſhall haue the true diſtance, which diſtance if you
apply to the Equinoctiall like as before is taught, the degrées
thereof being multiplyed by 60. will ſhewe you how many miles
thoſe two places are diſtant one from another.
                     May not the diſtance of places be found out aſwell by an
vniuerſall Map as by the globe terreſtriall?
                     Yes indéed and more readily by reaſon that for the moſt parte
euery Map hath his proper ſkale, ſo as you néed to do no more but
to take the diſtance of the 2. places with your Compaſſe, and to

apply the ſame to the ſkale ſhewing the miles or leagues.
                     What if the Map haue no skale?
                     Then you muſt ſéeke out the diſtance by ſuch meanes as I do
ſhew in my Treatiſe of the vſe of vniuerſall Mappes, and alſo in
my deſcription of Planctius his Map.
                     I pray you in the meane time proceed in ſhewing me the
third way of finding out of the diſtance of places which you
ſaid was per tabulas Sinuum.

                        ticke, where as I boe make a
plaine deſcription of the ſaid Tables, and do ſhew the vſe thereof
aſwel by this as by diuers other examples, wherefore I wiſh you
to reſort to that treatiſe and you ſhal haue your deſire. For hauing
for this time ſufficientlie ſpoken of the longitude, latitude
and diſtance of places, and how the ſame is to bee found out, I
thinke it méet nowe to treat of the 5. Zones, of Climes and Parallels,
whereinto the amient Coſmographers thought good to
deuide the earth, to the intent that euery part thereof night bée
the better known how it is ſituated either Northward or Southward,
whether it be hot or cold, or betwixt both, and of what length
the day and night is in euery place, and what manner of ſhaddow
the Sun yéeldeth euery where, and ſuch like accidents, and firſt of
the 5. Zones.
                  
                  
                     Of the 5. Zones.
Chap. 16.
                     
                        THe moſt ancient Coſmographers conſidering
how the Sun by his oblique, and bariable
courſe did warme with his beames
one part of the earth more than another,
gathered thereby that the earth had thrée
temperatures that is to ſay, extreame hot,
extreame cold, and a meane temperature,
that is, neither too hotte, nor too colde: And
therefore to ſhew vs vnto which of theſe temperatures, any part
of the earth was ſubiect, they deuided the earth into 5. Zones,

anſwerable to the 5. Zones of the firmament, by helpe of the
Equinoctiall and the 4. leſſer circles before deſcribed in the firſt
part of this treatiſe, the 20. Chapter, and are there ſet foorth in
figure which figure I thought good to ſet downe againe in this
place, to the intent you might the better remember what was ſaid
there touching the Zones.
                     
                     But other Coſmographers comming afterward, not ſatiſfied
with the 5. Zones, becauſe they ſhewe nothing but the ſituation
and the thrée temperatures of the earth, did deuide the earth into
certaine Climes and Paraliels, to find out thereby• the length of
the day and night in euery place, and the true latitude thereof as
Ptolomey and many others after him haue done, making ſuch
diuiſions as we ſhal ſpeake of hereafter. But trulie I think with
Mercator, that the beſt and moſt exact way of deuiding the earth
to ſerue all purpoſes is to bee made by degrées and minutes,
wherein is leſſe error than in Climes and Parallels, neither
can Climes or Parallels be ſo well deſcribed when you drawe
night to any of the Poles, for that the ſpaces as well betwixt

the Parallels as betwixt the Meridians doe growe continually
ſtraighter & ſtraighter, as you may ſée in the figure of Parallels
hereafter following.
                     I remember that in the 20. chapter wheras you deſcribed
the 5. Zones, you ſaid that the ancient men did greatly erre in
affirming 3. of the Zones to be vnhabitable, that is, the two
colde Zones and the hot Zone, I pray you therefore ſhew me
here the cauſe why they erred?
                     They erred for lacke of experience, becauſe they had neuer
traueled into thoſe regions, but in theſe latter dayes men of diuers
nations, ſpecially the Spaniſh, Engliſh, French, & Flemmiſh
haue trauelled very farre, ſome towards the North pole,
and ſome towardes the South pole, and alſo through the burnt
Zone, for thoſe that ſayle from the North parres towardes the
South pole, or from the South partes towards the North pole,
muſt néeds paſſe in their voiage through the burnt Zone: and
theſe men doe affirme that they haue found all the 3. Zones, that
is to ſay, the two cold and hotte Zones to be well inhabited. And
our late Coſmographers doe not let to render cauſe why they
ſhould be habitable, for (ſay they) though the cold be very extream
in thoſe regions that lie next vnto the Poles, yet the Sun appearing
and giuing ſhine vnto them both day and night, doth greatlie
qualifie and moderate the extreame cold of thoſe regions. But
truly, in mine opinion, they haue ſmall comfort of the Sun, ſith it
ſtriketh almoſt round about their féet, without yéelding any warm
reflexe from aboue, and eſpecially to thoſe that doe inhabite nigh
to either of the Poles. Againe, they ſay that the burnt Zone is
habitable, by reaſon that the night to them is continually as long
as the day, the cooleneſſe whereof doth greatly refreſh the extream
heat of the day. But now let vs returne to our purpoſe, and ſpeak
ſomewhat of the Climes and Parallels, & becauſe euery Clime
cōſiſteth of 2. Parallels, I think it beſt to ſpeak firſt of Parallels.
                  
                  
                     Of Parallels.
Chap. 17.
                     
                        WHat be Parallels.
                     Parallels be lines either right or circular alwaies
equallie diſtant one from another ſo as they can neuer
méete. And of Parallels that are to be conſidered in the

Spheare, ſome make 3. kinds, according to their thréefold ſignification,
for ſome are called the Parallels of the ſunne, who in departing
from the Equinoctiall towards any of the Poles, maketh
euery day throughout the yeare one Parallel, ſo as in going from
the Equinoctiall to the Tropique of Cancer, he maketh 182 Parallels.
And as many againe in going from the Equinoctiall to
the Tropique of Capricorne. The ſecond kinde of Parallels are
called the Parallels of Latitude, And the third the Parallels of
the longeſt day, which two laſt are in effect both one, for the further
that any Parallel is ſituated from the Equinoctiall towards
either of the Poles, the more Latitude it hath, & ſo by conſequent
maketh the day longer to thoſe that dwell vnder that Parallel, of
which Parallels the auncient Coſmographers do make in all but
21. procéeding proportionally either towards the North pole or
South pole, as you may ſée by this figure here following the middle
line or Circle whereof is the Equinoctiall.
                     
                     
                        
And euery Parallel procéeding from the ſaid Equinoctiall, eyther
Northward or Southward, doth lengthen ye day by one quarter
of an houre in ſuch proportion as this Table here following
ſheweth, appointing to the firſt Parallel, and next vnto the Equinoctial
4. degr. & 15′· and to the ſecond parallel 8. degr. 30′· and ſo
foorth vntil you come to the 21. Parallel paſſing through ye Iland,
which Parallel is diſtant from the Equinoctial 63. degr. 16′· further
then which Parallel Northward, the Tables of Ptolomie
doe not extend, and Southward they extend no further then to that
Parallel which hath leſſe 20. degrées of Latitude.

                        WHat is a Clime?
                     A Clime is a ſpace of the earth comprehended
betwixt two Parallels, in which ſpace the longeſt
day doth vary by halfe an houre.
                     How many Climes be there?
                     The auncient Coſmographers deuided aſwell that part of the
earth which lyeth betwixt the Equinoctiall and the North pole, ſo
much I ſay as they thought to be habitable, as alſo the habitable
part which lyeth betwixt the Equinoctiall and the South pole, ech
of them into 7. Climes, to euery of which Northerne Climes they
gaue a ſeuerall proper name, according to the name of the place
through which the midſt of the ſaid Clime did paſſe, for they called
the firſt Clime Diameroes, Dia is a Gréeke prepoſition ſignifying

in Engliſh By or Through, and Meroes is a Citie of Egypt
ſituated in a certaine Ile encloſed with the flood Nilus, which Ile
hath alſo the like name. The ſecond Clime is called Dia Syenes,
which is alſo a Citie in Egypt ſituated right vnder the Tropique
of Cancer. The third Clime is called Dia Alexandrias, which is
another Citie of Egypt ſituated vpon the Weſt mouth of Nilus,
falling into the ſea of Egypt. The fourth Clime is called Dia
Rhodou, Rhodos is the chiefeſt Citie of an Ile called Rhodos,
ſtanding in the ſea called Mare Carpathium, waſhing the Southweſt
end of Natolia, ſometime called Aſia minor, which Ilande,
together with the Citie Rhodos, Suliman the great Turke wan
not many yeares ſince from the Chriſtians. The people of this
Ile in S. Paules time were called Coloſsians, to whom he wrote
one Epiſtle, and they were ſo called of a great brazen Image called
in Latine Coloſſus, containing in Altitude 105. féete, which
was dedicated to the Sunne, or as ſome ſay to Iupiter. The firſt
Clime is called Dia Rhomes, that is to ſay by Rome that famous
Citie of Italy, and ſometime head of all the world. The ſixth is
called of the old men Dia Boriſthenes, notwithſtanding the moderne
writers thinke that it may be more rightly called Dia Pontou,
Pontus is both a Sea and Country lying Eaſtwarde right
againſt Conſtantinople. The ſeuenth Clime is called of the olde
men Dia Ripheos, but of the moderne writers Dia Boriſthenes
which is a great flood of Scithia in the South part of Sarmatia,
which falleth into the ſea called Mare Euxinum. To theſe ſeuen
Climes Appian addeth two others, ſo as in all he ſetteth downe
nine Climes, making the eight Clime to paſſe through Ripheos
which are mountaines enuironing Sarmatia on the North ſide,
and the ninth through Denmarke.
                     
                     What names did they giue to the Southerne Climes?
                     The ſelfe ſame that the Northerne Climes haue, ſauing that
they put before euery ſuch name this Gréeke word Anti, which is
as much to ſay as Contrarie or Right againſt, as Anti Meroes,
Anti Syenes, &c. as you may eaſily perceiue by this figure of
Climes here following, notwithſtanding none of thoſe Southern
Climes were knowne to Ptolomie more then Anti-meroes,
and hardly all that, the furtheſt part whereof hath not twentie degrées
of Latitude.

the beginning, the midſt, & the end. And if you would know what
degrées and minutes of Latitude euery ſuch part hath, that is to
ſay, how many degrées euery ſuch part is diſtant from the Equinoctiall,

May not the North and South part of the world ech of them
be deuided into more then 9. Climes?
                     Yes indéede as our latter writers affirme, for betwixt the Equinoctiall
and the 66. degrée and 30′· of Latitude in which the longeſt
day containeth full 24. houres without hauing any night,
they make 48. Parallels, and thereby 24. Climes, for euery
Clime containeth two Parallels, and euery Parallell maketh
the day to increaſe by one quarter of an houre as hath béene ſaide
before. But from thence forth, though you may continue the Parallels
almoſte to the very pole, yet you can make no more but
24. Climes by reaſon that the ſpaces of the Parallels towardes
either of the Poles, do grow more narrow euery one then other,
ſo as from 66. degrées and 30. minutes of Latitude vnder which
the Circle Arctique paſſeth, the longeſt day is not to be counted
any more by houres, but by whole dayes, wéekes, and monethes,
in ſo much as they which dwell right vnder the North pole,
whoſe Zenith is the pole it ſelfe, haue ſixe monethes day whilſt
the Sunne abideth in the ſixe Northerne ſignes, and 6. moneths
night, the Sunne being in the ſixe Southerne ſignes. And contrariwiſe
they that dwell right vnder the South pole haue 6. months
day, the Sunne being in the 6. Southerne ſignes, and 6. months
night whileſt the Sunne remaineth in the 6. Northerne ſignes.
But becauſe I thinke it a more readie way to account the length
of the day by the degrées of Latitude, then by Climes or Parallels,
I thought good here to ſet downe Orontius his Table made
for that purpoſe, which from the 67. degrée of Latitude to the
North pole agréeth in all points with the Table of Iohannes de
Sacro Buſto, in which Table from the ſaide 67. degrée is not
onely ſet downe the longeſt day, but alſo what portion of the Zodiaque
alwaies appeareth aboue the Horizon, which portion when
it containeth one whole ſigne, then the day is one moneth long,
and the night as much, if two ſignes, then the day is two months
long and the night as much, and ſo foorth ſucceſſiuely vntill you
come to 6 ſignes, which is the one halfe of the Zodiaque, making
both day and night ech of them ſixe monethes long, as I haue
ſaide before, and as you may plainely ſée with your eye by placing
the Spheare on his Horizon at euery ſuch Latitude.

                        How the bredth & length of euery Clime is to be known.
                        The breadth is to be knowne by multiplying the degrées of
difference contained betwixt the beginning & end of euery Clime
by 60. miles: And if the degrées of difference haue any minutes
annexed thereunto, then you muſt adde ſo many miles as there be
minutes, to the product of the former multiplication. Nowe to
haue the length of euery Clime, you muſt ſéeke to knowe by the
Table of miles, how many miles be anſwerable to one degrée of
that Parallell of Latitude which paſſeth through the midſt of the
Clime, and by that number of miles multiply 360. and the product
thereof ſhall be thē length. But if the degrées of that Latitude
haue any minutes annexed thereunto, then you muſt finde
out the miles of thoſe minutes by the rule of proportion in ſaying
thus: if 60. doe require ſo many miles as you founde in the
Table of miles, what ſhall ſo many minutes require, and adde
the quotient thereof to the product of the former multiplication,
ſo ſhall you haue the true length of the Clime, all which thinges
are obſerued in the foreſaid Table, which Table by obſeruing like

order, you may extend (if you will) to the number of 24. Climes,
ſet downe by Orontius and by diuerſe other moderne writers.
                     
                  
                  
                     Of the diuerſe ſeaſons and ſhadowes incident to diuerſe
Climes and Parallels, and firſt what ſeaſons and ſhadowes they
haue that dwell right vnder the Equinoctiall.
Chap. 19.
                     
                        THoſe that dwel right vnder the firſt Clime,
and ſpecially right vnder the Equinoctial,
which people at one inſtant may ſée both
the Poles, haue two ſommers and two
winters, for the ſun hauing to paſſe right
ouer their heads twice in the yeare, which
is when he is in Aries, and againe in Libra,
then they muſt néedes haue two ſommers,
becauſe the ſunne at both thoſe times is nigheſt vnto them,
but when he is in Cancer or in Capricorne, then he is furtheſt frō
them, and thereby maketh vnto them two Winters. But yet neither
of them ſo cold as our winter is, whereby it appeareth that
our two times of Spring and Autumne are to them 2. ſommers,
& our two times of ſommer and winter are to them two winters.
                     What ſhadowes haue thoſe inhabitants?
                     They haue fiue ſundry ſhadowes, for when the Sunne is in either
of the Equinoxes, they caſt their ſhadow in the morning whē
the ſunne riſeth towards the Weſt. And at night when he goeth
downe towards the Eaſt, and at noone day they haue no ſhadowe
at all, but a perpendicular ſhadowe, which ſtréeketh right downe
from head to foote, becauſe the ſunne being then in the Equinoctiall,
muſt néedes at that time of the day be right ouer their heads,
as you may plainely ſée in euery material Spheare, hauing a foote
with a firme Horizon, and dwely placed to ſhew a right Spheare,
but when the ſunne is in any of the Southerne ſignes, then the
foreſaid inhabitants doe caſt their ſhadowe towardes the North,
And when he is in the Northerne ſignes, they caſt their ſhadowe
towards the South, and becauſe they dwell in a right Spheare,
their daies and nights be alwaies equall.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the ſeaſons and ſhadowes which they haue that dwell
betwixt the equinoctiall and the Tropique of Cancer.
Chap. 20.
                     
                        THeſe haue alſo two ſommers and two winters,
and 5. ſhadowes like vnto the others becauſe the
ſunne paſſeth twice in the yeare right ouer their
heads, firſt in his declining from the Equinoctiall
towards Cancer, and againe in his returning
from Cancer towards the Equinoctiall,
vnder which Clime Arabia foelix is ſaid to be ſituated. For Lucan
writeth that the Arabians comming to Rome to aide Pompey,
meruailed much to ſée that the trées did neuer caſt their ſhadowes
on the left hand, becauſe in their countrey their ſhadowe
is ſometime on the right hande, and ſometime on the left, ſometime
perpendicular, ſometime orientall, and ſometime occidentall,
but in Rome and in all other places beyond the Tropique of
Cancer the ſhadowe alwayes at noonetide tendeth Northward,
the words of Lucan be thus, Ignotum vobis Arabes veniſtis in
orbem vmbras mirati nemorum non ire ſiniſtras.
                     
                     How is Lucan to be vnderſtood here in vſing this ſpeech on
the left hand?
                     As all other Poets are, for they hauing regard to the Weſt, do
alwaies make the North part their right hande, and the South
part the left. But the Aſtronomers hauing regard to the South,
do make the Weſt their right hand, and the Eaſt their left hand:
againe the Geographers contrariwiſe hauing regarde to the
North, doe make the Eaſt their right and the Weſt their left
hand, whereby you may ſée that the right hand and left hand may
be taken thrée manner of waies, that is according to the manner of
the Poets, of the Aſtronomers, and of the Geographers.
                     Sith theſe inhabitants haue ſeaſons and ſhadowes like to
thoſe that dwel right vnder the Equinoctiall, wherein then do
they differ?
                     They differ in that their dayes & nights be not alwaies equall,
by reaſon that their Horizon declineth from the poles of the world,
and by cutting the Parallels of the ſunne with oblique Angles it
deuideth thoſe Parallels into vnequall parts, neither can their

two ſommers be ſo extremely hotte as the others, becauſe the
ſunne for the moſt part is further from them.
                  
                  
                     Of the ſeaſons and ſhadowes which they haue that dwell
right vnder the Tropique of Cancer.
Chap. 21.
                     
                        THey haue but one ſommer and one winter,
by reaſon that the ſun neuer paſſeth right
ouer their heads but once in the yeare, and
that is when he entreth into the firſt degrée
of Cancer: In which time when the ſunne
riſeth, the ſhadowe tendeth towardes the
Weſt, and at noone the ſhadow is perpendicular
enclining on neither ſide, but falling
right downe. And at night when the ſunne goeth downe, the
ſhadow tendeth towards the Eaſt: and at all other times of the
yeare the ſhadow at noonetide falleth alwaies Northward, and as
touching their daies and nights, they ſhorten and lengthen according
as the ſunne either approcheth towards Cancer, or retireth
towards Capricorne.
                     
                  
                  
                     Of the ſeaſons and ſhadowes which they haue that dwell
betwixt the Tropique of Cancer and the circle Arctique.
Chap. 22.
                     
                        THey haue alſo one ſommer and one winter as
we haue here in England, for the ſunne neuer paſſeth
right ouer their heads, by reaſon that ſo ſoone
as he hath made his laſt and higheſt Parallell in
Cancer, he returneth againe Southward, and
therefore their ſhadow is neuer at noonetide perpendicular
but ſhooteth Northward, and the dayes and nights do
lengthen and ſhorten according as the ſunne maketh his courſe
either through the Northerne or Southerne ſignes. For whileſt
he paſſeth through the Northerne ſignes the dayes are longer thē
the nights, and in paſſing through the Southerne ſignes he maketh
the nights longer then the dayes.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the ſeaſons and ſhadowes which they haue that dwell
right vnder the Circle Arctique, and how long their day is.
Chap. 23.
                     
                        THey haue but one Winter and one Sommer, and
their ſhadow alwaies tendeth ſidelong & Northward.
And becauſe their Zenith being in the circle
Arctique, is at all times of the yeare all one
with the Pole of the Zodiaque: the Ecliptique
line therefore muſt néedes be all one with their
Horizon, whereby the one halfe of the Zodiaque in a very moment
doth riſe aboue the Horizon, and the other halfe in the ſame inſtant
goeth downe, and as the whole Tropique of Cancer appeareth
alwayes aboue the Horizon: So the whole Tropique of Capricorne
is alwaies hidden vnder the Horizon, ſo as when the ſunne
entreth into the firſt degrée of Cancer, their day is 24. houres long
and their night but a moment, ſo contrariwiſe when the ſunne entreth
into the firſt degrée of Capricorne, their night is 24. houres
long, and their day but a moment, as you may plainely ſée by placing
the Spheare at the 66. degrée and 30′ of Latitude.
                  
                  
                     What ſeaſons, ſhadowes and length of day they haue that
dwell betwixt the circle Arctique and the pole Arctique.
Chap. 24.
                     
                        THeſe haue like ſeaſōs and ſhadowes as thoſe that
dwell vnder the circle Arctique, ſauing that their
Winter is colder and longer, becauſe the nigher
they approch to the Pole, the further are they frō
the ſunne, and alſo haue both longer dayes and
nights, for the more that the Pole is eleuated aboue
their Horizon, the greater portion of the Zodiaque doth alwaies
appeare aboue the ſame, which portion if it containe one
whole ſigne, then their day is a moneth long, and their night as
much, if two whole ſignes, then their day is two moneths long,
and their night as much, and ſo foorth as hath béene ſaid before.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of thoſe that dwell right vnder the Pole.
Chap. 25.
                     
                        WHat ſeaſons, ſhadowes, and length of day haue they
that dwell right vnder the Pole, if there be anie
ſuch people?
                     Truely you doe well to doubt thereof, for in mine
opinion humane nature is not able to ſuffer the extreme cold that
by reaſon muſt néedes be in thoſe parts, neither do I thinke that
euer any man either Chriſtian or Heathen did euer ſayle ſo farre
as to diſcouer any land there. Notwithſtanding if there by any ſuch
people their ſeason is alwayes ſo extreme cold as no part thereof
is worthy to be called a ſommer, but rather a continuall winter,
and as for their ſhadow ſith the ſun when he is at the nigheſt doth
neuer mount aboue their Horizon more then 23. degrées 30′ at the
moſt, their ſhadow muſt néedes go round about them nigher, for
the moſt part to their féete then to their heads, for the pole is their
Zenith, and the Equinoctiall their Horizon, whereby 6. ſignes
which is the one halfe of the Zodiaque, doth alwaies appeare aboue
their Horizon, and the other halfe is alwaies hidden vnder
their Horizon, and thereby they haue 6. moneths day & 6. moneths
night, day I ſay whileſt the ſunne is in the 6. Northerne ſignes, &
night, whileſt the ſunne is in the 6. Southerne ſignes, and yet the
night can not be ſo darke there as elſewhere, by reaſon that the
ſunne is neuer diſtant from their Horizon aboue 23. degrées 30′·
which is only when he entreth into the firſt degrée of Capricorne.
So likewiſe the day with them can neuer be ſo cleare as elſwhere,
by reaſon that the ſunne mounting no higher aboue their Horizon
then 23. degr. 30′· which onely is when he entreth into the firſt degrée
of Cancer, hath no power to diſſolue their groſſe, thicke, cloudie
and miſtie aire, yet haue they ſome preheminence in that they
may (if their cloudie aire be not the let) alwaies ſée all the fixed
ſtarres that are placed in the ſky betwixt the Equinoctiall and the
Pole, becauſe they neuer go down but are alwaies remaining aboue
their Horizon: whereas in all other parts of the worlde, the
ſaid ſtarres can not be ſéene all at once, for that they both riſe and
ſet, more or leſſe in number according as the Zenith of the inhabitants
of euery place is more or leſſe diſtant from the Equinoctiall.
                  
                  
                     
                     By what names certaine inhabitants of the earth are called,
as well according to the diuerſitie or likeneſſe of ſhadowes as
of ſituation.
Chap. 26.
                     
                        YOu ſhall vnderſtand that according to the diuerſitie
or likeneſſe of ſhadowes, the auncient Coſmographers
haue giuen to the inhabitants certaine
Gréeke names, whereof ſome are called
Aphiſcij, ſome Heteroſcij, & ſome Periſcij.
                     
                     Shew what theſe names do dignifie.
                     
                        Amphiſcij be thoſe that caſt their ſhadowes both wayes, that
is ſometime towardes the North, and ſometime towardes the
South, as thoſe that inhabite the burnt Zone.
                     
                        Heteroſcij be thoſe that caſt their ſhadowe onely one way, as
thoſe that dwell in either of the temperate Zones, for if they
dwell in the North temperate Zone, they do caſt their ſhadow alwaies
at noonetide towards the North. And if they dwell in the
South temperate Zone they caſt their ſhadowe at noonetide towardes
the South.
                     
                        Periſcij are thoſe that caſt their ſhadow round about them as
thoſe that dwell in either of the cold Zones, to whom the Pole is
their Zenith: againe they giue them certaine names according
to the diuerſitie or likenes of their ſituation and of the ſeaſons incident
to thoſe places, whereof ſome are called Antoeci, ſome Perioeci,
and ſome Antipodes ſiue Antichtones.
                     
                     What doe theſe names ſignifie?
                     
                        Antoeci be two ſundry Nations, the one dwelling towardes
the North pole, and the other towards the South pole, hauing
one ſelfe Meridian and one ſelfe Latitude, that is to ſay be of like
diſtance from the Equinoctiall, the one Southward and the other
Northward, as the letters a. b. in the figure folowing do ſhew.
                     
                        Perioeci be thoſe that dwell in one ſelfe Parallell, how diſtant
ſoeuer they be Eaſt and Weſt as the letters b. c. in the ſaid figure
doe ſhew.
                     
                        Antipodes be thoſe that dwell féete, ſo as a right line
being drawne from the one to the other, paſſeth through the Centre
of the world as you may ſée by the Letters a. c. in the figure
following.
                     
                        
                        
                     
                     And the firſt of theſe called Antoeci haue contrarie ſeaſons of
the yeare, for whē it is ſommer to the one, it is winter to the other:
Againe Perioeci, though they haue like ſeaſons of the yeare, yet
becauſe they are ſo farre diſtant in length one from an other, it is
therfore mid-day to the one when it is mid-night to the other. But
Antipodes be contrary in ſeaſons and in all other things, hauing
nothing common, more then that they haue one ſelfe Horizon.
                  
                  
                     By what names certaine parts of the earth are called by reaſon
of their diuerſe ſhapes.
Chap. 27.
                     
                        NOw beſides the foreſaid names attributed to the inhabitants
of the earth for ſuch reſpect as is aboue ſaid, the
Coſmographers doe giue alſo to diuerſe parts of the
earth according to ye diuers ſhapes therof diuers names
alſo: for if any part of the earth be enuironed round with water either
ſalt or freſh, it is called Inſula, that is an Iland, as England,
Ireland, & ſuch like, but if the water goe round about it ſauing in
one part, thē it is called peninſula, that is to ſay, almoſt an Iland,
as Denmarke, Italy, Morea, and ſuch like, and if it be a narrow
ſtraight encloſed with ye ſea on both ſides, then it is called Iſthmus
                        
as the narrow ſtraight of Corinth lying betwixt Boetia and Achaia
in Gréece which diuers Emperours of Rome haue in vaine
attempted to cut, to thintent to make there through a nauigable
paſſage: finally, when it is neither inſula, peninſula, nor Iſthmus,
then it is called Continens, that is to ſay firme land, as Saxonie,
Boemia, Sueuia, and ſuch like, but theſe be ſpeciall continents, for
the Coſmographers of theſe daies do make but threé general continents,
that is firſt ſo much as was knowne to Ptolomie, and to
the reſt of the auncient writers, ſecondly the Weſt Indies, lately
found out, and thirdly the South part of the world not yet wholly
diſcouered: Againe the auncient men deuided that portion of the
world, which was knowne in their daies into 3. parts, that is, Europe,
Aſia, and Afrique, whereunto the moderne writers haue
added a fourth part called America, containing the Weſt Indies.
Now if you would knowe what Kingdomes, Regions, Cities,
Townes, Seas with their Hauens, Ports, Bayes, and Capes,
Iles, Floods, Mariſhes, and Mountaines, are contained in euery
one of theſe foure parts, then peruſe often the vniuerſall Maps,
aud Terreſtriall Globes, as well of the moderne as of the auncient
Writers, and alſo the Tables of Ptolomie and of Ortelius,
which I wiſh that they had béene made in ſuch forme as the Tables
of Ptolomie are: for hauing the North alwaies ſet in the
front, it ſhould be the readier to compare the ſhape or ſituation of
any place or Region to the vniuerſall Mappe, and by knowing
the Longitude and Latitude of any place, it ſhould be the eaſier
to finde the ſame, as well in the ſpeciall Table as in the vniuerſall
Mappe or Globe. The vſe of which vniuerſall Maps, I haue alreadie
written in a ſeuerall Treatiſe by it ſelfe printed not long
ſince. But now for ſo much as the knowledge of the windes hath
béene alwaies thought a thing méete to be treated of by him that
writeth of Coſmography, and ſpecially of the Spheare, I will
héere ſpeake ſome what of them, neither doe I mind to make any
great diſcourſe thereof, as naturall Philoſophers are woont to
doe, but onely to define what the winde is, and to ſhew into how
many parts the ſame is deuided, as well by the auncient as moderne
writers, and by what names they are called, and ſomewhat
of the qualities thereof.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the wind, what it is, what motion it hath, and of the diuers
names and diuiſions thereof.
Chap. 29.
                     
                        FIrſt then you haue to vnderſtand that Ariſtotle and
the reſt of his ſect, doe define the wind to be an exhalation
hotte and dry, engendred in the bowels of
the earth, and being gotten out, is caried ſidelong
vpon the face of the earth.
                     Why is not his motion right vp & down, aſwel as ſidelong?
                     Becauſe that whileſt by his heat he ſtriueth to mount vp, and to
paſſe through all the thrée Regions of the aire, the middle Region
by his extreme cold, doth alwaies beate him backe, ſo as by ſuch
ſtrife & by the méeting of other exhalations riſing out of the earth,
his motion is forced to be rather round then right.
                     What is the cauſe why he bloweth more ſharpely at one
time then another, and in one place more then another, and
sometime not at all.
                     As the fumes that riſe of new exhalations, & out of flouds and
waters, may encreaſe his force, ſo lacke of heate and fumes doth
diminiſh the ſame. Againe the roundnes of the earth is cauſe that
he bloweth ſomtime more in one place then in another: alſo mountaines,
hils, and great woods may hinder his force in ſome place
of the earth whereas vpon the plain or vpō the broad ſea he bloweth
moſt ſharpely, and as for his not blowing at all, it may chance diuerſe
waies, as either for lacke of ſufficient heate to open the
pores of the earth to let himſelfe out, or for that ſome extreme froſt
and cold doth cloſe the pores of the earth ſo ſtraite as he cannot
get foorth, or for that the ſunne with his extreme heate conſumeth
the fumes and vapours that ſhould maintaine him. But leauing
to anſwere any more to theſe queſtions, I will ſhew you how many
windes were obſerued by ſaylers in old time, and how many
are obſerued at this preſent day, and how they were named. True
it is that all Nations doe agrée in placing the foure principall
winds, according to the foure quarters of the Horizon or Angles
of the world, that is to ſay, Eaſt, Weſt, North and South: but in
the ſubdiuiſions of the ſaide foure quarters they differ, for ſome
deuide euery quarter of the Horizon into two, making onely eight
winds, and ſome into thrée, and there by do make 12. winds which

the auncient Gréekes and the Romaines did chiefely obſerue, the
names of the 8. windes are commonly expreſſed in the Italian
tongue thus: Tramontano, North, Mezzodi, South, Lenante,
Eaſt, Ponente, Weſt, Griego, Northeaſt, Garbino, Southweſt,
Maiſtro, Northweſt, Syroccho, Southeaſt, which names are
often vſed by Chriſtopher Columbus, Albertus Veſputius,
and others that ſayled firſt into the Eaſt and weſt Indies, and if
you will know the names of the 12. windes vſed by the auncient
Greekes and Romaines, then behold this figure here following,
wherein you ſhal find them ſet downe in Engliſh, Gréeke, and Latine,
that is to ſay, the Engliſh names without the Circle, and the
Greeke and Latine names within the Circle, the Greeke vppon
the right ſide of euery line pointing the winde, and the Latine
name vpon the left ſide of euery ſuch line.

Chap. 29.
                     
                        THe North wind called Septentrio or Aparctias
is extremely colde and dry, prohibiting raine, it
preſerueth health by clenſing the Aire of all peſtiferous
infections, but it cauſeth drie coldes,
and hurteth the fruites and floures of the earth.
                     2 The Northeaſt and by North, called Aquilo
or Boreas, is alſo colde and dry without raine, it hurteth the
flowres and fruites of the earth, and ſpecially the Vines when
they bud.
                     3 The Northeaſt and by Eaſt, called Heliſpontus or Caecias,
is hotte drying vp all things.
                     4 The Eaſt winde called Subſolanus, is hotte and dry, temperate,
ſwéete, pure, ſubtill, and healthfull, and ſpecially in the morning
when the ſunne riſeth, by whom he is made more pure and
ſubtill, cauſing no infection to mans bodie.
                     5 The Eaſt Southeaſt, called Eurus or Vulturnus, is alſo
hotte and dry, he bloweth lowde, and therefore is called of Lucretius,
Altitonans vulturnus.
                     
                     6 The Southeaſt and by South called Euroauſter or Euronotus,
is hotte and moyſt, and bréedeth clouds and ſicknes.
                     7 The South wind called Auſter or Notus, is hotte and moiſt
bréeding thicke cloudes, great raines, and peſtiferous aire.
                     8 The Southweſt and by South, called Auſtro aphricus, is
temperately hotte, & yet bréedeth ſickens & raine as ſome write.
                     9 The Southweſt and by Weſt named Aphricus or Libs, is
cold and moyſt cauſing raine.
                     10 The Weſt winde called Fauonius or Zephirus is temperately
hotte and moyſt, and wholſome in the Euening, it diſſolueth
froſt, yce, and ſnow, and maketh flowres and graſſe to ſpring,
and ſome write that it cauſeth Thunder.
                     11 The Weſt Northweſt, called Corus or Syrus, is cold and
moyſt without any great rigour.
                     12 The Northweſt and by North called Syrus or Trachias is
cold and dry of earthly nature, bréeding ſnow and windes.

                        BVt the Mariners of theſe our latter daies, to be
the better aſſured of their routes and courſes on the
ſea, do deuide euery quarter of the Horizon into 8.
ſeuerall windes, ſo as they make in all 32. windes,
which of the Spaniards are called Rombes, which
win des together with their names, you may ſée plainely ſet foorth
in this figure following repreſenting the Mariners Compaſſe.

And note that eight of theſe windes are called principall
windes, that is North, South, Eaſt, Weſt, Northeaſt, Southweſt,
Northweſt, and Southeaſt, and all the reſt are called Collaterall
windes, but the firſt foure are chiefeſt, from whence the
names of all the reſt are deriued, neither doe the learned Pilots
in their Tables, call the firſt foure windes, Rombes, but will ſay
the firſt, ſecond or third Rombe from North, from Eaſt, South,
or Weſt, vnto the number of ſeuen, for ſo many Rombes they
make in euery quarter betwixt the foure chiefe and principall
windes, of which matter I ſhall ſpeake hereafter in my treatiſe
of Nauigation. In the meane time I heartily pray all thoſe that
ſhall vouchſafe to reade this my treatiſe of the Spheare, to take
my labour therein beſtowed in good part, and where any fault is,
friendly to correct the ſame without any ſkorne or diſdaine.

                  A plaine deſcription of the two globes
of Mercator, that is to ſay, of the Terreſtriall Globe,
and of the Celeſtiall Globe, and of either of them,
together with the moſt neceſſary vſes thereof,
and firſt of the Terreſtriall Globe,
written by M. Blundeuill.
                  
                     THe Terreſtriall Globe is a round body couered
with an vniuerſall Map containing
both ſea and land, which is deuided by the
later Coſmographers into foure principall
parts, that is, Europe, Affrique, Aſia,
and America, the Longitude and Latitude
of euery which part is alreadie ſet
down in my deſcription of vniuerſal Maps
and Cards. And in this Globe are alſo ſet downe certaine ſtars,
ſome towards either of the poles, & ſome nigh to the Ecliptique
line, whereof we ſhall ſpeake hereafter when we come to treate of
the Celeſtiall Globe. But you haue to vnderſtand that the one end
of this Globe is called the pole Arctique, that is to ſay, the North
pole, and the other ende the pole Antarctique, that is to ſay, the
South pole: vpon which two poles it is turned about. And this
Globe is traced with certaine circular lines, whereof ſome be
greater and ſome leſſer, thoſe greater which paſſe through both
the poles, are called Meridians of this word Meridies, which is
as much to ſay as noonetide, for when the Sunne toucheth anie of
thoſe Circles, it is noonetide to all thoſe that dwell right vnder
that Circle, of which Meridians though you may imagine to bée
halfe ſo many as there be degrées in the Equinoctiall, which amounteth
to the number of 180. yet there are ſet downe in this
Globe no more but twelue which doe cut the Equinoctiall in 24.
points, making thereby 24. ſpaces, euery ſpace containing 15.

degrées of the Equinoctiall, which fiftéene degrées doe make
one houre, for the Equinoctiall is a great Circle which guirding
the Globe in the very middeſt betwixt the two Poles, and
repreſenting the motion of the firſt mooueable, maketh his daily
reuolution from Eaſt to Weſt in foure and twentie houres.
And this great Circle by deuiding the Globe into two equall
parts, cauſeth the ſame to haue two Latitudes or breadthes, the
one Northerne and the other Southerne, for that ſpace of the
halfe Globe which lyeth betwixt the Equinoctiall and the North
pole, is called the North Latitude, and the other halfe of the
Globe which lyeth betwixt the Equinoctiall and the South pole,
is called the South Latitude, ech Latitude contayning euerie
where from the Equinoctiall to either of the Poles nintie degrées.
Againe this Circle is deuided into 360. degrées containing
the whole Longitude of the earth, and euery degrée is 60.
Italian miles, which being multiplied into 360. maketh in all
21600. miles, and ſuch Longitude is to be counted from Weſt
to Eaſt, beginning the ſame at the firſt Meridian which paſſeth
through the Iles of Canaria, otherwiſe called Inſulae fortunatae,
croſſing the Equinoctiall and the Ecliptique line, in the firſt degrée
of Aries, and alſo in the firſt degrée of Libra, which are the
two Equinoctiall points, ſo as the one halfe of the Equinoctiall
which goeth from Weſt to Eaſt, containeth 180. degrées,
and the other halfe returning againe from Eaſt to Weſt contayneth
alſo 180. degrées, which maketh in all 360. degrées, ending
where the firſt degrée of Longitude did beginne: For
though Mercator and others in their ſeuerall Mappes doe in
theſe dayes make the firſt Meridian to paſſe through the Iles
Azores which are fiue degrées more to the Weſt. Yet Mercator
in his great Terreſtriall Globe dedicated firſt to the Lorde
Granuella, and afterwardes to the Emperour Charles the fift,
Anno Dom. 1541. placeth the firſt Meridian as before is ſaid,
both whoſe Globes my Worſhipfull friend Sir Thomas Knyuet
of Aſhwelthorpe Knight, did courteouſly lend me I thanke
him, who as he is very well learned in all the liberall Sciences
himſelfe, ſo is hee a great fauourer and furtherer of all
ſuch as delight in any learned or vertuous exerciſe: And by
helpe of thoſe Globes I wrote this Treatiſe. But to returne

to my matter, there is another great ſlooping and ouerthwart
Circle, called the Ecliptique line, vnder which the Sunne
continually walketh, and this line is marked with the Characters
of the twelue ſignes, euery ſigne containing in length
thirtie ſuch degrées as the Equinoctiall hath, ſo as in all, the
Ecliptique line containeth 360. degrées, which is the Longitude
of heauen, and the firſt degree of the Longitude of anie
ſtarre beginneth at the firſt point of Aries, and endeth at the
ſame point. Nowe of the leſſer Circles there be foure principall,
that is, the two Tropiques, that is to ſay, the Tropique
of Cancer towardes the North pole, and the Tropique of Capricorne
towardes the South pole, betwixt which two Tropiques,
the Sunne continually goeth right vnder the foreſaide
Ecliptique line, neuer mounting higher then the Tropique
of Cancer, nor deſcending lower then the Tropique of
Capricorne. Of the other two leſſer Circles, the one is called
the Circle Arctique enuironing the North Pole, and the
other the Circle Antarctique enuironing the South Pole: all
which foure Circles are called Parallels, that is to ſaye, equally
diſtant one from another, and by reaſon of theſe foure
Circles, the Globe is deuided into fiue Zones, that is to ſay,
two colde Zones, two temperate, and one extremely hotte: of
the cold Zones, the one lyeth betwixt the Circle Antarctique,
and the South pole, and the other betwixt the Circle Arctique
and the North pole.
                  And of the temperate Zones, the one lyeth betwixt the
Tropique of Cancer and the Circle Arctique, and the other
lyeth betwixt the Tropique of Capricorne and the Circle
Antarctique. The hotte Zone is that which lyeth betwixt the
two Tropiques, through the middeſt of which Zone paſſeth
the foreſayde Equinoctiall line, right vnder which, they that
dwell, haue no Latitude at all, and therefore their dayes and
nightes are alwayes equall, (that is to ſaye) twelue howres
day, and twelue houres night. Alſo beſides theſe foure foreſayde
leſſer Circles or Parallels, the Globe is traced with
eight other Parallel Circles on each ſide of the Equinoctiall
towards eyther of the Poles, making on each ſide nine equall
ſpaces, euery ſpace contayning tenne degrees of the

Equinoctiall, ſo as they doe make in all 90. degrées, which is a
quarter of the great Circle. Moreouer there be certaine Mariners
Compaſſes deuided into 32. circular lines, ſignifying the
32. winds, whereby Marmers doe ſaile, and do direct their ſhips
from port to port, which lines doe diuerſely croſſe the other Circles
before rehearſed. Beſides theſe circular lines before deſcribed,
there is faſtned vnto the two poles of the Globe, a Meridian
of braſſe cōmonly called the mooueable Meridian within the which
the Globe turneth about, & this Meridian is deuided into foure
quarters euery quarter containing 90. degrées, ſo as the whole
circuit thereof is 360. degrées, one of which quarters towardes
the North pole is deuided with circular lines into thrée ſeuerall
ſpaces, in the firſt and loweſt whereof being next to the
bodie of the Globe, are ſet downe the numbers of degrées of Latitude.
In the next ſpace aboue that, are grauen the Parallels
and numbers of houres of the longeſt day in euery Latitude, and
the ſpaces of euery houre are deuided with little ſtréeks into foure
parts, ſignifying the foure quarters of an houre: and theſe houres
doe encreaſe till you come to 24. houres, and from thence the day
incereaſeth by monethes, from one to ſixe, ouer which is grauen
this Latine word Menſes, (that is to ſay) monethes, and the third
and vppermoſt ſpace containeth the Climes, beginning at one,
and ſo procéedeth to 8. The like Climes, Parallels, and houres
of the longeſt day, are to be accounted, alſo in the ſaid Brazen meridian
procéeding from the Equinoctial towards the South pole,
though they be not there ſet downe. And vpon this Brazen meridian
is placed at the North pole another little brazen Circle, together
with his Index called the houre whéele, euery halfe wherof
containeth twelue houres, the Index of which whéele being ſet
vppon the North pole turneth about as the Globe turneth, and
yet you muſt imagine the Pole it ſelfe to be immooueable. Alſo
there is a quarter Circle of thinne braſſe plate, deuided into 90.
degrées faſtened in ſuch ſort vppon the brazen Meridian, as you
may remooue it too and fro, yea and alſo take it cleane off if you
will, which quarter Circle hath a ſquare head of braſſe, ſignifying
the Zenith or verticall point of any place, and this Circle is called
the quarter of altitude, which quarter is deuided into 90. degrées,
procéeding from the Horizon vpward to the Zenith, wherby

may be deſcribed vpon the Globe the 90. Almicanterathes or
Circles of Altitude. And this quarter ſerueth for diuerſe purpoſes,
as to finde out thereby the Altitude of any ſtarre or point of
the Ecliptique line, or of any other point in heauen, and the very
edge thereof on the right hand, ſheweth the Azimuth or verticall
Circle of any place, and in what coaſt and part of heauen any ſtar
is. Alſo how any place of the earth beareth one from another as
you ſhall more plainely perceiue hereafter by the examples of certaine
propoſitions thereto belonging. Then there is another
Circle of braſſe plate ſomewhat thicker called the ſemi-Circle of
poſition, which ſerueth chiefely for matters of Aſtronomie, as to
finde out the twelue houſes of heauen, and is to be faſtned on the
Horizon, ſo as it may be remooued and ſet vpon which ſide of the
Globe you will. Alſo there belongeth to the Globe a little round
ſquire of braſſe, made with right Sphericall Angles, the head
or ſtile whereof is to ſhewe the ſhadowe of the Sunne being ſet
vpon the Globe, in ſtead whereof a néedle being ſet right vp, will
ſometimes ſerue the turne. Finally to the Globe belongeth another
Circle called the Horizon, which is a broad Circle of wood,
hauing a foote of wood, within which Horizon, the Globe together
with the brazen Meridian is to be ſet at what Altitude you liſt.
And this Horizon is deuided with diuers circular lines into ſeuen
vnequall ſpaces, whereof the firſt and narroweſt ſpace next vnto
the bodie of the Globe, containeth the degrées of the 12. ſignes of
the Zodiaque, euery ſigne containing 30. degrées. The ſeconde
ſpace containeth the Characters and names of the ſaid ſigns, and
alſo the number of the degrées, as 10. 20. 30. The third the daies
of euery moneth. The fourth the names of euery moneth, and of
certaine Feſtiuall daies. The fift, the names of the 12. windes,
which the ancient Gréekes and Romaines were woont to obſerue,
whereof I haue alreadie ſpoken in my Spheare. The ſixth and
ſeuenth do ſhew the 12. houſes, together with their ſignifications
neceſſarie for the ſetting of figures and calculating of natiuities,
and in the foote of the ſaid Horizon is a little Compaſſe with a néedle
to ſhew the North and South, according to which the Globe
is to be placed. But yet not before the ſaid néedle be truely rectified,
according to the variation which it hath in that place where
you are to vſe the Globe: for otherwiſe the néedle may cauſe great

error, whereof we ſhall treate in the next Chapter. Thus hauing
briefely deſcribed the Terreſtriall Globe, and all the parts therof,
I thinke it good now to ſhew you how to place the Globe according
to the foure quarters of the world.

The firſt Propoſition.
                  
                     FIrſt in bedding your Globe together with the brazen
Meridian into the 2. nickes of the Horizon and
alſo into the ſlit of the pinne which ſtandeth in the
middeſt of the foot, ſo that the North pole of your
Globe be anſwerable to the North quarter or north
wind of the world, deſcribed vpon the Horizon, and ſée that that
part of the brazen Meridian, wherein are deſcribed the Climes,
Parallels & houres of the longeſt day, may ſtand aboue the Horizon,

and alſo that the one halfe of the brazen Meridian may iuſtlie
and euenlie appeare aboue the Horizon, and the other halfe vnder
the Horizon: Againe, you muſt ſée that the Equinoctiall
line of the Globe doe méete iuſt with the middle point or ſtréeke of
the brazen Meridian whereas the firſt degrée of latitude doth
beginne, and alſo that the body of the globe doe not leane to the
one ſide of the Horizon more than to the other, but to bee equally
diſtant from the ſame in all places, and in any wiſe to ſée that
the Horizon ſtande alwaies leuell, to which ende ſome Globes
haue a plummet of leade hanging by a little chaine or thréede,
which becauſe it will mooue with euery winde, I for my part do
think it better for you to haue ſuch a little
leuell made of purpoſe, as you may
ſet the ſame vpon anie place of the Horizon
wher you liſt, and therby make the
Horizon to ſtand leuel on euerie ſide as
you will your ſelf, and it may be made of
a little péece of thicke boorde, like a Triangle,
thus.
                  
                  Then with your 2. handes laying holde of the 2. next pillers,
turne the foot of the Globe vntil it ſtand right North and South,
which is to be done thus. Firſt find out the true Meridian of the
place whereas you are to vſe the Globe by ſuch meanes as M.
Burrough teacheth in his diſcourſe of the variation of the Compaſſe,
the 7. chapter. which vndoubtedlie is a moſt certaine
way, by which you ſhall finde thrée thinges at one inſtant, that
is, the true Meridian, the variation of the néedle, and the true
latitude of any place. But if you haue not the inſtrument of variation,
by helpe whereof this matter is to bée accompliſhed, then
in ſome open place betwixt 8. and 9. of the clocke in the forenoon
or ſooner, vpon a ſmooth table or plancke, ſtanding leuell, draw
a good large circle with your Compaſſes, in the Center whereof
muſt be fixed a round and ſtraight pinne of Iron or Latton
wyer, in length a good deal ſhorter than the ſemidiameter of that
circle, and to the intent that the pinne or ſtile may ſtande right
vp, without inclining on either ſide, it would be rectified by a
true Squire: That done, waite diligently vntill the ſhadow of
the pinne head doe iuſtlie touch the circumference of the circle, ſo

as it neyther paſſe beyond the circle, nor come ſhort of the ſame,
and there make a pricke, and ſo let it ſtay vntill about thrée of the
clocke in the afternoone, about which time the ſhaddow of the pin
will beginne to approch nigh vnto the ſayd circle, and ſo ſoone as
it toucheth the ſame, make there another prick: that done, diuide
the Ark or portion of the circle, contained betwixt thoſe 2. pricks
into two equall parts, and in the middeſt therof ſet another prick,
them laying your ruler to the middle pricke, and to the Center
of the circle, draw a right line through the Center & alſo through
the middle pricke from the one ſide of the circle to the other, and
beyond if you liſt: for you may make the ſaid line of ſuch length
as you ſhall thinke moſt méete to ſerue your turne, and that line
ſhall bee the true Meridian for that place, ſhewing the right
North and South part of your Horizon, and by croſſing the
ſaid liue with another right line in the very middeſt with right
angles, you ſhall haue the true Eaſt and Weſt, and to auoyd long
wayting, you may draw diuerſe circles one within another. Thus
hauing found the true North and South, Eaſt, and Weſt,
place your Globe accordingly, ſo as the brazen Meridian of
the Globe may aunſwere the Meridian line alreadie drawne
vpon the boorde or plancke, and to the intent that afterwarde
you may knowe at all times both day and night, howe to place
your Globe right North and South, it ſhall bée neceſſarie to
drawe a right line vpon the foote of the Horizon, anſwerable
to the foreſaid Meridian firſt drawne vpon the boord or planck,
and vponthat line to faſten a pretie handſome Compaſſe, hauing
a needle of an inch long at the leaſt, which is much more certaine,
than ſuch a little néedle as is woont to bee ſet in the foote of
euerie Globe: And when the néedle ſtandeth ſtill, marke how
much the North point thereof declineth eyther Eaſt or Weſt
from the true Meridian before faſtned, and whereas you ſee the
Needle to decline, bee it Eaſt or Weſt, there ſet faſt a little
pinne of Latton to ſerue as a marke, whereto you may alwayes
direct the North point of the needle when you would haue
the Globe to ſtand right North and South, for there is no needle
touched with the load ſtone, bee it neuer ſo good a ſtone, but it
wil vary from the true Meridian line, either more or leſſe, & therefore
no truſt is to be giuen to the néedle vntil you know the true

variation therof, the finding of which variation, as I ſaid before,
is moſt trulie taught by M. Borough in his book before mentioned,
wherunto I once againe refer you, and the rather for that it
is written in our mother tongue. But Gemma Friſius teacheth
to ſet the Globe right North and South thus, firſt goe into an
open place whereas the Sunne ſhineth, and vpon ſome table
ſtanding leuel, and alſo the Globe ſtanding leuell, the Pole being
eleuated aboue the Horizon according to your latitude, fixe a
right néedle in the degrée of the ſigne, wherein the Sunne is that
day ſo as the nédle may ſtande right vp without inclining anie
maner of way, and if it be in the forenoone, turne the Eaſt ſide of
the Globe towardes the Sunne, moouing both the Globe and
his ſeat to and fro, vntill you ſée the néedle to caſt no ſhaddow
at all, for ſo ſhall the Globe ſtand right North and South. But
if it bee in the afternoone, you muſt turne the Weſt ſide of the
Globe towards the Sun, and then worke as before, and by anie
of theſe wayes before taught you ſhall not onely place the Globe
anſwerable to the foure quarters of the world, but alſo you ſhall
find that the Circles, Poles, and Axletrées of the Globe, are anſwerable
to the Circles, Poles and Axletrees of the heauens.
Now hauing placed your Globe anſwerable to the 4. quarters
of the world, learne to know by ſome Table or moderne Map, or
els by ſuch wayes as are ſet downe both in my Spheare, and alſo
in the latter ende of this Treatiſe, the latitude of the region
wherein you dwell: As for example, the latitude of theſe partes
here about Norwich is 52. degrées, then taking holde of the brazen
Meridian aſwell with your left hand aboue the Horizon, as
with your right hand beneath the Horizon, turne the ſame vp and
downe in the nickes of the Horizon, vntill the North pole bee eleuated
aboue the Horizon 52. degrées, the laſt of which degrées
muſt méete euen with the vpper brimme of the Horizon, that
done, ſéeke for England in the Globe, not leauing to turne the bodie
of the Globe to and fro vntil you haue brought that Meridian
which paſſeth through England right vnder the brazen Meridian,
and holding it ſtil at that ſtay, drawe the head of the brazen
quarter of altitude right ouer the place, and ouer that Meridian
vnder which you dwell, ſo ſhall the head of your brazen quarter
ſtande for your Zenith in the verie middeſt of the Horizon

and kéeping al things thus at a ſtay, you may ſée how euery region
or countrey is ſituated, and how it beareth from you, and which
be vnder your Climate and which be not, and to be ſure that the
brazen Zenith may ſtand in his right place, it ſhall be néedfull to
ſet it ſo as the left ſquare ſide therof made with a long notch may
touch the ſelfe ſame degrée of latitude in the brazen Meridian,
which it hath of altitude, for looke how many degrées the Pole is
eleuated aboue the Horizon, which is called the altitude, ſo many
degrées muſt the brazen Zenith be diſtant from the Equinoctial
of the globe, which is called the latitude, and is euer all one with
the altitude of the Pole. Thus hauing ſhewed you howe to place
the Globe according to the foure quarters of the world, I thinke
good now to declare vnto you, firſt the vſes of the terreſtriall
globe, whereof ſome are common alſo to the celeſtiall globe, as
you ſhall perceiue hereafter by the propoſitions following, which
propoſitions may be very well diuided into 3. ſorts, whereof the
firſt do properly belong to the deſcription of the vniuerſall Map,
wherewith the terreſtriall globe is couered, which are but few in
number. The ſecond kind of propoſitions do chiefly belong to the
Sunne, and to his apparances, which are alſo common to the celeſtial
globe, and may be found out by either of the globes. But
the third kind do belong moſt properly to the fixed ſtarres and to
their apparances, and therefore I mind not to ſet downe them vntill
I come to deſcribe the celeſtiall globe, and to ſhewe the vſes
thereof.
                  The chiefeſt propoſitions belonging to the vniuerſall Map,
wherewith the terreſtriall Globe is couered, are theſe following.
               
               
                  To know vnder what Clime any place or region is, and of
how many houres the longeſt day is there, and alſo what latitude
any place deſcribed in the map hath.
The 2. Propoſition.
                  
                     HAuing ſet the Globe at your latitude, bring the place
or region which you ſéek right vnder the brazen Meridian,
and the vpper ſpace of the ſaid Meridian will
ſhew the Clime. And the ſecond or middle ſpace will
ſhewe the houres of the longeſt day. And the thirde
ſpace the latitude: As for example, if you would knowe vnder

what Clime London is, then hauing found London, fixe a long
néedle in the red ſpot next to the name of London (for all townes
for the moſt parte in the Globe are marked with red ſpottes)
that done, turne the Globe with your hand vntill the néedle do
touch the brazen Meridian, and by ſtaying the Globe there
with your hand, you ſhall find London to be vnder the 8. Clime,
and that the longeſt day in the yeare is there 16. houres and 20.
minutes, and the third and nethermoſt ſpace doth ſhew the latitude
of the place, which is 51. degrées, 32′· Againe, by obſeruing
this order without changing your latitude, you ſhall finde
Venice to be vnder the 6. Clime, and their longeſt day to be
15. houres and ſomewhat more, and the latitude of that Cittie
to bee 44. degrées, 30′· And you ſhall finde Ieruſalem to be
vnder the third Clime, and the longeſt day there to be 14. houres,
and the latitude thereof to be 31. degrées. 30′·
               
               
                  How to know what longitude anie place deſcribed in the
Map hath.
Propoſition. 3.
                  
                     THe Globe ſtanding ſtill at your owne latitude,
pricke the néedle in the place whereof
you ſéeke the longitude, and bring it as
before, to the brazen Meridian, and ſtaying
it there, looke at what number of degrées
the brazen Meridian cutteth the Equinoctiall,
and that is the longitude of
the place, counting the degrées from the
firſt degrée of the Equinoctiall, which beginneth at the firſt
point of Aries vnto the place of the ſection: by doing thus, you
ſhall finde the longitude of London to bée 19. degrées, and the
longitude of Venice to be 36. degrées, and the longitude of
Ieruſalem to be 67. degrées and 30. minutes.
               
               
                  How to know the diſtance betwixt any two places deſcribed
in the Map.
Propoſition. 4.
                  
                     
                     OPen your Compaſſes ſo wide as you may ſet the
one foote thereof iuſt in the one place, and the other
foote in the other place, and applie that wydeneſſe
to the Equinoctiall line, counting how many degrees
of the Equinoctiall are contained betwixt the two féete of
your compaſſes, & by allowing to euery degrée 60. miles, you ſhall
haue the true diſtance of the places. Thus you ſhall finde the diſtance
betwixt London and Venice to be 13. degrées, 30′· which
being multiplied by 60. maketh 810. miles, and the diſtance betwixt
London and Ieruſalem to be 40. degrées. 30′· which being
multiplied by 60. maketh 2430. miles. And it maketh no matter
to what part ſoeuer of the Equinoctial you do apply the widenes
of your cōpaſſes, ſo as you ſet the firſt foot at the very beginning
of ſome one degrée, and let the other foot fall out as it will, either
at a whole degrée at a half, or at a quarter of a degrée, which ſmal
partes are to bee counted by minutes by coniecturall diſcretion.
And note here that no 2. places can bee diſtant one from another
Eaſt and Weſt more than 180. degrées which is iuſt the one half
the circuit of the Earth, beyond which half or on this ſide thereof
the places muſt néeds be néerer together by means of the roundneſſe
of the Earth, and if either of the 2. places wherof you would
know the diſtance be not expreſſed in the Globe, then learne to
find out the longitude and latitude thereof by ſome table, whereof
the firſt meridian is ſuppoſed to paſſe through the Ilands of Canariae
and mark vpon the Globe where the ſaid longitude and latitude
do croſſe, for there ought that place to ſtand which is miſſing,
to which place direct the one foot of your compaſſes & then
worke as before is taught. And by this means you may alſo know
the diſtance betwixt any two ſtarres contained in the Globe.
               
               
                  To know how one place beareth from another.
Propoſition. 5.
                  
                     THough you may partly finde out this by marking the
direction of the lines, procéeding from the marriners
Compaſſe ſet downe in the Globe: yet in mine opinion
it is readier to do it by applying the Flie deſcribed
in my little treatiſe of vniuerſal Maps, vnto the Globe by ſetting

the center thereof vpon the firſt place from whence you goe, and
by drawing a thred through that place whereto you would goe,
in ſuch order as is there taught, ſo you ſhall finde Venice to
beare from London South Eaſt and by Eaſt, and Ieruſalem to
beare from London Eaſt, South Eaſt, and two quarters more
towards the South. But Gemma Friſius teacheth to knowe by
the Globe how one place beareth from another thus, hauing ſet
the Globe and alſo the Zenith of the quarter of altitude at ſuch
latitude as the firſt place or region hath, from whence you would
goe, bring that firſt place vnder the brazen Meridian, and there
ſtay the Globe vntil you haue brought the quarter of altitude to
the ſecond place, and the nether end of the quarter of altitude will
ſhew you vpon the Horizon amongſt the windes how the ſecond
place beareth from the firſt, ſo ſhall you find Hiſpaniola to beare
from Spaine right Weſt, theſe be the chiefeſt propoſitions belonging
to the vniuerſall Map, wherewith the terreſtrial Globe is
c
                        •
                     uered, and therefore I will now ſet downe thoſe that belong to
the Sun, which may be done aſwell by the one Globe as by the
other, and firſt how to find out the place of the Sunne.
               
               
                  How to find out by the Globe the place of the Sunne, that
is to ſay, the degree and minute of that figne wherein the Sun
is euery day throughout the yeare.
Propoſition. 6.
                  
                     THough the ſureſt way be to find it out by the Ephemerides,
which ſheweth the verie minute, yet
without hauing reſpect to the minutes, you may
find it out by the Globe thus, ſéeke out the day of
the moneth vpon the Horizon, and that will point
you to ye degrée of the ſigne wherin the ſun is that
that day: As for example, the 6. day of May pointeth right to the
25. degrée of Taurus the Globe ſtanding leuel, and your rule being
rightly laid vpon the Horizon, but during the leape yeare you
muſt adde one degrée more than the Horizon ſheweth euery day
from the beginning of the leape yeare throughout al that yeare.
               
               
                  
                  How to rectifie the Index of the houre wheele for euerie
ſeuerall day throughout the yeare.
Propoſition. 7.
                  
                     HAuing placed the Globe at your latitude
and alſo found out the degrée of the Sun,
as is before taught, bring that degrée of
the Sunne to the brazen Meridian, and
there ſtaying it with the one hand, turne
with your other hande the index of the
houre whéele to the higheſt part of the
ſaid whéele, marked with the number of
12. ſetting the point of the index iuſt with
the ſtréeke of the whéele made to ſhew the houre of 12. or neonetyde,
and that will ſerue your turne for al that day, and thus muſt
you doe euery day in which you haue to vſe the helpe of the ſaid
houre whéele for any purpoſe.
               
               
                  How to knowe euery day at what houre the Sunne rifeth
or ſetteth.
Propoſition. 8.
                  
                     HAuing ſet the Globe at your latitude, and rectified
the index of the houre whéele by the 7. propoſition,
turne the Globe to the Eaſt, ſo as the degrée of
the Sun may touch the Horizon, and then the index
of the houre whéele will ſhew you at what houre
the Sunne riſeth. Againe, if you bring the ſaide degrée of the
Sunne vnto the Weſt part of the Horizon, the index of the houre
whéele will ſhew you at what houre he goeth downe. As for example,
Anno 1590. the third of Iune, the Sun being in the 21. degrée
33′· of Gemini. I bring that point to the verie edge of the
Horizon on the Eaſt part thereof, and there ſtaying it, the index
of the houre whéele ſheweth that the Sunne riſeth 8′· before 4.
of the clocke in the morning: and the ſaid point of the Ecliptique
being turned to the Weſt part of the Horizon, the index ſheweth
that he ſetteth 8′· after 8. of the clocke at night.
               
               
                  
                  How to know in what part of the Horizon the Sunne riſeth
and ſetteth euerie day.
Propoſition. 9.
                  
                     SEeke the degrée of the Sun in the Ecliptique
liue, & turn it to the Eaſt part of the
Horizon, then you ſhal ſée whether it riſeth
iuſt Eaſt or not, and whether it inclineth
towards the South, or towards the north,
and likewiſe by bringing the ſaide degrée
to the Weſt part of the Horizon, you ſhall
ſée in what part of the ſaid Horizon he goeth
downe: As for example, in the laſt propoſition
the Sunne being in the 21. degrée, 33′· of Gemini,
and brought to the Eaſt part of the Horizon, I finde that the
Sunne did riſe diſtant from the Eaſt towards the North 38.
degrées, 30′· of the Horizon, which is thrée points and ſomewhat
more of the Marriners Compaſſe from Eaſt, towardes
the North, ſo as the Sunne riſeth Northeaſt and by Eaſt, and
a little more Northward, and the ſaid place of the Sunne being
brought to the Weſt part of the Horizon, I find that hee ſetteth
North Weſt and by Weſt, and ſomewhat more Northward.
               
               
                  How to know the length of euery day and night throughout
the yeare, aſwell by help of the houre wheele as by counting
the degrees vpon the Horizon.
Propoſition. 10.
                  
                     FIrſt you muſt know when the Sunne riſeth
and ſetteth by the 8. propoſition, then
looke how many houres the index doth go
from the Sun riſing to the Sun ſetting,
and that is the length of the day, which
number if you take from 24. the night wil
appeare: as for example, knowing by the
8. propoſition, that the Sun being in the
21. degrée, 33′· of Gemini, riſeth 8′· before 4. in the morning, and
goeth downe 8′· after 8. of the clocke at night, I find by counting

the houres which the index of the houre whéele hath run, that the
length of the day is 16. houres and 16′· which you may know alſo
by counting the degrées vpon the Horizon from the place of
the Suns riſing, vnto the South point of the ſaid Horizon, which
you ſhall find to be 128. degrées, which being doubled maketh
256. degrées, which if you diuide by 15. it will make 16. houres
and 16′· as before.
               
               
                  How to know by the Globe how much the Sun declineth
euery day throughout the yeare from the Equinoctiall.
Propoſition. 11.
                  
                     HAuing found the place of the Sunne, bring the ſame
to the brazen Meridian, and by counting how manie
degrées are betwixt that place and the Equinoctiall,
you ſhall know what declination the Sun hath that
day: As for example, ſuppoſing the Sunne that day
you ſéek to be in the firſt degree of Gemini, bring the ſaid degree
of the Ecliptique to the brazen Meridian, and you ſhall find vpon
the ſame Meridian the Sun to be declined from the Equinoctiall
Northward almoſt 20. degrees. Againe, ſuppoſing the Sun
to be in the firſt degree of Aquarius, if you bring the ſame degree
of the Ecliptique vnto the Meridian, you ſhal finde the declination
of the Sun to be almoſt 20. degrees Southward.
               
               
                  How to know by the Globe the Meridian altitude of the
Sun, that is to ſay, his height at noontyde euery day throughout
the year, and how far he is then diſtant from your Zenith.
Propoſition. 12.
                  
                     BRing the place of the Sun that day you ſeeke to the
brazen Meridian, and ſtaying it there, count vpon the
ſaid brazen Meridian how many degrees are contained
betwixt the place of the Sun and the South point
of the Horizon, and that is the Meridian altitude of the Sun for
that day, which if you ſubtract from 90. the remainder wil ſhew
how many degrees he is diſtant that day at noontide from your
Zenith: as for example, ſuppoſing the Sunne to be that day you
ſeeke in the firſt degree of Taurus, bring that degree of the Ecliptique
to the brazen Meridian, and ſtay it there vntil you haue

counted how many degrées of the ſaid Meridian are contained
betwixt the place of the Sunne, and the South point of the Horizon,
and you ſhall find the number of degrees to be 50. which
is the Meridian altitude of the Sunne for that day, which 50.
degrées being taken out of 90. there remaineth 40. and ſo many
degrées the Sun is that day at noontide diſtant from your Zenith.
The like order is to be obſerued in ſéeking to know the Meridian
altitude of any Starre, or any other point in heauen.
               
               
                  How to know the altitude of the Sunne at any other houre
of the day.
Propoſition. 13.
                  
                     HAuing rectified the index of the houre whéele by the
7. propoſition, if the houre which you ſéek be in the
forenoone, turne the Globe ſo as the index of the
houre whéele may touch that houre of the forenoone,
at which you deſire to knowe the altitude of
the Sun, and there ſtay the Globe, vntill you haue brought the
quarter of altitude on the Eaſtſide of the globe vnto the place of
the Sunne, ſo ſhall you find vpon the ſaid quarter the altitude of
the Sun at that houre. And if you deſire to know the altitude of
the Sunne at any houre in the afternoone, then turne the Globe
ſo as the index of the houre whéele may touch the houre of the
afternoone, and there ſtay the Globe vntill you haue brought the
quarter of altitude on the Weſt ſide of the Globe vnto the place
of the Sun, and the ſaid quarter will ſhew you the altitude of the
Sun at that houre. As for example, I would know how high the
Sun is at 8. of the clocke in the morning, the Sunne being in the
firſt degrée of Taurus: here hauing rectified the index of the houre
whéele, I turne the Globe ſo as the index of the houre whéele may
lie vpon the 8. houre of the forenoone, and there I ſtay the globe
vntill I haue brought the quarter of altitude on the Eaſt ſide of
the Globe vnto the place of the Sunne, whereby I finde the altitude
of the Sunne at that houre to be almoſt 28. degrées. Again,
if you wil know how high the Sunne is being in the ſame degrée
of the Ecliptique at 5. of the clocke in the afternoone, then turne
the index of the houre whéele, ſo as it may touch that houre, and
ſtay it there vntill you haue brought the quarter of altitude on

the Weſt ſide of the Globe vnto the place of the Sunne, ſo ſhall
you find the altitude of the Sun to be at that houre 21. degrées.
               
               
                  How to know the houre of the day by the Globe.
Propoſition. 14.
                  
                     THis is to be done two maner of wayes, the firſt
is thus, ſet the Globe in ſome open place whileſt
the Sunne ſhineth, and you muſt ſée that it ſtand
both leuell and alſo right North and South, as
is taught in the firſt propoſition, and that the index
of the houre whéele be rectified according to
the degrée of the ſigne wherein the Sunne is that day by the 7.
propoſition, that done, fixe a néedle in the place of the Sunne,
and turne the bodie of the Globe to and fro vntill the néedle caſt no
ſhaddow at all, and there ſtaying the Globe, the index of the houre
whéele will ſhew you the houre of the day. But if you ſéeke the
houre in the forenoone, remember to turne the Eaſt ſide of the
Globe towards the Sunne, if in the afternoone, then turne the
Weſt ſide of the Globe towards the Sunne. The ſecond way is
thus, hauing rectified the index of the houre whéele, take the altitude
of the Sun with ſome Quadrant or Aſtrolabe, and hauing
marked the ſame altitude vpon the quarter of altitude, applie
it to the degrée of the Sun on the Eaſt ſide of the Globe if it bée
in the forenoone: but if it be in the afternoone applie the quarter
of altitude to the degrée of the Sun on the Weſt ſide of the globe,
and the index of the houre wheele will ſhewe you the houre which
you ſéeke. As for example, the 6. of Iune 1590. the Sunne being
in the 24. degrée, 24′· of Gemini, I found by my Aſtrolabe the
altitude of the Sunne to be 48. degrées, which I marked vpon
the quarter of altitude, and becauſe I tooke the altitude of the
Sunne in the forenoone, I brought the quarter of altitude marked
with that degrée to the place of the Sunne on the Eaſt ſide of
the Globe, and there ſtaying the Globe I found that the index
of the houre whéele did point to the 9. houre of the forenoone
and ſomewhat paſt. The like is to be done to know any houre of
the afternoone, ſo as you forget not to apply the quarter of altitude
vnto the place of the Sunne on the Weſt ſide of the Globe.

And by taking the altitude of any knowne Starre, and working
in like manner as before, you ſhall know the houre of the north,
as ſhall bee taught hereafeer when wee come to treate of the
Starres.
               
               
                  To knowe how much the vnequall houres otherwiſe called
the planetarie houres do differ from the Artificial houres
throughout the yeare, and how many minutes euery vnequal
houre containeth.
Propoſition. 15.
                  
                     FIrſt you muſt knowe by the 10. propoſition the
length of the day, that is to ſay, how many houres
it is long, and reduce thoſe houres into minutes,
and diuide the product by 12. and the quotient,
together with the remainder (if there bee any left
after the diuiſion) will ſhewe you the quantitie of
the vnequall houre of the day, that is to ſay, howe many minutes
it contayneth: The like is to bee done to knowe the vnequall
houre of the night, for hauing the length of the artificiall
night, worke as before, and you ſhall haue your deſire: As for
example, knowing by the 10. propoſition the length of the day
when the Sunne is in the 21. degrée. 33′· of Gemini to bee 16.
houres 16′· here by reducing thoſe houres into minutes, and by
deuiding the product thereof by 12. you ſhall finde the vnequall
houre of the daye to containe 81. minutes. and ⅓ of a minute
or 20. ſeconds, which is more than one whole artificial houre
of the day by 21. minutes and 20. ſecondes. Againe, knowing
the length of the artificiall night by the ſaid propoſition to bée 7.
houres, 44. minutes, if you do reduce the ſame into minutes,
and diuide by 12. you ſhall finde thereby the vnequall houre of
the night to containe no more but 38. minutes, and 40. ſeconds,
which is leſſe than the artificiall houre of the day by 21. minutes,
and 40. ſeconds.
               
               
                  
                  How to know euery day when the dawning of the day and
the twilight of the night beginneth and endeth, and the time
of their continuance.
Propoſition. 11.
                  
                     HAuing rectified the index of the houre wheele by the
7. propoſition, firſt finde out the oppoſite point to
the degree of the Sunne, and turne the Globe together
with that oppoſite point, and alſo together with
the quarter of altitude towards the Weſt, ſo as the
oppoſite point may méete euen with the 18. degrée of the quarter
of altitude, and ſtaying the Globe there, the index of the
houre whéele will ſhew at what houre the dawning beginneth.
As for example, I would know at what houre the dawning of
the day beginneth the 19. of Aprill 1590. when as the Sunne
is in the 8. degree of Taurus, the oppoſite point whereof is
the 8. degree of Scorpio, wherefore I turne the Globe together
with the ſaide point oppoſite and alſo together with the
quarter of altitude towards the Weſt, ſo as the ſaid point oppoſite
may méete euen with the 18. degree of the quarter of
altitude, and there ſtaying the Globe, I finde by the index of
the houre whéele that the dawning of the day beginneth at 2. of
the clocke in the morning and 20. minutes after, which dawning
alwayes endeth when the Sunne riſeth, as in the former
example, the Sunne being in the 8. degrée of Taurus doth riſe
45. minutes after 4. of the clocke in the morning, ſo as the continuance
of the dawning is two houres and 25. minutes, for by
taking two houres and 20. minutes out of 4. houres and 45. minutes,
there remaineth 2. houres and 25 minutes. Againe, the
twilight beginneth when the Sun goeth downe, which in the former
example is at 7. of the clocke and 15′· Nowe to know when
the twilight endeth, you muſt doe thus, turne the Globe and the
quarter of altitude towardes the Eaſt, ſo as the oppoſite point,
which is the 8. degree of Scorpio may méete euen with the 18.
degrée of the ſaid quarter, and the index of the houre whéele will
ſhewe you that the twilight endeth at 9. of the clocke and 45′·
after, ſo as the continuance of the twilight is two houres, and 30′
for by taking 7. houres & 15′· out of 9. houres & 45′· there remaineth

2. houres and 30′· But you haue to vnderſtand, that the
dawning twilight is not alwaies to bee knowne throughout the
yeare by the Globe, for from the 11. day of May to the 10. of Iulie,
you ſhall find that the oppoſite point of the Sunne will not
agrée iuſt with the 18. degrée of the quarter of altitude: becauſe
that no oppoſite point during that time will amount to aboue 16
or 17 degrees of the quarter of altitude at the moſt, becauſe the
Meridian altitude it ſelfe of any ſuch oppoſite point is not aboue
17. degrees, for during all that time both dawning and twilight
had néed in this our latitude to be accounted as night, vnleſſe you
will make no night at all.
               
               
                  Howe to knowe the aſcention of the Sunne both right and
oblique.
Propoſition. 17.
                  
                     HAuing ſet the Globe at your latitude, bring the degree
of the Sunne to the brazen Meridian, and
there ſtaying it, marke at what number of degrées
the ſaid Meridian cutteth the Equinoctiall, counting
that number from the firſt point of the Vernall
Equinoctiall point to that ſection, and that is the right
aſcention, As for example, the Sunne being in the firſt degrée
of Gemini and brought to the Meridian, you ſhall finde that
the meridian cutteth the Equinoctiall in the 58. degrée thereof,
and that is his right aſcention. Now if you would knowe his
oblique aſcention, being in the firſt degree of Gemini, bring that
degree to the Eaſt part of the Horizon, ſo as it may touch the
vpper edge thereof, and ſtaying the Globe there, looke what
degree of the Equinoctiall toucheth the Horizon at that inſtant,
which you ſhall finde to bee the 30. degree of the Equinoctiall,
and that is his oblique aſcention. Theſe are the chiefeſt propoſitions
that belong to the Sunne, and are to be found by eyther of
the Globes, wherefore I will now proceed to thoſe propoſitions
that are to bee knowne moſt properlie by the celeſtiall Globe,
But firſt I will make a deſcription of the ſaide celeſtiall Globe,
whereby it ſhall plainelie appeare wherein the one Globe is like
the other, and wherein the one differeth from the other.
               
               
                  
                  The 18. Propoſition, contayning the deſcription of the
celeſtiall Globe, and ſhewing wherein it is like or differing
from the terreſtriall Globe.
Propoſition. 18.
                  
                     THe Celeſtial globe is like to the terreſtrial globe,
in that it is round, hauing both like Axletrées,
Poles, hourewhéele with his index, brazen Meridian,
quarter of altitude of braſſe or Latton with
his ſquare head or Zenith, and a halfe circle of
braſſe or Latton, called the ſemicircle of poſition,
alſo a ſtanding foot with an Horizon of wood diuided into ſeuen
ſeueral ſpaces, containing in a manner the ſelf ſame things
that are before deſcribed in the Horizon of the terreſtriall Globe,
alſo in the bodie of the celeſtiall globe are ſet downe certaine circles
like vnto the terreſtriall Globe, that is to ſay, the Equinoctiall
and the Ecliptique line. Moreouer the foure leſſer circles,
that is to ſay, the two tropiques, the circle Arctique, and the circle
antarctique. But the celeſtiall Globe differeth from the terreſtriall
Globe in theſe foure things following. Firſt the celeſtiall
Globe hath one thinne demicircle of braſſe or Latton more than
the terreſtriall Globe hath, which Demicircle is diuided into two
quarters, each quarter containing 90. degrées, made ſo at ech end
as it may be faſtened when néed is, vpon the 2. Poles of the Zodiaque,
to find thereby the longitude and latitude of euery Star
deſcribed in the Globe, and therefore may very well bee called the
Semicircle of longitude and latitude. The ſecond difference is
that whereas the terreſtrial Globe is traced with 12. Meridians,
diuiding the Equinoctial into 24. ſpaces, euery ſpace containing
15. degrées. The celeſtial Gobe is onely traced with 6. Meridians,
diuiding the Equinoctiall into 12. ſpaces, euery ſpace contayning
30. degrées. The thirde difference is that the celeſtiall
Globe hath not thoſe 8. Parallels of latitude wherewith the celeſtiall
Globe is traced. The fourth difference is that whereas
the terreſtriall Globe is couered with an vniuerſall Map contayning
the foure principal diuiſions of the earth, that is, Europa,
Africa, Aſia and America: the celeſtiall Globe is couered
with a Map, wherein are painted al the fixed Starres that were

knowne to the ancient Aſtronomers diuided into 48. Images,
with which Images, to the intent you might bee the better acquainted,
and that you might the more readily find out any Star
deſcribed in the Globe, I thought good to ſet downe a particular
deſcription of the ſaid 48. images as followeth.
               
               
                  The 19. Propoſition, containing a particular deſcription
of the 48. Images of the fixed Starres that are in the celeſtiall
Globe together with their ſundrie names and alſo the names
of ſo many ſtarres as are named in the Globe, of which 48. Images
21. are aſcribed to the North part of the firmament,
12. to the Zodiaque, and 15. to the South part of the firmament.
Propoſition. 19.
                  
                     THis deſcription is diuided into two parts according
to the twofold declination of the fixed ſtars,
that is to ſay, Northern and Southern, for thoſe
Stars are ſaid to haue North Declination, which
are ſituated betwixt the Equinoctiall and the
North pole, and thoſe to haue South declinatition
which are ſituated betwixt the Equinoctiall, and the
South pole, and becauſe that ſixe great Circles or Meridians,
paſſing through the poles of the world, doe deuide the Equinoctiall
into twelue equall ſpaces, euerie ſpace containing 30.
degrées, I will begin my deſcription at the firſt point of Aries,
which is the Uernal Equinoctiall point, and ſo procéed towards
the right hand round about the Globe, ſetting downe all ſuch Images,
or partes of Images as are ſituated towards the north
pole, and are contayned in euery ſeuerall ſpace betwixt two Meridians,
& hauing deſcribed al the north part, I wil vſe like order
in deſcribing the South part. And you may behold all the Northern
Images by turning the Globe about with your hand without
taking the ſame out of his bed or ſeat, the pole being eleuated
aboue the Horizon 50. or 60. degrées, but to view the Southerne
Images, it ſhall be néedfull to take the Globe cleane out of his
ſeat, and to hold it ſo as the north pole may ſtand right vp, ſo ſhal

you ſée euery Southern Image and Starre at your pleaſure.
And yet to know how the Starres are ſituated in heauen, you had
néed to imagine your ſelfe to bee within the Globe, in the verie
center thereof and not without the Globe for otherwiſe thoſe ſtars
that are ſituated in heauen on your right hand, if you haue regard
to the outſide of the Globe, will ſéeme to be on your left hand.
                  
                     The Northern Images contained in the firſt ſpace, intercepted
betwixt the firſt Meridian and the ſecond Meridian.

4. other images towards the ſouth Pole, as the croſſe or Croſier,
the ſouth triangle, Noahs doue or Pigion, & another image made
like a Philoſopher called Polophilax, all which are ſet downe in
the celeſtial Globe, lately ſet forth, firſt at the great charges of
M. Sanders, and now at the like charges of M. Molinax of Lambeth
of whome I lately bought both the Globes, that is, the terreſtriall
and celeſtiall, and I wiſh that the longitude, latitude and
declination of euery Star contained in the ſaid 4. images were
trulie ſet downe, for Plancius maketh ſome doubt thereof. Notwithſtanding
if you be deſirous to know the longitude, latitude,
and declination of the ſaid Starres by help of the foreſayd great
Globe, then you muſt worke as I doe ſhewe you hereafter in ſéeking
for any Starre contayned in Mercator his globe, ſo ſhall
you haue your deſire.

the Characters of ſome of the 7. Planets, to ſhew the nature
& qualitie of the Stars & ſome ſtars ar alſo marked with ſome one
letter or other, the more readily to find out therby the foreſaid characters,
As for example to Cor Leonis are annexed the Characters
of Iupiter and Venus, & vnder the ſayd Star is ſet the letter
m. to ſhew the Characters which are not alwayes ſet hard by
the Starre, but ſometime a good diſtance off, for where the characters
are ſet nigh vnto the ſtar, there néedeth no letter, as in the
Star called ſpica Virginis, whereunto are annexed the characters
of Mars and Venus, without any letter to ſignifie the ſame,

and where diuers Starres be of one ſelfe qualitie, they are ſeuerally
marked with letters of one ſelfe ſame ſhape, as about the
Starre Spica Virginis you ſhall finde diuers little Starres,
each one marked with the letter h. ſignifying their nature to bée
all one, that is, to participate of Mars and Venus, to whoſe characters
is alſo ioyned the letter h, ſignifying that they be of that
nature and quality.

                     A briefe deſcription of the milke white way, called in
Greeke Galaxia, and in Latine Via lactea.
                     THis way as Garceus writeth, procéedeth from the ſigne Gemini,
and ſo paſſeth through the legs and loynes of: Ericthonius,
and from thence through the right ſide of Perſeus, and then

in the Globe two manner of wayes, that is, either by the
helpe of ſome knowne ſtarre, or els by knowing the true houre
of the night.
Propoſition. 20.
                  
                     THe firſt and ſureſt way is thus, take with your Quadrant
or Aſtrolabe the altitude of the knowne Star,
marking therewith in what part of the heauen the
ſame is ſituated Eaſt or Weſt, North or South, and
then hauing ſet your Globe right North and South,
and at the true latitude of the place wher you are, bring the quarter
of altitude to the ſaid Starre, and therewith turne the Globe
vntill you ſée that the ſaid Starre hath the like place and the like
altitude in the Globe that it had in heauen, then kéeping the globe
ſtil at that ſtay, ſéek in the globe the ſtar that you would find out in
the firmament, & marke wel in what part of the Globe it is ſituated,
and how it beareth from the knowne Star, either Eaſt, Weſt,
North or South, and bring the quarter of altitude to that Starre,
that you may know the altitude therof by help of the ſayd quarter,
which altitude once taken, turne your eyes towardes that part of
the firmament, and hauing placed the Diopter of your Aſtrolabe,
at that altitude, look what Star in that part of the firmament doth
anſwere to ſuch altitude, and that is the Starre which you ſéeke,
whoſe name for the moſt part is ſet downe in the Globe. The
ſecond way is thus, hauing learned the true houre of the night
by ſome clocke or watch, bring the degrée of the Sun vnto the brazen
Meridian, & holding it there, ſet the index of the houre whéele

iuſt at the 12. houre, that done, turne the body of the Globe to or
fro vntil the index of the houre whéel fal iuſt vpon the houre which
you ſéeke, and kéeping the Globe at that ſtay, ſéek out the vnknown
Starre in the Globe, and conſider how it beareth from you in the
Globe either Eaſt, Weſt, North or South, then bring the quarter
of altitude to the Star, that you may know thereby what altitude
it hath in the Globe, which once found and hauing ſet the Diopter
of your Aſtrolabe at that altitude, turne your eie towards that
part of the firmament whereunto the place of the Starre found in
the Globe directeth you, and that Star which anſwereth to that
altitude is the Star which you ſéek. But this way is not ſo ſure as
the other way firſt taught, vnles you know the true houre indéed.
               
               
                  How to know by the Globe the Meridian altitude which
is the higheſt altitude of any ſtarre, and alſo how high or lowe
he is at any other time.
Propoſition. 21.
                  
                     HAuing ſet the Globe at your latitude, bring the ſtar
to the brazen Meridian, and there ſtaying it, number
vpon the brazen Meridian the degrées contayned
betwixt the ſaide Star and the South or north
point of the Horizon, according as the Starre is ſituated
either Northward or Southward, for ſo in the latitude 52
you ſhall find the Meridian or higheſt altitude of the Star Arcturus
or Bubulcus to be 60. degrées. But if you would know his
altitude at any other time, then you muſt rectifie the index of the
houre whéele by the 7. propoſition, and hauing ſet the index at the
houre wherein you ſéeke, ſtay the Globe there, vntill you haue
brought the quarter of Altitude vnto the Star, and that wil ſhew
the altitude of the Star at that houre if it be aboue the Horizon.
               
               
                  How to know by the Globe what Starres are aboue the Horizon
at any time of the day or night.
Propoſition. 22.
                  
                     OF Starres according to diuers latitudes ſome ar alwaies
aboue the Horizon & ſome are alwaies vnder
the Horizon, & ſome do both riſe and ſet, if you would
know what Starres he aboue the Horizon in the day

time, then hauing rectified the Index of the houre whéele by the 7.
propoſition, take the altitude of the Sun with your Aſtrolabe or
quadrant, and therewith conſider whether the Sun be in the Eaſt
part or in the Weſt part of the firmament. Then bring the quarter
of altitude on the Eaſt or Weſt ſide of the Globe according as
you ſaw the Sun at that preſent to be in the firmament, and make
the degree of altitude, marked in the quarter of altitude to méete
euen with the degrée of the Ecliptique line wherein the Sunne is
that day, and there ſtaying the Globe, you ſhall ſée all the ſtarres
that be aboue the Horizon at that preſent, as well on the Eaſt ſide
as on the weſt ſide of the Globe, and the Index will ſhew you at
what houre you took the aforeſad altitude. But if it be in the night
ſeaſon, and that the ſtarres doe appeare, take with your Aſtrolabe
the altitude of ſome known ſtar, and by doing as is before taught,
you ſhal haue your deſire. But you muſt not forget firſt of all to
rectifie the Index of the houre whéele by the 7. propoſition.
               
               
                  How to know by the Globe at what time any ſtar riſeth aboue
the Horizon, mounteth to the higheſt, and ſetteth, and
with what degree of the Ecliptique he riſeth, mounteth, and
ſetteth, and alſo in what part of the Horizon he riſeth and ſetteth.
Propoſition. 23.
                  
                     HAuing rectified the Index of the houre whéele by the
7. propoſition, bring the Star to the Eaſt part of the
Horizon, ſo as it may touch the edge thereof, and the
Index of the houre whéele will ſhew at what houre hée
riſeth and by looking at that inſtant to the Ecliptique
line you ſhall ſée what degrée of the Ecliptique riſeth then with
him. That done, bring the ſaid ſtarre to the brazen Meridian, and
the Index of the houre whéele will ſhew at what houre hee is at
the higheſt, and there ſtaying the Globe, marke what degrée of
the Ecliptique line doth fall right vnder the brazen Meridian at
that inſtant, for that degrée is ſayde to accompany him when
hée is at his higheſt. Then bring the ſayd Starre to the Weſt
part of the Horizon, and you ſhall finde by the Index of the
houre whéele at what houre hee ſetteth, and what degree of the

Ecliptique doth accompany him at his ſetting. As for example,
I would knowe the ſixtéenth day of Iune 1590. the ſunne being in
the fourth degrée of Cancer, when Arcturus otherwiſe called Babulcus
and Lanceator doth riſe, mounteth to the higheſt, and ſetteth,
here hauing rectified the Index of the houre-wheele by the
ſeuenth Propoſition, I bring the ſaid ſtarre of the Eaſt part and
very edge of the Horizon, and I finde that he riſeth a little before
twelue of the clocke at noone, and that the 28. degrée and 30′· of
Virgo, riſeth with him, and by looking amongſt the windes vpon
the Horizon right againſt the place of his riſing, I find that he
riſeth Northeaſt and by Eaſt. Secondly by bringing the ſaid ſtar
to the brazen Meridian, the Index of the houre-whéele ſheweth
that he is at his higheſt halfe an houre after ſeuen of the clocke at
night, and is then plaine South, and that the 29. of Libra, doth
then accompany him. Thirdly by bringing the ſaide ſtarre to the
Weſt part of the Horizon, the Index of the houre-whéele ſheweth
that he ſetteth or goeth downe a quarter of an houre before foure
in the morning, and that the fourth degrée of Capricornus doth
accompany him at his ſetting: and by looking there vpon the Horizon,
I find amongeſt the winds that the ſaid ſtar ſetteth Northweſt
and by Weſt.
               
               
                  How to know in what part of the firmament any ſtarre is,
and how many degrees it is diſtant from the Meridian at any
houre, and being right vnder the Meridian to knowe how far
it is diſtant from your Zenith.
The 24. Propoſition.
                  
                     HAuing rectified the Index of the houre-whéele by
the ſeuenth Propoſition, turne the Globe vntill the
Index touch the houre wherein you ſéeke. And ſtaying
the Globe there, bring the quarter of Altitude
to the ſtarre be it on the Eaſt or Weſt ſide of the
Globe, and the nether end of the ſaid quarter will ſhew vpon the
Horizon among the winds, in what part of the firmament the ſtar
is: now if you would know how farre that ſtarre is diſtant from
the Meridian doe thus: looke what degrée of the Equator is at
that inſtant vnder the Meridian, and there make a marke, & then

turne the Globe vntill you haue brought the ſaid ſtarre vnder the
brazen Meridian, and marke what degrée of the Equinoctiall the
ſaid Meridian cutteth at that inſtant, that done, count the degrées
contained betwixt the two markes vpon the Equinoctiall, for ſo
many degrées is the ſtarre diſtant at that time from the Meridian
eyther towards the Eaſt or Weſt, and by allowing 15. degrées to
an houre, and 4′· to a degrée, you ſhall know in what time the ſaid
ſtarre hath to approch to the Meridian, or howe much he is paſt
the Meridian, and hauing brought the ſaid ſtarre right vnder the
Meridian, you ſhall knowe how farre it is diſtant from your Zenith,
by counting the degrées that are contained in the Meridian
betwixt the ſaid ſtar and your Zenith: As for example, the ſixth of
October 1591. (the ſunne being then in the 22. of Libra) I finde
the ſtarre Cor Leonis at thrée of the clocke in the after noone to be
Weſt, Northweſt, & there ſtaying the Globe, I ſée that the Meridian
cutteth the Equinoctiall at the 246. degrée, whereas I make a
marke, that done, I bring the ſtar Cor Leonis to the ſaid Meridian
at which inſtant the Meridian cutteth the Equinoctial in the 146.
degrée, which being taken out of 246. there remaineth 100. degrées,
which is his diſtance from the Meridian, which being deuided
by 15. I find in the quotient 6. houres and 40′· for ſo much
as he is paſt the Meridian towards the Weſt, and by bringing the
foreſaid ſtarre to the Meridian, I finde him to be diſtant from
our Zenith 39. degrées, and 30. minutes.
               
               
                  How to find the houre of the night by the Globe.
The 25. Propoſition.
                  
                     HAuing ſet the Globe at your Latitude, rectifie
the Index of the houre-whéele by the 7. Propoſition,
then hauing taken the Altitude of ſome
ſtarre that you knowe, and is in the Globe with
your Aſtrolabe or Duadrant, bring the quarter
of Altitude vnto the ſtarre, be it in the Eaſt or
Weſt, according as you found the ſtarre to be in the firmament,
not leauing to turne the Globe vntill you haue made the ſtarre to
haue the like Altitude in the Globe vpon the quarter of Altitude,
and alſo the like ſituation that you found it to haue in the firmament

by your Aſtrolabe or Duadrant, & ſtaying the Globe there,
the Index of the houre-whéele wil ſhew the houre: As for example,
in the yeare 1590. the firſt of Ianuarie the ſunne being in the 22.
of Aquarius, I hauing with my Aſtrolabe found that the ſtarre
called Canis maior, that is to ſay the greater dogge, was eleuated
aboue the Horizon in the Eaſt part of the firmament 20. degrées,
I brought the quarter of Altitude to the Eaſt ſide of the
Globe, not leauing to turne the Globe vntill I had made the ſtar
to méete euen with the 20. degrée of the quarter of Altitude, and
there ſtaying the Globe, I found by the Index of the houre-whéele
that it was 8. of the clocke at night, and a quarter paſt.
               
               
                  How to know the verticall ſtarres in euery Latitude.
The 26. Propoſition.
                  
                     THe Globe and the brazen Zenith being ſet according
to the Latitude of the place where you are,
turne the Globe from Eaſt to Weſt, and as many
ſtarres as paſſe right vnder your Zenith are
ſaide to be verticall as in the Latitude 52. you
ſhall ſée the taile of the great Beare, the head of
Perſeus, and diuerſe others to paſſe through your Zenith in turning
the Globe from Eaſt to Weſt.
               
               
                  How to know the true place of any ſtarre, that is to ſay, in
what ſigne and in what degree there of any ſtarre is.
The 27. Propoſition.
                  
                     HAuing faſtned the ſemi-Circle of Longitude and
Latitude vppon the two Poles of the Zodiaque,
the North pole whereof is in the Circle Arctique
not farre from the right clawe of the Dragon, and
the South pole therof is in the circle Antarctique
right oppoſite to the other, then bring the ſaide
ſemi-Circle to the ſtarre, whoſe place you ſéeke, and marke therewith
what point of the Ecliptique the ſaide ſemi-Circle cutteth,
and that is the place of the ſtarre. As for example, by bringing

the ſaid ſemi-Circle to the ſtarre called Hircus, that is to ſay, the
Goate, I finde it to be in the 15. degrée 30. minutes of Gemini,
and that is his place.
               
               
                  How to find the Longitude of any ſtarre by the Globe.
The 28. Propoſition
                  
                     I Haue told you in my Spheare, that the Longitude
of any ſtarre is that arch or portion of the Ecliptique
line, which is contained betwixt the firſt point
of Aries, and that Circle which paſſeth through the
Poles of the Zodiaque, and alſo through the bodie
of the ſtarre, which Circle, the ſemi-Circle of Longitude and Latitude
here repreſenteth: and by making the ſaide ſemi-Circle to
paſſe through the ſtarre called Hircus before mentioned, I finde
that the number of degrées of the Ecliptique, contained betwixt
the ſaid Circle and the firſt point of Aries to be 75. degrées & 30′·
which is the Longitude of the ſaid ſtarre, and thereby maketh
his place to be in the 15. degrée 30′· of Gemini, as before is ſet
downe in the laſt Propoſition.
               
               
                  How to find out the Latitude of any ſtarre.
The 29. Propoſition.
                  
                     I Told you alſo in my Spheare, that the Latitude is
none other thing, but the diſtance of any ſtarre from
the Ecliptique line, eyther towardes the North or
South pole of the Zodiaque, which diſtance the
ſemi-Circle of Longitude and Latitude made to
paſſe through the bodie of the ſtarre, and cutting the Ecliptique
line doth alwaies ſhew, as in the former example, in making the
foreſaide ſemi-Circle to paſſe through the foreſaide ſtarre called
hircus, I find by counting the degrées of the ſaid ſemi-Circle contained
betwixt the Ecliptique line and the bodie of the ſtarre, that
the Latitude of that ſtarre is 22. degrées and 30. minutes towardes
the North, likewiſe by bringing the ſaid ſemi-Circle to
the ſtarre which is in the right ſhoulder of Orion called Bed Alguze,
I find his Latitude to be 17. degrées towards the South.
               
               
                  
                  How to find out by the Globe the declination of
any ſtarre.
The 30. Propoſition.
                  
                     THe declination is none other thing but the diſtance
of any ſtarre from the Equinoctiall, either
towards the North pole or South pole of the
world, which is to be found thus: Firſt hauing
brought the ſtarre right vnder the brazen Meridian,
and there ſtaying the Globe, count the degrées
of the ſaid Meridian contained betwixt the ſaide ſtarre and
the Equinoctiall point or ſtréeke of the ſaid Meridian, and that
ſhall be the declination of the ſtarre: As for example, bring the
ſtarre Hircus vnto the Meridian, and you ſhall find the declination
thereof to be 45. degrées towardes the North pole of the
world, and that the ſtarre which is in the foote of the Hare called
Lepus, hath of South declination 23. degrées.
               
               
                  How to know the magnitude or greatnes of any ſtarre, and

of the Arch of the Ecliptique which accompaneth the
right aſcention of any ſtarre.
The 31. Propoſition.
                  
                     
                        MArcator deſcribeth the ſixe magnitudes of the
ſtarres by making ſixe figures or ſhapes of ſtars
placed not farre from the head of the great beare,
whereof the firſt and greateſt hath 16. pointes
or beames, the ſecond eight, the third ſixe, the
fourth fiue, the fift ſixe, which indéede by that account
would be but foure: and the ſixth hath fiue, which would
haue but thrée: but in mine opinion it had béene better to haue
made the firſt magnitude with ten points, the ſecond with nine,
the third with eight, the fourth with ſeuen, the fift with ſixe, and
the ſixt with fiue: ſo ſhould the magnitude of euery ſtarre deſcribed
in the Globe haue béene the more eaſily knowne. But to the
intent that you might exerciſe your ſelfe in finding out by the

Globe, the place, Longitude, Latitude, and declination of any
ſtarre that is deſcribed in the Globe: I haue thought good to adde
hereunto the Table of Garceus, ſhewing not only the Longitude,
Latitude and declination of the moſt notable ſtarres that are both
Northward and Southward, but alſo the right aſcention, magnitude
or bigneſſe, the qualitie or nature of euery ſuch ſtarre, and
alſo the Arch of the Ecliptique line, which accompanieth the right
aſcention of euery ſtar, which Table though by the ſaide Garceus
was calculated out of the Aſtronomicall Tables for the yeare of
our Lord 1564. and not by the Globe, yet for your better exerciſe
in matters of the Globe, I thought good to ſet downe ſuch Longitude,
Latitude, declination, magnitude, and right aſcention,
and all other things contained in the ſaid Table, according as they
are to be found out by the Celeſtiall Globe of Mercator, and not
calculated by any of the Aſtronomicall Tables.
                  Though the Longitudes and declinations of the fixed ſtarres
ſet downe in this Table to ſerue Mercator his Globe, doe not
altogether agrée with the great Celeſtiall Globe, lately ſet foorth
by M. Sanderſon and by M. Molinaxe, by reaſon that the Longitudes
and declinations of the ſaide ſtarres are méere lately calculated,
that is to ſay, for the yeare of our Lord, 1592. yet it
will ſerue to ſhewe you the way how to exerciſe your ſelfe in the
ſaid Globe, and thereby you may correct this Table, and make it
to agrée in all points with the new great Globe, whereby you
ſhall reape more pleaſure then griefe or paine. For I had this
Table (as I haue ſaide before) out of Garceus, and did here
ſet it downe more for your exerciſe, and to acquaint you with the
fixed ſtarres that are deſcribed in the Celeſtiall Globe, then for
any other purpoſe.
                  
                     The vſe of the Table next enſuing.
                     
                        THis Table is deuided into eight collums, The firſt
whereof on the left hande, containeth the names of
the ſtarres, the ſeconde the degrées and minutes of
Longitude, together with the Characters of the 12.
ſignes: the third the degrées and minutes of Latitude both Northerne
and Southerne, the North Latitude being marked with

the letter N. and the South Latitude with the letter S. the fourth
containeth the degrées and minutes of declination both Northern
and Southerne, marked with the letters N. and S. as before. The
fift ſheweth the magnitude or greatneſſe of the ſtarre, whether
it be of the firſt, ſecond or third bigneſſe, &c. The ſixth containeth
the degrées and minutes of the right aſcention of the foreſaide
fixed ſtarres. The ſeuenth containeth the Characters of the Planets,
ſignifying the nature and qualitie of the ſtarres. The eigth
containeth the degrées and minutes of the right aſcention of the
Ecliptique line and the ſignes of the Zodiaque.
                     Here followeth the Table.

                  How to finde out the right and oblique aſcention of any
ſtarre, and alſo of the aſcentionall difference.
The 32. Propoſition.
                  
                     THe right aſcention of any ſtar is an arch or portion
of the Equator, to be counted from the firſt point of
Aries according to the ſucceſſion of the ſignes, with
which portion in a right Spheare any ſtarre both
riſeth mounteth to the Meridian, and ſetteth: and
in an oblique Spheare it is a portion of the Equator, wherewith
the ſtar is mounted to the Meridian: as for example, in a great
Spheare the ſtar called Cor Leonis, that is to ſay, the hart of the

Lion, both riſeth, mounteth and ſetteth with the 145. degr. 30′· of
the Equinoctiall. But the right aſcention of the ſaid ſtarre in an
oblique Spheare, is to be found onely by bringing the ſaid ſtarre
to the Meridian, and you ſhall find it to be all one with the right
aſcention in a right Spheare, for by bringing the ſtarre called
Cor Leonis to the Meridian in an oblique Spheare, you ſhall
finde the right aſcention thereof to be all one with that which it
had in a right Spheare, that is 145. degrées 30′· of the Equinoctiall.
But if you would know the oblique aſcention of any ſtar,
then hauing ſet the Globe at your Latitude, bring the ſtarre to the
Eaſt part of the Horizon, & marke what degrée of the Equinoctial

riſeth therewith and that is the oblique aſcention: As for example,
the Globe ſtanding at the Latitude 52. bring the ſtarre, Cor Leonis
to the Eaſt part of the Horizon, & by ſtaying the Globe there,
you ſhall find the 127. degrée of the Equinoctiall to riſe with that
ſtarre. Now if you would know the aſcentionall difference, that
is to lay, the difference betwixt the right and oblique aſcention,
you haue no more to doe but to ſubtract the leſſer out of the greater,
and the remainder ſhall be the aſcentionall difference, as in
the former example, take 127 degrées out of 145. degrées and 30′
and there ſhall remaine 18. degrées 30′· and that is the aſcentionall
difference, by helpe wherof you may know the encreaſe and
decreaſe of the artificiall day and night throughout the yeare in
any Latitude, if you obſerue that order which I haue already ſet
downe in the firſt part of my Spheare, the 50. Chapter.
               
               
                  To know in what quantitie of time any whole ſigne or any
other Arch of the Ecliptique doth riſe or ſet.
The 33. Propoſition.
                  
                     HAuing ſet the Globe at your Latitude, and rectified
the Index of the houre whéele by the ſeuenth
Propoſition, bring the beginning of any Arch or
ſigne to the Eaſt part of the Horizon, and marke
what degrée of the Equinoctiall riſeth therewith,
that done, bring the end of the ſaid ſigne or arch
to the Eaſt part of the Horizon, and marke there alſo what degrée
of the Equinoctiall toucheth the Horizon, and ſtaying the Globe
there, looke how many houres or parts of houres the Index of the
houre-whéele hath runne betwixt the beginning and ending of the
ſaid ſigne or arch, and ſo you ſhall know the quantitie of that time,
you may know it alſo by the number of degrées of the Equinoctiall
contained betwixt the beginning and ending of the ſaid ſigne
or arch by allowing 15. degrées to an houre, and 4′· to a degrée.
As for example, ſuppoſing the ſunne to be in the firſt degrée of
Taurus, you ſhall finde by working according to the rule before
ſet downe, that the whole ſigne of Taurus doth ſpend in riſing
one houre 8′· Now if you will knowe howe much time he ſpendeth
in deſcending, bring the firſt degrée of Taurus to the Weſt

part of the Horizon, marking what degrée of the Equinoctiall
toucheth the Horizon at that inſtant, and alſo to what houre the
Index pointeth, then turne the Globe ſtill Weſtwarde vntill the
laſt degrée of Taurus méeteth euen with the edge of the Horizon,
and then marke againe as well the degrees of the Equinoctiall
that toucheth the Horizon, as alſo to what houre the Index pointeth,
and you ſhall find the number of degrées of the Equinoctiſt
to be 42. degrees, which maketh two houres 48. minutes, which
is anſwerable to the houre of the houre-whéele, and ſo much time
the whole ſigne of Taurus ſpendeth in his deſcention or going
downe.
               
               
                  How to know by the Globe what ſtarres doe riſe or ſet euery
day Coſmically, Acronically, or Helically.
The 34. Propoſition.
                  
                     AS for the thréefold Poeticall riſing and ſetting
of the ſtars, you ſhall find them plainly
defined in the firſt part of my Spheare,
Chap. 35. but to finde out the ſame by the
Globe, you muſt doe thus. Firſt hauing ſet
your Globe at your Latitude, and ſought
out the place of the ſunne for that day, bring
the degrée of the ſunne to the Eaſt part of
the Horizon, and ſtay the Globe there, that you may ſée what ſtars
doe riſe a little before the ſunne, and which riſe together with the
ſunne. For thoſe that riſe a little before the ſunne, are ſaide to riſe
Helically, and thoſe that riſe together with the ſunne, are ſayde
to riſe Coſmically, and thoſe ſtarres that are in the very Weſt
part of the Horizon at the riſing of the ſunne, are ſaide to ſet Coſmically.
Againe thoſe ſtarres that riſe immediatly after the ſunne,
doe ſet Helically, that done, turne the degree of the ſunne vnto
the Weſt part of the Horizon, and ſtaying the Globe there marke
what ſtarres are readie to goe downe with him, for thoſe are ſaid
to ſet Acronically, ans ſtaying the Globe ſtill there in the Weſt,
marke what ſtarres at that preſent doe riſe in the Eaſt part of the
Horizon, for thoſe are ſaid to riſe Acronically.
               
               
                  
                  To know in what time of the yeare any ſtarre riſeth or ſetteth,
either Coſmically, or Acronically.
The 35. Propoſition.
                  
                     HEre hauing ſet the Globe at your Latitude, and
knowing the degrée of the ſunne, bring the ſtarre to
the Eaſt part of the Horizon, and therewith conſider
what degrée of the Ecliptique the Horizon cutteth
at that preſent, that done, finde out the ſelfe
ſame degrée vpon the Horizon in the narrow ſpace of degrées next
vnto the bodie of the Globe, and right againſt that degrée, you
ſhall finde in what day and moneth that ſtarre doth riſe Coſmically,
As for example, I would knowe at what time of the yeare
Cor Leonis riſeth Coſmically in the Latitude 52. I bring the
ſtarre Cor Leonis to the Eaſt part of the Horizon, and I finde
that the Horizon cutteth the Ecliptique in the 23. degrée 30′· of
Leo, which degrée being found againe vppon the Horizon, pointeth
to the ſixth day of Auguſt, ſo as I conclude that Cor Leonis
doth riſe that preſent day Coſmically, for then both he and the
ſunne are in a manner in one ſelfe degrée of the Ecliptique: nowe
to know the Coſmicall ſetting of the ſaide ſtarre, turne the ſame
ſtarre to the Weſt part of the Horizon, and marke what degrée
of the Ecliptique doth then riſe in the Eaſt, and you ſhall finde
the ſame to be the 23. degrée of Aquarius, which degrée béeing
found againe vpon the Horizon in the narrow ſpace of degrées next
to the body of the Globe, containing the degrées of the Zodiaque,
will point to the 31. day of Ianuarie, at which time the ſunne is
oppoſite to the ſaid ſtarre, and therefore it is ſaide to goe downe
Coſmically, becauſe it goeth downe when the ſunne riſeth. Now
to know the Acronicall riſing of any ſtarre at any time, bring the
ſtarre to the Eaſt part of the Horizon, and marke therewith what
degrée of the Ecliptique goeth downe in the Weſt at that inſtant,
for the ſunne being in that degrée is oppoſite to the ſtarre: As for
example, by bringing the ſtarre Cor Leonis to the Eaſt part of
the Horizon, you ſhall find that the 23. degrée of Aquarius goeth
downe at that inſtant, which degree being found againe vpon the
Horizon, will ſhewe the day and moneth when the ſtarre riſeth

Acronically, and ſo you ſhall find the ſtarre Cor Leonis to riſe Acronically
the 31. day of Ianuary. Contrariwiſe if you woulde
know when the ſaid ſtarre ſetteth Acronically, bring the ſaid ſtar
Cor Leonis, to the Weſt part of the Horizon, & therewith marke
what degrée of the Ecliptique then ſetteth in the Weſt, which degree
being found againe vpon the Horizon, will ſhew that the ſaid
ſtarre ſetteth Acronically the 6. of Auguſt.

The 36. Propoſition.
                  
                     THis word Horoſcop doth not onely ſignifie the
degree of the Ecliptique, otherwiſe called the
aſcendent which riſeth aboue the Horizon in the
beginning of any thing that is to be ſought or
knowne, but alſo ſometimes the whole figure of
heauen containing the 12. houſes, and doth ſhew
the very ſecrets of nature, ſo that there is nothing that chanceth
to the inferiour bodies, but ſome cauſe thereof doth appeare by
meane of the Horoſcope in heauen, and therefore the Aſtrologians
haue deuided the whole heauen into 12. houſes, which are
numbred from the Horoſcope, which is the Eaſt Angle, and ſo
foorth according to the ſucceſſion of the ſignes, of which 12. houſes
the foure principall are foure points of the Zodiaque whereof
two doe fall vpon the Horizon, and the other two vpon the Meridian,
and are called principall points, poles, or Angles, that is
the beginning of the firſt houſe, of the fourth houſe, of the ſeuenth
houſe, and of the tenth houſe, and thoſe that doe follow next any of
theſe principall Angles, are called ſuccéeding houſes, in Latine
Succedentes, as the ſecond, the fifth, the eight, and the eleuenth
houſe. And thoſe that goe next before any of the foure principall
Angles, are called falling houſes, in Latine Cadentes, as the 12.
the third, the ſixth, and the ninth: and ſuch houſes as haue no familiaritie
with the Horoſcop or aſcendent, as the ſecond, the ſixth,
the eight, and the eleuenth houſes are ſaid to be ſlow and deiect,
all which things this Table here following doth ſhew, containing
the number and names of the houſes, and alſo their ſignifications.

Propoſition. 37.
                  
                     FIrſt hauing ſet the Globe at your latitude, and
rectified the index of the houre whéele according
to the degrée of the ſigne where in the Sun is that
day you ſéeke by the 7. propoſition, if it be in the
day time, take with your Aſtrolabe or Quadrant.
the altitude of the Sun. But if it be in the night,
take the altitude of ſome knowne Starre, that thereby you may
knowe the houre of the day or night in which you ſéeke the aſcendent.
But if it happen that neither Sunne nor ſtarre is to be
ſéene that day or night, then learne by ſome true clocke or watch
what houre it is, and hauing ſet the Index of the houre wheele at
that houre, ſtay the Globe there, and therewith marke what degrée
of the Ecliptique riſeth in the Eaſt parte of the Globe aboue
the horizon at that inſtant, and that degrée is the Horoſcop or aſcendent
for that houre. As for example, you woulde find out the
aſcendent the 16. of Iune 1590. at 8. of the clock in the forenoone,
at which day the Sunne is in the 4. degrée of Cancer, here hauing
firſt ſet the Index of the houre whéele at that houre by ſtaying the
Globe there, you ſhal finde that the 21. degrée 30′· of Leo is the
aſcendent, which is the Eaſt angle or firſt houſe, whereby you may
alſo at that inſtant find out the other three angles, that is, the weſt,
South, and North angles, for the oppoſit point of the Zodiaque
to the aſcendent is the Weſt angle or ſeuenth houſe. And that degrée
of the Zodiaque, which is at that inſtant right vnder the
Meridian aboue head in the South angle or 10. houſe, and the
oppoſite point to that beneath, is the north angle or fourth houſe,
for hauing found the aſcendent, which is the Eaſt angle or firſt
houſe to be the 21. degrée, 30. minutes of Leo, the Weſt angle
muſt needs be the 21. degrée. 30. minutes of A quarius. Againe

                        •
                     he ſouth angle or 10. houſe is the 8. degrée of Taurus, and the opoſite
point to that is the North Angle or fourth houſe which is

                        •

Montanus his way which is called the reaſonable way, and is
counted the beſt of all others.
Propoſition. 38.
                  
                     FIrſt you muſt find out the degrée of the aſcendent
as is taught in the laſt chapter, which is alwayes
the firſt houſe, then ſtaying the Globe with ſome
pretie wedges of wood being thruſt betwixt the
Horizon and the bodie of the Globe, marke there
what degrée of the equinoctial doth touch the Horizon
at that inſtant, and number from thence vpward vpon the
ſaid Equinoctiall 30. degrées, to the ende of which 30. degrées,
bring the ſemicircle of poſition being firſt faſtened in his due
place vpon the Eaſt ſide of the Horizon, and looke what degrée
and ſigne of the Zodiaque the circle of poſition cutteth at that
preſent, and that degrée ſhall be the twelfth houſe: then number
againe other 30. degrées vpon the Equinoctiall vpwardes towards
the brazen Meridian, and to that bring the ſemicircle of
poſition, marking what degrée of the Zodiaque the ſaid ſemicircle
cutteth, and that ſhall be the 11. houſe, that done, looke what
degrée of the Zodiaque is right vnder the brazen meridian aboue
heade, and that ſhall be the 10. houſe. Then hauing ſet the ſemicircle
of poſition vpon the Weſt ſide of the Globe, number from
the brazen Meridian weſtward vpon the Equinoctiall other 30.
degrées, to the end whereof bring the ſemicircle of poſition, and
marke what degrée of the Zodiaque the circle of poſition cutteth,
and that ſhall be the 9. houſe, then from thence downward number
vpon the Equinoctiall other 30. degrées, to the end whereof
bring the ſemicircle of poſition, marking there what ſigne
and degrée of the Zodiaque the ſaide ſemicircle cutteth, and tha
                        •
                     
ſhall be the 8. houſe. Now hauing theſe ſixe houſes, the oppoſite
points of the ſayd ſixe houſes will ſhewe you the other ſixe houſes,
and if you will know which houſes, and alſo which ſignes are oppoſite
one to another, marke well this Table following.

                  And to make al theſe things the more plain vnto you, I thought
good to ſet downe this example following. Suppoſe that the
16. of Iune, Anno 1590. and at 8. of the clocke in the morning
you would erect a figure to knowe how the 12. houſes of heauen
are ſituated at that preſent, firſt hauing drawne ſuch a ſquare figure
as this here following, repreſenting the 12. houſes, learne
by the laſt propoſition, who is the aſcendent at that inſtant, and
you ſhall finde finde it to be the 21. degrée 30′· of Leo, which muſt bée
ſet in the firſt houſe, and the 28. degrée of Cancer in the 12. houſe
and the 22. degrée of Gemini in the 11. houſe, and the 9. degrée
of Taurus in the 10. houſe, and the 5. degrée of Aries to be in the
9. houſe, and the 12. degrée of Piſces in the 8. houſe. Nowe the
oppoſite houſe to the firſt houſe or aſcendent is the 7. houſe which
is the 21. degrée. 30′· of Aquarius, for the oppoſite ſigne muſt
alwayes haue like number of degrées, then the oppoſit to the 12.
houſe is the 6. houſe, which the 28. deg of Capricorne, and the
oppoſit to the 11. is the 5. houſe, which is the 22. degrée of
Sagittarius, and the oppoſite to the 10. houſe is the 4. houſe,
which is the 9. degrée of Scorpio, and the oppoſite to the 9. houſe
in the 3. houſe, which is the 5. degrée of Libra, and the oppoſite to
the 8. houſe is the ſecond houſe which is the 12. degrée of Virgo,
all which things this figure here following doth plainely ſhewe.
And if you would know what Planets ſhould be placed in euerie
houſe, you muſt learne that out of the Ephemerides, or out of
ſome of the Aſtronomicall Tables.

                  Now becauſe moſt men that doe ſhewe the vſe of the Globes,
doe alſo teach therein how to finde out the latitude and longitude
of anie region, I thought good therefore to ſet downe here ſome
of their manifolde waies touching the finding out of the ſame,
notwithſtanding that I haue alreadie written ſomething thereof
in the ſecond part of my Spheare, in the 8. 9. 10. & 11. chapters.
               
               
                  How to know the latitude of any place or region by any of
the fixed ſtarres deſcribed in the Globe.
Propoſition. 39.
                  
                     TAke in the night ſeaſon with your Aſtrolabe the
Meridian altitude of ſome knowne ſtarre that is
to be found in the Globe, then hauing brought
the ſtarre vnder the brazen Meridian, turne the
Meridian vp and downe in the nickes of the
horizon, vntill the ſame Starre haue the

ſaid altitude in the brazen Meridian, which you found it to haue in
the firmament by your Aſtrolabe, that done, number the degrées
of the Meridian contayned betwixt the Pole and the Horizon, and
that is the latitude of that place.
               
               
                  Another way to find the eleuation of the Pole.
Propoſition. 40.
                  
                     HAuing brought the Globe into an open place where
the Sunne ſhineth at nonnetide, and placed the ſame
right North and ſouth as is taught in the firſt chapter,
ſet a néedle in the degrée of the Sunne, and bring
the ſame to the brazen Meridian, not leauing to turn
the ſame Meridian vp and downe in the nicks of the Horizon, vntill
the néedle caſt no ſhadow at all, and there ſtaying the Globe,
looke how many degrées the pole is eleuated aboue the Horizon,
for that is the latitude of that place.
               
               
                  A third way to finde out the latitude of any place without
taking the Meridian altitude of any Starre.
Propoſition. 41.
                  
                     TAke at any houre the altitude of 2 knowne ſtars,
and ſuch as are to be found in the Globe at one
ſelfe inſtant whereof the one muſt be ſituated towards
the Eaſt, and the other towards the Weſt,
then turne the Globe together with the Meridian
vp and downe in the nicks of the Horizon, vntill
you finde by helpe of the quarter of altitude each Starre to haue
the ſelfe ſame altitude in the Globe, that it had in heauen, which
being done, looke how many degrées the North pole is eleuated
aboue the Horizon, and that is the latitude of that place. But if
you would knowe the latitude of any place that is towardes the
South Pole, then you muſt firſt place the South pole aboue the

ſubtract the ſame from the Meridian altitude, if
Southern adde it to the Meridian altitude ſo ſhal
you haue the eleuation of the Equinoctiall, which
being ſubtracted from 90. the remainder ſhal be the latitude of
that place as for example. I find the Meridian altitude of Oculus
Tauri to be 53. degrées, 50′· 32″· and his declination Northward
to be 15. degrées, 50′· 32″· which declination being ſubtracted
from the Meridian altitude, there remaineth 38. degrées,
and that is the eleuation of the Equinoctiall, which being ſubtracted
from 90. there remaineth 52. for the latitude of that place.

the firſt on the left hande contayneth the
degrées of euery ſigne ſet downe in the front

                     FIrſt knowing the day of the moneth, reſort vnto the diurnall
Table of motion of the Planets in the Ephemerides, and hauing
there found out the motion or place of the Moone, and alſo
of the Dragons heade anſwerable to the day wherein you ſéeke,
ſubtract the place of the Dragons head from the place of the
Moone, which is eaſily done ſo often as the arke of the Moone is
greater, that is to ſay, contayneth more ſignes and degrées than
the arke of the Dragons heade, beginning your account in both
arkes from the firſt point of Aries. But if the arke of the Moone

be leſſer than the ark of the Dragons head, ſo as you cannot make
your ſubtraction, then you muſt add to the place of the Moone 12.
ſignes, which is 360. degrées, and you muſt adde alſo thereunto
the number of ſo many ſignes as are contayned betwixt the firſt
point of Aries, and the firſt point of that ſigne wherin the Moone
is at that preſent, which ſigne it ſelfe is not to bee numbred, and
when you come to take out of that whole ſumme the place of the
Dragons head, you muſt firſt adde to the ſaid place of the Dragons
head the number of ſo many ſignes as are contained betwixt
the firſt point of Aries, and the firſt point of that ſigne
wherein the Dragons head is at that inſtant, but not the ſigne
wherein it is, and then hauing made your ſubtraction, remember
alwayes to take out of that remainder 90. degrées, which is
thrée ſignes, ſo oft as you haue neede to adde 12. ſignes to the
place of the Moone, and not otherwiſe, and with that remainder
you muſt reſort to the foreſaid table of the Moones latitude, as for
example.
                  
                  
                     The Example.
                     Suppoſe that you would knowe what latitude the Moone had
the firſt of Nouember 1590. here reſorting to the diurnall Table
of the Ephemerides, you find according to the day propoūded, the
place of the Moone to be in the 16. degrée 49′· of Taurus, and the
place of the Dragons head to be in the 28. degrée 14′· of Cancer.
Now according to the rule before giuen, you muſt take the place
of the dragon here, which is 28. degrées, 14′· of Cancer out of the
16. deg. 49′· of Taurus, which is the place of the Moone, and becauſe
you cannot take the greater ſum out of the leſſer, you muſt
adde to the leſſer ſum 12. ſignes, which make 360. degrées, and
alſo one ſigne, for Aries going next before Taurus, in which ſigne
the Moone is, ſo ſhall you make the whole ſum to be 13. ſignes 16
degrées 49′· out of which ſumme you muſt ſubtract the Dragons
head, which with the ſignes that goe next before Cancer, counting
from the firſt point of Aries, do make 3. ſignes 28. degrées,
14′· which being ſubtracted out of 13. ſignes, 16. degrées, 49′
there remaineth 9. ſignes, 18 deg. 35′· out of which you muſt alſo
ſubtract 90. deg. which is 3. whole ſignes, & ſo you find the remainder
to be 6. ſignes, 18. degrées 35′· with which laſt remainder
you haue to enter into the table of the Moones latitude, in the foot

wherof you ſhal find 6. ſignes, and in the laſt collum on the right
hand 18. & in the next collum towards the left hand, & in the common
angle anſwerable aſwel to the ſaid 18. degrée. as alſo to the 6
ſignes, you ſhal find the latitude of the Moone to be 4. deg. 45′· &
17″· (which ſeconds may be very wel omitted) and her latitude to
be ſouth. But now becauſe there are 35′· more annexed to the 18.
degrées of the foreſaid remainder, you muſt find out a proportionall
part anſwerable to thoſe minutes which is to be done thus.
                     Take out of the table the whole latitude anſwerable to 6 ſignes
& 19. deg. which is one degrée more, ſo as now the latitude of the
Moone is 4. deg. 43′· omitting the ſeconds. Then ſubtract 4. deg.
43′· out of 4. degrées 45′· & there remaineth 2′· Now to find out a
proportionall part anſwerable to the former 35′· you muſt ſay
thus. If 60′· require 2′· what ſhall 35′· require? and the quotient
yéeldeth 1′· 10″· which being ſubtracted out of 4. degrées 45′· there
wil remaine 4. degrées. 44′· and ſo much was the ſouth latitude of
the Moone at that preſent day.

Propoſition. 46.
                  
                     BVt now becauſe that to finde out the true place of the
Moone or of any other Planet in the Globe to work
thereby certainly and truly, it is not inough to knowe
their places in the Zodiaque at noonetyde, vnleſſe
you knowe the ſame at the verie houre in which you
ſeeke. Stadius teacheth a briefe rule to find out the true place of
any Planet at what houre ſo euer you deſire by helpe of a ſhort
Table ſet downe in the 109. page of his Ephemerides, which
rule and Table he borrowed of Reinholdus. And this Table conſiſteth
of 3. collums, in euery front wherof are ſet firſt degrées, minutes,
ſeconds, and thirds, and vnder them minutes, ſecondes,
thirds, and fourths. And note that the firſt row of numbers on the
left hand ſignifieth ſometime degrées, and ſometime minutes, eyther
of which do extend in this Table to 60. & to 61. right againſt
which rowe in euery collum is ſet down on the right hand the proportionall
part for one houre, the rule is thus.
                  
                     
                     The Rule.
                     Firſt finde out by the Ephemerides the place of the Planet
wherein it is at noontyde the ſame day that you ſéeke, and alſo
the place of the ſame Planet, wherein it is the next day following
at noone, and ſubtract the leſſer out of the greater, if the two places
at noonetyde be ſtill in one ſelfe ſigne, but if the two places bée
in two ſeuerall ſignes, then you muſt count how many degrées of
the Ecliptique the one place is diſtant from the other, and that
ſhall be the difference, with which difference you muſt reſort to the
Table, and right againſt that on the right hande in the ſame collum
wherein you found the difference, you ſhall alſo find the proportionall
part for one houre, as by this example you ſhall more
plainly vnderſtand.
                  
                  
                     The Example.
                     Suppoſe then that you deſire to knowe the true place of the
Sunne or of the Moone, or of any other Planet at fiue of the
clocke in the after noone the 30. of December 1591. at which
day you find the Sunne at noontyde to be in the 18. degrée, and 7.
minutes of Capricorne, and the next day at noone to be in the 19.
degrée and 8′· of the ſame ſigne, the difference whereof you finde
by ſubtraction to be one degrée and one minute, with which difference
you muſt enter into the table, and ſéeking for one degrée in
the firſt collum on the left hande, you finde next vnto that on the
right hand 2′· 30″· then for one minute which before was named
one degrée, you find next vnto it 2″· 30‴· which being added to
the former ſumme laſt found, maketh 2′· 32″· 30‴· which is the
proportionall part for one houre. Then hauing multiplyed that
by 5. houres to ſerue 5. of the clocke in the afternoone, you ſhall
find the product to be 12′· 42″· 30‴· which being added to the firſt
Meridian place, which is 18. degrées and 7. minutes of Capricorne,
maketh in all 18. degrées 19′· 42″· 30‴· And remember
that if your difference be only minutes, then the bodie of the Table
doth ſhew the proportionall part. But if the difference doth
containe degrées, then the fourths muſt bee made thirdes, and the
thirds ſecondes, the ſecondes minutes, and the minutes degrées.
And this table ſerueth for the 7. Planets for euer. Notwithſtanding
Stadius ſetteth downe another Table to finde out thereby
the proportional moouing of the Moone feruing as wel for houres

as for minutes of houres, which table beginneth at the 144. page,
and endeth at the 184. page of his booke.
                     In the front of which table in euery page are ſet downe the differences
of the two places of the Planets which you haue found
by ſubtracting the leſſer out of the greater, if the planet be at both
noonetydes in one ſelfe ſigne, but if ſhe be at the two noontides in
two ſeuerall ſignes, then ſuch difference is to bee accounted vpon
the Ecliptique line, to know howe many degrées the one place is
diſtant from the other, and as for the minutes, if there be any, you
may know the difference thereof by ſubtracting the leſſer number
out of the greater. And in the outermoſt collum on the left hande
are ſet downe the houres and minutes marked in the foote with
the letter H. ſignifying houres, and vnder that with the letter M
ſignifying minutes, whereof the houres procéede but to 24. but
the minutes extend to 60. which make one houre procéeding by euen
numbers in this ſorte. 1. 2. 4. 6. 8. &c. and therefore not finding
that houre or minute which you ſéeke in the ſayd collum, you
muſt take the next number which is leſſer by one, and ſo make it vp
by adding the firſt and onlie odde one vnto it, and in each common
angle you ſhall find the proportionall part that is to bee added to
the firſt place of the Planet anſwering to the day of the moneth
wherein you ſought. All which thinges you ſhall more plainelie
vnderſtand by this one example.
                  
                  
                     The example.
                     Suppoſe then that you would knowe the true place of the
Moone at 5. of the clocke. 17′· in the afternoone the 28. of December
1591. and looking in the Ephemerides you find the place of
the Moone to be the ſame day at noonetide in the 26. degrée 12′· of
Libra. and the next day at noontide to be in the 8. deg. 17′· of Scorpio.
here by numbring how many degrées are contayned in the Ecliptique
line betwixt thoſe two places, and by ſubtracting the
leſſer number of minutes out of the greater, you ſhall finde the
difference to be 12. degrées 5′· with which difference you muſt reſort
to the table of proportionall parts, and there hauing found
the ſaid difference in the front of the 13. page of the ſaid table, look
in the firſt collum on the left hand, for the houres and minutes
according to the rule before ſet downe. As here in this example,
becauſe you cannot find 5. houres, you take foure, right againſt

which on the right hand in the common angle you ſhal find 2. degrées
0′· 50″· then for one houre to make the 5. houres, you ſhall
find in the common angle 30′· 12″· that done, ſéeke out the 17′· in
the firſt collum, which number not being there you muſt take 16.
againſt which in the common angle you ſhall find 8′· 3″· 20‴· and
for the one minute which is to be added to 16. you ſhall find in the
common angle againſt that one minute 30″· 12‴· and by adding
all theſe ſummes together, you ſhall find the proportionall part to
be 2. degrées, 39′· 35″· 32‴· which being added to the place of the
Moone at noontyde firſt found in the Ephemerides, maketh in all
28. degrées, 51′· 35″· 32‴· of Libra, which is the true place of the
Moone for that houre. But you haue to note that the denominations
of the numbers contained in the common angles of proportional
parts be not alwaies like, for when they are to anſwer houres
then the firſt number on the left hand in euery angle ſignifieth degrées,
and the reſt minutes & ſeconds, but if they haue to anſwere
minutes of houres, then the firſt numbers doe ſignifie minutes,
and the reſt ſeconds and thirds, as you may eaſilie perceiue by examining
the former example. But nowe to returne to my firſt intention,
which was to ſhewe you how to find out the true place of
euerie Planet in the Globe, you haue to vnderſtand that hauing
found out the true place of any Planet at the day and houre wherin
you ſéeke, by ſuch meanes as is before taught, then reſort to the
celeſtiall Globe, and hauing ſet the ſame at your latitude, and
alſo rectified the houre whéele according to the day wherein you
ſéeke. Suppoſe that the 26. of May 1592. you would knowe in
what part of the Globe the Moone is to be found at 5. of the clocke
in the afternoone. Here firſt you muſt knowe her place at noone
the ſame day, which is the 14. degrée, 28′· of Aries, and alſo her
place the next day at noone, which is the 29. degrée 0′· of the ſame
ſigne, Now by taking 14. degrées 28′· out of 29. degrées, you ſhal
finde the remainder to bée 14. degrées, 32′· with which difference
you muſt reſorte to the table ſet downe in the 109. page. And by
working as before is taught, you ſhal finde her place or longitude
to be at fiue of the clocke in the 17. degrée 23′· 6″· 43‴· of Aries,
which being counted vpon the Ecliptique line of the Globe, lay
your ſemicircle of longitude and latitude to that point, and hauing
learned her latitude by helpe of the Table of latitude before

mentioned, by which you ſhall find her latitude to be at that
time 4. deg. 46′· to the Southward, then hauing counted that latitude
vpon the ſemicircle of lōgitude & latitude, make there a mark
vpon the Globe, for that is her very place at that inſtant that is to
ſay, at 5. of the clocke in the afternoone the 26. day of May 1592
                     Now if you would know when ſhe riſeth and ſetteth, you haue
no more to do but to bring her place before marked on the Globe
vnto the Horizon on the Eaſt part, and the index of the houre
whéele being rectifyed as is before ſaid, will ſhew the houre of her
riſing aboue the Horizon, and by bringing her place to the weſt
part of the Horizon, the Index will ſhew the houre of her ſetting,
and by bringing her place to the brazen Meridian, you ſhal know
at what houre ſhe is full South. The like Tables you ſhall finde
alſo in Stadius to find out the true place of euery other Planet at
anie houre, as of Saturne, Iupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercurie,
which Tables doe beginne at the 128. page, and ende at the
143. page of his booke, the order of working by which Tables
is like in euerie reſpect vnto that of the Moone laſt taught. By
which Tables you may finde out the true place of anie other
Planet in the Globe at anie houre of the day or night, and
thereby to knowe the houre of his riſing and ſetting, if you rightly
obſerue the rules before taught touching the vſe of the foreſaid
Tables. And note that you may finde out the place of the Moone
by the Globe without the helpe of any Ephemerides, by ſuch
wayes as here doe followe.

be found in the Globe, and alſo at that time is aboue the Horizon,
marking therewith in what part of the firmament the ſaid Starre
is, and with your croſſe ſtaffe take the diſtance betwixt the moone
and that ſtar. Then hauing theſe thrée things, that is, the altitude
of the Moone, the altitude of the Starre, and alſo the diſtance betwixt
the Moone and the knowne ſtarre. Mooue the globe together
with the quarter of altitude to and fro vntill you haue made
the Moone to haue the ſame altitude and like place in the Globe,
that you founde it to haue in the firmament, and there make a
marke vpon the Globe. Then bring the quarter of altitude towards
the Starre, that the Star may haue the like altitude and
like place in the Globe that it had in the firmament, and there hauing
ſtayed the Globe that it may not mooue, take with your
Compaſſe vpon the Equinoctiall the diſtance betwixt the Moone
and the ſtarre before found by the croſſe ſtaffe, and keeping your
compaſſes at that wydeneſſe, put the firme foote of your Compaſſes
in the fixed Star, and ceaſe not to mooue the other foot together
with the quarter of altitude towards the mark of the Moones
altitude vntill you make them to méet, for there is the place of the
moone.
               
               
                  Another way to find out the place of the Moone without
taking the latitude of any without.
Propoſition. 48.
                  
                     SEeke by your croſſe ſtaffe to knowe the diſtance
betwixt the Moone and any two ſtars
that you know & are to be found in the globe.
That done, drawe vpon the globe on either
ſtarre an obſcure circle according to the diſtance
of the Moone from either of thoſe two
ſtars, which two circles will cut or croſſe one
another but in 2. points, the one whereof is
the place of the Moon, and which of thoſe places it ſhould be, your
eie will eaſilie tell you. And by this meanes it were no hard thing
(as Gemma Friſius ſatih) for our ſea men in theſe daies to finde
out all the ſtarres that be in the nether Hemiſpheare and were vnknowne

to Ptolomie and to the other auncient Aſtronomers, and
to cauſe them to be ſet downe in the Globe, yea and by this art the
places of the reſt of the Planets may be found out as well according
to their Latitude as Longitude.
                  Moreouer Gemma Friſius ſayth, that by knowing the true
place of the Moone in the Zodiaque, you may alſo finde out therby
the vnknowne Longitude of any Region.
               
               
                  How to finde out the Longitude of any Region.
The 49. Propoſition.
                  
                     HAuing found out the place of the Moone in the Zodiaque,
you muſt firſt know the very houre of her
being in that place, and then learne by ſome Ephemerides
or by the Tables of Alfonſus, at what
houre the Moone doth enter into the ſelfe ſame degrée
of the Zodiaque in ſome other Region or
Towne whoſe Longitude you alreadie knowe, and hauing reduced
the houres to 24. take the leſſer number of houres out of the
greater, the remainder whereof muſt be reduced out of houres
and minutes into degrées thus: Multiply the houres by 15. and
the minutes of houres by 4. ſo ſhall you haue the degrées of the
Equator contained betwixt the two Meridians. And ſuch diſtance
ſo intercepted is called the difference of Longitude, which
difference you muſt adde to the knowne Longitude if the houres in
that place were more in number, but if the houres were leſſe in
number, then you muſt ſubtract the foreſaide difference from the
knowne Longitude, ſo ſhall you collect the vnknowne Longitude
of that place or Region which you ſéeke, and how far it is diſtant
from the fortunate Iles.
               
               
                  Another way to find out the vnknowne Longitude of any
place by the Globe.
The 50. Propoſition.
                  
                     HAuing ſet the Globe at your Latitude and rectified the
houre-whéele by the ſeuenth Propoſition, bring the
place whoſe Longitude you know to the brazen Meridian,
and direct the Index of the houre-whéele to that

houre in which the Moone doth occupie the former defined place in
that Region or Towne: that done, leaue not to turne the Globe
vntill the Index of the houre-whéele come to that houre in which
you ſought the vnknowne place of the Moone, and the degrées of
the Equator which the brazen Meridian cutteth, wil ſhew the vnknowne
Longitude of the place which you ſéeke.
                  To the ende of this Treatiſe I haue thought good to adde a
briefe deſcription of the two great Globes lately ſet foorth firſt by
M. Sanderſon, and then by M. Molineux, and therewith to ſet
down a briefe deſcription of Sir Frances Drake his firſt voyage
into the Weſt and Eaſt Indies, and alſo the voyage of M. Tho.
Candiſh both whoſe voyages and what courſe they helde are to be
ſéene by helpe of two lines drawne on the terreſtriall Globe, of
which lines the one is redde ſhewing the voyage of Sir Frances
both outward and homeward. And the other line is blew ſhewing
in like manner the voyage of M. Candiſh.
                  
               
               
                  A briefe deſcription of the two great Globes lately ſet forth
firſt by M. Sanderſon, and then by M. Molineux.
                  
                     THeſe Globes doe differ in a maner nothing at all
from the Globes of Mercator touching the circles
before deſcribed, but only in the Horizon, for
the Horizon of theſe great Globes is deuided into
13. ſpaces as followeth.
                  Whereof the firſt narrow & innermoſt ſpace
next vnto the bodie of the Globe, containeth the degrées of the
Zodiaque.
                  The ſecond containeth the numbers of the ſaid degrées procéeding
from 10. to 30. in euery ſigne.
                  In the third ſpace are ſet downe the names and the characters
of the 12. ſignes, and alſo the characters of the Planets that gouerne
the ſaid ſignes.
                  In the fourth ſpace are ſet downe the letters of the dayes of the
wéeke.
                  In the 5. and 6. are ſet downe the numbers of the daies and
names of the monethes according to the auncient Calender.
                  
                     
In the ſeuenth the feſtiuall daies.
                  In the 8. and 9. ſpace the number of the daies and names of the
monethes according to the new Romain Calender.
                  In the 10. & 11. are ſet down the numbers of the daies & names
of the monethes according to the true Kalender lately calculated
by a moſt excellent Mathematician and mine old acquaintance M.
Dee of Mortlake, as I coniecture by the letters I. D. ſet downe
vpon the ſaid Horizon.
                  In the 12. are ſet downe the Engliſh names of the 32. Rombes
or windes of the Mariners compaſſe.
                  In the 13. and outermoſt ſpace are ſet downe the Latine names
of the ſaid 32. windes.
                  But the Mappe which couereth M. Molineux his Terreſtriall
Globe, differeth greatly from Mercator his terreſtrial Globe by
reaſon that there are found out diuers new places aſwel towards
the North pole, as in ye Eaſt & Weſt Indies which were vnknown
to Mercator. They differ alſo greatly in the names, Longitudes,
latitudes & diſtāces of ſuch places as haue bin heretofore ſet down
not only in Mercators Globe which was made many yeres ſince,
but alſo in diuers Maps more lately made, but who goeth nigheſt
the truth I dare not iudge, becauſe I was neuer in thoſe places.
But as touching the Map of ſtars which couereth the celeſtiall
Globe of M. Molineux, I do not finde it greatly to differ from
that of Mercator, ſauing that M. Molineux hath added to his celeſtiall
Globe certaine Southerne images, as the Croſſe, the ſoutherne
Triangle, and certaine other ſtars, whereof ſome do ſignifie
Noes Doue, & others do ſignifie the image called Polophilax,
the images whereof are not here ſet downe, but you ſhal find
them deſcribed in Plancius his Map, made in the yeare 1592.
whoſe longitudes, latitudes, and declinations, how truely they
are ſet downe in the ſaid Globe or Mappe I am not able to iudge.
He ſetteth downe alſo two cloudes nigh vnto the South pole, but
not the vſe thereof. Moreouer to this briefe deſcription of M. Molineux
his two Globes, I thought good to adde the firſt voyage of
Sir Frances Drake, and of M. Thomas Candiſh, ſet foorth by
two lines, the one redde, and the other blew deſcribed in the Terreſtriall
Globe of the ſaid M. Molineux, and alſo how farre Sir
Martin Furboſher ſayled Northward as followeth.
               
               
                  
                  The firſt voyage of Sir Frances Drake by ſea vnto the Weſt
and Eaſt Indies both outward and homeward.
                  
                     IN the great terreſtriall Globe lately put foorth by M.
Sanderſon and by M. Molineux, the voyage aſwel of
Sir. Fr. Drake, as of M. Th. Candiſh is ſet downe, &
ſhewed by helpe of two lines, the one red, & the other
blew, wherof the red line procéeding firſt frō 
                     Plymouth, doth ſhew
what courſe Sir Frances obſerued in all his voyage, aſwell outward
as homeward, and the blewe line procéeding alſo from Plymouth,
ſheweth in like maner the voyage of Maſter Candiſh, and
in that Globe is alſo ſet downe how farre Sir Martin Furboſher
diſcouered towards the North parts. But firſt I wil deſcribe vnto
you the voyage of Sir Fr. Drake that wrothie Knight & moſt Noble
Neptune, according as that red line directeth in ye ſaid Globe.
                  Firſt parting from Plymouth he ſayled with a North Northeaſt
winde to an Ile called Mogodore, vpon the coaſt of Maroccho,
which place is not named in M. Molineux his Globe,
and that place hauing in North Latitude 32. degrées, is diſtant
from Plymouth according to that courſe, which the redde line
ſheweth 780. leagues. In this Ile he built a little Pinnis or ſhallop,
and from thence he ſayled to Cape Dalguere which is further
Southward, and hauing in North Latitude 30. degrées, is
diſtant from Mogodore about 40. leagues, and from thence hee
ſailed to the Iles Canariae, which are ſomewhat more Weſtward,
and hauing 27. degrées in North Latitude, are diſtant from the
Cape Dalguere about 100. leagues, and from thence he ſayled
to Capo Blanco, which is more Weſternly, and hauing in North
Latitude 21. degrées, is diſtant from the Canaries 120. leagues
and ſomewhat more, and from thence he ſayled to the Iles of Capo
Verde, which hauing in North Latitude about 14. degrées,
are diſtant from Capo Blanco about 140. leagues. And frō thence
to the great Cape of S. Auguſtine, which hauing in South Latitude
about 8. deg. is diſtant from the Canaries 500. leagues, and
from thence he ſayled more Weſternly vnto ye mouth of the Riuer
called Rio de Platta, which hauing in South Latitude 36. degrées,
is diſtant from Cape Saint Auguſtine 740. leagues,
and from thence to the Port Saint Iuliano, hauing in South Latitude
about 50. degrées, whereas one Doughtie was executed

for conſpiracie, and this Port is diſtant from Rio de Platta 380.
leagues. And from thence he ſayled to the Cape Virgine Maria,
which hauing in South Latitude 52. degrées 30′· is diſtant from
Port S. Iulian 50. leagues, and from thence ſtréeking in betwixt
the Ile, whoſe Northeaſt Cape is called the Ile of the name of
Ieſus, and the Port Famine, he entred into the ſtraight Magellane,
which hauing in South Latitude 53. degrées 30′· is diſtant
from the Cape Virgine Maria 50. leagues, and from thence he
paſſed through the Magellane ſtraights to the Cape de Sancto
ſpirito, which is a Cape of the South land, hauing in South Latitude
52. degrées 20′· and is diſtant from Cape Virgine Maria
about 150. leagues, from thence he ſailed ſomewhat Weſternly
about 20. leagues, & there fetching a turne about certain Ilands
called Las Anegadas, he tooke his courſe Northward alongſt the
Weſt coaſt of America vnto ye Ile Lima, which hauing in South
Latitude 12. degrées, is diſtant from the Ilands called Las anegadas
800. leagues, and from thence he ſayled ſtill Northward
vnto Cape Guija, which hauing in South Latitude 1. degrée 30′·
is diſtant frō the Ile Lima 160. leagues, from thence ſtill Northward
he ſailed to Cape S. Franceſco, which hauing in North
Latitude 1. degrée 30. minutes, is diſtant from Cape Guija 140.
leagues, from thence he ſayled ſtil Northernly to the Cape Mondecino,
which is in the land called Quiuira, and this Cape hauing
in North Latitude 40. degrées is diſtant by that courſe from
S. Franceſco 1740. leagues, from thence he ſayled ſtill Northward
vnto a certaine Bay in the Weſt part of Quiuira, which he
named Noua Albion (that is to ſay) new Englande hauing in
North Latitude 46. degrées. And this was the furtheſt part of
his voyage outward, in which voyage hee ſayled in all 6050.
leagues, and from this Bay Sir Frances himſelfe (as I haue
heard) was of very good will to haue ſailed ſtill more Northward,
hoping to find paſſage through the narrow ſea Anian, which ſea
is not ſet downe by Maſter Molineux in his Terreſtriall Globe
as a ſtraight, but rather as a maine Sea, bearing in bredth 400.
leagues, and ſo from thence to haue taken his courſe Northeaſt,
and ſo to returne by the Iles Crocklande and Groynlande into
England, but his Mariners finding the coaſt of Noua Albion
to be very cold, had no good will to ſayle any further Northward,

wherefore Sir Frances was faine to come backe againe Southward
to Mondecino, which (as hath béene ſaid before) is diſtant
from the foreſaide Bay of Noua Albion 140. leagues. From
thence he ſayled in a manner right Southeaſt to the Iles Moluccas
and touched at the Iles Terenate, Tidori, Machian, and
Motill, which are nigh vnto the Ile Gilolo, which is right vnder
the Equinoctiall, amongeſt which Iles he remayned a certaine
time, of which Ilands the Ile called Terenate hauing about
one degrée of North Latitude, is diſtant by that courſe from the
Cape Mondecino 1180. leagues, and from thence hee ſayled
Southweſt vntill he came to the Weſt end of the Ile Iaua maior,
which hauing in South Latitude nine degrées 30. minutes, is diſtant
from the Ile Terenate by that courſe 530. leagues, and
from thence he ſayled ſtill Southweſt to the Cape di Buona Speranza,
which hauing in South Latitude 35. degrées, is diſtant
from Iaua maior 1630. leagues, then from Capo di Buona Speranza
he making his courſe Northweſt, ſailed to an Iland called
Serra Liona, which is vpon the coaſt of Afrique, and hauing in
North Latitude 7 degr. 30′· is diſtant from Capo di Buona Speranza
1090. leagues, then from thence he ſailed towards the Iles
of Capo verde vntil he came to the 12. degrée of North Latitude
right vnder the firſt Meridian, which point is diſtant from the Iland
Serra Liona according to that courſe 300. leagues, & from
thence he ſayled Northward nigh to the Iles called Azores on
the Weſt ſide therof, which hauing of North Latitude 40. degr.
are diſtant by that courſe from ye Iles of Capo verde 600. leagues
from whence he directed his courſe Northeaſt to Plimouth, which
hauing in North Latitude 51. degr. is diſtant by that courſe from
the Azores 490. leagues, ſo as in his returne from Noua Albion
to Plymouth he ſayled in all 5960. leagues, which if you adde to
the number of leagues of his outward voyage before ſet downe,
which is 6050. leagues, you ſhall finde the totall ſumme of the
leagues to be 12010. leagues, which is almoſt twice ſo much as
the compaſſe of the whole world, which if you meaſure vpon the
Globe by the Equinoctiall line containing 360. degrées, and doe
allow for euery degrée thereof 60. Italian miles, you ſhall finde
the number of ſuch miles to amount to 21600. miles, which by
allowing thrée miles to a league doe make no more but 7200.

leagues. But if it might pleaſe Sir Frances to write a perfect
Diarie of his whole voyage, ſhewing home much he ſayled in a
day, and what watring places he found, and where hee touched,
and how long he reſted in any place, and what good Ports and Hauens
he found, and what anchorage good or badde, and what maner
of people, what trade of liuing, and what kinde of building
and gouernement they vſed, in what aire they liued, and whether
the ground were fertile or barren, dry or well watered with floods
and fountaines, what mountaines, what mines, what woods or
forreſts, what beaſtes, fowles, or fiſhes, fruites, hearbes, plants,
or other commodities he founde therein, and in what manner of
ſeas he ſayled, and what windes and currents were moſt rife in
euery place: Alſo what rockes, ſandes, ſholdes, and all other
places of daunger and perill, and by what markes ſuch places
are to be ſhunned. And finally what Moone doth make a full ſea
in euery Port where he arriued, and what windes doe alter any
tide or Current, and all other neceſſary accidents moſt méete for
ſea men to knowe. In thus doing the ſaide Sir Frances I ſay
ſhould greatly profite his countrie men, and thereby deſerue immortall
fame, of all which things, I doubt not but that he hath
alreadie written, and will publiſh the ſame when he ſhall thinke
moſt méete.
               
               
                  The voyage of M. Candiſh vnto the Weſt and Eaſt
Indies, deſcribed on the Terreſtriall Globe
by the blew line.
                  
                     THis blew line as you ſée taketh his beginning
from Plymouth like as the redde line doth,
whereby you may plainely ſée, that M. Candiſh
did not greatly differ in his courſe from that
which Sir Frances helde, ſauing that Maſter
Candiſh hauing once paſſed the ſtraight Magellane
Weſtward, ſayled not ſo farre Northward as Sir Frances
did, for he ſayled no further Northwarde but to the Port
Saint Lucas, which is almoſt vnder the Tropique of Cancer,
for that Port hath in North Latitude 22. degrées 30′· kéeping alwaies
a nigher courſe vnto the maine, then Sir Frances did, and

from the Port S. Lucas he ſayled in a manner Southeaſt about
320. leagues, and then he directed his courſe Eaſtward towards
the Moluccas, & before he came to the Moluccas, he fetched about
the Ile Catana
                           ••
                        , which is more Northward then Sir Frances
went in thoſe partes, and from thence he ſayled full South to the
Moluccas, from whence he directed his courſe Southweſt, and
paſſed betwixt the Iles Iaua maior and Iaua minor, which two
Iles in the ſaid great Globe are made to haue one ſelfe Latitude
(that is to ſay about 10. degr. of South Latitude, counting from
the Equinoctiall to the Parallel which paſſeth through both the
Iles. But in all other Globes and Maps Iaua minor ſtandeth 10.
degrées more to the South, and is placed behinde the South promontorie
called the land of Beach. Then hauing paſſed betwixt
the foreſaid two Iles, he held in a manner the like courſe that Sir
Frances did in his returne to Plimouth, which the blew line doth
ſhew ſo plainely as it néedeth none other deſcription. Nowe as
touching Sir Martin Furboſhers voyage, becauſe his owne deſcription
thereof is in print, nothing is ſet downe in this Globe,
but only the outermoſt end of his voiage named here Furbuſhers
ſtraights, hauing in North Latitude about 63. degrées, in the
mouth of which ſtraights is a little Iland called Hales Iland on
the right hand, and on the left hand another little long Iland called
Leceſters point. Truely this knight for his valourous venter,
aſwell in this voyage as in diuers other his worthy ſeruices done
vpon the ſea deſerueth great commendation, and I wiſh with all
my heart that he and ſuch like might be much made of, and rewarded
according to their deſert. And thus I leaue to ſpeake any further
of M. Molineux his Globes, the vſe whereof is to be learned
by thoſe Propoſitions which I haue héeretofore ſet downe,
ſhewing the vſe of Mercator his two Globes, for the practiſe and
manner of working both by his Globes and by theſe Globes is all
one.

                  A plaine and full deſcription of Plancius
his vniuerſall Mappe, ſet foorth in the yeare
of our Lord, 1592. written in our mother
tongue by M. Blundeuill.
                  
                     IN this Mappe, as you ſée are drawne with
redde inke two lines or Diameters croſſing
one an other with right Angles in the verie
midſt of the Mappe, whereof the perpendicular
Diameter paſſing through the Iles Azores,
and alſo through the Iles of Capo verde,
ſignifieth the firſt Meridian and Axletrée of
the world, at the vpper end whereof is ſet the North pole, and at
the neather end the South pole. And the other ouerthwart Diameter
ſignifieth the Equinoctiall, & alſo the line of Eaſt & Weſt,
that is to ſay, Eaſt on the right hande, and Weſt on the left hand.
And in this line are ſet downe the degrées of Longitude, which
are to be counted from the foreſaid firſt Meridian vpon the ſaide
Equinoctiall towards your right hande from one degrée to 180.
ſet downe in Arithmeticall figures thus, 10. 20. 30. and ſo foorth
vntill you come to 180. which is the Eaſt Longitude of the world,
and the Weſt Longitude beginneth on your left hand whereas is
ſet downe 190. and then 200. and ſo foorth vntill you come to
360. degrées, which is the whole circuit of the Equinoctiall, and
of the whole earth. And in the firſt Meridian are ſet downe the
degrées of Latitude, which doe procéede from the Equinoctiall
to eyther of the Poles from one degrée to 90. written in Arithmeticall
figures thus, 5. 10. 15. and ſo foorth to 90. which
degrées doe procéede with equall diſtances from the Equinoctiall
to eyther Pole, and the like degrées of Latitude are alſo ſet downe
vpon the two outermoſt Meridians, aſwell on the right hande as

on the left. And on ech ſide of the Equinoctiall are drawne with
redde inke the two Tropiques, that is to ſaye, the Tropique of
Cancer, and the Tropique of Capricorne, ech one being diſtant
from the Equinoctiall 23. degrées 28′· which is the greateſt declination
of the ſunne, and towardes ech Pole are alſo drawne with
redde inke the two Circles both Arctique & Antarctique, whereof
the circle Arctique paſſeth through the Northernly part of Iſland,
hauing in Latitude 66. degrées 30′· and the Circle Antarctique
paſſeth through the like degrées of Latitude towardes the South
pole, and the diſtance of each of thoſe Circles from eyther Pole is
equall to the greateſt declination of the ſunne. And theſe foure
Circles are Parallels to the Equinoctial, bounding the 5. Zones
that is, the two cold, the two temperate, & the hotte Zone which
lyeth in the midſt of the world betwixt the two Tropiques. And
on the left hand or Weſt part of the Mappe are ſet downe from
the Equinoctiall vpward towards the North pole, what number
of miles and ſecondes of miles doe belong to euery degrée of the
North Latitude, procéeding from the Equinoctiall towards the
North pole: for though that euery degrée of the Equinoctiall being
a great Circle containeth 60. miles, yet the further that you
goe from the Equinoctiall towards either of the Poles, the leſſer
and leſſer are your Parallel Circles in compaſſe, and therefore
one degrée of euery ſuch Parallel muſt néedes containe the fewer
miles, but becauſe the ſea men doe commonly make their account
on the ſea by leagues, and not by miles: Plancius here right vnder
the former Table of miles, ſetteth downe the number of leagues
incident to euery degrée or Parallel, in deſcending from the Equinoctiall
to the South pole, appointing thrée miles to a league,
and therefore he ſetteth downe vppon the very Equinoctiall 20.
leagues, which is 60. miles, and next to that he ſetteth downe 19.
leagues 59′· and ſo procéedeth foorth diminiſhing ſtill the quantitie
of the leagues, euen till you come to the very South pole, and
on the right hand of the Map hard by the outmoſt Meridian are
ſet downe the nine Climes, and the longeſt day in euery degrée of
Latitude, procéeding aſwell from the Equinoctiall to the North
pole, as alſo from the Equinoctall to the South pole, from 12.
houres to 187. dayes and 7. houres, which maketh the longeſt
day to thoſe that dwell right vnder the North Pole to be halfe a

yeare and the night aſmuch. Beſides the Circles and lines before
mentioned, there are ſet downe in this Mappe certaine flyes
of the Mariners Compaſſe, each one containing two and thirtie
lines, which doe ſignifie the two and thirtie rombes or windes
of the Mariners Compaſſe to knowe thereby howe one place
beareth from another, and by what winde the Mariner hath to
ſayle to any place whereunto he would goe: In euery which fly
the line of North and South may ſerue in ſtead of a Meridian,
and the line of Eaſt and Weſt may ſerue as a Parallel, by helpe
whereof you may the more readily take with your Compaſſes
the Longitude and Latitude of any place contained in the Mappe
in ſuch manner as is taught in my firſt Treatiſe of Vniuerſall
Mappes. Alſo in the very front of his Mappe he ſetteth
downe the numbers of foure and twentie houres, euery houre
containing fiftéene degrées of the Equinoctiall, which houres
doe beginne on the right hande, and ſo procéede to the left, whereof
the twelfth houre is placed at the ende of that Meridian
which paſſeth through the Fortunate Iles. Nowe betwixt the
72. and 86. degrées of North Latitude hee ſetteth downe two
long Ilandes extending from the Weſt towardes the Eaſt
ſomewhat beyonde the firſt Meridian, and from the ſaide Meridian
more Eaſtwarde he ſetteth downe other two long Ilandes,
affirming that the North Ocean ſea breaking in betwixt theſe
Ilandes with ninetéene gates or entrances, maketh foure ſtraites
and is continually carryed vnder the North Pole, and there is
ſwallowed vp into the bowels of the earth, and he ſayth further
that right vnder the North pole there is a certaine blacke and
moſt high rocke which hath in circuit thirtie and thrée leagues,
which is ninetie and nine miles, and that the long Ilande next
to the Pole on the Weſt is the beſt and moſt healthfull of all the
North partes. Next to the foreſaid Ilandes more Southward
he ſetteth downe the Ilandes of Crockland and Groynelande
making them to haue a farre longer and more ſlender ſhape
then all other mappes doe: At the Eaſt ende of the third long
Ilande, is a ſtraite hauing fiue gates or entrances, which by
reaſon of their narrowneſſe and ſwift courſe of ſtreame are neuer
frozen, if this be true, I marueile howe any ſhippe durſt
enter through any of thoſe ſtraites to diſcouer the North ſides

of any of thoſe Ilandes, and how and where it came out againe.
Moreouer at the Eaſt ende of the laſt Ilande ſomewhat to the
Southwarde, he placeth the Pole of the Lodeſtone which is
called in Latine Magnes, euen as Mercator doth in his Mappe
who ſuppoſing the firſt Meridian to paſſe through Saint Marie
or Saint Machaell, which are two of the outermoſt Ilands of the
Azores Eaſtwarde, placeth the Pole of the ſtone in the ſeuentie
fiue degrée of Latitude, but ſuppoſing the firſt Meridian
to paſſe through the Ile Coruo, which is the furtheſt Ile of
the Azores Weſtwarde, hée placeth the Pole of the Lodeſtone
in the ſeuentie ſeuen degrée of Latitude, I thought good to ſeuer
the Ilands laſt before mentioned from the bodie of the Mappe
as partes belonging rather to the North pole, then to Europe,
Aſia, Africa, or America: for if Virgill did not let to ſay
that Englande was Penitus excluſa ab orbe, mee thinkes
that I may much more rightly ſay the like of theſe Ilandes,
notwithſtanding Plancius maketh the firſt two long Ilandes,
and alſo Groynelande and Crockelande to be part of Mexicana,
which mée thinkes is not méete, ſithe they be deuided
by the North Sea, likewiſe hée maketh the lande which is
vnder the South pole, and is not as yet diſcouered, to bee
part of Magellanica, which (in mine opinion) ought not to bée
ſo, ſith it is not onely deuided from Magellanica, by the ſtraight
Magellanicum, but alſo from Afrique, and from the Eaſt
Indies by the great Southerne Ocean, and I beléeue that
when the South lande ſhall bee all diſcouered, it will containe
twice ſo much lande as Magellanica doth, and then I
doubt not but that the Geographers will giue it ſome other
name, and make many diuiſions thereof: In the meane time
I will followe Plancius his owne diuiſion of the worlde, which
greatly differeth from that of Mercator, and of all other moderne
Geographers, for they doe deuide the whole earth but
into foure partes, that is to ſay, Europe, Afrique, Aſia, and
America, but Plancius by deuiding America into thrée partes
that is, into Mexicana, Peruana and Magellanica, deuideth
the whole earth into ſixe partes, that is to ſay, Europe, Aſia,
Afrique, and into the thrée partes of America laſt mentioned,
according to which diuiſion, he deſcribeth the earth in the french

tongue in ſixtéene pages, ſet downe at the foote of his Mappe,
the foure laſt pages whereof doe onely containe the interpretation
of the ſeuentie one little Tables or Inſcriptions written
in the Latine tongue, diſperſed throughout the whole Mappe,
expreſſing therein ſuch thinges as hee thought moſt méete to bee
noted in diuerſe partes of the worlde, all which Tables or inſcriptions,
I haue héere alſo ſet downe in our mother tongue:
And although that to the foreſaide Tables or Inſcriptions
Plancius hath attributed certaine numbers for the more eaſie
finding out of the ſayde inſcriptions, yet not eaſie inough by
reaſon that one ſelfe number is ſet downe in diuerſe Tables,
and therefore to the intent that you might the more readily
finde out euery Table that is proper to the matter whereof it
maketh mention, I haue here following ioyned to the number
of euery ſuch Table, his proper Longitude and Latitude,
which with your Compaſſe you may quickly finde out, and
more certainely, then by his numbers, if you remember the
order thereof ſet downe in my Treatiſe of vniuerſall Mappes.
But now I will declare the contentes of the foreſaide ſixtéene
pages in order as followeth.
                  
                     The title of the firſt page is thus.
                     A briefe declaration of the diuiſion, forme or
ſhape, and of the particularities of the world.
                     The Contents of the firſt page.
                     
                        THat the earth and the water doe make both together
one rounde bodie, which the Coſmographers
doe inuiron with fiue Circles, that is the
Equinoctiall, the two Tropiques, and the
two Polar Circles, and thereby doe deuide
the worlde into fiue Zones, two colde, two temperate,
and one extreme hotte: and though that the auncient
Geographers doe affirme that thrée of thoſe Zones were vnhabitable,
the one for extremitie of heate, and the other two
for extremitie of colde, yet within theſe hundred yeares laſt paſt

it is knowne by good experience that thoſe thrée Zones are well
inhabited as the manifolde Countryes therein placed and greatly
repleniſhed with people of ſundry languages doe well teſtifie,
of all which thinges I haue written at large in my Spheare.
And therefore I make this page the ſhorter.
                  
                  
                     The Contents of the ſecond Page.
                     
                        TO knowe the true ſituation of the Prouinces and
places contained in this Mappe, it is neceſſarie
firſt to knowe their Longitudes and Latitudes.
The degrées of Latitude or of the eleuation
of the Pole, which is all one thing, are
counted from the Equinoctiall to eyther Pole,
which is 90. degrées, and the degrées of Longitude are counted
vpon the Equinoctiall from the Iles of Capo Verde towardes
the Eaſt, and ſo round about the earth vntill you come to the
number of 360. degrées. The Prouinces and Townes that are
ſituated vnder one degrée of Longitude, haue at one ſelfe time
like houres of the day, but thoſe that are ſituate vnder diuerſe
degrées of Longitude, doe differ in number of houres, for when
it is in one Towne noonetide, it is in an other Towne that is diſtant
from thence towardes the Eaſt 30. degrées two of the clocke
in the afternoone, and ſo conſequently for euery 15. degrée of diſtance
they differ one houre. Likewiſe they that dwell vnder one
ſelfe degrée of Latitude haue equall quantitie of dayes and
nightes, but yet ſo as they which dwell on the South ſide of the
Equinoctiall haue the ſhorteſt day when wee haue the longeſt,
and haue Winter when we haue Sommer. But thoſe that are
ſituate vnder diuerſe degrées of Latitude, haue inequalitie of
dayes and nights, for the nigher that any place is ſituate towardes
any of the Poles the more houres the longeſt day of the
yeare in that place containeth. But thoſe that dwell right vnder
the Equinoctiall haue alwayes their dayes and nightes of
like quantitie, and I vnderſtande here by the daye, the ſpace
betwixt the ſunne riſe and the ſunne ſet, and you ſhall finde the
quantitie of the longeſt day of the yeare in euery degrée of Latitude
ſet downe in the Northeaſt part of this Carde. As for example

to thoſe that haue 30 degrées of latitude, the longeſt day is
13. houres 57′· and ſo the nigher that you go to the Pole the longer
is the day, in ſo much as to thoſe that dwell right vnder the
Pole, the yeare is but a day and a night, that is to ſay, they haue 6.
moneths day, & 6. months night. Moreouer the Geographers do
diuide the earth into 9. climes for to diſtinguiſh therby the prouinces
and regions by the quantity of the longeſt day, the middlemoſt
parallel of euery clime increaſing by halfe an houre, and you haue
to conſider that the degrées of latitude are in all places of like bignes
euery degrée contayning 15. Almain leagues, or 60. Italian
miles, but the degrées of longitude procéeding from the Equinoctiall
towards any of the 2. Poles are vnequall, that is to ſay, euerie
one containing fewer leagues or miles than other, but the
degrées of the Equinoctiall it ſelfe are equall to the degrées of latitude,
euerie one containing 15. Germaine leagues or 60. Italian
miles, as you may plainly ſée in the Table ſet downe in the
Northweſt part of this Map. And you haue to note that one Almaine
league doth contain 4. Italian miles, and we haue deſcribed
the degrées of longitude in the Southweſt part of this Carde
by the houres of the ſhips way, euery one decreaſing leſſe than other
from the Equinoctiall to the Pole, whereby you may conceiue
that two ſhips being right vnder the Equinoctiall 150.
degrées diſtant one from another, and are to ſaile with like gate
towards the North pole: when they ſhall come to the 60. degrée
of latitude, their diſtance ſhall be no more but 75. leagues. And
the further they goe towards the Pole the leſſe diſtant they ſhall
be one from another, in ſo much as when they be right vnder the
Pole it ſelf, they ſhall both méete, as you may ſée in the 2. rounde
figures contayning the deſcription of the earth, and ſet downe in
the 2. nether corners of the Map. This matter is to bee conſidered
of the Mariners that they may thereby the better perceiue
the imperfections of their ſea Cardes. Moreouer, in the ſecond
page Plancius ſetteth downe the diuiſion of the earth as
well according to the ancient as moderne Geographers, making
firſt thrée generall continents or firme lands, whereof the firſt
is ſo much as was knowne to Ptolomey and to the ancient Aſtronomers,
as Enrope, Afrique, and Aſia, the ſecond conti
                        
                           •
                        ent
is called America, and the third continent is the South part

of the world, not yet fullie diſcouered, called of Plancius Magellanica,
and he diuideth the ſecond continent called America into
thrée parts, that is, Mexicana, Pervana, and Magellanica, and
by adding thoſe thrée parts to Europe, Afrique, and Aſia, he diuideth
the earth into ſixe partes, and firſt he ſetteth downe the
deſcription of Europe together with her boundes or limittes, and
then the commodities thereof, as followeth.
                     
                        Of Europe.
                        
                           EVrope is farre leſſe than all the reſt, and yet exceedeth all
others in nobleneſſe, in magnificencie, in multitude of people,
in might, puiſſance, and renowne, the which in times
paſt hath commanded both Aſia and Afrique as Quéene,
by reaſon of the Monarchies of the Gréekes and of the Romans,
and at this day is of great force by the power of the Turkes
and Muſcouites. Moreouer it commandeth many prouinces in
Mexicana and Pervana by the power of the Spaniards and Portugals,
and of other Chriſtian Princes.
                        
                           Europe is ſeuered from Aſia and Afrique by the ſea Mediterraneun
                                 •
                              ,
and by the ſea called Marmagior, and by the Mariſh
or ſea called Palus Meotis, and by the Flood Tanais and Dwina.
The chiefeſt prouinces of Europe are theſe, Almanie, Italy
France, Spaine, Denmarke, Norway, Swethland, Muſcouia,
Polonia, Hungaria, Sclavonia, and Greece. The chiefeſt Ilandes
of Europe are theſe, England with Scotland, Ireland,
Sardinia, Corſica, Sicilia, Candia, Nigro Ponte ſometime
called Euboia, and Stalimene ſometime called Lemnos. And in
this ſecond page hée ſetteth downe alſo the diſcription of Almanie
thus.
                        
                           Almanie is reputed to bee the greateſt prouince in all Europe,
and is ſituated in the middeſt thereof, which is bounded
on the Eaſt with Polonia and Hungaria, on the South with
Dalmacia, and Italia, and on the Weſt with France, and on
the North with the North Sea, and with the Sea called
Mare Balticum. The inhabitantes of this Countrey warre
                              •
                           
in olde time with the Romanes for their libertie, and ſince
manie hundred yeares paſt it hath holden the imperiall Scepter.

About the time of Chriſt his birth, it was a rude countrey, as
Cornelius Tacitus ſaith, full of Wood, buſhes, and mariſhes,
but at this day it is ſo adorned with great magnificent Townes
and well fortified, and is furniſhed with ſuch a number of Caſtles,
and Villages, and with ſuch a number of people, and
with ſuch pollitique gouernement, as it is to bee compared
to any prouince whatſoeuer in all the worlde. The ſoyle
thereof is verie fruitfull both for corne and Wine, and hath
manie nauigable Floods ſtored with plentie of Fiſh. It hath
moſt excellent Fountaines, and hotte bathes, greate mines of
Golde, of Siluer, copper, Tinne, Lead, and Iron. The inhabitants
doe exerciſe as well nowe as they haue done in times paſt
the Art military, and it hath manie learned men verie ſkilful in
all ſciences, and in Mechanicall artes, they were the inuenters
of Artillerie, of Gunpowder, and of the noble Arte of printing,
and of making artificiall dials and horologies.
                        The chiefe merchandizes that are tranſported out of Almanie
into other countreys are theſe, Golde, Siluer, Copper,
Tinne, Leade, vitrioll, Allum, Quickeſiluer, Collours of diuers
ſortes, Slates to couer houſes, Wheat, Wine, Fiſh, woollen
cloath, Linnen cloath, Bombaſine, Fuſtian, Suile, Armour,
all ſortes of workes made of Iron, or braſſe, and other merceries.
                     
                  
                  
                     The Contentes of the third page.
                     
                        IN the thirde Page hée deſcribeth the 17. Prouinces
of the lowe Countries, alſo Italie, France, Spaine
and Denmarke, as followeth.
                     THe 17. Prouinces of the lowe Countries are counted a part
of Almanie, by reaſon that the moſt part of the inhabitantes
haue as well their originall as their language from the Almanes.
But thoſe of Artoys, of Henough Namures, and parte
of the inhabitantes of Brabant, Flaunders, Lymburgh, and
Liezenburgh doe ſpeake the French tongue. Theſe prouinces
are ſituated partly within the ancient limits of Almany, that is to
ſay, beyond the Orientall part of the Flood Rhenus, & partly in
Gallia Belgica, as alſo are the prouinces of the 4. princes electors

and of manie other prouinces of the Empire. In theſe prouinces
are manie nauigable Floods and rich in fiſh, namelie the
Rheane, Moſella, Moſa, and the Eſcaut, and there is great aboundance
of all ſorts of corne and cattell meete for mans vſe,
there is alſo a number of great Townes rich, mightie, and well
peopliſhed, alſo of fortreſſes well fortified, faire Villages, but
chieflie of braue and commodious portes and hauens, and an incredible
number of ſhippes, and the continuall warres that they
haue had and haue at this day do witneſſe to all the world their
great force, might, and riches. The inhabitantes in time of
the Romaine Monarchie were and alſo are at this preſent greatlie
renowmed for their ſkill in the arte militarie, and beſides
that, they are moſt excellent and induſtrious in all ſciences and
mechanicall artes, and they haue a great number of Mariners
and Pilots well practized in the arte of Nauigation, and to
theſe prouinces is attributed the inuention of the Mariners
Compaſſe, according to the opinion of manie learned men, which
trulie is one of the nobleſt inuentions that euer was found out
ſince the world beganne. In the towne of Brugheſſe was inuented
the Arte of Painting with Collours tempered with
Oyle.
                     The Prouinces of Belgia doe ſende vnto other Prouinces
all ſortes of Cloathes made of Woolle and Flaxe, linnen cloath
of Cambria, Skarlettes interlaced with golde, Siluer, and
Silke, Taffatas, Borattas, Grograines, ſingle Buffin, Sayes
of Leyden, and Howſcot, Worſteds, and halfe Worſteds, Fuſtianapes
of Vellures, and of Wool, Bayes, ſilk, parchment lace,
Sarcenet and inkle, all manner of twiſted thred ſilke ready dreſt,
purified Sugar, Buffe, Shamoyes, ſtryped Marokines, painted
Pictures, Bookes, Armour, Cables, Ropes, and
other Munitions belonging to Shippes, Kniues, Pinnes,
and all ſortes of Mercerie or Haberdaſh ware, and Fiſh dried
and ſalted.
                     
                        ITalie being the mother of eloquence and of al Latine erudition
doth extende it ſelfe like an arme towards the Southeaſt, lying
betwixt the Tuſcane ſea and the gulfe of Venice, & is bounded
on the weſt part with France, & on the north part with Almany
                        
being ſeperated from the ſayd two prouinces by the Flood Varo
and the Alpes, and al the reſt is inuironed with the ſea, at the time
of the natiuitie of Chriſt and ſince, ſhe moſt flouriſhed, being adorned
with the fourth Monarchie, and with the moſt mightie
towne of Rome, which at that time was Quéene of many prouinces,
of Europe, Aſia, and Afrique, which citie in the time of
the Emperour Veſpaſian, had in circuit 13. Italian miles and
200. paces, as Plinie writeth in his third booke and fift chapter,
Flauius Vopiſcus reciteth that this towne was inlarged by the
Emperour Aurelius to 30. Italian miles, which is 10. houres
of way or gate, allowing thrée mile for an houre. This Prouince
hath brought foorth, as it doth at this preſent, inhabitants
of great induſtrie and wit, and it contayneth many noble cities
and of great renowme, as Rome, which hath bene ſometime the
head of the world, Venice the rich, Rauenna the ancient, Naples
the gentle, Florence the beautifull, Genua the proud, and Milaine
the great. In a town called Amalphe ſituate vpon the ſea,
betwixt Naples and Salerno, the Mariners Compaſſe was inuented,
in the yeare 1300. according to the opinion of ſome, by
one Iohn Goia, citizen of the ſame towne: notwithſtanding Iohn
Gorop Becanus doth attribute that inuention to Flaunders which
ſéemeth the more likelie, for ſo much as al the Pilats & Mariners
of France and Spaine and other places do name the 32. windes
or rombes of the Compaſſe by the Belgicke names. The chiefe
marchandizes that are ſent out of Italie into other countries are
theſe, Rice, Silke, Veluet, Satten, Taffatas, fine péeces of
Linnen, Grograines, Raſh, Stamin, Bombaſins, Fuſtians,
Feltes to make riding cloakes, plentie of rich armour, Wiar of
golde and ſiluer, Allum, Galles, drinking glaſſes and looking
glaſſes of Venice.
                     
                     
                        FRance hath bene alwayes eſtéemed to be the chiefeſt realme
of all Europe, whoſe ſoyle is moſt fertile, and bringeth
forth all kinde of Graine, and euerie other thing that is neceſſarie
for mans ſuſtenance, there is great ſtore of wine,
and great plentie thereof is diſtributed to other Prouinces nigh
adioyning. The Prouince doeth abounde in oyle Oliue, and in
Corrall, and in many other noble fruites. In France are many

great townes well walled, as Paris, Roan, Amiens, Orliens,
Tours, Nantes, Poicters, Burghes, Tholous, Lyon, Na
                              •
                           bona, &
Marcelles. It hath 15. Archbiſhoprickes, and 108. Biſhoprickes,
and a great number of townes and villages, and 132000
pariſhes, it is greatlie peopled, and hath not ſuch deſertes or
heathes as are in other prouinces of Europe, the French men
haue bene, and are at this preſent renowmed in the Arte militare,
and there be manie learned men in all faculties and ſciences.
                     The chiefe Merchandizes that are caried out of France into
other prouinces are theſe, Wheate, Rie, Beefs, Hogges Swine,
and other cattell, Salt, wines, wilde Oliue, Cheſſnuts, Almonds,
Prunes, Corrall, Diers wadde, Clothes, linnen, Canuas and
Skinnes.
                     
                        SPaine is inuironed round about with the Sea, ſauing that
on one ſide it is ſeperated from France by the mountaines
Perenei. This countrey was ſometime diuided into thrée
Prouinces or kingdomes, that is, Taraconenſis, Luſitania
and Betica, but now it is ſubdiuided into many Realmes, that is
to ſay, Caſtilia, Aragon, Portugall, Gallicea, Lyon, Navarra,
Toledo, Valentia, Murcia, Granado, Cordoa, and Algarbia,
the which Realmes if they had bene reduced to one bodie of a
Realme, as France is, and as they be at this houre ſubiect to one
only king and Lord, it ſhould bee without doubt one of the moſt
mightie and puiſſant kingdomes of Europe. The inhabitantes
of Spaine haue bene and are at this preſent much renowmed in
the art militare, and in feates of warre, and it hath brought forth
in times paſt many great Clearkes, as Seneca, Quintilian, Lucan
and Martial, and in our time it had Iohannes Lodovicus
Viues, Iohannes Oſorius, and Benedictus Arias Montanus.
The prouinces of Spaine are become verie rich and mightie, by
reaſon of their nauigatiō into America, Africa, Arabia, Perſia,
India, the Iles Moluecas and China, in which Prouinces (China
excepted) the king of Spaine poſſeſſeth manie countries that
be rich and of great power, and many townes and fortreſſes in a
manner round about the earth.
                     The chiefe Merchandizes that grow in Spaine, and are carried
into other Countries are theſe, wines, Oyles, Rice, all ſorts

of fruites of Spaine, Liquoras, Silke, great quantity of wolle,
Lambe ſkinnes, Corke, Roſin, Stéele, Iron and Armour.
                     
                        DEnmarke and Norway are verie great Regions, and are
as large as the countries of Almany, bordering vpon
Almany towardes the South, they extend towards the
North to 71. degrée 30′· of North latitude, and towards
the Eaſt they border vpon Swethland, and on the weſt and North
ſide they are inuironed with the ſea. Theſe two Realmes are at
this day vnder the gouernment of one only king, who alſo is lord
of Iſland and of the Iles of Fero, Hitland, and Gothland.
Iuthland was ſometime the habitation of the Cimbres, who in
times paſt made cruell warres againſt the Romanes.
                     The Merchandizes ſent from the two forſaid realmes into other
prouinces are theſe, Oxen, Barly, Malt, ſtockfiſh, tallowe,
nuttes and Filberds, hydes of Oxen, and Bucke ſkinnes, Maſtes

                           SWethland is a great and mightie realme, bordering
towards the Eaſt vpon Ruſsia, and towardes
the South vpon the Eaſt ſea, called Mare Balticum,
diuiding Swethland from Almany and Pomerania,
and towards the weſt vpon Norway and
Denmarke, and towards the North vpon Finmarke. Stockholme
is the Metropolitane citie in this realme, wherein the king
kéepeth his court. From this realme is tranſported into other

THe kingdome of Polonia containeth Lituania, Podolia,
the leſſer Ruſsia, Volhinia, Maſſouia, Samogitia, Pruſſia,
and in a manner all Liuonia, which two laſt Prouinces
did belong not long ſince to Almania. Polonia is bounded
on the Eaſt with Muſcouia and with the Tartaries, Perocopſiques,
and on the South with Moldania, and Hungaria and
towards the Weſt with Almania, and towards the North with
the ſea Baltique and Muſcouia.
                     
                     The chiefe merchandizes that go out of this realme into other
Prouinces are theſe, Wheate, Rie, and other graine, Spruſe or
Danske Beare, yellow Amber, Waxe honie, a certaine drinke
made of Hony which we call Meade, hydes of Oxen dryed and
ſalted, Flaxe, Hempe, Pitch, and Tarre, Aſhes, Clauellees, wood
Mazier, and of Cuvelier, and other ſuch like merchandizes.
                     
                        HVngarie is a verie fruitfull Realme, rich and mightie, and
it is bounded on the Eaſt with Moldauia, and Valachia,
and on the South with Boſnia and Croacia, & on the Weſt
with Almania, and on the North with Polonia, it hath manie nauigable
riuers, wherein are great ſtore of fiſh, that is to ſay, Danubius,
Dravus, Savus, and Tibiſtus. The chiefe townes are
theſe, Buda, Gran, Weiſſenburgh, Rab, Prezburgh, Agria,
Colocza, and Belgrada. The inhabitants of this countrey are
warlike and hardie, and haue bene long time heretofore a moſt
faithfull Rampyre and Bulwarke to all Chriſtendome, but in the
end by reaſon of their ciuill warres, the better part of them haue
bene ſubdued in our time, and are made moſt miſerable ſlaues
to the Turke.
                     The Merchandizes which goe out of Hungarie into other
Prouinces are theſe, Golde, Siluer, Copper, and diuers ſorts of
Collours, Salt, Wine, Wheat, Beefs, and freſh fiſh of the riuer

                        SClauonie is bounded on the Eaſt with Bulgaria, and
Greece, and on the South ſide with the Gulfe of Venice,
and on the Weſt, with the North parte of Italie, and on
the North ſide with Almanie and Hungarie. This Region
containeth manie particular Prouinces as Liburnia, Croacia
Boſnia, and Balmatia, the chiefe townes whereof are theſe, Raguza,

Salona, Sabenica, and Zara. Sclauonie at this time is
diuided into manie iuriſdictions, for one great part thereof is
ſubiect to the Turke, another part to the Emperour of Almany,
and the reſt ſituated vpon the ſea coaſt is ſubiect to the Seniorie
of Venice. At this day there is no tongue (the Arabie tongue
excepted) that extendeth further than the Sclauonie tongue, for
as it is the Vulgar tongue of Sclauonie, ſo is it familiar to them
of Hiſtria, Bohemia, Morauia, Sileucia, Polonia, and to the
large Prouinces of the great Duke of Muſcouia, Circaſsia, Perihoka,
Georgiana, Mengrelia, Moldauia, Valachia, Bulgaria,
Ruſsia, Seruia, Albania, and to part of Hungarie, that is

                        GReece ſometime the mother of all ſcience and erudition, is
on the Eaſt, South and Weſt ſide inuironed with the ſea,
but on the North ſide it is bounded with Seruia and Bulgaria,
it hath in times paſt valiantly fought with and beaten
the Monarchie of Perſia for the libertie of their countrie, and
finallie by Alexander the great hath triumphed ouer the ſame,
and thereby erected the third Monarchie, by meanes whereof it
came to paſſe that the Gréek tongue was made common throughout
Aſia, Syria, and Aegypt, vntill ſuch time as the Saracens and
the great Turke did corrupt and change the ſame. The Emperours
did rule in Greece from the time of Conſtantine the great
vnto the yeare 1542. in which yeare Mahomet the great Turke
forced the towne of Conſtantinople, and aboliſhed the Empire
of Greece in ſuch ſort, as euer ſince this magnificent and ſtrong
imperiall towne of the Chriſtians, hath bene the ſeat of the Emperour
of Turkie, and all the countrey made ſlaues to the Mahometanes.
                     The chiefe merchandizes that come from this countrie to other
Prouinces are theſe, Gold, Siluer, Copper, Vitrioll, diuers
ſorts of collours, wines, Oyle, Veluets, Damaſks, Grograins,

                        ENgland together with Scotland making both but one Iland
is the greateſt and mightieſt of all Europe. And England
                        
is enuironed on all ſides with the ſea, ſauing on the North
ſide, which bordereth vpon Scotland. The aire according to the
ſituation is indifferent temperate, for though it be more Northward
than Flaunders, yet it is not ſubiect to ſuch hard froſtes
and cold winters. The ſoyle is verie fruitfull, bringing foorth
great plenty of wheate and of other corne, it hath great plenty
of fruit trées, and there be many large and faire woods, ſwéete
fountaines, floods and riuers full of fiſh, and a number of good
hauens, alſo it hath many ritch Mines, as of Golde, Siluer,
Lead, Iron, and chiefly of fine Tinne, wherefore it may be worthily
counted amongſt the moſt puiſſant and richeſt Ilandes of
the world. This Iland nouriſheth alſo a great nūber of cattel méet
for mans vſe, and chiefly of ſhéepe, which yéeldeth fine and good
wooll, in which partly conſiſteth the profite and riches of the
countrey, in ſuch ſort, as the golden Fléece ought to haue bene
ſought for in this Iland, and not at Cholcos. The inhabitants
moſt commonly are tall of ſtature, beautifull and white of viſage,
couragious and méet for the warre, alſo they are ingenious
and ſtudious in the Arte of nauigation, in ſo much as in
theſe dayes they haue traffique into verie farre countreyes, as
into Greece, Natolia, Syria, Aegypt, Barbarie, Muſcouia, and
into manie other prouinces. London being ſituated vpon the
Thames is the Metropolitane and chiefe towne of this Realme,
and the Staple of the trade of Merchandizes, and the Courte
royall, but Cambridge and Oxford are Vniuerſities.
                     The Merchandizes ſent from England into other prouinces
are theſe, broad Cloaths, Carſies, Stamines, Bayes, Sayes,
Saffron, Tin, Leade, Wheate, Barley, Malte, Beare, red Hearing,
ſea Cole and wood.
                     
                        SCotland is the North part of this Iland, and is likwiſe inuironed
round about with the ſea, ſauing on that ſide with
which it bordereth vpon England. This Countrey is not ſo
fruitfull as England, notwithſtanding it is ſufficiently prouided
of all things that is néedfull for mans nutriment, it is watred
with diuers armes of the Sea, and is indued with many
mountaines full of graſſe, which ſerueth to féede their cattell. Edenburgh
is the Metropolitane citie of this realme, wherein the

kéepeth his court. The Scottiſhmen are good Souldiers, which
can endure ſcarſitie and the iniuries of the aire, and are very deſirous
to win honour. The inhabitants of the South part thereof
doe ſpeake the Engliſh tongue: but thoſe of the North, and thoſe
of the Iles Hebrides doe vſe the Iriſh tongue, and thoſe of the
Orcades doe vſe the Norway tongue.
                     The Merchandizes which Scotland ſendeth to other countries
are theſe, courſe clothes, Karſies, Stamins, Freeſes, Wool, Barlie,
Malt, Fiſh, Hydes, leaden Owre, and Smithes cole.

                        IReland is nigh vnto England and Scotland, and is very rich
in meddow ground, and hath great plentie of cattell as well
tame as wilde, and fiſh as well of the ſea, as of freſh riuers, and
greate quantity of foule and birdes, but it hath ſcarſitie of
corne by reaſon of the great moiſtneſſe of the ayre. This Ile
is frée from all venemous beaſtes, the inhabitantes are wilde
people, great and ſtrong, and ſwift in running, and by little and
little they waxe euery day tamer than other, vnder the gouernement
of the Engliſh men.
                     THe Iles of Azores are called of the Flemiſh Pilots & Marriners
the Flemmiſh Iles, becauſe thoſe of Burghes were the
firſt that diſcouered thoſe Ilands, & albeit that at this preſent the
inhabitants thereof are Portugales, there is yet a remnant of
Flemmiſh families, as of the Bruines, of the Vltrickts & others.
Theſe Iles are fruitfull, and bee 9. in number, that is to ſay, the
Ile of S. Marie, S. Michael, Tercera, Gracioſa, S. George,
Pico, Fayal, Flores, and Coruo.
                     
                     
                        Tercera amongſt all the reſt is the ſtrongeſt, & bringeth foorth
diers Wad. The Ile of S. Michael bringeth foorth Sugar, and
great aboundance of good Diers Wad.
                     
                        
                        COrſica is ſituate in the ſea Mediterraneum, and bringeth
foorth moſt excellent wines, rough Horſes, and great hunting
dogges: and this Ile is gouerned by the Genueſes.
                     
                     
                        SArdinia is a verie fruitfull Ile, and chiefly of Wheat, which
is tranſported from thence into Italie and into Spaine, likewiſe
it hath very good Wine, both red and white, and verie
good Salt, it hath alſo certaine mines of ſiluer, but not of ſo
profitable yéeld as in times paſt. The inhabitantes are ſtrong,
and able to indure great labour and trauell. In great townes
they ſpeake the Spaniſh tongue of Aragon, but in ſmall townes
they ſpeake the vulgar tongue of the Ile.
                     
                        SIcilia hath bene alwayes famous, and is called of Diodorus
the Paragon of Iles, alſo the Gréekes and the Latines
haue greatly celebrated this Ile in their writings. This Iland
hath great aboundance of Wheat and of al other grain,
alſo of wine, Sugar, waxe, Honey, Saffron, Silk, and of all things
els appertaining to the vſe of man. Wherefore this Ile, together
with Aegypt was ſometime called the Grange of the Romanes.
In this Iland is the hil Aetna, which alwayes burneth, and in the
ſea of Sicill nigh vnto Drepano, as Plinie writeth in his 32.
booke and ſecond chapter, there groweth verie faire redde Corall,
in ſhape like to ſuch a trée or buſh as is here figured, which while
it is vnder the water is gréene and tender, but ſo ſoone as it commeth
into the aire, it waxeth hard like a ſtone, and is red, there
is found thereof alſo nigh vnto the ſea coaſt of Prouince, alſo in
Italie nigh vnto Monte Alto, and to Naples, likewiſe in the red
ſea, and in the Gulfe of Perſia, and there be three ſorts of Corral,
that is, red, blacke, and white.
                     
                        CAndia ſometime called Creta, was in olde time enritched
with the famous Labyrinth, and with a hundred cities, it
had alſo a great number of good ſhips and expert Pilots,
this Ile together with the others, as the Ile of Zante, Cephalonia,
Corfue, and diuers others, be at this preſent gouerned
by the Senate of Venice.

                        NIgro Ponte, ſometime called Euboia, is a verie fruitfull
Ile in Wheate, Oyle and Wine.
                     
                        STalimene ſometime called Lemnos, is an Ile which hath
aboundance of wheate, and moſt excellent Wines. In this
Ile they digge out in the moneth of Auguſt a certaine medicinable
earth called of the Phyſitians Terra ſigillata. There
be manie other Iles beſides theſe in Europe, as the Iles of Denmarke,
the Iles of Zeland in Flanders, the Ile Frumentera, Iuica
Maiorica and Minorica, and a number of Iles that are in
Sclauonie and Greece.
                     
                     
                        ASia is ſeperated frō 
                        Europe by the floods Tanais & Dwina
& from Afrique by the narrow part of land, which is nigh
to Aegypt, betwixt the Mediterrane ſea, & the red ſea. Aſia
far excéedeth in greatnes both Europe, Afrique, and Pervana,
and alſo in riches, as in pearles of great price, and precious
ſtones and ſpyces it excéedeth all the other countries of the world.
                     This region hath bene alwayes renowmed by the firſt and ſecond
Monarchie of the world, obtained by the Syrians & the Perſians,
as alſo it is at this day by the mightie Princes of China,
and of Perſia, and by the puiſſancie of the Tartarians.
                     
                     In this part of the world man was created of God, placed in
Paradice, ſeduced by Sathan, and redéemed by our Sauiour Ieſus
Chriſt, and in this region, were done in a maner all the hiſtories
and actes mentioned in the old Teſtament, and a great part
of thoſe of the newe Teſtament. The moſt celebrated prouinces
of Aſia are thoſe that belong to the great Duke of Muſcovia, alſo
Tartaria and China, the rich prouince of India, as Guzarette,
Coraſan, Sigiſtan, Chirmania, Parthia, Perſia, Media, Aſſyria,
Armenia, Natolia Syria, and Arabia. The principall Iles
of Aſia are theſe, Iapan, Luconia, Mindanao, Borneo, Sumatra,
Ceilan, and Cypres, for as for the Iles of Gilolo, Moluccas
Banda & Celebes, they belong to that part of the world which is

called Magellanica.
                     
                     The moſt mightie Potentates of Aſia are theſe, the king of
China, the king of Perſia, the great Turke, and the Emperour

                           CHina or Sina is the thirde part of Aſia, ſomtime
called of Ptolomy Sinacum regio, which on the Eaſt
ſide is enuironed with the ſea called of the ancient
Geographers Oceanns Sicicus, or the eaſt Ocean,
and on the Weſt it is bounded with the Indies and with Brumas,
& on the North with Tartaria. This countrey is for many cauſes
eſtéemed to bée the moſt ample, the richeſt & moſt mightie Realme
of all the world, for it extendeth from the 18. degrée to the 55. degrée
of North latitude, and it containeth in longitude 450.
leagues of Almanie, and it is diuided into 15. great prouinces or
Realmes, that is, Quincii, otherwiſe called Paquin, Xanton,
Xiancii, Sancii, Suchuan, Honao, Nanquii, Chequiam, Foquiem,

leaſt Metropolitane cities of the Realme, and yet it contayneth
in circuite 12. Italian miles, and 350. Geometricall paces,
which is more than foure houres iourney, not reckoning the ſuburbs,
which are verie large and full of people. The principall
Metropolitane towne where the King kéepeth his court, is named
Paquine, or Suntie, that is to ſay in their tongue, the celeſtiall
or heauenlie citie, touching the greatneſſe whereof, the Portugals
and the Caſtilians doe write many incredible things, and
according to the opinion of manie, that is the ſelfe ſame towne
which Marcus Paulus Venetus calleth Quinzay, as that which
hath diuers names in diuers languages. The like may be ſaid
of a towne in Flaunders, which the French men call Lile, the
Fleminges Ruſsill, and in Latine it is called Inſulae. In
theſe prouinces bée manie good Portes and Hauens vppon the
Sea, and a greate number of ſhippes: by reaſon whereof the
Inhabitantes are mooued to ſay, that amongſt them, there are
as manie that dwell in Shippes vpon the Sea, as bee of them
that dwell in houſes vppon the land, and that their King might
eaſilie make a bridge to paſſe from China to the towne of Malaccha,
which is diſtant from them 300. Almaine leagues. But
aboue all there is one thing worthie of great admiration, and that
is a wall which hath in length 400. Spaniſh leagues, which
the King of China cauſed to be built, to defende the countrey againſt
the inuaſion of the Tartarians, of which thing if the ancient
men had had any knowledge, they woulde haue counted
this worke amongſt the ſeuen woonders of the world. The inhabitantes
are men of Spirite, and geuen to labour. There
was alſo inuented by them ſuch a kinde of writing, that euery
man of what nation ſo euer hee were, béeing ſome what exerciſed
therein might pronounce in his mother tongue, euen
as it were ciphered: They inuented alſo certaine Charriots,
wherein they might ſayle by the Winde vppon plaine
grounde, as they doe in ſhippes vppon the ſea. There are
alſo men amongſt them that are well learned in all Sciences

and eſpecially in Architecture, wherein they excell all others,
they are great louers of learning, and thoſe that doe excell others
therein are promoted to the moſt honourable eſtates: they haue
good municipall lawes, and will ſuffer no Stewes, and they forbid
that any man ſhall marrie any woman with whome he hath liued
before in adulterie, and they gréeuouſlie puniſh all offences, &
do forbid idlenes as the mother of manie euils, yea they conſtrain
blind men to get their liuing, by turning with their hands, milles
made to grinde corne, or any other things, and in their warres againſt
the Tartarians, they get the victorie more by fine pollicie
and ſtratagems, and by multitude of people, than by proweſſe
or feates of Armes. The Portugals doe report that the King
bringeth to the field 300/000. footmen, and 200/000. horſmen.
Now as touching their religion they be Paynims and ſuperſtitious
Idolaters, ſauing that ther are in many places ſome Chriſtians,
as Marcus Paulus Venetus teſtifieth.
                     The chiefeſt Merchandizes tranſported out of China into other
prouinces are theſe, Golde, precious ſtones, Pearles, Muſke,
Rubarbe, the medicinable root, China, Purſlane, aboundance of
ſilke, Sugar, Rice, and all ſorts of graine. The plant of Pepper
is ſowne at the roots of other trées, but ſpecially at the roote
of that Indian trée, which is called Faufell, and at the roote of the
Date trée, to the tops whereof it climeth vp, much like as Iuie
doth vpon a trée, or like to that which is called in Latine Clematis
in Engliſh Perwinkle, which will winde about euery hearbe that
groweth nigh it, the root is but ſmall, and his leaues thinlike vnto
Citron leaues, but ſomewhat leſſe, and ſharpe pointed, gréene and
biting in the taſte, the graines doe grow nigh one to another, like
the long grape, and are alwayes gréene vntil they be through ripe
and drie, there be two kinds thereof, that is, white and blacke, but
the plants of both are much like to our white and red Vines. Pepper
groweth in places neere the ſea ſide of Malacha, and in the
Iles of Sunda and Cuda, ſituated nigh vnto the Ile Iaua maior,
but the beſt kind of Pepper moſt plentifully groweth in the prouince
of Malabar, betwixt the Cape Comori and the cape Canonar,
but long Pepper is found in the realme of Bengala, and
is another kind of plant, altogether vnlike to this.

downe in the ſame page.
                     
                        THe Indian figge trée groweth round about Goa,
the bodie thereof is high and great, and extending
his braunches in a round forme, which like
yellow or golden fillets do ſtoope down towards
the earth, and ſo ſoone as it toucheth the earth,
it bringeth foorth a newe generation of trées,
which differeth nothing at all from the mother but onely in thickneſſe,
des Souches, and the branches of thoſe doe bring foorth
new trées in like manner, in ſo much as the mother with her offſpring
will in ſhort time ſpread as much grounde as containeth
an Italian mile in circuit, the fruites are ſmall Figges, and red
as blood, as well without as within.
                     
                        India tooke his name from the Flood Indus, which bordereth
towards the Eaſt vpon the Realme of China, and towards the
South vpon the great Ocean of India, and towardes the Weſt
vpon the ſea of Arabia, and alſo vpon the Flood Indus, and towards
the North vpon the ſea Mare Euxinum, or Mar maior,
and vpon Bramas.
                     
                     This countrey is iudged at this day, as it hath bene long ſince
to be the nobleſt and richeſt countrey in all the whole world, and it
is diuided by the Flood Ganges into 2. partes, whereof the Weſt
part is called Indoſtan, or India intra Gangem, and the Eaſt
part is called India extra Gangem, and it containeth many prouinces
and Realms, as Cambaiar, Delli, Decan, Biſnagar, Malabar,
Narſingar, Orixa, Bengala, Sanga, Mogores, Tipura,
Gouros, Aua, Pegua, Aurea, Cherſoneſus, Sina, Camboia, and
Campaa. Theſe prouinces are watred with a number of goodly riuers,
amongſt the which Indus and Ganges are the moſt renowmed
riuers of the world. Moreouer, theſe prouinces do abound in
al things that may grow either within the earth or vpon the earth,
except it be copper and lead, as Plinie affirmeth, alſo al manner
of Plants that grow there are very great, braue and excellent good

                        India exéedeth all other countries in precious ſtones and in ſpices,
furniſhing therewith almoſt all the worlde. It hath many
rich mines of Gold, and great ſtore of faire pearle, alſo greate
multitude of all manner of cattell, horſes onely excepted, which
are brought thither out of Perſia and Arabia. It is not long ſince
that Callicute was the chiefe towne of Merchandize in India,
but at this preſent Goa is the chiefe: there is alſo great trafique
vſed at Dio, at Cananor, at Cochin, at Bengala, at Pegu, at
Malacha, and at Sian.
                     
                     
                        Of the Elephant.
                        THe Elephant amongſt all other foure footed beaſtes is
the greateſt ſaue the Dragon and the Crocodyle, he is very
ingenious, in ſo much, as it is incredible that which the ancient
men write of him, and alſo the moderne, which haue
ſought more diligently to know his nature and diſpoſition, hée
is of force incredible, and méete to drawe ſhippes and boats both
out of the water and into the water, and to drawe artillery and
ordinance, hée is alſo méete for the warre, his téeth that ſhoot out
of his mouth are Iuorie, there is great number of them found in
the Indies, and in Afrique, but the greateſt and fitteſt for war,
are found in the Ile of Ceiland, nigh to Calicute.

and of the leaf therof, and alſo the Muske Cat, with her ſhape,
and in the latter end of the page he deſcribeth the Realme of
Perſia.
                     
                        THe beaſt called Rhinoceros, is as long and as
large as the Elephant, but not ſo high, for his
legges are ſhorter, hee is armed not like a Tortoiſe
(as Plancius ſaith) for that is couered a
                           •
                        
ouer with one ſhell, whereas this beaſt is armed
with manifold ſtrong, hard, & thick ſkales, whic
                           •

vpon his noſe, whereof he taketh his name, and hee hath another
little horne vpon his backe, and he is a great enemie by nature vnto
the Elephant, he is found in the Realmes of Cambaia, and of
Bengala.
                     
                     
                        The Sinamon tree.
                        THe Sinamon trée, is as big as the Oliue trée, the branches
and griftes whereof are verie right, his leaues in collour
are like to thoſe of the Laurell trée, but in ſhape like to
thoſe of the Citron, his Flowers are white, and the fruites thereof
are blacke and round, like a hazell Nut, the Sinamon it ſelfe
is no other but the barke of the ſayd trée, which groweth in the
Prouince of Malabar, and in the Iles of Iava and Mindanao,
but the beſt is found in the Ile of Ceiland.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Muske Catte.
                        THe Muſke Cat, is like in ſhape to a common Cat, but
ſhée is greater than either Catte or Foxe, her muzzell is
ſomewhat long and armed with ſharpe téeth, and with
harſh haire, which haires (béeing angry) ſhe will ſet vp as
a Swine doth his briſtles, ſhe is in collour like a Wolfe, but that
ſhe is ſpotted with blacke ſpottes, the nether part of her Muzzel
and the haires of her beard are white, her féete are blacke, her
flanckes are whitiſh, and doe waxe whiter and whiter towardes
her bellie, and next to her genitories, ſhee hath a little bagge
like to a bladder or purſe, into the which doeth fall the precious
greace or humour, which they call Ciuet and Zibeth, which
Ciuet is gathered out from thence with a ſpoone, if ſhee bee in
mans kéeping, but when ſhe is abroad and at her owne libertie,
her bagge being full, ſhee will voyd that Ciuet of her ſelfe,
and it will yéelde ſuch a ſwéete ſauour, as all they that ſayle by
that coaſt may ſmell it a farre off, as I haue heard. Theſe muſk
Cattes are brought from the Realmes of Pegu and Tarnaſſary.
                        
                     
                     
                        The deſcription of Perſia.
                        AS thoſe in Perſia haue enioyed in times paſt the ſecond
Monarchie of the world, ſo at this preſent they be ſtil very

mightie, for the king of Perſia is one of the greateſt Potentates
in the whole world, as hée which commandeth all the great prouinces
that doe border towards the Eaſt vpon the Flood Indus,
and towards the South vpon the ſea called Mare Caſpium, and
vpon the Flood Oxo, within which limittes, are comprehended
all the greateſt Realmes and landes, which the ancient Geographers
were woont to call by theſe names, Aſſyria, Media, Suſiana,
Perſia, Parthia, Hircania, Margiana, Bactriana, Pa
                                 •
                              opaniſa,
Aria, Drangiana, Arachoſia, Caramania, and part of Armenia
maior, the which at this preſent are called by other names
as you may ſée in the Map.
                        The Perſians are a hardie and warlike people, and thought
to be the beſt ryders or horſinen in all the worlde, they haue verie
hard warres with the Turks, they be of moſt frée and gentle nature,
louers of ciuility, they make great account of learning and
Sciences, they honour Nobilitie, wherein they greatly differ
from the Turkes. Now as touching their religion, they be Mahometiſts,
and yet in ſuch ſort, as both they and the Turkes doe
count each one the other as Heretiques in that religion.
                        From the prouinces of Perſia are tranſported into other parts
of the world theſe Merchandizes, ſtones called Turqueſſes, very
faire and excellent pearles, great quantity of ſilke, Veluet, Damaſke
armour, and a great number of moſt excellent horſes.

ſhape of the precious ſtone named Bezar, and the
Dominions of the great Turk in Aſia, and the citie
Aden in Arabia, alſo hée deſcribeth the beaſt
called Cameleopardalis, and ſetteth downe his
ſhape, alſo he ſetteth down the ſhape of thrée of the greateſt Pyramides
that are in Aegypt.
                     
                     
                        Of the ſtone Bezar.
                        THe ſtone Bezar or rather Pazar (for that is his right name)
groweth in Perſia in manner de Boucz, named Pazan,
which are of diuers collours, but moſt commonlie redde.
                        
                           
This ſtone Bezar groweth in a concauitie in manner of a girdle
about two handfull long and thrée inches broad, it is medicinable,
and of great efficacie againſt all manner of poyſons and
venoms, and many other maladies, there is to be found of them in
the entrie of Malacha and alſo in Pegu, but the beſt of them are
in Perſia.
                        
                     
                     
                        Of the dominions which the great Turke hath in Aſia.
                        THe great Turke doth poſſeſſe in Aſia, Natolia, ſometime
called Aſia minor, and almoſt all Armenia, Meſopotamia,
called at this preſent Diarbech, or Diarbekir, Syria,
and a great part of Arabia, the moſt notable Merchant
townes of this countrey are theſe, Trapezunda, Alepp.
and a porte vpon the ſea called Tripoli, alſo Aman, Damaſco,
with his port Barutti and Mecha.
                        
                        The Merchandizes that are ſent from theſe Prouinces into other
countries are theſe, great quantitie of ſilke, Veluet, Damaſk
Turkie Carpets, Cotton, and grain of Skarlet.

                           ADen is the chiefe Merchant towne of the vpper part of
Arabia, which is gouerned by diuers Kinges, and this
towne ſendeth into other Prouinces of the fayreſt Pearles,
the true Baulme, Frankenſcence, Mirrhe, and Horſes.
                     
                     
                        The Beaſt called Camelopardalis.
                        THis beaſt is called of the Arabians, Gyraffa, but the name
Camelopardalis is compounded of Camel and Pardale,
which is a Leoparde, hée hath a verie long necke like vnto
the Cammell, and is ſpotted with many ſpots, as is
the Pardale or Leopard, he is a faire beaſt, and of gentle nature,
as the ſhéepe, his head is like vnto the heade of a Hart or Stag,
but greater, his hornes are ſmall topped, and couered with
haire, and are about a handfull and a halfe long, hee hath eares
tongue and féete like to an Oxe, his forelegges are long and

tall, and his hinder legges are ſhort, whereby he ſéemeth alwaies
to ſtand right vp, his head is ſomewhat higher than the Cammell,
and this beaſt is to be found in Arabia, Aethiopia, and
India.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Pyramides.
                        IN Aegypt are manie Pyramides, whereof the two greateſt
are counted amongſt the ſeuen woonders of the worlde, the
greateſt of them (as witneſſeth Peter Belon) who moſt diligentlie
viewed the ſame, is at the foote foure ſquare, and
euerie ſquare containeth in length 324. paces, and in height
250. degrées or ſteppes, and euerie ſteppe hath in breadth 45.
inches, which is thrée foote and 9. inches, but hée ſetteth not down
what depth euerie ſteppe hath, which muſt not bée ouer déepe:
for then how can anie man eaſilie mount vp to the toppe thereof,
for hée ſaith it is plaine in the toppe, and ſo large as 50. perſons
may ſtand thereon. It is found by writing that 360/000
men wrought 20. yeares in building this Pyramides.
                        
                        The ſecond great Pyramides is ſomewhat leſſe, and ſmooth
on the outſides without any degrées or ſteppes, and the toppe
thereof is ſharpe pointed.
                     
                  
                  
                     The contents of the 10. page.
                     
                        IN this page hée deſcribeth the Crocodyle, and ſetteth
downe the ſhape thereof, ſecondlie, hee ſheweth
whereof the Mummie is bred. Thirdly, he deſcribeth
the Vnicorne, and ſetteth down his ſhape.
                     
                        The Crocodyle.
                        THe Crocodyle is found in Aegypt, in the flood Nilus, and
in India in the flood Ganges, and in the two Prouinces
Mexicana and Pervana in manie riuers. This is a foure
footed beaſt, which hath a horrible head, ſharpe téeth, a
verie ſmall tongue, and a thicke tayle, and his ſkinne is hard
and armed with hard ſcales, the nether parte of his mouth is

immooueable, and the vpper part mooueable, contrarie to all
beaſtes, hée doth deuoure both men and beaſtes, and doth kéepe
more in the water than on the land, and that which is greatly to
be woondred at, hée is ingendred of an Egge, as great as a Gooſe
egge, and hee groweth by little and little vntill hee come to the
length of 18. cubites, or as ſome ſay to 22. cubites, which maketh
33. foote.
                     
                     
                        Of Mummie.
                        MVmmie is made of bodies embaulmed, which they bring
from Aegypt, whereas manie ſuch embaulmed bodies
were buried, about foure houres iourney beyond Cayre,
whereas was ſometime the great citie of Memphis, for
before the natiuitie of Ieſus Chriſt the Egyptians béeing Paynims
did ſpare no coſt to kéepe the bodies of their Parents from
putrifaction, and therefore they are great palpable lyes, whereby
fooles are perſwaded, that the Mummie procéedeth of thoſe bodies
which do periſh in the ſands that be in the deſerts of Arabia, as
though it were poſſible that thoſe bodies could bee preſerued in
thoſe ſands without ſtench or putrifaction.
                     
                     
                        Of the Vnicorne.
                        THe Vnicorne, as Lewes Vartiman teſtifieth, who ſaw two
of them in the towne of Mecha, is of the height of a yoong
horſe or colt of 30. moneths old, which is two yeares and a
halfe olde, hée hath the head of a Hart, and in his forehead
he hath a ſharpe pointed horne thrée cubites long, hée hath a long
necke, and a mane hanging downe on the one ſide of his necke,
his legges are ſlender, as the legges of a Goat, and his féete are
clouen much like to the Goate, his hinder féete are hairy, and his
haire in collour is like to a bay horſe. This beaſt in countenance
is cruell and wilde, and yet notwithſtanding mixt with a certaine
ſwéetnes or amiablenes. His horne is of a merueilous greate
force and vertue againſt Venome and poyſon. The Vnicorne is
founde in Aethiopia, like as the Indian Aſſe is found in India,
which hath likewiſe one onely horne in his forehead,

                           AFrique being the third part of the World, is ſeperated
from Europe and Aſia by the ſea Mediterraneum
and the red Sea, and by the land ſtraight
which is betwixt Aegypt and Paleſtina. The chiefe
Prouinces of Afrique are theſe, Aegypt, Barbarie,
Biledulgarid, Sarra, Aethiopia, Nubia, the large Prouinces
of the Abaſsines, falſly called the lande of Preſter Iohn,

Iles of Capo Verde, and the Iles of Canarie and Madera.
                     
                     
                        The Nutmegge tree.
                        THe Nutmeg trée groweth in the Ile of Bada, and differeth
not much from the Peach trée, ſauing that the leaues
of the Peach trée are ſhorter and rounder: The fruit is
couered with a thicke bark or huſke, which when it is ripe
cleaueth in ſunder, and ſheweth the Nut together with the ſhell,
which is couered with Mace, the which at the firſt viewe is as
red as Skarlet, and pleaſant to behold, but when the Nut waxeth
drie, the Mace do ſeuer from the Nut, and looſing by little and
little their Skarlet collour, do waxe nigh vnto the collour of an
Orange.
                     
                     
                        Of the Cloue tree.
                        THe Cloue trée groweth in the Iles of Moluccas, which in
greatnes and ſhape is like vnto the Lawrell trée, ſauing that
the leafe thereof is ſomewhat narrower. It hath many branches,
and a great number of flowers, firſt white, afterward gréene, and
then red, but being dried, they become black. The cloues do grow
vpon the outermoſt ends of the branches, one hard by another and

whileſt the flowers are gréene they excel all other flowers in ſwéet
odour.

                           MExicana which is the fourth part of the world, is on all
ſides enuironed with the ſea, ſauing that nigh vnto Nombre
de Dios it is ioyned by a land ſtrait to Peruana. The
chiefe prouinces of Mexicana are theſe, the prouince of
Mexico, otherwiſe called nova Hiſpania, terra Florida, Norum
Bega, nova Francia, Eſtotiland, Saguenay, Chilaga, Toconteae,

                     The contents of the 12. page.
                     
                        IN this Page he firſt deſcribeth the beaſt called in that
tongue Aiotochli, in Spaniſh Armadillio. Then he
deſcribeth the 2. Prouinces Peruana, and Magellanica,
then hee ſheweth which hee the moſt mightie
Princes of the world, and finally the diuers qualities
of the people inhabiting the world.
                     
                        
THe beaſt Armadillio is found in the Realme of Mexico,
and he is no bigger than a cat, hee is headed like a Swine,
and hath the féet of a Heriſon, and a long tayle, he is armed
with ſcales, whereof he taketh his name, he keepeth for the
moſt part within the ground, and as ſome ſuppoſe, doth liue by
the earth, by reaſon that he is neuer ſeene to eat abroad out of his
den, the bones of his tayle are medicinable, and do remedie the
paine and deaffnes of the eares.
                     Though Plancius ſaith that this beaſt is armed with ſcales, yet
my countryman William Greenway, who is a proper ſeruiter
both by ſea and land, and hath bene in the Weſt Indies, and hath
eaten of this beaſt, affirmeth his fleſh to be white & verie delicate,
and that he hath no ſcales, but that his ſkin is white and ſmooth
like to a pig new ſcalded, and that ſometime hée will ſhrinke vp
the ſkin vpon his backe into diuers plates, and ſpecially towards
his fore partes and hinder partes, in ſuch ſort, as hee will make
them almoſt to méete, and the former plates do hang downe vpon
his ſhoulders like vnto two Poldrons, and his haire is white and
ſhort, growing thin here and there one, and he is eared and tailed
like a rat, euen as he is here portraide, ſauing that he is throughout
of one ſelfe collour, and without ſcales.
                     
                        Peruana.
                        
                           PErvana being the fift part of the world, is alſo enuironed on
all ſides with the ſea, ſaue wheras the foreſaid landſtrait doth
ioyne the ſame to Mexicana, and the chiefe prouinces which
it containeth are theſe, Braſilia, Tiſnada, Caribana, Carthagena,
Peru, Charchas, Chili, Chica, & the land of the Patagones▪
                           
The moſt renowmed Iles are theſe, Hiſpaniola, otherwiſe called
S. Domingo, Boriquen, & Margarita, which is the Ile of pearls.
                        The Merchandizes which are tranſported out of Pervana into
Europe are theſe, gold, ſiluer, Emeralds, Pearls, the medicinable
ſtone called Bezoar, Baulme, Ginger, Sugar, wood of Braſill,
wood of Guaicum, called Lignum vitae, long Pepper, Pepper of
Braſill, Caſsia ſolutiva and hides of Oxen.
                     
                     
                        Magellanica.
                        THis is the ſixt part of the worlde, which as yet is but little
knowne, in ſuch ſort as we cannot write any thing touching

the prouinces of the ſame, notwithſtanding it is thought the prouince
of Beach is verie rich, and hath aboundance of Golde, the
chiefe Iles of Magellanica are theſe, Iava maior, and Iava
minor, Timor, Banda, the Molucques, Romeros, the Iles of
Salomon.
                        
                        From the Ile Timor doth come into Europe, the white and
pale medicinable ſimple called Sandalum.
                        
                        From the Iles Banda doth come Nutmegs and Maces.
                        And from the Iles Molucques Cloues.
                     
                     
                        Which be the great Princes of the World?
                        THe moſt mightie Princes of the world are theſe fiue, that is, the
King of China, otherwiſe called the great Cham 1. the king
of Perſia 2. the great Turke 3. the Emperour of Aethiopia 4.
the Emperor of Ruſsia, otherwiſe called the great Duke of Muſcovia
5. amongſt which the king of China is a Pagan or Heathen:
and the great Turke and the king of Perſia are Mahometiſts:
but the Emperour of Aethiopia and the great Duke of Muſcovia
do make profeſſion of the Chriſtian religion. Now as touching
the king of Spaine, his puiſſance ſhould bee much greater
than it is, if his prouinces were not ſo ſeperated, and ſo farre diſtant
on from another.
                     
                     
                        The qualities of diuers people in the World.
                        AS touching the qualities of peoples, though God almighty
hath created al men of one ſelfe blood, and that all do take
their beginning from the Arke of Noah, and that all men
be of one ſelfe qualitie and ſhape of body, yet they differ in
greatneſſe, in proportion of members, and in collour: for the Patagones
doe excéede all other creatures in greatnes. Againe, the
men of China haue moſt commonly broad faces, little cies, flatte
noſes, and little beards, and thoſe that haue ſmalleſt féete, are
counted amongſt them to be moſt beautifull, thoſe of Africa haue
groſſer and thicker lippes than other people, the inhabitants of
Agyſimba, and of Guinea, and ſpeciallie of the lands that be nigh
vnto Cape de bona eſperanza, are blacke, from whome the Orientall
Indians do not much differ.
                        
                           
The Abaſsines or Moores of Aegypt, be of a duſkiſh collour
lyke to the Oliffe, the Inhabitants of Barbarie, be called white
Moores, and thoſe that dwell betwixt them and the Nigrites or
blacke Moores be of a yellowiſh collour, the Spaniardes haue
not found eyther in Mexicana, or in Pervana any Nigrites or
Blackmoores, but onely in certaine villages nigh vnto Carque,
the other nations vnder the hotte Zone, bee of collour browne
bay, lyke a cheſſenut, and the nigher that they dwell to eyther of
the Poles Arctique or Antarctique, the whiter moſt commonly
they be, and as touching the reſt all are like in qualities,
ſhape, and faſhion of bodie, as hath bene ſaid before, wherfore
they are méere lies that are woont to be told of the Pigmeans,
in that they ſhould bee but a foote and a halfe high, and likewiſe
that which hath bene ſpoken of people, that ſhuld haue their heads
their noſes, their mouthes, and their eies in their breaſtes, or
of thoſe that are headed lyke a dog, or of thoſe that haue but one
eie, and that in their forehead, or of thoſe that haue but one foote
and that ſo great, as that it couereth and ſhadoweth all their bodie,
or of thoſe that haue greate eares hanging downe to the
ground. All theſe are méere lyes, inuented by vaine men to bring
fooles into admiration, for monſters are as well borne in Europe,
as in other partes of the world.

and alſo vpon the Turkes, and Tartaries Perocopſiques,

they obſerue the Faith and ceremonies of the Gréeke Church,
all their Biſhops called in their language Vladiques, and alſo
their Metropolitane are vnder the obedience of the Patriarch
of Conſtantinople. The people is wiſe and ſubtill, and yet louing
ſeruitude more than libertie or fréedome, and they all confeſſe
themſelues to be the ſernants and ſlaues of the great Duke,
hauing ſeldome or neuer peace, for either they haue warres with
thoſe of Lituania, or with thoſe of Livonia, or with thoſe of
Swethland, or with the Tartarians, or if they haue no warres,
then they lie in garriſon nigh vnto the 2. floods Tanais and Dwina,
to defend their bounds from the depredations and inuaſions of
the Tartaries, they ſharply puniſh robbers and ſtealers, and yet
priuie theft and murder is ſeldome puniſhed with death: their ſiluer
money is not rounde, but hath the forme of an egge, their

good Flaxe and hempe to make Cables and ropes, and a great

of life, they be men of a ſquare ſtature, hauing broade and groſſe
faces, their eies hollow ſunke into their heads, and looking ſomewhat
a ſquint, and thick beards, they be ſtrong of bodie and hardy,
they eat horſes and all other beaſtes howe ſo euer they are ſlaine,
ſauing hogges, from which they abſtaine, they are able to endure
hunger, thirſt, watch, and all diſcommodities, and when they are
diſtreſſed in their voyages with hunger and thirſt, they let their
horſes blood, and with that blood quench their hunger and thirſt,
which kind of meat they cal in their language Beſermannen, they
call theyr Emperour Cham, that is to ſay, Prince, and therefore


                                    Cambalu is interpreted to be the ſeat or towne of the prince.

                                       Frances of Diep, a moſt ſkilfull Pilot, doth witneſſe that the
néedle of the Mariners compaſſe, doth turn directlie to the North
Pole, being in the Ilands of Capo Verde, that is to ſay, the Ile
of Sal, the Ile of Bonauiſta, and the Ile of Mayo, whereunto
thoſe doe agrée very nigh, which do ſay that the néedle doth the like
in the Iles of Tercera, and of S. Marie, which are part of the
Flemmiſh Iles, otherwiſe called the Azores: but ſome others do
affirme, that the néedle ſheweth the North pole beſt, being in the
Ile of Corvo, which is the furtheſt Ile weſtward of the ſaid Azores,
and becauſe the longitude of places by moſt liuely reaſons,
ought to take his beginning from the common Meridian of the
world, and from the rocke or Pole of the Adamant ſtone, we here
following the opinion of thoſe that are moſt ſkilfull in this matter,
haue ſet downe the firſt Meridian betwixt the Iles of Capo
Verde, and the Azores, and becauſe the néedle in al other places,
declineth either more or leſſe from the Pole of the world, ther muſt
néeds be another Pole in ſome one place wherunto the néedle doth


incline from all coaſtes of the worlde, and I haue found by the
declination of the néedle obſerued at Ratisbone, otherwiſe called
Regensberg, that is the ſame place, which I haue ſet down
in the Mappe, and I haue likewiſe marked in this Carde, the
ſituation of the Pole of the ſtone, in reſpect of the Ile Corvo,
to the intent that according to the outermoſt places limitted by
the firſt Meridian, the outermoſt boundes, betwixt which, this
Pole ought to bee found, might be knowne, vntill the diligent
and curious conſideration of the Pilots ſhall bring vs ſomthing
of more certaintie. Thus farre Mercator.

of the Spaniard, in the yeare 1518. by their generall,

                                    Ferdinando Cortes who conquered the ſame with great loſſe of
his ſouldiours, but with greater ruine to the inhabitantes, who
fought for the libertie of their Countrie, the ſoile is very fertill,
and the Countrie is rich in golde and ſiluer, for in the floodes are
found great ſands of gold, and in the mountaines is drawne out
of the mines great quantitie of ſiluer, and alongeſt the ſea ſide
they take to their great profite an infinite number of Oyſters,
wherein are found very faire pearles. In this Prouince there
are many ſault lakes, the water whereof by force of the ſunne is
turned into ſault: there groweth alſo great abundance of Caſſia
fiſtula, and an other kinde of fruite, which the inhabitants
call in their tongue Cacao, it is like to an Almonde, they haue
it in great price, for of it they make a certaine drinke, which
they loue meruailous well. The ſea and floods which doe waſh
this Prouince, doe furniſh them with great plentie of fiſhe, and
in thoſe floodes are many Crocodiles, whoſe fleſh the inhabitants
doe eate, and this beaſt will grow to be twenty foote long and aboue.
This Countrie is full of great mountaines and high rocks,
there is great diuerſitie of languages, in ſo much as one vnderſtandeth
not an other without an interpretor. Mexico is the Metropolitane
and Royall towne, or rather the Quéene of all the
principall Townes in the worlde, it is ſituated vpon the ſide of a
lake or mariſh, yea the very foundation of it is a very mariſh, in
ſuch ſort, as you can neither enter into it, nor come out of it, but
by bridges, and it is aſwell peopliſhed with inhabitants and Merchants,
as any renowmed Merchant towne in Europe, the towne
is very great, for it containeth in circuit 3. Spaniſh leagues.

Peru, Chila, and Breſille: The Prouince Peru (before the
arriuall of the Spaniardes) did extende a great deale further,

naturall King, which then was called Ingas, as Giraua and
others doe write. At this preſent it is limited on the North
with the Towne Quito, and towardes the South with the
Towne of Plata, that is to ſaye, the ſiluer Towne, and it was
called Peruana as ſome write, of the flood and Port of the ſea
called Peru. It is at this preſent deuided (according to the ſituation
of the Countrie) into thrée partes, that is to ſay, Sie ras,
Andes, and the flat or plaine countrie.

from the Cape Saint Auguſtine, was found the Promontorie of
the South lande, as Martin Ferdinando Denciſo hath noted in

                                 In this our Geography, we haue in ſuch manner deſcribed
the circuit of the whole earth, as all the Countries are ſituated
vnder their proper Meridians, which could not haue béene
done, without extending them more or leſſe from the Weſt towardes
the Eaſt, notwithſtanding béeing deſirous to ſatiſfie
thoſe that are practiſed in the arte of Nauigation, wee haue
deſcribed the North Prouinces of Europe in this our Geographie,
in ſuch ſort as their ſituation wholly agréeth with the perticular
Mariners Cardes.

                                    The 9. Inſcription is intituled to the louers of Geographie.
                                    We haue in this Inſcription of the whole earth, employed all
diligence to deſcribe all the Seas and Prouinces, in ſuch ſort as
euery place may haue his true Longitude and Latitude, in which
matter, we haue ſpared neither labour nor coſt, for we haue diligently
conferred together the Sea Cardes, as well of the
Caſtilians as Portingales, which they vſe in their Nauigations
to America and to India, and amongeſt others wee obtayned

from Portingale a Mariners Carde, deſcribing the whole earth
very correctly, and beſides that 14. other particular Cardes,
in the which likewiſe all the Seas and Prouinces of the whole
world, with their ſituation were compriſed, all which Cardes being
compared together, wee doe here nowe ſet foorth this newe
deſcription of all the Prouinces and Seas in the whole worlde,
and that as correctly as may be, according to the conſideration
and obſeruation which hath béen vſed by the moſt expert Geographers
and Pilots, euen vnto this preſent houre: for in this Carde
we doe deſcribe all the ſea coaſtes, Promontories, windinges in
and out, Iles, Portes deapthes, ſandes, ſhowlds and rockes, alſo
we haue added thereunto in place conuenient, the Mariners compaſſe,
and the lines of the windes, which wee haue ſet downe as
correctly as was poſſible for vs to doe, for the commoditie of Nauigation:
and for ſo much as the true Longitude of the places
can not be well obſerued, without extending or enlarging too farre
thoſe Prouinces that are nigh vnto the North or South pole of
the world, we haue therefore briefely comprehended the ſame in
this our deſcription of the world, in two rondles or circles, vnto
the which we haue added another little Geographicall Carde,
comprehending the north Prouinces of Europe, to the intent that
in them euery man may ſée with his eyes, the naturall ſituation of
thoſe Prouinces as well as it may be done in plano, as is more
amply declared in other inſcriptions of this Mappe. And this little
Septentrionall Map laſt mentioned, is placed at the foote of this
map, in the very midſt thereof comprehending all the North parts
that lie betwixt the 52. degrée, and 72′· of Latitude.

Weſt, betwixt Madagaſcar and the Ile Romoros, in ſuch ſort as
Nauigation there is very troubleſome and laborious, as Marcus
Paulus Venetus teſtifieth in his third booke & 40. chap. whereof
it muſt néedes follow of neceſſitie, that the ſea coaſts of this countrie
are not far diſtant from Madagaſcar, in ſuch ſort as the great
Orientall ſea doth ebbe and flowe through this ſtraite with great

violence into the Weſt Ocean ſea, whereunto agréeth the letter
miſſiue of a Candiot, who was Embaſſadour for the Venetians
to the king of Portingale. In which letter hee writeth that the
men of this Countrie goe all naked.

Motir, Machian, and Bachian, vnto which ſome doe adde
Gilolo, Celebes, Burro, Amboino, and Bandar.
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                        Beſides all theſe Inſcriptions, Plancius at the foure corners
of his Mappe, ſetteth downe foure rondles, two aboue and other
two beneath: and in that aboue on the left hand, repreſenting the
Northerne halfe of the celeſtiall Globe, he deſcribeth al the North
ſtars that are alredy, & in the other rondle on ye right hand repreſenting
the ſoutherne halfe of the celeſtial Globe, he doth not only
ſet downe ſuch Southerne ſtars as were knowne to the auncient
Aſtronomers, but alſo ſuch Southerne ſtarres, as haue béen found
out of latter dayes by thoſe that haue trauelled into the Eaſt and
Weſt Indies, as the Croſſe, the Southerne Triangle, Noes
Doue or Pigeon, and an other in the ſhape of a man, called
Polophilax, and certaine others, touching which ſtarres hee
ſetteth downe nigh vnto the foreſaid rondle, a certaine inſcription

written in the Latine tongue, which I haue here interpreted word
for word in our mother tongue as foloweth.
                        We haue here ſet downe the fixed ſtarres in their true places
anſwerable to the yeare 1592. and not 95. as the Printer hath
made it.
                     
                  
                  
                     Of the South pole and of the ſtarres that are about
the ſame.
                     
                        LEaſt the South part of this Hemiſpheare or halfe
Globe, ſhould remaine voide and emptie, I haue
taken theſe Southerne ſtarres out of the obſeruations
of Andreas Corſalius Florentine, and haue
diligently compared the ſame with the writings of
Americus Veſputius, and of Petrus Medina, and haue reduced
the ſaide ſtarres into this forme or ſhape. But for ſo much as I
haue ſéene nothing as yet to my ſatiſfaction or contentment touching
the Longitude, Latitude, Magnitude or nature of the ſaid
ſtars, I hartely pray all thoſe that haue any more certaine knowledge
of this matter then we, that they will enforme vs thereof, to
the common good of all men: As touching the pole Antarctique,
Corſalius writeth that there be two cloudie ſtars of a meane bigneſſe,
which with a circular motion doe goe about another ſtarre,
that is diſtant from the Pole almoſt 11. degrées, and are ſometime
aboue and ſometime beneath the ſaid ſtarre. Hitherto Plancius.
But now to the intent that you may the better vnderſtande
all the foreſaide foure rondles, I thinke it not amiſſe to deſcribe
the ſame vnto you, and to ſhew the vſe thereof as followeth. You
haue to note then, that the two vpper rondles: that which is on
the left hand, ſignifieth the Northerne halfe of the celeſtiall Globe
and the other rondle on the right hand, ſignifieth the Southerne
halfe of the ſaid Globe as hath béene ſaid before, and each one of
theſe rondles is traced with certaine circles and lines: The outtermoſt
Circle whereof being deuided into 360. degrées, and
containing the Characters of the 12. ſignes, ſignifieth the Zodiaque,
or rather the very Ecliptique it ſelfe, the Centre of which
Circle, is the pole of the Zodiaque, which by continuall turning
about, deſcribeth another leſſer Circle hard by it, ſignifying in

the North rondle the circle Arctique, and in the South rondle the
circle Antarctique, the Centre of which leſſer circle in eyther rondle,
is the pole of the world, both which poles are diſtant from the
pole of the Zodiaque 23. degrées 28′· which is the greateſt declination
of the ſunne. Moreouer in either rondle are drawne vpon
ech pole of the worlde, two other circles, the largeſt whereof
ſignifieth in both rondles the Equinoctiall, and the leſſer thereof
in the North rondle, ſignifieth the Tropique of Cancer, and in
the South rondle the Tropique of Capricorne: beſides theſe circles
ech rondle is traced with 12. right lines, ſignifying thoſe ſixe
Meridians or lines which paſſing through both the poles of the
Zodiaque, doe deuide the Zodiaque into 12. equall parts, euery
part containing 30. degrées: for ſo many degrées doe belong to
the Longitude of euery one of the 12. ſignes, whereby the Zodiaque
hath in Longitude 360. degrées, which Longitude is to be
counted from the firſt point of Aries and ſo foorth, according to the
ſucceſſion of the ſignes, and by helpe of theſe lines, you may know
vnder what ſigne any fixed ſtarre is: I ſhal not néede here to ſhew
you, how the ſaid fixed ſtarres are ſituated, in either of the rondles,
nor how they are named, becauſe their images or ſhapes together
with their names, are apparant to your eye. But if you
would know the true place, the Longitude, Latitude, Magnitude
and the nature of any fixed ſtarre herein contained, then do thus:
Firſt to knowe the place and Longitude of any ſtarre, lay a ruler
or extend a thréede, ſo as it may paſſe through the Pole of the Zodiaque,
and alſo through the bodie of the ſtarre, whoſe place and
Longitude you ſéeke, euen to the very Zodiaque, and ſomewhat
beyond, and thereby you ſhall know in what ſigne, and in what
degrée thereof that ſtarre is, for that is his place, and you ſhall
knowe his Longitude by counting from the firſt point of Aries,
vnto that degrée, for that is his Longitude.
                     Now to know the Latitude of any ſtarre, you haue to note that
in each rondle there is a certaine right blacke line extending from
the Zodiaque to the Pole, deuided by vnequall ſpaces into 90.
degrées, which line is called the ſkale of the fixed ſtars Latitude,
the vſe whereof is thus: Set the firme foote of your Compaſſes in
the very pole, and extend the other foote into the middeſt of the bodie
of that ſtarre whoſe Latitude you ſéeke, and turne that foote

ſtanding at that widenes to the ſkale, and the number of degrées
written vpon the ſkale, if you count from the Zodiaque vpward
towards the Pole, will ſhew you the Latitude of that ſtarre. Againe,
to knowe the magnitude of any ſtarre, Plancius ſetteth
down in the North rondle the ſelfe ſame meane which Mercator
alſo vſeth in his celeſtiall Globe, that is to ſay, by making certain
ſhapes of ſtarres repreſenting the bigneſſe of euery ſtarre, according
to his greatneſſe, that by marking & comparing thoſe ſhapes
together, you might finde out, or rather coniecture the greatneſſe
of the ſtarre which you ſéeke. Laſtly he ſheweth the nature of any
ſtarre by ſetting downe nigh vnto the ſtar, the characters of thoſe
Planets, of whoſe nature that ſtarre doth participate, all which
thinges you ſhall more plainely vnderſtande by this example here
following.
                     Suppoſe that you would know the place, longitude, latitude,
magnitude and nature of the ſtarre called Arcturus: here becauſe
this is a North ſtarre, you muſt therfore reſort to the North rondle,
and there ſéeke out the image Bootes, betwixt whoſe legs is
the ſtar called Arcturus which you ſéeke. And by extending a thréed
which may paſſe through the pole, and alſo through the bodie of
that ſtarre euen to the Zodiaque, and ſomewhat beyond, you ſhall
find his place to be in the 19. degrée of the ſigne Libra, and his
Longitude counting frō the firſt point of Aries, vnto that degrée
to be 199. degrées, and by obſeruing the rule before giuen, touching
the knowing of the Latitude of any ſtarre, you ſhall with
your Compaſſe finde the Latitude of this ſtarre to be almoſt 32.
degrées Northward, and by his ſhape you ſhall knowe that hée is
of the firſt magnitude, and the characters of the two Planets
Mars and Iupiter, placed hard by him, do ſhew that he is of their
nature, that is to ſay, by participating of Mars he is extremely
hotte and dry, and by participating of Iupiter he is hotte & moiſt,
and looke what order is to be obſerued in the North rondle, touching
the North ſtars, the ſame is likewiſe to be vſed in the South
rondle containing the Southerne ſtarres: Amongeſt which you
may ſée the Images called the Croſſe, whereby moſt Pilots in
theſe dayes doe chiefely direct their courſe, being once paſt the Equinoctiall
towardes the South pole, which Croſſe, though Plancius
doth here make to conſiſt of fiue ſtarres, yet I am ſure that

                        Martin Cortes and Peter Medina, and all other late writers do
appoint thereunto but foure ſtarres, the ſhape and vſe whereof,
I haue ſet downe in my Treatiſe of Nauigation, according to
the direction of Peter Medina. And thoſe that haue trauailed into
the Indies, doe all affirme that to the Croſſe there doe belong
onely foure ſtarres and no more, wherefore I maruaile much,
that Plancius doth ſet downe fiue, whereunto perhaps he is induced
by the relation of ſome Spaniarde that neuer ſawe them.
Thus hauing deſcribed vnto you the two vpper rondles, repreſenting
together the celeſtiall Globe, and alſo ſhewed the vſe therof,
I will now deſcribe the two neather rondles, whereof that on
the left hande repreſenteth the North halfe of the Terreſtriall
Globe, & that on the right hand the other halfe of the ſame Globe,
towardes the South.
                     You haue then to vnderſtand that the Centre or middle point
in each rondle, ſignifieth the Pole of the world, that is to ſay, the
North pole in the North rondle, and the South pole in the South
rondle, and vpon each pole are drawne certaine Circles, the outtermoſt
whereof, and furtheſt diſtant from the Pole ſignifieth the
Equinoctiall, which is deuided into 360. degrées, euery degrée
containing 60. miles, which is the whole Longitude of the earth,
from which circle at the end of euery tenth degrée, are drawn certaine
right lines to the number of 18. which doe méete in the very
Pole, and doe ſignifie halfe Meridians, whereof that which
paſſeth through the Iles Azores, and alſo the Iles of Capo Verde,
is the firſt Meridian, from whence the longitude of the earth
taketh his beginning, and there alſo endeth: which Meridian in
the rondle on the left hand, is deuided into 90. parts, procéeding
from the Equinoctial to the Pole, ſignifying the North Latitude
of the worlde, the like diuiſion and number of degrées of Latitude,
hath alſo the firſt Meridian, in the rondle on the right
hande, ſauing that the ſaide Meridian tendeth vpwarde. Moreouer
you haue to vnderſtande, that in each of theſe rondles, are
drawne nine Circles, equally diſtant one from another, called
Parallels, which together with the Equinoctiall, doe make nine
ſpaces, euery ſpace contayning 10. degr. & beſides theſe circles,
there are drawne in ech rondle two other circles, the one greater,
& the other leſſer, the greater in the rondle on the left hand being

diſtant from the Equinoctiall 23. degrées 30′· which is the greateſt
declination of the ſunne, is called the Tropique of Cancer, and
the leſſer Circle being of like diſtance from the pole, is called the
Circle Arctique, but the greater circle being of like diſtance from
the Equinoctiall, in the rondle on the right hand, is called the tropique
of Capricorne, and the leſſer circle in the ſaid rondle inuironing
the Pole, is called the Circle Antarctique vpon which circles
in each rondle you ſhall finde their names written. The chiefeſt
vſes of theſe two rondles are theſe: firſt to finde out the Longitude
of any place, ſecondly the Latitude, and thirdly the diſtance
betwixt any two places.
                     To finde out the Longitude of any place, you muſt doe thus:
Extende a thréede, ſo as it may paſſe through the pole, and alſo
through the place whoſe longitude you ſéeke, euen to the very Equinoctial,
and ſomewhat beyond, and holding the thréed ſtraight,
the numbers of the degrées written vpon the Equinoctiall will
ſhewe the longitude of the place.
                     And if you wil know the latitude of that place, or of any other,
doe thus, Set the one foote of your compaſſe in the very pole, extending
the other to the place whoſe Latitude you ſéeke, and kéeping
your compaſſe at that wideneſſe, bring the mooueable foote to
the firſt Meridian, whereon the degrées of latitude are marked,
and there ſtaying it, the number of the degrées, counting from
the Equinoctiall vpward towards the pole, will ſhewe the latitude
of the place. As for example, ſuppoſe that you would know
the longitude and latitude of Lisbone, which is a famous towne
in Portingale, here hauing firſt found out that towne in Spaine,
which is nigh vnto the Weſt Ocean, extende your thréede from
the pole through the middeſt of that Towne to the Equinoctiall
and ſomewhat beyond, and you ſhall finde that the thréed will cut
the Equinoctiall in the 13. degrée, which is the Longitude of
Lisbone. Nowe if you would knowe the Latitude of the ſame
place, ſet the one foote of your compaſſe in the Pole, and extende
the other foote to Lisbone, and kéeping your compaſſe at that
wideneſſe, bring the mooueable foote to the ſkale of latitude, and
ſo you ſhall find that Lisbone hath in North latitude 38. degrées
and 30′· Now to knowe the diſtance betwixt any two places doe
thus, Set the one foote of your compaſſe in the one place, and the

other foote in the other place, and apply that wideneſſe to the Equinoctiall,
and looke howe many degrées of the Equinoctiall
that wideneſſe comprehendeth, and by allowing 60. Italian miles
to euery degree, you ſhall haue the diſtance by a right line, betwixt
thoſe two places, for by doing thus, you ſhall finde the diſtance
betwixt Lisbone & Compoſtella to be 120. miles. Thus I haue
ſufficiently (I hope) expounded euery thing contained in Plancius
his Map, his general ſkale made for the ſame onely excepted,
whereof I come now to ſpeake. In this ſkale are ſet downe the
miles of Ruſſia, of Italy, of Englande, of Scotland, the French
leagues, the houre leagues, the Spaniſh leagues, the Germaine
and Garſcoyne miles, which two are all one, the miles of Sweuia
in Germanie, of Scandia and of Swethland, which laſt three are
likewiſe all one, the vſe of which ſkale is thus. Take with your cō
                        paſſe
the diſtance betwixt any 2. places which you deſire to know,
and apply the ſame to the ſkale of ſuch miles as you would know,
& ſo many miles the two places ſhal be diſtant one from another as
the number of the ſkale doth ſhew: but if the diſtance betwixt the
two places be longer then the ſkale, then hauing firſt taken the
whole length of the ſkale with your compaſſes, looke howe manie
times that widenes of your compaſſe meaſuring by a right line is
contained in the diſtance betwixt the two places, and if there be
any odde ſpace left, ſtreighten your compaſſe to that odde ſpace, &
apply that to the beginning of the ſkale, and adde the number of
miles which you there find to the firſt great number, ſo ſhall you
haue the totall ſumme. And lo here for each an example: firſt ſuppoſe
that you would know the diſtance betwixt Cape S. Marie, &
Cape finis terrae, which are two Capes or headlands in the Weſt
ſide of Spaine, both hauing in a maner one ſelfe Longitude, & do
differ only in latitude by 6. degrées, for the one hath 37. & the other
43. in latitude, which diſtance if you take with your cōpaſſe by ſetting
the one foot in the one place, & the other foote in the other place,
and applying that widenes to the ſkale of Italian miles, you ſhal
find the diſtance to be 390. Italian miles, but if you meaſure the
ſame diſtance according to the Geographicall maner, which is to
allow for euery degree of latitude 60. miles, you ſhal find ye diſtāce
to be no more but 360. Italian miles. Let your other example be
thus: Suppoſe that you would know the diſtance betwixt Compoſtella
                        
in Spaine and Conſtantinople, which haue all one
Latitude and doe differ onely in Longitude, heere becauſe the
diſtance betwixt theſe two places is longer then the ſkale, you
muſt take with your compaſſe the whole length of the ſkale, and
then to looke how many times that widenes is cōprehended (meaſuring
by a right line) betwixt the two ſaid places, & you ſhall find
that widenes to be cōprehended in the diſtance betwixt thoſe two
places thrée times, wherefore if you multiply 840. by 3. it will
make in all 2520. Italian miles. But if (according to the Geographicall
kind of meaſuring) you doe multiply the difference of
their Longitudes, which is 43. degrées, by the number of miles,
which is alſo 43. belonging to the Latitude of both places, which
Latitude is alſo very nigh 43. degr. you ſhal find that the diſtance
betwixt thoſe two townes is no more but 1870. Italian miles,
which number of miles is not ſo great as that of the ſkale by 650.
Italian miles. And therefore I can not thinke but that there is
ſome error in the ſkale committed either by the Printer or elſe by
the author through ſome negligence, and not for lacke of ſkill or
knowledge how to make a true ſkale, being ſo excellent a Geographer
as the Author by this & other his Maps heretofore made
ſheweth himſelfe to be, or elſe there is ſome greater miſtery therin,
then I perhaps doe vnderſtand, for in ſéeking to know the diſtance
betwixt two places differing onely in Latitude, I finde the
ſkale moſt times to agrée with the Geographicall kind of meaſuring,
but if the two places do differ either in longitude onely, or
elſe both in longitude and alſo in latitude, then I find the ſkale to
differ very much from the Geographicall kinde of meaſuring,
wherfore I thinke it good briefely here to ſet downe certaine readie
waies of finding out the diſtance of two places, differing eyther
in latitude onely, in longitude only, or in both, which I doe
ſhew alſo at large in the ſecond part of my Spheare, Chap. 14.
                  
                  
                     How to finde out the diſtance of two places differing onely
in Latitude.
                     
                        IF the two places haue both eyther North or South
Latitude, then ſubtracte the leſſer Latitude out of
the greater, ſo ſhall you haue the difference: which
difference, if you multiply by ſixetie, the product

ſhall be the number of miles, and if to the whole degrées of difference
there be annexed any minutes, then you muſt adde to the
product for euery minute one mile. But if one of the two places
haue North Latitude, and the other South Latitude, then you
ſhall finde their difference by addition, and not by ſubtraction. As
for example, ſuppoſe that you would knowe the diſtance betwixt
a towne called Paſquali, which is the outermoſt towne in Moroa
vpon the ſea towards the South, hauing in North latitude 35.
degrées 30′· and a certaine towne in Afrique called Debſan ſtanding
nigh vnto the lake Zembre, which hath in South Latitude
12. degrées 30′· here by adding theſe two latitudes together, you
ſhall find the ſumme to be 48. degrées, and that is the difference of
their Latitudes, which difference if you multiply by 60. the product
will be 2880. and that is their diſtance.
                  
                  
                     How to find out the diſtance of two places differing onely
in Longitude.
                     
                        IF both places haue either Eaſt Longitude or Weſt
Longitude, then ſubtract the leſſer out of the greater,
ſo ſhall you haue the difference, which difference
you muſt multiply by the number of miles belonging
to their Latitude, which you ſhall finde on the
Northweſt ſide of the Mappe, or by the Table of miles anſwerable
to one degrée of euery Latitude ſet downe hereafter in the end
of this Treatiſe: and the product thereof ſhall be the number of
miles whereby the one place is diſtant from the other. As for example,
I finde Compoſtella in Spaine and Conſtantinople, hauing
both almoſt 43. degrées of North Latitude, to differ only in
Eaſt longitude, for Compoſtella hath in Eaſt longitude 13. degrées
30′· & Conſtantinople hath in Eaſt longitude 56. degrées,
the difference whereof by ſubtracting the leſſer out of the greater
you ſhall finde to be 42. degrées 30′· here if you multiply 42. by
43. miles belonging to one degrée of the foreſaid Latitude 43. you
ſhall finde the product to be 1806. then to finde out the value of
miles for the fraction 30′, by the rule of proportion, you muſt ſay
thus: if 60. require 43. miles what ſhall 30. require, and you
ſhall finde in the quotient 21. miles, which you muſt adde to the

former ſumme 1806. and it will make in all 1827. miles and ½.
which is the true diſtance betwixt the two foreſaid places. But if
the one place haue eaſt Longitude, and the other Weſt Longitude,
then you muſt finde the difference aſwell by Addition as by Subtraction.
As for example, ſuppoſe that you would knowe the diſtance
betwixt S. Domingo in the Ile called Hiſpaniola, and a
certaine place in Afrique called Septem montes, night vnto the
Ocean ſea, both places hauing 18. degrées of North latitude.
And S. Domingo hath in Weſt longitude 310. degrées 30′· and
the place called Septem montes hath in Eaſt longitude ſeuen degrées.
Here you muſt firſt ſubtract 310. degrées 30′· out of 360.
degrées, and there will remaine 49. degrée 30′· whereunto you
muſt adde the Eaſt longitude of Septem montes, which is ſeuen
degrées, and it will make in all 56. degrées 30′· which is the difference
of their Longitude. Nowe if you firſt multiply 56. degrées
by 57. miles belonging to 18. degrées of latitude, you ſhal
find the product to be 3192. miles, and to finde out the value of
miles for the fraction 30′· you muſt ſay thus: If 60. require 57.
miles, what ſhall 30′· require, and working by the common rule
of thrée, you ſhall haue in the quotient 28. miles, and there remaineth
30/60. which is one halfe mile. Now by adding 28. miles and ½.
to 3192. it will make in all 3220. miles ½. and that is the true diſtance
betwixt S. Domingo and Septem montes, but by Plancius
ſkale you ſhall finde the diſtance to be 3410. miles, which
differeth from the other almoſt 200. miles.

                     How to finde out the diſtance of two places differing both
in Longitude and Latitude by helpe of a ſemi-circle deuided
into a 180. degrees, which I had from my louing friend Maiſter
Wright of Cayes Colledge in Cambridge, of whom I
make mention aſwell in my treatiſe of the Spheare as in that
of Nauigation.
                     
                        FIrſt drawe a Semicircle vppon a right Diameter,
marked with the letters A. B. C. D. whereof let D. be
the Centre like vnto this here deſcribed, and the greater
that ſuch ſemicircle is, the ſpaces of the degrées
ſhall be the larger, and thereby the more eaſie to find
out the minutes. Then hauing drawne your ſemicircle and deuided
the ſame accordingly, ſuppoſe that by helpe therof you would
find out the diſtance betwixt London and Hieruſalem, which two
townes doe differ both in Longitude and alſo in Latitude ſo much
as is here ſet downe in the front of the figure according to ſuch
Longitude and Latitude as Plancius doth allow to eyther towne
in his great Map. Now to find out the true diſtance of theſe two
townes you muſt firſt take the leſſer Longitude out of the greater,
ſo ſhall you haue the difference of their Longitudes, which is 47.
degrées, then count that difference vpon the Semicircle beginning
at A. and ſo procéede to B. and at the ende of that difference, make
a pricke marked with the letter E. vnto which pricke draw a right
line by your ruler from D. the Centre of the Demicircle: That
done ſéeke out the leſſer Latitude which is 32. degrées 0′· in the
foreſaid Demicircle, beginning to account the ſame frō the pricke
E. and ſo procéede towards the letter B. and at the end of the ſaid
leſſer latitude ſet down another pricke marked with the letter G.
from which pricke or point drawe a perpendicular line, which by
helpe of your ſquire or compaſſes, may fall with right Angles vpon
the former right line drawne from D. to E. and where it falleth,
there ſet downe a prick marked with the letter H. That done ſéeke
out the greater Latitude which is 51. degrées and 32′· in the foreſaid
Demicircle, beginning to account the ſame from A. towards
B. and at the end of that Latitude ſet downe another pricke, marked
with the letter I. from whence drawe another perpendicular
line that may fall by helpe of your ſquire or compaſſes, with right

Angles vpon the Diameter A. C. and there make a pricke marked
with the letter K. That done take with your compaſſe the diſtance
that is betwixt K. and H. which diſtance you muſt ſet down
vpon the ſaid Diameter A. C. ſetting the one foote of your Compaſſe
vpon K. and the other towards the Centre D. & there make
a pricke marked with the letter L. then take with your Compaſſe
the length of the ſhorter perpendicular line G. H. and apply that
wideneſſe vppon the longer perpendicular line I. K. ſetting the
one foote of your compaſſe at I. which is the end of the greater Latitude,
and extend the other foote towardes K. and there make a
pricke marked with the letter M. That done take the diſtance betwixt
L. and M. with your compaſſe and apply the ſame to the
Demicircle ſetting the one foote of your compaſſe in A. and the other
towards B. and there make a prick marked with the letter N.
And the number of degrées contained betwixt A. and N. will ſhew
the true diſtance of the two places which you ſhall finde to be 39.
degrées, which being multiplyed by 60. maketh in al 2340. miles,
and whenſoeuer you haue any minutes beſides the whole degrées,
remember to adde vnto the ſumme of degrées for euery minute one
mile. By Plancius ſkale you ſhall find the diſtance betwixt London
and Hieruſalem to be 3040. miles which are 700. miles too
many. But you haue to note by the way, that if the difference of
the Longitudes doth excéede the number of 180. then you muſt
ſubtract that excéeding difference out of 360. and the remainder
ſhalbe the difference of the Longitudes, and then worke in all
points as is before taught.
                     By this rule and the other two rules firſt declared, you ſhal eaſily
trie the ſkale of any Mappe whether it be true or not, ſo as
you firſt haue the true Longitude and Latitude of the two places
whoſe diſtance you ſéeke to know. And thus I end with Plancius
Map, hoping not to offend him with any thing that I haue added
thereunto for the better inſtruction of thoſe that haue not béene
exerciſed in ſuch matters.
                     And yet I had almoſt forgotten one thing, which is this, I
haue here before as you haue read, made mention of drawing certaine
perpendicular lines in the former figure of the Demicircle
by helpe of your Compaſſes. Wherefore I thinke it neceſſary here
to ſet downe the order thereof.
                  
                  
                     
                     How to make with you Compaſſes, a perpendicular line to
fal from any point giuen vpon another right line, making therwith
right angles without the helpe of any ſquire.
                     
                        SEt the firme foot of your
Compaſſe in the point
giuen, and extend the other
foote a little beyond
the line right againſt the point giuen,
& draw a ſecret Arch or portion
of a Circle that may cut the
ſaid liue in two points, and deuide
that part of the Arch which lieth
betwixt the two ſections into two
equall parts, ſetting a pricke in
the very midſt therof: then hauing
laid your ruler to that pricke, and
alſo to the point giuen, draw a right line, & that line wil fall vpon
the other line with right Angles, as you may ſée by this figure.

Though it be the common order of working to know by helpe
of the former table, the diſtance of two places differing onely in
Longitude, yet I thinke it a more ſure way to find it out per Tabulas
Sinuum, the rule whereof is thus.
                     Firſt take the difference of the two Longitudes, by ſubtracting
the leſſer out of the greater, and the halfe of that ſhall be the
Arch which you haue to ſéeke in the front of the Tables, then multiply
the ſine of that Arch by the ſine of the complement of the
common Latitude, and deuide the product thereof by the totall
ſine, the quotient whereof you muſt ſéeke out in the Tables amongeſt
the ſines, and the Arch of that ſine is the one halfe of the
diſtance, which being doubled ſhall be the whole diſtance contayning
degrées of the great Circle, and euery ſuch degrée contayneth
of Italian miles 60. and of German miles 15. and by working
thus you ſhall finde the diſtance betwixt Compoſtella and
Conſtantinople to be 1846. Italian miles, ſuppoſing the common
latitude to be 43. degrées, and the difference of their longitudes
to be 42. degrées 30′· And by working by the common table
you ſhall find the diſtance of thoſe two places to be 1827. Italian
miles as before, becauſe the common Table hath no minutes
of miles but onely ſeconds, which are not to be accounted of, & in
working by Appian his Table hauing minutes of miles, you ſhal
find the ſaid diſtance to be 2184. Italian miles, and by Mercator
his Map to be 1980. Italian miles, in whoſe Map the common
Latitude of the ſaid 2. places is 43. & the difference of their longitudes
is 44. 0′· And by the ſkale ſet down in Plancius his Map,
you ſhal find the diſtance to be 2520. Italian miles, in which Map
the cōmon Latitude of the two foreſaid places is 42. deg. 30′· and
the difference of their Longitudes is alſo 42. degrées 30′· Truely
I muſt néedes confeſſe that it is not ſo eaſie to make a ſkale or
trunke for a Mappe or a Carde drawne in plano, as for that
which is drawne vpon a round bodie or Globe: and therefore it
is no maruaile though the ſkales of Mappes drawne in plano,
and likewiſe the trunkes ſet downe in the Mariners Cardes doe
not alwayes ſhewe the true diſtance of places, which I beléeue
is to bee done as truely and a great deale more readily by my
friend Maiſter Wright his Semicircle before deſcribed, then by
the rules of Gaſparus Peucerus in his booke de dimenſione terrae,
                        
which rules doe depend vpon the knowledge of the quantitie
of the Angles and ſides of Sphericall Triangles, which kinde
of working is indéede more troubleſome and tedious then readie
or pleaſant. But if Maiſter Wright would make his Demicircle
an vniuerſall inſtrument to find out thereby all the thrée kinds
of diſtances as he promiſed me to doe, there were no way in mine
opinion worthie to be compared vnto it, neither for the trueneſſe,
eaſineſſe, nor readineſſe of working thereby.

                  To the Reader.
                  
                     OF Aſtrolabes I haue neuer ſeene but
three ſorts, Firſt that of Stofflerus, which
for theſe hundred yeares paſt or there abouts,
hath beene had in moſt price and
eſtimation, as an inſtrument containing
all the vſes, or at the leaſt the moſt part
of all other Mathematicall Inſtruments,
which becauſe it requireth almoſt for
euerie ſeuerall Latitude a ſeuerall Table: Gemma Friſius inuented
ſince another kind of Aſtrolabe, hauing but one Table
to ſerue for all Latitudes, and therefore he called it the Catholicon,
that is to ſay, an vniuerſall Aſtrolabe, which hath alſo
been moſt eſteemed & vſed many yeres. Since whoſe time, &
of very late yeares, one of our owne countriemen a Gentleman
of Reading beſides London, called M. Blagraue, hath greatly
augmented the ſaide Catholicon, and hath thereby as it were
newly inuented a third kind of Aſtrolabe, which he calleth the
Mathematicall Iewell, whereby are to be wrought more concluſions
then by any other one inſtrument whatſoeuer, for
which his moſt excellent inuention vſed therein, he deſerueth
great commendation. And to the intent that others which
haue not beene exerciſed in ſuch thinges, might the more eaſily
attaine to the better vnderſtanding of the ſaid Iewell: I
haue made a plaine deſcription of all the partes belonging to
the ſaid Iewell, without committing any offence (I hope) to
the Author thereof, to the intent that euery Gentleman might
haue the perfect knowledge and vſe of ſo worthie an inſtrument:
But broade Aſtrolabes though they be thereby the
truer, yet for that they are ſubiect to the force of the winde,

and thereby euer moouing and vnſtable, are nothing meete to
take the altitude of any thing, and ſpecially vppon the Sea,
which thing to auoide, the Spaniards doe commonly make
their Aſtrolabes or Rings narrow and waightie, which for the
moſt part are not much aboue fiue inches broad, and yet doe
waigh at the leaſt foure pound, and to that end the lower part
is made a great deale thicker then the vpper part towards the
ring or handle: Notwithſtanding moſt of our Engliſh Pilots
that be skilfull, doe make their ſea Aſtrolabes or ringes ſixe
or ſeuen inches broad, and therewith very maſsiue and heauie,
not eaſie to be mooued with euery winde, in which the
ſpaces of the degrees be the larger, and thereby the truer, of
which kinde of Aſtrolabes or Rings, I ſhall ſpeake hereafter
in my Treatiſe of Nauigation, and alſo of the Mariners
Croſſe ſtaffe. But whenſoeuer you haue to take the altitude
of the Sunne or of any other ſtarre be in wandering or fixed,
I would wiſh you to vſe the Mariners heauie and maſſiue
Aſtrolabe, which in mine opinion for that purpoſe, is the
ſitteſt and moſt aſſured inſtrument of all others and to finde
out all other concluſions by helpe of Maiſter Blagraue his
Iewell, or rather by helpe of the Celeſtiall Globe, which
for Aſtronomicall matters is the perfecteſt inſtrument of
all, in which are contained all the ſtarres both ſoutherne and
Northerne that haue beene heretofore knowne, and thoſe
that are lately knowne or ſhall be knowne hereafter may be
eaſily placed therein: which thing can not be ſo well perfourmed
in any Aſtrolabe were it neuer ſo great. But becauſe
the Globe is comberſome and not portable, and therewith
coſtly, and eſpecially if it bee of any greatneſſe, (for
the greater the better) and alſo if it chance to be broken
in any part of the bodie thereof, it can neuer bee made againe
perfectly whole, it is therefore no meete inſtrument
for euery Mariner to haue, but onely for ſuch as be of good
habilitie, in ſteede whereof to finde out manye neceſſarie
concluſions, Maiſter Blagraue his Mathematicall Iewell may
ſerue verie well, and ſpecially if it had on the backe parte
the like mater and Rete or Nette, to ſerue the South Latitude
of the worlde as it hath in the fore parte to ſerue the

North latitude, for then I beleeue verilie, that the chiefeſt
Sotherne ſtarre, as the Croſſe, the Southerne Triangle, Noahs
Doue or Pigeon, and another called Polophilax, latelie found
out by ſuch as haue travelled by ſea on the South ſide of
the Equinoctiall, might eaſilie be placed by Maiſter Blagraue
in that Rete, hauing once learned of the skilfull Seamen
the true longitude, latitude, and declination of the
ſaide Starres, ſo ſhoulde his Iewell in mine opinion bee
much more ſerviceable to the ſea men, then nowe it is, by
reaſon that thoſe fewe Southerne Starres that be contained
in his firſt Net, are nothing ſo nigh vnto the South pole,
as the Northerne Starres deſcribed in his firſt Net, are vnto
the North pole, amongſt which Northerne Starres, it
were verie neceſſarie for the Sea men, that the ſeuen principall
Starres as well of the great Beare as of the little Beare,
were all dulie placed in his firſt Net. Trulie if Maſter
Blagraue his affaires would ſuffer him to take paine herein,
I beleeue that his Iewell ſhould not be much inferiour to
the celeſtiall Globe, which indeede it repreſenteth, and
in ſo doing he ſhould greatly profite the ſea men, and deſerue
thereby great good will and commendations at their
handes.
               
            
            
               
                  What this word Aſtrolabe ſignifieth.
                  
                     BEfore I beginne to deſcribe vnto you
the ſaid Inſtrument and all other parts
thereof it ſhall not bee amiſſe to ſhew
you what this worde Aſtrolabe ſignifieth.
                  This worde Aſtrolabe is as much
to ſay as the handle or inſtrument of
the Starres, by helpe whereof the manifolde
motions and apparences of the
heauens and of the Starres therein contained are known, and
it is called of ſome a planiſpheare, becauſe it is both flat and
rounde, repreſenting the Globe or Spheare, hauing both
his Poles flatte both together, the ſhape or figure of which

Inſtrument I doe not here ſet downe becauſe the Inſtrument
it ſelfe is to be had for a ſmall price in diuers places of London,
which if you lay before you when you mind to reade this my
deſcription thereof here following, I doubt not but that you
ſhall finde euerie part thereof ſo plainlie explaned as you ſhal
need no other teache to inſtruct you therin, or to help you to
vnderſtand any of theſe Concluſions that are to be wrought
by that Inſtrument, and ſpeciallie thoſe which I haue here
ſet downe, ſuch as the Table following ſheweth, and as I
thought moſt meet for ſea men to know, and being throughlie
exerciſed in them, you ſhall the more eaſilie vnderſtand
the manifold and neceſſarie concluſions ſet down by Maſter
Blagnaue himſelfe in his owne booke, which booke I would
wiſh you to buy, and earneſtlie to ſtudie the ſame. But now
I will firſt deſcribe the ſaide Inſtrument, and then ſhew the
vſe thereof by ſo many concluſions as are contained in the table
hereafter following.
               
               
                  The deſcription of Maſter Blagraue his Aſtrolabe, otherwiſe
called the Mathematicall Iewell.
                  
                     TThis Aſtrolabe is diuided into two parts,
whereof the one is called the forepart, and
the other the backepart. The foreparte
containeth two principall partes, that is,
the Mater, which is vnmooueable, and the
Rete, which is mooueable. Againe, the
Mater is enuironed with a great circle,
called the Meridian, paſſing through the
2. Poles of the world marked with the letters A.B. and through
the two Solſticiall points of Cancer, and Capricorne marked
with the characters belonging to thoſe two Signes, and therfore

may verie well bée called the Collure of the 2. Solſtices. And
this circle is diuided by two croſſe Diameters iuto 4. quarters
euery quarter containing 90. degrées, ſo as the whole circumference
of the circle is 360. degrées, which degrées doe procéede
from 90. to 90.
                  Nowe as touching the 2. croſſe Diameters, the one paſſing
through the Center, and alſo through the two Poles,The 2. croſſe Diameters in the Mater. is the Axletrée
of the world, ſignifying ſometime the firſt Meridian, and
ſometime the right Horizon, and ſometime the line of ſixe
houres as well for the Morning as Euening, and then it is
the line of Eaſt and Weſt, and ſometime the line of North and
South.
                  And the other croſſe Diameter drawne with red incke, ſignifieth
moſt commonly the Equinoctiall,The Equinoctial. and ſometime the line of
Eaſt and Weſt, and ſometime the line of North, and South, and
eſpecially when you haue to finde out the 12. houſes of heauen,
to which end are ſet down in the outermoſt Meridian theſe foure
Latine words, firſt at the North pole marked with the letter A.
Oriens, which is as much to ſay, as the Eaſt part: and at the ſouth
Pole marked with the letter B. Occidens, which ſignifieth the
Weſt part: and at the ende of the ouerthwart Diameter, drawne
with red inke, and moſt commonly ſignifying the Equinoctiall,
marked with the letter C. on the right hande is ſet downe
Culmen Coeli, the higheſt part of heauen, which is the South,
at which ende the Ringle or handle is faſtened. And at the other
ende of the ſaide Diameter, marked on the left hande with
the Letter D. is ſet downe Imum Coeli, the loweſt parte of
heauen, which is the North. And by theſe two croſſe Diameters
the whole Mater is diuided into foure quarters, that
is, Northeaſt, and Southeaſt, Northweſt and Southweſt. The
Northeaſt quarter lyeth betwixt Imum Coeli, and the vpper
ende of the Axletrée, whereon is written Oriens. And the
Southeaſt quarter lieth betwixt the ſame point and Culmen
Coeli, and the Southweſt quarter lieth betwixt Culmen Coeli,
and the lower end: of the Axletrée, whereon is written Occidens,
and the Northweſt quarter lyeth betwixt the point Occidens and
Imum Coeli.
                  
                  Beſides theſe 2 croſſe Diameters the Mater is traced with 180

Meridians which doe paſſe through both the Poles,The Meridians and houre lines in the Mater. whereofthe
firſt paſſing through the center from Pole to Pole is the Collure
of the Equinoxes, becauſe it paſſeth through the firſt point
of Aries, and the firſt point of Libra, and is otherwiſe called the
Axletree, and ſignifieth ſometime the right Horizon, and ſomtime
the firſt Meridian from which vpon the Equinoctiall are counted
the degrées of longitude both Eaſt and Weſt. And al the foreſaid
Meridians are moſt commonly vſed as houre lines, for euery
15th. Meridan, counting from the Limbe, doeth ſignifie one
houre, for 15. degrées do make an houre, and 4. minutes do make
a degrée. And theſe hours at the end of euery 15th. Meridian are
marked in the bodie of the Mater ſomewhat aboue the Tropique
of Cancer with Arithmeticall Figures, procéeding from 1.
to 12. forwarde towardes the right hand, and againe are marked
ſomewhat beneath the Tropique of Capricorne with like
Figures, proceeding backward towardes the left hand. Whereof
the vpper numbers doe ſignifie the forenoone houres, and
the lower numbers the afternoone houres, and are placed ſo
as one ſelfe houre line doth paſſe through both numbers: for
the line of the eleuenth houre in the forenoone ſerueth alſo to
the firſt houre in the afternoone, and the forenoone houre of 10.
ſerueth alſo to the houre of two in the afternoone, and the
fore noone of 9. ſerueth to the houre of 3. in the afternoone:
and the forenoone houre of 8. ſerueth to the houre of 4. in the
after noone, and the forenoone houre of 7. ſerueth to the houre
of 5. in the afternoone, and the forenoone houre of 6. ſerueth
alſo to the 6. houre in the afternoone, and from thence foorth
towardes the left hande, 5. ſerueth to 7. 4. to 8. 3. to 9. 2. to
10. and 1. to 11. as before.
                  But when ſoeuer you haue to finde out anie houre amongſt
the houre lines in the Mater, remember that the Axletrée
which paſſeth through the Center and alſo through both the
Poles is alwayes the ſixt houre both of the morning and euening,
from which you ſhall the more eaſilie finde out any houre
that you ſéeke by allowing fiftéene Meridians to euery houre, as
is before ſaide. And you haue to note that all theſe Meridians
doe ſometime ſignifie euerie one a ſeuerall oblique Horizon,
ſauing that the firſt Meridian or Axletrée ſignifieth the right

horizon as hath bene ſaid before.How to finde out the Horizon of euey ſeuerall latitude. And to find out in the Mater the
horizon of euery latitude, reckon from the axletrée on both handes
ſo many Meridians as may make vp the number of degrees of
your latitude, and that Meridian ſhalbe your Horizon. In counring
of which Meridians you ſhall finde that euery fift Meridian
is drawne with a greater blacke line then the reſt. Nowe ouerthwart
theſe Meridians are drawne 180. Parallels,The Parallels of the Mater. which proceede
from 1. to 90. whoſe nombers are ſet downe in the dimbe
of the mater thus, 10. 20. 30. 40. and ſo forth both vpwarde and
downeward, vntill you come to 90. and theſe Paralle Is are otherwiſe
called the circles of declination as well of the Sunne as of any
ſtar. Amongſt which there be 2. Parallels painted red,The two Tropiques. where
of that towardes the North pole ſignifieth the tropique of Cancer,
and the other towards the South pole the tropique of Capricorne.
Then there is another oblique ouerthwart redde lyne,
which paſſing through the center from Tropique to Tropique,
ſignifieth the Ecliptique line,The Ecliptickline of the Mater night vnto which on each ſide are
ſet downe the Characters of the twelue Signes, whereof Aries
and Libra are placed at the center, and Cancer at the one end of
the Ecliptique on your right hand, whereas it toucheth the ſaid
Tropique, and Capricorne at the other ende of the ſaide Ecliptique,
on your left hand, whereas it toucheth the ſaid Tropique
of Capricorne, and the reſt of the ſignes are orderly placed betwixt
the ſaid Tropiques, euery two Signes one againſt another
that haue like declination, as Gemini and Leo, Taurus and
Virgo, which are placed betwixt the center and Cancer, then Piſces
and Scorpio, and Aquarius and Sagittarius are placed betwixt
the Center and Capricorne. And euery Signe contained
in the Ecliptique line is diuided with ſlaunting black ſtréeks into
15. ſpaces, euery ſpace containing two degrées, which maketh
180. degrées, and béeing doubled, becauſe the ſpaces are to bée
counted doth forward and backward, do make in all 360. degrées,
which is the whole circuit or longitude of the Ecliptique, and
the degrées of the ſaid Ecliptique are larger towards the Limb
than towards the Center, whereby the ſpaces betwixt Signe and
ſigne are not equall, but ſome larger than other ſome.
                  And note that vppon the outermoſt Limbe of the Mater are
drawne thrée circles making two reaſonable ſpaces,The Limbe of the Mater. both which

ſpaces are diuided into 360. degr. both of them beginning at the
North pole. And the degrées in the outermoſt ſpace of the Limbe,
beginning at the North pole do procéede from 15. to 15. downward
towards your left hand, and ſo round about the inſtrument
vntill you come to 360. which degrées do ſhew the houres of the
Equinoctiall. And at the North pole, whereas the diuiſion beginneth,
is ſet downe the figure of 6. ſignifying the ſixt houre
of the forenoone, then counting fiftéen degrées downwarde
towards your left hand is ſet down in the foreſaid ſpace the figure
of 5. then 4. 3. 2. and 1. And at the end of the Equinoctiall on the
left hande is ſet downe 12. from which procéeding ſtill downewards
are ſet theſe numbers of houres, 11. 10. 9. 8. 7. and
6. which 6. ſtandeth at the South pole, then from thence procéeding
vpwardes are ſet downe theſe houres 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. and then
12. which ſtandeth at the end of the Equinoctiall on the right
hand, from whence procéeding ſtill vpwards towards the North
pole, are ſet downe theſe houres, 11. 10. 9. 8. & 7. and at the Pole
it ſelfe is ſet downe the figure of 6. as before hath bene ſaid, from
whence you firſt began to count. And in the inner ſpace of the
ſame Limbe, the 360. degrées are to bee counted by 90. in ſuch
ſort as the firſt 90. is placed at the North pole, the ſecond 90. at
the one ende of the Equinoctiall marked with C. The third 90.
at the South pole, marked with B. And the fourth 90 at the other
end of the Equinoctiall, marked with D. Euery which quarter
is to be counted both vpward and downwarde, according as you
ſée the numbers written with Arithmeticall figures, and are
placed one aboue another in the ſaide ſpace, whereof the vpper
figures are ſomewhat leſſer than the nether figures, both of
them procéeding from 1. to 90. the greater figures from the
Equinoctiall vpward to the verie Pole, and the leſſer Figures
from the Pole downward to the Equinoctiall, and are thus ſet
downe. 10. 20. 30. 40.
               
               
                  
                  A Deſcription of the Nette, called in
Latine Rete.
                  
                     THis parte is firſt inuironed rounde about
with a great circle ſignifying moſt commonlie
the Meridian or 90. Azimuth or
Verticall circle, and ſometime it ſignifieth
the Equinoctiall, and eſpeciallie when
the Center is taken from the Pole, which
Circle is diuided by two croſſe Diameters
into foure quarters, euerie quarter
contayning 90. degrées, which degrées are to be numbred
in the verie Limbe of the Rete both vpwarde and downwarde,
and of thoſe two croſſe Diameters, the one ende marked with
the letter A. ſignifieth the Zenith, and the other end marked
with the letter B. ſignifieth the Nadir or point oppoſite, and
the other croſſe Diameter marked with the letters C. D. ſignifieth
the Horizon, which for diſtinctions cauſe is otherwiſe called
the Finitor, becauſe the Meridians before deſcribed in the
Mater are to be called and vſed ſometimes as Horizons and this
Finitor is a pretie broade Ruler, the verie edge whereof is
diuided with ſmall diuiſions into 180. degrées, which being
doubled by reckoning the ſame both forwarde and backwarde,
(beginning at the Center) doe make vp thrée hundred and thrée
ſcore degrées.
                  This Finitor ſignifieth the Horizon of the Globe,The Finitor the verie
edge whereof being diuided by little ſhort ſtréekes into ſmall
portions or degrées, is alwayes to be applyed to any ſeuerall latitude
when néede is. And the broader part thereof ſerueth onely to
containe the numbers that are ſet therein both beneath and aboue
to knowe thereby the number of euerie Azimuth hereafter
deſcribed, which numbers doe procéede from the Center
to the right hand thus, 10. 20. 30. 40. 50. and ſo foorth to
90. Then backwarde towardes the Center are ſet downe 100.
110. 120. 130. 140. and ſo forth vntil you come to 180. which
is placed at the verie Center. Then from thence towards the
left hande are ſet downe theſe numbers 190. 200. 210. and

ſo foorth vntill you come to 270. and from thence turning againe
towards the center are ſet downe 280. 290. and ſo foorth vntill
you come to 360. placed at the Center.
                  And in the ſaid Net are certaine circles,The Almican teraths. which are Parallels
to the foreſaide Finitor, procéeding towards the Zenith, and are
in euerie reſpect like vnto the Parallels deſcribed in the Mater,
and theſe Parallels are called Almicanteraths, that is to ſay, circles
of Altitude, which beginning at the Finitor, doe procéede to
the Zenith, marked with the letter A. from 1. to 90. And though
there be out out in the Rete but 30. Almicanteraths, yet for ſo
much as euery ſpace contained betwixt euery 2. Almicanteraths
do containe 3. degrées, they make in all 90. for 3. times 30. maketh
90. which degrées you may ſée ſet downe in the Limbe of the
Rete on both hands thus, 10. 20. 30. and ſo foorth, till you come
to 90. which ſtandeth at the very Zenith.
                  And theſe Almicanteraths are croſſed with other circles called
Azimuthes,The Azimuthes. that is to ſay, Verticall circles, which paſſing from
the Finitor, do méet all in the Zenith, whereof though in this inſtrument
there be ſet downe but 12. being 15. degrées diſtant one
from another, yet you muſt imagine that there be 180. which the
degrees ſet downe in the Finitor, in ſuch manner as is before
deſcribed do ſhew. And you haue to note that if the Sunne bée
in the very beginning of the Azimuthes, which is at the center,
then is hée full Eaſt, and if he be in the 90. Azimuth, then he is
full South, and when he is in the 180. then he is full Weſt, and
when hée is in the 270. Azimuth, then hée is full North.
                  And if you would haue this account of the Azimuthes to aunſwere
the Mariners compaſſe,How to count the Azimuthes according to the Mariners Compaſſe. then diuide the number of the Azimuthes
wherein the Sunne is by 11. degrées and ¼ which is
15. minutes, and the quotient will ſhew the rombe or winde of the
Mariners Compaſſe, ſo as in your account you procéed from the
firſt Azimuth towardes your right hand, that is, from Eaſt to
South, and from South to Weſt, and from Weſt to the North,
and ſo from thence againe to the Eaſt point whereas you firſt began.
Alſo you haue to note by the way, that theſe Azimuthes doe
ſometime ſignifie the circles of poſition, the vſe whereof you ſhall
find ſet downe hereafter in the 31. poſition of this Treatiſe.
                  In the meane time I wil procéed in deſcribing the Zodiaque,

of the Rete, which in ſhape is like to an Egge,The deſcription of the Zodiaque of the Rete called in Latine
Figura ovalis, the one halfe whereof extendeth towardes the Zenith,
and the other towards the Nadir or point oppoſite to the ſaid
Zenith, in which circle are placed the 12. Signes, whereof the
6. Northern ſignes, that is, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer,
Leo, and Virgo are placed in the nether halfe towards the Nadir,
and the other ſixe Southerne Signes, that is, Libra, Scorpio,
Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Piſces, are placed
in the vpper halfe of the Zodiaque towards the Zenith, and
euerie one of theſe Signes are diuided into 30. degrées, which
are ſet downe with Arithmeticall Figures in the ſaid Zodiaque
thus, 10. 20. 30.
                  Moreouer, in the ſaid Net are placed certaine fixed Starres toOf Starres 71 contayned in the Rete.

foreſaid booke.
                  And beſides the partes before deſcribed,A deſcription of the Labell. there is yet another

                  Thus much touching the fore part of M. Blagraue his Iewell
with euerie particular part, with which forepart I wiſh you to
be throughlie acquainted before you deale with the propoſitions
here following, or with any other propoſition contained in M.
Blagraue his booke.
               
               
                  A briefe deſcription of the backe parte of
the ſaide Iewell.
                  
                     IN the Limbe of the backe part is deſcribed
the Theorique of the Sunne, to knowe
therby in what Signe and degrée the Sunne
is euerie day throughout the yeare, by laying
the Diopter thereto, M. Blagraue calleth
it a Ruler, which Diopter is made with
two Pinules or ſquare Tablets, each one
pearced with two holes one greater than
another, the leſſer to take the height of the Sunne by his
beame paſſing through the ſaide leſſer holes, and the greater

with your one eie, the other béeing ſhutte, through the
two greater holes of the Pinules or Tablettes. And the middeſt

of this Diopter is faſtened with a pin to the center of the Aſtrolabe,
ſo as the ſaide Diopter may turne round about, and the
middle line of the ſaid Diopter is called the fiducial line, becauſe
it rightlie directeth the ſight of the eye to the foreſaid holes, the
degrées of the altitude of the Sunne or of anie Starre are ſet
downe in the outermoſt ſpace of the Limbe, diuided by 2. croſie
Diameters into foure quarters, euerie quarter contayning 90.

figures right ouer the heades of the ſaide degrées of altitude.
And you haue to note, that the perpendicular Diameter ſignifieth
the Meridian, that is, the line of South and North, that is
to ſay, the South point at the ring or handle, and the North at
the point oppoſite, and the other ouerthwart Diameter ſignifieth
the right Horizon, that is to ſay, the line of Eaſt and Weſt, the
Eaſt being placed on the left hande, and the Weſt on the right
hand. And vnder the Theorique of the Sunne you may drawe

not leape yeare, and alſo the oppoſite point of that degree.
The firſt. Propoſition.
                  
                     LAy the Diopter which is on the backſide of
the Aſtrolabe vpon the day of the moneth
and that end of the Diopter with his fiduciall
line will ſhew you in what ſigne
and degrée thereof the Sunne is that day,
and the other ende of the Diopter will
ſhewe you the oppoſite point to that degrée,
as for example: I would know the
place of the Sunne the 17. of Iuly, here
by laying the Diopter vpon that day, I find the Sunne to be in
the fourth degrée of Leo, and the oppoſite point thereof to bee the
fourth degrée of Aquarius.
                  
               
               
                  
                  How to know the place of the Sunne in the Leape yeare
and how to finde the leape yeare.
Propoſition. 2.
                  
                     WHen it is leape yeare, you muſt alwayes adde one
degree more euerie day during that yeare vnto the
place of the Sunne found by the firſt propoſition,
which leape yeare you ſhall know by diuiding the
yeare of the Lord by 4. for if there be no remander
left, then that yeare is leape yeare, ſo ſhall you finde the yeare
of our Lord 1596. to be leape yeare.
               
               
                  How to take the altitude of the Sunne, or of any ſtarre.
Propoſition. 3.
                  
                     TO take the altitude in any time of the day when
the Sunne ſhineth, you muſt turne your face
and alſo the left Tablet or Pinule of the Diopter
towards the Sunne, holding the Aſtrolabe by
the ring with your right forefinger or middle finger
being the ſomewhat bowed, in ſuch ſort as the Aſtrolabe
may hang plumbe, and then with your left hand lift the
Diopter vp and downe vntill the Sun with his beame due iuſtlie
ſtréeke through both the holes of each Pinule of the Diopter, ſo
as you may ſée the ſhadow of the two holes of the vpper Pinule
to play vpon the two holes of the nether Pinule, then marke vpon
what degrée of altitude the thinneſt edge or fiduciall line of
the Diopter falleth in the outermoſt ſkirt or border of the backe
of the Aſtrolabe, for that is the Sunnes altitude for that preſent.
But if the Sun be couered with a cloud, ſo as it ſhineth not cleare
mough to caſt any ſhadow, and yet ſo as it may be ſéene with the
eie, then hang the Aſtrolabe by the ring vpon your right thomb,
and turning your face towards the Sun▪ lift vp your hand with
the Aſtrolabe ſo high, as by moouing the Diopter with your left
hande vp and downe, you may with your right eie (the other
béeing ſhut) ſée the Sunne through the greater holes of both
the Pinules of the Diopter, and marke vppon what degrée

of altitude the vpper ende of the Diopter falleth, and that is the
altitude of the ſunne at the time, and in this maner you muſt alſo
take in the night ſeaſon, the altitude of any ſtarre.
               
               
                  How to take the Meridian altitude, that is to ſay, the higheſt
or greateſt altitude of the Sunne or of any ſtarre.
The 4. Propoſition.
                  
                     GOe into ſome open place whereas the ſunne ſhineth
ſomewhat before noonetide, and there hanging the Aſtrolabe
vpon your right fore finger or middle finger,
take the altitude of the ſunne in ſuch manner as is before
taught, at diuerſe times with ſome pawſe betwixt euery time
to know therby whether ſuch altitude increaſeth or decreaſeth, for
if it increaſeth, then the ſunne is not yet at the Meridian, but if it
decreaſeth, then it is paſt the Meridian, and therefore you muſt
watch diligently to take him when hee is at the higheſt. And you
muſt do the like to take in the night ſeaſon, the Meridian altitude
of any knowne ſtarre, ſauing that then you muſt hange your Aſtrolabe
vpon your thumbe before your right eye, and to doe as is
taught in the laſt Propoſition.
               
               
                  How to know the altitude of the ſun, or of any ſtarre at any
houre of the day without ſeeing the ſunne or ſtarre.
The 5. Propoſition.
                  
                     SEt the Finitor at your Latitude, and ſéeke out amongſt
the houre lines or Meridians of ye Mater in what point
the Parallel or Circle of declination of the ſun croſſeth
the houre line which you ſéeke, and the Almicanterath
and Azimuth paſſing through that point do ſhew both the altitude
and alſo the coaſt or part of heauen, wherein the ſunne or ſtarre is
at that inſtant. This is a very neceſſary Propoſition, for by knowing
the height of the ſunne at euery houre of the day in whatſoeuer
ſigne the ſunne is you may make Tables for particular dials,
as Cylinders, houre Quadrants, and ſuch like to ſerue any latitude,
yea rather this Inſtrument as M. Blagraue rightly ſayeth
is a Table of it ſelfe readie made to ſerue ſuch purpoſes. Let

the example of this Propoſition be thus, Suppoſe that at 8. of the
clocke in the morning the 21. of Aprill 1592. the ſunne being then
in the tenth degrée of Taurus, and his declination 15. degrées
Northward, you would knowe the altitude of the ſunne at that
houre, which by working as the rule teacheth, you ſhall finde to
be almoſt 30. degrées, and that hee is about 13. degrées diſtant
from the Eaſt towards the South.
               
               
                  How to know the Meridian altitude of the ſunne, or of any
ſtarre euery day throughout the yeare, without ſeeing eyther
ſunne or ſtarre.
The 6. Propoſition.
                  
                     FIrſt ſéeke to know the declination of the ſunne or ſtar
eyther by the ſeuenth Propoſition next following, or
elſe by ſome Table, & whether it be North or South.
and knowing his declination, bring the Finitor to
your Latitude, and ſtaying it there ſéeke out in the
limbe of the mater on your right hande the ſaid declination, and
there marke what Almicanterath toucheth that point, for that Almicanterath
being counted vppon the limbe of the Rete from the
Finitor, doth by and by ſhew the Meridian altitude of the ſunne or
ſtarre for that day. As for example, I would know the Meridian
altitude of the ſunne the firſt of Iuly 1592. at which time his Parallel
or declination is 22. degrées and certaine minutes Northward.
Here hauing layde the Finitor to the Latitude 52. I finde
that the 60. Almicanterath toucheth the Parallel, and that is the
Meridian altitude of the ſunne that day. Againe ſuppoſe that I
would know the Meridian altitude of the ſtarre Oculus Tauri, in
the Latitude 52. Here hauing brought the Finitor to the ſaid latitude,
I finde that the 53. Almicanterath toucheth his Parallel
or declination, which is 15. degrées 49′· Northward, ſo as I find
his Meridian altitude in that latitude to be 53. degrées. But you
haue to note that if the ſun or ſtar haue ſouth declination, then you
muſt count his parallel from the Equinoctial downward towards
the ſouth Pole, ſo ſhall you find the Meridian altitude of the great
dogge called Canis maior, whoſe Southerne declination is 16.
degrées to be 22. degr. & 30′· And by knowing the Meridian altitude

of any ſtar, you may alſo knowe how farre he is diſtant from
the Meridian or South line, if you ſubtract from his Meridian
altitude his altitude taken at any other time of the ſame night, for
the remainder will ſhew his diſtance from the Meridian, & if the
ſtarre at the time of taking his altitude, be in the Eaſt part of the
firmament, then he is ſo much ſhort of the Meridian, and if he be
in the Weſt, then he is ſo much paſt the Meridian. As for example,
knowing the Meridian altitude of Oculus Tauri to be 53 degrées,
and his other altitude newly taken to be 30. deg. I find his
diſtance from the Meridian to be 23. deg. aſwel by ſubtraction, as
by counting vpon the limbe of the Rete the degrées contained betwixt
the two foreſaid Almicanteraths. And becauſe the ſaid ſtarre
was in the Eaſt part of the firmament when I tooke his altitude, I
conclude that he wanted 25. degrées of arriuing to the Meridian,
which maketh one houre and a halfe, and a little more.
               
               
                  How to find the declination of the ſunne, or of any ſtarre
deſcribed in the net.
The 7. Propoſition.
                  
                     THis may be done two maner of waies, firſt knowing
the place of the ſunne, ſéeke his place in the
Ecliptique line of the mater, and looke what Parallel
of the mater paſſeth through that degrée,
and the number of that Parallel will ſhew the declination
(that is to ſay) how farre the ſunne is
diſtant from the Equinoctiall, counting from the Equinoctiall vpon
the outermoſt Meridian or inner limbe of the mater, and according
as the ſigne wherein the ſunne is be it Northerne or Southerne,
ſo is the declination of the ſunne, and muſt bee counted
eyther vpwarde or downewarde accordingly. The ſeconde way
is thus, bring the Fiduciall liue of the labell to the degrée of the
ſunne in the Zodiaque of the net, and the number of degrées counted
vpon the labell betwixt the limbe of the net, and the place of
the ſunne which the labell toucheth vpon the outward edge of the
ſayde Zodiaque will ſhewe his declination. By either of theſe
two wayes you ſhall finde the declination of the Sunne, being in

the tenth degrée of Taurus to be 15. degrées Northward. And
by this laſt way you may know the declination of any ſtarre contained
in the net thus. Hauing found in the net the ſtarre whoſe
declination you ſéeke, lay the Fiduciall line of the labell to the
longeſt tippe of that ſtarre, then count vpon the labell how many
degrées are contained betwixt the limbe of the Rete, and that
point whereas the labell toucheth the longeſt tippe of the ſaide
ſtarre, and that ſhall be his declination either Northerne or Southern
according as the ſaid tippe point either outward or inward:
for if outward from the Centre, then it is Northerne, if inwarde
towardes the Centre, then it is Southerne, as hath béene ſayde
before in the deſcription of the Net, and by doing thus you ſhall
find that the ſtarre called Canis maior, that is the greater dogge,
hath in South declination 15. degrées 55′· Againe you ſhall finde
the firſt ſtarre of the Rams horne called Cornu Arietis to haue in
North declination 18. degrées.
               
               
                  How to find out the Latitude of any Region.
The 8. Propoſition.
                  
                     FIrſt you muſt know the place of the ſunne, and alſo his
declination, and hauing taken his Meridian altitude,
recken the ſame amongſt the Almicanterathes from
the Finitor vpwardes, and turne about the Rete from
the Pole arctique towards the Equinoctiall on your right hande,
vntill it toucheth the Parallel of the ſunne, for then looke on your
left hand and you ſhall finde the Finitor to ſtand at that Latitude
which you ſéeke. As for example, the 12. of Aprill 1591. the ſunne
being in the firſt degrée 20. minutes of Taurus, and his declination
being then 12. degrées Northward, I finde his Meridian altitude
to be 50. degrées, which I count vpon the limbe of the Rete
procéeding from the Finitor vpwardes towards the Zenith, and
then I turne the Rete vntill I haue brought that Almicanterath
to the Parallel of the Sunne, which is 12. degrées, counting the
ſame from the Equinoctiall on the right hande of the mater towardes
the North Pole, and there ſtaying the Rete, I finde
that on the left hande the Finitor lyeth vpon the 52. degrée of
Latitude counting from the North pole downe towardes the

Equinoctiall. The common way of finding the Latitude is thus,
if it be in the day time, then take the Meridian altitude of the
Sunne, and if the Sunne be in any of the ſixe Northerne ſignes,
then ſubtract the declination of the ſunne out of his Meridian altitude,
and the remainder ſhall be the altitude of the Equinoctiall
aboue your Horizon, which being taken out of 90. the remainder
will ſhew the altitude of the Pole, but if the ſunne be in any of the
ſixe Southerne ſignes, then you muſt adde his declination to his
Meridian altitude, and the ſumme thereof ſhall be the altitude of
the Equinoctiall, which being taken out of 90. the Remamder
will ſhew the Latitude or eleuation of the Pole. But to know the
latitude of any place in the night ſeaſon, you muſt take the Meridian
altitude of ſome knowne ſtarre which both riſeth and ſetteth,
then after that you haue taken his Meridian altitude with your
Aſtrolabe, you muſt learne to knowe his declination, and whether
it be Northerne or Southerne, for if the ſtarre haue North declination,
then you muſt ſubtract his declination from his Meridian
altitude, and the remainder ſhall be the Altitude of the Equinoctiall,
which being taken out of 90. ſhall be the latitude or eleuation
of the Pole, but if the declination of the ſtar be Southernly,
then you muſt adde his declination to his Meridian altitude, and
that ſumme ſhal be the altitude of the Equinoctiall, which béeing
taken out of 90. the remainder ſhall be the eleuation of the Pole.
And there be diuers other wayes of finding out the latitude of any
place, which I haue partly ſet downe in my Treatiſe of the two
Globes about the latter ende thereof, and partly in my Treatiſe
of Nauigation, whereas I ſpeake of the North ſtarre and of
his Guardes.
               
               
                  How to know the houre of the day by the Sunne, and alſo
in what part of heauen he is at that inſtant.
The 9. Propoſition.
                  
                     TAke the altitude of the Sunne, and knowing the latitude
of the place where you are, bring the Finitor
of the Rete to that Latitude, and hauing ſtayed
it there, looke in what point the Almicanterath or
altitude of the Sunne croſſeth the Suns Parallell

or Circle of declination in the mater, and the houre line paſſing
through that point will ſhew the true houre, and at that inſtant
you may alſo know in what Azimuth (that is to ſay) in what part
of heauen, or as the Mariners terme it in what r
                        •
                     mbe or winde,
as Eaſt, Weſt, North, or South &c. the Sunne is at that inſtant,
for that Azimuth which paſſeth through the foreſaide point, is the
Azimuth of the Sunne. As for example, the 21. of Aprill 1592.
the ſunne being in the tenth degrée of Taurus, and his declination
being then 15. degrées Northward, I find by the Aſtrolabe, Quadrant,
or Croſſe-ſtaffe, the altitude of the Sunne in the forenoone
to be 30. degrées. Wherefore I hauing laide the Finitor to my
Latitude which is 52. and ſtayed it there, I marke in what point
the Almicanterath cutteth the ſunnes foreſaid Parallell in the mater,
and I find that the houre line of eight in the forenoone cutteth
that point, which ſheweth that it was then eight of the clocke in
the morning, and that the ſunne was about 14. degrées diſtant
from the Eaſt towards the South.
               
               
                  How to find the riſing and ſetting of the ſunne euery day in
euery Latitude, and thereby the length of the day, and in what
coaſt or part of the Horizon be riſeth and ſetteth.
The 10. Propoſition.
                  
                     BRing the Finitor to your Latitude, and ſtaying
it there, looke in the mater where the Parallel
of the Sunne doth cut the Finitor, and
the houre line which croſſeth that point, will
ſhewe the houre of his riſing and ſetting, and
the number of houres betwixt his riſing and
ſetting is the length of the day, and the number
of the Azimuthes betwixt that point of the Finitor, and the Centre
or firſt Azimuth will ſhew you in what part or coaſt of the Horizon
he both riſeth and ſetteth. As for example, ſéeking by this
rule to knowe at what houre the ſunne riſeth the 19. of Iune 1592.
he being then in the ſixth degrée 39. minutes of Cancer, and his
declination then 23. degrées 19′· I find that he riſeth 12. minutes
before foure, and goeth downe 12. minutes after 8. and thereby I
find the length of the day counting from ſunne riſe to ſunne ſet to

be 16. houres and 24. minutes, and that he riſeth from the Eaſt
towardes North 40. degrées, which according to the Mariners
reckoning is Northeaſt and by Eaſt two quarters and ſomewhat
more towards the North.
               
               
                  How to knowe euery day at what houre the Moone riſeth
and ſetteth, and how long ſhe continueth aboue the Horizon,
and alſo when ſhe is full South.
The 11. Propoſition.
                  
                     FIrſt you muſt learne by ſome Almanacke or Ephemerides
in what ſigne and degrée the Moone is, and
whether it be a Northerne ſigne or a Southern ſigne,
for if ſhe be in a Northerne ſigne, then bring her place
to the Horizon of your latitude in the Northeaſt part
of the Aſtrolabe, but if ſhe be in a Southerne ſigne bring her place
to the ſaid Horizon in the Southeaſt part of the Aſtrolabe, & there
hauing ſtayed the Rete bring the labell to the place of the Sun for
that day, & the labell will point to the houre of the Moones riſing
in the limbe of the mater: but becauſe the Almanack or Ephemerides
do not ſet downe ye true place of the Moone but only at noone,
you muſt therfore conſider whether it be in the forenoone or in the
afternoone that you ſéeke, for if it be in the afternoone you had néed
to know how many houres are run from noone, and then for euery
houre to adde halfe a degrée to the place of the Moone which you
found at noonetide, but if it be in the forenoone, then you muſt ſubtract
from her place at noone, for euery houre halfe a degrée, ſo ſhal
you go very nigh to finds her true place in the Zodiaque for that
houre, though you know not her latitude which is but 5. deg. at the
moſt, & therfore can cauſe no great error in this matter. Now to
knowe when ſhe ſetteth you muſt do thus, if the Moone be in any
Northern ſigne, thē you muſt bring her place to the foreſaid Horizon
in the Northweſt part of the Aſtrolabe, & by laying the labell
to the place of the ſunne, it will point to the houre of her ſetting,
but if ſhe be in any Southerne ſigne, you muſt bring her place to
the Horizon in the Southweſth part of the Aſtrolabe, and the labell
being laide to the place of the Sunne will point to the houre of
her ſetting. Now if you would knowe how long time ſhe is aboue

the Horizon, and alſo at what houre ſhe is full South, then count
the houres betwixt her riſing & ſetting, and that ſhall be the time
of her continuance aboue the Horizon, and the very middeſt of
that is the true houre that ſhe is full South: As for example, the
fourth day of September 1592. in the latitude 52. at nine of the
clocke at night the Sunne being in the 21. degrées 47′· of Virgo
or there abouts, & the Moone being in the 2. degrée 30′· of Capricorne,
I am deſirous to know when the Moone did riſe that day,
and by working according to the rule before ſet downe, I founde
that ſhe did riſe about thrée of the clocke in the afternoone, and that
ſhe went downe at tenne of the clocke at night and halfe an houre
paſt, and that ſhe was full South or at the Meridian a little before
ſeuen of the clocke in the afternoone. And as by this rule you
may finde out the time of the riſing and ſetting of the Moone, ſo
may you finde the time of the riſing and ſetting of the other fiue
Planets, that is Saturne, Iupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury,
any day throughout the yeare, ſo as you know their places in the
Zodiaque, which the Ephemerides of Stadius doth ſhewe, not
onely at noonetide, but alſo at any other houre of the day by helpe
of certaine Tables made of purpoſe, the vſe of which Tables I
haue ſet downe in the latter end of my Treatiſe of the two globes.
               
               
                  How to find out the right aſcention of the ſunne, or of any
degree or portion of the Ecliptique.
The 12. Propoſition.
                  
                     TAke the Rete and the label cleane from the Aſtrolabe,
and ſéeke out in the Ecliptique line of the
mater the ſigne and degrée whoſe right aſcention
you would know, and marke what Meridian cutteth
that point: that done, place the labell vpon
the pinne which ſtandeth in the very Centre of
the Iewell, and make the fiduciall line thereof to lie right vppon,
and alongeſt the Equinoctiall line eyther towardes your right
hand or towards your left, according as the ſigne & degrée whoſe
aſcention you ſéeke is placed in the mater. Then marke where the
foreſaid Meridian cutteth through the labell, and alſo through the

Equinoctiall line, and the number of degrées contained in the
labell, betwixt the Centre and that point of the Equinoctial is the
right aſcention of that degrée of the Ecliptique which you ſéeke,
which number of degrées you muſt count vpon the labell in this
maner. For if that ſigne and degrée be contained betwixt the firſt
point of Aries and the firſt point of Cancer, then you muſt begin
to count vpon the labell at the Centre, and ſo procéede forwarde
towards Cancer, the right aſcention of whoſe firſt point is 90. degrées,
but if the ſigne and degrée which you ſéeke, be betwixt the
beginning of Cancer and the beginning of Libra, which is at
the very Centre right againſt Aries, then you muſt count vpon
the labell backward from 90. to 180. by adding to euery tenth
ſpace of the labell 10. degrées, ſo as the firſt number procéeding
towards your left hand ſhall be 100. and next to that 110. and ſo
foorth vntill you come to 130. which is the right aſcention of the
firſt point of Libra, and from Libra you muſt count towards Capricorne
190. then 200. and ſo foorth till you come to 270. which
is the right aſcention of the firſt point of Capricorne: and from
thence you muſt count 280. 290. then 300. and ſo foorth towards
the Centre vntill you come to 360. which is the right aſcention of
the laſt point of Piſces, ſo as though there be ſet downe in the
labell but 90 degrées both forward and backwarde, yet 90. being
foure times repeated, doe make in all 360. which is the whole
Longitude of the Equinoctiall. As for example, you would know
perhaps the right aſcention of the tenth degrée of Sagittarius,
here by ſéeking in the mater you ſhall find that the Meridian paſſing
through that degrée will cut both the labell being layde towards
your left hande, and alſo the Equinoctiall in the 248. degrées
21. minutes, which is the right aſcention of the tenth degrée
of Sagittarius, in counting whereof remember to beginne
from 180. that is from the Centre, and this aſcention agréeth
with the Table of right aſcentions ſet downe in Stadius his Ephemerides
the 44. page of his booke. Againe in ſéeking to know
the right aſcention of the 10. degrée of Taurus, if you beginne
to count vpon the labell from the Centre, which is the firſt point
of Aries, you ſhall finde that the Meridian which paſſeth through
the 10. degrées of Taurus will cut the labell, and the Equinoctiall
line in the 37. degrée 35′·
               
               
                  
                  Another morereadie way to finde out the right aſcention of
any degree or portion of the Ecliptique by the Rete.
The 13. Propoſition.
                  
                     LAy the Finitor eauen with the Axletrée, ſignifying
here the right Horizon, ſo as the firſt point of Aries
may méete with the Eaſt point of the ſaide Horizon,
and lay the labell right vpon and alongeſt the Equinoctiall
line, eyther towardes Cancer or towardes
Capricorne, according as the ſigne and degrée which you
ſéeke is placed in the Ecliptique of the Mater, and marke therewith
what Meridian paſſeth through that degrée, and follow the
ſame vntill it cutteth the Equinoctiall, and alſo the labell lying
thereon, and by counting vpon the labell the number of degrées
to that point in ſuch order as is before taught, you ſhall haue your
deſire. As for example, if you ſéeke to knowe the right aſcention of
the tenth degrée of Leo, here hauing placed the Finitor as before
is taught, ſéeke out in the Mater what Meridian paſſing through
that degrée cutteth the ſaid Equinoctiall, and in what point, and
lay the labell to the ſaid Equinoctial according as the ſigne requireth,
be it towards Cancer or Capricorne, and by counting the
degrées vpon the labell as is before taught, that is from 90. procéeding
from the limbe backeward towardes the Centre you ſhall
finde the right aſcention of the 10. degrée of Leo to be 132. degrées,
which differeth from the foreſaid Table but 27′· a thing of
ſmall moment conſidering the narrowe ſpaces of the Meridians
in the Mater.
               
               
                  How to finde out the aſcentionall difference of the ſunne,
or of any degree or point of the Ecliptique.
The 14. Propoſition.
                  
                     BRing the Finitor to your Latitude, and there ſtaying
it looke amongſt the Meridians in the Mater in what
point the Parallel of the Sunne cutteth the Finitor,
and the number of the Meridians contayned betwixt

the Axletree, and that point ſhall be the aſcentionall difference.
As for example, in the Latitude 52. I would knowe the aſcentionall
difference of the Sunne being in the fourth degrée of Cancer,
at which time his Parallel of declination is 23. degrees Northward,
here by working according to the rule I finde the aſcentionall
difference to be 33. degrées 30′·
               
               
                  How to find out the oblique aſcention of the ſunne, or of
any point of the Ecliptique.
The 15. Propoſition.
                  
                     HAuing found the right aſcention and alſo the aſcentionall
difference by the former Propoſitions,
conſider whether the declination of the ſunne or of
any other point of the Ecliptique be North or
South, for if it be North, then ſubtract the aſcentionall
difference out of the right aſcention, and
the remainder ſhall be the oblique aſcention. But if the declination
be South, then adde the aſcentionall difference to the right
aſcention, and the ſumme thereof ſhall be the oblique aſcention.
As in the former example knowing the declination of the ſunne to
be 23. degrees Northwarde, I ſubtract the aſcentionall difference
which was 33. degrees 30. minutes, out of the right aſcention
of the ſunne, which was 94. degrées, and there remaineth
60. degrees 30′· which is the oblique aſcention of the ſunne being
in the fourth degree of Cancer, and his declination being 23. degrees
Northward as is before ſuppoſed.
               
               
                  How to find out the right aſcention of any arke or portion
of the Ecliptique, and therewith to knowe what time it ſpendeth
in riſing in a right Spheare.
The 16. Propoſition.
                  
                     BRing the ende of the giuen arke founde out in the
Zodiaque of the Rete, vnto the left ende of the Equinoctiall
marked with D. and there ſtaying it, lay
the Fiduciall line of the labell vppon the beginning

of the ſaide Arke, and the number of degrées in the innermoſt
limbe of the mater contained betwixt the left end of the Equinoctiall,
and the Fiduciall line of the labell ſhall be the right aſcention
of that Arke, and the houre ſet downe in the outermoſt limbe wherunto
the labell pointeth, ſhall be the time which the ſaid arke ſpendeth
in his riſing, ſo ſhall you finde the arke of the whole ſigne
Taurus to be 30. degrées, and to ſpend in his riſing two houres.
               
               
                  How to finde out the oblique aſcention of any arke of the
Ecliptique in any Latitude, and what time it ſpendeth in his
riſing.
The 17. Propoſition.
                  
                     FInd▪ the oblique aſcention both of the beginning
and ending of the arke by the 15. Propoſition, then
ſubtract the ſaid aſcention of the beginning of the
arke out of the aſcention of the ending of the ſaid
arke, alwayes remembring that if the oblique
aſcention of the beginning be greater then the other,
then to adde to the leſſer 360. and out of that ſumme make
your ſubtraction, for the remainder ſhall be the oblique aſcention
of the whole arke, then count the number of that aſcention in the
innermoſt limbe of the mater beginning at the left end of the Equinoctiall
marked with D▪
                      and ſo procéede vpwarde towardes
your right hand, and where the ſaid aſcention endeth, there laye
the labell, & the houre whereunto the labell pointeth ſheweth the
time which the ſaide arke ſpendeth in his riſing in that Latitude.
As for example, I would know the oblique aſcention of the whole
arke of the ſigne of Taurus, and what time that arke ſpendeth in
his riſing: firſt here hauing found the oblique aſcention of the firſt
point of Taurus to be about 13. degrées in the Latitude 52. and
the oblique aſcention of the laſt point of that ſigne to be about 30.
here by taking 13. out of 30. there remaineth 17. degrées, which
is the oblique aſcention of the whole arke of the ſigne Taurus,
which 17. degrées, I count in the limbe of the mater from the end
of the Equinoctiall marked with D. vpward, and there laying the
labell, I finde that it pointeth to one houre and two degrées,
which maketh 8′· ſo as I conclude thereby that the whole arke

of the ſigne Taurus, ſpendeth in his oblique aſcention one houre
and eight minutes.
               
               
                  How to finde out the oblique deſcention of any point of
the Ecliptique in any Latitude.
The 18. Propoſition.
                  
                     HAuing found out the oblique aſcention of the poynt
oppoſite to the point giuen, adde thereunto 180. degrées,
and the ſumme thereof ſhall be the oblique deſcention
of the point giuen, alwayes remembring if
the ſumme of addition doe excéede 360 to ſubtract
out of that ſumme 360. and the remainder ſhall be the deſcention
of the point giuen. As for example, you would knowe the oblique
deſcention of the firſt point of Taurus, whoſe point oppoſite
is the firſt point of Scorpio, and his oblique aſcention according
to Reynholdus his Tables is 222. degrées 36. minutes,
whereunto if you adde 130. you ſhall make the totall ſumme to
be 402. degrées 36. minutes, from which ſumme if you ſubtract
360. degrées according to the rule before giuen, there will remaine
42. degrée 36. minutes, which is the oblique deſcention
of the firſt point of Taurus.
                  
               
               
                  How to finde out the oblique deſcention of any arke giuen
of the Ecliptique, and therewith to knowe the time which it
ſpendeth in his ſetting.
The 19. Propoſition.
                  
                     HAuing found the oblique deſcention of the beginning,
and alſo of the ending of the giuen arke by the laſt
Propoſition ſubtract the deſcention of the beginning
out of the deſcention of the ending, and the remainder
ſhall be the oblique deſcention of the giuen arke, alwayes remembring
if the ſubtraction can not be made to adde thereunto
360. that done, deuide that by 15. and the quotient will ſhewe the
number of houres which the giuen arke ſpendeth in his ſetting:
and remember that if in making that diuiſion there be any remainder

left, to multiply that remainder by foure and ſo you ſhall
haue the minutes. By working thus you ſhall finde the oblique
deſcention of the whole Arke of Gemini to be 36. degrées 49. minutes,
and in the Latitude 52. to ſpende in his going downe two
houres and 24. minutes.
               
               
                  How to know the height of any ſtarre at any houre, without
ſeeing the ſtarre, and thereby to find out in the firmament all
the ſtarres that be deſcribed in the net, and are to bee ſeene
with the eye.
The 20. Propoſition.
                  
                     LAy the labell to the houre ſuppoſed vpon the limbe
of the mater, and then bring the place of the ſunne
for that day to the Fiduciall line of the labell, and
there hauing ſtayed the Rete, bring the Fiduciall
line of the labell to the tippe of the ſtarre whoſe altitude
you ſéeke, and the labell will ſhew you vpon the limbe of the
Mater how many degrées that ſtarre is diſtant from the South.
Againe by counting vpon the label, the degrées contained betwixt
the point of the labell, and the tippe of the ſaid ſtar you ſhall haue
his declination, which is North or South according as the ſtarre
is Northerne or Southerne. Then bearing in mind, aſwell the
ſtars diſtance from the South, as alſo his declination, work thus,
Bring the Finitor to your Latitude, and vpon the ſtars Parallell
or Circle of declination in the Mater count from the limbe of the
Mater, the diſtance of the ſtarre before found, and marke what Almicanterath
croſſeth that point, for there is the altitude of the ſtar
at that inſtant, and the Azimuth which cutteth that point, ſheweth
in what part or coaſt of heauen the ſtarre is at that preſent. And
remember to ſéeke the Parallell of the ſtarre on that ſide of the
Mater either on your right or left hand, ſo as it may fall amongſt
the Almicanterathes, for otherwiſe you ſhall not finde that you
ſéeke. As for example the 26. of October 1591. at nine of the clocke
at night, you would know the height of the firſt ſtar of the Rams
horne called Cornu Arietis the Sunne being then in the 12. degrées
and 12. minutes of Scorpio. Here after that you haue laid
the labell to the houre ſuppoſed, and brought the degrée of the

Sunne for that day to the Fiduciall line of the labell, and ſtayed
the Rete there, bring the labell to the tippe of the ſtarre in
the Rete, and the labell will ſhewe in the limbe of the Mater how
many degrées the ſtarre is diſtant from the South, which you
ſhall finde to be 28. degrées and 30. minutes, and the declination
of the ſayde ſtarre being counted vpon the ſaide labell, to be 18.
degrées, then kéeping thoſe two numbers in minde, bring the
Finitor to your Latitude ſuppoſing the ſame to be 52. degrées,
and there ſtaying the Rete, ſéeke for the Parallell of the ſtarre
which is 18. degrées on your right hande, and vppon that Parallel
count by the Meridians from the limbe inwarde, the ſtars
diſtance from the South, which was 28. degrées 30. minutes,
and you ſhall finde that the 49. Almicanterath cutteth that point,
ſo as you may conclude that the altitude of the ſtarre called Cornu
Arietis, was at that houre 49. degrées, and that the 47. Azimuth
doth alſo paſſe through that point which ſheweth that the
ſtarre is 47. degrées from the Eaſt towardes the South, which
according to the Mariners account is Southeaſt, and ſomewhat
more to the Southward. Now to finde out the ſaide ſtarre in the
firmament, if it be a ſtarre light, you haue no more to doe but
to lay the Diopter of your Aſtrolabe at that altitude, and to turn
your face towardes that coaſt (that is to ſay) Southeaſt and
ſomewhat more to the Southwarde, and the next bright ſtarre
which anſwereth in that coaſt to that altitude is the ſtarre which
you ſeeke.
               
               
                  How to finde out the aſcentionall difference
of any ſtarre.
The 21. Propoſition.
                  
                     BRing the Finitor to your Latitude, and ſtaying
it there, looke in what point the Parallell of
the ſtarres declination cutteth the Finitor, and
the number of the Meridians contained betwixt
that point and the Centre, is the aſcentionall
difference, ſo ſhall you find the aſcentional difference
of the Buls eye called Oculus Tauri,
whoſe declination is 15. degrees 48′· to be 21. degrees.
               
               
                  
                  How to know the oblique aſcention of any ſtarre.
The 22. Propoſition.
                  
                     YF the declination of the ſtarre be Northern, ſubtract
the aſcentionall difference out of the right
aſcention, and the remainder ſhall be the oblique
aſcention of the ſtarre, but if his declination be
Southerne you muſt adde the aſcentionall difference
to the right aſcention, and that ſhal be the
oblique aſcention of the ſtarre. As for example, becauſe Oculus
Tauri is a North ſtarre, ſubtract his aſcentional difference which
is 21. degrées, out of his right aſcention which as the foreſaide
Table ſheweth is 62. degrées 30′· and there will remaine 41. degrées
30′· which is the oblique aſcention of the ſayd ſtarre. But
if it were a South ſtarre as Spica Virginis, whoſe declination is
almoſt 9. degrées Southwarde, and her aſcentionall difference is
11. degrées 30′· then you muſt adde the aſcentionall difference to
her right aſcention, which is 195. degrées 51′· ſo ſhall you finde
her oblique aſcention to be 207. degrées 21′·
               
               
                  How to knowe what ſtarres doe neuer riſe nor ſet in anie
Latitude.
The 23. Propoſition.
                  
                     YF the ſtarre be a North ſtarre hauing a greater
declination be it neuer ſo little, then is the
altitude of the Equinoctiall anſwerable to your
latitude: As for example, ſuppoſe your latitude
to be 52. which if you take out of 90. then the
remainder is 38. degrées, which is the altitude
of the Equinoctiall anſwerable to that Latitude, otherwiſe called
the complement, then that ſtarre neuer ſetteth in that Latitude:
Againe if it be a South ſtarre hauing greater declination neuer
ſo little then the complement of your Latitude, then that ſtar neuer
riſeth aboue your Horizon. As for example, in the latitude 52.
the ſtarre called Hircus, that is the Goate, being a North ſtarre
neuer ſetteth in that latitude becauſe his North declination is 45.

degrées, which is greater then the complement of your Latitude
by 7. degr. Alſo the ſtar called Lyra, whoſe declination is 38. degr.
like vnto the complement of your Latitude doth neuer ſet, but only
toucheth your Horizon aſwell at his riſing as ſetting, ſo contrariwiſe
the ſtar called Canopus, being a South ſtar hauing 51.
degr. 38′· of South declination, neuer riſeth aboue your Horizon
in the foreſaid latitude 52. And by this rule you may iudge in like
maner of all the reſt of the fixed ſtarres both North and South.
               
               
                  How to know at what houre of the day or night any ſtarre
riſeth or ſetteth.
The 24. Propoſition.
                  
                     FIrſt marke by the outwarde or inward ſhooting of the
longeſt tippe of the ſtarre, whether it bee North or
South: for if it be North, then count amongeſt the
Meridians in the Mater ſo many Meridians as your
Latitude amounteth to, beginning at the Axletrée,
and ſo procéeding towardes the Northeaſt, which is betwixt the
North pole and the Equinoctiall on your left hande, but if the
ſtarre be South, then count your Latitude procéeding from the
ſaide Axletrée towards the Southeaſt, which is betwixt the ringle
and the North pole on the right hande, and bring the tippe of the
ſtarre to that Meridian which now ſignifieth your Horizon, and
there ſtaying the Rete, bring the labell to the place or degrée of
the ſunne in the Zodiaque of the Rete, in which the ſunne is that
day you ſéeke, and the houre in the limbe whereto the labell pointeth,
is the houre at which the ſtarre riſeth that day or night.
Now to knowe when the ſame ſtarre ſetteth, you haue no more
to doe but to worke with the ſtarre in the Northweſt part in ſuch
order as you obſerued before in the Northeaſt part of the Aſtrolabe.
As for example, I would knowe at what houre the Buls
eye called Oculus Tauri, doeth riſe the laſt day of Iune the
Sunne being then in the 17. degrée and 40. minutes of Cancer.
Here becauſe this ſtarre is a North ſtarre, I bring the longeſt
tippe thereof to the 52. Meridian which is our Latitude counting
from the Axletrée towardes the Northeaſt part of the Aſtrolabe

which is on my left hand, for that Meridian is alwayes the Horizon
ſeruing the Latitude 52. and there ſtaying the Rete, I bring
the Fiduciall line of the labell to the place of the ſunne which at
that day is the 17. degrée 40′· of Cancer as I ſaid before, and I
find that the label pointeth to one of the clocke 30′· after midnight:
wherefore I conclude that Oculus Tauri riſeth that day at that
preſent houre. Now to knowe at what houre that ſtarre goeth
downe the ſame day, I bring his longeſt tippe to the ſaid Horizon
towards the Northweſt, and ſtaying the Rete there, I lay the
labell to the 17. degrée 40′· of Cancer as before, ſo that the labell
pointeth to foure houres and 20. minutes in the afternoone, at
which time he goeth downe, ſo as he continueth at that time aboue
the Horizon in the Latitude 52. 14. houres 48. minutes.
And to knowe the abode of any ſtarre aboue the Horizon, the next
Propoſition doth alſo ſhew.
               
               
                  How to knowe how long any ſtarre continueth aboue the
Horizon in euery Latitude.
The 25. Propoſition.
                  
                     BRing the Finitor to your Latitude, and looke in what
point the Parallel or declination of the ſtarre cutteth
the Finitor, and the number of the Meridians in the
Mater contained betwixt the limbe▪ and that point do
ſhew the halfe time of his abode aboue the Horizon,
which being doubled is the whole time of his abode aboue the Horizon.
And in numbring the ſaid Meridians whereof 15. do make
an houre, remember to beginne to count from the right ſide of the
Mater, procéeding towardes your left hand, and remember alſo
that the middle Meridian or Axletrée, ſignifieth alwayes the ſixth
houre, ſo ſhall you not erre in your account. As for example, hauing
brought the Finitor to the Latitude 52. looke in what point
the Parallel of the foreſaid ſtarre Oculus Tauri cutteth the Finitor,
& by numbring the Meridians procéeding from the limbe on
your right hand towardes the left, you ſhall finde the Parallell of
Oculus Tauri, being 15. degrées 49′· to cut the eleuenth Meridian,
which being doubled and then the ſumme thereof deuided by
15. maketh 14. houres and 48′· as before.
               
               
                  
                  How to finde out the ſtarres houre, and thereby to knowe
the houre of the night.
The 26. Propoſition.
                  
                     FIrſt hauing taken the ſtarres altitude, ſet the Finitor
to your Latitude, and looke at what houreline
in the Mater that ſtarres Almicanterath and
the Parallell of his declination do méete, & hauing
ſought out the ſame houre in the limbe right againſt
that point, bring the labell thereunto, for
that is the ſtarres houre, and there ſtaying with your fingers end
the very point of the labell, bring the longeſt tippe of the ſtarre to
the Fiduciall line of the labell, and ſtaying there the Rete, turne
the labell to the degrée of the Zodiaque of the ſaid Rete, wherein
the ſunne is that day, and the labell will point to the true houre of
the night ſet downe in the outwarde limbe of the Mater. As for
example, I ſuppoſe that the ſeuenth of October 1591. the ſunne
being then in the 23. degrée 15′· of Libra, I tooke the altitude of
the ſtarre Hircus, that is the Goate, which I found to be 20. degrées,
here hauing ſet the Finitor to my Latitude 52. I looke in
the Mater at what houre line that Almicanterath, and the Parallell
of the ſame ſtarre which is 45. degrées Northwarde doe
méete or croſſe one an other, and I find that they méete iuſt vpon
the fourth houre line of the forenoone, wherefore I ſéeke right againſt
that point the ſame houre in the outermoſt limbe of the
Mater, for that is the ſtarres houre, and hauing placed the labell
at that houre, I ſtay it there with my finger vntill I haue brought
the longeſt tippe of the ſtarre Hircus vnto the Fiduciall line of
the labell, and there ſtaying the Rete, I turne the labell to the degrée
of the ſunne which is 23. degrées 15. minutes of Libra, and
I ſée that the labell pointeth to the ſeuenth houre of the night ſet
downe in the limbe of the Mater and halfe an houre paſt. Maiſter
Blagraue ſayth that the ſooner you take the altitude of the ſtarre
whereby you ſéeke to knowe the houre of the night, you ſhall haue
the houre more truely.
               
               
                  
                  How to finde out the diſtance betwixt any two ſtarres
contained in the Net.
The 27. Propoſition.
                  
                     FIrſt conſider whether the declination of both ſtars
be eyther South or North, or that the one bee
South and the other North, for if both their declinations
be South or North, then you muſt not
leaue to turne the Rete to and fro vntill you haue
brought the longeſt tippes of both ſtarres to one
ſelfe Meridian in the Mater, that done count vpon the ſaid Meridian
howe many degrées are contained betwixt the tippes of the
ſaid ſtarres, for that is the diſtance betwixt them. But if the one
ſtarre haue North declination and the other South then turne the
Rete to and fro vntill both ſtarres doe lie vpon two ſuch ſeuerall
Meridians as ech of them is equally diſtant on ech hand from the
Axletrée, then count how many degrées or Meridians are contayned
betwixt the Axletrée and either of thoſe ſtars (which you will)
and that is their diſtance, ſo ſhall you finde the diſtance betwixt
Oculus Tauri and Canis minor being both North ſtars to be 46.
degrées 20′· and the diſtance betwixt Oculus Tauri and Canis
maior, whereof the firſt is a North ſtarre, and the other a South
ſtarre to be iuſt 46. degrées.
               
               
                  Another way to knowe the diſtance of any two ſtars, their
Longitudes and Latitudes being firſt knowne, and alſo by that
meanes to finde out the diſtance betwixt any two places vppon
the earth.
The 28. Propoſition.
                  
                     FIrſt ſéeke to knowe the difference of their Longitudes
by ſubtracting the leſſer Longitude out of
the greater, then count that difference from the
outermoſt Meridian of the Mater towardes the
Center, and marke well that Meridian at which
your account endeth, then number vpon the limbe
of the Mater from the Equinoctiall the greater Latitude either

Northward or Southward according as the Latitude is, and to
that point bring the Zenith of the Rete, then vpon the ſelfe ſame
Meridian before marked count from the Equinoctiall the leſſer
Latitude, and looke what Azimuth paſſeth through that point, for
the degrées which are contayned betwixt that point and the Zenith
ſhalbe the diſtance: and thus doing you ſhal find the diſtance
betwixt Oculus Tauri & Canis maior to be 46. degrées and 15′·
and the diſtance betwixt London and Venice to be 12. degrées
and 20′· which 12. degrées being multiplyed by 60. maketh 720.
miles, whereto if you adde for the 20′· 20. miles, it will make in all
740. miles.
               
               
                  How to find out the degree of Medium coeli at any houre,
of the day (that is to ſay) the degree of the Zodiaque that is
in the Meridian at any houre that you ſeeke, and alſo the degree
called Imum caeli.
The 29. Propoſition.
                  
                     FIrſt ſéeke out the place of the ſunne for that day in the
Zodiaque of the Rete, and hauing laid the labell to
the houre ſuppoſed vpon the limb of the Mater, bring
the place of the ſunne to the Fiduciall line of the label,
and there ſtaying the Rete, looke what degrée of the
ſaid Zodiaque cutteth the noone line or Meridian at noonetide,
which you ſhall eaſily find by laying the labell to the houre of 12.
at noone, for the Fiduciall line of the label croſſing the Zodiaque,
will ſhew the degrée of mid heauen at that houre. As for example,
the 26. of Iune 1592. I would know the degrée of Medium coeli,
at eight of the clocke in the morning, the ſunne being that day in
the 14. of Cancer. Here by laying the labell to the ſaid houre in the
limbe of the Mater, I bring the place of the ſunne to the Fiducial
line of the labell, and there hauing ſtayde the Rete, I bring the labell
to the twelfth houre at noone, and I find that the labell cutteth
the Zodiaque of the Rete in the 18. of Taurus, which at that
houre is the degrée of Medium coeli, whoſe point oppoſite is the
18. degrée of Scorpio, and that is at that houre Imum coeli▪
                      which
the labell being laid to the 12. houre of midnight will ſhew.
               
               
                  
                  How to finde out the Horoſcope or aſcendent at any time
of the day or night, and thereby to haue the foure principall
angles of heauen.
The 30. Propoſition.
                  
                     HAuing laid the labell to the houre giuen vppon the
limbe of the Mater, ſtay it there with your finger
vntill you haue brought the place of the ſunne for
that day vnto the Fiduciall line of the labell, and
there ſtaying the Rete, looke what degrée of the Zodiaque
therof toucheth or croſſeth the Horizon anſwerable to your
Latitude, for that is the aſcendent at that preſent houre. As for
example, I would knowe the aſcendent at eight of the clocke at
night the twelfth of October 1580. the ſunne being then in the 28.
degrée 14′· of Libra. Here hauing layde the labell vpon the ſayd
houre, I bring the 23. degrée 10′· of Libra to the Fiduciall line
of the labell, and there ſtaying the Rete, I find by helpe of the labell
that my Horizon which is the 51. 40′· Meridian, counting on
both hands from the Axletrée, that the firſt degrée of Cancer, doth
croſſe my Horizon in the Northeaſt quarter, wherefore I affirme
that to be the aſcendent or firſt houſe, whoſe point oppoſite being
the firſt of Capricorne, is the deſcendent or ſeuenth houſe, then by
bringing the Fiduciall line of the labell to the South end of the
Equinoctiall at which the ringle hangeth, I finde by helpe of the
labell that the 24. degrée 40′· of Aquarius cutteth the Equinoctiall,
which is the tenth houſe or Culmen coeli, whoſe point oppoſite
being the 24. degrée 40′· of Leo, is the fourth houſe, otherwiſe
called Imum coeli, and thus you haue all the foure principall
houſes of heauen for that houre, as you may ſée in this figure
here following.
                  
                     
                     
                        A figure of the 4. Angles
of heauen, made the 12.
of October 1580. the
ſunne being then in the
28. degree 10′· of Libra,
for the latitude 51. 40′·
                     
                  
                  But the difficultie of finding out the true aſcendent conſiſteth
in knowing whether it is to be ſought in the Northeaſt quarter, or
in the Southeaſt quarter of the Iewell. The Northeaſt quarter
is that which lyeth betwixt Imum coeli, and the North pole or
Eaſt end of the Axletrée, becauſe in this caſe the Axletrée ſignifieth
the line of Eaſt and Weſt, and the Equinoctiall ſignifieth the line
of South and North, at the South end whereof is faſtened the
ringle or handle. But in the former example you may plainely
ſée that the North part of the Zodiaque of the Rete doth cut the
Horizon, as well in the Northeaſt quarter as in the Southeaſt
quarter with two ſeueral degrées and ſignes, for in the Northeaſt
quarter the Zodiaque cutteth the Horizon with the firſt of Cancer
which is the aſcendent, and in the Southeaſt quarter it cutteth the
Horizon with the eight of Taurus, which is not the aſcendent: for
you haue to vnderſtand that euery degrée of the Zodiaque doth
both riſe and ſet either towards the North or towards the South,
the firſt point of Aries and of Libra onely excepted, both which
do riſe right Eaſt, and goe downe right Weſt, euen as the Equinoctiall

doth, whereof M. Blagraue doth gather a rule how to find
out by his Iewell when the aſcendent is to be ſought either in the
northeaſt quarter of the Mater, or in the ſoutheaſt quarter, which
is thus: The aſcention of any of the ſixe Northerne ſignes is to
be ſought for in the Northeaſt part of the Iewell, & the aſcention
of any of the ſixe Southerne ſignes is to be ſought for in the ſoutheaſt
part of the Iewell. For although that the North part of the
Zodiaque of the Rete containing the 6. Northerne ſignes cutteth
the Horizon anſwerable to your Latitude, aſwel in the Northeaſt
as in the Southeaſt part of the Iewell, yet you muſt ſéeke the aſcendent
in the Northeaſt part, and not in the Southeaſt part of
the Iewell, becauſe that euery degrée of any of the 6. Northerne
ſignes riſeth Northernly: ſo contrariwiſe if the South part of the
Zodiaque containing the ſixe Southerne ſignes doe cut the Horizon,
aſwell in the Northeaſt part as in the Southeaſt part of the
Iewel, yet you muſt ſéeke the aſcendent in the Southeaſt part, and
not in the Northeaſt part of the Iewell. As for example, the ſecond
day of Auguſt 1592. the ſun being in the 20. of Leo, I would
know the aſcendent at foure of the clocke in the afternoone: here
hauing laid the labell to that houre, & brought the place of the ſun
to the Fiduciall line thereof, I find that the 13. degrée 30′· of Aquarius
doth cut the Horizon ſeruing to your latitude 52. in the
Northeaſt part of the Iewell, and that the 19. of Sagittarius cutteth
the ſaid Horizon in the Southeaſt part of the Iewell, which
muſt be the aſcendent, becauſe that euery degrée of any of the ſoutherne
ſignes riſeth Southernly, and not Northernly.
               
               
                  How to find the Circles of poſition, and to know how much
the pole is eleuated aboue euery ſuch Circle in any Latitude,
without the knowledge whereof you can not finde out the
twelue houſes by this Aſtrolabe.
The 31. Propoſition.
                  
                     FIrſt bring the Zenith of the Rete to your Latitude,
ſo ſhall the Azimuthes become circles of poſition, then
vpon the Parallel of declination of the point giuen,
according as the declination thereof is north or ſouth:
count from the limbe on your right hand, the number of ye houres

giuen amongſt the Meridians in the Mater, & the Azimuth which
the Meridian of that houre cutteth ſhalbe the Circle of poſition,
which had, you ſhall find the eleuation of the pole aboue the Circle
of poſition thus: Count your Latitude amongſt the Almicanteraths
from the Zenith vpon the Circle of poſition found, & to
that point whereas your Latitude endeth, bring the Fiducial line
of the label, & reckon vpō the label how many degrées are cōtained
betwixt the limbe of the Rete & that point, for the number of thoſe
degrées is the eleuation of the Pole aboue the Circle of poſition.
As for example vſed by M. Blagraue himſelfe, the 12. of October
1580. the ſunne being then in the 29. degrée 10′· of Libra, and his
South declination 11. deg. 10′· I would know at 8. of the clock at
night in what Circle of poſition the ſunne at that time was, here
I bring the Zenith to the Latitude of Reading, which is 51. deg.
40′· then for 8. of the clocke I count 8. houres amongſt the Meridians
in the Mater, from the South part of the Iewell vppon the
Parallell of the ſunne being then 11. deg. 30′· and by attributing
to euery houre 15. Meridians, I find that the Meridian whereas
the 8. houre endeth doth croſſe the 28. & ½. Azimuth, counting the
Azimuths from the Zenith line, and that is the Circle of poſition
wherin the ſun was then vnder the earth in the Northeaſt quarter.
Now to knowe how much the Pole is eleuated aboue that circle
of poſition I do count from the Zenith the foreſaid Latitude 51.
degrées, 40′· vpon the ſaid Circle of poſition, and to the point
where that Latitude endeth I bring the labell, & counting thereon
from the limbe of the Rete the degrées contayned betwixt the ſaid
limbe, and the foreſaid point, I find the number of them to be 43.
degrées 30′· wherfore I conclude that the Pole is eleuated aboue
the ſaid Circle of poſition 43. degrées 30′·
               
               
                  How to find out all the 12. houſes of heauen, and thereby to
erect a figure at any houre of the day or night.
The 32. Propoſition.
                  
                     YOu ſhall vnderſtande the order of this better by this
one example giuen by M. Blagraue himſelfe, then by
manifold rules which be alſo ſo plainely expreſſed and
obſerued in this example, as you néede none other inſtruction

to erect the like figure in any Latitude, and at any houre
of the day or night. Suppoſe then that you would erect a figure
for one that was borne the twelfth of October 1580. at eight of
the clocke at night in the Latitude 51. 40′· the ſunne being then in
the 28. degrée 10′· of Libra, and his declination being at that
time 11. degrées 10′· Southward: Here firſt ſet downe in your figure
alreadie drawne the foure Angles before found by the 30.
Propoſition anſwerable to the ſaid day & houre, then to find out
the reſt of the houſes do thus, bring the Zenith of the Rete to the
latitude preſuppoſed, which is 51. degrées 40′· & ſtaying it there,
marke what number of Azimuthes or Circles of poſition doth
cut euery 30. degrée of the Equinoctiall, counting the degrées of
the Equinoctiall by helpe of the Meridians from the limbe towardes
the Centre, but you muſt count the number of the Azimuthes
or Circles of poſition from the Zenith line towardes the
limbe, of which Circles of poſition there be no more but ſixe at the
moſt (that is to ſay) thrée betwixt the limbe and the Centre on the
one ſide, and as many on the other ſide of the Centre, the eleuation
or rather depreſſion of euery one whereof you muſt ſéeke to
knowe by the laſt Propoſition. But M. Blagraue ſayth that you
néede to knowe the eleuation or rather depreſſion, but only of two
Circles of poſition, that is of that which ſheweth the eleuenth and
third houſe, and of that which ſheweth the twelfth & ſecond houſe,
and ſo ſayth Stadius alſo in the beginning of his Ephemerides,
treating of the 12. houſes, for hauing them you haue all the reſt.
The order of working according to M. Blagraue his rule is thus:
hauing brought the Zenith to the foreſaid Latitude, looke what
Circle of poſition cutteth the Equinoctiall in the firſt 30. degrées
next to the limbe, and you ſhall finde that the 47. Azimuth or Circle
of poſition (counting from ye Zenith line) cutteth that point of
the Equinoctiall, and therewith ſerueth to the eleuenth houſe, and
alſo to the third houſe, and the eleuation of this Circle is 32. deg.
then from thence tell vppon the Equinoctiall 30. degrées more,
which do make in all 60. degrées, and through that point you ſhal
finde the 19. Azimuth or Circle of poſition to paſſe, whoſe eleuation
is 47. degrées and this Circle ſerueth to the twelfth houſe &
to the ſecond houſe. Now kéeping well in mind thoſe two laſt eleuations,
that is, 47. and 32. worke thus: Lay your labell to the

eight houre of the morning, which is 30. degrées diſtant from the
right Horizon or Axletrée, and bring to the Fiduciall line thereof
the Culmen coeli or 10. houſe firſt ſet downe in your figure which
is the 24. of Aquarius, and ſtaying it there, looke what degrée of
the Ecliptique cutteth the 32. Horizon which ſerueth to the 11.
houſe counting from the right Horizon towards your left hande.
And by following that Horizon vp towards the North pole, you
ſhall finde that the 25. degrée 30′· of Piſces cutteth the ſame Horizon
very nigh vnto the Pole, but by my inſtrument I finde it to
be the 27. degrée of Piſces, which perhaps is not truely made,
and therefore ſet downe in the eleuenth houſe of your figure 25.
degrées 30′· of Piſces. Then bring the foreſaid Culmen coeli together
with the labell to the tenth houre of the morning, which is
30 degrées further towards the South, and ſtaying it there, looke
what degrée of the Ecliptique cutteth the 47. Horizon, ſeruing to
the twelfth houſe, and you ſhall find that the 20. degrée of Taurus
cutteth that Horizon, wherefore ſet downe the 20. of Taurus in
the twelfth houſe of your figure, then bring the Culmen coeli together
with the labell to the 12. houre at noone, and you ſhall ſée
the aſcendent which is the firſt of Cancer to cut the oblique Horizon,
which is 51. degrées 40′· and from thence bring the label and
culmen coeli to two of the clocke in the after noone, and ſtaying
it there you ſhall ſée the 21. degrée of Cancer to cut the 47. Horizon
which ſheweth the ſecond houſe and alſo the twelfth houſe as
before, wherefore ſet downe 21. of Cancer in the ſecond houſe of
your figure, that done, remooue the labell together with Culmen
coeli to foure of the clocke in the afternoone, and there ſtaying it,
you ſhall ſée the ſeuenth of Leo to cut the 32. Horizon which ſheweth
both the third houſe and the eleuenth houſe as before, wherefore
ſet the ſeuenth of Leo in the third houſe of your figure, ſo haue
you eight of the houſes, that is to ſay, the firſt, the ſecond, the third,
the fourth, the ſeuenth, the tenth called Culmen coeli, the eleuenth
and the twelfth, ſo as there want onely foure, that is, the fifth, the
ſixth, the eight and the ninth houſe. The fifth is oppoſite to the eleuenth,
the ſixth to the twelfth, the eight to the ſecond, and the
ninth to the third, whoſe oppoſite ſignes ech one hauing like number
of degrées are to be placed in the foure houſes of your figure
that be wanting. As in the fifth houſes the 25. degrée 30′· of Virgo,
                     
in the ſixth houſe the 20. degrée of Scorpio in the eight houſe the
21. degrée 30′· of Capricorne, and in the ninth houſe the 7. degrée
10′· of Aquarius, ſo haue you all the twelue houſes. And by this
meanes M. Blagraue ſayth that you may make the places of the
twelue houſes to ſerue for euer in any Latitude, ſo as you doe diſtinguiſh
frō the reſt with ſome colour thoſe two Horizons whereof
the one doth ſhew the eleuenth and the third houſe, and the other
Horizon ſheweth the twelfth and ſecond houſe, yea and by this
meanes you may (as he ſayth) make as true Tables to finde out
the twelue houſes in euery Latitude as thoſe that be calculated
of purpoſe.

                  A nevv and neceſſarie
Treatiſe of Nauigation containing
all the chiefest principles
of that Arte. Lately collected out of the beſt Moderne
writers thereof by M. Blundiuile, and by him
reduced into ſuch a plaine and orderly forme of
teaching as euery man of a meane capacitie
may eaſily vnderſtand the ſame.

                  Of Nauigation, what it is, and with what order the principles
thereof are here taught by Maſter Blundeuill, according
to the rules of the beſt moderne writers of that Arte.
                  
                     
                        NAVIGATION is an Arte which
teacheth by true and infallible rules, howe
to gouerne and direct a ſhip from one Port
to another ſafely, rightly, and in ſhorteſt
time: I ſay here ſafely, ſo farre as it lieth
in mans power to performe. And in ſaying
rightly, I meane not by a right line, but by
the ſhorteſt and moſt commodious waye
that may be found: And by ſaying in ſhorteſt
time, I meane thereby according as the ſhip is good of ſayle,
and according as both winde and tide ſhall ſerue.
                  The meanes to attaine to this Arte as to all other Artes are
two parts, whereof euery Arte conſiſteth, that is Methode and
Practiſe, which is as much to ſay heere as inſtruction and experience:
For of the chéefe points of this Arte, ſome are to be learned
by inſtruction, and ſome onely by experience: for what inſtruction
I pray you wil ſerue to make a good coaſter, that is to ſay, to know
any Cape or Cliffe when he ſéeth it, vnleſſe he hath firſt ſéene it &
hath before taken good markes thereof. Alſo to know the currents
in all places, the deapth and qualities of waters, ſandes, flats, or
ſhoulds, and ſuch like, the perfect knowledge whereof conſiſteth
chiefely in experience. Of which experience I minde not here to
treate, becauſe I knowe that a Dutchman called Wagoner or
Aurigarius hath lately written of theſe things notably wel, & eſpecially
for theſe our ſeas and the Northeaſt ſeas, whoſe booke I
doubt not but that ſome of our learned ſea men will ſet foorth in
our mother tongue, with ſome augmentation of their owne experience
for the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, for the profite of their countrie
and to their owne praiſe & commendation. In the meane time

I will procéede with inſtruction, the chiefe pointes whereof are
theſe here following: firſt to know the vſes of ſuch inſtrumentes
as euery ſkilfull ſea man ought to haue with him that mindeth to
ſayle any long voyage, which are theſe here following: Firſt a
perfect Kalender or Ephemerides, the Mariners ring or Aſtrolabe,
the Croſſe-ſtaffe called of the Spaniardes Balla ſtella, the
two Globes both Celeſtiall and Terreſtriall: Of all which things
I haue in a manner alreadie written ſeuerall Treatiſes. Item
an vniuerſall Horologe, to knowe thereby the houre of the day
in euery Latitude, and a Nocturnlabe to know thereby the houre
of the night. And it were neceſſarie for him that ſayleth long voiages
to carry with him a Topographicall inſtrument to deſcribe
therby thoſe ſtraunge Coaſts & Countries wherby he ſayleth, the
vſe of which inſtrument is plainely taught by William Borne
in his booke called the Treaſure of Trauailers, and by Maiſter
Digges in his booke called the Pantometria, wherefore I ſhall
not néede to ſpeake any further thereof: Alſo the Mariners compaſſe,
whereof I do not only make a plaine deſcription and ſhew
the vſes thereof, but alſo how to finde out the variation of the
ſame, according to the precepts of the beſt moderne writers therof.
And laſtly the Mariners Carde, whereof whileſt I ſpeake,
I doe not onely ſhewe the making thereof, and how to drawe the
Parallels in better ſort then they are vſed to be drawne in the cō
                     mon
Cardes, but I ſet downe therewith the chiefeſt vſes of the
Card, amongſt which is taught how to know by help of the Card
and certaine Tables made of purpoſe, what way your ſhippe hath
made in ſayling by any rombe or wind, yea in ſailing right Eaſt &
Weſt, which heretofore (as Cogniet ſayth) hath béene thought a
thing vnpoſſible to be knowne, but only by coniecture: And being
out of your way how to know in what place you are, & to marke the
ſame in your Card that you may the more readily direct your ſhip
againe to the place whereunto you would go. But all theſe inſtruments
ſerue to little purpoſe, vnleſſe you know alſo the North ſtar
with his guards, & diuerſe other ſtars ſituated aſwel towards the
North as towardes the South pole, together with their Longitudes,
Latitudes, declinations, and greatneſſe, to knowe thereby
the Latitude of any place, & the houre of the night: alſo the courſe
of the ſunne and his declination, by helpe whereof you may know

the Latitude of any place, the times and ſeaſons of the yeare,
the houre of the day, and the length of the day and night in euerie
latitude. And finallie you muſt know the courſe of the Moone,
whereon dependeth the knowledge of the tydes in all places: Of
all which thinges I mind here to treat in ſuch order as the Chapters
hereafter following doe ſhew.

                  A general Kalender or Almanacke for euer.
                  
                     WHat this word Kalends ſignifieth, & from
whence it is deriued is before ſet downe
in the firſte booke of my Treatiſe of the
Spheare the 45. chapter. But becauſe
there be generall rules to knowe the coniunction
of the Moone with the Sunne,
her full, and all her foure quarters, and
alſo the mooueable feaſts and Dominicall
letter, and ſuch like things eaſilie to be learned without the help
of any particular Kalender, I thought good firſt to ſet downe
this general Ralender, contayning 9. propoſitions, as followeth.
               
               
                  How to find out the Golden number euery yeare.
Chapter. 1.
                  
                     THe Golden number is the number of 19. procéeding
from 1. to 19. and ſo to begin again at 1.
And it is ſo called becauſe it was ſent in golden
letters frō 
                     Alexandria in Aegypt to Rome: For
in 19. yeares the Moon doth make all her ſundry
motions & changes, and returneth again to the
place where ſhe firſt began. And to finde the foreſaid number the
way is thus. Adde 1. to the yeare of the Lord wherof you inquire,
and diuide the ſame by 19. and the remainder ſhall be the Golden
number for that yeare, as for example, being deſirous this
preſent yeare 1590. to knowe the Golden number, I adde 1 to
the ſaid yeare, and ſo make it 1591. which being diuided by 19.
there remaineth 14. which is the Golden number of this preſent
yeare.
                  But when there is no remainder, then 19 is the Golden number,
and remember that the Golden number beginneth alwaies
at the firſt of Ianuary, and the Epact the firſt of March.
               
               
                  
                  How to finde out the Epact in everie yeare.
Chapter. 2.
                  
                     THe Epact is a number not excéeding 30. becauſe
the Moone betwixt change and change, neuer paſſeth
30. dayes, and thereby the common Lunar
yeares conſiſting of twelue Moones is leſſer than
the Solar yeare by 11. dayes, for to euerie Moon
are attributed no more but 29. dayes and a halfe, which make
in all 354. dayes, ſo as the common Solar yeare conſiſting of
365. dayes excéedeth the Lunar yeare 11. dayes, from whence
the Epact taketh his originall, which Epact is found thus. Multiply
the golden number of the yeare by 11. the product whereof
if it be vnder 30. then it is the Epact. But if the product be aboue
30. then diuide the product by 30. and the remainder ſhall be the
Epact. As for example, to know the Epact in the yeare 1590.
the golden number béeing 14. as before: here hauing multiplyed
the ſame by 11. and diuided the product thereof by 30. I find the
remainder to be 4. which is the Epact of the ſaid yeare. Alſo by
knowing one former Epact you ſhal haue it euer after, by adding
thereunto 11. and if the number doe excéede 30. then you muſt
diuide the ſame by 30. and the remainder ſhall be the Epact, as by
adding 11. to 4. I know the Epact ſhall be the next yeare, which
is 1591. the number of 15. and by adding 11. to 15. the Epact in
the yeare of our Lord 1592. ſhall be 26. and ſo forth.
               
               
                  How to knowe the Epact by the Mariners rule vpon your
thumbe.
Chapter. 3.
                  
                     FIrſt, you muſt ſuppoſe the inſide of your left
thumbe to be diuided into thrée ſpaces, and the
nethermoſt ſpace to containe 10. the middle ſpace
20. and the higheſt ſpace towards your thumbes
end, to containe 30. and knowing firſt the golden
number, begin to tell the ſame at the nether ſpace
ſaying there 1. at the middle ſpace 2. at the thirde ſpace 3. then

beginne againe at the loweſt ſpace, and there ſay 4, and ſo continue
your account ſtill after that manner, vntil you haue the full
ſumme of the Golden number, and marke vpon what ſpace the
full ſumme falleth, for the Golden number being added to the
number of that ſpace, doeth ſhewe the Epact, ſo as the totall
ſumme doth not excéede 30. for then you muſt ſubtract 30. and
the remainder ſhall bée the Epact: as for example, in the yeare
1591. the Golden number is 15. which béeing counted vppon
your thombe in ſuch order as is before taught, it will fall vpon
the higheſt ſpace, which is 30. to which if you adde the Golden
number, which is 15. it will make in all 45. from which ſumme
if you ſubtract 30. there will remaine 15. which ſhall bee the Epact
for that yeare, ſo as the Epact and Golden number in that
yeare are like numbers. For euery thrée yeares they are alwayes
like, as when the Golden number is either 3. 6. 9. 12. 15. or 18.
the Epact hath alſo like number.
               
               
                  Howe to knowe the age of the Moone in everie moneth
throughout the yeare.
Chapter. 4.
                  
                     ADde to the Epact the number of monethes
from the beginning of March, together with
the moneth wherein you ſéeke, and alſo the
number of the dayes paſt of that moneth,
wherein you ſéeke, and the ſumme of ſuch
addition will ſhewe you the age of the Moone,
as for example, I would know the age of the
Moone the ſixt day of December in the yeare
1590. Here knowing the Epact of that yeare to bee 4. I adde
thereunto the number of the moneths from the beginning of
March, which are 10. moneths, and alſo the number of daies
of December, which are ſixe, and the ſumme thereof is the age
of the Moone, if the ſum bee leſſe than 30. But if the ſumme of
ſuch addition do excéede 30. then you muſt ſubtract 30. and the
remainder ſhall bée the age of the Moone, ſo as the moneth wherein
you ſéeke haue 31. dayes, for if it hath leſſe than 31. dayes,

then you muſt ſubtract but 29. and the remainder ſhall bee the
age of the Moone, as for example, ſuppoſe you ſéeke the age of
the Moone the 22. of Nouember in the yeare 1589. in which
yeare the Epact was 23. here by adding to the Epact firſt 9.
Moneths, and then twentie two dayes, it maketh in all 54. out
of which by ſubtracting 29. becauſe Nouember hath but 30. daies,
the remainder is 25. which was the age of the Moone in that moneth,
day, and yeare.
               
               
                  How to know the change, the full, and foure quarters of the
Moone euerie moneth throughout the yeare.
Chapter. 5.
                  
                     
                        MArtin Cortes in his booke called the Art of Nauigation
teacheth a rule to find the day of the change,
in euerie moneth by knowing the age of the moone
that day you ſéeke, and then by reckoning from
that day backward the number of the dayes that
went next before, or els by taking the age of the Moone out of
the dayes of the moneth that went next before, as for example,
the laſt of October 1592. I finde by the fourth propoſition the
age of the Moone to be 5. which being taken out of 31. (for ſo many
daies October hath) there remaineth 26, which day by this
meanes ſhould be the day of the change, but the very day indéed
was the 25. of the ſaid moneth, for the former rule to know the
age of the Moone is not ſo true it ſelfe, but that ſometime it will
fall a day either ouer or vnder. But Gemma Friſius teacheth to
find out the day of the change in euery moneth thus. Adde to the
Epact the number of the moneths from the beginning of March
whereof that Moneth wherein you ſéeke the change, muſt be counted
as one, and then ſubtract the product or ſum of that addition
from 30. and the remainder will ſhew the day of the change,
which rule I finde to be true ſo long as the ſumme of the addition
doth not excéed 30. but when the ſum of the addition is more
than 30. which will commonlie chance when the Epact is a
great number, as 26. or 29. he teacheth no rule for that, wherefore
I thinke it beſt to take ſuch ſumme out of 59. and the remainder
ſhall be the day of change, or at the moſt but one day

ouer or vnder, and hauing the day of the change, you ſhall haue
the day of the full by adding 15. dayes more to the day of change:
And hauing the change and the full, you ſhall eaſily haue all her
foure quarters by adding or ſubtracting 7. dayes.
               
               
                  Howe to know in what ſigne and degree the Moone is euerie
day throughout the yeare.
Chapter. 6.
                  
                     SOme doe ſet downe rules to know in what
ſigne and degrée the Moone is euerie day, but
ſuch as are not true. And to ſay the truth the
Moone hath ſo many diuers motions as it
cannot be done but by ſpeciall Tables calculated
of purpoſe. And by what rule ſoeuer
you work, you muſt firſt know the place of the
Sunne, which the Ephemerides moſt trulie
ſheweth, and in looking for that, you ſhall alſo find hard by it the
place of the Moone, that is to ſay, in what ſigne and degrée ſhée
is euery day, and ſo orderly the place of any other Planet, and
therefore I leaue to ſpeake any further thereof.
               
               
                  How to find out the moouable Feaſtes euerie yeare, onely
by knowing the day of coniunction in the moneth of Februarie.
Chapter. 7.
                  
                     THe way to finde out the Coniunction in euerie
moneth is before taught in the fift propoſition.
And hauing the day of the coniunction in Februarie,
you may aſſure your ſelfe that the next tueſday
following is alwayes Shrouetueſday, for
though the coniunction it ſelfe doe fall vppon a
Tueſday, yet the next Tueſday after that, ſhall bee Shrouetueſday,
and the next Sunday after that, is called Quadrageſima,
which is the firſt Sunday in Lent, and ſixe weekes next af-that
is Eaſter day, whereunto if you adde fiue wéekes more, that
is to ſay, 35. dayes, you ſhall haue Rogation Sunday, and 4.

dayes next after that is Aſcention day, and tenne dayes next
after Aſcention day is Pentecoſte or Whitſunday, and ſeuen
dayes next after that is Trinitie Sunday, and foure dayes
next after that is the Feaſtiuall day called Corpus Chriſti. And
you haue to note that the Sunday called Adventus Domini,
which wee call the firſt Sunday in Aduent, is alwayes the
fourth Sunday before Chriſtmaſſe day, and the Sunday called
Septuageſima is the third Sunday before Quadrageſima, otherwiſe
called the firſt Sunday in Lent, and betwixt Septuageſima
and Quadrageſima there are other two Sundayes, whereof
that which is next before Quadrageſima is called Quinquageſima,
and the next Sunday before that is called Sexageſima.
                  
               
               
                  How to finde out the circle of the Sunne, called in Latine
by a Greekiſh name Cyclus Solaris, and thereby the Dominicall
Letter in euery yeare.
Chapter. 8.
                  
                     THis Circle was inuented more to finde
thereby the Dominicall Letter than to ſhew
any greate chaunges of the Sunnes motions
therein: And becauſe there bee ſeuen
dayes in the weeke, commonlie ſignified
by ſeuen letters, A. B. C. D. E. F.
G. This Circle therefore is made to containe
twentie eight yeares, for foure times
ſeuen doe make twentie eight, by helpe whereof is knowne the
true order of the letters, whereof A. ſignifieth alwayes the firſt
day of euerie yeare, and for euery leape yeare are appointed two
Dominicall letters, whereof the one continueth from the beginning
of that yeare vntill Saint Mathias euen, and the other
from thence to that yeares ende, as you ſhall more plainlie
perceiue by that which followeth. And firſt I will ſhew you
how to finde out the iuſt number of the circle of the Sunne euery
yeare, which is done thus.
                  Adde to the yeare of the Lord giuen or ſuppoſed 9. and diuide
that product by 28. and the remainder ſhall bée the number of

the foreſaide Circle: As for example, I would know the number
of the ſaide Circle in the yeare 1590. whereunto by adding
9. I make the ſumme to bee 1599. which béeing diuided
by 28. there remayneth 3. Nowe to finde out the Dominicall
letter by the number of the ſayd Circle, you muſt reſorte
to the figure following, conſiſting of thrée Circles, making
two ſpaces, in the vpper ſpace whereof are ſet downe the aforeſaide
ſeuen letters, and in the nether ſpace the numbers of the
Sunnes Circle, in ſuch ſorte as euerie number hath his proper
Dominicall letter ſtanding right ouer his heade, and for euerie
leape yeare there are ſet down two Dominicall Letters. Al which
letters are to be counted backward, & not forward as they are placed
in the Almanacks. As for example, hauing fouud the number
of the Sunnes circle for the yeare 1590. to bée 3. in the lower
ſpace, you ſhall finde the letter D. ſtanding ouer his head, which
is the Dominicall letter for that yeare. And note that when 28.
is the number of the Sunnes circle A. is alwayes the Dominicall
Letter, from which number you muſt beginne to count againe
at 1. and ſo procéed backward to 28.
                  
               
               
                  
                  How to find out the number of Indiction.
Chapter. 9.
                  
                     THis number conſiſteth of 15. yeares, and is commenly
ſet down in al the Charters of the Biſhops
of Rome, and in the inſtruments and writings of
their pronotaries, and therefore is called Indictio
Romana, wherein they ſéeme to followe the
auncient Romanes, which vſed the like indiction
of yeares, but to other purpoſes, whereof I make mention in my
Spheare: The way to find out this number euerie yeare is thus.
Adde to the yeare of the Lorde giuen 3. and deuide the product
thereof by 15. and the remainder ſhall be the number of the ſaid
indiction. But you haue to vnderſtand that this Indiction is to
be counted from September, and not from March as is the Epact.
                  But the ſureſt, and therewith the moſt generall Kalender to
ſerue in al places is the Ephemerides or dayly Almanack and eſpecially
that of Iohannes Stadius, which wil ſerue for 14. years
yet to come: And before thoſe yeares be all expired, I doubt not
but that the like will be ſet forth by ſome one or other of our learned
Aſtronomers, amongſt whome for many years paſt the Germanes
haue bene moſt famous. I choſe the Ephemerides of Stadius
becauſe he is more portable, and of leſſe price than that great
Ephemerides of Leovitius. The chiefeſt vſes whereof, and moſt
méete for Mariners, though I haue already ſet downe in the latter
end of my Treatiſe of the Globes, to the intent you might by
the helpe thereof find out in the Globe the true place of the Moone
and of euery one of the other 5. Planets that hath both longitude
and latitude, yet I thinke it good once againe here in this place,
moſt properlie requiring the ſame, briefly to ſhewe the vſe of the
ſaide Ephemerides, and ſpeciallie of the diurnall, Table which
beginneth at the yeare of our Lord 1583. endeth with the yeare
1606.
               
               
                  
                  A briefe deſcription together with the vſe of the diurnall
Table or Almanacke of Iohannes Stadius.
Chapter. 10.
                  
                     THis Table beginneth at the 202. page of his
booke called the Ephemerides or dayly Almanacke.
And euerie page of the ſaid Table that is
on the left hand is diuided into 9. collums. In the
firſt collum whereof on the left hand are ſet down
the daies of the moneth. Firſt, the Gregorian
dayes according to the Romane account, and next to that the
dayes of the moneth according to our Engliſh account, and then
in the front of euerie other collum are ſet downe the characters,
firſt of the Sunne, and then of the other ſixe Planets, that is to
ſay, of the Moone, Saturne, Iupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercurie, and
laſt of all, the head of the Dragon figured thus ♌. And right vnder
theſe ſeuen Planets, and alſo vnder the heade of the Dragon
are ſet downe the ſignes and degrées whererein euerie of theſe is
euery day of the moneth throughout the yeare at noonetyde. And
in the foote of the ſaide Table is ſet downe the latitude of euery
one of the fiue planets, procéeding by the dayes of the moneth diuided
into thrée parts. And in the margent of euerie left page are
ſet downe the chiefeſt feaſts and Saints dayes that fall in euery
moneth throughout the yeare.
                  And moreouer, in the Table on the right hande right againſt
the left Table are ſet downe firſt the dayes of the moneth,
and then what coniunction or any other aſpect the Moone hath
with anie of the other ſixe Planets, that is, with the Sunne, with
Saturne, with Iupiter, with Mars, with Venus, and with Mercurie,
which Planets are ſet downe in the front of the ſaid Table,
and vnder them the Characters of ſuch aſpectes as the Moone
hath that day with any of the other Planets. The characters of
which aſpects are theſe here following.
                  ☌ ☍ △ 
                     □ ⚹
                  Whereof the firſt ſignifieth a Coniunction, the ſecond an oppoſition,
the third a trine aſpect, the fourth a quadrat aſpect, and
the fift a ſextile aſpect.
                  
                     
Two Planets are ſaide to bee in a coniunction when they are
both in one ſelfe ſigne.
                  And to be in an oppoſition when they are in two ſeueral ſignes
diſtant one from another, that is to ſay, 6 ſignes diſtant one from
another.
                  And to be a trine aſpect when they are diſtant one from another
by foure ſignes:
                  And to be in a quadrat aſpect when they are diſtant one from
another by thrée ſignes.
                  And to be in a ſextile aſpect when they are diſtant but 2 ſignes
one from another.
               
               
                  How to find out the place of any planet by the Ephemerides.
Chapter. 11.
                  
                     NOw to find out the place of any Planet, or of the head
of the Dragon by this diurnall Table, you muſt firſt
ſéeke out the day of the moneth in the firſt Collum
of the left Table, and right againſt that on your right
hand in the ſaid left Table, you ſhall find in the common
angle right vnder the Planet or Dragons head, which ſo euer
of them you ſéeke, the ſigne and degrée wherein the ſaide Planet
or Dragons head is the ſaid day at noontyde.
                  And to find out the aſpectes which the Moone hath with anie
of the Planets the ſame day, you muſt reſort to the other Table
on the right hand, obſeruing like order as before.
                  
                     The Example.
                     As for example, the 21 of Aprill 1592 which is the firſt of
May according to the Romane accompt, I find by the Table on
the left hand, the Sunne to be in the 10. degrée, 15. minutes of
Taurus, the Moone to be in the third degrée 47 minutes of Capricorne,
Saturne to be in the 8. degrée 10 minutes of Cancer, Iupiter
to be in the 18. degrée 28 minutes of Sagittarius, Mars to
be in the 12 deg. 6 minutes of Gemini, Venus to be in the 2 degrée
0 minutes of Aries, and Mercurie to be in the 6. degrée 20
minutes of Taurus, and the head of the Dragon to be in the 29 degrée
45 minutes of Gemini. And right againſt this in the Table
on the right hand, you ſhall find the Moone to bee in a trine aſpect
with the Sun, to be in an oppoſition with Saturne, to be in a trine
aſpect with Mercurie.
                     
                     
                        
Thus much touching general Kalenders or Almanacks. Now
as for particular Kalenders I take that which Robert Norman
hath ſet downe in his new Attractiue to be the fitteſt for our countrie
men, which containeth many neceſſarie things, as the contents
thereof together with the Table next following the ſame
doth ſhew, which Kalender I think it ſuperfluous to be ſet down
againe here, and the rather for that I wiſh euerie Mariner not to
be without that booke, and eſpecially contayning beſides the Kalender
many other good precepts touching nauigation, to which
booke is alſo ioyned a verie learned and Mathematicall diſcourſe
touching the variation of the Mariners Compaſſe made
by Maiſter William Borough controller of her Maieſties Nauie,
who in mine opinion is one of the ſkifulleſt men in the Art
of nauigation that is in this Realme.
                  
               
               
                  Of the Mariners Ring or Aſtrolabe, and of his croſſe ſtaffe.
Chapter. 12
                  
                     NOw according to the order ſet down in the beginning
of this Treatiſe, I muſt néeds ſpeak ſomewhat of the
common Marmers Ring or Aſtrolabe, and of his
croſſe ſtaffe which ſerue not to ſo many purpoſes as
that of Stofflerus or of M. Blagraue before deſcribed, but onlie
to take the altitude of the Sunne, or of any Starre or Planet, neither
are ſo many concluſions to bee wrought by their common
croſſe ſtaffe as by that of Gemma Friſius, or by that which Maſter
Hood hath latelie inuented. Sith our Marmers for the moſt
part doe vſe their common croſſe ſtaffe to none other ende but eyther
to take the altitude of the Sun or of any fixed ſtar or planet,
or els to take the diſtance betwixt two ſtars, the making of which
ſtaffe is plainly ſet downe by Martin Cortes in his arte of Nauigation,
and alſo the making of their Aſtrolabe.
                  But Cogniet and Wagoner do ſet downe a new kind of Croſſe
ſtaffe, hauing 3. tranſoms or croſſes euery one lōger & ſhorter than
another by the one halfe, affirming that ſo many concluſions may
be wrought therby as by that of Gēma Friſius, but in mine opiniō
they are not to be cōpared in al reſpects to that of Gemma Friſius
which though by reaſon that the yard therof is of ſo great a length

as it is not maniable in a ſhippe, yet vpon the land it is moſt ſerviceable,
nor yet to that of Maiſter Hoods inuention, which is
moſt maniable, and therwith verie light of carriage, by whoſe ſtaffe
I thinke verilie that as many things may be wrought as by anie
other kind of croſſe ſtaffe whatſoeuer, and with leſſe trouble, yea,
and in matters of Aſtronomie more trulie by reaſon that the yard
and tranſome be of one ſelfe length, and thereby the degrées bée
larger throughout the whole quadrant than they be in the common
croſſe ſtaues, for in them the degrées from 50. vpwards to 90. are
verie ſmall and haue narrower ſpaces than M. Hoods ſtaffe hath.
Againe, whereas in vſing the Mariners croſſe ſtaffe in ſuch latitude,
as the Sunnes beames be of great force, they are faine to
haue glaſſes made of purpoſe to ſaue their ſight, and in ſome places
all too little. But in vſing M. Hoods ſtaffe they ſhall not néed
to behold the Sunne it ſelfe at all, but onely to marke vpon what
degrée of the yard the ſhadow of the Vane ſtréeketh. Moreouer,
when the Sunne or ſtarre is 50. or 60. degrées high, they are fain
to vſe their Aſtrolabe and not their ſtaffe, which Aſtrolabe in mine
opinion, as I haue ſaid before, is the beſt inſtrument of all others
to take the altitude of the Sunne in the day, or of any ſtarre in the
night, and becauſe I haue here commended vnto you M. Hoods
ſtaffe, I will firſt ſet downe a plaine deſcription thereof together
with thoſe few Aſtronomicall vſes which do chieflie belong to the
Mariner, without committing anie offence I hope to the author
thereof, and then I will deſcribe vnto you the Mariners ring and
his common ſtaffe together with the vſes of the ſame.
                  But as I was about to deſcribe vnto you M. Hoods ſtaffe, a
friende of mine comming in the meane time deſired mée that I
woulde firſt ſet downe the making and vſe of the croſſe ſtaffe with
thrée tranſomes, which Wagoner and Michaell Cogniet doe
ſo much commend, and as I heare, is vſed of manie ſea men
in theſe daies, whoſe requeſt I could not well denie, and therfore
loe here followeth both the making and vſe thereof.
                  
                     
                     Of the croſſe ſtaffe hauing three Tranſames or Curſours,
commonly vſed in theſe dayes, the vſe and making whereof
doth hereafter followe according to the deſcription of Wagoner
and Michaell Cogniet.
                     
                        FIrſt prepare a right ſtaffe of firme woode that is
ſquare euery way, bearing in thicknes thrée quarters
of an inch, and in length thrée or foure foote,
for which you muſt alſo prepare thrée Tranſames
or Curſours euery one ſhorter then another by
the one halfe, for the longeſt would containe in
length twelue inches, the ſeconde ſixe inches, and the ſhorteſt or
leaſt thrée inches. And euery one of theſe Tranſames or Curſours
muſt be cut with a ſquare hole in the very middeſt, ſo as they
may be made to runne iuſt vpon the ſtaffe to and fro, theſe things
being prepared, you muſt deuide thrée ſides of the ſtaffe into certaine
degrées to ſerue the thrée ſeuerall curſours as followeth.
                     Firſt you muſt vpon a ſmooth ſquare Table ſomewhat longer
euery way then the ſtaffe, and for want of one ſuch Table you
may ioyne two Tables that may ſtand eauen together, drawe by
helpe of a true long ſquire a right Triangle marked with the letters
A. B. C. and let A. be the right Angle, and the Centre as
you ſée in the figure following, and let both the ſides of the ſaide
Triangle be of like length to your ſtaffe, then putting the one
foote of your compaſſe in the Centre A. and the other foote in B.
or C. drawe a quarter of a circle from C. to B. and hauing deuided
that quarter into two equall partes, make a pricke in the
middeſt marked with the letter D. and laying your ruler to that
pricke and to the Centre A. drawe a right line which ſhall be A.
D. then deuide the halfe Quadrant D. B. into nine equall partes
making 90. equall degrées procéeding from B. to D. ſo as the
firſt degrée may be at B. and the 90 at D. that done, take with
your compaſſe the iuſt halfe of the longeſt Tranſame, and kéeping
your compaſſe at that wideneſſe, ſet the one foote in the Centre
A. and the other foote in the line A. C. ſo farre as that wideneſſe
will extende, and there make a pricke marked with the letter
E. then from that point drawe a right line that may be a Parallell

to the line A. B. which line ſhall be E. F. then take with
your compaſſe the halfe of the middle Tranſame, and kéeping
your compaſſe at that wideneſſe, ſet the one foote in A. and the
other foote in the line A. C. ſo farre as that wideneſſe doth extend
and there make a pricke marked with the letter G. and from that
pricke drawe a right line that may be a Parallell to A. B which
line ſhall be G. H. Thirdly take the one halfe of the leaſt Tranſame
with your compaſſe and tranſferre that wideneſſe to the line
A. C. ſetting the one foote of your compaſſe in A. and make a
pricke with the other foote in the line A. C. as before, marked
with the letter I. and from that pricke drawe another right line
that may be a Parallell to the line A. B. which ſhall be the line
I. K. Now to graduate the firſt ſide of your ſtaffe to ſerue the
longeſt Tranſame, you muſt lay the ruler to the centre A. and
drawe right lines from thence to euery degrée of the circumference
contained betwixt 90. and 30. and thoſe lines ſhall deuide
the line E. F. into ſo many vnequall ſpaces as doe belong to the
firſt ſide of the ſtaffe, for you muſt lay the firſt ſide of the ſtaffe
to that line to be marked according to the diuiſion of that line,
the neather ſection whereof towardes the lower ende of the ſtaffe
muſt be marked with 90. and the vpper ſection with 30. ſo is the
firſt ſide of your ſtaffe truely deuided to ſerue the longeſt Tranſame,
now to ſerue the middle Tranſame you muſt deuide the
line G. H. by drawing right lines from the Centre A. to euerie
degrée of the circumference contained betwixt 30. and 10. which
lines will deuide the line G. H. into vnequall ſpaces, of which
ſpaces the loweſt muſt be marked with 30. and the higheſt with
tenne, according to which diuiſions you muſt marke the ſeconde
ſide of your ſtaffe by laying the ſide cloſe to the line G. H. ſo
ſhall that ſide be marked to ſerue the middle Tranſame, then
lay your ruler againe to the Centre A. and drawe right lines to
euery degrée of the circumference contained betwixt 10. and the
firſt or ſecond degrée next to B. and thoſe lines ſhall deuide the
line I. K. into vnequall ſpaces, the loweſt whereof is to be marked
with 10. and the higheſt with 2. or 5. according as your
inſtrument will beare, and according to thoſe ſections you muſt
deuide the thirde ſide of your ſtaffe by laying the ſame cloſe to
that ſaide line I. K. and remember to make your lines of diuiſion

ſo finely as is poſſible, ſo ſhall your ſtaffe be the more truely
graduated. And noce that in graduating your ſtaffe, you ſhall
not néede to drawe right lines from the Centre to euery degrée
of the circumference contayned betwixt the 90. degrée and the
60. degrée, for when the ſunne or any ſtarre is higher then 60.
degrées, you muſt vſe your Aſtrolabe and not your ſtaffe which
will not ſerue you to looke ſo right vp to take ſo great an altitude
eyther of ſunne or ſtarre.

                     Whenſoeuer you would take the
Altitude of the Sunne or of anie
ſtarre, you haue firſt to conſider
whether the ſunne or ſtarre be 30.
degrées or more high: for then you
muſt place the longeſt Tranſame
vppon your Staffe. And ſet the
lower end of your ſtaffe marked with
ninetie to your eye, which is alwayes
to be done howe high or lowe
ſo euer the ſunne or ſtarre be, and
you muſt mooue the Tranſame eyther
forwarde or backewarde vntill
you may ſée by the vpper ende
of the Tranſame the bodie or middeſt
of the ſunne or ſtarre, and with
the neather ende of the Tranſame
the Horizon, and then looke in what
degrée the Tranſame cutteth the
ſtaffe, for that is the Altitude of the
Sunne and ſtarre at that preſent,
but if the ſunne be not 30. degrées
high, then you muſt put on the middle
Tranſame, and if hee bée leſſe
then tenne degrées high, you muſt
put on the ſhorteſt Tranſame, and
thē do as before. Thus much touching
the Croſſe ſtaffe with 3. Tranſames,
nowe I will deſcribe vnto
you Maiſter Hood his ſtaffe, and
ſhew you the vſe thereof.

                     The croſſe ſockett
                     The Vane.
                  
                  Firſt of 2. ſquare
rulers ech one bearing in thick
neſſe thrée quarters of an inch
or there abouts euerye way
ſquare, and in length I would
wiſh ech ruler not to containe
aboue one yarde, for then in
ſome vſes they would waxe toppe heauie.
                  Of which two rulers the one marked with the letters A. B. is
called the Tranſame, which is deuided on the one ſide into 45. degrées
beginning at one and ſo foorth to 45. And euery degrée is
deuided againe into ſixe leſſer parts making 60. minutes, for ſixe
times ten maketh 60. which ſerueth for Aſtronomicall vſes.
                  And on the oppoſite ſide to that, the ſaid Tranſame is deuided
into 1000. equal parts beginning at 25. and ſo increaſeth by 25.
vntill you come to 1000. Euerie which 25. partes is deuided
into fiue leſſer partes, and euery one of thoſe againe into fiue
partes, which maketh in all 25. for fiue times fiue is 25 and this
ſerueth for Geometricall vſes.
                  
                     
The other ſquare ruler called the yarde & marked with the letters
C. D. is deuided into degrées like to thoſe of the Tranſame
procéeding from 45. to 90. which together with thoſe degrées
that be in the firſt ſide of the Tranſame doe make vppe the number
of a iuſt Quadrant to ſerue Aſtronomicall vſes. And the ſide
oppoſite to that is deuided into 1000. degrées procéeding from
25. to 25. like in all reſpectes vnto the oppoſite ſide of the Tranſame
to ſerue Geometricall vſes.
                  The third part belonging to this inſtrument is a double ſocket
of braſſe marked with this letter E. ioyned together with right
Angles, and ſtanding croſſe one to another. And ech ſocket hath
a ſkrewe to kéepe the ſame faſt to his ſtaffe at any degrée that you
liſt to ſet the ſame: And alſo a long notch to the intent it may be
layde cloſe to any degrée of the ruler whereto it belongeth.
                  The fourth part belonging to this inſtrument is a vane of
braſſe marked with the letter F. the vpper edge whereof is pearced
with a little round hole for the beame of the ſunne to paſſe thorough
the ſame. And this vane is made with a ſocket, and with
a ſkrew to hold it faſt to that ruler whereon it is ſet. And for certaine
Geometricall vſes it were neceſſarie (as ſome thinke) that
there were two ſuch vanes.
                  Thus hauing deſcribed all the partes of the foreſaide inſtrument,
I wil now ſhew you how to ſet thoſe parts together: which
to ſerue Aſtronomicall vſes is thus done.

                     FIrſt put the neather ende of the Tranſame marked
with the 45. degrée into the double ſocket, ſo
as the Tranſame may ſtand right vppe, and that
the notch of the ſocket may méete euen with the
ſayde 45. degrée, and turne the ſkrewe that the
ſocket may ſtand faſt at that degrée, that done put
the yarde into the croſſe ſocket, ſo as the notch of the ſayd croſſe
ſocket may lie iuſt vppon the 45. degrée of the yarde, and there

make it faſt by turning the ſkrewe: then put on the vane, which
to ſerue Aſtronomicall vſes muſt be ſet at the higheſt ende of the
Tranſame, in ſuch ſort as the vpper edge of the vane pearced
with the hole may ſtande eauen with the firſt point or ſtréeke of
the ſaide Tranſame, and when the Tranſame ſtandeth on the
left hande of the yarde, then the vane muſt be placed on the right
ſide of the Tranſame: But if the Tranſame doe ſtande on the
right hande of the yard, then the vane muſt be placed vpon the left
ſide of the Tranſame: And the yard and Tranſame would be ſo ſet
together as the degrées of the Tranſame procéeding downeward
from one to 45. may looke towards you, that is to ſay, may ſtand
right before your face: And the degrées of the yarde procéeding
from 45. to 90. would lie vpwarde, ſo as the ende of the yarde
marked with 90. may point to your breaſt or be ſet to your eye
as occaſion ſhall require, for ſuch Aſtronomicall vſes as heere
doe followe.

Chap. 16.
                  
                     THe Staffe being ſet in ſuch order as is before
taught, goe into ſome open place whereas you
may ſée the ſunne, and turning the ende of the
yarde marked with ninetie towardes your breſt,
holde the yarde ſo leuell as you can, that it
may be a iuſt Parallell to the Horizon, and turne
both your face, and alſo the vane of the tranſame towardes the
ſunne. Then you haue to conſider whether the ſunne at that preſent
be eyther iuſt 45. degrées high, or more, or els leſſe then 45.
degrées, which you ſhall eaſily knowe thus: For if he be iuſt 45.
degrées high, then the ſhadowe of the vpper edge of the vane
will ſtréeke iuſt vpon the 90. degrée of the yarde lying at your
breſt: But if he be more then 45. degrées high, then the ſhadowe
of the vane will ſtréeke ſhort of the 90. degrée: And if it be leſſe
it will caſt no ſhadowe at all vppon the yarde, but ſtréeke cleane
beyond it ouer your ſhoulder. Nowe knowing by this meanes
whether the altitude of the ſunne be more or leſſe then 45. degrées,
you ſhall take his true altitude thus:
                  If his altitude be leſſe then 45. degrées, then make the Tranſame
to ſinke downe through his ſocket vntill the vpper edge of
the vane ſtanding vppon the Tranſame doe caſte his ſhadowe
iuſt vppon the nintieth degrée of the yarde. Then looke at what
degrée the notch of the Socket wherein the Tranſome ſtandeth,
doth cut the ſaide Tranſame, for that is the true altitude of the
ſunne at that inſtant.
                  But if the altitude of the ſunne be more then 45. degrées, then
drawe the double ſocket vpon the yarde nigher towardes your
breſt, vntill you ſée the ſhadowe of the vane to fall iuſt vppon
the ninetieth degrée of the yard, that done, looke vpon what degrée
of the yarde the notch of the double ſocket cutteth, and that is the
true altitude of the ſunne at that inſtant.

                     THere is no difference betwixt the order of the taking
the altitude of the ſunne and of anie ſtarre,
but onely that in taking the altitude of any ſtarre,
you muſt ſet the ende of the yarde marked with
the 90. degrée to your eye, ſtaying the ſame vppon
the vpper bone of your chéeke, and that in ſuch ſort as you may
ſée the ſtarre by a right line paſſing from the ende of the yarde, lying
at your eye to the vpper edge of the vane at one inſtant, being
alwayes ſure that the yarde lie leuell, making a iuſt Parallell
to the Horizon, which Horizon is more eaſie to be ſéene vpon
the ſea, then vpon the lande, for on the ſea there be neither hils
nor trées to hinder the ſight thereof.
               
               
                  How to take the diſtance betwixt two ſtarres with
Maiſter Hoodes ſtaffe.
Chap. 18.
                  
                     THe inſtrument being ſet in ſuch order as was firſt
taught: Set the ende of the yarde marked with 90.
at your eye: and let the other end of the yarde directly
point to one of thoſe ſtarres whoſe diſtance you
ſéeke, and turne the edge of the vane to the other ſtar
be it on the right hande or on the left, according as you thinke
good your ſelfe: Then you muſt conſider whether the diſtance of
the two ſtarres be iuſt 45. degrées or more or elſe leſſe, for if it be
iuſt 45. degrées, then the outward edge of the vane, and the ende
of the yarde marked with 90. will be anſwerable in your ſight to
that diſtance without any more adoo. But if the diſtance be leſſe
then 45. degrées, which you ſhall eaſily perceiue by your eye (for
then the ſtarre that is on your right or left hand, will appeare
within the vane and fall ſhort thereof) then you muſt thruſt down
the Tranſame in his ſocket vntill you may ſée the two ſtarres by a
right line paſſing from the ende of the yarde marked with 90.

and lying at your eye, right foorth to the outwarde edge of the
vane, that done, looke in what degrée the double ſocket cutteth the
Tranſame, and that ſhall be the true diſtance of the two ſtarres.
But if the diſtance of the two ſtarres be more then 45. degrées,
which you may knowe alſo by your eye, becauſe the ſtarre which
is on your left or right hande, will appeare cleane without the
vane: then drawe the double ſocket together with the Tranſame
towardes your eye, vntill you may ſée the two ſtarres by a
right line as before, and the degrées which the notch of the double
ſocket cutteth on the yarde, ſhall be the true diſtance of the
two ſtarres.
                  Thus much touching the Aſtronomicall vſes of M. Hoodes
ſtaffe meete for the Mariner. Now as for ſetting of the ſaid ſtaffe
to ſerue Geometricall vſes, and to finde out the manifolde concluſions
to be done thereby, I wholly referre you to M. Hoodes
owne booke, thinking it good now to ſpeake ſomewhat of the Mariners
Aſtrolabe or Ringe, and of his vſuall Croſſe-ſtaffe.
               
               
                  Of the Mariners Aſtrolabe.

                        MIchaell Cogniet ſetteth downe the making of a
new kinde of Aſtrolabe, which he calleth an vniuerſall
Aſtrolabe, onely becauſe the declination of the
ſunne euery day is added in manner of a Table to
the one ende of the Diopter of the ſaide Aſtrolabe,
which is of no great importance ſith the ſunnes declination doth
alter in the ſpace of 30. yeares and leſſe, which being expired, the
declination is to be new calculated: In the meane time that Table
which Norman hath ſet downe in his Attractiue, and alſo that
which is more lately calculated ſet downe by my ſelfe in the firſt
part of my Spheare, and likewiſe in this Treatiſe whereas I
treat of the motion of the ſunne and of his declination, may ſerue
theſe 20. yeares and more without any greater error: Wherfore
leauing to ſpeake any further of Cogniet his vniuerſall Aſtrolabe,
I will deſcribe here the common Aſtrolabe and Croſſe-ſtaffe vſed
by moſt Mariners, the ſhape or figure of both which here foloweth.
                  
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  A briefe deſcription of the Mariners Aſtrolabe,
and the vſes thereof.
Chap. 20.
                  
                     THe limbe of the Mariners Aſtrolabe is traced as
you ſée with thrée Circles, making two ſpaces to
containe therein the degrées and numbers of altitude:
and theſe Circles are deuided by two
croſſe lines called Diameters, and cutting one
another in the very Centre of the Aſtrolabe into
4. equall parts, of which quarters the vppermoſt on the left hand
towards the Ringle is only marked with degrées and numbers,
as you may ſée in the figure: In which figure the perpendicular
Diameter ſignifieth the Zenith, or the line of South and
North, at the vpper end whereof is faſtened the Ringle or handle.
And the other ouerthwart Diameter ſignifieth the Horizon the
one end whereof on the left hande ſignifieth the Eaſt point, and
the other end on the right hande the Weſt point. And to this Aſtrolabe
(as to all other) doth belong a ruler or Diopter, which
as you ſée hath at ech end a ſquare tablet pearced with two holes,
the one greater and the other leſſer, the greater to looke through
with your eye, to take the altitude of any ſtarre or of the ſunne
being ſo darkned by ſome cloud as though it caſteth no ſhadowe,
yet it may be ſéene with the eye: And the leſſer hole is for the
ſunnes beame to paſſe thorough when he ſhineth cleare, and ſome
Aſtrolabes are deuided in like maner of the Zenith on both ſides,
and haue two Diopters, whereof the one is pearced with a great
hole, and the other with a ſmaller hole to ſerue to ſuch purpoſes
as is aboue ſaide.
                  The vſe of this Aſtrolabe is onely to take the altitude of the
ſunne at any time of the day, or of any fixed ſtarre or Planet in
the night, in ſuch ſort as is before taught in my deſcription of
Maiſter Blagraue his Aſtrolabe, in the third and fourth Propoſition
thereof.
               
               
                  
                  A briefe deſcription of the Mariners Croſſe-ſtaffe.
Chap. 21.
                  
                     THis ſtaffe conſiſteth of two foure ſquare rulers of
woode, whereof the one is called the yarde, and the
other the Tranſame or Croſſe: And the yard containing
in length moſt commonly thrée quarters of
a yarde is the longer péece, and is deuided into 90.
vnequall degrées: for from 10. to 90. the degrées doe grow leſſer
and leſſer, and the Tranſame containing for the moſt part but one
third part of the yard, is cut with a ſquare hole in the middeſt, ſo
as it may runne vp and downe vpon the yard, & ſome Tranſames
haue two running vanes to be ſet at what widenes you liſt, to take
thereby the diſtance of any two ſtarres.
               
               
                  The vſes of the Mariners croſſe-ſtaffe.
Chap. 22.
                  
                     THe vſe of the Mariners ſtaffe chiefly conſiſteth in two
points, that is, to know therby the altitude of the ſun
in the day time, or of any ſtarre in the night ſeaſon,
and the other is to know thereby the diſtance betwixt
any two ſtarres.
                  The firſt is thus done, hauing put the ſtaffe or yarde through
the ſquare hole of the Tranſame, ſet the end of the yard which is
marked with 90. to your eye, laying that end vpon the vpper point
of your chéeke bone kéeping your legs cloſe together, and hauing
directed the other end of the yard towards the ſunne or ſtar whoſe
altitude you ſéeke▪ mooue the Tranſame to and fro or vp & downe,
vntill you may ſée with the one eye (winking with the other) the
one end of the Tranſame to méete▪ iuſt with the Centre or middeſt
of the ſunne or ſtarre, and the other end to touch the Horizon both
at one inſtant, and that degrée of the yard which the ſquare edge of
the Tranſame cutteth, wil ſhew how high the ſunne or ſtarre is at
that preſent: And in taking the altitude of the ſunne or of any ſtar,
remember alwaies to holde the yarde ſo leuell as it may be a iuſt
Parallel to the Horizon, for ſo ſhall you take the altitude the more
truely. Now as touching the ſecond point, which is to knowe

the true diſtance betwixt any two ſtarres you muſt doe thus.
                  Set the end of the yarde marked with ninetie to your eye as
before, and mooue the Tranſame to and fro vntill you may ſée the
one end of the Tranſame to anſwere the one ſtarre, and the other
end thereof to anſwere the other ſtarre, for that degrée of the yard
which the Tranſame cutteth will ſhewe the diſtance betwixt the
two ſtarres: And if the two ſtarres be ſo nigh together, as they
wil not conueniently anſwere the two ends of the Tranſame, then
you may vſe the two mooueable vanes, which (as I ſaide before)
you may ſet at what wideneſſe you liſt, but yet ſo as they may both
ſtand equally diſtant from the Centre of the Tranſame or from
both ends thereof.
                  Thus hauing ſhewed the vſe of the Mariners Ring and croſſe
ſtaffe, I will now procéede to the other inſtruments, whereof the
two Globes are part, which Globes I haue alreadie deſcribed
and ſhewed the chiefeſt vſes thereof in a Treatiſe by it ſelfe, and
as for the vniuerſall Horologe to know thereby the equall houre
of the day in euery Latitude, and alſo the Nocturnlabe to knowe
the houre of the night, I ſhall ſpeake of the one when I come to
ſpeake of the ſunne, & of the other whereas I treate of the North
ſtarre and of his guards, for there I will ſet downe the figure and
ſhape of ech inſtrument, and ſhewe how to vſe the ſame: But the
two chiefeſt inſtruments belonging to a Mariner, are his compaſſe
and his Carde, whereof I come now to ſpeake.
                  But ſith the Fly of the Compaſſe repreſenteth the 32. windes,
I thinke good firſt briefely to define what the wind is, and to ſhew
howe many windes the auncient Mariners did vſe, I ſay here
briefely becauſe I haue alreadie ſpoken ſufficiently thereof in the
latter end of my Spheare.
               
               
                  Of the winde, what it is, and of the diuers kindes
and names thereof.
Chap. 23.
                  
                     THe winde according to Ariſtotle, is an exhalation
hotte and dry, engendred in the bowels of the earth,
and being gotten out is carried ſidelong vpon the
face of the earth. And of windes there be foure principall

which doe take their names from the foure quarters of the
earth from whence they blowe, that is North, South, Eaſt and
Weſt: And though the Gréekes and Latines deuide euery quarter
into thrée partes, and thereby make in all but twelue windes,
whoſe names both Gréeke and Latine are ſet downe in the latter
ende of my Spheare, yet our latter Sea men to be the more
aſſured of their Rowtes and Courſes, doe deuide euery quarter
of the Horizon into eight windes, ſo as in all they make 32.
windes, giuing them ſuch names as are ſet downe in this figure
heere following repreſenting the Flye of the Mariners
compaſſe.
                  
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  A briefe deſcription of the Mariners compaſſe, and
the vſe thereof.
Chap. 24.
                  
                     THe Mariners Compaſſe may be very well deuided
into two eſſentiall partes, that is, the Fly, and
the wyars touched with the Lodeſtarre called in
Latine Magnes. And firſt you haue to vnderſtand,
that the flie is a round white Carde traced
with 32. lines all paſſing thorough the Centre of
the Circle, which lines doe ſignifie the 32. windes in ſuch ſort as
the figure before ſet downe doth ſhew, of which lines that which is
marked with the Flower-deluce ſignifieth the north, whoſe point
oppoſite is the South, and that which is marked with a Croſſe
ſignifieth the Eaſt, whoſe point oppoſite is the Weſt, and the outtermoſt
Circle of the ſaid Fly ſignifieth the Horizon, which circle
is alſo deuided into 360. degrées like vnto thoſe of the Equinoctiall,
ſo as euery ſpace bétwixt point and point cóntaineth 11. degrées
and 15. minutes, which is the fourth part of a degrée. Moreouer,
this Circle is deuided in 24. houres by allowing to euery
point thrée quarters of an houre, which is 45. minutes, for an
houre containeth 60.
                        m
                      and halfe an houre containeth 30.
                        m
                      and
the quarter 15
                        m. Moreouer, the common Mariners doe deuide
euery point of the Compaſſe into foure quarters to make the more
exact account of their Routes or Rombes. But now as touching
the other eſſentiall part of the Mariners Compaſſe which is the

wyars, you ſhall vnderſtand that they
are of yron or ſtéele, and made in this
forme, and being touched at the one
end with the Lodeſtone, they are faſtened
to the backe ſide of the Fly, eyther right vnder the line marked
with the Flowre-deluce, or elſe ſomewhat diſtant from the
ſame, either towardes the Eaſt or elſe towardes the Weſt, for
ſuch cauſe as ſhall be declared in the next Chapter, for thoſe
wyars being thus touched, doe make that part of the Fly that is
marked with the Flowre-deluce, to ſtand alwayes towardes the
North, and to that ende the Fly hauing in the Centre a latten
ſocket, is put into a turned boxe, in the middeſt whereof is a

ſharpe pointed Latten pinne, vpon which the Flie turneth about,
and that turned boxe is couered with glaſſe, partlie to kéepe the
Flie cleane, but chieflie that the winde ſhould not mooue it to and
fro. And this turned boxe is hanged by two rounde narrowe
plates of Latten in another ſquare boxe of thinne wainſcot boord,
ſo as it may alwayes hang leuell, howſoeuer the ſhippe ſwayeth
or inclineth on either ſide, and though of the Mariners Compaſſe
there be diuers vſes, as you ſhall perceiue hereafter, yet
the chiefeſt end and vſe thereof is to ſhewe the North part of the
world, whereby the Shipmaiſter knowing what courſe hée hath
to holde and how the port or place to which hee goeth, beareth
from the place from which he departeth, may by looking alwayes
to his Compaſſe, know how to direct his ſhip accordinglie.
               
               
                  Of the Lodeſtone, and of the variation of the Compaſſe
in Northeaſting and Northweſting.
Chapter. 25
                  
                     THe Lodeſtone or Adamant, called in Latine
Magnes, & in Italian Calamita, hath two marueilous
great and ſecret properteies or vertues,
the one to drawe ſtéele or Iron vnto it, and the other
to ſhew the North and South parte of the
world, of which ſtones ſome bée of more force
than others according to the place from whence they come.
For thoſe are counted beſt which are found in the Eaſt Indies
vpon the coaſte of China and Bengala, which is no ſhell but a
whole ſtone of ſanguine collour like to Iron, and is firme, maſſie,
and heauie, and will drawe or lift vp the iuſt waight of it
ſelfe in Iron or ſtéele. And as Norman ſaith in his newe Attractiue,
ſuch ſtones are commonlie ſolde for their waight in
Siluer.
                  Next to this, Norman commendeth the redde ſtone of Arabia,
hee commendeth alſo the ſtone of Almaine, which is in
collour like to Iron, but ſpongeous, and thereby lighter than
the other. And as for the blacke and white ſtone of Elba, which
is an Ilande, not farre from Piombino, hée ſaith that the vertue
thereof is but of ſmall force, and of no long continuance.

But the worſte are thoſe that come from Norway, whoſe collour
is mixt with graie, I haue hearde that there bee of them
here in England, but howe good I knowe not, it is maruell
that Norman maketh no mention thereof, whoſe Treatiſe called
the newe Attractiue, together with Maiſter Borough his
addition I would wiſh all that be ſtudious in this Arte to reade
moſt diligentlie, for truelie in mine opinion the ſecretes of this
Stone and variation of the Compaſſe, was neuer better diſciphered,
nor by more experiences tried than it hath bene by theſe two
men laſt named. The booke is moſt neceſſarie for nauigation
and of an eaſie price, méete for euerie poore mans purſe, though
perhaps in ſome pointes not méete for euerie mans vnderſtanding.
Now whenſoeuer the wyers are to be touched with this
ſtone, they muſt be made very cleane and void of all ruſt, to the intent
that the Iron may the more firmelie receiue the vertue of the
ſtone. And it is well knowne by good experience, that by vertue
of the Lodeſtone the North point of the Compaſſe declineth alwayes
from the true North, either to the Eaſt, or Weſt more or
leſſe according to the latitude of the place wherein you are vnleſſe
you be right vnder the Meridian of the Azores. And therefore,
moſt men in theſe partes of the worlde doe vſe to ſet the North
point of the wiers not right vnder the Floure de Luce ſignifying
the North part of the world, but rather ſomewhat inclining towarde
the Eaſt halfe a point or thereabout to auoide the Northeaſting
and Northweſting of the Compaſſe, the cauſe of which
declination by diuers learned men hath bene diuerſly taught, but
not rightlie as Michaell Cogniet ſaith, vntill Mercator found
out the true cauſe, who firſt learned by the experience of one
Francis of Deepe, an excellent Pilot, that in ſayling vnder the
Meridian which paſſeth thorough the Iles called the Azores,
the néedle doth decline neither Eaſt nor Weſt, whereupon Mercator
by calculating the variation of the Compaſſe at Ratiſbone,
found that the Pole of the Lodeſtone ought to be put in that Meridian
which paſſeth through the foreſaid Iles ſo as it may be diſtant
from the Pole of the world ſixtéene degrées and ½ or rather
as Maiſter Borough ſaith, ſixtéene degrées and twentie two
minutes, and by that calculation Cogniet hath found the variation
of the Compaſſe at the towne of Antwerp to be 9. degrées.

And Maiſter Borough by the helpe of the newe inſtrument of
variation firſt made by Robert Norman, and afterward perfected
by himſelfe, hath found the variation for London to be
11. degrées and fiftéene minutes, which is a whole point from
North to Eaſt. But whenſoeuer you depart from the foreſaid
Meridian of the Azores, bée it neuer ſo little, either towardes
the Eaſt or Weſt, the néedle will varie and decline accordinglie.
And his greateſt declination is when you come to a
full quarter of that Parallell wherein you ſaile, for from thence
it declineth leſſe and leſſe vntill you come againe vnder the foreſaid
Meridian, which thing Cogniet doeth plainelie demonſtrate
by this Figure here made of purpoſe.
                  
                  In which Figure the letter A. which is in the verie center
of the Circle repreſenteth the north Pole, and the right
line, marked with the letters C. B. ſignifieth the Meridian
which paſſeth through the Iles Azores, in which line is a
point or pricke marked with the letter D. ſignifying the Pole
of the Lodeſtone, diſtant from the North Pole ſixtéene degrées
and a halfe. Nowe, if your ſhippe bee in the point B. then your
needle declineth on neither ſide, but pointeth right to the North

Pole, and alſo to the Pole of the Lodeſtone. But if you ſayle
Eaſtwarde and arriue to the point E. then the right line of the
North is E. A. but your néedle declineth on the right hande
towardes his owne Pole D. which is to the Eaſt, ſo much as
the angle A. E. D. doth ſhewe. Likewiſe if you ſaile from B.
Weſtwarde to the point F. the right line of the North ſhall bée
F. A. but your needle will decline to his owne Pole D. towardes
the Weſt, ſo much as the angle A. F. D. doth ſhew.
And to bée ſhort, the néedle doeth neuer ſhewe the right North,
but onelie in C. or B. to eyther of which pointes the nigher that
you approch the leſſe your néedle declineth, and the more that you
goe from anie of theſe two pointes the more your néedle declineth
either Eaſt or Weſt, but the greateſt declination thereof is
in H. or G. for then you are a iuſt quarter from the foreſaide
Meridian. Alſo by this Figure he plainelie ſheweth that of two
ſundrie townes hauing one ſelfe Meridian, that which is néereſt
to the Pole of the worlde hath greateſt declination. As for example,
ſuppoſe the letter I. in the foreſaide Figure to ſignifie
that towne which is nigher to the Pole, and the letter E. to
ſignifie that towne which is more diſtant from the Pole, both
townes béeing vnder one ſelfe Meridian E. A. Here you ſée
that the Néedle being in E. doth ſhewe the Pole of the Lodeſtone
by the line E. D. and béeing in I. it ſheweth the Pole of the Lodeſtone
by the line I. D. Nowe according to the doctrine of Euclyde,
the angle A. I. D. is greater than the angle A. E. D.
whereby it followeth that the néedle declineth more in I. than
in E. But whereas Mercator affirmeth that there ſhould bée a
mine or great rocke of Adamant, whereunto all other leſſer
rockes or néedles touched with the Lodeſtone doe incline as to
their chiefe fountaine, that opinion ſéemeth to mée verie ſtrange,
for truelie I rather beléeue with Robert Norman, that the
properties of the ſtone, as well in drawing ſtéele, as in ſhewing
the north Pole, are ſecrete vertues giuen of God to that ſtone
for mans neceſſarie vſe and behoofe, of which ſecrete vertues no
man is able to ſhewe the true cauſe.
               
               
                  
                  How to find out the variation of the compaſſe in every latitude.
Chapter. 26.
                  
                     
                        WIlliam Boorne in his Regiment of the Sea teacheth
diuers wayes how to finde out the variation of the
Compaſſe, as well by the Sun in the day time, as by
the North ſtarre in the night ſeaſon. Firſt, thus mark
at what point of the Compaſſe the Sunne riſeth and
ſetteth, for if hee riſeth at the Eaſt point of the Compaſſe, and goeth
down at the Weſt Northweſt point, then the Compaſſe is varied
one whole point, that is to ſay, the North point of the Compaſſe
ſtandeth North and by Eaſt. But becauſe the aire is ſeldom
cleare at the riſing and ſetting of the Sunne, you may do thus,
take with your Aſtrolabe or croſſe ſtaffe the altitude of the Sun in
the forenoone, the ſooner the better, at ſome iuſt point of the compaſſe,
& take again his altitude in the afternoone, when he is in like
degrée of altitude, and mark therwith at what point of the Compaſſe
the Sunne hath ſuch altitude, and by the difference thereof
you ſhall know the variation of the Compaſſe. As for example,
you finde by your Aſtrolabe or croſſe ſtaffe, that the Sunne is 20.
degrées high at the Southeaſt point of the Compaſſe, and obſeruing
the ſame againe in the afternoone you finde his height to bée
20. degrées at the Weſt Southweſt point of the Compas, wherby
you ſée that the compaſſe is varied one whole point, that is to
ſay, that the North point ſtandeth North and by Eaſt, and the
South point is South and by Weſt. He teacheth it alſo another
way, which is thus.
                  Take with your croſſe ſtaffe or Aſtrolabe the height of the Sun
at noontyde, which is called the Meridian altitude of the Sun,
and thereby you ſhall haue the true Meridian of the place where
you are, with which Meridian if the South point of your Compaſſe
doth agrée, then your Compas hath no variation at al, but if
the ſouth point therof do ſwarue or incline on either ſide from the
ſaid Meridian, marke how much it differeth, and that difference
will ſhewe you the variation. Nowe to knowe the variation of the
Compaſſe by the North ſtarre, doe thus, ſet your Compaſſe with
the North ſtarre, and if you finde them to agrée, then there is no

variation, but note that this is to be done when the two guardes
or pointers of Charles waine are right ouer or right vnder the
North ſtarre, for if theſe two ſtarres be Weſt from the North
ſtar, then the North ſtar is a third part of a point vnto the Eaſtward
of the North Pole, and if the ſaid two ſtarres be right Eaſt
from the North ſtarre, then the North ſtarre is a thirde part of a
point vnto the Weſtward of the north Pole.
                  The compaſſe (as Bourne ſaith) doth varie moſt in ſayling
long voyages Eaſt and Weſt, and though it varieth two or thrée
points, yet you may know what courſe to holde without alteration
of the Wiers any maner of way. As for example, ſuppoſe the
Northeaſt point to ſtand right North, and your courſe is to goe
right Weſt, here in this caſe you may vſe the Southweſt point in
ſtead of the Weſt point, whereby you may perceiue that it maketh
no great matter which point ſtandeth due North, ſo as you
take that point of the Compaſſe for the North which directly
pointeth to the North. But Robert Norman and Maſter Borough
by the help of their new inuented Inſtrument of variation,
doe ſhewe how to finde out the variation of the Compaſſe much
more exactlie than euer it hath bene heretofore taught, which inſtrument
together with the booke, I would wiſh all ſea men to
haue, and therby to learne the perfect vſe of the inſtrument, which
vſe that booke teacheth both plainlie and learnedlie, in which booke
is alſo prooued by diuers demonſtrations that there is no ſuch attractiue
point as ſome haue dreamed, but rather a reſpectiue
point whereunto the néedle of your Compaſſe wil alwayes turne
in what part of the world ſoeuer you ſaile. But of the place where
that reſpectiue point ſhould be, diuers learned Pilottes haue
had diuers opinions, for ſome haue imagined it to be in the heauens,
and ſome aboue the heauens, if it were in the heauens, then
the néedle would dayly turne about, and alter according to the
motion of that heauen, wherein the ſaid point is, which is nothing
ſo. And to bée aboue the heauens, it is contrarie to the old rule
of Philoſophie, which ſaith that Extra Coelum non eſt locus,
and therefore Norman and Maiſter Borough haue great reaſon
to ſay that it is in the bodie of the earth beneath the Horizon,
for they haue tried by diuers liuely experiments that the North
parte of the néedle of his owne accorde and nature would alwaies

decline downwarde if it be not otherwiſe counterpoiſed or letted,
& by their demonſtrations ſuppoſing the Meridian of the Azores
to be the firſt or common Meridian, and alſo knowing the altitude
of the Pole at London to be 51. degrées, 32. minutes, they find
that according to that latitude the Pole of the Lodeſtone, béeing
in the vpper face of the earth, and right vnder the foreſaid common
Meridian is 25. degrées 44. minutes diſtant from the Pole
of the worlde. And the point reſpectiue to bee diſtant in a right
line from vnder the Horizon of London 71. degrées, 50 minutes
and the variation of the Compaſſe to be as hath bene ſaid before,
11. degrées and 15. minutes, but to find out the true place of the
reſpectiue point in euerie latitude, they ſay that no certaine rules
can as yet be ſet downe, by reaſon that the compaſſe doeth vary
more ſodenly in one place than in another, for in ſome place it will
varie more in ſailing 200. leagues than in another place in ſayling
400. leagues. Againe, it will ſometimes be retrograde, for
M. Borough in ſayling betwixt the North Cape and Vaigates,
towards the Northeaſt, and looking by his computation that the
néedle ſhould haue increaſed his variation towards the Eaſt, hée
found that it was ſodainly turned backward towarde the Weſt,
notwithſtanding both Norman and M. Borough doe affirme that
though the Compaſſe hath in ſeuerall Horizons ſeuerall variations,
yet in any one Horizon the néedle alwaies reſpecteth one only
point without alteration, and that in his declining it kéepeth
the like order and that certainlie in euery place. And although the
néedle of the Compaſſe by reaſon of the waightines of the Flie
cannot decline downward according to his own propertie, but onlie
ſheweth the point reſpectiue alwayes vpon the Horizon, which
indéed, as they ſay, is moſt neceſſarie for nauigation, yet by ſuch
meanes and concluſions as are ſet down in the foreſaid book, a diligent
Pilot hauing with him a perfect ſtone may by exact obſeruations
find out the increaſing or decreaſing of the declnation of
the néedle, which declination you ſhall find, as they thinke to bée
more or leſſe according as the point reſpectiue is more or leſſe diſtant
from the place whereas the triall is made, which being diligently
obſerued in ſundrie places, with the certaine variation of
the néedle from the Meridian, the true place of the point reſpectiue
may be found out as they thinke.
               
               
                  
                  Of the Mariners Card, and of the making thereof.
Chapter. 27.
                  
                     THe Mariners Carde, which ſome cal a nautical
Planiſphear, is none other thing, but a deſcription
made in plano vpon paper or parchment
of the places that be in the ſea, or on the land next
adioyning to the ſea, as points, Capes, Bayes,
Portes, Floods, Ilandes, Rockes, Sandes,
and ſuch like, And ſuch Cardes are either vniuerſall or particular,
the vniuerſall Cards are thoſe wherin are deſcribed the moſt
parts of the world, ſuch as is the vniuerſall Carde or Map of
Mercator, or of Plancius. The particular are thoſe wherin ſome
ſpeciall partes of the ſea and land are deſcribed. And both theſe
kindes of Cardes are traced with certaine lines, whereof ſome
are called Meridians, ſome Parallels, and ſome the Lines of the
Mariners compaſſe, ſhewing the 32. winds before deſcribed in
the beginning of this Treatiſe. The order of making which
cardes in times paſt was woont to be thus.
                  Firſt drawe with a paire of compaſſes a ſecrete circle that
may be put out, ſo great as you ſhall thinke méet for your carde,
which circle ſhall ſignifie the Horizon, then diuide that circle into
foure equall quarters, by drawing two Diameters croſſing one
another, in the center of the foreſaide circle with right angles,
whereof the perpendicular line is the line of North and South,
and the other croſſing the ſame is the line of Eaſt and Weſt, at
the foure ends of which croſſe Diameters you muſt ſet downe the
foure principall windes, that is, Eaſt, Weſt, North and South,
marking the North part with a flower deluce in the toppe, and
the Eaſt part with a croſſe, as you may ſée in the figure following.
Then diuide euerie quarter of the ſaide circle with your
compaſſes into two equall partes, ſetting downe prickes in
the middeſt of euerie quarter, through which prickes, and alſo
through the center of the circle, draw two other croſſe lines, which
muſt extende ſomewhat beyond the circumference of the Horizon,
which two croſſe lines together with the firſt two croſſe lines
ſhall diuide the circle into 8. partes, and thereby you ſhall haue

                     
                     
the eight principall Windes. That done, diuide euerie eight
parte of the ſaide Horizon into two equall partes by drawing other
two croſſe lines through the center, and extending ſomewhat
beyond the circumference of the Horizon, as before▪ wherby
the whole circle ſhall be diuided into 16. partes, which ſhall ſuffice
without making anie more diuiſions, which woulde cauſe a
confuſion of lines, & at the end of euery one of theſe 16. lines you
muſt drawe a little circle, whoſe center muſt ſtande vpon the circumference
of the Horizon, euerie one whereof muſt bee alſo diuided
into 16. parts by the helpe of 16. lines, diuerſly drawne
from the center of one little circle to another, in ſuch order as the
figure here placed more plainely ſheweth to the eie, than I can
expreſſe the ſame by mouth. And theſe little circles do ſignifie 16
litle Mariners compaſſes, the lines wherof ſignifying the winds,
do ſhew how one place beareth from another, and by what winde
the ſhippe hath to ſaile. But beſides thoſe little circles there is
woont to be drawne alſo another circle ſomewhat greater than the
reſt vpon the verie center of the Horizon, which Circle by reaſon
of the 16. lines that were firſt drawne paſſing through the ſame,
is diuided into 16. parts, and the Mariners doe call this circle
the mother compas.

                     NOw the true ſetting downe of the places in the Mariners
carde, as Points, Capes, Bayes, Floods,
Ilands, and ſuch like is to be done by knowing what
latitude and longitude euery place hath, which is to
be learned either by modern tables made of purpoſe:
for the ancient Tables make no mention of any longitudes or latitudes
of ſuch places as are in the new found land, which land to
them was neuer knowne, or els by ſuch Mariners cardes already

made as doe ſhew the true longitudes and latitudes of thoſe places
which you woulde deſcribe in your Carde, of which longitudes
and latitudes, and eſpecially the longitudes of the places
in the Weſt Indies, few or none are as yet truely ſet down,
                  Moreouer, to knowe the diſtance of places, that is, how many
leagues or miles one place is diſtant from another there is woont
to be ſet downe in the Mariners Carde a ſcale, otherwiſe called
by the Mariners a Tronke, the making wherof is plainly taught
by Martin Cortes in his arte of Nauigation, in the ſecond chapter
of his third booke, and alſo how to graduate the Cardes, to
ſhew what latitude euerie place hath, and there alſo hée teacheth
how to tranſlate one Carde into another, and howe to reduce a
greater Carde into a leſſer, and contrariwiſe. To which booke
I referre you, and the rather for that it is in Engliſh, tranſlated
many yeares ſince out of Spaniſh by M. Richard Eden.
                  
                  But for ſo much as the ſea and the earth doe make together
one whole rounde body, the lines of the 32. rombes in the Carde
being drawne right, and made to ſignifie great circles, can neuer
ſhew the true courſe that the ſhip hath to hold, which Michaell
Cogniet prooueth by a Figure demonſtratiue, and thereof gathereth
thrée concluſions. Firſt, that a man may ſayle right north
and South round about the worlde, if the Sea in all that courſe
be nauigable, and ſo returne againe to the Porte from whence
he firſt departed. Secondlie, that making the Equinoctiall his
Parallell hée may ſayle Eaſt and Weſt round about the worlde,
and ſo returne to the porte from whence hee departed, Alſo
if hée ſayle Eaſt and Weſt in any other Parallell that is diſtant
from the Equinoctiall, hee may returne by the ſame Parallell
to the porte from whence hée firſt departed, and yet not about
the whole worlde, for that cannot be done, but onelie when the
Equinoctiall is his Parallel, Thirdlie, that whoſoeuer ſayleth
by any other rombe than by one of the foure principall, hée
by often changing his Meridian and Horizon muſt needs ſaile
by a line Spirall, which is neither perfectlie right, nor perfectlie
rounde, and thereby hée may well approch the Pole,
and alſo goe rounde about it, but yet with vnequall diſtance,
ſo as he ſhall bee nigher beyonde it than on this ſide, by meanes
whereof hee cannot returne to the place from whence hée came,

as you may plainelie perceiue by this Figure demonſtratiue
here placed.
                  
                  In which Figure the letter A. doeth ſignifie the North
Pole, and the letters B. C.
                      the Meridian paſſing through the
Pole A. then ſuppoſe your ſhip to bée in Q. whereas the Pole
is eleuated 30. degrées. and Q. to be your Zenith, and the right
line G. Q. D to bee your right line of Eaſt and Weſt cutting
the foreſaide Meridian with right angles, and let D. be the
Eaſt point, and E. the Weſt point.
                  Nowe you may ſayle from Q. towardes the North with a
South winde, and from A. you may ſaile againe Southwarde
with a North winde vntill you come to the South Pole, and
from thence you may ſayle againe Northwarde with a South

wind vntill you come againe to Q from whence you firſt departed,
and ſo you ſhall haue gone rounde about the worlde vnder
one ſelfe Meridian B. A. C. But in ſayling Eaſt or Weſt, you
ſhall continuallie change your Meridian, and thereby change
your Eaſt point, for in ſayling from Q. towardes D. you come
immediatelie to the Meridian A. F. whoſe right Eaſt point is
G. and in ſayling further Eaſtward, you come to the Meridian
A. H. whoſe right Eaſt point is I. and ſo foorth from one Meridian
to another, notwithſtanding in kéeping ſtill in one ſelfe parallell
marked with K. L. M. you may ſaile rounde about the
Pole A. which is the center, and ſo come againe to the Port Q.
from whence you firſt departed, but not about the whole worlde:
for that you cannot doe vnleſſe the Equinoctiall were your Parallell,
as hath bene ſaide before, but if you ſayle by any other
rombe than by one of the foure principall, that is, Eaſt, Weſt,
North, or South, your courſe ſhall neither be by right line, nor
yet by true circle, but by a ſpirall line, which is partly right, and
partlie round, ſo as you cannot with like courſe returne to the
place from which you departed, by reaſon that you change ſo often
both Meridian and Horizon, as by the Spirall line Q. N.
O. drawne in this Figure you may eaſilie perceiue, which approcheth
nigher to the Pole beyond it than on this ſide. Moreouer
the ſea men by making the Meridians and parallels in their
cardes all of equall diſtance, they make ſome countries far greater
than they ſhould be by the one halfe. Alſo by that meanes he
that ſayleth Eaſt and Weſt round about the Pole in the Parallell
whoſe latitude is 60. degrées, ſhould make as long a voyage
as hee that ſayleth Eaſt and Weſt alongſt the Equinoctiall, the
voyage whereof is twiſe as long as the other, for the redreſſe and
remedie of which faultes, Cogniet hopeth to finde out ſome more
perfect rule of making cardes when opportunitie of time ſhall
ſerue: in the meane time to reforme the ſaide faults, Mercator
hath in his vniuerſal carde or Mappe made the ſpaces of the Parallels
of latitude to bée wider euerie one than other from the Equinoctiall
towards either of the Poles, by what rule I knowe
not, vnleſſe it be by ſuch a Table, as my friende M. Wright of
Caius colledge in Cambridge at my requeſt ſent me (I thanke
him) not long ſince for that purpoſe, which Table with his conſent,

I haue here plainlie ſet downe together with the vſe thereof
as followeth.
                  
                     The Table followeth on the other ſide

                     THe vſe of this Table for making the ſea Carde
is thus. Ouerthwart the middeſt of the plaine
ſuperficies wherein you would drawe the lineamentes
of the Carde, deſcribe a right line marked
with the letters A. B. C. whereof B. is
the verie middeſt or center, and this line repreſenteth
the Equinoctiall, the ende whereof on the right hand,
marked with the letter C. ſignifieth the Eaſt, and the other end
on the left hand marked with the letter A. ſignifieth the Weſt,
which Equinoctiall line muſt bee diuided into 36. degrées, then
croſſe the ſame ſquirewiſe with perpendicular lines, paſſing
through euerie tenth or fift degrée, as you ſée in the example following.
Then take with your compaſſes the length of halfe the
Equinoctiall, that is, 180. degrées, and ſet one foote of your
Compaſſes in the mutuall interſection of the Equinoctiall, and
of that perpendicular or Meridian which paſſeth through the
Eaſt ende of the Equinoctiall line, marked with the letter C.
and with the other foote make a pricke in the ſame perpendicular
or Meridian, and marke that pricke with the letter D. that
done, diuide the ſpace contayned betwixt this pricke and the Equinoctiall

firſte into thrée equall partes, and euerie one of
thoſe into other thrée equall partes, ſo haue you 9. partes. And
againe, euerie one of thoſe into thrée, ſo haue you twentie ſeuen
partes, and diuide euerie one of thoſe partes into foure partes,
ſo ſhall you haue a hundred and eight partes, and if there bee
ſpace inough, diuide again euerie one of thoſe into ten, ſo ſhal you
haue a 1080. partes, and if it be poſſible, diuide againe euerie
one of thoſe partes into other tenne, ſo ſhall you haue in all
10/800. partes, but this can hardlie be done, vnleſſe the Carde
be verie large, wherein euerie degree of the Equinoctiall is neere
an inch long, which happeneth verie ſeldome, and therefore
1080. partes ſhall ſuffice.
                  And for the eaſier numbring of theſe partes, ſet to them Arithmeticall
figures with blacke leade, which may afterwarde
be put out when your worke is done, beginning at the Equinoctiall
and ſo procéede from thence both Northward and Southwarde,
then looke what number ſtandeth right againſt euerie
degrée in the former Table, which degrées doe extende from 1.
to foureſcore degrées, and omitting alwaies the firſt figure on
the right hande of that number which you finde, for ſo you
muſt alwaies doe when your diuiſion containeth no more but
1080. partes, count that number which remayneth vpon the
line of diuiſion, and there make one pricke, and make another
pricke of the ſame diſtance from the Equinoctiall vpon the outermoſt
Meridian on the left hand, through which two prickes
drawe a right line, and that ſhall be your firſt Parallell of latitude,
and ſo procéede with all the reſt firſt Northwarde, and then
Southward, if you mind to make an vniuerſall Carde. But the
example following containeth no more but the one halfe of an
vniuerſall Carde procéeding from the Equinoctiall line Northwarde
vnto the 80. degrées of latitude: for further Northwarde
than 80. degrées is no land as yet diſcouered or knowne, nor yet
all that, ſo farre as euer I could learne.
               
               
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  The draught of the Meridians and parallels of the Mariners Carde or nauticall Planispheare according to the former Table.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                     IN this laſt figure or Table is firſt drawn (as you ſée)
the Equinoctiall line marked with the letters A. B. C.
and that line is deuided into 360. degrées, and therein
alſo are drawne perpendicular lines, as well thorough
the beginning and ending of the ſayde Equinoctiall lyne,
as alſo through euery tenth degrée thereof, which be the Meridians,
and are euery where equidiſtant each one from other, then
take halfe the length of the Equinoctiall which is A. B. or B. C.
with your Compaſſes and ſetting one foote in the end of the Equinoctiall
marked with C. make with the other foote a pricke at D.
in the Meridian or perpendicular line marked with the letters C.
D. E. then deuide the ſpace contained betwixt C. & D. into 1080.
parts in ſuch ſort as before hath béene ſhewed, and ſet the figures
vnto them as here you ſée, to the intent that you may the more readily
number the parts. Then looke in the firſt Table what number
anſwereth to euery 10. degrée of the Equinoctiall, & caſting away
the firſt figure of that number on the right hand, find out the parts
anſwerable to the number remaining in the line C. D. and at thoſe
parts ſet prickes in both the outermoſt Meridians through which
prickes you ſhall drawe the Parallels. As for example in the firſt
Table you ſée that the number right againſt 10. degrées is 60. (the
firſt figure 3. towardes the right hande being reiected) therefore
looke 60. in the line C. D. and by that part draw the firſt Parallel
diſtant 10. degrées from the Equinoctiall. And after this maner
all the reſt of the Parallels are to be drawne.
                  Many doe vſe to paint the vacant places in their Cardes with
ouer many flags, and the compaſſes thereof with diuerſe and ſuperfluous
colours which William Borne miſliketh, wiſhing that
in ſtead thereof they would ſhewe by letters or other Characters
what moone doth make a full ſea, in ſuch places as are neceſſary
to be knowne, and alſo to drawe the true ſhape and faſhion of euery
Cape or headlande that is néedefull about the coaſt, and at
what point of the compaſſe the land riſeth of this or that faſhion,
for being néere the land it wil ſéeme to be of one faſhion, & being far
off to be of an other faſhion, and to miſtake any place on the ſea is
very dangerous to the Mariner. But aboue al things let him that
ſaileth by Card & Compaſſe be ſure that the néedle of his compaſſe
haue the like declinatiō that his néedle had which made the Card.

For Cogniet reporteth that certaine Mariners being in the weſt
Indies, and ſéeing the North ſtarre to be Northeaſt, maruailed
thereat very much not knowing the cauſe of that error, which indéed
was for that the néedle of their compaſſe was made to decline
Northeaſt, whereas it ſhould rather haue declined Northweſt, for
the Weſt Indies do ſtand Weſternly from the Azores. It is neceſſarie
alſo to ſet downe in the Card ſuch places as are daungerous,
as ſands, flats, or ſhoulds, rockes, and ſuch like things as
are not alwayes to be ſéene with the eye, to the intent that the Mariner
being aduertiſed thereof may ſhunne the ſame. All which
things before mentioned, Wagoner hath in all places contayned
in his booke very well obſerued. Thus hauing ſpoken ſufficiently
of making the Mariners Carde, Now I thinke it good to ſhewe
the moſt neceſſary and chiefeſt vſes thereof.
               
               
                  The chiefeſt vſes of the Mariners Carde.
Chap. 31.
                  
                     THe chiefeſt vſes of the ſea Card are theſe foure here
following:
                  The firſt is to know thereby how that place whereunto
you would ſayle, beareth from the place or Port
from whence you ſet off, or depart. And that is to be knowne by
the lines of the Mariners Compaſſes painted in the Card in this
manner following: Take a paire of Compaſſes and hauing opened
them, ſet the one foote thereof in the very place from whence
you depart, and the other foote in the next line of that Compaſſe
which is neareſt vnto your place of departing, I meane ſuch line
as doth moſt rightly direct you to the place to which you would
go, and your Compaſſe being opened at the fit wideneſſe to ſerue
that line, draw them from the place of your departing vnto the
place whereto you would go, ſuffering that foote of the Compaſſe
which ſtandeth vpon the line of the winde whileſt you draw it forward,
not to ſwerue one iot from that line, and that line will eyther
rightly direct you to the place aſſigned or fall ſhort thereof,
or elſe ouerrech the ſame, if it fall ſhort, then take another line
nearer to the place from which you departed, and if it ouerreach,
take ſome line that is further off from the place of your departing,

and hauing found a line that pointeth directly to the place,
conſider what winde or rombe it is, for by that winde the place
aſſigned beareth from you, and the rombe or winde oppoſite to
that is the winde whereby you haue to ſayle.
                  The ſecond vſe is to knowe by the Carde how farre the place
whereto you go is diſtant from the place of your departing, which
is done by helpe of the ſkale or trunke ſet downe in the Carde
thus: Take the iuſt diſtance betwixt the two places with your
compaſſes by ſetting the one foote in the one place, and the other
foote in the other place, and apply that wideneſſe of the compaſſes
to the ſkale or trunke, and the trunke wil ſhew how many leagues
the one place is diſtant from the other, and if the diſtance betwixt
the places be longer then the trunke, then take firſt the length of
the trunke with your Compaſſes, and looke how many times that
is contained in the ſpace betwixt the two places, and if there doe
remaine any odde meaſure, then hauing taken that odde meaſure
with your compaſſes by ſetting thē at ſuch widenes as is anſwerable
to that odde meaſure, apply that wideneſſe to the firſt part
of the trunke, ſo ſhall you know the iuſt meaſure of the whole. And
this rule ſerueth to take the true diſtance of any other two places
whatſoeuer ſet downe in the Card.
                  The third vſe is to know by the Card what Latitude or altitude
of the Pole any place ſet downe in the Carde hath, which is
done by helpe of the line of degrées of Latitude, otherwiſe called
the Graduation of the Carde in this manner following. Set the
one foote of your compaſſes in the very place whereof you would
know the Latitude, and the other foote in the line of Eaſt & Weſt,
which is next vnto that place, and kéeping that foote ſtill vpon that
line, draw your compaſſes forward vntill you come to the line of
degrées, and marke what degrée of the ſaid line the foot of the compaſſe
which was firſt ſet in the place doth croſſe or touch, for that
is the degrée of Latitude for that place, numbring from the loweſt
degrée of Graduation vpwarde, ſo ſhall you finde the Latitude of
Lisbone in Portingale by Mercator his vniuerſall Carde, and
by the Carde ſet downe in Martin Cortes booke, and alſo by Medina
his Carde drawne in his booke of Nauigation to be 38. degrées
30. minutes and ſomewhat more. But by the Tables of
Ptolomie you ſhall finde it to be 40. degrées 24. minutes, and

by Appian his Tables to be 39. degrées and 38. minutes.
                  The fourth vſe chanceth when you are driuen out of your right
courſe by ſtormes or tempeſt, which ſtormes how to foreſée and to
prognoſticate, is plainely taught by Martin Cortes in the 19.
Chap. of his ſecond booke. Alſo you may be driuen by force of contrary
windes, by ſurging of the ſea, or by ouerthwart tides, currants,
& ſuch like impediments, ſo as you can not lay your courſe
right to the place aſſigned, for remedy whereof you muſt ſéeke in
what place you are, & to note the ſame in your Card which as the
Mariners terme it, is to make a pricke in the Carde, which to doe
truely in time of néede many things are to be known & well obſerued
and kept in memorie. Firſt to know what latitude the place
from whence you firſt departed hath, then to kéepe in minde what
way your ſhippe did make good at euery ſhift of winde, that is to
ſay, how many leagues, and in how long time you ſayled by euery
ſeuerall winde: and then not knowing well where you are, nor
how farre you are diſtant from the place whereto you would go,
learne to knowe by helpe of your Aſtrolabe or croſſe ſtaffe, in
ſuch ſort as is before taught, the altitude of the Pole in that
place where you are, which if you finde to be all one with the Latitude
of the place of your departure, then you may aſſure
your ſelfe that you haue ſayled by the line of Eaſt and Weſt without
altering your Latitude, but if you finde the Latitude of the
place where you are, to be more or leſſe then the Latitude of the
place from whence you departed, then reſort to your Card, and
take two payre of Compaſſes opened at ſuch widenes as the one
foote of the one Compaſſe may ſtand in the place from which you
departed, and the other foote of the ſame Compaſſe to ſtand in the
line of the rombe whereby you ſayled: and let the one foote of the
other Compaſſe ſtand in that degrée of Latitude which you laſt
found, and the other foote of the ſame Compaſſe in the next line of
Eaſt & Weſt, and holding the Compaſſes ſo ordered in ech hande
one paire: draw them both ſo as they may méete together, taking
good héede in drawing them, that the foote of that compaſſe which
was placed in the line of the winde, may at no time ſwarue from
that line, nor the one foote of the other Compaſſe to ſwarue
from the line of Eaſt and Weſt, wherein it was firſt placed,
and whereas the two féete of thoſe Compaſſes doe méete,

that is to ſay, that foote of the one compaſſe which was drawne
from the place of your departing doe méete with that foote of the
other compaſſe which came from the degrée of Latitude laſt found,
where theſe two féete (I ſay) doe méete, there make a pricke or
marke in your Carde, for that is the place where you ſhippe is at
that inſtant: And from thence you muſt take your right courſe againe
to the place whereunto you would go. But becauſe it is neceſſarie
aſwell at this time as at all other times, to knowe what
way your ſhippe hath made, and that the ſame is not in mine opinion,
ſo plainely nor ſo commodiouſly taught by any one that I
haue read, as by Michaell Cogniet, I minde therfore in the two
chapters next following to ſet downe his way not only how to find
out the way of your ſhippe when you ſaile South and North vnder
one ſelfe Meridian, or in any other place where you are to
change in your gate the latitude or altitude of the Pole, but alſo
how to finde out the way of your ſhippe in ſayling right Eaſt and
Weſt, without changing the altitude of the Pole, which way as
he ſayth, was neuer heretofore knowne to any Pylot but to him
ſelfe firſt author and inuentor thereof.
               
               
                  How to know the way of your ſhip, and how many leagues
are to be counted for one degree of Latitude in euerie Rombe
whereby you ſayle.
Chap. 32.
                  
                     FIrſt you haue to vnderſtande that in ſaylinge
iuſt North and South, you do alwayes abide vnder
one ſelfe great Circle called the Meridian,
vnder the which, when you haue ſayled ſo farre as
the altitude of the Pole is changed one degrée,
then haue you gone 17. Spaniſh leagues, and a
halfe, and you haue to note that euery Spaniſh league containeth
2857. fathams, and that our Engliſh league containeth no more
but 2500. fathams, ſo as the Spaniſh league is more then our
Engliſh league by 357. fathams, & euery fatham containeth vi.
foote. Againe in ſayling Eaſt and Weſt, you do alwayes remaine
vnder one ſelfe Parallell, by meanes whereof the altitude of the

Pole doth neuer alter, and therefore no true account can be made
of the leagues, but by ſuch meanes as Cogniet teacheth in the
Chapter following. But if in ſayling North and South, you decline
one rombe either towards the Eaſt or Weſt, and go ſo farre
as the altitude of the Pole is changed by one degrée, then you
haue made ſomewhat more then 17. Spaniſh leagues and a halfe,
and to be ſhort, the more rombes that you decline towardes the
Eaſt or Weſt, the more leagues in number doe belong to one degrée
of altitude, as you may plainely ſée by this figure demonſtratiue
here following in which the letter A. ſignifieth the place or
point in the Card, from which you depart ſituated in the Parallel
A. B.
                     
                  
                  Then ſuppoſe C. D. to be another Parallell equally diſtant
from A. B. by one degrée of altitude. Now if you ſaile right Eaſt
or Weſt, then you ſhall alwayes remaine in the Parallel A. B.
equally diſtant from the Pole. But if you ſaile from A. right
North ſo farre as the altitude of the Pole is augmented one degrée,
then your ſhip ſhal be in C. and if you ſayle by the firſt rombe
towardes the Eaſt ſo farre as the Pole doth altar in altitude one
degrée, then your ſhippe ſhall be in E. and thereby your way muſt
néedes, be longer, and ſo conſequently the more rombes you decline
from North to Eaſt, the longer is your way, and the more
leagues muſt be accounted to one degrée of altitude, as the lines
drawne from A. to E. F. G. H. I. K. and D. do ſhew. And what
ſame euer is ſaide here of the quarter from North to Eaſt, the
ſame is to be vnderſtoode in all the other thrée quarters, that is,
from North to Weſt, from South to Eaſt, and from South to
Weſt. But if you will knowe how many leagues doe belong to

euery degrée according to the rombe whereby you ſayle, then conſider
well this Table here following.

                  For in ſayling from North or
South towardes Eaſt or Weſt
ſo farre as you come to change one
degrée of altitude of the Pole, the
ſaide degrée doth require for the
firſt rombe, &c.
                  Now then to know how much way you haue made in ſayling,
you muſt firſt know aſwell the Latitude of the place from which
you departed as of that place whereunto you be arriued: then by
the foreſaid Table ſéeke to knowe how many leagues doe belong
to a degrée of that rombe whereby you haue ſayled, for in multiplying
the number of the leagues by the degrées of the difference
of the two Latitudes, the product thereof will ſhew you how many
leagues you haue ſayled, notwithſtanding ſith the way may be
made longer or ſhorter by changing or ſhifting of the winde, it is
néedefull that the Pylot haue conſideration thereof, who by ſkilfull
coniecture muſt ſometime eyther adde to, or take fro according
as néede ſhall require. Moreouer by the foreſaid figure marked
with letters, you may alſo eaſily vnderſtande how much you
change in Longitude, that is to ſay, how much you are diſtant
from the Meridian of that place from whence you departed, be it
eyther towardes the Eaſt or Weſt, for he that ſayleth from the
point A. as is aforeſaid right North or South, he remaineth alwayes
vnder one ſelfe Meridian: but he that ſayleth by the firſt
rombe towards the Eaſt or Weſt ſo farre as he changeth one degrée
of Altitude, and arriueth to the point E. is now diſtant from
his firſt Meridian ſo much as is the ſpace betwixt C. and E. which
we finde by computation to be thrée leagues and a halfe for one

one degrée of altitude of the
Pole you change alſo your Meridian,
and thereby your Longitude,
the quantitie whereof
anſwerable to euery rombe, is
ſet downe on the right ſide of
this Table.
                  And to make this more plaine by example ſuppoſe that you
ſayle from Lisbone, which is a famous port in Portingale, by the
winde Southweſt and by weſt, which is the fift rombe from ſouth
to Weſt, ſo farre as you finde the altitude of the Pole to be 18.
degrées leſſe then at Lisbone. Now if you would know how many
leagues you haue ſayled, and alſo how much the Meridian of
that place is more weſtward then the Meridian of Lisbone, then
doe thus. Looke in the firſt Table, and you ſhall finde that to one
degrée of the fift Rombe doe belong 31. leagues and a halfe,
which leagues being multiplyed by 18. doe make in all 582.
leagues and ¾. which you haue ſayled. then looke in the ſecond
Table, and you ſhall finde for the fifth rombe one degrée and 30.
minutes of Longitude, which being multiplyed by 18. and a halfe,
do make 27. degrées and ¾. of a degrée, for by ſo much is Lisbone
more Eaſtward, then the place where you are. And whereas the
firſt Table is made according to the proportion of right lines
ſuch as are commonly drawne in Mariners Cardes, Cogniet
maketh another Table according to the proportion of circular
lines, which for that it differeth very little or nothing from the
firſt Table, I omit here to ſet it downe. But now becauſe the
firſt Table doth chiefely ſerue thoſe that fayle either Eaſt or Weſt
in any Parallell betwixt the Equinoctiall and the 60. degrée of
Latitude or Altitude of the Pole: And that from thence foorth by
reaſon that they ſayle by more oblique and ſpirall Circles doe
make the longer voyage, Cogniet thought good to adde a thirde
Table ſhewing how many leagues be anſwerable to one degrée
of altitude to thoſe that ſayle eyther Eaſt or Weſt in any Parallell

that is betwixt the Pole and the 60. degrée of altitude, which
Table differeth not much from the others in the foure firſt rombs,
but in the thrée laſt, that is in the 5. 6. and ſeuenth rombe it differeth
greatly, and moſt in the ſeuenth as you may eaſily perceiue
by comparing this and the firſt Table together.

Chap. 33.
                  
                     IN ſayling ritht Eaſt or Weſt, you continue ſtill
in one ſelfe Parallel without making any charge
of Latitude of the Pole. Moſt men therefore
thinke it impoſſible for you to make any true account
of the leagues but onely by coniecture, for
remedie whereof Cogniet hath inuented a rule
moſt certaine, as he ſaith, the foundation whereof is thus: Firſt
you muſt ſuppoſe the Meridian of that place from whence you
depart to be a firme and fixed point, and to be the very beginning
of the Parallell wherein you ſayle, then you muſt knowe what
houre it is aſwell at the place from whence you firſt departed, as
alſo at the place whereunto you are arriued, and hauing the difference
of the houres, you muſt knowe howe many leagues euery
houre yéeldeth, according to the Parallell of that altitude of the

Pole vnder which you ſayle, ſo ſhall you eaſily knowe how manie
leagues you haue ſayled. This foundation being firſt laide, Cogniet
ſetteth downe his generall rule in this manner following:
When ſoeuer you haue to ſayle (ſayth he) right Eaſt or Weſt,
you muſt firſt prouide your ſelfe of theſe two thinges, the one is
of an Aſtronomicall ring that may iuſtly ſhew the houre at anie
time: In ſtéede whereof I thinke it better to haue an vniuerſall
Dyall, ſuch a one as is deſcribed by William Borne in the one
and twentieth Chapter of his Regiment: the other thing is to
haue a true houre glaſſe that will run continually foure and twentie
houres, and therefore had néede to be thrée times more long
and large then common houre glaſſes be, whereof the glaſſe makers
can quickly prouide you, and becauſe the ſhip leaneth ſometime
on the one ſide, and ſometime on the other, it ſhall be néedefull
to hange the ſaide houre-glaſſe with rings of braſſe or latten,
to the intent that it may alwayes hange leuell like as the Mariners
Compaſſes are wont to be hanged in their boxes. Now being
thus prouided of theſe two inſtruments, you muſt at your departing
prepare your houre glaſſe, that is to ſay, you muſt ſet it a
running iuſt at noone when the ſunne is right South, not forgetting
to turne it in your voyage once a day in the very inſtant that
it is readie to runne out. Then hauing ſayled certaine daies, and
being arriued at the place where you would knowe what way you
haue made, looke to your houre-glaſſe, and tarry vntill it be full
runne out, at which inſtant ſéeke to know what houre it is by your
Aſtronomicall ringe, or rather by the vniuerſall Dyall, for if you
ſayle Eaſt, you ſhall find it to be paſt noone, but if you ſayle Weſt,
then it will want of noone, and kéepe thoſe houres in minde that
you may know how much it is more or leſſe then noone, for thoſe
houres by ſhewing the difference of the houres that are betwixt
the Meridian of the place from whence you departed, and the
Meridian of the place whereto you are arriued, will certifie you
with the helpe of this Table here following, what quantitie of
way your ſhippe hath made.

you ſhall finde the nūber of leagues incident to that degrée: which
number of leagues, if you multiply by the number of houres before
found, the product thereof will ſhew you how many leagues
you haue ſailed. And if there be any minutes annexed to the hours,
then multiply alſo the number of the foreſaid leagues found in the
Table, by thoſe minutes, and deuide the product therof by 60. and
the quotient ſhall be leagues, which you muſt adde to the former
leagues, and the ſumme thereof will ſhew how many leagues you
haue in all ſayled.

one of the Iles of the Azores called S. Mary, and there hauing
tarried vntill your houre-glaſſe be cleane run out, and ſéeking to
know at that inſtant by your Aſtronomicall ring, or by ſome vniuerſall
Dyall what houre it is, you finde that it is a 11. of the
clocke and 10. minutes paſt, which wanteth 50. minutes of iuſt
noone, and that is the difference betwixt the two Meridians, that
is to ſay, the Meridian of Cape S. Vincent, and the Meridian of
the Ile S. Mary, both which places being in one ſelfe Parallell
muſt néedes haue one ſelfe Latitude or Altitude, which is 37. degrées,
which altitude being found in the Table in the ſecond collum
on the left hande, you finde there alſo hard by it on the right
hand, 209. leagues and ¾. of a league, for euery houre of that
Parallell, which number of leagues, if you multiply by the foreſaid
50. minutes, the product ſhalbe 10/487. ½ which if you deuide
by 60. you ſhall finde in the quotient 174. leagues and 19/
                        •
                     4.
parts of a league, which is the iuſt quantitie of your whole
voyage.
               
               
                  
                  Another example of counting the way of your ſhippe in
ſayling right Eaſt.
Chap. 36.
                  
                     SVppoſe then that you haue to ſayle from the newe
found lande right Eaſt in the Parallel of 50. degrées:
and hauing cauſed your houre glaſſe to begin to run
iuſt at noone, you ſet foorth and ſayle the ſpace of 15.
dayes, not forgetting euery day once to turne your houre glaſſe.
Now if at the 15. dayes end, you would know how many leagues
you haue ſayled, to finde in your Card in what place you are, you
muſt firſt tarrie vntill your houre-glaſſe be cleane runne out, and
at that inſtant ſéeke by your Aſtronomicall ring, or by ſome vniuerſall
Dyall, to know what houre it is, which becauſe you haue
ſayled right Eaſt, you finde to be two houres and twelue minutes
afternoone, then reſorting to the Table aforeſaide, you finde in
the third colum the 50. degrées of altitude, together with the number
168. leagues and a halfe, annexed to the ſaide degrée for one
houre of that Parallell, which ſumme being multiplyed by two
houres, maketh 337. leagues, then multiply once againe 168.
by the odde 12′· and deuide the product thereof by 60. ſo ſhal you
find in the quotient 33. leagues and ſomewhat more, which being
added to the former ſumme 337. leagues will make in all 370.
leagues and a little more, and that is the true quantitie of your
voyage. And Cogniet ſayth that by practizing this way of counting,
you may know euery day, yea euery houre, what way your
ſhippe maketh in ſayling right Eaſt or Weſt.
               
               
                  To knowe how much you goe out of your way in ſayling
by one wrong rombe or by more.
Chap. 37.
                  
                     IF in ſayling to any place you direct your courſe
eyther too high or too lowe by one rombe you looſe in
euery 100. leagues 19. leagues and ⅗. of a league,
ſo as you go out of your way almoſt the fift part of
your voyage. And if by two rombes, then in euery
hundred leagues you looſe 39. leagues, that is to ſay you go ſo far

out of the right way: And if you fal thrée rombes out of your right
courſe, then in euery hundred leagues you looſe 58. leagues: and
if you fall foure rombes, then you looſe in euery hundred leagues
76. leagues, and the more rombes that you miſtake in your direction,
the more you wander out of your right courſe. Thus much
touching the Mariners compaſſe and his Carde: nowe wee will
ſpeake of the North ſtarre, and of his guardes, and then of the
ſunne and of the Moone, and ſo ende.
               
               
                  Of the North ſtarre, otherwiſe called the loadſtarre, and of
his guardes, and how to know the ſame.
Chap. 38.
                  
                     THough euery Mariner knoweth the North ſtar
ſo ſoone as he ſéeth it in the firmament, becauſe it
is his chiefe guide to direct thereby his ſhippe in
the night ſeaſon in all the North partes of the
world: yet euery man that is no ſayler knoweth
him not, and therefore minding here to treate
thereof, I thinke it not amiſſe firſt to teach him how to knowe it,
and in what part of the heauen it is placed, and how farre it is diſtant
from the North Pole.
                  The Poets do faigne that of the 48. Images of the fixed ſtars
that be in the heauen, which are otherwiſe called Conſtellations,
there be two Beares hauing tayles, whereof the one is called the
great Beare, and the other the little Beare, in euery of which are
ſeuen principall ſtars: And that bright ſtarre which is in the very
tippe of the little Beares tayle, is commonly called of our Engliſh
Mariners the Loadſtar, of the Latines Stella polaris, of the
Gréekes Cinoſura, and of the Arabians Alrucuba. But to know
this ſtar, you muſt firſt find out the ſeuen ſtars of the great Beare
by looking towards the North part of the firmamēt, of which ſtars
foure being placed in his bodie, do make (as it were) a 4. ſquare,
and the other thrée ſtars being placed in his tayle, which is ſomewhat
riſing in the midſt, doe repreſent the portion of a Circle, the
little Beare hath alſo the like ſhape ſauing that her féete & belly do
turne vpwards, ſo as the tippe of her taile is anſwerable to the two
hindermoſt ſtarres of the great Beare, as you may ſée in theſe figures
following.
                  
                     
                     
                  
                  Some do call
the great beare
great Charles
Waine or Wagon,
and the little
Beare little
Charles wain,
becauſe in each
figure the foure
ſquare ſtars do
ſignifie the four
whéeles, & the
other thrée ſtars
the 3. horſes:
Nowe to finde
out the Loadſtarre,
imagine
a right line to paſſe thorough the two hindermoſt ſtarres otherwiſe
called the guardes or pointers of the great Beare, as you ſée
here in this figure, and that line will rightly direct your eye to the
Loadſtarre which ſtandeth in the tippe of the little Beares taile,
for there is no bright ſtar that can be ſéene betwixt the two gards
of the great Beare and the Loadſtarre. Notwithſtanding ſome
do affirme that there is another ſtarre nigher vnto the Pole then
the foreſaide Loadſtarre, and that ſtar is as they ſay no more but
50. minutes diſtant from the Pole: I haue heard that there is a
Prieſt and Aſtrologer with the King of Demnarke, who is woont
to finde out this ſtarre by the helpe of an inſtrument whereby hee
getteth firſt the ſight of ſixe other ſtars at one inſtant, which way
I feare mee is more troubleſome then profitable, and if there
were any ſuch ſtarre indéede, and therewith ſo néedefull and
méete to bee vſed as is the Loadſtarre, I doubt not but that
ſome of our learned Pilots would haue found it out, and alſo
haue had ſome vſe thereof long ere this time: But leauing this
matter, I will returne to the deſcription of our Mariners common
Loadſtarre, and ſhew of what bigneſſe it is: alſo what Longitude,
Latitude, declination, and motion it hath, and finally the
chiefeſt and moſt neceſſarie vſes thereof.
                  
                     
This ſtarre according to the prutenicall Tables is of the
third bigneſſe, and hath in Longitude 53. degrées 30. minutes,
counting from the firſt ſtarre of the Rams horne, whoſe place in
theſe our dayes is in the 27. degrée 30. minutes of Aries, and by
this meanes the place or Longitude of the Loadſtarre is in the
21. degrée of Gemini, & his Latitude, counting from the Ecliptique
line towardes the North Pole of the Zodiaque is 66. degrées
0. minutes, and his declination counting from the Equinoctiall
towardes the North pole of the worlde is 86. ſo as he is
in theſe dayes diſtant from the North pole 4. degrées, ſome ſay
4. degrées and 9. minutes, but Cogniet ſayth, that he is diſtant
from the pole but 3. degrées and a halfe, who findeth by the Aſtronomicall
Tables that this ſtarre at the birth of Chriſt was 12. degrées
36. minutes diſtant from the Pole, and euer ſince hath gone
decreaſing, and ſhall decreaſe euery day more then other, vntill
it come to be but 26. minutes diſtant from the Pole, which is as
nigh as it can approch to the Pole, for then his diſtance ſhall beginne
againe to encreaſe. This ſtarre maketh his daily reuolution
from Eaſt to Weſt in 24. houres, as all other ſtarres doe by
vertue of the firſt mooueable, but his circuit is ſo ſmall, and his
gate ſo ſlow, as in the ſpace of 24. houres he goeth not much more
then 24. degrées of the Equinoctiall, and in his turning round
about he maketh as it were a little Circle, in the middeſt whereof
is the North pole it ſelfe, which is inuiſible & can not be ſéene.
                  And though the image or conſtellation of the little Beare containeth
many ſtars, yet the ſeuen before mentioned and ſet foorth
in figure are moſt obſerued, of which ſeuen ſtarres in the little
beare, two ſtars called the gards of the North ſtar are to the Mariners
moſt familiar, for diuers reſpects hereafter declared. And of
thoſe gards the one is Northerne & the other Southern, and both
are ſaid to be of the ſecond bigneſſe, & yet the Southerne gard ſéemeth
to the eye both leſſer and darker then the other. Of which two
ſtars I thinke it not amiſſe to ſet downe here the Longitude, Latitude,
and declination as I haue done before of the Loadſtarre.
                  The Longitude of the South garde is 100. degrées 30. minutes,
whereby his place is in the ninth degrée of Leo. And his latitude
is 72. degrées 40. minutes, and his declination is 73. degrées,
ſo as he is diſtant from the North pole 17. degrées.
                  
                     
The longitude of the North guard is 109. degrées, 30. minutes,
ſo as his place is in the 20. degrée of Leo, and his latitude
is 74. degrées, 50, minutes, and his declination is 76. degrées,
ſo as his diſtance from the North Pole is 14. degrees.
Thus hauing ſhewed the greatneſſe, the longitude, the true
place, the latitude, and the declination aſwell of the Lodeſtarre,
as of his two guardes, I thinke good now to ſet downe the chiefeſt
vſes that ſea men haue of them.
               
               
                  The vſes of the North ſtarre, and of his guardes.
Chapter. 39.
                  
                     THe firſt vſe is to knowe thereby the variation of
the Mariners Compaſſe.
                  The ſecond is to know by his guardes when
the North ſtarre is aboue or beneath the Pole.
                  The third is to know by the North ſtarre and
his guardes with the help of an inſtrument called
a Nocturlabe the houre of the night.
                  The fourth is to know the eleuation of the Pole. And you haue
to note that the North ſtarre and his guardes are alwayes aboue
our Horizon, and doe neuer goe downe in any place whereas the
North Pole hath any eleuation, be it neuer ſo little. But beſides
theſe ſtarres there be alſo in this our latitude diuers other images
of ſtarres that are alwayes aboue our Horizon, and doe neuer go
downe, as the Dragon, the great Beare, the image of Cepheus,
of Caſsiopeia, the image of Auriga, hauing the Goat at his back
which is a faire bright ſtarre of the firſt bigneſſe and many others,
which I leaue to name, becauſe I haue heretofore deſcribed them
all at large in my treatiſe of the Globes, by which ſtarres by reaſon
that with vs they neuer goe downe, the latitude of any place
and alſo the houre of the night may bee knowne ſo well as by the
Lodeſtarre.
                  But now as touching thē vſes of the foreſaide ſtarres before
mentioned, the firſt whereof ſhewing how to find out by the Lodeſtarre
the variation of the Compaſſe, is taught before in the 25.
Chapter, according to William Boorne his rule ſet downe in his

Regiment, and as for the other thrée vſes they are plainly taught
in the two chapters next following.
               
               
                  To knowe by helpe of a little Table made according to the
Mariners rule touching the 8. principall rombes, ſhewing how
and when the Lodeſtarre is either aboue or beneath the Pole,
that you may knowe thereby the true altitude of the Pole
in taking the height of the Lodeſtarre with your Aſtrolabe or
croſſe ſtaffe. chap. 40.
Chapter 40.
                  
                     TO know this you muſt alwayes haue due conſideration
of the two guards of the little Beare, for when
thoſe guards are iuſt Southweſt from the Lodeſtarre,
then is the Lodeſtarre at his higheſt in the
verie Meridian, and therefore it is right aboue the
Pole, and when thoſe guards be iuſt Northeaſt from the Lodeſtar
then the Lodeſtarre is againe in the Meridian at his loweſt, and
thereby right vnder the Pole, and in both places his diſtance from
the Pole is but thrée degrées and a halfe, as Cogniet ſaith, according
to which account he ſetteth downe this Table following.
                  This Table is diuided into two collums, whereof that on the
left hand contayneth the eight principall rombes or windes, and
that on the right hand contayneth the degrées and minutes of diſtance
of the Lodeſtarre from the Pole, being either aboue or beneath
the Pole.
                  
                     
                        
                           If the
guards be
                           The rombes
or windes.
                            
                           The degrees and minutes of
the declination of the Lodeſtarre
from the Pole.
                        
                        
                           
                              
                                 Weſt.
                                 Southweſt
                                 South
                                 Southeaſt.
                              
                           
                           Then the
Lodeſtar
is
                           
                              
                                 1 ½

                                 3 0
                                 1 0
                              Aboue the
Pole.
                        
                        
                           
                              
                                 Eaſt
                                 Northeaſt
                                 North
                                 Northweſt
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 1 ½
                                 3 ½
                                 3 0
                                 1 0
                              Beneath the
Pole.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
This table differeth in one point from the Mariners common
rule ſet downe as well by Medina, and by Martin Cortes, as alſo
by William Boorne touching the guards, for they all appoint but
halfe a degrée of declination of the North ſtarre from the Pole, the
guardes being either in the rombe Southeaſt, or Northweſt, to
both which rombes Cogniet appointeth one whole degreé of declination.
The vſe of which table in ſeeking to know, the eleuation
of the Pole is thus. Firſt, hauing taken with your Aſtrolabe
the altitude of the Lodeſtarre aboue your Horizon, obſerue immediatelie
in which of the 8. former rombes his guardes be. For if
they be in any of the 4. vpper rombes of the Table, then you muſt
ſubtract from the height of the Lodeſtarre taken with your Aſtrolabe,
ſo much as is ſet downe for that rombe in the collum on the
right hand of the ſaid table, and the remainder ſhall be the true altitude
of the Pole, but if the guardes bee in any of the foure nether
rombes, then you muſt adde ſo much to 
                        〈◊〉
                      height of the Lodeſtar,
and the ſumme thereof ſhall be the altitude of the Pole. But becauſe
this table ſerueth only for the 8. principall winds and for no
more. Cogniet therefore ſetteth downe the making of a twofolde
inſtrument, whereby you ſhall not onely know (as he ſaith) how
much the Lodeſtarre is aboue or beneath the Pole in euery other
rombe as wel as in the 8. principall rombes, but alſo you ſhall
know therby the true houre of the night more exactlie than the
Nocturlabe of Munſter or Appian doth ſhew.

rombes, which are only contained in the former Table, and
alſo the true houre of the night, the ſhape whereof followeth.

                        COgniet calleth this inſtrument Rectificatorium Stellae
Polaris, that is to ſay, the Rectifier of the North
ſtarre, ioyning thereunto a Nocturlabe differing nothing
at all from the Nocturlabe of Munſter and of
others, but onelie in placing the 21. of October in ſtead of the
28. of the ſame moneth vppon the line of North and South towards
the handle of the inſtrument for ſuch cauſe as is hereafter
declared.
                  The making of the rectifier of the Lodeſtarre, is thus: Vpon
a ſmooth peece of boord of firme wood, or vpon a péece of poliſhed
plate of braſſe or Latten being ſixe or ſeuen inches broade,
hauing a handle, as you ſée in the former figure, draw a circle diuided
into 4. quarters by help of two croſſe Diameters cutting one
another in the center with right angles, the perpendicular whereof
ſhall ſignifie the Meridian line, that is to ſay, the line of North
and South, at whoſe vpper end ſet North, and at the nether end
South, and the other ouerthwart Diameter ſhall bee the line of
Eaſt and Weſt, hauing Eaſt marked on the right hand and Weſt
on the left hand, and in euerie quarter of the foreſaide circle you
may if you will place the like rombes that are in the Flie of the
Mariners Compaſſe, as you may ſée done in the foreſaid figure.
Moreouer, you muſt diuide the vpper quarter on the left hand into
thrée equall partes, and hauing taken two of thoſe partes with
your Compaſſes, meaſuring from the North point downe toward
the Weſt, and there make a pricke, marking the ſame with
a little blacke croſſe, and from that croſſe drawe a right line that
may paſſe through the Center vnto the circumference of the Circle,
and there make another little blacke croſſe, and this line ſhal
diuide the circle into two equall partes, which line if you croſſe
with another right line paſſing through the center, and making
thereby right angles, you ſhall diuide the circle into other foure
quarters differing from the firſt foure quarters, though not in
quantitie, yet in place, of which foure laſt quarters you muſt diuide
that which is on the left hand into 90. equall degrées, beginning
your account at the little blacke croſſe on the left hand, and ſo
procéede downward towards the South point of the circle.
                  Now to know how much the North ſtar in euery rombe mounteth
or deſcendeth and how to place the ſame vpon the inſtrument

ſo as you may knowe how much to ad to the altitude of the Lodeſtarre,
or to ſubtract from the ſame, you muſt vſe this Table
following, which Table conſiſteth

                        
                           The degrees and minutes of the de

of two collums, whereof
that on the left hand containeth
the degrées and minutes of the
declination of the Lodeſtarre,
procéeding from one quarter of
a degrée to another, vntill you
come to 3. deg. and a half, which
is (as Cogniet ſaith) the greateſt
declination of the Lodeſtar,
from the Pole: and the other
collum on the right hande containeth
the degrées and minutes
of a quarter or quadrant, diuided
by diuers and ſundrie proportions
of numbers into 90.
degrées which proportional degrées
and minutes are to bee
reckoned in the firſt quadrant
diuided into 90 equal degrées, &
next deſcending from the firſt
croſſe on the left hande thus.
Firſt, beginning at the ſaid croſſe, and deſcending downwarde,
tell out 4. degrées, and 6. minutes, & right againſt that ſet downe
¼. then tell in the ſame quadrant from the ſaide croſſe 8. degrées,
and 13. minutes, and right againſt that ſet downe ½ and ſo procéede
according as the Table directeth you, vntill you come to
90. againſt which you muſt ſet down 3. deg. & ½ And as this quarter
is diuided, ſo you may deale with the other 3. quarters, and in
each of the 2 quarters which are beneath the 2 croſſes forget not
to write this word Subtract, and in each of the 2. quarters aboue
the 2. croſſes write this word Ad, as you ſée in the former figure,
Then ther ſhal want nothing but only a ruler or index, which muſt
be faſtened to the center of the inſtrument, ſo as it may be turned
round about a pinne hauing a round hole in it, through which you
may ſée the Lodeſtar, and alſo at the ſame inſtant by lifting vp and

downe the index you may ſée on the outſide of the inſtrument the
foreguard of the ſaid ſtar appearing euen with the right edge of
the index called Linea fiduciae, or the fiducial line, drawn from the
center of the inſtrument alongſt the inward edge of the index, and
ſo is the inſtrument for that purpoſe fully perfected. But if you
wold ad therunto a nocturlabe, then you muſt draw vpon the center
therof diuers circles next to the ſpace cōtaining the winds: and the
ſpaces betwixt thoſe circles muſt be ſome wider, & ſome narrower
For the firſt vpper ſpace muſt be narrow, containing the daies of
euery moneth, and the next ſpace ſomewhat wider, containing the
number of thoſe daies ſet down in Arithmeticall figures, and the
third ſpace wider than that, containing the names of the moneths
then next to the loweſt circle of the nethermoſt ſpace place a little
rundle faſtened to the inſtrument with the foreſaid hoſlow pin, ſo
as it may turne round about the ſawe. And this rundle muſt be diuided
into 24. hours, that is to ſay, 12 for the day, & 12. for ye night,
which rundle would be made with téeth wherof one muſt be longer
than al his fellowes ſignifying alwaies ye 12. houre of the night,
which is alwaies to be laide vpon the day of the moneth wherein
you ſéeke to know the houre of the night. And remember in diſtributing
the dayes of the moneth, that you alwayes ſet the 21 day
of October beneath towards the handle in the verie line of North
and South paſſing right through the middeſt of the handle, ſo ſhal
the inſtrument ſhew the houre of the night more trulie than when
the 28. day of October ſtandeth beneath vpon the line of South
and North, as it doth in the common Nocturlabes, the makers
whereof had reſpect to the Pole it ſelfe which is inuiſible, and not
to the North ſtarre which is apparant to the eie, by meanes wherof
the guards of the Lodeſtarre ſometime doe ſhew ſooner or latter
by 7. degrées and 18. minutes, if you count from the Pole,
which is almoſt halfe an houre difference, and for that cauſe alſo
Cogniet maketh his account in his foreſaid rectifier to begin
at the little blacke croſſe, ſeuen degrées more forwarde than it
ought to doe, if he ſhould count from the Pole, and not from the
North ſtarre.
               
               
                  
                  How to know by the foreſaid twofold inſtrument as wel the
mounting and deſcending of the North ſtar as the true houre
of the night both at one inſtant and alſo the elevation of the
Pole,
Chapter 42.
                  
                     FIrſt then hauing layed and ſtayed the great tooth
of the moouable rundle marked with 12. vppon
the day of the moneth wherein you ſéeke, and holding
the inſtrument by the handle with your one
hand right before your face, leaue not to put that
hand forward from you, or to bring it backwards towards you,
vntill you may ſée with the one eie, winking with the other, the
North ſtarre through the hole of the pin, which is in the center of
the Inſtrument: and ſo ſoone as you ſée the North ſtar, lift with
your other hand the index vp and downe vntill you ſée alſo at that
inſtant the North guard of the Lodeſtarre on the outſide of the inſtrument
appearing euen with the fiduciall line or inwarde edge
of the ſaid index. Then ſtaying the index there, looke vpon what
houre it falleth, for that ſhall be the houre of the night. And look
alſo at that inſtant vpon what degrée of diſtance it falleth in the
outermoſt border of the inſtrument wherein thoſe degrées are ſet
downe together with theſe wordes adde and ſubtract. For from
the point marked with a little blacke croſſe nigh vnto the Northweſt
deſcending through the nether moyetie or halfe deale of the
inſtrument vntill you come to the other blacke croſſe, placed nigh
vnto the Southeaſt, the North ſtarre is alwaies aboue the Pole
ſo much as the index ſheweth, which you muſt alwaies ſubtract
from the height of the North ſtarre to knowe the eleuation of
the Pole, hauing firſt taken with your Aſtrolabe the height of
the North ſtarre. But if the index doe fall vppon any degrée or
part of a degrée in the vpper moyetie or halfe deale of the inſtrument
then to know the eleuation of the Pole, you muſt adde ſo
much as the index ſheweth vnto the altitude of the Lodeſtarre, as
the words Adde and Subtract written in the outermoſt border
of the inſtrument doe plainely ſhew.
                  But now if you would know at any houre of the day or night,

in what rombe the foreſaid guardes be without ſéeing them and
alſo how much the Lodeſtarre is declined from the Pole, you
néede doe no more but to lay the great tooth of the mooueable
rundle vppon the day of the moneth, and then to bring the index
vnto the houre which you require, and the ſaid index will ſhewe
in the border of the inſtrument in what rombe the guardes be, and
how much the North ſtarre is aboue or beneath the Pole.
                  I haue found by often triall that this inſtrument wil ſhew the
true houre of the night, and alſo in what rombe the guardes bée,
and thirdlie, how much the North ſtarre is at any time either aboue
or beneath the Pole, and by adding the degrée of diſtance
found in the limbe of the inſtrument, or by ſubtracting the ſame
according to the rule before giuen from that altitude of the north
ſtar, which I haue before taken with my Aſtrolabe, I haue found
at all times the true eleuation of the Pole whereſoeuer I haue
made triall thereof. But ſith other Starres may perhaps appeare
when the North Starre with his guardes ſhal be hidden,
I woulde wiſh all carefull Mariners to acquaint themſelues
with as manie bright Starres as they can, and eſpeciallie with
thoſe which do both riſe and ſet, and alſo to learne by ſome Table
the declination of euerie ſuch Starre and whether it be Southernlie
or Northernlie, for by taking the Meridian altitude of anie
ſuch ſtarre and by adding to, or by taking from the altitude
thereof, his declination according as the ſame declination is either
Northernlie or Southernlie (for if it be Northernlie, then you
muſt ſubtract his declination, and if it be Southernlie, you muſt
adde the ſame to the altitude of the Starre) you ſhall finde thereby
the altitude of the Equinoctiall, which being taken out of 90.
the remainder will ſhew the eleuation of the Pole. The meeteſt
ſtarres for this purpoſe in theſe our North partes of the worlde
are theſe, Hircus the Goate, Canis minor, the little Dogge, Canis
maior, the great Dogge, Dexter humerus Orionis, the right
ſhoulder of Orion. Cingulum Orionis, the girdle of Orion. Cor
Leonis, the Lyons hart. Bubulcus, the Bearward. Spica Virginis,
the wheat eare in the hand of Virgo. Aquila volans, the flying
Eagle. Caput Andromedae, the head of Andromeda. Ras
Algol, the head of Meduſa. Oculus Tauri, the Buls eye, and
diuers others,
                  
                     
And in anie caſe conſider whether the declination of the ſtarre
be greater or leſſer than his Meridian altitude, for if his declination
be greater then his meridian altitude, as of thoſe ſtars which
are nigh the Pole, then you muſt take his Meridian altitude with
your Aſtrolabe at two ſeuerall times, that is to ſay, when he is at
his higheſt in the meridian, and alſo when he is at the loweſt point
of the ſame Meridian called the depreſſion, and hauing added
thoſe Meridian altitudes together take halfe thereof, and that half
ſhall be the eleuation of the Pole, which way of finding out the eleuation
of the Pole is nothing méet for a Mariner that is vnder
ſaile. But now to procéede according to Cogniet his direction in
this matter, hee ſaith, that if in ſayling you approch ſo nigh vnto
the Equinoctiall as the eleuation of the Pole is not aboue 17. degrées,
then the guardes are not ſo eaſilie ſéene, wherefore it ſhall
be néedfull to take ſom other ſtarre whereby you may both know
the houre of the night, and alſo how much the Lodeſtarre is eyther
aboue or beneath the Pole, and Cogniet thinketh none of the
ſtarres more méet for that purpoſe than one of theſe two, that is,
either the ſtarre called Caput Meduſae, that is the head of Meduſa
called of the Arabians, Ras Algol, or els the ſtarre called
Hircus, that is, the Goat, both which are faire bright ſtarres
and of the firſt bigneſſe: and the cauſe why he appointeth the head
of Meduſa, is for that this ſtarre is directlie oppoſite to the former
guard, in ſuch ſort as this ſtarre is alwayes aboue the Horizon,
when both the guardes are vnder the Horizon. Wherefore
hauing prepared your inſtrument, that is to ſay, hauing laid the
longeſt tooth of the mooueable rundle vpon the day of the moneth
wherein you ſéeke, and hauing found out thereby in ſuch order as
is before taught, the north ſtar and alſo the ſtar called the head of
Meduſa, both at one inſtant, marke where the index falleth, and
immediately turne the index from that point to the point oppoſite,
abating twelue houres, and ſo the Index ſhall ſhew you thrée
things at once. Firſt, the rombe wherein the guardes are at that
preſent. Secondlie, the houre of the night. And thirdly how much
the North ſtarre is aboue or beneath the Pole. But becauſe this
ſtarre is not knowne perhaps to all Mariners, Cogniet would
haue you to take the other bright Starre called Hircus, which
(as hée ſaith) goeth 9. houres and ½ before the guardes, in ſuch

ſort, as when the former guarde is Eaſt,, you ſhall finde this
Starre, counting from the North ſtarre, to be Northweſt, and
almoſt 45. degrées diſtant from the Pole, with which ſtarre
if you worke, as you did before with the heade of Meduſa, ſauing
that you ſhall not néede to turne the index vnto the oppoſite
point, but onelie to rebate from the point on which it falleth
9. houres and ½ you ſhall knowe all the thrée thinges laſt mentioned.
And this rule (as he ſaith) is ſo generall as you may haue
your deſire by working in like manner with any other ſtarre that
is to you certainlie knowne, & is at that time aboue the Horizon.
               
               
                  What ſtarres are obſerved by thoſe that ſayle beyond the
Equinoctiall vnder the South Pole.
Chapter. 43.
                  
                     THe ancient Aſtronomers, as Ptolomey, Timochares,
Hypparchus and others did neuer deſcribe
any ſtar to be more nigh vnto the South
pole, than that which is called Canopus, which
is a faire bright ſtarre of the firſt bigneſſe, and
according to the Tables of Copernicus, is diſtant
from the South Pole 38. degrées, and ¼. But thoſe that haue
ſayled in the South ſeas of later dayes, haue founde out other
ſtarres vnknowne to the ancient Aſtronomers, which are much
néerer vnto the ſaid Pole. For Albericus Veſputius writeth of
thrée Starres, making together a Triangle Orthogonall, that is
to ſay, hauing one right angle, now called the ſouthern Triangle,
the middle ſtar wherof is diſtant from the ſouth Pole 9. degrées, ⅖.
                  There be alſo latelie found out diuers images of other ſtarres
nigh vnto the South pole, as that which is called Noah his Doue,
or Pigeon, and another called Polophilax, made in the ſhape of a
man, whoſe longitude and latitude hath not as yet bene rightlie
ſet downe by any that I haue read.
                  But the ſea men of theſe preſent dayes doe moſt commonlie
obſerue foure great ſtars, which according to the ſhape and forme
thereof they call the Croſſe, imagining the greateſt ſtarre of the
foure to be the foot, & that which ſtandeth right ouer him to be the
head of the croſſe, & the other two to be the 2 armes: and when they

ſée that the head doeth directiie anſwere the foote, then they ſay

that the foote of the ſaide croſſe is
right aboue the Pole, and diſtant
from the ſame 30. degrées. Therefore,
hauing taken the altitude or
height of that ſtar aboue ye Horizon
with their Aſtrolabe they ſubtract
30. degrees from that altitude,
and the remainder is the eleuation
of the Pole. Medina in his fift
booke and eleuenth chapter ſetteth
downe the ſhape of the foreſaide
croſſe in this maner.
                  And he ſaith that theſe ſtarres are neither anie of thoſe ſtarres
that are appointed to the twelue Signes in the Zodiaque, nor
yet any of the 36. Images or conſtellations that bee in heauen.
Moreouer he ſaith, that in taking the altitude of the great Starre
called the foote béeing in his right place, that is to ſay, when hée is
directlie oppoſite to the head, and that you finde his altitude to
be 30. degrées, then you may aſſure your ſelfe that you are right
vpon the Equinoctiall. And if you finde his altitude to bee more
than 30. degrées, then you are paſt the Equinoctiall towardes
the South Pole. But if you find it to bee leſſe than 30. degrées,
then you are ſtill on the North ſide of the Equinoctiall.
                  Beſides the ſtarres aboue mentioned, our Mariners in theſe
North parts of the world are woont to obſerue diuers other ſtars,
to the number of 32. whoſe longitude and declination together
with their bigneſſe and alſo when they riſe and ſet, and when they
are mounted to the Meridian, that is to ſay, are iuſt South, is
plainlie ſet forth by Tables collected of purpoſe out of the Aſtronomicall
Tables by William Boorne, which Tables you ſhall
finde in the 20. chapter of his book called the regiment of the ſea,
And Robert Norman doeth alſo ſet downe the like tables in his
booke called the Attractiue, and therefore I thinke it ſuperfluous
to repeat the ſame againe here, and ſpeciallie ſith I haue deſcribed
vnto you all the ſtarres that bee in the firmament that were
knowne to the ancient Aſtronomers, and haue ſhewed you how to
find out by the Globe their longitudes, their latitudes, their declinations

their greatnes and all other accidentes belonging to the
Starres in my treatiſe of the Celeſtiall Globe, which I wrote of
purpoſe to further yong ſea men.
                  The knowledge of the Stars ſerueth ſea men chiefly to knowe
thereby the latitude of any place, and alſo to knowe the houre of
the night: And thirdlie, to conicecture by their manner of riſing
and ſetting, and other their aſpectes what weather is like to followe,
either foule or faire: the rules whereof to teach trulie bebelongeth
to Aſtronomers, yet many ſea men by diligent obſeruation
doe attaine to right good iudgment therein. Wherefore
leauing to ſpeake any further of the Starres, I will now briefly
ſpeake of the Sunne and of his motions, of his riſing and ſetting
in euerie latitude, and of his declination from the Equinoctiall,
and of other his like apparances. I ſay here brieflie, becauſe I
haue alreadie ſpoken of him at large in the 1. part of my ſpheare
wheras I treat of the Zodiaque.
               
               
                  Of the Sunne, and of his motion, and of the chiefeſt apparances
belonging to him.

                     THe Sunne according to the moouing of the firſt
mooueable which is from Eaſt to Weſt maketh
his dayly reuolution in 24▪ houres, as all other
Starres doe, but according to his owne motion,
which is from Weſt to Eaſt in going through
the twelue Signes of the Zodiaque he ſpendeth
a whole yeare, for his daylie mouing vpon his own center, called
the excentrick, becauſe it is out of the center of the world, is little
more then 59. minutes, 8. ſecondes, making thereby the whole
yeare to conſiſt of 365. dayes, fiue houres 49. minutes, 8. ſeconds,
19. thirdes, 37. fourths, 24. fiftes, and this is called of
Copernicus, the equall tropicall yeare, which taketh his beginning
from the firſt point of Aries, otherwiſe called the Vernall
Equinoxe, into which point the Sunne entreth not euery yeare at
one ſelfe day of the moneth, for ſometime hee entreth into that
point the tenth day, and ſometime the eleuenth day of March,

which day of his entring is alwayes trulie ſet downe in euerie
Ephemerides, and becauſe the beginning of the tropicall yeare
is ſo vncertaine, the Aſtronomers doe make their yeare called the
ſyderal yeare, to begin at the former ſtar of the Rams horne, and
thereby doe make the yeare to conſiſt of 365. dayes. 6 houres 9.
minutes and 39. ſecondes, according to which yeare they alwaies
rectifie or bring to equalitie, aſwell the equall as the vnequal tropicall
yeare, of both which I haue ſpoken in the firſt part of my
Spheare, the 38. and 39. chapters.
                  Moreouer, the Sunne hath thrée motions, that is, ſlowe, ſwift
and meane. His ſlowe motion is when he is in the point called
Auge or Apogeon, which is a point imagined to bee nigh vnto
the outermoſt edge of the circle which carrieth the bodie of the
Sunne called Deferens Solis, and is furtheſt diſtant from the
center of the world, which point in theſe our daies is in the 9.
degrée of Cancer, or there abouts. And béeing in that point, he
goeth little more than 57. minutes in 24. houres. Againe, his
ſwift motion is when he is in the oppoſite point to the Auge, called
Perigeon, which point in theſe dayes is in the 9. degree of Capricorne,
and being in this point, he goeth one whole degree and
almoſt two minutes in 24 houres, which is almoſt fiue minutes
more than he maketh in his ſlow motion. His meane motion is
when he is in the midſt betwixt the two foreſaid points, wheras
in 24. houres he goeth one whole degree & ſomewhat more than
two minutes. And theſe thrée ſundrie motions doe cauſe the Equinoctiall
pointes not to be of equall diſtance. For the Sunne
ſpendeth ſeuen dayes and ſomewhat more in going from the Equinoxe
of March, to the Equinoxe of September, than he doth
in going from the Equinoxe of September to the Equinoxe of
March. For if in this preſent yeare 1592. which is leape yeare,
you count the dayes from the Vexnall Equinoxe, which is the eleuenth
of March, vnto the Autumne Equinoxe, which is the 13.
of September, you ſhall find the number of the dayes to be 186.
and the other number from the 13. of September to the eleuenth
of March, to be but 180. which is leſſe than the firſt number by 6
dayes, and if it were not leape yeare the difference would be ſeuen
dayes, becauſe that Februarie in the leape yeare hath 29. dayes.
                  It is neceſſarie that ſea men haue ſome vnderſtanding of the

thrée foreſaide motions to the intent that they may the better
know the true place of the Sunne and thereby his true declination.
And note that no calculation of his declination can continue
without errour aboue twentie foure yeares. For as often
as the leape yeare commeth about, which is euerie foure yeares,
the Sunne is vppon the Equinoctiall ſooner by halfe an houre.
But as for the true place of the Sunne, and eſpecially euery day
at noontide, the Ephemerides doth moſt trulie ſhewe, and hauing
his place, you ſhall eaſilie finde his declination by this Table
following, which will ſerue for theſe twentie yeares and more,
the like whereof, together with the vſe of the ſame is ſet downe
in the firſt part of my Spheare the 13. chapter.

                     THe vſe of this Table is thus: If the ſunne be in
any of the ſignes ſet down in the front of the Table,
then ſéeke his degrée (firſt found by the Ephemerides)
in the left collum, the degrées whereof
do deſcend from one to 30. and the ſquare Angle
anſwerable to the ſigne and degrée will ſhew his
declination. But if the ſunne be in any of the ſignes that are in the
foote of the Table, then ſéeke his degrée in the right collum, the degrées
whereof do aſcend, and the ſquare Angle anſwerable to that
ſigne and degrée will ſhew his declination.
                  There be other things alſo méete for Sea-men to knowe, touching
the ſunne as theſe: Firſt to knowe the foure ſeaſons of the
yeare, ſecondly to know by his declination, the length of both the
day and the night in euery latitude, and how it doth encreaſe and
decreaſe: Item to know in what rombe or winde, and at what
houre he riſeth and ſetteth, and alſo his Meridian altitude, that
is, when he is right South euery day, to finde out by the helpe of
that, and by knowing his declination, the true Latitude of any
place, & by his ſhadow to know the houre of the day, which are two
chiefe pointes that the Mariner hath moſt néede to knowe. Of all
which thinges I minde here to treate both plainely and briefely.
               
               
                  Of the foure ſeaſons of the yeare, that is, Spring time, Summer,
fall of the leafe, called otherwiſe Autumne, and winter.
Chap. 46.
                  
                     IN this our Clime the ſpring is ſaid to begin when
the Sun entreth into the firſt point of Aries, which
is about the xi. of March, and continueth vnto the
laſt point of Gemini, which time is ſaide to be hot
and moyſt, and therefore is likened to childhoode:
And ſommer beginneth when the Sun entereth into the firſt point
of Cancer, which is about the 12. or 13. of Iune, and endeth
when he is in the laſt degrée of Virgo: and this time is ſaid to be
hotte and dry, and therefore is likened to Adoleſcencie. Then Autumne
or fall of the leafe beginneth when the Sunne entreth into
the firſt point of Libra, which is about the 13. or 14. of September,
and endeth when the Sun is in the laſt degrée of Sagittarius:
                     
and this time is ſaid to be colde and dry, and therefore is likened
to manhood: Finally winter beginneth when the ſunne entreth into
the firſt point of Capricorne, and endeth when he is in the laſt
degrée of Piſces: and this time is ſaid to be colde and moyſt, and
therefore is likened to olde age: notwithſtanding Galen in his
firſt booke de Elementis, ſayth that the ſpring is temperately hot
and moyſt, and therefore a moſt wholſome time: And ſommer is
more hotte then colde, and more dry then moyſt, and therefore is
ſayd to be hotte and dry: And Autumne is alſo ſaide to be dry becauſe
it is more dry then moyſt, and yet neither hotte nor colde,
but vnequally mixt, and thereby infectiue and cauſing ſickeneſſe.
And winter is ſayd to be colde and moyſt, not becauſe it is colder
or moyſter then any other ſeaſon, but becauſe that in winter moyſture
excéedeth drineſſe, and coldneſſe excéedeth heate. But you
haue to vnderſtād that theſe foure ſeaſons haue not like qualities
in all the 5. Zones: For in the burnt Zone, and ſpecially to thoſe
that dwell right vnder the Equinoctiall the ſunne being in Aries
or Libra cauſeth greateſt heat, & thereby two ſommers becauſe he
is then right ouer their heads, & being in either of the Solſtices,
that is in the beginning of Cancer or Capricorne he cauſeth two
winters becauſe he is then furtheſt from them as I haue declared
vnto you in the ſecond part of my treatiſe of the Spheare the 20.
Chapter, whereas I treate of the ſeaſons and ſhadowes incident
to diuerſe Climes and Parallels whereunto I referre you, and
ſo I ende with this matter.
               
               
                  How to knowe when the Sunne riſeth and ſetteth in everie
latitude, and thereby the length of the day and night, and alſo
in what rombe or wind he riſeth and ſetteth, and how much
he declineth everie day from the Equinoctiall either Northward
or Southward. Alſo howe to know the elevation of the
Pole, otherwiſe called the latitude of any place, by knowing
the Meridian altitude of the Sunne, and his declination.
Chap. 47.
                  
                     THe moſt part of all theſe thinges haue béene taught before
in my Spheare, in my Treatiſe of the Globes, and
alſo in my treatiſe of the Aſtrolabes. And in the firſt two
Treatiſes I ſhew alſo how to finde out the Longitude

of any place, and therefore néedeth not here to be rehearſed: But
if you would know how to handle the declination of the ſunne being
vpon the ſea, then reade 7. 8. 9. and 10. chapters of William
Borne his booke called the Regiment of the Sea, and you ſhal be
fully inſtructed therein: The whole effect of all which Chapters
Robert Norman ſetteth downe in few words in his new Attractiue
in this manner as followeth.
                  Firſt learne whether the ſun haue South declination or North
declination, which you ſhall know by his being in any of the Northerne
or Southern ſignes: Then marke what ſhadow he caſteth,
and whether it ſtriketh towardes the Pole whereunto he is néereſt,
or to the contrary. For if the ſunne caſteth his ſhadowe the
ſame way that he is from the Equinoctiall, he ſhalbe betwixt you
and the Equinoctiall, & then hauing taken his Meridian altitude
ſubtract the ſame from 90. & adde vnto the remainder the ſuns declination
for that day, and the ſumme thereof ſhalbe the eleuation
of the Pole or the diſtance of your Zenith from the Equinoctiall
otherwiſe called the Latitude which is alwaies equal to the eleuation
of the Pole: But if the ſun caſteth his ſhadow to the contrary
ſide of the Equinoctiall, that is to ſay, being in his North declination
caſteth his ſhadow Southward, or being in his ſouth declination
caſteth his ſhadow Northward, then either the Equinoctiall
ſhalbe betwixt you & the ſunne, or you in the Equinoctiall, or elſe
you ſhalbe betwixt the Equinoctial and the ſunne, which you ſhall
know thus: Adde the declination of the ſunne for that day wherin
you ſéeke vnto his Meridian altitude, and if the ſumme of the
addition be leſſer then 90. degrées, then ſo much as it wanteth of
90. degrées ſhall you be diſtant from the Equinoctiall on that ſide
on which the ſhadow ſtréeketh: but if it amounteth iuſt to 90. degrées,
then you ſhalbe right vnder the Equinoctial. Againe if it be
more then 90. degrées, then ſo much as is the ouerplus, ſo much
ſhall you be from the Equinoctiall towards the ſunne, at which
time you ſhall be alſo betwixt the Equinoctiall and the ſunne.
                  And if you finde the Meridian altitude of the ſunne to be eauen
with your Zenith, then looke what declination the ſun hath at that
inſtant, and ſo much ſhall you be from the Equinoctiall on that
ſide wherein the ſunne is: But if the ſunne haue no declination,
then ſhall you be right vnder the Equinoctiall line.
               
               
                  
                  Of the ſhaddow of the Sunne, and how to know therby the
houre of the day in any latitude by help of an vniverſall diall.
Chap. 48.
                  
                     MY former order now requireth that I ſhould ſpeake
ſomewhat of the ſhadow of the Sun, and of the diuerſitie
therof, according to the Clime or Parallel vnder
which you ſayle. But for ſo much as I haue ſhewed
you in the ſecond part of my Sphere from the 20. to the 27. chapter
of the ſame, what diuerſe ſhadowes the Sunne yéeldeth in diuerſe
Climes and Parallels, and alſo haue ſhewed what Vmbra
recta and Vmbra verſa is in the 40. Chapter of my Treatiſe of
the Aſtrolabes: I minde not here therefore to make a new recitall
therof, but only to ſhew how you ſhall find by his ſhadow the true
houre of the day in euery Latitude by a generall Dyall, made to
ſerue in all Latitudes, of which Dyals, though I haue ſéene diuerſe
and of diuerſe ſhapes, yet none liketh me better then that
which William Borne ſetteth downe in his Regiment the 21.
Chapter, and calleth it the Equinoctiall Diall, which ſerueth not
onely to know the houre of the day by the ſhadow of the ſunne, but
alſo the houre of the night by the ſhadowe of the Moone when ſhe
ſhineth cleare, which Diall being of ſmall charge, I would wiſh
all Mariners to haue: The making and vſe whereof is ſo plainely
ſet downe by himſelfe in the foreſaid Chapter as I thinke it ſuperfluous
to ſet it downe againe here. And thus ending with the
the ſunne, I will now turne my pen to the Moone.
               
               
                  Of the Moone and of all her diuers motions.
Chap. 49.
                  
                     THe Moone is a round thicke and darke bodie, hauing
no light of her ſelfe, but onely ſuch as ſhe receiueth
from the ſunne, and ſhee maketh her dayly
motion from Eaſt to Weſt as all other ſtarres doe in
24. houres, according to the moouing of the Primum mobile.
But according to her owne motion, which is from Weſt to Eaſt,
the goeth but 13. degrées 12. minutes in the ſpace of 24. houres,

and that is according to her meane motion. And ſhe paſſeth thorough
the twelue ſignes of the Zodiaque in 27. dayes and eight
houres: during which time the ſunne by his natural motion which
is alſo from Weſt to Eaſt, is remooued from the place of coniunction
almoſt 27. degrées, ſo as the Moone not finding the Sun
there ſpendeth two dayes foure houres, and 44. minutes more in
ouertaki
                        •
                     g him, which being added to 27. dayes and 8. houres
doe make in all 29. dayes 12. houres and 44. minutes. Notwithſtanding
by reaſon that the Moone hath aſwel as the Sunne thrée
motions, that is, ſwift, meane, and flowe, ſhe may change ſometime
ſooner and ſometimes later then in 29. dayes 12. houres 44.
minutes, and yet one change counted with an other ſhall make
vpp the ſelfe ſame ſumme. And note that this her thréefold motion
dependeth vppon two pointes, the one called the Auge, and the other
the point oppoſite to the Auge.
                  
                  The point Auge of the Moone is when ſhe is furtheſt diſtant
from the earth, and the point oppoſite to that is when ſhée is
nigheſt to the earth: For wheu ſhe is in the point Auge, ſhe goeth
little more then twelue degrées in 24. houres: but when ſhe is
in the oppoſite point ſhe goeth almoſt 15. degrées in 24. houres.
And in her meane motion which is in the middeſt betwixt the two
foreſaide points, ſhee goeth 13. degrées and 12. minutes in 24.
houres. Now becauſe the Mariners doe account the moouing of
the Moone by the pointes of their Compaſſes, they may thereby
vnderſtand that ſhe goeth not alwaies in 24. houres one point and
thrée minutes as they reckon, but ſometime more and ſometime
leſſe: For when ſhe is in her ſlow motion ſhe 
                        〈…〉
                      more then
12. degrées in 24. houres, in which time the 
                        〈…〉
                      one degrée,
ſo as the Moone is diſtant from the 
                        〈…〉
                      degrées,
which is but 44. minutes of an houre, which wanteth 4. minutes
of a whole point, whereto is attributed 48′· as hath beene ſaid before:
and in her ſwift motion ſhe goeth 15. degrees, in which the
ſunne goeth one degree, ſo as ſhe is diſtant from the ſunne 14.
degrees, which is more then a point and 3. minutes of the compaſſe.
And you haue to note that the point Auge of the Moone is
mooueable and paſſeth through the Zodiaque in the ſpace of 19.
yeares, and thereby ſometime cauſeth the full of the Moone to
happen ſooner or later.
               
               
                  
                  How to knowe in what ſigne the point Auge of the Moone
is in any yeare.
Chap. 50.
                  
                     IF you would know in what ſigne the Auge of the
Moone is in any yeare, then you muſt conſider the
prime or golden number of that yeare for when
the prime or golden number is one, then her Auge
is in Aries. And if the Moone be alſo thē in Aries,
ſhe is in her ſlowe motion: and being in the point
oppoſite which is ♎, ſhe is in her ſwift motion. And ſith this Auge
of the Moone goeth through the 12. ſignes in 19. yeares as
hath béene ſaid, it muſt néedes fall out that in 9. yeares and a halfe
her Auge commeth to be in Libra: And then the Moone being
there ſhe is in her ſlowe motion: And being in the point oppoſite
which is Aries, ſhe is in her ſwift motion: Again when the prime
is 5. then her point Auge is in Cancer: and the Moone being
there ſhe is in her ſlow motion, and when ſhe commeth to be in the
point oppoſite which is Capricorne, ſhe is in her ſwift motion:
And when the prime is 14. or 15. then her point Auge is in Capricorne,
where if the Moone be alſo, then ſhee is in her ſlowe
motion: and being in the point oppoſite which is Cancer, ſhe is
in her ſwift motion. And note that when the Moone is in her ſwift
motion ſhe maketh her change, or full, or any other aſpect the ſooner:
And contrariwiſe when ſhe is in her ſlow motion ſhe maketh
her change, or ful, or any other aſpect the later. Moreouer you ſhal
ſée her at the time of her change eyther ſooner or later, according
to the time of the yeare, for from Ianuary to Iune you ſhal ſée her
within 24. houres after her change, becauſe ſhe hath during thoſe
monethes North declination from the ſunne, & maketh a greater
arch then the ſunne doth. But from Iuly to December you ſhall
not ſée the Moone ſcant thrée dayes after the change. But you may
ſée her within 24. houres before her change, becauſe that during
thoſe monethes ſhe hath South declination from the ſunne: And
note that when the Moone is thrée dayes and 18. houres, which is
the halfe quarter of the Moone, the ſea men doe call that time the
prime day, becauſe the Moone is then 4. points to the Eaſtward of
the Sunne, which is thrée houres, for to euery point is attributed

thrée quarters of an houre as hath béene ſaide before. Moreouer it
is neceſſary for ſea men to knowe when the Moone riſeth & ſetteth,
and in what part of the Horizon in euery Latitude: and how long
ſhe ſhineth and when ſhe is full South, and alſo what Latitude ſhe
hath, and whether it be South or North euery day and houre thoroughout
the yeare. All which thinges are moſt eaſie to be found
by the Globe, and by helpe of the Ephemerides in ſuch ſort as is
before taught in my Treatiſe of the Globes, and alſo by helpe of
M. Blagraue his Aſtrolabe, her true place in the Zodiaque being
firſt knowne by the Ephemerides. It is méete alſo to know when
ſhe is in coniunction with the ſunne, or at the full, and the reſt of
her quarters, which is eaſily knowne by the Ephemerides.
               
               
                  When the Moone is ſaide to be in Coniunction with the
Sunne, or to be at the full, and what her greateſt latitude is aſwell
from the Ecliptique line, as from the Equinoctiall.
Chap. 51.
                  
                     SHe is ſaid to be in coniunction with the ſunne when
the ſunne and ſhe be both in one ſelfe ſigne and like
degrée: But when ſhe is at the full, then ſhe is oppoſite
to the ſunne, and diſtant from him 6. ſignes,
which is the one halfe of the Zodiaque, containing
180. degrées: And in euery quarter ſhe is diſtant from the ſunne
thrée ſignes which is 90. degrées: Moreouer the Moone is ſaid to
haue Latitude both Northerne and Southerne from the Ecliptique
line, which line ye deferent of the Moone croſſeth in 2. points,
and thereby maketh two interſections, whereof the one tending
towardes the North is called the head of the Dragon, and the other
interſection towardes the South is called the tayle of the
Dragon, ſo as when the Moone is paſſed 90. degrées from the
Dragons head towardes the North, then her Latitude is 5. degrées
Northward: And when ſhe is diſtant 90. degrées from the
tayle of the Dragon towardes the South, then her Latitude is
alſo 5. degrées Southward, which is the greateſt Latitude that
ſhe hath on eyther ſide of the Ecliptique line, whereof I haue
written more at large in the firſt part of my Spheare the 25. chap.

in which you ſhall finde a figure repreſenting the ſaide Dragon
both head and tayle: But her Latitude is to be conſidered in two
reſpects, that is not onely from the Ecliptique line, but alſo from
the Equinoctiall, for from the Ecliptique line her greateſt Latitude
is but 5. degrées on eyther ſide of the Ecliptique, as hath bin
ſaid before. But from the Equinoctiall her greateſt Latitude is
28. degrées and a halfe on either ſide of the Equinoctiall, which
in mine opinion might be more rightly called her greateſt declination,
which excéedeth by 5. degrees the declination of the ſunne,
for that is but 23. degrees and a halfe, or rather 28′· on either ſide
of the Equinoctiall. But this great Latitude of the Moone is
onely to be vnderſtood when the prime is one, and that her Auge
is in Aries: For when the prime is betwixt 9. or 10. yeares or
more, the Moone declineth not from the Equinoctial on either ſide
aboue 18. degrees and a halfe at the moſt.
               
               
                  How to know in what part of the Zodiaque the head of the
Dragon is euerie yeare.
Chap. 52.
                  
                     IF you would know in what part of the Zodiaque the
head of the Dragon is, then you muſt conſider the
prime, for when the prime is one then the Dragons
head is in the firſt point of Aries, euen as the point
Auge is. And in 19. yeares it paſſeth thorough the twelue ſignes
aſwell as the point Auge of the Moone, but with contrary courſe
for the point Auge of the Moone mooueth according to the ſucceſſion
of the ſignes, that is, from Aries to Taurus, Gemini and ſo
foorth: But the head of the Dragon hath a contrary motion, that
is, from Aries to Piſces, and ſo into Aquarius and ſo foorth, ſo
as in 9. yeares and a halfe it meeteth iuſt with the point Auge of
the Moone in the ſigne Libra. Thus you ſee that by knowing the
prime, you learne alſo to knowe in what ſigne the Auge of the
Moone, and alſo the Dragons head is, and what Latitude the
Moone hath, aſwell from the Ecliptique line as from the Equinoctiall.
But one of the chiefeſt points to be had by the Moone, is
to know thereby the tides, that is when the ſea floweth and ebbeth
in any place: whereof we come now to ſpeake.
               
               
                  
                  How to know the tydes in any place by the Moone.
Chap. 53.
                  
                     BEfore that you enter into any Hauen or Riuer,
it is neceſſary to knowe the true tydes of that
place, which tydes are ſubiect to the motion of
the Moone, for ſhe cauſeth at one place or other
alwaies in one certaine rombe full Sea. As
for example it is alwayes full ſea at Antwerp
when the Moone is either right Eaſt or Weſt:
and it is ebbe or lowe water there when ſhe is North or South,
and becauſe the Moone doth paſſe through all the rombes of the
Mariners Compaſſe in 24. houres, they allow to euery rombe ¾.
of an houre, which is 45. minutes, and that being multiplyed by
32. do make iuſt 24. houres, wherefore if the two rombes, North
and South do yéeld ech of them 12. houres, then the firſt rombe
muſt néedes yéelde ¾. of an houre, the ſecond one houre and ½. and
the third two houres and ¼. and ſo foorth of the reſt: For by adding
to euery rombe ¾. you ſhall find that the Eaſt and Weſt doe
yéelde alwayes 6. houres: but then you muſt note that according
to the age of the Moone the tydes do fall euery day later and later,
wherfore to know the true time of the tyde in any place, you muſt
firſt learne by ſome Rutter or by the relation of others that can
tell in what rombe the Moone cauſeth full ſea in that place, & then
at what houre it is full ſea, the Moone being eyther in the change
or at the full, which you ſhall know by allowing to euery rombe ¾.
of an houre in ſuch manner as is before ſet downe. But if you
would knowe at what houre it is full ſea in that place euery day,
then you muſt firſt vnderſtand that the Moone in 30. daies ſlacketh
24. houres, which amounteth to ⅘. of an houre which is 48. minutes
for euery day, for ſo much ſhe declineth euery day from the
ſunne, then looke how many dayes the Moone is old, and hauing
multiplyed the ſame by ⅘. that is to ſay by 48. minutes, adde the
product thereof to thoſe houres at which it is full ſea, and you
ſhall haue the true time of full ſea euery day. As for example, ſuppoſe
th at it was full ſea at the laſt new Moone at ſome place here

in England at thrée of the clocke in the afternoone, and nowe I
would know at what a clocke it ſhall be full ſea 5. dayes after the
new Moone. Now if you multiply 5. being the age of the Moone
by 48. minutes, and adde to the product therof thrée houres, which
was the time of the laſt change, the full ſea ſhall be at that place
at ſeuen of the clocke. But if the ſumme of ſuch addition be aboue
12. houres, then you muſt caſt away the 12. and the remainder
ſhall ſhew you the true houre of full ſea.

                     THere is alſo an eaſier way to knowe the tydes euery
day in any place by the helpe of an inſtrument
ſet downe by Cogniet, wherof both the making
and vſe here followeth. Firſt vpon ſome
bord well playned and made ſmooth, draw a Circle,
and deuide the ſame into 30. parts ſignifying
the dayes or age of the Moone, ſetting the number of 30. aboue in
the toppe of the inſtrument, and place all the other numbers as
1. 2. 3. and ſo foorth towards your right hande, that done, make a
mooueable roundle which may turne about within the verdge of the
firſt Circle, and deuide that into 24. houres, and alſo into 32.
rombes, ſetting the North point marked with the Flower deluce
at the twelfth houre aboue, & the South point at the twelfth houre
beneath, and the Eaſt point at the ſixth houre on your right hand,
and the Weſt point at the ſixth houre on your left hande, and ſo
ſhall your inſtrument be perfect, the vſe whereof is thus:
                  Firſt you muſt knowe what rombe of the Moone in that place
which you ſéeke maketh a full ſea, and alſo the age of the Moone by
ſome Almanacke or ſome other rule before taught, then hauing
theſe two thinges turne the inward rondle of the houres & rombes
vntill the foreſaid knowne rombe doth iuſtly anſwere to the 30.
day of the great rondle, and there ſtaying it firme with your finger,
ſéeke in the outermoſt border of the greater rondle the age of
the Moone, and that will ſhew you in the rondle of houres the very
houre of full ſea that day in that place.
                  
                     
                     
                  
                  But one chiefe thing touching the knowing of the tydes is to
be noted as Borne ſayth, which is that the ſea will flow more by
one point of the Compaſſe in the ſpring tydes, then in any of the
quarters of the Moone called Nep tydes in euery riuer that hath
any indraft, and is of ſome reaſonable diſtance from the ſea: As
for example, it floweth at Graues end at the change or full of the
Moone when ſhe is South Southweſt: but in any of her quarters
it ſkant floweth when ſhe is South and by Weſt, and this rule as
he ſayth is generall for euer.

                  How a generall Rutter ſhewing the tydes in al places
ſhould be made.
Chap. 55.
                  
                     WIlliam Borne doth ſet downe what Moone doth make
a full ſea, aſwell here in the moſt parts of our Engliſh
coaſts as in ſome other parts of France & Spain,
and ſo doe many others whoſe Tables touching the
tydes are called Rutters, whereof ſome are truely ſet downe and
ſome are falſe: But ſith ſuch Rutters do ſerue but for a few particular
places, I would wiſh that ſome learned Pilot that hath
ſayled many and ſundry long voyages, to make a generall Rutter
that might ſerue for al places if it were poſſible, or at ye leaſt for ſo
many places as are knowne in theſe daies: And I would wiſh ſuch
generall Rutter to be made in manner of an Alphabet: and that
euery place might haue his true Longitude and Latitude added
thereunto, to the intent that euery place might be the more eaſily
found out in any Map or Card that is graduated with degrées of
Longitude and Latitude: And then to ſhewe what Moone doth
make a full ſea in euery ſuch place, which thing who ſoeuer would
performe, he ſhould in mine opinion deſerue great commendation.
And thus I end this Treatiſe, praying all the learned Seamen
not to be offended or gréeued with mee for that I doe make
young Gentlemen our owne Countrimen partakers of their moſt
worthy knowledge, whereof the ignorant are not able to iudge,
nor to yéelde them that prayſe which they deſerue: yea rather I
hope that they will help to perfect what ſo euer I haue herein left
vnperfected, to make the young Gentlemen the more ſkilfull,
and thereby the more ſeruiceable to their Countrie, and in ſo doing
they ſhall procure to them ſelues great good will and infinite
thankes.
