            FREDERICKE, By the Grace of GOD,
King of BOHEMIA, Count Palatine of the RHINE,
Elector of the Sacred EMPIRE, Duke of BAVARIA,
Marquiſſe of MORAVIA, Duke of SILESIA and
LVXEMEVRG, Marquiſſe of the Higher and Lower
LVSASIA, &c. TO ALL Potentates, Electors, Princes,
and States of Chriſtendome, happy Greeting.
            WEE make no doubt, but all in generall,
reſiding either within or
without the Empire, doe now ſufficiently
vnderſtand the miſerable
and moſt perilous eſtate, into
which the Kingdome of BOHEMIA is reduced,
being ſo Famous for Antiquitie, and a principall
member of the Sacred Empire, as alſo the
Countryes thereunto annexed and Incorporated,
with other bordering Prouinces. Neither
can they be ignorant of ſuch actions of Oppreſſion,
hoſtilitie, and violence, which haue beene
practiſed within a little time, through continuall
Rapines, Murders, Combuſtions, Deuaſtations,
plentifull effuſion of Innocent blood, violation
and rauiſhing, both of Wiues and honeſt Virgins,
diſmembring of little ſucking Children,
with many other inhumane, moſt Cruell, and
Barbarous inſolences. In like manner the true
ſource and originall of all theſe euils, of what afterwards
enſued, or may in future time accrue,

moſt euidently appeareth and is as cleare as day,
both by experience, and the ample Relations
that haue beene diuers times made thereof; that
they who by their depraued Councels, and ſuggeſtions,
haue bene the means to precipitate the
mightier ſort, into preſent danger and loſſe, are
now themſelues conuinced, euen within their
owne conſciences. And notwithſtanding the
ſucceſſe of theſe latter times, wherein ſundry opinions
haue been hatched, about the ſubiect of
Religion, may make one clearely diſcerne with
his eye, and (as it were) touch with his finger,
that according to the veritie of holy Scripture,
and a Maxime heretofore, held and maintayn'd,
by the ancient Doctors of the Church, that mens
Conſciences, ought in no ſort to be violated, vrged,
or conſtrained; and whenſoeuer men haue
attempted any thing by this violent courſe, whether
openly, or by ſecret meanes, the iſſue hath
beene pernicious, and the cauſe of great and
wonderfull innouations, in the principalleſt and
mightieſt Kingdomes, and Countries of all Chriſtendome:
Yet ſo it is,The Ieſuits. that a certaine extrauagant,
and ſtrange kinde of people, hauing diſperſed
themſelues ouer Chriſtendome, but eſpecially
within the Empire, and other Kingdomes and
Countries, bordering and depending thereupon,

and hauing there brought in, and planted a new
Doctrine, abſolutely funeſtall and obnoxious,
to all Potentates, and Magiſtrates: nay and further,
hauing not onely obtained fauour and acceſſe
to great men, but alſo drawne to their own
bent, both their Councellours, and Officers, and
generally the moſt Honourable, and opulent of
euery place, through the falſe charme, of a counterfeit
and masked Sanctitie, an implaceable deſire
and thirſt, did meruailouſly grow and increaſe,
of perſecuting all thoſe, who were ſeperated
from the Romaine Church, yea and totally
to extirpate them, if they did not yeeld, and
come vnder that Iuriſdiction. Whereupon, it
came to paſſe, that notwithſtanding all the good
endeauours, that precedent Princes, and Gouernours
haue beſtowed both in the Empire, and
more eſpecially in the Kingdome of BOHEMIA,
for preſeruation of common Peace, and carying
an euen hand between the adherents of the one,
and th'other Church, conformable to the Conceſſions,
and Edicts of pacification, granted in
fauour of Religion: their Succeſſors for all this
(more through others inſtigation, queſtionleſſe,
then of their owne proper diſpoſition) haue
beene vrged ſo farre, as to giue a large field of
leaue and Libertie to theſe peſtiferous kinde of

people and their complices, who entring herevpon
into a full and mayne Careir, they preſumed
ſomtimes to innouate one thing, then another,
and not onely by publike writing to draw
into doubt and controuerſie, but alſo really to
annihilate and make fruſtrate the ſaid Conceſsions,
liberties of Religion, Pacts, Obligations and
Oathes, ſolemnly aſſumed for their confirmatiō.
            But wee will not heere ſet downe in particulers,
what hath beene practiſed for many yeares
ſince, and attempted in all parts of the Empire,
vpon the purchaſe of this Licence and Lliberty;
neither in how weake and inſtable manner, affaires
ſtill continue and ſtand: referring our
ſelues herein, to that, which Time ſhall further
manifeſt by ſufficient tryals and proofes, in
whatſoeuer ſhall be requiſite and conuenient.
            But as for the Crowne of BOHEMIA, and the
Countryes thereunto annexed, wee muſt no
wayes diſſemble it, and it is very well knowne,
that according as the light of the holy Goſpell
ſpred his beames more and more from time to
time, the luſtre and repute of the Roman Catholike
Religion, hath there beene wonderfully
eclipſed, not without procuring much trouble
and ſtrife: ſo that finally, it moſt neceſſarily behoued
to prouide for the maintainance of common

Peace and tranquillitie within the Realme,
and this was effected by certain permiſſions and
Licences, to preuent, that diuerſity of Religion
might not wholly alter or diſturbe a generall and
peaceable humane Societie. So long as things
remained in theſe indifferent tearmes, both one
and other party held themſelues well contented.
            But thoſe turbulent Spirits, of whom wee formerly
ſpake, hauing no will to conſent to publike
repoſe and peace, they rather choſe to hazard
and reduce thinges to an vtter extremity,
then to diminiſh the leaſt tittle of that intention
which was ſo deeply grauen in their hearts;
which was, that all things might come vnder
the Popes ſpirituall iuriſdiction, and at laſt, vnder
the ſecular Dominion of ſome ſtrange and
forraigne gouernment. All which added more
and more agrieuances and moleſtations to Religion.
And aboue all the reſt, many plots were
laide to fruſtrate the Royall Letters and Conceſſions
of his Majeſty, to dimoliſh, or at leaſt
ſhut vp, the Euangelical Churches, and Temples
newly built, to raiſe vp thunderings, and threatnings
amongſt the Eſtates, to interdict, and actually
prohibite their lawfull defence, horribly to
perſecute the poore Subiects, with comminations
of more terrible Oppreſsion, Inſults, with

loſſe of body, Life, and goods, beſides ſundry other
in-iuſtices, perpetrated againſt men of euery
ſeuerall condition. And on the other ſide,
when naturall and iuſt reſiſtance, oppoſed theſe
inſolences, or any other meanes which neceſſity
vrged vnto, as thoſe Manifeſts publiſhed by the
ſaid Eſtates can teſtifie, they of the contrary party,
in ſtead of referring their cauſe to reaſon and
equall hearing, proceeded further, by open hoſtilitie,
and force of Armes to ſuch a point, that
a good part of the ſaid Kingdom of BOHEMIA,
and the Prouinces Incorporate, remayneth now
diſmembred by Fyer, and Sword, being (as it
were) turned into Blood, and Aſhes. Whereunto,
we might alſo add, that whereas many yeares
ſince, and eſpecially the laſt paſt, the ſaid Kingdome,
and Countryes, haue expoſed their liues,
and ſubſtance, for the Defence and maintenance
of the Crowne of HVNGARIE, but aboue all other,
of the Frontier Fortifications, againſt the
Forces of the Turke, a puiſſant, and dreadfull enemy
to Chriſtendome; quite contrary, and as it
were, for an accumulation of all euils, the ſaid
places were vnfurniſhed both of Men, Artillery,
and warlike munition, that the ſame might bee
employed againſt the Bohemian Nation, which
was appointed, and ordayned againſt the Turke.
            
               
Moreouer, they haue in the Empire, not onely
exacted that which remain'd yet vnpayed of the
olde Contributions againſt the Turke: but alſo
vnder a ſpeciall pretext of the preſeruation and
defence of the ſaid places, in certaine Precincts
and Prouinces of the Empire, they haue impoſed
new Subſidies, which being obtayned and
Collected in a great part, it was no wayes imployed
to the pretended vſe, and end, but rather
to the ruyne and deſolation of the members of
the Empire, and their dependances. By meanes
whereof, one may ſee the Vauntmure, and Bulwarke
of Chriſtendome full of holes, and breaches,
ready to tumble and fall downe. And this
gaue the HVNGARIAN Nation, ſufficient warning,
to looke to their own ſecuritie & Defence.
            We alſo ſuppoſe it is no leſſe generally known,
with what care, affection, and loue, how we and
other Electors and Princes (yea and ſome forraine
Potentates likewiſe) by our exhortations
and interceſſions, haue procured all the beſt Offices
poſſible, to quench and extinguiſh that fire,
which daily ſpread it ſelfe more and more in the
ſaid Kingdome, and to deuiſe ſome meanes how
to preuent a greater diſaſter. And in truth, nothing
would haue been more pleaſing to vs then
to ſee thoſe differences and oppoſitions accruing

between Princes and Subjects, ſoone appeaſed
and ended by an Admiſſion of the Eſtates of the
ſame Countries, to heare and determine therein,
as heretofore the laudable and commendable
Cuſtome was, and by vs out of ſincere and viſcerall
affection in due time Vrged and moued:
by reaſon that the Intermiſſion of remote Princes
and Potentates procured great loſſe of time,
and very often augmented ſuſpicion & diſtruſt.
            But all preſent circumſtances clearely manifeſt,
what fruit or effect the ſaid aduertiſements
brought forth, ſeeing vnder, colour of a ſuſpenſion
of Armes, there hath not onely many
Monthes paſſed ouer head, during which time,
the enemy hath not ceaſed to forage and ſpoyle;
But moreouer vnder ſhadow of deferring it, to
ſuch an interpoſition, there hath alſo a long ſpace
of time ſlipt away: whereas in ſuch dangerous
and imminent caſes, and when hoſtile Actions
are dayly re-enforced, we ought effectually to
make vſe of other more expedite meanes to
worke a ceſſation, for it had bin impoſible profitably
to haue treated of any Accommodation,
by way of Interpoſition, without firſt ſtopping
the courſe of the fore-mentioned Hoſtilities, and
ſetting downe a preualent, and validius ſecurity.
            Beſides all this (no doubt rather by the ſuggeſtions

of ſome perſons, who hauing loſt all
hope of attaining their ends and ſcopes by lenitie
and mildenes, aſpired thereunto by way of
Armes) they were negligent and careles, to lay
hold of the iuſt & opportune occaſion of re-eſtabliſhing
the Peace, which after the death of the
Emperour MATHIAS deceaſed, of laudable memory,
preſented it ſelfe; in that they would by
no meanes lend their eares, to the wholſome
counſell of good Patriots, nay of perſons conſtituted
in high place and Dignity, to recouer (as
was moſt fit and requiſite) alienated hearts, and
affections: but rather they made choiſe, to follow
the directions of ſome vnnaturall and diſloyall
Bohemians, and of others, either wholly
ſtrangers or relying and hanging meerly vpon
them. From hence it ſucceeded, that in ſtead of
reall ſatisfaction and ſecurity, for that, where
now they were ſo ſtrictly bound and oblieged,
nothing was offered more then promiſes, and
Confirmations in papers and writings. And by
the ſame courſe, they laboured to poſſeſſe themſelues
of the Kingdome by Armes, to ouerthrow
the foundamentall Lawes and Priuiledges of the
Country, to eneruate the obſeruance of them,
(though this ſhould be the only platforme of all
other obligations) to proſtitute thoſe Countries,

which haue a prerogatiue of free Election, to the
yoake of gouernments Hereditary, and to conclude
(at what rate ſoeuer) to compaſſe effects,
conformable to their deſignes, and vnder colour
of puniſhing ſome few nocents, to extirpate and
deſtroy many thouſands of Innocents. Wherein
alſo, they imployed the aſſiſtance of ſtrange Nations,
very ill affected to all Euangelicall profeſſors;
of whom, a great number, and many thouſands
both Foote and Horſe, yea whole Regiments
at a time, haue marched through the
Countries of the Empire, (although, without
conſent of the Electors, the Emperor himſelfe,
hath no Authority nor power) to conduct them
againſt the Eſtates of BOHEMIA, & the Prouinces
annexed, for the wreaking of their euill affection,
& to enrich themſelues, with their ſpoyle.
            But contrariwiſe, if too manifeſt a true intention
to Peace, they had depoſed Armes from the
beginning, remou'd the Authors of theſe troubles,
prouided for the gouernment of the Eſtate,
by the aduiſe and cooperation of the Prouinces,
remidyed ſo many aggrieuances, reſtored the violated
priuiledges, and taken order for their obſeruance,
by meanes of a ſufficient ſecuritie,
(without which all other courſes had bene but
vaine) they might eaſily haue wrought a Peace,

and diuerted greater alterations and changes.
So farre they were, from chooſing ſo expedient
and requiſite a way, that on the contrary, by extreame
violence they enforced the Countries to
haue recourſe, to ſuch a lawfull and ſpeedy defence,
as GOD and Nature alloweth them, to
be their own deliuerers out of theſe extremities;
And to this effect, they erected a generall Confederacie
amongſt them, (but not without Royall
permiſsion for what paſſed) making hereupon
a new Election, for reducing the Eſtate, to a
better order and Gouernment. Of all which
things, the Eſtates of our Crowne of BOHEMIA,
and the Countries incorporate, hauing preſented
the foundamentall cauſes and reaſons, to the
eye and view of the whole world, by Deductions
ſo ample and cleare, any one not tranſported
with paſsion, but impartially waighing all
the reaſons, and Circumſtances, hee may herein,
eaſily and equally be able to yeeld a true iudgement
and cenſure.
            Yet in this place, we meane not to charge our
ſelfe with ſuch Inferences, much leſſe alſo in this
reſpect, heere to inſert the rightes and immunities
of the Realme, aſwell in the point of Free Election,
as otherwiſe: but in this caſe, we referre
all men, to the Information and Iuſtification,

which the Eſtates, haue diuulged and publiſhed.
            True it is, that the Election of a King of Romanes
made not long ſince at Franckfort, fell out
at the ſame time. But ſo likewiſe, we very perfectly
carry in minde, that then we perſwaded,
what poſſibly we could, not to make too much
haſte therein, but before all things, to take counſell,
for the ceſſation of Armes, and to appeaſe
the Warre, which now was kindled in ſo many
partes: cauſing our Councellours to intimate,
how it was not reaſonable, therein to reject (as
they did) the Deputies of the ſaid States of Bohemia,
but rather ſo to ſway and contriue in
thoſe Conſulations, that by their meanes, the
way might be cleare of the Interpoſition, which
then had bene propounded to them. Though
our good intentions therefore tooke no place,
and that we were driuen to let the then preſent
affaires to runne their courſe: Yet in all our
Actes and Decrees, we expreſly by our ſaide
Councellours reſerued to euery one, the priuiledge
to him appertaining, with ſolemne proteſtation
that in nothing we would preiudice
the Eſtates of this Kingdome, cauſing a ſpeciall
care to be had, of all that, which (according to
the iudgement of our owne Conſciences) concerneth
the Liberty, and good of the Empire;

Not as being hereunto inuited by any hope of
particuler profit, ſeeing then we had not the leaſt
apprehenſion of ſuch things as afterwards enſued:
but onely in that we fore-ſaw ſuch an alteration
and change, as euents haue now made manifeſt
and ſo greatly deſiring, that it might haue
bene auoyded and ſhunn'd.
            Seeing therefore the Eſtates of BOHEMIA,
and of the Countries annexed, in their generall
Aſſembly, vnanimouſly, and with one conſent,
haue conferred their Suffrages and Election vpon
our Perſon; We proteſt before GOD, and
with a cleare Conſcience, that we euer hauing
liued content, with the Electorall Dignity, and
ſuch Principalities, and Countries hereditary, as
God imparted to vs, we neuer of our ſelues aſpired
to this ſaid Crowne: and much leſſe attained
we thereunto, by any ſeductions, or ſtratagems,
euen as thoſe Eſtates which Elected vs,
may yeeld vndoubted witnes and teſtimony.
            As likewiſe wee had no reaſon, conſidering
the tempeſtuous, and lamentable Eſtate, of preſent
affaires, but ſurely it had beene farre more
acceptable to vs, to haue ſeene the Peace of that
Kingdom eſtabliſhed, and withall, the Imperiall
tranquillity, preſerued, and aduaunc'd. For we
duely waigh and fore-ſee, the Charge, Perill,

and Care which will redound vnto vs, by the
continuation of Armes, deuaſtation of Countries,
and other War-like Incommodities. And
there's no queſtion but thoſe of riper iudgement
will readily conceiue, that to accept the offer of
a Kingdome, ſtanding in ſuch like tearms, required
a farre more conſtant reſolution, then to refuſe
a peaceable Kingdome for which notwithſtanding,
ſome haue bene ſo highly extolled by
Hyſtoriographers.
            Moreouer we boldly auerre, vpon the ſincerity
of our Conſcience, that if we could haue
found out any other aſſured meanes, which by
our refuſall thereof, might incontinently haue
extinguiſhed the heate of ſo diſaſtrous a Narre,
and entertained and reduced the Peace publicke
to his true State and exiſtance, ſo that the whole
Empire might haue been ſufficiently aſſured and
ſecured thereof: the Honours and intereſts of
this world, ſhould little haue preuailed with vs,
but moſt chearfully in this caſe, we had refuſed
the offer to vs made, and freely imployed our
whole endeauour and power, to obtaine the ſaid
meane, of a generall Peace. Neither did we precipitantly
entrude our ſelues, vnto this ſo waighty
and important an affaire. For firſt, it was after
an humble inuocation of the King of Kinges,

who giues and takes away Crownes to, & from
whome he thinkes beſt, with zealous Supplication
& Prayer (in all this) to direct and gouerne
our Spirit and vnderſtanding: And vppon this,
after hauing communicated with our neareſt &
deareſt Friends, maturely weighing & conſidering
all the circumſtances; we ſenſibly felt and
perceiued in all this proceeding, the miraculous
aſſiſtance and prouidence of God, who, thereto
put his helping and omnipotent hand. Beholde
now therfore, why we neither could nor ought
to oppoſe herein, his diuine & holy will: And ſo
much the leſſe ought we to refuſe this Impoſitiō,
by reaſon we are abſolutely perſwaded in our
owne Iudgement and vnderſtanding, that the
ſaid Eſtates of the Crowne of BOHEMIA, and of
the Countries thereto incorporate, had iuſt cauſe
and reaſon to attempt this mutation, for the reeſtabliſhment
of their libertie and moſt ancient
right of Election, which others went about abſolutely
to diſanull and aboliſh, by diuers ſtratagems
& deuices. And therefore this occaſion is no
leſſe iuſt, pious, & commendable, then eaſie to
be intimated and proued by plentifull examples
of Hiſtories, both ſacred and prophane. In like
manner, we ſeeke not to detaine, or take away
from any other, that which properly belongs to

him, but rather to maintaine and defend thoſe,
which defend the right of Liberty, of Priuiledges,
of royall Grants & Letters Patents, for a free
exerciſe of the religion of the Goſpell, and other
obſeruances, againſt an vniuſt & violent oppreſſion:
and to Protect theſe noble Countries, and
ſo many thouſands of innocent Perſons from
totall ruyne, ſo farre as God ſhall ſtrengthen our
arme, and enlarge vpon vs his Graces and benedictions:
hauing vndouted hope, that whereas
our ſimple intentions ayme in all this, neither at
Voluptuonſnes, nor pleaſures, at Honours, or
worldly riches; but onely at the glory of God,
the comfort of the afflicted, the releaſe of the
oppreſſed, and at the conſolation of ſo many deſolate
harts, whoſe deep ſighs, ſobbes and teares,
vrged vs to a feeling compaſſion, that God our
high and ſoueraigne Conductor will neuer forſake,
and abandon vs, but that reiecting all vaine
thoughts and cogitations of men, he will ſend
down vnto vs from aboue, his benigne aſſiſtance
and ayde, with fit and requiſite meanes herein, to
execute the Arreſt, and Decree, of his ſacred will,
prouidence, and inexhauſtible wiſdome: wherein,
if we ſhould come ſhort of our duty, our conſcience
would not onely be inwardly wounded,
but further we ſhould wilfully drawe vpon our

ſelues Gods Diuine wrath, and puniſhment.
            Moreouer alſo conſidering, that if we had refuſed
this diuine Vocation & Dignity, we could
not poſſibly haue auoyded (eſpecially, with all
thoſe that make profeſſion of the Goſpell) the
imputation and blame, of ſo much blood conſequently
ſhed, and of all the ſpoyle and waſte
made in the ſame Countries: As alſo if they of
the contrary party, had attayned to the end of
their deſignes (which was to ſuppreſſe the Bohemian
Nation) it would further mightily haue
encouraged them, to employ both againſt our
ſelues, and all the other Euangelicall Eſtates of
the Empire, the Armes they had in hand, to effect
that, whereunto the boyling malice of their
hearts, hath hitherto excited them, both couertly
and openly, nay by written impreſſions, divulged
and publiſhed, not ſparing little Infants,
no not their owne ſometimes, nor illuſtrious Families,
with their Countries & Subiects, as their
comminations haue threatned in diuers partes:
Adding further, that if there had not beene preſent
prouiſion made, and that by a preualent
meanes, for the Kingdome of Bohemia, and the
Countries thereunto annexed, which are one of
the principall members of the Empire, and as it
were a ramper againſt all externall Nations:

they had bene in great danger to haue fallen into
a Strangers hand, and finally to haue bene entirely
cut off, from the body of the Germaine
Empire, or at leaſt reduced to ſuch a Condition,
that they muſt needs haue bin the Authors of
great Inconueniences, directly preiudicial to the
Electors, Princes, and States Euangelicall adiacent:
Theſe circumſtances, I ſay conſidered, we
could finde out no other more conuenient way,
then the preſent reſolution we haue vndertaken.
Whereunto wee were likewiſe obliged more
nearly, by the Faith, and fidelity which we owe
to the ſacred Empire, through the peculiar intereſt
of our Electorall Family, and Principality of
the ſuperiour Palatinate, and by the hereditary
Alliances, which the ſaide Principality from all
Antiquity, hath held with the Crowne of Bohemia:
for Protection and preſeruation whereof,
the fore-mentioned reaſons to watch the more
circumſpectly, hoping that euery man well inform'd
of the Truth, and free from all paſſion,
will rightly iudge of our Actions, and no wayes
ſiniſterly enterpret them.
            And this was the reaſon, why in Gods name,
for the aduancement of his Glory, for the Comfort
of the poore afflicted, for the preſeruation
of common proſperity, and Liberty, and other

very important occaſions, at the humble, and
inſtant requeſt of the Eſtates of the Kingdome of
BOHEMIA and the Countries incorporate, diuers
times reiterated, both by writing and Embaſſies
directed to vs, as alſo by ſerious remonſtrances
to vs intimated: that at laſt we approued
of the Election of our perſon vnanimouſly
made, and accepted the Crowne, and Gouernement
of the Kingdome of BOHEMIA, and of the
Countries annexed. And to this end, we together
with the Princeſſe of great BRITAINE, our
deare Spouſe, haue tranſplanted our ſelues vnto
this City of PRAGVE, where with the common
Conſent and Aſſiſtance of the ſaid Eſtates, we
haue beene ſolemnly Crowned, and with great
popular applauſe, collocated in the Royall
Throne, which God by his omnipent arme, graciouſly
confirme, and grant vs this fauour, ſo to
begin and continue our Raigne, that the Kingdome
of Ieſus Chriſt, may ſtill more and more,
be augmented in vs, and our Subjects, and they
happily, and long time, maintained in true Peace
and felicitie.
            So that once more we proteſt before God and
the whole world, that from this time forward,
we are firmely reſolu'd, not to perſecute or moleſt,
or ſuffer to be perſecuted, or moleſted any

perſon whoſoeuer, for matter of Religion, no
not they, which profeſſe themſelues to be of the
Romane Church, neither to trouble, or diſturbe
them in the exerciſe of their Religion, ſo they
liue conformably to the Lawes of the States, Edicts
of Pacification, Royall Letters, and to former
publicke Grants paſſed in fauour of Religion.
As to ſpeake truth, a good number of the
ſaide Romane Catholicks within the Kingdome
of Bohemia and the Prouinces annexed, haue
voluntarily expos'd and offer'd themſelues by
Oath, and Subſcription, to that common defenſiue
Confederation Inſtituted between the ſaide
Kingdome, and Countries, and by yeelding vs
their due homage, incluſiuely haue approued of
our Election and Coronation.
            We in like manner are determin'd, to deuice
all expedient and poſſible meanes, not onely in
ſhort time, to recouer by the grace of God, tranquillitie
and Peace, in our Kingdome of Bohemia
and the Countries annexed; but further entertain,
& plant, ſome better correſpondicie between
the Eſtates and the Empire, and to preuent
all other Iuconueniences, ſo that the ſaide
Eſtates, each one in his particuler, be mutually
hereunto affected, and that no obſtacle be interpos'd,
nor occaſion giuen of greater troubles.
            
               
And that the ſinceritie of our intentions, may
more manifeſtly appeare, wee will euer haue a
care, by all poſſible meanes, to embrace Amitie,
correſpondencie, and friendly Intelligence with
all Potentates, Electors, Princes, and Eſtates of
Chriſtendome, but more eſpecially with thoſe
that border and confine vpon vs: We preſuming
no leſſe of them, that they will reciprocally
teſtifie the like to vs, aſſiſting vs with their
Counſels, and performances, againſt all thoſe
who out of ſome contray Diſſeigne, would hoſtilely
attempt againſt vs, our Kingdome and
