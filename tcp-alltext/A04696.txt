These thingis whē ye se done / thē let vs lament & a knowelege the wrath of God powered forth ayenst the synnes of mankinde. But yet the immense mercy and goodnes of God / at some certain ceason geueth a litle breathing space to his chirche / making the fyerce seas cawme for a litle tyme, leste thei shuld let the halciōs to hatcheforthe their chikēs. For because therfore / that God hathe geuen vs in this region a litle quyetnes / as it were the halcions. 14. dayes reste / whiles the gospel might shyne forthe: let vs render to him thankis / and withe very godly prayers aske tranquilite & peace, that namely ye youghth might be godly brought vp & taught: and also that honest & godly gouerners and techers might gouerne and defende the disciplyne. For al be it great difficulties and many sharp stormes haue euermore grated vpō the chirche to excercise hir faithe / yet do experience

shew vs / & God afore did speke it, The last olde age of the worlde to be micheThe last dayes be ꝑellous. more miserable ād sorowful then the former ages. Nether / trwly / be these predicciōs ād prophecies setforth in vaine. For God wold haue them read, that the godly hertes might prepare them selues vnto the manyfold perels ād batails / lerne whiche is the very chirche of God / in whiche the voice of the gospel of the sone of god sown / thei might knowe that same to be the chirche which shal fight with the ennemies of cryst / which by his death hath for vs apeaced the wrath of the eternal father / and now rysen raigneth to glorifie his chirche with lyfe euerlasting. Thei mought knowe that these sorowful miserable calamitis shall haue an ende / euen then / when the chirche stered vp ayene from dethe shal be beutifyed with glori euerlasting. Of theise thingis forasmiche as God himself very largely premonissheth vs in this boke writen of Daniel / and hath constituted euen the ordir of the tymes and ages / apointing in a maner the very limites ād bowndes of the world / sewerly the reading of this boke must nedis be profitable to goodCap. 12. men. Also the aungel himself in the ende of this boke exhorteth this laste age to

this lesson where he saith. Daniel thou shalt stonde in thy course or lotte into the ende / that is. Thou shalt do this office. Thou shalt teche and confirme the godly. And cryst himself doth not onely deduce vs vnto the reading of this boke / but also commandeth vs attentyuely to consyder of how waighty and great thinges Daniels prophecye techeth vs / saying / whoso read it / let him take hede / whiche saying gretely moueth vs to reade this boke the gladlyer with the more diligence. Besydis this / it is ye very breif cōpendious some and reherceall of the storyeA monarchie is one empire ouer all the worlde. of the hole worlde / euen from the firste monarchye to the laste / setting befor our eyes the cleare examples of the good ād euilprinces and rulers.
            Of the profite of this boke / it shalbe spoken more here aftir. But to inuyte all men vnto the reading of Daniel / I haue added breif notes. For the sayingis of the prophets be so plentuouse that thet cannot be all at once out drawne. Wherfore al be it these my bare and sclender cō
               mentaris be not able to satisfie the amplitude of ye mater / yet it profiteth to put men in minde of the cheif maters / and as it were with my fynger to point them to those places which the diligent readers

being studiouse / may by their owne meditacion afterward turne to / & behold them nyerer. There be verely in Daniel many stories which require an interpretor. And in these / I think my labour to profire the yougth. Whiche my labours I permitte to the iugement of the godly and lerned / which shal iuge of this my boke both iently and louingly. And because it is comō
               ly vsed to dedicate bokis to princes and rulers / which vsage may haue many probable and graue causes, My mynde is to dedicate vnto you (most noble prīce) this my labour and litle boke / that when I hear your good will towerd the chirche of cryste and to honeste studies, to be praysed / I wolde therfore declare also this your vertewe vnto the students / exhorting them to loue ād reuerēce godly princes / and in their praiers commende them with their comons vnto God. Great is the infirmite of man / greter is the fury of the deuil / which brening in the hatered of god / as he thrusted out our first parēts to fall into these miserable sorouful calamities / euen so studieth he perpetually to hurte Crystes chirch. And cheifly he layeth awaite at the higheste head therof / & of our lyfe: nether is there any so great wisedom which can wel perceyue howe great

perel there is in euery gouernance and regiment.
            Wherfore all princes conioined vnto the chirche of God / ought with the praiers of all faithful to be holpen / that God whiche geueth helthe vnto kings wold once rule their counsess and bowe their myndes & their enforcements vnto their owne and to the publik sauing helthe. Of this thig the readers shuld be monisshed in this kinde of dedicacions. For the reding of noble and clear examples / shuld exhort the same princes thēselues vnto modesty moderaciō / & to pyte / not to slaye

I ther fore besech God hertely the father of Ie su Cryste our delyuerer to preserue you / & so to gouern you / that your gouernance be happye & prosperouse to you / to your countrye / & to the chirche of cryste / euen the very trewe comonaltie of all.

For these causes shall I recite breifly / as it wer the titles herein contained, whiche shal shew you what vtilite shall come to you by reding

thys holy boke and diuyne Prophete.
            Firste think you thus of the hole boke. That the story of Daniel is a testimony of the preseruacion of the chirche beutified  with great glory / euen then when it semeth almost extincte and destroid. It techeth vs therfor the chirche bothe to be chastised and skourged / ād anon aftir hir crosse / to be restored to glori. It testifieth also the chirche / not by manis counsel / powre / strength / ordināces / noractis / but by the sin helpe of god / euen from the begining to this daye / to be defended, preserued and encreaced. It putteth vs also in mynd of the promises of god to be performed to hys chirche / although it be done aftir a nother waye then we can conceiue. As when it was promised to the tribe of Iuda, The scepter nor teacher to be taken awaye from it vntil that sauiour Sylo come: wher of the kinges of Iuda were so bolde / that they so oft rebelling / moste proudly and cruelly they resisted and dampned the prechinge of Ieremye concerninge the destruccion of their cite temple / and kingdom. As wold nowe men resiste and destroye him that shuld preache to emprours and to kinges saing. Excepte ye repent and receiue the gospell nowe offred you / the turke shall

                captiuite had their honor / where god stered vp prophets and orned his chirche with great glory, yea and euen the haithen gentiles did he adioyne vnto the felowship of his owne chirche / so that there was then a gloriouse conuersion of the haithen vnto God / as I praye God there may be of the turkes and iewes once vnto owr trewe cristen religion.
            Secondarily ye shal obserue the testimonis of Messias owr king Cryste. For  as the other prophets were cheifly stered vp that by them the promises of Cryste shuld be spred the wyder / euen so it behoued Daniel to do the same office: and that bi many wais / and in many visions. For he prohecyed of his birth telling the yere and tyme therof / and of his passion a

            Thirdely ye shal note the order / of the. 4. Monarchies / which order is here expressed / that the very tyme wherin god wold haue cryste borne shuld be knowne / and the tyme of the general resureccion of the dead / and the iugement shulde be signifyed and foresene. So that Daniel prophecieth certainly of these troublouse laste blodye dayes and persecucion nowe of late begunne; which all / Cryste with his laste coming now at hād, shall of.
            Fowerthly ye shal note the places of repentance / of faithe / and of the iustificacion  by faith onely.
            Fyftely / ye shall note the examples of good and euil kingis.

Agenst which prophane fantasies and idle imaginacions we must lern in the gospel / god to be worshiped in spirit / and faith onely in cryst to iustifye. Ayenst the epicures that denye the resurreccion / and soules to be immortal / here we haue a cleare testimonye of the resuscitation of the dead to come, where the vngodly shalbe punysshed with payns perpetuall / and the godly endewed with ioye eternall. The professours of this doctryne shal aryse ayen vnto lyfe. By the doctrine of cryste / of the prophets / and apostles, professed and receyued / the trwe chirche is

Men must be prudent in diuiding and receiuing the prophets documents. Thei must loke whiche parte containeth the laws / whiche preche the promises & the gospell. For vnto these principalls allother things muste be referred. Note also whiche parte declareth the documents. As what can be said clerelyer and euidētsier ayenst the iews / then that Daniel af firmeth cryste to must haue had ben borne during yet the comō weal of Moses? Wherfore that horrible destrucciō of hierusalem and ruyne of the hole londe of Iuda nowe paste. 1474. yeres / do testify cryste to be borne / & it refuteth their madde and cursed pertinacye. Here must we note the lessons of the trwe inuocacion & worship of God. As whē Daniel prayeth / he aknowlegeth to God onely his owne and their synnes for whom he prayeth / & asketh of God onely delyuerance in the

faith and confidence of his mercye / adding by expresse name, For the lorde cryste his sake / that is for Messias his sake promised.

For the voice of the holy watcher was ye sentence and decree of the most hygh god against the kynge / which vseth his aungels thus to serue kynges and all good men / which are sayd to come downe that they shulde knowe manifestly whether ther were so great arrogancye, securite

               And euen in the same houre thereText. apered ye fyngers of a manis hande wrytinge agaynst the candell in the whight parget of the wall of the kynges palace / The kingis spiritualty is called to court the kynge himself beholding the fyngers so wryting. Then was ye kynges face paal and his cogitacions so ferefully troubled him that the ioyntis of his hippes and knees folldened downe double vnder him. Then the kynge cryed commanding his spiritualtye / his wyse men, enchaunters, desteny tellers / and sothe sayers of Chaldey to be brought vnto him, thus speking these wordes to the wyse men of Babylon. Who so euer shall reade this wryting / & tell me what it meaneth / he shallbe cled with purpure and shall haue a cheine of golde about his necke / and he shalbe the thirde in my realme. Then came all the kynges lerned wysemen which nether coude reade the wrytinge nor tell the meaning therof to the kynge. Wherfore

kynge Belsazar was the more vehemently troubled / in so miche that his chere was all changed and his princes and nobles greuously astonned.
               Euen in the same houre wherin his vngodlynes was rype / & he blasphemed god / the lorde wolde glorifye his owne name in that all men shuld se the kyngdom of Babylon by the diuine iugement to be subuerted / & himself to be the changer and translator of kyngedoms and tymes / euen in the same houre wherin the kynge thought himself most sewer & most beloued with his goddis for so worshipping them being in the middis of welthy plesures / was this heuey sentēce wryten and geuen forth agaynst him. Before the sentence pronounced and ratifyed / there was tyme and place to repente him: butMat. 25 now ye gatis shut vp / in vayne do ye folyshe virgins aske oyle / bringingforth their laumpes with knockinge.

But none of them might helpe nor counforte him or swage his sorowe. He promiseth fayer / he threteneth bitterly / but all helpeth not /

Mene therfore signifieth the tyme of the mutacion? And the tother two word is signifye the maner of the mutacion / not onely of this kyngdom / but of all the kyngdome of the worlde at all tymes, so to come to passe by Gods decreed will. Also the repeticion of this worde Mene hath a greate pythe / signifyinge the tyme and houre offiche decreed iugements of god certaynly and sodenly to come vpon them. As sayde Moses to the Corites. And as in this oure tyme saythNum. 16 Draconites / was that tyraunt depriued his gouernāce at his rype tyme / when he sayd: that he had seuer God in heauen to haue bene dead then his owne wyked felowe.

Well therfore prayeth the Psalme agenst siche blasphemouse tyrants that fewe and shorte might be their dayes / for they be very Iudases. Wherfore / as thispsal. 108 worde Mene warneth tyrants of Gods heuey iugement hanging ouer their headis / that they shuld repent and be monisshed according to the. 2. psal. as was Ezechias and so obtained. xv. yeres addid to his lyfe / so it counforteth / the oppressed of tyrants that we shulde suffre paciently and endure constantly for that the Psal. sayth.

               The tother two wordis Thekel and Vpharsin tell vs the plages and maner of their coming. Thekel signifyeth Beltsazars kyngdome to be now wayed / bought and solde from him. The thirde worde. Vpharsin signifyed his kyngdome to be diuided from that nacion vnto ye kynges of Mede and persie. For the first plage of emperour / kynges / princes and preistes is to lose their auctorite and name as hath the psal. Contempt is powered forth vpō

            But wherfore did Darius subscribe so sone to this decree and deuillissh acte? verely his spiritualty had bewitched him thus to do. So it was that daniel was in fauour and herde of, bothe Cyrus and Da rius but especially of Cyrus to whom he cleaned most for the prophecies that wēt vpon him out of Isaye to be the restorerIsay. 42 &. 45. of his peple. And Cyrus had daniel in highe honour. Nowe was Cyrus but yong whose father was not kinge / and Darius was sage, olde / borne his father being a kinge. And as daniel exceded all the gouerners and bisshops in auctorite, so begā Cyrus to excell Darium in glorye. Nowe did his flaterers by the counsell of his sothe sayers and spiritualty perswade

This dissimilitude and vnlyke state or condicion

This example therfore monissheth emprours & kinges to be wyse in obseruing siche deceytes and namely in their owne lawes artycles actis and proclamacions to be publisshed / lest thei vsurpe gods honour.

And as these subtile charmere with their crafty courtyers did greuously sinne for that / so deceitfully and subtyly thei toke an occasion / and

with so glitering a pretence of their dewty and vertewe: layd this fraudelent beyght for the king and religion / euen so sinned the king in that he suffred himself to be perswaded of these false hypocrits & flaterers / all benefits to be asked of him self as of a god. For the simple olde king sawe it not / that whyls he loked for honour aboue and ayenst Cyrus / he prohibited the inuocacion of gods name and casted down daniel into the perell of his lyfe.

For before him am I founde innocent / nether ayenst the / oh kinge haue I cōmitted any fawlte. Then was the king excedengly ioifull and commanded daniel to be plukt out of the denne / in whom now plukt out, there was no hurte founde done to him of the lyons because he beleued in his god. Then at the kings commandemēt were his accusers & enimies brought forth / which wt their chyldren and wyues were throne into yt lyons whom ere they coulde come to the floer of the denne / the lyons toke them / & broke all their bones.
               The cruell vnreasonable lyons were meker to Daniel then his owne felowes. The merciable kinge gote mercy of god and repented: he departed from these his wyked counselerswith great heuines / he

refused all meat mirthe and solace consyderinge his so faithfull a counseller and seruaunt of god thus to be entreated.

The example of Darius first teacheth the office of a crystiane to repent, to beleue, and to aknowleg his synnes aftir the lawe and gospell / and to saue the godly & dampne the vngodly. The kinge without meat and sleape all the daye and night continueth. For the lawe is as it were a fyery veper euer bighting / euen yt comminacion of god saying: I shall viset thy synnes: for the kinge ayenst his faith and consciēce had commanded daniel to be destroyd for kepinge the first precept of god. He thus commanded it / not as the king and lorde / but as an idolater & murtherer of innocents. But the kinge to see daniel a lyue conceiued no lesse▪ miracle in his conscience then was the delyuerance of daniels bodye. Greate therfore is the ioye of ye faithfull / aftir their crosse thus to se god to preserue & glorifye them.

he is the lyuing god abyding for euer and euer / for his kingdom shall neuer be destroid but his dominion euer must endure / who helpeth and delyuereth▪ he sheweth his wondrefull miracles in heuen and erthe whiche delyuered daniel from the lyons. Aftir this daniel was highly promoted in the kingdom of Darii and in the realme of Cyrithe persiane.
               See how God will haue the victorye? see vnto what ende God hath permitted these iniuries to daniel. The kinge wold be puft vp with glory. His diuines & nobles flater him / the iuste is casten to the lyons / & god the iuge of all is not knowen But now at last his glory is declared clerer then the sonne. And the kinge with publyk rescript and open recātacion confessinge his synne, setteth forth the glory of god. Nebucadnezar commanded that the name of God in nowyse shuldbe blasphemed. Darius here willeth it to be feared and worshipped and all men to tremble and feare at the face of the god of daniel. As though he shulde saye: Let oure actis & lawes / decrees or proclamacions whether thei be of myself or of any other made / bynde noman / if thei commande any thinge ayenst the god of daniel. For myselfe at last haue I lerned wherto lawes

be holy and when thei shuld be dispensed with / Miche more iust it is that God be rather obeyed then man. I am but a man mortall dust and asshes. It is God that lyueth for euer which punissheth and rewardeth. His face feare ye / him serue and reuerence. He lyueth and raigneth present when men thinke him to be absent. And awaketh when he is thought to sleape. Who wold not haue despayered of daniels lyfe▪ And yet so / for his faith is he delyuered from the lyons hongry mouthes / let vs folowe thinges certain and leaue lyinge vanities. Many miracles hath god done in heuen and earth / but of this one maye we be taught his power and goodnes. Now the king rebuketh his errour and the holy prophet before contempned / he exalteth into greate glory. And taketh daniel with him into the lande of Mede leauing Cyrum and his sone Cambysem at Babylon. Thus wolde god aftir the crosse glorifye his seruant.

Then yet I loked / and so I sawe another lyke a leoparde hauinge. 4. swyft winges

            This vision sene in the night with so many cruell beastis so fyghting vpon the sea is ferefull / signifying the chirche of God to suffre affliccions and greuouse persecuciōs vnder the. 4. monarchies laboring in the derk ignorance of god & his worde.

But Iohn & daniel saye that he shulde putforth his hornes vnder the winges of all the other crysten kinges euen amonge crysten men in the chirche of cryst / in crystis name against cryst his name and his faithfull to make bataill. Here it apereth Iohn to say the same that daniel saith / but yet in other wordis. For where as in this place daniel sawe a beast armed with. 3. grete teth deuouring and consuminge all / the same did Ioan see takinge his tyrannye / cruell power / his prowd seat and his mischeuouse maiesty of the dragon ye deuyll / beinge a blody murtherer and a lyer from the beginning.

And it is to be feared / lest the Turke be also this two horned seculare Anticryst ascended out of the erth. For I dare say: That rather then ye gospell shuld be frely receyued and the pope with his spirituall sourgens be brydled or suppressed with ye worde of God / their state and lyuing corrected & reformed there at / the emperours and kinges crystened / consenting and cō

                  Before this / daniel sawe the last Monarchie which was the empyre of Rome to be diuided into many kingdōs as perchaunce into France / Portugal / Spayne Pole / Denmarke / Englande / Hyerlande Scotland / Napels / Boheme and Hungarye / which be the. x. hornes / and sene of Iohn / by the. x. hornes / helping the read Romishe beast to suppresse the kingdomeApoc. 17. of cryst. For by the popis policies / thus was the noble empyre skatered into hir owne destruccion / that this lytle horne might haue the proye and preeminence ouer the hole empyre. This lytle horne saith daniel grewe vp amonge these. x. kingdoms or. x. seculare hornes / by whose ayed ryches and auctorite / the pope wt his prelates ascended from poore buggerly beggerly fryers and flaterers vnto siche an imperial maiestye aboue emperours and kinges. And here daniel seeth. 3. hornes smyten of from these so many kinges by the lytle horne / That is / the Anticrysten pope to make weake and feble whatsoeuer emperour and kinge he listed / depose them at his plesure and to translate ye empyre and kingdoms into his owne nettis to vse and occupy them himself. Or if ye will take the. iii. hornes prescisely for. 3 empires or kingdoms falsely vsurped of

the pope / beholde vpon his head the tripleThe. iii. hornes casten downe of the pope. crone infaming himself to be the throerdowne and destroyer or robber of thre great kingdoms / yea and euen the subuerter of the hole Romane empyre. Netheles his flaterers yet make him beleue that he is emperour and kinge ouer haeuen / ouer ye erth and of purgatory / yea and ouer hell and deuyll to. But this is trewth. He once translated the empyre from the east to the weest / and from the Frenche men to the Germans. And now contendeth he to translate it to the Turke / which shalbe his last translacion & his owne destruccion with the heuey mutacions of all the west kingdoms / yf he can bring his blody purpose to passe.
               For Daniel saith this lytle horne to haue eyes lyke manis eyes / that is to be prudent and polytyk to loke for his owne ease & lucre. For he thinketh to gett more vnder the Turke then vnder the gospell yf it be receyued of the emperours and of all the crysten kings as he feareth it wilbe. Iohn geueth him hornes lyke a lambe That is to saye / he shall do all his fraudelent featis vnder a meruelouse pretence of holynes innocencye and mekenes. For he shall wryte himself the most holy / when he shall shewe himself by his dedis

to be ye most wyked prophane cruell wolue comen in shepis clothes / for vnder ye tytle of Papa: father of fathers he is ye most marciles tyrant of all tyrants / vnder the name of Summi or Maximi pontificis / that is of the most hyghe and greatest vigilant watcher and ouerseer of his flok / he is the most negligent idest idoll & dome dogge / vnder ye name of pastor / which is a flok feder / he is the most pestelent poysoner.

                  Also it is to be noted. That bothe Daniel and Ioan saith he hath a mouthe speking great blaphemies / or prowd arrogancies ayenst god / he shall speke as did the dragon euen blaphemies ayenst god / as did he that said I will ascēde and belyke the most hyghest god. And as did the serpent perswade Eue to not beleue god but to thinke the most trwe god to be a dissembler or a lyer. The turke and Mahumet speke gret blaphemies ayenst god in their alkaron. But owr litle whore of Rome & hir cardinalls bishops and prechers speke the moste gretest and greuoust blasphemies of all and themselues defende them with fyer and cause their seculare anticristis to defend them with swerde. Thei be not ashamed to wryte and teche the pope to be of syke powr with cryste / the pope cannot erre / the pope to be the supreme head and spowse of the chirche and vicare of cryste. And because he hathe the emperiall powr / he may distribute the kingdoms and ryches of the worlde as he lyst and because he is the hyghest bysshop he maye geue all the chirches benifices as cardinallships bysshopryks and benefices to whom he lyste / and he bosteth the gospell to be subiecte to his interpretacion and vnderstanding / yea & except (saye

He bosteth himfelf to make lawes and articles of owr faithe and to adde mo sacraments to them then cryst made / and to consecrate and to make the body of cryste / to sende awaye the substance of the bread / the accidents as the whigtnes rowndes / tast & other qualities & quātities remayning.

                   and siche other. All these blaphemies speketh he vnder lambes skinnes in an innocent holy pretence, hauinge hornes lyke a lambe / he will apere humble lyke any other inferiour man & yet shameth he not to open his mouth to speke greuouse blasphemies ayenst god and his peple.

And anon as he was set downe to iugement / the bokis were layd open.
               Hytherto ye see all daniels vision verefyed concerninge these. 4. beastis and monarchies and this lytle horne / so that we nede not to seke any other exposicion of daniels and Ioans visions / then the dayly experiences in beholding the face of the worlde which is a playn commentary

vpon them both. And of the present verefying hytherto and fulfilling of these visions / we maye be certain and sewer that the rest of their prophecies shall verely come to passe shortly / ere these seatis be sett downe / and these forked horned kings trones be taken awaye. For verely cryst is euen now preparinge these iugement seatis / to destroye these wyked Anticrysten hornes & to cast them into perpetuall fyery tormēts / and to enbrace his chosen thus cruelly of these beastis oppressed receiuing vs vnto perpetuall ioye For this is / lo / the ende of this tragedye / thus gothe out their playe euen then whē thei thinke to be but in ye middis of their mater. For daniel and Ioan both knyt vp Anticrystis raigne in half a tyme or in half an hebdomade conforting vs in that they shalbe shortly taken awaye / & shall not vexe vs so long as they thinke to do / wytnes the psal. But thou oh lorde shaltpsal. 54. pluk them downe into the pitte of death / euen these blody men & crafty deceiuers which shall not come to half the dayes wherein they thinke to lyue to execute their mischeif. And agene. When thoupsal. 91. seest these synfull blody men florishe lyke flouers / then be thou sewer / themal to florisshe for no nother ende then for euer to

be smyten downe. And therfore sayth danielVse. 12. aftir some textis. He shall take his plesure for a tyme for tymes and but for half a tyme. And Ioan windeth vp the halfe tyme in half an hebdomade / which be. iii. ycares and an half / for God is not angrywith vs always / but in the middis of their wyked course his aduersaries shall fall downe into their owne perpetuall destruccion and payns. For daniel sawe the dayes of oure tribulacion shortened for our counforte / and for their confusion that trouble vs. There shalbe no full ende of oure persecucions and tribulacions nor of the Turkis crueltye vntyll cryste sett downe his seatis to iugement wherin we shalbe blessed and the vngodly persewers of crystis chirche dampned for euer as Paul conforteth the martyres of Thessalonie. And therfore ye prophets vse but fewe wordis / for ther is no worde2. thes. 1. &. 2. of god so lytle / but it is mightiet then all the worlde / nether any so lytle a letter in the prophetis which sauoreth not ether of the lawe or of the gospel. Wherfore because it is certayn / that of daniel the descripcion of the iugemēt / is here setforth into the consolacion of the crystians and into the feare of the Anticrysten / we will (that the troubled chirche might see hyr

confort) saye our mynde breifly according to the scriptures of the iugement of cryst▪
               
               These seatis are sayd to be sette / for ye
                  Mat. 19. confort of them which yet suffer for the gospels sake vnder these horned kingdōs as cryst tolde his apostles sayng: ye shall sitte vpon the twelue seatis to iuge the twelf trybis of Israel. And yf we suffer with cryst / we shall raigne with cryst.Rom. 8. Cryst is called here the great aged God and man / for he is an eternall sauior promised in paradise before he was borne. To sitte / perteineth to cryste the iuge as in Matth. 25. Be shall sitt in the trone of his glorye / & before him shall all nacionsPaul Ro viii. be brought. Forthermore / a iuge hath a double office (as saith Peter) to punisshe the euyll and to defende the good. Wherfore here doth Daniel by the whightneshis whit clothes. of cryste his vesture and purenes of his heare describe his confortable defence of the good men. For as he in his whight clothes clarifyed in his transfiguracion and also rysing from death apered ioyouse and glad to the heuey penitēt synners / euen so shall he make glad his glorifyed chosen once rysen from death with this voyce: Come ye yt blessed of my father &c. Siche a beutye of the chirche in cryst is paynted also in the. 45. psal. but it is not

sene in this miserable vale of weping teres / as Ioan sayth / we be not yet sene as we shalbe. The heuey vengeance of theRis flā
                     mey trone what it signifieth. Ioel. 2. euyll men is paynted by ye flammye trone & long fyery beames procedinge therout. For deuouering fyer shall go before him / and a burninge flame aftir him (Ioele to wytnes) and as cryst arysing was sene so terrible to ye kepers of his sepulcre / euen so shall he apere a ferrefull iuge to all vngodly in the last iugement saynge / auoyd fro me ye cursed into eternall fyer. Also ye multitude of mynisters is taken for his infinite noumber of aungels as Mat. 25. saith: all the aungels shall come downe with him. To sit in iugement is to rendre to euery one accordinge to their dedis as speketh Paul: Nether is it any thing els / the bokes to be opened / then that Paul saith. In that daye god shall laye open ye
                  Rom. 2. secrete hid thingis of menis hertis by Iesu1. Cor. 4. cryst according to my gospell. Wherfore there is no difference betwixt daniel and Paul saue that as they both wrote not in one tyme so did they not with the same wordis expresse the same iugement of cryst.
            
            
               Then I behelde / namely for theText. voyce of those stoute great word is whichApoc. 17. 16. &. 20. the horne spake / and I loked so longe tyll

the beast was taken awaye and his body slayne and the beast casten into the fyer. But the 
                     •
                   other beastis yet left deposed their power / & to them was there graunted longer to lyue vnto their prefixed tyme.
               Hytherto haue we treated the descripcion of the iugement into the consolacion3. documents. of the chirche militant. Now shall ye lerne. iii. thinges in the declaracion of this prophecye. First he teacheth vs not to be offended / nor in oure trouble to cast away all hope / seing these anticrystis the pope with his coniured hornes / and the Turke with his Mahumete thus to prospere in their mischeif. Secondly he therfore threateneth death and destruccion to all these anticrysten beastis. At last he conforteth the chirche beinge yet as a shepe apointed to the slaughter howse with a newe descripcion of crystis coming. For what (thinke ye) shalbe the ende of this oure troublose tragedy? shall we be thus euer persecuted? shall these sharpe & heuey hornes always goore vs thus cruelly? will not god come once downe and declare his rightwysenes? will he neuer auenge the iniuriouse oppressions & persecuciōs of his iuste and chosen chirche? Aftir oure many and greuouse afflicciōs

daniel seeth a newe and greate change. I loked / sayth he / namely for that arrogant great voyce of so blasphemouse wordis which the horne spake. I merueled whether god wolde leaue so great wykednes vnpunisshed and wolde neglect the glory of his name. He wolde not so long suffre it in Sennacherib / he punisshed it anon in Pharao / he was anō euen within Goliath and with all his blasphemers in tymes past. And shall he now suffer thus long his chosen derely beloued to be thus cruelly for his sake brent and slayne and his gloriouse name thus so spightfully blasphemed? Daniel loked vpon ye long pacient suffering of God / not once turninge his eyes from him vntyll he sawe his iugement at hande / and the iugement seatis set downe. We may not therfore behold the onely tribulacions of the iust which may sone thrust vs into desperacion: but we must sett the iustice of god before oure eyes / & wayt for the apointed happy helpe in tyme of tribulacion, promised vs and the greate rewardis prepared for all that iustely fight in his cause. Daniel merueled to what ende the false doctryne and prowd wordis of anticryst wold come and where at last he shulde abyde. He sawe that in the last ende of ye worlde

these Anticrystis shulde haue in their affayers great prosperouse successe the emperours and kinges to bring home gloriouse and happye victories: the pope to gather home great ryches noble victores hyghe and solempne tytles, and his doctryne and lawes to be fered greatly and receyued ouer all crystendom / emperours and kings mightely to assist and defende them. He sawe the Turkis dominion to sprede mightely and his doctryne to take place, wyde and euery where. With these prosperouse successes / many men / what for weaknes / what for hypocrisye / what for fere and the anguisshe of their persecucions, be auerted from the gospell of peace vnto these anticrysten actis / articles false doctryne / popish rytes / supersticioꝰ ceremonies and vnto their deuyllish tradicions and many vnto Mahumets mischeif. Wherfore he premonissheth vs to be consiant / and to hold fast in mynde the last iugement / that is / the glorye of the godly to come and the paynes eternall of the vngodly / so resting vpon godis worde in oure feruēt prayers that for the gretenes of the euerlasting ioyeand felicite / we maye nothing fere ne regard the infinite troubles of all oure lyfe. Hytherto loked Paul when he sayd: I thinke not theRom. 8.
                  
sufferings of this lyfe to be wortheily cō
                  2. Cor. 4 pared to the glory to come which shall be reueled in vs. Now will we speake of the cōminacions cast vpon these beastis.
               Where Daniel saith / I loked vntyll I sawe the beast slayne and his body smyten downe dead and casten into the fyer / and the power of the other beastis there left / taken awaye / he threateneth not onely to this last beaste the empyre of Rome with his spirituall Pope his hole bodye and all their. x. helpinge hornes agaynst the lorde and his anointed, euerlastinge death and destruccion / but he also in these wordis threteneth the same miserable ende vnto ye Turkish or Saracenik kingdom / for the lambe shall haue the victory as it is wryten in the Apoca. 17. &. 19. chap And I sawe the beast and the kings of ye erth and their hoostes gathered togyther to make warre with the kinge of kinges and with his hoost / but the beast with his false prophetes were taken &c. where Ioan expowneth ye bodye of the beast to be his holy cardinals bisshops / doctours / prethers / his cananized saynts and miracle makers to deceyue the peple / and all the smered preistis hauinge the beastis mark which haue worshiped the image of this beast. Also in the. xx. chap. The deuyll is

casten into a ponde of fyer and brims

                  on where the beast and hir false prophet

                   shalbe tormented daye and night for euer This beast so perissheth that there foloweth nomo / aftir him. But the rest which haue their powrs taken from them / or depose them / shall yet lyue with their posterite folowinge them for a lytle tyme not so sodenly to fall as their head hornes. For the laste of all is this fowrth in the which aryseth this lytle horne with his impes and in which the Turke also persecuteth vntyll himself with Mahumet and their hole anticristen bodye be slayne. In the other kingdoms yet left, aftir ye Turkis and popis be in destroyinge / allthough the kinges dayly perish and lese their dominiōs / yet shall their subiectes obtayne fauor with their ouercomers and lyue their apointed yeares / but when the iuge shall sittdowne / both the euyll kinges with their euyll subiectis shalbe casten into the pitt of fyer. Wherfore ye aungell e
                     •
                  powneth it sainge: And they shall take awaye his power, scater, and desiroye it in the ende prefixed of God. And this is the porcion of the cuppe of the vngodly which had leyfer folowe antichrist then cryst. For God shall / as sayth Paul / take awaye all princelynes, powr, and might.

Wherfore this comminacion of god prophecieth vnto all the kinges and peple from the beginnig of the worlde fighting agyenst the gospell of the almighty God and of oure sauiuor Iesu / euerlasting fyer onlesse they repent as the. 2. psalme warneth them.
               Also (lest any man shuld thinke the lytle pore lost shepe of cryst, euen the chirche of god to be vtterly and for euer deuoured of theis bereslyons / leopardes and euen of the terrible beast the Turke) Daniel saith that the tyme and houre is prefixed vnto euery one of them all. That is to saye: It is decreed in heauen how long euery one of the kingdoms in earth shall stand and how wyde they shall sprede. Hytherto semeth it Paul to haue loken when he sayd. God made out of one blodeAct. 17. all man kynde to dwell ouer the vniuersall earth and hath prefined their constituted tymes and hath prefixed the lymites of their habitacion that thei shuld seke God. Now is it shewed how long the lyon shall rore / howe long the leoparde shall crye with open mouth / and the bere how long he shall grone and crye. There yet remaineth the ende of these terrible beastis the pope and the Turke euen the kingdoms which yet stonde ouer Germanye

ouer Turkey and ouer Crystendom / to be destroyd by the last daye of iugemēt. Which thinge albeit / it be wryten of daniel into the consolacion of the catholyk chirche / yet maye we wepe and wayle to see the gospell thus troden vnder fete in all the vniuersall worlde. Tell me where the gospell shyneth in any part of Aphrica? where in ye great part of Asia? In Europa / vnder the Turkis emperours / & popis emperys there be here and there chirches / but they be so cruelly oppressed that nether good letters nor lerning maye florissh nor ye chirches maye haue any godly teachers. But what profiteth it to complaine? Sewerly this mystery of the crosse was setforth in the sone of God anon fro the beginninge of the worlde and is yet so confirmed with the examples of allGen. 3. &. 4. holy men that no consolacion maye be geuen to the chirche besydes the coming of Iesu cryst the sone of God and man. Wherfore (because the powr of the Turke cannot be lyke the Romane empyre nether shall he occupye all Europe (for daniel denyeth any fyfte Monarchye to come) we shall breifly expresse the wordis of daniel touching the cominge of the sone of god for oure consolacion. Cryst therfore shall come lyke the sone of man / for

because he shall iuge almen he shall be seCryste shall come lyke the sone of man. Ioan. 5. ne as a man of almen. This confirmeth he saying. The father hath geuen powr to iuge vnto his sonne / because he is the sone of man. And therfor it folowth in the text.
            
            
               And beholde / for in the night IText. sawe in the cloudis of heuen one comingChrists kingdō. Ioan. 5. lyke the sonne of man / which coming forthe, was brought vnto the great aged and he gaue vnto him powr glorye & the kingdom / that all peple / nacions and tongues shuld serue & worshipe him / whose powr is an euerlasting powr / neuer to be abolesshed / for his kingdom shall neuer be destroid.1. Cor. 15
               
               The sone of man to come to this great aged one / is the same that Paul saith cryste to delyuervp his kingdome / that is / the chirche of his chosen vnto his father whiche geueth to cryste powr glory and a perpetuall kingdom euer to raigne with his electe as the Psalmes of Dauid declare him and his kingdom. Also the same that cryste saith Ioan. 5. And his father gaue him powr to iuge because he is the sone of man. And to be breif cryste shall verely thus come shortly to iuge the persewers of his chirche and to delyuer ye godly as himself describeth it Mat. 25. let vs

The 10 hornes signifye 10 kinges to aryse out and to spring vp out of this beast / and after them there shall aryse a'nother litle one distinct and mightier then the former. For he shall oppresse and castedowne 3 kings. For he shall speke at the syde of the most highest god or speke on his parte of diuine things. But the highe holy saitis he shall tangle snarle or destroye. And shall arrogantly take vpō him to change tymes and lawes which shalbe put in to his handis whether it be for a long or any shorte tyme. Then aftir shalbe the iugement / and his powr thus taken from him / he shalbe vtterly slayne and destroid. But the kingdom powr and ample maiesty vnder the hole heuen shalbe geuen to the holy faithfull peple of the most higheste, whose raigne is eternall and all the highe powrs shall serue and obey him.

Of crystis iugement to come Ioan also saithApoc. 4. and. 20 he sawe a seat sette and 24 cheyers for the 24 eldres &c. For albeit cryst be the

only iuge wc of his father hath receyued all iugement / yet shall the apostles asiste him hauing their trones. And therfore saith he here. And the iugement was geuen to the highe holy faithfull. Cryste is called the olde aged / for a iuge ought to be a graue sage man of long experience. Whom Ioan called the lambe slayne frō the begining of the worlde / and the wordeIon. 1. which in the begining was with god: so that we may see that the prophetis aknowleged cryst euer bothe god and man his whight vesture sheweth him to be ye most iuste and incorrupt iuge without spotte / and himself in a gloriouse victory ouer syne death deuel and hell to be sene ioyouse and counfortable to his faithfull To cōfirme his old aunciet sage grauite he sawe his heares pure as fyne whight woll / hore headed pretende grauite and wysdome.

The doctryne (he sayth) perteineth cheifly vnto this last age of the worlde. For men be meruelously moued at the slyber fortunes therof / vnto both the parties. Some seing the great prosperouse successe fortunes and meruelous victories of the Turkis and other menis kingdoms / and cōtrary wyse the chirches of God to haue so harde fortunes / persecuted and destroyd in euery region / will rather folowe them that best prosper / and so fall from ye trewe chirche to the Turke or Pope yet raigning in seculare princes polycies / doctrynes and instituciōs / actis and articles / enbracing their false and vngodly religion.

By this vision was daniel and other good men conforted in those troublous tymes / and we be therby also premonisshed of the present mutacions of empyres and kingdoms & of lyke calamities and destruccions which drawe faste vpon.

               In the. 24. daye of the first monethText. I was by the gret ryuers syde called Tygris.Tygris so called of his swiftnes. And when I loked vp / I sawe a man in a whight linyne vesture whose loynes were gyrt vp with glistering gold / whose bodye was beutifull lyke a violete or iacinthe / his face lyke lyghteninge and his eyes lyke a burninge lampe / & his armes and feete so bright as any polisshed steell and the voyce of his wordis as it were the vehement noyse of a multitude.
               Now daniel describeth the tyme & place of this counfortable vision and also yt face & estate of the persone sene. For god wold now conforte heuye daniel / and not onely of the mutaciōs of the empyres to come / but also of the calamities now preassinge vpon the iewes before crystis cominge / & make them for this cause more certayn: that therof their posterite / & we might lerne with feare to call vpon oure zelouse God / and in fayth wayt fore oure sauiour cryste.

him in the Apocal. 1. Wherof as some formes be terrible / so be some of his parties pleasant and counfortable to beholde as both the psal. 44. & Isay. 11. describe him / teachinge vs that cryst according to his lawe and gospell / is with his gospell ioconde and plesant to all godly men / & terrible and fearfull with his lawe vnto all ye vngodly. And therfore is he thus paynted of the prophetis. His sight to beholdeis ferefull to them that shall wisshe the hills to fall vpon them to couer them from his countenance. And mighty and terrible is that same his voyce and breath of his mouth which slayeth the vngodly.
               The reste of his body described is plesant and ioyouse to beholde to the beleuers. His whight vesture & so▪ to be a man mortall therby / signifieth him / as daniel hereaftir saith / to be made whight with his crosse & passion / to enter into his glorye.

And who they be that Anticryste shall not ouercome. And who shalbe deceyued of him. His death and fall / & place wher he shalbe destroyd. Thirdly this  chap. techeth / that the crystianes / namely the confessours and techers of the gospell / shall before the last iugement suffer the most greuouse persecucions / but thei shall wresile oute of them thorow Cryst / beinge defended euen ayenst the gates of hell. The. 4. place treateth of the generall  resurreccion of oure bodyes / euen the last consolacion of the cristians. The. 5. is of the vertew and power of the ministers of the worde before the iugement / and of the eternall rewardis astir oure  death. The. 6. teacheth what reader

This vngodly casteth vp his nose & despisethThe .4. verse of ye. 10. psal. aftir the Hebrew. all other / in al his mischeuouse wyked cogitacions he setteth naught by god Not onely the turke / Mahumete / the popis of Rome / their cardinale / bisshopes / monkis / preistis and fryers haue playd / and yet play this parte / but also all emprours / kinges and princes / which ensen ced by their serpētine perswasions / haue & yet do persecute and suppresse the gospell / which (now the daye of their mercyfull visitacion by the gospell offred them) yet wyll thei (the aungell calleth anticrist a kinge) do what thei lyst / make what proclamaciōs and articles of oure fayth thei lyst / as doth the emprour this daye in the nether parties of Germanie strayghtly commanding no printer to printe / nor boke seller to sell any godly boke to the edifying of crystis chirche nether in dewche Latyne / Frenche / English / Spanish nor in the Italion speche.
            Secondly he is described of his pryde. He shalbe extolled and thrust vp himself aboue and ayenst the moste high god: speking horrible and meruclouse blasphemies ayenste him: Here was it prophecied.

That Anticryste shuld not onely sitte in2. thes. 2 the temple of god / but that he shall proudly lift vp himself (as Paul prophecieth it of this place takē) aboue euery thing that is called god / but also by his doctrine fighting playn ayenst the gospell / contumeliousely skorne god and cryste / and accurse and excommunicate his chirche / as it standeth in the .10. Psal. His mouthe is ful of malediccions.
            We exhorte therfore as many as we may for the glorie of god / that thei separat themselues from this vngodly facciō both in iugement & will: as did the Maccabeis exhorte many to auoid the company of the counsels confedered with Antiochus / we warne also the lerned and prudent / which yet for the studie and zele of peace (as thei wolde be sene) or for a certain singulare precise morosite / wolde apere to abhorre and estiewe these new facions and soden mutacions (as thei call them) being alto ware / to wise and to charely circumspecte in this their slake santering / leste their rasshnes (as thei pretex it) shuld confirme the enimies of the gospell / therfore decree thei thus to stād still / lyke idle idols / and in securite as it were afarre of loking vpon and beholdinge the bront of the bataill / no handis putting

forthe / nor yet once (whē thei might) to helpe to any amendement or reformacion.

And the dispersion of the holy peple ended / all these thin ges shall come to passe.

The man cled with lynen was Ga briel. The askinge of Gabriel how long the persecucion shuld endure is the voyce of the wayling and wepinge chirches desyering to knowe ye ende of their greuouse persecuciōs / which be here called meruelous and wonderfull: for that there can be nothinge thought more wonderfull to be merueled at / then thus to see sathan by his instruments the tyraunts / heretykes

and anticrists without ende to persecute / so that if one enimie of ours be ouercomen / yet he euer stereth vp another with whom we must euerfyght and neuer ceasse.

How longe we shalbe thus dispersed by persecucion / one ly god knowth. But of this be we certein that this dispersion by persecucion is the laste and moste certain signe that ye daye of iugement is at hande. For God declared vnto daniel the order of the. 4. monarchies / whiche be all paste / and the cruell kingdoms of Anticriste which shuld aryse in the fowerth monarchie / whiche at Mahumete and the pope be reueled. And the seculare anticristes which shall ende in the turke / begine faste to growe and to preuaile / which yet shall neuer be lyke in powr to the Romane monarchie / when it was in hir firste flowers.
