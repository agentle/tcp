               IT is a true ſaying (Right Honourable, Right Worſhipfull, and dearely beloued Men, Brethren and Fathers.) That Gods Schoole is more of affection, then vnderſtanding; both Leſſons are very needfull, and very profitable, for the Lord Ieſus is at hand, in flaming fire to render vengeance to them that know him 2. Theſſ. 1. 8. not: and not farre from my Text, hee threatneth (with deteſtation) to reiect his Church, becauſe ſhee loued him Reue. 3. 16. not. Both theſe therefore as a paire of Turtle Doues ought to bee ſacrificed vnto God, for

to know and vnderſtand much, without zeale and deuotion, is but Painted hypocriſie: and to bee zealous and deuoute without knowledge and vnderſtanding; is but blind ſingularitie. But in theſe dayes the ſecond Leſſon is more needfull to be taught and vrged, becauſe as Chriſt propheſied, the loue of many is growen cold: yea, if there bee ſome that haue much zeale and litle knowledge; there are many that haue much knowledge and little or no zeale: long peace and tranquilitie, ſeconded with wonderfull wealth and dignitie; hauing lulled moſt men and women into a ſpirituall ſlumber, in the Cradle of carnall ſecuritie. Giue me leaue then in your wontedSermon at Pauls Croſſe on New-yeres day laſt. Chriſtian patience, hauing not long ſince in publike and ſolemne place by Doctrine, informed your minds and vnderſtandings, in the knowledge of your dueties; Now, by word of Exhortation, to put heate and life into your affections and deuotion, for the practiſe of your dueties. For which purpoſe I haue choſen this excellent portion of Scripture to intreate of, wherein Saint Iohn (by the direction of Gods holy ſpirit) doth Graphically deſcribe the heauenlySumme of the Text. happineſſe of a Conuert ſoule: Firſt, before her conuerſion, in that her Sauiour, vouchſafeth (as it were) bare headed, at the doore of her heart to intreate her Conuerſion, and to ſtand with much patience, waiting when ſhee will open vnto him: Secondly, in the meanes which he vſeth for her Conuerſion, which are, louingly, to call vnto her, and friendly, to knocke at her doore: Laſtly, in the benefits of her Conuerſion, which are his perpetuall

dwelling and feaſting with her, Behold, I ſtand at the doore and knocke.

                people.
            The Partes of this Epiſtle (as of all the other) are foure, viz. Firſt an Exordium or Preface, in the foureteenth verſe, and hath three parts, viz. firſt, a Commandement, (Write.) Secondly, the Perſon from whom, deſcribed by three things, viz. firſt Amen, ſecondly, Faithfull and true witneſſe, thirdly, Beginning of the creatures of God. Thirdly, the perſonsGenerall Diuiſion. to whom he muſt write deſcribed, firſt, by his office, an Angel, ſecondly by the place where, of Laodicaea. The ſecond part of this Epiſtle containeth a generall propoſition, in theſe wordes; I know thy workes: The third generall part is ſpent in a narration,

in the latter part of the 15. and throughout the 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. The fourth and laſt part, is the concluſion, in the 21. and 22. verſes, and hath two partes, Viz. a promiſe in the 21. verſe, and a command in the 22. verſe.
            This Scripture is a member of the third generall part of this Epiſtle, which is the narration thereof; and hath three partes, Viz. firſt a reprehenſion, ſecondly good counſell, thirdly waightie admonitions. Firſt, he very ſharpely reproueth them, and that by an elegant metaphor, ſaying, thou art neither cold nor hote: that is, they knew the truth, but liued in a careleſſe mediocrity, and idle ſecurity; they did neither vtterly denie the Goſpel, nor ſoundly profeſſe it; they were neither profeſſed enemies, nor ſound Necplane hostes, nec vere amiciſed neutrales. friends, but wholy plied their trades & merchandiſe, not greatly caring which end went forward in Gods matters, ſo they might enioy their pleaſures and profites; yea, hee telleth them flatly this is their eſtate, and that they were deceiued, for they thought themſelues rich and increaſed with goods, and had neede of nothing; when as in truth, they were wretched, and miſerable, and poore, and blind, and naked; and therefore this will be the end of it, if they continue in this ſtate: hee will ſpue them but of his mouth. And truely as it is a marueilous ordinary thing, for them that liue in wealth, and abound with pleaſures, and haue all things which the fleſh deſireth, to grow ſecure: ſo if wee make application hereof to our ſelues, wee ſhall find, that moſt Congregations, men and women in this land, are fearefully growing luke-warm, and thinke themſelues

in farre better eſtate then they be.
            Thus hauing laid open their dangerous eſtate, (that it might appeare vnto them, hee ſought their good, and delighted not in their deſtruction.) In the ſecond place hee giueth them louing and good counſell, and ſheweth them how they may become rich, couer their nakedneſſe, and cure their blindneſſe: Thirdly and laſtly, hee doth very grauely admoniſh them, firſt to make good vſe of their corrections, by becomming more zealous and amending, in the verſe immediatly going before; ſecondly to make good vſe of the preſent meanes and occaſion of their good, in the wordes of my text: Beholde, I ſtand at the doore and knocke.
            
            We are guilty of this Churches ſin, I pray God we may make good vſe of this admonion, and this day that God ſpeaketh and knocketh, let vs take heede we harden not our hearts; ſhe was reproued, let vs repent; ſhe was well counſelled, let vs obey; ſhe was threatned, let vs tremble; ſhe was admoniſhed, let vs take heede; yea, ſhe is now puniſhed, Oh let vs beware.
            Thus with Noahs Doue, I haue long houered, but now I haue recouered the Arke: yea, with the Arke I haue long floted▪ but now am arriued on the mountaine of Armeniah, and (I hope not vnprofitably) made way to the Scripture that I purpoſe to inſiſt vpon: for the more orderly handling whereof, theſe partes are to be conſidered: Viz. firſt a propoſitionParticular Diuiſion. in theſe words; (Behold, I ſtand as the doore and knocke) ſecondly promiſes, in theſe words; (If any man heare my voyce, and open the doore, I wil come in vnto
               
               him, and will ſuppe with him and he with me.) The propoſition ſheweth the great willingnes of Chriſt to a ſinners conuerſion: the promiſes ſhew the endleſſe happines of the ſinner conuerted. In the propoſition,Sub-diuiſion. two things are to be conſidered: Viz. Firſt the 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                preamble, or note of regard wherewith
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . it is fronted, (Behold) Secondly, the propoſition it ſelfe, and therein theſe two things are remarkable, Viz. firſt the ſubiect, which is Chriſt, expreſſed by this pronoune (I) ſecondly the praedicate, or what is
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . pronounced of him; and that is threefolde, Viz. firſt his geſture how he behaueth himſelfe; I (ſtand) ſecondly the place where hee ſtandeth, (at the doore) thirdly what he doth ſtanding at the doore (and knocke) In the promiſes two things are to be conſidered, viz. firſt the conditions whereon; and ſecondly, the promiſes themſelues, what they are: in the conditions, two things are to be conſidered, viz. firſt, the generalitie and largeneſſe of them, in theſe
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . words of Proclamation (if any man) ſecondly, the Conditions themſelues, which are two, viz. firſt (to
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               heare his voyce) ſecondly, (to open the doore.) The promiſes made vpon theſe conditions, are two, viz. firſt, perpetuall abode, ((I will come in vnto him) ſecondly, perpetuall reioycing together, expreſſed by the Metaphor of feaſting or banquetting, which is twofold, viz. firſt, the Sinners feaſting of Chriſt (I will ſuppe with him) and ſecondly, Chriſts feaſting of the Sinner, (and he with me) The note of attention ſet at the doore of my Text, doth knocke at the doores of your hearts, for reuerent and chriſtian attention to

the handling of all theſe Partes. And firſt, let vs ſalute the Porter.
            (Behold) This word hath principally a double vſe;1. Part. 1. VSE. Firſt, it is as a Demonſtration, vſed for the greater certaintie and aſſurance of a thing, as a man is moſt certaine of that which he ſeeth; therefore ſaid the Diſciples vnto Thomas; We haue ſeene the Lord; and he ſaid, Except I ſee in his hands the print of the nayles, I will not 
               Iohn 20. 25. 
               beleeue. Thus for greater certaintie and aſſurance of the Lords neere comming to Iudgement, Saint Iude vſeth this phraſe of ſpeech, Behold, he commeth with thouſands of his Saints, to giue iudgement againſt all 
               Iude 14. 
               men. And Saint Iohn to like purpoſe, hath the like phraſe, Behold, hee commeth with 
               Reue. 1. 7. 
               cloudes, viz. he commeth ſo certainely, and is ſo neere, that if you will but looke vp vnto the cloudes, you may ſee him. So to aſſure vs, that this is no fable, he ſaith here, (Behold) I ſtand &c. yea, if we had but the eyes of Balaams
               Num. 22. 23. Aſſe, we might ſee him: but if we had a true faith, we would make no doubt of it, for the aſſurance therof is greater then of ſight or 
                  Fides anbiguum non habet. Barn▪ de conſid. 5. cap. 3. Maior est fides certitudo quam ſenſus. Aquin.
                knowledge.
            The ſecond vſe of this word, is to procure attention2. VSE. to a thing ſpoken: and to that purpoſe, moſt familiar with the Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, Yea, ſildome doth this worde goe before to prepare the way, but there followeth matter of exceeding weight and importance in the heele, and that ſpecially in a double Caſe.
            Firſt in matters of wonder, the more to prouoke1. Caſe. men to maruell, this word is vſed; So the Prophet Iſay, intreating of the rare and extraordinary, ſtrange and wonderfull maner of Chriſts Conception, thus

expreſſeth it, Behold, a Virgine ſhall conceaue and beare a 
               Iſay 7. 14. 
               Sonne.
            
            Secondly, in Caſe of gladneſſe, the more to prouoke men to reioycing, this word is vſed; as when2. Caſe. Chriſt, the Prince of peace and eternall glory, ſhould come into the Citie of Ieruſalem, to the great ioy of all ſuch as receiued him, the Euangeliſt cyting the words of the Prophet Zacharie, ſayeth, Goe tell the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King commeth vnto thee, meeke and ſitting on an Aſſe, therefore reioyce greatly, yea, ſhowt for 
               Zach. 9. 9. matth. 21. 5. 
               ioy: So here, to aſſure vs that the matter here deliuered is no trifle, but both caſes concurring, the more to prouoke vs both to wonder and reioyce, he thus deliuereth it, (Behold,) I ſtand at the doore and knocke. Yea, there is not one word in this ſentence, but deſerueth the ſtampe, and impreſſion of this Character vpon it.
            (Behold,) not a Seruant or Miniſter; not a Prophet or an Apoſtle; not a Saint or an Angell; but Chriſt Ieſus the Lord of life and glory himſelfe: If I had not come and ſpoken, they had had no 
               Ioh. 15. 22. 
               ſinne. (Behold,) he neither ſitteth, nor walketh, nor runneth; but (ſtandeth) as moſt deſirous to enter, and patiently expecteth the ſinners Pſal. 95. 10. leiſure.
            Behold, hee ſtandeth not in the Hall, Parlour, or Chamber, places and roomes for friends, and of comfort, entertainement, and content, but at the (doore) in the open ayre, a place for ſtrangers and enemies, where the head is filled with dew, and the lockes defiled with the drops of the Cantic. 5. 2. night.
            Behold, he ſtandeth at the doore, not mute, ſtill, and ſilent; but moſt friendly and louingly calleth and

               Prou. 1. 24. knocketh. Yea, behold all theſe together, (and as the Prophet ſaith) it will make you euen ſhowt for wonder and Zach. 9. 9. ioy: Oh, behold and conſider, what a matter of certaintie and importance, to cauſe both wonder and ioy! But I will not ſtand any longer at the doore of my Text.
            Entering in, the firſt thing I meete withall, is the1. Part in the Propoſition, VIZ▪ 
                  the ſubiect.
                ſubiect of this Propoſition; which in Engliſh is expreſſed, and in the Greeke and Latine

                verbs implicitly included; (I) ſtand, viz. (I) that am all one with my Iohn 10. 30. Father: (I) that am full of grace and Iohn 1. 14. trueth: (I) that am the Lord of 1. Cor. 2. 8. glory: (I) that haue made all Coloſſ. 1. 16. things: (I) in whom the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelleth Coloſſ. 2. 9. bodily: (I) that for thee and thy ſaluation came downe from Ephe. 4. 9. heauen, tooke vpon mee the forme of a ſeruant, and was obedient to the death of the Phil. 2. 7. Croſſe: (I) that haue all ſufficiency in and of my Pſal. 45. 7. ſelfe: and deſire to enter, not for mine owne, but thy Deut. 5. 29. good. Oh open vnto me, for (I) doe ſtand and knocke: From whence two things are chiefly to be conſidered, viz.
            Firſt, his great and incomprehenſible louing kindneſſe1. Obſeruation 1. Conſider Chriſts alſufficiencie in himſelfe.
                towards vs, who will vouchſafe to come to our doore; but much more to ſtand and knocke there; which moſt fully appeareth from theſe three conſiderations, viz. Firſt his owne al-ſufficiency in himſelfe, in that he ſtandeth not in need of vs, or any thing that we Pſal. 50. 10. haue, being the heire of all Heb. 1. 2. things, equall with his Philip. 2. 6. Father, and infinite with him in glory, from Iohn 17. 5. euerlaſting. Indeede, wee are ſaid by our praiſes, to Pſal. 34. 3. magnifie or make him Magnum facere. great, which is not in regard of himſelfe, who is already moſt Optimus maximus. great, but

when by our preaching and prayſing his glory and goodneſſe, we make that which is infinite in it ſelfe, to be reputed great of others. For as one well ſayth, to magnifie, is nothing elſe, but to ſignifie, that it is Magnificare, nihil aliud eſt, niſimagnum ſignificare Lexic. Theolog. verb. magnif. great.
            The ſecond conſideration, tending to amplifie his2. Conſider our indignitie kindeneſſe towards vs, is our owne indignitie; Oh, what kindneſſe is this, that the Lord of glory vouchſafeth to ſtand & knocke at the doore of his Church, which he hath pronounced already, to be wretched, and miſerable, poore and blind, and naked? Will you ſee the loathſome condition of vs all by nature? Then hearken what God ſaith by his Prophet, In the day of thy Natiuitie when thou wast borne, thy Nauell was not cut, thou waſt not waſhed with water, nor ſalted with ſalt, nor ſwadled in cloutes, no eye pitied thee, but thou waſt caſt out in the open field, to the contempt of thy Perſon, and when I paſſed by thee, I ſaw thee polluted in thine owne blood, and I ſaid vnto thee, thou ſhalt

            Secondly, let vs hence (to the ſhame of the faces2. Obſeruation of vs all) obſerue, our great vnthankfulneſſe and vnkindneſſe towards Chriſt, that will not open vnto him, but let him ſtand at the doore. If a man of any account, but ſpecially if an earthly King ſhould knocke at our doore, Oh what a ſtirre wee would make to let him in quickly! What a ſhame then is it,

that the King of heauen knocking at the doores of our hearts, we ſhould heare him as aloofe off, ſtand vpon tearmes and conditions, with if, and, and how, and giue him cold ſluggiſh excuſes (as the Church confeſſeth ſhee did) I haue put off my coate, and I haue waſhed my

brethren, thouſands there are that in this waighty caſe deceiue themſelues, for the heart of man is deceitfull aboue alIere. 17. 9. things: there are many that thinke their harts are marueilouſly affectioned vnto Chriſt: yea and perſwade themſelues, they haue Chriſt ſure in their hearts, that they are euen hugged in his armes, and ſhall bee ſaued by him aſwell as the beſt: who neuer ſo much as truely knew Chriſt, or taſted of him, and are furtheſt off from being ſaued by him; one would not thinke there could be ſuch deceitfulneſſe in mans heart, that when hee thinketh himſelfe moſt ſure, hee ſhould bee moſt deceiued; but the eſtate of this people doeth witneſſe no leſſe, for they had many good things in them: as they profeſſed Chriſt, had the knowledge of his will, and were partakers of the Signes and Seales of the Couenant of Grace, and thought themſelues rich, and to haue neede of nothing, when as in truth, they were wretched and miſerable, and blind, and poore, and naked, and the neereſt that Chriſt was vnto them (he ſtoode at the doore) and truely if there were a due triall and examination, I feare moſt mens Conuerſion would prooue but Copper, not able to abide the touchſtone, and if they were weighed in the ballance of of the ſanctuarie, Balthaſars Embleme may bee written in their foreheads, Thou haſt beene weighed in the ballance, and art found too

Sam. 25. 9. &c. him, and as vnkind as the Bethlehemites, hauing no roome in the Innes of their hearts for Luke 2. 7. him. Indeede whileſt the word is Preaching, and Chriſt calling, and knocking, they

ſeeme to bee mooued, will receiue the word with Matth. 13. 20 ioy, and with Agrippa bee almoſt perſwaded to Act. 26. 28. open, and with Herod peepe out at the Marke 6. 20. wicket, but no ſooner Sermon done, but their ioy vaniſheth, and by one predominant ſinne or other, they ſhut the doore, and bolt it faſt againſt Chriſt.
            It will bee very neceſſarie to ſearch, how, or byTwo meanes, whereby we may know whether we haue opened to Chriſt or no. 1 what meanes, we may vndoubtedly know whether we haue effectually opened vnto Chriſt or no. And by theſe two things we ſhall know. Firſt, hee commeth like a ſtrong and mightie man, and therefore if thou haſt opened vnto him, he hath bound Sathan, ſpoyled his houſe, diſpoſſeſſed ſinne, and abandoned death and Matth. 12. 29. &c. hell: Secondly, hee commeth as a King of glorious eſtate, and bringeth his traine with him, euen all the graces and fruites of his bleſſed ſpirit, whereof Saint Iohn ſaith, Hereby we know that he abideth in vs, euen by that ſpirit which he hath giuen 
               1. Iohn 3. vlt. Examination
                
               vs. Now then by theſe things, trie and Examine thy ſelfe as in the preſence of God; How ſtandeſt thou affected? Doeſt thou hate thoſe euill things which thou haſt loued? Doſt thou loathe thy former vncleane conuerſation? And abhorre thine old ſinnes? Doſt thou euery day ſtriue to be more righteous and leſſe ſinfull? Defying the garment ſpotted with the fleſh, and auoyding all appearance of euill? Endeauouring, and praying for ſtrength to walke in all the ordinances and commandements of Secundum iſtius vitaemodum. God: And for all the world, would not be in thy former prophane condition of life? Doeth thy ſoule abound with ſpirituall ioy, peace, humilitie, patience, brotherly kindneſſe, and loue, is thine heart enflamed with the

zeale of the glory of God, and haſt thou a burning deſire, that the name and glorious Goſpel of Chriſt may bee magnified? And doeth it grieue and vexe thee, when Gods glory is troden downe, his holy trueth deſpiſed, and his deare Church goes to ruine? If theſe things bee in thee in trueth, though but in ſmall and weake meaſure, thou maieſt bee of good comfort that thou haſt opened vnto Chriſt, and hee doth raigne and keepe Court in thine heart, &c.
            But if on the other-ſide, thou haſt nothing to ſtand vpon, but thou haſt been thus and thus long an Hearer of the word, Receiuer of the Sacraments, Profeſſor of Religion, but thine heart is ſet vpon the vanities, pleaſures and delights of the fleſh; as occaſion ſerueth, thou abuſeſt, thy tongue to lying, ſlaundering, ſwearing, and blaſpheming; thine heart is ſet vpon couetouſneſſe, whoredome; thy life ſtayned with pride, drunkenneſſe; thou haſt no true loue nor zeale of God and his trueth; but makeſt Religion ſo indifferent and light a matter, as thou art neyther cold nor hot, or if thou haſt reformed ſome things, yet thou haſt ſome one beloued ſinne or other, which thou canſt not endure to heare reprooued.
            If this be thine eſtate, (as vpon due triall I feare it would be found to be of many of vs) thou mayeſt be well perſwaded of thy ſelfe; but in trueth, the neereſt that Chriſt is vnto thee, is, Hee ſtandeth at the (Doore) &c.

No doubt the ſound of the Goſpell hath gone throughout all our Rom. 10. 18.

Yea, England is as Gods Temple,

ſoule feedeth at the eare, as the body by the mouth: And therefore the want of hearing is called a Amos 8. 11. famine; yea, as I haue ſaid Sermon at Pauls Croſſe. Ianu. 1. 1608.

firſt, Faith, and ſecond Repentance: So by Pauls miniſtrie, God had almoſt opened the doore of King Agrippa

               Acts 26. 29. wiſhed) beleeued and repented, they had not almoſt, but altogether opened vnto Chriſt: if then, by the miniſterie of his word, God haue begotten a true and liuely faith in thee, which worketh by

            And that I may conclude this point with words of Exhortation, I beſeech you open vnto the LordExhortation. this day, he hath too long waited our leaſure, and our vaine pleaſures, or profits, Honour, or wealth haue ſtood in our way, that few haue reſigned themſelues in ſuch reſolute obedience vnto Chriſt, as they ought; but haue differed Repentance, if not of all, yet of ſome ſinnes, and neglected, if not all, yet many good dueties: Oh that the Lord would frame our hearts this day to an holy and immooueable reſolution of obedience in all things, and no longer to trifle the time, with friuoulous excuſes, of dangerous delay, that ſo performing the Conditions of (hearing his voice, and opening the doores of our

               Paul: there are two principal motiues, effectual (where is any grace) to open the heart: Firſt, he is a liberall rewarder of them that entertaine him, he neuer commeth empty 
                  Faelix qui hunc Hoſpitem recipit, est ſatis magnificus hoſpes non venit vacuis manibus Ierus. in Iohn. fol. 401. handed: Abraham entertained but Angels, and had a ſonne beſtowed vpon Gene. 18. 10. him; Lot did the like, and he was deliuered from the ſubuerſion of Gene. 19. 17.

Sam. 6. 7. houſhold; what good thing then ſhall he want, in whom the whole Trinity Habenti dominum nil detrit, quod dei ſunt omnia. Cypr. dwelleth?
            Secondly, he is an inſeparable and moſt comfortable companion: we may haue friends that loue vs dearly in proſperity, yet wil forſake vs in aduerſity; as Dauid complaineth, my louers and friends ſtand a farre off, looking vpon my Pſal. 38. 11. plague, and yet Iob more lamentably complaineth, I became a ſtranger to my neighbors, my familiars forgot me, my maides tooke me for a ſtranger, and my ſeruant would not anſwere me, my breath was ſtrange vnto my wife, though I prayed her for the childrens ſake of mine owne Iob. 19. 13. &c. bodie: yea, CHRIST himſelfe had experience hereof, Iudas betrayed Matth. 26. 16. him, his Diſciples forſooke Matth. 26. 56. him, and Peter for-ſware Matth. 26. 72. him; that the Prophecy might be fulfilled, I will ſmite the Shepheard, and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhall be 
               Zach. 13. 8.

all men forſake vs; this ſeperateth husband and wife, parents and children, friend and friend, though neuer ſo dearely beloued: if Sarai be once dead, Abraham is carefull for a place where to burie her out of his Gene. 23. 4. ſight.
            But if Chriſt be entred within the doores of our hearts, he will be with vs for euer, for ſo he hath promiſed; when thou paſſeſt thorow the waters, they ſhall not ouerflow thee; when thou walkeſt thorow the fire, the flame ſhall not kindle vpon thee, for I will be with Eſay 43. 2. thee: ſo that in euery perill, we may with Dauid comfort our ſelues in Pſal. 23. 4.

The firſt, I ſay, is (ſinne) for if this diſh be wanting in the ſeruice, Chriſt is not welcome; Nay, he will not tarry Supper, for he is come to ſeeke and to ſaue that which was Matth. 18. 11. loſt; the whole neede not the Phyſition but thoſe that are ſick: he came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to Matt. 9. 12. 13. repentance: howſoeuer then proude Merit-mongers and Iuſticiaries, may with Martha take care, and trouble themſelues about many things, yet is this the one needful Luke 10. 41. thing, which our Sauiour Chriſt taketh in good parte, and the Angels of heauen reioyce Luke 15. 10. at; Viz. that we preſent our ſinnes vnto him, and ſay with the prodigall ſonne, Father I haue ſinned againſt heauen and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy

Righteouſneſſe.
                theſe three things are principally communicated vnto vs: firſt righteouſnes in ſteade of ſinfulneſſe: ſo Saint Paul ſaith, he is made of God to be vnto vs wiſdome, righteouſnes, ſanctification, and 1. Cor. 1. 30. redemption: and againe, he was made ſinne that knew no ſinne, that wee might be made the righteouſnes of God through 2. Cor. 5. vlt▪
                him, whoſe righteouſnes of Matth. 3. 15. fulfilling and Heb. 2. 9. ſuffering, actiue and paſſiue, being made ours by faith, the ſinnes of omiſſion and commiſſion are done away, and wee ſtand before God, not onely as not hauing broken his law, but alſo as hauing abſolutely kept and fulfilled it.
            The ſecond is ioy and peace, in ſtead of ſorrovv2. Ioy. and anguiſh; he taketh avvay our ſackcloth, and girdeth

vs with P ſal. 30. 11. gladnes: for hauing his righteouſnes, and being iuſtified, we haue peace with Rom. 5. 1. God; yea, and ioy in God vnſpeakeable and glorious, which we can neither ſuppreſſe nor 1. Pet. 1. 8. 
               Nec reticere nec recitare. expreſſe, which yet is but a taſte, as the bunch of Grapes were to the Num. 13. 24. Iſraelites: the full fruition is not granted till we come into Gods preſence, where are the fulnes of Pſal. 16. vlt. ioyes: where they ſhall drinke of the Riuers of pleaſure, and be ſatisfied with the fatnes of Gods Pſal. 36. 8. houſe, where ioy ſhal not enter into them, for it is ſo great as heart cannot conceiue the taſte of 1. Cor. 2. 9. it, but they ſhall enter into Matth. 25. 23. it, and

            The third and laſt is, happines and felicity in ſteade3. Happineſſe of our wretchednes and miſery, which conſiſteth both in full redemption from all euill, and the perpetuall fruition of all good; in regard whereof, the holy Ghoſt pronounced, Bleſſed are they that are called to the Lambes Supper, theſe wordes of God are Reue. 19. 9. Exhortation.
                true: Oh bleſſed then, and an hundred times bleſſed are ye that are now called, if ye come to this Supper; wherefore I beſeech you, let vs dallie and excuſe the matter no longer, but this day that he knocketh, let vs heare his voice and obey, leaſt deferring to repent, he ceaſe to knocke any longer, and in ſtead of ſealing vs vp vnto the day of Ephe. 1. 13. redemption, he ſeare vs with an hotte Iron to the day of 1. Tim. 4. 2. deſtruction: Oh therefore that I knew what to ſay, or what to doe, to obtaine this of you, or rather of God for you: Yea, if vvith Salomon I might hane my wiſh, I would neither

deſire of God long life, nor riches, nor any ſuch earthly vanity, but this onely needfull grace to my ſelfe, and al that haue heard me this day, that effectually opening the doores of our harts vnto Chriſt, he might come in and ſup with vs, and we with him for euer.
            To conclude, this yeere is a great yeere of triallConcluſion. & temptation, eſpecially to the poore, and I beſeech you that haue this worlds goods to heare and open vnto them, when they call and knocke at your gates, knowing that what yee giue to the poore ſeruants of Chriſt in his Name, yee giue vnto him, and hee will reward Quod iacenti in terra porr
