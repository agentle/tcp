               Yet drede I moost her hert to perturbe
               With vyolence yf I doo suche a game
               For yf I wold it openly dysturbe
               It must be dysclaunder vnto hyr name
               And me were leuer dye than hyr defame
               As nold god but yf I shold haue
               Hyr honoure as lyef as my lyf to saue
            
            
               Thus am I lost for ought that I can see
               For certeyn is / syth I am hyr knyght
               I must hyr honour leuer saue than me
               In euery caas as louer ought of ryght
               Thus am I with desyre I reson twyght

               And reson nyl not / so my hert dredyth

               Pandare ansuerd / Frend thow mayst for me
               Do as the lyst / but had I it so hote
               And thyne estate / she shold go with me
               Though al this toun cryed on this thing by note

               She was ryght suche to see in hyr visage

               On hyr / & eke hyr ioyes euerychone
               Ben fled / and thus lyeth Creseyde alone
            
            
               
               Aboute hyr eyen two / a propyr ryng
               Bytrent in sothfast token of hyr peyne
               That to byhold it was a dedely thyng
               For whiche pandare myght not restreyne
               The terys from his eyen for to reyne
               But netheles as he best myght he seyde
               From Troylus these wordes vnto Creseyde
            
            
               Loo nece I trowe ye haue herd al how
               The kyng with other lordes for the best
               Hath made a chaunge for Anthenor & yow
               That cause is of this sorowe & vnrest
               But how this cas doth / Troylus moleste
               That may none erthely mannes tonge seye
               As he that shortely shapyth hym to deye
            
            
               For whiche we haue so sorowed both he & I
               That in to lytel / both it hath vs slawe
               But thurgh my counseyl thys day fynally
               He somwhat is fro wepyng now withdrawe
               And semyth me that he desyreth fawe
               With yow to be al nyght for to deuyse
               
                  Remedy of this yf there be ony wyse
            
            
               This is short & pleyn theffect of my message
               As ferforth as my wyt can comprehende
               For that ye be of turment in suche a rage
               Ye maye to no long prolog as now entende
               
                  And herupon ye must ansuer hym sende
               And for the loue of god my nece dere
               So leue this woo or Troylus come here
            
            
               Grete is my woo quod she / and syghed sore
               As she that felyth dethes sharp distresse
               But yet to me his sorow is moche more
               That loue hym let than he him self I gesse
               Alas for me hath he suche heuynesse
               Can he for me so pitously compleyne
               Ywys hys sorowe doublyth al my peyne
            
            
               
               Greuous for me god wote / is for to twynne
               Quod she / but god wote harder is to me
               To see that sorowe whiche that he is Inne
               For wel I wote it wol my bane be
               And dye I wyl in certeyne quod she
               But byd hym com / or deth that thus me threteth
               Dryue out yt ghost / whiche in myn hert beteth
            
            
               These wordes sayde she on hyr armes two
               Fulgruf / and gan to wepe pytously
               
                  Quod pandarus alas why doo ye soo

               But ye wol haue hym wode out of his mynde
            
            
               For wyst he ye ferd in thys manere
               He wold hym self slee / yf I wende
               To haue this fare / he shold not come here
               For al the good that Priamus may dyspende
               For to what fyne he wold anone pretende
               That knowe I wele / & therfor yet I sey
               Soo lete this sorowe / or platly he wyl dey
            
            
               And shapyth yow his sorow to abredge
               
                  And not to encrece lyef nece swete
               Be rather to hym of flat than edge
               And with som wysedom ye his sorowe bete
               What helpeth it to wepe ful a sterte
               Or though ye bothe in salt terye dreynt
               Bet is a tyme of cure than of compleynt
            
            
               I mene as whan I hyder hym bryng
               Syth ye ben wyse & of one assent
               Soo shapyth how to dystourbe youre goyng
               
               Or come ageyn sone / after ye be went

               And late see now youre wyt how shal auayle

               Go quod Creseyde & vncle trewely
               I shal do al my myght me to restreyne
               From wepyng in his syght / & besyly

               Goth Pandarus / & Troylus he sought
               Tyl in a Temple he fond hym al alone
               As he that of his lyf nomore rought
               But to the pytous goddes enerychone
               Ful tenderly he prayd & made his mone
               To doo hym soone / oute of this world pace
               For wele he thought ther was none other grace
            
            
               And shortely al the sothe to sey
               He was so falle in despeyr that day
               That vtterly he shope for to dey
               For ryght thus was his argument alway
               He sayd I am but lorn so wele away
               For al that cometh / cometh by necessyte
               Thus to be lorn it is my destyne
            
            
               For certeynly this wote I wel he seyde
               That forsyght of dyuyne purueaunce
               Hath seen me alwey to forgoo Creseyde
               Syth god seeth euery thyng oute of doutaūce
               And hem dysposyth after his ordynaunce
               In her merytes sothly for to be
               As they shal come by predestyne
            
            
               But netheles alas whome shal I leue
               For there ben clerkes many one
               That descryue thurgh argumentes preue
               And som seyn that nedely ther is none
               But that fre choyse is youe to euerychone
               O wele awey so sly are clerkes old

               For som seyn that god seeth al byforn
               And god may not be desceyued parde
               Than mote it falle / though men had it sworn
               That purueaunce hath seen aforn to be
               Wherfore I saye that from eterne yf he
               Hath wist byfore or thought eke al oure dedes
               We haue no free choys as thes

                  eaunce
               Whiche may not be deceyued neuermo
               Hath felt byfore withoute ignorance
               For yf ther myght be a varyounce
               To worchen oute from goddes purueyeng
               
               There were no prescyence of thyng comyng
               
            
            
               But it were rather an oppynyon
               Vnstydfast / & not certeyn seeyng
               And certes that were an abusyon
               That god shold haue no parfyte clere wytyng
               More than we men that haue douteous wenyng
               But suche an errour vppon god to gesse
               Were fals & fowle & curfyd wykkednesse
            
            
               Aud this is eke an oppynyon of some
               That haue theyr top ful hye / & smoth y shore
               They say ryght thus that thyng is not to come
               For that prescyence hath seyn it byfore
               That it shal come / but they that therfore
               That it shal come / therfor the purueaunce
               Wot

               And in this manere this necessyte
               Receyueth in his part contrary ageyn
               For nedefully behoueth it not be
               That thylk thynges falle in certeyn
               That ben purueyed / but nedely as they seyn
               Behoueth it that thynges whiche that falle

               I mene as though I laboured me in this
               To enquyre wich thyng / of wich thing cause be
               As whether that the prescyence of god is
               The certeyne cause of the necessyte
               Of thynges that to come be parde
               Or yf necessyte of thyng comyng
               Be cause certeyn of the purueyeng
            
            
               But now enforce I me not in shewyng
               
               How the ordre of causes stant / but wel wote I
               That it byhouyth that the byfallyng
               Of thynges wyst byfore certeynly
               Ben necessary / al seme it not ther by
               That preseyence put fallyng necessayre
               Of thyng to come / falle they fowle or fayre
            
            
               For yf ther syt a man yond on a see
               Than by necessyte behoueth it
               That certes thyn oppynyon sooth be
               That wenyst & coniectyst that he syt
               And ferthermore ayeneward yet
               Loo ryght so it is of the parte contrarye

               That he mote syt by necessyte
               And thus necessyte in eyther is
               For in hym nede of syttyng is

               Therfor is thyn oppynyon soth ywys
               And I sey though the cause of soth of thys
               Comyth of his syttyng yet necessyte
               Is entrechaungyd both in hym & the
            
            
               
               Thus in the same wyse oute of doutaunce
               I may wel make / as it semeth me
               My resonynge of goddes purueaunce
               As of tho thynges / that to comen be
               By whiche reason men may wel see
               That thylk thynges that in erthe falle
               That by necessyte they comen alle
            
            
               For though that thyngis shal come ywys
               Therfore they ben purueyed certeynly
               Not that it cometh for it purueyed is
               Yet netheles behoueth it nedefully
               That thyng to come / be purueyed trewely
               Or elles thynges that purueyed be
               That they betyde by necessyte
            
            
               And this suffyseth ryght ynough certeyn
               For to destroye oure free choyse euery dele
               But now is thys abusyon to seyn
               That fallyng of the thynges temporele
               Is cause of goddes prescyence eternele
               Now trewely that is a fals sentence
               That thyng to come shal cause his prescyence
            
            
               What myght I wene / & I had suche a thought
               But that god purueyeth thyng that is to come
               For that it is to come / & elles nought
               So myght I wene that thynges al & some
               That whylome ben byfalle & ouercome
               By cause of thylk souerayne purueaunce
               That forwote al withoute ignoraunce
            
            
               
                  And ouer al this yet sey I more therto
               That ryght as when I wote there is a thyng
               
               Iwys that thyng mote nedefully be so
               Eke ryght so when I wote a thyng comyng
               Soo mote it come / & thus by byfallyng
               
               Of thynges that ben wyst byfore the tyde
               They maye not ben eschewyd on no syde
            
            
               
               Than sayd he thus almyghty Ioue in Throne
               That wost of al this thyng the sothfastnes
               Rewe on my sorow / and doo me deye sone
               Or bryng Creseyde & me from dystresse
               And whyle he was in al thys heuynesse
               Dysputyng with hym self in this matere
               Come Pandare & sayde as ye shal here
            
            
               O myghty god quod Pandarus in throne
               Ey who sawe euer a wyse man fare so
               Why Troilus what thynkest thou to done
               Hast thow suche lust to be thyne owne foo
               What parde / yet nys not Creseyde goo
               Why lyst the so thy self for to drede
               That in thyne hede thyn eyen semen dede
            
            
               Hast thou not lyued many yere byforn
               Withoute hyr / & ferd ful wele at ease
               Arte thou for hyr / and for none other born
               Hath kynd wrought the only for to please
               Here lete see / & thynk on thy dysease
               That on the dyse ryght as there fallen chaūces
               Ryght so in loue there come & goo plesaunces
            
            
               And yet this is my wonder most of al
               Why yu thus sorowest / syth yt thou wost not yet
               Towchyng hyr goyng how it shal falle
               Ne yf she can hyr seluen dystourben it
               Thou hast not yet assayed al hyr wyt

               Soo as acordyd was betwyxt vs twey
               And euermore me thynketh thus that she
               Hath somwhat in her hertes pryuete
               Wherwyth she can yf I shal ryght rede
               Dystourbe al this / of whiche thou art in drede
            
            
               
               For whiche my counseyl is when it is nyght
               Thou to hyr goo / and make of this an ende
               And blysful Iuno thurgh his grete myght
               Shal as I hope hyr grace to the sende
               Myn hert seyth certeyne / she shal not wende

               Thow seyst ryght wele / & I wyl do ryght so
               And what hym lyst / he sayd vnto hym more
