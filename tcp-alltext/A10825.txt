                  Imperiall and incomparable MAIESTY.
                  
                     THE holy Ghost teacheth vs godlines most forcibly, by the breuitie of our life, naming it a vapour, grasse,

                      as to be called a bubble, a sleepe, a shadow; and the holy men of God, come so farre, as that they compare it to a thought, whereof there may be vnspeakeable thousands in one day, yea in an houre.
                     
                        Psal. 90.9.
                      King Dauid saith, Behold, thou hast made my daies as a hand bredth,

                     I haue cut off like a Weauer my life. And thus it is euident, that mans life (for its speedie motion in her short way)

is as swift as a Weauers shittle,
                        Ps. 103.16.
                      
                     and passeth as the wind. The swiftest thing in nature for motion (the Sun) may stand still,
                        Iosh. 10 13
                      but mans life doth not stay, For euen when the Sunne stoode still a dayes iourney, mans life went forward. Wise Salomon
                     ▪ called it vaine, and not contented therewith seemed to correct himselfe, and called it vanity it selfe.
                     
                        Psal. 62 9.
                      But Dauid his Father goeth farther, and saith, Man is lighter then vanity, being layd in a bal
                           •
                        ance. We (so fond we are) increase our count of daies, as the euill seruant did;
                        Mat. 24.50▪
                        
                      
                     But his Master came in a day when hee looked not for him so did the foolish

                     Virgins. It is good not to beguile our selues in computation, but to be taught to number our dayes, which is a verie rare Arithmetique. If there were worlds in possession of them that are departed, they would gladly giue them vs for one day, or houre, which wee so little esteeme of.
                  Besides, death often taketh violently from vs the time to come, yea from them which are most deare to God. Rachiell dyed in childe-bed, Elie brake his necke, the Prophet was killed by a Lyon,

                     Iobs children in their banqueting strucke dead, Iosiah kild by Pharaoh Necho, Isbosheth slept at noone, but was slaine

before he awoke, &c. Neither hath any Liuer surer charter of his life, vnlesse he could haue a lease of it, as Ezekiah in some sort had of his by Esaiah, wherein hee had very ill successe. Thus we ought to apply our hearts vnto wisedome, perswading ourselues that death is within a minute, that it will easily dispatch that, which no Law, Prince, or Punishment could doe: and if we would euery day thinke wee draw our last breath, wee should prepare vs, and repaire to the word, and goe boldly to the throane of grace,
                     
                        Heb. 4.16.
                      
                     that there wee may receaue mercie, and finde grace to helpe in time of need, knowing that it is a

greater benefit to be a liuing Dog,
                     
                        Eccles. 9.4.
                      then a dead Lyon. For while that we liue, there is space for repentance, but after death there is none. And this Christ alloweth as a high poynt of wisedome in Marie, in that shee ha

                        Luc. 10.42
                      And here in this little Treatise, I shew that those times we bestowe on Gods worship, shall not end with the number of our dayes, but shall haue their abiding fruite for euer, and shall last as long as God himselfe shall endure.

                     MY purpose (gentle Reader) in the frame of this Booke is, by short questions to quicken and put edge on thy vnderstanding, and by meditations to make the doctrine thine owne: which thou must haunt frequently, by chewing the cud, and so by the holy Ghost, applying the doctrine more particularly to thy selfe, which thing

no other (although neuer so effectuall a Preacher) can do so fitly; because each of vs is most priuie to his owne estate. For that knowledge by hearing & reading, whilest that it swimmeth in the braine, but is not setled in the affections by meditation, is but a vanishing knowledge. And by prayer, the gr
                        •
                     ces of God are moystened, which cannot bee drie so long as thou resortest to Christ by feruent supplications. These three thou mayest vse in the day time, but exercise praier and meditation, assoone as thou awakest in the night, ioyning thereunto the examination of thy heart; for then

is the soule (as it were) at home. Which in the day time had wandred abroad. And so to reade, and not to meditate, is vnfruitfull; to meditate, and not to read is dangerous for errors; and to reade and meditate without prayer is hurtfull. For without prayer our mindes shall be driuen from the things vnder our meditation, to roue, & wander after other matters, whither our own corruption and Satan is about to lead vs. Wherefore (beloued Reader) I haue according to the measure of gr

                  And farther, did no Ethicke come, neither had more prepaparation and resolution against deaths approaching, euen as the Hypocrites and Infidels in these our dayes, which haue no faith in Iesus Christ our Redeemer: And therefore all these wicked and profane creatures, must vnderstand that their condemnation shall bee the greater in the last day, then those Ethick Philosophers: for they haue a greater occasion, and more ample matter, by the light which now shineth abroad by the Gospell; yet they will not rectifie their liues

by true repentance conformable thereto. And therefore they haue their noluerunt, for so saith Christ,
                     Matth. 10.14.15. 
                     whosouer shall not receiue you, nor heare your words, when ye depart out of that house, or that city shake off the dust of your feet.
                  
                  Truely I say vnto you, it shall bee easier for them of the land of Sodome and Gomorrha in the day of iudgdement, then for that Citie. He that hath eares to heare let him heare.
                     Reu 2.11. And therefore aboue all things, we must consider of the difference betweene a Christian mans life and conuersation, hauing faith and repentance, and the life of the Infidell, Hypocrite, and Vngodly; to the end we may feele and sensibly apprehend Gods eternall and euerlasting mercy bestowed vpon vs Christians: that we may (I say) seriously and earnestly meditate night & day vpon the goodnesse and fauour of our God in this specialty shewed vnto vs.Psal. 1.
                  
                  As for the first, the Hypocrite
                     
hath no familiarity with God, nor sight of heauen: but vseth the precious gifts of God after the same manner, as doth the swine the akornes vnder the tree, being neuer mindefull that there is a God i

                  But contrarily, the Christian, faithfull and hopefull, acknowledgeth God his Creator, reioyceth in him, vseth all his gifts with thankefulnesse, loueth God which hath done all things so wisely & wonderously well, vseth himselfe in those both night & day commeth to the Lord his God and brayeth after eternall life.

                     for if I would iudge my selfe, I should not bee iudged of thee: but when I am iudged of thee, I am chastised of the Lord, because I should not be condemned with the world; whereby hee is taught repentance, and amendment of Life. The Wicked and Infidells doe neuer worke vpon their

                     Soules vntill they be sicke; then first begin they to bee holie, and before that time, all their dayes they haue beene enemies to the Word and Ministerie. But now must the Preacher be sent for, and with sugred speeches must be entreated for consolation, &c. But the faithfull Christian is euerie minute in preparation to a blessed death, and neuer suffereth himselfe to fall into that condition and behauior of life wherin he would not die, and therefore can say with constant magnanimitie, Come Lord Iesus my Ioy and Comforter, euery houre I attend thee, come when thou

                     2. Luk. The Infidel and Reprobate, whenas he lacketh counsell and helpe in sicknsse, hath recourse to Sathan, Witches, and to vnlawfull meanes, and saith most desperately, If

God will not helpe, then helpe Deuill. But the Christian beleeuer knoweth, that the Lord hath forbidden all such inconuenient meanes, and vnderstandeth Sathans policie and craft,Exod. 20.3 that it is not for his good, but that his soule should separate it selfe from the true SAVIOVR; Yea,
                     1 Sam. 28.8 
                     hee is assured it is an hundred times better to die in constant inuocation on Gods name, then to liue vnder protection of Sathan: and therefore vseth such meanes as the Lord hath appoynted, hee will not tempt the Lord his God, he will not seeke after the ministerie of such as God hath not promised a blessing vnto, but wil say,Mat. 8.2. 
                     Here am I Lord Iesus, let it be vnto me according to thy will, if thou wilt thou canst make me clean, but,Psal. 40.8. if not, Loe here I am, thy will be done, I desire to do thy good wil, O God, yea, thy lawe is within my heart. And to be short, the children of this world neuer haue memorie on Gods word, (for

they haue not learned) and cannot comfort themselues by their baptisme, nor that excellent Sacrament of the Lords Supper, but cause some scurrilous History and false fable to be read vnto them, with such foolishnesse, whereby they may dispossesse the thoughts of death, and quiet their hearts; but the faithful one is acquainted and exercised in gods word, diuideth that word of truth, puts a difference betwixt Law and Gospell, reioyceth in the couenant of mercie in his baptisme, seeketh comfort in the other Sacrament, wherewith he was fed and refreshed, and so obtaineth new trust and ioye from time to time, momentanie hee esteemeth, but as they are he

seeing it by euident experience, that he must dye as others do, complaineth of mans great miserie, and of the shortnesse of this sweet and pleasant life; but maketh not preparation by repentance therevnto, but fretteth against God, inueigheth against his iustice, because man hath but a short time giuen him to liue.
                  
                  Now the true Christian touched with the daily examples of humane infirmitie and corruption, groaneth because of that our first fall, lamenteth for his sinnes and wickednesse, for the which the diuine punishment ceaseth not vpon vs,Lam. 3.22.23.24.41.5 6. lifteth vp his heart with his hands vnto God in the Heauens, who heareth his voyce, and hideth not his eare at his breathing and crye,

Yea,Psal. 119. he attributeth the true honour vnto God, for hee doth all things iustly and well, and so prepareth himselfe euery houre of the day to a blessed departure. Againe, the Hypocrite when his heart meditateth on death, is afraid for the terrible visage and countenance thereof; for flesh and bloud can doe no lesse, for death is our enemie, and killeth vs all, but the hopefull christian openeth the eyes of faith, looketh vpon death not according to the Law, but according to the Gospell, comforts him in his Lord Iesus Christ,

If that it were permitted wee should twice die, then if one had not well and godly disposed himselfe the first time hee died, hee might reforme himselfe at the second essay. Oh but not so: if thou die il once from this world, thou shalt be carried to euerlasting anguish and woe.

                           A praier for a blessed departure.
                           O holy and wise God, thy thoughts are not as our thoughts,
                              Isa. 55.8. 
                              neither our wayes as thy wayes,
                              Vers. 9. 
                              but as the heauens are higher than the earth, so are thy wayes higher than our wayes, and thy thoughts than our thoughts, grant that in a full purpose of cleannesse of

heart, I may walke here before thy face, and depart in blessed time of death, with sure confidence, that nothing can betide mee,Rom 8. but what shall be good and profitable vnto mee. Grant this, good Father, for the gratious mediation of thy Sonne Iesus Christ my Lord and onely Sauiour. Amen.
                        
                     
                     
                        Flesh.
                        Seeing then these foure things are of so great moment, how may I rightly and duly consider of them?
                     
                     
                        Spirit.
                        After this manner,
                              The time.
                            for the first: Thou doest not know (deare soule) in what day, moneth, or

yeere, God will 
                              •
                           all thee from this world, whether it shall happen in the day, or in the night, euen or morne. God might easily haue reuealed the same,Eccl. 38. if it had beene his heauenly will, but it is of his diuine prouidence and great goodnesse, that hee hath not so done.
                        
                           Meditation on the sirst, the time.
                           Behold (my soule) we wretched creatures are so corrupt by sinne, and are so inamoured with this world, that if the day of our death were reuealed vnto vs, neuer should we thinke on God, feare him, or call vp
                                    •
                                 n his name, neuer

be stirred vp to repentance, vntill at the very instant time it were appointed wee should die; then would man first applie himselfe to learne repentance, but come short thereof, therefore it is not hurtfull, but very gainfull and necessary, that wee should be ignorant of the houre of our death.
                        
                        
                           A praier of mans vanitie.
                           O my God, make mee consider how altogether man is vanitie,Psal. 39.5. who passeth so swiftly away, truly man borne of a woman liues but a short time, and that full of vnquietnesse, he commeth forth like a flower, and is c
                                    •
                                 t downe like the grasse;

hee slieth also as a shadow, and continueth not: his dayes are determined, the number of his moneths are with thee, thou hast appointed him bounds, which hee cannot passe. And now, my God, thou who of thy great wisedome hast hid from mee the day of the dissolution of this my tabernacle of clay,1 Cor. 5.1. helpe mee, that I neuer let passe any time without true repentance, and seeing thou hast hid from mee the time of my departure, vouchsafe on me thy mercy and grace, that I may so bestow my whole life, that night and day,Psal. 6. yea euery houre and twinckling of an eye, I

may be in a Christian preparation and readinesse to die the death of the godly, through Iesus Christ my Lord and Sauiour. Amen.
                        
                        
                           Meditation on the second, the place.
                           For the second,
                                 The place.
                               thou knowest not in what place thou shalt end thy dayes, whether in thine owne house, or in a strangers, in thy bed, or in the field. The sand-glasse of our life continually runneth out, and no man knoweth, no man is certified when it hath done running: so death is euer present, and followes vs at our heeles, and ouertaketh

taketh vs wheresoeuer it findeth vs; it attendeth vs euery where, for as the lightning commeth out of the East,
                              Mat. 24.27 
                              and shineth euen vnto the West, so shall also the comming of the Son of man be. If thou therefore be a faithfull and wise seruant,
                              Luk. 12.42. in euery houre thou wouldest expect it, that when thy Lord commeth, hee may finde thee so doing.
                        
                        
                           Praier that wee may ioifully meet death.
                           O my God, make mee euer and continually vnderstand, that I am a poore mortall creature, who can in no place preserue my selfe from

death, seeing it continually waiteth in all places, and lurketh for me, make me meet it euermore circumspectly, with a ioifull and glad heart. Grant this (most mercifull God) for thy deare Sonne Iesus Christ his sake. Amen.
                        
                        
                           Meditation vpon the third, thy state or behauiour.
                           As for the third,
                                 Thy state what.
                               thou canst not tell (O my soule) in what state or behauiour the Lord thy God shal finde thee, whether sleeping or awake, merry or sad, in worldly or spirituall exercise, quiet or angry, or howsoeuer otherwise distempered: giue therefore diligent

heed (my soule) that thou neuer bee in such case, wherein willingly thou wouldest not die, for death neuer loseth opportunitie, neither is neglectful to take aduantage, and thou knowest well what couenant thou hast with death,Eccl. 14. yea moreouer (deare soule) as the Lord shall finde thee, so will hee iudge thee hereafter.
                           
                        
                        
                           A short praier to forsake the world.
                           Keepe me (Lord Iesus) from drowsines, idlenes, and slumbering in sinne, that I liue not inconsiderately,Luk. 19. as the vngodly, which haue no hope,
                              1 Thess. 4. but that at euery occasion

and minute, I may bee ready to take my leaue of this world, and raigne with thee my Lord and Sauiour eternally in the world to come. Amen.
                        
                        
                           Meditation of the fourth, the manner.
                           Concerning the fourth, thou art ignorant (deare soule) by what kinde of disease the Lord will call thee from hence, whether it shall happen by pestilence, maladie in the head, ague, &c. by shipwracke or fire, and it may bee God hath appointed thee to be ouertaken by robbers, wilde beasts, or some such casualtie, yea (O soule) many neuer intend repentance
                              
in all the time and space they haue health and prosperitie, vntill some languishment and sicknes seize vpon them: but who knoweth whether at any time hee shall haue sicknesse and leisure together? Haue wee not daily examples how many decease by palsie, by sword, and sudden death, & through sundry other maladies of body, and before they were euer sicke or diseased, or that God suffered them to haue the benefit of their bed and rest?
                        
                        
                           A praier to forsake the world, and follow Christ.
                           O God, how foolish are

wee miserable and fond creatures? how smal heed and attention giue wee to daily occurrences? The fowle is an vnreasonable creature, yet when it seeth another to bee killed beside it, shee presently swingeth and flieth away, and when it spieth a man to bend his bow & aime at it, there is no longer staying, but quickly conueieth it selfe thither, where it may bee secure and safe: Euen so (O soule) death breakes in all places many mens hearts, and they do fall on euery side; then feare (O soule) and flie from sinne to righteousnesse, from hell to heauen, from this damnable

and deceitfull world, to Iesus Christ, that then thou maist boldly say, Now shoot death when thou wilt; for although thou bereaue mee of this transitorie and momentanie life,Heb. 13. yet by a strong and constant faith I possesse the kingdome of heauen, which shall giue mee infinitely more then thou canst take from mee.
                        
                        
                           Meditation of the soule not to delay repentance.
                           Delay not (O soule) thy repentance vntil thou be sicke,Eccl. 12. but worke thy conuersion euen now with-all diligence: put not off from day to day thy amendment of life,

neither continue in wickednesse vntill deaths vncertaine houre approach.
                        
                        
                           A praier when first we fall sicke.
                           
                              O Iesus Christ▪ my Redeemer, preserue me from a painfull sicknesse, violent and hastie death, ouertake mee not in my sinnes, and suffer mee not to die without repentance, and giue vnto mee (if it be thy pleasure) a quiet and patient departure, that without great paine and griefe I may in my right wits attaine a blessed end, confessing thy most holy name vntill the last gaspe, and so to commend my soule and spirit with my whole

heart carefully into thy mercifull hands, my most gratious and louing Sauiour and Redeemer, to whom with God the Father and the holy spirit be rendred from the bottome of my heart all honour, power, might, maiestie and dominion, now and for euer. Amen.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. II. Wherein is comprehended the true and right art to die well, and first of Christian repentance.
                     
                        Flesh.
                        BEcause wee neuer are vnpursued by death, it is very needfull therefore,

that both Young and Old, Great and Small, Rich and Poore, should learne the art of dying blessedly.

                           to day a King, to morrow dead, yea (ô Soule) death is like a Mower,Eccl. 10. which walkes in a greene meadowe, cutting with his Sithe all he commeth at, and maketh no account whether it be grasse, thistle, or rose, neither considereth hee how old, how beautifull, or how pretious

the hearbes bee, there are none too strong for him, none too young, no castle for height, nor bulwarke for securitie can hold him backe; he wil not be corrupted with siluer, and gold, yea if it were possible that thou couldest giue him the whole kingdomes and riches of the world, hee would not hold off a minute to abide thy time, nor waite a moment for the performance of thy pleasure and will, now this should be our daily meditation, diligently to marke and carefully learne, the day both to liue in Gods feare, and dye in his faour.
                        
                        
                           
                           The young mans prayer.
                           O my God, how is man verely as nothing? how goeth all beautie away as a shadowe? and wretched man knoweth not whether he shall dye old or young, neither can any by his riches strength and powre,
                              
                                 Ps. 144.4.

                                 Ps. 119.1.9
                               according to thy word, gouerne me by thy holie Spirit, that my heart goe not a whoring from thee, that my youth neuer puffe mee vppe to bragge thereof,
                              
                                 Ps. 73.27.
                               and that I put not my

trust in health, strength, honour, riches, or beautie: graunt that I may in my inward mind heare the end of all, which is, to serue thee, and keepe thy commaundements:
                              
                                 Eccles. 22.13.14.
                               for this is the whole duetie of man, for thou wilt bring euerie man vnto iudgement, with euery secret thing, whether it bee good or euill: Lord write this same in my heart, and giue me thy grace, not onely to vnderstand the same, but also, to rectifie my life and conuersation thereby, vnto my last end; and graunt that I may die vnto sin, and liue vnto righteousnesse, to the glorie of thy holy name through Iesus Christ my sauiour. Amen.

                           A Prayer for speedie Repentance.
                           Praysed bee thou my God, who hast no pleasure in our death and destruction, but rather that wee should turne from our sinfull waies and liue,
                              Ezek. 18. Ezek. 33. helpe me Lord Iesus, that I delay not my conuersion to thee, and shift not ouer my repentance from day to day, for thou hast promised me thy mercie; but that I might deferre my repentance vntil the morrow, second or third day, thou hast not promised, vouchsafe therefore thy mercie on mee this verie day,Ps 95. Tit. 3. 
                              that I may redeeme the time lost, by an earnest

repentance, and not bee taken in my sins, and trespasses the day following, graunt this for the glorie of thy blessed name, through Iesus Christ my Lord and Sauior. Amen.
                        
                     
                     
                        Flesh.
                        What is then true and Christian repentance?

                           Repentance is nothing else, then that a man rise from his sinne, and turne with all his heart vnto God, which consisteth in these three heads.
                        
                        
                           1 That a man acknowledge his sinne, and be sorrowfull and grieued for it

from his verie hart.
                        
                           2 That he despaire not by reason of his sinne, but beleeue in Iesus Christ, who hath payed and satisfied for him, and reioyce greatly therein.

and counterfait, nor my saith false and deceitfull, but vpright and from my heart, and may shew it selfe in true fruits vnto the end:Mat. 13. heare mee gratious God I beseech thee, that so I may attaine life euerlasting, through Iesus Christ my Lord and Sauiour.

afraid for my sinnes, Oh how am I astonished before thy presence; for loe (my God) thy commaundements are before mine eyes, yea written in my conscience, and I know they are the rule & square of euerlasting equitie, whereby I should haue beene taught thy holy obedience; vnder payne of losse of Saluation, but O wretched corruption, alas the miserable confusion and perturbation of all my sences, affections and powres, alas that great euil, that hath ouerwhelmed vs by Adams fal, my heart alas, can no wayes condiscend to the performing of thy will.

thou hast lost in Adam the trespasser: ô miracle of all miracles! who can comprehend such things? bee glad ô my soule and consider narrowly what thou losest in the first, & what was gotten in the second Adam againe.
                           Behold how Sathan is disappointed of his purpose, for hee minded to draw thee altogether, and finally from God, and to draw thee in the pit of Gods euerlasting displeasure, but contrarywise Christ thy Lord hath not onely reconciled thee with thy father, quenched his wrath and anger, and purchased mercy to thee, but also hath aduanced

thee to such vnspeakable promotion,Heb. 2. that thou art become Gods kinsman, for he hath taken thy flesh & bloud vpon him, thou couldest neuer haue come to higher promotion and preferment, vnlesse thou hadest beene euen God himselfe. And Sathan bethought him to driue thee out of the garden of Paradise, and so bereaue thee of the companie and societie of the holy Angels: but quite contrarie, Christ thy Sauiour not only brings thee to that healie Paradise and eternall life, but exalteth thee aboue all Angels, and maketh thee most honourable in that he took not the

Angels, but mans nature vpon him:
                              Heb 2. Sathan also intended to take from thee the food of life, and it so happened, for the Lord God excluded man by reason of his transgression that he should not eat of the tree of life in Paradise,
                              Gen. 3. but now Christ is that nourishment,Ioh. 6. and tree of life farre more excellent and good then that first, which extends and dilateth his boughes and branches, whereby wee come vp to heauen, hideth vs vnder him, feedeth vs of him, and wee are satiate and shall haue vnder his shadow, quietnesse and rest for euermore. Againe, Sathan would

haue carried thee from thy righteousnesse, cast thee deepely downe into sinne, spoyled thee of thy originall justice, wherein without sinne thou wert first created to Gods similitude; but on the other side, Christ thy Lord freely giueth thee a constanter, surer, and better righteousnesse, which is his merit and satisfaction by Faith imputed vnto thee,Philip. 3. 
                              and is that Righteousnesse which God onely accepteth of.

                              healed thy soares and wounds by his stripes and death, begot thee againe by the holie spirit, and imprinted his image of new, but also he will at the last day cleare thy mortall bodie, and make it like to his glorious bodie.
                           
                           To be short, Sathans course was to take all thy gifts and heauenly ornaments from thee, and

throw thee head-long to euerlasting perdition: but Iesus Christ opposed himselfe, and ayded thee in such wayes, that not onely hee tooke this flesh and bloud vpon him, satisfied for thee, made attonement for thee, reconciled thee with his Father, obtayned eternall remission for thee, gaue thee his righteousnesse, his holie spirit, and euerlasting life, but also he promoted thee to bee accounted righteous, holie, Gods child, Gods heyre, his brother, his cousin, his bride and bed-fellow heyre, the Temple and habitation of the holy and glorious Trinitie.

especially to distinguish this word aright, and marke what difference there is between the Law and the Gospell.
                        
                        Gods Law or his Commaundements is a doctrine and word wherein God wills and commaunds vs to be obedient vnto him in heart and whole life, that is,Ex. 20. Mat. 22. Deut. 6. Leu 9. That wee should loue the Lord our God with our whole heart, soule, mind, & strength, & our neighbor as our selfe, which things albeit they are impossible for man eyther to doe or keepe, notwithstanding thou shalt daylie meditate and weigh these precepts,Rom. 3. to the end thou mayest learn to know the

corruption of thy nature and sinne, and also they may be a rule, after which thou oughtest to lead thy life, as a new creature in holie Obidience.

corrupt, that thou canst fulfil not one of the least of them, and therefore that thou by sinne deseruest Gods wrath and euerlasting perdition, despaire not yet for all this, but thanke God for his commaundements, that by them thou art brought to acknowledge thy sinnes, for this is the dearest and most pretious thing that can bee in this world, (Christs fauour excepted) to know Sinne, for Christ and his benefits doe neuer tast vs well, vntill wee be brought to the knowledge of our sins, and perceiue our selues to be vnder the wrath and fury of the Lord our God.

                           when once he was vnder the curse of the law, and satisfied for my sinne, and

beared his fathers wrath for the same,
                           Matth. 27.46. I will therefore heereafter be enimy to all sin, & keep me from it, as from the Diuell himselfe, I thank thee, ô God, who hast once deliuered mee from sinne, which is the Diuels snare, should I giue my selfe to be intrapped againe in his net? our soule is escaped euē as a bird out of the snare of a fowler,
                           Psal. 124.7.8. 
                           the snare is broken & we are deliuered, our helpe is in the name of the Lord which hath made heauen & earth. And if Sathan shall cast before thee the course of this world, and entise thee to the pleasure thereof, call to minde that wee should not fashion our

                           Another Prayer after receiuing the holie Communion.
                           Helpe me Lord (Iesus my Redeemer) that I may frequent this holie communion, and joyfully embrace that remembrance of thee: behold I

am thy brother, and fellow-heyre, and haue right to thy kingdome: where should I goe but to thy own table? succor me my Sauiour, that I may greedily desire this thy great Feast: let my mind neuer loose remembrāce of Thee, but that my repose, quietnesse, and faith and greatest joy may bee in Thee, and euermore giue Thee thankes with feruencie from the groūd of my heart, for all thy goodnesse and graces, so plētifully showred down vpon mee, but more specially, for that after this perishing world shall decay, I am ordayned to eat that Bread of Life

thee drinke of that cup, should I not minister vnto my brother, fellowheire with mee my bread, and refresh him with that thou hast giuen mee? gouerne me, ô Lord Iesus, by thy holy spirit, that I euer may dearely loue my neighbor, & be touched at my heart with the miserie of the poo

                        Spirit.
                        Fourthly (deare Soule) prepare thee euerie day, for the crosses and chastisemēts, which the children of God in this world must beare after their Mr. for we must throgh many afflictions enter into the kingdome of God:Act. 14.22 yea (my Soule) that doctrine of the Crosse is one of the

most secret and hid mysteries, into the which mans iudgement and knowledge cannot reach, but both it and all other concealed matters, are manifested in Gods word onely, out of which word we ought to be edified in this poynt. Now hereof it commeth (beloued Soule) that the crosse is heauie for vs to beare; wee are greatly affrayd of it, euen as though the Lord had left vs, or as if hee were our mortall foe, & deadly enemie. A prettie and pithie similitude hereof we haue in the Two Desciples,
                           Luk. 24 13 
                           which went from Ierusalem to Emmaus in perplexitie and sorrow, to whom

the Lord manifested himselfe in another forme, so that their eyes were held that they could not know him; Loe (deare soule) this is a figure of the crosse, in the which the Lord so clotheth and couereth himselfe, that hee appeareth to be a stranger, yea euen to his most beloued children, and so doth take solace in the compasse of this earth,Pro. 8.31. and delight with the children of men, yea sometime hee seemeth so farre against them, that they imag

                        Spirit.
                        All true Christians are thereto appoynted of God, for whom he knew

before he also predestinated to be made like to the image of his Sonne, that he might be the first born among many brethren, so wast thou ordayned to Anxieties & Crosses, not onely before thou wast born of thy mother,
                           Rom▪ 8.29 but also, before the foundation of the world was layd, that thou mightest resemble the Lord Iesus Christ, yea thou art flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, shall thou not then suffer with him?Eph. 6.30. he is thy Maister, and thou his desciple, he thy Bridegroome, and thou his Bride, he is thy Head, and thou art his Members, why wilt thou then desire to bee in better

cōdition than he was? Looke on the Lord as on the Prince of the Crosse, and consider how all the Saints and faithfull ones haue euer followed him.
                           Mat. 11.29.30.
                        
                        Christ goeth first, making way with the most heauie Crosse vpon his shoulders, and the godlie tread on his footsteps, for euerie one beareth his owne yoake:Rom 8.37. neuerthelesse in all troubles they are more than conquerours through him that loued them: and because they are conformable vnto Christ in suffering, so shall they bee conformable vnto him in glorie also.

                              O Lord God, thou who hast prouided thy son for mee to beare the burden of the crosse, giue mee a wise heart, that I may perceiue thy wonderfull purpose and counsell heerein, that I may take it vp willingly, and follow my Redeemer cheerfully, and so shew my submission and obedience to him heere for a short time, but heereafter eternally, to raigne with him euerlastingly, to God the Father, Sonne and holy Ghost, bee giuen of mee

his correction, It was good for mee (saith Dauid) that thou chastizedst mee that I might learne thy iudgements.

hang vpon the crosse with disdain and all kind of reproch, grant that I neuer blush to stand by thy crosse with the Virgin Mary, and if thou bring me thereunto mercifully & maruellously help me to follow thee,Ioh. 19.25. & bee prepared (if neede bee) to lay down my life for thy sake, according to thy pleasure: grant this heauenly father, for Iesus Christs sake, my only Sauiour and Redeemer, to whom bee all honour and glory.

moment: but with euerlasting kindnesse will I haue mercy on thee,
                           Esay 54.7. 
                           saith the Lord thy Redeemer: the mountaines shall depart and the hils be remoued: but his kindnesse shall not depart from thee, neither shall the couenant of my mercy and peace bee remoued from thee,Vers. 10. 
                           saith the Lord, that hath mercy on thee: for how should hee lie, who is verity himselfe, Light therefore is sowen vnto the godly in darknesse, and therefore,Psal. 112 4 Rom. 8. Psal. 23.1. 
                           if God be with vs, who can bee against vs. Now then the Lord is thy sheepheard, thou shalt want nothing that is good for thee.

                        The Crosse serueth Gods children to their good, for wee know that all things worke together for good to them that loue God, to them who are called according to his purpose;Rom. 8.28. Pro. 27.6. 
                           and faithfull are the wounds of a freind.
                        
                        And truely it serueth many waies to our weale, for it teacheth vs the knowledge of our sinnes, for hee doth correct in

measure, and will not leaue vs altogether vnpunished:
                           Ier. 30.11. and therefore the Lord knoweth that the way of man is not in himselfe, neyther is it in man that walketh to direct his steps:Ier. 10.13.14. 
                           O Lord (sayth the Prophet) correct mee but with iudgement, not in thine anger, least thou bring mee to nothing: thus hee chastiseth vs for sinne, and will not leaue vs wholly vnpunished,
                           Ier. 46.28. to the end we may bee driuen narrowly to espie our sinnes and transgressions, & descend more earnestly into the inward parts of our harts Againe, the crosse sends vs to the word of God, when we are frosen in our

heere vpon earth should be idle,
                           Matth. 12. 36. but hath allotted vnto euery one, his seuerall trade and worke in their owne measure: for the Lord our God himselfe is not idle: but worketh, gouerneth, vpholdeth, and ordereth all things, preserueth, blesseth, heares and helps euery true heart. My father (saith he) worketh hit herto,

Psal. 19.1. 2. and perfit their appoyntment and calling, euen so (deare Soule) should euery man that is whole, euery day exercise his calling in his owne estate, earnestly and diligently: for hee should learne, preach, gouerne, correct, defend, spare, beg, augment, and haue care for his household, and those committed to his charge, as if hee were heere euer to abide, and neuer to die, and that he must doe by Gods commandement, and loue to his successors: but hereto hee should so liue euerie day,1 Tim. 1.19. so keepe faith and a

good conscience, as if at euery moment hee were to take his fare-well from this world, and that hee may say with Paul, The time of my departure is at hand, I haue fought a good fight, I haue finished my course, I haue kept the faith, hencefoorth is layd vp for mee a crowne of glorie: which the righteous Iudge shall giue mee at that day, and not to mee onely, but vnto them also that loue his appearing.

called with all lowlinesse and meeknesse, and with long suffering, and see also that, that thou rather abide in a low estate, which is better then that which the world climbeth vnto, but if the Lord shall promote and exalt thee, bee not proud, but the greater thou art, and higher in authority in this world, be thou the humbler: for the Lord is high aboue all nations,
                              Psal. 113.5.7.8. and his glory aboue the heauens, yet hee humbleth himselfe to behold the things that are in heauen and in earth, hee raiseth vp the poore out of the dust, and lifteth the needie out of the mire, that he may set him with

the Princes of his people: so the Lord casts downe the proud,

before thou come vnto the Lord; for so did King Asa,

But especially take heed that you vse no forbidden means, and aske not counsell of Witches, or those which doe helpe by the meanes of the Deuill, through the abuse of Gods holie name,
                           2▪ Kin. 1.6. for so did King Ahaziah consult with the Idoll of Baalzebub (the god of Ekron) whether he should recouer of his disease. Is it because there is not a God of Israell, that thou sendest to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?
                           
therefore thou shalt not come off from that bedd on which thou art gone vp, but shalt surely dye. Be circumspect also, and seeke out the best practised and skilfullest Physitians; for mans bodie is the pretious creature of God, and should be honoured and no wayes neglected.
                        
                           Another Prayer for the Sicke.
                           I thanke thee Lord Iesus Christ, true Physitian of my soule, that thou hast cured my heart, and clensed it from sinne, by that heauenlie medicine from aboue. I earnestly intreat thee (who hast made all things) that thou wouldest

blesse these outward helpes and meanes which thou hast ordayned▪
                              Mat. 8.2. 
                              Lord (if thou wilt) thou canst make mee whole, and by these ayds restore mee to health: but if thou wilt not, those cannot helpe mee. Loe, here I am, doe with mee according to thy will and pleasure, so that euer respect bee had to thy glorie, my weale and saluation; Graunt these blessings vnto mee for Iesus Christ thy sonnes sake, in whose name I pray vnto thee, saying: Our Father which art in Heauen, &c.

but vnderstand, that in the greatest crosses thou art dearest vnto him;Ps. 55.19. but the wicked, because they haue no changes, therefore they feare not God: But as for thee, no more than a mother can forget her child, can hee forget thee;Esa. 49.15.16. for behold he hath grauē thee vpon the palmes of his hands; yea the sicker the child is, the greater is the mothers loue, and the more diligently & watchfully doth she attend; and so doth the Lord with thee: speakes he not consolation in thy heart? and saith, Art thou not my deare Sonne, and beloued child?
                           Ier. 31.20. 
                           I haue loued thee with an euerlasting loue:

therefore, with louing kindnesse, haue I drawne thee: thy Soule shall be as a watered Garden,
                           12. 
                           and thou shalt not sorrow any more at all. I will satiate thy Soule with fatnesse,

                           and thou shalt bee satisfied with goodnes (saith the Lord) and therefore the Lord is mercifull and gratious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercie:
                           Ps. 103.8 9 10.11.13. 
                           he will not alwayes chide, neyther will hee keepe his anger for euer: Hee hath not dealt with vs after our sinnes, nor rewarded vs according to our iniquities; for as the heauen is high aboue the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that feare him: like as a Father pittieth his children, so the

Lord hath pittie of them that feare him. Loe (deare Soule) thy Father nor mother haue such pittie towards thee, as thy Sauior; and therefore thou oughtest to bemoane thy selfe thus;Ier. 31.18.

                           Lord Iesus Christ my Redeemer, I complayne that my miserie vexeth mee so sore, and that my sicknesse endureth so long. I request thee thou eternall Word of thy eternall Father, thou liuely comforter, proclayme Consolation in my heart; that I in my greatest infirmitie, anguish, and pangs of death, may vnderstand

that I am thy deare child, and cast my selfe in thy armes and bosome: turn neuer thy gratious countenance from mee, yea Lord the time thou diddest hang vpō the crosse, tookest our rebuke and reproach vpon thee, and wast destitute of the helpe of all creatures: yet wast thou notwithstanding thy Fathers onely begotten Sonne, and shalt so bee eternally. When faithfull Ioseph was in Bonds,Ge. 41.14. and had no whit of any creatures fauour: Yet wast thou with him, loued him, and deliuered him in due season. When Stephan was lead to death,Act. 7.55. and stones cast at him,

didst not thou manifest thy selfe vnto him, when replenished with inward ioy, and full of the holy Ghost; he looked vp stedfastly into heauen, and saw the glory of God, and Iesus standing on the right hand of God. And Lazarus when hee lay at the rich mans gate full of sores:Luk. 16.22 yea, and the dogs came and shewed greater humanity than man, yet was he carried by the Angels into Abrahams bosom. O my God, I am thy vvretched Lazarus, heere lie I knocking at thy gate, with my pitifull groans; naked and full of sores am I, my pain is great, and my torment will ouercome me:

but I know assuredly, and heereunto 1000. witnesses haue I in mine heart, by thy holy Spirit, that thou wilt not forsake me: thine eyes are ouer mee night and day, as one of thine Elect, I appertaine to thy euerlasting life; therefore thou art with mee in this my distresse,Psal. 91.9. I haue made thee my refuge and my habitation; ô set not mine iniquities before thee, neither secret sinnes in the light of thy countenance; for who knowes the power of thine anger,Psal. 90.11 euen according to thy feare, so is thy wrath. O let the beauty of my Lord my God bee vpon me, and satisfie mee

early with thy mercy, that I may reioyce and bee glad, all the daies I haue to liue: now Lord I loue loue thee, therefore deliuer me, and shew me thy saluation, for Christ Iesus thy sonnes sake, to whom with the holy Spirit, be all honour. Amen.

craftie and subtil for thee: for of thine owne nature,Gen. 3.1. thou canst neuer gainestand him; remember Adam and Eue, who were deceiued by him, and miserably seduced, although they were in the state of innocency, and in their pure and holy nature; how canst thou then wretched and corrupt sinner encounter him?

                        Moreouer, the weapons which Iesus Christ vsed against him, are to bee considered of thee, which were places and sentences of Scripture;Eph. 6.17. euen so lay thou hand on the holy sword of Gods word, the sword (I say) of the Spirit,

                           there grace hath superabounded: If he

say, that Christs merits belong not vnto thee, thou art not of the number of the Elect, then exclaime and say, thou liest Sathan: for Christ hath sayd, come vnto mee all yee that are weary and are heauy laden, and I will giue you rest: and gaine, as in Adam all die, euen so in Christ shall all be made aliue.

                           I thanke thee (Almightie Lord God) that thou so kindly & fatherly hast visited and chastised mee for my offences: it is good for mee that thou hast humbled mee, that I might learne thy precepts.

But I now vnderstād (O Lord) that this my sicknesse is not vnto death, but for the glorie of God, that thou Son of God mightest be glorified thereby; for thou hast had mercie vpon mee: thou hast cast all my sinnes behind thy back: Thou louedst my soule and deliueredst it from the pit of corruption: how comfortably hast thou

turned my sicknesse into health: I thanke thee my God, yea I thanke thee from the bottom of my hart, that thou hast raysed mee from my bed, that I may visit and frequēt thy house, walke in my calling, and perfit my actions.
                              Lam. 3 22. It is of thy goodnesse and mercies that I am not consumed, because thy compassions fayle not. O how oft should I remember this thy rod of correction? how wisely should I walke all my dayes, that I may eschew thy wrath: assist mee (my God) that with the new health of my bodie I may begin to lead a new life: graunt that I may alwayes praise

thy name, gouerne mee by thy holy Spirit, that I may glorifie thee by my life, and not giue my membersweapons of vnrighteousnesse to serue sinne, for thou hast deliued my soule from death; which hath waited for me, thou art my help and my shield, my heart shall reioyce heereafter, euery moment in thee; for thou hast compassed me with songs of deliuerance, I will praise thee in the congregation, in the midst of the people I will sing vnto thee, ô Lord: To whom be praise and glory, now and for euer. Amen.

The Infidell, prophane, vngodly, often wish to die, and that of impatiency, because of the great misery wherewith God punisheth them for their sinnes: for seeing they are without the knowledge of God, and without faith, they are not participant of the crosse of Christ, but despaire in impatiency, grudge against God, & wish themselues not onely to die, but also often times lay violent hands on themselues, as Iudah, Saul and

                           Achitophel did: purposing to put an end thereby to their sorrow and misery, but then is it, that first they begin to haue proofe of their wickednesse, sweet heauenly Father keepe vs from hence.

pray for deliuerance from transitory distresses of soule or bodie: but we aske from our heart, that God would either put an end to this sinnefull and wicked world; or else come in a blessed time, and pull vs from hence to euerlasting rest and quietnesse.

euer I shorten the dayes of my life which thou hast giuen bee; but grant that euermore day by day, I may learne to know thee, to establish and confirme my faith, and the longer I shall liue, the more dearly to loue thee, to the end I may learne to contemne this world, and to long after that heauenly world, which thou hast made to stand in the conquest of Christ by his bloud. To whom with thee and thy holy spirit, one blessed God, I render praise and and glory, now and euer. Amen.

continue with you all, for your furtherance and ioy of Faith.
                        
                           A meditation of the Soule tossed in the troublesome waues of this life.
                           Here mayest thou perceiue (beloued Soule) that Paule was tossed with two diuers opinions and thoughts: he longed for rest, and counted it best, esteemed it also good that hee should abide in the flesh longer, and beleeued that God would spare him, that in his ministerie hee might further serue both God and Man: yet in both these, had this only before his eyes, that

Christ should be magnified in his bodye, whether it were by life or by death. So doth also the king Ezekiah,
                              2. King. 20.1.2.6. to whom the Prophet Amos denounced death: but he turned his face vnto the Wall, and prayed vnto the Lord, who added vnto his daies fifteene yeares. And so was also Paule greatly joyed for his brother, and companion in labour, and fellow-souldier Epaphroditus who was sicke,

                                  also (saith Paule,) least I should haue sorrow vpon sorrow. Follow these examples, and thou shalt not goe amisse;

for if thou canst be necessarie vnto God, and thy neighbour, it is conuenient thou shouldest craue a long and sound life, that thou mayest bee a profitable vessel of mercie, and chosen to good actions: Neuertheles, submit thee alwayes to his will, and be readie euerie day to be dissolued, for time is but lent thee.

                           O Lord Iesus Christ, thou who wast so resolute and ready to thy passion, and so obedient vnto death, euen the death of the crosse, and didst say,Phil. 2.8. 
                              father not as I will, but as thou wilt. I request thee my Redeemer, giue me a submissiue heart, that when the day of my dissolution shall approach, I may willingly condiscend to thy will: for thou knowest my infirmity, and that flesh and bloud is afraid

to vndergo it. Lord bow mee to thy word, and conduct mee in thy footsteps; that I may euer commit my selfe and my life vnto thy trust, my Lord and God, and most comfortable Redeemer, thou art God, and all that thou doest is good, thou neuer didst disappoint any that put their hope in thee: heere I am Lord in thy mercifull hand, If I liue, I liue vnto thee, If I die,
                              Rom. 14.8. 
                              I die to thee, whether wee liue or die, wee are the Lords. For I know and am assured,
                              Vers. 9. 
                              that to this end, Christ both died & reuiued, that he might be Lord, both of the dead and liuing: In whose name I pray vnto

thee, as hee hath taught: Our Father, &c.

                        It is yet notwithstanding pleasant to bee in the world, for beautifull is this earth which wee see, who would not rather abide heere then depart?

                        All the children of the world sing that song, but (deare Soule) be not thou conformed to this world: say not, this is the course and custome of the world, but remember that the course of the world tendeth to hell, but wee are the children of the faithfull, and looke for a life,

which the Lord will giue vnto them, that abide constantly in faith before him. But as for the world, the Scripture determineth of it, and saith, that the whole world lyes in wickednesse,
                           Ioh. 5.19. and therefore commandeth that wee should not loue the world, nor the things that are in the world;

                           for if any man loue the world, the loue of the father is not in him, for all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, & the pride of life, is not of the father, but of the world: and the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doth the will of God abideth for euer: And againe, striue

Yea, vnto him that is yet able to receiue meat.

                           Helpe mee Lord Iesus Christ, that I may vse the pleasures and riches of this world, as a pilgrim▪ which shall passe to morrow: for surely, euerie man walketh in a vaine shew, hee is disquieted in vaine, hee heapeth vp riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them? and now Lord what wait I for, my hope is in thee, deliuer mee from all my transgressions,Psa. 39.7.8. let my

heart desire no more then my daily bread, to my sustētatiō; cause me to be contented, keepe me that Mammon be not my Master, and that I place not my confidence in any transitory thing; for it will hinder mee in the time of death: but help mee, my God, that I may rightly chuse that good part, which shall not be taken away from mee,

                              ▪ so shall I haue enough, both heere and in the world to come: that I

may willingly leaue this world, and gladly without any impediment, be carried by thy Angells into Abrahams bosome, to rest for euer. Amen.

                        These are fleshly and incredulous thoughts, by

the which Sathan often disquieteth the heart of man; so that there is great paynes to be taken before man will be rightly aduised. For we haue experience of many men grudging against God, as though he did doe them great vnrighteousnesse, because hee maketh them so soone die, and leaue the pleasures of this Life; especially when they haue all their affaires to dispose, and put the matters of all their life time in order. So did that noble Romane GAIVS MARIVS, who (although hee had beene Consull seuen times in Rome, and was seuentie yeares of age) yet

fretted against his FORTVNA (which was his Goddesse) protesting in bitter exclamations, that there was great wrong offered him, before that all his dessignements had beene accomplished, and brought to passe. But the faithfull Children of God doe farre otherwise: for they know they are not the God or Makers of their friends, neyther can prouide for them, but that they are Stewards and Seruants appoynted vnder God,
                           Luk. 16.2. 
                           so long as it pleaseth him. And man in these his dayes layes hold on eternitie, but God hath so prouided for them, that one time or other hee wil

call them to giue an account of their Stewardship, and may no longer be Stewards. And so he himselfe will be both Father and Tutour, as hee often nameth himselfe in the Scripture,Ps. 68.5. 
                           Defender of the Widow; and Father of the fatherlesse, euen God in his holie habitation. And so both scripture and daylie experience teach vs, that many Widowes are in better case after their Husbands death; and manie Husbands in better condition of Life after their Wiues death and Children often better prouided and cared for, their Parents beeing out of this world, than if they liued,

or than they could haue done for them, if they should haue liued longer. The Lord deceiue

For although he be high aboue all Nations,
                           Ps. 113.46.

                           Fatherlesse-Children, that he in them may magnifie his goodnesse. And therfore this is a sure ground to build vpon, that hee will in such wayes haue care & foresight for them if they will acknowledge him and accept him for their Father; yea neuer a one of them shall haue occasion in the last day to complayne of his prouidence ouer them, and defence of them: for it is hee onely that rayseth vp the Poore out of the dust,
                           Ps. 113.6.7 
                           and lifteth the needie out of the dung-hill; that he might set them with Princes, euen with the Princes of his people: yea it is he onely who setteth the Poore on

high from affliction, and maketh them families like a flocke.

And hast deliuered mee from

hell, yea I am thy brother, and fellow heire, and all that thou hast is mine; yea I am thy beloued deere bride, thy pleasure and thy joy, thy treasure which thou hast dearely bought. I am likewise the temple and habitation of thy holie spirit, by whom I am sealed vnto the day of redemption: yea Lord Iesus thou hast so reconciled, and vnited mee, that I am Bone of thy Bone, and Flesh of thy Flesh: yea all thy creatures should rather come to naught, thā that I should bee seperated from thy loue: what then can death worke vpon mee? surely nothing else, but that I may more

                           How could the Lord

giue vnto thee greater security? thou hast his promise, that he by the power of his holy Spirit, shall giue his word for thee, thy faith shal not decay: and will not his father heare him, when he prayed for Peter and for thee, that thou shouuldest not be pluckt out of his, or his Fathers hand; and that the good part in thine heart, should not bee reft from thee? Now therefore art thou sure, both of eternall life, and of thy constancy and perseuerance thereunto, and that thou (through his mercie) mayest stedfastly abide vnto the end, hee will not leaue thee, and thou shalt

not leaue him: yea, thou shalt apprehend him, o

                           O Lord Iesus Christ, Thou alone art my eternall Portion and Part, which I haue chosen, and am certaine, that euen when mine heart shall breake, it shall not bee taken from mee: ô Thou Almighty Redemer, who can doubt of thee? ô Thou powerfull Sheepheard, who shall pluck me out of thy hands? ô Thou louing Sauiour,
                              1 Ioh. 4.8. who art loue it selfe, who will separate me from thy loue? Thou hast kindled and raised in mine heart (already) a taste of the sweetnesse of the euerlasting

habitations, and thou hast made me haue experiēce therof, by many and ioyfull deliuerances. Yea Lord, I perceiue the witnesse of thy holy Spirit in mine heart, which witnesseth vnto my spirit, that I am the childe of God, and so fellow-heire with thee thou art the vine and I am a branch in thee, thou art the tree of life, and I am engrafted in thee: thou art the Bride-groome, and I the Bride wedded vnto Thee, made one with thee, and ioyned with thee by an euerlasting indissoluable couenant, that neither the Diuell or distresse shall weaken, crosse or infirmity loose and breake for

euer. For I am betrothed vnto Thee, in righteousnesse,
                              Hos. 2.19.20. 
                              in iudgement, and in louing kindnesse, and in mercies: yea, I am betrothed vnto Thee in faithfulnesse, and I doe know thee my Lord. O how burneth my heart to thee!Psal. 42 2. O when shall I come and appeare before thee, my God in heauen, there to liue with thee for euer? Amen.

                           What shall the Christian doe, when hee shall not finde such assurance of faith, but great imbecillity, coldnesse and drowzinesse, oftentimes doubting whether he be one of the Elect or not?

                        Hee should not suffer such doubtings and weaknesses to lodge in his hart, but remember that the Kingdome of Heauen suffereth violence,
                           Matth. 11.12. and is gotten by force, and the violent take it by force: yea, thou shouldst bee mindefull of the Apostles admonition:

For daily experience doth teach, that the more one resorts to the word of God, and pondereth vpon the comfortable sentences of the Scripture in his minde, he obtaineth the greater comfort in his heart, but especially when he meditates vpon this heauenly summons and citation of the Lord,Mat. 11.28. 
                           Come vnto mee all you that labour and are heauie laden, and I will giue you rest.

                              Matth. 23.37. 
                              or as a good sheepheard goeth after that which is lost,
                              Luk. 15.4.5.6. vntill hee finde it, and when hee hath found it, hee layeth it on his shoulders, reioycing, and when hee commeth home, hee calleth together his friends, and his neighbours, saying vnto them, rejoyce with mee for I haue found the

sheepe which was lost, Consider therefore that thou art euen one of these who are wearied and burthened, to whom the Lords Proclamation belongeth: and therefore wheere hee saith, Seeke my face continually; answer thou in thy heart, and say, I will seeke thy face continually. Thus the Lord will looke vnto him that is poore,Esay 66..2. and of a contrite Spirit, & trembleth at this word Knowest thou not (deare Soule) that the Lord receiues him that is weake in faith? For a weake faith is a true faith, when as it wrastleth, striues, and leaues not off, but sticketh vnto the word, wherein

in the promise is contayned. And therefore is it well sayd by Luther,
                              In Gen. ca. 26. 
                              If God keepe not promise, wee haue done with saluation: but God will keepe it, and not lye. And therefore albeit our h

                              arts doubt, wee must haue our recourse vnto him, who will not change: for the Lord speaketh so of himselfe; I am the Lord, and lye not. And againe, Gods gifts and callings are without repentance. Consider this (deare Soule) and hold thee fast by Gods word. He appeareth to be angry but is well pleased,

Cor. 1.9. but on him who rayseth the dead, and can make the weak and feeble strong and valiant. Hee hath no pleasure in presumption, but his will is that we should serue him with feare,Ps. 2.11. and reioyce with trembling. And we may see in Peter and Thomas, what it is to bee too

much confident, and to build vpon our own courage and strength.Ier. 17.9. 
                              No man knoweth himselfe aright, but all things are naked, and open to the eyes of him with whom we haue to doe. And therefore pray continually, that mercifully hee would vphold thee to the end; and bee persuaded, if at any time thou hast felt comfort, that God will certainely come again to thee: and if that at any time he hath ioyed thy heart, that hee certainly oftner & oftner will doe it for thy comfort. Yea, if in all thy life time thou hadst receiued but onely one drop of comfort; yet doubt not, but

pray, beleeue, hope, and haue patience:Hab. 2.3. the Lord will certainely come, and will not delay, vnlesse thou bee altogether stifnecked and vnwilling. Remember the example of the Cananitish woman.
                              Mat. 15.21. 
                              Behold how her Lord ieasteth with her, how he dismisseth her, yea euen thrice: First, hee holdeth his peace, and answereth not a word: Secondly, hee heareth, but that hee is not come for her good, but for the benefit of the Children of Israel: but the third time he calleth her a Dogge, as vnworthie of his comfort; but what doth shee? for the first (in that Christ was silent) she meeteth him

with a patie
                                    •
                                 t heart, which well could stay and trust: For the second, she answers with a faithfull heart, that shee must haue some portion of his promises: For the third, she meeteth him with an humble heart, and willingly wil be a Dogge, desiring that which appertayned to him, that is, the crums which fal from the table, that is, a verie small helpe, a little deale of comfort, wherewith shee and her daughter would bee contented. Here the Lord cannot hide himselfe longer from her, but presenteth a copious measure of mercie vnto her, saying, O woman, great is thy faith, be it vnto thee euen as thou wilt.
                           
                           
                              But if thou shalt now say, behold, she was strong in Faith, and I am weake, thou must vnderstand, that our faith is resembled vnto a Fencer, who is in the lists against another, for he is euer in feare that he shall be ouercome and be too feeble against his Enemie; euen so is it with Faith, for when we wrastle and fight, wee thinke that wee are weake, and shall loose the Victorie: But it shall not fall out so, for victorie belongeth vnto faith: let it incline whether it will, it appertaineth euer vnto her, yea and a weake Faith shall win the field, and through the Lords strength & power,

                              we shal be kept through faith vnto saluation,

Yet it shal serue (as all other things doe) to our good; for we rest from our labors, and enioy happinesse, because the righteous mans Soule is in Gods hands,

                           A Prayer against Death.
                           O Lord Iesus Christ, thou eternall true Light, inlighten my heart, that as a new creature I may looke vpon Death with new eyes, and not esteeme it for a hurter of mee, but for a messenger by whom

thou callest mee from this wretched world, and translatst me to the kingdome of thy Sonne, from this valley of darkenesse. Euen so, Come Lord Iesus with that Chariot of Elias, and take mee from hence: Now let thy Seruant depart in peace,
                              Luk 2.29. who longeth for quietnesse & rest, through Iesus Christ my onely sauiour. Amen.
                        
                     
                     
                        Flesh.
                        Yet Death is verie terrible, cold, and euill fauored, wee become stiffe, and so must rot in our graues.
                     
                     
                        Spirit.
                        That is also a punishment which God inflicts

on the bodie for sinne, but the children of God look not to the present shew and shape of Death, but looke further off, & consider, how pleasaunt, how soone, how beautifull, how cleare and honourable their bodies shall rise vp at the last day: and corruption shal put on incorruption:
                           1 Cor. 15.53. 
                           & this mortallitie shall put on immortallitie. Then shall be brought to passe the saying that is written; Death is swallowed vp in victorie, and by this the holie man Iob comforted himselfe, for he knew that his Redeemer liued, and that he should rayse him vp from the earth.

                           Strengthen mee, ô my Lord Iesus Christ, that I bee not amazed at the fearefull sight of dead members, nor when I thinke vpon the rottennesse in the graue; and that I shall turne to dust and ashes, but helpe mee, that in a ioyfull hope, I may behold the beauty and cleerenesse, which shall not onely bee in my soule; but euen manifest in my body, that I may bee encouraged thereby, gladly to meet thee, when

euer thou shalt please to call mee, to that spirituall wedding, from this life vnto life eternall, through Iesus Christ my Lord and Sauiour. Amen.

that it consumeth all the acrimonie and bitternesse in death, and causeth the faithfull in the verie period of death, to taste euerlasting ioy and saluation.
                        
                        
                           A prayer to Christ, to keepe vs from a troublesome death.
                           Lord Iesus Christ, thou who tasted st the bitter vinegar of death vpon the Crosse due vnto my sin, and hast greatly complained and bemoaned thy selfe, and in the daies of thy flesh didst offer vp prayers and supplications,
                              Heb. 5.7. with strong crying and teares vnto him that was able to saue thee from death, and wast heard in

that thou fearedst, I beseech thee keepe me from a troublesome and paine full death. Fill my heart with liuely faith, and a rich hope, that I be not greatly affraid of death, nor terrified for the sting thereof: O Iesus, let thy deare and sweet name neuer depart from my heart and memorie, vnto my last breth, that I giue vp the Ghost, and commit my soule vnto thee, to rest for euermore, Amen.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        Flesh.
                        Is there no kinde of phisicke then a man may vse, that hee should not taste the sharpe sting of death?
                     
                     
                        
                        Spirit.
                        Yes verely,Ioh. 8.51. for so the Lord thy redeemer hath said, Verily, verily, I say vnto thee, if a man keepe my saying, hee shall neuer see death. Thou must then learne rightly to applie this phisicke, which is Iesus Christs word; not the word of Moses, which is Gods law; nor mans word, diuels, or witches, but the mercifull preaching of the Gospell, in the which hee promiseth vnto all belieuers remission of sins, righteousnesse which is accepted before God, the holie spirits consolation, and life eternall. And this is the word which the Lord giueth

to the hearts of the Saints, the which vpholdeth them, and whereon they relye both in life and death, and finde Christ and consolation therein; with the which they are so detained and comprehended, that they taste not the bitternes of death because of that sweetnes that is in his promise, and comfort that is in his word.
                        For Christ is in his word, and the word carrieth Christ and his power, he who wil haue the Lord must haue his word, and hee who hath the Lord himselfe, the sweetnesse of his grace and comfort, shall neuer see death, th

What would you haue more (O deare Soule) and for what stayest thou?Rom. 3.4. Receaue that heauenly doctrine in thy heart, vse it well, & keepe it daily, yea euerie moment.

taken away death, the father ouer all sicknesses.
                        Thou needest not inquire of the trial & proofe hereof, behold the examples of the faithfull which haue vsed this phisicke, and by the benefit thereof haue felt no griefe in their vnspeakeable paines, as Saint Stephen,
                           Act. 7.56.59. 
                           Who being full of the holy Ghost and faith in Iesus Christ, looked vp steadfastly into heauen and saw the glorie of God, and Iesus standing on the right hand of God, & they stoned him, calling vpon God, and saying, Lord Iesus receaue my spirit. And Paul hauing this preseruing phisicke, durst daily bragge

against death. I desire to depart, and to bee with Christ. So did Ignatius, and so Policarpus, and St. Laurance, with St. Vincentius, and infinite numbers of others.

                           I Pray thee rehearse some sentences of Gods holy Word, wherewith I may comfort my Soule at the very poynt of death.

                           First, euery Christian must diligently learne to comfort himselfe, by reciting the articles of our faith, which is the compend and summe of all doctrine and comfortable speeches: but especially, hee must learne the three last articles, I beleeue the forgiuenesse of sinnes, resurrection of the body, and life euerlasting. So the faithfull soule must apply the whole articles to himselfe in particular, and so appropriate them vnto himselfe, as if there were none in the world, but hee alone, which should haue benefit thereby. Thereto the

Lord hath appointed the Sacraments to confirme that our faith, as faithfull and true seales, and mercifull tokens, whlch hee hath appointed to these articles. Here thou maiest apprehend thy holy baptisme, wherein thou hast receiued and concluded with God an euerlasting and inuiolable band and couenant of mercy, and so art washed and cleansed by the blood of Christ: Next maist thou comfort thee by the holy Supper, because thou (as the Son of God) art nourished and refreshed at thy Fathers Table, and thereby assured that thou art a true member of Christ, a righteous

heire to whatsoeuer Christ with the sacrifice of his body and bloud hath merited.

                        These words (beloued Soule) are short, but replenished with vnspeakable comfort: and although the Scripture had beene more large herein, yet our weake and infirme hearts are such, and our vnderstanding so small, that wee could not comprehend it: and therefore

the holie Spirit by these speeches openeth but a little windowe, through the which wee may see a little glance, to the end wee may know what wee should beleeue, and hope for, and what to comfort and reioyce vs withall. But when we shall come thither, and possesse such ioy and such gladnesse, then shall wee say one to another as old Elizabeth sayde vnto the Virgin Marie:

                              eternitas; that is, first, the paine of the condemned shall bee so great and manifold, that none can declare it, for they shall be cast into vtter darknesse,
                           Mat. 22.13 
                           where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. They shall be tormented in the flame,Luk. 16.24 
                           The Lord shall raine vpon them snares, fire, and brimstone, and a horrible

tempest, this shall be the portion of their cup, their wormes shall not dye, neither shall their fire be quenched,
                           Esay 66.24

                           A Meditation of the soule on the paines of hell.
                           Behold with these and such like phrases the Scripture giueth vs to vnderstand, that vnspeakeable and vnconceiueable miserie the wicked shall come to, with that grieuous societie of the diuel, who shall ioye in tormenting them, which the religious should often meditate vpon.
                           
                              Secondly, there shall be Poenarum acerbitas, for

that their paine shall bee so bitter and hard, that the condemned cannot endure, and yet they must needes suffer it eternally; for they shal seeke death,Revel 9.6. and shall not finde it, and shal desire to dye, and death shall slie from them; for there shall be neither life nor death, but betwixt life and death shall they bee tormented for euermore. Euen as a red hot coldron vpon a flaming furnace, so shal they be in fire vnspeakeably tormented, and abide in such case for all eternitie.
                           
                              Thirdly, Poenarum aeternitas, for their manifolde and bitter torments shall at no time come to an

end, for so it is said, they shall goe to euerlasting paine:Mat. 25. for were it of a long continuance, and so haue an end, would bee some comfort in their expectation, but eternitie is endlesse,
                              Esa. 34.89 
                              for it is the day of the Lords vengeance, and the streames shall bee turned into pitch, which shal not bee quenched night nor day, yea, their plagues shall ascend in all eternitie,Reuel. 14. and shall haue no end day nor night.

should neuer come from it; truely hee would not desire to liue in that condition. But the damned as they haue no pleasure, but swimme in the euerlasting fire of hell, in eternall anguish and woe, in terrible stincke and darkenesse, in the which they shall not receaue one drop, wherby they might coole or refresh themselues. O then hearken, thou poore miserable childe of the world! meditate hereupon, thou louest the world and pleasures therof, and sayest, it is good to bee heare, behold the time commeth, and truely is not farre off, when thou shalt say with the

rich man, Oh, I am greatly tormented in this flame! yea, thou shalt lament and say with a blasphemous mouth, It is not good to bee here, but there: yet must thou stay, and that euermore, euer burning, & neuer consumed; from the which God of his infinite mercie deliuer vs.

and bettering of my life, and alwaies separate my selfe from the children of darkenesse. Helpe me, that I conforme not my selfe to this wicked world, & so be cast downe to the lowest hels torment: gouerne, teach, and lead mee by thy holy spirit, that I may learne christianly to liue, and when it shall please thee, to dye blessedly; that I come not in the place of euerlasting paine and torment, but with thee Lord my Redeemer, thy Angels, and all thy Saints, may enioy and possesse that endlesse and euerlasting life, purchased by the bloud of thy Son our Lord Iesus Christ,

                     O Sauiour, giue mee that most precious & dearest, giue of all thy Holy Spirit the Comforter, that I may offer a voluntary and free sacrifice of obedience to thee. Giue mee that thou askest, and aske what thou wilt. Alas, as of all other kinde of sinne, so haue I in my selfe sufficient matter and seede, to breed this corruption, for in my feeling I cannot see comfort in my sufferings, in so exceeding great measure is my vnderstanding corrupt, and affections disordered.

I am my Fathers counseller, and am thy wisdome, the Teacher and the thing taught, I

haue no holinesse in my selfe by the flesh, by being borne of my mother, yet do saue great sinners: seek then righteousnesse out of thy selfe in mee, who being no sinner, was accounted a sinner, and punished as a sinner for thee, that thou hauing no righteousnesse, mightest bee accounted righteous, and rewarded as righteous through mee, who am thy righteousnesse,

To Heauen (I tell thee) I haue a two-fold title, one by Inheritance, which I reserue to my selfe alone; another, by purchace and conquest, which I haue giuen thee freely, and wilt thou not relie on these my Mercies?

                     LOrd Iesus, I doe often call to mind the things thou hast done for thy glory and my Soules health, the matter of my thankfulnesse: but I do perseuere in sinne, and deserue not the least crumme of Mercie that fall from thy Table anie more.

                     IS there nothing to bee obtayned of Mee, vnlesse thou bring of thy own to present mee withall? Is not this to discredit

my Mercie, & to bring credit to thy Merits, and rather to binde Mee to thee, than thee to Mee. Is there not with mee plentifull Redemption: If thy sins be great, my redemption is greater: thy merits are beggarly, my Mercie is a Rich Mercie. If thy perill bee not come euen to a desperate case, and past hope of recouery, there is no prayse of redemption: for herein is the power of it, that when all sins haue gone ouer thy head, and all creatures, Sun, Moon, Heauen, and Earth, &c. come as it were in iudgement against thee, yet a cleare and full ransome shal be giuen in thy hand,

therewith to purchase thy deliuerance beyond all expectation, and so as it were to fetch something out of nothing. And when I put to the ordinarie meanes, it is not to withdraw my helpe, in vsing the means, but traine vp thy faith, that after I may make knowne vnto thee, I haue a helpe beyond all helps, for I come to them that calleth not for mee: the possessed, that would not, doe I cure; and the dead, that cannot, doe I rayse. Beleeuest thou this?

O how great is that peace of conscience and ioy in the Holie Ghost, which may be tasted, but cannot be vttered! Now will I not dispute against my selfe longer for

my actions, for beeing displeased with my person, I cannot be pleased with my doings: The body of sinne shall neuer be from me while I liue, the skum thereof is euer boyling in mee, foming out stinking sauour in my mind. I am wearie of my sinne, yet there is no time too late to repent. I will not count what I haue beene, but what I would bee: My workes will do nothing in the matter of my iustification, which from thee, & in thee, is freely giuen mee. I cannot resist Sathan, it is not possible I canne encounter him; but in thee I am more than a Conqueror ouer them all: Neuer one fulfilled the Law but thou, and that thou

hast giuen mee: My conscience seruing the Lawe of Grace, is a glorious Prince to triumph ouer sinne.
