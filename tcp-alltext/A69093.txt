                        Our firſt obſeruance, after any abſence
                        Muſt be preſented euer to our Miſtreſſe:
                        As at our parting ſhe ſhould ſtill be laſt,
                        
                           Hinc Amor vt circulus, from hence tis ſaid
                        That loue is like a circle, being th'efficient
                        And end of all our actions; which excited
                        By no worſe abiect then my matchleſſe miſtreſſe
                        Were worthy to employ vs to that likeneſſe;
                        And be the onely Ring our powers ſhould beate,
                        Noble ſhe is by birth, made good by vertue,
                        Exceeding faire, and her behauiour to it,
                        Is like a ſingular Muſitian
                        To a ſweete Inſtrument, or elſe as doctrine
                        Is to the ſoule, that puts it into Act,
                        
                           And prints it full of admirable formes
                        Without which twere an emptie, idle flame
                        Her eminent iudgement to diſpoſe theſe parts,
                        Sits on her browe and holds a ſiluer Scepter,
                        with which ſhe keepes time to the ſeuerall muſiques,
                        Plac't in the ſacred conſort of her beauties:
                        Loues compleat armorie is manadgd in her.
                        To ſtirre affection, and the diſcipline
                        To checke and to affright it from attempting
                        Any attaint might diſproportion her
                        Or make her graces leſſe then circular;
                        Yet her euen carriage, is as farre from coyneſſe
                        As from Immodeſtie, in play, in dancing
                        In ſuffering court-ſhip: in requiting kindneſſe.
                        In vſe of places, houres, and companies
                        Free as the Sunne, and nothing more corrupted,
                        As circumſpect as Cynthia, in her vowes,
                        And conſtant as the Center to obſerue them,
                        Ruthfull, and bountious neuer fierce nor dull,
                        In all her courſes euer at the full
                        Theſe three yeares, I haue trauaild, and ſo long
                        Have beene in trauaile with her deareſt ſight,
                        Which now ſhall beautifie the enamour'd light.
                        This is her houſe, what? the gates ſhut and cleere
                        Of all attendants? Why, the houſe was wont
                        To hold the vſuall concourſe of a Court,
                        And ſee, me thinks through the encourtaind windowes
                        (In this high time of day) I ſee light Tapers,
                        This is exceeding ſtrange. Behold the Farle
                        Walking in as ſtrange ſort before the dore,
                        Ile know this wonder ſure: My honoured Lord?
                     
                  
                  
                     Vau.
                     Keepe of Sir and beware whom you embrace,
                  
                  
                     Uand.
                     Why flyes your Lordſhip back?
                  
                  
                     Uau.
                     
                        You ſhould be ſure
                        To knowe a man your friend ere you embrac't him.
                     
                  
                  
                     Uand.
                     
                        
                           I hope my knowledge cannot be more ſure
                        Then of your Lordſhips friendſhip.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     Uau.
                     
                        No mans knowledge,
                        Can make him ſure of any thing without him
                        Or not within his power to keepe, or order.
                     
                  
                  
                     Vand.
                     
                        I comprehend not this; and wonder much
                        To ſee my moſt lou'd Lord ſo much eſtrang'd.
                     
                  
                  
                     Vau.
                     
                        The truth is, I haue done your knowne deſerts
                        More wrong, then with your right ſhould let you greet me
                        And in your abſence, which makes worſe the wrong,
                        And in your honour, which ſtill makes it worſe.
                     
                  
                  
                     Vand.
                     
                        If this be all my Lord, the diſcontent
                        You ſeeme to entertaine, is meerly cauſleſſe:
                        Your free confeſſion, and the manner of it,
                        Doth liberally excuſe what wrong ſoeuer,
                        Your miſ-conceit could make you lay on me,
                        And therefore, good my Lord diſcouer it,
                        That we may take the ſpleene, and corſey from it.
                     
                  
                  
                     Vau.
                     
                        Then heare a ſtrange report and reaſon, why
                        
                           I did you this repented iniurie.
                        You know my wife is by the rights of courtſhip,
                        Your choſen Miſtreſſe, and ſhe not diſpoſde
                        (As other Ladies are) to entertaine
                        Peculiar termes, with common acts of kindneſſe:
                        But (knowing in her, more then womens iudgement,
                        That ſhe ſhould nothing wrong her huſbands right,
                        To vſe a friend onely for vertue, choſen
                        With all the right; of friendſhip) tooke ſuch care
                        After the ſolemne parting to your trauaile,
                        And ſpake of you with ſuch exceeding paſsion,
                        That I grew iealous, and with rage excepted
                        Againſt her kindneſſe, vtterly forgetting
                        
                           I ſhould haue waied ſo rare a womans words,
                        As duties of a free and friendly iuſtice:
                        Not as the head-ſtrong and incontinent vapors
                        Of other Ladies bloods, enflamed with luſt,
                        Wherein I iniured both your innocencies,
                        Which I approue, not out of flexible dotage,
                        
                           By any cunning flatteries of my wife,
                        But in impartiall equitie, made apparant
                        Both by mine owne well-waid compariſon
                        Of all her other manifeſt perfections,
                        With this one onely doubtfull leuitie,
                        And likewiſe by her violent apprehenſion
                        Of her deepe wrong and yours, for ſhe hath vowde,
                        Neuer to let the common Pandreſſe light,
                        (Or any doome as vulgar) cenſure her
                        In any action ſhe leaues ſubiect to them,
                        Neuer to fit the day with her attire,
                        Nor grace it with her preſence; Nouriſh in it,
                        (Vnleſſe with ſleepe) nor ſtir out of her chamber:
                        And ſo hath muffled and mewd vp her beauties
                        In neuer-ceaſing darkeneſſe, Neuer ſleeping,
                        But in the day tranſform'd by her to night:
                        With all Sunne baniſht from her ſmootherd graces:
                        And thus my deare and moſt vnmatched wife,
                        That was a comfort and a grace to me,
                        In euery iudgement, euery companie,
                        I, by falſe Iealouſie, haue no leſſe then loſt,
                        Murtherd her liuing, and emtoomd her quicke.
                     
                  
                  
                     Vand.
                     
                        Conceit it not ſo deepely, good my Lord,
                        Your wrong to me or her, was no fit ground
                        To beare ſo waightie and reſolu'd a vowe,
                        From her incenſed and abuſed vertues.
                     
                  
                  
                     Uau.
                     
                        There could not be a more important cauſe,
                        To fill her with a ceaſleſſe hate of light,
                        To ſee it grace groſe lightneſſe with full beames,
                        And frowne on continence with her oblique glances.
                        As nothing equalls, right to vertue done,
                        So is her wrong paſt all compariſon.
                     
                  
                  
                     Vand.
                     
                        Vertue is not malitious, wrong done her
                        Is righted euer when men grant they Erre,
                        But doth my princely miſtreſſe ſo contemne
                        The glorie of her beauties, and the applauſe
                        
                           Giuen to the worth of her ſocietie,
                        To let a voluntarie vowe obſcure them;
                     
                  
                  
                     Uau.
                     
                        See all her windowes, and her doores made faſt,
                        And in her Chamber lights for night enflam'd,
                        Now others riſe, ſhe takes her to her bed.
                     
                  
                  
                     Uand.

                        With better tyding; of my other friendes,

                        Of my deare ſiſter, in whoſe ſelfe and me,
                        Surviues the whole hope of our familie,

                        Chanc't your three yeares moſt lamented abſence,

                     Fayth Madam, my companie may well be ſpard at ſo mournefull a viſitation: For, by my ſoule, to ſee Pigmalion dote vpon a Marble Picture, a ſenceles Statue, I ſhould laugh and ſpoyle the Tragedie.

                     But this is nothing rare; Tis a vertue common for men to loue their Wiues after death: The value of a good Wife (as all good things elſe) are better knowne by their want, then by their fruition: for no man loues his Wife ſo well while ſhe lines, but he loues her ten times better when ſhee's dead.

                     Faith, my Lord, I ſpeake my thoughts; and for mine owne part, I ſhould ſo ill indure the loſſe of a Wife (alwayes prouided, I lou'd her) that if I loſt her this weeke, I'de haue another by the beginning a'th next: And thus reſolu'd, I leaue your Highnes to deale with Atropos, for cutting my Ladyes threed: I am for France; all my care is for Followers to Imp out my Traine: I feare I muſt come to your Grace for a Preſſe; for I will be followd as becomes an honorable Lord: and that is, like an honeſt Squire: for with our great Lords, followers abrod, and Hoſpitalitie at home, are out of date: The world's now growne thriftie: He that fils a whole Page in folio, with his Stile; thinkes it verieſt Noble, to be mand with one bare Page and a Pandare; and yet Pandare in auntient time, was the name of an honeſt Courtier▪ what tis now, Viderit vtilitas: Come Witts, let's to my Chamber.

                     I finde no alteration in my ſelfe in the world, for I am ſure I am no wiſer then I was, when I was no Lord, nor no more bountifull, nor no more honeſt; onely in reſpect of my ſtate, I aſſume a kinde of State; to receiue Suters now, with the Nodd of Nobilitie; not (as before) with the Cappe of courteſie; the knee of Knighthood: And why knee of Knighthood, little Witte? there's another Queſtion for your Court Accidence.

                     You cut mee off by the knees, little Witte: but I ſay, (if you will heare mee) that if they deſerue to be Knighted, that purchaſe their Knighthood with fighting vp to the knee, What doe they deſerue, that purchaſe their Knighthood with fighting aboue the knee?

                     What can he not ſay, who being drunke with luſt, and ſurfetting with deſire of change, regards not what he ſayes: and briefly I will tell you thus much now; Let my melancholy Lady (ſayes he) hold on this courſe till ſhe waſte her ſelfe, and conſume my reuenew in Tapers, yet this is certaine, that as long as ſhe has that ſiſter of hers at her elbow.

                     But to ſay, ye had a dull eye, a ſharpe noſe (the viſible markes of a ſhrow) a drie hand, which is a ſigne of a bad liuer, as he ſaid you were▪ being toward a husband too: this was intolerable.

                     That's enough: let my ſiſter go waſte his reuenew in tapers, twill be her owne another day.

And your grace haue any employment for followers, pray entertaine my companie: theyle ſpend their bloud in your ſeruice, for they haue little elſe to ſpend, you may ſoone raiſe their fortunes.
