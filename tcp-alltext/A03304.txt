            To the honeſt and wel-diſpoſed Reader.
            
               IT is the vſual maner of the most which publiſh bookes, to dedicate the ſame to ſome honorable perſonage, or to ſome one of ſpeciall place, partly to ſhew thankefulneſſe for ſome receiued fauors, partly to procure credite and countenance to their writings, that vnder ſo good protection, they may the more boldly paſſe forth to the common view of all men. If I now varie from this generall receiued courſe, think not I pray thee (good Reader) that I do it in ſome humour, as if I either affected ſingularitie, or miſliked the common cuſtome: but know for a truth that there are theſe two cauſes of my ſo doing: The firſt is, the obſcuritie of mine owne condition, who liuing here in a remote part, haue wanted either wil, or oportunitie, or both, to ſ
                  •
               rowd my ſelfe vnder the patronage of ſome great perſon: The ſecond is, the nature of this preſent Treatiſe:

for howſoeuer there be (and that not farre frō the place of mine abode) ſome of good qualitie, vpon whoſe acceptance, I thinke, I might haue preſumed, yet conſidering, that this which I haue framed, is but a homely and courſe diſcourſe, meant onely for men of the plaineſt faſhion, I thought I ſhould breake the rules of comelineſſe and correſpondence, if I ſhould aduance the inſcription of my labour (if I may dare ſo to call it) to a perſon of higher degree, then that meane and middle ranke, to the vſe whereof, all that theſe following leaues containe, was alone intended. Therefore (friendly Reader) whoſoeuer thou be, if thou be a true Nathanael,Iohn. 1.17. Luke. 8.15. a man of an honeſt and good heart, be thy outward condition as it may be, though thou lye among the pots,
               Pſal. 68.13. or art behind the ewes with young, or howſoeuer elſe,Pſal. 78.71. Pſal. 107.10. euen as it were bound in outward miſerie, and of baſe eſteeme in the eyes of men, yet thou art he whoſe patronage I affect, and in the hope of whoſe good allowance I take comfort. I know well that he which offereth any thing to the ſight of the world, muſt make readie his backe for the long furrowes of euerie byting cēſurer.Pſal. 129.3.

                   apud Athen. It was truly ſaid of him (though but a heathen) that amongst men nothing can ſcape without a nippe. But what then? If thy

conſcience ſhall giue this teſtimonie of mine endeuours, that thy heart is comforted thereby, in regard that thy iudgement is ſtrengthened in ſo neceſſary a point, then let the most profeſſed and ſharpe-toothed carper ſay what he pleaſe:Iob 31.35, 36. nay though (as Iob ſpeaketh) he ſhould write a booke againſt me, yet I would take it vpon my ſhoulder, and bind it as a crowne vnto me.

And as Dauid reckened not of Michols taunts in regard of the honour done vnto him by thoſe religious maidens; ſo will I alſo ſet at naught the malicious taxings of all gaine-ſayers,2. Cor. 4.2. if I ſhall approue my ſelfe to thy conſcience in the ſight of God.
            
            If thou now demaund of me,The ſumme of the Treatiſe. what it is which I do here offer vnto thee, know this briefly: It is a Treatiſe tending to the diſcouerie of the worth and excellencie of the word preached; teaching thee alſo, which art a continuall hearer, how thou maist by hearing edifie thy ſelfe in thy moſt holy faith;
               Iude 20. as well by eſtabliſhing thy heart in the ſoundneſſe of truth,Heb. 13.9. that ſo thou maiſt not be caried about with diuers and ſtrange doctrines;
               Rom 6.17. as by framing thy ſelfe to obey from the hart vnto the forme of doctrine, whereunto thou either art or ſhalt be deliuered. This is the ſumme.
            
               
               The cauſes of writing it.If thou demaund againe, what hath moued me to attempt this? I anſwer in as few words. There are two questions common in the mouthes of many, either ignorant, or il-diſpoſed perſons, by which the beautie of Preaching is and hath bene much defaced in the eyes of many not ſo well ſetled: the one is, What need all this preaching? the other is, Who knoweth whom to beleeue among theſe Preachers? Theſe two demaunds were firſt hatched in hell, but ſince being cheriſhed by Anabaptisticall and Popiſh ſpirits,2. Pet. 3.16. and by them buzzed into the heads of vnlearned, vnſtable, and irreligious people, they are brought vnto a diuelliſh perfection. Somewhat I can ſay out of mine owne experience, that through a conceit that theſe two queſtions (as they are preſſed by ſome 
                  •
               ly workemen) are vnanſwerable, our Miniſtery is drawne into contempt, and the calling of a Preacher is deemed of al other profeſſions the moſt ſuperfluous, and ſuch as may wel be ſpared without any preiudice to the wel-being of Gods Church. The giuing anſwer to theſe helliſh interrogatories, as it hath many times exerciſed me in the execution of my publike miniſtery, ſo it hath at this time drawne me to the compiling of this preſent Treatiſe: both that thoſe of theſe parts, who to

my knowledge haue need, and do deſire it alſo, may haue ſomething by them, whereupon aduiſedly to deliberate for the ſetling of their iudgments, and that others likewiſe elſewhere, who (it may be) haue experience of the like Satanicall encounters, may (in ſtead of a better help) enioy the benefite of this that I haue laboured in. This is the maine occaſion, this is my chiefe intent in this Tractate: wherin, as I haue freely vttered that which I am perſwaded is the truth, ſo will I be ready alſo either to alter or better my iudgement,

And though perhaps many know in this matter as much as I or any man can tell them, yet I am ſure many are ignorant, and therefore I may well maintaine my courſe with that ſaying of Auguſtine,

               It is better to giue him that hath, then to turne him away which hath not. It is meeter that they which know ſhould be wearied with many repetitions, then thoſe which are vnskilful ſent away empire for want of inſtruction. As for writers in our times, directly of this ſubiect I know none. If there be none, I wiſh there may be; for as the ſaying is,

               One man is no man:

The auncient prouerb is, that One bark cannot beare all paſſengers;

                many bookes ſhould be made by ſundry men in a differing ſtile, though not with a differing faith. All ſtomackes we ſee are not alike; One kind of dreſſing pleaſeth one, which hath no reliſh with another: and yet the ſame meate ordered after ſome other faſhion, may fit his appetite alſo. As there is a difference of ſtomacks, ſo of humors and diſpoſitions in men. The ſame matter diuerſly handled, may find entertainement with diuers men; which yet digested after one onely faſhion, would haue acceptance but with a few.

theſe I may well complaine. Houſhold affaires, and the ſtirres occaſioned by thoſe buſineſſes, cannot but breed diſtraction: and he which is exerciſed with the care of a congregation, ſhall meet with very ſeldome intermiſſion. I intreat thee therefore, when thou ſhalt find me to faile in any thing (from which I account not my ſelfe priuiledged) impute it to this forenamed want; and hope thus of me, that if I had had more freedome and more time, all things ſhould haue bene brought to better perfection.
            I haue troden in an old beaten path, both by old and new writers, by Diuines and Heathen, namely, to frame my matter to the forme of a Dialogue, a very good way (in my ſeeming) to help the vnderſtanding of common men: I confeſſe it to haue haue eaſed me much in writing, I doubt not but it ſhall turne to thy benefite in reading alſo.

Peter termeth them, and that not vnfitly: for as a well placed by the way ſide, in regard of the outward ſéeming thereof, putteth the poore thirſty traueller in hope of ſome refreſhing; who repairing to it, and finding nothing but emptineſſe, goeth on his way with the greater diſcouragement: ſo theſe kind of men ſtanding in the Church of God, do by reaſon of their outward habite & ſemblance of grauitie, make the wearied, diſtreſſed & perplexed Chriſtian conceiue, that if he haue recourſe to them he ſhall certainely be reléeued: but yet when he maketh triall, he findeth them to his greater griefe, not vnlike to the images of the Heathen, VVhich haue mouthes and ſpeake not;

And I do heartily wiſh, that both you and others of our neighbors would more often giue me the like occaſion, I ſhould then the better know your doubts,The profit of conference betwixt the Miniſter and his people. and ſo fit my ſelfe to ſpeake in preaching to euery mans conſcience, and you alſo ſhould by that means be reſolued in many things,

which for lacke of conference muſt néeds breed ſcruple,Heb 5.14 eſpecially in thoſe which haue not yet through long cuſtome exerciſed wits to diſcerne both good and euill.

               That may be but a pretence, & yet it will not altogether excuſe either others or my ſelfe herein: happily we be not ſo tender ouer the wants of our people as we ought to be. Howſoeuer to preuent any ſuch feare in you for this time, I pray you be bold to ſpeake your mind freely, and you ſhall find me far from ſeeming weary of you, or from giuing you any occaſion to thinke that I am vnwilling to ſeeke to reſolue you (as I may) in any thing that may trouble you. And I pray God, the God of all grace, euen for Chriſts ſake, ſo to bleſſe this our conference, by giuing to vs both a right iudgment in al things, that it may be both to his glorie, and to our further comfort.

                  The occaſion of the whole Dialogue. 
                  it hath happened that I haue fallen into the companie, ſometime of common men, ſometime of men of better faſhion, which in the world we call wiſe men; ſometime alſo of men of learning, and by profeſſion Miniſters; ſome of whom to my griefe I haue heard ſpeake very diſgracefully, ſome very ſcornefully, all of them to the leſſening of that reuerent eſtimation which we ought to haue of the preaching of the word, and of the ordinary courſe thereof which is amongſt vs.

Thus we haue euen a cloud of witneſſes to confirme this, that it hath euer bin the diuels courſe by all meanes to withſtand the preaching of the truth.

                  The cauſes of the diſlike of preachingThe true cauſes why the courſe of preaching, when it is performed ſo as it ought,The firſt cauſe is ſo much repined at, are theſe three eſpecially. The firſt is this. As men loue nothing more then their ſinnes, ſo they loath nothing more then the diſcouery thereof: they can by no meanes endure to haue their ſecret coruptions ript vp: it is a death vnto them to be thoroughly & directly dealt withal. Wicked Ahab hated the ſincere Prophet of the Lord Michaiah,
                  1 King. 22.8. becauſe he neuer propheſied good vnto him, but euill; that is, he neuer ſpared him, but deliuered the truth of God vnto him plainly without flattery. Now the preaching of the word, it is as the prouerb is, The finger in the bile;Vng

                  Eph. 5 13. 
                  it maketh all things manifeſt, and diſcloſeth euery mans cloſe and ſecret vngodlines. In the dayes of blindneſſe (that is, in times and places where there is not a ſetled courſe of preaching) many a man ſeemeth to himſelfe and to others alſo to be vnreproueable, who when the light of the word by powerful application breaketh out, is diſcouered both to others, & eſpecially to his owne

conſcience, to be nothing elſe then that which he was ſuppoſed to be. Here is thē one cauſe of diſlike: the word thus handled, openeth that which men of all other things deſire moſt to be concealed: ſo that it is true of the word of Chriſt, which he witneſſeth of himſelfe,Iohn 7.7. 
                  The world hateth me, becauſe I teſtifie thereof that the workes of it are euill. Tell me now I pray you, what thinke you of this?
            
            
               Nymp.
               
                  Truly I cannot but beare witneſſe to the truth hereof out of mine owne experience. For howſoeuer, I haue now learned, I thanke God, to ſay with Dauid; Let the righteous ſmite me,
                  
                  Pſal. 141.5. 
                  for that is a benefite; let him reproue me, and it ſhall be a precious oile that ſhall not breake my head: yet I well remember, when I firſt heard preaching, I was many times diſcontented: me thought the Preacher was too peremptory, and a great deale more plaine then needed; yea I had much ado at times, not to perſwade my ſelfe that I was chiefly aimed at in ſome things, and that the Preacher had receiued ſome ſecret informations touching me and my demeanour, which he there opened in the pulpit. So hard a

thing is it for fleſh and bloud to beare the words of reproofe, yea though in the witneſſe of a mans owne conſcience he hath euery way deſerued the ſame. But I hartily beſeech God on the behalfe of you and others of your ſort, that he would enlarge your ſpirits,
                  
                  Eph 8 19.

               You haue ſaid the very truth. We can be content to heare the word vntill it rifle vs. But as a purging potiō, as long as it is in drinking, is but as

other drink vntil it worke, and then we could be content to caſt it vp againe: ſo we can quietly heare the word vntill it work vpon vs, but then it ſeemeth a burden vnto vs.The ſecond cauſe of the diſlike of ſincere preaching But to come to the opening of the ſecond reaſon of the diſlike of preaching: I haue by obſeruation found it to be this, becauſe preaching is (as they ſuppoſe) an enemy vnto libertie, a thing which by nature euery man deſireth to enioy. In the ſecond Pſalme we reade what is the opinion that men haue of Chriſtian obedience,Pſal. 2.3. they call it bands & cords, that is to ſay, meere ſeruilitie and ſlauery, a baſe and ignominious thing to be conformable. This is the very right conceipt which worldlings haue of yeelding them ſelues vnto the doctrine of Chriſt Ieſus. When Lot admoniſhed the Sodomites,Gen. 19 9. & begā to perſwade with thē to deſiſt from violence againſt the ſtrangers that were with him in his houſe; they cried ſtraite, Shall he iudge and rule? Forthwith they began to repine againſt his godly aduiſe, as againſt a matter of too much tyrannie in Lot, and of too great ſubiection in themſelues. It was the imputation of Korah and his adherents to

                  Moſes and Aaron,
                  Num. 16.3. 
                  You take too much vpon you: they déemed the gouernement of Moſes too peremptery, as an enemy to their liberty, & therefore not to be endured. When the Prophet Amos preached, it was ſaid,Amo
                        •
                      7.10. that the land was not able to beare his words: as who ſhould ſay, his ſermons were too cenſorious: men that were of a liberall and free diſpoſition were not able to digeſt them. One reaſon which the Iewes had againſt Chriſt to ſtir vp themſelues to find a meanes to ſuppreſſe him, was, becauſe they ſuppoſed that if they let him alone,Iohn 11.48. 
                  the Romanes would come and take away both their place and nation. They thought bondage wold follow vpon his doctrine. This might eaſily be enlarged with the additiō of many examples: but our owne experience may be a ſufficient confirmation. For euen at this day the world maintaineth the ſame opinion of obedience and conformitie in Chriſtian duties, that it is an abridgement to liberty, that it ſauoreth of ſlauiſhnes & baſeneſſe for a man at the words of a Preacher to be reſtrained.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  Truly ſir it is euen ſo: for out

of my poore experience I am able to witneſſe thus much, that many men imagine that for them to liue without controlment, following the ſway of their owne affections, if they may ſweare and blaſpheme, and be vicious and riotous, and drink with the drunkard, and profane the Sabbaoth, and ſcoffe at zeale and ſinceritie in religiō, and runne into all manner of exceſſe, this is libertie. On the other ſide, they repute the reſtraint from any of theſe things to be the greateſt thraldome; a miſery it is to be kept within compaſſe, that a man may not ſweare, may not ſpend the Lords day in ſports, or in worldly buſineſſes, or in trauelling vpon his owne occaſions, that he muſt ſet ſuch a narrow watch before his mouth, as that there ſhould be no filthines nor fooliſh talking, nor ieſting: that he ſhould be tied to the continuall hearing of the word, to often receiuing the ſacrament, and the like, this is a miſery of all miſeries, a thing not to be endured: they crie when you tel thē theſe things, This is a hurd ſaying, who can abide it? and determine as thoſe of whom you ſpake, Let vs breake their bands, and caſt their cords from vs. But reſolue me herin I pray you ſir, is this liberty?

Are not men herein altogether miſtaken?
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               Yes verily: for howſoeuer men think themſelues iolly fellowes, becauſe they can ſeeme to contemne all gouernement, yet in indeed of all conditions it is the baſeſt, and of al thraldomes the moſt ſlauiſh for a man to be ſubiect vnto ſin, to be giuen ouer to his owne luſts, to be led wholly by the corrupt affections of his owne hart, and to ſay the truth, euen in reaſon it muſt needs be ſo: for, as to be a ſlaue and a vaſſall is in it ſelfe very opprobrious, and ſuch a thing as euen the nature of man doth abhorre: ſo the more vile he is to whom a man is in bondage, the more baſe and odious is it in the eyes of others, and the more tedious to himſelf if he be of any ingenious diſpoſition. Now what more vile thing can there be imagined then ſinne is? What more abhominable before God, what more dangerous to the ſoule of him that committeth it? ſo that ſin being a thing ſo vile, in how ſeruile an eſtate is he that is a ſlaue and a vaſſal therunto? Do you conceiue me in this?
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  I conceiue you well. But yet this breedes a further doubt: we may all

complaine with the Apoſtle, that we are euen captiue vnto the law of ſinne:
                  
                  Rom 7 23. 
                  who then is he that may be called a ſlaue of ſinne?
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               Our Sauiour ſhall make you anſwer: He that committeth ſinne,
                  Iohn 8.34. 
                  is the ſeruant of ſinne: to which, to make it more plaine,Rom. 6.16. you may adde the ſaying of the Apoſtle, Know ye not that to whom ſoeuer you giue your ſelues as ſeruants to obey, his ſeruants you are to whom you obey? The latter place is an expoſitiō to ye other. He (ſaith Chriſt) that cōmitteth ſinne, is the ſeruant of ſinne: he committeth ſinne (ſayth Paul) that obeyeth ſin: now he is ſaid to obey ſinne, that finding his corrupt heart to prouoke him to any thing, ſets himſelf preſently to performe the ſame, or as the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh, taketh thought for the fleſh to fulfill the luſtes thereof.
                  Rom. 13 14 So the adulterer is a ſlaue to his ſinne, becauſe he is wholly at the commaund thereof, ſtudying how to compaſſe the ſame, and to ſatiſfie his vncleane deſires to the vttermoſt. The drunkard is a vaſſall to his ſinne, becauſe it is as it were his buſineſſe, to ſet himſelfe to the committing of it, to get money to beſtow vpon it, to gather company

that he may haue fellowes in it, to riſe early to follow it, to make his body able to beare it. The couetous perſon is a drudge to his money: for, for it he will do any thing, he will defeate one, and defraud another, and oppreſſe a third, and grind the fourth, and take vſury of the fift, and rake and wring, and extort, and lie and forſweare, and whatſoeuer elſe for his money. He is ſuch a ſeruant to it, as the Centurions ſeruants were to him: If money ſay to him, Go, he trudgeth by and by: if it ſay Come, it hath him at a becke: if it bid him do this, be it neuer ſo vile, vniuſt or vnlawful, eftſoons he doth it. In like maner the cōtinual gameſter, is as it were in the ſtate of villenage to his humor, he will neglect all other occaſions, either of reſt for his body, or of profite for his outward eſtate, or of religion for his ſoules good, to fulfill it: for his life (if company be for him) he is not able to forbeare it. In like ſort, the ignorant man is in bondage to his blindnes; for bring all the perſwaſions you can againſt it out of the word of God, yet ignorance ſhall ſtill haue the vpper hand, either he will not conceiue you, or he wil

not beleeue you, or he wil not be directed by you. So againe, the ſuperſtitious is in thraldome to his owne peeuiſhneſſe; for let God commaund what he will, or preſcribe what form of worſhip he thinketh good, yet thus and thus it hath bene ſo long, and ſo it ſhal be, and ſo wil I do for euer. In a word, whoſoeuer ſuffereth himſelfe to be led by the corruption of his owne heart in any thing, without making reſiſtance, without deſiring the aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit to withſtand it, whether it be pride, malice, reuenge, or whatſoeuer elſe, the ſame is a ſlaue to his ſinne, a drudge to his owne humor, and the baſeſt creature vnder heauen. Nay he is more ſlauiſh by degrees, then thoſe ſlaues whō they vſed in old times (and as they do ſtill in ſome countries) to buy with money, and to vſe at their pleaſure. For there is no ſuch ſlaue, but he keepeth a free mind in a ſeruile eſtate: but men generally being in this moſt filthy and wretched thraldome, thinke thēſelues to be in the moſt happy eſtate that may be, and haue no will nor diſpoſition to be freed, but are enemies to the meanes of their deliuery. Thus haue I

ſhewed you, that though men thinke themſelues at libertie when they may liue licenciouſly, yet they are much deceiued: it may be ſaid of them as Noah ſaid of Canaan:Gen. 9.2
                        •
                     . ſeruants of ſeruants they be, doing the buſineſſe of the diuell, not grudgingly or vnwillingly as bondſlaues vſually do, but readily, greedily, and ioyfully.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  I am (I thanke you) well ſatisfied for this: yet by the way giue me leaue to demaund of you one thing, doeth not Paul ſay to Chriſtians, Brethren ye haue bene called into libertie:
                  
                  Gal. 5.13. 
                  ſo that it ſeemeth there is libertie euē in Chriſtianitie, which what it is (if any ſuch be) I pray you to inſtruct me.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               Certainly the ſtate and calling of a true Chriſtian, is a louely calling, a calling that calleth men vnto it, ſuch a calling as that the beames thereof are able to rauiſh the eye. True it is, that euer ſince Adam did eate the apple, all the mouthes of his poſterity are ſo out of taſt, that we can neither heare nor ſee, nor taſt any thing that good is, ſo that if we looke vpon the eſtate of a Chriſtian liuing in obedience, with an eye of fleſh,

it looketh euē like Chriſt for al the world, euen as a withered branch,
                  Iſa. 5

                  and like a root in the drie ground; when we ſee it, there is no forme that we ſhould deſire it. The eye of a natural man can ſée no good in it, vnleſſe it be good to cleane vnto the Lord, or it is good to be afflicted, or it is good to run the way of Gods commandements, and ſuch like, which are like pilles, and to die for it, will not downe with a carnall man, yet if it be duly conſidered, it is the onely eſtate of libertie. It is not a fleſhly libertie, a libertie for men to do and ſpeake, and liue as they themſelues pleaſe, euery man after his owne faſhiō, as though the reines ſhould be layed on euery mans neck, and he left to his owne diſpoſition. It is no ſuch liberty, for then the more Libertine the better Chriſtian, and then all the world would ſoone be religious, for all the world are welneare Libertines. But this liberty which Chriſtians haue, is a ſpirituall libertie, a heauenly liberty, a liberty of the ſoule; not which giueth the body liberty from obedience, but which ſetteth the ſoule at liberty from deſtruction: not which maketh vs free to ſin, but which ſetteth vs

frée to ſerue God: not which giueth a man leaue to liue as caring for none, but which maketh him by loue a ſeruant vnto all: a fréedome it is from the bondage of Satan, from the thraldom of ſin, frō the heauy curſe of Gods law, giuing an intereſt into Gods fauor, into the merits of Chriſt, into the felicity of the choſen, into the eternal inheritance of Gods kingdome. This is the liberty of Chriſtians; of which, howſoeuer worldly men which ſauor onely of earthly things may iudge, yet ſuch it is and ſo great, & hath ſo many priuiledges annexed thereunto, as that all the enfranchiſements and fréedomes of this world are not worthy therewith to be compared. For as the new Ieruſalem, which is from aboue, is of all other cities and incorporations the moſt glorious, ſo it is ye greateſt priuiledge that any man can attaine, to be, of a ſtranger and a forreiner, admitted to be a citizen and free denizen of that ſocietie. Thus at your requeſt I haue giuen you a taſte of the doctrine of Chriſtian Libertie: the obedient Chriſtian is the true free-man, euen the Lords free-man.

Iames ſpeaketh, that ſhould bee bidden to ſtand there aloofe off, or ſit here at my footſtoole; eftſoone he beginneth to thinke with himſelfe, that it would be a ſhame for him to ſuffer the words of ſuch a one ſo far below him in the world, to cary ſo great authority with him, as that he ſhould by and by conforme himſelfe to his perſwaſions. Another perhaps that hath had ſome good education, and thereby hath gotten ſome taſt of learning, or is otherwiſe by obſeruation & experience growne to be a man of ſome reach and capacitie: he when he compareth himſelf with ye teacher, ſeemeth to ſée as much (if not more) learning, iudgement, reading and vnderſtanding in himſelfe as in him: and therfore he ſayth with himſelf, Why ſhould I yeeld to his inſtruction? why ſhould his opinion ſway ſo far with me, as to draw me from mine owne courſes? why ſhould not I be as wel able to iudge what is méete as he? A third, that is (it may be) ſome gallant, a man of ſpirit, that thinketh it a part of his courage to be without feare euen of God himſelfe, he hearing at a ſermon

threatnings denounced againſt ſin, and againſt thoſe very ſins wherof his life is a continuall practiſe, in the greatneſſe of his ſtomacke, and in the prophaneſſe of his heart beginneth to ſet all at nought, imagining that it cānot ſtand with that hardineſſe and vndaunted reſolution which he profeſſeth, to be ſtrikē with the words of a ſilly man, or to haue his heart terrified with a few idle ſpéeches. In a word, the people generally do not conſider how well a thing is ſpoken, how ſufficiently proued, how ſoundly ſeconded and made good by the word, this neuer entereth into their thought: but they ſee that he which preacheth, what is he but a man of their owne ſort, one neither armed with authority to puniſh them, nor endued with power to conſtraine them, neither yet furniſhed with wealth to contend with them: and that al his force lyeth in his tongue, the exerciſe whereof when it is once paſt, there is all that he can do, and therefore they make a Tuſh at his doctrine, and ſay of the Preacher as they did of old, He is but wind,
                  Ierem. 5.13. and what is he that he ſhould command vs? Thus, this alſo is one cauſe of reſiſtance

to the holy doctrine taught, men looke no higher then the man, and they value all that is ſayd by the quality of the ſpeaker.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  This diſcourſe of yours, ſo fully diſcouering the proud conceits of an vnreformed heart, calleth to my mind the commendation which Paul giueth of the Theſſalonians When ye receiued of vs (ſaith he) the word of the preaching of God,
                  
                  1. Theſſ 2.13. 
                  ye receiued it not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the word of God: for ſo long as men haue no higher a conceipt of that which they heare, then that it is but a mans doctrine, the reſpect vnto it cannot chooſe but be very ſmall; ſo that I muſt needs yeeld vnto you in this, that this alſo may well go among the number of the cauſes why preaching is of ſo ſlender eſtimation here amongſt vs. Yet ſir, men that are enemies in this caſe, do pretend other reaſons, and will not be knowne of any of theſe to be the occaſion or cauſe of their diſlike.
                  
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               That is moſt true, for ſinne doeth euer ſeeke ſhades, and it is a tricke which we haue learned of our grandfather Adam,
                  Gen. 3.7. to ſew figge-leaues together to couer our nakedneſſe. For ſhame men

will not ſay that they are hereby moued to diſlike: yet notwithſtanding theſe be the true grounds, and men in their conſciences know it to be ſo. If a man had aſked of Paſhur why he ſmote Ieremie the Prophet, and put him in the ſtockes,Ierem. 20.2. no doubt but he would tell you a very formall tale, as that,chap. 26.11. 
                  He propheſied againſt the citie: he hath not ſought the wealth of the people, but the hurt:
                  chap. 38.4 
                  and that he diſcouraged the hands of the men of warre, in ſpeaking ſuch wordes vnto them. This would be Paſhurs pretence, thus he wold pleade for his ſtraite courſes againſt the poore Prophet, yet this is but a colour: for the very matter is, Ieremie was a little too bold, he ſpake too plaine, his ſermons were like a fire,Ierem. 23.29. 
                  and like a hammer that breaketh the ſtone, he kept not a word backe of al that the Lord commanded him.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  Indeede I haue heard much ſpoken by many, and diuers exceptions made againſt preaching, but I neuer heard any man acknowledge his diſlike to proceede from any of theſe cauſes which you haue named: I wiſh therefore that you would inſtruct me how to ſtop the mouths

of gaine-ſayers, when I light into the companie of ſuch. They will not perhaps ſay much to your faces that are Preachers, but ſuch as I am ſhall often heare them talke at libertie, and vtter the very bottom of their ſtomackes, and ſpend all their powder and ſhot to the beating downe of that which I hope they ſhall neuer be able to ouerthrow.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               Aſſure your ſelfe of that: for we may be bold to ſay in the comfort of a good conſcience,2 King 6.16. 
                  They that be with vs, are moe then they that be with them. And when we come on the ſame errand with Ieremie, why may we not hope vpon the ſame promiſe,Ierem. 1.19. 
                  They ſhal fight againſt thee but they ſhall not preuaile againſt thee, for I am with thee to deliuer thee, ſaith the Lord: yet notwithſtanding, leſt their conceipts ſhould be any hindrance to thoſe that are well affected, or it ſhould be an encouragement to them in their euill, when they find thoſe that ſéeme contrary minded, vnable to anſwer them, therfore I do both commend your care herein, and will be as helpefull to you as I am able in opening the vanitie of their ſeuerall exceptions, that are enemies vnto preaching.

                  I thanke you for it: and I truſt that he which commanded Peter when he was himſelfe conuerted,
                  Luke 22 32. 
                  to ſtrengthen the brethren, will both bleſſe your care to my profite, and render to you ſeuen fold into your boſome, the comfort that I ſhall receiue by your aduice. I will be bold therefore, as farre as I can call to mind, to make knowne vnto you euery thing that I haue heard obiected in this caſe.

               Be ſo, I pray you, and faile not till you be fully ſatiſfied, to vrge euery thing to the vttermoſt.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  You know ſir that we haue in our countrie, men of diuers humours,
                  The ſeueral excepters againſt preaching. 
                  and ſundrie faſhions; ſome groſſely ignorant, and meere ſottiſh, chiefly in matters of religion; ſome prophane, ſuch as Eſau was, who care more for a portion of meate, eſteeme more of a worldly cōmoditie, then of a heauenly treaſure; ſome wiſe and ſenſible, as the world calleth wiſedome; ſome learned alſo, and ſchollers by profeſſion: now it hath bene my hap at ſome one time or other, to fall into conference with euery of theſe ſorts, and as communication draweth in one thing after another, ſo to find out their ſeueral opinions: and though

ſome of them be very ſimple, and to be called idle ſurmiſes, rather then grounded reaſons, yet becauſe you haue made me ſo kind an offer, you ſhall therefore haue all.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               Be it ſo, I am well contented: and becauſe Ignorance is a mother ſin, therefore let vs firſt heare I pray you the ignorant mans exceptions.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  The ignorant peoples exceptions againſt preaching.
                  One thing that I haue heard ſome ignorant men with vs alleage, is, that they can ſee no reaſon why there ſhould be more vſe of preaching now, then there hath bene in former times. They haue liued (they ſay) ſome thirtie, ſome fortie, ſome more yeares without a ſetled miniſtery, hauing onely (vnleſſe it were now or then at times) the ordinary ſeruice read among them; and all this while they felt no want of that which is now called teaching, and therefore they are minded not to eſteeme that much for the remainder of their life, without which they haue liued and done wel enough hitherto. How like you this ſir? is not this a profound reaſon? Is not here good Diuinitie?
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               Indéede you may well call this the ignorant mans reaſon, it is ſo groſſe, hauing in it but thrée errours,

which you know is nothing to ſpeake of in ſo ſhort an allegation. Firſt of all, they wil neglect preaching now, becauſe they haue liued without it hitherto: as though it were wiſedome for a man in his old or middle age, to refuſe a kindneſſe offered, becauſe in his youth or childhood he had no meanes to enioy it. Had it bene a good reaſon for Paul, when Chriſt called him from heauen, to haue ſaid, O ſir it is now too late, I am a man that haue ſpent the beſt part of my time without the knowledge of thee & of thy religion, & therefore I pray thée trouble me not now, I hope to ſhift out as wel for ſo much of my life as is behind, as I haue done ſo this day? No man will be ſo without cōmon ſenſe, as to ſay, that Paul might iuſtly haue refuſed vpon ſuch a pretence: and yet it had bin as good a reaſon as theirs. Secondly they erre in this, in that they account the time of their ignorance to haue bin without danger, becauſe they neuer ſaw the danger. Alas, litle do they conſider the extreme miſery of thoſe times.Iohn 12 3. Chriſt ſaith that he that walketh in the darke, namely without ye bright ſhining light of Gods holy word knowes not whither he goeth:
                  
he is euen in the valley of the ſhadow of death,Epheſ. 4.1
                        •
                     . 
                  a ſtranger from the life of God, walking after the courſe of this world, and after the prince that ruleth in the ayre,
                  Epheſ. 2.2. 
                  euen the ſpirit that worketh in the children of diſobedience. A man that hath bene in a ſwound, and is awaked out of it by the paines of his friends, he will tel you how pleaſing the ſlumber therof ſéemed to his ſenſes, and at the firſt beginning to be awaked, he will ſay perhaps, You ſhould haue let me alone, why did you trouble me? But when he is better aduiſed, he wil thank them that brought him again, becauſe he knoweth that if he had bene let alone, it might haue coſt him his life. So in this caſe, a man liuing in blindneſſe and groſſe ignorance, ſéemeth to himſelfe for the preſent to be in a maruellous good ſtate, and his ſoule in as good as any mans; and when the Preacher ſhall cry vnto him,Epheſ. 5 14. 
                  Awake thou that ſleepeſt,
                  Ezech. 18.31. 
                  and ſtand vp from the dead: Oh thou ignorant perſon, Why wilt thou die ſaue thy ſelf from this froward generation. Like enough he wil ſay,Act 2 40. O M. Preacher, trouble me not I pray you, ſpare your ſides, I am well enough, my ſoule is in

no ſuch danger: but if the Lord once open his eyes,Ezech. 18.3
                        •
                     . and make him a new heart and a new ſpirit, then he wil bleſſe God for him that called him, becauſe he will then perceiue, that otherwiſe he had euen runned on to his owne deſtruction. He that trauelleth by night vpon the edge and hanging of a ſteep hil, from which if he ſhould fall he muſt needs breake his neck, goeth on without feare, becauſe in the darke he ſeeth not the daunger: but 
                     •
                  et him be brought back at light of day, it wil make him euen quake to thinke vpon the peril he was in, & wonder that euer he ſhould eſcape it. In like ſort, he that is in the blindneſſe of ignorance without ye word, the ſame is hourely ready to fall into the pit of hell; yet he feareth it not, becauſe he ſeeth it not: but if euer he haue any remorce by the light of the Goſpel ſhining in his heart, it wil terrifie him to remember his former miſery, and make his belly to tremble to conſider it: ſo that here is the ſecond errour in this ignorant obiection. Men conclude there was no danger in the dayes of blindneſſe, becauſe they ſaw no danger, whereas indeed the daunger was ſo much the greater.

A third error there is yet in this exception, & that is, that they conſider not how that the refuſall of Gods mercy which is freely offered in the preaching of ye word, doth double their ſinne, and make their condemnation more iuſt by whom it is refuſed.Ioh. 5 32. 
                  If I had not come and ſpoken vnto them, they ſhould not haue had ſin, (ſayth our Sauior) that is, they had not bene chargeable with this ſinne of contempt of me and of my doctrine: But now haue they no cloke for their ſin, now they haue nothing to plead for excuſe. If this were duly thought vpon, that the neglect of the word, when the meanes of making the ſame familiar vnto them is become common among them, did make them guilty of a greater ſin before God, men would then not dare like the deafe Adder to ſtop their cares, and to ſuffer the holy doctrine of God to fal to the ground vnregarded. Thus I hope I haue ſhewed the vnreaſonableneſſe of this firſt reaſon.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  This that you haue ſpoken as it maketh me ſee plainly the idleneſſe o
                        •
                      this ignorant exception, ſo it calleth to my remembrance a notable place of ſcripture which I once heard you alleage in one of

your ſermons to this or the like purpoſe: it is a part of Paul his ſpeech at Athens. The time of this ignorance (ſaith he) God lightly paſſing ouer,
                  
                  Act 17.10. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  now he admoniſheth al men euery where to repent. It ſeemeth to me that this place may be applied fitly to this matter.
                  
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               It is well remembred: for indeed that ſpéech fitteth well with this point. Paul there diſputing with the heathen that worſhipped dumbe idols, and thought the Godhead to be like gold or ſiluer, or ſtone, grauen by the art and inuention of man: leaſt they ſhould obiect noueltie vnto him, and ſhould ſay as the Papiſts do at this day, how was it poſſible that all the world ſhould for ſo many yeares be deceiued: he telleth them that it ſéemed good vnto God, for cauſes beſt knowne vnto himſelfe, to permit the ignorance of ſo many thouſands of yeares, yet ſo as that time of blindneſſe being now determined, men ſhould not pleade preſcription, reckoning more of an old error thē of newly reuealed truth: but ſhould open their eares and harts to this his generall ſummons to repentāce. I thank you for minding me of this place;

it ſheweth notably what a fond thing it is, not to take notice of the truth reuealed, but to preferre a long continued ignorance before it. Haue you any more exceptions of this nature, forged in the ſhop of ignorance? like enough you haue; for it is an old and a true ſaying, that error is infinite, though truth be but one. If this that you haue named haue any moe fellowes, bring them forth; I doubt not, but by the grace of Chriſt to diſcountenance them.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  Yes ſure: when the multitude heare it taught, that the preaching of the word is a thing of that nature and neceſſarie vſe, that without it men ordinarily can not be ſaued, they crie out by and by; And what is then become of our forefathers, they had no preaching, yet they were in their times good people, honeſt, and well eſteemed in the places where they liued. If we ſhould then yeeld to this, that this preaching is with ſo reuerent a regard to be depended vpon, we muſt needs condemne our progenitors out of whoſe loyns we are come, which to do were more then inhumanitie. I can tell you ſir, this is an argument that hath a generall approbation,

and therefore I pray you looke well to it that you can anſwer it.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               Well, as hard as it is, yet it is not ſo intricate as was Sampſons riddle,Iudg. 14 12. that in ſeuen dayes could not be interpreted, for indeed it is of no value. It is true, we are both by nature and by religion to honor the memories of our aunceſtors, and in all good things to be imitators of them; but in maters of religion we are not to haue an eye to them or to their times, but we muſt conſider what it is which the Lord requireth at our hands. Whether they were ſaued or no, it is not for vs to enquire: if the Lord haue dealt more mercifully with vs then he did with them, we haue cauſe to magnifie his holy name, to looke to our ſelues that we deſpiſe not the riches of his bountie, and to leaue them to the Lord to whom they ſtand or fall. It is a good ſaying of an auncient father to this purpoſe:Cypr. li. 2. ep. 3. 
                  If my predeceſſors (ſayth he) either by ignorance or by ſimplicitie haue not kept and holden that which our Lord hath taught them by his example and authority, the mercy of our Lord might pardon them. But as the good Doctor ſaith, We cannot

hope for the like, hauing better meanes of inſtruction. When the outward ordinary meanes failed, Gods hand was not ſhortened, but he was able euen in the middeſt of blindneſſe to ſaue thoſe which belonged to the election of grace. As for vs,Heb. 2.
                        •
                     . 2. Cor. 6.1 it ſhall not be ſafe for vs to neglect this ſo great ſaluation, or to receiue the grace of God in vaine, fooliſhly aduenturing our ſelues vpon the vnknowne conditiō of our forefathers. And this I hope may ſuffice to take away the edge of this fancie. It is humanitie to thinke the beſt of our forefathers, but it is diuinitie to looke carefully to our ſelues.

               Who would think it poſſible that men ſo dull and vncapable in matters which concerne their greateſt good, ſhould be abounding with arguments wherewith to pleade euen againſt their owne ſoules. But the diuell is a cunning inſtructor, and laboreth to ſtrengthen men in ignorance (becauſe it is the ſcepter of his kingdome) as much as it is poſſible. Let vs heare therefore what the ignorant, with whom it hath bene your hap to conuerſe, haue yet further to alleage.
            
            
               Nymphas.
               
                  They ſay that the moſt learned of you all, who are called Preachers, when you haue ſhewed the vttermoſt of your cunning, can ſay no more then they know already; namely, that they muſt loue God aboue all, and their neighbours as themſelues: and ſeeing they know this well enough already, what needeth (ſay they) any more inſtruction.
               
            
            
               Epaphras.
               This is a conceipt ſcarce worthy the confuting; yet leſt my ſilence ſhould breede an opinion in you, that

there is more in it then indeede there is; do but conſider of it by the like: If a man ſpeaking of huſbandrie, and hearing another to diſcourſe of the great ſkill and long experience that is requiſit to make a man a good huſband, ſhould ſay by and by, Tuſh, what talke you ſo much of ſkil and knowledge herein? Why? It is nothing but this, to plow, to ſow, and to reape: ſhould not ſuch a one deſeruedly be laughed at, and be a ſcorne to thoſe which heare him? Yes, and not without cauſe: for euery man knoweth, that though this be the ſum of huſbandry, yet there are diuers particulars belonging to theſe, which are neither ſoone learned nor eaſily practiſed: ſo that he who deſireth to be a good huſband, and to profit by his labors, and to make the beſt of euery thing, muſt not ſatiſfie himſelfe to know this, that there is nothing in huſbandry but to eare the land, and to reape the fruite, but he muſt learne alſo what belongeth to the right performance of theſe, otherwiſe he may erre in ſowing, play the foole in plowing, and come ſhort in reaping. And euen ſo it is in this caſe: true it is, that the ſumme of all religion

conſiſteth in this, in louing God aboue all, and a mans neighbor as him ſelfe: but what then? If a man ſhall thinke by and by that he is a good Chriſtian, and knoweth enough, becauſe he apprehendeth theſe generals, the ſame is exceedingly deceiued, for there are many other branches belonging to each of theſe, which vnleſſe a man do know, he can neither loue God as hée ought, nor his neighbour as hee ſhould: ſo that to my ſeeming, euen common reaſon is ſufficient to conuince mens ignorance herein. There is not the meaneſt profeſſion, the courſeſt trade, the plaineſt occupation, but it hath (as we ſay) a certaine myſterie in it, there are many rules belonging to it: which muſt be knowne, not in groſſe onely, but euen very preciſely, before a man can in any mediocritie practiſe the duties of the ſame.

                  It is true that you ſay, for mine owne part I confeſſe it: but yet Ignorance will replie and ſay, Will you then vrge vpon euery common man the knowledge of euery point which in preaching you deliuer: that ſeemeth very

vnreaſonable; neither can men that want the helpes of learning attaine vnto it: and will not a good meaning make a ſupply for all this?

               How vnreaſonable it may ſéeme in mens eyes to be vrged to ſuch exact knowledge, I cannot tel: this I am ſure of, that we that are Miniſters, are charged to ſhew the people the whole coūſel of God,
                  Act 20 27. Ier. 6.2. & not to keep a word back. If we cannot be diſpenſed with to keepe ſecret any thing, how ſhal it be tolerated in the people to neglect the knowledge of that, which we are bound by vertue of our commiſſion to deliuer? It was but an idle prayer of the Apoſtle, on the behalfe of the Coloſſians, to begge of God that they might be fulfilled with knowledge of Gods will,
                  Col. 1.9 
                  in all wiſedome and ſpirituall vnderſtanding: or for the Philippians,Philip. 1.9 10 that they might abound in all iudgement, and diſcerne things that differ. I ſay theſe were but idle wiſhes, if ſo be that full meaſure of knowledge is not required of euery Chriſtian. And if ſome certain rudiments, & as it were ſhreds of knowledge were ſufficient, the Hebrews might well haue complained of wrong,

in that they were ſo ſharply cenſured for their being dull of hearing,

                   and for that they ſtill after ſo much teaching needed the firſt principles of the word of God. And ſure, if it be vnreaſonable to vrge men to know ſo much, we muſt (which were blaſphemie) challenge the wiſe God as an vnneceſſary burdener of mankind, who hath reuealed ſo much. As it is curioſitie to enquire into that which God hath concealed, ſo it is vnthankfulneſſe not to take notice of whatſoeuer he hath left written for our learning.

beſt cannot know all, ſhall he therefore not labour to know any thing? God forbid. Ignorance by a kind of neceſſity may ſeeme to haue ſome excuſe, but a voluntary neglect of that which a man may know, cannot haue ſo much as a colour of allowance.

                  Yet me thinkes it is hard for the common people (the greateſt part whereof cannot ſo much as reade) to attain to ſo much knowledge as you ſeeme to perſwade, eſpecially if withall they be ſuch as liue by their labour, and haue charge of children, how ſhall they ſpare time for ſuch occaſions?

                  I haue very carefully attended to this which you haue ſpoken, and I praiſe God I find much comfort in it; yet there is one thing behind which I haue ſtill looked for, which I am bold to put you in mind of, leſt you ſhould forget it, and that is touching the good meaning which the common ſort ſo much truſt vnto: they ſay their heart is good though their skill be ſmall, and they hope that God will accept it. I pray you ſatisfie me in this alſo, and then I ſhal be reaſonably furniſhed againſt the plea of the ignorant.

               You do well to mind me of it, howſoeuer I was euen now of my ſelfe comming to it:Luke 8.15. 
                  An honeſt and good heart is a thing in the eyes of God much eſteemed; and it is the eſpeciall thing he craueth

of vs, to giue him our heart:
                  Prouerb. 23 26. yet generally that which men call a good heart to God-ward, is nothing leſſe then that which it is called: for ſo long as a mans heart is a dull, ignorant,Ier. 17.9. vnregenerate and vnreformed heart, it is wicked aboue all things. There can be no goodneſſe in that heart where there dwelleth groſſe & blockiſh ignorance of God and of his truth:Prouerbs 1.22. Pſalme 50 17. It is no good heart which loueth fooliſhnes and hateth knowledge, and caſteth the word of God behind it.
                  Mathew 12.34. It is no good heart which maketh not the mouth to ſpeake out of the abundance of it,
                  1. Pet. 3.15. and to be able to giue a reaſon of the hope that is in it.
                  Rom. 10.2. There may be a zeale of God, where there is no knowledge of God; but it is but a blind zeale, and God eſteemeth it not. They which kil and perſecute Gods ſeruants, may haue a kind of good meaning, and may thinke that in ſo doing they do God ſeruice,
                  Iohn 16 2. yet this cannot helpe them, ſo that men are deceiued in their good meaning: for no meaning is good, but that which is guided by knowledge: yea though the thing meant be in it owne nature good, yet if the meaner be not aſſured of the goodneſſe of it

frō Gods word, his meaning is naught, & that by the the rule of Scripture, which telleth vs,Roman. 14.23. that whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne.

But what thing is there ſo ſenſleſſe, whereto ignorance in the Scripture may not be perſwaded? It is our Engliſh prouerbe, The blind eateth many a flie: and ſo indeede the ignorant in the booke of God embrace many groſſe and ridiculous abſurdities: for if men knew what the Scripture ſaith in this caſe, they would neuer caſt out ſuch an idle ſpeech: Salomon ſaith,Prouerb. 28 9. 
                  He that turneth away his eare from hearing the law, euen his prayer ſhall be abominable. What thinke you ſhall become of their prayers then who

reſolue not to affoord the vſe of their eares vnto Gods word? Do they not make a faire hand, when by their contempt of preaching they bring a curſe vpon their praying? Adde hitherto that Paul ſayth expreſly,Rom. 10.14. that as men cannot call on him in whom they haue not beleeued, ſo neither can they beleeue without hearing, nor heare without a Preacher. Can men credite Paul in this, and yet thinke to pray well without the helpe of preaching? Surely no. How can men pray aright, without knowledge of their owne wants, without the apprehenſion of the promiſes of God, vpon which to build their aſſurance to be heard? and how can they attaine to either of theſe ordinarily, but by the preaching, expounding, opening & applying of Gods word? That which men commonly call praying, is but a lip-labor, conſiſting in the recitall of a few words, the ſenſe & meaning whereof is not vnderſtood, and it is méere babling in the eares of God; it may be well called the ſacrifice of fooles:
                  Eccleſ. 4.17. and it may truly be ſaid of ſuch blind deuotions and tongue-prayers, which the heart doeth not conceiue, as it was ſayd

Well ſir, now that you haue armed me againſt the common pretences of the ignorant ſort, whereby they make themſelues beleeue, or rather are made beleeue by the diuell, that it is no daunger to contemne preaching.

they haue no other ſhift, crie out vpon Preachers, thereby to cloke their owne iniquity: therein not much vnlike to him that in a throng at a fair or market, bids men beware of the Cut-purſe, that he in the meane time (being a man of ye trade) may practiſe his diuing into mens pockets with the leſſe ſuſpicion. And marke it when you will, you ſhall neuer find them any other then méere ſenſual men, yea and for the moſt part openly noted for ſome one bad courſe or other, of drunkenneſſe, oppreſſion, vſury, couetouſnes, adultery, or the like, that make this obiection. Secondly, (becauſe there may be truth in an obiection, though there be little truth or honeſtie in him that maketh it) know this therefore for the ſubſtance of this cauill, that put caſe it were ſo, (which thankes be to God is not ſo) that all Preachers did confute their owne ſermons with their euill life, and had Eſaus hands with Iacobs voice, and were like a file which ſmootheth other thinges, it ſelfe remayning rough: yet this could make nothing againſt preaching. For is Phyſicke naught, becauſe many Phyſitians perhappes

liue contrary to their owne rules of phiſicke? Or is law damnable, becauſe ſome profeſſors thereof do liue lawleſſe, giuing rules of equity to others, themſelues keeping none but ill rule? No man wil be ſo without ſenſe to affirme it: why thē? ſhal the courſe of preaching be cōdemned, for the ſuppoſed miſdemeanor of them which preach? God forbid. Is any mā ſo vnwiſe as to diſobey a warrant comming apparently frō a man of authority, becauſe the Conſtable or Tithingman is a naughty fellow that bringeth it? Who then but either a foole or a froward hart wil tread the holy doctrine of God vnder his feete, becauſe he is a man of no good cariage that deliuereth the ſame? Thirdly, men are to conſider this alſo, that all are not Miniſters which are ſo called, neither all true Preachers come frō God that ſtand vp in ye pulpit: for in theſe corrupt times many are crept into the Church of God by the window, whom God did neuer ſet apart to that holy ſeruice:S

it is againſt common reaſon to turne their miſcariage into the generall diſgrace of all honeſt Miniſters. There be many counterfeit dog-leaches and pretenced Surgions, that hauing gotten a litle Rubarbe or Balſamum, and ſome few words of art, run about the country and beguile the people, and cozen them of their mony, purging their purſes and ſcouring their bags vnder colour of clenſing their bodies & ſearching their ſores. Shal we ſay therefore that al Phiſitions though they be neuer ſo well learned, neuer ſo well experienced, neuer ſo conſcionable and wary in their courſes of adminiſtring, are cozeners, and that it were pittie but the countrey were rid of them all? it were an indignitie once to imagine it. There is no profeſſion, but it hath as it were a certaine ſcumme, and there are ſome that make ſhew of it, that are altogether vnworthy of it. Shall the vileneſſe & vnbeſeeming cariage of thoſe that are but the refue, and as I may ſo ſpeake the taile of an honeſt profeſſion, be caſt into the face of all the reſt that belong vnto it? Reaſon it ſelfe ſayth it is vnméete. And men would ſoone yéeld to

this, were it not that the diuell hath taught them to be wiſe in any thing, ſauing in religion, to fauor any profeſſion ſauing that of the miniſtery. Men are herein like vnto many Lawyers, who if you put them a caſe, without naming the parties, will tell you truly what is law: but whē they vnderſtand who they be whō the matter concerneth, then they change their opinion, and the law is altered. So in the world, aſk you any man of cōmon vnderſtanding this queſtiō, whether it be meet that all of a trade or company ſhould be chalenged, becauſe ſome ſuch or ſuch are worthy to be puniſhed; he will tell you there is no reaſon for it: but come to particulars touching preachers, thē he is of another mind, he wil be ready to ſay yt al Chriſts diſciples were naught becauſe Iudas was a diuel:
                  Iohn 6.70. & becauſe he (it may be) knoweth ſome two or 3. ſir Iohns or ſome other (perhaps of better note in ye eyes of the world, but yet ſcarcely worthy of their places) to be climing with Diotrephes,
                  Iohn 9 2. Timoth 4.10. 
                  or embracing this preſent world with Demas,
                   or carying themſelues inſolently with Paſhur,
                  Ierem. 20.1.2. or otherwiſe kéeping bad rule with him, who imagining

that his maſter doth defer his coming,
                  Luke 12.45. 
                  begins to ſmite the ſeruants and the maidens, and to eate and drinke and to be drunken: by and by he concludeth, that they are all naught, and voweth that he will neuer beléeue any of them, for all their ſhewes of holineſſe. Fourthly, for the further cleering of this point, this is alſo to be conſidered, that Miniſters and Preachers do not thinke themſelues freed from common infirmities, or endued with ſome greater power or larger priuiledge againſt ſin, then others: & therefore euery ſlip is not by & by to be taken hold of (as the maner is) and to be turned to the blemiſhing of a whole profeſſion. He is ſaid to be a man of vpright conuerſation, not who ſlippeth neuer, (for who is he that can vnderſtand his faults?
                  Pſal. 19.125) but he who by his ſeldome ſlips, and by his not continuing in any one knowne euill, ſheweth himſelfe to be a man that vnfainedly deſireth to haue his cariage ſuch, as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt. Laſtly,Phil. 1.27. mark this alſo & you ſhal find it true, thoſe who are euer harping vpon this ſtring, touching ye liues of preachers, let thē be vrged to particulars, you ſhal perceiue yt either

their euill ſpeaking is occaſioned by ſuch kind of Miniſters as I before named, or elſe if they haue any exception againſt any of the better and painfuller ſort, it is ſuch, which if it be well examined and throughly looked into, will be found rather to ſauor of malice in the ſpeaker, then to argue any great error in the accuſed. I told you I ſhould be long in this point, but now I haue done, vnleſſe you haue ought further to vrge therein.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  The moſt that I haue to ſay, is, that men of the world that ſhall heare this Plea of yours, will ſtraightway ſay, that you can ſpeake well for your ſelues, and that though you aggrauate other mens ſins vpon occaſions, yet you can ſalue vp matters that concerne your ſelues, and helpe to couer your owne infirmities.

               The diuell doth well anſwer his name; for there is nothing can be ſo wel ſpoken, but he and his can cauil at it: for mine owne part, I ſtriue with my ſelf to ſpeake vnpartially. The profeſſion I muſt loue, becauſe God hath called me vnto it; yet were I not of it, God hath taught me to honor it,Romanes 10.15 becauſe the feet of them are beautifull which bring glad tidings

of peace. And howſoeuer many do ſo far exalt themſelues in their birth, in their riches, in their wiſedome, in their perſonage and bloud, that they think it a diſparagement vnto them to conſecrate all their life to the miniſterie of the Goſpell: yet as Chriſt himſelfe diſdained not the title of a Miniſter,
                  Romanes 8. ſo among all the titles of kingdomes and countries, this was to that great King the moſt honorable, Solomon the Preacher. I muſt therefore as a Miniſter, but eſpecially as a Chriſtian, endeuor to maintaine the credit of the miniſtery. And yet I am not ſo caried away with a humor of magnifying the profeſſion, but that I do ſee and bemone both mine and other mens imperfections. I know, that though it be true, that we are many times ſlaundered by ſoule mouthes, yet we often faile, and giue great offence euen vnto thoſe that feare God, who depending vpon vs,
                  1. Pet. 5
                        •
                     . are either grieued in heart, or (which is worſe) grieuouſly miſ-led, by our want of watchfulneſſe ouer our ſelues. And I heartily beg of God ſo to ſtabliſh vs in euery word and good work,

                   that while we liue we may be an example to them that

beleeue: and when we haue finiſhed our courſe, the people may haue cauſe to remēber vs,
                  Hebr. 3.17. & to follow our faith, conſidering what hath bin the end of our conuerſation.
               
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  My heart ſaith Amen vnto your good praier: and God forgiue vs our backwardnes in that we make ſo ſeldom mentiō of you which are our Miniſters in our prayers vnto him. But now to the next exceptiō which is againſt the hearers; the common ſaying is, that there are none vſually ſo bad as theſe Puritanes (for ſo in their ignorance, not knowing truly what a Puritane is, and in their malice ſeeking to diſgrace honeſt men, they terme euery mā that makes conſcience of hearing the word, for the building of himſelf in holy faith) they are nothing but a pack of hypocrites,
                  Iude 20. 
                  men that are not to be truſted for all their faire ſhewes, holy horſes, and the like names of diſgrace, which hell can inuent: and out of this puddle of reprochfull ſpeeches againſt the louers of preaching, they gather vp filth to caſt into the face of preaching it ſelfe.

               This exception, and that which went next before, are ſo wel like, yt they do eaſily appéere to haue had one father, euen the diuel, who was a ſlanderer from

the beginning: but bleſſed be God that it is no matter of any great difficultie to diſcouer,Reuel 2 24. euen the deepeneſſe of Satan to be meere ſimplicitie. Firſt then, for this touching the hypocriſie of our hearers, it is but a meere ſlander; for (to the glory of God be it ſpokē) there are many of thoſe that reuerence this ſo much contemned courſe of preaching, who haue not onely a ſhew of godlineſſe,
                  Tit. 3.
                        •
                      Tit. 2 10. but do alſo feele the power thereof; and are careful, as they beleeue in God, ſo to ſhew forth good works; ſo that their liues do adorne the doctrine of God our Sauior, yea and (which is the cauſe of ye ſo great malice of the vngodly) euē 
                  reproue the leudnes of the irreligious.
                  Epheſ. 5.11. Secondly, ſuppoſe it to be ſo (as it may well, hypocrites mingling themſelues with the ſoundeſt Chriſtians) that ſome of thoſe which cary a face of holineſſe and zeale, & loue to the word,Epheſ 5 11. do notwithſtanding hold fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkneſſe, liuing after the luſts of men,
                  1. Pet. 4 2.3. 
                  and running with the wicked to the ſame exceſſe of riot; yet who is able to ſay that euer they receiued any encoragemēt by preaching ſo to do? Hath that taught them any ſuch matter, and not rather the cleane contrary? Let malice ſpeake,

if it be not conſtrained for very ſhame to kéep ſilence. Doth the preacher perſwade any man to be an vſurer, an oppreſſor, a hard dealer, a drunkard, a whoremaſter, or the like? Nay it is well knowne, that it teſtifieth to one & other,1. Theſſal. 4.16. that the Lord is auenger of al ſuch things & that for them his wrath commeth vpon the children of diſobedience.
                  Epheſ 5 6. Theſe two things, namely the falſhood of the exception, and the bad conſequence of it, if it were true, may ſtop their mouthes which vſe it: but you told me (as I remember) that there be ſundry arguments of this kind. I pray you let vs heare them: no doubt you ſhal ſee them all when they are arraigned and brought to receiue their trial at the Tribunall ſeat of Gods word, to be condemned for lying vanities, and to be no more able to ſtand before it,1. Sam. 5.
                        •
                     4. thā the Philiſtins Dagon could keepe his ſhrine (though no doubt he was faſt nailed to it) when the arke of Iehouah came in place.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  The next exception is of a larger ſcope, and fighteth againſt you with the generall wretchedneſſe of this laſt generation. You ſhall ſee it in it owne likeneſſe, that you may the better iudge of it.

It commonly runneth thus: in former times when there was leſſe preaching, and the Scripture was more geaſon then now it is, the world (they ſay) was much better, there was more loue, more hoſpitalitie, more truth, more mercie, more good dealing amongſt men then is to be found at this day: ſo that whereas there is now much lawing, much contention, much oppreſſing, much cruelty, and ſinnes of the like nature, al this is layd vpon the backe of preaching: this is the leauen that hath put the whole world out of taſte; this is alſo a peece of Dagon; ſtump. I make no doubt but the Lord hath furniſhed you with weapons mightie through him, to caſt downe holds,
                  
                  2. Corin. 10 4.5 
                  and euery high thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               I perceiue the Diuell much doubteth the ruine of his kingdome: and therfore though preaching amongſt men is thought to be but wind,Ierem 5.13. yet he féeleth his ſtate begin to totter with the power of it, ſo that he doeth ſtretch his wit, and ſet his pollicy on worke, and ſpareth for no engines to beat downe that which he ſhal neuer be able to ouerturne. And that as we haue ſeene hitherto, ſo I doubt not

but we ſhall further ſée it in the examination of particulars. For thoſe elder times (as men call them) firſt it is to be noted, that it is true indeed that many of thoſe who liued in thē, were in the eies of men very commendable for thoſe morall vertues (as they are termed) of hoſpitalitie, of bountie, of humanity, of plain dealing, & the like: the reaſon was this, Satan let them alone in theſe things, becauſe he did hold them captiue at his will in the principal. Though he doth hate theſe ſpecialties in their owne nature, being an vtter enemie to all goodneſſe, yet he was content to giue way in thoſe leſſer things, ſo long as he could nuzle them in ignorance of God and of his word, which he well knew was both hold enough for himſelf, and ſufficient inough alſo to blemiſh and diſgrace all thoſe reputed vertues before God. But now the light of knowledge being come into the world, and ſpreading it ſelf further by the more common vſe of preaching, Sathan ſecretly perſwadeth many, that it is enough for them to haue knowledge, though they neglect practiſe, & he laboreth alſo by killing mens care to ſhew themſelues forward in theſe duties

of ciuilitie, to leſſen the credit of the Goſpel, & to haue matter of ſlaunder againſt the knowledge of Gods truth. Secondly to ſpeake more ſpecially of this laſt and worſt age of the world: if it be well vnderſtood, preaching may be ſayd to be the occaſion, though not the naturall cauſe of the extreame wretchedneſſe thereof: according as Paul ſayth, that ſinne tooke occaſion by the commaundement,
                  Rom. 7.8.9.13. 
                  and when the commaundement came, ſinne reuiued, and grew out of meaſure ſinfull. Now the preaching & publiſhing of the truth, may be ſayd to be the occaſion of much euill in theſe laſt times, in two reſpects: firſt, becauſe of the fuller diſcouery of ſin: In the dayes of former ignorance many of the ſame groſſe ſins were which now are, but either they were ſmothered in the darkneſſe of the times, or if they were a litle diſcried, yet they were reputed nothing ſo odious. But althings when they were reprooued of the light,
                  Epheſ. 5.13. 
                  became manifeſt; for it is light that maketh all things manifeſt: ſo that now ſin being ſeene more, is thought alſo to be more; for ſinne not eſpied, is in mens iudgements as no ſin. So then partly

in this reſpect it may be ſaid, that ſince there was ſo much preaching, the world hath bin worſe, becauſe the holy doctrine which is taught, condemneth many things for ſin, which the blind world eſtéemed as no ſin, and becauſe the liues of thoſe which are conuerted by preaching, do ſhew more euidently the monſtrous ſins of thoſe which are giuen ouer to vngodlineſſe. Secondly, the preaching of the word is an occaſion of ſin, (as alſo the law of God is) not in it ſelfe, or in it owne nature; (for it reproueth ſin, and ſetteth it ſelfe againſt all maner of vngodlineſſe:) but it is ſo, partly through the corruption of our nature, partly thorough the iuſt iudgment of God: the corruption of our nature is alwayes the more furious, the more it is reſtrained, ſtriuing ſtill to do that moſt which is moſt forbidden: euery humor deſireth that moſt, whereby it may be moſt encreaſed. Let a Phyſitian forbid a melancholike man ſuch and ſuch meates, he ſhall find himſelfe to haue an appetite to no meate ſo much, as to that which is inhibited. I do verily think the other trees in Paradiſe affoorded fruite as pleaſant

to the eye, and as good for meate as the forbidden tree: but when as Satan had made a little entry, then euen that circumſtance that it was forbidden, did ſet an edge vpon the womans deſire, and made her more faine to eate of that one, then of any of the reſt which were allowed.1. Corint. 15.
                        •
                     
                   
                  Paul ſayth that the law is the ſtrength of ſinne, both becauſe it encreaſeth the guilt of ſinne, and becauſe ſin thereupon becommeth more outragious: according as Ieremie witneſſeth out of his owne experience: I cried out (ſayth he) of wrong,
                  Ier. 20.8. 
                  and proclaimed deſolation, therefore the word of the Lord was made a reproch vnto me: it ſéemeth that vpon his preaching the people grew to greater inſolencie. Beſides, there are many points of neceſſitie to be taught, which though they be deliuered with neuer ſo great circumſpection, yet the leudneſſe of mans heart, not being ouer-ruled by the power of Gods ſpirit, will abuſe the ſame. So we ſee, the doctrine of Iuſtification by faith only, breedeth negligence in good works, as appéereth by the caueat of the Apoſtle, What ſhall we ſay then?
                  Rom. 6.1. 
                  ſhal we cōtinue ſtil in ſin that grace may abound? God forbid.
                  
So the doctrine of our fréedom by Chriſt from the curſe of the law, bringeth forth carnal libertie: that made Paul ſo carefull to vſe that reſtraint, Only vſe not your libertie as an occaſion to the fleſh.
                  Gal. 5.13. In like maner this point, that we are inſufficiēt to kéep the law, & that we cannot ſo much as think a good thought, but as God worketh it in vs: Satan works by & by vpon a ſuppoſed aduantage, & draws (as much as he may) to careleſnes thereupon. And therfore ye ſpirit of God in his great wiſdome, together with the teaching of that point,P
                        •
                     . 2.12, 13. that it is God which worketh in vs both the will and the deed, coupleth this exhortation, Make an end of your owne ſaluation with feare and trembling. The ſame might be ſhewed by many other points, which yet notwithſtanding is ſo, not in the nature of the doctrine, but in ye wretched diſpoſition of mans hart, who abuſeth the comfortable doctrine of the Goſpel,I
                        •
                     de 4. 
                  and turneth the grace of our God into wantonneſſe. Againe, as ſin through the corruptiō of nature taketh occaſiō to multiply it ſelf by the doctrine preached, ſo it falleth out by the iuſt iudgement of God, yt the contempt of much preaching

bringeth forth abundance of iniquitie.Iſay. 55.1
                        •
                     . 
                  My word (ſaith God by the Prophet) that goeth out of my mouth, ſhal not returne vnto me void. And therfore in the ſame place it is compared to the raine;
                  Verſe 10. becauſe as the raine maketh ye ground, if not more fruitful, ſurely then more vnprofitable: ſo the word of God, either maketh men hearts ſofter, and themſelues more fruitfull in good workes, or elſe harder, and their liues more abominable. And yet is this no fault in the word,1 Cor 
                        •
                     , 
                        •
                     5. for that is vnto God the ſweete ſauour of Chriſt, euen in them which periſh. I haue bene longer in this point then I thought; but becauſe it is ſo much ſtood vpon by many, I haue the rather endeuored to manifeſt the ful truth in this behalfe.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  Truly for mine owne particular, I muſt needs confeſſe, that you haue taught me more touching this point then I haue heretofore obſerued. Indeed I haue many times wondred how it ſhold come to paſſe, that there being now (as I thinke) much more preaching againſt ſin, then hath bin in the dayes of our forefathers, yet there ſhould be that aboundance of extreme impietie: but now I ſee the reaſon of it.

Firſt, ignorance in Gods word, is the ſupporter of Satans kingdome, and he hauing drowned men in that, gaue way to other things, which being good in their owne nature, and approued of in the eyes of men, yet loſt their grace, being done without knowledge. Secondly, mans corrupt nature, ſpider-like turneth the wholſome doctrine into poiſon, and ſtriueth more when it feeleth it ſelfe limited. Thirdly, it is iuſt with God,Rom. 1.26. 
                     to giue them vp into vile affections,
                  
                  Pſalm. 69.27. 
                  and to lay iniquitie vpon their iniquitie, that they may worke all vncleanneſſe, euen with greedineſſe,
                  
                  Epheſ. 4.19. 2. Theſſal. 2.10

               You haue well obſerued it; that is the very ſubſtance of my anſwer to that exception, which I thinke is ſufficient to ſatiſfie thoſe whom the truth of God grounded vpon the Scripture may ſatiſfie. I pray you now proceed to the next, if there be any more of this kind.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  There is onely to my remembrance one more, and that is taken from the tumults & diuiſions which accompany your doctrine: they ſay it many times breedeth

difference euen among thoſe betwixt whom formerly there was the beſt agreement.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               My good neighbor, maruell not at this: for as I ſhewed you in the beginning of our conference, that reſiſtance doth alwayes accompany the firſt publiſhing of the truth, ſo alſo doth diuiſion of hearts follow it: and to this end is that ſpéech of Chriſt to his Diſciples;Math. 10.34. 
                  Thinke not that I am come to ſend peace into the earth, (that is, ſuch peace as the world dreameth of) I came not to ſend peace, but the ſword. We read that when Paul exerciſed his miniſtery at Iconium,
                  Act. 14.4. there was much ado, and the people of the citie were diuided, and ſome were with the Iewes, and ſome with the Apoſtles. This made him to be accuſed before the ciuill Magiſtrate, for a peſtilent fellow,
                  Acts 24.5. 
                  and a mouer of ſedition, according as at this day, factious and humorous is a common imputation. Now a diuiſion cannot chooſe but follow preaching: for when as among the hearers, ſome mock,
                  Acts 17.12 34. Acts 17 4, 5. 
                  ſome cleaue vnto the teachers, ſome beleeue and others beleue not,
                  Acts 28.29. and men fall to haue great reaſoning among thēſelues,
                  
there cannot but follow a kind of diuiſiō & ſiding: ſo that they which in their ignorance accorded together touching religiō, are by the working of the word ſundred, & ſome become zealous folowers, others malicious oppreſſors, laboring to ſtop ye paſſage of ye Goſpell,Acts 14.10. & to peruert the ſtrait waies of the Lord; & ſome neuters neither cold nor hot,
                  Reu. 3 16. Acts 18.17. but iuſt of deputy Gallio his religion, who cared nothing for thoſe things.
                  Matthew 3.12 The preaching of the word is the fan in the hand of Chriſt by which he parteth his wheat from the chaffe; and whereby he maketh way for that great day of ſeparation,Mathew 25. in which the beleeuing ſheep ſhal be ſeparated from the rebellious and vnbeléeuing goates. Againe, let it not be forgotten that the word in the right applying of it,Epheſ. 5 13. is called a light which maketh all things manifeſt. When things lie his in the darknes, though they al differ each from other in colour, yet they ſéeme all 
                     •
                  o like; but the light approching, the variety of colours is ſoone deſcried. So though men in the duſkiſhnes of ignorance are reputed to be knit together in the vnitie of affection, yet when the bright beames of Gods word breake in among them,

                  the thoughts of many hearts be opened,
                  Luke 1.35. and then you ſhall ſee diuers humors, and varietie of diſpoſitions. By theſe things it appeareth, that if it be well vnderſtood, diuiſion and tumult (eſpecially at the beginning and firſt entrie of it among an vntaught people) muſt needes follow the ſoundnes of ſetled preaching; though thoſe that are reclaimed and brought to the knowledge of God, are al of one heart and of one ſoule,
                  Acts. 4.32. Phil. 3.16. Epheſ. 4 3. 
                  proceeding by one rule, minding one thing; and endeuouring to keepe the vnitie of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.
               
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  You haue (thankes be to God) at leaſt to my iudgement, well quit your ſelfe againſt this ſort of men. The next that you haue to do withall, are more dangerous, being ſuch as Paul ſaith,
                  1. Corinth. 3.18 
                  which do ſeeme wiſe in this world, and do both liue after a good ciuill faſhion, and doe alſo make ſhew to be not altogether enemies vnto religion. They haue alſo ſome inſight into the Scripture, and are wont to reade it, and other good bookes priuately: onely this their reſolution is to keepe a certaine temper in matters of Religion, to carrie themſelues in an allowable conformitie,

and not to be ouerforward as many ſeeme to be, whoſe zeale they account raſh and heady indiſcretion.

               The daunger of this kind of people, is moſt of all in reſpect of themſelues, becauſs this, to be wiſe in a mans owne eies,
                  Prouerbs 3 7. and to feare God, cannot ſtand together; otherwiſe for anſwering any thing that they are able to obiect, it is a matter of no ſuch great difficulty:1. Cor. 1.25.

               Nymph.
               
                  I am glad you are ſo confident: for to tell you true, theſe things being as they are, very agreeing to mans reaſon, haue much troubled me, and I haue not vpon the ſodaine knowne well what to anſwer, when in my preſence theſe things haue bene vrged by ſuch as are thought in the world to be men of good diſcretion.

                  Firſt then it is demaunded why preaching ſhould be the moſt excellent meanes of ſpirituall inſtruction, and wherefore you ſhould take ſo much vpon you, as that your ſpeaking is able to ſaue mens ſoules: you be

but men as others are, and it is but your pride, who becauſe you would be thought ſome body, do thus endeuour to extoll the worth and neceſſitie of your profeſſion.

               Here is indéed a perillous argument, it ſauoreth altogether of the ſawcineſſe of an ignorant and vnhumbled heart. It is come to a proper paſſe, when as the ſonne of man, who dwelleth in a houſe of clay,

the Angell of God, ſaying, Lo, God hath giuen vnto thee all that ſayle with thee: yet notwithſtanding, when as afterwards, the mariners were about to flie out of the ſhip, and had let downe the boate into the ſea, purpoſely to make eſcape,Verſe 30.31.

Did Paule herein ſtreighten the almightie power of God, in ſaying, there could be no ſafetie without the ſtaying of thoſe mariners in the ſhippe? Was the Lords hand ſhortened, that he could not deliuer, but by the ſkill & induſtrie of thoſe men? Surely no: but, becauſe Paul knew, yt God was not pleaſed otherwiſe to giue deliuerance: therefore he ſaid that vnleſſe the mariners taried, ye company could not be preſerued.

So touching preaching, we may ſay without any reſtraint of Gods power, that except there be preaching men cannot be ſaued: not that God is tied to the voice of man, that without it he cannot ſaue; but becauſe the Scripture hath reuealed to vs, that theſe things are linked together with an indiſſoluble knot, praying, faith, hearing, preaching, ſending. There is no praying without faith, there is no faith but by hearing, there is no hearing to beget faith but of a preacher ſent, that is furniſhed with gifts frō aboue, for the feeding of the flock of Chriſt depending vpon him with knowledge and vnderſtanding.

If it ſhall be vrged (as me thought you alſo touched it) that we ſhal by this, preiudice them who haue either liued & died without preaching, or thoſe who enioy it not now: I anſwer, that it is one thing what God can do where the meanes is wanting, another thing what he will doe where the means is ſupplied.

He that (thoſe two yeeres being expired) had truſted to the former courſes, neglecting huſbandry, out of al doubt he might haue bene ſtarued: and yet before, he that had called Gods power, to furniſh them with foode without ſowing into queſtion, had bene worthy to be puniſhed.

vpon the earth without the Sun. I do apply al theſe things thus: the want of the meanes of publicke preaching in former ages, could not be any hindrance vnto God in ſauing thoſe which he knew before,

That which I ſay touching the times of the Egyptian darknes of Popery, may be ſaid alſo of many parte of the Realme, which notwithſtanding the long flouriſhing of the Goſpell in this land, yet I know not through whoſe default) neuer enioyed the benefit & comfort of ſetled preaching: for though for the moſt part it be true, that where the Lord hath much people, there he is not wāting to ſend ſome,Acts 18.10 Ve

of God among them; yet as he ſometimes vouchſafeth a Preacher to impudent and ſtif-necked children,
                  Ezech. 2.4.5. who will not heare, to to that end, that in the day of vengeance they may know there hath bene a Prophet among them: ſo alſo it pleaſeth him by ſecret and hidden, yea and very vnlikely courſes, to affoord vnto ſome hearts the bleſſing of inward conuerſion, vppon whom he hath not beſtowed the benefite of outward inſtruction by a Preacher. But what then? Yet this remaineth cercertaine, that as when the good meanes is wanting, and cannot by any meanes be procured, the power and mercie of God muſt not be diſtruſted: ſo when the meanes is beſtowed, his bountie cannot without great ſin be deſpiſed. It is herein, as it is in the caſe of ye Sacraments: it is not ſimply the want of them (when a man cannot, though faine he would, become partaker of them) but the contempt which is damnable. As for example, if a father vnneceſſarily deferre the baptiſme of his child longer then the time appoynted by the order of the Church, it is a ſin in him, if the child die without baptiſme: ſo likewiſe for a man

vſually to turne is backe from the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, making no reckoning of the cōfort offred therein, it is doubtleſſe a fault, which God will not let to go away vnpuniſhed. The ſame may be ſaid of the word preached, if a man be depriued of it through a kind of vnauoydable neceſſitie, ſimply there is no preiudice to a mans ſaluation thereby, if ſo be theſe things be ioyned with it: firſt, that in this ſtraite,Pſalme 42 1. the ſoule do pant after that great benefit of which it is depriued: ſecondly, that a man do both deſire & require that one thing of the Lord, euen to behold the beautie of the Lord,

are good, and might profite, if they were not vſed with contempt of the principal. This is my iudgment touching this ſuppoſal, that by preſſing the worth of preaching, we do confine as it were Gods grace, and

I find in the holy hiſtorie, the teaching by the miniſterie of man to be preferred before thoſe things to which I ſuppoſe no man will dare to equal his owne priuate induſtry. When Chriſt called Paul from heauen, and Paul demanded,Acts 9.6. 
                  Lord what wilt thou that I do? a man in reaſon would haue thought that there could haue bene no more excellent means for Pauls inſtructiō,

then if Chriſt ſhould haue diſcourſed to him with his owne mouth; yet to maintaine the credit of Gods ordinance, and to make knowne the bleſſing that followeth it, Paul is commanded to depend vpon the miniſtery and direction of Ananias. Not much vnlike is that example of Cornelius: it pleaſed God to ſend an Angell vnto him,A

Chriſt, or the inſtruction of an Angell? Chriſt a litle before his death, among other things whereby he endeuored to comfort the harts of his diſciples, deliuered to them this promiſe, Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you,

of ſinners,1.

                  Hebrewes 1.14 Great is the benefite of priuate reading, eſpecially of the bookes of holy ſcripture: but yet as giuing at endance to reading in a Miniſter,
                  1. Timothy 4.13 is to make him the better able to diſcharge his publike dutie, in exhortation and doctrine: ſo the chiefe end of priuate ſearching the ſcripture by priuate mē, is in reſpect of the publike miniſtery,

that before hand they may be prepared to it, & afterwards may the better know how to profit by it: for the former of theſe two (namely preparation by reading to the publike hearing); it is a fit ſaying of Chryſoſtome:
                  Chryſ. Homil. 3. de Lazaro. We do (ſayth he) oftentimes tell you before hand, the text whereof our purpoſe is to entreate, that in the meane while you (taking your booke, and weighing the ſumme and ſtate of the place) may make your minds fitter to receiue thoſe points which ſhal after be deliuered. As indéed the ignorance of the people in the language of the ſcripture, and the generall courſe & ſtory of the Bible maketh preaching to be much leſſe profitable vnto them. Now for the latter, to wit, ye vſe of priuat reading for profite after hearing, we haue that memorable example of thoſe worthy gentlemen of Berea, who hearing the Apoſtles preach,Acts 17.11. 
                  and receiuing the word with all readineſſe, ſearched the ſcriptures dayly whether thoſe things were ſo.
               
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  Why, but (may it be ſaid) is not the ſcripture the ground and foundation of all your doctrine; and are you able to ſay more or to ſpeake better then many

both auncient and later learned men, whoſe excellent ſermons are put in print, and whoſe godly treatiſes are extant for the benefite and comfort of Gods people?

                      2. Corinth.
                   we are worthy of Pauls curſe; we know and confeſſe the Bible to be the moſt exact rule, and ſquare, and canon, by which all our ſermons muſt be tried: we acknowledge alſo that holy mē which haue written touching matters of religion, and haue publiſhed their wel labored, & zealouſly deliuered ſermons, haue (many of them) ſet downe the truth of God ſoundly, and bene the meanes of much comfort to well affected people: but yet, though the doctrine be the ſame in ſubſtance, that is read priuately, & which is publikely deliuered, yet the like fruite cannot follow vpon both. If you demaund a reaſon, I can giue no better then that which Chriſt gaue of Gods reuealing thoſe things to babes, which he hid from the wiſe and prudent,Math. 11.26. 
                  Euen ſo it is, becauſe the Lord his good pleaſure is ſuch. When the people of Iſrael were in

their iourney to Canaan, and were fed with bread from heauen: we read that if vpon the week dayes any man had reſerued of the Manna til the morning, it was full of wormes and ſtanke;
                  Exodus 16.20. but being kept the day before the Sabbaoth vntill morning,Verſe 24. 
                  it ſtanke not, neither was there any worme therein. I would faine ſée who could giue me any other reaſon, why the Manna ſhould at the one time corrupt, at the other continue ſwéete, but onely this: God ſhewed his power in preſeruing it at ye one time, becauſe it was his own ordinance for the better ſanctifying the Sabbaoth, and he ſhewed his iuſtice in rotting it at the other time, becauſe he had forbidden it, to teach them to depend vpō his prouidence. After the ſame ſort, one man he taking himſelfe to be a wiſe man, & thinking himſelfe to be as able to draw good matter out of the books of the ſcripture, and other writings, as the beſt Preacher of them all, either contemneth or elſe neglecteth the publike Miniſtery. Another, he in obedience to Gods commaundement,Prouerbs 8.33. 
                  VVatcheth dayly at the gates of the Lords houſe, and giueth attendance at the poſtes of his doores, framing

all his priuate readings and meditations to the fitting of himſelfe for the aſſembly exerciſes. You will aſke me, why ſhould the knowledge of the former rot (as it were) and putrifie, and become nothing worth, he being a man of good capacitie and vnderſtanding, & reading none but ſound authors: and the other thriue in knowledge and in the power of godlines, that yet for all that learneth no other doctrine then he findeth in his good bookes at home? I might happily, but verily for mine owne part I will ſeeke no other anſwer but this: God hath promiſed to bleſſe the latter courſe, ſaying,Prouerbs 2.2.5 
                  If thou cauſe thine eares to hearken vnto wiſedome, and incline thine heart to vnderſtanding; then thou ſhalt vnderſtand the feare of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God. But for the other, becauſe it is a courſe of mans owne deuiſing, ſauouring of inward pride, therefore the Lord turneth it (as hee doeth all humane wiſedome) into fooliſhnes:
                  1. Corinth. 1.20 ſo yt the knowledge ſo gotten (I meane by another by-way, & not by that old trodē path of hearing) either becometh as ye Apoſtle ſpeaketh, vaine iangling, or els if it be ſound,1. Timothy 1

                  There is yet one thing more touching this conceit which men haue, to game more by their owne priuate courſes then by the publike miniſtery, and that is this: men that write, write with great deliberation and aduice; as for you when you preach, you ſpeake many times at aduenture, and nothing ſo iudicially as do thoſe who commit things to writing. Beſides that,
                  1. Timothy 3.6 
                  many of you are but nouices and yong ſchollers, whom S. Paul ſeemeth not ſo well to approue of.

               Alas, a poore excuſe: it is true, if men write as they ought, they write with iudgement and heedfulneſſe: and ſo do they alſo preach with good aduice, who haue learned to feare him, that hath ſaid,Ier. 41 10.

ſweeteſt, and moſt wholeſome doctrine from them both. Now for the youth of many Miniſters, which men (as you ſay) pleade, and ſeeme alſo to ground their conceit vpon the ſcripture: I anſwer: firſt, that it is greatly to be lamented to ſée the ouerforwardneſſe of many young men, who not conſidering the weight of that holy calling, do ſodainly thruſt themſelues into it, and vndertake (as the ſaying is) to teach others,Prim ad docendum, quàm ad diſcendum. before they themſelues are well inſtructed; ſo that I do verily thinke, there are not at this day more nouices and punies of any profeſſion, then there are of the miniſterie. And for the preuenting of this euill, were thoſe decrees of the auncient Councels,Con. Carth 3. c. 4 Cons. Agat. c. 16 Con. Totes. 4. c 17
                   which ſet downe a certaine age, before which a man was not to be admitted to the office of a Miniſter or Biſhop in the Church. Secondly, I adde this withall, that the graces of God are not to be limited to any age. It was a good diſtinction of the Heathen man,Ariſt.

                   Touching the place it ſelfe (that a Biſhop muſt not be a young ſcholler) it muſt not be vnderſtood of a yong man in yeares, but of one lately conuerted to the Chriſtian faith, and newly planted in the Church. Timothy liued in Aſia, and therefore was neceſſarily to furniſh the Church out of Gentiliſme: for this cauſe Paul aduiſeth him to make choiſe of ſuch as were ſetled in the doctrine of Chriſtianitie, and not to aduaunce men to the dignitie of a Biſhop by and by after their conuerſion. So that, howſoeuer I confeſſe that maturitie

of yeares is yet to be reſpected in a Miniſter, becauſe in the ordinary courſe it is accompanied with ripeneſſe of iudgement, yet neither doeth that place of the Apoſtle preſcribe a law for the debarring of young men from the miniſtery, neither doeth any place of ſcripture diſable that age, or make it vncapable of the miniſtery, ſo that it be graced with gifts ſufficient for ſo excellent a function. And this I thinke may be anſwer full enough to this obiection.

                  What exception theſe wiſe men will make againſt this your anſwer, I know not; you haue reſolued me to the full: and concerning yong Miniſters, I heard once an acquaintance of mine, who was brought vp in the Vniuerſitie, ſay, that he knew many ſchollers in his time, that when they were yong and freſh, were of very great hope, and were alſo very zealous, and had a good gift in preaching, who notwithſtanding in time grew cold, and leſſe able for gifts, both of iudgement and zeale, and vtterance to do good in Gods Church: but theſe points I will not mell with, onely your diſcourſe brought that into my mind

which I heard a friend of mine ſay a good while ſince. I muſt craue your iudgement yet a litle further, touching theſe men; beſides al theſe pretended reaſons, they ſtand much vpon two things, which fleſh and bloud doth well approue of: one is, that few of the great men of the world do eſteeme preaching; the other is, that it is not wiſedome for a man in matters of religion to be too forward. What ſay you to this?
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               I ſay, it is a hard matter for thoſe men to come to amendment out of the ſnare of the diuell,
                  2. Timothy 2.26 
                  which are taken of him at his will: and we had néede to beg of that God, who commaunded the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe,
                  7. Corinth. 4.6. that he would ſhine in our hearts, to giue the light of his knowledge: for if a man be once entangled in error, Sathan hath ſo many deuiſes to hold him in, that it is a hard matter for him to get from him: yet if men haue any grace, or wil yeeld to any reaſō, they may ſoone ſée the vanitie of theſe perſwaſions, as I wil briefly declare vnto you. In the former there are two things to be noted: firſt, that if the practiſe of men were a ſufficient rule in matters of Religion,

there are (thankes be to God) many honorable perſonages, many nobles, many gentlemen, many of good note for worldly reſpects, who do vnfainedly reuerence and heartily embrace the preaching of Gods word, and no doubt it is vnto them the ioy▪ and reioycing of their hearts,
                  Ieremy 15 16. and they eſtéeme of it to be euen as it is,Rom. 1.16. 
                  The power of God vnto ſaluation: ſo that if the approbation of men were a reaſon of force, it is not wanting vnto preaching: but as God hath a people out of all, ſo that alſo hath friends and fauourers among all. Secondly, ſuppoſe that this courſe of Preaching were vtterly deſpiſed, and all the great wiſe men of the world did euen ſcorne it, and tread it vnder their feete, yet this were a poore argument, vnleſſe we will ſay, it was a good reaſon which they vſed againſt Chriſt,Iohn 7.48. 
                  Doeth any of the rulers or of the Phariſees beleeue in him? The beſt things haue not commonly the moſt voices, and many times according to the prouerbe,Maior pars vincit meliorem. the greater part is too hard for the better part. There was a voyce put vp for making a golden calfe,Exod. 32. and there was not one

againſt it. There was a voyce, what ſhould be done with Ieſus, and all cryed, Crucifie him. Another was,Mathew 27. whether God ſhould be God,1. King. 1

                  Mathew 26.33 
                  yet will I neuer be offended. Now for that other perſwaſion, that it is not good to be too eager in matters of religion, I know it to be the common perſwaſion of a great many: but yet this is a ſure rule, that that man who thinketh himſelfe to haue knowledge, and zeale, and religion enough, the ſame hath no knowledge, no zeale, no religion at all. For whereſoeuer the graces of God are in truth, there is (in regard of the ſweetneſſe which a man findeth in them) a forgetting that which is behind,
                  Phil. 3.13.

                  Mathew 25.29 
                  euen that he hath ſhall be taken away: but in another of the Goſpels it is ſaid,Luke 8.18. 
                  From him ſhall be taken euen that which it ſeemeth that he hath. So that it is but a conceit and opinion of grace, where there is no deſire to increaſe in grace. It is a good ſaying,Vbi incipis nolle f

And therfore men do but deceiue themſelues, in neglecting the benefit of preaching, vpon a conceit, that it is beſt to keepe a temper in matters of religion, and to content themſelues with a certaine portion of knowledge, and with a ſet meaſure of zeale, and neuer to proceede further; for we muſt deſire the ſincere milke of the word,

or in the zealous profeſſion and practiſe of religion.

                  Now that you ſpeake of being too forward and preciſe in matters of religion, it putteth me in mind of a ſaying of Salomons, which I well vnderſtand not,
                  Eccleſiaſt. 7.18 
                  Be not thou (ſaith he) iuſt ouermuch. It may ſeeme to agree with their opinion, which would not haue men to be too ſtraite, as they call it.

               It is a good rule of the learned,Auguſtine. that for the finding out the true meaning of a place of ſcripture, we muſt conſider what goeth before, and what followeth: this rule obſerued will ſoone cleare this place. In the verſe going before, Salomon had ſpoken of the confuſion (as may ſeeme) which is in the world:Verſe 17. 
                  There is (ſaith he) a iuſt man that periſheth in his iuſtice, and there is a wicked man that continueth long in his malice. Now to repreſſe the raſh headineſſe of mans diſpoſition, which is ready to cenſure Gods courſes at pleaſure, the wiſe man addeth this, Be not thou iuſt ouermuch; that is, Beware thou take not vpon thée, vnder pretence of iuſtice, to charge theſe courſes of Gods prouidence with iniuſtice.

It was an error we know,Pſalme 73. that Dauid by his owne confeſſion had welneare fallen into. And Ieremy the Prophet, craued leaue of God that he might talke with him of his iudgement:
                  Ieremy 12.1. he could hardly at the firſt ſatiſfie himſelfe in it, how God could be iuſt, and yet ſuffer them to be in wealth that rebelliouſly tranſgreſſe. This taxing of Gods procéedings in the gouerning of the world, is (I take it) chiefly forbidden in this precept, Be not iuſt ouermuch: and this to my ſeeming is the meaning of that place: howſoeuer it be taken (as I know ſome otherwiſe interprete it) yet I am ſure it condemneth not that warie and zealous courſe in the practiſe of Religion, which though the world is pleaſed to call ouerholineſſe,Epheſ. 5.15.

The contentment that I haue receiued by your diſcourſe hitherto, maketh me to preſume further vpon you, and to requeſt your patience in hearing, and your skill in reſoluing ſome exceptions made by a fourth ſort of men: laſt in order, but not leaſt in argument, becauſe they are by education learned, and by profeſſion (ſome of them) Miniſters

                  Being then aſſured of your readineſſe, I will tell you what I haue marked partly out of the ſpeeches, partly out of the ſermons of ſome that are reputed learned men: I am no ſcholler, and therfore you muſt not expect any preciſe order at my hands; yet to my ſeeming their exceptions are either againſt preaching it ſelfe,

or againſt the maner of it, as by ſome it is performed.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               Your methode is good enough: But do you know any profeſſing the miniſtery, which do vtterly miſlike and diſallow preaching?
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  I do not ſay ſo: for they who are the moſt eager in this matter, if you fall to reaſoning with them, cannot for ſhame but ſay, that preaching is the moſt ordinary and vſuall meanes which God vſeth to worke by in the hearts of the hearers: and againe, that preaching doeth profite more then reading. And yet for al that, in their ordinarie diſcourſe they make knowne their opinion thus, that the word of God is as effectuall when it is read, as when it is preached, and that reading is preaching.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               Certainly I cannot but maruell, that men of learning and profeſſed Diuines, ſhould vndertake the maintenance of ſuch an opinion, yea though it were but for their credits ſake: for put this caſe, that in ye vacancie of an Eccleſiaſticall preferment, there were ioynt ſuters for it, a man of note & quality, that hath ſpent many yéeres in ſtudy,

and runne through the whole circle of ſciences, and is graced alſo with degrees of ſchooles, the teſtimonie of his deſert: and another, an ordinary fellow, that hath had but reaſonable breeding, and no ſeaſoning but in a countrey ſchoole, and therefore is able to do little perhaps ſaue onely reade faire, and go by his Rubricke: thinke you that your Vniuerſitie ſcholler would not think himſelf greatly wronged, and grow into a maruellous diſcontentment if that other ſhould be preferred before him? yes doubtleſſe: he would renew that old complaint of Salomons, and ſay, Folly is ſet in great excellencie,

Like to theſe, would be the priuy thoughts of a wel deſeruing ſcholler, being diſappointed of

his hoped preferment, by ſo vnworthy a competitor. And for mine owne part, I thinke him to haue very iuſt cauſe ſo to complaine. But yet this being held for a truth, that reading is as effectuall as preaching, and that an ordinary man may doe as much good, ſaue as many ſoules, draw as great a multitude to heauen with his diſtinct reading, as the other with al his vniuerſitie learning and long labored for Diuinitie, ſurely then the ſcholler hath no reaſon to thinke him ſelf wronged in miſſing his preferment: for why ſhould there be a diſparitie in reward, where there is no great precedēce in reſpect of the poſſibilitie to do good in Gods Church? So that I ſay, me thinks if it were for no other cauſe, yet men of learning and Preachers by profeſſion, ſhould neuer go about to equal bare and naked reading vnto preaching.

                  This may perhappes be ſome reaſon in policie; but I hope you haue ſome better proofe then this for the matter: otherwiſe I know what the world will ſay, (euen that which it ſpareth not to ſpeake alreadie) that you Preachers are ſo earneſt in the extolling of preaching, onely for

your owne priuate credites ſake, that you may be the better eſteemed.

               God be thanked, variety of ſufficient proofes is not wanting in this cauſe; but yet this I thought good to obſerue, as it were by the way, to the end that men (who it may be haue a good opinion of their owne well deſeruing) may ſee what an inconuenience is like to follow by the defence of ſuch an opinion.

               Well then (to cut off all preambles and vnneceſſary circumſtances) for this point touching the efficacy of preaching aboue reading, I will ſtand vpon two reaſons chiefly: the one is experience, the other is Gods ordinance, who hath appointed ye abilitie to preach, as a matter of neceſſity in euery one that is called to the miniſtery.
               Experience is ſometimes called the miſtreſſe of fooles, but by it in this point wiſe men may learne a good leſſon: firſt of all, if there be a view taken of all the

places & pariſhes where there hath bene onely reading, and of thoſe which haue bene furniſhed with a ſetled preaching Miniſter,2. Tim. 2.15 whoſe care hath bene to diuide the word of truth aright: the different eſtate of the places wil ſoone make known the worth of preaching aboue reading: for looke into thoſe who haue euer reſted themſelues ſatiſfied with a reading Miniſter, neither ſéeking nor caring for better meanes of inſtruction, and you ſhall find generally wofull ignorance, lamentable blindneſſe in the matters of God, men altogether childrē in vnderſtanding,
                  1. Cor. 14.20. popiſh, ſuperſtitious, heatheniſh, in one word, to ſpeake with the Apoſtle,Epheſ. 4.17.18. 
                  Walking in the vanitie of their mind, hauing their cogitation darkned, and being ſtrangers from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the hardnes of their hearts. This is the generall condition of ſuch places. But looke againe to thoſe,Gal. 6.6. who haue bene taught in the word, & haue made conſcience to profit by the good meanes wherewith God hath bleſſed them, there ſhall you ſee the ſeale of the miniſterie,1.

                   euen the conuerſion of ſoules, comfortable knowledge &

conſcionable cariage, the Lords Saboth ſanctified, his word accounted precious, the ſacraments reuerently vſed, priuate families trained vp in inſtruction and informatiō of the Lord,
                  Epheſ. 6.4. Palem 2. & euen a very church in euery houſe. I know indéede that there are many good people dwelling in pariſhes wanting preaching, and many ignorant and vngodly ones in places well furniſhed with teaching, but yet let theſe circumſtances noted by me be remēbred, of reſting wel enough ſatiſfied with bare reading, and of reioycing in the benefite of an able preacher, & then it wil be found true which I haue ſaid, and be a ſufficient teſtimony of the power of preaching aboue reading. Secondly, whereas the ſcripture is a witnes of the bad opinion which the world will haue of ye miniſtery of the word, aſſuring them that are called to that office, that the faithfull diſcharge of their duty ſhal be rewarded with affliction,
                  2. Tim. 2.3. Iohn 16.33. Iohn 15.19. Mat. 5.11. with hatred, with all maner of euill ſayings; let any man examine his owne obſeruation, and ſée in which of the two, the Reader or the Preacher, this is beſt verified. It is an old ſaying, that by the market folkes you ſhall vnderſtand how

the market goeth. Take me therefore a common man whom you méet by chance & queſtion with him touching the place where he dwelleth, & about his miniſter; if he be but a Reader, you ſhall haue him ſay ſtraite, Truly we haue a good honeſt quiet man, mary indeed he cānot preach, but he liueth peaceably, & medleth with no mā, & is very wel beloued amongſt vs; for why, he is a fellow like man, &c: but put caſe ye miniſter be a painful preacher, one that ſeeketh to draw the people from their godleſſe and ſuperſtitious courſes, to the knowledge of God, then you ſhall heare him in another tune; he wil ſay thē, there we haue a man, ſome ſay he is learned, but ſure I am he hath troubled vs all, a good many of vs wiſh he had neuer come amongſt vs, we were all quiet before, but now all is out of frame, there is ſuch reprouing & finding of fault, & bringing vp of new faſhions & orders, that we know not what to do, ſome of the beſt of our pariſh will do what they can to remoue him: theſe & the like are ye thoughts and ſpeeches of no ſmall many, and the ſame no fooles in the eyes of the world, who do indeed iuſtifie preaching by condemning

it, & ſhew it to be the power of God by reſiſting it. Thirdly, for one other ſpecialty drawn frō experience: I wil appeale vnto mens cōſciēces, whether they be ſuch as feare God or otherwiſe. They which feare God,Iſay 66.2. Pſalme 25.14. & tremble at his words, & do in humility deſire to know the ſecret of the Lord, cānot but acknowledge, that they do much more increaſe both in the knowledge of the truth,

                  which is according to godlineſſe,
                  2. Tim 3.5. & in the power of godlineſſe, do find their iudgements better ſtrengthened, their faith more confirmed, their conſciences more wrought vpon, & their affections more quickened by the word when it is effectually preached & applied, then when it is but only read vnto them. And no maruell, for indeed it cannot be, yt a briefe clauſe of holy ſcripture, wherin in a ſhort tenor of words (ſuch is the riches of the ſacred text) many particulars are compriſed, being onely read, ſhould profit ſo much, as if by preaching it were expounded, and according to occaſions applied vnto Gods people.Cic. de Oras. lib. 1
                   If a mā (ſaith the heathen Orator) come into a wardrobe, where many rich garments are folded vp together in a narrow roome, it

cannot ſo ſatiſfie him, as if ye ſame might ſeuerally be layed forth to his view, time being graunted to take notice of euery particular; becauſe being lapped vp, he cannot ſee the whole beautie, and being together, he is not able to obſerue euery ſpecialty: euen ſo it fareth with the ſcriptures: if a man heare them read, it cannot but draw him to admire the maieſty and riches of them, and it wil caſt ſome glimmering light vpō the vnderſtanding: but when he heareth them laid open by preaching, it will much more aſtoniſh him, it wil euen rauiſh him as it were, caſting a cleerer light vpon his iudgement, & working more mightily vpon his affections. This truth, al which truly feare God are able to iuſtifie out of their own experiēce. Now for others, I know they alſo muſt yéeld to this, that they find ye word being vrged and preſſed by preaching, to be far more powerful, more piercing, more maieſticall, more awaking the conſcience,Heb 4.1
                        •

no diſputing: for it is in vain to go about to perſwade a man that ye thing is not ſo, wt he by obſeruatiō hath ſtil foūd to be ſo.

people: and I confeſſe alſo with him, that by that meanes the iudgment of the people is confirmed in al points of religiō, ſo that thereby they are made able to iudge of the interpretation of the ſcriptures, & of the doctrine taught them by their own teachers or others: all this I willingly acknowledge. And howſoeuer mē are diſpoſed to interpret it, yet yt which is ſpokē in the praiſe of preaching, tendeth rather to the countenancing then to the diſgrace of reading: for he who obſerueth it ſhall find, yt none in priuate examine the ſcripture more carefully, none in publike hear it read more reſpectiuely, then thoſe whō preaching hath taught to ſee ye excellency of Gods word, & the worth of ye ſcripture.

                  You haue done very well to make knowne your iudgement touching the reading of the ſcripture; for the conceit that you think baſely of the word read, is a great preiudice to you in many places, and in many mens opinions.

               The ſecond reaſon which I haue for the maintaining the efficacy of preaching aboue reading, is grounded vpon the abilitie to preach, which the Lord

requireth in euery Miniſter. For this being taken for graunted, that the Lord would both in the riches of his loue, and the depth of his wiſdome ſet downe that courſe which ſhould be moſt for the behoofe of his Church: it muſt néeds follow that if he haue not thought it ſufficient for a Miniſter to be able to reade, but to performe ſome further dutie of inſtructing, then ſurely there is ſomething more in preaching then in reading, and more profite like to folllow by opening the text, then by bare propounding it.

                   and to that ſure word, as S. Peter calleth it; endeuouring by a reuerent kind of examination, to ſearch out the ſecret and hidden meaning of Gods ſpirit. And firſt of all, I will place in the front

as it were of this proofe, that worthy place in the tenth chapter of the Epiſtle to the Romanes, How ſhall they beleeue in him of whom they haue not heard, and how ſhall they heare without a Preacher, and how ſhall they preach except they be ſent? The ſumme of the place is this: that the hearing of a Preacher which is ſent, is the ordinary meanes ordained of God to beget faith. From thence ariſeth another point: that he whoſe miniſtery muſt be the meanes and inſtrument to beget faith, muſt be a man ſent; for How can they preach except they be ſent? onely that man is a preacher, which is ſent. Now if we ſhall examine what it is to be ſent, it will appeare to be true, that a ſufficient miniſter to cal Gods people, muſt be a man of better qualitie then a bare reader of the Scripture. To be ſent therefore is this, to be appointed and deputed of God, and (as the Lord ſpeaketh of Ieremie) ſanctified,
                  Ieremy 1.5. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Rom. 1.1. or (as Paul ſayeth of himſelfe) put apart to that ſeruice. Were it not now a preſumptuous and ouerbold imputation of a certaine diſſolute careleſnes vnto the wiſeſt and moſt prouident God, to ſay or thinke that he

would put any man in his ſeruice,
                  1. Tim. 1.12. Epheſ. 4.12. 
                  for the worke of the miniſtery, vnleſſe the ſame were ſo gifted and qualified, as is méete for the diſcharge of ſo weighty a buſineſſe?Prouer. 26.6. 
                  Salomon ſayth, that He that ſendeth a meſſage by the hand of a foole (that is, of a man vnable to deliuer the tenor of his meſſage, and to open it to him to whom it is ſent) is as he that cutteh off the feete. It is as if he ſhould bid a man go, and yet chop off his feete wherewith he ſhould trauel. A Prince purpoſing an ambaſſage to another Prince, thinketh it not enough that the man whom he wil employ in that ſeruice, be able to cary his errand written in a paper, and faithfully to deliuer it according to directions (for that euery ordinary Currer and common Poſt may do) but he maketh choiſe of one that hath had the beſt bréeding, a man of good vnderſtanding, of good diſcourſe, of good behauior, and of no leſſe diſcretion, who is in theſe reſpects able to debate and manage thoſe great affaires, as may be moſt for the behoofe and honorable aduantage of him that ſendeth him. Shall we thinke God to be leſſe carefull for the buſineſſe of his

church, then earthly Princes be for their State cauſes? Shall a man of the beſt qualitie be ſought out for the carying of a meſſage from one man to another? and ſhall one of the meaneſt ſufficiency haue the miniſtery of reconciliation betwixt God and man giuen vnto him?
                  2. Cor 5.18. God forbid. Let all theſe things then be put together: Firſt, that he whoſe miniſtery ſhall be the means to breed faith, is a man ſent, which the text auoucheth. Secondly, that to be ſent, is to be gifted in that meaſure, as is agréeing to the waight of ſo great a calling, which cōmō ſenſe will not ſuffer vs to deny. Thirdly, that to be able only to reade ye ſcripture, is a common gift, and a facultie of no great note, which euery man wel knoweth. Let theſe things I ſay be put together,Eccleſ. 4.12. and you ſhall find them as a threefold cord, not eaſily broken, building vp and ſtrengthening this truth, that the man not graced with any more then the power to reade, is not the Miniſter appointed by God for the working of faith in the hearts of his people. Againe, to preſſe this place yet further, this is the conſtant doctrine of the ſcripture, that

no Miniſter can haue comfort in the day of the Lord, but onely he who is able to ſay with Ieremie,
                  Ieremy. 17.16. 
                  I haue not thruſt my ſelf in for a Paſtor. For wo ſhall be vnto thoſe of whom the Lord ſhall ſay,Ieremy 23.21. 
                  I haue not ſent theſe Prophets, yet they ran. So that it ſtandeth euery man vpon, who deſireth that worthy worke,
                  1. Timothy. 3.1. 
                  the office of an ouerſeer in Gods Church, to be wel aſſured of his calling, leaſt in the day of ſuruey it be ſaid vnto him as was ſaid vnto the gueſt without the wedding garmēt, Friend how cameſt thou hither?
                  Mathew 22.12 Or as to the wicked in the Pſalm,Pſalme 50.16. 
                  What haſt thou to do to declare mine ordinances, that thou ſhouldeſt take my couenant in thy mouth? Now, by what meanes can a man know himſelfe to be ſent and called of God to the ſeruice of his church? there is no reuelation to be looked for, neither is it to be expected that God ſhould call by ſome immediate voyce, as he did yt Prophets, or as he did Paul:
                  Acts 9. & yet there is a meanes and courſe as certaine herein, as if the Lord ſhould ſay directly by a voyce ſounding in our eares, Go, behold haue not I ſent thee? It is in this matter, as it is in that of election. A man that is carefull

(according to the rule of the holy Ghoſt) to make his calling and election ſure,
                  2 Pet. 1.10. muſt not preſume to ſearch the vnſearchable counſels of God, neither yet waite for ſome ſpeciall intelligence from heauen, but he muſt enter into his owne heart, and riſe vp by degrees from the fruites of ſanctification to his being iuſtified, from iuſtification to his effectual calling, from thence to election, and from all theſe conclude eternall glorificatiō in Gods kingdome: this is a ſure courſe, to be led by the ſtreames vp to the well head. Not much vnlike is the courſe in iudging of a mans calling to the miniſtery. I may in ſome ſort apply the ſpéech of Paul in another caſe to this purpoſe:Rom. 10.6. 
                  Say not thou that affecteſt the miniſtery, who ſhall aſcend vp into heauen, to aſſure mée what is Gods purpoſe touching mée: for there is another way, The teſtimonie of thy being ſent (if thou art ſent) is neare thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thy heart. Inquiry muſt be made by a man in this behalfe,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 2 Corinth. 3.6. in what meaſure God hath fitted him to be a miniſter of the new Teſtament. Now may a man with a ſafe conſcience, or

with any good ground make himſelfe beléeue that God hath ſent him, and called him to the miniſtery, becauſe he is able to reade diſtinctly the text of holy ſcripture? Can this one facultie be a ſufficient teſtimonie to a mans owne ſoule, that he is one of the appointed labourers for Gods harueſt?
                  Mat 9.33. Shall a man aduenture to vndertake the cure and care of ſoules vppon ſo ſlender preparation? Surely (for as much as I can conceiue) the doctrine of the Scripture, deſcribing the office of a Miniſter, is againſt it. This vſe I haue made of this place: the ſumme is this: the ordinary meanes to beget faith, is the hearing of a Preacher ſent, that is, ſo furniſhed with gifts ſutable to his calling, that both in reſpect of the tenor of his meſſage, and his abilitie,

                  Rom. 10.15. his very feete may deſerue to be called Beautifull: but neither is bare reading to be numbred among thoſe gifts which might argue a man to be ſent, neither is it ſafe for any man to aduenture vpon no better ſufficiencie. Therefore there is more required in him who muſt be heard for

the breeding of faith, then the naked facultie of deliuering to the people out of a booke the letter of the Scripture.

                  But by your leaue ſir, that which you ſpeake touching ſending, I feare me how it will be well taken: for hath not the Church the power of ſending and calling to the Miniſtery? If then a man able onely to reade the ſcripture, be by the Church appointed to that office, is not that a ſuffient warrant to him in this caſe?
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               The calling by the Church, I acknowledge to be ſo neceſſary, that without it (a ſetled forme of Church gouernement being eſtabliſhed) no man is to be reputed a lawfull Miniſter, though he be otherwiſe of neuer ſo great ſufficiencie. God I know calleth men extraordinarily ſometimes, as namely, in the firſt founding & planting of the Church: ſo were the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts called: and when the Church of God is defaced, & an vniuerſall Apoſtaſie ſpread ouer it; ſo it is thought they were called who reſtored the ſinceritie of religion, after the long night of Popery. But this extraordinary kind of calling neuer taketh

place but when ordinary calling faileth. Now though the calling and allowance of the Church is neceſſary, yet it is not ſufficient to the being of a miniſter. The office of the Church is onely to approue, it is God that maketh a miniſter. And therefore the Church is tied to a law,1. Timoth. 5 22 1. Timoth. 3.10. to lay hands ſodainly vpon no man, but to proue firſt, and to vſe a very preciſe examinatiō before they ſeparate any mā to the office of a miniſter. The Churches duty is to ſearch out what men the Lord hath choſen,
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Act. 1.25. 
                  to take a part in the miniſtration. I know there may be an error committed herein, and men in their choiſes and elections may be deceiued. It fareth many times with the gouernors of the Church, as it did with Ioab in the campe. When Abſolom was ſlain,2. Sam. 18. & the army of thoſe which ioyned with him in the conſpiracie was ouerthrowne, Ioab was purpoſed by a meſſenger to informe Dauid of the ſucceſſe of the battel: hereupon one Ahimaaz offered himſelfe to be the carier of tidings: Ioab put him backe, taking another, one Cuſhi to be the fitter for that ſeruice. Ahimaaz notwithſtanding continued to importune Ioab, What

(I pray thee) if I run alſo after Cuſhi? And againe, Yet what if I runne? and neuer left vntil he had obtained licence to run alſo. Hauing gotten this leaue to run, he ran by the way of the plaine and ouer-went Cuſhi, and came firſt to Dauid, and made wiſe, as if he could haue told great tidings. But when the King came to particulars, then he was ſilent, I ſaw a great tumult, but I knew not what. The caſe ſo ſtandeth many times in the church.
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Heb. 13.7. The ſpiritual Ioabs, the leaders of Gods people, intend perhaps to ſend none but Cuſhies, men of whoſe faithfulneſſe and ſufficiencie they haue good experience: but yet happely ſome Ahimaaz or other, ſome that might well ſtay to beare tidings another time, ſteppeth in and putteth forward himſelfe, and by importunitie purchaſeth that which otherwiſe deſert could not obtaine, and ſo runneth by the way of the plaine (that common and too much troden path of Symony) and ouergoeth the worthier; and being firſt come into the face of Gods Church, ſéemeth to be able to bring out of his treaſure,
                  Mathew 13.52. 
                  things both old and new. But if you grow with him into particulars, you ſhall find him

like the gueſt in the Goſpel,Mathew 22.12. euen ſpeechleſſe, ſo that he muſt be fain to ſtand aſide till Cuſhi cometh to reſolue you. Thus I ſay an error may happen, and an ouerſight may be committed euen by the beſt Ouerſeers. But when this negligence becommeth a cuſtome, and it waxeth an ordinary matter,1. Kings. 13.33. to make of the loweſt of the people Prieſts of the high places, ſo that in a maner who will may conſecrate himſelfe, then a man may well crie with Dauid, It is time for thee Lord to worke: Ariſe,

                  O God, and lift vp thine hand. And how feareful a thing it is, for thoſe which willingly ſuffer it, may appeare by an example not much vnlike.1. Sam. 16. God ſent Samuel to annoint one of Iſhai his ſons, to be King ouer Iſrael: Samuel ſéeing Eliab, becauſe of his countenance & the height of his ſtature, ſaid, Surely the Lords annointed is before him. The like conceipt had he of the reſt of his brethren: but yet he receiued ſtill a ſecret information, The Lord hath choſen none of theſe. Put caſe that Samuel notwithſtāding this direction giuen him, had tooke the horne of oile and annointed ſome other beſide Dauid, had it not bene great contempt to haue

proceeded contrary to commaund? So in this caſe, they to whom the office and functiō of laying on of hands belongeth in Gods Church, when the Lord ſhall ſay expreſſely in his word, I haue not choſen this man, he is not gifted for this weightie buſineſſe: if they for all that ſhall giue the outward allowance of a Miniſter to him, whom in their certaine knowledge God hath not graced with gifts ſufficiēt for the calling of a Miniſter, what puniſhment in all likelihood ths raſhneſſe is liable vnto, I leaue it to euery mans conſcience that feareth God to examine. And I pray God giue them whom it concerneth hearts to conſider it.

                  I ioyne with you in your good deſire: and yet perhaps men of place may pleade a kind of neceſſitie, to admit men of no better ſufficiencie, there being not that ſtore of learned men and Preachers, to furniſh euery ſeuerall congregation.

               What is to be borne withall in caſes of ineuitable neceſſity is one thing, & what is to be permitted when the good means is not wanting is another thing: for this our land, firſt I think there was neuer any trial taken, whether the number

of learned men were proportionable to the tale of ſeuerall pariſhes: Secondly the Vniuerſities are like to the market place, in which ſtand many of good quality,Mathew 20 6, 7 of whom if you demaund Why ſtand ye here? they wil anſwer, Becauſe no man hath hired vs. And the ſeuerall colledges, be (as it is ſaid of the téeth of the ſpouſe) like a flock of ſheepe in good order,

                  which go vp from the waſhing, which euery one being out twins, and none is barren among them.
                  Epheſ. 4.8. Thirdly, the ſcripture telleth vs, that Chriſt aſcended vp on high to giue gifts vnto men: why then ſhould we think his hand ſo ſhortned, as that it ſhould be déemed vnpoſſible to furniſh this whole Church with preaching Miniſters? Fourthly, if that be true which ſome ſay, that there are more learned men in England then in all the reformed Churches of Europe beſides, then there is no cauſe to plead any ſuch neceſſitie. And therfore I account that as a colour rather then any argument.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  I feare me ſir, I haue too much interrupted you: I pray you therefore proceed in your proof of this point, that there is a neceſſitie layed vpon euery Miniſter

that ſhall vndertake the cure of ſoules, to be able to do more then barely to reade the holy ſcriptures vnto the people.

               The next reaſon which I haue to ſtrengthen this principle, is grounded vpon this, becauſe I find by the ſcripture that it is a matter of very great difficultie to be a good Miniſter. There are two things principally required in a miniſter: the one, that he be able to exhort with wholeſome doctrine: the other,Tit. 2.9. that he haue ſkill to improue them that ſay againſt it. Whereto agreeth that ſaying of Auguſtine,

teacher in Gods Church, if he ſhall build ſo weakely that thoſe foxes,Canticles 2 15. thoſe little foxes (of whom the ſpouſe complaineth) ſhall be able by & by to breake downe the building. Well then, let any man conſider either of theſe two, and tell me whether it be not a matter of very great difficulty in any good meaſure to performe it.Iſay 50.4. The Prophet I ſay ſayth, that the Lord had giuen him a tongue of the learned, for ye one péece of ſeruice, that he might know to miniſter a word in time to him that is wearie: and yet this is but one branch of a Miniſters office. If we ſhall adde to it other particulars, ſuch as are wiſedome in admoniſhing, courage in reprouing, ſoundneſſe in opening the treaſure of the holy text, diſcretiō in applying according to times & perſons, with the like, which are required of euery Miniſter in his place: then we cannot but yeeld, that he had néed to be able to do ſomething more then reade,1. Timoth 3.15. who ſhall ſeek to behaue him ſelf in the houſe of God as he ought to do. Now for that other part,Titus. 1.10.11. which ſtandeth in ſtopping the mouthes of vaine talkers and deceiuers of mens minds, which oppoſe them ſelues againſt Gods truth:

For the multitude, this is a cleare caſe, that whereas euery former age hath brought forth ſome one or moe, to the diſturbance of the peace of Gods Church, and to the exerciſing of the beſt learned that each time could affoord, all theſe are flowne together into this laſt age as into a common ſewer. So that there is not any error which the former times knew, and withall condemned to the pit of hell, but this our age hath raked it vp againe, and ſet (as it were) a new gloſſe vpon it, and made it by addition much more dangerous. Beſides, we haue Popery, which is a fardle of hereſies, and the very compound of all the reſt. Now for the quality of thoſe which are the patrons thereof, (of Popery eſpecially) it is well knowne that though they haue among them, as it was ſaid of old, many woodden prieſts,Lignes Sacerdotes. Boniface.
                   all whoſe learning hangeth at their girdle in their Portuis, yet they which in

theſe our times haue put forth themſelues to ſupport the drouping and decaying kingdome of Antichriſt, are no punies, but many of them men of excellent wits, deepe learning, and vnwearied induſtry: by their writings, and bookes, and diſputations, making good the ſaying of our Sauior Chriſt,Luke 16.8. 
                  The children of this world are in their generation wiſer then the children of light. Now then to diſcouer the force of my intended reaſon, I draw it to theſe heads: firſt, I know that whoſoeuer ſhould vndertake out of the ſcripture to deſcribe the office of a Paſtor, he cannot without a palpable betraying of the truth leaue out theſe two things which I haue named, the ability to teach the obedient childrē of the Church, and the ſkill to oppoſe himſelfe againſt the enemies of the Church. Secondly, this I know alſo, that he that ſhall either by diſcourſe examine, or by perſonall eperience try the difficulty of well performing theſe duties, will ſay with S. Paul,

                  VVho is ſufficient for theſe things? and acknowledge with Bernard, that the miniſtery is a burden, which the Angels themſelues may wel tremble at.

Thirdly, I am as cléere in this, as in any of the two former, that there is no ſuch difficulty in the faculty of reading, which as it is the firſt ſtep to learning, ſo it is of all other things incident to a ſcholler the moſt eaſie. So that, ſeeing to hold opinion, that an onely reading Miniſter is a ſufficient Miniſter, maketh that calling of all other the moſt eaſie, which in it own nature, as it is deſcribed to vs in the ſcripture, is moſt laborious, requiring ſo ſtudious preparation to it, and ſo great intention & diligence in the performance of it, I muſt needes ſettle my ſelfe vpon this point, & perſwade others alſo to it, that there is more required in a miniſter of the new Teſtament, then to reade the ſcripture, though I ſtill hold that a part of his duty, and (as I haue ſayd before) a matter very behouefull for the ſpirituall benefite of Gods Church.

                  I could eaſily agree to that which you haue ſaid, onely this doubt ſomething ſtayeth me: if you hold no man a full Miniſter, except the ſame be able to preach, what ſhall we think then of the ſacraments adminiſtred by ſuch; how can they be true ſacraments if ſuch be no true Miniſters?

                  For anſwer to that doubt, firſt this is a true and a receiued rule, that a ſacrament is not to be eſtéemed by the hand of him which adminiſtreth it: neither doeth the dignitie of the deliuerer, adde worth to the ſacrament, nor the indignity leſſen the true nature of it. Secondly, he which hath an outward calling by the Church, though happely he be vnworthy and vnméet for the place whereto he is called, yet he is to be reputed as more then a priuate man: and therefore becauſe by the appointment of the Church he ſtandeth in the roome of a right and lawfull Miniſter, if there be no fault in the ſubſtance of the action of adminiſtring, the ſacraments are true ſacraments, though the party executing that office be not altogether ſo allowable. The Scribes and Phariſées, who were the Doctors of the Iewes, many of them were of other Tribes then of the tribe of Leui, and crept in by corruption and bribery into thoſe places, and were of vnſound iudgement in many things, as many eaſily be gathered by the ſtory of the Goſpell; yet our Sauior willed his Diſciples to heare them, becauſe they

ſate in Moſes chaire.
                  Mathew 23.2.3 Their entrance was naught, yet their miniſtery was to be eſteemed, ſo long as they failed not in the ſubſtance thereof. And this (I thinke) may reſolue you for that matter.
            
            
               Nymphas.
               
                  I will reſt ſatisfied with this anſwer, til I ſhal find either by mine owne priuate meditation, or by conference with others (better skilled in theſe points then I) what further to reply. I deſire to heare you yet further in this matter, touching the neceſſitie of preaching in a Miniſter.

               I am very willing to procéed, onely I would haue you to remember what I ſayd at my firſt entrance into this matter, namely, that I would ſtand onely vpon proofes of Scripture. S. Auguſtine ſayth,
                     Epiſt. 263. that that was the auncient order of diſputing, to haue the bookes of holy ſcripture by, and to ſtand to the triall thereof. And therefore it was an excellent & memorable courſe of Conſtantine the Emperor,Theodor.

                   who commaunded the Fathers met together in the Councell of Nice, to refer that great controuerſie then in hand, touching the Godhead of Chriſt, to the deciſion of the Scripture. And it is Gods owne voyce

that we ſhould to the law,

                  and to the teſtimonie. Wherefore wiſhing you to looke for no proofes from me, but ſuch as are fetched out of the ſcripture, I ſet this downe as my third reaſon, that whereas the Lord made very good prouiſion for the maintenance of thoſe who were to miniſter about holy things, I find not either in the old or new Teſtament that any were prouided for by ſuch allowāce, but onely ſuch as were able to inſtruct the people by opening and expounding the law. The office of the Leuites in the old law,Deuter 33 
                        •
                     0. ſtood vpon two things, one was to put incenſe before the Lords face, and the burnt offering vpon his altar; therein they were the peoples mouth vnto God: the other was to teach Iaakob Gods iudgement, and Iſrael his law: in that they were Gods mouth vnto the people: for this cauſe it was the ordinance of God (according as I noted to you the place in the beginning of this conference) that the Prieſtslips ſhould preſerue knowledge,
                  Mal. 2.7 
                  and they ſhould ſeek the law at his mouth: for (ſayth the text) he is the meſſenger of the Lord of hoaſts: that is, one appointed to be the opener and declarer of the will

of God among the people. And leſt any man ſhould thinke, that the law which the people were to ſeeke at the Prieſtes mouth, was nothing but the bare letter and written text of the law, we may remember firſt, that the people had the frée vſe of the law in their priuat houſes,Deuteron. 6.7. ſo that they had no ſuch neede to ſeeke that at the Prieſts hands. Secondly, that it was the vſe of the Leuites when they did reade in the booke of the law, to giue the ſenſe alſo, and to cauſe the people to vnderſtand the reading.
                  Nehemiah 8.8. And hence it was, that when our Sauior Chriſt ſtood vp to reade on the Sabbaoth day,
                  Luke 4 16. &c. (according to his office,Su
                        •

                        .
                   as ſome thinke that he was choſen one of the odinary two and twenty Prieſts of the Temple) when he had cloſed the booke, the eyes of all that were in the ſynagogue were faſtened on him; becauſe it was the order that preſently vpon the reading of the law, followed the expoſition of the law. Thence alſo was it that Paul & Barnabas being at Antioch vpon a Sabbaoth day, After the Lecture of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the ſynagogue ſent vnto them, to intreate them,Acts 13.15. that if they had

any word of exhortation, they would be pleaſed to deliuer it. This their requeſt aroſe vpon the cuſtome of ioyning ſtill the opening and interpreting of the law with the publike reading thereof; whereto agréeth that ſaying of Iames that Moſes was of old time in euery citie,
                  Acts 15.21. 
                  both read and preached euery Saboth day. Thirdly, this may be noted alſo, that whereas the Lord threatned to refuſe them,
                  Hoſ. 4.6 
                  that they ſhould be no prieſts to him, who had refuſed knowledge: by that refuſing of knowledge is to be vnderſtood both their ignorance in the doctrine of the law, and their negligence to informe the people in it: otherwiſe to thinke that there was nothing reproued in them more, then an vnabilitie to reade the law, were a very groſſe conceit. And thus much to proue that for the times of the old teſtament, none had the allowance of Prieſts, but ſuch as were able to inſtruct. Now for the times of the Goſpell, S. Paul thus declareth the continuance of the equitie of that auncient law, that like as of old, They which did miniſter about the holy things, did eate of the things of the Temple, and they which did waite at the altar,

were partakers of the altar: ſo alſo it is ordained by the Lord,1. Cor. 9.13.24. 
                  that they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould liue of the Goſpell: none haue any right to liue of the Goſpell, that is, of the exhibition and ſalary of the Church, but thoſe which preach the Goſpell. If you demand of me what it is to preach the Goſpell, Paul ſhall reſolue you in another place; namely it is this,1. Timot. 5.17. to labour in the word and doctrine: which whether it be not more then to reade the word, I refer it to any mans iudgement. Chryſoſtome ſayth, that theſe words require of a Miniſter,Vt pradicit, doceat & concionetur. that he do preach, and teach, and make ſermons: and the old rule of the law, which Paule applieth to the purpoſe, requireth ſo much, Thou ſhal not muzzle the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne. The oxe that is allowed to eate of the corne, is not he onely which treadeth vpon the corne, but which treadeth it out, that worketh it out of the huſkes, that it may be fit for mans vſe. So he is to eate of the maintenance of the church who is able to ſet the word of God (the ſpirituall foode) before the people, not only in the eare (as it were) in the words

and letter of the ſcripture, but in the true ſenſe and interpretation of it. It is an excellent ſaying of S. Hierome,

So then, he is a Teacher allowed to liue vpon the common charge, which treadeth out (as I may ſo ſpeake, alluding to the ſimilitude of the oxe) the ſenſe of the ſcripture out of the letter of the ſcripture; and ſtayeth not (as Hierome ſpeaketh in the fore-remembred place) in the leaues of words,Jn ſer

                   Touching the Scriptures, God forbid but we ſhould acknowledge that they are both in their owne nature light, and ſuch alſo, which by the beames thereof do giue light vnto the eyes. And it is true which S. Auſtine ſayth, that all matters neceſſary to faith and manners, are to be found in thoſe things which are ſet downe plainely in the Scripture: and therefore, we do both exhort to the reading of the ſcriptures priuately, and commend the publike rehearſing of them in the congregation. Yet this is no whit contrary to the opinion touching the neceſſitie of preaching. And ſo much ſhall euidently appeare, if we marſhall our hearers into three companies. The firſt

ſort are groſſely ignorant, and extremely negligent in the matters of God. The ſecond are of ſome better both care to looke into the ſcriptures, and capacitie to conceiue them. The third are as well able to ſound out the truth by the priuat ſtudy of the ſcripture, as thoſe who be profeſſed Diuines. There is no hearer (I meane among our people profeſſing the preſent Religion) but he belongeth to one of theſe thrée rankes. Now for the former of theſe, preaching cannot but be moſt neceſſary: for as in their negligence of themſelues they will neuer ſeeke for knowledge, but it muſt euen in a kind of violence be put vpon them, ſo in their ignorance the plaine text read wil profit them nothing, vnleſſe with it be ioyned the ſkilfull induſtry of ſome painefull workman,

                  2. Pet. 1.8. and to be idle and vnfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. It is an excellent ſaying of the Apoſtle Paul writing to the Romanes, and well fitting this purpoſe:Rom. 15.14.15. 
                  I my ſelfe (ſaith he) am perſwaded of you my brethren that ye are alſo full of goodnes, and filled with all knowlege, and are able to admoniſh one another: what greater cōmendation could be? theſe men might ſeem not to néed any further inſtruction: but marke what followeth, Neuertheleſſe brethren, I haue ſomewhat boldly after a ſort written vnto you, as one that putteth you in remembrance, through the grace that is giuen me of God.

                   vnto him. Theophilus was wel inſtructed in ye myſtery of Chriſt, yet Lukes Goſpell was néedfull for him,Luke 1.4. 
                  that he might acknowledge the certaintie of thoſe things. Preaching is not ſuperfluous, though a

man were neuer ſo cunning. This briefe view of the ſtate of our ſeuerall hearers, may ſerue to make this good, that to vrge the neceſſitie of preaching as the meanes to beget faith, is no derogation to that doctrine which we hold, touching the brightnes and plainnes of the ſcripture.2. Pet. 1.19. The ſcripture is as a light ſhining in a dark place, but neither do all looke into it, neither can al that heare it read publikly conceiue it, vnleſſe they be prepared to it by ſome former familiar inſtructiōs, neither do al that peruſe the booke of God, ſo fully vnderſtand all that they neede no teacher, neither yet can any man though of neuer ſo good parts, attaine to that fulnes, as that he ſhal not (at the leaſt) ſtand in néed of an admoniſher. It is a good obſeruation (in my iudgement) of him,Wolph. in N cap. 8.

                  candleſtick,
                  Mat. 5.15. of which Chriſt ſpeaketh, by which ye word of God giueth light vnto all that are in the houſe. And indéede this ſimilitude may haue ye better approbatiō,Reue

                   if we note how by the candleſticke which the Lord Ieſus threatneth to remoue out of the church of Epheſus, is meant eſpecially ye miniſtery

of ye word. God doth all things by means (ordinarily).Iohn 1.9. Luke 1.79. Chriſt is the true light, which giueth light to them that ſit in darknes, yet the faithful Miniſters of ſeuerall congregations are ſaid to be ſtaires in his right hand,
                  Reuel. 1.16 10. by which he giueth light vnto his church. If this be true, I ſee not what inconuenience can follow vpon it, if we ſay,Pſalme 119.105 though the word be a lanterne, yet it then giueth beſt, & cléereſt, & fulleſt light when it is lifted vp as it were, and the brightnes thereof cauſed to ſpread forth into euery corner, by the ſkill and paines of a ſufficient Miniſter.

                  Another exception vſed by ſome, whoſe endeuour is to equall (if not to preferre) bare reading vnto preaching, is, that there is more certaintie in the word read, then in that which you preach: that which is read, men are ſure is Gods word, but they haue not the like aſſurance of that which is preached.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               If you deſire a ſhort & direct anſwer to this exception, take it thus, This allegation touching the certainty of tho word read aboue the doctrine preached, is not true. There are in our congregations thrée ſorts of people eſpecially: firſt,

ignorant perſons: ſecondly, cauillers: and laſtly, iudiciall and carefull hearers. The ignorant are as vncertaine touching that which we call the ſcripture, whether it be be the word of God, as they be touching our preaching: they haue no aſſurance of it, but tradition and report, which is a poore certainty, & they haue as good an opinion of the Apocripha books, as of the other which we call canonical. Beſides that, it is buzzed into many of our common peoples eares, by whiſpering Papiſts, & it is thereby become ordinary in many mouthes here in ye country that our Bible is no true Bible, and that our tranſlation is iuſtly to be doubted of. Secondly, thoſe that are poſſeſſed with a humor of cauilling, may as wel demand how they know the ſcripture to be ſcripture, & thoſe things to be true which are writtē in it, as how they may be reſolued that our preaching is the truth. Thirdly, your beſt hearers, which heare as Chriſt ſayth with a good and an honeſt heart,
                  Luke. 8.15. to them the certainety of the truth in the written text and in the ſermon is both alike: for as they haue a certaine ſecret teaching by the ſpirit of God (which

                  S. Iohn calleth by ye name of an ointment from him that is holy) whereby they are perſwaded of the truth of the ſcripture,1. Iohn 2.20. and do account it the oracle of God,

So thē there is no more certainty of the text, then of the doctrine preached out of ye text. Thoſe which are ignorant, or diſpoſe to cauill, are doubtful of both alike: for the one are blockiſh & know nothing, the other are humorous and will be ſatiſfied with nothing. Again, thoſe which are Gods children, are alike aſſured of both: of the text by the ſecret perſwaſion of Gods ſpirit: of the doctrine, by triall taken of it by the text.Epiſt. 62. ad Theophi

                   but the words of God. It is a good rule of the learned, that thoſe points which are collected out of the ſcripture, are of like authority with thoſe which are directly writtē in it. Whē 
                  Paul being at Theſſalonica went into the ſynagogue of the Iewes, and diſputed with them by the ſcriptures, I hope no man wil ſay, but that thoſe things which he by argument & diſcourſe drew out of the writtē word, were of equal authority

with points expreſly mentioned. Paul pleading before Agrippa, ſtood ſtiffely to the iuſtifying of his doctrine,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Acts 26.22. becauſe he had ſaid no other things but thoſe which the Prophets & Moſes did ſay ſhold come. His doctrine was the ſame with the doctrine of Moſes and the Prophets, yet not in words, but in ſenſe and ſubſtance. And the ſame Apoſtle is not afraid to call his preaching The counſell of God,
                  Acts 20.27. though it were in regard of the tenor and courſe of ſpeech, differing from the expreſſe letter of the text. If it ſhall be ſaid vnto me, that there is a difference betwixt our ſermons and Pauls, I willingly confeſſe it; but yet I ſay, that euen Pauls ſermons were ſubiect to the like triall that ours be, as appeareth by the practiſe of the Noblemen of Beraea.
                  Acts 17.11. And therefore as his preaching was not to be eſtéemed as the word of God, till triall, and being tried was equally to be reuerenced as the written word it ſelfe: ſo neither are our ſermons to be by and by credited vpon our bare word, but to be thoroughly examined; but being once found to hold at the touch-ſtone, then they are ſo to be reputed Gods word,

that it may be ſafely ſaid,1. Theſſ 4.

                  As far as I can coniecture, your anſwer is this: that when that courſe of due triall (which is meete) is taken, touching things taught by preaching, then the ſcripture being found to giue allowance to thē, there is as great aſſurance of the authoritie of the one as of the other; and that is as much to be accounted the word of God, which the ſcripture warranteth, as that which by name in ſo many words it expreſſeth.

men come to be better aſſured of the authoritie of the ſcripture: for, the better they vnderſtand it, the more comfort they find in it, and the more they feele the power and working of it, (all which, by the bleſſing of God are the effects of preaching) the more are they aſſured that the ſcripture is the very thing which it is ſaid to be,Pſal. 19 7.8. Pſal. 119.103. euen a perfect, pure and ſweete doctrine, conuerting the ſoule, reioycing the heart,

What ſhall it auaile men to cary a kind of conceipt of ſome diuine authoritie to be in the Scripture, ſo long as they are ignorant of the myſterie of it, and without any apprehenſion or taſt of the comfort which is intended in it?Rom 15.4.
               
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  I am ſory that I am conſtrained to make you tary ſo long in this matter, and that ſo much the rather, becauſe there are many other things yet behind, wherein I am as deſirous of your helpe as in theſe already handled: yet becauſe I haue this good oportunitie, and do find you alſo ſo willing to inſtruct me, I will yet further acquaint

you with one other allegatiō, which being anſwered, I ſhall (I thinke) be well prouided, both to ſatisfie thoſe of my acquaintance which ſhall perhaps ſeeke help from me, and alſo to ſay ſomething to thoſe who with their quirkes and ſhewes of reaſons, thinke to put downe ſuch plaine men as I am when we come into their companie. I named it to you before (though happely by length of communication it is ſlipped from you) and it is this, That euen reading it ſelfe is preaching: and that they ſeeke to proue by thoſe reaſons: firſt, they ſay, to preach is nothing but to publiſh the Goſpell, and that is done by reading: ſecondly, in hearing the ſcriptures read, we heare the ſermons of the Prophets, of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles, which paſſe all other ſermons which any man now can make. Thirdly, there is (they ſay) euen in reading that which we ſo much commend preaching for, namely expounding and applying; for the new Teſtament is the expounder of the old, and the Epiſtles of Paul and Peter and the reſt do apply both vnto mens conſciences. Thus, though in our common ſpeech we account

reading to be one thing, and preaching to be another, yet by theſe deuiſes we are many times ſhrewdly puzled, and know not ſodainly what to anſwer.

               Theſe reaſons, what ſhew ſoeuer they may make at the firſt view, yet are they neuer able to proue that for which they are alleaged, as ſhall (God willing) appeare in the ſeuerall examination of them. Firſt, for that which is ſaid, that preaching is nothing but a publiſhing of the Goſpell, I yéeld vnto it, if it be well and rightly vnderſtood: and when it is ſo vnderſtood as it ought to be, then it will appeare that the reading of the bare context, cannot properly be tearmed preaching. I find in the new Teſtament foure words eſpecially to be vſed, when preaching ſo farre forth as it is incident to the office of an ordinary Paſtor in Gods Church is mentioned. The firſt ſignifieth,1.

And theſe kinds of words, do fitly ſet forth the duty of a Preacher, which is eſpecially that, which Paul exhorteth the Epheſians to begge of God on his behalfe, to wit,Ephe. 6.19.

                     . 
                  To make knowne the ſecret of the Goſpell, which (ſeeing it muſt be ſought for as ſiluer,
                  Prou 2.4. 
                  and ſearched for as for treaſure) is not ordinarily to be looked for in the vpper face as it were, but to be with paines and induſtrie digged out of the very bowels and heart of the Scripture. The fourth word ſignifieth to publiſh,
                  2 Tim 4.2 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . and as an herald or a crier, to deliuer a matter in open place, in the hearing of a multitude, that many may take notice of it. For this cauſe the Prophet Iſaiah was willed to Crie aloude,
                  Iſa. 58.2. and to Lift vp his voice like a trumpet;
                  
and Ieremiah was commaunded to ſtand in the gate of the Lords houſe,
                  Ier. 7.2. 
                  and to crie the word there. And hence alſo it is, that the wiſdome of God,Pro. 8.2.4.5.11.9.4. is ſaid to ſtand in the top of the high places, and to make as it were a publike proclamation: O men! ô ye fooliſh! who ſo is ſimple let him come hither.
                  Iſa. 55.1. Mat. 11.28. 
                  Ho, euery one that thirſteth: come vnto me al ye that are wearie, &c. By this it may appeare what it is to Preach, and in what ſenſe Preaching may be tolerably defined to be a publiſhing of the Goſpell:What preaching is. namely, it is an open and comfortable diſcouerie by word of mouth, making plaine vnto the people of God, the myſterie of godlineſſe, euen the ſecret of the Goſpell. Now, as no man duly conſidering the nature and vſe of the forenamed words, can denie Preaching (by a Miniſter lawfully called) to be euen ſuch a kind of publiſhing the Goſpell, as is now ſet downe: ſo neither can he with any face or colour affirme, the action of reading the Scripture to be anſwerable to this deſcription. So that though it be granted, that the text of Scripture is the Goſpell, and the very word of God; and withall, that reading is after a ſort

a publiſhing thereof, becauſe thereby the letter of the Text is recited with a lowd voice, from an eminent and conſpicuous place, in the audience of a multitude: yet when we ſhall enter into a more exact examination of things, it will then appeare, that Reading ſimply cannot be called a publiſhing of the Goſpell, in that ſenſe, as it is required of Miniſters and Teachers to be ſpreaders abroad and proclaimers of Gods truth. Adde hereto, that that which is the principall thing looked for of a Preacher in the publiſhing of the word, the bare Reader in the act of Reading, neither can nor doth performe: and that is,2. Tim. 2.15. the deuiding the word of truth aright: and (to apply Chriſts words in a caſe not much vnlike) a giuing to them of the houſhold (which is the Church,

Tim. 5.1.2. to the Elders, as to fathers, to the younger men as to brethren, to the elder women as to mothers, to the yonger as to ſiſters. After this ſort, euery mans portion muſt be allotted out vnto him: and this ordering of that prouiſion, which the Lord (as a carefull houſholder) hath left for his ſpirituall familie is committed vnto the Miniſter. The Scripture I confeſſe is profitable for theſe purpoſes,

is done by naked reading, to wit, a propounding to the houſhold, the whole ſtore, as it were in groſſe, it cannot be but whilſt euery one is left to be his own caruer, the young ones will be ſtarued, and the riotous and miſgouerned ſurfet themſelues, with greedie and vnbeſéeming taking that vnto them, which they are neither fit nor able to receiue. And this, I thinke, may ſerue to ſhew how litle reaſon there is in this firſt Reaſon, why reading of ye Scripture ſhold deſerue the honorable name of Preaching: when as both our common ſpeech,Act. 46.15 21.
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      and
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   and which is more) the language of the holy Ghoſt, hath put an apparant difference betwixt them.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  Indeed I acknowledge that to be true out of my owne experience: for though by priuate Reading the Scripture as alſo by hearing it read, I haue receiued much comfort: (the memorie of things taught thereby renewed, and the truth of them confirmed) yet I haue often bene quite ſet, often bene altogether miſtaken, and ſtill affraid of my owne iudgement euen in plainer places, vntill I haue found the publike expoſition giuen by the Miniſter

to iumpe and accord with my opinion. But what ſay you to the ſecond reaſon: namely, that in the Scriptures read, we heare the worthie ſermons of Chriſt, of the Prophets, and of his Apoſtles: and therefore Reading is Preaching?
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               I ſay it is a very weake argument. That the ſermons of Chriſt, the Prophets and Apoſtles were excellent ſermons, and that the ſumme & abridgement of them is to be found in Scripture, no man goeth about to denie: yet this being granted, will neuer prooue a Reader to be a Preacher. For he is not a Preacher, who reciteth publikely things of another mans inditing, but he which deliuereth matters (though not inuented) yet in reſpect of art and induſtrie compiled and framed by himſelf. If it be ſaid, that ye ſermons of Chriſt, &c. though they be not of his framing that readeth them, yet being read may turne to the profite of the people, I anſwer, that the queſtion is not, whether they may be profitable, but whether the reading of them may be called preaching. God forbid any man ſhould denie the publike reading of them to be for the behoofe of

Gods people, (I hope you haue not forgotten what I told you as my iudgment in this caſe) but how it may be ſaid, that he which hath read them to the people, hath performed that office of a Miniſter which we call preaching, neither can I conceiue, neither (as I thinke) is any man able to ſet downe. Beſides, if the word Sermon, ſhall be preciſely vrged, that which was the ſermon of Chriſt, or Ieremiah, or Paul, when they liued, and the ſame vttered by them, cannot be now being recorded in the Bible, and read out by another, ſo properly called a Sermon; becauſe in our common ſpeech a Sermon requireth the tongue and voice of him that framed it. And therefore to ſay (as ſome do) that Chriſt or ſome one of ye ancient Prophets or Apoſtles preacheth to vs, when we heare the ſumme of their ſermons read vnto vs, is but a borrowed kind of ſpéech, vſuall amongſt ſcholers. Such as that is,Heb. 11.24. Cap. 11.4. that the bloud of Abel ſpeaketh; and that he being dead yet ſpeaketh;
                  Pſal. 19.1.3. or which is ſaid of the heauens and firmament, that there is no ſpeech nor language, where their voice is not heard; and the like, common in the Scripture.

Againe, let the nature and eſtate of thoſe which are called the Sermons of the Prophets, of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles be a litle conſidered. Firſt in generall this is to be knowne, that we haue but the briefe and ſumme, and as it were the heades of their ſermons related in the Scripture: for if al that euery one of theſe ſpake publikely by way of teaching had bene written, we might well ſay as S. Iohn ſaid,Ioh. 21.25. touching the 
                     •
                  as and ſayings of our Sauiour Chriſt, the world could not containe the bookes: and therefore (if profite be deſired) there muſt neceſſarily be ſome courſe taken, by which ye things abridged, by the penmen of the holy Ghoſt in their writings, may be enlarged. Secondly, the ſermons of Moſes, are ſo interlaced with iudiciall ordinances and ceremoniall rites, appertaining onely to the pollicie of thoſe times, that for the peoples behoofe, it is more then conuenient, that they ſhould enioy the benefite of an able Miniſter, who may informe them herin, what things be morall, and what be temporarie, what is the ſubſtance of euery ceremoniall ſhadow, and what the perpetuall and vnchangeable

equitie of euery iudiciall conſtitution. Thirdly, touching the preachings of the Prophets; though they be full of comfort and abounding with ſweet cō
                  ſolation, becauſe the maine ſcope and drift of them all, is to foreſhew the renewing and reſtoring of the Church by Chriſt, and though they do alſo notably make knowne the iuſt iudgement of God againſt ſinne; yet they are ſo intermixed with myſticall prophecies, with hidden parables, with hiſtoricall narrations, and deſcriptions of countries, with borowed ſpéeches, and proprieties of that holy language in which they were deliuered: that, howſoeuer ſometimes a lambe (as the prouerbe is) may find a foord eaſily to be waded through, yet vnleſſe there be added the helpe and guidance of ſome learned Ezra,
                  Neh. 8. Iob. 33.23. ſome Meſſenger, or Interpreter, as Elihu fitly calleth him, and the ſame no ordinarie man,Mat. 4.17. but (as the text ſpeaketh) one of a thouſand, the people cannot poſſibly reape that good which God hath intended in the reuealing of thoſe things. Fourthly, for the ſermons of our Sauiour, as we haue but the very ſhort ſumme of

many of them (according as I ſaid before) ſo for thoſe which are reported more largely by the Euangeliſts,Luk. 4.21. I perſwade my ſelfe there is no man, but (if he will ſpeake the truth, out of his owne conſcience) he will confeſſe, that he learneth more by them when by preaching they are explaned, then when they are onely read vnto him. Fiftly, we haue in the Bible very few copies of the Apoſtles ſermons: thoſe that be, are in the booke of the Acts,Act. 4.2. Act 1.4.5.12. and yet many times, this is all which is ſaid of them: they preached in Ieſus the reſurrection from the dead, they went to and fro preaching the word, preached Chriſt, preached the things that concerne the kingdome of God, and many the like ſpéeches: all which are like vnto the litle cloud,
                  1. King. 18.44. which the ſeruant of Elias ſaw; which though at the firſt it was but like a mans hand, yet at laſt it couered the face of heauen: ſo theſe being clauſes of very few words, yet miniſter iuſt matter of many large diſcourſes, & the ſame alſo very néedfull for the well vnderſtanding of them. If it ſhall be ſaid that the Apoſtles writings were ſermons, I anſwer, they cannot properly be called their ſermons.

Paul writing to the Romaines, ſaith, that beſides this labour of writing,Rom. 1.15. he was readie alſo to preach the Goſpell vnto them: ſo that he did not account his writing to be preaching. The Epiſtles of the Apoſtles were the ſummes of that doctrine which they had taught by word of mouth, and according to the tenour whereof, their deſire was, that the Miniſters of the places to whom they wrote ſhould proceede. I know they were read in the Churches, according as it was méete,Col. 16. that a matter written to a whole congregation ſhould be communicated to all in publike: but what then? I doubt not, but the paſtors in the ſeuerall aſſemblies, did (as we now do) preach vpon thoſe Epiſtles, and open and apply them to their auditories: & ſo much may eaſily appeare, as by other places, ſo eſpecially by that ſpeech to the Hebrewes, by the author of the Epiſtle written to them: I beſeech you alſo brethren,
                  Heb. 13.22. 
                  ſuffer the words of exhortation: for I haue written vnto you in few words:
                  Caluin and Iunius. which ſpéech (as it is well obſerued by two learned interpreters of our later times) the Apoſtle purpoſely vſed, leſt his writing ſhould

be an occaſion to any, of leſſening that due eſtimation, which the ordinarie courſe of preaching did deſerue. It is all one as if the Apoſtle had ſaid: Brethren, notwithſtanding al this which I haue written vnto you, yet I pray you continue your accuſtomed reuerence to the labours of your owne Miniſters: I, as the nature of an Epiſtle requireth, haue written briefly, therefore you ſhall ſtill need the aſſiſtance of your watchfull and learned Ouerſeers, who ſhall enlarge theſe points, which I haue drawne as it were into a narrow roome, and by powerfull exhortations apply them either to your comfort of reproofe, as their knowledge in your eſtate from time to time ſhall direct them. This is the meaning of that place, plainely prouing ye neceſſitie of ioyning the pains of a preaching Miniſter, with the writings & Epiſtles of the Apoſtles of Chriſt Ieſus. And thus haue you my anſwer to this ſecond ſtout reaſon, why reading ſhold be preaching, becauſe forſooth, therby is cōmunicated to vs the ſumme and ſubſtance of the worthy ſermons which Chriſt, and the Prophets and Apoſtles haue formerly deliuered. The weakneſſe

of which reaſon, I hope this ſhort diſcourſe, hath made you to perceiue.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  For theſe two alleaged reaſons, you haue indifferently ſatisfied me. I do now expect, what you wil ſay, touching the laſt reaſō, why reading ſhold be preaching.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               The third reaſon (as I remēber) was, that reading may therefore truly be called preaching, becauſe in our Church the reading of ye Scripture is ſo ordered, that firſt, there is a portion of the old Teſtament read, next of the new, and thirdly ſome parcell of ye Epiſtles: which they will haue to be called preaching, becauſe as the new Teſtament is an expoſition of the old, ſo ye Epiſtles are the applying of both vnto Gods people. This I think, is the third reaſon, that you told me of.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  You haue hit it right, if you can anſwer it as fully, as you haue rehearſed it truly, then it ſhall neuer be any occaſion of ſcruple to me hereafter.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               To make a ſhort anſwer to a ſlight reaſon, this is that I ſay: It is true, if we compare ye whole new Teſtament, with the whole old Teſtament, that the latter is an expoſition of the former, becauſe it maketh knowne vnto vs, that all the ancient

promiſes,

                   touching the Meſſias, are yea and Amen in Chriſt Ieſus: ſo that the ſubſtance both of old and new is this, Ieſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, the ſame alſo is for euer. And hereupon is that ſaying of Auguſtine: The old Teſtament (ſaith he) is reuealed in the new, and the new, was as it were lapped and folded vp in the old: the ſame may alſo be acknowledged touching the Epiſtles, that in thē the doctrine both of the old & new Teſtament is applyed & preſſed vpon mens conſciences by wholeſome exhortations. But what then? though this hold in general, that the new Teſtament is the Cōmentarie to the old, and the Epiſtles, the applyers of both, yet it will ſcarcely be found to hold in particulars: namely, yt ſuch a parcell of ye new teſtament which cometh in order to be read, is an expoſitiō of the ſpecial doctrine, and matter of that portion of the old Teſtament, which was read before it, or that that part of the Epiſtles, which followeth both, is a direct and expreſſe vrger of both. So that howſoeuer when we diuide ye Scriptures into theſe thrée parts, ye old Teſtament, the hiſtory of the Goſpell, & the Epiſtles, it be

true, yt this is the cōmon nature & ſtate of them, that the ſecond part giueth light vnto the firſt, & the latter raiſeth exhortations out of both, yet when we come to ſingle out theſe parts into ſeuerall portions, we ſhall not find that preciſe and exact correſpondence, as that the expoſition of the ſame points, ſhall be ſaid to follow one the other. And this is all which I wil oppoſe to this third reaſō: which though perhaps it may make a ſhew among thoſe that are of leſſe iudgement, yet it can deceiue no man, that hath any ordinarie ſkill in the ſtate of an argument.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  This point hath held vs longer then I either wiſhed or imagined: but I was willing, ſeeing God had giuen this oportunity, to mention as much as I could remember of things which I haue heard ſpoken touching theſe points; neither is there now any thing behind, (that I can call to mind) which I may further propound vnto you, concerning this matter.

               It is no maruell though the examination of this one point, hath ſpent vs ſo much time: for this is certaine, that euery ſhort obiection, wil require a large confutation. Now for the matter it ſelfe,

there may perhaps be ſome other obiections, differing from theſe in ſhew, but yet they will all in the end be found to be the ſame. I remember I haue read of a vain glorious boaſter,Athen

                  That I may then reape benefit by your aduice in reſpect of that which followeth, I ſaid (if you remember) that the exceptions in which I deſired to be reſolued, were ſome againſt Preaching it ſelfe, ſome againſt the manner of it: the exceptions againſt preaching it ſelfe, I haue (as memorie wold ſerue) acquainted you with:
                  Exceptions againſt the maner of preaching. 
                  there are three things in the manner of your preaching that are much diſliked and diſcommended: the firſt is, Rudeneſſe: the

ſecond is roughneſſe; the third is ouermuch commonneſſe. Touching the firſt, it is ſaid, that you preach vnlearnedly without eloquence, without allegation of Fathers and of other authors, and therefore you are accounted but as a company of Engliſh Doctors, which preach vpon the ſodaine what cometh in your heads, without ſtudy, which cauſeth your doctrine to be the leſſe regarded.

               Verily for mine owne part I do as much miſlike raſhneſſe in preaching without due preparation, and rudeneſſe in handling the word of life, as any man.Ieremy 48.10. I know he is curſed that doeth the worke of the Lord negligently. And as it is méete for euery man when he entreth into the houſe of God,

                  2. Corintl. 5.20 to be very well aduiſed before he take the couenant of God in his mouth. And indéed,Pſalme 50.16. the bold hardineſſe of many now adayes, is greatly to be pitied, who ſo ordinarily hand ouer head (as we ſay) ſtep vp into the pulpit, and when they are there,

And yet in the ſtudy of the fathers, there is many times a double error cōmitted: the one is, that men begin the ſtudy of Diuinitie with the reading of their workes; which courſe for the moſt part bréedeth both confuſion for want of methode,

But to ſpeak more directly, (becauſe theſe ſimilitudes ſerue more to giue light then ſtrength to a matter) if you be deſirous to know a reaſon why we ought to be very ſparing in the vſe of mens teſtimonies in our ordinary ſermons, this is (as I think) ye principal, namely,1.

               I do not ſay that it is abſolutely vnlawfull to alleage a ſentence out of an auncient writer, or out of a Heathen author: for beſides that many graue, godly, and well learned men do ſometimes ſo; there may be as I thinke ſome

(at leaſt) tolerable cauſes to alleage thē. As for example; the Papiſts ordinarily giue out (& it is common in the mouthes of our ſubuerted Proſelites) that the ancient Fathers of the Church are all on their ſide. For this cauſe, ſometimes in ſome ſpeciall points of difference betwixt them and vs, I take it not to be diſallowable, if the Preacher for the taking away of that ſcruple out of ye minds of mē, do ſhew ye conſent of the elder writers, that men may ſée it is but a vaine brag which our aduerſaries make when they ſay that their religion is ſutable to the iudgement of the auncient Church: yet withall, I would not haue a man make this ordinary. And beſides, I hold it fit for him to admoniſh the people that it is done, not to derogate from the ſufficiencie of the Scripture, neither to tie them to the opinions of men, but onely to remoue that doubt which by the whiſpering of wandring Papiſts may ariſe in the minds of thoſe that are not ſo well ſetled in Religion. So likewiſe, for the ſpéeches and ſentences of prophane authors, to bar them vtterly out of ſermons, I dare not, becauſe I find them

                      32 21 according as many times the Prophets to reforme the backwardneſſe and ſlackneſſe of the Iewes, preach to them of the forwardnes and zeale that ſhal be in the Gentiles after their conuerſion. The ſame kind of reaſoning no doubt a Preacher may ſometimes profitably vſe, by the morally good precepts and actions of the Heathen to checke the careleſnes of men profeſſing Chriſtianity. Thus, now & then I hold a man may tolerably alleage a ſentence of a profane writer, & a ſpéech of a

heathē author. As for the ſtrange maner of preaching which is in vſe in many places, both in the vniuerſities & elſewhere, there is no man well affected, but if he knoweth it, he doeth excéedingly pitie it. One, as though the pulpit were but as a ſcaffold, in which he like a maſter of Defence were to play his prizes, and to giue teſtimony of his wit, playeth vpon euery word, and deſcanteth vpon euery letter in his text,Ta

                  I willingly agree vnto you in that which you haue ſaid touching ſome

mens courſe of preaching: I haue ſometimes my ſelfe bene at ſome mens ſermons which haue had the name of great Clarkes and learned men, and yet (it may be mine owne dulneſſe was the cauſe) ſuch hath bin their maner of handling, ſo full of ſchoole-points and termes, and ſayings of men, that neither hath my iudgement bene bettred, nor my conſcience any whit comforted thereby. But I do not yet ſee how you will make the parts of your owne ſpeech to agree: you ſay preaching muſt be learned and eloquent, and yet you are ſtraite in allowing the vſe of thoſe things which may teſtifie learning, and garniſh and ſet forth your ſermons: for I tel you, in the countrey here you are not thought learned, nor yet eloquent, ſo long as you ſpeake nought but Engliſh, and withall common and ordinarie words, and alleage nothing but places of ſcripture, which euery man can fetch out of the Bible as well as you. I pray you therfore recōcile theſe two, how there ſhall be that plainneſſe in your ſermons, and yet learning too.

               The matter is not what men think,How a ſermon may be plaine & yet learned. but what men ought to think. It is poſſible for a man to be ſkilful in ye tongues,

and yet to be farre from a learned man: and much reading, though it argueth induſtry, & may be a witneſſe of a good memory, yet it is no certaine argument of ſound iudgment. That man is moſt learned, who by his ſkill can make another man learned:
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Mathew 28.19. for this is the end of preaching, to make men ſchollers: and he is moſt eloquent, that can make him who heareth him, vnderſtand yt which he him ſelfe conceiueth. The intent of learning, is not ye men which haue it ſhould therby bréed aſtoniſhmēt in their hearers, & gain admiration to themſelues, but that by it they ſhold be profitable & helpful to thoſe which are without it. So likewiſe, the vſe of eloquence is not to be as it were a miſt before a mans ſpéeches, to cauſe him to be the more hardly vnderſtood, but to giue luſtre (as I may ſo ſpeake) thereto, & to bring both light & delight to the dull apprehenſiō of the hearers. And therfore whoſoeuer ſo preacheth, as that becauſe of the depth of his learning (as men cal it) he paſſeth the capacity of the meaneſt hearer: again, whoſoeuer ſo ſpeaketh, as that his eloquence (as men terme it) maketh him to be as it were an alient to his

ordinary audience, ſurely the ſame is neither truly learned, nor truly eloquent, becauſe his learning not conceiued profiteth not, & his eloquence not vnderſtood benefits not. So that this being conſidered, that he is moſt learned whoſe preaching is moſt profitable; and he moſt eloquent, whoſe maner of ſpeaking beſt entreth into euery ordinary conceit: it is an eaſie matter to reconcile theſe two, that our preaching muſt be learned, yet familiar eloquent, and yet ſo plaine, that it may be truly ſaid of it, that if it be hid,

                  Yet it will be thought that preaching will grow into very great contempt, and ſeeme but baſe in the eyes of wiſe men, if choiſe ſpeaking & quaint words, which in other diſcourſes are thought very commendable, ſhall be baniſhed from your ſermons.

                     .21. When the Goſpel was firſt preached in ye world, the reaſon why it had ſo cold entertainement was this: The Iewes they wold either haue it confirmed by ſome extraordinary ſignes, or els they wold not credit it:

                  (The Iewes require a ſigne:) The Gentiles being men of great learning, as appeareth, they ſeeing Paul and the reſt comming after a very meane faſhion, men for their perſonage ſilly, for their profeſſion, making ſhew to know nothing but one Chriſt, & the ſame crucified, and for their courſe and cariage in the miniſtery, plaine, auoyding purpoſely the enticing words of mans wiſedome, they by & by ſcorned it, and déemed it folly to be caried away by a thing of that ſimplicity: (The Grecians ſeeke after wiſdome): hereupon this Epithete was caſt by the reprochful world vpon the beſt kind of preaching, to cal it fooliſhnes, and al for this one cauſe, becauſe as for the ſubſtance of it, it is croſſing to mans reaſon, ſo for the faſhiō of it, according to the world, it is cleane out of faſhion, onely beautifull in this, becauſe it is not beautified with that, without which the nice and giddy world thinketh euery thing to be deformed. So that the opinion of men reputing it to be but fooliſhneſſe, becauſe it wanteth that gariſh garniſhing which mens itching eares are much delighted with, ought to be no diſparagement to it in the ſight

of thoſe that are truly religious: and I pray God giue vs all grace that are called to the Miniſterie, to be ſo ſet for the glorie of God in the conuerſion of ſoules,Non ornamenta, ſed documenta Aug. de doctr. Chriſt lib. 4. c. 19 Magra eſt ar

Beſides we find it true by common experience, yt the greateſt part are ſo dead in ſin, yt if a Preacher ſhould deale after ſome ſuch mild faſhion,1. Sam. 2.23. as old Eli dealt with his ſons, his ſermō will be but like a dreame when one awaketh: the hearer happily when he is gone will think he heard ſomthing, but he knoweth not what, and becauſe he was reprooued but ſoftly, he wil imagine that he ſinned but ſleightly, & ſo wil let al ſlip as eaſily as it came gently. So yt a man yt intendeth to do any good in this frozen generation, he had néed to be rather Boanerges,

                  word of the Lord is like an hammer: now if you adde that to it wc 
                  Salomon ſaith,Eccl. 12.11. that the words of the wiſe, are like nailes it wil follow thence, yt he which is a wiſe maiſter-builder in ye Lords houſe, and a workman that needeth not to be aſhamed,

thoſe which heare him. Well then, this is the ſubſtance of my opinion in this point: I would haue a preacher to preach peace, and to ayme at nothing more, then the comfort of the ſoules of Gods people, yet I would haue him withall frame his courſe to the manner of Gods appearing to Elijah:
                  1. kin. 19.11. The text ſaith, that firſt a mightie ſtrong wind rent the mountaines, and brake the rockes: then, after that came an earthquake, and after the earthquake came fire: and after all theſe, then came a ſtill and a ſoft voice. After the ſame manner, I would not haue the ſtill and mild voice of the Goſpell come, till the ſtrong tempeſt of the law, hath rent ye ſtony harts of men,Nab. 3.16. & hath made their bellies to tremble, and rottenneſſe to enter into their bones, and to cry with that good king Hezechiah:Iſa.

                  But what ſay you now, ſir, to the third accuſation: which is, that you make your preaching too common, and ſo by that means draw it into contempt, & make it to be the leſſe eſteemed among men?

               I am the more ſorie: and to tell you what I thinke plainly, I am of that mind, that thoſe which blame often preaching as a fault, what colour ſoeuer they may ſet vpon it, yet they do it chiefly for the couering of their own ſhame, yt their

negligence may not be taken notice of. I remember the old fable of the Foxe, who hauing had a miſchance & loſt his taile, coming into the aſſembly of the beaſts of the ſame kind, fell to perſwade them euery one to cut off his taile, pleading the cumberſomneſſe and waightineſſe of it, with many the like circumſtances: but the matter coming to further ſcanning, it was found, that the wily foxe did it onely to couer his owne deformitie, which (if to be without tailes had once bene a faſhion) ſhould neuer haue bene eſpied. I leaue you to apply it. Only I wold wiſh all ſuch ſo minded,Ne veſcenti

               They ſay, the ouer-commonneſſe of preaching, will breed contempt of preaching. Firſt of all, ſuppoſe it fareth with ſome, in reſpect of preaching, as it did with the vnthankfull Iſraelites,Num. 11.6. which loathed the Manna, wherwith the Lord ſo miraculouſly fed them in the wilderneſſe, ſo they alſo ſeeme to be (as it were) glutted, with the continuall vſe of the word preached: yet this can be no reaſon why a diligent and frequent Preacher ſhould remit any thing of his former induſtrie, and ſpeak more ſparingly, drawing his Sermons into a ſmaller number, then he was wont. It is truly ſaid, that there are thrée very good mothers, which haue three very bad daughters, and they are theſe: 1. Truth, which yet in ye world bréedeth hatred. 2. Peace, a great bleſſing of God, and yet through our corruption it cauſeth Idleneſſe. 3. Familiarity, and the cōmon vſe of a good thing, which is notwithſtanding moſtly recompenced with Contempt. And yet this is not in the nature of theſe things, but onely in our corruption. For as the nature of

God is ſo perfectly good, that he doth turn euen very euill things, into very good things: (as he made the malice of the Iewes, in putting his Sonne to death, to be a meane of our ſaluation) ſo our nature is ſo abſolutely euill, that it turneth very good things into euill: as ſometimes the grace of God into wantonneſſe,
                  Iud. 4. Gal. 5.13. and Chriſtian libertie into an occaſion vnto the fleſh, & ſo in theſe particulars which I haue named. Now becauſe truth is generally hated, ſhall men therefore baniſh it from their ſpeeches, and frame their toungs to flatterie? Becauſe many abuſe the bleſſing of peace, ſhall we therefore voluntarily raiſe tumults, or deſire God to put an end to our happie dayes of quietneſſe? There is in the world no reaſon for it. Neither is there any iuſt cauſe, why we ſhould go about to make our preaching, as it were, ſomething more dainty, becauſe it may ſéeme to ſome raw and ill diſpoſed ſtomackes, to breed a kind of fulneſſe and ſatietie. Secondly, if we looke better into it, we ſhall ſee, that the true cauſe of mens contempt of preaching, is not ſo much the common vſe of it, as the ignorance of the worth and excellencie

of it. The Sun, the water, the fire, what things more common, and yet what things leſſe deſpiſed? and ye reaſon is, becauſe we all know, we cannot liue without them. Let men be once perſwaded of this, that neither the Sunne, nor water, nor fire are more neceſſary for the outward man, then preaching is for the ſoule and ſpirit, and that where it is wanting,Prou. 29.18. there the people decay, thē they will neuer be cloyed: or at leaſt, if ſatietie through the in-bred corruption of our nature créepe vpon them, by the remembrance hereof it will quickly be recouered. Thirdly, do but marke, what courſe of preaching it is, which pleaſeth ſome to call ouer-common: namely, a ſetled courſe for euery Sabboth, and it may be ſome wéeke day Lecture, as it is called vſually. Now I would faine ſée, how any man can ſay with reaſon, that this is ouer often. Paule commaundeth to preach in ſeaſon.
                  2. Tim 4.2. If this charge carie any waight, what better ſeaſon can there be, then the Sabboth, a day of leaſure, a day in which men, if not for conſcience, yet for cuſtome and becauſe of the lawes aſſemble themſelues in one

place, for the performance of one common dutie and ſeruice vnto God? I remember, it is premitted as a circūſtance to the hiſtoricall relation of ſome of Chriſts ſermons,Mat. 5.1.13.

                  and he began to teach them. So no doubt it is, & ought to be with euery good Miniſter: he cannot (as we ſay) find in his heart, to diſmiſſe a multitude aſſembled to worſhip God, without ſome word of exhortation. Me thinketh, that when a Paſtor of a pariſh is comen into the church vpon the Sabboth day, & beholdeth his whole flocke gathered together as one man, he ſhould euen imagine, yt the very preſence of the people doth cal to him,Act. 13 15: as ye 
                  Rulers of the ſynagogue did to Paul and Barnabas) yt if he haue any word of exhortation for them, he ſhould ſay on. So that if to preach in ſeaſon, be a Miniſter his dutie; and the fulneſſe of an aſſembly vpon ye ſabboth be a ſeaſonable occaſiō, (as

no man can deny it) I cannot ſee how: ſo ſeaſonable an exerciſe, can be charged with ouer-commonneſſe, or blamed as a meanes to make the word of God leſſe precious amongſt men. God requireth, that we ſhould call the Sabboth a delight to conſecrate it:
                  Iſa. 5
                        •
                     .13. now, how can that day be hallowed and conſecrated as it ought, if ſo ſpeciall a part of Gods ſpirituall worſhip, as preaching is, be left out? how muſt not the whole other ſeruice of the day, be euen as a lame and maymed ſacrifice before God? I know indéed it pleaſeth ſome to ſay, that the méeting of the people together to the hearing of the word preached (a phraſe ſcoffed at,2. Tim. 4 2. Mark. 2.2. as though it were not the language of the Scripture) is not the chiefe inſtitution of the Lords day. But whatſoeuer mens idle conceipts be, yet the truth is, that the moſt excellent part of Gods ſeruice,Preaching the principall exerciſe of the Sabboth. conſiſteth in the exerciſe of his word: the faithfull diſpenſing whereof is the beautie of the Lords houſe, and the very life of the Sabboth. The other parts of Gods publike worſhip, do but as it were waite and giue attendance vpon this. For, wherefore is prayer, but to prepare vs to

the word, and to begge of God to beſtow thoſe bleſſings which are promiſed in the word? And if we will credite the Scripture, men cannot pray till by preaching they are taught to pray.Rom. 10 
                        •
                     
                   
                  How ſhall they call on him, vpon whom they haue not beleeued, &c. The place is knowne well inough. Againe, what is the vſe of the Sacraments, but to be ſeales to the word? The preaching of the word is the tenor of the couenant betwixt God and vs: the Sacraments are ſeales, to aſſure vs of the performance of the gracious promiſes, made vnto vs in the word. So that indéed the other ſpecialties of Gods worſhip, are of no vſe, but onely ſo farforth as they haue reference to the word. In the ſecond of Iſaiah his prophecie, where the ſtate of the Church of the Goſpell is deſcribed,Iſa. 2.3. the people are brought in, prouoking one another to aſcend vp to the mountaine of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Iacob: to encourage themſelues and other hereunto, they vſe this reaſon, he will teach vs his wayes: no doubt in their méetings they were to vſe both prayer and the Sacraments. But yet, that there they ſhold be taught, was

vſed as the principall motiue; becauſe, as to be taught the wayes of the Lord, is the principall bleſſing, ſo obediently to heare is the principall ſeruice. Wherein hath the Lord ſo great pleaſure,
                  1 Sam. 15.22. as in this, when his voyce is obeyed; and how can his voyce be obeyed till it is known, and what other ordinarie meanes of knowledge ſhall we truſt vnto beſides preaching? Séeing then the Sabboth day is a fit time in regard of peoples aſſombling together, and ſeeing alſo the preaching and hearing of the word, is a main part of the worſhip of God, and by conſequence eſpecially intended in the firſt inſtitution of the Sabboth, he that indeuoureth to entertaine his people euery Lords day, with the opening and applying the Scriptures, cannot iuſtly be accuſed to be one, who by too much familiaritie draweth the ordinance of God into contempt.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  Well, ſuppoſe it be yeelded vnto, that it be good to continue the exerciſe of Preaching euery Sabbath day, yet it may ſeeme ſuperfluous to draw the people to hearing vpon the weeke dayes, when men are otherwiſe in their worldly affaires to be employed.

               That is it which I was now next about to ſpeake of:Of weeke-day Lectures. I cannot ſay it is a matter of neceſſity for a Miniſter to ty himſelfe or his auditors to a wéeke-day ſermō: yet if a Preacher be willing ſo to beſtow his paines, and the people, in reſpect of their dwelling together, as in cities and greater townes, be ready to redeeme ſome time for ſo good a purpoſe,Epheſ. 5.16. I hold it very commendable. When Paul and Barnabas preached at Antioch,Acts 13 42
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   we reade that the Gentiles beſought them that they would preach thoſe words to them, in the ſpace betwixt that and the Sabbaoth day. Now though I will not ſay that that example is a law, yet I muſt needs ſay it is an allowance to ſuch a courſe: and that which was commendable in them, cannot deſerue blame in others of Gods childrē, who are willing to diuert ſome of their time allowed for outward buſineſſes to ſpirituall occaſions, as namely for the increaſing of their knowledge,Iude 20 and for the edifying themſelues in their moſt holy faith. Neither can ſuch a courſe be more an occaſion of bringing preaching into contempt, then the eſtabliſhed order for méeting on wedneſdayes

and fridaies to praier & reading of the ſcriptures, can be or is an occaſion to make theſe good exerciſes to be deſpiſed.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  I haue heard ſome ſay, that it is ſound and learned preaching which we that are the people muſt wiſh for, and not often and continuall preaching: and that the word of God is compared to raine, which though it be in meaſure profitable, yet in abundance maketh the ſeede rotten vnder the clods.
                  
                  Ioel 1.17. 
                  In like maner they ſay that preaching in moderation may do much good, but if it exceed, may be an occaſion of barrenneſſe among the hearers.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               It is a wofull thing, that men ſhould ſo far ſtretch their wits to deceiue their own ſoules, & to beguile others alſo. I would we had all learned the Apoſtles rule,2. Corinth. 13.8 
                  not to do any thing againſt the truth, but for the truth. To ſatiſfie you touching this yt you haue named, hauing obſerued it (as you ſay) out of the ſpéeches of ſome: it is worthy the marking, how Satan in his ſubtlety vnder the color of allowing & vrging ſound preaching, would ouerthrow diligent preaching; therein building vpon a falſe ground, namely, that a man cānot preach often & preach ſoundly

too: which how falſe it is, ye vnreprouable labors of many induſtrious miniſters in this land, are a ſufficient witnes. It is a wiſe & holy ſpéech of Salomon, & may be wel applyed to this purpoſe,Prouerbs. 10.4. 
                  A ſlouthfull hand maketh poore, but the hand of the diligent maketh rich: and againe,Chap. 12.14. 
                  There is that ſcattereth & is more increaſed, but he that ſpareth more thē is right, ſurely cometh to pouerty. Men of excellent gifts many times, whileſt either in niceneſſe fearing to hurt their bodies, or in pride, being as it were vnwilling to make thēſelues too common, they are more ſparing in this exerciſe of preaching (which is the glory of a Miniſter) through the iuſt iudgment of God looſe their former perfection, & as through diſuſe they grow leſſe willing, getting a kind of habite of negligence, ſo alſo they become leſſe able to do good in ye Church of God then they were before. Now when preaching (through defalt of oftē inuring thēſelues vnto it) becometh more irkſom, they being to ſeek in many things when they fal to make preparatiō for it, then ſtraite becauſe of their owne vnaptnes (ye iuſt puniſhment of idlenes) they conclude, yt thoſe who preach ſo oftē
                  
(as they call it) preach careleſly without ſtudy and without learning. On the other ſide, men (it may be) of meaner (yet commendable) gifts, who remembring the neceſſitie which is layed vpon them,
                  1 Corinth. 9.16 and the woe which ſhall follow, if they preach not the Goſpell, do euen deuote themſelues and all their ſtudies and endeuours to the ſeruice of the church, and do ſo long after their people from the very heart roote in Ieſus Chriſt,
                  Phil. 1.8. that for their ſpiritual furtherance they could beteame to deale euen their owne ſoules vnto thē:1. Theſſ. 28. ſuch I ſay, through the bleſſing of God vpon their holy labours, do ſo increaſe in iudgement and in zeale, and haue ſuch a doore of vtterance opened vnto them,Coloſ 4 3. 
                  to ſpeake the myſterie of Chriſt, that as they themſelues placing a kind of felicity in the doing of their dutie, find in themſelues a certain facultie in that heauenly exerciſe, ſo the Church of God committed to them, is inſtructed by their ſoundneſſe of doctrine, and whetted on by their zealous exhortations. So that to ſay, that ſound preaching is for the peoples behoofe, and not frequent preaching, is a méere colluſion, preſuppoſing that which

is moſt falſe, namely, that ſoundnes of doctrine and ofteneſſe of teaching cannot go together. How litle I approue of raſh aduenturing vpon this kind of exerciſe, that which I haue ſpoken formerly may witneſſe: and how ſmall reaſon there is to ſeparate theſe two, profitable preaching and often preaching, I referre it to any indifferent iudgement.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  But becauſe ſome that are reputed learned, affirme that often preaching is not ſo much for the peoples profite; ſhew me I pray you ſome good reaſon to the contrary, that I may be able both to preuaile againſt mine owne backwardnes when I beginne to grow weary of diligent hearing, and to prouoke others alſo, when I ſhal behold them as it were glutted with multitude of ſermons.

Firſt for attentiō, we ſée it by euery days experience, how like the moſt of our hearers are vnto the idols of the heathen, of whom the Pſalme ſaith,Pſalme. 115.6. yt

                  God ſpeaketh once or twiſe, & one ſeeth it not: many excellent things are ſpoken which we obſerue not: we heare generally with the hearing of the eare,

Secondly, for conceit & vnderſtāding, our ſlownes therin equalleth our ſlothfulnes in the former: many points are taught, & yt with as much plainnes as is poſſible; in which notwithſtanding he that ſpeaketh ſeemeth as it were a Barbarian vnto vs.

                  2. Corinth. 4.6. we haue at ye firſt but as it were a certain glimpſe of heauenly matters, the preciſe & exact knowledge is not by and by attained. Thirdly, touching memory, how great weaknes there is in it, I cal euery mans conſcience to witnes. Indeed we ſee how ſurely and how long men can remember matters of the world. The vncharitable and malicious man will remember an euill turne many a yeere, wayting ſtill an oportunity to reuenge it. The old man hath ſo freſh an impreſſion of the toyes & vanities of his youth, yt he wil make you as perfite a relation of them with euery

circumſtance, as if they had bene done but yeſterday. The couetous worldling, though perhaps he can neither write nor reade, nor hath any to keepe his reckonings, yet he can remember all his bargaines, all his conditions in bargaining, all his dayes, and houres, & places, either for the payment or receipt of any thing. The young man or woman can ſoone learne without book many a ballad or idle Loue-ſong, tending to the increaſing or ſtirring vp of vncleanneſſe: and ſo it fareth in other particulars. But come now to matters of religion & piety, alas how true is it that the conceipt of them is as ſoone gone from our minds, as the ſound from our eares?2. Sam. 18.29. When Dauid enquired of Ahimaaz comming from the camp, touching Abſolom, his anſwer was, I ſaw a great tumult, but I knew not what. Like to this will be the anſwer of a great many, when at their returne frō the houſe of God they are demaunded touching the particulars there deliuered; they will ſay, they ſaw a man ſpeaking, and heard the noiſe of his voice, and beheld his geſture, but they know not what, they can tell litle of that which

was vttered by him. Laſtly, for ſlowneſſe in practiſe, it is long before, after long hearing we are brought to incline to a good dutie, and yet after ſome good diſpoſition to it, there are ſo many delayes, and ſo many pul-backes, yea and after a reaſonable beginning ſo many fallings backe,Gal. 6.9. and ſo much waxing weary of well doing, that we are too well like Salomons ſluggard, who it may be maketh many offers of riſing, yet whileſt he crieth,Poruerbs 6.10. 
                  Yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber, the time ſtealeth away,Prouerb. 24.31. and his vineyard is all growne ouer with thornes for want of huſbandry. This is our drowſie ſicknes of ſlowneſſe of heart: The beſt ordinary remedy againſt this diſeaſe, is often preaching, as you ſhall ſee if you well examine it. Continuall calling vpon, at laſt through a kind of importunitie will win vs to attention. Often repetition of the ſame points will both cleare the vnderſtanding and ſettle the iudgment alſo.Phili. 3.1. 
                  It grieueth me not (ſaith Paul) to write the ſame things to you, and for you it is a ſure thing. That which after many times deliuery is ſtil committed to forgetfulneſſe, yet at the laſt it is laid vp in the mids of the hart,

and by the negligence and backwardnes of many yeeres,Eccleſ. 12.11. yet in the end (the words of the wiſe Preacher being like goades) is drawne vnto ſome cōfortable perfection. If oftē preaching may lawfully be comcomplained of, who haue iuſter cauſe to grone vnder the burden of it, then we that are Miniſters?

                  Mathew 18.22. & ſhould ſay, Maſter how long

willt thou that I preach vnto a ſtif-necked and obſtinate people? vnto ſeuen times? I doubt not but he would returne him the like anſwer that he did to Peter, I ſay not to thee, vnto ſeuen times, but vnto ſeuentie times ſeuen times.

And though it be a great hart-breaking to haue laboured long to ſmall purpoſe, yet for our Maſters ſake there is further triall to be made, hoping that yet at the length that long-expected draught will come, and accounting our ſelues happy, and all our paines wel beſtowed, if with all that we can do, we ſhall gaine one ſoule vnto God. To ſhut vp this point then, if we ſhall duely weigh our owne backwardnes, and withal the Miniſters duty, of whom that inſtant diligence is required, we ſhal then ſée that it is much and often preaching which we muſt wiſh for, beſeeching the Lord to pardon that aboue all things, if we ſhall find the word through the common vſe of it to grow vile before vs.

It is true,Iſay 55.10.11. the word of God is in the holy Scripture compared to raine, and that very fitly: becauſe as the raine falling vpon the land, maketh it either more

fruitful or more barren, according to the nature of the ſoyle vpon which it falleth; ſo the word that goeth out of the mouth of the Lord, doeth not returne vnto him vo

I do not find in the ſcripture the ſimilitude of raine when it is applied to the word to haue any further meaning: and therfore to ſtretch it further according to a mans owne priuate fancy, is to forget the Apoſtles rule of vnderſtanding according to ſobrietie;
                  Romanes. 12.3 and wilfully to continue in ſuch a practiſe,2. Peter 3.16. is no other but to peruert the Scriptures to a mans owne deſtruction. The Lord doeth in the ſcripture threaten it as a plague, to take away the Prophet,

or ſeldome and thinne preaching promiſed as a bleſſing. And ſurely, if, as abundance of raine, ſo abundance of preaching were a puniſhment, I doubt not but the good laws of our Church which haue preſcribed a prayer againſt ouer-much raine, might well ſet downe the ſame courſe in reſpect of much preaching: from which notwithſtanding euery honeſt mans eares would abhorre. And therefore I will be bolde to conclude, that this reaſon preſſing the ſimilitude of rayne and moyſture to the waſhing away of diligent preaching and hearing from out of Gods Church, is a very dry reaſon, which though it may appeare to haue ſome taſte of witte, yet hath ſcarcely any ſmacke of honeſtie.
            
            
               Nymp.
               
                  I pray God therefore we may remember to make the prayer which our Sauior taught vs, namely, that the Lord of the harueſt would ſend forth laborers into his harueſt,
                  
                  Mathew 9.38 
                  and that he would ſo furniſh them with gifts of knowledge, of vtterance, and of zeale, that they may vrge and call vpon vs continually: for (as you truly ſayed) we are ſo ſlow and backward, that except we

be dayly pricked forward and rouzed vp, we ſhall grow cold and careleſſe, and be euen frozen vpō the dregs of our owne ſecuritie. I know ſir, that in good manners it is now high time to forbeare troubling you any further, yet I would gladly craue your direction in one thing more; and that is this: for mine owne part I thanke God, I both do, and euer (ſince I had any taſt of goodneſſe) hue loued preaching, onely I find a great defect in my ſelfe, that I cannot ſo profite by it as I would, and as I ſee many do. I am bold therefore to intreate you to ſhew me how and by what meanes I may heare profitably, both for the ſetling of my iudgement, and for the increaſe of holineſſe in my common conuerſation. The humours of many men, are herein verie ſtrange: ſome ſay that there are ſuch differences of opinions among you that be learned, that a common man knoweth not which of you to beleeue: others hold opinion, that it is not for priuate ordinarie perſons, to take vppon them to iudge of the things they heare; ſo that the reſolution of the greateſt part is, that it is the wiſeſt way

either not to heare, or elſe if for ſatisfying the lawes they muſt heare, yet not to giue credit. Beſides, there are many of vs which heare vſually, and yet are little bettered by it:
                  1. Tim. 1 6. 
                  their knowledge is but vaine iangling, and their conuerſation not much differing from the irreligious mulitude: they are like the fiſh in the ſea, which howbeit it liueth in the ſalt water, yet is without all taſt of ſaltneſſe.
                  Mat. 5.13. 
                  So though they liue vnder a ſetled miniſtery (which is the ſalt of the earth) yet being taſted, wil be found vtterly without any true ſeaſoning. Now if it might be, I would be loth to be in this number: and therfore my laſt (though not my leaſt) ſuite vnto you, is to affoord me your beſt counſell in this caſe.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               I muſt néeds commend your good care in this matter: for indeed whatſoeuer men think, there is nothing ſo ful of danger as is idle and vnprofitable hearing. Thoſe things which are in their owne nature beſt, being ill vſed become moſt hurtfull. Hearing is the ordinance of God to draw vs vnto himſelfe: but being vſed careleſly and vnprofitably, it turneth to our greater condemnation: and therefore you cannot be too carefull

herein. It is true that men pretend many things whereby to ſhift off the diligence which is required in this behalfe: but their pretences being examined will become lighter then vanitie it ſelfe. They ſay, we that are Preachers, cannot agree among our ſelues; that is not abſolutely true; for bleſſed be God many of vs do proceede by one rule,
                  Phil. 3.16 and do mind one thing. Beſides, ſo long as we liue here in the world, our vnderſtanding is mixed with the darkneſſe of ignorance, and by reaſon thereof, there cannot chuſe but be differences of opinions in ſome things euen among the beſt. Take me three or foure, or halfe a doozen, which are dimme ſighted, and cannot ſee without ſpectacles, if you ſet them to deſcrie a thing a farre off, they will be of diuers and contrarie opinions touching it: now Saint Paul ſayth, that in this life, we do but ſee, as in a glaſſe darkely:
                  1. Cor. 13.12. and therefore our iudgements in all things at all times cannot be the ſame. Moreouer, it pleaſeth the Lord ſometimes for their puniſhment, which haue not receiued the loue of the truth,
                  2. Theſſ. 2.10. and for the diſcouerie of thoſe which are
                  
ſathan to be a falſe ſpirit in the mouths of ſome,1 Cor. 11 19. 
                  1. King. 22 22. and to ſuffer them to come amongſt vs in ſheepes clothing, though inwardly they are rauening wolues.
                  Matth. 7.15. Now the poſſibilitie of being deceiued when we heare, ought rather to increaſe our care in hearing, then to be an occaſion of vnwillingneſſe to heare. This may be manifeſted by a plaine ſimilitude: Salomon exhorting vs to be carefull to obtaine the knowledge of Gods truth,Pro. 23 23. deliuereth his exhortation in theſe words, Buy the truth: from this kind of ſpeech I reaſon thus: If a man wanting neceſſaries, as meat and rayment, and being aduiſed to furniſh himſelfe from the market, ſhould make this anſwer: The world is ſo full of deceipt, that a man knoweth not whom to truſt, thoſe which ſell, many of them wil not ſticke to beguile their owne fathers, and the trickes and deuiſes that tradesmen haue are infinit, ſo that it is twenty to one, but a man in chafering with them ſhall be beguiled, I had rather therefore go neare the wind, and want neceſſarie prouiſion, then put it to the aduenture of buying. If I ſay, a man pleade thus, what would we thinke of him, but that

either he were very fooliſh or very froward? And indéed we might well ſo eſtéeme him, becauſe we know that the fraud of others muſt be preuented rather with care and circumſpection, and not vſed as an occaſion of abridging a mans ſelfe of neceſſaries. Is not he then as much a foole, who wanting the ſauing knowledge of the truth, and being called vpon to repaire vnto the houſe of God, (which is as it were the Lords market, in which the hid treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge are laid open to the view and offered freely to the vſe of all men) ſhall eftſoones plead the deceiueableneſſe of falſe doctrine, the corruption of many Preachers, the ſhew of ſome contrarieties among them? Yes verily, for is he to depriue himſelfe of the neceſſarie foode of his ſoule, becauſe it may be for lacke of care, that in ſtead of hoping to be fed, he may be poyſoned? Nay rather, he is to become the more warie, the more diligent in prayer, the more exerciſed in the Scripture, that when he cometh to buy the truth he may not be deceiued.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  Truly you ſay well: onely it ſeemeth you build vpon a falſe ground (at leaſt

in the opinion of ſome,) namely, that we which are priuate men, may iudge of that which we heare, and examine it whether it be the truth or no: I deſire therefore that you would proue that point well vnto me.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               Indéed it is the opinion of poperie, that it is not for euery particular perſon of himſelfe, to examine, trie or iudge,Rhem Teſta. vpon 1. Joh. 4.1.
                   wc is true or falſe doctrine, who is a true or falſe doctor: and it is a principle in that Church,Priuate men may and ought to iudge of that which they heare. that it ſuffiſeth a commō man to giue his conſent to the church and to beleeue as the Paſtors beléeue. But all the true Miniſters of Ieſus Chriſt are of another iudgement: for howſoeuer we do vrge all reuerent reſpect to the preaching of the word, as to the ordinance of God, yet we take not vpon vs to haue dominion ouer the faith of our hearers,2. Cor. 1.24. as though we would bind them to giue credite to euery thing we ſpeake,Ambroſ. in 1. Theſſ. cap. 5.
                   by the authoritie of our name (as Ambroſe his words are) therefore becauſe we ſpeake it. And in truth there is nothing more manifeſt in Scripture then this, that the people ought iudicially to examine the doctrine taught, before they dare to entertaine it.

Paul to the Galathians ſayth thus,Gal 1.8. 
                  Though we or an Angell from heauen preach vnto you otherwiſe then that which we haue preached vnto you, let him be accurſed. Now if he wt preacheth contrary to the reuealed truth be accurſed, ſurely the caſe of him which giueth credite to him muſt needes be dangerous: and therefore for the auoydance of the danger,Rom. 14.5. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Phil. 1.10. it is meete for euery man to be fully perſwaded in his owne mind, that he may diſcerne things that differ one from another.

What can be more expreſſe then theſe teſtimonies? Let any man conſider the places and the parties to whom theſe commaundementes of taking

triall of the doctrine were directed, and he ſhall find that no one man is exempted from this dutie of examining.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  Indeed me thinketh it ſtandeth with ſome reaſon, that we ſhould trie the doctrine which we heare before we credit it:for otherwiſe we may ſoone be drawne into many errors:

No doubt we ought to be much more circumſpect in matters of doctrine, becauſe euen the beſt that teach, in that they are men may erre, and becauſe alſo in matters of that nature to be deceiued, is ſo exceeding dangerous. But all the matter is, how to iudge, and by what meanes to be able to know truth from falſhood, wholeſome from vnwholeſome doctrine.

all, that by it all controuerſies might be decided, all doubts reſolued, all hereſies confuted, all truth confirmed, euery conſcience guided, euery mans life framed. Nothing is ſound that is diſagreeing frō it, nothing vnſound that is conſonant thereunto. We are well contented to let that abſurditie dwell with the parents of it, the Papiſts: namely,Commo

Firſt of all, when you haue occaſion and oportunitie to heare, you muſt remember Salomons aduice,Eccleſ. 4.17. to take heede to your foote,
                  Pſal. 119.18. & to vſe ſome preparation before hand, praying the Lord to open your eyes, that you may ſee the wonders of his law, and that his ſpirit of truth may be with you to leade you into all truth.
                  Ioh. 16.11. Secondly, you muſt labor by all meanes, to ſubdue & ſuppreſſe the ſeeming wiſedome of your owne heart, reſoluing to yeeld vp your ſelf to whatſoeuer ye Lord reueales, though it be altogether croſſing to your

owne reaſon, and diſpleaſing to nature. For as God reſiſteth the proud,
                  1. Pet. 5.5. and maketh them which profeſſe themſelues wiſe to become fooles:
                  Rom. 1 22. 
                  ſo he will guide the meeke in iudgement, and teach the humble his way,
                  Pſal. 25.9.14. 
                  and reueale his ſecret to them that feare him. Thirdly, when you haue thus framed and fitted your ſelf by prayer and humilitie, be ſure to remember this rule eſpecially; namely, that that doctrine is the trueſt, which maketh moſt for Gods glorie, moſt for the comfort & reliefe of a wounded conſcience, moſt for the reſtraining and curbing of our corrupt nature, and fleſhly affections. Mark a litle, and I will ſhew you the reaſon of this rule. Firſt of all, the end why God made all things, was the glorie of his owne name:Prou. 16.4. the thing eſpecially aymed at by him, in that great and admirable worke the redemption of mankind, and in all the particulars of it, euen from the firſt foundation of it, his eternall election, vnto the laſt end hereof, our glorification in heauen,2. Cor. 1.29.31. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . is: That no fleſh might glorie in his preſence, but that he that glorieth might glorie in the Lord. This being then the maine end of all Gods courſes,

to kéepe the glorie of al things entire vnto himſelfe, it muſt needes be, that that doctrine is the moſt ſound, which doth not admit the leaſt empeachment of Gods glorie. Secondly, one chiefe end of the Scripture is, as to beate down man, and to cleane ſtrippe him of all goodneſſe and inclination thereunto, for the kéeping of Gods glorie whole vnto himſelf, ſo alſo to put gladneſſe into all diſtreſſed hearts,Pſal. 51.12. and to bring the ioy of ſaluation to all afflicted ſpirits.Pſal. 19.8. Dauid ſaith it is one propertie of the word of God to reioyce the heart: and Paul affirmeth that the drift of all the Scripture is,Rom. 15.4. 
                  that we through patience and comfort thereof might haue hope. So that, looke what doctrine bringeth the fulleſt comfort, to a poore ſoule when it is euen at the depth of ſorrow, that muſt néedes be wholeſome doctrine, ſéeing it concurreth with the whole ſcope of the Scripture. Thirdly, one thing principally intended, in the diſcouerie of that grace of God which bringeth ſaluation vnto all men, was,Tit. 2.11.12. 
                  Gal. 5.
                        •
                     4. 
                  that vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts ſhould be denyed, that the fleſh with the affections and luſtes ſhold be crucified, that the body

of ſinne ſhould be deſtroyed,
                  Rom. 6.6. and that mortifying our members which are on the earth,
                  Col. 3 5. we ſhould ſerue the Lord all the dayes of our life in holineſſe and righ
                        •
                     eouſneſſe before him.
                  Luk. 1.74 75. And therefore that doctrine which preſſeth vpon men, the moſt prociſe and ſtrict obedience to Gods will, not giuing any the leaſt toleration to any the ſmalleſt ſinne, but ſtill bridling mans naturall inclination vnto euill, that is the truth of God which euery ſeruant of God ought to entertaine. Tell me now, vnderſtand you this direction?
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  Yea truly, I do in ſome meaſure vnderſtand it; yet if you ſhall pleaſe by one or two examples to ſhew the vſe of it, I ſhal the better perceiue it, and know the rather how and after what ſort to apply it.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               I will not ſticke with you for that: becauſe I am very willing to ſatiſfie you in this matter. For ye firſt branch therefore touching the glorie of God, take this example. We teach at this day, that faith onely iuſtifieth: our meaning is, that the very thing, which maketh a man ſtand righteous before God, and to be accepted to life euerlaſting, is, the imputed righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus: which

righteouſneſſe is appropriated and applyed to vs onely by faith.Bellarm. de I
                        •
                     
                     ſtif. lib. 2 cap. 7.
                   Others (as the Papiſts) ſay, that to the iuſtifying of a ſinner before God, two things are required, remiſſion of ſinnes, and the habit of inward righteouſneſſe, that is to ſay, charitie with the fruites thereof. So that we exclude, they eſtabliſh the merit of mans works. Well then, in this difference of opinion, there being learned men on both ſides, and Scripture alleaged on both ſides, you deſire to know which is the truth: bring them both to the touchſtone, & ſée which of the two maketh moſt for ye glory of God, & the matter wil ſoone be anſwered, the doubt will quickly be cleared. Conſider therfore how euen the Apoſtle Paul by this rule decideth this controuerſie:Rom. 3.25.
                        •
                     . 
                  by what law (ſaith he) that is, by what meanes of ſaluation, is boaſting excluded? Not by the law of workes, but by the law of faith. Hereupon he concludeth, therefore a man is iuſtified by faith without the workes of the Lawe. And indéede the reaſon is excellent: for if man could by any of his owne doings, further his owne ſaluation, or procure the increaſe of glorie in heauen,

he had then ſome matter of glorying, and might (as it were) account himſelfe the leſſe beholden vnto God. But iuſtification by faith onely, taketh all vtterly from man, and aſcribeth his whole ſaluation, the beginning, middle, and ending vnto the Lord: haue you both an example of this rule, and warrant for it, being vſed by the Apoſtle to decide ſo great a controuerſie: and I am ſure, that you ſhall find it of very great vſe in many main points of our religion. Secondly, for the ſecond branch of the rule which is about the cō
                  fort and reliefe of a diſtreſſed and diſtracted conſcience; marke this particular for the manifeſtation of the force of the rule. It is taught and maintained in our Church, that a Chriſtian man may be vnfallibly certaine of his ſaluation in his owne conſcience in this life, and that by an ordinarie and ſpeciall faith. Others there are (both Papiſts, and ſome alſo amongſt our ſelues) which hold that the certainetie of ſaluation, which in this life can be attained to, is onely coniecturall and probable, grounded onely vpon likelihoods: and this certaintie they confeſſe to be vncertain, and

ſuch as many times doth deceiue. Behold, here is a great controuerſie, and much is ſaid on either ſide: now you that are a priuate man, would gladly know to which part you may ſafely encline, and what to reſt vpon as the alone truth in this caſe. My aduiſe is therefore, that for your full ſatiſfaction herein, you ſcan the matter by this rule: ſuppoſe a ſpirit déepely wounded, a conſcience ſet as it were vpon the racke, ſeeing nothing in God but iuſtice and maieſtie, and a conſuming fire; finding nothing in it ſelf but ſinne and corruption, and infinite matter of deſpaire, ſo that by this meanes it is brought to ſuch an exigent, that it knoweth not which way to turne, but is euen readie to crie out with Paul,Rom. 7.24. 
                  Who ſhall deliuer me? Enquire now which of thoſe two doctrines doth affoord the beſt comfort in this wofull caſe, that will quickly appeare: for the one holdeth the conſcience in a continuall ſuſpence, the other laboureth to ſettle it in the firme aſſurance of Gods vnchangeable loue in Chriſt Ieſus: the one bringeth a plaiſter, but much too litle for the ſore, telleth of the riches of Gods mercie, of the depth

of his loue, of the vnſearchable ſufficiencie of Chriſts merite, but yet denyeth the ſoule to be aſſured of a particular intereſt into it, and by that meanes rather increaſeth then relieueth the anguiſh: the other applyeth the medicine to euery part of the wound, ſheweth Chriſt, diſcouereth the riches of Chriſt, and putteth the amazed heart into a full, aſſured, and comfortable poſſeſſion of Chriſt. So that whatſoeuer ſhall be argued to the contrarie, you may be bold to build vpon that which bringeth the moſt ioyfull and welcome tidings to an affrighted conſcience: that is beſt agréeing to the ſcope of the Scripture, that cometh neareſt to the nature of the Goſpel. Come now to the third brāch, which is concerning the libertie of the fleſh, and let me giue an inſtāce of that alſo. There is at this day a doctrine, (almoſt openly taught, or at leaſt tolerated by many that ſhold teach otherwiſe) namely, that a man may do well inough, without ſo much preaching: that it is not a matter of that great neceſſitie to frequent the places of Gods publike ſeruice, but yt a body may do well inough at home, with

ſome priuate deuotions: that common men néed not trouble themſelues greatly with the ſcripture, or with knowledge in religion: that the religious ſpending of the Sabboth is a thing indifferent: that often communicating at the Lords table is not of any great importance, but that once or twiſe in a yéer is as good as euery day: that it is not good to be too forward in matters of religion, ouerſtrait in conuerſatiō: that God wil beare with many ſmal matters, &c. On the other ſide, there is a doctrine that telleth vs and proueth vnto vs, that if we deſire to walke and to liue ſo as may pleaſe God, and as becommeth Chriſtians, we muſt make conſcience of often hearing the word, we muſt as new born babes deſire the ſincere milke thereof, that we may grow thereby,
                  1. Pet. 2.2. neuer contenting our ſelues with any meaſure of knowledge: we muſt ſtriue & ſtraine our ſelues, though ſometime it be with ſome trouble and diſeaſing of our bodies, to come to ye places of Gods worſhip,Prouet. 8.33. and to giue attendance at the poſtes of the doores of the Lords houſe: we muſt call the Saboth a delight to conſecrate it,
                  Iſay 58.3. reſting not onely from labour, but from

al things that may diſable vs and make vs more vnfit for Gods ſeruice, either in reſpect of preparation before it, or of conference and meditation after it: we muſt for the ſtrengthning of our faith, and the ſolemne remēbring of the death of Chriſt oftē communicate: we muſt in our liues walk circumſpectly, with zeale & courage and openneſſe in the practiſe of religion: we muſt make conſcience of the ſmalleſt ſin, & neuer thinke we haue done enough in the duties of holy obedience. Here is againe a new queſtion, and you perhaps in ſome of theſe particulars, through the diuerſity of opiniōs, may be vnreſolued. If you demaund of me, how you may be ſtabliſhed, I refer you to this rule; ſearch & conſider which of the two tendeth moſt directly to the yoking & hampering and reſtraining of mans natural diſpoſition: that wil ſoone appéere, if you look out into the world, & hearken how theſe doctrines are entertained: for the former, who ſo ſhall teach it, or ſéeme to approue it, no doubt that man ſhal haue many followers and many fauorers: for doth not euery man almoſt like it & wiſh it, that there ſhould be leſſe preaching? that it ſhould

be free to ſpend the Sabboth, euery one as himſelfe liſteth? to receiue the Communion when men think good? to neglect knowledge? to baniſh ye Bible out of their houſes, or elſe to let it ly like old harneſſe ruſting for lacke of occupying? wil it not by and by be receiued, that it is not good for men to be preciſe, to be ouer ſcrupulous, to ſtand too nicely vpon points? Surely he that ſhold teach this, I might ſay of him as the Prophet ſpake of old,Micah 2.11 
                  He were a Preacher for the people. But now for the other doctrine, ſee what an acceptation it hath in the world: fie vpon it will one ſay, what a tedious thing is this to heare ſo many ſermons, what a trouble to come ſo often to the Church, what a miſery to be reſtrained from our ſunday-ſports, what a dull time wil it be and how long will the day ſeeme if thus we be limited? what need ſo many communions? what ſhold men be ſo hot and earneſt in religiō? if this once take place, farewell all mirth, farewell all good company, adieu to all thriuing, if this be hearkned vnto. This is and will be the entertainment of this doctrine: it will be reputed as the Prophets ſermons were

of old, euen the Burden of the Lord. So by the generall yéelding or gaineſaying of the multitude, it may ſoone appeare which of the two is the greateſt enemy to the fleſh: and therefore you both may and muſt conclude with the latter doctrine, that that is from aboue, becauſe it meeteth with our corruption at euery turne, and is ſtill beating it downe, labouring to keepe it within compaſſe. And by this rule (to gaine it the more credit) Paul tooke vp the queſtion among the Galathians, touching the vſe of Chriſtian libertie, ſetting it downe for a ground, that it is then beſt vſed when it is not vſed as an occaſion to the fleſh,
                  Gal. 5.13. but with a holy reſpect to become ſeruants each to other by loue. Thus I haue (for your better vnderſtanding) giuen you an example of euery branch of this rule, that you may know how to apply it; aſſuring you out of mine own poore experience, that there are very few of the fundamentall points of religion, which directly concerne the worſhip of God, or our conuerſation with men, but they may receiue their triall by this Canon, and may truly be ſayed to ſtand or fall,

according to the iudgement and verdict thereof.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  I thanke you vnfainedly for this direction; yet touching this latter branch, it ſeemeth to me that there may be ſome doubt made, becauſe the popiſh religion is thought to reſtraine and puniſh the fleſh more then ours: for it impoſeth many very ſtraite things and vnpleaſing, as faſting, penance, going barefoote, pilgrimage, payings of money, to purchaſe prayers when men are dead, and diuers the like: I pray you therefore cleare me in this onely doubt, and then I am ſatiſfied.
               
            
            
               Epap.
               I ſay in one word of all theſe, as Paul did of things very like,Col 2.23. 
                  They haue indeede a ſhew of wiſedome in voluntarie religion, and humbleneſſe of mind, and in not ſparing the bodie: but yet another way they giue greater libertie: for when it is taught that theſe things are meritorious, and of worth to do away many ſinnes, what will not a man be content to do, for a wéeke or an houre, or a ſhort time, for the remouing of the ſinnes of his whole life? and who will not be content when he is dying,

to giue all that away which hee muſt needs leaue behind, for the deliuery of his ſoule from a ſuppoſed purgatory? Who wold not go an hundred miles on pilgrimage to the ſhrine of ſuch or ſuch a ſaint, to be aſſured that it ſhal be his diſcharge for the remainder of his life? So that though theſe bodily impoſitions may ſeeme ſomething ſtraite one way, yet they giue trebble libertie another way, and therefore may truly be ſayd, rather to be an occaſion to the fleſh, then to li-limit the corruption of the fleſh.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  It is very true; for what will a man feare to do, ſo long as he is taught, and by teaching perſwaded, that by almes-deeds and faſting (falſly ſo called) and ſome legacies bequeathed to religious vſes (as they terme them) or by conformitie to the penall iniunctions of a prieſt, he may make ſufficient ſatisfaction? therefore I hold this for anſwer enough to that obiection.
               
            
            
               Epaph.
               Well neighbor, to let that paſſe, & to follow the motion which you made, I muſt to ye former rule adde one thing, which is this: Take heed by all meanes of ſuch eares as the Apoſtle calleth itching eares,
                  2. Tim. 4.3. and of delighting to get an heap

of teachers. It is a dangerous humor to affect variety of inſtructors, and it muſt needs cauſe diſtraction: it filleth mens heads with a world of idle queſtions, & draweth them into vaine iangling.
                  1 Tim. 1.6. It is Satans policy as long as he can to hold men in ignorance, and in the contempt or neglect of knowledge: when he cannot preuaile that way, but men will liſten to inſtruction, then he will endeuor to buſie them with prophane fables and vaine bablings, which breed queſtions,
                  1. Tim 1 4. Chap 6.20. 
                  rather then that godly edifying which is by faith: that ſo he may withdraw their thoughts, and ſteale away their hearts from thoſe things which ought principally to be looked vnto. Eſpecially remember the aduice of Paul to his ſonne Timotheus,
                  2 Timoth. 3.14. 
                  Continue thou in the things which thou haſt learned and art perſwaded thereof, knowing of whom thou haſt learned them. Note the place. The Apoſtle preſſeth a ſtiffe and firme continuance in truths receiued, whē as theſe two things concurre therewith; a mans owne perſwaſion; and the conſideration of thoſe which firſt taught vs. Firſt, for a mans owne perſwaſion, I pray you to obſerue

it, leſt I ſhould ſéeme in ſtéed of grounded ſetledneſſe, to commend ſelfe-willed péeuiſhnes. By being perſwaded, Paul meaneth thus much, as if he had ſayd to Timothy, If it be an opinion which thou haſt not ſodainly entertained, but vpon good aduice, if it hath ſeated it ſelfe in thy iudgement then when as thou with care & conſcience, with humilitie, with vſing the ordinary means, with prayer vnto God, with heartie deſire to be guide
                        •
                      in the truth haſt enquired after knowledge, ſurely thou oughteſt not, being by theſe degrees brought vnto it, and in this maner perſwaded in it, raſhly and ſodainly to forgo it. This is that which is meant by perſwaſion in this place. A ſetledneſſe of iudgement, following vpon an orderly courſe to bring a man thereunto. The ſecond thing that muſt concurre, is the conſideration of the parties of whom we haue learned: as if Paul had ſayd, Obſerue and marke well what kind of men they are, by whoſe miniſtery thou haſt bene inſtructed; if they be men, who by their fidelity in teaching, and by the bleſſing of God vpon their labors, in vſing their miniſtery to conuert mens ſoules, do cary with them the

ſeale of their miniſtery; nay if thine owne conſcience can witneſſe for them either of theſe out of thine owne feeling, then beware of a contrary doctrine: though I would not haue thee tie thy ſelfe to any mans authoritie, yet be well aduiſed before thou alter thy iudgement confirmed by ſuch a miniſterie. This was Pauls meaning: and if you care to follow it, you ſhall in experience find it good counſell. Thus I haue acquainted you with the beſt courſe I know as yet, both for the firſt informing, and the after-ſetling of your iudgement in Gods truth.
            
            
               Nymph.
               
                  I pray God to enable me by his holy ſpirit, both to remember and to practiſe this your good aduice. I will now make this onely requeſt: you know it is not inough to be a man of knowledge, vnleſſe a man do with knowledge ioyne obedience. If you know theſe things (ſaith our Sauiour) bleſſed are yee if you do them.
                  
                  Iohn 13.17. 
                  Wherefore as you haue taught me how to heare profitably for the gayning of knowledge, ſo I pray you direct mee how I may make good vſe of hearing for the gouernement of my life.
               
            
            
               
               Epaph.
               
                  How to draw things heard into practiſe.In the firſt place therefore remember, as to pray to be guided into all truth by the ſpirit of truth, ſo to begge of God to direct the Preachers tongue, that he may ſpeak vnto your conſcience, and that his ſermons may be as a glaſſe, in which you may behold the very true eſtate of your owne ſoule. Secondly, labour to put away from you that which Salomon calleth a froward heart,
                  Prouerb. 17.
                        ••
                     . that is, a heart that cannot beare reproofe: remember it wel, and think ſeriouſly vpon it,Prou. 9.8. that there can be no greater teſtimony of true wiſedome then to loue him that rebuketh you: and therupon reſolue with your ſelfe beforehand, that whatſoeuer is ſpoken againſt your ſin, be it neuer ſo tart or vnpleaſing,Iames 1.21. yet you will receiue it with all meekneſſe, and eſteeme it as a precious oyle.
                  Pſalm 141.5. Thirdly, in hearing, endeuour when the Preacher hauing layed the grounds of his doctrine cometh to application, to obſerue what is ſpoken by way of exhorting, what by way of reproofe, what with an intent to miniſter comfort: each point being referred to theſe heads, ſhall much the better be remembred. Fourthly, when you are departed

from the ſermon, forget not to find a time as ſoone as is poſſible, whileſt things heard are moſt freſh, in which to commune with your owne heart,
                  Pſalme. 77 6. Luke. 2.19. and to ponder, and ſcanne, and ſearch diligently thoſe things which were deliuered. This is that which we call meditation, an exerciſe which Dauid exceedingly delighted in: it is the ſame to the mind,Pſalm. 119.97. that digeſtion is to the body: that which we heare is by it made our owne, ſo that the ſoule receiueth nouriſhment thereby. Now in the practiſe of this dutie, it is good to conſider what things are preſently neceſſary, and what otherwiſe. Thoſe things which are of preſent vſe,Pſalme 119.10
                        •
                     
                   are eftſoones to be layed hold vpon, and a certaine ſecret oath is to be made betwéene God and a mans owne ſoule,Verſ. 16. 
                  to make haſt and not to delay a ſpeedy and diligent executiō: yea though the dutie inioyned be both in ſhew painfull, and an enemy to worldly profit, an abridger of carnall delight, and a meanes by all likelihood to darken eſtimation and credit amongſt men. If it be a matter of ſpirituall conſolation, or of prouocation and incoragement to perſiſt in a good duty, it muſt be reputed as a

chearing from heauen, and heart (as we ſay) to be taken thereby againſt all, either inward aſſaults or outward diſcouragements whatſoeuer. As for other points, which may ſeeme not to be of ſo preſent vſe, they are not to be neglected,Pſalme 119 11. Prouerbs 4.21. but to be hidden and kept in the middeſt of the heart, that they may not be to ſeeke when the Lord ſhall offer occaſion to employ them. You muſt do in this caſe as you do in houſehold matters: if you find an implement which you know not how forthwith to beſtow, you will ſay, it is pitty to caſt it away, it will be no charge to keepe it, once in ſeuen yeares it may ſerue for a purpoſe, for the which you would be loth to lacke it: ſo though ſome things which you heare, are not (as may ſeeme) preſently needfull, yet you muſt make conſcience ſafely to preſerue them, becauſe a time of vſe may come hereafter, in which, as it would be a griefe to want direction, ſo the Lord (it may be) may then in iuſtice deny that, which formerly being offered was entertained with contempt. In a word, looke to it that you be well furniſhed for all occaſions,

and know it to be the chiefe duty, and the eſpeciall marke of a good Chriſtian, to take heed,
