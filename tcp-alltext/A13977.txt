               yng of auncient wryters, that it hath ben the custome of the greatest Estates and Princes in the worlde, when they haue had inter mission frō the serious and weightie affayres of their Realmes, to bestowe their ydell tymes in reuoluyng and pervsyng stories. For we reade that Artaxerxes, surnamed Longimanus, the fyfte kyng of Persia, vsed to haue the Chronacles, bothe of his predecessours and of his own tyme, also read before him a nightes when he went to rest. And Alexander the greate, 
                  •…
               ad that noble wryter of the famous battell of Troye in such veneration, that he neuer went any wher, but he had his workes about him, nor neuer slept, but that he had thē vnder his pyllowe. Moreouer comyng into a schole, and fyndyng not Homers workes ther, he gaue the Master a buffet with his fyste: Meanyng thereby that ye knowledge of Histories was a thyng so necessary to all estates and degrees, that it was an offence to be

without them. For like as in Musike many notes and many tunes make one concent and one Harmonie: so also in an History, the varietie and multitude of examples, tend all to one ende, that is, thaduauncement of Vertue, and the defacyng of Vyce. Offryng thēselues as a moste clere and perfect myrror, wher in for a man to behold, I say not the outwarde portrayture and lineamentes of his bodye, but the very lyuely Image and expresse figur of his inward mind enstructyng him how to gwyde and order hymselfe in all things. For what can be a greater enforcemēt to cheualrie, then not barely to hear, but in a maner presently to behold the sage and graue consultaciōs of expert Captaynes? the spedie puttyng in practise of things deuised? the pollicies & stratagenies in executyng of them? the fauorable assistence of fortune to the same, with the fame and renowne of valiant enterprises? what can be a greater encouragement to Vertue? then to se men raised from lowe and base degre (as it wer out of the dust) vnto high estate & honor? to se Realmes florish? to see common welthes prosper? to se good mē exalted & euil mē suppressed to se peace and tranquillity obserued? to se Nacions willingly offer their obediens? to se lōg continuāce in felicity? wt honorable report & wishyng for after ye decease? On the contrary part, what cā be a greater

dehortacion from vice, then to haue laid before ones eyes not only the heynousnesse and enormitie of the offence? but also the miseries, calamities, shames and punishmentes worthely ensewyng vpon the same? with endlesse reproch and infamie after death? and so consequentlie what can be more commodious and profitable then an Historye? Agayne, what can be more pleasant, or more to the satisfying and contentacion of mannes nature (which is alwayes desirous of newes and couetous of knowledge) then syttyng quietly by himself, to receiue tydings of thyngs done through the whole world? to behold the places, the persons, the tymes, and the thyngs with thorder and circumstances in doyng of the same? to se so many rū nyng streames? so many high montaynes, so many ragyng seas? so many wylde forests and deserts, so many straunge beastes, fowles, fyshes, serpents, herbes and trees? so many large contries? so many rich and populous Cyties? so many welgouerned cōmon wealthes? so many good lawes and customes? and so many sundry sortes of people? togyther with the natures, disposicions, effectes, descriptions, situacions, cōmodities, pleasures and displeasures, foundacions, continuances and decayes, beginnynges, procedynges and endynges of the same? and that in such sort as euery thing may seme, not to be reported, but to be present

ly in doyng? Now at such tyme as I had finished my translacion of thistories of Iustine (who in so small roume and in so fewe wordes, comprehendeth so many and so notable thynges, that it is to be doubted, whether he be more brief of sentence, or copious of matter) as I stayed with my selfe (as it were to take breath at thend of my race) deuisyng to whome I might specially dedicate the same: It came to my remembraunce, that sithens it had pleased Almighty God, to take to his mercy your Lordships noble father, (to whom I had long before vowed this my tra uell) there was not any, who eyther of dutie mighte more iustly clayme the same. or for whose estate it semed more requisite and necessarie, or of whome I thought it should be more fauorably accepted, then of your honor. For (to omit other things, wherof this tyme and matter serueth not to speake) it is not vnknowen to others, and I haue had experience therof myself, howe earnest a desire your honor hath natu rally graffed in you, to read, peruse, and cōmunicate with others, as well the Histories of auncient tyme, and thynges done long ago, as also of the present estate of thinges in oure dayes, and that not withoute a certayn pregnancie of witte and rypenesse of vnderstandyng: The which do not only now reioyse the hartes of all such as beare faithfull affection to thonorable

house of your auncestours, but also stirre vp a greate hope and expectacion of such wysedom and experience in you in time to come, as is mete and besemyng for so noble a race. To the furtherāce wher of (because I will not be ouer taedious in wordes) I will briefly propound vnto your L. no mo but twoo examples, which are mencioned among many other of like purport in this boke. Thone is of the valiant Epaminondas Prince of Thebe, who beyng an expert Captayn and politike in all Martial feates and warlike affaires, was neuerthelesse so well lerned, that it was a wonder to se howe a man bredde, and broght vp in Philosophy, should come by such knowledge in feates of Armes, or howe a man accustomed to the licentious libertie of the Campe, should reteyne suche exquisite knowledge in Philosophie, with vnspotted innocencie of lyuynge and conuersacion: whose fortune was suche (by the consente of all wryters) that the strength, the glory, and the renowme of his countrie, dyd bothe ryse with him and dye with him. Thother example is of Arymba kyng of Epyre, who beyng very yong at the decease of his father, was by the aduise and consente of the whole Realme, duryng his nouage, sente to Athenes to be enstructed in Learnyng and in Phylosophie. At hys returne then into his owne Realme agayne,

he chose him a sage and graue counsell, created officers, made good lawes, abrogated euil customes, and finally so stablished the state of the common welthe, that he semed to haue made the Realme new. And looke howe much he was better lerned then his auncestors, so much the story reporteth him to haue ben the better beloued and honoured of his subiects. Let these and such other examples (where your L. shall fynde store in this worke) encourage youre tender yeres, runnyng in the renoumed fotesteppes of your famous auncestours, to procede in learning and vertue (which are thonly ornamentes of nobilitie, or rather the very true nobilitie it self,) ī such sort as you may be able to doe acceptable seruice to your Prince and your countrie, Your Prince and your countrie for your weldoyngs embrace you and esteme you as a Iewell, and Yourself thereby become equall to any of your worthye Predecessours in aduauncyng thonor of your noble house: wherof as your greate forwardnesse geueth assured hope and expectacion, so I moste hartely beseche Almighty God to further, augment, establish, and confirmate the same in your L. with thabundaunce of his grace.
            
               Your L. humble Seruaunt,
Arthur Goldyng.
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               COnsydering ther is not a more precious Iewell geuen vs of God then tyme: and that nothynge reioyseth a mans mynde more then the remembraunce of the well spendynge, nor any thinge more greueth, then the remembraunce of the ydle & vaine bestowynge therof: It ought to be the chiefe regarde and indeuoure of all men, in suche wyse to employ the same, as maye most redownd to the vtilitie of others, (for the which intent we be chiefely borne into this worlde) to thaduauncement of Uertue, and to the purchasing towarde themselues a laudable name and monument of their well doynges. To aspire vnto the whiche, we se it hath be
                  •…
                and is the studie and trauell of all good and vertuous men: some by doyng thynges thēselues wherby others myght take good ensample, & some by puttyng thactes of other men in writyng, to the profit and cōmoditie of suche as shulde come after. Wherin albeit the trauell be not lyke of the wryter and of the dooer: yet thone deserueth not muche lesse cōmendacion then thother. For lyke as their could haue ben no Historiographer, if noble actes and enterprises had not ben atcheued: so if no man shulde haue put suche dedes in wryting, besydes that the fame of the dooers shulde after a whyle haue vtterlie ben condemned to obliuion, the frutifull example of their doynges, (whiche nowe remaineth to posteritie) must also nedes haue perished. Therfore are we not a lytell beholdyng to Chronaclers, as to them

that are the guydes, instructours, and maisters of oure lyfe: by whome we are not onelye admonished of oure duties: but also by euident and playne demonstracions tolde before, and as it were pointed to with the fynger, what we ought to eschewe, what we ought to doo, and in what maner to enterprise and bring euery thyng to effect, as may be most to the praise and be hoofe of the dooer. In suche wise annexing and enterlacinge, pleasure, varietie, and delectacion, with vtilitie and profit, that I can not deuise how a man shuld lightly fele any wearinesse. Howbeit euen as the cōmoditie is great if we reade and peruse Histories aduisedly: so it nothyng auayleth, if we purpose not to put in vre thxamples of the true & vndistayned vertue lefi in thē for the rereformatiō of our liues. For lyke as whē a mā cōmeth into a goodly Garden plentifully replenished with all kinde of holsome herbes, sweete Flowers, and pleasant noryshyng fruites, if he neither gather of the herbes and flowers, nor tasteth of the fruites, but runneth vp and down negligētly, feding his eyes with the vaine sight and beholdyng of them onely, he taketh neyther benefite nor pleasure of the same: Euen so if a man reade ouer Histories, not myndynge to put then samples in practise, but onely contenteth himselfe with the pleasauntnesse of thenditing, or with the straungenes and varietie of the matters, he loseth his labo
                  •…
               r and misspendeth his lyfe. Neither is there any difference betwene such a one, and him that looketh vpon his owne ymage in a glasse, the whiche he forgetteth assoone as his backe is turned. For all our lyfe consisteth wholly in vertuous act
                  •…
               s & exercises: the residue thero befing otherwise misspent, differing nothyng at al from deth.

Diuerse noble personages therfore, (as well for ye worthynesse and excellencie of the worke, as to thentent to wynne double honour, and therby to gyue good Ensample to suche as shulde come after, to contend by the lyke industrie to aspire to the lyke glorie and renown,) haue not onely done noble feates and aduentures them selues, but also put in writyng as wel their own dedes as the doynges of other men. Iuba king of Mauritanie made a Collection of Thistories of sundrie Nacions: Iulius Caesar compiled his owne actes. Trogus Pō

Thabridgement of whose woorkes, gathered oute by Iustine (who partely by his owne industrie, but more by the decay and losse of his Aucthor Trogus, obteined the name of a famous Historiographer) I haue translated out of Latin into English, thoughe not so eloquently as a nōbre could hau
                  •…
                done: yet (I trust) accordyng to the true sence and meanynge of Thaucthor: wherin albeit I maye seeme to iome, to haue taken in hand a vaine and friuolous trauell, namely to put forth that thyng in rude Englisshe whiche is written in good & pure Latin: Yet notwithstandynge (as well for thauoydyng of Idlenes the Mother & nourissher of al vice, as also for the zeale I beare to this my natiue countrie, desyrous to gratifie yea and to profite suche as haue not vnderstandinge in the Latin tong yf I coulde) I haue not stopped my race, vntyll suche tyme as I had atteined to the finall scope of my prepensed purpose: folowynge the Ensample of diuers wyse and well learned, both of old tyme and also of our

age of all sortes of Nacions, whose studie and trauell hath alwayes ben to bryng into their mother tongue, such workes as they founde eyther in the Greke (the head and welspryng of all Philosophie, connyng and lernyng) or in any other language, worthy to be knowē and had in memory. And in lyke maner as oftentymes beautifull and welfauored persones, turned out of their gorgeous apparell & costly attyre, into simple raiment, doe lyke the beholders as well as they dydde in theire gayest garmentes: Euen in lyke wyse (I trust) it may so comme to passe, that this my rude translation voyd of ornate termes and eloquent indityng, may (as it were) in his playne and homely English cote, be as well accepted of the fauorable reader, as when it were richely clad in Romayn vesture: consyderyng that the valewe an estimacion of Thistory, is no more abased thereby, then should the vertue of a precious stone, by settyng it in brasse or yron, or by carying it in a closur of Leather. If any errours haue escaped me in the doyng herof (as I doe not thynke, but that some thynges worthie to be corrected, may haue escaped my hande, I desyre the lerned Reader, as well to admonishe me frendly of myne errour, as also to put his helpyng hand to thamendmēt of the same. In doyng wherof as he shal greatly benefyte others, so let him assure himself, he cannot doe me a greater pleasure, nor a higher frendshippe. And thus wishyng that my trauell and labour in doyng hereof, may turne to thy commoditie and profyte, I bid the, Fare well.

For in lyke ma ner as at a greate and sumptuous feaste, that is furnyshed with al kynde of deynties and delicate viandes, it commeth to passe that one thing is set before one man, another to another, fewe taste of one thing, euery man of that he lyketh best, the r

                led by fancie or stayed by iudgement, so doth he deeme of his owne lyfe, and of other mennes: yet there is but one onelye pathwaye of vertue, in the whyche

who so walketh aduisedly, is only to be counted to liue wel. All others, like as they did at the sumptuous feast, when al thynges prouoke them, beynge able neyther in their owne lyfe, nor yet in another mannes at any time to fynd what is best to folow, or howe to procede. But if nature haue geuen any thyng to man, the whiche he maye vse or abuse at hys pleasure, certesse he ought most circumspectely to vse this. But I pray you what man is there almost, that applyenge the rule of vertue vnto all sayenges and doynges, aswell of his owne as of other mennes, doth with more aduisement aduenture vpon them, then vpon the daintye dishes, set before him on the table: or which thynketh not hym selfe sufficiently learned in this behalfe? In the whiche thinge it is awonder to see, howe sore men deceyue them selues, whiles they imagine that the bare hystory, is of it self able enough to enstruct the reader, whereas in dede it doth no more but minister matter to learne vpon, offeryng it selfe to all vses accordynge as the person is affectioned, in lyke case as doth the feast. For some we see haue none other delyght but only in the reading, who sekyng no more but that only one delectation, do loose all thother goodly and pleasaunte fruites thereof. Such men gayne nothyng more by the readyng of an Historye, than they that playe vpon a harpe or a lute to driue away the time, as a man would saye, to passe ouer the troublesomnesse of the tyme present, shortlye after to enter into a greater and more troublesome conflycte wyth them selues. For it is no pleasure that hath no respect vnto vertue. Othersome the glyttering glosse of glory so much pricketh forward, and (which in other matters is vnstablenessof minde) to no purpose transformeth, that they thynke nothynge to great for theym, nor nothynge to

to condemne glory yf none be offered, or if it accompany thē not to be proud and arrogant therfore. And although that none but fooles▪ will go about to aspire to the lyke glorye without the like vertue, yet notwithstanding we see some, which for none other cause but that they haue read the noble actes of others, do thinke them selues hyghe wyse men, and take muche vppon theym, lyke vnto players of Tragedies, whiche when they haue put of thapparell, wherein they played the partes of moste noble personage, do also counterfeyte them in countenance and behauiour. There are also, and those not a fewe, whyche delyghte onelye in strannge thinges and wonders, menne of vulgare and rude vnderstandynge, who after the maner of thunskylfull people, oftentimes make more of a mannes gaye cote, than of the person him selfe, and more of the outwarde shewe than of the worke. So wonderfull a power hath an Historye, to worke in the mindes of the Readers. Nowe, whereas it is the chiefest poynt that belongeth to an Historye, to styrre vp the minde of man from slouthfulnesse, and to fence it agaynste all daungers: and that the strengthe of examples, (then the whych there is nothynge of greater force to perswade and disswade) inespecially tendeth to that ende and purpose, it commeth to passe through the carelesse securitye of men, (beleuing that other mennes perilles perteyne nothyng to them selues) that such thinges as are most worthy of remembraunce, are hearde and reade with deaffe and stopped eares. Finallye there be (whiche a man woulde not beleue) that transgresse euen agaynst the very same parte, that conteineth most graue and serious matters as though thinges should be wrytten, not as they were done in dede, but as they ought to haue bene done. Therefore partely by meanes of that careles securitye, and partlye by meanes of that surfet of rashe and vnaduised readynge, it commeth to passe, that euen as it were of corrupt humours, a certayne

                  •…
               , there commeth no profite at all to vs of our reading.
            I thinke you maye now perceyue, howe the maner of readyng Hystories, and of looking vpon a mannes lyfe, is well nye all one. And the greatest difficultie is this. I mean the peruersenesse of our owne iudgement, which causeth vs to be driuen, not that way that the examples oughte to beare greatest sway of them selues, but that way that our mynde is moste enclined and bent vnto. This is also another, and of no lesse force than thother aforesayde, that writeth do in such wise set forth things, that they not only seke to be wel liked, but also (folowing as it were the taste of their owne mouthes) lyke as they were forgers of it them selues, geue theyr iudgement and verdite vppon matters, extollynge some thynges with hygh commendacions, as though they would haue all other men to like those thinges, which they most fancied them selues. The which thing, yf so be it they dyd it without colour, it were easier to consente or dissente therefro. But nowe in lykewise, as Cookes haue oftentymes more regard to the belly, then to their maysters commoditie and profite: euen so I would God that the wryters of Hystories, for the most part, sought not so muche to please and entice the Reader. Therefore by two meanes are wee led awrye: that is to saye, by our owne iudgement, and by the forespeakyng of the writers, as by them that write not matters playnely and sincerely. For an Historiographer is but an interpretour of thinges done: with whose iudgemēt (it there be any fault therein) it standeth in like case, as whē a piece of wine, that of it selfe beinge good, pleasaunte, and beawtifull, doth eyther take an euill talent of the Caske, or els is other wyse marred, by minglyng some other thynge with yt, the whiche is eyther a shamefull and intollerable

               
                  〈◊〉
               , or els a poynt of extreme folly and ignoraunce. It ys to be sene by this one example, what matter the iudgement of the wryter maketh. A man of rawe aduisement, that attributeth the bryngyng to passe of great matters to mannes pollicie, although that by the determinacion of so many thinges, he prove him selfe a lyar, yet he casteth men into a great follye: as whose knowledge (do the beste they can) beyng scarse able to wey and consider accordinglye, the thinges that lye before theyr eyes, theyr power and strēgth not much excedyng the litle wormes, because of one prosperous successe, rashely taketh vppon it the rule of the whole world. But such a man as is otherwyse enformed, teaching that thinges are in deede put in execution by the pollicye of man, but yet ruled and gouerned by the prouidence of God deliuereth men both from folly, and also from another mischiefe as great as that, whiche is supersticion. By the resydue, such as be good men (whose study is altogether employed about matters apperteynyng to God) oughte to knowe what difference there is betwene eche of theym, and what theyr dutye is. I geue this warning first of all for this purpose, that forasmuch as I am of opinion, that suche kinde of Authours are to be read, and yt were for nothynge els but for the great aboundeunce of examples that they entreate of, yong men should also thinke this, howe circumpectelye and carefully they ought to be read, consideryng how great fruytes or discommodities are in them propounded. For it happeneth in lyke case to such as ymagine that in Hystorys may be read ouer lightly, or the life to be passed ouer vnaduisedly, without thexacte obseruing and executyng of a mannes duetye: as it doth to men of the countrey, whyche in the sackyng of a citie come to the ryffling of some Apothecaries of Grocers shoppe, plenteouslye furnyshed with al thynges belongyng to the crafte, and beyng allured with the swetenesse of the confections and spices which they chaunce first to laye their handes on, thynking all the residue to be of the same sorte, do eate suppe, deuour, cramme in, and lycke vp

all that comes to hand, in such wise that some fal sicke, some runne madde, some dye out of hand, and euery one of them be maruaylou

               ye distempered, so that all the armye laugh them to skorne for their labour. For euen as the life is full of commodities and discommodities, euen so is an hystorye which is the ymage and representacion of the life. And the wysedome of the life consisteth onely in the vsage of the lyfe. Farewell, & enioye these thinges to thy most furtheraunce and commoditye.

               WHereas many of the Romaines euen such as were of the state of Consuls, had put thactes of the Romaynes in writing, both in Greeke, and also in other straunge language. Trogus Pompeius a man of aunciente eloquence, whether it were for desyre of lyke renowne and glory, or for pleasure that he hadde in the varietie and straungenesse of the worke, compiled as well the hystories of the Grekes, as the Histories of al the whole world besides, in the Lating toūg to thentent, that as our Chronicles are redde in Greeke, so the Chronicles of the Greekes myght be red in our toung also. Wherein he enterprysed a piece of worke of great payne both to bodye and mynde. For seyng that many Authours, which haue taken vpon them to put in writing the doinges of some one kynge, or of some one peculiar kynd of people, do thynke theym selues to haue taken a matter of great weyght in hand, may we not wrothelye thynke Pompeius to haue bene as bolde as Hercules, that durst aduenture vpon the whole world, in whose bookes are conteyned the doinges of all ages, of all Kynges, of all nacions, and of all contreyes? And those thinges that the Greeke Chroniclers haue entreated vpō disorderly, as euery man thought moste conueniente for hym selfe, all the same thynges hath Pompeius (plaring them in theyr tymes, and settyng them in due order) compyled in Hystorye, omittyng all such thinges as were not profytable to be spoken of. Therfore of these xliiii. volumes, (for so many dyd Pompeye set forth) by leasure durynge the tyme that I was in the Cytie, I drewe out all

            And looke howe much the weather was harder in Scithia then in Egypt, so much were the Scithians harder of body and of nature than the Egiptians. But if the world which is nowe deuided in partes, were sometyme al one, whether water at the first beginning ouerwhelmed all the earthe, or els fyre possessed all thynges, whereof also the worlde it selfe was made, the Scithians in both of theym must nedes be the auncienter.

And the soner that any place was dryed vp, the sonner it began to engender liuing creatures. Furthermore Scithia is so much bigger than al other countreyes, that al the riuers that spryng there, do fall into the sea Maeotis, and from thence into the sea of Pontus, and so into the Aegiptian sea.

For if ye haue respect vnto the king, ye may praise his riches, but not his good guidans or know ledge requisite in a Captain, of which there was so greate aboundaunce in his realme, that when riuers were not able to finde his huge multitude drinke, yet had he treasure more then could be spent. He would be sure to be the laste that shoulde come to encounter, and the firste that shoulde run away. In danger he was fearful, out of daunger proud and ful of bosting. Finally before he should come to the triall of battell, he gloried so much in his owne strength, that as if he had beene euen a Lord ouer nature, and had beene able to rule it at his pleasure, he broughte mountaynes to plaine ground, and filled vp the valleis, made bridges ouer the sea, and cut through the main land to make nerer way for his shippes to passe. Whose comming into Grece as it was terrible, so his departure was as shameful and dishonorable. For when that Leonides kinge of the Sartanes wyth four thousand men, had taken the strengthe of Thermopyle, Xerxes in disdaine of his small noumber, commaunded that none shoulde assaile them, but they whose kinsfolke were slain at the battel of Marathon: the which while they soughte to reuenge the deathes of their frends, wer the beginning of the slaughter that ensued.
            In their places succeded stil mo and mo, to the great encrease of their owne slaughter. Three daies the Persians fought there to their greate anguish, displesure and sorow, The fourth daye when it was tolde Leonides that twentye thousande of his ennemies had taken the toppe of the hill, then he began to exhort his partakers to depart, and to reserue them selues till some better time might come, wherin

they might do seruice to their country, for he & hys Spartanes wold stād to thaduēture of fortune, saying that he set not so much by his life, as by his country, & that the resi due ought to be spared for the defice of Grece, whē the kin ges plesure was published, the rest departed all sauing the Lacedemonians which taried stil with him. In the beginning of this war, whé counsel was asked of apollo at Delphos, answer was geuē that either the king of thes partanes must be slain, or els the city be destroid. And therfore whē the king Leonides shuld go forth to the war, he had so encoraged his souldiers, that euery man went with a willing hart to dyeThe loue of Leonidas towarde hys country. with their maister. He tooke the straites for this purpose, that with his small nōber, he might either win with more honor, or die with les domage to the cōmō welth: wherfore when he had dismissed his partakers, he exhorted the Spar tanes to remēber thē selues, that how so euer they fought they must be slaine, warning them to take hede, that they gaue no cause to baue it reported of them hereafter, that their harts serued them better to tary, then to fight, saying that it was not for thē to stand stil til their enemies should enclose them about, but assone as night shoulde serue their turn, to set vpō their enemies, making mery without care in their tēts. For conquerors could no where die more honorably, then in the camp of their enemies. It was no hard matter to perswade thē that wer al redy bent to die. Forth with they armed them selues, & being but vi. C. men in all,The noble prowesse of Lconida and the Spartāes brake into the cāp of v. C.

The Lacedemonians when they could not find the king, ranged through all the camp like cōquerors, slaying & throwing down al things, as men that knew that they fought not in hope of victory, but to reuēge their own death. The battel was prolonged frō the beginning of the nighte, vntill the more parte of the next day was spent. At the last not vanquished, but wery of vanquishing they fell

down dead amōg the heapes of their dead ennemies. Xerxes hauing receiued two iosses in battell on the land, entended to try his fortune. But Themistocles the captain of the Atheniens, when he vnderstode that the Ion

M. men to Delphos, to spoil the tēple of apollo: as though he had made warre not only with the Grekes, but euen with the gods immortal, which bād of men was vtterly destroid with tempest & lightnynge, to thentent he might vnderstande that the more that God is wroth & displesed with man, the lesse power or rather none at all hath man against god. After this he burned the cities of Thespie, Plate & Athens: but ther wer no men in them, & because he could not haue the men to kil in his displesure he wreked his teme vpon their houses. For the Athenies after the battel of Barathon by the counsell of Themistocles, which gaue the warning that victory won of the Persians was not at end, but rather a cause of greater warre,) made them a flcte of two hundred shippes.

                Xerxes was comming toward them, they asked counsell of the Oracle at Delphos, wher it was aunswered that they must prouide for their sauegard in wodden walles.
            
               Themistocles deming it to be spoken and ment of shippes. perswaded all the people that their Countrye was not theThemistocles interpre teth the same walles, but the men: and that the Citye was not the houses and buildinges, but the Citizens and inhabitauntes. Wherfore it was better for them and more for theyr safegard, to betake them selues to shippes, then to abyde in the towne, whervnto God himself semed to counsel them. The counsell was well liked, and thervpon abandoning the Citye, they conueyed their wiues and children with all theyr preciousest stuffe and iewels into secrete Ilands, and there bestowed them in safety, whiche beinge doone, they armed them selues and tooke shipping. Other Cities also folowed the example of the Atheniens. Therfore when all the whole fiete of their complices and parrakers were assembled together in the narow seas by the Ile of Salamine, to thentent they mighte not be enclosed of Xerxes greate multitude, as they were consulting how to maintaine the warres vpon the sea, sodenly sprang a variaunce betwene the princes of the Cities, euery man deuising how to breake vp priuely, & to steale home to defend his own. Themistocies fearing least by the departure of his Companions, his strength shoulde be abated, sent woorde vnto Xerxes by a trustye seruaunte,The deuise of Themistocles to make his confederates abyde that now was the time that he myght easly take al Grece together in one place, wheras if euery man were dispersed home to his owne Citye, as they wer about to doo, it shuld be more to his paine to pursue them one by one. Thorough this pollicy he caused the king to geue a sign of battel. The Grekes also being preuented with thapproche of their ene mies, layed their power together & ioyned battell. During the time of thencounter, the king as a loker on & no medler with certaine shippes lay still at the roode.

Wherfore whē he had slain the king, he wrought by pollicy to destroy his children, whome he knewe to be a lette to his enterprise. As for Artaxerxes whiche was but aThe cautele and treson of Artabanus. childe to speake of, he toke no great thought, and therfore the sooner to compasse his matters, he surmised that Darius which was a tall strippling had slaine his father, to the entent he might the soner possesse the kingdom. Wherby he compelled artaxerxes to reuenge murder with murder. When they came to Darius lodginge, they founde him as it were neither sleping nor waking, and there killed him. Afterward artabanus perceiuing that for all the mischief he could deuise, there was yet one of the kinges sonnes aliue, and fearing that the peres of the realme wold stand in con tention with him for the kingdome, made of his Counsell one Baccabassus, who being content with his present estate, bewrayed the whole matter to artaxerxes: howe his FatherThe treason disclosed. was slain, how his brother vpon false presumption of murder was put to death, and finallye howe there was treasonTreson politiquely reuen ged. a woorking againste his owne personne.

Therfore when as among the rest, artabanus himselfe stoode by in his harnesse, the kinge fained that his Curet was to shorte for him, commaundinge artabanus to chaunge with him. As he was putting it of, the king espying him naked, thrust hym throughe with his sworde, and ther with all commaunded all his sonnes to be laide hande on. And by this meanes the worthy yong Prince reuenged the death of his father, and the murder of his brother, and saued him selfe oute of the bandes of traitoures.

And being sent for from the warres, to aunswer to hys complainte, whether his conscience gaue him to be giltye, or that he could not abide such a reproche to his honor, he made no woordes but went as a banished man to Elis. Afterward when he vnderstoode that he wasalcibiades stirreth the Lacedemonians against hys owne countrye. not onlye condempned, but also accursed by the priestes of all the orders of religion, he wente to Lacedemon, and there perswaded the king to warre vppon the Atheniens, nowe auexed and troubled with their misaduentures in Sicilie. Immediatly whervppon, all the kingdomes of Grece gathered them selues together, as it had ben to quench some common fire, so great hatred hadde the Atheniens gotten, through their vnmeasurable desire of bearing rule. Darius
               He was the sonne of artax erxes & was the viii. kyng of Persia. also the king of Persians, remembring the hatred that hys father and graundfather bare to this City, entred in leage with the Lacedemonians, by Tyssaphernes lieuetenaunte of Lydia, and promised to bear the charges of the warre. This was the pretence of entraunce in leage with the Grekes, but in verye deede he doubted, least when the Lacedemonians had ouercome the Atheniens, they would set vppon him. What wonder is it then if the estate of Athens were so flourishinge, since that to oppresse that one Citye, all the power of the whole East bent them selues together. YetThe prowes of thatheniēs notwithstandinge they were not as cowardes ouercome wythout great bloudshed, but fightinge to the vttermost,

and some whiles also getting the vpper hand, they were at lengthe rather by vnstablenesse of fortune consumed, then

In the beginning of the warre, not so muche but euen their owne fellowes forsooke them as it is daily sene, that wheras fortune semeth to fauor thither also, do mennes harts encline.

For taking with him x. shippes, he sailed into Asia, and there by the authoritye of his name, compelled the Cities that were tributary vnto the Atheniens, to tourne to the Lacedemonians. For they knew wel that he was a man of great power in his owne countrye, and they thought he was not the lesse by reason of his banishmente, supposing him not to muche to be taken from the Atheniens, as to be deliuered for a captain to the Lacedemonians and so they set his winninges against his losses.

much helpe, consideringe he prepared for another mannes victory and not for his owne, wherfore the warre ought so farre forthe to be maintained, that it be not broken vp for want of things necessary. For as long as the Grekes were thus at debate amōg them selues, the king of Persia shuld alwaies be an indifferent iudge bothe of peace and warre at his owne pleasure. And he should ouercome them wyth their owne power, whome he could not ouercome with all the power he was able to make of his owne. And assone as the warre were ended, whiche waye so euer the gole went, he should be compelled to haue warre with the conquerors. Wherfore it wer good to suffer the Grekes to busy them selues in wasting their own country, to the entent they haue no leisure to inuade forain countries. To the performance wherof, either parte oughte to be maintained in strength able to match his aduersari, and the weaker to be aided with new succors. For it was not to be thought that the Lacedemonians would be in rest, if they might get the vpper hand, considering they had professed and proclaimed them selues all redy, the defenders of the liberty of Grece. This Oration liked Tissaphemes very well, whervppon he allowed them not so liberall expenses, neither sent he forth all the kings flete, least he shuld either geue them the victorye oute of hande, or elsse constraine them to breake vp the warres. In the meane season Alcibiades did thus muche forNote his crafty deling. his country men, that when the Atheniens sente their ambassadors vnto him, he promised to get them the kinges fauor, if so be it that the administration of the common welth wer remoued from the people, and put into the senatours handes. Hopinge there by that if the Citye agreed well, he shoulde be chosen captaine of the warre by their common assent, or els if there arose any variaunce betwene the two estates, he shoulde be called to the ayd of the one part. But the Atheniens seinge the daunger of the warre that they were wrapped in, had more respect of their safegarde then of their honoure.
            
               Therfore with the good wil of the people, the gouernance of the common wealth was put into the hands of the senators. The which because that through a certain pride natu rallye engraffed in that estate, they dealed with the people

The meeter for his purpose seemed Tyssaphernes, a man bothe of more experience and actiuity then the other, and also better furnished with the souldioures that belonged sometime to kinge Cyrus. After communication had, agrement was made vpon certain conditions, that he shuld not intermeddle him selfe with the warres.

The Lacedemonians debated the matter a greate while, whether they might make him lieuetenant general or no, by reson of the aunswer of the Oracle at Delphos, the effect wherof was that their Empire shoulde come to an ende, at suche time as the royall estate halted, for agesilaus was lame of one foote.

In which his doing he should attaine to honoure after a nother sorte, and in manner cleane contrary, then other that had bene Captaines in his countrye before times. For wheras they defended the country by vanquishinge the Persians, he shoulde restore it to her former estate, by makinge the Persians conquerors.

The kinges and all the Souldioures also were in the lyke perplexity, not so greatly disquieted for the kepynge of the richesse that they them selues had all readye gotten, as for fear least the Atheniens should recouer their owne again. But the sorer that the battel was, the more glorious wasThe Lacedemonians are vanquished on the sea. the victory of Conon. The Lacedemonians being put to the worse tooke them to flight, and their garrisons were led away to Athens. The people were restored to their former estate, and their bondage taken awaye from them, manye cities also were recouered to their Empire. This was vnto the Atheniens a beginning of the recouery of their auncient preheminens, and vnto the Lacedemonians an ende of reteining that they had.

The which thing the Lacedemonians fearing, sent for their king Agesilaus (whiche atcheued many great enterprises in Asia,) home to the defence of his Countrye. For after time that Lysander was slain, they had none other cap tain in whome they durst put their truste and confidence. Neuerthelesse because it was long ere Agesilaus came, they raised a power and went to mete their enemy. But nether their courages nor their strēgth was able to stand against them, of whome they had beene put to the worse so latelye before, and therfore at the first encounter they wer put to flight.

For in like manner as if ye break of the edge of a wepon, the rest of it is able to doo no great harme: euen so this Duke being dead, who was as it were the edge of the common wealthe of Thebes, the strengthe therof was appalled and in manner dulled, in so much that they semed not so muche to haue lost him, as altogether to haue died with him. For neither before this Dukes time, atcheued they any notable conquest, nor afterwarde deserued to be spoken of for any famous attempt by them accom plished, but only for the slaughters that were made of thē. So that it appereth manifestly, that the glory and renown of his country, did bothe spring vp with him, and die wyth him. And a manne is not able to iudge whether he were a better captain and souldiour, or a better man of his liuing. For alwaies he sought preheminence to his countrye, rather then to him self, and he was suche a sparer of monye, that be wanted wherwith to bury him according to his estate.

Then he enquired again which parte had won the field, and hearing that the Thebanes had gottē it, he said all was wel, and so as it wer reioysing for his coūtries sake, he gaue vp the ghoste. By the deathe of this man, the prowesse of the Atheniens also decayed. For after the time that he was once gon, whose fotesteps they wer wont to fo low, now geuing the selues all together to slouth & idlenes, they lashed out the common reuenues, not vpon ships and men of warre as they had don in times past, but in feastful daies and holy daies, & in making preparation for pagiants & enterludes: gathering thē selues together into the theaters, to behold the famous stage players & Poets, visitinge oftner the stage then the campe, setting more by versifiers and oratoures, then by Captaines.

Nether withheld he his hand frō his own kinred. For he determined to put Arymba king of Epyrus his wife Olympias neare kinsman from his royalty. And thervpon hePhilip abuseth alexander and deposeth arimba kings of Eplre. sent for Alexander his sonne in law, brother of his wife Olympias, a boy of excellent beuty, in his sisters name, to com vnto him into Macedonie. And ther by al meanes possible ha uing entised him with hope of the kingdom, vnder pretens of counterfet loue, abused him in most filthy buggery, thin king that either shame and remorse of his own conscience, or elsse the making of him king, should cause him to be the more at his commaundement. Therefore when the chylde was come to xx. yeres of age, he toke the kingdom from Arymba, and gaue it to him being a very boy: playinge a wicked part with them bothe. For neither delt he like a natural kinsman with him, from whome he toke the kingdome, and him to whome he gaue it, he made a harlot before he made him king.

The which vncertain possession made it to stand stiflye in the defence of her own liberty, forasmuch as neither partye succored or rescued it as their owne. Phillip therfore hauing spent his treasure with the long continuaunce of his siege, made a shifte to get mony by rouing on the Lea. And hauing taken lxr. shippes laden with marchaundise, he refreshed his gready necessity for a while. Furthermore because so great an army shoulde not be deteined aboute the siege of one city, he went with a nomber of the stoutest of his souldioures, and wan manye cities of Chersonesus.

Upon the receyte of this message, Philip sent ambassadours to kinge Matthey requiring somwhat towarde the charges of his siege, least he be constrained through pouerty to breake vp his camp. To the which request he ought of reason so much the willinglier to condescend, in that he did not allowe the souldiers that he sent to his aid so much as their costes and spendinge monye by the waye, nor gaue them any rewarde for their trauel and paines taking.

The king sent him word

that if he wold performè his vow, he shuld send him the Image, promising that it shoulde not onlye be set vp, but al so should remaine and stand safe and vnuiolated. But as to suffer any army to come within his borders, that he denied vtterly. And if he woulde attempte to place the Image whether the Scythians would or no, he should not be so sone gone, but he woulde pull it downe againe, and tourne the brasse of it, into spear heads and arowe heads. The mindes of bothe parties being in this wise stirred, they encountred in open fielde. The Scythians wheras they were of greater power and mo in nomber, were neuerthelesse by the pollicy of Phillip ouercome. Twenty thousande women & children were taken prisoners, and a great booty of cattel, but of golde and siluer nothing at al, which was a sufficient triall and profe of the pouerty of the Scythians. Twenty M. fayre Mares were sent into Macedone to brede. But as Philip returned out of Scytbia, the Tribals met him by the way, denying him passage through their coūtry, onlesse he wold geue them part of his boty. Herevpon they fel to wordes, and sone after to hand strokes. In the which skirmish Philip was so sore wounded in the thighe, that hys horse was slain vnder him, and he left for dead, by meanes wherof y• boty was lost. So the boty of Scythia being as it were forespoken, had like to haue tourned the Macedones to greate sorowe. Yet notwithstandinge assone as he was recouered of his wound, he made warre against the Atheniens, y• which he hadde so longe time before dissembled.

before this time that he fell at woordes at a banquet, fyrste with Attalus, and after with his father.

He was a king more desirous of battel then of banketting, whose richesse consisted chefelyThe description of kynge Philip. in furniture of the warres, and he was more conninge in getting and purchasing richesse, then in keping. And therfore for all that he pilled & polled euery daye, yet was he euer neady. Mercy and falshode he loued a like. He thought it no shame to purchase his desire, how so euer he came by it, so he might haue it. Wher as he fauored he would make as though he wer displesed. Suttle and captious was he to talke vnto, promising more then he wold performe. In deuising serious matters, and in merye conceites connynge, winning frendship for aduauntage and luker, and not for faithfulnesse. Wher he hated most, there to pretend moost fauor, and to sow discord betwene such as he knew agreed best together, seking for thank with bothe parties, he vsed as a solempne custome.

in counsel, but this man was of a more Princely and royall stomacke. The father would oftentimes dissemble his anger and ouercome it: but if this man were ones in a rage, there was nothing but reuengement out of hande, & that should be done without all mesure or reason.

And therfore Philip returned oftentimes out of the battel wounded himself, wheras this man oftentimes as a murderer of his owne frends at his table, was faine to depart oute of company. The father loued to raign among his frendes, and to haue hys frendes raign with him. The sonne would playe the tiraunt wyth his frendes. The father had rather be beloued, the sonne to be feared. As for learning was a like in both of them. The father was a man of more craft and pollicye, but the sonne was more to be betrusted. Phillippe was more modest in woordes and communication, but Alexander more modest in his deedes. The sonne was of a more gentle and honest nature, and more prone to shewe mercy to thē that he had ouercome, but the father woulde not abstaine so muche as from his owne confederates and partakers. The Father was more geuen to frugalitye, and the sonne more to ryotousnesse. By the whyche meanes the father layde the foundation of the Monarchy of the whole worlde, and the sonne to hys hygh renowne and glory finished the whole worke.

Of these thre contrary to the custome of the Persians, which are not wōt to chaūge their king onlesse he die,) the father of his gentlenesse during hys owne life, made Darius king, thinckynge that he had nothing the lesse him self, for that that he bestowed vpon his sonne, and that he should take the more ioye of the begetting him, if he might in his life time beholde in his sonne, the liuely representation of his own estate. ButThe wickednesse of Darius towarde hys father. Darius assone as his father had by euident profe, newlye expressed his tender and louing affection towardes him, began to deuise meanes howe to kill his father he had bene a wicked man, if he had gone aboute to kill his father alone: but so muche the more wicked was he, in that he intised fifty of his brothers, to consent to the killing of their father. It is a monstruous thing, that so hainous a murder, shuld not only be consented to, but also concealed in such a multitude of people: that of fifty children there could not one be found, whom either the fear of his fathers maiestye, or the reuerence of his age, or the earnest affection that he hadde shewed, could withdraw or call backe from an outragious cruelty. Was the name of father so vile amonge so manye sonnes in nomber, that by whose defence he ought to haue bene preserued euen against his enemies, euen by the treson of the same he should be surprised, and be in more safety of his enemies then of his owne sonnes? The cause of thys pretensed murder, was more wicked then the murder it self. For after the time that Cyrus was slaine in the warre

that he made againste his brother as is before mentioned: king Artaxerxes toke his concubine Aspasia in marriage.

His father for y• loue he bare to him, graunted at the first to do it: anon after being striken with repentance, to thentent he might honestly deny, the thing he had rashly promised, he made her chief priest to the sonne, wherby she was bound to kepe her self chast from all men during her life.

The occasion and originall hereof was this. As one Gordius was going to plough in the country, with Oxen that he had hired, birdes of all sorts began to flie about him. Whervppon as he went to aske counsell of the Southsayers of the city therby, in the gate he mette with a maid of excellent beautye, and demaundynge of her what Southsayer he were best to goo to. When she heard thoccasion wherfore he woulde aske counsell, beinge seene her selfe in the science by thenstruction of her Father and

And yet the same Phisition was had in great mistrust, by reason of the letters sent the daye before oute of Cappadocia from Parmenio.

            He had him say vnto Alexāder in his name, that he died

a great dettor of his without any desert of his owne parte, for as much as he had foūd him like a king, and not like an enemy towards his wife and children, and that it was hys chaunce to be better entreated of his ennemy, then of hys owne kin. For wheras his enemy had geuen his wyfe and children life, his kinsfolk to whome he had geuen both lyfe and kingdoms, had vnnaturally bereft him of his life. For the which his doinges, he rendred him suche thankes as he himself hauing the victory listeth to accept. This onlye one thing (which lay in his power to do for him nowe lyinge at the poynt of death, would he do for Alexander, as inrecom pence of his good turnes, that is, to pray to the powers celestiall, and the powers infernall, and the Gods of kinges, to geue him victory and dominion of the whole worlde. As for himself he desired nothing, but that it might be his plesure to graunte him buriall, as of righte he oughte to haue without grudge. And as touching the reuengement of hys death, it was now no parte of his care, but for exāples sake the common case of all kinges, the whiche to neglecte as it should be dishonorable to him, so might it turne to hys vtter perill. For on the one part, this case concerneth his Iustice, and on the other it toucheth his owne vtility and profit. In token wherof as an only pledge of the faith and honor of a king, he gaue his right hand to cary vnto Alexander. At those words he stretched out his hand and gaue vp the goste. The which when Alexander hard of, he came to see his body as he lay dead, and he wept to beholde so worthye an estate, come vnto so vnworthye a death. Wherfore he caused his body to be entred with all solempnitye like a kinge, and his reliques to be conueyed into the Sepulthres of his auncestoures.

And besides thys, lyke as the Oracle at Delphos had prophesied vnto great Alexander, that his destruction shuld be wrought in Macedone, euen so the Oracle of Iupiter of Dodone had told this Alexander, that the city Pandose and the riuer acheruse shoulde be his fatall end.

The Appulians hauynge knowledge of the answer of the Oracle, slew the ambassadoures and bucied them in the Citye, there to haue their dwellinge for euer, and so hauing dispatched the meaninge of the Oracle, they enioyed the City a great time. The which dede when Alexander of Epyre knew of, for reuerēce to the destinies of so long continuaunce, he made no more warre to the Appulians.

And to thentent he might leaue his name behinde him in those countries, he builded a City vpon the riuer Tanais and named it Alexandria, the wall whereofAlexandria vpon Tanais beinge vi miles in compasse, he finished within xvii. daies, remouinge into it the people of iii. other cities that Cyrus had builded.

So greate a terror had the fame of his name striken into the harts of all the world, that all nations as if they had determined to make him & acknowledge him for their soueraigne Lord and king, wer glad to humble them selues vnto him. For this cause therfore as he was making spede to Babilon, as it were to hold a parliament of the whole world. One of the wisemen told hym that it was not good for him to come there, affirming that it was the place where he should die. There vppon he lefte Babilon and went to the city Byrse beyond the riuer Euphrates which ere whiles lay desolate. There the Philosopher Anaxarchus through his perswasion compelled hym to despise the foresayinges of the wisemen as false and vncertaine, forasmuche as if they were determined by desteny, men were not priuye to them, or if they were ordained by the lawe of nature, it was not possible for a manne to breake them or auoid them Returninge therfore to Babilon, when he had spent many daies in idlenesse, the festing and banketting which he had left of now for a good while, he set vp fresh again, and being altogether geuen to mirth and pastime, spending day and night in reuelling and making chere, euen immediatly vpon a banket, the Phisition Thassalus made a rere supper, and desired the kinge andalexander is poisoned. his Lordes vnto it. Alexander toke a cuppe in his hande,

hande, and as he was in the middes of his draughte, sodenlye he gaue a greate sighe as thoughe he hadde beene striken to the harte with a dagger, and being caryed from the banket halfe deade, he was tormented with so intollerable paine, that he desired to haue a sworde to ridde hym selfe out of it wythall, and when anye man touched him, it was as greuous to him as if they had wounded him. His frendes caused it to be noised, that his excessiue dronkennesse was the cause of his disease. But in verye deede it was the treason of them selues, the slaunder wherof was by the power of them that succeded suppressed.
            The authoure of this treason was Antipater, who seingThe author of alexanders death. his moost entier deare frendes murdered, his sonne in lawe Alexander of Lyncestes put to death, and himself after his noble enterprises atcheued in Grece, not so muche accepted for his laboure as had in disdaine, and ther vnto tickled with diuers complaints made by his mother Olympias besides all the which considering what straight iustice and cruel execution was lately before, doone vpon the lieuetenaunts of sondry countries, could gather no lesse by the circumstauns of the premisses, but that he himselfe also was sent for out of Macedone, not to attende vppon hym in his warres, but to be punished as other had bene. Therfore to the entent to preuent the kinges purpose, he sent his sonne Cassander priuely with poyson, the which Cassander wyth Phillip and Iolla his brothers, were wonte to serue the kynge at his Table. And the force of the poysonne was so greate that there was neyther brasse, yron nor earthen vessell that was able to holde it, nor it coulde not be caryed any otherwise then in the hofe a horse: laying strait charge vpon his sonne that he shoulde not truste anye man sauing Thessalus and his brothers.

Therfore they assembled in the palace all in harnesse, to set an order and staye in matters for the tyme. Perdicas thoughte it good to abide the deliueraunce of Roxanes, the which had now gone viii. monethes with child by Alexander, and wold be redy shortly to lie downe, and if she brought forth a sonne, to substitute him in his fathers stead.
            
               Meleager replying thervnto said, it was not meete to delaye their determination vpon her doubtfull deliueraunce, nor to tary for a king that was vnborne, sith they mighte take suche as were borne all ready.
            For if they desired to haue a childe to their kinge, there was at Pergamus Alexanders sonne by Arsine called Hercules: or if they had rather haue a younge man, there was in the campe arideus the brother and companion of Alexander, one that was welbeloued of all men, not onlye for hys owne sake, but also for his father king Philippes sake.

Ptolomy refused to haue arideus made king, not only for his mothers basenesse, (for he was begotten of a concubine named Laryssa,) but also for his continuall sicknesse, whiche was greater then could well be abiden in that case: least he shoulde beare the name, and another all the sway.
            
               Wherfore it wer better for them to chuse certayn of those whiche for their prowesse and vertues were next vnto the king, to rule the prouinces and to take charge of y• warres, rather then vnder the coloure of a kinge, to be at the commaundement of vnworthy persons. At length by the consent of them all, the sentence of Perdicas tooke place. It was thought good to tary for the deliueraunce of Roxanes, and if she had a manchilde, it was determined that Leonatus, Perdicas, Craterus, &

The which being openly red in the presens of all Grece at the marte of Olympus, caused much busines: because that diuers of them were banished, not by order of law, but through discord and partaking of the princes, fearing y• if they shuld be reuoked again, they might bear grea ter sway & autority in the common welth thē they.

For I am sure he cares not after what sort, or where I die, so I be dead, neyther doo I passe greatly for my life, so I might be deliuered frō thys slaunderous death. If you will graunt me this request, I discharge you of your othe, wherby you haue bound your selues so often vnto me. Or if ye be ashamed to slea me your selues, then reach me a weapon, and geue me leaue to do that thing for you without conscience of breaking of your othe, which you haue sworne so oftentimes to do for your captain. When he saw he coulde not obtaine his request, he left intreatance and fel to anger. Now the Gods (quod he) the iust reuenger of periury, looke vpon you, you false forsworne kaitiues, and geue such endes vnto you, as you haue geuen vnto your captaines. For it is not longe a go, since you polluted your selues with the bloude of Perdicas, practising to haue done the like with Antipater, yea and that that is worst of all you oftentimes troubled euen Alexander himself with your seditions and mutinies, doing your best to haue slain him, if it had beene possyble for him to haue died of mannes hand. And nowe I laste of all whiche shalbe offered as a sacrifice by you false forsworne wretches, do pray God that these curses maye lighte vpon you, that being beggers and outlawes, you may spend all your life time in this warfare, like banished people, neuer to retourne to your country againe, and your owne weapons deuour you, with the which you haue consumed mo captaines of your owne, then of your ennemies.

The whiche thinge his brother Philippe attempting before to haue doone, died betweene the Kynges handes. But as Alexander alyghted from his horse, hee wounded Lysimachus so sore in the fooreheade wyth the poynt of his speare, that the bloude coulde not otherwise be stopped, but that to bynde vp the wound wythall, the kyng was fain to take the Drademe from hys own hed; and set it vpon his, the which was then firste of all a fortunate fortoken that Lysimachus should after aspire to the estate of a kinge.

Unto the whiche thing after that his minde was ones enclined, the examples of his auncestoures draue him hedlonges forwardes, to the entent he wold not seme inferior to his vncle Alexander, who hadde defended the sayde Tarentines agaynste the Brutians, or to be of lesse courage then great Alexander, who hadde made warre so sarre from his owne countrye and subdued the East.
            Where vppon leauinge his sonne Ptolomy of the age of. xv. yeres as regent of his kingdome, he landed his armye in the hauen of Tarent, leadynge with him hys two yonger sonnes Helen and Alexander, to beare him company in his farre expedition.
            
               Of whose arriuall the Romaine consull Valerius Leunius hearing, making haste to encounter with him before the aides of his confederates were assembled, broughte hys men into the field: neither did the king, (although he had nothing so many men of warre as his ennemies) detracte the encounter.

Neuerthelesse he obtained not the victorye without much bloudshed. For Pyrrhus himselfe was sore woun ded, and a great part of his Souldioures slaine, so that he gate by that victory, more honoure then cause to reioyce.

Within a few daies after, when the hostes of his confederates were come, he foughte an other battell with the Romaines, in the whiche the fortunePyrrhus vā quishe the Romaines a gayne. was like vnto the former battell.

For whiche consideration he was sent, that for as much as they were assailed by a foraine ennemy, they mighte be rescued by for raine succoures. The Senate gaue the Carthaginenses hartye thankes, and sent away their succoures againe. But Mago accordinge to the nature of a man of affricke, wythin a fewe dayes after, as though he ment to procure peace for the

While theese thinges were in doing, Fabritius Lucinus being sent ambassadoure from the Senate of Rome, cōcluded a peace with Pirrhus, for the confirmation wherof, Cyneas beinge sent from Pirrhus with great giftes and rewardes, could finde no man that would ones open his doore to receiue a reward.

After the departure of Pyrthus oute of Sicil, Hiero was created chiefe officer, who was a man of such modesty, that by the fauorable consentOf the educa tion, and preferment of Hiero. of all the Cities, he was first made captayne agaynste the Carthaginenses, and afterwarde kinge. Of this royall estate to come, his bringing vp when he was a very babe, was as it were a foreteller. For he was begotten of a noble man called Hieroclytus, whose pedegre was fet from Gelus an auncient king of Sicil. But by his mothers side he was borne of a base and verye dishonorable stocke, for he was be gotten of a bondwoman, and therefore caste away by his father as a dishonor and reproch to his stock.

Then he rehersed what he had done for them, how he had punished suche of their confederates as had reuolted, how he had asswaged the courage of the Dardanians and Thessalians triumphing at the death of Demetrius; and finally how he had not only maintained, but also augmē

Of the which thinges if so be it they repented them, he was contente to depose himself, and to surrender his office into their hands, and let them seke them a king whom they mighte rule as they liste them selues. When the people beinge strycken with shame, willed him to take his kingdome vppon hym again, he refused it vtterly, so long, vntill the authours of the rebellion were yelded vnto him to punish them at hys pleasure. After this he made war agaynst the Spartanes which all only despised the warres of Philip and Alexander, and the Empire of the Macedones, with the knyghthode and chiualry so sore redoubted ouer all the worlde.Warre betwene the Spartanes and the Macedones. The warre was prepared for withall the furniture and power that could be made on bothe partes, betwene these two noble and famous nations. The one fighting for the auncient renowne of Macedone, the other not only for the maintenaunce of their vntouched liberty neuer before vn lated, but also for theyr common sauegarde. The Lacedemonians being vāquished, not only they them selues, but also their wiues and children, toke their misfortune with very stout courage.
            
               For there was not any man that spared his life in the battel, there was not any woman that wept for the losse of her husband. The olde men commended the deathe of theyr sonnes, and the sonnes reioysed that theyr fathers were slaine in the fielde. Euery man lamented hys owne chaunce, that they had not died for the libertye of theyr countrye. The fathers and mothers receyued into theyr houses all suche as were wounded, healed suche as were wounded, healed suche as were hurte, and recomforted suche as were stricken downe. And in all thys busynesse there was not in the city any outcry, or any wringyng of handes, there was not any trembling for feare, euery mā bewailed more the common misfortune, then hys owne priuate case.

               ABout the very same season, thereAn alteratiō of kingdomes by the successi on of younge kynges. happened an alteration almost in all the kingdomes of the worlde, by the successyon of yong kynges. For in Macedone Philippe, after the decease of his protector Antigonus, who also was his father in law, toke the kingdome vpon him being but. xiiii. yeres olde. In Asia Seleucus being slaine, Antiochus as yet vnder the age of. xiiii. yeares was made kynge.
            The kingdome of Cappadocia was surrendred by his father to Ariarathes beinge a verye childe. Ptolomy who for the wickednesse of his offence was in derision surnamed Philopater, slue his father and mother, and vsurped the kingdome of Egipt. But the Lacedemonians in stead of Cleomenes subrogated Lycurgus. And for because there shoulde be store of alterations in those times, Hannibal being as yet skarse manne growen, was made captaine of Carthage, not because there was skarsity of men of more yeres and experience, but for the natural hatred that was knowen to be rooted in him againste the Romaines euen from his verye childhode, born to the vtter destruction, not so muche of the Romaines as of his own countrye of affricke.

On the contrary part, Phillip when he had put his enemyes to flight, being not content to haue defeded his own, purposed to make war against the aetolians.

               nsul of Rome, came to him as an humble suter, making complaint of the wrong that the Romaines had done vnto him, who being not content to kepe them sclues within the boundes of Italy, (but of a wicked desire coueting thempire of the whole world,) made war withal kinges. Alledging that for the like couetousnesse of the Empyre of Sicil, of Sardinia, of Spain and consequently of all affricke, they had entered into war with Hannibal and the Carthaginenses: and that they had made war vpon hym also for none other occasion, but only y• he was next neigh bor vnto Italy, as though it were not lawful for any king to dwell neare the borders of their Empire. Wherfore it was good for antiochus to take ensample how to beware by other men, whose kingdome the nobler and nearer it was to the Romaines, so muche should he finde them his fiercer enemies. Moreouer he professed, that he was contented to surrender his right and title to him of the king dome whiche the Romaines hadde by force taken from him Saying it should lesse greue him, and that he coulde better finde in his hart to se his neighbour and his frend, rather then his enemy enioy the possession of his kingdō,

With this and suche other like talke he perswaded Phillip to leaue the aetolians, and to tourne the brunte of the warre against the Romaines, so much the rather, because he thought they shoulde be the lesse able to resist him, by reason (as he hard say) they had lately before bene vanqui shed by Hannibal at the lake of Thrasymenus. TherforePhilip perswadeth the Grekes to peace and tranquilitye. because he would not be charged with manye warres at ones, he made peace with the aetolians, not as that they shoulde thincke he did it, to the entent to make warre in another place, but as thoughe it had bene for some great regard that he had of the quietnesse of all Grece, ye which he affirmed was neuer in the like pearill and ieoperdye, by meanes of the newe Empires of the Romaynes and Carthaginenses latelye risen vp in the west, whyche had none other let or stop to kepe them out of Grece and Asia, but only this, while they were trying by the sworde; which of them should beare the soueraintye. For whiche party so euer gate the vpper hand, the same would imme diatlye vpon the victorye passe directly into the East.
            Therfore he saw suche a cloude of cruel and bloudye war rising out of Italy, he saw suche a roring and thundering storme comming out of the west, that into what parte of the world so euer the violent force of the victorye shoulde driue the tempest therof, it was like to washe all thinges with a terrible and bloudy shour. He said that Grece had oftentimes before suffered great trouble by the war
                  •…
               es, somtime of the Persians, sometime of the frenchmen, and sometime of the Macedones: but they shoulde fynde that all that euer is paste was but a sporte. If those armyes which now were fighting in Italye, shoulde once spreade them selues into Grece. For he sawe well inoughe, howe cruell and bloudy bothe with puissaunce of hostes and policye of captaines, those two peoples made warre one against another. The whiche rage certainly coulde not be ended, in the only destruction of one of the partyes, wyth out the ruine and decay of suche as were next neighbors.

Wherefore Grece had more cause a greate deale to be afraid of the cruelty of whether party so euer gate the vpper hand, then Macedone, both because Macedone is further of from them, and of more strength to defend it self. And yet he knew for a certaintye that those that encountered now with so great puissaunce, would not be conten ted to end their conquest so, but that he himself shuld haue cause to sear, least he be driuen to haue to doo with them that should get the vpper hand. Hauinge vnder this pretence broke vp his

Neither were the Romaines, (all be it the Carthaginenses and Hannibal were then in manner rea dy to light vpon their necke,) voyde of feare of warre out of Macedone also. For they stode in dreade of it, bothe for the auncient prowesse and actiuitye of the Macedones, & for renowne of their conquestes in the East, and also for Philip himselfe, who was enflamed with an earnest desyre, to become equall to Alexander in knighthoode and cheualry, and whome they knew to be forwarde and actiue in feates of armes. Phillip therfore when he vnderstode that the Carthaginenses hadde vanquished the Romaines again, sent his open defiaunce vnto them, and beganPhilip

               And so forgetting quite the renoume of his nauy, and the maiesty of his kingdome, he spent the nightes in lechery, and the daies in feastinge and bankettinge. Besides this the more to encrease and enflame his lecherous appetite withall, he had at his feastes musicall drincking and dansing. Neither could the king nowe content himselfe to beholde and heare others, but also like a master of naughtinesse, would play vppon instrumentes and daunce to the same. These were the fyrst plagues and preuy maladies, which afterward were the ruine and decay of the kinges house. For within a while after, they grewe to suche a licentious libertye, and the harlot waxed so bolde that the walles of the court were not able to holde her. Whome being of herselfe proud and arrogant inough, thvnspekeable lechery that the king vsed daily with her brother Agathocles, a strompet of more beauty then was requisite in a man, made yet more stately and arrogant.
