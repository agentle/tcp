            ¶ This stile and title beeing thus proclamed, the kyng & the Quene departed hand in hande vnder the forsaid Canapie to my lord Chaūcellers place, where the quenes grace was lodged: whose two most prīcely, & most rich Abilimentes, was of betin gold vpō

The king of them commonlye called Garter, proclamed there againe the kynges highnes, & the Quenes new stile & title, in maner, fourme, and effect as he did in the Cathedrall churche when

hie masse was done. And so crying three tymes Larges, agayne they departed.
            And thus shortly to conclude, there was for certain daies after this moste Noble mariage, suche triumphing, bankating, singing, masking, and daunsing, as was neuer in Englande here tofore,Mirth, ioy & pastime at and after their maryage. by the reporte of all men. Wherfore, to see the kinges magestie and the Quene sitting vnder the cloth of estate, in the hall where they dyned, and also in the Chā

            Nowe to trouble youre Lordshyp,

any further with the hole, & perfite declaration of the riche and sundrie apparelles whiche the nobilitie of Englande and Spayne vsed, and ware at and after the mariage of these two most excellent Princes, it were but a phantasie and losse of paper and ynke: for no mortall Princes (Emperoures and kinges only except) were able surely to excell them. And such braue liueries, as their seruaūtes had,The riche apparels of then obi litie of England. and Spai I neuer sawe the lyke, in all the Countreys that euer I trauayled. And finally with what ryche hanginges y• Cathedral Church of Winchester and the Quyer was hanged, and the two seates where bothe the Princes sat, it was a wonder to se. And againe to vew & marke what Eligaunt verses in Latin of all kynde of

I purpose for to sende the Copy of some of theym to your lordship (God willing) hereafter. And i the meane season I will not omit two verses, whiche were wrytten in a whyte fielde whych Heroldes call siluer, with faire Romayne

               Orpheus, of whom, and of Amphiō, we reade in the fables of old Poetis. Where also were nyne faire ladyes playing and singing on diuers swete instrumentes, signifying the nine muses.
            And not farre from them were men, and children decked vp like wilde beastes, as Lions, wolfes, foxes and beares. So that the

moste swete strokes, noyse, and soundes of Orpheus, with the nyne Musis playing and singinge in the sayd Pageant, and also the counterfeated beastes daunsing and leapinge, with Orpheus harpe, and the Musis melodye exhilarated and reioysed their maiesties very much.

               celer of his right hande, and the Erle of Shrewsbery of his left, they went by water to Lambeth which is a place perteyninge to the Archebishop of Canterbury, where his lordeship lyeth as yet. This Cardinall is an Englyshe mā borne, of whome (I am sure) your lordshyp hath hearde, & discended of the bloude Roiall of Englande. For his mother was doughter to George Duke of Clarence, which was brother to Edward ye fourth of that name, kinge of Englande. WhycheMy Lorde Cardinal was an exile out of hys country xxi. yeares. Cardinall hathe bene an exile out of England these. xxi. yeres. The cause whereof was, that he woulde not assente to kynge

king Henry the eight in the matterThe causes wherfore he was exiled of diuorse from his most lawfull wife Quene Katherin mother to the quene that nowe is.
            And that he would not admitte the sayd king to beare the title of Supreme head of the Churche of Englande, whiche by a newe example he hadde lately (as it is now sayd) vsurped.
            This opinion did not onely purchaseDiuers noble men haue suffred in Englande for hys sake. exile to thys Cardinal himselfe but also was the death of the vertuouse lady the Countes of Salysbery his mother, ye lord Montegle hys brother, and the Marques of Exester his cousin, wyth manye other noble menne being suspect as adherentes to him in the same opinion.
            Surely thys cruelty was great, but that whyche exceded all the rest: thys olde lady being at least

lx. and .x. yeares of age, cosin to the king, and beyng (as it is saied) most innocent and giltles, was without iudgement or processe of the lawe drawen by the hore heres to ye blocke, not knowyng any cause why to dye.
            Many lyke examples of crueltie folowed in Englande by that alteracion, whiche are oute of my purpose: but this I haue touchedThe quenes magestie hath restored the Lorde Cardinal to the honour of hys house by occasion of this Cardinall, who nowe by the quenes goodnes is restored to the honour of his house. And now of late is arriued in Englande as Ambassadour and legate from the Popes holynes, with moste ample commission to receiue the e Ralme of Englande vnto the vnitie of the church, wherof your lordship shal ꝑceue more hereafter.

                & body of the whole Realme. As ye cause of my repaire hither hath been both wisely & grauely declared by my lord Chaunceller, So before ye I entre to ye particularities of my cōmissiō, I haue somwhat to say touching my selfe, & to geue most hūble & harti thākes to the king & Quenes magesties & after thē to you all whiche of a mā exiled and banisht frō this cō mon wealth, haue restored me to a member of the same: and of a man hauyng no place nether here or els where within this realme, haue admitted me in place where to speake and to be heard. Thys I protest vnto you al, that though I was exiled my natyue country wtout iust cause, as god knoweth

yet y• ingratitude could not pull from me the affeccion and desire that I had to proffit and doe you good. Yf the offer of my seruice might haue ben receaued, it was neuer to seke: & where that could not be taken, you neuer failed of my prayer, nor neuer shall. But leauing the rehersall therof, and cumming more nere to the matter of my commission, I signifie vnto you all, that my principall trauayl is, for the restitucion of thys noble Realme to the auncient nobilitie, and to declare vnto you, that the Sea Apostolike frō whens I come, hath a special respect to this Realme aboue al other, and not without cause, seīg that god himselfe, as it were by prouidēce, hath geuē this Realme prerogatiue of nobilitie aboue other: which to make more playne

vnto you, it is to be considered that this Iland first of al Ilādes receiued the light of Christes religion. For as stories testifie, it was prima prouinciarum quae amplexaest fidem Christi. For the Brittōs beīg first inhabitaūtes of this realme (not withstandyng the subieccion of the Emperours, & heathen Princes) dyd receyue Christes fayth from the Apostolike Sea vniuersally, & not in partes as otherEnglande of al Ilan des receyued fyr

But after that their ill merites or forgeatfulnes of god had deserued expulsiō, and that Straungers being infidels had possessed this land, yet god of his goodnes, not leauing where he ones loued, so illumined y• hartes

of the Saxons being heathē m
                  •…
               , that they forsoke the darknes of heathen errours, & enbraced the light of Christes religiō. So that within small space Idolatry and heathē supersticion was vtterlye abādoned ī this Ilād. This was a greate prerogatiue of nobilitie, wherof though the benefite be to be ascribed to god: yet the meane occasion of the same came from the Church of Rome. In ye faithe of whiche churche, we haue euer since continued and consented with the rest of the worlde in vnitye of religion. And to shew further the feruent deuocion of the inhabitauntes of this Iland towardes the Churche of Rome, We rede y• diuers Princes in the Saxons time with great trauell and expenses went personally to Rome, as Offa & Adulpbus whiche thought it not inough to shew thē
               
selfes obedient to the said see, vn les y• in their owne persones they had gon to that same place from whence thei had receued so great a grace & benefite. In the time of Carolus magnus, who first foūded the vniuersity of Parys, he sent into England for Alcuinus a great learned mā, which first brought learning to that vniuersity. Wherby it semeth that the greatest part of y• world fet the light of religiō frō Englād. Adriā y• fourth being an English mā cōuerted norway frō infidelity, which Adriā afterwardes vpō great affectiō & loue that he bare to thys realme being his natiue coūtry gaue to henry the. ii king of Englād y• right & seniory of the dominiō of Irelād, whiche pertained to ye see of Rome. I wil not reherse y• manifold benefites y• this realme hath receaued frō y• Apostolike sea, nor how ready the

same hath been to reliue vs in all our necessities. Nor I wil not re hearse the manifolde miseries and calamities, that this Realme hath suffred by swaruing from that vnitie. And euen as in thys Realme so in all other countries which refusing the vnitie of the Catholike fayth, haue followed fātastical doctryne, y• like plages haue happened. Let Asia, and the Empire of Grece be a spectacle vnto y• world, who by swaruing from the vnitie of the Churche of Rome, are broughte into captiuitie and subieccion of the Turke. All storyes be full of like examples. And to cum vnto latter tyme, loke vpō our nie neigh bours of germany, who by swarving from this vnitie, are miserablye afflicted with diuersitie of sectes, & deuided in faccions. What shal I rehearse vnto you

the 
                  •…
               umultes & effusion of blood that hath happened there in late dayes. Or trouble you with the rehersal of those plages y• haue happened sins this Innouacion of religion, wherof you haue felt the bitternes, and I haue hearde the reporte? Of al which matters I can say nomore but suche was the misery of the tyme. And see how farre forth this furie went. For those that liue vnder the Turke, may frely liue after their conscience, and so was it not lawfull here. Yf men examined wel vpon what groundes these Innouations began, they shall well finde, that the rote of thys, as of many other mischieffes, was avarice: And that the lust & Carnal affeccion of one mā confounded all lawes, both deuine and humane. And notwithstanding

all these deuises & pollicies practised within thys Realme against the church of Rome, they neded not to haue loste you, but that they sought rather as frēdes to reconcile you, then as enemies to enfeaste you. For they wanted not great offers of the most mightie Potentates in all Europe to haue ayded the church in that quarell. Then marke the sequel, ther semed by these chaun ges to rise a gret face of riches & gayne, which in profe cam to gret misery and lacke. Se howe god then can confounde the wisdome of the wise, and turne vniust pollicy to mere folye, and that thing that semed to be done for reliefe was cause of playne ruyne, and decay. Yet see that goodnes of God, which at no tyme fayled vs, but moste benignlye offered hys

grace, when it was of our partes leaste soughte, and worste deserued.
            And when all lyghte of true religiō seamed vtterly extīcte, as the churches defaced, the aulters ouerthrowen, the ministers corrupted

            And see howe miraculouslye GOD of hys goodnes preserued her hyghenes contrarye to the expectacyon of manne. That when numbers conspyred agaynste her, and pollicies were

deuised to disherit hir, and armed power prepared to destroye hir, yet she being a Uirgin, helples, naked and vnarmed, preuailed, & had the victorye ouer tyrauntes, which is not to be ascribed to any pollici of mā, but to the almighty greate goodnes & prouidence of God, to whome the honoure is to be geuen. And therfore it may be sayd: Da gloriam deo. For in mannes iudgemente, on her graces parte was nothinge in apparance, but dispayre. And yet for all these practises & deuises of ill mē, here you se hir grace established in hir estate, being your lawful Quene and Gouernes, borne amonge you, whome God hathe appointed to reigne ouer you, for the restitucion of true religion, and extirpacion of all erroures & sectes. And to confirme hir grace

the more stronglye in thys enterprise, Lo howe the prouidence of God hath ioyned her in mariage with a Prince of like religion, who beinge a kinge of great might, armour and force, yet vseth towardes you neyther Armour nor force, but seketh you by the waye of loue and amitie: in whiche respecte greate cause you haue to gyue thankes to almighty God that hathe sent you suche Catholyke Gouernours. It shal be therfore your parte againe to loue, obey and serue them. And as it was a synguler fauoure of God to conioyue theym in maryage: so it is not to be doubted but that he shal sende them yssue for the comforte and suerty of thys common wealthe. Of all Prynces in Europe, the Emperours hath trauayled most in the cause

of religion, as it appereth by hys actes in Germany▪ yet happly by some secret iudgement of god he hath not atchiued the ende, with whom in my iourney hetherwardes I had conference touchinge my Legation, whereof when he had vnderstandinge, he shewed great apperaunce of most ernest ioye and gladnes: saying that it reioysed him no les, of there concilemēt of this realme vnto christian vnitie, then that his sonne was placed by mariage in y• king dome. And most glad of all, that the occasion thereof shuld come by me, beinge an English manne borne, whiche is, as it were to call home oure selues. I can wel compare hym to Dauid, whiche thoughe he were a manne electe of GOD: yet for that he was contaminate with bloode & war, coulde not builde the temple of

                of god, and to haue power from a boue. For al power is of God accordyng to the saying. Non est potestas nisi adeo. And therefore I consider that all power being in god yet for the conseruacion of quiet & godly life in the world, he hath deriued that power from aboue into two partes here in earthe:

whiche is in the power ImperialTwo powers in earth, the Ecclesiasticall power, and ye Imperial and ecclesiasticall. And these two powers, as they be seuerall and distinct, so haue they two seueral effectes and operacions. For seculer Princes, to whom the Tē
               porall swerde is committed, be ministers of god to execute vengeaunce vpon transgressours & ill liuers, and to preserue the wel doers and innocentes from iniury and violence. Which power is represented in these two most excellence persons, the king and Quenes Magesties here preesēt who haue this power committed vnto theim Immediatlye from god, wythout any superioure in that behalfe.
            The other power is of ministracyon whyche is the power of the keies, and order in the Ecclesiastical state, which is by the authoritie of gods word and examples

of the Apostles, and of all olde holy fathers from Christ hitherto attributed and geuen to the Apostolike Sea of Rome, by speciall prerogatiue. From which Sea, I am here deputed Legate & Ambassadour, hauing full and ample commission frō thence, and haue the keyes committed to my handes. I confes to you that I haue the keyes not as mine owne keyes, but as ye keies of him that sent me: and yet cannot open: not for wante of power in me to gyue, but for certayne impedimentes in you to receaue, whiche must be taken awaye before my commission can take effect. This I protest vnto you, my commyssion is not of preiudice to anye persone. I cum not to destroy but to build, I cum to reconcyle, not to condemne, I cum not to compel, but

to call againe: I am not cum to call anything in question, alredy done, But my commission is of grace and clemencye to suche as will receaue it. For touchinge al matters that be past, they shal bee as thinges cast into the Sea of forgetfulnes. But the meane wherby you shal receaue this benefit, is to reuoke and repeale those lawes and statutes whiche be impedymentes, blockes and barres to the execution of my cō
               mission. For like as I my self had neyther place nor voice to speake here amonge you, but was to all respectes a banished mā, til such time as ye hadde repealed those lawes that laie in my way: euenso can not you receaue the benifite, and grace offered from the Apostolike Sea, vntyll the abrogacion of suche lawes whereby

you haue disioyned and disseue red your selues from the vnity of Christes Church, it remaineth therfore that you lyke true Christians and prouydente men for the weale of youre soules, and bodies, ponder what is to be don in this so weightye a cause. And so to frame youre actes and procedinges, as they may tend first to the glorye of GOD, and next to the conseruacion of youre cō
               mon wealthe, suertye and quietnes.
            This was the substaunce of my Lorde Cardinalles oration, or rather his tale, whiche he pronounsed in such sort, as no man coulde iudge it any studyed matter, but a thinge spoken Ex tempore. Wherof a frende of myne beeinge a Burges of the Parliamente, and presente at the

same tyme, toke the notes, and gaue me the same in writing, so (as I beleue) nothinge that he spake in effect, is omitted.
            And after that the assemble was broken, my lord Cardinal taking leaue of the king and Quenes magesties, went to hys house at Lambeth. Then shortly after the foresayd thre Estates assembledThe three Estates assembled agayne be fore the kynge and Quenes magesties and my lord Cardynall. agayne in the great Chamber of the Court at Westmister, where the kyng and quenes magestyes and also my Lorde Cardynal being present, they did exhibit syttyng al on their knees a supplicacion to their highnesses. Whiche supplicacion beyng read their maHow they dyd exhibit a supplicacyon to theyr magesties gesties exhibited the same vnto my Lorde Cardinall. Whose reuerence, perceyuing the effecte therof to be correspōdyng to his expectacion, did not only receiue

the same most humbly from their magesties, but also after he had in few woordes geuen thankes to GOD, and hadde declared what greate cause he had to reioyse, aboue al others that his cū
               myng from Rome into Englāde hadde taken moste happye successe, he representyng there the Popes holynes, and hauyng the keys, and hys full power for the tyme, dyd geue them hys Benediccion. Whyche beeyng done, they all departed.

And finallye, vnto what ruyne and decaie the realme of England was like to come, yf almyghtye god of hys goodnes had not blest the same in tyme, with hys moste holye handes. These, wyth manye other notable yea and lamentable lessons, to longe here to bee rehersed, hys Lordeshyppe there declared, whyche moued a greate numbre of the audience, with sorowfull syghes, and wepynge teares to chaunge theyr cheere.
            In thys same selfe sermon

he declared also, how. xix. yeares agoe, at that tyme when the insurreccion was in the north ofHow king Henry the Light. xix. yeares agon thoughte to haue ge uen ouer the supremacye.

            He declared also how the saidHow he sēt to the Em perour for the same e

He declared further, howe in kinge Edwardes dayes, the counsell were once mynded to haue the Pope restored to ye Supremacy,

but the let therof was in those daies, because as it was supposed it would haue ben sayd that the Realme could not be defended durynge the kynges minoritie without the Popes adsistaunce. And finally he declared how the Quenes magestie at her coronacyō thoughte for to haue restored the Popes holynes to his Supremacy, but the tyme (he sayed) was not then. But now (sayd he the tyme is cum that the kinges and Quenes magesties haue restored our holy father the Pope to his Supremacy: And the thre Estates assembled in the parliament representing ye whole body of thys noble Empire of Englād and dominions of the same, haue submitted them selues to his holynes, and his successours foreuer. He declared also howe that the moste Reuerende Father in

God Lorde Cardinall Poole, beinge there put by the kinge, was sent in England as deputed Legat and Ambassadoure from the Sea Apostolyke of Rome, hauinge full and ample commission from the Popes holynes to blesse the realme of Englande. And here also he declared, howe muche bounde Englande is to thanke God, who of his deuine prou

Who for the moste hartye loue that he had to hir hyghenes, lefte his owne countreys, realmes, and regions to strengthē hir most noble grace

& to enriche her Empyre of England. And so to conclude, his lord shippe declared, that all the premisses being well remembred & consydered of all the audience, And also the kyng and Quenes maiesties Godly procedinges beinge of them, and all other theyr true subiectes hartely embraced, and faithfully followed, They al then mighte synge with the Angell whiche appered to the shepherde at the natyuytie and birth of oure sauioure Iesus Christe, Gloria in excelsis deo, et in terra pax hominibus, &c.

                   dies quam fecit dominus, exultemus etletemur in ea.
            
            Whiche sermon beeyng done, the kynges magestie departed to wardes Westminster, & with his highnes my lord Cardinall with

the crosse only borne before him. Syns the day of whiche sermō, all suche thynges as were amis and out of order here, begin now to cum in rule and square, and occupye their auncyente and accustomed places.
            And the moste holy Catholike fayth and true relygion of Christ whyche in Englande hath been thys long tyme behynde the post and in Captiuitie, is now, being delyuered and cummyng home agayne, of all bothe younge and olde, embraced, worshipped & honoured. And all erronious doctrine & heretical bokes with the teachers & setters fourth of the same, are cōuicted, abolished, yea, explosed and dryuen out of Englande for euer. And finallye all they whiche were herers and fauorers of them, nowe layinge theyr handes to theyr heartes,

and perceauinge theym selues seduced and deceaued by suche meanes, are sory, and do hartlye repent, mynding faithfully from hensforth their fautes to amend. Amongest whome I can no les do (
                  •…
               y very good lorde) thenne numbre my selfe as one. For althoughe I was neuer (praysed by god) associated with any which wer erronious, or suspected to be fautours and defendours of hereticall, and sinistrate opinions: but liuinge vnder silence during the two late kinges procedinges haue kept my selfe clere on euery side, Yet neuertheles, as oftē as I haue, & do remēber we my selfe how lasciuiously I liued in Eng lād these. xx. yeres, & ye most part thereof haue followed the same trade of liberty & voluptuous liuing as a great nūbre haue done: where

I myghte haue had endeuoured myselfe in the meane season, to vertuous learning and studye: I can no les doe, then lament▪ and be sory: yea and with all my hart to repente as others doe, Purposinge (by Gods grace) with them to mend my most miserable, and synfull lyfe, and so to continew to my lyues ende.
            In whiche doing I with those whiche haue thus offēded, & they with me, may be assured, that our Sauiour Christ according vnto his owne infallible wordes, spoken of one in the name of al sinners, wil haue mercy, pity & compassion on vs, saying: Nolo mortem peccatoris, sed magis ut cōuertatur et uiuat
            
            And thus England, and al we that dwel therein, accoumpt our selues not onely happy, yea and most happy, which from so many

outragious stormes of errours, cares, and calamities, are thus called home agayne to the sure hauen and porte of the most holy Catholyke faythe: But also we do beleue with our very hartes, and do confesse with al our mouthes, that almighty God of hys deuine prouidēce hath preserued and kept. iii. persons, as lode▪star res and chiefe guydes, for the defending, inbringinge, and restoring of Englande thus to the vnitie of Christes churche.

iye, whiche as roaryng Lions would haue deuoured her. The second is my lord Cardinal, who beyng an exile out of hys natiue countreth Englande, these xxi. yeares, for the two causes before mencioned, and in the meane season, so abhorred, so hated, and so detested as no man durst scars ones name him, whō the quenes magestie nowe hath restored to his bloud, and to the honor of his house. And the thirde is my lorde the Bishop of wynchester Lord
                  •…
                Chaunceller of England, against whom, from tyme to tyme suche sharpe snares haue been layed, and suche ordinaunce leueled, for that he fauored, and wold haue had to his power defended y• most holy Catholicke fayth that it is a wounder howe he, hathescaped, and speciallye at hys late being in London Toure.
            
               But suche are the woorkes of GOD the author of all goodnesse, who alwayes when it pleaseth him plucketh downe and deposeth the proude and hyghe minded, and defendeth and exalteth the humble, & lowe of Spirite. So that now all Christe ndō as well as Englande, doth con fesse that these forenamed iii. per sons haue been thus, throughe the prouidence of god moste hap ply defended, preserued, and kept frō their enemies hādes, aboue the expectacion and iudgement of all menne, for the restoring of Englande agayne to the vnitie of Christes religion. Whiche (no dout it is) shalbe to the glorye of God, the wealth of Englande, & to the perpetuall peace, loue, and quietnes of this most noble, and hole yle of Britayn.
            Other newes I haue none, but

those newes, which most Ioifully reioyseth all Englande, That the Quenes magestie is conceaued with Childe whom our Lord long preserue, and send hir highnes a gracyous delyueraunce. And also that in Christmasse holydayes, the Prynce of Piemont arryued in Englande, and shortly after hym the prynce of Orēge whiche are very pryncely intreated with the king and Quenes Magesties. And beecause I thought youre lordeship woulde be somwhat desirous to knowe the stature and shape of this noble prince the kynges magestie of Englande that nowe is, whō you haue not yet sene, I thought it not muche amysse to descrybe hys person by wryting that your mynde may conceaue that which your iye hath not seen. As for the quenes most excellent magesties

person whose person you haue so often tymes sene, I shall not greatly nede to depaīte vnto you: Understande therfore, that touchyng hys highth, I can wel compareThe kiges forme and stature. hym to Iohn Hume my lord of Iedwardes kinsman. Of visage, he is well fauored, with a brod forhead, & gray iyes, streight nosed, and manly countenaūce. From the forhead to the point of hys chynne, hys face groweth smal: his pace is prīcely, and gate so straight and vpright, as he leseth no inche of his higthe, with a yeallowe head, and a yeallowe berde. And thus to conclude, he is so wel proporcioned of bodi, arme legge and euery other Limme to the same, as nature cannot work a more parfite paterne. And as I haue learned, of the age of. xxviii yeares. Whose maiesty I iudge to bee of a stoute stomake, pregnaunt

witted and of most ientel nature.
            I haue also sent your lordship certaine verses and adages writ ten with the hande of the Lorde Henry Stuarde, lorde Dernley, your nephew, which he wrot this tyme twelue moneth: I beinge with him then at Temple Newsome in Yorkshire. And what praise your Lordship may thinke him worthie, for this his towardnes in wrighting, beinge yet not fully. ix. yeares of age, The like praise is he worthye (suerlye) in his towardnes in the latin toūge and the frenche, and in sundrye other vertuous qualities: whom also, God and nature hath endued with a good wit, ientilnes, beutie and fauour. So yf it may please God to lend him long life, he shall proue a witty, vertuous,

and an actiue well learned gentle man. Whose noble parentes are my singuler good patrons. And thustrusting that your good Lordship, of your accustomed humanitie and ientilnes, wil accept thys my symple letter in good part, sent vnto you for this newe yeares gyfte, although it be rude and destitute of wit, lerning and eloquence, I most humbly besech the kyng of kynges, and lorde of lordes, long to preserue and kepe youre Reuerende Lordeship in health, wealth, and fortunate felicitie, with a meri and mani new yeares.
