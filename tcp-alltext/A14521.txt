            By his Maieſties Counſeil for VIRGINIA.
            
               AFter the many diſaſters, wherewith it pleaſed Almighty God to ſuffer the great Enemy of all good Actions and his Inſtruments, to encounter and interrupt, to oppreſſe and keepe weake, this noble Action for the planting of Virginia, with Chriſtian Religion, and Engliſh people: It hauing pleaſed him now contrarily of his eſpeciall great grace, ſo to bleſſe and proſper our late carefull endeauours, as well for the repairing of all former breaches, as for ſupplying of the preſent defects, wherewith the Colony was kept downe, that it hath as it were on a ſodaine growne to double that height, ſtrength, plenty, and proſperity, which it had in former times attained. We haue thought it now the peculiar duety of our place, accordingly

as it hath beene alſo ordered by a generall Court, to Summon as it were by a kinde of louing invitement, the whole Body of the Noble and other worthy Aduenturors, as well to the conſeruing and perfecting of this happy worke, as to the reaping of the fruit of their great expenſes and trauailes.
            And firſt to remoue that vnworthy aſperſion, wherewith ill diſpoſed mindes, guiding their Actions by corrupt ends, haue both by Letters from thence, and by rumours here at home, ſought vniuſtly to ſtaine and blemiſh that Countrey, as being barren and vnprofitable; Wee haue thought it neceſſary for the full ſatisfaction of all, to make it publikely knowne, that by diligent examination wee haue aſſuredly found, thoſe Letters and Rumours to haue beene falſe and malicious; procured by practiſe, and ſuborned to euill purpoſes: And contrarily diſaduowed by the teſtimony vpon Oath of the chiefe Inhabitants of all the Colony; by whom we are aſcertained, that the Countrey is rich, ſpacious, and well watered; temperate as for the Climate; very healthfull after men are a little accuſtomed to it; abounding with all Gods naturall bleſſings: The Land repleniſhed with the goodlieſt Woods in the world, and thoſe full of Deere, and other Beaſts for ſuſtenance: The Seas and Riuers

(whereof many are exceeding faire and nauigable,) full of excellent Fiſh, and of all ſorts deſireable; both Water and Land yeelding Fowle in very great ſtore and variety: In Summe, a Countrey, too good for ill people; and wee hope reſerued by the prouidence of God, for ſuch as ſhall apply themſelues faithfully to his ſeruice, and be a ſtrength and honour to our King and Nation. But touching thoſe Commodities for which that Countrey is proper, and which haue beene lately ſet vp for the Aduenturors benefit: we referre you to a true note of them, lately deliuered in a great and generall Court, and hereunto annexed for your better information. By which and other approued informations brought vnto vs, Wee reſt in great aſſurance, that this Countrey, as it is ſeated neere the midſt of the world, betweene the extreamities of heate and cold; So it alſo participateth of the benefits of bothe, and is capable (being aſſiſted with ſkill and induſtry) of the richeſt commodities of moſt parts of the Earth. The rich Furres, Cauiary, and Cordage, which we draw from Ruſsia with ſo great difficulty, are to be had in Virginia, and the parts adioyning, with eaſe and plenty. The Maſts, Planckes, and Boords, the Pitch and Tarre, the Pot-aſhes and Sope-aſhes, the Hempe and Flax, (being the materials of Linnen,) which

now we fetch from Norway, Denmarke, Poland, and Germany, are there to be had in abundance and great perfection. The Iron, which hath ſo waſted our Engliſh Woods, that it ſelfe in ſhort time muſt decay together with them, is to be had in Virginia (where waſting of Woods is a benefit) for all good conditions anſwerable to the beſt in the world. The Wines, Fruite, and Salt of France▪
                and Spaine; The Silkes of Perſia and Italie, will be found alſo in Virginia, and in no kinde of worth inferior. Wee omit here a multitude of other naturall Commodities, diſpeirſed vp and downe the diuers parts of the world: of Woods, Rootes, and Berries, for excellent Dyes: Of Plants and other Drugges, for Phyſicall ſeruice: Of ſweet Woods, Oyles, and Gummes, for pleaſure and other vſe: Of Cotten-wooll, and Sugar-Canes, all which may there alſo be had in abundance, with an infinity of other more: And will conclude with theſe three, Corne, Cattle, and Fiſh, which are the ſubſtance of the foode of man. The Graines of our Countrey doe proſper there very well: Of Wheate they haue great plenty: But their Maze, being the naturall Graine of that Countrey, doth farre exceede in pleaſantneſſe, ſtrength and fertility. The Cattle which we haue tranſported thither, (being now growne neere to fiue hundred,) become much bigger of Body, then

the breed from which they came: The Horſes alſo more beautifull, and fuller of courage. And ſuch is the extraordinary fertility of that Soyle, that the Does of their Deere yeelde two Fawnes at a birth, and ſometimes three. The Fiſhings at Cape Codd, being within thoſe Limits, will in plenty of Fiſh be equall to thoſe of Newfound Land, and in goodneſſe and greatneſſe much ſuperiour. To conclude, it is a Countrey, which nothing but ignorance can thinke ill of, and which no man but of a corrupt minde and ill purpoſe can defame.
            Now touching the preſent eſtate of our Colony in that Country, Wee haue thought it not vnfit thus much briefly to declare. There haue beene ſent thither this laſt yeare, and are now preſently in going, twelue hundred perſons and vpward, as particularly appeareth in the note aboue ſpecified: and there are neere one thouſand more remaining of thoſe that were gone before. The men lately ſent, haue beene moſt of them choiſe men, borne and bred vp to labour and induſtry. Out of Deuonſhire, about an hundred men, brought vp to Huſbandry. Out of Warwickſhire and Staffordſhire, aboue one hundred and ten; and out of Suſſex about forty; all framed to Iron-workes: the reſt diſperſedly out of diuers Shires of the Realme. There haue beene alſo ſundry perſons of good

quality, much commended for ſufficiency, induſtry and honeſty, prouided and ſent to take charge and gouernment of thoſe people. The care likewiſe that hath beene taken by directions, Inſtructions, Charters, and Commiſſions to reduce the people and affaires in Virginia into a regular courſe, hath beene ſuch and ſo great, that the Colony beginneth now to haue the face and faſhion of an orderly State, and ſuch as is likely to grow and proſper. The people are all diuided into ſeuerall Burroughs; each man hauing the ſhares of Land due to him ſet out, to hold and enioy to him and his Heires. The publique Lands for the Company here, for the Gouernor there, for the College, and for each particular Burrough, for the Miniſters alſo, and for diuers other neceſſary Officers, are likewiſe laid out by order, and bounded. The particular Plantations for diuers priuate Societies, are ſetled in their Seates, being alotted to their content, and each in conuenient diſtance. The rigour of Martiall Law, wherewith before they were gouerned, is reduced within the limits preſcribed by his Maieſty: and the laudable forme of Iuſtice and gouernment vſed in this Realme, eſtabliſhed, and followed as neere as may be. The Gouernour is ſo reſtrained to a Counſeil ioyned with him, that hee can doe wrong to no man, who may not haue ſpeedy

remedy. Each Burrough, and each particular Plantation, partly hath, partly is bound to haue in ſhort time, a ſufficient Miniſter: for whom maintenance is ordained, to each of two hundred pounds a yeere value. Which orderly proceeding there, by direction from hence, hath cauſed the Colony now at length to ſettle themſelues in a firme reſolution to perpetuate the Plantation. They fall to building of Houſes, each for his owne priuate; and the Generalitie to the rearing of publique Gueſt houſes, for intertaining of new men vpon their firſt arriuall. They fall to ſet vp their Ploughes; to the Planting of Vineyards; to the purſuing of the Staple Commodities furniſhed and commended from hence. In ſumme they are now ſo full of alacritie and cheerefulneſſe, that in a late generall Aſſembly, they haue in the name of the Colony preſented their greateſt poſſible thankes to the Company, for the care that hath beene taken for the ſetling of the Plantation. Neither is it to be omitted, the care which hath beene had here lately at home, for the reducing of all the proceedings and affaires of the Company, to an orderly courſe of good gouernment and Iuſtice. Wherein to begin with the fountaine thereof, his Maieſties authority and pleaſure, there hath beene a Collection made of all the branches of the ſame, diſperſed in his Letters Patents, now

three times renewed: as alſo out of other Inſtructions proceeding from his Maieſtie. Out of bothe which, together with ſuch other Orders as (authoriſed by his Maieſtie) the Company themſelues haue thought neceſſary to make, hath beene compiled a Booke of ſtanding Orders and Conſtitutions, approued by the generall Conſent of all the Company: whereby both the company here, and the Colony in Virginia, haue their buſineſſe carried regularly, induſtriouſly, and iuſtly, euery man knowing both his right and duety, to their generall great content, and the great aduancement of the Action. And whereas the Colony likewiſe haue beene often Sutors in effect, to reduce into a compendious and orderly forme in writing, the Lawes of England proper for the vſe of that Plantation, with addition of ſuch other, as the nature of the place, the nouitie of the Colony, and other important circumſtances ſhould neceſſarily require: a courſe is likewiſe taken for the effecting of this worke; yet ſo as to ſubmit it firſt to his Maieſties view and approbation; it being not fit that his Maieſties Subiects ſhould be gouerned by any other Lawes, then ſuch as receiue the influence of their life from him.
            And now to come to that which concerneth the Aduenturors in particular, by whoſe charges, care, and labour (next vnto his Maieſties

eſpeciall grace,) this famous Plantation hath not onely beene vndertaken, but through ſo many difficulties vpheld and continued: wee ſhould be very greatly iniurious to them, if we ſhould not acquaint them with this ſeaſonable time, for the reaping of that benefit and reward which is due vnto them. Wee therefore let them knowe, that in this laſt yeare now ended, there haue beene granted by the Company vnder their legall Seale, eleuen ſeuerall Patents for particular Plantations; and more are in hand to be paſſed this next Quarter-Court. It is not vnprobable, that vpon each of theſe Patents, diuers hundreds of perſons will ſoone Plant in Virginia: there hauing beene already tranſported vpon the firſt, aboue three hundred men. Theſe and other like Planters, hauing priority of time, will haue priority alſo in choiſe of the Seat of their Plantations. Seeing therefore the onely matter of retribution to the Aduenturors, is by a faire proportion of Land to them & their heires; namely of one hundred acres for euery ſhare of twelue pounds and ten ſhillings, vpon a firſt diuiſion; and as much more vpon a ſecond, the firſt being peopled; with fiftie acres for euery perſon, (to be doubled in like manner) which at their owne charges they ſhall tranſport to inhabit in Virginia before the 24. day of Iune 1625. if hee continue there three yeares, either at one

or ſeuerall times, or dye after he is ſhipped for that voyage: It ſtandeth them vpon, who are not willing to be the laſt in the benefit to be partaked, not to be the leaſt in ſetting forth to the choiſe and peopling of their Land. Wherein what fauour or aſſiſtance may by vs be giuen them, they ſhall be well aſſured of it, in equall proportion with our ſelues, as their charges and long expectance haue well deſerued. And to the end that not onely the Aduenturors now liuing, but the Heires alſo of the deceaſed, may take certaine notice of the ſeuerall proportions of Land, which ratably to their Aduentures in mony are due and belonging to them: And likewiſe that Poſteritie may truely know, by whoſe charges this Plantation (next vnder his Maieſtie) hath beene happily founded, maintained, and continued: Wee haue here, according to an Order of Court, ſet downe in an Alphabeticall Table the names of all the Aduenturors, with all their ſeuerall ſums aduentured. Wherein if by error, or other miſ-accident, there haue wrong beene done to any man; if within one twelue moneth after the date hereof, he giue notice and make proofe thereof to the Companies Auditors; hee ſhall be ſet right, and the Table reformed: there being not any thing more deere vnto vs, then to doe Right vnto them

with all Iuſtifiable ▪curteſie, who haue beene beginners and continuers of this glorious worke, tending ſo much to the propagating of the true ſeruice of Almighty God, to the adding of greatneſſe and honour to our King, and to the benefit of our whole Nation in diſburdening their multitude. 22.

               Commodities.
               The Commodities which theſe people are directed principally to apply, (next to their owne neceſſary maintenance) are theſe enſuing:
               IRON: for which are ſent 150. Perſons, to ſet vp three Iron workes; proofe hauing

beene made of the extraordinary goodneſſe of that Iron.
               
               CORDAGE: for which (beſides Hempe) direction is giuen for the planting of Silkegraſſe, (naturally growing in thoſe parts) in great abundance: which is approued to make the beſt Cordage and Linnen in the world. Of this, euery houſe-holder is bound to ſet 100 Plants: and the Gouernour himſelfe hath ſet fiue thouſand.
               POT-ASHES and SOPE-ASHES, PITCH and TARRE: for the making whereof the Polackers are returned to their workes.
               TIMBER of all ſorts, with Maſts, Planks and Boords for prouiſion of Shipping, &c, there being not ſo good Timber for all vſes in any one knowne Countrey whatſoeuer. And for the eaſe and encreaſe of diuers of theſe workes, prouiſion is ſent of men and materials, for the ſetting vp of ſundry Sawing Milles.
               SILKE: for which that Countrey is exceeding proper, hauing innumerable ſtore of Mu bery Trees of the beſt, and ſome ſilkewormes naturally found vpon them, producing excellent Silke: ſome whereof is to be ſeene. For the ſetting vp of which Commoditie, his Maieſty hath beene graciouſly

pleaſed now the ſecond time (the former hauing miſcarried) to beſtow vpon the Company plenty of Silke-wormes ſeed of his owne ſtore, being the beſt.
               VINES: whereof the Countrey yeeldeth naturally great ſtore, and of ſundry ſorts: which by culture will be brought to excellent perfection. For the effecting whereof, diuers skilfull Vignerons are ſent, with ſtore alſo from hence of Vine plants of the beſt ſort.
               SALT: which workes hauing been lately ſuffered to decay, are now ordered to be ſet vp in ſo great plenty, as not onely to ſerue the Colony for the preſent; but as is hoped in ſhort time alſo the great Fiſhings on thoſe Coaſt.
               For the following, working, and perfecting of theſe Commodities, all prouiſions neceſſary for the preſent are ſent in good abundance. As likewiſe the People that goe, are plentifully furniſhed with apparell, bedding, victuall for ſixe moneths: Implements both for Houſe and

yet without any preiudice to the former Magazin.
               
            
            
               Gifts.
               There haue beene giuen to the Colonie this yeere by deuout Perſons, theſe gifts enſuing.

                  Another vnknowne perſon, (together with a godly letter) hath lately ſent to the Treaſurer 550. pounds in gold, for the bringing vp of children of the Infidels: firſt in the Knowledge of God and true Religion; and next, in fit Trades whereby honeſtly to liue.
               Maſter Nicolas Ferrar deceaſed, hath by his Will giuen 300. pounds to the College in Virginia, to be paid, when there ſhall be ten of the Infidels children placed in it. And in the meane time foure and twenty pounds

                  An vnnamed perſon ſent to the Treaſurer the ſumme of ten pounds, for aduancing of the Plantation.

It is to be knowne, that touching the College for the Infidels Children, it hath beene thought more expedient to beginne firſt with the planting and peopling of the Lands: (which hath beene done this yeere:) and afterwards to proceede to the erecting of the Fabricke, which is to be performed out of the reuenues of the Lands.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
            A DECLARATION of the Supplies intended to be ſent to VIRGINIA, in this yeare 1620. By his Maieſties Counſeil for Virginia. 18. Iulij 1620.
            
            
               WHereas the Right Honourable, Henry Earle of Southampton, with the aduiſe and conſent of the Counſeil and Company for Virginia, hath reſolued and concluded to imploy all good meanes in this preſent yeare, 1620. not onely for the aduancing of the Plantation in ſtrength and multitude of good people, but alſo for the enriching thereof with ſtore of cattell of diuers ſorts, and by ſetting vp or encreaſing ſuch Staple Commodities, as being proper for that Countrey, may be alſo of moſt neceſſary vſe for this Realme, and redound in fine to the greateſt benefit of both Aduenturors and Planters, and laſtly

for the eſtabliſhing there of ſuch good Gouernment (originally deriued from the Kings moſt excellent Maieſtie, the firſt and chiefe Founder of this glorious worke) as whereby the people there, diuided in ſoyle onely, but ſtill participating in the religious and happy gouernment of this their natiue Countrey, may continue alwayes as one and the ſame people with vs, according to the moſt Princely direction of his Maieſtie: We haue thought it very neceſſarie for the ſeconding and forwarding of thoſe ſo noble Deſignes, not onely to publiſh them to the Aduenturors in generall, thereby to inuite them to concurre with vs in the ſame, but alſo to ſet downe ſuch particularities requiſite, as whereby the preparations of all ſorts needfull, may vpon this timely warning, both better and more ſeaſonably be made and compaſſed.
            Firſt therefore we haue thought fit, to make it publikely knowne, that beſides the great ſtore of particular Plantations now in prouiding, and like very ſhortly in large proportion to augment, the Company haue reſolued in a late generall Court, by the bleſſing of God, to ſet out this yeere at the publike charge, and to ſend to Virginia, eight hundred choice perſons, of the qualities enſuing: Firſt, foure hundred, to be Tenants of the general land of the Company, to make vp the number of thoſe Tenants ful 500. wherof 200. to be placed at Elizabeth Citie, with the Companies Deputie: 100. at Henrico, 100. at Charles Citie: And at Iames Citie there are a hundred and more already. Secondly, one hundred, to be Tenants to ſuch Officers, &c. as the Court already hath, or ſhall ſhortly appoint: viz. 10. for the Deputy of the Colledge, 40.

for the Companies Deputy, 20. for the Secretary 10. more (beſides 50. already ſent) for the Miniſters: and 20. for the Phiſitian: their care for the eaſe and proſperity of the Colonie, being ſuch and ſo great, as to cauſe them to endowe thoſe Offices and places, (as they haue formerly done others,) with faire poſſeſſions, furniſhed with Tenants and other fit prouiſions: that the people may haue the benefit by them, and yet be freed from the burden. Thirdly one hundred yong Maides to make wiues for theſe Tenants as the former. 90. which haue been lately ſent. Fourthly, one hundred Boyes, to be apprentizes likewiſe to the publike Tenants. Fiftly, one hundred ſeruants to be diſpoſed amongſt the old Planters, which they greatly deſire, and haue offered to defray their charges with very great thankes. And although by reaſon of the preparations already made, the difficulty may be well conceiued to be in great part ouercome, and the profit much more neere, and more eaſie to come by; yet the Companie wholly affecting the peoples proſperity, haue determined to deale both as fauourably in the Contracts, and as bountifully in all ſorts of furniture and prouiſions with the Tenants which ſhal now goe, as they haue done with thoſe, which haue beene formerly ſent. Which conditions it hath beene thought fit here to reinſert and publiſh.
            
               EVery man tranſported into Virginia, with intent there to inhabit, as Tenants to the Common land of the Company, or to the publike land, ſhall be freely landed there at the charge of the Company: And ſhal be furniſhed with prouiſions of victuall for one whole

yeare next after his arriuall, as alſo of Cattle: And with apparell, weapons, tooles and implements, both of houſe and labour, for his neceſſary vſe. He ſhall enioy the ratable moytie of all the profits that ſhall be raiſed of the land on which he ſhall be Planted, as well Corne and Cattle, as other commodities whatſoeuer: the other halfe being due to the Owners of the Land.
               He ſhall be tyed by Couenant, to continue vpon that Land for the Terme of ſeauen yeares: which being expired, it ſhal be in his choyſe, whither to continue there▪ or to remoue to any other place, at his owne will and pleaſure.
            
            Of theſe perſons, one hundred and twenty (ſuch as are to be Tenants) are to be ſhipped here for Virginia, by the midſt of Auguſt now at hand: and the reſt in Ianuary and February enſuing.
            The next preparations are of Cattle of diuers ſorts: whereof there are intended in the next Spring to be ſent theſe enſuing. One hundred Kine, for this addition of 500. Tenants. One hundred Kine more, to remaine in a perpetuall ſtock vpon the Companies Land, to be ſent to new Planters, as hath bin formerly ordered. Foure hundred Goats, twenty Mares, foureſcore Aſſes to be procured from France: The care of prouiding which, is commended to diuers ſelect perſons by parts, and the whole to the ouerſight of the generall Committies.
            
            The 
                  •
               aſt prouiſions appointed to be made, are for the ſetting vp, or increaſing of diuers principal
                  •
                Commodities. For Silke, there is prouiſion to be made, of great ſtore of Silke-worme-ſeede about Michaelmas
               
next: as alſo of men skilfull in the ordering as well of the Wormes, as of their Silke, which are to be ſent away in a Pinnace, in October betimes. For Hempe and Flaxe, Pot-aſhes and Sope-aſhes, Pitch and Tarre, there is a Treaty already on foote, for procuring of men skilfull in thoſe Trades from the Eaſterne parts: beſides the Polakers yet remaining in Virginia. For Wines, it is alſo ordered, that men skilfull be procured in the planting and dreſſing of Vines, out of France and from the Rhene: and from thence alſo and other parts to procure Plants of the beſt kindes. For Oyle, beſides great quantitie to be made out of the Walnuts, growing naturally in Virginia in great abundance, Oliue-Plants are to be prouided from Marſeilles and Ligorno. For Fiſh, which on thoſe Coaſts are taken in great plenty, and in worth much better then in New-found-Land, there is care and a courſe taken, to preſerue the Companies Liberties, and to ſet vp the Fiſhings in better ſort then heretofore. For Salt, order is giuen for the making of it in abundance, and after the manner of thoſe hotter Climates, which may prooue a great helpe to increaſe the Plantation. For Iron, there is ſufficient done alreadie.
            And for Sawing-Milles, beſides thoſe already gone this Spring, there are lately come from Hamborough, diuers Workemen very skilfull, to be ſent in the next ſhip. And that nothing may be wanting for the Companies Tenants, there is a Pinnace already, and other Boates ſhall be prouided, to remaine there at the Deputies commaund, to traffique and trade for the Company and their Tenants vnder his charge.
            
               
Theſe large ſupplies of men, Cattel, and Commodities, as they tend to the accompliſhing of this great worke of the Plantation: ſo can they not be themſelues effected, without large prouiſion of money, being the ſinewes and mouing Inſtruments in theſe great Actions.
            To which end wee deſire the noble and worthy Aduenturors, to be aſſiſting to vs, by ſuch meanes as they ſhall pleaſe: eſpecially that the remaine of all promiſed Aduentures, may in Michaelmas Terme next be paid in without faile, which we truſt will now be done cheerefully on all parts, the inuitements of this yeere being well▪conſidered: that as the preſenting of their firſt payments, hath been the beginning, ſo the performance of the later, may be the perfecting and finiſhing of this worke, ſo glorious before God and man.
            And here by the way, for the clearing of ſome ſcruples and errors through miſtaking of our writings lately publiſhed, we are to aduertiſe, that the Alphabet of Aduenturers and ſummes aduentured, neither then conueniently could, nor was intended to extend any further, then to ſuch ſummes as haue been paid in to the Treaſurors of the Company, and to Sir Baptiſt Hicks, by ſpeciall order of Court. And whereas diuers other bils of Aduenture, haue bin heretofore deliuered, partly vpon perſonall aduenture, and no money paid in, partly vpon gift from the Company, in regard of deſerts, partly for ſummes paid to other men, whoſe Accounts hang yet vncleared (and not to the Treaſurors) and partly for goods which neuer came

within the Treaſurors Accounts, but of other inferiour Officers, into whoſe hands they were deliuered (for which notwithſtanding bils of Aduenture haue been deliuered, mentioning as if it were money paid to the Treaſuror: If the Aduenturors ſhall be pleaſed within the time prefixed, to put in their iuſt claimes, by theſe or any other wayes whatſoeuer, there ſhall be right done to them, and a new alphabeticall booke ſhall be publiſhed, embracing exactly all kinde of Aduenturors, with their ſeueral ſummes either really aduentured, or otherwiſe accepted, allowed or beſtowed be it vpon what cauſe, or in what kinde ſoeuer.
            Now if the Auenturors be thus requeſted with much greater reaſon are all Accountants to the Company to be prayed and required, to prepare and make perfect their ſeuerall Accounts, and to pay in thoſe monyes, which ſhall remaine due to the Company: that ſo all parts concurring with their duties and endeuours, the worke may proceede with generall ioy.
            Laſtly, as heretofore, ſo we now alſo declare, that the perſons to be admitted to goe, as the Companies▪ Tenants, and with the foreſaid conditions, ſhall be no other then good men, that is to ſay of good Trades, of skill in husbandry, or induſtrious labourers; and ſuch of thoſe as ſhall be commended for their honeſt conuerſation: which perſons repairing to the Citie of London in the beginning of Auguſt, and in the middle of Ianuary, next, according to the ſeuerall numbers at thoſe times to be ſent, ſhall from thence-forward be entertained, at the Companies charges, till ſuch time as they be ſhipped for Virginia: there being eſpeciall

care likewiſe taken, for the prouiding of good Commanders and Directors of their workes.

                  IT ſhall not be in the power of any other then a Quarter Court, to make any contract whereby to binde the Company for any continuance of yeares. In which caſe it ſhall be propoſed alſo in the Preparatiue Court next preceding.
               
               
                  
                  VI.

                  THE Treaſuror in the beginning of the Court, at the giuing vp of his Office, ſhall declare by word or writing the preſent eſtate of the Colonie and Planters in Virginia. And deliuer into the Court a Booke of his accounts for the yeere paſt, examined and approued vnder the Auditors hands: Declaring withall the preſent eſtate of the Caſh.
               
               
                  XVII.
                  AFter the choiſe of a Treaſuror, a Deputie ſhall be choſen; then the Auditors, and Comitties; and laſtly the Secretarie, Booke-keeper, Husband, and Bedle.

                  IN regard of the weighty and manifold buſineſſe of this Companie, which is alſo like daily to encreaſe:

No man ſhall be choſen Treaſuror of the Company of Virginia, who at the time of his election is Gouernor of any other Company; but vpon condition that before the next Quarter Court hee effectually reſigne that other Gouernement: except it ſeeme good for the behalfe of both Companies, that the ſame man be alſo Gouernour of the Somer Ilands Company.
               
               
                  XX.
                  IT is for weighty reaſons thought very expedient, that no man continue in the place of Treaſuror or Deputie, aboue three yeares at once.
               
               
                  XXI.
                  FOr the auoiding of diuers inconueniences, It is thought fit, that all elections of principall Officers in or for Virginia, as alſo of the Treaſuror and Deputie here, be performed by a Ballating box, as in ſome other Companies.

                  XXVII.
                  WHereas the Treaſuror is to put to the queſtion all things which the Court requires: It is

explaned to be intended of ſuch things as are not contrary to his Maieſties Letters Patents or Inſtructions, not to the ſtanding Lawes and Orders of the Companie.

                  XXIX.
                  HE is alſo to haue an eſpeciall care, that no Grant or Patent doe paſſe from the Companie, but vpon examination thereof by a ſelect Comittie, who are exactly to obſerue the Orders made concerning them.

                        •
                     es, that they be not wronged by abuſing of them.
