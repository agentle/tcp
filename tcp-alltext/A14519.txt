Counſeil for Virginia.
            
            A BRIEFE DECLARATION
OF
the preſent ſtate of things in Virginia, and
of a Diuiſion to be now made, of ſome part
of thoſe Lands in our actuall poſſeſsion, as well
to all ſuch as haue aduentured their
monyes, as alſo to thoſe that
are Planters there.
            
               WHen firſt it pleaſed GOD
to moue his MAIESTIES
minde, at the humble ſuit
of ſundry his louing Subiects,
to yeeld vnto them
his gracious Priuiledge
for the Virginia Plantation,
it was a thing ſeeming
ſtrange and doubtfull in the eye of the
World, that ſuch and ſo few Vnder-takers
ſhould enterpriſe a charge of that waight, as

rather beſeemed a whole State and Commonwealth
to take in hand. But ſuch was the ſucceſſe
of their ſundry attempts, in the happy
diſcouery of ſo goodly a Land, the Deſcription
of which, for the excellencie of the Climate
and fertilitie thereof, had ſoone obtayned
to lay ſuch an aſſured ground of future
hope, in the ſence and vnderſtanding of all
men rightly weighing it, that not long after,
the
                  •
               r new Letters Patents, with more ample priuiledges
granted by his Maieſtie, were almoſt
filled with many hundred Names, both Honourable,
and others of all ſorts, that gaue their
hands and conſent to further and vphold that
honourable action.
            Vpon which encouragement of ſo many
worthy Patrons, the Companie very deepely
engaged themſelues, in ſending Men and
Ships, Cattle, and all kinde of prouiſions, with
Gouernours and Captaines for peace and war,
inſomuch as no earthly meanes ſeemed then
wanting for the ſpeedy reducing of that barbarous
Nation, and ſauage people, to a quiet Chriſtian
Common-wealth.
            But ſuch was the will of Almighty God, as
the world well knoweth, that this great hope
and preparation, by many diſaſters on Sea and
Land, too long to be here recited, was in a
manner cleane defeated, and there onely remained
a poore remnant of thoſe Men and Women,

Cattle and prouiſions, that eſcaped the
danger and which are now remayning there
to rayſe and build vp that intended Colonie.
            Which when thoſe Gentlemen th'aduenturers
here ſaw, and that the expectance of ſo great a
preparation brought nothing home but aduerſe
ſucceſſe and bad reports, they for the
moſt part withdrew themſelues, in deſpaire of
the enterprize, and ſo gaue it ouer, not enduring
to repayre the ruines, nor to ſupply what
themſelues had vnderwritten, to diſcharge the
deepe engagement, whereinto the Company
was drawne by their encouragement.
            By whoſe vnconſtancie and irreſolution, the
hope of that Plantation, together with the liues
of our people there, had then vtterly periſhed,
had not Gods ſecret purpoſe beene more
ſtrongly fixed to vphold the ſame, by ſtirring
vp the mindes and vndaunted ſpirits of a very
ſmall remnant of conſtant Aduenturers, that
with Sir Thomas Smith (their Treaſurer and Gouernour
from the beginning) in all that time of
three yeares diſaſter, were neuer diſcouraged,
nor withdrew themſelues from weekely Courts
and meetings, yeelding their purſes, credit and
counſeil, from time to time, to make new ſupplies,
euen beyond their proportion, to vphold
the Plantation.
            Inſomuch as by the fauourable aſſiſtance of
God, who in his owne wiſdome doth oftentimes

effect the greateſt ends by weakeſt meanes, it is
now come to paſſe, that our Engliſh Colonie
there, ſubſiſteth in a very good and proſperous
condition: They ſow and reape their Corne in
ſufficient proportion, without want or impeachment;
their Kine multiply already to ſome
hundreds, their Swine to many thouſands, their
Goates and Poultry in great numbers, euery
man hath houſe and ground to his owne vſe,
and now being able to maintaine themſelues
with food, they are alſo prepared and ready,
once hauing the meanes, to ſet vpon the Minerals,
whereof there are many ſorts; as alſo to
plant and ſow ſuch ſeuerall kindes of Seeds and
Fruits, as may beſt befit the Soyle and Climate,
to make the Land profitable to themſelues and
th'Aduenturers.
            This being a true Relation of the preſent
ſtate and hope of things in VIRGINIA, wee
thought good in this ſhort manner to mention
it by the way, as well to giue thoſe worthy Gouernours
in VIRGINIA their deſerued praiſe, for
the vnſpeakable paines and hazzard which they
haue endured there, in framing the people and
Plantation to ſo happy a forme, as alſo to withdraw
the deſpayring thoughts of ſuch old retyred
Aduenturers, that make no other reckoning,
but whatſoeuer hath beene ſpent vpon the
name of VIRGINIA to be loſt and caſt away;
the ſpeciall purpoſe of this our Publication,

being to another end, which for the further ſatiſfying
of all reaſonable minded, wee will now in
few words deliuer.
            It was publiſhed to the world, about ſeauen
yeares ſince, and the time is now expired, wherein
wee promiſed to cauſe a Diuident to be made
of the Lands in Virginia, as well to euery mans
perſon that went himſelfe to the Plantation, as
to euery particular man that had aduentured
his money.
            And in as much as we are now by the Natiues
liking and conſent, in actuall poſſeſſion of a
great part of the Country, the other part not
as yet freed from encomber of woods and
trees, nor throughly ſuruayed, whereby to make
a Diuident of the whole: yet of that part which
is now fit for Plantation, we intend God willing
to beginne a preſent Diuiſion by Lot to
euery man that hath already aduentured his
mony or perſon, for euery ſingle ſhare of twelue
pound tenne ſhillings, fifty Acres of Land, till
further opportunitie will afford to diuide the
reſt, which we doubt not will bring at leaſt two
hundred Acres to euery ſingle ſhare.
            This Diuiſion is intended to be done by a
new Gouernour with Commiſſioners and Surveyers
to be ſent from hence to ioyne with
others that are there already, to giue euery man
his Lot in due proportion, according to ſuch

indifferent Directions as ſhall be giuen them in
charge.
            And foraſmuch as this courſe of ſending a
Gouernor with Commiſſioners and a Suruayor,
with Men, Ships, and ſundry prouiſions, for fortifications
and other occaſions, as all men may
conceiue, cannot bee effected without great
charge and expence to the Company; it is therefore
thought requiſite, and determined, that ſo
many Aduenturers as will partake of this firſt
Diuident, ſhall preſent their Names, with their
number of ſhares, into a Booke remayning at Sir
Thomas Smiths for that purpoſe, before the 25.
of Iune next.
            And they ſhall alſo promiſe vnder their hands,
to contribute to the ſaid charge, the ſumme of
twelue pound ten ſhillings, to be paid within
one Moneth after Subſcription, whether his
ſhares be more or leſſe, except any man ſhall be
pleaſed to aduenture more, and for which
twelue pound ten ſhillings (or more if hee will)
he ſhall alſo haue a further Diuident of land in
proportion, as for all other his monies formerly
aduentured. But for ſuch as are not able to lay
downe preſent monie, if they ſhall deſire fauour,
it is agreed for them, that the Treaſurer may
receiue the one halfe of their ſaid aduenture in
preſent money, after their vnderwriting, to furniſh
out the ſhips, and the other halfe at ſixe
Moneths after that.
            
               
And that no man may hereafter excuſe himſelfe
by ignorance, nor taxe the Company for
concealing their purpoſe, we declare to all men,
that this preſent Diuiſion is to be onely in the
Lands lying along the Kings Riuer on both
ſides, and all about the new Townes erected; in
which ſo many as ſhall giue in their names as
aforeſaid, may haue their parts, and thoſe that
will not, may at their pleaſure forbeare till hereafter,
to take their Lot vpon the ſame tearmes
in places more remote.
            The Names of all ſuch as will partake of this
Diuident, ſhall be giuen in writing to the Commiſſioners
before they goe hence, at whoſe returne
they ſhall bring with them a perfect Map
and Deſcription of the ſaid lands and ground
diuided, that euery man may ſee and know in
what condition and where his land lyeth, that
accordingly he may diſpoſe thereof at his pleaſure,
eyther by going himſelfe in perſon to poſſeſſe
it, or by ſending families to manure it for
yearely rent, or for halfe the cleare profits as
many others doe.
            And furthermore, euery mans portion allotted
to him, ſhall be confirmed as ſtate of inheritance
to him and his heyres for euer, with
bounds and limits vnder the Companies Seale,
to be holden of his Maieſtie, as of his Manour
of Eaſt Greenwich, in Socage Tenure, and not in
Capite, according to his Maieſties gracious Letters

Patents already granted to the VIRGINIA
Company in that behalfe.
            And notwithſtanding, as we hope, the chiefe
brunt and doubt of that Plantation is now ouerpaſt,
whereof to their great charge and hazzard
the old Aduenturers haue endured the moſt difficult
part, and might therefore iuſtly appropriate
this preſent Diuident to themſelues, yet at
the motion and deſire of many Gentlemen and
others, intending to be new aduenturers, it is reſolued
and granted by the Company, that all
new Aduenturers, ſubſcribing and performing
the conditions before mentioned, for twelue
pound tenne ſhillings, or more, ſhall partake in
proportion as freely in this preſent Diuident,
and in any other priuiledge and freedome
in VIRGINIA, as if with the
old Aduenturers they had
been partakers from
the beginning.
