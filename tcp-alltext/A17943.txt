            ¶The Prologe.
            
               THe firste treatyce of this presēt boke is taken out of the newe Legende of the sayntys of Englande Irelande / Scotlande / and Wales for theym that vnderstande not the Laten tonge / that they atte theyr pleasure may be occupyed therwith / and be therby ye more apte to lerne the resydue when they shall here the hole Legende / And it is to vnderstande yt nat oonly those sayntes that were borne in theyse Countreys be in the sayde Legende and ī this lytell treatyse / But also dyuerse other blessyd sayntes that were borne beyonde the see / and that came into any of theyse countreys Englande / Irelande / Scotlā
               de / and Wales doynge there any notable thynge to the honour of god / and to the profyte of the people as to preche to theym the Faythe of oure Lorde / and to sette the people in good ordre / Or that haue lyued a blessyd lyfe ī any of theyse Countreys to gyue the people example of good lyuynge / Be also in the sayde Legende and in this present treatyse & be accompted to be of that countrey that they so came into / As seynt Augustyne the appostell of Englande whom blessyd seynt Gregorye then beynge pope sent fro Rome with seynt Paulyn / seynt Laurence the confessoure and dyuerse other in his company to preche the faythe of oure Lorde to the people of this Realme then beynge Idolatroures and clerely alyenatyd fro trueth wherupon Seynt Augustyne Faythfully accomplysshynge his Auctoryte with his company conuertyd Seynt Ethelbert then kynge of Kent and all his people to the fayth of our lorde / And after seynt Paulyne conuerted seynt Edwyn then kynge of Northamhumbre and all his people / in whiche countreys Churches were buylded Temples of Idollys destroyed or turned into Churches / bysshoppes & preestes ordeyned in all the countrey

/ And the fayth gladly resceyued with great deuocyon and after ye deth of seynt Augustyne and of kyng Ethelbert kynge Edbalde yt was sone to kynge Ethelbert fell to Idolatrye forsakynge the cristen fayth / wherby the faythe there was lyke to haue holly perysshed / whom ye sayd seynt Laurēce which was busshop of Caūterbury next after seynt Augustyne by especyall myracle of seynt Peter reduced agayne to the faythe / as in the lyfe of seynt Laurence apperyth / & longe after theyr tyme other holy men / seynt Adryan / seynt Honorye / seynt Felyx / seynt Beryn / and dyuers other cam fro beyonde the see and moche edefyed the people ī this Realme of Englande and establysshed greatly that fayth whiche seynt Augustyne / seynt Paulyne / seynt Laurence and theyr company had begon / & also dyuerse countreys in Englande whiche were nat holly conuerted in seynt Augustynes dayes / & some that after his dayes fell agayne to Idolatrye thē they reduced to the fayth of our lord. And neuerthelesse ryght fewe of this Realme of Englande specyally of ye Cōmen people haue harde of any suche men in soo moche yt ye oonly herynge of theyr names wyll be a lernynge to most men / and so it wyll be of dyuerse other blessyd men and women that were borne ī this Realme / whiche haue done many notable thynges for the comen welthe of the people therof as well ꝓfytable for this lyfe as for ye lyfe to come / as seynt Dunstane / seynt Deus dedit / seynt Wylfryde / Seynt Oswalde / seynt Cedd / and seynt Chadde bysshoppes / Seynt Ethelbert / seynt Edwyn / seynt Edgare / and seynt Oswalde kyngys / seynt Sexburgh / & seynt Ermenylde quenes / seynt Wallen / seynt Gylbert / seynt Wulryke / and dyuerse other holy men and women / as in the sayd Legende / and also in this treatyse apperyth / by which gloryouse sayntys wt
               
other borne in other Countreys as before apꝑyth the fayth of our Lorde hath ben p̄ched receyued & greatly prosperyd in this Realme so that many of oure Auncestours neyghboures and frendes by the mercye of our lorde be now in ye Ioyes of heuyn to praye for vs. And for all the people & we also by the grace & goodnes of our lord be heyrys apparaū
               te to the kyngedome of heuyn / And if the lawe of god had nat ben knowen ī theyse parties both we & our Aūcestours myght ꝑcase haue lyued in erroures as other do / wherfore we be moche boūden to loue theym & honoure them / & in lykewyse to do that is in vs to helpe other as they dyd to helpe vs our Aūcestours and frendys / And veryly if there were nowe in thyse dayes the hygh Charyte & ꝑfyte loue to almyghty god & to oure neyghboure yt was in theyse blessyd seyntes or at leest a desyre therto with loue of Iustyce & zele of ye comen welthe & lyke desyre to brynge ye people to good lyfe with hole truste & sure faythe ī our lord as was ī theyse blessyd men & women. It wolde renewe ye face of this worlde and brynge a newe lyghte amonge the people / as it dyd in the tyme of ye sayd gloryous seyntys in whom florysshed & shyned all ꝑfeccyon of vertues as euydently wyll appere to theym that wyll rede theyr Legende trewe mekenes inuyncyble pacyence symple obedyence heuenly wysdome ꝑfyght charyte loue of Iustice with mercye / pyte / & cōpassyon vppon theyr neyghbourys ryches in pouerte / & pouerte in ryches with other lyke vertues and gracyous gyftes of god many of them were nedye outwarde but within forthe they were replenyssed with goostlye swetnes and Comforte / In the syght of the worlde and in theyr owne syght they were vyle and abiecte / but in the syght of almyghtye god & of all seyntes they were precyous & syngulerly elect / Wherfore

the people of Irelande haue seynt Patryke for his blessyd lyfe and for that he conuerted moche people there to the faythe in great honour and in theyr necessyties they call vnto hym for helpe with great deuocyon / And in lykewyse in Scotlande the people there haue seynt Nynian cōmenlye called seynt Tronyon in great honoure for the same cause / And in Wales they haue deuocyon to seynt Dauyd for his blessyd lyfe / and for confermynge and establysshynge of ye people in the faythe by his prechynge & good example / but in this Realme of Englonde what so euer is the occasyon / fewe people in comparyson of the multytude haue deuocyon to any of thyse blessyd seyntes that haue laboured for the welthe of the people in this Realme ī tyme paste or that haue theym in honoure as other Countreys haue other seyntes in lyke case & yet we knowe ryght well that seyntys in heuyn be ī suche fauoure with almyghty god ye theyre prayer is herde for suche persones as they pray for and we maye not dowte but they be redye to pray for vs if we do worship theym and call vnto theym by our prayer for helpe. God forbede that any of vs shulde thynke or saye the contrarye as thynkynge in his mynde or sayinge in this wyse / Sayntes be aboue ī heuen and we be here bynethe and therfore they haue no mynde vppon vs for to helpe vs or to pray for vs so to thynke or so to saye is to thynke playnly and to saye that seyntys haue no charyte & that is not so for if they had charyte when they were here ī Erthe moche more they haue it nowe in heuen But when they were here they hadde great charyte as it is open by the great labourys that they hadde for the saluacyon of the people of this Realme and prayed for theym not callyd vppon so to doo / Thenne what shall the great charyte do that they haue nowe in heuen / Let vs

beleue as seynt Paule sayth. Charitas nun
