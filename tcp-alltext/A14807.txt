      
         
            
            A Ditty delightfull of mother watkins ale
            
               A warning wel wayed, though counted a tale.
            
               THere was a maid this other day,
               and she would needs go forth to play.
               And as she walked she sithd and said,
               I am afraid to die a mayd.
               With that: behard a Lad,
               What talke this maiden had,
               whereof he was full glad,
               and did not spare,
               To say, faire mayd I pray,
               whether goe you to play:
               Good sir then did she say,
               what do you care?
               For I will without faile
               Mayden, giue you Watkins ale,
               Watkins ale good sir quoth she,
               what is that I pray you tel me.
            
            
               Tis sweeter farre then Suger fine,
               And pleasanter than Muskadine,
               And if you please faire mayd to stay,
               A little while with me to play:
               I will giue you the same,
               watkins ale cald by name:
               Or els I were to blame,
               in truth faire mayd.
               Good sir quoth she againe,
               Yf you will take the paine:
               I will it not refraine,
               nor be dismayd.
               He toke this mayden then aside,
               And led her where she was not spyde,
               And told her many a pretty tale,
               And gaue her well of watkins ale.
            
            
               Good sir quoth she in smiling sort,
               what doe you call this prety sport?
               Or what is this you do to me?
               Tis called Watkins ale quoth he.
               wherein (faire mayd you may)
               Report an other day.
               When you go forth to play,
               how you did speed:
               In déed (good sir quoth she)
               It is a prety glee.
               And well it pleaseth me.
               no doubt indéed.
               Thus they sported and they playd,
               This yongman and this prety mayd,
               Under a banke whereas they lay,
               Not long agoe this other day.
            
            
               When he had done to her his will,
               They talkt, but what it shall not skill:
               At last quoth she, sauing your tale,
               Giue me some more of Watkins ale.
               Or else I will not stay,
               For I must néeds away,
               My mother bad me play,
               the time is past:
               therfore good sir quoth she,
               If you haue done with me,
               Nay soft faire maid quoth he,
               againe at last.
               Let vs talke a little while,
               With that the ma
                     ••
                   began to smile,
               And saide good sir full well I know,
               Your ale I see runs very low.
            
            
               This yongman then being so blamd,
               Did blush as one being a shamde:
               He tooke her by the midle small,
               And gaue her more of watkins ale:
               and saide faire maid I pray
               when you goe forth to play,
               Remember what I say,
               walke not alone.
               Good sir quoth she againe,
               I thanke you for your paine,
               For feare of further staine,
               I will be gone.
               Farewell mayden then quoth he,
               Adue good sir againe quoth she,
               Thus they parted at last,
               Till thrice three months were gone and past.
            
            
               This mayden then fell very sicke,
               Her mayden head began to kicke,
               Her colour waxed wan and pale,
               With taking much of Watkins ale,
               I wish all maydens coy,
               That heare this prety toy,
               Wherein most women ioy,
               how they doe sport:
               For surely Watkins ale,
               And if it be not stale,
               Will turne them to some bale.
               as hath report.
               New ale will make their bellies bowne,
               As trial by this same is knowne,
               this prouerbe hath bin taught in schools,
               It is no iesting with edge tooles.
            
            
               Thrise scarcely changed hath the moon
               Since first this pretty tricke was done,
               Which bring harde of one by chance,
               He made thereof a country dance.
               And as I heard the tale,
               he cald it Watkins ale,
               which neuer will be stale,
               I doe beléeue:
               This dance is now in prime,
               and chiefly vsde this time,
               And lately put in rime:
               let no man greeue,
               To heare this merry iesting tale,
               The which is called watkins ale:
               It is not long since it was made,
               The finest flower will soonest fade.
            
            
               Good maydes and wiues I pardon craue
               And lack not that which you would haue
               To blush it is a womans grace,
               And well becometh a maidens face,
               For women will refuse,
               the thing that they would chuse
               Cause men should them excuse.
               of thinking ill:
               Cat will after kind,
               all winkers are not blind,
               Faire maydes you know my mind,
               say what you will.
               UUhen you drinke ale beware the toast
               For therein lay the danger most:
               If any heere offended be,
               Then blame the author, blame not me.
            
            FINIS.
