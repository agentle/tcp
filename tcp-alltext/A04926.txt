            THE EPISTLE OF A BAnyshed manne out of Leycester Shire sometyme one of the Preachers of Goddes worde there, to the Christen reader wysheth health, delyueraunce, and felicitie.
            THere hath bene no tyme syth the fyrst fashionynge of man whiche hath not had her manyfold myseries and great troubles by which God chaistened and punished all men for their euel lyfe and vnthanckfulnes to hym, continually refusyng his callyng and warnyng, wherof the ryghteous and iuste had their partes, althoughe it was for their cōmoditie & profit, (but to the vtter destruccion of the wycked and vngodly) for iudgement begynneth at the faythful, which are called the housholde of God in the Scripture,1. Petri. 4. and the punyshment wherby God chasteneth them cōmeth alwayes to them for the best, either to the bringyng of pacience, or the acknowlegyng of their synnes, or for the auoidynge

of the eternall condempnatiō: And their fashion is, when they perceaue the hāde of the Lorde to be vpon them, or vpon others, by any maner of trouble, as pouertie, sycknes, banishment, fallynge awaye of faithful frendes, encreasyng of foes, or any other lyke trouble. Immediatly they turne to God, are hertely sorye for their synnes and vnthankful nes, confesseth them selues giltie, & calleth earnestly for mercye, whiche God for, and in Iesus Christ graū

So as in ye myddest of their troubles he hath vsed al wayes to comforte them, yea, helpe and deliuer them, as it appeareth by Noe, Abrahā, Loth, and the patriarkes, Dauid and Ezechia kynhes: Helye, Hieremy, and Daniel, prophetes, Susanna, a woman. Peter, Paule, and the reste of the Apostles together with al good persones, in all tymes and ages, who in their great troubles, chaunges of estates and kyngdomes, and destruccion of their cōmō wealthes, after they had turned to God. from whence those plagues came, foūd reliefe, helpe, cō

Thys was the onely remedye and defence for all good men: thyther hath bene their chef refuge, there fastened they their hope, and rested not cōtinually callyng vpon hym, vntyl they obreyned their requestes: or els yt whiche made moste for Goddes glorie and their commoditie and profyt, but cō

For so sone as they are plaged or punyshed they grudge agaīst God, they hate hym, and speake dispitefully against hym, they ascribe theyr plagues to euel luck or to misfortune, they are nothyng moued by them to acknowledge their great sinnes, therfore they call not vpon him, but eyther they do runne in dispaire or in contempt of God, and therfore it can not be thought yt their punyshmentes are tokens of the rest & quietnes that they maye haue after thys lyfe, but rather to be the begynnyng of their tormentes whiche they shallGenes. 4 thē suffre. The examples wherof are lykewyse set out to vs in ye  holy Scri ptures, as of Cain, of the Iewes as wel before the cōmyng of Christe as

And so, as for the same purpose I was turnyng my boke, I chaunsed to se a note in the Margine written thus in Latyn: Videat Anglia. Let Englande beware. Which note whē I had considered, I founde that the matter written in my boke in Latin was this:

Whiche thing as they attempted to obey, and for the same purpose did trauail and rowe forth in the Sea, the night approched, the wynde was contrarie, the vehement and raging storme arose, & was like to ouerthrowe their poore Bote and them.

And shortly it came to my minde that the same place of Scripture I had entreated in youre presences, what tyme God gaue oportunitie & space, that you should heare, & Goddes messenger should speake the wordes of eternal lyfe. Wherfore I thought nothing more expedient, then shortly to cal to mind againe suche thinges as thē I trust were touched. Albeit peraduenture neither of me so plainly vttered, neither of you so plainly perceaued, as these moste dolorouse daies declare the same to vs.

            The Ministers who were the distributours of this bread (the true worde of God) wherwith the multi tude within Englande was fedde, lacked not their offences, which also moued God to sende vs to the sea.
            And because the offences of no man are so manifest vnto me as are myne owne, only of my selfe I wyl be thac cusoure.
            It is not vnknowen vnto many, that I (the moste wretched) was one of that nombre, whom God appointed to receaue that bread (as it was broken by Christ Iesus) to distribute and geue the same to suche as he had called to this banket, in that parte of his table where he appointed me to serue. It is not in my knowlege nor

iudgement to define nor determine what porcion or quantitie euery mā receaued of this breade, neither yet howe that whiche they receaued agreed with their stomackes. But of this I am assured, that the benedicciō of Christ Iesus so multiplied the porcion that I receyued of his handes, that duryng that banket (this I writte to the prayse of his name, and to the accusacion of myne owne vnthankfulnes) the bread neuer failed, when the hongry soule craued or cry ed for foode, and at the ende of the banket, myne owne conscicnce beareth wytnesse, that my handes gathered vp the crummes that were lefte in suche abundaunce, that my basket was ful amonge the reste.

            The thyrd watch is not yet ended,Christ came not to hys Disciples til the fowrth watch. Remembre that Christe Iesus came not to his disciples till it was

the fourth watch, and they were then in no lesse daunger than yow be nowe, for theyr fayth faynted, and their bodies were in daunger. But Christe Iesus came, whan they loked not for him. And so shal he do to yow, yf you wil continue in the profession that yow haue made.
            This darre I be bold to promese in the name of hym, whose eternal veritie and gloriouse gospel ye haue harde and receaued. Who also putteth in to myn hert an earnest thrist (God knoweth. I lye not) of your sal uacion, and some care also for you re bodies, which nowe I wil not expresse.
            Thus shortly haue I passed thorowe the outrages tempest, wherin the disciples of Christe were tēpted, after that the great multitude were by Christe fedde in the deserte. Omit tinge many profitable notes, which myght wel haue bene marcked in the terte, because my purpose is at this present not to be tediouse nor yet curiouse, but onlie to note such thinges, as be aggreable to these most dolorouse dayes.
            
               And so let vs nowe speake of the ende of this storme and trouble, in which I finde foure thinges cheflye to be noted.
            
               1. Firste, that the disciples at the pre sence of Christe were more affrayed then they were before.
               2. Secondlye, that Christe vseth no other instrument but his worde to pacifie their hertes.
               3. Thyrdlye, that Peter in a feruencie firste left his bote, and yet after feared.
               4. Last, that Christe permitted neyther Peter nor the rest of his disciples to perish in that feare, but gloriously deliuered al, and pacified the tempeste.
            
            Theyr greate fear and the cause therof are expressed in the texte in these wordes: When the disciples sawe him walking vpon the sea, they were afrayed sayinge▪ that he was a spirite. And they cryed thorowe feare.
            It is not my purpose in this treaties to speake of spirites, nor yet to dispute, whether spirites good or bad maye appeare and trouble men: neither yet to inquire, why mānes

natur is affrayed for spirites, and so vehementlie abhorreth their presen ce and company. But my purpose is only to speake of thinges necessarie for this tyme.Thre causes why Christes Disciples mysknew hym.
            
            And firste let vs consyder, that ther was thre causes, why the disciples knewe not Christe, but iudged him to be a spirite.
            The first cause was the darknesse  of the nyght.
            The second was the vnaccustomed  vision that appeared. And the thirde was the daūger and tempest, in which they so earnestly labored for the sauegard of their selues.
            The darknesse (I saye) of the nyght letted theyr eyes to see hym: And it was aboue nature, that a massye, heuy and weyghtie body of a man (suche as they vnderstode their master Christe to haue) shuld walke, go vpon, or be borne vp of the water of the ragynge sea, and not sincke. And finally the horroure of the tempest and greate daunger that they were in perswaded them to loke for none other but certaynly to be drouned.
            And so al these thre thinges concur rynge together confirmed in them

this imaginaciō, that Christe Iesus, who came to theyr greate comforte and deliueraūce, was a fearfull and wicked spirite appearyng to theirVvhat cha unsed to Christe, that also in all ages chaunseth to his holy worde. destruccyon.
            What here chaunsed to Christe Iesus him self, that I myght proue to haue chaunsed and dayly to chaū
               ce to the veritie of his blessed worde in al ages from the begynnynge.
            For as Christe hym self in this their trouble, was iudged and estemed by his disciples at the firste syght a spirite or phantastical body: so is the truth and syncere preachinge of his gloriouse gospel sent by God for mā
               nes most comforte, delyueraunce frō synn, and quietnesse of conscience, whā it is firste offered and truly preached, it is (I saye) no lesse but iudged to be heresye and disceauable doctrine, sent by the deuel to mannes destruccion.
            The cause herof is the darke ignoraunce of God, which in euery ag

But this matter I omitte and let passe, til more opportunitie.

And the more nyghe that Goddes vengeaunce approacheth to the reprobate, the more proude, cruel and arrogāt are they. Wherby it commonly commeth to passe, that the veray mes syngers of lyfe are iudged and demed to be the authors of al mischefe▪ And this in many histories is eui dent. Whan God had appoynted to delyuer the afflicted Israelites by the hand of Moses from the Tyranny

of the Egypcians, and Moses was sente to the presence of Pharao for the same purpose, such was their affliccion and anguyshe by the crueltie which newly was exercysed ouer them, that with open mouthes they cursed Moses (and noExod. 5. 6. &c. doute in their hertes they hated god who sent hym) alledgyng that Moses and Aaron was the hole cause of their last extreme trouble.
            The lyfe is to be seen in the bofe of Kynges, both vnder Eliseus and Esaias the Prophetes. For in the dayes of Iorā sonne of Achab was Samaria beseged by the king of Sy4. Reg. 5. ria. In which Samaria no doute (albeit the Kinge and the most mul titude were wicked) ther was yet som membres of Goddes electe church which wer brought to such extreme famin, that not only thinges of smal price were sold beyond al measure: but also womē agaynst nature were cōpelled to eat their owne children. In this same citie Eliseus the Prophete most commonly was conuersant and dwelt, by whose counsel and commaundement no doute the citie was kepte, for it appeareth the

But whether he was the author of the defendinge the citie, or not, al is one to my purpose, for before the delyueraunce, was the churche in suche extremitie, that the chiefe pastore of that tyme was sought to be killed by suche as shoulde haue defended hym.

            The instrumēte and meane wherwith Christe Iesus vsed to remoue and put awaye ye horrible feare and Anguysshe of his disciples, is his only worde. For so is it written: But by and by Iesus spake vnto them

sayinge: Be of good comforte. It is I. Benot affrayed.
            The natural man (that can not vnderstand the pouer of God) wold haue desyred somme other presente comforte in so greate a daungere: As either to haue had the heauens to haue opened, and to haue shewed vn to them such light in that darknesse, that Christe myght haue bene fully knowen by his own facc: or els yt the wyndes and ragyng waues of the scas soddenly shuld haue ceased: or some other miracle, that had bene subiecte to al their senses, wherby they myght haue perfitly knowen, that, they were delyuered from al daunger. And truly, equall it had bene to Christe. Iesus to haue done any of these (or any worke greatter) as to haue sayd: It is I. Be not affrayed. But willyng to teach vs the dignitie and effectual power of his most holy word he vseth no other in strumēt to pacifie y• great & horrible feare of his disciples but y• same his cōfortable worde & liuely voyce. And this is not dōe only at one tyme, but whan so euer his churche is in such straite perplexite y• nothing appearethNota. but extreame calamytie desolation

& ruyne: then the firste comforte that euer it receyueth is by the meanes of his worde and promise. As in the troubles and temptacions of Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Moses, Dauid and Paule maye appeare.

            In al the iorneyes and temptacions of Iacob, the same is to be espied:Iacob. As when he fledd from his fathersGen. 28. 31. 32. 35. house for feare of his brother Esau, when he returned from Laban: And whan he feared the inhabitauntes of the Region of the Cananites and Pheresites. For the slaughter of the Sichemites committed by his sonnes. He receaneth no other defence, but only Goddes worde & promyse.

And this in Moses and in the afflicMoses. ted church vnder hym is most euidente.Exod. 5. For when Moses him selfe was in such desperacyō, that he was bolde to chyde with God, sayinge. Why hast thou sente me? for syth that tyme that I haue comme to Pharao to speake in thy name, he hath oppressed this people. Neither yet hast thow delyuered thy people.
            This same expostulacion of Moses declareth how sore he was tēpted, yea and what opinion he had conceaued of God, that is: that God was eyther impotente and could not delyuer his people from such a tyrauntes handes, or els, that he was mutable and vniuste of his promyses. And this same and sorer temptacions assaulted the people. For in Anguisshe of herte they both refused God and Moses (as we before haue partely touched) And what mea nes vsed God, to comforte them in that greate extremitie? Dyd he strayght waye soddenly kil Pharao, the great tyraunte? No. Dyd he send them a legion of Aungels te defend and delyuer them? No such thynge.

But he only recyteth and beateth in to their eares his former promises to them, which oftentymes they had before. And yet the rehersal of the same wrought so mightely in the hert of Moses, that not only was bitternes and desperaciō remoued away, but also he was inflamed with such boldnesse, that without feare he wēt agayne to the presence of the kynge, after he had bene threatened and repulsed by hym.

And if we mourne for our denial of christ as he dyd, we shal fynde ye same gra ce & fauour at Christes hāde, that he foūde. But nowe let vs touche the thirde note, which is this.

               yng downe in body, and sore troubled in herte, and yet he cryed: Lorde saue me. Which wordes first declare,Peter knewe the power and good wyll of God that he knewe the power of Christ able to delyuer hym. For folyshnesse it had bene, to haue called for ye helpe of hym, whome he had knowen to be impotent and vnable to helpe.
            The calling for Christes helpe by prayer in this extreame daunger declared also that Peter had some hope through his gracious goodnesse to obtayne delyuerannce. For in extrea me perils impossible it is, that the herte of man can crye for Goddes helpe wythout some hope of hys mercye.
            It is also to be noted, that in his great ieopardye Peter murmureth not agaynst Christe. Neither dothe he impute or laye any cryme or blame vpon Christe, albeit, at his commaundement he had lefte his bote. He sayeth not: why lettest thou me synke, seyng that I haue obeyed thy cōmaundement. Moreouer Peter as ked helpe at Christe alone, of whom he was perswaded bothe could and would helpe at a pynche. He cryed

not vpon Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Samuel, Dauid, neither vpon any other of the Patriarkes, Prophetes, or saintes departed: neither yet vpon his owne felowes in the bote, but vpon Christ, at whose commaundement he had left the bote. All these thynges together consydered, decla re, that Peter in this his extreame feare & daunger had yet some sparke of fayth (albeit in that present ieopar die he neither felte consolacion nor cō forte.) For these premisses are vndoubted tokens that he had faythe. But now to the ende, which is this:
            And immediatly Jesus stretched forth his hande, and caught hym, and sayd vnto hym: O thou of lytle fayth, wherfore dyddest thou dout. And whē they were come into the shyppe, the wynd ceassed. And they that were in the shyppe came and worshipped him, sayng: Of a truth thou arte the sonne of God. And immediatly the shippe was at the lande whyther they went.
            Hereof first is to be noted, thatPsal. 144. God is alwaye nyghe to those thatHowe nygh God is in extreme petill to delyuer hys elect that faythfully call vp on hym. calleth vpon hym faythfully: and so willyng is he to delyuer them, that
