               A proper new balade expreſſyng the fames,
               Concerning a warning to al London dames,
            
            To the tune of the blacke Almaine.
            
               YOu London dawes, whoſe paſſyng fames
               Through out the worlde is ſpread,
               In to the ſkye, aſcendyng hye
               To euery place is fled:
               For thorow each land and place,
               For beauties kyndely grace:
               You are renowmed ouer all,
               You haue the prayſe and euer ſhall.
               What wight on earth that can beholde
               More dearer and fayrer dames then you?
               Therfore to extoll you I may be bolde,
               Your paces and graces ſo gay to vieu.
            
            
               ¶For Vertues lore, and other thinges more
               Of truth you doe excell,
               I may well geſſe, for comelyneſſe
               Of all, you beare the bell:
               As trim in your arraye
               As be the flowres in Maye
               With roſet hew ſo brauely dight
               As twinklyng ſtarres that ſhyneth by night.
               For curteſye in euery parte
               Not many nor any reſemble you can,
               In lady Natures camely arte
               So grauely and brauely to euery man.
            
            
               ¶And oft when you goe, fayre dames on a rowe
               In to the feeldes ſo greene,
               You ſit and vewe the beautifull hewe
               Of flowres that there be ſeene:
               VVhich lady FLORA hath
               So garnyſhed in each path
               VVith all the pleaſures that may be
               (Fayre dames) are there to pleaſure ye
               Tyl Froſt doth come and nip the top,
               And lop them and crop them, not one to be ſeene
               So when that Death doth hap to your lot,
               Conſider and gather what beauty hath beene.
            
            
               ¶For as the flowre, doth change in an houre
               That was ſo fayre to ſee,
               Conſyder and gather (fayre dames) the wether
               May change as well with yee:
               And turne your ioyes as ſoone
               As Froſt the flowres hath doone
               So ſudden Death may change as well
               Your beauties that now doth excell,
               And turne your ſweetes to bitter and ſowre
               When death wt his breath comes ſtealing neare:
               Such haps may hap to come in an howre
               Which euer or neuer you little dyd feare.
            
            
               ¶Wherfore I ſay, fayre dames ſo gay
               That Death is buſyeſt now,
               To catch you hence, where no defence
               May make him once to bow:
               Experience well doth trye
               You ſee it with your eye,
               How quickely ſome are taken hence
               Not youthfull yeares may make defence:
               And ſtrange diſeaſes many are ſeene
               Encreaſyng and preaſyng to vexe vs each day,
               But ſure the lyke hath euer beene
               May houe you and moue you to God to pray.
            
            
               ¶And learne to know, as graſſe doth grow
               And withereth in to haye,
               Remember therfore, kepe vertue in ſtore
               For ſo you ſhall decaye:
               And pitie on the poore
               With ſome parte of your ſtore,
               Loke that your lampes may ready bee
               The dreadfull day approcheth nye:
               When Chriſt ſhall come to iudge our deeds
               No fairenes nor clerenes can helpe you than,
               The corne to ſeperate from the weeds
               Fayre dames, when cometh the day of dome.
            
            
               ¶Now that I haue ſayd, let it be wayed
               It is no ieſtyng toye,
               Not all your treaſure, can you pleaſure
               It is but fadyng ioye:
               Therfore remember mee
               VVhat I haue ſayd to yee,
               And thus the Lorde preſerue the Queene
               Long ſpace with vs to lyue and raigne:
               As we are all bound inceſſantlie
               To deſyre with prayer both night and day,
               God to preſerue her maieſtie
               Amen, let all her good ſubiects ſay.
