            To the right Honorable his singular good Lord, Charles Howard, Erle of Nottingham, Baron of Effingham, Lord high Admirall of England, Ireland, and the Principalitie of Wales: Knight of the most noble order of the Garter, and one of his Maiesties priuie Counsaile, &c.

                  THe learned (right Honorable and my verye good Lord) haue alwaies in their account and register of morall vertues, assigned a certaine prerogatiue of excellency in one more then in an other; not for that they deemed the troupe of vertues (being in thē-selues simply considered) to surmount one another in singularity, al being perfectly good, and mutually combined together, but in respect of some generall benefit and publique commoditie, accrewing & issuing from some one, more then from an other. And in this respect haue they dignified and priuiledged Iustice with this honourable tytle, tearming her: The soueraigne Queene and chiefe Ladye and Mistresse of all vertues, because she not only is a vertue, in each degree perfect with the rest, but also for that (besides her other offices, partes and effects) she is distributiue, ye

            By this art we inioy by participation such commodities as grow in other Regions & haue the same plentifully brought home to our doors by exchāge & entercourse of such wares as we (euen in superfluous measure) possesse within our own countrie: by it we see & learne the cituation, natures, custō

               n al marine exploits stādeth the Prince in special steed. To be short, by it is the Nauy Royal furnished, the Realme fortified, & the cōmon wealth inriched. Is it possible therefore that there can be any so vnnaturall to his countrie, or so iniurious to himselfe, that without blushing face cā say, he is not maintained or at least not greatlye furthered (if not wholye and intirely, yet in great parte and quantitie) by Nauigation? Truely I thinke none. And if any should bee so fond or vndescreet, his absurde opinon would soone be discouered, and the in conueniences or rather mischeefes wherein we should bee so soone enwrapped, would quickly fal vpon vs, if God in his wrath and iustice for our vnthankfulnes should stay the vse therof, wherunto we are moste humbly still to beseech him in mercie to graunt continuance.

From which sort of Ambitious persons, as my owne conscience dooth cleerely exempt mee: so yet neuerthelesse, I feare that shall hardlye scape the hard censures and criticall doome of many Linxes, whose glancing penetrancie and quicke eye sight, being able (as the fable reporteth) to look through a stone wall, will (no doubt) be readie enough to encounter my honest meaning in simplicitie, and bee a great deale forwarder to finde faultes then able to amend faultes.

Which trauaile for thy behooft, furtherance, and safety in thy worthie and moste excellent trade, I was the willinger to enterprise, and (as thou seest) accomplish because of the great commendation, praise & approbation giuen thereunto by diuers skilfull men, expert in those Coastes whereunto this serueth. All which I haue done (Gentle Reader) with intent profit my Countriemen, in whome I wish increase of skill in all profitable artes and Sciences.

Fatham, and so ye may run into Grimple rode, or to the White both if yee please: and if ye goe from the White both to Hull, runne vp alon
                  •
                by the west shore, till yee come against Scutter milles, which is thwart of Paule, and giue it a little birth of the hauen, for there runneth a great tide in the midst of that channell, and there is naughtie anker holde, and there it floweth on your change day, west and by south, and to the westward.
            Also, if you goe from Laurnas to Flamborow head, your coorse lyeth betweene them south south east and north north west, & so take heede of the Smith sand that lyeth thwart of between Burlington and Flamborow head, & if your winde hang westerly that you cannot gat about the head, take heed how you anker in Flamborow rode, for there is foule groūd and your markes that you haue to anker in cleere ground is the Windmill that standeth on the lower parte of Flamborough head, and bring the said Windmill in the midst of the great ditch, and so you shall anker in cleere ground, also your course lyeth betweene the Dagger and Shield, and Flamborow head Northeast and Southeast, also if yee bee bound about Flamborow head, looke that the tide set you not into the Sea, for it is but ill haling of the coast againe, also your course lyeth betweene Flamborow head, and Scarborowe, Northwest and Southeast, and so take heede of Fillibridge that lyeth in the way, and giue a faire birth of the shore. Also your course lyeth betweene Flamborowe head and Huntley Foote, Northwest and Southeast, and take héede of Whitbye Rocke, that lyeth in the fayre way of that course, and come no neere it then the windowes of the Abbey cleere of the lande: and also if yee bee put off with

Whitbie hauen take heede how you goe in, for there stāds vpon the rocks of the S. side of ye hauen a crosse, and so you may goe in and leaue the crosse on the southside of you, and giue it a little birth of you, but your ships breadth, & so you shall goe cleere into the hauen, & there it floweth on your change day southwest to the westward, also your course lyeth between Huntley foote, and Tinmouth hauen, West northwest and east southeast, & if ye go into the hauen take heed of your Beacons, which is 2. little white houses, and the one stands vppon the Cliffe, & the other standeth vpon the sands beneath, and also bring them together one aboue the other, and so shall yee go cleere into the Hauen, also if he be put beside it by night, there is in one of thē a light: also if your winde be scant yt you must turne in, you may be bolde to borrow of the south west side at 2. fatham and a halfe at three quarters floud, & at the northeast side at three fatham, and so it floweth on your change day vpon the Bar Southwest and Northeast, also it floweth on your change day at Newcastle bridge, West southwest, and east northeast, also your course lyeth betwéen Tinmouth and holy Iland, north northwest and south southeast, and so take héed of Cocket Iland ye lyeth in the midway of that course, and if ye be put to anker in Scate roade, take heede, for there is foule ground, also there are markes to tell you to anker in cleere ground, that is the draw bridge of Bāborow in the midst of the Castle ditch, and so you shall haue good ankerholde in cleere ground betwéene holy Iland and it, if ye be boūd into holy Iland hauen, be sure you take your marks with you, which is holy Iland church, shut in the square tower of the Abbey, & so you shall haue vpon the Bar, at a low water two fathams, & so you may be bold to borrow of Bibeile side, & if ye be put out of Scateroade with Barwicke, betwéene the Plow & the Goleston, your course lyeth north northeast and south southwest, and if yee goe to Barwicke hauen, looke out for the crosse that standeth on

the northwest side vpon the rockes, and so ye may goe in on the south side of the Crosse, till you come as high as Twedmouth. Also your course lyeth betwéen ye Ferne Iland and saint Tabs head in Scotland, north and by west and south and by east: also your course lyeth betwéene Scarborough and Saint Tabs head, north northeast and sou: southwest, and so ye shall goe cléere a seaboord of Ferne Iland, and whē yee be past it, you may hale in with Saint Tabs as your winde will serue you, and there it floweth on your change day south and north: so fare you well.
         
         
            ¶ In Commendation of the painfull Sea-men.
            
               WHo so in surging Seas, his season will consume,
               And meanes thereof to make his onely trade to liue:
               That man must surely knowe the shifting Sunne & Moone,
               For trying of his Tides, how they doe take and giue.
            
            
               So must he duely seeke the Eclipticke course of Sunne,
               How he from West to East his proper course doth keepe:
               His labour then (God knowes) as yet is but begunne,
               For he must watch and ward, and shake off sluggish sleepe.
            
            
               And haue a carefull eye, to hand that is at Helme,
               For many one there is, th
                     •
                  t false his course will plye:
               And swelling Seas likewise, the Ship may ouer-whelme,
               Or set her on the shore, without the Pylots eye.
            
            
               
               When Boreas is abroad, and blustring blasts doe blowe,
               In season must he seeke to short in loftye sayle:
               For that, if not in time he very well doth knowe,
               That all too late indeede, no labour will preuayle.
            
            
               But when the raging stormes doe swinge the ship on hye,
               Ofte times (against his will) he spoones before the seas:
               Else in goes all the sayles, and takes her from her trye,
               In haste to driue or hull, till God the same appease.
            
            
               Thus when he all the night, with wearie toyle hath tride,
               And sees the swelling seas hath set him from his way:
               Then when a litle slacke of calme he hath espide,
               With ioyfull heart to take the height he doth assay.
            
            
               His Astrolabie then he setteth for the Sunne,
               Or Crosse-staffe for the starre called the Ballastile:
               
               And thus with help of them and declination,
               How land doth beare of him, he knowes within a while.
            
            
               Then by his Compasse straight he duly sets his course,
               And thus he brings the ship in safetie to her Porte:
               Where of his hazards past he makes a great discourse,
               And each man (by desert) doth giue him good reporte.
            
            
               If Pylots painfull toyle be lifted then alofte,
               For vsing of his Arte according to his kinde:
               What fame is due to them that first this Arte out sought,
               And first instructions gaue to them that were but blinde?

                  Item, the flat end is the southeast end, and the other end is the northwest end, and it lies by the Sea, and it is a high Hill and all ragged aloft. When as you are to the northward, or southwestwards from the Cape Prior, & that you are not farre off from it, then is the Cape verie high all alongst, and seemes on the toppe of it, as though there were many men sitting on a rowe, euerie one a little way from another: and in the Northside of the Cape lyes two sandie Baies one by another, and on the north northeast corner of the Cape lies a rowe of lowe Rockes, and in the middest of the rowe lyes a great Rock, like as it were a stack of Haye. And when you are come within the Cape, then is there lying on the south side of the Cape a sandye Baye, and to the south of the sandye Bay, lyes a lowe flat Hill, which is not halfe so high as the high land that lies within it: and westward from the south end of the flat hil, there lyes two great Rockes hard one by another, and to the southwards of the sandye Baye, lies a point out from the entrie, within which is the Hauen of Faroll.
                  When you will saile into the Hauen of Faroll, you shall beare into the sound of the Groyne, so long till you see the Hauen of Faroll open on your Larboord side, and then you may beare boldely in with it. And when you are in, then before the towne of Farol, you must go no farther, for within is all shold, the hauen lies Northeast in, and it is a good Hauen for Carracts which are bound southwards.
                  He that wil saile into the Groine, shall keepe his course from Cape Prior South and by east towards the Groyne, and if he be without the Cape Prior, then let him kéep nearest to the East side, for the Westerside is all foule ground.

                  Hee that will saile into Hauen of Moores he must first bring the middle of the Mounteluer right ouer a little vally, and when he comes before the Hauen, then let him run in east northeast towards Mounteluer, and when hee is against Mounteluer, hee shall then see another high point lying on the Larboord side of him, & then he shal saile off frō Mounteluer in towards the other point, and then hee shall see the Towne to the Westwards before him, and then let

                  Hee that will goe in to ride vnder the Ilands of Bayon, let him keepe neere to the Iland: for at the northeast point of the Iland, there lies a rocke vnder water, about a cables length from the point, otherwise all is cleare.
                  He that comes out of the sea with the Ilands of Bayon he shal not perceaue any other land but Graye Cliffes, and he that will saile in there comming from the south let him leaue the rocks which are in the southside of the Iland betweene him and the Iland, and so saile in by the middlemoste Iland, wherein the Eremetage stands.

And when you are past the rocke, then may you anker in the middest of the hauen where you will, at fiue, sixe, or seauen fatham, and take heed how you sayle in any further, for feare of the bankes which lye within. And if you will sayle within the bankes, then you must haue good knowledge of the markes of the hauen.
                  He that will sayle into Helford, had need to take a quarthe flood with him, and let him sayle by the east poynt nigh the land at foure fatham, till he see the stéeple on the southside beare south of him; then he may anker against the

stéeple at foure fatham. And by the west poynt lyes a rocke vnder the water, in the west side of the hauen.
                  He that will come to anker in the road of Moushole, he must sayle hard to bywest of a high round hill, and to the northwards of the hilles side, lyes a white ledge of rockes on the shore, and against that is the road, in fiue or at seauen fatham, it is not verie cleane ground.

                  A briefe way to shift the Sunne and Moone by memory.
                  First, ye haue to consider, that although the moone haue prorperly but 29. daies 12. houres and 44. minutes from Coniunction to Coniunction, yet in shifting the Sunne & Moone for knowing the tides, it shall not bee hurtfull to giue her 30. daies iust, onely to auoide fractions, or broken nūbers in the vse therof, for so small is ye error that groweth thereby, that it is not to be accompted in any one tide, to bee any annoyance to the Mariner.
                  
                     Further, you haue to note that ye 32. pointes of the Compasse containe in this vse 24. houres of times, so that euerie point is iust ¼ of an houre. or 45. mi. and euery 24. howers the Sun and Moone depart the one from the other 48. minutes which is iust a point and 3. minutes more. And being 48. houres or two daies old, they are two points and 6. minu apart, and after this manner for euerie day of her age ye must ad to their aper

                     ies olde. And also yee shall note, that from the change to the full she riseth by day and hath her hornes to the eastwards: and from the full to the change hath her hornes to the westwards, so that alwaies her hornes are turned from the Sunne, and also at the ful shee is directly against the Sunne as appeareth by the figure following on the other side.
                  And likewise ye shall note, ye continually at the instant of the ful, the moone riseth at the present time, yt the Sun goeth down in ye 
                     
                        This is to be vnderstood when the moone hath no Latitude, but is iust vnder the Ecliptick line, for otherwise whē the M. hath her greatest N. or So. Latit. she wil differ for the moste parte more then half a point and sometimes an wholepoint & more f

                           rre towards the North or South.
                      opposit or contrary point, & therfore those that hold opinion yt the moon alwaies riseth at the quart. at 12. of the clocke at noone, & at the full at 6. of the clocke at night, they are much deceaued. For if the sunne set at 4. of the clock in winter, he goeth neere the southwest and by west, the moone being then at the ful in Canc. must needs rise at northeast & by east, at the same present houre that the sun setteth. And as many are deceaued in this point, so are there also many mistaken, and oftentimes greatlye anoyed in an other point, & that are those ye vse in going with any bard harbrough, shold, or land, to set the moone by the compasse, to know the time of the

                        •
                     rous practise. For if the moone be in north signes as in Gemini or Cancer, & that he seeke the full sea on the East, or East Southeast, then by setting the Moone by the compasse, to know the ful sea he may misse almost 2. houres of his tide, and thereby come to a great annoyance, and knoweth not how nor by what meanes it chanceth. Therefore let euerie man that shal stand in néed

of this rule, practise ye vse therof by memory, which is more cōmendable then Tables, but if their capacities serue thē not to do it by head, thē I wish them to vse rather such tables as are extant for that purpose, vntill they are otherwise able to doe it by memory. For as the Compasse lying in all places horizontally, is imperfect to shewe the true apertiment of the Sun

                  Now when you haue learned your compasse with the Sun, and against the Sunne perfectly, you shal learne to bring 32 to 24, as heareafter followeth.
                  Heere is mētioned before, your Compasse wherein are 32. pointes, also you haue to euerie point 45. minutes and to your 32: pointes are 24. houres, and to your 24. houres there are 1440. minu. also your, 32, points are not an hower apeece, for they lacke 15. minutes a peece, of an hower. Also you shall take out of your 32, points 8, points, so there resteth behinde 24, pointes, which 24, pointes must bee brought into 24 houres, you haue mentioned heere before your Compasse, wherin are 32 pointes. Also you haue héer mencioned your 24 points, & also your 8 points. Now for to bring your 24 pointes to 24. houres, you haue to euerie one of your 24 pointes, 45. minu. a peece, and so they lacke

15. minutes a peece of an houre. Now for to make the 24. pointes 24. houres you haue 8. points which you did take out of your 32. pointes: also these 8. pointes must be parted into 24. parts to make the 14. points 24. hou. Also you haue to euerie one of your 24. points 45. min. the which 45. min. is three quarters of an houre. Also you haue to euerie one of your 8, pointes 45. min. a peece, & to your eight pointes there is 6. hou. & to your 6. hour. there is 18. score min. these 18. score min. must be parted into 24, partes, and to euerie part 15. min. And when your 18. score min. are parted giue to euerie one of your

So that 8. points, make the 24. pointes 24. houres. and 32. pointes 24. houres. And so giuing to euery 4 pointes 3. houres through your whole compasse, in your 32. pointes 24. houres, and you haue to the 24. houres 1440. minut

                  As 3. is to 4. so is the number of the points giuen to the number of houres contained in them. Therefore multiply the pointes giuen by 3. and deui

                  As for Example.
                  If you would know how many houres 13. points of the Compasse will make, multiply 13. by 3. the Product shall bee 39. which being deuided by 4. the quotient giueth you 9 houres and three quarters.

                  An Example.
                  WHen the Moone is 10. daies old, I desire to know

                      say then 10 daies of her age sheweth her to bee 10. pointes, and three times ten minutes from the sunne and behinde him. Now for seeking of the houre of the full sea, the Moone being at south southeast, you must reckon the Sunne to be 10. pointes, and 30. min. before her to the westwardes, which falleth on the west point, and 30. minutes to the Northwards. And therefore the Sunne being on that point, and 30. minutes to the northwards of the west, I say the full Sea shall be at sixe of the clock and 30 minutes at Callis, and in all other places where a south southeast Moone makes a full sea.

                     6. min. from the Sunne, and before him, the Moone then being at the east & the Sunne must be 12 points & 36. mi. behinde her, which is at northwest & 36. min: to the westwards. So the full sea where it floweth east or west, & the Moone 18. dai

                  Now when you knowe on what point of the Compasse the Gwards are alwaies at midnight, then may yee by it also knowe the houres before or after midnight, alway reconing for euerie point that they shall lacke of the midnight point ¼ of an houre, & for euerie point that you shall finde them to be past the midnight point, likewise ¼ of an houre, as for example.
               
                  Example.
                  
                     THe 15. of Ianuarie the Guardes are at east at midnight, if then you finde them at south east, which is foure pointes short of the east, that sheweth it to bee foure times 1/

                      of an houre before midnight which is nine of

                  If you finde them past the east point, looke how many points they are past, so many times ¼ of an houre is it past midnight, and this is a gene

                     all rule for euerie month in the yeare. If the verie same day of the month be not heere expressed, which you shall then occupie, then take the middest, or the end of the same month that is next vnto the same day, and so the error cannot be great.
                  The houre of the night is also knowne by the Gwards or any other star né

This Hoope being deuided into 4. equal parts, ye sh

reasonable distance frō your eye, ye shal haue the Gwards directly with the pinnes in the Hoope, at such howres as is numbred vnder the pin. But it is necessarie that ye knowe by memorie (as I haue before shewed) what point those starres shall be on at midnight, and thus it serueth for any starre neere the Pole.
