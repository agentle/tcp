               To all her Friends, that they in haſt
               May come with grief, & grone to ſee,

               Let them approach with hatts in hand,
               And with their Teares their faces ſtayne,
               Gnaſhing their teeth, & wayling ſtand.
               Til all be done, let them remayne
               Lamenting ſuch a friends as this,
               That all to ſoone departed is.

               Let them goe next vnto the Corſe,
               That we a fitting tyme may fynde,
               In grave to thruſt them both perforce,
               Whilſt for their Mother there they cry
               With her in grave they both may lye.
