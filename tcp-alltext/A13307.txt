               s, intreating your patient acceptation of this, till a better be made readie: in a pittifull Case of discontentment, that I haue not a better present for your kindnes: wishing your worthines, the comfort of all happines, I rest in the midst of al my Cases, and in what Case soeuer: to my vttermost power.

            To the Reader.
            
               GEntle Reader, I pray God, I do not flatter you, for if you should proue either vnwise, or vnkinde, I should call in my Title: So it is, that hauing nothing to do, I set my selfe on work about a litle better matter, to write downe certain Cases neuer pleaded, but only discoursed vpon, by a couple of idle people; the matters handled, are of no great moment, & therfore scarce worth the reading: but yet, if you peruse them all ouer, no doubt but some of them wil please you: if any of them do otherwise, I am sory, I knowe not your humour: but if you finde your selfe touched with any euil, rather mend the fault in your selfe, then finde fault with me. In brief, I only write vpon Cases, neither kniue Cases, Pinne Cases, nor Candle Cases, but onely a fewe merry pittiful Cases: In which if I haue lost time, I am sory for my labour;

If I haue lost my labour, I am sory for my time; but, if I haue gained your good will, all is not lost: and I thanke you; but, because I know not where to come to you to tell you so, I leaue you to reade and like what you list, and to thinke of me as you haue cause, and so in good will, I rest.
            
               Your friend, F. T.

               You say well: Is it not a pittifull Case, that a mans house that should bée his castle, and his wise his comfort▪ should through the vnquietnesse of her indiscretion, become more terrible to him then a towne of Warre?

Oh is it not a pittifull Case, that man, who should be as a God vnto man, should become such a diuell vnto man?
            
            
               Mill.
               It is true, the diuell at the first crept into the eare of a woman, to deceiue man, and I thinke he hath of late so crept into the heart of man to deceiue one an other, and themselues most of all, that the monstrous minds of these daies doe so deceiue and abuse the simple hearts of honest soules, that we may say it is a pittiful Case, to see what the diuel can doe among men: but let this passe: and let me aske you a question.
            
            
               Dal.
               With all my heart, and as I can I wil kindly answere you: then say this: When a rich man dies, and owes a great deale of mony, to a number of poore men, and women, many of them take his word and haue no writings, he dies and makes his will, giues what he hath, to whom he list, but hath no mind of his debts, though he haue set downe all his debters, and so with a cōscience world wide goes to hel with the diuel: leauing poore men to begge, that cannot come by their mony: when the labourer, the widowe, and the fatherlesse, come weeping to the doore for the paiment of a poore reckening, and with a checke or a 
                     •
                  aunt, either deferred for a litle, or with nothing but a rebuke sent away: while the Executor come out puffing after a banquet, the h

                  re come prouding after new apparell, the sister pricking as towards the hope of a gallant husband, and the guests with curtisies, and I thanke you for my good cheere going home, the poore wretch, with a cold comfort, must walke away with a poore pittance, breaking his hart with the sighes of his soule to see ye misery of his fortune, Is not this a pitiful case?
            
            
               Mill.
               It is a most pittifull Case, but who can helpe it when mens hearts are so shut vp in their purses, that mony comes from them like their heart blood: and with wicked consciences rather die indebted to many, to enrich their posterity, then leaue order for the paiment of their debtes, euen out of their super

               Why a bare▪foote Goose, for she can weare no shoes, but she would leaue them in the water: and a weeping woman when she cryeth for curst heart: and a bearing Asse, for hee is good for nothing els:

               You say well: & yet let the Goose alone to féed with the Gander: but to the woman, I thinke when she weepes she cryes not, and then a kinde heart will pittie her: and to loade an Asse too much may breake his backe: and to cloathe an Ape too richly, is cost ill bestowed: and therefore some way there is, none of these things but are to be pittied.

               Amen. For if there euer was such a Case, it was hellishly handled, that the Lawe could no better determine it, but that a knaue should so be the vndoing of an honest man: but, leauing more to talke of these Cases, is it not a pittifull Case, to see a rich man who in the showe of the world hath bene reputed a man of honesty, and good conscience, vpon the sodaine, either at a banquet, or vpon a bench of Authortiy fall sicke, so be caried home, there lie rauing and crying out of the diuell, haue no mind of God, but onely calling for his keies, looke ouer his bagges, and curse euery one that comes at him, and like a dog, or a diuell, without the thought of Christianity, leauing his wealth to hee knowes not whome, dies like a logge: and so is tumbled into the durt with a number of teares, that he died no sooner: and he no sooner in his graue but his sonne hangs himselfe, his daughters proue all whores, his seruants either begge or filtch for their liuing, for want of other waies, or any thing left them by their wicked maister: and thus vpon a sodaine is the fall of the whole house of wickednes: Is not this a pittifull Case, that the world should be so blinded with the outside of hypocrisie, to take such a Iew for a Christian?

But tel me your opinion, in this Case: If a yong wench that were of a pure complexion, and of good feature, wel thought of for her good behauiour, & with a litle wealth, might be a companion for an honest man, should, by falling into the company of some idle girles, learne to paint her selfe, and to make strange faces▪ with leering eies▪ and mumping chappes, and fleeting smiles, after the whore fashion, to draw fooles to an ill banquet, and so, continuing this ill course. doth spoile her complexion, spill a good face▪ and become of the
