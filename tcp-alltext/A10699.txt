            Wherein is deliuered the certayne maner of execution that was vſed vpon a popiſh Biſhop, and a popiſh Prieſt, that for ſeueral matters of Treaſon were executed at Dublin the firſt of February, now laſt paſt. 1611.
            Strange to be related, credible to be beleeued, and pleaſant to bee peruſed.

            TO THE HYGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE HENRIE, THE Moſt Royall Heyre apparant, to the vnited Kingdomes of great BRITTAYNE, FRANCE, and IRELANDE. &c.
            
               MOſt worthy and renowned PRINCE, I am in hope it ſhall ſeeme no preſumption, to offer this my vnlettered dilligence to the ſight and view of your Highneſſe, the cauſe eſpecially belonging to the ſetting forth of Gods glory, and after a certaine maner, doth very nearely concerne the ſeruice of your royall Father, of whoſe Chriſtian inclination to plant piety, and to releeue innocency, the world hath had long experience. To none more rather thē to your Highneſſe therefore belongeth theſe mine endeuours, whom nature and rare vertues with liberall minde hath adorned with ſingular indowments: and education againe furniſhed with knowledge and exquiſite learning belonging to a Prince. May it now pleaſe your Grace, my ſelfe hauing heere (according to my little skill) ſtood in defence of our religiō againſt the eager aſſaults of peruerſe and malicious papiſtes: Although I muſt confeſſe, with more breuity then the ampleneſſe of the matter, or the neceſſity of the cauſe required: I am therefore moſt humbly to craue pardon of your Highneſſe, for paſſing of thoſe bounds that cuſtome preſcribeth in that caſe: yet if there were no further cauſe to preſſe your Highneſſe, for the Patronage of ſo good a purpoſe this might ſuffice: It is meant for the glory of God, but beſides this inducement, there is yet one other eſpeciall

inforcement to leade me to this on-ſet namely when in that infortunate Country of Irelande, the Popes Vermine (your royall Fathers mortall enemies) haue ſuch ſcope and liberty, that they drawe the people after them, to runne headlong into that extreame perdition, both of body and ſoule, and into that horrible downefall of diſobedience both to God and their Prince.
            Nowe where their reſteth ſo much preſumption in Prieſtes to Impugne the ſworde of gouerment, there muſt be courage in Princes to defend their owne. I will wade no deeper, but in all humble and ſubmiſſiue maner will leaue theſe lines to your Gratious vewe. And thus layinge my handes vnder your Highnes feete will reſt.
            
               Your Graces Souldier euer more deuoted to doe your Highnes ſeruice

            A CATHOLYCKE CONFERENCE BETWEENE SYR TADY MAC. MAREALL A Popiſh Prieſt of VVaterforde, And Patricke Playne, a young ſtudent of Trinitie Colledge by Dublyne, in Irelande.
            
               Tady
               
                  I Am glad Patricke, wee haue ſlipped the reſt of our company, we may now conferre betweene our ſelues, and no man to moleſt vs.
            
            
               Patricke.
               I thanke God Sir Tady, I haue nothing to ſay that I care who doth heare, and therefore in companie or out of companie all is one to me.
            
            
               Ta.
               And I am indifferent too for that, but beecauſe you asked mee whether I had forſaken my ſpirituall function or nay, what was your meaning in that demand?
            
            
               Pa.
               Nothing but this ruffling ſute of apparel, that I ſee on your backe, with your gylt Rapier and Dagger hanging by your ſide, methinkes it is more gentleman-like then prieſt-like, and this makes me to thinke you haue giuen vp your order, and that you are become the ſame in profeſſion, that you make ſhew to be by your attyre.
            
            
               Ta.
               Alas Patricke neceſſitie hath no lawe, it is not my cauſe alone that is driuen to this diſtreſſe, there bee many hundreds in Ireland beſides my ſelfe, that are glad to diſguiſe themſeues from the rygour of thoſe lawes that haue beene lately contryued and pronounced againſt vs:
            
            
               Pa.
               I doe not know what lawes they be that you doe terme to be ſo rigorous, I heare of no lawes that doe exact any blouddy executions or any other tragical tyranies, as burning, maſſacring murthering, torturing, or any other ſuch vnchriſtian-like cruelties:
            
            
               Ta.
               Do you not heare of the Proclamation now lately publiſhed

through the whole Realme of Ireland, that is ſet foorth againſt Catholickes, either to enforce them againſt their conſciences, or to hazard themſelues into vnknowne danger:
            
            
               Pa.
               If your cauſe of complaint proceeded but from that, I ſee you can exclaime vppon light occaſion, and coulde you but call to remembrance the perſecutions, the tortures and torments, that from time to time hath bin proſecuted by poplings, againſt the true profeſſors of the Goſpell, and that you were but handeled, as you handeled them: you had then cauſe indeede to complaine for ſomewhat.
            
            
               Ta.
               And do you thinke our cauſes to be ſo light, when we ſhall be compelled againſt our conſciences?
            
            
               Pa.
               And when your Pope takes vppon him to depoſe Kings, to interdict Realmes, to authorize rebellion, to diſpence with ſubiectes for their obedience to their ſoueraigne, doe you not thinke it high time for Princes to looke about them?
            
            
               Ta.
               And I thinke as high time for vs to looke to our ſelues, but Catholickes I can tell you, are neyther children nor fooles, they will not be eaſely daſht out with a Proclamation.
            
            
               Pa.
               Belike they doe thinke to daſh out the Proclamation in this diſguiſed ſorte to keepe themſelues vnknowne.
            
            
               Ta.
               You need not doubt but that wee meane to ſhift for our ſelues, and not to runne into wilfull danger, ſo long as wee may preuent it.
            
            
               Pa.
               But doe you thinke that this diſguiſing of your ſelues, will ſerue your turne to preuent it?
            
            
               Ta.
               It hath ſerued our turne for fourtie yeares together, & why ſhould it not doe ſo ſtill.
            
            
               Pa.
               Becauſe theſe matters wil be more narrowly looked vnto, and if you remember your ſelfe well, there is an edict in the proclamation that euery Iuſtice of aſſiſe ſhal giue it in charge to the Iury that muſt both make inquiry and preſent it.
            
            
               Ta.
               But from whence will you fetch your Iurates that will preſent againſt Catholickes, you may well fetch them from Geneus, but they will be very hardly found in Ireland.
               
            
            
               Pa.
               Why doe your Iurates of Ireland make ſo litle account of an oath that they will forſweare themſelues?
            
            
               Ta
               What account ſhould they make of an oath that is taken to the preiudice of one Catholick to another, when they haue ſo many

diſpenſations in a readineſſe, and doe know where they may be abſolued for more oathes in one houre, then they be able to ſweare in ſeuen yeares.
            
            
               Pa.
               If diſpenſations be ſo ready as you ſpeake of, how comes it to paſſe, that in euery corporate towne in Ireland, the Mayor and Sheryues hadde ſometimes rather to goe to pryſon then to take the oath of obedience to the King?
            
            
               Ta.
               the Mayor and Sheryues of euery towne corporate, is inioyned for that houre to the ſeruice of the prince, and how can a man more honeſtly expreſſe his zeale to the pope, then flatly to deny his ſeruice to his prince▪ I ſay that Catholicke that will offer himſelfe to priſon in ſuch a caſe (as yearely they doe almoſt in euery towne) is worthy to attaine that eſtimation that he himſelfe doth ſo much deſire?
            
            
               Pa.
               And what is that to be accounted a reble, a traytor, and a falſe hearted villayne to his prince.
            
            
               Ta.
               No ſyr he doth it out of the loue he beareth to the Pope, & therefore amongeſt Catholickes to be beloued, honored, eſteemed, cheriſhed, and to be reputed for a patron, a protector, and a demy ſaint ſo long as he liueth, and after his death to be canonized, numbred and regeſtred in the Popes Calender.
               
            
            
               Pa.
               Why then 
                     •
                  o commit a papiſt to pryſon, is rather a grace then a diſgrace vnto him.
            
            
               Ta.
               I tell you it is a glory vnto him, he doth reioyce in it, hee doth triumph in it, he doth knowe himſelfe to bee renowned by it.
            
            
               Pa.
               But doth your townes-men that bee thus ill affected to their prince, indure anie great penurie during the time of their impryſonment?
            
            
               Ta.
               Now God and our bleſſed Lady defend it, no ſir, they liue in pleaſure, they lie well, they fare well, they are frequented by their friends, and rather then they ſhould liue in lacke, the whole cittie where they dwell will contribute towardes their charges.
            
            
               Pa.
               But is not this a gratious clemencie in a ſoueraigne, that will ſuffer thoſe corporations to houlde or inioy any liberties or priuiledges, that are thus oppoſite to himſelfe and repugnant to his lawes?
            
            
               Ta.
               Speake not of clemency Patricke, where the prieſtes that

ſhoulde ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the people are conſtrayned to liue in a diſguiſed ſort, but not in open ſhow:
            
            
               Pa.
               And by this counterfeit ſhift of diſguiſing themſelues, they march vp and downe the ſtreets of Dublyne, and where they liſt beſides ſeducing the people, without impeachment.
            
            
               Ta.
               And from whence is that but by the mighty power of God that is able to protect his ſeruants although in the Lions denne, and therefore he that hath any wit in his head, will neuer ſeeke to apprehend, trouble or moleſt any Catholicke prieſt.
            
            
               Pa.
               Whereof ſhould we ſtand in feare or doubt?
            
            
               Ta.
               Of more enemies then friendes bee ſure of that. And name mee but any one manne that hath moſt buiſied himſelfe in thoſe matters, that hath gotten eyther gaine or grace: and lette it bee that a Catholicke prieſt bee ſometimes apprehended (as God bee thanked for it, it is ſeldome ſeene in Ireland) doth he not vſe his prieſtly dignitie, in as large and as ample manner as if hee were at libertie, in what pryſon can you ſhutte him vppe, but there he maketh holy water, holy bread, holy falt, holy candell, and for thoſe that haue continuall acceſſe vnto him, aſwell men, women and children, he confirmes them ſtill and reconciles them to the pope.
            
            
               Pa.
               But doe you reconcile ſo many to the Pope when you be in priſon as you ſpeake of?
            
            
               Ta.
               Both in pryſon, and out of priſon we reconcile as many, as will heare or beleeue vs.
            
            
               Pa.
               What to be traytors to the prince?
            
            
               Ta.
               No ſyr but to vow themſelues to the pope, without any intended treaſon to the prince.
            
            
               Pa.
               But this reconciled ſort muſt in the end become traitors to the prince, whether they ment it at the firſt or nay, for when it pleaſeth your holy father to depoſe the prince, and to excommunicate as many as will acknowledge him for a lawfull magiſtrate (as many times he hath done) what ſhall your reconciled ſort do then?
            
            
               Ta.
               If a prince bee a heriticke ſhoulde wee communicate with him?
            
            
               Pa.
               
                  We may then condemne his hereſie, but we muſt pray for his perſon, as the Apoſtle hath taught vs: I exhort you therefore, that

firſt of all ſupplications, prayers and interceſſions be made for Kings, and ſo for all that are in authoritie.
            
            
               Ta.
               That is meete, ſo long as they be good chriſtians.
            
            
               Pa.
               The aduertiſement was written from Paul to Tymothy, and at that time when princes were both infidels and Idolators:
            
            
               Ta.
               I thinke thoſe kings that be pagans, are rather to be prayed for, then thoſe that be heretickes.
            
            
               Pa.
               The church of Chriſt hath prayed for thoſe princes that were heretickes, & that in the middeſt of their impietie and hotteſt tyrany: Conſtantius for one that was an Arian, and yet was prayed for by the decree of a common Counſell.
            
            
               Ta.
               Perhaps they might do this in the beginning of his raigne before his hereſie was diſcouered.
            
            
               Pa.
               Perhaps there are none but papiſts that would appoſe any ſuch doubtes, and what are they but traytors that woulde teach ſubiectes to rebell?
            
            
               Ta.
               It is no treaſon to ſay the Pope may depoſe princes, when he hath receiued that power from Chriſt.
               
            
            
               Pa.
               If you coulde but proue that, we might the better beleeue you in ſome other matters:
            
            
               Ta.
               Hath he not the keyes of the kingdome of heauen?
            
            
               Pa.
               So hath euery other perſon that is a miniſter of the word of God, but what haue they to do with the kingdōes of the earth: our Sauiour beeing demaunded by Pilate what kingdome it was that hee claimed, openly avowed: My kingdome is not of this world but the Pope that takes vppon him but to be his Vicar, woulde diſpoſe of all the kingdomes in the world.
            
            
               Ta.
               May not the ſhepheard reclaime the ſheepe if he will not be ruled?
            
            
               Pa.
               So he may ſell the ſheepe to the Butcher if he bee fat, but what is that to your Pope, woulde you haue him to doe the like by princes! I hope you vnderſtand Syr Tady, that all ſimilitudes be no ſylogiſmes.
            
            
               Ta.
               For all this I cannot thinke it any treaſon to defende that the pope may lawfully depoſe any prince, for tyrany or hereſie.
            
            
               Pa.
               I cannot let you to thinke what you liſt, but I can tell you truly it is treaſon by the lawes of the Realme, to ſubiect eyther the princes ſword or his crowne to the Popes courtes, or in any

ſort to his vſurped power.
            
            
               Ta.
               The time hath beene when Princes might in no wiſe meddle with eccleſiaſticall perſons, and I warrant you the Pope will neuer giue his conſent that any prince of them all ſhoulde haue lawfull authoritie to puniſh a prieſt.
            
            
               Pa.
               God be thanked of a good amendment, Princes are beecome to be more wiſe, and I thinke you haue heard of ſome prety ſtore of your trayterous prieſtes that haue already hopped as far as from Tyber to Tyburne, and there is ſome hope that ſhortly more will follow.
            
            
               Ta.
               I haue hearde of ſome that ſuffered martyrdome, but I know you will ſay they were executed for treaſon, when in truth it was but for the teſtimony of their conſciences.
            
            
               Pa.
               And if it be a matter of conſcience for prieſts and Ieſuites to vndermine a princes eſtate, and to ſtirre vp their ſubiectes to rebell, to goe about to plucke the crowne from their heades and to wreſt the ſcepter out of their handes, then you ſay truth, they ſuffered for their conſciences, but if your prieſtes and Ieſuytes, were ſent from Rome as Pioners to make ready the way for the Popes Bull, that ſhould haue diſinherited the Prince, and giuen his crowne to another, as was apparantly proued and confeſſed by thēſelues, I wonder with what faces papiſtes can excuſe thoſe iuſtly condemned traytors, and to intitle them for martyrs.
            
            
               Ta.
               I cannot tell what was proued againſt them, but I am ſure they were cruelly executed, but what ſhould I neede to ſpeake of matters that were done ſo many yeares paſt, when we haue examples here at home, that be yet bleeding new, of two holy martyrs that were executed at Dublyne, but vpon Candlemas eaue nowe laſt paſt, the one a reuerend and a learned By ſhop, inueſted many yeares ſithens to the Biſhopricke of Downe by the Popes holineſſe, the other a holy Catholicke prieſt, that did both together ſuffer martyrdome in a moſt conſtant manner onely for their conſciences, and for the teſtimonie of the Catholicke faith.
            
            
               Pa.
               Now fye of the diuell, and out vppon popery, is it poſſible that any papiſt ſhould be found ſo fooliſh to bring this matter into queſtion, vnleſſe to ſhame himſelfe, or to make his religion ridiculous? but doe you call him a reuererid and a learned 
                     •
                  yſhop, that was a very blocke, without wit learning or honeſty,

hee ſhewed it in the manner of his life, but neuer more manifeſt then at the houre of his death.
               It is truth, he had his inueſtment by the Pope, for thoſe Balamite Idyotes, be fit inſtruments to ſpread the Popes doctrine, eſpecially in Ireland, where the poore people are ſo infected with this Locuſt vermine of prieſts and fryars, that they will ſooner be leeue an Aſſe that comes from Rome with a Popes Bull, then an Angell of heauen, that ſhoulde bee ſent with the light of Gods word.
               Now for your holy prieſt that accompanied your learned Biſhop, me thinkes our papiſtes of Ireland ſhould make interceſſion to our Lady, that his name might neuer more be hadde in remembrance, that at the time of his death, did ſhewe himſelfe to be the very diſgrace of popery, and an vtter reproch to the religion he profeſſed.
            
            
               Ta.
               Why Patricke although the prieſt did ſhew himſelfe to be in ſome little aſtoniſhment with the terrour of the death hee was to indure, yet he died conſtantly without revolting from his religion, and the Byſhop and hee together indured their martyrdome with patience enough.
            
            
               Pa.
               I wonder with what ſhameles faces papiſts can auow thoſe to be martyrs, and to die for the teſtimony of their conſciences, that were both of them euycted of high treaſon, and no matter of religion inforced againſt them: was not your Byſhop indited of ſixteene ſeuerall articles of treaſon, all of them openly confeſſed by himſelfe, and he condemned by his owne confeſſion?
            
            
               Ta.
               And yet I hope you will not deny, but that all his articles, which you ſay were ſo many treaſons, tended all to the aduancement of the holy church of Rome: which euery honeſt man is bound in conſcience to doe.
            
            
               Pa.
               If all our prieſtes in Ireland that doe teach that doctrine to the poore ſilly people of that country, were drawne hanged & quartered as your Byſhop was, the kings maieſty would be both better beloued, and more dutifully ſerued in Ireland then nowe he is.
            
            
               Ta.
               Then I perceiue you do ſtil thirſt after bloud: is not your inſatiate deſire yet glutted enough, with the death of thoſe two worthy martyrs, eſpecially of that reuerend Biſhop, who was ſo

dearely beloued through all the partes of Ireland, aſwell for his learning as for the ſeueral ſeruices he had performed to the holy church of Rome.
               
            
            
               Pa.
               Sir Tady I proteſt I do thirſt after no mans bloud, neither doe I knowe any one papiſt in Ireland that I would ſeeke his life or wiſh his death, but do rather both pittie him & pray for him, but I wonder you are not aſhamed to intitle thoſe for martyrs, that were openly knowne traytors; And what were thoſe holy ſeruices that you ſay your Biſhop was ſo dearely beloued for, were they not his ſeditious practiſes, that for many yeares together was ſtill ſtirring vppe of the people to armes and rebellion? were not theſe the articles wherewith he was accuſed, the which himſelfe confeſſed, and for the which he was iuſtly condemned? what other wit learning or honeſty was in him, that you ſo much magnifie?
            
            
               Ta.
               I hope you will not deny him to be learned.
            
            
               Pa.
               I will deny him nothing that was his due, his learning was fit to concurre with that authority the Pope had giuen him, that was to ſtirre vp the people to treaſon, and rebellion, for anie other litterature, if ought were in him, it might haue beene begged for a concealment, for he neuer ſhewed it.
            
            
               Ta.
               Why doe you ſlander the dead, he ſhewed himſelfe to be a great ſcholler at the very houre of his death.
            
            
               Pa.
               Good ſir Tady doe me the fauour to tell me wherein.
            
            
               Ta.
               Being ready to mount vp the ladder: when he was preaſed by ſome ſtanders by to ſpeake, did he not itterate, and reitterate Sine me quaſo, Sine me quaſo, ſo diſtinct and plainely, that euery latiniſt might well vnderſtand him: this was a ſigne he was learned, and that he could ſpeake Latine.
            
            
               Pa.
               And here we ſee the end of this great learned Biſhop, that had liue▪ in conſpiracie for many yeares againſt his prince, and being condemned to the gallowes for his treaſon as hee was wel worthy, had nothing to ſay in his owne excuſe but Sine me quaſo.
               
            
            
               Ta.
               What woulde you haue him to ſay in ſuch a caſe, but to giue himſelfe to prayer and contemplation.
            
            
               Pa.
               But what bragges be theſe that are made of his witte and learning, that had liued like a rauening Woolfe, and dyed like a dumbe dogge.
            
            
               
               Ta.
               If there were no better worth in him then your words do import, how came it to paſſe that the multitude of people, both men and women that did follow him to the place of execution, made ſuch doll and lamentation after him, as the heauens them ſelues reſounded the Eccho of their outcries.
            
            
               Pa.
               Before I anſwere your demand, I holde it beſt to make a true relation of the maners and behauiours of the people that ſo followed him to the place of execution, ſtrange and fooliſh I confeſſe to bee rehearſed, but becauſe you haue vrged it, thus it followeth.
               The 28. day of Ianuary now laſt paſt, the Biſhop with his cō
                  panion the prieſt, being brought to an araignment at the Kings bench barre at Dublyne, were there condemned of treaſon, and adiudged to be executed the next ſaturday following, which was the firſt of February being Candlemas eue: which day being come, in the morning ſomething timely, by a Catholicke conſent, a prieſt or two of the Popes broode, were ſent with holy water and other like holy ſtuffe, to ſanctifie and hallow the gallowes where they ſhould be hanged.
               Loe here the pietie that is in popery, I haue many times heard ſpeaking of hallowed bread, of hallowed water, of hallowed aſhes, of hallowed beades, and of ſuch other like hallowed traſh, but I neuer heard of a payre of gallowes that were hallowed before, but theſe gallowes being thus ſanctified, and made holy afore hand, about 2. of the clocke in the afternoone, the traytors were deliuered to the Sheryues of Dublyne that were to ſee execution, who placing them in a ſmall carre, and being aſſiſted with a conuenient guarde, as they paſſed along through the ſtreetes of Dublyne, diuerſe citizens (whereof ſome that were of good ſort and faſhion) as the Biſhop paſſed by, fell downe vppon their knees in the durt and mire, crauing his fatherly bleſſing & benediction, but the poore regardles wretch, ſitting ſtill like a blocke woulde neither vouchſafe them worde, nor ſo much as to turne his head aſide to looke at them, or once to lift vp his eyes to heauen, or to make ſhew eyther of deuotion or of anie religion at all, what was in him, ſo that he might haue bin a Papiſt a Turke or a Iew, for any thing that could haue bin diſcerned by him, either by his wordes or by his ſhowe: And now being come to the

place of execution, it is truth he was followed with troopes of citizens, both men and women, and not of the inferior ſort alone, but of the better, & amongſt the women, of the beſt mens wiues within the cittie of Dublyne: that kept ſuch a ſcriking, ſuch a howling, and ſuch a hallowing, as if Saint Patricke himſelfe had bin going to the gallowes, they could not haue made greater ſignes and ſhowes of griefe and ſorrowe: but when they ſaw him turned from of the gallowes, they raiſed the Who bub, with ſuch a maine cry, as if the rebels had beene approched to robbe and rifell their cittie.
               Now to anſwere to your queſtion, if I ſhould ſay that this deploring of a traytor, with ſuch ſignes and ſhowes of ſorrowe, did argue but little loue to his maieſtie, perhaps I might offende a great number of papiſtes, but this I dare bouldly affirme, that thoſe fooleries, that were vſed both before and after the execution, argued but little wit; and I thinke the recitall of it woulde make the papiſtes themſelues to laugh at the folly of popery, for marke what followed.
               The executioner had no ſooner taken of the Biſhops heade, but that the townes men of Dublyne, began to flocke about him: ſome taking vp the head with pitious aſpect, accompanied with ſobs and ſighes, that of my conſcience were breathed out from their verie ſoule.
               Some kiſſed it with as religious an appetite as euer they kiſſed the Paxe.
               
               Some cut away all the haire from the head, which louſie commoditie, they religiouſly reſerued, for a louſie relique.
               Some others were practiſing to ſteale the heade away, the which beeing eſpyed by the executioner, hee gaue notice of the matter to the Sheryues of Dublyne.
               
               Now when he began to quarter the body, the women thronged about him as faſt, and happy was ſhee that coulde gett but her handkercheife dipped in the bloud of the traytor: And the body being once diſſeuered into foure quarters, they neither left finger nor toe, but they cut them off, and carried them away: And to ſhew their Catholike zeale, they tare his garments into tatters, and ſome others that could get no holy monumentes that appertayned▪ to his perſon, with their kniues they ſhaued

of chippes from the hallowed gallowes: neyther would they ſo much as omitt the halter wherewith he was hanged, but it was gathered vp to be reſerued for holy vſes.
               I might ſpeake heere of the Biſhops breeches that the executioner ſould for fiue ſhillings to a fellow that carrying them into the towne, and tearing them into fitters made as good a market of them amongſt the Catholikes of Dublin, as if they hadd beene pardons newe come from Rome: the poore hangman againe who but laying his cloake a little apart whilſt hee was doing of his office, it was ſtolne away from him, and could not be heard on till within two or three dayes, and then it was knowne to be cut into ſhreadds, and ſo ſold amongſt the Papiſtes for holy reliques at a very deare rate, thinking it had beene ſome veſtment belonging to the Biſhop.
               I am ſorry for my country-men that are ſo blind and blockiſh but ſee what followed: the ſame night after the execution was done, they flocke together afreſh both men and women, with holy water, holy candle: and congregating themſelues at the holy gallowes, in the place of execution, they ſpent the fore part of the night in heatheniſh howling, and performing many popiſh ceremonies, and after midnight, beeing then Candelmas day in the morning, hauing there prieſts in a readines they had Maſſe, and as ſome ſay Maſſe after Maſſe: day light beeing come they departed to their owne houſes, all of them made as holy towardes God, as they had ſhewed themſelues dutifull to the King.
            
            
               Ta.
               You haue made a long diſcourſe to little purpoſe, for ſay you what you can, it will neuer be beleeued amongſt the Catholickes in Ireland, but that theſe men dyed holy Martyrs, & ſuffered for matters that did concerne the Church; now for temporall Magiſtracie to haue foueraigntie in ſpirituall regiment is very vnnaturall, ſay you what you can.
            
            
               Pa
               Who ſhould elſe mayntaine and vpholde godly lawes but the Prince? who ſhould baniſh and diſplace falſe religion together with the ſpreaders and diſperſers of the ſame but the Prince? who ſhould puniſh malefactors againſt God, as heretickes, blaſphemers, Idolaters, and ſuch other like which is to be done in euery Chriſtian common wealth, but the Prince.
            
            
               
               Ta.
               The Prince muſt learne at the prieſtes hand, what is truth, and what is errour, before he ſet in hand to puniſh.
            
            
               Pa.
               But if the prieſt doth preach errour in ſtead of truth, may not the Prince both baniſh the doctrine, and puniſh the teacher?
            
            
               Ta.
               The Pope is the onely decider of thoſe doubts, it is hee that muſt iudge betweene truth and errour.
            
            
               Pa.
               But if the Pope doth finde an errour, and doth command the Prince to puniſh it, may he not then doe it with authority?
            
            
               Ta.
               If the Pope doth commaund, there is no queſtion but the Prince muſt obey.
            
            
               Pa.
               Then Kings and Princes muſt doe more for the Pope, then they may do for Chriſt, but if Princes may not iudge of the truth, what meant Dauid in his ſecond Pſalme to ſay: Bee wiſe yee Kinges, vnderſtand yee Iudges, and ſerue the Lord.
               
            
            
               Ta.
               Well, let be that Princes may commaund, yet I ſay ſtill the Church muſt appoynt them what they muſt commaund.
            
            
               Pa.
               But what doe you meane by the Church, that you ſay muſt thus direct the Prince?
            
            
               Ta.
               What ſhould I meane but the Church, that is the Pope, his Cardinals, Biſhops, Prieſtes, and all other perſons eccleſiaſticall.
            
            
               Pa.
               But what meant Saint Paul Actes. 20. when hee called the Elders of Epheſus, and willed them to feed the Church of God, what meant he by the Church, the prieſts, or the people?
            
            
               Ta.
               Perhaps hee ment them both, aſwell▪ the people as the prieſtes.
            
            
               Pa.
               Canne you finde in any one text of Scripture, where the Church is taken for the prieſtes without the people?
            
            
               Ta.
               But yet the prieſtes are onely called Churchmen.
            
            
               Pa.
               Why now you haue anſwered the matter ſoundly, hereafter when they tell vs that the Church doth conſiſt in the whole congregation of the faithfull, we may then anſwer them, that the prieſtes onely were called churchmen, and therefore they muſt commande Kinges and Princes, what they muſt doe, and what religion they muſt eſtabliſh.
            
            
               Ta.
               It is very true, for who ſhould iudge of religion but the Prieſt.
            
            
               
               Pa.
               Why then the prieſt muſt iudge of truth, but the Prince you ſay may commande for truth, and then we are all this while out of our reckoning, for if it bee in the princes power to command for truth, they will ſay that our gratious king, commaundeth nothing here in Ireland, but what Chriſt hath already commanded, and what is eſtabliſhed by the word of God, and thus we haue brought our hogges to a faire market.
            
            
               Ta.
               But that princes ſhould haue power to compell mens conſciences, I ſay is a thing moſt vnreaſonable.
            
            
               Pa.
               And that euery ignorant and obſtinate perſon ſhoulde make a conſcience of euery popiſh fantazy is a thing moſt intollerable.
            
            
               Ta.
               Doe you terme it to bee fantaſticall that our progenitors, haue profeſſed, and that we our ſelues were baptized in?
            
            
               Pa.
               This is your common inchantment, wherewith you bewitch a number of ſeely ſoules, bearing them beleeue, that in bap tiſme, they haue vowed themſelues to your Romiſh religion: but in whoſe name were you baptized, was itin the popes, or in Peters or in Paules▪
                   if in no other then in the nameof Chriſt alone, then are you made the ſonnes of God, and not the ſlaues and vaſſels of Rome, and as in baptiſme, you receiued no mans marke but his, ſo you ſtand bound to regard no mans voyce but his.
            
            
               Ta.
               Yet I ſay ſtill that it ſtandes with no reaſon, that a prince may forcibly compell any man againſt his conſcience.
            
            
               Pa.
               But I ſay ſtill that a Prince may forcibly compell his ſubiectes from Idolatry and hereſie, to the ſincere ſeruice of God, & the ſcriptures doe furniſh vs with ſundry preſidents tending to that purpoſe, amongſt the reſt take this one: Ioſiah was highly commended for making the people of Ieruſalem, & all that were 
                     •
                  ound in Iſraell to ſerue the Lorde.
            
            
               Ta.
               
                  Ioſiah compelled the people to ſerue the Lorde according to the truth, but doth it therefore follow, that euery prince, may inforce a religion, that is but fitting to his owne will and fancie?
            
            
               Pa.
               It doth therefore followe, and by the circumſtance of the whole chapter, it doth appeare, that euery chriſtian Prince throughout his realmes and dominions, may roote out hereſie, Idolatry, ſuperſtition, and hauing againe reſtabliſhed the true and ſincere worſhip of God, may compell and inforce his ſubiects

both to obey and ſubmit themſelues vnto it.
            
            
               Ta.
               But the religion which we profeſſe, is the true auncient & Apoſtolicke religion, firſt deliuered by Chriſt himſelfe vnto Peter, and by Peter himſelfe to his ſucceſſors the Biſhops of Rome.
               
            
            
               Pa.
               Indeede your Pope in his doctrine, dooth as rightly ſucceede Saint Peter at Rome, as the Turke doth ſucceed Saint Iames at Ieruſalem, and as the Scribes and Phariſes did Moſes, in whoſe chayre they ſate, when they crucified the Sonne of God.
               
            
            
               Ta.
               I hope you make no doubt but that the Pope is Saint Peters ſucceſſor, and that the chayre wheron he now ſitteth at Rome was firſt Saint Peters ſeate.
            
            
               Pa.
               I vnderſtand not what you meane by the Popes chayre, & by Saint Peters ſeate, whether you meane it by any Throne or Tabernacle, or by ſome other Tribunall, or what manner of ſtoole it ſhould be, that you call Saint Peters ſeate.
            
            
               Ta.
               I beleeue you well, for Proteſtants (God knowes) are not onely ignorant, but they are likewiſe blind and ſenfeles in thoſe thinges, that doth appertaine to the miſteryes of the Catholicke Church, but for your better ſatisfaction, and to giue you true weeting of Peters Seate what it is: you that are ſo full of ſcripture cannot be ignorant where Chriſt in the 23. of Mathewe tolde his Diſciples that the Scribes and Phariſes did ſit on Moſes chayre, & willed them therefore (in reſpect of their place) both to heare and beleeue them, being as they were ſucceſſors vnto Moſes▪
                   then the like of Rome where Peter was ſometimes Biſhop, and where he conſtantly preached Chriſt crucified, muſt therefore neceſſarily be the Seate of Peter, and this holy Sea of Rome is it, which Peter hath left to his ſucceſſors, and we may as truly ſay that the Pope doth now ſit on Peters Seate, as Chriſt told his Diſciples, that the Scribes and Phariſes did ſit on Moſes Chayre.
               
            
            
               Pa.
               There haue beene many papiſtes that haue taken great paynes to proue that Peter was Biſhop of Rome, but there was yet neuer any one of them coulde make it ſo apparant, but that wee might deny & that by good authority, that peter was euer at Rome at all: but let it be granted that Peter were at Rome, doth it therefore follow that the Sea of Rome muſt be Peters Seate? Peter preached in many places before hee came to Rome (if euer hee were there at all) as it appeareth in the Actes of the Apoſtles, and by

the teſtimonie of your owne Legende, Peter was a long time at Antioche, and why ſhould not Antioche, or any other place where Peter taught and preached, challenge a ſuperioritie as far foorth as Rome?
               
            
            
               Ta.
               I ſee I muſt render you a reaſon for the matter, will it pleaſe you now to vnderſtand, that beſides Peters being at Rome, Peter likewiſe dyed at Rome, and ſuffered vnder Nero, & therfore the place more holy, and worthy of authoritie.
            
            
               Pa.
               May it pleaſe you now to heare me to render you the like reaſon, our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt was crucified and dyed at Ieruſalem, for the ſinnes of the worlde, and therefore in the worke of our redemption, his power is more

                  ull and ample at the citie of Ieruſalem, then it is in any other place where he hadde formerly taught and preached.
            
            You ſay Proteſtants are blinded, but if papiſteswere not both blind and out of their wits beſides, they would neuer gather ſuch concluſions whereby to vpholde the pride of their pope, that be cauſe Peter was at Rome, therefore the Sea of Rome muſt be Saint Peters ſeate: but how hangeth this together, where Chriſt in the 23. of Mathew, tolde his Diſciples that the Scribes and Phariſes did ſit on Moſes Chayre, what was ment by Moſes chayre in this place? it could not be meant by the citie of Ieraſalem, as the papiſtes would haue Rome to be the Seate of Peter, becauſe (as they ſurmiſe) Peter was at Rome, but Moſes was neuer at Ieruſalem, neither in the Synagogue, neither in the Temple, nor in any part of the country that was neare about it: why then the Chayre of Moſes, which Chriſt here ſpake of, was nothing elſe but the doctrine of Moſes, which hee hadde formerly taught and left vnto them, and which Chriſt in this place willed his Diſciples to heare, and likewiſe to followe what the Scribes and Phariſes ſayd and taught but not to doe as they did, to followe their ſayinges, but not their doinges: euen ſo likewiſe, Peters Seate, Peters Keyes, and Peters doctrine, are all one and the ſelfe ſame thing: but this doctrine of the preaching of the Goſpell, your Pope hath aboliſhed at Rome, and in the place thereof hee hath ſet vp the preaching of his owne lawes, of his owne decrees, and of his owne traditions: and therefore he ſitteth not on the ſeat of Peter,
               
but in the Seate of Antichriſt, in the Chayre of peſtilence, and for Peters comming to Rome, it can doe your Pope no good at all, he may well bragge a little of the matter: but it will not ſerue his turne.
            
               Ta.
               Thus you would conclude that Saint Peters ſeate, conſiſted in nothing more then in the preaching of the Goſpell. And by this you woulde depriue him not onely of his Patrimony, but alſo of his Dignity: Saint Peter is little beholding to Proteſtants, for of him that was called the Prince of the Apoſtles, they would make him to be but Minimus Apoſtolorum, but if to preach the Goſpell, be to ſit in Peters Seate, was it not Peter to whom Chriſt eſpecially recommended the feeding of his flocke? And what is meant by the feeding of the ſheepe, but the preaching of the word, and miniſtring of the ſacraments, which as it was commended to Peter eſpecially, ſo it remaineth a precept for euer to the Popes that are his ſucceſſors? And was it not to Peter againe to whom Chriſt ſayd I haue prayd for thee Peter that thy faith might not fayle? what malitious impietie then in Proteſtantes, to ſpurne againſt that Principality, that Chriſt himſelfe hath confirmed, not onely to Peter himſelfe, but to the reſt that bee his ſucceſſors in the holy ſea of Rome.
            
            
               Pa.
               Firſt for this prioritie that papiſtes would ſo faine aſcribe to Peter aboue the reſt of the Apoſtles, I ſay our Sauiour Chriſt hath long ſithens determined, when in the 10. of Saint Markes Goſpell, hee told them that there ſhoulde bee no precedencie amongſt them, nor the one to bee accounted more worthy then the other, and therefore flatly decreed betweene them that hee that would aſpire to be greateſt, the ſame ſhould be leaſt: now for Saint Peter, eſteeme him as you pleaſe, chooſe how you will account him to be either Maximus or Minimus.
               
               But what blockiſhnes is in papiſts to thinke that becauſe Chriſt commanded Peter to feede his flocke, that this precept therefore was giuen but to Peter himſelfe, as though that commandement to feede the flocke of Chriſt did not belong as farre foorth to all the Apoſtles, as it did to Peter. I will tell you Syr Tady, there is not ſo ſimple a miniſter in the Church of God (that hath cure of ſoules,) but according to his meaſure, is as ſtraightly tyed to the feeding of Chriſtes flocke, as euer was any Pope of Rome: or

as Peter, or as Paul, or as any other of the twelue Apoſtles.
               And now for your Popes, that you ſay are ſucceſſours vnto Peter, if wee ſhoulde looke into the foode, what it is they haue diſtributed, and conſider of the diligence they haue vſed in performing this precept thus left vnto Peter, we ſhould find that in feeding the ſheepe, they haue poyſoned the paſture: they haue infected & corrupted it with the venemous leauen of their owne lawes and traditions, and in ſtead of giuing foode, they haue fleeced the flocke, they haue made a ſhambles of the ſheepe, & haue murthered and maſſacred the innocent lambes: ſuch hauocke your Popes haue kept amongſt the Saintes of God, and yet they would be accounted to be Peters ſucceſſors: but what a counterfeit Hypocrite is your Pope, that vnder a ſhew of humility will profeſſe himſelfe to be Seruus ſeruorum, and yet will take vpon him to controule, and dominere ouer Emperours and Kinges: and becauſe Chriſt hath ſayd, I haue prayd for thee Peter that thy faith ſhoulde not fayle, therefore (ſay the papiſtes) the Pope cannot erre, thus they doe wreſt and wrythe holy ſcriptures, to ſerue their fleſhly appetites, and as for Saint Peters Patrimonie, Saint Peters Seate, Saint Peters Keyes, Saint Peters Power, Saint Peters Authoritie, yea and Saint Peter himſelfe, they are all made props and ſupporters to vphold the Popes pride.
            
            
               Ta.
               Why how now Patricke, what art thou out of thy wittes, wilt thou impugne ſaint Peters authority, or wilt thou denie that he hath abſolute power, both to bind and to looſe, either in heauen or in earth, as Chriſt himſelfe hath giuen and warranted vnto him?
            
            
               Pa.
               I denie him nothing, but that he had full power and authority by the preaching of the Goſpel, both to bind & to looſe, to open and to ſhut, and to doe all thinges in as large and ample maner as eyther Iames, or Iohn, Philip, or Bartholomew, or any other of the Apoſtles, whom our Sauiour himſelfe after his reſurrection, armed with equall authority, when in the 20. of Iohn, he ſent them into the world, to preach to all nations.
            
            
               Ta.
               Thus I perceiue you can be contented that Peter ſhoulde march with the reſt of the Apoſtles in equall ranke, but you will not admit him any ſupreame authority.
            
            
               Pa.
               If you can alleadge but any one place of ſcripture that

doth giue vnto Peter, any more then the reſt, you ſhall finde me apt enough to acknowledge it.

               Is not this confirmation enough, when Peter is the rocke, whereon Chriſt, himſelfe ſaid, he would build his Church?
            
            
               Pa.
               I wonder papiſtes are not aſhamed to vrge that place of ſcripture ſo groſſely, Peter acknowledging Chriſt to be the ſonne of God, our Sauiour anſwered▪ 
                  Vppon thisrocke, I will builde my Church: the Pope would haue the rocke to bee Peter himſelfe, whereon Chriſt promiſed to build his Church: when indeede it was the faith of Peter, confeſſing Chriſt to bee the ſonne of God, for faith is the rocke whereon Christes Church is built: for who is of Christes Church, but he onely that beleeueth Christ to bee the ſonne of God? this faith is it againſt which the gates of Hel cannot preuaile.
               
            
            
               Ta.
               What malicious deſpight is this to depriue Saint Peter of his principalitie: giue him ſome preheminence for ſhame, if it be but becauſe he was the firſt amongſt the Apostles, that confeſſed Christ to be the ſonne of God.
               
            
            
               Pa.
               It is truth, Peter was the firſt amongſt the Apostles, that confeſſed Christ to be the ſonne of God, and ſo he was the firſt againe that denyed his maſter, neither doe wee ſeeke to depryue that bleſſed Apostle of any pryoritie that the word of God doth allowe him, but rather to curtall your Idolatrous Pope, who by magnifiyng of Peter woulde thereby exalt himſelfe, Peters name is vſed but to vpholde his pride: but if you haue no better proofes then theſe to confirme Peters greatneſſe, heare what I can ſay in the negatiue, to proue that Peter was no greater then the reſt of the Apostles.
               
            
            
               Ta.
               I woulde faine ſee that (quoth blind Hewe) for that would ſeeme ſtrange amongſt Catholickes.
               
            
            
               Pa.
               Why then to open the eyes of blind popiſh Catholikes, let them looke firſt into the Actes of the Apostles, Chap. 8. where the Apostles that were at Ieruſalem, vnderſtanding that the Samaritans had receiued the Goſpell of Christ by the preaching of Philip, they immediately ſent both Peter and Iohn, for the better confirmation of the Samaritans: this argueth that Peter had no ſuch iuriſdiction ouer the reſt of the Apoſtles as our papiſtes doe dreame of, for then he could not haue beene ſent, but Peter
                  
and Iohn were ſent, as other priuate perſons, to preach and miniſter to the Samaritans.
               
               And in the eleuenth of the Actes, when Peter hadde beene warned by a viſion to goe to Cornelius, the reſt of the congregation called him to an account, and after a ſort rebuked Peter for entring the houſe of an vncircumciſed perſon, and Peter was driuen in his owne excuſe to recapitulate vnto them the whole maner of the viſion how it appeared vnto him, and was warranted by the ſpirit of God: by this it doth appeare that Peter had no ſuperioritie aboue the reſt, but rather argueth an inferiority, then any place of principalitie: we reade how Paul againe not onely controled Peter about matters of circumciſion, but alſo withſtoode him to his face, in ſuch ſort as he that ſhould reade ouer the ſecond to the Galathians, would thinke that if there were any ſuperioritie amongſt the Apostles, it rather belongeth to Paul then to Peter: but there was no dominering amongſt them, nor one greater then another, but as I haue ſayde beefore, they marched all in one equalitie, both in power and authoritie.
               True it is that Peter did ſtill ſhew himſelfe to be of a more ſtirring and liuely ſpirit then the reſt, and was more apt and readie both in propounding of queſtions, & in anſwering of demandes, which proceeded ſomtimes of ignorāce, as when he demāded of his maſter, whether it might not ſuffice to forgiue his enemie 7. times, thinking that to forgiue eyght had beene too much.
               Sometimes his readineſſe in anſwering was inſpired by the ſpirit of God, as when Christ demanded of his Diſciples, whom they thought him to be, Peter immediately made anſwere, I ſay thou art the ſonne of the liuing God: ſometimes againe ouer much confidence of himſelfe, made him to be ſomewhat too forwarde in his proteſtations, as in the 26. of Mathew, where Christ expoſtulating with his Diſciples, tolde them that this night they ſhoulde all be offended by him, but Peter led partly by zeale, and partly by preſumption anſwered, If all the world be offeded with thee, yet wil not I be offended with thee▪
                   and yet the very ſame night he denyed him to a poore maid: and in the 16. chap. before, when Christ revealed to his Diſciples that he muſt goe vp to Ieruſalem, there to ſuffer many things, Peter raſhly aduiſed him to ſhun the place, & not to goe thether at all.
               By theſe and other like places it doth appeare, that as Peter was

of a more quicke and liuely ſpirite then the reſt of the Apoſtles, ſo he was more foreward then the reſt, eyther to ſpeake or to do any thing as time and place did ſerue, or as he was fitted by occaſion: And as the infirmities not onely of Peter, but alſo of many holy men beſides, are regiſtred in the holy ſcriptures, and left vnto vs for our example, ſo wee doe not cite theſe places of any ſpite or malice whereby to impugne Saint Peters Authoritie, but rather to make knowne the Popes tyrany, that hath a long time iuggled with the ſcriptures, and hath not onely made Saint Peter a couerture to his pompe and pride: but alſo many times abuſeth the name of the liuing God himſelfe, for where hee beginneth with this preamble: In the name of God, then commonly he contriueth ſome ſeruice to the Deuill.
               To winde vpp all therefore I ſay, that if that bleſſed Apoſtle Saint Peter, would arrogate but halfe ſo much to himſelfe as our groſſeheaded papiſtes will attribute to their Pope, hell fire were fitter for him then ſo great glory in the kingdome of heauen.

               Pa.
               And I wonder as faſt in what place of ſcripture you doe finde that Chriſt would haue any ſuch Vicar, or howe the Pope ſhould come to that title, that you ſpeake of, to be the Vicar of Chriſt, but I wonder moſt of all that ſo many fooles will beleeue him but vpon his owne report: hauing neyther ſcrypture, ſcript nor ſcroule to confirme it?

                  theſe: If the Pope be found to neglect the ſaluation of himſelfe, and his brethren, vnprofitable or ſlacke in his office, ſilent in that which is good, hurtfull to himſelfe and to all others: yea, though he lead with him innumerable ſoules by heapes to the deuill of hell, yet let no mortall man find fault with, or reproue him for his doings.

               But to whom was that promiſe made thinke you? was it to the Pope alone or to the whole Church?
            
            
               Ta.
               I thinke the promiſe was made to all, but to the Pope eſpecially, that is the head of the Church.

               Your Ieſuites indeede are ſo famous for their learning,

that they can make themſelues blinde by ſeeing too much, they can ſet the holy ſcriptures at a iarre, and they are as curious in ſearching out the vertue of the wordes, as they be carefull to ſubuert the wordes of the truth: what is it which they can not vtterly ouerthrow with their fiery blaſtes of thundering wordes, by their engins of Definitions, Diſtinctions, Diuiſions, Sylogiſmes, Figures Allegories? then they haue ſo many generals and ſpecials, with ſuch gloſinges and expoundings, that they will preſume to meaſure Gods word and his workes with their logicall Sophiſmes.

himſelfe aforehand to looke ouer his booke, and reading till he came to Abrenuntias Sathanum et omniaopera, at theſe wordes he began to bleſſe himſelfe, and making the ſigne of the Croſſe on his forehead, he called to his aſſiſtance the Clarke that ſtood faſt by, and demanded of him what thoſe wordes might meane, the Clarke that was as ignorant as maſter parſon himſelfe, tould him he vnderſtoode no latine, and therefore coulde not ſatisfie him: whereuppon Syr Thomas was ſtrucke into a great amazement, for he vnderſtoode neuer a worde but Sathanum, and that he was ſure was latine for the deuill: And for the diuelles name to be vſed in the chriſtening of a childe, hee thought was far vnfit for ſo godly an exerciſe; thinking therefore the worde to bee miſtaken, would needes ſeeke out a better to ſupply the place, & ſcraping out Sathanum, he put in Christum: And thus where it ſtood before▪ 
                  wilt thou forſake the diuell and all his workes, Syr Thomas had in this ſort mended the matter, Wilt thou forſake Christ and all his workes: to the which the goſſips in the childes name muſt anſwer Abrenuncio, I forſake them.
               
            
            
               Ta.
               I thought your tale would tend to a good purpoſe, but admit that this were true, yet here was no puritāiſme, the worſt you can make of it, was but a little miſtaking, and that proceeded from a godly zeale, and a religious intent.
            
            
               Pa.
               If you had ioyned ignorance with your zeale, you hadde ſhot ſomething neare the marke, but by this you may perceyue how neceſſarie it is that both prieſt and people ſhould vnderſtād what is reade and taught in the Church.
            
            
               Ta.
               In our prayers we ſpeake to God, and not to men, & there fore I ſee no reaſon, why euery man ſhould looke to vnderſtand what we reade or what we ſay.
            
            
               Pa.
               But it is the people and not God, that needeth the prieſts voyce in the Church prayer.
            
            
               Ta.
               The prieſt is the mouth of the Church, and therefore hee muſt ſpeake for the whole congregation.
            
            
               Pa
               If it be needfull for the prieſt to ſpeake, it is as neceſſary for the people to vnderſtand.
            
            
               Ta.
               It is needfull for the prieſt to ſpeake and to make interceſſion for the people vnto God, but in ſuch a language as is acceptable vnto God.
               
            
            
               
               Pa.
               
                  God with whom there is no reſpect of perſons, hath leſſe reſpect to tongues.
            
            
               Ta.
               The Hebrue Greeke and Latine, were all three ſanctified in our Sauiours Croſſe, and therefore it hath beene long ſithens decreede by the holy Church, that God ſhould be honored and ſerued in one of thoſe three learned languages.
            
            
               Pa.
               But who ſet vppe thoſe learned titles, was it Christ or Pylate?
            
            
               Ta.
               What though they were ſet vp by Pylate, thoſe three languages were onely dedicated to the Croſſe.
            
            
               Pa.
               Then Pilates impietie, that deliuered Christ to bee crucified, proclaiming the ſonne of God for a traytor, and to aſpire the Crowne of Iurie in Hebrue Greeke and Latine, muſt preſcribe a rule to the Church of God againſt the Apoſtle Corin. 14.
            
            
               Ta.
               It is enough to ſay that the Church hath thus decreede, and a good Catholicke, ſhould admit of nothing elſe, nor neuer ſeeke further.
            
            
               Pa.
               You were beſt to ſticke faſt to that ankerholde, for if the authoritie of your Pope be not able to countervaile both Peter and Paul, yea and to waigh vp Chriſt himſelfe, your whole religion is but Idolatry, ſuperſtition and hypocriſie.
            
            
               Ta.
               I tell you for the approbation of our religion, although we had no Scriptures to helpe vs, yet we haue ſuch other circum ſtances, whereby to confirme it, as I hope the proudeſt Proteſtant in all your Colledge, will be aſhamed to make any doubt in the matter.
            
            
               Pa.
               Our Proteſtants in the Colledge would be aſhamed to make doubt of any thing that is apparantly true.
            
            
               Ta.
               But they muſt haue ſcriptures for their confirmation, I am ſure they doe looke for that.
            
            
               Pa.
               If it be for doubts in religion, for matters of faith, or for thinges that doe concerne our ſaluation, they will beleeuc nothing but what is teſtified and to be approued by the Scriptures.
            
            
               Ta.
               Then they ſtand vppon good ſecuritie; and ſo a man may truſt a Dogge with a ſhoulder of mutton: but theſe are vnbeleeuing Apoſtles, that will not acknowledge Chriſt to be riſen, vnleſſe with Thomas Dydimus, they may feele the print of his woundes with their owne fingers: but bleſſing light on them, that haue

not ſeene and yet will beleeue, the Reuelations, that haue bin ſent, the Viſions that haue beene ſeene, and the Myracles that haue bin wrought, to the comfort of Catholickes, and the confirmation of their religion▪ & let all the Diuines that be in your Colledge, that doth ſo much impugne our Catholicke religion, bring foorth but one Myracle that doth make for them, and we will drop ten for one againſt them, for the approuing of ours.
            
            
               Pa.
               Indeed we bring no Myracles whereby to fortifie our religion, but ſuch as were performed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, many hundred yeares ſithens.
            
            
               Ta.
               And they be old ande ouer worne, but we haue them euerie day ſpicke and ſpan newe, Miracles vppon Myracles, one in anothers necke, and thoſe moſt admirable and ſtrange to be reported.
            
            
               Pa.
               And I thinke no leſſe incredible to be beleeued.
            
            
               Ta.
               For the certainety of them there is none will doubt but heretickes: and now if I ſhould ſpeake but of halfe the Myracles that are expreſſed in our Catholicke hyſtories, I might eaſely find matter wherewith to begin, but neuer finde time when to make an ende: I will therefore ouerpaſſe our Golden Legend, a whole volume of Miracles extant in Folio, beſides many other that are contained in one holy booke of Conformities, where mention is made aſwell of birdes as beaſtes, that came flocking together about Saint Francis, to heare him preach, and howe the Nighting gales, and other ſinging birdes, woulde come helpe him to ſing Maſſe▪
                   but theſe are of an old date, I will therefore come to new matter: what Myracles haue beene lately performed by our Lady of Hall, ſet downe by Iustus Lypſius, a moſt learned Ieſuite, who now but within theſe very few yeares, write two learned Bookes full of Catholicke doctrine, in the prayſe of two Images, the one of them called our Lady of Hall, the other by the name of our Lady of Sichem, both of them the Images of our bleſſed Lady the Virgine Mary: the which two Images (as Lypſius affirmeth) haue performed greater myracles, then the ſcriptures do teſtifie were done by Chriſt himſelfe.
               There is mention made of ten ſeuerall perſons that were deliuered in a great extremitie, from the danger of death, but by thinking of our Lady of Hall.
               
               
                  
Seuen others that were already dead, were reſtored agayne to life, being but layed before her Image: now for curing of all maner of diſeaſes, as to make the dumbe to ſpeake, the deafe to heare, the blind to ſee, the lame to goe, they are common things matters of ſmall account, ſhee dooth them with eaſe and great dexterity.
               But amongſt a number of other Myracles, I will deliuer one for the comfort of Falconers.
               
               
                  Lypſius confidently reporteth in this foreſaide booke, that an angry diſpoſed Lord, would haue hanged his Falconer for looſing of his hawke, and when the rope was about his necke, and hee ready to bee executed, hee did but call to his mind our Lady of Hall, and at the very inſtant of his thought, the hawke came flying, and lighted on his ſhoulders: and ſo ſaued his life.
               I thinke I might weary the wiſeſt man in Ireland, if I ſhoulde ſet downe all what Lypſius hath reported of theſe two Ladies.
            
            
               Pa.
               Doth your Lady of Hall vſe to take no money for theſe cures you ſpeake of, doth ſhe all theſe thinges gratis, without any further conſideration?
            
            
               Ta.
               What miſerable wretch would be ſo vngratefull as not to beſtowe an offering of the mother of mercy.
            
            
               Pa.
               Then I ſee it is not out of kinde for Ladies to take offerings, but doe you call your Lady of Hall, the mother of mercy?
            
            
               Ta.
               
                  Patricke be not an enemy to thine owne deſtruction, doe but conſider of this that followeth and vſe thine owne iudgement.
               This booke thus publiſhed by Lypſius of the Myracles that were performed by our Lady of Hall, was contradicted by a Protestant miniſter of the lowe countries▪ whereuppon Clarus Bonarſcius, a famous and a moſt learned Ieſuite, that was abiding in Antiwarpe, but within theſe three or foure yeares, which worthie champion of the Church of Rome, incountered this deprauing Proteſtant, this lowe countrey miniſter, writing a booke agaynſt him, which he intituled. The great Theater of the Ieſuites honour: in which booke amongſt a great deale of other Catholicke matter in a moſt eloquent and learned manner, he inveyeth and bitterly rageth againſt Proteſtants in generall, forbearing to diſgrace neither prince nor peſant that are not deuoted to the Catholicke
                  
Church of Rome, and was not aſhamed to detect and reprooue ſome Proteſtant princes particularly without any reſpect either to their eſtate or dignitie: & hauing thus clarkly rayled and raged againſt them: he ſpendeth a little time to ſpeake of his friend Lip ſius, whom when he had highly extolled for his Catholick zeale in writing of thoſe 2. bookes: he compoſeth an excellent poeme in the honour of our Lady of Hall, the which he dedicateth to her ſelfe and to her young ſonne.
               In this Poeme, amongſt other Catholicke matters he confidently affirmeth, the milke of our Lady to bee equall in compariſon with the bloud of Chriſt, and that our ſinnes are cured aſwell by her milke as by his bloud.
               That God hath diuided his king dome with our Lady, reſeruing iuſtice to himſelfe and yeelding mercy to her.
               That a man may appeale from God to our Lady, and that ſins are ſooner forgiuen by her interceſſion, then by the mediation of Ieſus Christ.
               
            
            
               Pa.
               But is it poſſible (Syr Tady) that any ſuch booke ſhoulde be extant as you report, wherein ſhould bee publiſhed ſo horrible blaſphemy?
            
            
               Ta.
               Are you not aſhamed to vſe any ſuch tearmes, or to aske any ſuch queſtion? I tell you there were two bookes firſt written by Iustus Lypſius wherin he deliuered the Myracles that were performed by our Lady of Hall, and by our Lady of Sichem, and for this booke intituled The great I heater of the Ieſuites honour, written by Bonarſcius, in the defence of Lypſius, it hath beene thrice printed within theſe foure or fiue yeares, now laſt paſt, twice at Antiwarpe, and once at Paris, with alowance and authoritie in both places: and for the better approbation of the matter, one other learned father Poſſiuine a thirde Ieſuite, who in his Apparatus ſacer, hath giuen notice to the world, that Lypſius did publiſh ſuch awo
                     •
                  ke, and giues him ſpeciall commendations for his paynes taking in the Catholicke cauſe▪ who would thinke now that theſe bookes could be thus publiſhed without controlment, but that they are warranted by our holy father himſelfe, and by the whol Church of Rome, for vndoubted truthes.
               But what need I trauell to fetch home myracles from beyond the ſeas, when Ireland it ſelfe doth ſo plentifully afforde them, &

that in euery quarter of the Realme.
               What Myracles are continually wrought at Saint Patrickes purgatory: at the Holy Croſſe at Saint Sondayes well: and doth not all the north of Ireland admire the Myracles that haue bin wrought by Saint Colume Kell?
               
               But let me drawe ſomewhat neare to your Colledge it ſelfe, are you not eye witneſſes howe euery 17. of March, what flocking there is of men women and children, to that ſame holy ſanctified poole, Saynt Patrickes well, I hope you doe not thinke the wholl multitude, that doe ſo yearely frequent the place to bee ſtarke mad, to come running thither ſo thicke, if they did not finde ſomeſanctitie in the water? I warrant you they are not ſo arrant fooles, as a nūber of thoſe that do vſe to take Tabacco, that wil be ſtil ſtuffing thēſelues with ſmoak but vpō a vaine conceit.
               But is not this a miracle eſpecially to be admired, to ſee ſo many women Tauerne keepers, that for conſcience ſake, wil eate no fleſh on Frydaies, that ſome of them do not ride in a Cart on Saturdayes.
            
            
               Pa.
               Syr Tady, if theſe myracles bee any confirmation to your Romiſh religion, I could furniſh your ſtore, with ſuch like, as for the reuerence of the Reader I ſhame, and for the honour of God I feare to ſpeake of.
               But this is a myracle in our eyes, to ſee that the papiſtes ſhould affye themſelues in a religion, that is but propped vp with ſuch ſtuffe as this, & we do aſmuch wōder to ſee their blindnes, that wil be drawne from the truth of Gods word to beleeue ſuch groſſe and palpable follyes, lyes fables, and fantazies of their owne deuiſing but that the Apoſtle hath giuen vs this caueat: And therefore God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould beleeue Lyes, that all they might be damned, which beteeued not the truth, but had pleaſure in vnrighteouſnes. 2. Theſ. 2.
            
            
               Ta.
               Do you calltheſe fables, lyes fantaſies, & I cannot tell what, that are thus fortified and confirmed, vnder theſe authorities?
            
            
               Pa.
               I ſay, we may boldly pronounce your Romiſh religion to bee accurſed, that would bring that bleſſed Virgin in compariſon with God and Ieſus Chriſt, thereby eclipſing the glory of Gods mercy, and the worthines of Chriſtes ſatisfaction.
            
            
               Ta.
               If you fall a curſing of thoſe that doe giue honour to the Queene of heauen her ſelfe, what will you pronounce againſt

thoſe that doe both honour and worſhippe to the Image of our Lady?
               
            
            
               Pa.
               Doe not you thinke that the worſhipping of Images is flat Idolatry?
            
            
               Ta.
               Yes if you meane the worſhipping of the Idoles of the heathen.
            
            
               Pa.
               I meane the Images of the virgin Mary, of Peter, of Paul, or of Chriſt himſelfe.
            
            
               Ta.
               Doe you call the Image of Chriſt an Idoll?
            
            
               Pa.
               If it be worſhipped, it is an Idoll, and the burning of Incenſe vnto it, is flat Idolatry.
            
            
               Ta.
               Dare any damned hereticke auouch this?
            
            
               Pa.
               
                  It is approued by the ſecond commandement, Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen Image, nor the likenes of any thing, that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath.
            
            
               Ta.
               But doth this precept touch the Image of Chriſt, or our bleſſed Lady?
               
            
            
               Pa.
               It toucheth any thing that is made with handes, that is worſhipped, bowed, or kneeled vnto.
            
            
               Ta.
               This can not bee vnderſtoode of the Image of the true God, for if the Images of Princes may be reuerenced, and no Idolatry committed, much more the Image of God.
            
            
               Pa.
               Earthly ſimilitudes of mans owne making, muſt not controle the heauenly preceptes of Gods owne giuing: the Images of Princes, of thoſe meaner perſonages, may well bee tollerated, and yet to bowe the knee, to lift vp the hand, or to doe worſhipp to ſuch an Image, there is no doubt, but it were Idolatry.
               God hath commaunded and that directly that no grauen Image ſhould be made, now if any grauen Image of God might be worſhipped, why might it not bee made, ſince it cannot bee worſhipped before it bee made?
            
            
               Ta.
               O monſtrous abhomination, what an hereſie is this, that the Image of the true God ſhould be accounted for an Idoll.
            
            
               Pa.
               The Image of the true God, being made with handes, is a falſe God, and no likenes of his, but a lewde and a fooliſh imagination of thoſe that would ſo imagine it, for what reſemblance hath a dead ſtocke, or a ſtone, faſhioned like a man, and painted or gilded ouer, to the glorious, inuiſible, and infinite maieſty

of the euer liuing God: and how dare any man defend the worſhipper of ſuch an Image, when God himſelfe hath accurſed the maker.
            
            
               Ta.
               Idolatries be thoſe when they be done to the Images thē
                  ſelues, but our worſhippings are not ſuch, for wee worſhippe not the earthly matter or ſhape, but rather the things that are repreſented by them.
            
            
               Pa.
               So did the Iſraelites, when they ſet vpp the golden Calfe, to teſtifie their thankfullnes for their deliuerance out of Egypt, they erected an Image vnto God their deliuerer, and proclaymed a holy day (not to the Calfe) but to the Lord.
            
            
               Ta.
               May we not giue ſome reuerence to the Image of Chriſt though he be in heauen, aſwell as you do to the Thrones and Letters of Princes, when themſelues be not preſent?
            
            
               Pa.
               What groſſer Idolatry may be committed, if wee may not worſhip the creatures thēſelues, that are the workes of Gods handes: and yet will adore and worſhip thoſe Images and Idols, that are but the workes of mens handes.
            
            
               Ta.

               The wordes of Elyphaze one of Iobs friends who ſpeaketh not of the Saints departed, but wiſheth Iob to conſider, whither any of the godly then liuing did ſo rage and murmure, againſt God as he did.

               But that God will accept of other mens prayers for vs, looke into the 4▪2 of Iob, when his wrath being kindled againſt Elyphaze and his friends, hee would not heare themſelues, but accepted Iobs prayers for them.
            
            
               Pa.
               
                  Elyphaze and his two friends, becauſe they contemned Iob, and preferred their owne ryghteouſnes: God therefore to pull downe their pride, and to giue a teſtimony of Iobs Innocency faith and patience, ſendeth Elyphaze and his felowes to Iob promiſing to accept his prayers for them: but papyſtes are neare driven when they muſt fetch confirmation out of the old teſtament for the Inuocation of Saints when their owne Ieſuites doe confeſſe that before Chriſts aſcention, praying to Saints were not in vſe eſpecially of thoſe that were dead and deſeaſed, which by the opinion of the papiſtes were in Limbo, till Chriſts aſcention:
            
            
               Ta.
               The fathers of the old teſtament did often alledge and appoſe againſt godes wrath the names and merytes of the holy Patryarches remember thy ſeruant Abraham, Iſack and Iacob, for thy ſeruante Dauides ſake refuſe not thine annoynted, and why may we not then ſtand vpon Saints merites.

               But theſe Inuocations thus made, doe not depend vpon the merytes of thoſe holy Patryarches but vppon the couenant and promiſe which God had made vnto them, and to their poſterity: ſo ſayth Moſes, remember Abraham, Iſack, and Iacob, thy ſeruantes to whom thou haſt ſworne by thine owne ſelfe that thou wilt multiply their ſeede, and ſuch other places there be ſundry in the old teſtament.

               That the Saintes are not onely medyators and interceſſors for vs, & that they haue ſometimes a hand in our redemptyon, doth playnely appeare by this prayer that the church of Rome readeth publyquely vppon Saint Thomas Beckets day that was ſometynes Biſhope of Canturbury, which followeth in theſe wordes, Dens, pro ouius Ecleſia &c. O God, for whoſe Church the glorious Biſhop Thomas, was put to death, by the ſwordes of the wicked, grant we beſeech thee, that all that deſire his helpe may atteyne the effect of their petition to ſaluation:
               
               By this it doth appeare, how that gloryous Biſhop Thomas, did ſhed his bloud for the church of God: And that the miſtery might the more playnely appeare, marke yet agayne this ſecond prayer conteined in theſe wordes.
               Tu, per Tho: ſanguinem &c. Thou O Chryst, cauſe vs to come thither where Thomas is euen for the bloud which he ſhed for thy ſake.
               By this it apeareth that this holy Martyr is not only a medyatour but a redeemer, for here we make interceſſiō vnto Christ that by the bloud which Thomas ſhed, wee may come where Thomas is, the wordes are playne.

Theſe and many other that might be named all of them prouing that the inuocation of Saints hath beene both approued and had in vſe in the church of Rome, and I hope you haue heard of our Ladies Pſalter, that was printed at Paris almoſt 100. yeares ſince, where the whole number of the 150 Pſalmes are turned from Dominus to Domina, quite topſie turuie from our Lord to our Lady.

ſhee is not, doe thereby diſhonour God, and doe her no worſhip at all.
               Howe wicked a thing is it then to thinke that the Saintes doe ſometimes plague and puniſhe vs becauſe wee doe them not that ſuperſtitious honour, which is their diſhonour, and not onely our ſhame, but alſo our ſinne.
            
            
               Ta.
               I ſee the repugnancy of our religion to bee ſuch, as there is no hope of reconcilement; for what wee acknowledge to bee holy, that you ſay is prophane, and thoſe rites and ceremonies, which wee doe moſt indeuoure for deuotions ſake, in the exerciſe whereof we do ſeeke our greateſt pietie, thoſe you condemne to bee ſuperſtitious, Idolatrous, and blaſphemous, and that our whole religion is nothing elſe, but ſacriledge, and a diſhonouring of God, I will therefore reaſon no further in theſe matters, that I ſee will not be holpen, but tell mee now in the way of goodfellowſhip, did you euer ſee a prieſt ſay Maſſe?

               The fleſh of Christ is both eaten in the ſpirit, and adored in the ſpirit, yea the very eating of it, is adoring of it, ſith it is not eaten but by beleeuing for hee that beleeueth not eateth not the fleſh of Christ.

               Our intent is to worſhip Chriſt, wee haue no meaning to worſhip the elements, of bread and wine (as you vntruly report) but the bleſſed body of Chriſt, that is conteyned in thoſe accydents of bread and wine.

               But ſpeake truly (Syr Tady) doe you adore the bodie of Chriſt in the miſteries by a ſpirituall vnderſtanding, or doe you adore the myſteries themſelues?
            
            
               Ta.
               Finding him really and corporally in the ſacrament, there we worſhip him, where we find him.

               If your zeale bee ſuch, to worſhip Chriſt in euery place where you find him, why doe you not worſhip the Prieſt when he hath beene at maſſe, or any other man, that is a member of the Church.

               It was pitie that Academe of hereſie, was euer founded, for ſith the erection of that paultry ſchool houſe, the Catholicke religion is diſpiſed, God is diſhonored, and our bleſſed Lady, is out of all requeſt, throughout the whole Realme of Ireland.
               
            
            
               Pa.
               O good Syr Tady be not deceiued, Ladies were neuer in better requeſt then they be at this day in Dublyne.
               
            
            
               Ta.
               You are contemners of the Catholicke religion, & in your not adoring the bleſſed ſacrament you diſhonor God.
            
            
               Pa.
               I wonder from whence you doe fetch your adoration, we haue warrant in the ſcriptures, to take and eate, but not to kneele downe and worſhip.
            
            
               Ta.
               Did not Chriſt ſay this is my body?
            
            
               Pa
               He did ſo, but is that all that you haue to ſay for your worſhipping.
            
            
               Ta.
               Doth not your Colledge teach, that Chriſt is alwayes preſent with vs here on earth?
            
            
               Pa.
               
                  Our Sauiour himſelfe hath ſpoke it: Loe I am alwayes preſent with you, till the end of the world.
            
            
               Ta.
               Thats well yet, that you are conformable to ſome thing.
            
            
               Pa.
               His diuinitie no doubt is alwayes preſent with vs, but in his humanitie, neyther really, locally, nor corporally, as the papiſt doth groſly imagine.
            
            
               
               Ta.
               Are you there againe with your Beares, I ſay if he be preſent with vs, it muſt needes be corporally, and locally compriſed in the formes of bread and wine, in the bleſſed ſacrament.
            
            
               Pa.
               You make your reall and corporall preſence to be a ſhelter for your errours, but that being falſe, as long ſince hath bin proued, what are you then but moſt odible Idolators.
            
            
               Ta.
               I ſay that after the wordes of conſecration are once ſpokē by the prieſt, the eliments of bread and wine are preſently tranſubſtantiated into the bleſſed body of Chriſt really and ſubſtantially, as he was borne of the virgin Mary, and what thinke you now, is not the ſonne of God worthy to be worſhipped?
            
            
               Pa.
               No doubt of it (Syr Tady) but the ſonne of God is worthie of all honor, but doe you thinke him to be there indeed, in theſe formes as you haue ſpoke of?
            
            
               Ta.
               It hath beene ſo receiued amongſt the Catholickes for an vndoubted article for theſe many hundred yeares.
            
            
               Pa.
               I do aske you Syr Tady in the more ceremonious maner, becauſe I haue heard of a madde conceited knight, that was an Eſſex man called by the name of Syr Iohn Raynſforde: who in Queene Maries dayes, being in the company of Edmond Bonner, then Biſhop of London, who ſuſpecting the knight to be aduerſe to their religion, would needs vrge him to make manifeſt to the world, what hee did beleeue of the bleſſed ſacrament of the Altar: thereby to ſhew himſelfe to be an obedient childe truly legitimate to the Catholicke Church.
               The Knight would giue no other anſwer, but that he beleeued as the Biſhop himſelfe beleeued, and prayed the Biſhop to ſpeak truly what he himſelfe did thinke in the matter.
               To whom the Biſhop anſwered, that he ſhamed not to make free confeſſion of his faith, at all times, and in all places: And to ſatisfie your demande (ſayd the Biſhop) my beleife is that in the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, after the prieſt hath ſpoken the wordes of conſecration, there remayneth no more breade nor wine, but the bleſſed body of Ieſus Chriſt, is there really conteined vnder the formes of bread and wine.
               Very well (ſaid the knight) it is an eaſie matter for a man to be leeue all this: but what elſe what elſe, what doe you thinke more of that bleſſed ſacrament? why (quoth) the Biſhop, what ſhould

I thinke more then I haue already ſayd: I thinke that after the words of conſecration being ſpoken by the prieſt, that there remaineth the bleſſed body of Ieſus Christ, fleſh bloud and bone, as he was borne of the virgin Mary.
               
               The Knight began in a ceremonious manner to proteſt how his beleife was, that after the prieſt had ſpoken the words of conſecration: Hoc est Corpus meum, that vnder the formes of bread and wine, Christ was there remaining, in a ſuite of Ruſſet Satine, a velvit Cap, and a feather on his heade: a Spaniſhe Coape on his backe, a payre of ſilke ſtockinges, and a gylt Rapyer & Dagger by his ſide.
               How thinke you now Syr Tady, by the knights opinion, I promiſe you for my parte, I beleeue the Biſhop and him both alike.
            
            
               Ta.
               Haue I all this while liſtened for ſuch a concluſion: but tel me Patricke what became of that knight, was he not burned for his hereſie.
            
            
               Pa.
               It is more hereſie for a man to beleeue that Christ is in the ſacrament gentleman-like, then for our maſſing prieſtes of Ireland, to ſute themſelues in that generous manner euery day when they liſt?
            
            
               Ta.
               Well Patricke I doe ſee you are ſo blinded with preſumption and rebellion againſt the Catholicke Church, that you will beleeue nothing, but what is pleaſing to your owne fantaſie.
            
            
               Pa.
               Nay, what an abſurditie is in you to thinke that Christ is eaten and deuoured by the wicked: Christ entereth the ſoule, but not the mouth of man: Eate you, this is my body, Drinke you, this is my bloud: theſe ſpeeches cannot be religious, except they bee figuratiue, for this groſſe conceipt of a carnall eating, was it that offended the Caperniates in the ſixt of Iohn.
               
               
                  Yet that great fauourer of Popery of England Syr Thomas Moore that Bellarmine ſo much extolles for his wit and learning, doth litterally preſſe thoſe wordes of Chriſt againſt Iohn Fryth in this manner following: The very circumstance of the place in the Goſpell in which our Sauiour ſpeaketh of that ſacrament, may well make open the difference of his ſpeeches in this matter and of all the other: and that as he ſpake all thoſe but in an Allegory, ſo ſpake hee this playnely, meaning that he ſpake of his very body and his very bloud, beſides all Allegories: For when our Lord ſayde he was a very Vine, and when he ſayd he

was a doore, there was none that hearde him, that any thing marueyled thereat: And why, for becauſe they perceiued wel that he ment not that he was a materiall Vine or doore indeed, but when he ſayde that his fleſh was very meate, and his bloud very drinke, and that they ſhoulde not be ſaued, but if they did eate his fleſh, and drinke his bloud, then were they all in ſuch a wonder thereof, that they could not abide. And wherefore, but becauſe they perceiued well by his words, and his manner of circumstances, that Chriſt ſpake of his very fleſh and his very bloud.
               Nowe if maiſter Mores opinion be true, that the Capernaites, lighted on the ſame manner of eating that Chriſt propoſed vnto them, then they deſerued rather prayſe then blame: but they miſtooke the wordes of Chriſt, who went about to teach them the ſpirituall eating of his fleſh, and drinking of his bloud, for ſo doth he himſelfe expound his owne words afterwards to his Diſciples, teaching them how they ſhould be both faithful partakers of his fleſh, and rightfull interpreters of his ſpeeches: And as many fathers as haue written of that place, haue ſo vnderſtood it, the which our Ieſuites knowing well enough, and are driuen to confeſſe that thoſe wordes were ſpiritually meant, they are therefore inforced to flie from that place which Moore ſo cōfidently auoweth for that carnall eating and drinking, and will in no wiſe admit thoſe wordes in the 6. of Iohn to appertaine to any thing that was ſpoken by Chriſt at his laſt ſupper, but doe only ſtick as cloſe to their Hoc est corpus meum, as the Cuckoe to her ſonge.
               
                  Pope Innocent, vnderſtanding that place of the ſixt of Iohn, as that great clarke ſpoken of before Moore had done: cauſed yong children and infants to receiue the ſacrament; And of this carnall minde were many other Biſhops a long time, yet afterwards looking more ſpiritually vppon the matter, they confeſſed their errour.
               
                  Saint Auguſtine, giuing a certaine rule how wee ſhould knowe the tropes, figures, allegories, and phraſes of the ſcriptures, putteth this place of the 6. of Iohn, out of all doubt and queſtion: his wordes be theſe: When ſoeuer the Scripture, or Chriſt ſeemeth to commaund any foule or wicked thing, then muſt that text be taken figuratiuely: that is as it is a phraſe, allegory, and maner of ſpeaking, and muſt be vnderſtood ſpiritually, and not after the letter. Except (ſayth Christ) you eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his blood, yee

ſhall haue no life in you: hee ſeemeth (ſayth Saint Auguſtine) to commaund a foule and wicked thing, it is therefore a figure, commaunding vs to be partakers of his paſſion, and ſweetely and profitably, to print in our mind, that his fleſh was crucified, and wounded for vs.
            
            
               Ta.
               But tell me Patricke, bee theſe Saint Auguſtins owne wordes that you haue thus repeated?
            
            
               Pa.
               You ſhall finde them in his third booke De doctrina Chriſtiana: Cap. 16.
            
            
               Ta.
               In deſpite of all you can alledge out of Auguſtine, Ambroſe, Peter, Paul, or Chriſt himſelfe, I will beleeue nothing, but what the holy Catholike church of Rome doth teach and ratifie.
            
            
               Pa.
               Hold you ſtill there Syr Tady, for that is the iuſt rewarde of errour, to bee euery day more peruerſe, more obſtinate, and more malitious, toward the truth then other.
            
            
               Ta.
               Do you denie that the body of Chriſt is not really conteyned in the bleſſed ſacrament?
            
            
               Pa.
               Flatly.
            
            
               Ta.
               O dangerous impiety, O impious blaſphemie, O moſt deteſtable and damnable hereſie.
            
            
               Pa.
               O now I ſee your chiding vaine is come vpon you ſir Tady.
               
            
            
               Ta.
               Is it poſſible for a Catholicke prieſt to be patient, when euery ſchoole boy, will be inueying & itterating of matter againſt the faith of the Catholike church?
            
            
               Pa.
               For your better ſatisfaction Syr Tady, that the fleſhe of Chriſt is ſpiritually eaten by faith and beleife: what better proofe then the Patriarkes and Prophets of the old law, who before the incarnation of Chriſt, did eate his fleſhe, and drinke his bloode, but in beleeuing the promiſe that Chriſt ſhould come, as wee doe now in beleeuing that he is come.
            
            
               Ta.
               But they that doe beleeue that the body and bloode of Chriſt is in the ſacrament indeede, haue the plaine words of our Sauiour himſelfe, for the ground and foundation of their faith.
            
            
               Pa.
               So haue they the very wordes of God: which ſay that a broken potſhard is Ieruſalem.
            
            
               Ta.
               The Ieſuites (you ſay) in the 6. of Iohn, do acknowledge and confeſſe a ſpirituall vnderſtanding, but in the deliuering of the ſacrament, wee be ſure hee ſpake of a corporall, and not of a ſpirituall eating of his body, for when our Lord ſayd, Take eate
                  
                  this is my body, did hee not meane they ſhould take it with their hands, and eate it with their mouthes, and therefore eyther the one place doth but ſerue to expounde the other, or elſe in both places is preſcribed a reall and a corporall eating of the fleſhe of Chriſt.
            
            
               Pa.
               In thoſe wordes Take eate, ſpoke at the laſt ſupper, no doubt, hee ment the corporall eating of that creature which he then gaue them. And when he added, This is my body: he recalled to their mindes the doctryne he had formerly taught them of eatyng of the fleſh & drinkinge of his bloud, in which becauſe they were inſtructed by the Capernaits errour, & their mayſters declaration of himſelfe: That the wordes that he had ſpoke were ſpirit and life, they neither ſtarted nor wondered at the matter, becauſe they knewe his ſpeaches to be allegorycall:
            
            
               Ta.
               
                  But with what confidence is it avowed by our ſauiour when he ſayde, Verily verily I ſay vnto you, Except yee eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you haue no life in you:
            
            
               Pa.
               And with what vehemency in the very ſame place doth he affirme when he ſayth, verily verily I ſay vnto you, hee that beleeueth in me hath euerlaſting life: thus you ſee, he that beleueth onely eateth the fleſh and drinketh the bloude of Chriſt, for if eating and drinking in this place, were referred to the mouth and teeth, Iudas, or any other infidell that were partakers at the Lordes Table, could not periſh: or els it muſt follow, that to beleeue in Chriſt were better then Chriſt himſelfe, which were a great abſurdity, for any man to thinke: And Chriſt himſelfe hath ſayd, he that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my bloud dwelleth in me & I in him: now we knowe that ſometimes the wicked do eate the ſacrament and yet they neither dwell in Chriſt, nor Christ in them.
            
            
               Ta.
               Well Patryck, I muſt not giue you ouer thus, I haue yet ſome other nuttes for you to crack before I leaue you.
            
            
               Pa.
               Lets ſee what maner of nuttes they be, you ſhall ſee I will make a ſhift to cracke them, and if they be oughts worth, I may happ to keepe the kernels to my ſelfe, & leaue the ſhelles to you.
            
            
               Ta.
               To proue the reall preſence in the ſacrament, I will avouch thoſe writers, that all the Proteſtants in Ireland, are not able to contradict.
            
            
               Pa.
               Out with them in Gods name, letvs heare what they be
            
            
               
               Ta.
               I will firſt begin with that great and learned Clarke Durandus, who did confidently affirme, that Chriſt is preſent in the ſacrament to the mouth and teeth of the receiuer, but hee conſenteth with Hugo That we must ſeeke no longer for a corporal preſence then whilst wee are achamming of him in our mouth.
               
               So long as he doth remaine, In viſu, & ſapore, ſo long we haue him, but theſe two will in no wiſe permit, that hee ſhould be ſwallowed in the ſtomacke: but this is enough, they both of them ac, knowledge a reall preſence to the mouth and teeth: but nowe comes Bonauenture, & he affirmeth flatly, that he is no leſſe preſent in the ſtomacke, then he is in the mouth: marry whether he goes downe to the belly or noe, he ſtands in doubt, becauſe of the diuerſitie of opinions that are holden: and yet he liketh not, That the body of Christ ſhould go into the belly of a mouſe, or be caſt forth by the drought. And heere hee ſheweth a Catholicke reaſon why: Becauſe the eares of well diſpoſed perſons would abhorre that: and heretickes, and Infidels would iest at it, and laugh vs to ſcorne that would defend it: But Alexander de Hales, in deſpight of heretickes and infidels both, doth confidently affirme that: if a dogg or a hogg ſhould eate the wholl conſecrated Host, is no cauſe (ſayth he) but the Lordes body ſhould goe there withall into the belly of that dogg or hogg.
               
               
                  But now amongſt the reſt bleſſed Thomas Aquinas that holy Saint, doth ſharpely reproue thoſe that thinke contrary: Some haue ſayd (ſayth he) that as ſoone as the ſacrament is taken of a mouſe, or a dog, straight way the body & blood of Christ doth ceaſe to be there, but this is a derogation to the truth of this Sacrament.
            
            
               Pa.
               But tell mee truth Syr Tady haue you not wronged thoſe Authors, that you haue heere named, haue you cited their words no other wiſe then they themſelues haue ſet them downe?
            
            
               Ta.
               Now God and our bleſſed Lady defend that I ſhoulde ſo iniurie them, it were a ſhame for mee to belie them, their owne workes are extant and to bee ſeene, and there are a huge ſwarme of others, a wholl ſect of Thomistes that doe vphold all theſe poſitions, enough to make all the proteſtants that be in Ireland to bluſh, but that they are paſt ſhame.
               But amongſt the reſt, and for the better credit to the cauſe: Antonius, Arch-Biſhop of Florence, and Petrus de ṗludo, ioyned both together affirming that the body of Chriſt, may not onely bee

eaten of a mouſe, but alſo it may be vomited vp by the mouth, and purged downe to the draught, theſe bee their owne wordes.
               Therefore the body and bloud of Christ remayne in the belly, or stomacke, or vomit, or in whatſoeuer courſe of nature: ſo long as the ſhews of bread and wine remaine, & if they be vomitted, or purged before they be altered (as ſometimes with thoſe that are troubled with the flux) euen there is the body of Chriſt.
            
            
               Pa.
               O peace Syr Tady no more for the ſhame of your ſelfe, & of all the papiſtes in the worlde, bee theſe the nuttes you haue to cracke? O loathſome ſtuffe vnfitte to be ſpoken of: mine cares doe glow to heare theſe groſſe and barbarous repetitions: is this the reall preſence that you ſo much ſtriue for? are theſe the learned authorities, which you ſo highly extoll, call you theſe Saintes that doe teach ſuch filthy and loathſome diuinitie? no maruel though you account traytors for martyrs when your Pope hath ſuch cunning to make Saints of blaſphemers.
            
            
               Ta.
               I tell thee true, that ſome of theſe that I haue named are Saints Canonized by the Church of Rome, and for the diuinitie they haue taught and ſpread, if it were not ſound, religious and holy, doe you thinke it could paſſe as it doth, ratified confirmed and approued by the mother Church, ſo many yeares vncorrected or vncontrould?
               But I cannot blame ye though you bluſh, you may well bee aſhamed to ſee our holy Maſſe, that ſo many heretickes doe ſeeke to impugne, howe it is eſtabliſhed vpholden and fortified, by no meane nor ſimple authoritie I warrant yee.
            
            
               Pa.
               I ſee indeed that thoſe that haue no regard of their cōſciēces before God, haue leſſe care of their credites before men, but it is time to giue ouer reaſoning with papiſtes, when they ſeeke out ſuch nuttes as theſe be for proteſtants to cracke, and ſome other buſines calling me away, I will therefore leaue you.
            
            
               Ta.
               Well Patricke then for a parting blowe, let me aduiſe thee yet a little for thine owne good, be not obſtinate, but be ruld by me it ſhall be for thy benefit.
