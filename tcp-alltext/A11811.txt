of repentaunce and amendment
of life, togeather with the accompt
which we muſt render at the
day of iudgement. Preached at the Rolles Church in London

the fifth Chapter of Saint Paule

               We muſt all appeare before the iudgement
ſeat of Chriſte, that euery man
maye receiue the thinges, which are
done in his bodye, according to that
which he hath done, whether it bee
good or euill.

            A Sermon preached at

            The Text.
            
               2. Cor. 5.We muſt all appeare before the iudgement
ſeat of Chriſte, that euery man
maye receiue the thinges, which are
done in his bodye, according to that
which he hath done, whether it bee

               THe holye Apoſtle, at ſuch
time as he wrote this Epiſtle
to the Corinthians,
beeing perſecuted for the
teſtimonye of his conſcience,
and the profeſſion of the glorious
Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſte, proteſteth ſolempnely,
that the troubles, which bee
ſuffered in his bodye did not onelye not
diſcourage him, nor cauſe him to faint,

but eyther That they did adde zealo and

                     〈…〉
                  ,
               2. Cor. 4. 9. cauſing him to continue
conſtaune in his calling, and to account
thoſe afflitions but tuomentary & light
in reſpect of that moſt excellent and eternall
weight of glorye, wherewith all in
the end he knew he ſhoulde be crowned,
the earneſt deſire whereof cauſed him to
ſigh and grone in ſpirite, that he might
ſhortly be loſed out of his body, and cloathed
with his houſe, which the Lord had
prepared for him in heauen, not that be
thought hee coulde preuent the time,
which the Lord in his ſecret counſel had
already determined. For he knew that
the Dayes of man ſurely are determined,
               Iob. 14. 5.
               and that his number of monethes are
knowne of God, who hath appoynted
him his boundes,
               2. Cor: 5. 1. 6. 8. & 9. 
               which can not goe
beyonde, but we know (ſayth he) that
if our earthly houſe of that tabernacle
bee deſtroyed, wee haue a buildinge
giuen of GOD, that is, a houſe not
made with handes, but eternall in the
heauens, beeing abſent from the Lord,
whileſte we are at hoame in this body.
Howbeit whether it be the Lord his

good wil and pleaſure, that we ſhall ſtil
dwell at home in the bodye, or remooue
from home out of this bodye and dwell
wich him, we endeuour our ſelues,
that we may be found acceptable in his
ſight at all times, and in all places.
Whereof he giueth this reaſon, For we
muſt all appeare, &c. Exhorting al men
both by his example and doctrine, in
life to meditate of death, in proſperitie
to feare aduerſitie, in the day of mercye
to thinke of the daye of iudgement, and
ſo to liue in their ſeuerall callinges, as
to remember they muſt giue account of
their callinges, ſo to vſe the benefites
and bleſſinges of God, as not forgetting
from whence they haue them, and
when they muſte reſigne them, according
to that counſell of the wiſe man,
Remember thy ende,
               Eccle. 7. 3
                     •
                  . That is, the certaintie
of thy ende, the vncertain howre
of thy ende, the rewarde thou ſhalt receaue
at thy ende, the place of ioye or
payne, that thou muſt goe to at thy end,
In all thy doinges remember theſe
thinges, and tho
                     ••••
                   ſhal
                     •
                   neuer doe amiſſe.
            
            
               
For what cauſeth ſuch loſenes of life in
all ſortes, but the forgetfulnes of death
in all ſortes? What cauſeth the wicked
alwayes to preſume of God his mercye,
but the contempt of his iuſtice? What
cauſeth ſuch generall ſecurity in ſinne,
but the generall obliuion of the reward
of ſinne? Whereas if we did alwayes
remember our particular endes and our
generall iudgements, it would cauſe vs
to walke more circumſpectly in our callinges,
which more care of conſcience, and
greater conſideration of all our actions,
which one day muſt be brought to iudgment.
To this ende doth the Apoſtle
preach of the daye of iudgement in this
place, putting vs in remembraunce of
three thinges neceſſary to be thought of,
and conſidered of all men before that
tyme.
            1 Firſt, who and what they are whiche
muſt appeare at that day.
            2 Secondarily, where and before whom
they muſt appeare.
            3 Thirdly, to what ende they muſt appeare.
            If you aſke who they are which muſt

appeare at that daye, the Apoſtle ſaithe
All.
            
            If you aſke where and before whome
thoſe All muſt appeare, the Apoſtle aunſwereth,
Before the iudgement ſeate of
Chriſt.
            
            
               If you aſke to what ende, thoſe All muſt
appeare before the iudgement ſeate of
Chriſt, the Apoſtle doth aunſwere, To receaue
euery man according to that which
he hath done in his body, whether it, &c.
            
               The firſt part.
               
                  TOuching the ſubſtaunce of
that doctrine, which here is
deliuered by the Apoſtle, it
was propheſied long ſince
by S. Peter, that towards
the letter end of the world, this doctrine
of the generall iudgement and reſurrection
of all fleſh ſhould of all other to the
opinions of the wicked ſeeme moſt abſurd,
ridiculous and fooliſh.2. Peter. 3. 3. 
                  There ſhall
come in the laſt dayes mockers
                  Iud. 18. (ſaith he)1. Tim. 4. 1.
                  which will walke after their luſtes,
                  2 Tim. 3. 1. 
                  and
ſaye,
                  2. Peter. 2. 1. 
                  where is the promiſe of his comming?
For ſince the Fathers dayed, all

thinges continue a like from the beginning
of the creation. He termeth the deſpiſers
and contemners of this doctrine
mockers, he ſaith, the dais they ſhal liue
in ſhalbe the laſt: the manner, how they
ſhall mocke it, will appeare both in their
liues and ſpeeches, in their liues for that
they ſhall not walke after the lawes of
God, but after the lawes of their fleſhe,
fulfilling the luſtes therof, as prophane
and rechles perſons void of al godlines,
and giuen ouer to all ſinne and iuniquirye.
In ſpeeches not aſhamed to profes,
that they beleue nothing leſſe, then that,
that ſhould be performed, which is promiſed
in the ſcriptures concerning the
comming of Chriſt in iudgement. The
reaſon, that moue them to thinke and ſay
ſo, is the obſeruation of nature his conſtant
courſe in all the workes and creatures
of God continuing in ye ſame ſtate,
wherein they were firſt created withoute
any alteration or chaunge in any
of them, as thoſe great lights, the ſunne
and the Moone obſeruing their vſuall
and ordinarye time of their vpriſing and
downe ſitting,Gene. 1. 16. according to the ſeuerall

ſeales and tymes of the yeare, the one
ruling and giuing light to the daye,Gen. 1. 18. the
other in the night, the ſtarrs remaining
firme and fixed as lightes in the firmament
of heauen, where they were firſte
planted in the beginning to diuide ye day
and the night, and to bee as ſignes and
ſeaſons for daies and yeares: the earth
being vnremooueable vnder our feete,
bringing forth budde and greene hearbe
apt to ſeede, and fruitfull trees, euerye
one yeilding fruites after his kinde, and
all theſe together with the beaſts of the
field, foules of the ayre, and fiſhes of the
ſea to be ſubiect to man, who likewiſe
according to Gods firſte ordinaunce is
borne at his appointed time, and at his
appointed time alſo returneth againe to
duſte, from whence he came, and ſo obſeruing
all the workes of God to holde on
that courſe of nature at this daye without
any change, which he gaue to euery
one of them in their kind & at their firſt
creation many yeares ſince, thereupon
they promiſe and preſume of an eternall
perpetuitie in all thinges, concluding
with the Precher, Mundus durauit hactenus,

ergo finem non habebit, The wor
                     •
                  
hath endured hitherto, ergo it ſhall haue
no ende, and thus (as much as in them
lyeth) both in the examples of their
liues, and wordes of their lippes diſcredyting,
nay deriding the promiſe of the
comming of Chriſte, and mocking the
threatninges of God his iudgementes.
Such mockers in theſe dayes of ours,Mockers.
which the Apoſtle termeth the laſt, are
manye.Pſal. 14. 1. One ſort of them ſaye in their
heartes, there is no God. In which number
the moſte and greateſt part of vs (I
feare me) may be comprehended, we are
not ſo impudent to ſay with our tonges,
there is no God, but loke into our liues,
our offices and functions, marke how
euery man walketh in that ſtate of lyfe,
wherein he is placed of the Lorde, and
you ſhall ſee, we are not aſhamed to ſay
in our heartes, There is no God. We
all ſaye with our tongues, that we eſteeme
our ſoules a thouſande times
more deare then our bodies, but compare
that which we do to the one with
that which we ſay of the other, and you
ſhall ſee, that in our heartes we haue

a greater care to preſerue our filthye
carcaſe, then to inſtruct our conſcience
we all ſay with our mouthes, we would
goe to heauen, if wiſhing would bringe
vs to heauen, but we frame our lyues,
as though in our hearts we neither hoped
for heauen, nor beleeued there is a
hell, but looked alwayes to liue vppon
earth. Wee cry out with our mouthes,
fie of the fleſh, and we defte the Diuell
in our wordes, but we are ready to take
his part in our workes, and the leaſt
temptation that is offered vs, is able to
vanquiſhe vs, and cauſe vs to giue the
Diuell our conſent with our heartes.
Thus we mocke God, and we deceaue
our ſelues, but the Diuell he will neither
be deceiued nor mocked of vs, when
time ſhall bee, that the ſecreats of all
hearts ſhall be opened, and the deedes of
all men iudged, he will challenge that,
which is his, and bring in good and ſufficient
euidence to prooue vs to bee his,
then by our owne workes, and not his.
whoſe now we pretend to be with oure
mouthes. Then ſhall we finde that in
earneſt, which now beeing preached to

vs, and yet not felt of vs, we eſteeme but
as a mocke or ieſt.
               
                  A ſecond ſort of mockers there is who
although they confes there is a God,
yet ſaye they, non veniet dies iudicii, that
God will neuer come in iudgement.
                  Eſai. 22. 13. Let
vs therefore cate and drinke,1. cor. 15. 32. for to morrow
we ſhall die, there is noman known
to haue returned from the graue.Sap. 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. & 10. We are
borne at all aduenture, and wee ſhall bee
hereafter, as though we had neuer bene,
our breath is like a ſmoke in our noſtrels,
and words like a ſparke raiſed out of our
hartes, which being extinguiſhed, oure
bodie ſhall be turned into aſhes, and our
ſpirite ſhall vaniſhe as the ſofte aire, our
life ſhall paſſe awaye as the trace of a
cloude, and come to naught as the miſte
that is driuen awaye with the beames of
the ſame, and put downe with the heate
thereof: our name alſo ſhalbe forgotten
by litle and litle, and no man ſhall haue
our works in remembrance, for our time
is a day ſhadowe, that paſſeth away, and
after oure ende, there is no returning.
Come on therfore, let vs enioy the pleaſures,
that are preſent, and let vs cheerefullye

vſe the creatures like as in youthe.
Let euery one of vs bee partakers of oure
voluptuouſneſſe, let vs leaue ſome token
of our pleaſure in euery place: for this is
our portion, and this onely our lot. Let
vs oppreſſe the pore righteous, let vs not
ſpare the widowe or old man, let vs not
regard the heads, that are graye for age,
and ſo forth as it followeth in the booke
of wiſedome, where the life and manner
of theſe ſecond ſorts of moekers and epitures
is liuely deſcribed and ſet foorth
at large. The Apoſtle tearmeth them
                  Phil. 3. 17. & 19
                        •
                     
                  
ennemies to the croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe
end is damnation,Rom. 16. 18. whoſe God is their
belly, and glory to their ſhame, minding
onely earthly things, and not ſeeking after
thoſe thinges that are aboue.col. 3. 1. & 2.
               
               The third ſort of mockers there is,
which ſaye with the ill ſeruant Tardat
dominus venire, theſe proue there is agod,
& that God wil at laſt come in iudgement,
but yet preſuming of his mercy, &
life they differ their repentaunce to the
houre of death, thinking they may repēt
them, when they will, & that they ſhall
haue leiſure enough when they are old &

ready to dye. But O ye fooles and mockers
of God remēber with your ſelues,
that like as God is mercifull, ſo goeth
wrath from him alſo, & his indignation
commeth downe vppon ſinners.
                  Ec. 5. 6. & 7. 
                  Make
no tarrying therfore to turne to the Lord,
and put not off from day to daye, for ſodenlye
ſhall his wrath come, and in the
time of vengeance he ſhall deſtroy thee.
Put not of thy repentance therefore in
hope to attaine to old age, or to find God
mercifull at the laſte houre. For thou
knoweſt not, whether thou ſhalt liue, till
thou arte olde, and death when he commeth,
hee aſketh not, howe long a man
hath liued, but as hee findeth him, ſo hee
taketh him. But ſuppoſe,Eccl. 4. 1. thou liueſt,
till thou art old, how art thou ſure, that
thou ſhalt haue the ſpace of an houre, on
quarter, or minute of an houre, before
that death doth ſtrike thee with his dart.
Olde father Iſaac confeſſed,Gen. 27. 2. 
                  hee knewe
not the day of his death, much leſſe doſt
thou knowe,Prech. 9. 11. the howre of thy death. For
as fiſhes are taken with the angle, and
birdes cought in the ſhare, euen ſo are
men ouertaken with death. But when

thou doſt ſicken, what if thou doſte liue
an houre, a day, a weeke before thou die,
art thou ſure in ye howre, day, or weeke
to haue a mind to call for God his grace
and repente thee of thy life miſliked:
Or doſt thou thinke, that a wicked man
can repent him, when he will, and when
he liſt? why then did not Caine repent,
why did not Saul, why Iudas, why Eſau?
who (as the apoſtle ſaith) founde no
place of repentance, though he ſought it
carefully with teares.
                  Heb. 12. 17. No repentance is
the free gift of the grace of God, who giueth
it to euery man, when he will, to
whom he will, and in what meaſure hee
will according to the riches of his mercie,
which is free, and not tyed to the
will and pleaſure of man. And commonly
the iudgemente of God is ſuche, they
forget themſelues at the howre of death,
who in their liues thought not vppon
GOD.
               
                  Age poenitentiam ergo (ſayth Auguſtine)
dum ſanus 
                        〈◊〉
                     . Nam ſi poenitentiam
agis, quando peccare non potes peccatate
demiſerunt non tu illa. Repent thee therefore
in time of thy health: For if thou doſt

repent thee in tyme of ſickneſſe, when
thon canſt not ſin,Math. 9. 
                  thy ſinnes haue there
left thee, and not thou them. Such was
the repentaunce of that ſame blaſphemous
Antiochus, who in deſpight of
God (as it were) had vowed to make
Hieruſalem a heape of ſtones, woulde
take vpon him to commaund the flouds
of the ſea, weigh the mountaines in a
payre of ballance, reach vp to the ſtars,
and pull God out of heauen: yet ſodenly
in his greateſt brauery God caſt him
violently down from his chariot, ſmote
him with an incurable plague, a horrible
payne of his bowels, and inwarde
partes, in ſo muth, that the woormes
came ſerauling out of his guts, his fleſh
rotted, and fell from his bones, which
ſtancke ſo horriblye that no man coulde
abyde the ſauour of him, nor he of himſelfe,
and thus with extremitie of paine
eyther the remorſe of conſcience he was
brought to this point, that he confeſſed,
It is reaſon to be obedient to God, and
that man which is mortall, thinke not
through pride to be equall with God. A
like kinde of repentaunce did the Lorde

wringe oute of harde harted Pharao
who in time of his proſperitye and welfareExo. 5.
was nota ſhamed to extoll himſelfe
aboue God, acknowledging no Lorde
better then himſelfe, and therefore deſpiſing
God, and his meſſengers Moſes
and Aaron, who were ſent in embaſſage
to him. But in the end when hee
felte ſuche plagues layde vppon him, as
hee coulde neyther driue them awaye
with tyrannycall courage, aſſwage
them by counſell, put them from him
by pollicye, nor reſiſte them with
power, he was ſo humbled and brought
downe therby for the preſent time, as he
confeſſed, The lord is righteouſe, and I &
my people vngodly.
                  Exod. 9. 27. But when the lord
ceaſed to plague him, by and by did hee
ceaſe to remember him, muche lyke to
thoſe ſame backeſlyding people of Iſraell,
who, when the lord ſlue them, ſought
him, and enquired after GOD remembring
that hee was their ſtrengthe and
redeemer. But they did but flatter him
with their lyppes, and diſſembled in
their tongue, for their hartes were
not whole with him, neyther continued

they ſtedfaſt in his couenaunte. So that
we may ſet, that euen hipocrites and 
                     •
                  irauntes,
ſuche as haue neyther caſte of
God his mercie, nor ſeare of his iuſtice,
in time of their health, wealth and preſperitie,
are yet humbled and brought to
knowledge of them ſelues, and conſtrained
to acknowledge the maieſtye
and power of GOD with theire
mouthes, when they feele the execution
of his iudgementes laide vppon theire
bodies.
               But this manner of repentance as it
is but hipocriticall & diſſembled and not
proceeding from the harte in vs, ſo neyther
doth it moue the lord, who lercheth
the harte, to haue pittie and compaſſion
vpon vs, but doth 
                     ••
                  ther aggrauate his
heauie wrath and diſpleaſure againſte
vs. who deſpoſing the riches of his goodneſſe,
patience, & long ſufferance, wherby
he leadeth vs to repētance,Rom. 3. 4. 5. & 6. according
to our hardnes and harts, who cannot repent
doe heape vp wrath to our ſelues againſt
the day of wrath, and declaration
of the righteouſe iudgements of GOD,
who will rewarde euerie man according

to his deedes. Let vs take heede therefore,
mocke not with God, but alwayes
endeuoure oure ſelues by the example
of the Apoſtle heere, to bee the ſame
men inwardlye in conſcience beefore
GOD, which wee will ſeeme to bee
outwardlye in conuerſation before the
worlde, leaſt in the ende wee bee accounted
among thoſe mocking ſooles, which
ſay in their hartes,1. Iohn. 23 
                  there is no God. If
our hartes condemne vs, God is greater
then our harts, and knoweth all thinges.
Neyther let vs thinke with our ſelues,
that bycauſe the Lorde doth not as
yet come in iudgement, therefore wee
maye liue in ſecuritye withont all feare
or dread of his iudgemente, as the ſeconde
ſort of mockers doe, which thinke
he will neuer come in iudgement, but
rather as it becommeth good chriſtiās.
Semper vigilemus bene viuendo, ne nouiſſimus
dies cuiuſque noſtrum inueuiat nos imparatos. Let vs watche and waite
for hys comming in honeſte conuerſation
of lyfe, that the latter daye
of euerye one of vs finde vs not vnprepared,
                  
beeleeuing allwayes that

he will come, whom wee are ignorant,
when he wil come. Neither let vs think
the lord is ſlacke in cōming, as the third
ſort of mockers due.2. Pet. 3. 9. 
                  For he is not ſlacke,
as they count ſlackeneſſe, but hee is patient
to vs ward, bicauſe hee woulde haue
mercie of all and none to periſh. Howſoeuer
we mocke with him, or how mercifully
ſoeuer he dealeth with vs, or how
long ſoeuer hee deferreth his comming
to vs, yet in the ende, hee will come, and
wil not tarrie, at which time of his comming
Wee muſte appeare beefore his
iudgement ſeate, &c. whereof that wee
ſhould be the more aſſuredly perſwaded,
the apoſtle not without great vehemencie
of ſpirite aswell as of ſpeche, telleth
vs that we muſt appeare. As though he
ſhould ſaye, how long ſoeuer the Lorde
may ſeeme to linger his comming, and
howe lothe ſoeuer wee bee to haue him
come, yet in the ende come hee will, and
neceſſitie of his comming is ineſchuable,
it cannot any waye, or of anye creature
be auoyded.
               This Oportet or muſt,
                   in this place
is ſuppriced by diuerſe reaſons,Oportet. whereof

the firſt is grounded of the eternal purpoſe,
decree, & counſel of God, and therfore
of neceſſitye it muſt bee accompliſhed.
If it were the counſell, purpoſe,
or determination of man, it were poſſible
either to fruſtrate it, or at leaſt to alter
and chaunge it. Men are men, conſtant
in nothing ſo much as inconſtancy,
which they will to day they wil to morrow,
that whiche they fullye purpoſe at
one tyme, vppon better aduiſe, they will
diſpoſe themſelues to the contrary at an
other. But this is the purpoſe of God.
If the Lorde of hoſtes determine a thing,
who is able to diſanull it.
                  Eſai. 14. 27. Since this
therefore is determined by God, it followeth

               The ſeconde reaſon is taken from
the vndoubted truthe, and vertue of
his woorde and promiſe, whereuppon
wee grounded our faythe, and
whiche in all poyntes ſhall bee fulfilled
and perfourmed accordingly as
hee hath ſpoken it.Mat. 2

the righte hande of the power of God,

vp into heauen in a cloude, were
promied by twoo Angelles, whiche
ſtoode by them that the man Ieſus,

was taken vppe from them into heauen,
ſhoulde ſo come as they had ſeene
him goe into heauen, at whoſe comming
all men ſhall riſe agayne with
their bodies, and ſhall giue accompte for
their owne workes.
               It is of neceſſitie therefore, that wee
muſt appeare,
                  1. Cor. 15 15 10. 17. & 18. 
                  &c. Otherwiſe (ſaithe

youre faithe is alſo vaine, yea and we are

wee haue teſtifyed of God, howe that

But the preaching of the Apoſtles
is true, oure faythe grounded
vppon the doctryne of Chriſte and
his Apoſtles is true, and wee beeleeue
and receaue it for an vndoubted

trueth, that GOD hathe rayfed vp
Ieſus from the dead and that by vertue
of his reſurrection wee all muſt ryſe agayne,
and they lykewiſe Muſte appeare.
               
               A thirde reaſon maye be taken from
the iuſtice of GOD. For (as the Apoſtle
ſayth) if in this life onely we haue
hope in Chriſte, then are wee of all men

                  then we, which liue, and which remayne,
ſhall be caught vp together with
them in the cloudes to meet the Lord in
the ayer, to remaine and liue with him
for euer. So that whether we remaine
aliue, or be found dead at his comming,
We muſt all appeare, &c. All, whether
we died at home or abroad, in our beds,
or in the field, whether we were drowned
in the ſea, or ſlaine on the lande, or
whatſoeuer becommeth of our bodyes
in this life to come.Apoc. 20. 13 
                  We muſt all appeare
&c. I ſaw the ſea giue vp her dead, death
and hell (ſaith S. Iohn) deliuered vp
the dead, that were in them, and al ſtood
before God. Manye thinke, that thoſe
bodyes, which are buried in Chriſtian
buriall (as they tearme it) that is, ſuch
as are laid in graues and included with
in Church walles-ſhall riſe againe, but
as for thoſe bodies, which haue beene
brent and conſumed to aſhes, ſlayne in
fieldes, and veuoured of wild beaſtes, or

corne in peeces with vermine, or which
haue miſcarried on the ſeas, they thinke
it impoſſible, that thoſe bodies ſhould be
brought againe. But that which is impoſſible
to man is poſſible with God, &
al is one with him, whether the ſea hath
receaued vs or lande, the Church or the
Chancel, earth or water, and as eaſie it
is for him to raiſe vp our bodies out of
the earth, ſea, or land, as it was eaſie for
him at the firſte of nothing to make vs
ſomething, and with the breath of his
ſpirite to breath into vs a liuing ſoule,
which before were boyde of life. Doſt

                     •
                  oe thou ſee, it is poſſible for thee being
but a man and the creatour of God, to
ſtrike ſter out of the harde flint, where
before thou flindeſt it, it may ſeeme impoſſible
to haue fier? And why ſhouldeſt
thou thinke it were impoſſible thy creator
and maker, which hath giuen that
nature to the ſtone, & that power to thee,
himſelfe hauing greater power to raiſe
thy body out of ye duſt, water or cinders,
ſeeing at firſt he gaue thee thy bodye.
Thoſe that finde not them ſelues thus
ſatiſfied with the conſideration of the

omnipotent power of God, but requyre
to be further ſatiſfied with reaſon,1. Cor. 15. 36 the apoſtle
ſaith there are fooles & mad men,
as thaugh he ſhould ſay, the reſurrectiō
of the body is either to be beleeued that
it ſhalbe, then to be reaſoned vpon, how
it can be & they but fooles & madd men,
that will ſtand reaſoning about it, when
they are bound ſimply to beleue it. Nay
he, that will call in queſtion euery kind
of doctrine in the ſcriptures, wherof he
cannot conceaue or giue a reaſon, maye
chaunce to doubt of the higheſt points of a
chriſtian mans faith and religion. For
what reſon in there, that there ſhould be
one, and one three, as that the Father
ſhoulde be God, the ſonne God, and the
holye Ghoſte God, & yet not three Gods,
but one God, a trinity in vnity, and an
vnitye in trinitye. What reaſon is
there, that a Virgine ſhoulde conceiue
with childe, beare a childe, and yet after
her conception and birth, remain a pure
and vndefiled virgine ſtil? What reaſon
is there, that a man deade, buried, &
laid in his graue three daies, ſhould riſe
again aliue? Or what is he, that baring

the name of a Chriſtian dare denye, or
doubt of the truth of theſe thinges, becauſe
he ſeeth not the reaſon of thē. No
God almighty his miſteries are hid and
inſerchable, not to be conſtrued by reaſon,
but conceiued by faith. And we are
taught in the ſcriptures, & bound to beleeue
many things, whereof our reaſon
can conceiue but few. I come to the lord
his table, who hath hidden me vnder the
ſigne of bread & wine to receiue his bodye
and drincke his bloud and I doe nothing
doubt, but he doth truly offer him
ſelfe to me, and I do truely receiue him.
Howbeit if anye man aſke me, how hee
beeing in heauen ſhoulde be receiued in
earth. I aunſwere as Maiſter Caluine.

experior magis quam intelligam: Itaque
veritatem dei, in qua acquieſcere tuti licet,
hic ſine controuerſia amplector. That is,
If anye man aske me of the maner howe
Chriſte is preſent in the Sacrament,

I will not ſhame to confeſſe, that it is a
higher miſtery, than can either bee conceiued
with my wit, or expreſſed with
my tongue, and to ſpeake more plainely,
I rather feele it, then vnderſtande it, And
therefore in this poynt I doe willinglye
embrace God his truth, wherein I doe
ſafely reſt & ſtay. So for the reſurrection
of the dead, though I ſee no reaſon in
it, or that the reaſon is hid from me, yet
I doe acknowledge it to be an article of
my Chriſtian faith, and therefore do vndoubtedly
beleeue, that the ſpirit of him
that rayſed Ieſus from the dead ſhall
raiſe my mortall and corruptible bodye,
and that my bodie, and all mens bodies,
throughe his omnipotente power and
myght being ſo raiſed Muſt appeare before
the iudgement ſeate of Chriſte, &c.
But heere now leaſte anye man ſhoulde
thinke, that among ſuch a multitude as
muſt then appeare, it were poſſible for
ſome to hide themſelues, from the preſence
of their iudge, and ſo eſcape the ſeueritie
of his ſentence, therefore the Apoſtle
ſaith we ſhal not onely be ſummoned
by the trumpe of the Lorde, and ſo

diſmiſſed agayne, but of neceſſitye We
muſt ad appeare before him, and can no
waye hide our ſelues from him. The
worde Apparere, that is, appeare, is
very emphaticall in this place, notinge
vnto vs the appearaunce of the ſoule as
the bodye, the inwarde heart and conſcience,
as well as the outward man. And
becauſe the nature of the wicked is to
promiſe themſelues perpetuall impunitie
of thoſe ſimes before God, whereof
they can not bee detected before the
world, to confute and confound that vain
hope of theirs, the Apoſtle telleth them
plainly, they muſt then appeare. Which
importeth ſo much, as if he ſhould ſaye,
whereas we haue heere played the Hipocrites,
diſſembled our ſelues and oure
ſinnes before men with a counterfaite
ſhow of vprightnes not beeing the ſame
men before God in our conſciences, now
we muſt haue the vizardes pulled of frō
our faces and be vncaſed, laid wide open

wherin is recorded our daily ſins, which
howſoeuer they be diſſembled of vs now
ſhall then be reuealed, brought to light,
and puniſhed, when we muſt appear, &c.
And therfore is this day and time of our
appearaunce termed of the Apoſtle, dies

that anye thing ſhall then be declared to

knoweth our down ſitting, our vpriſing,
he vnderſtandeth all our thoughtes long

word in our tong, but he knoweth it altogether,
if we climbe vp into heauen, he is
there, if we go down into hell, he is there,
if we remaine in the vttermoſt partes of
the ſea, he is there alſo, if we think darknes
ſhal hid vs, the darknes is no darknes
with him, but the night is as cleare as
the day, darknes & light are both alike.

To conclude, all thinges are naked and
open to his eies, and there is no creature,
that is not manifeſt in his ſight, but wherfore
is the daye of iudgemente tearmed
of the Apoſtle,Hebr. 4. 13. 
                  the day of declaration, for
that nothing is ſo ſecretlye concealed of

                  Mar. 4. 22. The daye of this lyfe, is one
daie, and may be tearmed, the day of our
diſſimulation, the day, which followeth
immediately after this life, is the lords,
and is tearmed, the daye of declaration.

                  ſhall declare the wickednes of the wicked,
and the earthe, whiche nowe doeth
beare him, ſhall then take parte againſte
him. Now the ten virgins go together,
walke together, talke together, eat and
drinke together: but at that day, it ſhall
appeare, who are wiſe, who fooliſh, who
haue ſlept, & who haue watched, whiche
of them had oyle in their Lampes, and
which way, which of them ſhalbe admitted
vnto the marriage,Matth. 25. and whiche excluded
and ſhut oute. Now the corne &
chaffe lie together on a heape in one flowre,
and are not yet ſcucrd, but at that

dtye,Matt. 3. 12.

carrye his wheate into his garner,
but burne his chaffe with vnquenchable
fier, Now the wheate and tares growe
together in one fielde, and are not yet
weeded out,Mat. 13. 30. but at the daye the lorde of
the harueſt, will ſaye to the reapers, gather
the eares, and bind them vp in bundels
to burne them, but carry the wheate
into the barne. Nowe the ſheepe and
goates go together, feede together, and
are foulded together, but at that daye
ſhall the chiefe ſheapehard ſeperate the
ſheepe from the gouts, placing the ſhepe
one his righte hande, and the goates on
the left. Now the world doth deride, and
the children of GOD doe weepe and lament,
but at that day they ſhall be comforted,
and the other ſhall be tormented.Rom. 8. 19. & 21.
                  Nowe all the creatures of God do grone
and trauaile in paine with vs, looking
when the ſonnes of God ſhall appeare
but at that daye they ſhall bee freed of
the bondage of corruption, and vanitye,
whereunto they are now ſubiect. Nowe
the very heauens are not pure in his ſight,
                  
but at that day the heauens being on fire
ſhalbe diſſolued, and the elements ſhall
melt with heate, and wee looke for a

of this life are not worthy of that glory

                  our hartes being pure from
an ill conſcience waſhed in oure bodies
with pure wator, and that ſo much the rather,
bicauſe we ſee the end of al things to

appeare the apoſtle calleth
it, The iudgemente ſeate.

we muſt appeare, is Chriſt,
For the father hath giuen all iudgement
to the ſon, & the articles of our Chriſtion
faith do teache vs to be leeue,Iohn. 5. 22. that hee
ſhall come to iudge the quicke and the
deade, not that God the father and God
the holy ghoſt ſhall then be excluded and
not ioyned in iudgement with him, but
for that the viſible execution of this
iudgemente ſhall bee doone by the ſecond
perſon in trynitye God the ſonne,
who ſhall then ſitte one his ſeate of
iudgemente to giue euerye man &c.
Nowe hee ſitteth one his ſeate of mercy
as oure mediator and aduocare making
continuall interceſſion, to God his

Father for vs: Sitting on his ſeate of
iudgement hee ſhall pronounce the ſentence
of condemnation againſt vs. Now
be offereth himſelfe to be intertained &
calleth al men to be his clientes, that are
opreſſed with their ennemies, the world,
fleſh or diuell, come to me all ye that labour
and are laden, and I will refreſh,

now reſiſt to come, when he thus calleth
them in mercy he wil refuſe them, when
he ſhall come in iudgement and whereas
now he biddeth them come, & they will
not come, he will then commaund them
to depart. Now he knoweth thoſe, that
are his: but thoſe, that nowe will not
knowe him, be will not knowe them.

Another ſigne going before his comming
is, The Goſpell shall be preached
in all the world for a witneſſe of all nations,
whereby he noteth vnto vs, that towardes
his comming the goſpell ſhal be
preached to all nations, profeſſed alſo of
many, but practiſed of a fewe, but be a
witnes and teſtimony againſt him. For
notwithſtandinge the preaching of the
Goſpell,Tim. 4. 1. 2. & 3. 
                  ſome shall departe from the
faith and shall giue heed to ſpirites of errour,
                  2. Tim. 3. 1.
                  and doctrines of diuels,
                  2. Pet. 3. 3. 
                  which ſpeak
lyes through hypocriſie,
                  lud. g18. 
                  and haue their
conſciences burned with a hot iron, forbidding
to marry, and commaunding to
abſteyne from meates, which God hath
created to bee receaued with giuinge of
thankes of them, which beleeue & know
the truth.
               
               An other ſigne is, that faith ſhall
faile, charitie waxe could, and iniquitye
abound. For men shall be louers of them
ſelues,
                  2. Tim. 3. 2. 3. 4.& 5. 
                  couetous, proude boaſters, curſed
ſpeakers, diſobedient to parentes, vnthankfull,
without naturall affection,
truthbreakers, falſe accuſers, intemperate,
fierce, no louers at all of thoſe that

are good, traitours, heady, high minded,
louers of pleaſures more then of GOD,
hauing a ſhew of Godlines, but denying
the power thereof. But for all this the
ende is not yet, For that daye ſhall not
come, except there come a departinge
firſt, and that the man of ſinne be discloſed,
euen the ſonne of perdition, which
is an aduerſary and exalteth him ſelfe againſte
all that is called God,
                  2. Ehe. 2. 3. & 4. 
                  or that is
worſhipped ſittinge as God in the temple
of God, ſhewing him ſelfe that he is
God.
               
               Theſe are the heginninges of ſorrowes,
the manifeſt demonſtrations of
his comming, and the experience of thē
in our dayes do plainely Prognoſticate
vnto vs, that he can not be farre of. For
daylye doe we heare of warres and tumors
of warres: neuer was the world ſo
full of newes, and fearefull rumors: nation
doth riſe againſt nation, and realme
againſt realme. And euen now is the
time, that the ſonne is at variance with
the father, the father with the ſonne, &c.
Euen now can one ſtate hardly abyde another
without grudging, diſliking or

diſdaine, or if they agree in matters of
policy & gouerment, yet do they hardly
agree in matters of faith and religion in
one houſe, where they are nighly ioyned
together, it is hard to finde twoo of one
mind, & amonge thoſe that ſeeme to conſent
in opinions, not to haue the ſelfe
ſame man in ſome thinges to diſſent frō
them ſelues. Euen now is the Goſpell
preached, & yet euen now in the time of
the Goſpell doe ſome depart from the
truth, giuing beede to ſpirites of errour
and doctrine of Diuels, forbidding to
marrye and eat meates, who the Lorde
bath ordained to be receiued with thākſgiuing.
Euen now alſo doth faith faile,
faith in religion, faith in worde of promiſe,
in bargening, buying, and ſelling,
and no truth to be found, charitye kaiecold,
a care to eache man, common abuſes
remaines in many, pity, mercye, and
compaſſion, and iudgement remayneth
in few. Iniquity is growne to ſuch perfection
in both ſects, all ſtates, ages and
callinges, that it hath almoſt gotten the
vpper hand. For when was there euer

of him that ſhall be our iudge by twoo
excellent points of iuſtice, one in that he
will reward euery man, the other is in
that he will rewarde them according to

abiding of the poore ſhall not alwais
be forgotten. The lord may diſſēble

ſhall make the righteous as cleare as the

the meane tyme fret not thy ſelf, bicauſe
of the vngodlye, neyther be thou enuious
at euill doers, nor grieued at the
wicked or vngodlye, whom thou ſeeſt

in proſperitie. For proſperitie neyther
commeth from the Eaſte, nor from the
Weſte, nor yet from the South, but the
Lorde ſetteth vp one and pulleth downe
an other.
               
                  And thoughe for a tyme the wicked
floriſhe lyke a greene baye tree,Pſal. 37. 35. 35.
yet ſodenlye doe they goe downe to
the grounde, where they are kepte to
the daye of deſtruction, and ſhall bee
broughte foorthe to the daye of wrath,
and come to a fearefull ende, and not
bee able to ſtande in iudgement,Iob. 21. 30. 31. & 32. nor
in the congregation of the righteous,Preach. 1. 5. but
receaue according to that whiche they
haue done, &c.
               The ſeconde note of his vprightneſſe
is in this, that hee will rewarde
euerye man, and euerye man ſhall receaue
according to his doeing, whereby
the holye Ghoſte ſignifieth vnto
vs, then he will proceede in iudgemente
accordinge to the circumſtance
euidence, and matter hanginge beefore
hym in iudgement, nor reſpectynge the
man, whoſe the cenſe is, but the matter

what it is. For where the man is not
reſpected & not the matter, their iuſtice
is peruerted, but where the matter is
weighed, & the man not regarded, there
is iuſtice truly miniſtred. To ſhew therfore
the exact and preciſe forme of God
his iudgement, the Apoſtle ſaith, Euery
man shall receaue according to that,
which he hath done, &c. The iudges of
this worlde they are men and no gods,
and therefore as men they proceede in
iudgement and giue ſentence according
to ſuch euidence, as they ſee with their
eyes, or heare with their eares, & therfore
do erre many tymes in their iudgements,Eſai. 11. 3. & 4.
and ſwarue from the truth. But
he that is lorde and iudge of al men, ſhal
not giue iudgement after the thing that
is brought before his his eyes, neither reproue
after the hearing of his eares, but
with righteouſneſſe & according to the
truth of the hart shall he iudge the earth,
& his people with equitie, euerie man receiuing
according to that which he hath
done in his body &c. Let vs not deceiue
our ſelues therefore being onely vaine
ſpeakers of the worde, and not dooers,

thinking at laſt to win heauen wt ſpeaking
heauenly, if we liue wickedly and
vngodlye. For at the latter daye men
ſhall receiue according to that, whiche
they haue done, & not according to that
whiche they haue profeſſed and ſpoken.
Manye shall ſaye vnto mee in that daye
(ſaith Chriſt,) Lorde wee prophecyed
in thy name,
                  Matt. 7. 22. & 23. 
                  caſte out diuels, and done
many greate woorkes in thy name, and
yet for all their ſo ſaying, Chriſte ſayth,
he will tearme them workers of inniquitie,
                  ver. 21.
and bid them depart from him. For
not euery one that ſaith, Lord, Lord, shal
enter into the kingdome of heauen, but
he, that dothe the will of my father, shall
enter into the kingdome of heauen, ſo
that many good wordes ſhall bee found
in hell, but good workes goe all to heauen.
I ſpeake not this as houlding,Rom. 11. 16. that
wee are iuſtified by our woorkes.2. Tim. 1. 9. 
                  No,
                  Tit. 3. 5.
                  we are ſaued by grace through faith, and
that not of our ſelues,
                  Epheſ. 2. 8. 
                  it is the gift of god.
But if thou braggeſt of faith ſhews me
that ſaythe of this harte by the ſruictes
of thy life. for true chriſtianitye conſiſteth
of owo parts, profeſſion & practice,

or, (to vſe the phraſe of the ſcripture,) of
fayth and good woorkes, and to the perfection
of a chriſtian man both are neceſſarye,
and each doth mutually accompanye
other as the ſhadowe goeth with
the bodie. And as the bodye is knowne
to haue lyfe by it mouing, ſo is the lyfe
of faythe perceiued by working. The
life of the bodye is the ſoule, and the life
of faith is loue: and as the bodie is dead
withoute the ſoule, ſo is fayth withoute
loue, and as circumciſion profited the
Iewes nothing without the lawe, ſo
neither doth faith profit vs without charitye.
Whatſoeuer wee profeſſe, howe
muth ſoeuer we knowe, our Sauioure
Chriſt pronounceth vs ſo farfoorth bleſſed,Ioh. 13. 17.
                  as we doe that wee profeſſe, and followe,
                  Ioh. 15. 14.
                  that we knowe. They that profes
the fayth of chriſtians, and doe not confirme
it with a Chriſtian lyfe are like
belles in the ſteeple whiche call others
to churthe with their ſounde, but neuer
come into it them ſelues, lyke fayre
paynted ſepulchers, whiche are full of
gaye golden pictures and immages
without, but ful of dead carcaſes and filthie

corruption within, like ſalte, which
hath his colour, but loſt his ſauour, like
a candell, whiche is lighte, but hidden
vnder a buſhell. But let youre lighte,

of a Chriſtian conſiſteth not in ſpeaking
but in dooinge They ſhall leaue their
woordes beehinde them, but theire
woorkes ſhall followe them, and they
receaue according to that whiche they
haue doone.
               
               Dooing is double and
of two ſortes.
               
                  1 Well dooing.
                  2 Ill dooing.
               
               And boeth ſhall bee rewarded accordinglye.
Hee that hathe doone well,
ſhall receaue accordinge to his well

doing, not that any man doth wel of him
ſelfe. For all fleſhe hath corrupted his
way, and all the immaginations, of oure
hartes is euill euerie daye, There is not
one, that doth good, no not one, our lips
are full of curſing and bitterneſſe, not apt
or abell to vtter a good word, much leſſe
are we able to doe a good worke. Men
doe not gather grapes of thornes, nor
figges of thiſtles, & we beinge ſhapen in
wickednes & conceiued in ſinne are as
vnapt & as vnable to bring foorth good
fruites, as thornes are to bring foorth
grapes, or thiſtles figges. But yet as
the ſtocke of a ſower crabbe may bring
foorth a ſweete apple, if the graffe bee
good: ſo we being the children of wrath
by nature may bring foorth good fruits
by grace, if Chriſte bee ingraffed into
our hartes by faith. For withoute mee
(ſayth hee) you can do nothing. I am the
vine,
                  Iohn. 15. 4. 
                  you are the braunches, he that abideth
in me, and in whom I bide he bringeth
forth much fruit. But as the braunch
cannor bring forth fruit of it ſelf, except it
abide in the vine, ſo neither can you, except
you abide in me.
               
               
                  
To make our workes good therefore it
is neceſſarie to obſerue theſe foure circumſtaunces,1. Tim. 1 5.
                  that we doe them in loue,
with a pure hart, a good conſcience, and
faith vnfayned, Howe glorious a ſhewe
of godlineſſe or good intention ſoeuer
our woorkes doe carrye before men, if
theſe foure conditions bee not obſerued
in doing them, wee that are the doers of
them (as ſaythe the Apoſtle,) are but
vaine ianglers and no frutifull workers.1. Tim. 1. 6.

declareth that whatſoeuer thinges are
not of faith, they are not to be decided as
good things, but as vices rather which
iuſtify not the doers of them, but rather
do condemne them. When the ſcripture

that euery man ſhalbe rewarded accordinge
to that, whiche hee hath doone,
that manner of ſpeaking is not ment of
the merite of oure dooinges (for that

wee ſhoulde all be rewarded with euerlaſting
damnation and hell fier) but that

according to the teſtimonye of
that, which hee hath done bearing witneſſe
of our faith with vs, or of want of

whome he is well pleaſed, and in whoſe

in mercie reward it.
               Now we are to conſider, that the Apoſtle
ſaith, Euery inan ſhall receiue according

If we muſt anſwere euery idell woorde,

Or if we cānot anſwere our idel deedes,
how ſhal we be able to ſuſteine the puniſhment
which we muſt receiue for our il

appeale from God his iuſtice, and oure

iudgement with thy ſeruants O lorde for
no fleſh is righteus in thy ſight, and haue
mercie vppon me O God, not according

doe awaye my offences, &c. For otherwiſe
we muſt all prepare our ſelues

our ſinne neuer ſo light or littell, committed
in thought, woorde, or deede, is
death of bodye and death of ſoule to euery
one according to that, which he hath
done. Vppon the vngodlye ſhall come
ſnares, fier, & brimſtone, ſtormie & tempeſt,

The Prophet vſeth many words, wher
of euery one may ſeeme more greeuous
then other, to teache vs, that the greater
ſhalbe the puniſhment, which the ſinner
ſhal receiue according to that, which
he ſaith in the ſecond chapter to the Romaines,
that the impenitent preſumptious
ſinner doth heap vp wrath to himſelf
&c. as who ſhould ſaye God will heape
damnation vpon his head in life to come
as he hath heaped one ſinne vppon an other
in this life, not that there are many
helles, or many ſiers in bell,Greg. ſap. illus. but that the
iuſtice of God re quireth to meaſure out
y• grieuouſnes of their puniſhment accor
to the grieuouſnes of their ſines,Mat. Egerientur in tenebras. &c. 
                  vt et ignem
non diſſimilem habeant & tamen eosdem

ſingulos exurat,
                  Pſa. 5. 1. 1. 2. that not hauing a diuerſe
fire yet euery one to be tormented
the ſame wt fire, euen as we feel in our do
dies, wheras many ſtand together in the
ſun, & the ſun hath like power of them,
all alike, yet doe they not all feele the
like heat, but ſome feele it hotter then
other ſome, euery man according to the
complexion and conſtitution of his body.
Euen ſo according to the quality of
his ſinne ſhall euerye man receaue his
puniſhment. And therefore in the daye
of iudgement it ſhall hee eaſie for Sodome
and Gomortha then for thoſe Cities.
Townes and perſons, which haue
hard remiſſion of ſinnes preached in the
name of Ieſus, & yet haue not repented.
For the ſeruant, that knew his maiſters
wil and did it not ſhalbe beaten with many
ſtripes. If that reuerend and childiſh
feare of God therefore cannot win vs to
eſchue euill and do good, yet let this ſeruile
and ſlauiſhe feare, the feare of puniſhement
ſtaie vs and make vs a fraide
to perſeuer in our ill, leaſt accordinge to
the greeuouſnes of the ſame in oure
ſoules, at laſt we reſeaue double damnation
in our bodyes.
               
                  
For although euery man, ſo ſone as the
ſoule and body are parted by death, hath
his particular iudgement, and receiueth
in his ſoul (which preſently mounteth
either to heauen, or is carryed to
hell) the rewarde of ioye or paine, which
either thorough ſinne he hath deſerued,
or the Lorde in merrye doth freely giue
him, yet doth he nor receiue the ſame in
body (which remayneth in the graue) til
the generall reſurrection and iudgement
of all fleſh, at what time the bodye
ſhall be vnited to the ſoule, and be made
partaker of the ſame euerlaſting ioyes
in heauen, or eternall torments in hell,
as it was partaker with the bodye in ſin
vpon earth. If any man therfore aſke,
wherefore and what there ſhould neede
to be a ſecond iudgement, ſince euerie
man hath his iudgement already, I anſwere
out of the Apoſtle; that euery man
may receaue in his body that which hee
hath already receaued in his ſoule. L

For euery man ſhall receaue accordinge

I ſhall not receaue accordinge to that,
which thou haſte done in thy bodye, nor
thou ſhalt not receaue according to that
which I haue done in my bodye, but I

my bodye, and thou according to that,
which thou

ſoule, that hath ſinned, that ſoule ſhall
dye the death. Though the father haue
eaten ſowre grapes, the childrens teeth

                  Ezech 18. 2. & 20. 
                  The ſonne ſhall

Noe, Daniell, and Iob shall in their owne

                  but euery

                  according to his own labour. Let
no man therefore truſte to other mens
works & prayers after he is deade, thinking
to be releaued by them, as he that
was ſent for to the great ſupper though
he might bee excuſed by the meſſenger,
though he came not himſelf, & manye in
theſe dayes hauing liued very wickedly
thē ſelues, think to compound with God
almighty for their ſins & life miſlead by
almes deedes and prayers, not dooinge
them ſelues in their own liues, but making
other men their factors, & poſting
them ouer to their executors to be done
for thē after their deathes. But thou fooliſh
man, then that good which after thy
death is done by others, is theirs, and
not thine, and they ſhall receaue for it
and not thou. While thou haſt time therfore,
make ſure thy ſaluation thy ſelfe,
and as much,Gal. 6. 10. as in thee lyeth Doe good
to all men,
                  Preche. 12. 1 
                  eſpecially to the houſhold of

                  Prech. 9. 10. 
                  put
thy righteouſneſſe before iudgement, &
ſo ſhalt thou finde grace in the ſight of
the Lord.
                  1. cor. 9. 9.

there is neither worke, counſell,

For God is not vnrighteous to forget
our workes and labours of loue, But what

A ſweete and comfortable doctrine to

the children of God, who then ſhal haue
an end of all thoſe miſeries, whereto in
this lyfe they were ſubiect, reſting at

kingdome, and a beawtifull crowne
at the lords hand, for with his right hand
ſhall he carrie them, and with his arme

moſte terrible and fearefull to

                  Sap. 5. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. & 22. For the ieloſie of the lord

Then ſhall the thunder boultes go right

wroth againſt them and the winde ſhall
ſtande vp againſte them to ſcatter them
abrode. Then shall the righteous ſtande
in great boldnes before the face of ſuch,
as haue dealt extreamly with them, and
taken away then labours. When the vngodlye
ſhall ſee it they shall bee vexed
with horrible feare, and shall onder at
their health ſo farre beyond all, that they
looked for. And chaunging their opinions
with groaning for redreſſe of minde,
they shall ſay, this is he whom ſometime
we had in deriſion and ieſted vpon. We
fooles thought his life very madnes, and
his end to be without honour. But loe,
how he is counted among the children
of God, and his portion is amonge the
ſaints. Therefore haue we erred from the

                  way of truth, the light of righteouſneſſe
hath not shined vnto vs, & the ſun of vnderſtanding
hath not roſe vpon vs. We
haue wearied ourſelues in the waye of
wickednes and deſtruction, but as for the
way of the Lord, we haue not known it,
What good hath pride done vnto vs? Or
what profit hath the pompe of riches
brought vnto vs. All theſe things are paſſed
like a shadow, and as a Poſt that haſteth
by, &c. As ſone as we were borne,
we began immediatlye to drawe to oure
ende, and haue shewed no token of vertue,
but are conſumed in our owne wickednes.
If they ſhoulde haue no other
iudge to condemne them, if there were
no diuel to watch for them, no hel to receiue
them, no fire in hell to torment
them, what greater torment maye be imagined,

chaines, to be caſte into palpable darkenes
of the Diuels dungeon, where the

not out, but continual weping and gnaſhing
of teeth, howling, yelling, and criyng
without eaſe of payne, or comfort of

liue in hope of liberty, and releaſe

(as with whome by occaſion of a
ſuite I had in Chauncerie, I was firſt acquainted,
and through whome my acquaintaunce
grew with the reſte of your
brethren) to impart the ſame vnto them,
not for anye cauſe of deſert in it, but for
that it was their pleaſures to deſire it, and
I gaue promiſe to ſend it. Howbeit if it
ſhall not ſo pleaſe their eares in the reading,
as it doth mooue their hartes in the
ſpeaking, they muſt remēber, it wanteth
that ſpirite and action, wherewithall it
was firſt deliuered. And a ſermon which
hath beene vttered with the tongue,
and afterward is written with the penne,
will ſeem no more like it ſelfe to thoſe,
that did firſt heare it, and ſhall now read
it, then a dead image is lyke a liuing creature,
or a dumbe man like him, that can
ſpeake. Beſides it wanteth diuers cotations,
which I would haue added, if oportunitie

and leyſure had ſerued for it beetweene
the writing of it, and the ſending
of it. But whatſoeuer it wanteth in forme
or in words, I truſt, you ſhall finde it the
ſame, that was deliuered in ſubſtaunce.
And ſo with harty thankes for that generall
curtiſie whiche I receiued at all your
handes, I take my leaue, praying you to
accompte of me as yours deſeruedlye alwaies
to bee commaunded in the Lorde,
according to the finall tallente hee hathe
lent me. The Lorde Ieſus haue you in his
keeping, bleſſe you with his holye ſpirite,
and continue you in his feare. From Oxbrough
