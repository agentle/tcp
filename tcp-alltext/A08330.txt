               Held in the presence of two VVorthy Knights, and of a few other Gentlemen, some Catholikes, some Protestants.

            TO THE READER.
            
               IT IS no Nouelty lately practised by the Protestāts of our age; it hath alwaies beene the vsual trade, and inueterate guile of Heretikes in former tymes, to corrupt, falsifie, and depraue, not onlie the Bookes, and Writings, but the wordes, sayings, and other Conferences they haue held with the professours of the Catholike Church.

               Origen
               Ruffin in Apol. pro Orig. complayneth how his bookes were thus abused by the enemies of God, and Sowers of Cockle, euen in his owne dayes. S. Augustine
               Aug. in breui. Collat. writeth, that the Donatists being conuicted of falshood in a Collation he had with them, did after maliciously calumniate, and traduce the sentence giuen against them, as falslie pronounced. The Arians, Pelagians, and other auncient Sectaries were attainted of the like crime. And now our Puritans, and Protestants are proued guiltie of the same, or far more treacherous dealing, by which they labour to vnderproppe the rotten beames of their ruinous, vnconstant, & declining doctrine.

               M. VValsingham in his Search, haue euidētly discouered. Guilty was M. Reynolds in publishing his Conference with M. Hart, wherein he forged diuers things to the credit of his owne, and disaduantage of his Opponents cause, of which he neuer so much as dreamed. Therefore S. Gregorie trulie auerreth of these, and such like heretikes, that, by their labours and disquisitions, they endeauour not so much to attayne the truth, as to seeme victorious: they more eagerlie thirst after the applause of men, then the glory of God: they seeke such things as apertayne to themselues, not such as belong to Iesus Christ.
            
            3. In which kind, most notable now of late, and most fresh in memorie, is the pride and arrogancie of D. Featly, who impudentlie boasted of his supposed Conquest in a meeting which he, & D. VVhite had with M. Fisher, and M. Sweete: from which neuerthelesse he cowardlie fled; wholie discomfited, and blotted with the

ignomonie of a desperate Retraite. No lesse shamefull (though in a conflict lesse famous) is the vanitie of M. VValker, in bragging of the Conference betweene him and M. Smith, which himself hath set forth stuffed with such a heapeof false and guilefull relations, as he may seeme (according to the Prophet) to haue made lying to be protected. Nothing trembling at thatIsa.

So

powerfull is the aduerse faction in bearing vs downe, and openlie disgracing vs with their calumnious libels; and so vigilant and watchfull in stopping all possible meanes we should take, to manifest our innocencie. But such violent oppression cannot still continue; the Widowes teares, the Orphans cryes will at length be heard; and Christs afflicted flocke, our silenced pennes, may find a tyme to lay open our sinceritie, and the wrong which is done vs, by their false criminations.

               M. SMITH, aliâs NORRICE.
               So M. Walker stileth me.
               
                  FIRST then it is false, that I chalenged any Minister to dispute: I onlie yelded for the satisfaction of Syr William Harington, to giue a meeting to any whom he should bringe. Secondly, it is false, that I was assisted by any more Priests then onlie one, by any more Catholikes then foure; I for solemnelie conditioned at the beginning, that there should be no more then fiue or six persons at the most on a side: to the end the Conference might be verie secret, and

priuate, without concourse of people, or noyse abroad, for feare of affoarding disgust vnto the State, in that our quiet tyme of peace and conniuencie. Which conditions I punctuallie obserued, though the Aduersarie was so bold as to violate and infring them, both by bringing more then the appointed number, as by publishing also the whole discourse, to the open view and sight of the Realme; yet so fraudulentlie, so corruptlie, as forceth me to this right and vnfaygned replie. Then, although it be true, that I intreated the disputation might be performed sweetlie, and with all mildnes, without bitter wordes, or reproachfull taunts; yet M. Walker made no such answere as he hath forged in his Pamphlet. True also it is, that I excepted against the vnmannerlie tearmes of calling our Church Whore of Babylon, the Pope Antichrist, & desired no such odious Epithetes might be vsed, now especially whē it pleased the Kings Maiesty to send to his Holines for a dispensation for the mariage of our Noble Prince; Yet I sayd not, that his Maiestie sued to his Holines, or gaue the Pope that honour: The awe of reuerence I bore to so mightie a Monarch did temper my tongue from vsing any such wordes, as seemed to carry the least shew of distast. At length that we might proceed more solidelie, and not floate vp and downe vpon vncertaynties, I desired we might both agree in some generall positiōs, or irreuocable Tenents, as grounds of our ensuing dispute. Wherevpon being to proue, That
                  
                  the Protestants Church is not the true Church of Iesus Christ, nor, That it hath his true faith, I demanded of M. Walker, whether the true Church be alwayes visible, or no?

               The true Catholike Church is not visible, because itYet M. Rogers among his articles to which this minister did, or ought to haue sworne hath: The visible Church is a Catholike Church. art. 1

               My question is not of the Church Triumphant in heauen, but of the true Catholike Church Militant vpon earth.
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               But thus your wordes and question cohere not togeather: for it is as absurd to say, that the Catholike Church is militant on earth, as it is absurd to affirme, that all mankind, euen the vniuersall race of Adam, are now liuing.

So much by the way for this. Now that you may cease your wrangling, and stick no longer in

ambiguity of tearmes; I tell you once agayne, that I speake not of your Catholike, and Inuisible, but of that militant Church, which we are bound to obey, and heare, that, of whose Communion we ought to be; that, of which Christ sayd, di

               M. WALKER.
               I distinguish. That Church may be two wayes considered; either in regard of her outward men, outward duties of Christianitie, outward preaching of the Word, and administration of the sacraments, and so it is visible: Or in respect of the inward election, inward faith, and spirituall graces, and so it is inuisible.

                  Reserue your distinctions, vntill you neede them, and now answere directly to the Question.
               
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               Aske me any question, and try whether I will vse any such tergiuersation. What, is your Conscience so horride, or cause so bad, as you dare neuer giue a direct answere?
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               I answere, as I belieue.
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               And doe you not belieue, what your owne

And although he addeth that the whole Essence of the Church consisteth in them; yet he sayth, that these markes signifie, and denote a visible Church. Now, doe not you belieue as he doth? Or are you afrayd to confesse that Church to be visible which he confesseth? Man consisteth of an inuisible essence, yet is a visible man: so the Church may haue some inuisible dowries, yet be a visible Church.
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               You wronge D. Whitaker: He neuer taught that the whole Essence of the Church consisted in the true peaching of the word, and administration of Sacraments.
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               I wrong him not: He teacheth, writeth, and diuulgeth it in print; though you wrong both your self and vs, in making these digressions, and picking euery occasion to run from the matter.

Haue I not sufficiently inculcated vnto you, that my question is of the Church now militant on earth; of that Church which we ought to heare, and obey; of that which M.

Against which you contested as before: your words, to deliuer the contestation truly as it was, I must in part repeate againe, leauing out that counterfait passage which you of meer fraud so treacherously insert.

               Well I am content to make this the very issue of our meeting: And if M Whitaker affirme any such thing, let me be branded with the marke of a willfull liar, impostor, and false Prophet. But if I shew the cōtrary out of his owne writings, then shall you cōfesse your selfe a forger, a falsifier, an impostor, & a Priest of Baal.

                   Besides he often affirmeth that, though this cause be more hidden to vs, yet it is more knowne in nature, more knowne in it selfe then the Church: where he vndoubtedly speaketh not of the efficient, but of the formall cause. And who is so meane a student, as not to knowe, that the formall cause of a thing, is the chiefe, principall, and

formall essence of that, whose cause it is. 3. D.

Campian saying: This definition engendred in the natiue, and inward principles of the thing it selfe, which wee define, thou shalt neuer be able to ouerthrow. Againe in another place speaking of the same markes he sayeth; Those things which define, those denote, and signifie the Church &c. So what a Horse what a Lion, what an Eagle is, by their definition it is knowne: Therfore as the definition of an Horse, of a Lion, of an Eagle contayne their whole essence; so the aforsayd marks which define the Church, contayne the whole essence and nature of the Church. By these three Arguments so stronge, as M. Walker is not able to answere them, so cleere, as he cannot delude them; the truth of my assertion is irreproueably confirmed, & he by his owne challeng and engagement, is openly conuinced to be a wilfull liar, a forger, an impostor, a false prophet, and a Priest of Baal: for such he must be chronicled, for such entitled; and whatsoeuer heerafter he shall say or write, with that note of infamie, must be all discarded. Euen such is that which heere he writeth immediatly after.

Whitaker maintaines, that the Word trulie preached, and the Sacraments rightly administred are the certaine and infallible notes, and markes, by which euery true particular Church may be discerned to be Christs true Church; and you know, that the markes of a thinge differ from the essence and substance of it; as the signe hanging at the dore of a Tauerne, disters from the Tauerne it selfe: and the habit and cowle of a Monke, or Friar, which is the marke of his Order, differs from the Monke himselfe &c.

               Where were your wits, where was your iudgment, where the reading of you Cantabrigian Professors, when you wrote this at randome of their doctrine? For the signe of a Tauerne, the habit of a monke, are ou ward & extrinsecall signes; those of M. Whitakers

But because you are so ignorant, as not to knowe your selfe, what to say, or what your owne men teach concerning this poynt; let me examine you about another, touching the Infallibilitie of the Church.

If we consider it according to the direction of Gods holy Spirit, the assistance of Christ, his Prophets and Apostles as it is guyded by their doctrine, cleaueth close to the Scripture, and swarueth not from them; soe long we teach that it is infallible, and cannot erre.
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               But thus euerie Hereticall Assemblie is also infallible.Protestāts can chalenge no more certaynty, then all other heretikes haue done. Thus the Iewes, Turkes, Infidels, & Diuells themselues are infallible; for as long as any of these closely adhere to the word of God, are guided by his doctrine▪ and follow his direction; so long they cannot erre. And what? hath your Church no more priuiledge, or freedome from errour, then Iewes, then Turkes, then Diuels?
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               Yes, because Iewes, and Turkes adhere not to the word of God, they follow not the truth, we doe.
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               Doe you, because you say you doe? Will not they say the same, & haue as good warrant as you? But how shall we know you follow the truth?

what proofs alleage you? To chaleng it thus without proofes, seeing it is the matter controuerted between vs, is Petere principium; that is, miserably to begge the argument we handle, or to giue that for a reason which is only in question: both most ridiculous, and hissed out of all schooles. Therfore M. Walker was so wary, as to conceale in his Sūme this inference of mine, and the foolish reply, or desperate Non-plus of his. Moreouer, to say your Church cannot erre, as it cleaueth close to Gods Word, speaketh and teacheth according to it, or as long as it swarueth not from thence, is nothing els thē to auouchTheir ridiculous answere that they cannot erre, as long as they speake true &c. (though in other wordes) that it cannot erre▪ as it cleaueth to truth, speaketh and teacheth according to truth; or that it cannot erre, as long as it erreth not: which is as idle as the former was foolish; because to adhere to Gods word, is to adhere to the truth; to swarue from thence, is to runne into errour. So that this answere is nothing to the purpose, no way able to satisfie my demand: for by asking of you, Whether your Church may erre or no, I demaund, whether it be so assisted by God, and guided by his holy spirit, as it must needs cleaue to his word, it cannot depart from it in deliuering any point of faith? What answere you to this, is your Church thus inerrable, or no?
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               I haue told you alreadie, how it may erre, and how it may not.
            
            
               
               M. SMITH.
               And I haue refuted what you sayed. If you haue nothing els to answere to my Interrogatories; answere me a little to a Syllogisme, or two I shall propose; by which I meane to proue, euen by this which you haue graunted, that the Protestants Church of England, is not the true Church of IESVS Christ. And thus I frame my argument.
               That Church which hath not the word of God trulie preached, and infallibly deliuered, is not the true Church of IESVS Christ.
               But the Protestant Church of England, hath not the word of God trulie preached, and infallibly deliuered.
               Therfore, it is not the true Church of IESVS Christ.

               M. SMITH.
               I proue the Minor.
               The word of God preached in the Church of England is corrupted with errours, and the men that deliuer it, are subiect to errours.
               Therfore the Church of England hath not the word of God truly preached, and infallibly deliuered.
            
            
               
               M. WALKER.
               I deny the Antecedent.
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               The Antecedent hath two parts, the first of them I declare by induction. Malachy 2. v. 7. whereThe first Corruption of the Protestants Bible argued and euinced. all true copies haue; The lippes of the Priest shall keepe knowledge, and the law they shal

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , contrary the Latine which is custodient, and requirent, all being of the Future tense, and Indicatiue moode; which you haue changed into the Preterimperfectense of the Optatiue, or Subiunctiue moode; altering therin both moode and tense of set purpose, to gainsay the infallibility of Christs visible pastours, who lawfully succeed in the Apostles roome; and to patronage an errour, or rather Heresy of your owne, That the Priests & Prelats of Gods Church may erre in doctrine; and so the people not bound to require the law at their mouthes.
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               We haue not corrupted the Hebrew text, for the true meaning of the Holy Ghost is perfectly deliuered by our Translation.
            
            
               
               M. SMITH.
               But answere me directly. Are not the Hebrew,In which they haue altered both the mood & tense written by God. Greeke, and Latin wordes all in the future Tense? Do they not all import, shall keepe, and shall require? And haue not you altered both the tense, and moode? Is it not so? what say you?
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               Though the wordes be in the future tense, yet wee haue kept the true sense, because the future tense in Hebrew by reason of vau conuersiuum, may sometime stand for the preterimperfect tense of the Optatiue, Potentiall, o
                     •
                   Subiunctiue moode, as our translation hath; therfore it is no
                     •
                   different, nor irregular from the Hebrew, which is the Originall.
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               But this is a meere collusion, for heere is no Vau conuersiuum in that place, nor can there be, as all that are cunninge in the Hebrew can tell; so that this shift will not serue your turne; nor that other of keeping the sense. For I accuse you of corrupting the text: But to alter the tense, to alter the moode, to alter the word of the Holy Ghost, is to corrupt the text, to change the diuine characters written by the finger of God: Therfore your Translation is guilty of this change, and corruption. Otherwise if adulterers of Scripture, may iudge of the sense, where shall you find any adulteration?

what Heretike can be conuinced of corruptiō? For aske the Arians, aske the Valentinians, aske Marcion, who for paring, or gnawing away many places of Gods word, was called Mus-Ponticus, the mouse of Pontus, aske any of these Corrupters; they will all answere, they keep the sense, & bring as sound arguments, as you do, for the maintenance therof: for such is your proofe.

                  and do whatsoeuer they shall teach according to the law. It is consonant to these texts, and sundry the like; to which your translation being dissonant, it must needes be, not only a corruption of the text, but a deprauation also of the sense of the Holy Ghost.
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               That cannot be the sense, because the Priests, vnto whome the Prophet speaketh there in the 2. of Malachy, were Leuites, and succeded Aaron in the Priesthood, and yet they were departed out of the way; they caused many to fall in the law by their corrupt glosse; and their abuse of the couenant of Leui &c. Yea some of them had sacrificed to Idols, as Iosephus sheweth in his history.
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               As though it were necessary for al Priests that haue lawfull calling to be free from errour? or such as are fensed from erring in fayth, should neuer be able to stumble in their liues? It is inough for the infalibility of Christs Spouse, that the high Priest, and his Consistory, that the head of the Church, & her generall Councels be inerrable. It is inough that God doth preserue his truth in the mouthes of vicious, and wicked men; as in the mouthes of Scribes, and Pharisies, when they sate on Moyses his Chaire; as the guift of prophesie in Ciaphas, of whom S. Iohn recordeth, that he prophesied, because he was high Priest of that yeare. Seest thou

To this slaunder is ioyned another of his notable leasinges, reporting me to haue sayd, that Peruc signifies only to redeeme; wheras I confessed at the beginning, that it signified to destroy, redeeme, breake in peeces, breake asunder, but neuer to cease to doe, or breake off a worke, as their translation runneth.

               Well, if the word doth import, to breake in peeces,

No such manner of speach is vsuall in the place we handle, and the case it selfe is far otherwise. For a ma may breake off, or interrupt a busines for a tyme, which he liketh, approoueth, and meaneth after, when opportunity serueth, to prosecute, and accomplish.

Therfore though your English Coppy beareth the sound of a small corruption, yet the treachery is great, and deprauation most viperous; because it taketh away all reference to the demolition, redemption, and expiation of sinnes, by satisfactory workes of Pennance, and Almes-deedes; which the true meaning of the word enforceth, and the Holy Ghost therby intended. To conclude, if the Hebrew word had bin doubtfull, as it is not; then the Originalls of Greeke, and Latine, might haue directed you, without seeking a new sense, and faygned signification of your owne.

Now to say, that the whole Scripture is called by the name of Mishne, is as absurd, as to mantayne that the whole Scripture is called Deuteronomy. And out of that bare word Mishne to inferre, the Scriptures to haue beene primarily writtē with pricks, is most ridiculous, because euen in the place you cite, it is as much distinguished from the first and primary Scripture, as a coppy from the original, a

patterne from the Prototypon, and is expounded ioyned with Thorah, a doubled, or second Law.

               M. Smiths Companion.
               No good Sir, It is no more a contradiction to deny Mishne Thorah, or Deuteronomy to import the Scripture indeterminately, and yet to graunt it to be a part of the Scripture; then to deny you to be a true Minister of Christ, and yet to graunt you to be a Minister: for Mickra indeed is the common word, by which the Iewes expresse the Scripture.
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               
                  I answere, that the Scripture hath diuers names, it is called Thorah, Chethab, Mickra, and Mishne.
               
               M. Smiths Companion.
               Are not you ashamed, after the labour of so many months study to write so impertinently; for Thorah signifieth only part of the Scripture, or Pentateuch, Chethab any writing; as Esther. 8. v. 8. the kings letter is called Chethab: & as for Mishne, you alledge no text, or testimony to prooue that it betokeneth the Scripture. But see Pagnine, and you shal find that the word neuer expresseth any Scripture

at all, but with the word Thorah, as Mishne Thorah, it betokeneth a repetition, or second law, as Deutero. 17. 18. Iosue 8. 20. But where Thorah is left out, it signifieth only the second. Looke Esther 10. 3. 4. Reg. 22. v. 14. ibid. c. 23. v. 4. and so M. Walker bewrayeth his little skill in Rabbins, who though he flourisheth in his writing with the muster of some of theyr names, and Commentaries; yet he could not remember at the meeting, to cite any one of their authorities.

               Thus you see M. Walker, how you wil be alwayes flinching from the matter, though you be still beaten backe to your owne shame and confusion. To returne therfore from whence we are digressed. If the Greek, and Latin be adulterated in the former place of Daniel, the Hebrew is alike corrupted; because Peruc properly signifieth to redeeme, as 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   in Greeke, Redime doth in Latin (hence Peric signifieth a Redeemer, Purkan Redemption) and so Theodotio, so Vatablus, so S. Ierome, and so all others expresse the word: wherfore either all texts are falsified, or all are true. If all be false, the Hebrew is tainted with corruption, as wel as the Greeke and Latin; if all true, your translation is inexcusable, in discording frō the truth of all originalls, from the version of all the Auncients.

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Traditio: For in such textes as mention good and holsome Traditions, they in lieu of Traditions, read Ordinances: where the Scripture speaketh of such as be naughty, or friuolous, they in hatred of our Apostolicall Traditions, carefully set downe the right word Traditions. The same deceit they practise in expressing the Hebrew word Sheol, Hell; For where it may import a third place besides Heauen, & Hell, they warily turne it into Graue, Gen. 37. v. 35. Osee 13. v. 14. but where it cannot be meant of any other then of the dungeon of the damned, there they rightly translate it; as in the 15. of the Prouerbes v. 24. Hel beneath. I might haue vrged how they iuggle with the word worthy, or make worthy, against the merit of workes; how they change Iustifications into Statutes, Iustice into Righteousnes, against inherent Iustice; how they sometyme forsake the Hebrew and

retire to the Greeke, as in the 9 of Prouerbes v. 2. Wisdome hath mingled her wine: because the Hebrew word Masecha wholy fauoureth the ancient mingling of water and wine in the Chalice, which the Fathers vrge as necessary, and Protestants vtterly neglect, they fly to the ambiguity of the Greeke word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which may signify to powre out, as well as to mingle: & so did they alwayes read before his Maiesties Correction. Otherwhiles they leaue the Greeke, and haue recourse to the Latin, as Act. 13. though the Greeke be

                  to our Lord, as Erasmus translateth it, yet your translation still runneth according to the Latine they ministring vnto our Lord, because you cannot abide that word, although written by God, which doth any way relish of the Sacrifice of the Masse. These and a thousand such of your guilefull sleights I might haue alleadged; howbeit to condescend to the reasonable motion of Syr Edward Harwood and the rest, I willingly omitted them, and returned to prooue the second part of my first Antecedent which you denied.
               The Antecedent was this.
               The Word of God preached in the Church of England is corrupted with errours, and the men that deliuer, it are subiect to errours.
               The former part is already prooued by the manifest adulterations of your Bible before mentioned.
               
                  The second Part.
               That your men also are subiect to errour, I conuince by the confessiō of M. Reynoldes, M. Whitaker,

               Therfore your men, your Preachers, and Pastours are subiect to errour.
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               I graunt, that the true Church may erre for a tyme insome one fundamentall point necessary to saluation; & this I affirme of the Protestant Church, of our Church of England: Ground what you can vpon this.
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               Though some of the Catholikes heerevpon cryed out, We haue inough, inough, let vs leaue of our dispute, yet to giue more full satisfaction to the Protestāt Gentlemen, who perceaued not so soone the absurdity of this Paradoxe, or folly of M. VValker, in granting that very part of my Antecedent which before he denyed, I proceeded a little further, and argued thus against him.
               If your Church may erre in one point necessary to saluation, it may as well erre in another, and so cā propose nothing vndoubtedly to be belieued,

as an article of fayth. Which inference though M. VValker denyed, and with many cauillations laboured to diuert, yet it euidently followeth, as I thus declare.
               That Church which hath not sufficient authority to persuade all the mysteries of fayth she proposeth, to be infallibly true, can propose nothing vndoubtedly to be belieued as an article of fayth.
               But your Church which may erre now in one point, now in another, at least for a tyme, hath not sufficient authority to persuade all the mysteries of fayth she proposeth to be infallibly true.
               Therefore, your Church can propose nothing vndoubtedly to be belieued, as an article of fayth.
               For seeing the Articles in which your Church may erre, are not specified by God, nor knowne to your followers; they may iustly feare, and suspect least those she now proposeth, be some of them, in which she may erre: But with feare and suspition no fayth can stand, nothing can she propose which ought vndoubtedly to be belieued, as S. Augustine in the like case most excellently discourseth, saying: How can he be belieued who thinketh he may

                     mmaūdeth vs to beleeue him. So you that hold, your Church may sometyme erre, haue cause to doubt, least then perchance she erreth, when she commaundeth

you to follow her doctrine. If cause to doubt, no cause to obey, no cause to credit her. Nay it implyeth cōtradictiō we should with diuine fayth giue credit vnto her: For by fayth we are assured,Fayth & doubtfulnes cānot comply togeather of one & the same thing. that the thing she teacheth cannot possibly be otherwise, then we belieue: By doubtfulnes, or suspicion we mistrust they may be otherwise: Els why do we doubt? Why do we suspect? Therfore it is a manifest implicancy, and irreconciliable cō
                  tradiction, that fayth and doubtfulnes should cō
                  sist togeather; that we should be vndoubtedly persuaded of the truth proposed, yet stagger and misdoubt of the truth therof; as you haue iust cause to do, as long as you maintayne, that your Church may deceaue you.
               Besides, to prooue out of the former Paradoxe, that your Church is not the true Church, I framed these Syllogismes.
               That Church which may erre for a tyme, in a fū
                  damentall point, necessary to saluation, hath no certainty for that tyme.
               Yours is such.
               
                  Ergo, it is no true Church. Againe.
               That Church which may erre for a tyme, in a fū
                  damentall point, necessary to saluation, hath not sufficient meanes of saluation, for that tyme.
               Yours is such.
               
                  Ergo, it is no true Church.
            
            
               
               M. WALKER.
               
                  These arguments are sophisticall, and faulty, because they haue foure termes. With the same Censure he discarded other Syllogismes as crazy & imperfect, he denied to answere any Enthymeme: and such was his feare of hazarding both cause and credit, as he reiected also a true, and perfect Syllogisme in moode, in figure, as the Roman Catholike, whome he mentioned, maintayned against him. Though he did not renounce his saluatiō if it were not true, which M. Walker after his wonted fashion most iniuriously reporteth of him.
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               Your cause lyeth a bleeding, whē you thus begin to wrangle about Syllogismes; yet these two which I haue heere repeated, with the third which immediatly followeth in your Summe, are such as no Scholler would reprehend. For the conclusion which seems to make the Syllogisme, & consists of foure termes, supposeth another Syllogisme vertually inuolued, which to auoid tediousnes I did not expresse: After which manner all Enthymenes are iustified, and allowed, notwithstanding one of the premisses be suppressed, and the conclusion be immediatly inferred.

               That Church which hath not the whole, entire, and infallible fayth, hath not meanes sufficient to saluation.
               But that Church which may erre for a tyme, in a fundamētall point, hath not the whole, entire, and infallible fayth.
               Therfore, it hath not meanes sufficient to saluation.
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               I deny your Minor, and do put you to prooue, that the Church which may erre, hath not the whole and infallible fayth.
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               If it do erre, it hath not whole & entire fayth; if it may erre it hath not infallible fayth: as thus I prooue.
               That Church which is subiect to errour, in a fū
                  damentall point, hath not the whole and infallible fayth.

But that Church, which may erre in such a point, is subiect to errour.
               Therfore, it hath not whole, and infallible fayth.
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               I must tell you▪ that your Minor proposition is false. For a Church may be so farre subiect to errour, that it may haue a possibility to erre, yet not be void of the whole and infallible fayth. It is one thing to be subiect to errour, and another to erre actually: We hold, that our Church may erre, but doe not thinke that it doth erre in any fundamentall point.
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               If it may erre, if it hath a possibility to erre, it is as bad as if it did erre, in respect of the certainty which fayth requireth: for thus I argue.
               That Church which is fallible in a fundamentalM. Walker was affrayd this last argumēt of mine, should come to light, therefore he purposely suppresseth it in his Sūme point of fayth, is not also infallible in the whole and entire fayth.
               But your Church which is subiect to errour, which hath a possibility to erre, in a fundamentall point of fayth, is fallible.
               Therfore, it is not also infallible in the whole & entire fayth: Vnlesse it may be in one and the same thing both fallible, and infallible, subiect to errour, and not subiect, which is impossible.

                  revpon I concluded, that sith the Protestāt Church is fallible in fayth, it hath not any true, &

supernaturall fayth: if it hath no true fayth, it cā
                  not be a true Church, which were the two things I was engaged to prooue: and so I haue fully discharged my taske, to the satisfaction I hope of all that be present. For M.

Therfore some of his companions intreated he might argue a while, to see whether he could haue better fortune in impugning our Church, thē he had in defending theirs. But before I relate the disputation he begā, I think it expedient for the instruction of such as are better conuersant in Diuinity, to vnfold certayne Theologicall Principles, or Articles of fayth, whereby the force of my former argument, the truth of our doctrine, the folly of protestancy, and the enormity of M. Walkers answere, may more apparently be discouered.
               The first Principle is, that Fidei non potest subess

                      falsum, fayth cannot be subiect to any falsity: FaithThree remarkable principles

                  strong comfort. But as it is impossible for God to lye,

impossible for him to witnes that which may be false: So it is impossible for the habit of Fayth to incline, or for the act of Fayth to assent to that which is lyable to any falshood: As S. Thomas singularly
                     8. Thom▪
                      1. 2. q. 1. art. 3. & Scholast. 3. dist▪
                      24. 25. well prooueth by these 3. Reasons. First, because nothing can belong to the habit or act of fayth, except that which appertaineth to theyr formall obiect, and in such sort as it is instilled, conueyed, and drawne from thence: Euen as no colour can be seene, vnlesse it be garnished with the beames of light. But to prime Verity no falsity can belong, not only any actuall falshood, but not so much as any thing that hath a possibility to be fals; no more then any pronesse to euill can appertayne to soueraigne goodnes, or the least shadow of darknes to light inaccessable. Therfore Fayth, which hath prime Verity for her obiect, must not only be free from actuall errour, but from all lyablenes therunto, or possibility of erring. Secondly, euery act, euery habit, is necessarily lincked with equall proportion of certainty, or assurance, with the certainty of the obiect, of which it borroweth its dignity, nature, and forme: Wherfore as the prime Verity, and testimony of God; so the habit, and act of Fayth, are both infallible. Thirdly, Fayth is an intellectuall Vertue which doth perfect, & enoble the faculty of our Vnderstanding, which cannot receaue the dye of perfection from any other thing then that which is true, because that only, as all Philosophers teach, is her proper, & peculiar

obiect. Hence it is, that S. Paul describeth Fayth

               The second Principle presupposeth, that FaithThe 2▪ Principle. must not only be infallible, but whole also, and entire: Witnes S. Athanasius in the beginning of his Creed, Whosoeuer doth not beleiue the Catholike faith wholy & i

                        •
                     racted; because vnlesse fayth be one, it is no fayth, the Apostle auerring, One Lord, One fayth. To which purpose our Sauiour himself auoucheth: He that beleiueth not, shall be condemned: that is; he that beleiueth not euery Article, expresly or implicitely, he that beleiueth not the whole summe of Christian doctrine, shall incurre the forfaiture of his saluation. For as all thinges are to be obserued whatsoeuer Christ commanded;
                  Math. 28. v. 20. so all thinges to be beleiued whatsoeuer he taught: and in such manner, that albeit the mysteries in themselues are some of lesse, some of greater moment, some necessary, some contingent; yet as they are testified, & reuealed by God, they ought all with equall certaintie, with the same suretie to be credited & imbraced; because God in all things

little or great, necessarie or contingent, is equally great, & of infallible credit: Wherby euery Article is so fast riuetted, and conioyned one with the other, in such vniforme & due proportion, as they make, sayth S. Gregory Nazianzen, A Chayne truly
                  Greg. ora. 37. Amb. ad

                  golden, and soueraigne. From which, if your withdraw but one, you withdraw your saluation, as S. Ambrose writeth.
               The third principle is, that the ordinary meanesThe 3. principle. of atteyning the whole and infallible fayth, is from the mouth of the Church, from the lipps of herRom. 5. v. 17. Priests, because fayth is by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ: to wit, by the word expounded and preached vnto vs, by his lawfull Pastours: for itIbid. v. 14. goeth immediatly before, How shall they heare without à Preacher, and how shall they preach vnlesse they be sent? Whervpon it necessarily ensueth, that if they be sent from God to teach his heauenly doctrine, if we be bound to beleiue vpon their testification and preaching, their preaching must be certaine, their testification vndeceiuable, that we may securely1. Thes. 2. v. 2

                   receyue the word they deliuer; not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the word of God, who by their mouthes speaketh, by their testimony sealeth, and witnesseth it vnto vs; especially seeing he commandeth vs to heare them as himself, to obey them asLuc. 10. his Vicegerents, to beleiue them vnder penaltie of damnation; seing he giueth them the Holy Ghost,Ioh. 16 & 17. Ephes. 4. 
                  to teach them all truth, to sanctifie them in veritie, that we be not carryed about with any winde of doctrine.
                  
Therefore as God cannot immediatly by himself, or mediatly by any other, deliuer that which may be doubtfull or vncertaine; so much lesse by the mouth of those his witnesses, his iudges, his interpreters,In the 3. Part of my An▪ tid. chap.

For it is a warrantable position of M. Whitakers; Such as the meanes be, such of necessitie must be the interpretation it selfe: But the meanes of interpreting obscur

If the publicke spirit of their Church be errable, how deceiuable is their priuate? Againe, the priuate spirit is hidden, it cannot be discouered and opened to others, and yet it is open it self to a thousand illusions. Therefore it must be tryed by some more known, and certaine spirit: What then, do you build vpō the voice of God that speaketh in the Scripture? but that voyce is no other then the bare word or out ward letter of Holy writ; of that ariseth our strife and debate. That also speaketh most errably to you, as your owne contentions and infinite hersies sprung from thence, beare euident witnes. If your reply, that it speaketh inerrably to such a read, and heare it with faith, and humilitie as they ought; you send me still a rouing in the wildernes of vncertaintie; for how shall I know who they be, that obserue those conditions as they ought? And what is this, as they ought, after your Puritanicall, or Caluinian manner?
               Lastly let it be (for this wilbe) your last, and poorest refuge, that the true Church of IESVS Christ hath alwayes such well known to him; what is this to you, if you know them not? What if we disproue, as we plainly doe, your Church to be his? Where are your humble Readers? your faithfull

interpreters? Or to yield you the vttermost your can aske, though most impudently begged at our hands; let there be such Readers, such Interpreters among you; eyther they alwayes infallibly obserue the conditions specified, interpreting still a right, and then your Church by their direction, contrarie to your Tenent, can neuer erre: Or they fallibly obserue them, and so your Church may run astray, it cannot be the pillar of faith, the storehouse of truth, the voyce, or trumpet of supernaturall beleife; as my last two Syllogismes printed by M. Walker vndeniably conclude: which as long as they shall remaine registred in his Pamphlet, so long shall it beare the record of his owne disgrace; so long shall it proclayme the victorie of our Catholike cause; so long shall the Protestant Church lie panting in the dust, without life, without strength, without vitall breath? Now let vs behold what new life M. Walker can breath into it, to reuiueThis argument crosseth it selfe in termes, for if the Church erred in a fundamentall poynt, it was not true; if true, it erred not. it againe? Marry, that a true Christian Church may erre for a tyme, in some one fundamentall poynt, necessarie to saluation, he disputeth thus.

               That which the auncient Apostolicall Church might doe, other succeeding Churches may doe, with the same successe.
               But the Apostolicall Church might erre, and did erre in a maine poynt, and yet haue a true faith, and was a true Church.

               I deny the Minor. The Apostolical Church did not erre in a maine point of Fayth.
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               The act of Christs Resurrection from the dead taught in Scripture, is a fundamentall point of Fayth. The Apostolicall church did erre in it. Ergo &c.
            
            
               
               M. SMITH.
               I distinguish the Minor. The Apostles erred, or rather were ignorant of the act of Christes Resurrection, as a matter of fact, I graunt the Minor; as an Article of faith, I deny it: for it was indeed a diuine verity, a true matter of fact at that tyme, yet no article of faith.
            
            
               M. WALKER.
               Behold Gentlemen he denyeth the Resurrection to be an Article of faith.
            
            
               M. Smiths Companion.
               You wilfully abuse him; he denyeth it not absolutly, but only for that tyme, because it was not then sufficiently promulgated.
            
            
               M. WALKER.

                  expresse words of Scripture. So opening the booke he read, how some of the Apostles knew not the Scriptures, that he must rise from the dead: how our SauiourMar. 16. v. 14. appeared to the eleauen Apostles, and vpbrayded their incredulity and hardnes of hart▪ because they belieued not them who had seene him after he was risen.
               
               At this Syr William Harington houlding vp his handes, sayd: Oh, I protest I neuer heard any poynt so playnely prooued!
               
            
            
               
               M. SMITH.
               Proued? he hath proued nothing. For I graunt the Apostles were slow in belieuing, dull in vnderstanding the resurrection of Christ; but I say, it was not then an article of fayth, which they were obliged expressely to belieue, because it was not so clearely promulgated, and proued vnto them, as to bynd them vnder the payne of Heresy, or note of Infidelity, at that tyme to imbrace.
               A Protestant Gentleman.
               
                  Say you soe? Was it not expressely reuealed in Scripture? sufficiently promulgated by Christ himself?
               
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               I acknowledge the reuelation of scripture, the promulgation of Christ sufficient in themselues; yet not in respect of the Apostles capacity; for they were yet rude and weake of vnderstanding, they had not as yet that inward illustration and light of the holy Ghost, those outward motiues, and arguments of credibility, which did binde them to giue infallible assent to so deep a mystery. They assented and belieued, that all was true which Christ sayd, all true which the Scriptures reuealed concerning his Resurrection; yet they knew not whether the sense and meaning of those passages were to be taken truely or enigmatically, properly or figuratiuely. Of this only were they ignorant; and this

ignorance proceeded from their imbecillity and weakenesse, and not from the insufficiency of holy Scripture.
               The Gentleman satisfied with this, & M. Walker
                  M. Walker silenced with the first distinctiō made against him. grauelled with the former answere, his reasoning was at an end: howbeit his brawling would haue no end, for the foresayd distinction held him at such a bay, as notwithstanding he bragged much of his dexterity in disputing, yet with all his cunning Sophistry he could not so much as frame one argument, one Syllogisme, or Enthimeme against it. But being in a monstrous rage, because his pryde could not brooke such a fowle ouerthrowe, I thought good to giue way to his chafing fit, and so departed with these very wordes: VVell, well; I perceiue my distinction hath choked your argument, you are not able to proceed. Now, after that I arose and walked hard by, the other Priest that assisted me explicating the answere that I had giuen, sayd.
               M. Smiths Companion.
               It is not much to be meruailed, that the Apostles at the first conceaued not aright the Resurrection of Christ: for the Apostolicall Church was then in her infancy; it was newly raysed, not wholy finished; begun, but not perfected; The Euangelicall law was deliuered, yet not fully established.
               And can this vndergoe the censure of any other doctrine, then sound and orthodoxall? Or could M. Walker iustly vaunt of any allegation he brought

against M. Smith? Then read and detest the arrogant style of an hereticall Impostor, who blusheth not to print, after his confusion, these flourishing wordes.

Smith being put to silence with those proofes,Loe the vanitie of a vanquished minister. the other Priest to make vs this breach, fled to another shift, and denyed the Apostles to haue byn a Church at that tyme, because the Holy Ghost was not yet come downe, nor the Euangelicall law reuealed.
            
            
               M. SMITH.
               If you were not already returned in open Court for a willfull lyar, forger, false Prophet, and Priest of Baal, your wordes might beare some shew of credit: but in so much as you are notoriously defamed for such an one, I onely intreat the Reader to iudge, whether I were silenced, or you; whether my Companion fled to another shift, or defended the answere which I gaue: Whether you haue not writhed his wordes to a faulty strayne, of purpose to reprooue them. For he denyed not the Apostles to haue byn at that tyme a Church, nor that the Euangelicall law was reuealed; but that it was not promulgated; that the Church was not yet perfect, or law cōplete. For how could it be then fully cōplete, when it wanted diuers guiftes and endowments, necessary to the entyre complement and perfection therof? When it wanted the spirituall

comfort, and inward Vnction of the Holy Ghost? When it wanted her outward promulgation essentially8. Thom.

Walker, how could your conscience serue you to carpe, or reprehend that saying of his, strengthned and supported by such warrantable proofes?

                   with tearming the Apostles ignorance or hardnesse of hart, an errour of forgetfulnesse? 2. To faygne me to say, that the Scriptures had not expressely reuealed, how Christ should rise from the dead? 3. To faygne, that I intreated you to shew it me out of the Ghospell? 4. That I persisted still, how the Scriptures had not sufficiently reuealed it? All most iniurious and hideous lyes.
               Notwithstāding these leasinges of his, or selfedeuised fancyes, he mustreth a band of three seuerall probations, and graceth the last with the admiratiō or solemne acclamation of one of his Assistantes, howbeit it was vsed vpon another occasion. Such is euery where the iugling of that vain-glorious Sycophant: yet he dischargeth me from the labour of refuting his arguments, sith they are nothing else but engines raysed to batter

the forts of his owne conceits: which neuertheles he suffereth not to fall to the ground without the sound of his fellowes applause, praysing himselfe for ouercomming himselfe, in such a skirmish, in which he is both the assayler, and the assayled, he the Maister, and he the maystered, idely conquering, and basely conquered both at once.
               Moreouer he reprooueth me for making a strange distinction between a thing, as he tearmeth it, and it selfe: because I sayd, that the act of Christs Resurrection was a true matter of fact, a diuine Verity, yet no article of fayth, which the Apostles then were bound expresly to belieue. But is this so strange? I will giue you an instance of the like strange distinction. The validity of baptisme ministred by Heretiks was alwayes a diuine Verity, alwayes a truth sufficiently reuealed in holy Scriptures, in the first of S. Iohn, and the thirdIoan. 1. v. 33. Luc. 3. v. 10. of S. Luke, where it is written: It is he that baptizeth: Christ is the principall agent, whose action cannot be frustrated by the faultes of his instrument; yet this was not alwayes an article of fayth, vntill it was publickly defined by the Consistory of Gods Church; which caused Vincentius Lirynensis to free them from heresy who defended the contrary before; to condemne such as persisted in vpholding it after the definition; his wordes are these: O wonderfull change and alteration of thinges!

               Finally M. Walker for his vpshot, relateth the commendation a Catholike gaue him of his noble conquest after he was thus discomfited. I reprint his words, which he for very shame disguiseth vnder the cloke of a third person.

               When the Priestes were very willing to make an end, and the Protestant Gentlemen seemed well satisfied, and made them ready to depart; One of the Roman Catholiques calling M. Walker aside, began to collogue and flatter with him, telling him, that he was a goodOh the pride! Oh the folly of this man! Logician, a good Linguist, and well read, and that God had giuen him a sharp wit and ready tongue, and therfore no meruaile though he preuayled, and made a good cause seeme bad when he opposed it, and a bad cause seem good, when he defended it.

               Fye, fie, M. Walker! Are you so greedy of a little vayn-glory as thus to blazon with your owne pen (for you penned the whole summe though you maske it vnder another vizard) the false lustre of your supposed talents? Of such as neuer were acknowledged by any of your Pew-fellowes in Cā

and man, and is ready, if need require, to confirme it with his Oath, yea and iuridically to diuulge it to all the word: First, that he neuer gaue you those high titles of commendation, which you set downe; Secondly, that the Courtly complements he cast vpon you were meerely in iest by the figure of Ironia, as the Wisedome of God iested at Adam after his fall, saying: Loe Adam is become as it were one of vs, knowing good

                  and euill: yet such was your quick and subtile wit so worthy of admiration, as it conceiued that to be spoken in good earnest, which was vttered in derision, to laugh you to scorne.
               By which, and by all the former passages, euery indifferēt man may easily perceiue, 1. How poore a Religion Protestancy is, and how weake a Patrone heere she had, who could bring no better propps to sustaine it, then knauery, fraudulency, lyes, and falsifications. 2. How Thraso-lyke M.

                  e had made in Syon? What ruines in his owne Ierusalē? For by attaching the Apostolicall Church of erring in a fundamentall point, manifestly reuealed in holy Scripture, and often intimated by the Sonne of God, he attacheth it of Infidelity, he enditeth it of Heresie, and wholy depriueth it of the happy meanes of saluation. For the entire profession of sauing truth (as Caluin, Field, and otherCaluin.

The same is more strongly confirmed by the dotage it selfe. M. Walker very dotingly laboured to proue (or else proued nothing for his purpose,) That the Apostolike Church erred in a fundamentall point necessary to

saluation; For if it was necessary, the Church could not be saued without it; if it might be saued without it, it was not an article at that tyme necessary to be belieued.
               Neyther doth he only bereaue that pure and primitiue flocke of the riches of blisse, of the integrity of fayth in that one he specified, but by the same argument, in all other points of belief. For as by one mortall sinne the Vertue of charity is wholy expelled, according to S. Iames, He that offendeth in

Whitaker also approueth, saying: If any one fundamentall point of doctrine be remoued, the Church presently falleth. Wherupon it followeth, that the Apostolicall Church was presently buried in her owne ruines; that the Apostles made ship wrack of their fayth; that they were no Chistians when they beleeued not the Resurrection of Christ, if then they were bound to receiue it as a fundamentall article of their beliefe. Nay it followeth hereon, that the whole fould of Christ (for it was wholy no doubt inwrapped in the Apostles errour) became (ô monstrous impiety and

most hellish consequence!) became I say, a heardNote the blasphemles, which ensue of M. Walkers argumēt: and the misery of Protestās who cannot make their false Church true, vnlesse they make the true Church false. of Miscreants, a band of Infidells, a den of Apostataes. The chast and vndefiled spouse of Christ (I dread to think it) fell to be an Adulteresse; his pure Virhin, the harlot of Sathan. And because that which befell the Apostolicke Church may by M. Walkers owne Logick, befall in lyke manner vnto all other Churches; the Protestants Church, not only by meere possibility, but actually also may be stayned with Heresies, tainted with Apostasie, blinded with Infidelity, wholy reuolt and fall from Christ.

Cyprian: Therfore the Protestantes Church, which may really be naught, may actually fall, and prostitute her selfe to some filthy or distoyall errour, can by no means be the true Spouse, the true Church, the true Kingdome, or Campe of Christ; nor enioy the dowryes, possesse the treasures of his inerrable Truth.
